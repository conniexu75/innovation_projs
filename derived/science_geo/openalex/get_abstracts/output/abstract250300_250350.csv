The molecular mechanisms by which the sumoylation of target proteins regulates diverse cellular functions remain poorly understood. Here we report isolation and characterization of SUMO1- and SUMO2-binding motifs. Using yeast two-hybrid system, bioinformatics, and NMR spectroscopy we define a common SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) and map its binding surfaces on SUMO1 and SUMO2. This motif forms a β-strand that could bind in parallel or antiparallel orientation to the β2-strand of SUMO due to the environment of the hydrophobic core. A negative charge imposed by a stretch of neighboring acidic amino acids and/or phosphorylated serine residues determines its specificity in binding to distinct SUMO paralogues and can modulate the spatial orientation of SUMO-SIM interactions.

SUMO proteins are small ubiquitin (Ub) 5The abbreviations used are: Ub, ubiquitin; SIM, SUMO-interacting motif; UIM, ubiquitin-interacting motif; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; SH, Src homology; UBD, Ub-binding domain.5The abbreviations used are: Ub, ubiquitin; SIM, SUMO-interacting motif; UIM, ubiquitin-interacting motif; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; SH, Src homology; UBD, Ub-binding domain.-related modifiers that become conjugated to cellular substrates and regulate diverse cellular processes including cell cycle progression, intracellular trafficking, transcription, and DNA repair (1Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar, 2Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 3Ulrich H.D. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: R257-R259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Like Ub, a SUMO protein is covalently attached to target proteins through an isopeptide bond by a mechanism similar to that of ubiquitination, which involves E1, E2, and E3 enzymes (4Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6792) Google Scholar). In mammals, three SUMO paralogues are commonly expressed: SUMO1 shares about 45% identity to SUMO2 and SUMO3, while SUMO2 and SUMO3 are 96% identical to each other (2Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 5Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar).The structures of all three SUMO paralogues resemble the globular and compact Ub-like fold (6Bayer P. Arndt A. Metzger S. Mahajan R. Melchior F. Jaenicke R. Becker J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 7Huang W.C. Ko T.P. Li S.S. Wang A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 4114-4122Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The differences of SUMO1 and SUMO2 are mostly found in the second β-strand and the α-helix of both proteins (7Huang W.C. Ko T.P. Li S.S. Wang A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 4114-4122Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In cells, different SUMO paralogues appear to share common properties but also have some distinct functions. For example, the promyelocytic leukemia protein is conjugated to all three SUMO paralogs (8Sternsdorf T. Puccetti E. Jensen K. Hoelzer D. Will H. Ottmann O.G. Ruthardt M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5170-5178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Kito K. Fukuda-Kamitani T. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3117-3120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), whereas RanGAP1 is preferentially modified with SUMO1 (10Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar) and topoisomerase II with SUMO2/3 during mitosis (11Azuma Y. Arnaoutov A. Dasso M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the distribution of the SUMO paralogues within cells seems to be different. SUMO1 is uniquely found within the nucleoli, the nuclear envelope, and cytoplasmic foci, whereas SUMO2/3 are accrued on chromosomes at an earlier point in the nuclear reformation process (12Ayaydin F. Dasso M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5208-5218Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Interestingly, there is a larger pool of free, non-conjugated SUMO2/3 than of SUMO1 (10Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar).In addition to targeting different substrate proteins, the functional properties of SUMO isoforms in vivo might also reflect their ability to mediate distinct protein-protein interactions. Indeed, recent studies have shown that SUMO paralogues can promote non-covalent binding to other proteins containing specific motifs that recognize SUMO paralogues. Minty and coworkers defined a Ser-Xaa-Ser motif surrounded by hydrophobic and acidic amino acids as a SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) (13Minty A. Dumont X. Kaghad M. Caput D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36316-36323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Biophysical studies of the SIM in PIAS revealed that the small hydrophobic region is an essential determinant of SUMO recognition (14Song J. Durrin L.K. Wilkinson T.A. Krontiris T.G. Chen Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14373-14378Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Moreover, the SUMO-binding motif was proposed as Lys-Xaa3–5-[Val/Ile]-[Ile/Leu]2-Xaa3-[Asp/Glu/Gln/Asn]-[Asp/Glu]2 in yeast proteins (15Hannich J.T. Lewis A. Kroetz M.B. Li S.J. Heide H. Emili A. Hochstrasser M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4102-4110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Recent publications revealed that the hydrophobic core can bind both parallel and antiparallel to SUMO (16Reverter D. Lima C.D. Nature. 2005; 435: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 17Song J. Zhang Z. Hu W. Chen Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40122-40129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). It is thought that sumoylated targets may control cell functions depending on their ability to interact with effectors containing SUMO-binding motifs. However, most of the SUMO interacting studies were done with the SUMO1 paralogue.In this study we describe the identification and characterization of novel SUMO1- and SUMO2-binding partners containing a universal SIM. The molecular and structural details are presented explaining the basis for SIM binding to distinct SUMO paralogues. We show that the E3 ligase PIASxα is phosphorylated in vivo within the SIM and that phosphorylation influences its binding to SUMO1 but not to SUMO2. In the case of TTRAP, a protein that binds SUMO2 much stronger than SUMO1, and PIASxα we show that negative charged amino acids surrounding the hydrophobic core influence binding to SUMO1 but not to SUMO2.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Two-hybrid Screen—Sequences corresponding to SUMO1(ΔGG) and SUMO2(ΔGG) were subcloned in pYTH9 vector between SalI and BglII restriction site creating fusion proteins with Gal4-DNA-binding domain. Both vectors were introduced using lithium acetate/polyethylene glycol transfomation with herring testis carrier DNA into Y190 yeast strain cDNA libraries were then similarily introduced and transformed cells were grown on agar plates containing a synthetic dropout medium (BD Bioscience) without leucine, tryptophan, histidine, and with 25 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. Colonies that grew on the selection medium were transferred to a filter and assayed for β-galactosidase activity with substrate X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-βd-galactopyranoside).Plasmid DNA was extracted using a glass bead disruption method and were amplified by transformation and lysis of DH5α bacteria. Plasmids were then retransformed into yeast containing the bait to confirm binding and grown on the same agar plates as described above. After X-gal test plasmids were sequenced.To compare the strength of interaction between SUMO1 and SUMO2, 1.5 μg of each plasmid were retransformed in yeast containing SUMO1 and SUMO2 in parallel and grown on the agar plates described above. After 6 days three different colonies (if colonies grew at all) were replicated to another agar plate. After 3 days colonies were transferred to a filter to compare the growth of yeast containing SUMO1 and SUMO2 and the interacting partners.Plasmids and Mutagenesis—HA-TTRAP-pcDNA3 plasmid was described previously (18Pype S. Declercq W. Ibrahimi A. Michiels C. Van Rietschoten J.G. Dewulf N. de Boer M. Vandenabeele P. Huylebroeck D. Remacle J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18586-18593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). HA-TTRAP SUMO-binding mutants were generated with site-directed mutagenesis by PCR using QuikChange (Stratagene). HA-TTRAP SIM mutant was constructed using the primer pair 5′-TTACCCAACAACGCTGCGGATGTCTGGGAGTTTTTG-3′ and 5′-CAAAAACTCCCAGACATCCGCAGCGTTGTTGGGTAA-3′ introducing two alanines and primer pair 5′-CCCAACAACGCTGCGGCTGCCTGGGAGTTTTTGGGCAAA-3′ and 5′-TTTGCCCAAAAACTCCCAGGCAGCCGCAGCGTTGTTGGG-3′ to introduce two further alanines. GST-SUMO2 and YFP-UBC9 were kindly provided by Frauke Melchior and FLAG-PIAS1, GST-SUMO1, and FLAG-PIAS2 (PIASxα) by Jorma Palvimo. GST-TTRAP was generously provided by Danny Huylebroeck.Acidic deletion mutants were constructed using site-directed mutagenesis. Sequences of the primers are available upon request. FLAG-PIAS3 was kindly provided by Helene Boeuf and FLAG-Sp100 and EGFP-Sp100 by Hans Will.Cell Culture and Transfections, Cell Lysis, GST Pulldown, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blot—All these techniques were done as described before (19Haglund K. Ivankovic-Dikic I. Shimokawa N. Kruh G.D. Dikic I. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2557-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The HA antibody was used from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, FLAG M2 antibody form Sigma and GFP/YFP antibody form BD Bioscience.Protein Expression and Purification for NMR Studies—Full-length SUMO1 and SUMO2 were cloned as GST fusions into pET-41a vectors (Novagen), expressed in bacteria on either LB medium (for non-marked protein) or minimal medium with 15NH4Cl and [13C6]glucose for labeled protein. The recombinant protein was purified on a GSH resin (Amersham Biosciences) according to manufacturer's instruction and cleaved with thrombin, leaving the extension Gly-Ser in N-term of the full length SUMO; concentrators (Amicon) were used for tag removal and concentration. The protein was lyophilyzed and stored at –20 °C.NMR Spectra Acquisition and Assignment—All measurements were made at 27 °C in 25 mm Phosphate buffer at pH 7. Triple resonance and two-dimensional experiments were performed on a Varian Inova 600 equipped with shielded Z gradients. Three-dimensional NMR spectra were processed using the standard Bruker software XWINNMR. Two-dimensional NMR spectra were processed using NMRpipe (42Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11379) Google Scholar). Analysis and visual representation of two-dimensional spectra were performed using Sparky (T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, University of California, San Francisco), and three-dimensional spectra were analyzed with the program Aurelia (Bruker). Assignment of SUMO2 was generated using the spectra HNCA, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HC(CO)NH, and C(CO)NH.NMR Titration Experiments—For peptide titration experiments heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra were performed on 15N-labeled SUMO1 or SUMO2 (300 mm in 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7). Unlabeled peptides were chemically synthetized by Thermo Electron GmbH, dissolved to a concentration of 2.7 mm in 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7, and titrated to the protein to reach a final peptide:SUMO ratio of 1.36:1. No precipitation could be observed even at the highest peptide concentrations. KD values were measured by two different methods, depending on the exchange regime. For amino acids in fast exchange regime, at each titration step, the distance of each peak from its original position was measured using the normalization proposed before (20Ayed A. Mulder F.A. Yi G.S. Lu Y. Kay L.E. Arrowsmith C.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The obtained curves were fitted to a Hill 4-parameter model using the software SigmaPlot.Bioinformatical Analysis—All sequence data base searches were performed with a non-redundant data set constructed from current releases of Swiss-Prot, TrEMBL, and GenPept (21Bairoch A. Apweiler R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 22Benton D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1517-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Generalized profile construction (23Bucher P. Karplus K. Moeri N. Hofmann K. Comput. Chem. 1996; 20: 3-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and searches were run locally using the pftools package, version 2.1. Generalized profiles were constructed using the BLOSUM45 substitution matrix (24Henikoff S. Henikoff J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10915-10919Crossref PubMed Scopus (4266) Google Scholar) and default penalties of 2.1 for gap opening and 0.2 for gap extension. The statistical significance of profile matches was derived from the analysis of the score distribution of a randomized data base (25Hofmann K. Brief Bioinform. 2000; 1: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Tryptic Digestion of PIAS and Detection of the Resulting Fragments by MALDI Spectrometry—HEK 293T cells were transfected with FLAG-PIAS and lysed, and the FLAG-PIAS expression was checked with Western blot analysis as described before. Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-PIAS was done with M2-agarose from Sigma according to manual instruction. Immunoprecipitated PIAS was loaded on SDS-PAGE gel and stained with Coomassie. The band containing PIAS was cut out of the gel and transferred into a microtube. As a negative control, a same sized bit of the gel cut from a region containing no protein and further handled as the probe. Except the digestion itself, all further steps were performed at room temperature under agitation (1000 rpm). The band was destained overnight using 0.5 ml of acetic acid/methanol/water 1:2:7 (v:v:v). It was washed for 4 h with water, dried with a SpeedVac, washed with (50% acetonitrile, 50% 0.2 m NH4HCO3 in water, pH 8.9), and dried with a SpeedVac again. The band was soaked with 15 μl of 0.2 m NH4HCO3 in water, pH 8.9, containing 33 μg·ml–1 trypsin proteomic grade (Sigma). The gel was reduced into little bits using the heat-rounded tip of a pasteur pipette and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The bits were washed with water for 2 h, dried with a SpeedVac, and covered with 50 μl of formic acid/water/isopropanol 1:3:2 (v:v:v) saturated with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. After overnight incubation, tubes were opened to allow crytallisation of the α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid together with the extracted peptides. The obtained solution was pipetted onto the MALDI plate avoiding to pipette gel bits. Measurements were made in reflector-positive mode, low mass gate set at 500 Da, and monitoring the 1–3-kDa range.RESULTSIdentification of SUMO1- and SUMO2-interacting Partners—To identify proteins that non-covalently bind to SUMO1 and SUMO2, we fused SUMO1 and SUMO2 mutants lacking two C-terminal glycine residues to the Gal4-DNA-binding domain of the YTH9 bait vector and performed large scale yeast two-hybrid screens using human thymus, spleen, and kidney libraries. After retransformation and X-gal tests we sequenced 102 SUMO1-interacting and 77 SUMO2-interacting partners. In this collection, we subsequently identified about 20 different candidate SUMO-interacting proteins, including SUMO-conjugating enzyme (UBC9), thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG), TOPORS, four members of the PIAS family, and RanBP2, which have been previously shown to interact with SUMO1 or SUMO2 (13Minty A. Dumont X. Kaghad M. Caput D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36316-36323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 14Song J. Durrin L.K. Wilkinson T.A. Krontiris T.G. Chen Y.

Cell Res. 2003; 290: 13-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Altogether, we identified 10 new candidate SUMO-interacting proteins for which no data about sumoylation or SUMO interaction are available (Fig. 1A). Among these proteins there were several zinc finger-containing proteins including ZCCHC7, ZCCHC12, ZNF237, ZNF198, and ZHX1 involved in different processes like DNA repair or transcriptional repression (27Kunapuli P. Somerville R. Still I.H. Cowell J.K. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3417-3423Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 28Shou Z. Yamada K. Kawata H. Yokoyama O. Miyamoto K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 314: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Moreover, Senataxin, a newly identified helicase mutated in patients suffering from ataxia-ocular apraxia 2, was found to interact with SUMO proteins in our screens (29Moreira M.C. Klur S. Watanabe M. Nemeth A.H. Le Ber I. Moniz J.C. Tranchant C. Aubourg P. Tazir M. Schols L. Pandolfo M. Schulz J.B. Pouget J. Calvas P. Shizuka-Ikeda M. Shoji M. Tanaka M. Izatt L. Shaw C.E. M'Zahem A. Dunne E. Bomont P. Benhassine T. Bouslam N. Stevanin G. Brice A. Guimaraes J. Mendonca P. Barbot C. Coutinho P. Sequeiros J. Durr A. Warter J.M. Koenig M. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 225-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). So far, two helicases, the BLM helicase and Werner's helicase, are known to be sumoylated and play important roles in causing hereditary diseases (30Eladad S. Ye T.Z. Hu P. Leversha M. Beresten S. Matunis M.J. Ellis N.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 1351-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 31Kawabe Y. Seki M. Seki T. Wang W.S. Imamura O. Furuichi Y. Saitoh H. Enomoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20963-20966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The findings of new SUMO-interacting partners underline the important function of SUMO signals during transcription, DNA repair, and chromatin remodeling (32Muller S. Ledl A. Schmidt D. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1998-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar).We next investigated whether these SUMO-interacting proteins bind preferentially to SUMO1 or SUMO2 in yeast cells. We retransformed all clones found to bind to SUMO1 in yeast expressing SUMO2 and in yeast expressing SUMO1 in parallel. The same was done for all the clones found to bind to SUMO2. As a control we transformed empty prey vector in yeast containing SUMO1 and SUMO2, while PIAS1, which was shown to interact strongly with SUMO1 and SUMO2, was transformed into the empty yeast strain. To compare the binding affinity to SUMO1 and SUMO2 we re-plated three different colonies of each retransformation on another agar plate with appropriate drop out medium. After 2 days yeast was transferred on a filter paper to compare the growth. Most of the retransformed SUMO-interacting partners bound to SUMO1 and SUMO2 with the same strength (Fig. 1B), whereas RanBP2 preferentially bound to SUMO1, an interaction that was already shown to be important for its function (33Tatham M.H. Kim S. Jaffray E. Song J. Chen Y. Hay R.T. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and TTRAP (TRAF and TNF receptor-associated protein), strongly bound to SUMO2 and poorly to SUMO1 (Fig. 1B). Nothing grew on the control plates. To compare binding affinities of SUMO1 and SUMO2 with SUMO3, we did in vitro pulldown assays for PIAS1, PIASxα, and UBC9 (Fig. 1C). As expected, SUMO3 bound with a similar affinity to these proteins as SUMO1 and SUMO2 did.Characterization of SUMO-interacting Motif in TTRAP—TTRAP was originally found as a protein interacting with members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R) superfamily as well as several TRAFs (18Pype S. Declercq W. Ibrahimi A. Michiels C. Van Rietschoten J.G. Dewulf N. de Boer M. Vandenabeele P. Huylebroeck D. Remacle J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18586-18593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Since TTRAP bound more potently to SUMO2 than SUMO1 in yeast (Fig. 1B), we analyzed the interactions between SUMO1 and SUMO2 with TTRAP in more details. When cell lysates expressing HA-TTRAP were incubated with beads coupled to GST, GST-SUMO1, GST-SUMO2, or GST-SUMO3, TTRAP bound more potently to SUMO2 and SUMO3 than to SUMO1 (Fig. 2, A and B). TTRAP did not contain one of the published SUMO-binding domains. However, we could find the sequence I-V-D-V at positions 280–284, which is the inversion of the proposed V/I-X-V/I-V/I SUMO-interacting motif (14Song J. Durrin L.K. Wilkinson T.A. Krontiris T.G. Chen Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14373-14378Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that this hydrophobic part could bind both parallel and antiparallel to SUMO so that these four amino acids could be a SUMO-binding domain as well (17Song J. Zhang Z. Hu W. Chen Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40122-40129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). We mutated all four amino acids to alanine (HA-TTRAP-SIM*) and completely abolished binding to all SUMO isoforms (Fig. 2B). Since these binding assays were performed in yeast and mammalian cells, they raised a concern whether additional cellular proteins might contribute to indirect binding between SUMO and TTRAP. To verify their interaction in vitro system, full-length TTRAP and TTRAP-SIM* were expressed and purified as a GST fusion protein in bacteria and challenged with recombinant SUMO2. As shown in Fig. 2C, SUMO2 bound to GST-TTRAP but not to GST alone or GST-TTRAP-SIM*. This result confirmed that the SIM of TTRAP directly interacts with SUMO2 and that this signature motif is essential for SUMO binding to full size TTRAP.FIGURE 2New SUMO-interacting motif in TTRAP. A, HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with wild type HA-TTRAP. Cell lysates were subsequently incubated with GST alone or GST-SUMO1/2/3. HA-TTRAP wild type binds strongly to SUMO2 and SUMO3 and weaker to SUMO1. Repetition of the GST pulldown assay with cells expressing a mutant of the potential SUMO-interacting motif (TTRAP-SIM*) revealed that binding to all SUMO isoforms can be abolished. Western blots were performed with anti-HA antibodies. Levels of GST fusion proteins were determined by Ponceau staining. TCL, total cell lysate; aa, amino acids. B, GST pulldowns of purified SUMO2 with GST, GST-TTRAP, and GST-TTRAP-SIM* detected by Ponceau S staining to analyze direct interaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Definition of a Universal SIM—Three different amino acid signature motifs have been proposed to mediate binding to SUMO (Fig. 3A). To identify minimal SIMs in newly cloned SUMO-interacting proteins, the sequences of the clones were subjected to bioinformatical analyses. All of the three proposed sequence motifs implicated in binding to SUMO are represented in both known and new SUMO-interacting partners pooled in our screens (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, several SUMO-interacting partners contain two SUMO-binding domains. Some SUMO-interacting partners, including TTRAP, MCAF, and ZCCHC12, do not contain the complete characteristics of any of the published domains but rather represent the inversion of motif 2 (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3Definition of universal SIM. A, three published SUMO-binding motifs: “h” represents a hydrophobic amino acid and “a” an acidic one. B, summary of the clones found in all screens, their Swiss-Prot IDs, and their names and strength of interaction to SUMO1 and SUMO2 in the screen are shown. Some SUMO-interacting partners like TTRAP, MCAF, and ZCCHC12 do not contain one of the published domains. C, alignment of SUMO-interacting motifs of the yeast clones. All motifs contain a hydrophobic core (blue), acidic amino acids (red), and/or potential phosphorylation sites (brown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)An alignment of all SUMO-interacting motifs revealed that they all harbored a hydrophobic core sequence consisting of stretches of three or four hydrophobic Ile, Leu, or Val residues plus one acidic/polar residue at position 2 or 3. The sequences surrounding this core-binding domain are predicted to be disordered and have a net negative charge due to a stretch of acidic amino acid residues (Fig. 3C). The stretch of acidic amino acids can be either at the C- or at the N-terminal site of the hydrophobic core. Furthermore, a spacer containing a conserved threonine can separate the hydrophobic part from the acidic one. Interestingly, the majority of SIMs contains one or more serines or threonines, being potential phosphorylation sites in vivo.Biophysical Parameters Underlying Binding of SIMs to Different SUMO Paralogues—We used NMR spectroscopy to gain detailed insights into the binding of different SIM motifs to SUMO1 or SUMO2. In typical NMR titrations, binding of a ligand to a protein influences the environment of the atoms of the protein, especially in the binding interface between the protein and the ligand. Such perturbations are easily observable as modification of the frequency and intensity of resonances in HSQC spectra during a titration experiment. We used the already published assignment of SUMO1 (34Macauley M.S. Errington W.J. Okon M. Scharpf M. Mackereth C.D. Schulman B.A. McIntosh L.P. J. Biol.

We also analyzed the SIM of TTRAP, which interacts predominantly with SUMO2 in vivo and in vitro experiments and lacks the acidic tract. Thus, three different PIASxα peptides and one TTRAP peptide were synthesized to investigate the binding characteristics of SUMO1 and SUMO2 to these peptides (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. 2).FIGURE 4Binding surface analysis.

M., and Wood, N. W. (2004) Brain 127, 2385-2405). Here we demonstrate that the accumulation of mutant Huntingtin is highly sensitive to the expression of beclin 1, a gene essential for autophagy. Moreover, we show that the accumulated mutant Huntingtin recruits Beclin 1 and impairs the Beclin 1-mediated long lived protein turnover. Thus, sequestration of Beclin 1 in the vulnerable neuronal population of Huntington disease patients might further reduce Beclin 1 function and autophagic degradation of mutant Huntingtin. Finally, we demonstrate that the expression of beclin 1 decreases in an age-dependent fashion in human brains.

Wood N.W. Brain. 2004; 127: 2385-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The gene involved in HD (HD) encodes a 350-kDa protein, named Huntingtin (Htt), that may function as a giant scaffold for organizing signaling complexes (4MacDonald M.E. Sci. STKE 2003. 2003; : Pe48Google Scholar). The HD gene contains a highly polymorphic CAG repeat: the number of CAG copies ranges from 10 to 35 in unaffected individuals but exceeds 36 in patients with HD. The expansion of CAG repeat in the mutant HD gene results in an extended polyglutamine (poly(Q)) stretch at the N terminus of the Htt protein. Expansion of the poly(Q) in Htt beyond 36 has complete penetrance in development of the disease. HD is characterized by the onset of progressive chorea, psychiatric symptoms, and dementia in early- to mid-adult life, which then follows a relentlessly downhill course with death usually occurring 12-15 years after the appearance of initial symptoms. Currently it is not clear what triggers the onset of HD, nor is there any effective treatment for this devastating disease. Although the mechanism of neurotoxicity mediated by expanded poly(Q) is still highly controversial, it has been well established that expanded poly(Q) provokes a dominant gain-of-function neurotoxicity. The accumulation of expanded poly(Q)-containing proteins is a hallmark of HD as well as other poly(Q) expansion diseases (5Becher M.W. Kotzuk J.A. Sharp A.H. Davies S.W. Bates G.P. Price D.L.

Accumulated truncated forms of Htt containing the N-terminal expanded poly(Q) are most easily recognized as neuronal inclusions (5Becher M.W. Kotzuk J.A. Sharp A.H. Davies S.W. Bates G.P. Price D.L.

Treatment with Congo Red and trehalose, both of which reduce the accumulation of overexpressed expanded poly(Q)-positive proteins and increase the rate of their degradation, alleviated neuropathological findings and neurological symptoms in HD transgenic mouse models (8Sanchez I. Mahlke C. Yuan J. Nature. 2003; 421: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 9Tanaka M. Machida Y. Niu S. Ikeda T. Jana N.R. Doi H. Kurosawa M. Nekooki M. Nukina N. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). These results stress the importance of understanding the mechanism that regulates the turnover of proteins with expanded poly(Q). Although neuronal Htt-N-terminal product inclusions are highly ubiquitinated, recent studies demonstrated that poly(Q) is a poor substrate for the eukaryotic proteasome (10Venkatraman P. Wetzel R. Tanaka M. Nukina N. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 95-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Thus, the highly ubiquitinated state of Htt inclusions may indicate the inability of the proteasomes in affected neurons to clear such abnormal truncated Htt proteins. On the other hand, there is pharmacological evidence to suggest the role of autophagy, a large scale catabolic mechanism, in regulating the degradation of the N-terminal part of Htt. The addition of 3-methyladenine, an inhibitor of Class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and autophagy, has been shown to increase aggregate formation in x57 cells, a cell line derived from mouse striatal neurons, upon transfection with Htt-N-terminal products with expanded poly(Q) (11Qin Z.H. Wang Y. Kegel K.B. Kazantsev A. Apostol B.L. Thompson L.M. Yoder J. Aronin N. DiFiglia M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 3231-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Rapamycin, an inducer of autophagy, has been shown to reduce the aggregation of expanded poly(Q) polypeptides in transfected cells (12Ravikumar B. Duden R. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar), protect against neurodegeneration in a fly poly(Q) peptide model of HD, improve the performance on behavioral tests, and decrease aggregate formation in a mouse transgenic N-terminal fragment model of HD (13Ravikumar B. Vacher C. Berger Z. Davies J.E. Luo S. Oroz L.G. Scaravilli F. Easton D.F. Duden R. O'Kane C.J. Rubinsztein D.C. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (1990) Google Scholar). These results support a possible role of autophagy in regulating the turnover of expanded poly(Q) proteins. We still do not understand, however, the one or more molecular mechanisms that mediate the turnover of expanded poly(Q) proteins or whether a defect in such mechanism(s) might contribute to the age-dependent accumulation of Htt species. Autophagy is an intracellular catabolic mechanism that mediates the degradation of large protein complexes and damaged organelles in a lysosome-dependent fashion (14Levine B. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 463-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar, 15Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Matsui M. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. Mol. Biol.

Although several forms of autophagy have been described, macroautophagy (referred to simply as ‘autophagy’ hereafter) is best studied. The hallmark of autophagy is the formation of a double-membrane cytosolic vesicle, the autophagosome, which sequesters cytoplasm and delivers it to the lysosomes for degradation (14Levine B. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 463-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar). Elegant genetic studies have identified the genes and delineated pathways that regulate autophagy in yeast (17Klionsly D.J. Emr S.D. Science. 2000; 290: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (2988) Google Scholar), although our knowledge of autophagy mechanisms in mammalian cells remains scanty (15Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Matsui M. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar, 16Shintani T. Klionsky D.J. Science. 2004; 306: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (2180) Google Scholar). Beclin 1 is a mammalian ortholog of Atg6/Vps30, a component of the Class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex in yeast that is essential for the formation of autophagosomes and cytosol-to-vacuole vesicles (18Kametaka S. Okano T. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22284-22291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Beclin 1 deficiency leads to impaired autophagy function in mammalian cells (2Qu X. Yu J. Bhagat G. Furuya N. Hibshoosh H. Troxel A. Rosen J. Eskelinen E.L. Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Cattoretti G. Levine B. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1809-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar, 3Yue Z. Jin S. Yang C. Levine A.J. Heintz N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1999; 402: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (2752) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the beclin 1 gene is mono-allelically deleted in 40-75% of sporadic human breast and ovarian cancers (19Liang X.H. Jackson S. Seaman M. Brown K. Kempkes B. Hibshoosh H. Levine B. Nature. 1999; 402: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (2752) Google Scholar), and heterozygous beclin 1 mutant mice have increased spontaneous tumorigenesis (2Qu X. Yu J. Bhagat G. Furuya N. Hibshoosh H.

Heintz N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15077-15082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1780) Google Scholar). Thus, the beclin 1 gene encodes a haploid-insufficient tumor suppressor. In this study, we show that the intracellular accumulation of Htt with expanded poly(Q) is highly sensitive to the expression levels of beclin 1. We show an age-dependent decline of beclin 1 expression in human brains that might provide a mechanism for the accumulation of expanded poly(Q) species, perhaps contributing to the disease onset and disease progression of poly(Q) expansion diseases, including HD. Furthermore, we show that Beclin 1 is recruited to Htt inclusions in the R6/2 mouse brain and in the striatal samples of human HD patients. Thus, sequestration of Beclin 1 in the vulnerable neuronal population of HD patients might further reduce Beclin 1 function and autophagic degradation of expanded poly(Q)-containing Htt. Our study suggests a potentially important role of Beclin 1 in both the initiation and progression of HD. Antibodies—The commercial sources of antibodies were as follows: mouse monoclonal anti-HA (HA.11, Covance), mouse monoclonal anti-γ-adaptin (BD Biosciences), 1C2 (Chemicon), and mouse monoclonal anti-Htt antibody (MAB2166, Chemicon). Beclin 1 Expression Analysis for Human Brain Samples—The detailed protocols for DNA microarray analysis and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR are described elsewhere (38Lu T. Pan Y. Kao S.Y. Li C. Kohane I. Chan J. Yankner B.A. Nature. 2004; 429: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, brain tissues samples were homogenized with a glass Dounce tissue grinder (Kontes) in RIPA-deoxycholate buffer (50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) as well as phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF, 5 mm Na2P2O7, 1 mm NaVO4, and 1 μm microcysteine). RNA Interference—The following DNA sequences in the cDNAs of human and murine Beclin 1 were used to produce double-stranded RNAs with a 3′-overhang: human Beclin 1, 5′-tgaggatgacagtgaacag-3′; murine Beclin 1, 5′-cagtttggcacaatcaata-3′. In each case, the targeted sequence was separated from its reverse complement by a nine-nucleotide spacer (ttcaagaga) that served as the 3′-overhang. The constructs were annealed and inserted into the BglII and XhoI sites of pSRP retrovirus vector developed to express double-stranded RNAs bearing the 3′-overhang under the control of the H1 promoter. Pantropic retroviruses were made by transfecting 293T cells with each of the pSRP vectors harboring a Beclin 1 target sequence and plasmids containing the gag-pol-env constructs derived from Moloney leukemia virus. Virus-rich supernatants were used to infect cells, and infected cells were selected with puromycin (2-3 μg/ml). Immunohistochemistry and Western Blotting—8-week-old R6/2 and control mice (B6CBAF1/J) (Jackson Laboratory) were anesthetized with Forane (Abbott Laboratories) and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline for fixation. After cryoprotection with 20% sucrose/phosphate-buffered saline, 15-μm-thick frozen sections were prepared. Paraffin-embedded striatal sections (thickness: 10 μm) were obtained from normal controls (n = 3; ages: 87.7 ± 1.5 (mean ± S.D.) years old; post-mortem periods: 25.0 ± 20.1 h) and HD patients (n = 5; ages: 44.6 ± 23.2 years old; post-mortem periods: 20.8 ± 16.8 h). Single immunostaining for Htt and Beclin 1 was performed using a Vectastain Elite ABC Kit (Vector Laboratories). Counterstaining was performed with 0.2% methyl green. For immunofluorescence double staining, EM48 and the rabbit polyclonal anti-Beclin 1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used as primary antibodies, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody and rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used as secondary antibodies. For Western blotting, frozen human striatal tissue was homogenized in 7 volumes of 1% Triton X-100 buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors). The homogenates were cleared by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 15 min), and the supernatants were boiled after the addition of the sample buffer. Long Lived Protein Degradation Assay—Cells were cultured with l-[3H]leucine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 24 h and chased in media with nonradioactive leucine for another 24 h. Then the media was changed again and incubated for 4 more hours. The media were recovered and treated with 10% trichloroacetic acid to separate trichloroacetic acid-soluble (amino acids) and trichloroacetic acid-insoluble (proteins) fractions. The cells were completely dissolved with 0.2 n NaOH. Radioactivity was measured with a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman). Long lived protein degradation was calculated by dividing trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity in the media by total radioactivity detected in the cells and media. The values were expressed as changes in -fold from the value obtained in normal control cells. Intracellular Accumulation of Mutant Htt Is Sensitive to the Levels of Beclin 1—To examine a possible role of Beclin 1 in regulating intracellular accumulation of Htt, we designed a hairpin siRNA to specifically reduce the expression of beclin 1 (Becn1 siRNA) in a pair of striatal cell lines, STHdhQ7/Q7 (ST Q7/Q7) and STHdhQ111/Q111 (ST Q111/Q111). STHdhQ7/Q7 (ST Q7/Q7) cells were derived from the striatal primordia of mice that were WT for HdhQ7/Q7, encoding endogenous murine huntingtin with 7-glutamines; whereas STHdhQ111/Q111 (ST Q111/Q111) cells are homozygous for a CAG repeat knock-in mutant allele HdhQ111/Q111, which extends the poly(Q) segment of endogenous murine huntingtin to 111 residues (20Trettel F. Rigamonti D. Hilditch-Maguire P. Wheeler V.C. Sharp A.H. Persichetti F. Cattaneo E. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2799-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that the endogenous mouse Htt Q7 protein in ST Q7/Q7 cells and the endogenous mutant Htt Q111 protein in ST Q111/Q111 cells are both soluble proteins (>350 kDa), except that the expanded poly(Q) tract in the Htt Q111 protein confers reduced mobility compared with the Htt Q7 protein on SDS-PAGE (20Trettel F. Rigamonti D. Hilditch-Maguire P. Wheeler V.C. Sharp A.H. Persichetti F. Cattaneo E. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2799-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Expression of Becn1 siRNA resulted in the reduction of Beclin 1 protein in both ST Q7/Q7 (18.8%) and ST Q111/Q111 cells (29.8%) as demonstrated by Western blotting followed by densitometric analysis (Fig. 1A). No effect of Becn1 knock down (KD) on the cell growth or gross morphology was detected (data not shown). Interestingly, Becn1 KD in ST Q111/Q111 cells led to a significant increase in the levels of Htt Q111 and the appearance of Htt Q111 species that migrated much slower as a smear-like immunoreactivity on SDS-PAGE, the latter of which suggested the formation of oligomeric Htt (Fig. 1A). In comparison, the reduction of beclin 1 expression in ST Q7/Q7 cells did not cause the appearance of such smear-like immunoreactivity of WT Q7 Htt protein (Fig. 1A). This result indicates that the reduction of beclin 1 expression led to the accumulation of Htt with expanded poly(Q). The slower migrating species of Htt in Q111/Q111 Becn1 KD cells, however, did not form aggregates visible by immunocytochemistry (data not shown). Thus, a reduction of beclin 1 expression in Q111/Q111 cells leads to the formation of slower migrating Htt Q111 species on SDS-PAGE but not large aggregates. To ask whether the accumulation of expanded poly(Q) in Q111/Q111 cells is caused by a reduction of poly(Q) turnover, we measured the rate of Htt turnover in both Q7/Q7 and Q111/Q111 cells using a pulse-chase assay (Fig. 1B). In control vector-infected Q7/Q7 and Q111/Q111 cells, the levels of labeled Htt were significantly reduced as compared with the baseline level (0 h) after chasing for 24 h but not after 4 h (Q7: 91.8 ± 9.4% at 4 h, 51.0 ± 31.8% at 24 h; Q111: 86.2 ± 8.3% at 4 h, 44.4 ± 4.4% at 24 h, mean ± S.D.%; Fig. 1B). In Becn1 KD Q7/Q7 cells, there was a time-dependent reduction of labeled Htt (72.9 ± 29.6% at 4 h, 35.2 ± 12.0% at 24 h; Fig. 1B). On the other hand, the levels of labeled mutant Htt in Becn1 KD Q111/Q111 cells after chasing for 24 h were not changed significantly compared with that of 4 h (70.2 ± 7.6% at 4 h, 79.1 ± 12.4% at 24 h; Fig. 1B). The difference in labeled Htt band intensities at 24 h between Q7/Q7 and Q111/Q111 was statistically significant in Becn1 KD cells (p < 0.05, t test). This finding suggests that Beclin 1-mediated long lived protein degradation pathway plays a critical role in the catabolism of mutant Htt. To explore the mechanism by which Beclin 1 reduces the intracellular accumulation of mutant Htt with poly(Q), we chose the human neuroglioma-derived H4 cells, because they are more amenable to manipulation than the striatal cell lines. To validate the use of H4 cells as a system to characterize the mechanism of Beclin 1 in regulating the intracellular levels of Htt, we first determined if overexpression of beclin 1 might cause changes in poly(Q) aggregation, as predicted by the results from the striatal cell lines described above. We compared the accumulation of insoluble aggregates in H4 cells transfected with expression vectors of Q79 and Q35 (21Ikeda H. Yamaguchi M. Sugai S. Axe Y. Narumiya S. Kakizuka A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) with or without that of beclin 1 (Fig. 1C). Q35 was identified as a 15-kDa single band present exclusively in the RIPA-soluble fraction, whereas most of Q79 was present in the RIPA-insoluble fraction, with a small portion migrating at 32 kDa and in the stacking gel in the RIPA-soluble fraction, consistent with the aberrant behavior of Q79 (Fig. 1C) (21Ikeda H. Yamaguchi M. Sugai S. Axe Y. Narumiya S. Kakizuka A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Overexpression of beclin 1 led to a significant reduction of Q79 in the RIPA-insoluble fraction, whereas it had no effect on the levels of soluble Q79 (Fig. 1C). To examine the effect of reducing beclin 1 expression on the accumulation of insoluble poly(Q), we developed an siRNA retroviral vector (pSRP-Beclin 1) for human Beclin 1. pSRP-Beclin 1 specifically reduced the expression of beclin 1, whereas it had no effect on the expression level of human gsa7/atg7 (Fig. 1D), a gene also involved in the execution of autophagy (22Tanida I. Tanida-Miyake E. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1701-1706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). An increased amount of RIPA-insoluble Q79 accumulated in Becn1 KD H4 cells versus control cells (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, the reduction of beclin 1 expression in H4 cells also increased the amount of insoluble (P fraction) N-terminal truncated (amino acids 1-171) Htt with Q68 (Htt 171-Q68), which was present in the RIPA-soluble fraction in control H4 cells, and became partly RIPA-insoluble in Becn1 KD H4 cells (Fig. 1F). To examine if a reduction in the solubility of expanded poly(Q) in Becn1 KD H4 cells was reflected in an increase in the formation of poly(Q) aggregates visible by immunocytochemistry, we transfected the expression vectors for Q79 and Htt 171-Q68 into control and Becn1 KD H4 cells. The poly(Q) aggregates were visualized by immunostaining using anti-HA (Fig. 1G). In these cellular models, the poly(Q) aggregates were found in both the cytoplasm (∼50%) and nuclei (∼50%). We counted the percentages of cells with visible aggregates. The number of Q79 aggregates was significantly increased in Becn1 KD H4 cells in comparison with the control H4 cells (39.8 ± 9.6 (mean ± S.D.)% in Becn1 KD versus 23.1 ± 4.1% in control). Furthermore, while Htt 171-Q68 formed relatively few aggregates in control H4 cells, nearly double the number of Htt 171-Q68-aggregates was observed in Becn1 KD H4 cells (22.1 ± 2.5% in Becn1 KD versus 12.1 ± 5.2% in control). These results suggest that Beclin 1 plays an important role in regulating the accumulation of proteins with expanded poly(Q) in H4 cells as well as in the striatal cell lines, providing a validation for the use of H4 cells as a model to explore the mechanism by which Beclin 1 regulates the accumulation of expanded poly(Q). The Bcl-2-interacting Domain of Beclin 1 Is Not Required for Reducing the Level of Expanded Poly(Q) Aggregates—To explore the mechanism by which Beclin 1 reduces the accumulation of expanded poly(Q) aggregation, we characterized the domains of Beclin 1 that might be important for this function. Beclin 1 was identified as a Bcl-2-interacting protein (23Liang X.H. Kleeman L.K. Jiang H.H. Gordon G. Goldman J.E. Berry G. Herman B. Levine B. J. Viol. 1998; 72: 8586-8596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Beclin 1 contains a Bcl-2-interacting domain (Bcl-2 ID) and a coiled-coil domain. We constructed expression vectors for three Beclin 1 mutants, a C-terminal truncation containing amino acids 1-270 (Bec1-270), a Bcl-2-interacting domain (ΔBcl-2 ID) deletion mutant, and a Bcl-2 ID-coiled-coil domain deletion mutant (Fig. 2A). The Bcl-2 ID-coiled-coil deletion mutant could not be expressed in H4 cells, rendering further analysis of this mutant impossible. The effects of WT and mutant Beclin 1 proteins were compared in H4 cells cotransfected with Q79 expression vector and one of the other beclin 1 expression vectors by measuring the levels of insoluble Q79 in the stacking gel and in a filter retardation assay (24Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Turmaine M. Mangiarini L. Hollenbech B. Hasenbank R. Bates B.P. Davies S.W. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the N-terminal half of Beclin 1 (Bec1-270) failed to have any impact on the accumulation of Q79 (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, the deletion of Bcl-2-interaction domain retained the ability to reduce the insoluble poly(Q) accumulation. The effects of WT Beclin 1, Bec1-270 Beclin 1, and ΔBcl-2 ID Beclin 1 were further verified by immunostaining for Q79 aggregates. The expression of WT Beclin 1 and ΔBcl-2 ID Beclin 1 but not Bec1-270 Beclin 1 reduced the proportion of Q79-GFP aggregate-positive cells (Fig. 2, C and D). These results suggest that the activity of Beclin 1 in reducing the accumulation of expanded poly(Q) requires the C-terminal half of the protein (amino acids 271-450) but not the Bcl-2-interacting domain. Beclin 1 Reduces the Levels of Expanded Poly(Q) by Promoting Autophagy—To exclude the possibility that the reduction in the intracellular accumulation of Q79 promoted by Beclin 1 might be in part due to the proteasome activity, we created a Q79 mutant (Q79 Lys-) that had its two Lys residues converted into Arg residues (Q79 K17R/K21R). Overexpression of beclin 1 was still fully active in reducing the insoluble aggregates of Lys-Q79 as for those of Lys+ Q79 (Fig. 3A). Because Lys residues are required for ubiquitination, this result suggests that Beclin 1 regulates the turnover of mutant Htt through an ubiquitination-independent pathway.FIGURE 3Intracellular accumulation of poly(Q) is sensitive to the levels of degradative autophagic function. A, H4 cells were transfected with a vector expressing Q79 Lys-with or without the wild-type Beclin 1 expression vector. The cells were processed for Western blotting (left) and filter retardation assay (right) using anti-HA to evaluate insoluble Q79 protein accumulation. The expression levels of Beclin 1 were evaluated by Western blotting. B, H4 cells were transfected with expression vectors of Q79 with or without Beclin 1 in thepresence or absence of 10 μm pepstatin A for 6 h before fixation. 48 h after transfection, the cells were processed for immunostaining using anti-HA. The numbers of cells bearing intracellular Q79 aggregates were counted, and expressed as mean ± S.D. % of total cells. The cell counting was performed in five different visual fields for each group. Statistical analysis was carried out by analysis of variance and Scheffe's post hoc tests. The expression levels of Beclin 1 were shown by Western blotting. C, cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting (left) and filter retardation assay (right) using anti-HA. The expression levels of Beclin 1 were evaluated by Western blotting. D, effects of beclin 1 expression levels on long lived protein degradation. The rates of long lived protein turnover in H4 cells treated with 3-methyladenine (10 mm), rapamycin (Rap.,1 μm), stable Beclin 1 knockdown H4 cells (Becn1 KD), and H4 cells stably overexpressing HA-tagged Beclin 1 (Becn1 ST). The values were expressed as changes in -fold from the values obtained in normal control cells. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance followed by Fisher's PLSD (protected least significant difference). The data were obtained from at least three independent experiments. E, reduction of beclin 1 expression reduced GFP-LC3-positive autophagic vesicles. Control pSRP retrovirus-infected H4 cells and Becn1 KD H4 cells were transfected with GFP-LC3 for 24 h and then stimulated by rapamycin (1 μm) or vehicle control for 4 h and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Cell counting procedures were carried out from three independent fields in each of two different experiments. F, reduction of beclin 1 expression inhibits LC3-II formation induced by rapamycin. Control pSRP retrovirus-infected H4 cells and Becn1 KD H4 cells were stimulated by rapamycin for 4 h, and a Western blot of the cell lysates was probed with anti-LC3. Anti-β-tubulin was used as a control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We reasoned if the ability of Beclin 1 to promote the turnover of mutant Htt is mediated through autophagy, its activity"

A cluster analysis of the proteases based on the complete specificity profile provided a functional characterization distinct from standard sequence analysis. This approach provides useful information for developing selective chemical probes to study protease-related pathologies and physiologies. Proteases hydrolyze amide bonds in proteins and peptides and represent one of the largest and most important protein families known. They comprise over 2% of the human genome and play diverse physiological roles (merops.sanger.ac.uk) (1Rawlings N.D. Tolle D.P. Barrett A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D160-D164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of a protease enables the enzyme to preferentially cleave its substrates in the presence of other peptides or proteins. Therefore, specificity information can provide clues about the biological function of the protease and aid in the design of efficient substrates and potent, selective inhibitors. Various methods including both biological and chemical-based approaches to study protease specificity have been developed and were recently reviewed (2Marnett A.B. Craik C.S. Trends Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 59-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Positional scanning synthetic combinatorial libraries (PS-SCLs) 2The abbreviations used are: PS-SCL, positional scanning synthetic combinatorial libraries; ACC, 7-amino-4-carbamoylmethylcoumarin; DMF, N,N-dimethyl formamide; DICI, diisopropylcarbodiimide; HOBt, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole; Ac, acetyl; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; AMC, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; AOMK, acyloxylmethyl ketone; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl. of fluorogenic substrates have emerged as useful reagents for the rapid and exhaustive determination of protease specificity (3Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar). A peptide-based PS-SCL is composed of sublibraries in which one peptide position is fixed with an amino acid, whereas the remaining positions contain an equimolar mixture of amino acids. Assaying proteases with these sublibraries rapidly establishes the amino acid preferences at the defined position. Initially, the substrate specificities of caspases and granzyme B were profiled using PS-SCLs with the P1 position fixed as an aspartic acid. The limitations of the original P1 fixed libraries were overcome through the development of a modified coumarin, 7-amino-4-carbamoylmethylcoumarin (ACC) fluorogenic leaving group. The bifunctional nature of this enables straightforward solid-phase synthesis of libraries containing any amino acid at the P1 position. Early applications involved the use of a P1-diverse PS-SCL in combination with several P1-fixed PS-SCLs to study P1 and P2-P3-P4 specificity, respectively (4Harris J.L. Backes B.J. Leonetti F.

This library permits the determination of P1-P2-P3-P4 specificity of proteases regardless of their P1 specificity. Using this complete diverse library, numerous proteases from various sources including humans, parasites, bacteria, and viruses have been profiled. As a representative family, we present a study of the substrate specificity of papain-like cysteine proteases. The papain-like cysteine proteases, which include plant enzymes papain and bromelain, human cysteine cathepsins (B, H, L, S, C, K, O, F, V, X, W), and parasite proteases cruzain and falcipains, have been characterized as key enzymes in many biological and pathological events (8Lecaille F. Kaleta J. Brömme D. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4459-4488Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 9Brömme D. Kaleta J. Curr. Pharm.

J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 1489-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). As a result, many of them represent particularly attractive drug targets. Of particular interest to these studies is cathepsin K, a cysteine protease implicated in osteoporosis and other diseases (12Brömme D. Okamoto K. Wang B.B. Biroc S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2126-2132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The substrate binding pocket of these proteases can be divided into seven substrate binding subsites, S4 to S3′, that interact with P4 to P3′ residues of substrates (13Berger A. Schechter I. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1970; 257: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis occurs at the scissile bond between P1 and P1′. Among these, S3 and S2′ subsites interact with substrates through only side chain contacts, and their interactions spread over a relatively wide area. In contrast, the S2, S1, and S1′ subsites involve both main chain and side chain contacts. These recognition properties in combination with the well conserved structure of the family result in broad and similar specificities for the papain-like proteases (14Turk D. Guncar G. Podobnik M. Turk B. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In this study, however, the complete diverse PS-SCL and the cluster analysis of the resulting specificity information have revealed distinctive differences between the members of this class. The utility of this library and the specificity information obtained using it is well exemplified by the development of specific ACC-based substrates and an acyloxymethyl ketone inhibitor for cathepsin K.

McKerrow, M. Sajid, and C. R. Caffrey. Rhodesain from Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, cruzain from Trypanosoma cruzi, a cathepsin L-like protease from Leishmania mexicana, and cathepsin B-like proteases 1 and 2 from Schistosoma mansoni were heterologously expressed and purified as described previously elsewhere (18Caffrey C.R.

Synthesis of the Complete Diverse Tetrapeptide-ACC PS-SCL—The preparation of ACC and P1-substituted ACC was carried out as described previously using an Argonaut Quest 210 organic synthesizer (4Harris J.L. Backes B.J. Leonetti F. Mahrus S. Ellman J.A. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7754-7759Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 20Backes B.J. Harris J.L. Leonetti F.

Chem. 2002; 67: 910-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The substitution level of the resin (0.63 mmol/g) was determined by a spectrophotometric Fmoc quantitative assay (22Bunin B.A. The Combinatorial Index. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 6Google Scholar). The synthesis of the library was performed using a MultiChem 96-well synthesis apparatus (Robbins Scientific). To prepare the P1 part of the P1 library, each of 20 Fmoc-amino acids (omitting cysteine and including norleucine) bound to ACC-resin (0.1 mmol) was added to the wells of the reaction apparatus. The use of norleucine in the amino acid pool is to increase the amount of information provided by the substrate specificity screen. Since norleucine contains the same number of carbons as leucine and isoleucine and has a similar unbranched chain structure as lysine, it provides additional information in probing the extended substrate specificity of proteases. For the P2, P3, and P4 libraries, an isokinetic mixture of 20 Fmoc-P1 amino acids bound to ACC-resin (2 mmol per each library) was prepared by shaking the slurry in DMF for 2 h (4Harris J.L. Backes B.J. Leonetti F. Mahrus S. Ellman J.A. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7754-7759Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 23Ostresh J.M. Winkle J.H. Hamashin V.T. Houghten R.A. Biopolymers. 1994; 34: 1681-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). After filtration, the resin was dried and then split in the wells of the reaction apparatus (0.1 mmol/well, 20 wells per each library). DMF was added to each well to solvate the Fmoc-P1 amino acid-ACC-resin, and gentle agitation for 30 min followed. To remove the Fmoc protection group, the DMF was drained, and a solution of 20% piperidine in DMF (4 ml/well) was added to the resin and agitated for 30 min. The piperidine solution was then removed by filtration, and the resin was thoroughly washed with DMF. To install P2 amino acids to the P2 library, 20 individual Fmoc-amino acids (10 eq, 1 mmol) were preactivated in separate vials using HOBt (10 eq, 1 mmol) and DICI (10 eq, 1 mmol) in DMF and added to the wells for the P2 library. To couple P2 amino acids to the P1, P3, and P4 libraries, an isokinetic mixture of the 20 Fmoc-amino acids (20 mmol per each library, 10 eq/well) was preactivated with HOBt (20 mmol) and DICI (20 mmol) in DMF. The solution was then added to each well for the P1, P3, and P4 libraries, and a 3-h agitation for coupling followed. When finished, the solution was drained, and the resin was thoroughly washed with DMF. The P3 and P4 positions were installed in the same manner except using 20 individual preactivated Fmoc-amino acids for the P3 position of the P3 library and for the P4 position of the P4 library, whereas a preactivated isokinetic mixture was used for the remaining positions. After the synthesis of the peptide portion was completed, the Fmoc blocking group of the P4 amino acids was removed, and the resin in each well, after washing with DMF, was treated with a capping solution consisting of AcOH (80 mmol), HOBt (80 mmol), and DICI (80 mmol) in DMF. After being agitated for 4 h, the resin was washed with DMF and then with CH2Cl2. The substrates were cleaved from the resin by treating for 1 h with a solution of trifluoroacetic acid:triisopropylsilane:H2O (95:2.5:2.5, 3 ml/well), and the collected material was lyophilized. The final products were dissolved in Me2SO to a concentration of 25 mm and stored at -20 °C until use. Synthesis of Individual Substrates and an Irreversible Inhibitor—The synthesis of individual peptide substrates was carried out using the same method employed for the complete diverse PS-SCL until the trifluoroacetic acid cleavage step. The peptide-ACC substrates cleaved from the resin were precipitated with t-butyl methyl ether. After any residual ether was evaporated, the resulting products were subjected to reverse phase preparatory HPLC (Rabbit HPLC with a Vydac C18 column, 0-95% CH3CN gradient with 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (Voyager, Applied Biosystems) was used to confirm the molecular weights of the purified substrates. The final purified substrates, after lyophilization, were dissolved in Me2SO and stored at -20 °C until use. An irreversible inhibitor, Ac-HGPR-acyloxylmethyl ketone (AOMK), was also designed based on the library assay results of cathepsin K and other cathepsins. The synthesis was carried out using conditions similar to those described elsewhere (24Wagner B.M. Smith R.A. Coles P.J. Copp L.J. Ernest M.J. Krantz A. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 1833-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 25Brömme D. Smith R.A. Coles P.J. Kirschke H. Storer A.C. Krantz A. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The inhibitor was purified, and its molecular weight was confirmed as described for the preparation of individual substrates. PS-SCL Assay—The cysteine proteases were assayed at 25 °C in a buffer containing 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Brij-35, and 1% Me2SO (from the substrates). Aliquots of 25 nmol in 1 μl from each of 20 sublibraries of the P1, P2, P3, and P4 libraries were added to the wells of a 96-well Microfluor-1 U-bottom plate (Dynex Technologies). The final concentration of each compound of the 8,000 compounds/well was 31.25 nm in 100-μl final reaction volume. The assays were initiated by the addition of preactivated enzyme and monitored fluorometrically with a Spectra-Max Gemini fluorescence spectrometer (Molecular Devices) with excitation at 380 nm, emission at 460 nm, and cutoff at 435 nm (4Harris J.L. Backes B.J. Leonetti F. Mahrus S. Ellman J.A. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7754-7759Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 23Ostresh J.M. Winkle J.H. Hamashin V.T. Houghten R.A. Biopolymers. 1994; 34: 1681-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The excitation and emission maxima of the peptide-conjugated ACC substrates are 325 and 400 nm, respectively. Cleavage of the substrate by a protease to release the free ACC results in a shift of the excitation and emission maxima to 350 and 450 nm, respectively. An excitation of 380 nm and an emission at 460 nm is used to maximize the signal of the ACC group over the background signal of the uncleaved substrate. In addition, the ACC fluorophore has an ∼2.8-fold higher fluorescence yield than AMC at the excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 and 460 nm. The enhanced fluorescence of the ACC group allows for the more sensitive detection of protease activity. Cluster Analysis of Specificity Data from the Complete Diverse PS-SCL Assays—To compare the specificity information with amino acid sequence information, the results from the library assays were clustered. First, the activity rates from the library assay were converted to values in a range from -1 to 1 by assigning a value of 1 to the amino acids that showed the strongest activity in each library (P1 to P4), whereas amino acids that showed no activity were assigned a value of -1. The results were analyzed with the program CLUSTER and displayed in a tree diagram by using TreeView (26Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13235) Google Scholar). The P1, P2, P3, and P4 specificities were clustered together to compare with the sequence alignment and also separately for more detailed comparison. The structure-based amino acid sequence alignment of active protease domains was performed using the CLUSTAL_W program (MacVector, Accelrys Inc.). The primary sequences were taken from the SWISS-PROT or GenBank™ databases. Kinetic Analysis of Individual Peptide-ACC Substrates and an Irreversible Inhibitor—Michaelis-Menten steady state kinetic analysis was used to determine the kinetic constants of each substrate and protease pair. The final concentration of substrates ranged from 0.25 μm to1mm, and the concentration of Me2SO in the assays was less than 2% (v/v). The concentrations of cathepsins K, L, and B were 20, 1.37, and 1 nm, respectively. All kinetic assays were performed at 25 °C in triplicate. The hydrolysis of ACC substrates was monitored fluorometrically using the assay conditions described for the complete diverse library assay. The Kaleidagraph program (Synergy software) and Equation 1 were used to analyze the results and calculate kcat, Km, and kcat/Km. v0=kcat[E]01+(Km/S0)(Eq. 1) Kinetic characterization of the inhibitor Ac-HGPR-AOMK was performed as described previously (18Caffrey C.R. Hansell E. Lucas K.D. Brinen L.S. Alvarez Hernandez A. Cheng J. Gwaltney II, S.L. Roush W.R. Stierhof Y.D. Bogyo M. Steverding D. McKerrow J.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 118: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Briefly, residual activity of human cathepsin K (20 nm), cathepsin L (1.37 nm), and cathepsin B (1 nm) were assayed with a synthetic substrate Z-FR-AMC (final 50 μm) under the complete diverse library assay conditions. Values for the pseudo-first-order rate constant kobs at each concentration of inhibitor [I]0 were computed for individual curves by fitting the data to Equation 2 when [I]0 ≥ 10 times the enzyme concentration [E]0, where [P] is the concentration of product formed over time t, and vo is the initial velocity of the reaction. [p]=v0kobs(1-exp-kobs·t)(Eq. 2) Non-linear regression analysis to determine the inactivation constant kinact and the inhibition constant ki was performed using the Kaleidagraph program and Equation 3. [S]0 is the concentration of substrate. kobs=kinact[I]0(I0+Ki1+S0/Km)(Eq. 3) Competition Labeling Assay to Assess the Selectivity of the Inhibitor—To compare the inhibitory activity and selectivity of Ac-HGPR-AOMK against human cathepsins L, B, and K, a competition labeling experiment was carried out as described previously (27Greenbaum D. Medzihradszky K.F. Burlingame A. Bogyo M. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 569-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). The intensity of bands inversely reflects the binding efficacy of Ac-HGPR-AOMK to the given proteases. This was measured using densitometry for quantitative comparison. Synthesis of the Complete Diverse PS-SCL—A completely diversified PS-SCL with the general structure of acetyl-P4-P3-P2-P1-ACC was synthesized using ACC, a bifunctional fluorophore leaving group with chemically labile sites for peptide synthesis and attachment to solid support. The library consists of P1, P2, P3, and P4 libraries in which the corresponding P1, P2, P3, or P4 position is fixed with one of 20 amino acids (omitting cysteine and including norleucine), whereas the remaining three positions contain an equimolar mixture of these amino acids (Fig. 1). As a result, each of the P1-P4 libraries has 20 sublibraries that contain a mixture of 8,000 (=203) species of tetrapeptide fluorogenic substrates. As a whole, the complete diverse library contains 160,000 unique tetrapeptide substrates. The library was functionally characterized using the enzymes trypsin, papain, and legumain, the substrate specificities of which are well known (Supplemental Data 1). The P1-diverse PS-SCL and various P1-fixed PS-SCLs were also used to profile these enzymes and human cysteine cathepsins (data not shown). The results obtained using these libraries were compared with those obtained from the complete diverse PS-SCL assays. The results were in good agreement with each other, providing confidence that the complete diverse library was not biased. Specificity of Papain-like Cysteine Proteases—The specificities of papain, bromelain, and human cysteine cathepsins L, V, S, K, F, and B were determined using the complete diverse PS-SCL (Fig. 2). The specificities of cruzain, rhodesain, cathepsin L-like protease from L. mexicana, and cathepsin B-like proteases 1 and 2 from S. mansoni were similarly determined using the complete diverse PS-SCL. Nearly all of these proteases displayed a preference for hydrophobic amino acids at the P2 position except bromelain, which strongly favored basic amino acids such as arginine. All six human cathepsins generally matched papain in specificity by preferring arginine and lysine at the P1 position, strictly hydrophobic amino acids at the P2 position, and broader specificities at the P3 and P4 positions. However, the complete diverse PS-SCL assay demonstrated the differences in the chemical characteristics of the favored amino acids at the P2 position and more subtle P3 specificity. At the P2 position, the substrate specificity profile of cathepsin L shows a preference for aromatic residues (phenylalanine, tryptophan, tyrosine) over aliphatic amino acids (valine, leucine), which distinguishes it from cathepsins K and S (Fig. 2, a, c, and d). Cathepsins K and S have been described to prefer branched hydrophobic residues at the P2 position, whereas cathepsin L has been shown to favor aromatic amino acids (12Brömme D. Okamoto K. Wang B.B. Biroc S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2126-2132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 28McGrath M.E. Palmer J.T. Brömme D. Somoza J.R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1294-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These previous studies are in good agreement with the complete diverse PS-SCL assay results, which showed that cathepsins K and S exclusively favored aliphatic amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, valine, methionine) at the P2 position. Cathepsin V, which is the closest to cathepsin L in terms of sequence identity, showed a preference similar to cathepsin L, favoring aromatic amino acids (tryptophan, tyrosine) over aliphatic amino acids (leucine, valine) (Fig. 2b). Cathepsin V accepted phenylalanine and leucine equally well at the P2 position, which is also consistent with previously published studies (17Brömme D. Li Z. Barnes M. Mehler E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2377-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 29Puzer L. Cotrin S.S. Alves M.F. Egborge T. Araujo M.S. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Brömme D. Carmona A.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 430: 274-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The P2 specificity of cathepsin F was similar to that of cathepsin K except for the proline preference of cathepsin K (Fig. 2e). It is noteworthy that cathepsin F accepted aspartic acid at the P2 and P3 positions, whereas none of the other cathepsins tolerate this acidic amino acid residue at either position. The complete diverse library assay confirmed that cathepsin B has much broader P2 specificity. Cathepsin B also showed stronger activity with the P1 library than with the P2 library, which significantly contrasts with the cathepsin L group proteases cathepsins L, V, S, and K (Fig. 2f). The library assay also confirmed that cathepsin B accepts arginine well at the P2 position, whereas the other cathepsins did not show any noticeable activity with this amino acid, in agreement with previous studies (30Cotrin S.S. Puzer L. de Souza Judice W.A. Juliano L. Carmona A.K. Juliano M.A. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 335: 244-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). At the P3 position, cathepsins L and S showed similarly broad specificity but also displayed noticeable preference for basic amino acids (lysine, arginine) and some aliphatic amino acids (norleucine, leucine, methionine, isoleucine), whereas cathepsin V favored proline and norleucine. The library assay also indicated that cathepsin B has a narrower P3 specificity (norleucine, leucine, methionine, lysine, arginine) than it was previously believed to have. Specificity of Papain-like Proteases of Parasitic Origin—All the parasite proteases tested showed very similar P1 specificity as human cathepsins. Again, the interaction in the S2 subsite appears to be the predominant specificity-defining factor. Cruzain, rhodesain, and cathepsin L-like protease from L. mexicana showed specificity that is similar to that of human cathepsins L and V, whereas cathepsin B-like proteases 1 and 2 from S. mansoni showed much broader P2 specificity, accepting more amino acids than the aforementioned parasite proteases (Supplemental Data 2). It is noteworthy that cathepsin B-like protease 1 has less similar P2 and P3 specificities to human cathepsin B, although it has higher sequence identity to human cathepsin B than cathepsin B-like protease 2 has. This shows that a simple sequence comparison is not sufficient to deduce the specificity of an homologous protease. Unique Substrate Specificity of Human Cathepsin K—With the complete diverse PS-SCL, cathepsin K displayed the most distinguishing substrate specificity among the human cathepsins tested. The protease exclusively favored aliphatic amino acids (leucine, isoleucine) at the P2 position, unlike cathepsins L and V, which accepted both aromatic and aliphatic amino acids. Most distinctively, cathepsin K favored proline and glycine at the P2 and P3 positions, respectively, whereas neither of those amino acids, especially proline, were preferred by the other human cathepsins (in Fig. 2c, the proline preference is designated with a black bar). This is in agreement with a previous study that showed that Z-GPR-AMC shows a partial selectivity for cathepsin K (31Xia L. Kilb J. Wex H. Li Z. Lipyansky A. Breuil V. Stein L. Palmer J.T. Dempster D.W. Brömme D. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2132818618,"UNC-6/Netrin and its receptor UNC-40/DCC are conserved regulators of growth cone guidance. By directly observing developing neurons in vivo, we show that UNC-6 and UNC-40 also function during axon formation to initiate, maintain and orient asymmetric neuronal growth. The immature HSN neuron of Caenorhabditis elegans breaks spherical symmetry to extend a leading edge toward ventral UNC-6. In unc-6 and unc-40 mutants, leading edge formation fails, the cell remains symmetrical until late in development and the axon that eventually forms is misguided. Thus netrin has two activities: one that breaks neuronal symmetry and one that guides the future axon. As the axon forms, UNC-6, UNC-40 and the lipid modulators AGE-1/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and DAF-18/PTEN drive the actin-regulatory pleckstrin homology (PH) domain protein MIG-10/lamellipodin ventrally in HSN to promote asymmetric growth. The coupling of a directional netrin cue to sustained asymmetric growth via PI3K signaling is reminiscent of polarization in chemotaxing cells."
https://openalex.org/W2051459755,"UBPY is a ubiquitin-specific protease that can deubiquitinate monoubiquitinated receptor tyrosine kinases, as well as process Lys-48- and Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin to lower denomination forms in vitro. Catalytically inactive UBPY localizes to endosomes, which accumulate ubiquitinated proteins. We have explored the sequelae of short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of UBPY. Global levels of ubiquitinated protein increase and ubiquitin accumulates on endosomes, although free ubiquitin levels are unchanged. UBPY-depleted cells have more and larger multivesicular endosomal structures that are frequently associated through extended contact areas, characterized by regularly spaced, electron-dense, bridging profiles. Degradation of acutely stimulated receptor tyrosine kinases, epidermal growth factor receptor and Met, is strongly inhibited in UBPY knockdown cells suggesting that UBPY function is essential for growth factor receptor down-regulation. In contrast, stability of the UBPY binding partner STAM is dramatically compromised in UBPY knockdown cells.

However, there is an increasing appreciation that alternative polyubiquitin chain structures play crucial roles in cellular physiology (14Pickart C.M. Fushman D. Curr. Opin. Chem.

The reversibility of ubiquitination can be attributed to the action of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) of which there are an estimated 79 encoded in the human genome (16Nijman S.M. Luna-Vargas M.P.

Two DUBs, associated molecule with the SH3-domain of STAM (AMSH) and ubiquitin-specific processing protease Y (UBPY) are known to interact directly with signal transducing adapter molecule (STAM), a protein that is constitutively associated with the endosomal sorting adapter Hrs (18Tanaka N.

UBPY is a cysteine protease of the ubiquitin-specific processing protease (UBP/USP) family, also known as USP8, and has been proposed to regulate cellular ubiquitin levels and entry into S phase (23Naviglio S.

The yeast orthologue of UBPY is thought to be Doa4, which associates with late components of the MVB sorting machinery (24Bowers K. Lottridge J. Helliwell S.B. Goldthwaite L.M. Luzio J.P.

In this paper we show that knockdown of UBPY by RNA interference has multiple cellular effects that include the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins on endosomes, an increase in both number and size of multivesicular endosomes, and a block in RTK degradation. Plasmids—Human UBPY cDNA was obtained from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Japan (clone KIAA0055) and subcloned into pEGFPC1. The C786S mutation was introduced by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) and subcloned into pEGFP-UBPY. A short interfering (si)RNA-resistant UBPY construct (UBPY*) was generated by introducing five degenerate point mutations (underlined below) into UBPY within the region targeted by UBPY-specific siRNA duplex1 (forward primer sequence GCCTATGTACTATATATGAAGTACGTCACGGTGTACAATCTTATC) and subcloning into pEGFPC1-UBPY. GST-UBPY, HA-STAM, and Flag-ubiquitin constructs were generous gifts from Giulio Draetta (Milan, Italy), Naomi Kitamura (Yokohama, pMIW-HA-Hbp), and John O'Bryan (Chicago, IL). Antibodies and Other Reagents—Mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody was from Covance, and anti-ubiquitin antibodies were from Sigma (U5379), Covance (P4G7), and Affiniti-Biomol (FK1, FK2). Anti-GFP was a gift of Francis Barr (Martinsried, Germany). Mouse monoclonal anti-EGFR R1 and goat polyclonal anti-EGFR 1005 were from Santa Cruz. Met antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling. Anti-lysobisphosphatidic acid was a generous gift of Jean Gruenberg (Geneva, Switzerland). Rabbit polyclonal AMSH, Hrs, and STAM antibodies have been previously described (7Hammond D.E. Carter S.

Bacterial Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—GST-UBPY was expressed in Rosetta (DE3) pLysS cells (Novagen) and batch-purified with glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia) according to manufacturers' instructions. Purified protein was dialyzed against DUB-assay buffer. Deubiquitination Assays—Lys-48-linked tetraubiquitin (250 ng) or Lys-63-linked tetraubiquitin chains (250 ng) (Boston Biochem) were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in 20 μl of DUB-assay buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol), pH 8.3, with 1 μm GST-UBPY. Proteins were resolved on 4-12% NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (0.2 μm), the membrane was boiled for 30 min in deionized water, blocked in 0.5% fish skin gelatin, 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline, and probed with a rabbit antibody to ubiquitin (Sigma) followed by ECL-based detection. Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa cells were cultured in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% non-essential amino acids. All tissue culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. HeLa cells were transfected with GeneJuice transfection reagent (Merck Biosciences) and lysed or fixed 24 h post-transfection. Cell Lysis and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and incubated with antibodies and Protein A- or Protein G-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C. Alternatively, cells were lysed in “hot SDS” lysis buffer (1% SDS, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA at 110 °C), and lysates were heated at 110 °C for 10 min with intermittent vortexing, precleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min, and diluted with four volumes of TX100-dilution buffer (1.25% TX100, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 125 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF) prior to immunoprecipitation. Detection of Ubiquitinated EGFR—siRNA-treated cells were starved in serum-free medium for 16 h, stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF for various times, placed on ice, and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, and 50 mm NaF), supplemented with protease inhibitors, phosphatase inhibitors, and 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide. EGFR was immunoprecipitated overnight and immunoprecipitates were washed in 20 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and resuspended in sample buffer. Three-quarters of each sample was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin, and the remainder was probed in parallel for EGFR, to control for even loading. Depletion of Cellular UBPY by siRNA—HeLa cells were treated twice over 96 h with either control siRNA duplex (nonspecific control VII) or UBPY-specific siRNA duplex1 (sense UGAAAUACGUGACUGUUUAUU, antisense 5′-PUAAACAGUCACGUAUUUCAUU) or UBPY-specific siRNA duplex 2 (sense GGACAGGACAGUAUAGAUAUU, antisense 5′-PUAUCUAUACUGUCCUGUCCUU, Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) and AMSH-specific siRNA duplex (sense UUACAAAUCUGCUGUCAUUUU, antisense 5′-PAAUGACAGCAGAUUUGUAAUU, Dharmacon) at 40.8 nm concentration using Oligofectamine in the absence of serum (Invitrogen). Four hours post-transfection, fetal bovine serum was added to a final concentration of 10%. Alternatively, HeLa cells were treated twice over 96 h with siRNA at a concentration of 47.2 nm using a calcium phosphate protocol. Briefly, medium was replaced with 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum, 500μl of 0.25 m CaCl2, and 0.52 nmol of siRNA were premixed and added gradually with gentle vortexing to 500 μl of BBS (50 mm BES, pH 6.95, 280 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm Na2HP04), incubated for 20 min and added dropwise to the cells. The cells were then incubated at 3% CO2 overnight. The efficiency of UBPY knockdown was routinely assessed by Western blotting and determined manually by counting on a fluorescence microscope the percent of cells showing an accumulation of ubiquitin on endosomes as shown in Fig. 5E. For the siRNA-rescue experiment, HeLa cells were treated twice over 96 h with either control siRNA duplex or UBPY-specific siRNA duplex1. Sixty-six hours before harvesting, the cells were transfected with pEGFPC1 or pEGFPC1-siRNAi resistant UBPY (UBPY*). The percent of GFP-labeled cells, which retained EGFR after 4 h of EGF treatment was determined manually by counting on a fluorescence microscope. Immunofluorescence—Cells were processed 24 h post-transfection for immunofluorescence as previously described (8Urbé S. Sachse M. Row P.E. Preisinger C. Barr F.A. Strous G. Klumperman J. Clague M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4169-4179Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies used were labeled with Alexa-Fluor 594 or 488. Dual-stained confocal images were taken with a Leica confocal SP2 AOBS (HCX PL APO CS 63.0 × 1.40 oil objective). Electron Microscopy—Control and UBPY-depleted HeLa cells were incubated in media containing 10 mg/ml horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) for 30 min before fixing with 2% glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer, pH7.4. Following cross-linking of horseradish peroxidase with 0.075% of 3,3′diaminobenzidine tetra hydrochloride (Sigma), 0.023% H2O2, cells were post-fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde, osmicated, stained en bloc with uranyl acetate and processed for Epon embedding according to standard procedures. Ultrathin (70 nm) sections were cut and stained with lead citrate before viewing in a Tecnai Spirit electron microscope. MVBs were identified morphologically by the presence of internal vesicles, and their maximal chord lengths were determined using AnalySIS (SIS, GmbH). Gross changes in MVB abundance were measured by counting MVBs in cells with a coincident nuclear profile and normalizing to the total cell area measured with AnalySIS (scrambled: cellular profiles counted n = 22, total area of cells examined = 3353 μm2, MVBs counted n = 156; UBPY: cellular profiles counted n = 23, total area of cells examined area = 3382 μm2, MVBs counted n = 230). Substrate Specificity of UBPY—We have adapted an in vitro assay for DUB activity that monitors the processing of polyubiquitin chains to lower denomination forms (22McCullough J. Clague M.J. Urbé S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 30Hartmann-Petersen R. Hendil K.B. Gordon C. FEBS Lett. 2003; 535: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In our original analysis, AMSH showed specificity for Lys-63-linked, whereas UBPY showed specificity for Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin (22McCullough J. Clague M.J. Urbé S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). This observation came with the caveat that the Lys-63-linked chains available to us at that time were derived from mutant ubiquitin in which all lysines, with the exception of Lys-63, had been converted to arginines. We have now repeated these experiments with polyubiquitin chains derived from wild-type ubiquitin and find that in contrast to AMSH, UBPY shows little discrimination between Lys-48 and Lys-63-linked chains (Fig. 1). Subcellular Distribution of UBPY—We next analyzed the subcellular localization of UBPY and a catalytically inactive mutant UBPY (C786S) (23Naviglio S. Mattecucci C. Matoskova B. Nagase T. Nomura N. Di Fiore P.P. Draetta G.F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3241-3250Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) in HeLa cells. We analyzed cells expressing low levels of GFP-tagged UBPY and UBPY (C786S) because our UBPY antibody is not sensitive enough to pick up the endogenous protein. In untreated cells, both wild-type and inactive UBPY are localized to the cytosol and plasma membrane (Fig. 2). UBPY (C786S) shows an additional staining of punctate structures, identified as early endosomes by co-localization with anti-EEA1 (Fig. 2, D-F) and with internalized EGFR (J-L). Interestingly, wild-type UBPY appears to be recruited to EGFR-containing early endosomes upon stimulation (Fig. 2, G-I). Regulation of Ubiquitin Dynamics—Expression of catalytically inactive, but not wild-type, UBPY causes a build up of ubiquitin on endosomes; a phenomenon we have previously observed following expression of catalytically inactive AMSH (D348A) (Fig. 3A) (22McCullough J. Clague M.J. Urbé S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to AMSH (D348A), this UBPY (C786S) mutant does not promote accumulation of a higher molecular mass (+14 kDa) form of STAM (Fig. 3B), which is recognized by ubiquitin antibodies (22McCullough J. Clague M.J. Urbé S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Both UBPY and AMSH associate with the SH3 domain of STAM via the same type of non-canonical PXXP motif and hence may compete for binding (19Kato M. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37481-37487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Effects due to overexpression of catalytically inactive mutants could reflect displacement of either endogenous UBPY or AMSH. We therefore turned to RNA interference to address the role of UBPY in endosomal ubiquitin dynamics (Fig. 4A). Neither treatment of cells with transfection reagent alone, control (scrambled) siRNA, nor specific AMSH siRNA had any effect on the overall levels of ubiquitinated proteins as detected by Western blotting (Fig. 4B). In contrast, knockdown of UBPY, achieved independently with two distinct siRNA oligonucleotides, resulted in a clear increase in the level of ubiquitinated proteins. Many of these proteins are polyubiquitinated, based on Western blotting with a polyubiquitin specific antibody (FK1 (4Haglund K. Sigismund S. Polo S. Szymkiewicz I. Di Fiore P.P. Dikic I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 4C). Although overall ubiquitination was increased, no depletion in the levels of free ubiquitin was observed in UBPY knockdown cells (Fig. 4B). Immunofluorescence microscopy on UBPY knockdown cells revealed an accumulation of ubiquitin on endosomes in 84.7 ± 4.5% (n = 5, total number of cells counted 1474) of the cells treated with UBPY Oligo1 and 83.2 ± 3.2% (n = 4, total number of cells counted 977) treated with Oligo2, which was not observed in control cells (0.3 ± 0%, n = 3, total number of cells counted 1006) (Fig. 5, A-F). These could be co-labeled with EEA1, which exhibits a corresponding redistribution to ubiquitin-positive perinuclear clusters in addition to more characteristic peripheral punctae. Morphological Changes—Using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, we noticed an increased apposition between EEA1-positive endosomes and structures containing LBPA, a late endosomal/lysosomal marker (Fig. 5, G-L) (2White I.J. Bailey L.M. Aghakhani M.R. Moss S.E. Futter C.E. EMBO J. 2005; 25: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 31Kobyashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Examination of UBPY knockdown cells by transmission electron microscopy revealed that knockdown cells contained an increased number of multivesicular endosomal profiles (45% increase of MVBs/μm2, p < 0.038), which also showed a significant difference in size distribution with 30.4% of MVBs in UBPY-depleted cells having a maximum diameter of >800 nm as compared with 9.4% in control-treated cells (Fig. 6, A and D). Another striking feature is the induction of vacuolar structures, which appear largely empty save for a few luminal vesicles and which are not seen in control cells (Fig. 6, compare B with C). Electron microscopy also provides striking views of large numbers of MVBs “stitched together” along extended areas of close contact by a regularly spaced repeating unit of electron-dense material with a characteristic length of 23.3 ± 3.1 nm (n = 33) (Fig. 7).FIGURE 7UBPY knockdown promotes accumulation of MVBs that are attached to each other via distinctive tethers. Clusters of endosomes display an unusual regular tethering arrangement (arrows, A and B) that is not seen in control cells. Bars = 50 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Regulation of RTK Dynamics—EEA1 containing endosomes in UBPY-depleted cells were accessible to internalized EGFR (and EGF) but in distinction to endosomes in control cells, retained the receptor for extended time periods and protected it from degradation (Fig. 8A). This delay in EGFR degradation could be directly attributed to the loss of UBPY, because overexpression of siRNA-resistant GFP-tagged UBPY (UBPY*), but not GFP alone, was able to rescue this phenotype (Fig. 8B). Co-expression of GFP-UBPY* during the last 66 h of the siRNA-mediated UBPY knockdown, significantly attenuated the delay in EGFR degradation: only 9.8% of GFP-UBPY*-transfected cells showed endosomal EGFR retention after 4 h of EGF treatment, compared with 75.4% of cells transfected with GFP alone. Likewise, only 3.1% of GFP-UBPY*-expressing cells showed an aberrant accumulation of ubiquitin on endosomes as compared with 77% of GFP-expressing cells (not shown). We further confirmed that EGFR down-regulation was defective in UBPY knockdown cells, by analyzing the same type of experiment using Western blotting of cell lysates (Fig. 9A). Following 60 min of acute EGF stimulation, we routinely detect a diagnostic EGFR degradation product that accompanies loss of full-length receptor (indicated by an arrow). This fragment is not generated in UBPY knockdown cells, and the life-time of the receptor is significantly extended. It should however be noted that although this is a very clear block, a slow decline in EGFR levels is evident nevertheless. We next monitored the ubiquitination status of the EGFR upon EGF stimulation and found that deubiquitination of EGFR is severely impaired in UBPY-depleted cells (Fig. 9B), suggesting that UBPY activity may be required for removal of ubiquitin from EGFR prior to incorporation into MVBs.FIGURE 9UBPY is required for the down-regulation of acutely stimulated receptor tyrosine kinases. A and C, HeLa cells were treated either with control siRNA or UBPY-specific siRNA, starved, and stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF or 250 ng/ml HGF for indicated times. Cells were then lysed, and protein samples were analyzed by immunoblotting (IB) with anti-UBPY and anti-EGFR and anti-Met antibodies. Equal loading was assessed by reprobing with anti-tubulin. Note the appearance of a diagnostic EGFR degradation product (arrow in A) at 60 min in control cells that is absent from UBPY knockdown cells. B, HeLa cells were treated as in A, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with anti-EGFR or without antibody (-α). As a further control, a mock-immunoprecipitation without lysate was carried out in parallel (-lys). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin (top) and anti-EGFR (bottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We wondered whether the requirement of UBPY activity was specific to the down-regulation of EGFR or whether our observation would translate to other RTKs. We therefore analyzed the down-regulation of Met, the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor/Scatter factor in UBPY knockdown cells. Met receptor degradation requires both ubiquitination and endocytosis (6Peschard P. Fournier T.M. Lamorte L. Naujokas M.A. Band H. Langdon W.Y. Park M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 995-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 32Hammond D.E. Urbé S. Vande Woude G.F. Clague M.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2761-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), although, in distinction to EGFR, it also shows sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors through an indirect effect on its trafficking itinerary (33Carter S. Urbé S. Clague M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52835-52839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Met receptor degradation is highly sensitive to UBPY knockdown and, as for EGFR, the degradation rate is significantly slowed in the absence of UBPY (Fig. 9C). UBPY Regulates the Stability of the Hrs-STAM Complex—How can knockdown of a DUB retard RTK trafficking while free ubiquitin levels remain unaltered? One possibility is that UBPY can somehow regulate the MVB sorting machinery rather than act on the receptors themselves. We analyzed the distribution of Hrs in cells that were either mock-treated or depleted of UBPY or AMSH. In control, as well as in AMSH-depleted cells, Hrs is distributed between a major cytosolic and an endosomal pool, which presents as a mixture of peripheral punctate structures and a more tubulo-reticular perinuclear staining. This distribution is dramatically changed in UBPY-depleted cells; the cytosolic pool is largely depleted, and Hrs is recruited to aberrantly large perinuclear structures (Fig. 10A), which also label for ubiquitin (Fig. 5, D-F). We further analyzed SDS-lysates of these cells by Western blotting and found that the total levels of Hrs were significantly decreased (50.2 ± 6.0%, n = 3) (Fig. 10B). Even more dramatically, we found that the Hrs-associated adapter protein STAM was effectively depleted in UBPY knockdown cells (Fig. 10C, >90% depleted, n = 3). However, over-expression of STAM in UBPY knockdown cells cannot rescue the observed defect in EGFR degradation (not shown). DUBs may stabilize proteins by opposing their ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation. To test whether this might be the case for regulation of STAM levels, we treated UBPY knockdown Flag-Ubiquitin-transfected cells with the proteasomal inhibitor lactacystin. Following lysis of cells under denaturing conditions with SDS-containing buffer (hot SDS-lysis), STAM was immunoprecipitated and probed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibodies. Our data indicate that proteasomal inhibitio"

It has been hypothesized that apoE affects AD development via isoform-specific effects on lipid trafficking between astrocytes and neurons. However, the regulation of the cholesterol supply of neurons via apoE-containing high density lipoproteins remains to be clarified. We show for the first time that the brain-specific metabolite of cholesterol produced by neurons, i.e. 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, induces apoE transcription, protein synthesis, and secretion in a dose- and time-dependent manner in cells of astrocytic but not of neuronal origin. Moreover, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol primes astrocytoma, but not neuroblastoma cells, to mediate cholesterol efflux to apoE. Similar results were obtained using the synthetic liver X receptor (LXR) agonist GW683965A, suggesting involvement of an LXR-controlled signaling pathway. A 10-20-fold higher basal LXRα and -β expression level in astrocytoma compared with neuroblastoma cells may underlie these differential effects. Furthermore, apoE-mediated cholesterol efflux from astrocytoma cells may be controlled by the ATP binding cassette transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1, since their expression was also up-regulated by both compounds. In contrast, ABCG4 seems not to be involved, because its expression was induced only in neuronal cells. The expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP-2), low density lipoprotein receptor, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, and SREBP-1c was transiently up-regulated by GW683965A in astrocytes but down-regulated by 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, suggesting that cholesterol efflux and synthesis are regulated independently. In conclusion, evidence is provided that 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol induces apoE-mediated efflux of cholesterol in astrocytes via an LXR-controlled pathway, which may be relevant for chronic and acute neurological diseases.

Disturbances in brain cholesterol homeostasis are associated with the onset of severe neurological diseases (1Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. Curr. Opin.

Lipids. 1999; 34: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The brain, although composing just 2% of the total body mass, contains about a quarter of an individual's whole body unesterified cholesterol. Brain cholesterol originates almost exclusively from in situ neosynthesis (1Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar); circulating cholesterol is prevented from entering the brain by the blood-brain-barrier (4Bjorkhem I. Meaney S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 806-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Because cholesterol cannot be degraded and is neurotoxic at high levels, excess cholesterol is secreted from the brain into the circulation (5Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar). Cholesterol is removed from the brain predominantly (about 60%) in the form of the relatively polar brain-specific metabolite, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, formed by the enzyme cholesterol 24(S)-hydroxylase (CYP46) (1Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). The remaining 40% of cholesterol is secreted from the brain via an unknown pathway that may involve apoE (6Lund E.G. Xie C. Kotti T. Turley S.D. Dietschy J.M. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22980-22988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). CYP46 is expressed predominantly by neurons (7Brown III, J. Theisler C. Silberman S. Magnuson D.

Polymorphisms of CYP46 have been linked to AD, and the expression of this enzyme appeared to be shifted from neurons to glia in AD patients (12Bogdanovic N. Bretillon L. Lund E.G. Diczfalusy U. Lannfelt L. Winblad B. Russell D.W. Bjorkhem I. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 314: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Finally, increased levels of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol levels have been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients (13Papassotiropoulos A. Lutjohann D. Bagli M. Locatelli S. Jessen F. Buschfort R. Ptok U. Bjorkhem I. von Bergmann K. Heun R. J. Psychiatr. Res. 2002; 36: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). 24(S)-Hydroxycholesterol is a natural ligand of the liver X receptors (LXR), which have recently been identified as central players in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism (14Joseph S.B.

LXR belong to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, and two isoforms, i.e. LXRα and LXRβ, have been identified that are activated by oxysterols. Both isoforms of LXR are expressed in the central nervous system (16Whitney K.D. Watson M.A. Collins J.L. Benson W.G. Stone T.M. Numerick M.J. Tippin T.K. Wilson J.G. Winegar D.A. Kliewer S.A. Mol.

LXRα/β-null mice show a variety of central nervous system defects upon aging, including lipid accumulation, astrocyte proliferation, and disorganized myelin sheaths (17Wang L. Schuster G.U.

The strongest genetic risk factor known for sporadic AD is apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4), one of the three common apoE variants (apoE2, apoE3, apoE4) in humans (21Saunders A.M. Strittmatter W.J. Schmechel D. George-Hyslop P.H. Pericak-Vance M.A. Joo S.H. Rosi B.L. Gusella J.F. Crapper-MacLachlan D.R. Alberts M.J. Neurology. 1993; 43: 1467-1472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Corder E.H.

ApoE is a key player in the transport of cholesterol in the circulation (23Mahley R.W. Innerarity T.L. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 1277-1294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is also thought to fulfill such a role within the brain (24Puglielli L. Tanzi R.E. Kovacs D.M. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Astrocytes are the predominant source of apoE in the brain. These cells secrete apoE in association with cholesterol and phospholipids in the form of small, high density lipoprotein-like particles (25Gong J.S. Kobayashi M. Hayashi H. Zou K. Sawamura N. Fujita S.C. Yanagisawa K. Michikawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29919-29926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that these particles provide neurons with cholesterol required for the formation of new membranes, e.g. during development, regeneration after injury, or during the formation of new synaptic contacts (26Pfrieger F.W. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1158-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that apoE may affect the pathogenesis of AD by isoform-specific effects on lipid trafficking between astrocytes and neurons (27Michikawa M. Fan Q.W. Isobe I. Yanagisawa K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1008-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Indeed, apoE in combination with cholesterol induces the outgrowth of neurites in an isoform-specific manner in neuronal cultures (28Nathan B.P. Chang K.C. Bellosta S. Brisch E. Ge N. Mahley R.W. Pitas R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19791-19799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). However, factors that regulate the supply of glial-derived apoE-containing lipoproteins are poorly understood. In this study we tested the hypothesis that 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol represents a natural brain-specific LXR ligand that is involved in the regulation of the apoE-mediated lipid supply. For this purpose the effects of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol and the synthetic LXR agonist GW683965A on the expression of apoE and additional LXR target genes involved in cholesterol efflux were compared using human neuroblastoma and astrocytoma cell lines as well as primary astrocytes. We found that 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, like GW683965A, is able to induce the expression of ABCA1, ABCG1, and apoE in astrocytes and to elevate apoE-mediated cholesterol efflux in astrocytoma but not in neuroblastoma cells. Our observations support the hypothesis that 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol participates in an LXR-controlled pathway that regulates cholesterol availability in the brain. Chemical Reagents—24(S)-Hydroxycholesterol was a kind gift from Dr. D. Lutjohann (Bonn University, Germany), and 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol was a kind gift from Dr. J. Plat (Maastricht University, The Netherlands). GW683965A was provided by GlaxoSmithKline. The following reagents were purchased from Sigma: 9-cis-retinoic acid, leupeptin, aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, bovine insulin, human transferrin, putrescine, sodium selenite, and progesterone. ApoA-I and apoE were purchased from Calbiochem. Stocks of 24(S)-OH cholesterol (10 mm), 22(R)-OH cholesterol (10 mm), and cholesterol (10 mm) were dissolved in ethanol. GW683965A (2 mm) and 9-cis-retinoic acid (10 mm) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Cell Culture Experiments—The human astrocytoma cell line CCF-STTG1 and human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY-5Y were purchased from European Collection of Cell Cultures (Salisbury, UK). CCF-STTG1 and SH-SY-5Y cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf serum. At 80-90% confluency cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and treated with different reagents in DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) with 10% fetal calf serum for various periods of time as indicated. SH-SY-5Y cells were preincubated for 24 h in the DMEM-Ham's F-12 (1:1) medium without serum containing the N2 supplement (2.5 mg/ml bovine insulin, 10 mg/ml human transferrin (iron-saturated), 0.52 μg/ml sodium selenite, 1.61 mg/ml putrescine, and 0.63 μg/ml progesterone in PBS, pH 7.3). At the end of the treatments conditioned media were collected, and the cells were either lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Santa Cruz, CA), or total RNA was isolated as described below for subsequent analyses. The method of rat primary astrocytes culturing was similar to published procedures (29Dijkstra S. Bar P.R. Gispen W.H. Joosten E.A.

Neonatal (postnatal day 1) Lewis rat pups, bred in the animal facilities of Maastricht University, were decapitated, and the neocortex was dissected and cleared of meninges. The tissue was diced in small fragments and incubated in trypsin (0.05% in phosphate-buffered saline) at 37 °C for 15 min. Trypsinization was stopped by adding culture medium, and the tissue was gently centrifuged. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of culture medium. Single cell dissociation was achieved by 3-5 passes through a 5-ml pipette (Greiner, Germany) and 10-20 passes through a 1-ml pipette (Greiner). Then the tissue was centrifuged very briefly to separate cells from tissue debris. The supernatant containing the cells was then plated into 25-cm2 cell culture flasks (Corning, NY) at a density of 106 cells per flask. Culture medium was refreshed after 4-5 days and every 2 days thereafter. At DIV12 (days in vitro) the cultures reached confluence, and contaminating cells were shaken off on a rotary shaker (Rotofix 32, Hettich Zentrifugen). This involves shaking of the flasks for 48 h and refreshment of the medium. At DIV14 the purification is complete and renders >95% glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP)-immunopositive astrocyte cultures. Primary murine mixed glial cultures were prepared from postnatal day-1-2 C57Bl/6 mice. Brains from individual animals were placed into ice-cold Hanks'-buffered salt solution (Canadian Invitrogen) containing 6 mg/ml glucose and 10 mm HEPES. Meninges were removed, frontal cortices were dissected, and cells were dissociated by repeated passage through a series of wide to fine bored pipettes. Dissociated cells were plated in DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen) and 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen) at one 24-well plate per mouse. Cells were cultured in the presence of 5% CO2 for 12 days when cells were confluent and contained at least 80% astrocytes. Cells were treated with either vehicle-only (ethanol) or increasing concentrations of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol for 24 h. Subsequently, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, and lysed using a buffer containing 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) in PBS. Protein concentration was determined by a Dc protein assay (Bio-Rad). Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysates (25 μg of protein/lane) or conditioned media concentrates (concentrated using Microcon® centrifugal filter device, Millipore, Billerica, MA) were subjected to dodecyl sulfate-10 (SDS) or 12% PAGE and then transferred to Protran nitrocellulose transfer membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) or to polyvinylidene membranes (Millipore). After blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk (Protifar-plus, Nutricia Netherland B.V.) in washing buffer (PBS with 0.5% Triton-X100), the membranes were incubated with antibodies against human apoE (1:500, DAKO A/S, Denmark), murine apoE (Santa Cruz), human glutamine synthetase (1:500, BD Transduction Laboratories), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Chemicon), or a monoclonal anti-ABCA1 antibody raised against the second nucleotide binding domain (NBD2 of ABCA1) (31Wellington C.L.

The membranes were then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, after which the results were visualized using ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and autoradiography (LAS 3000, Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd., Japan). Bands were quantitated by densitometry using NIH Image J. RNA Isolation and Real-time Quantitative PCR (QRT-PCR) Procedures—Total RNA was isolated using the Trizol method (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Integrity of RNA was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis, and RNA concentration was measured spectrophotometrically (NanoDrop, Witec AG, Littau, Germany). Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using an Applied Biosystems 7700 sequence detector with 1.6.3 software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as previously described (32Heid C.A. Stevens J. Livak K.J. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 986-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (5040) Google Scholar) with modifications (33Plosch T. Kok T. Bloks V.W. Smit M.J. Havinga R. Chimini G. Groen A.K. Kuipers F. J.

Fluorogenic probes labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) and 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) were made by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). Efflux Studies—CCF-STTG1 or SH-SY-5Y cells were cultured in DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After washing with DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1), cells were loaded with 30 μg/ml [3H]cholesterol (38 Ci/mmol) in DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h in the presence or absence of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol or GW683965A. After cells were washed 5 times with PBS-bovine serum albumin 0.2% (w/v), the efflux assay was started by adding 2.5 μg/ml apoE or 5 μg/ml apoA-I in DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) to the wells. After 20 h of incubation at 37 °C, the medium was collected and centrifuged. Subsequently, [3H]cholesterol was quantified in the supernatant by liquid scintillation counting. Total cellular [3H]cholesterol was determined after extraction of the cells with 2-propanol. The percentage efflux was calculated by dividing the radioactive counts in the efflux medium by the sum of the counts in the medium and the cell extract. Statistical Analysis—Values are presented as the mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was determined by comparing means using an unpaired the Student's t test, the Mann-Whitney U test, and one-way analysis of variance with Newman-Keul's post-test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The Natural LXR Ligand 24(S)-Hydroxycholesterol Induces ApoE Gene Expression and Protein Levels in Astrocytoma Cells and in Primary Astrocytes but Not in Neuroblastoma Cells—To determine the effect of the natural LXR ligand 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol on apoE expression in astrocytoma and neuroblastoma cells and in primary astrocytes, cells were incubated with increasing amounts of the compound. We found that the incubation with 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol resulted a dose-dependent increase of APOE mRNA levels in astrocytoma cells (CCF-STTG1) but failed to induce APOE expression in neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY-5Y) even after 72 h of incubation (Fig. 1A). The synthetic LXR agonist GW683965A (4 μm) also clearly induced APOE expression in astrocytoma cells but not in neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 1A), strongly suggesting that 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol exerts its effects via the LXR pathway. Importantly, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol also induced APOE gene expression in primary rat astrocytes in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B), supporting the physiological relevance of this process. The induction of APOE expression (Fig. 2A) by 24 (S)-hydroxycholesterol and GW683965A in astrocytoma cells also appeared to be time-dependent, with strong induction already occurring after 24 h and a steady increase up to 72 h of incubation. The established LXR target gene SREBP-1c was also induced by both compounds but displayed a different induction profile compared with apoE (Fig. 2B). The expression of APOD, another LXR-target gene that has been suggested to compensate cholesterol transport functions in the absence of APOE (34Walczak R. Tontonoz P. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was not affected by the natural or synthetic LXR ligand in either cell line (data not shown). Next we determined if induction of APOE mRNA up-regulation resulted in increased protein levels. As shown in Fig. 3A, cellular apoE protein levels in astrocytoma cells were also clearly up-regulated by 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol in a concentration-dependent manner. Upon incubation of the cells for increasing periods of time in the presence of 10 μm 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, apoE protein levels increased up to 48 h and remained fairly constant thereafter up to 72 h (Fig. 3B). Similar to 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, the synthetic LXR agonist GW683965A increased apoE protein levels in astrocytoma cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 3, C and D). Secretion of apoE by astrocytoma cells into the medium was also strongly induced by 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol and GW683965A in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3E). 24(S)-Hydroxycholesterol also up-regulated cellular apoE protein levels in murine primary mixed glial cultures containing >80% astrocytes (Fig. 3F), further substantiating our findings.FIGURE 324(S)-Hydroxycholesterol (Chol) and GW683965A increase apoE protein levels and apoE secretion in CCF-STTG1 cells. 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol up-regulates apoE protein levels in murine primary glial cultures. CCF-STTG1 cells were treated either with increasing concentrations of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (A) and GW683965A (C) for a period of 72 h or with 10 μm 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (B) and 4 μm GW683965A (D) for increasing periods of time. Conditioned medium was collected after the treatment of CCF-STTG1 cells with different concentrations of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol and GW683965A for a period of 48 h (E). Murine primary glial cultures were treated with increasing concentrations of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol for 24 h (F). Cell lysates and medium concentrates were subjected to Western blot analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” ApoE expression was measured using a polyclonal antibody against apoE. Bands were quantified by densitometry, normalized to glutamine synthetase (GS) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Representative experiments of at least three independent experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because differences in expression of LXRs may underlie the differential effects of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol and GW683965A in the two cell types, we next determined their basal expression levels. Significantly higher mRNA levels of LXRα and LXRβ were found in astrocytoma cells compared with neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 4). Also SREBP-1c, an established LXR target gene involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism (35Repa J.J. Liang G. Ou J. Bashmakov Y. Lobaccaro J.M. Shimomura I. Shan B. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar), was expressed predominantly in astrocytoma cells. In contrast, mRNA levels of SREBP-2, another transcription factor involved in control of cholesterol metabolism, were similar in both cells types (Fig. 4A). Primary rat astrocytes also displayed a similar transcription profile for these genes (Fig. 4B). 24(S)-Hydroxycholesterol Is a Stronger Regulator of Intracellular ApoE Protein Levels in Astrocytoma Cells than Retinoic Acid and Free Cholesterol—24(S)-Hydroxycholesterol was compared with other natural LXR/retinoid X receptor (RXR) ligands with respect to its effect on intracellular apoE levels. In accordance with the observation that brain apoE is predominantly synthesized by astrocytes (36Pitas R.E. Boyles J.K. Lee S.H. Foss D. Mahley R.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 917: 148-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 37Ladu M.J. Reardon C. Van Eldik L. Fagan A.M. Bu G. Holtzman D. Getz G.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 903: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), we observed that the basal expression of the APOE gene in astrocytoma cells was substantially higher than in neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 4A). In astrocytoma cells, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol and GW683965A are as potent as 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol in inducing intracellular and secreted apoE and were considerably more effective than retinoic acid or free cholesterol (Fig. 5, A and C). Neither 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol nor GW683965A or any of the other LXR/retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonists affected apoE synthesis in neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 5B), demonstrating that LXR-mediated up-regulation of apoE synthesis and secretion is a pathway specific to astrocytes. 24(S)-Hydroxycholesterol and GW683965A Regulate the Expression of ABC Transporters and Other Genes Related to Cholesterol Metabolism in a Cell Type-specific Manner—ABCA1, ABCG1, and ABCG4 are transporters of cholesterol and/or phospholipids from cells to extracellular acceptors that may also be involved in intercellular lipid transport within the brain (38Hirsch-Reinshagen V. Zhou S. Burgess B.L. Bernier L. McIsaac S.A. Chan J.Y. Tansley G.H. Cohn J.S. Hayden M.R. Wellington C.L. J. Biol.

The results presented in Fig. 6A show that basal expression of ABCG1 mRNA was comparable in astrocytoma cells and in neuroblastoma cells. The relative expression of ABCA1 mRNA was higher than that of ABCG1 and also 3-fold higher in neuroblastoma than in astrocytoma cells. Likewise, the basal relative expression of ABCG4 mRNA was significantly higher in SH-SY-5Y cells than in astrocytoma cells (Fig. 6A). A pattern of relative ABC transporter expression simil"
https://openalex.org/W1984096283,"A novel regulatory mechanism for control of the ubiquitous 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (ODH), a key enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, was discovered in the actinomycete <i>Corynebacterium glutamicum,</i> a close relative of important human pathogens like <i>Corynebacterium diphtheriae</i> and <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. Based on the finding that a <i>C. glutamicum</i> mutant lacking serine/threonine protein kinase G (PknG) was impaired in glutamine utilization, proteome comparisons led to the identification of OdhI as a putative substrate of PknG. OdhI is a 15-kDa protein with a forkhead-associated domain and a homolog of mycobacterial GarA. By using purified proteins, PknG was shown to phosphorylate OdhI at threonine 14. The glutamine utilization defect of the Δ<i>pknG</i> mutant could be abolished by the additional deletion of <i>odhI</i>, whereas transformation of a Δ<i>odhI</i> mutant with a plasmid encoding OdhI-T14A caused a defect in glutamine utilization. Affinity purification of OdhI-T14A led to the specific copurification of OdhA, the E1 subunit of ODH. Because ODH is essential for glutamine utilization, we assumed that unphosphorylated OdhI inhibits ODH activity. In fact, OdhI was shown to strongly inhibit ODH activity with a <i>K<sub>i</sub></i> value of 2.4 nm. The regulatory mechanism described offers a molecular clue for the reduced ODH activity that is essential for the industrial production of 1.5 million tons/year of glutamate with <i>C. glutamicum</i>. Moreover, because this signaling cascade is likely to operate also in mycobacteria, our results suggest that the attenuated pathogenicity of mycobacteria lacking PknG might be caused by a disturbed tricarboxylic acid cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1964605487,"Daxx is a multifunctional protein that regulates a variety of cellular processes, including transcription, cell cycle, and apoptosis. SPOP is a BTB (Bric-a-brac/Tramtrack/Broad complex) protein that constitutes Cul3-based ubiquitin ligases. Here we show that SPOP serves as an adaptor of Daxx for the ubiquitination by Cul3-based ubiquitin ligase and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. Expression of SPOP with Cul3 markedly reduced Daxx level, and this degradation was blocked by SPOP-specific short hairpin RNAs. Inhibition of the proteasome by MG132 caused the prevention of Daxx degradation in parallel with the accumulation of ubiquitinated Daxx. Expression of SPOP with Cul3 reversed Daxx-mediated repression of ETS1- and p53-dependent transcription, and short hairpin RNA-mediated knock down of SPOP blocked the recovery of their transcriptional activation. Furthermore, Daxx degradation led to the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and the increase in the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-fluorescein nick end-labeling-positive apoptotic cells. These results suggest that SPOP/Cul3-ubiquitin ligase plays an essential role in the control of Daxx level and, thus, in the regulation of Daxx-mediated cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and apoptosis.

Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Ub E3 ligases that confer the substrate specificity have been grouped into two families; the HECT-domain family that is defined by its homology to E6-associated protein (E6AP) and the RING family carrying RING-finger domain that is essential for the Ub ligase activity (5Deshaies R.J.

One of the well defined RING E3 ligases is the Skp1/Cul1/F-box protein complex, in which Cul1 serves as a scaffold molecule that interacts with Skp1 and a small RING-finger protein Roc1, also known as Hrt1 and Rbx1 (7Kamura T. Koepp D.M. Conrad M.N. Skowyra D. Moreland R.J. Iliopoulos O. Lane W.S. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Elledge S.J. Conaway R.C. Harper J.W. Conaway J.W.

F-box proteins are recruited to the complex by binding to the Skp1 adaptor protein.At least six Cul members have been identified: Cul1, Cul2, Cul3, Cul4A, Cul4B, and Cul5 (10Kipreos E.T. Lander L.E. Wing J.P. He W.W. Hedgecock E.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Of these, Cul3 is known to mediate the degradation of several proteins, such as cyclin E (11Singer J.D. Gurian-West M. Clurman B. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2375-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), but the molecular composition of Cul3-based Ub ligase was unknown. Recently, a large family of proteins having BTB (Bric-a-brac/Tramtrack/Broad complex) domain has been identified as novel Cul3-interacting proteins (12Furukawa M. He Y.J. Borchers C. Xiong Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Most BTB proteins, but not all, have additional domains for protein-protein interaction, such as zinc fingers, Kelch repeats, and MATH motifs. Furthermore, a subset of proteins containing BTB domain has been identified to function as substrate-specific adaptors that bind to Cul3. Specifically, MEL-26, a homolog of human SPOP (speckle-type POZ protein) in Caenorhabditis elegans, was first identified as a BTB protein that serves as a specific adaptor of MEI-1 for the ubiquitination by Cul3-based Ub ligase and subsequent degradation by the proteasome (13Xu L. Wei Y. Reboul J. Vaglio P. Shin T.H. Vidal M. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Nature. 2003; 425: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). MEI-1 is a subunit of the katanin-like microtubule severing heterodimer MEI-1/MEI-2 that localizes to the spindles and the chromosomes during meiosis (14Srayko M. Buster D.W. Bazirgan O.A. McNally F.J. Mains P.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1072-1084PubMed Google Scholar). SPOP BTB protein has also been shown to mediate the ubiquitination of the Polycomb group BMI and the variant histone MacroH2A (15Hernandez-Munoz I. Lund A.H. van der Stoop P. Boutsma E. Muijrers I. Verhoeven E. Nusinow D.A. Panning B. Marahrens Y. van Lohuizen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7635-7640Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In addition, Keap1 BTB protein was shown to recruit Nrf2 to Cul3 (16Cullinan S.B. Gordan J.D. Jin J. Harper J.W. Diehl J.A. Mol. Cell.

Nrf2 is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of anti-oxidant genes upon oxidative stress. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Btb1p, Btb2p, and Btb3p interact with Cul3, but their functions remain unknown (20Geyer R. Wee S. Anderson S. Yates J. Wolf D.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 783-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Therefore, so far only a few protein substrates have been shown to interact with BTB proteins for their ubiquitination by Cul3-based Ub ligases.Daxx was originally identified as a protein that binds to the death domain of Fas receptor by yeast two-hybrid screening (21Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Daxx interacts with the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and promotes Fas-mediated apoptosis through the activation of Jun N-terminal kinase (22Chang H.Y. Nishitoh H. Yang X. Ichijo H. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1860-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have also shown that Daxx behaves as a pro-apoptotic protein under various stress conditions (21Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D.

Salomoni P. Ronchetti S. Guo A. Ruggero D. Pandolfi P.P. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). On the contrary, homozygous deletion of the Daxx gene has been shown to cause extensive apoptosis and embryonic lethality, suggesting that Daxx is an anti-apoptotic protein (26Michaelson J.S. Bader D. Kuo F. Kozak C. Leder P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1918-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Recent studies also support that Daxx is anti-apoptotic rather than pro-apoptotic (27Cermak L. Simova S. Pintzas A. Horejsi V. Andera L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7955-7961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 28Chen L.Y. Chen J.D. Mol. Cell.

Neoplasia. 2002; 4: 486-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Daxx also plays a role as a transcription regulator by interacting with various nuclear proteins involved in transcription. Daxx interacts with HDAC-II, core histones, and a chromatin-associated protein, Dek, suggesting that Daxx represses basal transcription through chromatin remodeling (30Hollenbach A.D. McPherson C.J. Mientjes E.J. Iyengar R. Grosveld G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Daxx has also been shown to form a ternary complex with homeodomain proteins Pax-3 and Pax-7 to inhibit transcription, whereas Pax-3/forkhead in human rhabdomyosarcoma (FKHR) fusion protein in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cells is resistant to Daxx inhibition (31Hollenbach A.D.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Similarly, Daxx interacts with ETS1 to repress transcriptional activation of the MMP1 gene (33Li R. Pei H. Watson D.K. Papas T.S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that Daxx suppresses cell death induced by p53 overexpression and p53-dependent stress response, thus acting as a negative regulator of p53 (34Zhao L.Y. Liu J. Sidhu G.S. Niu Y. Liu Y. Wang R. Liao D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50566-50579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the level of Daxx protein has been shown to decrease in HeLa cells upon induction of apoptosis by actinomycin D or exposure to UV (28Chen L.Y. Chen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7108-7121Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Moreover, Daxx has recently been shown to interact with SPOP (35La M. Kim K. Park J. Won J. Lee J.H. Fu Y.M. Meadows G.G. Joe C.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These reports suggest a possibility that the functions of Daxx can be regulated by proteolysis.In the present study we demonstrate that SPOP recruits Daxx to Cul3 and promotes the ubiquitination of Daxx and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. Moreover, SPOP/Cul3-mediated degradation of Daxx reversed Daxx-mediated repression of ETS1- and p53-dependent transcription. We also demonstrate that Daxx degradation triggers apoptosis. Taken together, we suggest that SPOP/Cul3-Ub E3 ligase plays an essential role in the control of Daxx level and, thus, in the regulation of Daxx-mediated cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and apoptosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids and Cells—pGL3-MMP1-Luc and various vectors expressing Daxx, p53, ETS1, and wild-type and mutant forms of human SPOP were prepared as described (35La M. Kim K. Park J. Won J. Lee J.H. Fu Y.M. Meadows G.G. Joe C.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). SPOP cDNA was cloned into pEYFP-C1 (BD Biosciences Clontech) and pcDNA3.1-Myc-His (Invitrogen). The cDNAs for SPOP deletion fragments were cloned into p3XFLAG-CMV10 (Sigma). The cDNAs for human Roc1 and Culs were cloned into pcDNA3-FLAG, and Ub cDNA was cloned into pcDNA4-HisMax (Invitrogen). To prevent Nedd8 modification of Cul3, Lys-711 was replaced by Ser using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The Tyr-62 residue of Cul3 was also replaced by Gly to prevent its interaction with SPOP. Mutagenesis was performed using pcDNA3-FLAG-Cul3 as the template and the following mutagenic primers: Y62G, 5′-G GAG CTC TAT AGA AAT GCA GGT ACA ATG GTT TTG CAT AAA CAT GG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CC ATG TTT ATG CAA AAC CAT TGT ACC TGC ATT TCT ATA GAG CTC C-3′ (reverse); K711S, 5′-GCT ATA GTG CGG ATA ATG CGA TCT AGA AAG AAG ATG CAG C-3′ (forward) and 5′-G CTG CAT CTT CTT TCT AGA TCG CAT TAT CCG CAC TAT AGC-3′ (reverse). 293T, HeLa, and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere. Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot—For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na2P2O7, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates were incubated with the appropriate antibodies for 2 h at 4°C and then with 50 μl of 50% slurry of protein A/G-Sepharose for the next hour. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot with mouse anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science), rabbit anti-HA-antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), mouse anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma), anti-Xpress antibody (Invitrogen), rabbit anti-Daxx-antibody (Calbiochem or Upstate), rabbit anti-Cul3-antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), or anti-SPOP antiserum. Rabbit polyclonal anti-SPOP antiserum was raised against a recombinant C-terminal fragment of SPOP (amino acids 162-375). For in vitro interaction assay, HA-Daxx, MycHis-SPOP, and FLAG-Cul3 were in vitro translated using [35S]Met and TNT quick-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). 35S-Labeled proteins (20 μl) were incubated for 2 h with anti-HA antibody and then pulled down by treatment with protein A/G-Sepharose beads. Precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography.Immunocytochemistry—HeLa cells plated on gelatin-coated cover-glasses were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature followed by permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. All subsequent dilutions and washes were carried out with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Nonspecific binding sites were saturated by incubation with a blocking solution (10% goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 1% gelatin in PBS) for 30 min. Cells were incubated with primary antibody for 1 h and washed with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 four times with 10-min intervals. They were then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h and washed 4 times with 10-min intervals. 4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole was used for counter-staining the nuclei. The cover-glasses were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Inc.), and cells were observed under a Zeiss Axioplan II microscope or Image Restoration Microscope (Applied Precision).Transcription Assay—For assaying the transcription of ETS1-dependent luciferase reporter gene, 293T cells were cultured on 24-well plates and transiently transfected with pGL3-MMP1-Luc and various combinations of expression vectors for HA-Daxx, FLAG-ETS1, FLAG-SPOP, FLAG-Cul3, and FLAG-Roc1. For assaying the transcription of p53-dependent luciferase reporter gene, PG13-Luc was used as a reporter vector. The luciferase (Luc) activity was then determined using a luciferase assay kit (Promega). Total amounts of transfected vector DNAs were kept constant by supplementing the appropriate amount of empty pcDNA vector. The luciferase activity was then normalized relative to the co-expressed β-galactosidase activity.Short Hairpin RNAs (shRNA) Construction and Reverse Transcription-PCR—SPOP-specific shRNAs were synthesized and cloned into pSi-lencer 3.0 vector driven by the human H1 promoter (Ambion) with the following target sequences: 1, sense, 5′-GAT CCG TTC CAG GCT CAC AAG GCT ATC TTC AAG AGA GAT AGC CTT GTG AGC CTG GAA ATT TTT TGG AAA-3′, and antisense, 5′-AGC TTT CCA AAA AAT TCC AGG CTC ACA AGG CTA TCT CTC TTG AAG ATA GCC TTG TGA GCC TGG AAC G-3′; 2, sense, 5′-G ATC CGC TAT CAT GCT TCG GAT GTC TTC AAG AGA GAC ATC CGA AGC ATG ATA GTT TTT TGG AAA-3′, and antisense, 5′-AG CTT TTC CAA AAA ACT ATC ATG CTT CGG ATG TCT CTC TTG AAG ACA TCC GAA GCA TGA TAG CG-3′. To knock down SPOP mRNA, HeLa cells were transfected with shRNA vectors or a negative control vector (shControl). Total RNAs were prepared from cells by extracting with Trizol (Invitrogen), and subjected to reverse transcription-PCR. Reverse transcription reactions were performed using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primer by following the manufacturer's instruction. SPOP mRNA was amplified with primers against the unique region of SPOP (5′-GCC CTG GAG CGC TTA AAG G-3′ and 5′-GGA TTG CTT CAG GCG TTT GC-3′), and β-actin mRNA was amplified as an expression control.Terminal Deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-fluorescein Nick End-labeling (TUNEL) Assay—HeLa cells cultured on cover-glasses were transfected with various combinations of expression vectors for SPOP, Cul3, Roc1, and Daxx. After incubation for 24 h, cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and subjected to TUNEL assay by following the manufacturer's instruction (Roche Applied Science). The cover-glasses were mounted in Vectashield, and cells with positive TUNEL staining were counted under a Zeiss Axioplan II microscope. The nuclei were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for counting total cell numbers.RESULTSInteraction of Human SPOP with Cul3—SPOP is a BTB protein that was initially identified as an auto-antigen of scleroderma patients (36Nagai Y. Kojima T. Muro Y. Hachiya T. Nishizawa Y. Wakabayashi T. Hagiwara M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To define the sites within the human SPOP and Cul3 proteins for their interaction, we first generated Cul3 mutants based on the previous reports. The replacement of Tyr-50 by Gly of Pcu3p, a Cul3 homolog in S. pombe, prevents its ability to interact with BTB proteins (20Geyer R. Wee S. Anderson S. Yates J. Wolf D.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 783-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The replacement of Lys-711 by Ser in human Cul3 blocks its modification by Nedd8 (37Hori T. Osaka F. Chiba T. Miyamoto C. Okabayashi K. Shimbara N. Kato S. Tanaka K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6829-6834Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 38Ou C.Y. Lin Y.F. Chen Y.J. Chien C.T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2403-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Therefore, mutagenesis was performed to generate Y62G (Tyr-62 in Cul3 corresponds to Tyr-50 in Pcu3p) and K711S (Fig. 1A, upper panel). HA-SPOP was expressed in 293T cells with FLAG-Cul3 or its mutant forms. Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody followed by immunoblot with anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibody. Wild-type Cul3, but not Y62G, was co-precipitated with SPOP (Fig. 1A, lower panel), indicating that Tyr-62 in human Cul3 is also essential for the interaction between Cul3 and SPOP. On the other hand, K711S could be co-precipitated with SPOP, indicating that the interaction between Cul3 and SPOP is independent of Nedd8 modification.SPOP has been shown to interact with Cul3 via BTB domain (12Furukawa M. He Y.J. Borchers C. Xiong Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). To determine whether BTB domain itself is sufficient for interaction with Cul3, various deletion mutants of SPOP were constructed (Fig. 1B, upper panel). HA-Cul3 was expressed in 293T cells with each of the FLAG-SPOP deletion mutants. The SPOP mutants that lack either the N-terminal MATH domain (indicated by m3) or the C-terminal region (m2) were co-immunoprecipitated with Cul3 (Fig. 1B, lower panel). Surprisingly, neither MATH domain (m1) nor BTB domain alone (m4) was capable of interacting with Cul3. Nor could the C-terminal region alone (m5) interact with Cul3. These results suggest that the N- or C-terminal sequence adjacent to BTB domain may also contribute to the interaction of SPOP with Cul3. Fig. 1C confirms that SPOP specifically interacts with Cul3 but not with the other Cul family members. Notably, SPOP ran as a doublet on the gel when expressed with Cul3 but not with the other Culs, and only one of the two bands interacted with Cul3. Therefore, we examined which of the SPOP doublet interacts with Cul3. We also examined whether SPOP interacts with any or both of Cul3 and its Nedd8-conjugated form and whether Daxx interacts with any or both of the SPOP doublet. Immunoprecipitation analysis shows that Cul3 interacted only with the slow-migrating form of SPOP (Fig. 1D, left panels), SPOP interacts with both Cul3 and its Nedd8-conjugated form (middle panel), and Daxx interacts with both of the SPOP doublet (right panel). However, the nature of the fast-migrating form of SPOP remains unknown, although it is unlikely that the fast-migrating form is a cleavage product of SPOP whose C-terminal fragment was removed, since the SPOP mutant (m2) that lacks the C-terminal 297-375 sequence is still capable of interacting with Cul3.SPOP-mediated Interaction of Daxx with Cul3—Daxx was shown to interact with the N-terminal MATH domain of SPOP (35La M. Kim K. Park J. Won J. Lee J.H. Fu Y.M. Meadows G.G. Joe C.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To determine whether SPOP can act as an adaptor for the interaction between Cul3 and Daxx, FLAG-Cul3 was expressed in 293T cells with HA-Daxx or both FLAG-SPOP and HA-Daxx. Immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody shows that Daxx interacts with Cul3 in the presence of SPOP but much more weakly in its absence (Fig. 2A). To confirm the requirement of SPOP for the interaction between Daxx and Cul3, HA-Daxx was expressed with FLAG-Cul3 or both HA-SPOP and FLAG-Cul3. Immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody again shows that Cul3 interacts with Daxx in the presence of SPOP but much more weakly in its absence (Fig. 2B). We then examined whether endogenous SPOP is also capable of interacting with Cul3 and Daxx. Lysates were obtained from 293T cells that had been treated with MG132. Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with anti-SPOP antibody shows that SPOP interacts with both endogenous Cul3 and Daxx (Fig. 2C). Thus, it is likely that the weak interaction between ectopically expressed Cul3 and Daxx, observed without overexpression of SPOP, is mediated by endogenous SPOP. To clarify further whether the interaction of Cul3 with Daxx is mediated by SPOP but not by their direct binding, HA-Daxx, MycHis-SPOP, and FLAG-Cul3 were in vitro translated in the presence of [35S]Met. The labeled proteins were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody. Cul3 was co-precipitated with Daxx only when SPOP is present (Fig. 2D), suggesting that Cul3 does not directly bind to Daxx. Collectively, these results demonstrate that SPOP functions as an adaptor protein that bridges Daxx to Cul3.FIGURE 2SPOP-mediated interaction of Daxx with Cul3. A, FLAG-Cul3 was expressed in 293T cells with HA-Daxx or both FLAG-SPOP and HA-Daxx. After incubation for 24 h, cells were treated with 20 μm MG132 for the next 4 h. Cell lysates were then subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-HA antibody followed by immunoblot with anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibody. The lysates were also probed with respective antibodies. B, HA-Daxx was expressed in cells with FLAG-Cul3 or both HA-SPOP and FLAG-Cul3. After culturing the cells as above, cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody followed by immunoblot with anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibody. The lysates were also probed with respective antibodies. C, 293T cells were treated with 20 μm MG132 for 4 h. Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-SPOP antibody followed by immunoblot with anti-Daxx, anti-Cul3, or anti-SPOP antibody. D, indicated combinations of in vitro translated 35S-labeled HA-Daxx, MycHis-SPOP, and FLAG-Cul3 were incubated for 2 h at 4°C. After incubation, the samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody followed by autoradiography. The asterisks indicate a nonspecific band.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether Daxx co-localizes in cells with Cul3 through their interaction with SPOP, HeLa cells were transfected with each or varied combinations of expression vectors for the proteins. Immunocytochemical analysis reveals that Cul3, which alone localizes predominantly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3A), was recruited to the nucleus and co-localized as speckles with SPOP upon co-expression with SPOP (Fig. 3B). Likewise, Daxx, which alone resides throughout the nucleoplasm, was recruited to nuclear speckles upon co-expression with SPOP. Co-expression of Daxx with both Cul3 and SPOP resulted in co-localization of all three proteins within the nucleus but as clump-like structures that appear distinct from nuclear speckles. Without expression of SPOP, however, Cul3 remained in the cytoplasm, whereas Daxx was found throughout the nucleoplasm as if each was expressed separately. These results further demonstrate that SPOP serves as an adaptor molecule that recruits Cul3 to the nucleus for interaction with Daxx.FIGURE 3Co-localization of Cul3, Daxx, and SPOP. Each (A) or indicated combinations of differentially tagged Daxx, Cul3, and SPOP (B) were expressed in HeLa cells. Cells were then stained with respective antibodies. The bar indicates 10 μm.

Chen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7108-7121Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In an attempt to determine whether Daxx is ubiquitinated by Cul3-based Ub ligase for degradation by the proteasome, Cul3 or its mutant forms were expressed in 293T cells with SPOP and Roc1. Fig. 4A shows that Daxx level is markedly reduced by expression of wild-type Cul3 but much less significantly by that of Y62G or K711S. These results suggest that the degradation of Daxx requires the interaction of Cul3 with SPOP in addition to Nedd8 modification of Cul3. However, Daxx level in cells expressing Y62G or K711S with SPOP was also lower than that in cells expressing Daxx only. Thus, the partial degradation of Daxx that occurred in cells expressing Y62G or K711S with SPOP might be mediated by the interaction of endogenous Cul3 with SPOP.FIGURE 4Requirement of SPOP for Daxx degradation. A, FLAG-tagged wild-type Cul3, Y62G, or K711S was expressed in 293T cells with HA-Daxx, FLAG-SPOP, and FLAG-Roc1. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot with respective antibodies. As a control, β-actin was identified by using anti-β-actin antibody. B, FLAG-tagged SPOP (wt) or its deletion mutants (m2 or m3) were expressed in cells with HA-Daxx, FLAG-Cul3, and FLAG-Roc1. They were then probed as above. C, HA-Daxx was expressed in cells with or without FLAG-tagged SPOP, Cul3, an"

As a result, they are responsible for the initiation of local immune responses, which may be crucial for prevention of invasive infection. Here we show that epithelial cells detect the presence of bacterial pore-forming toxins (including pneumolysin from Streptococcus pneumoniae, α-hemolysin from Staphylococcus aureus, streptolysin O from Streptococcus pyogenes, and anthrolysin O from Bacillus anthracis) at nanomolar concentrations, far below those required to cause cytolysis. Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK appears to be a conserved response of epithelial cells to subcytolytic concentrations of bacterial poreforming toxins, and this activity is inhibited by the addition of high molecular weight osmolytes to the extracellular medium. By sensing osmotic stress caused by the insertion of a sublethal number of pores into their membranes, epithelial cells may act as an early warning system to commence an immune response, while the local density of toxin-producing bacteria remains low. Osmosensing may thus represent a novel innate immune response to a common bacterial virulence strategy.

Elaboration of pore-forming toxins (PFT) 2The abbreviations used are: PFT, pore-forming toxins; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; IL, interleukin; Ply, pneumolysin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TLR4, toll-like receptor-4; HEK, human embryonic kidney 293; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; BAPTA/AM, 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid/tetra(acetoxymethyl) ester; SLO, streptolysin O; ALO, anthrolysin O, ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. is a common theme in bacterial pathogenesis. Many distantly related species produce protein toxins capable of puncturing eukaryotic membranes, suggesting that this strategy may be an example of convergent evolution. However, the PFT are a heterogeneous group made up of several distinct structural classes. Typically PFT are secreted as monomers, which insert into host cell membranes, form homo-oligomers, and finally lead to the disruption of membrane integrity (1Burns D.L. Bacterial Protein Toxins. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2003Crossref Google Scholar). The consequences of pore formation for the host cell may be dire, leading to cell death by rupture or to the induction of apoptosis (2Braun J.S. Sublett J.E. Freyer D. Mitchell T.J. Cleveland J.L. Tuomanen E.I. Weber J.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). This cytolysis may, in turn, confer a survival advantage to the bacterium allowing it to better adhere to the damaged cells, to enter previously inaccessible sites, or to escape immune responses. In many cases, most notably the major Gram-positive pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes, PFT are essential for full virulence of the organism, although their precise mechanisms of action in vivo are not well understood (3Berry A.M. Yother J. Briles D.E. Hansman D. Paton J.C. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 2037-2042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kernodle D.S. Voladri R.K. Menzies B.E. Hager C.C. Edwards K.M. Infect.

Here we show that respiratory epithelial cells, the initial point of contact between many common bacterial pathogens and their human hosts, respond to sublytic, nanomolar concentrations of distinct classes of bacterial PFT through phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic protein p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Activation of p38 MAPK during bacterial infection has been shown to be crucial to local production of cytokines such as the chemokine interleukin (IL)-8 (6Ratner A.J. Lysenko E.S. Paul M.N. Weiser J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3429-3434Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and to the development of an effective immune response in vivo (7van den Blink B. Juffermans N.P. ten Hove T. Schultz M.J. van Deventer S.J. van der Poll T. Peppelenbosch M.P. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In this regard, we have observed previously that S. pneumoniae strains that lack the PFT pneumolysin (Ply) induce lower chemokine responses associated with diminished neutrophil influx and delayed clearance in a murine model of mucosal colonization (8van Rossum A.M. Lysenko E.S. Weiser J.N. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 7718-7726Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Our findings are also consistent with the observation that survival of Caenorhabditis elegans challenged with PFT appears to be critically dependent on its ability to activate members of the MAPK family (9Huffman D.L. Abrami L. Sasik R. Corbeil J. van der Goot F.G. Aroian R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10995-11000Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that toxin-induced p38 MAPK activation requires pore formation and is inhibited by relief of osmotic stress. This finding demonstrates a role for the epithelium in detection of bacterial PFT at sublytic concentrations and has implications for understanding the early stages of immune responses to bacterial products during colonization or disease.

Epithelial Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—A549 (CCL-185), Detroit 562 (CCL-138), and human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK, CRL-1573) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. Bacterial Stimulation of Epithelial Cells and p38 MAPK Western Blot—A549, HEK, or Detroit 562 cells grown to confluence in 6-well plates were weaned from serum and antibiotics overnight. Bacteria were grown in liquid culture to mid-log phase (A620 = 0.5), collected by centrifugation, washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in DMEM without serum or antibiotics. Serial dilutions were plated to confirm bacterial density. 1 × 107 colony-forming units/ml of S. pneumoniae or S. aureus was added to the epithelial monolayer (multiplicity of infection =∼10). In some experiments, PBS-washed bacteria were sonicated prior to use. Also, where indicated, bacterial toxins or purified TNF-α, diluted to the indicated concentrations in DMEM, were added to the cells in lieu of bacteria. Plates were spun at 150 × g for 5 min to apply bacteria to epithelial cells and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for the indicated incubation periods. After washing with sterile PBS, cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 with protease and phosphatase inhibitors, and aliquots were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed using the PhosphoPlus p38 MAPK antibody kit (Cell Signaling). Duplicate samples were run on separate gels for detection of total and phosphorylated p38 MAPK. Blots were not stripped and reprobed, although we repeated a subset of experiments using the technique of probing a membrane for phospho-p38 MAPK, stripping it, and reprobing for total p38 MAPK. In no case did this alter our observed results. In some experiments, A549 cells were loaded with BAPTA/AM (10 μm, Invitrogen) for 45 min at 37 °C, washed twice with PBS, and incubated in fresh DMEM for 45 min prior to stimulation. In experiments using dextran or cellulose (20 μm average particle size) and purified PFT, these reagents were added simultaneously. Because HEK cells adhere poorly if weaned from serum, unweaned cells were used in experiments with this cell line. Because A549 cells detach if incubated at 37 °C in the presence of EGTA, experiments using EGTA were carried out at room temperature. In all cases, epithelial cell viability exceeded 95%. As an independent marker for cell damage or death, release of lactate dehydrogenase into supernatants of cells exposed to toxins for 45 min at 37 °C was assessed using a commercial kit (Roche Applied Science). Positive control lysis was with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Interleukin-8 Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—A549 cells were grown to confluence in 96-well plates and incubated in serum-free DMEM overnight. Quadruplicate wells were treated with Ply or PdB diluted to the indicated concentrations in serum-free DMEM. Where indicated, pretreatment of cells with 20 mm SB203580 (Calbiochem) was for 30 min at 37 °C, and SB203580 was present during incubation of A549 cells with toxin or toxoid preparations. After 18 h, supernatants were removed, and the concentration of IL-8 was determined using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Pharmingen OptEIA). Conditions were compared by one-way analysis of variance with Tukey test for multiple comparisons (Prism GraphPad software). Hemolytic Assay—Purified Ply or PdB was diluted in PBS. 80 μl of diluted toxin was added to 160 μl of lysis buffer (PBS plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm dithiothreitol) and 80 μl of PBS-washed horse erythrocytes (2%) in a 96-well V-bottom plate. The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 150 × g for 10 min; then supernatants were collected. Optical density at 415 nm was recorded in a plate reader (Bio-Rad). Triplicate wells at each concentration were assayed, and each experiment was repeated at least three times. In some experiments, 5 mm EGTA was added to the buffer prior to the addition of toxin or erythrocytes. MgCl2 or CaCl2 in PBS was added to the buffer along with EGTA to give indicated concentrations. PFT Are Necessary and Sufficient for Activation of p38 MAPK—Previous studies have demonstrated activation of p38 MAPK in the setting of pneumococcal pneumonia as an essential component of host control of bacterial replication in the lung (7van den Blink B.

In addition, activation of p38 MAPK in human cells in vitro by S. pneumoniae has been described (12Monier R.M. Orman K.L. Meals E.A. English B.K. J. Infect.

Bergmann F. Balshusemann C. Lee U. Zysk G. Mitchell T.J. Keller B.U. Kuhnt U. Gerber J. Spreer A. Bahr M. Michel U. Nau R. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 11: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) reported activation of p38 MAPK and calciumdependent cell death in neuroblastoma cells treated with purified Ply and speculated on its relevance to the pathogenesis of pneumococcal meningitis. Likewise, S. aureus activation of host p38 MAPK has been recognized but not attributed to the pore-forming nature of its α-hemolysin (15Ratner A.J. Bryan R. Weber A. Nguyen S. Barnes D. Pitt A. Gelber S. Cheung A. Prince A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19267-19275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). S. pyogenes has been reported to activate osteoblasts and keratinocytes via p38 MAPK, but the importance of streptolysin O (SLO) in these systems is not addressed (16Chung W.O. Dale B.A. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 17Okahashi N. Sakurai A. Nakagawa I. Fujiwara T. Kawabata S. Amano A. Hamada S. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 948-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because it is required for synergistic enhancement of epithelial cytokine production during polymicrobial infection (6Ratner A.J. Lysenko E.S. Paul M.N. Weiser J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3429-3434Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that pneumolysin, the single protein toxin of S. pneumoniae, might be sufficient to induce p38 MAPK phosphorylation in respiratory epithelial cells. Treatment of A549 respiratory epithelial cells with S. pneumoniae D39, but not its isogenic Ply-deficient mutant D39ply, led to the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 1A). To assess whether this was a property specific to S. pneumoniae and its toxin, we performed a similar experiment using S. aureus, another major Gram-positive pathogen. Importantly, although S. aureus does produce pore-forming toxins, of which α-hemolysin is the most abundant (7van den Blink B. Juffermans N.P. ten Hove T. Schultz M.J. van Deventer S.J. van der Poll T. Peppelenbosch M.P. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), these are structurally unrelated to Ply and form considerably smaller pores in eukaryotic cells. Despite these differences, we found that wild-type S. aureus RN6390 activated epithelial p38 MAPK in a manner similar to S. pneumoniae. Correspondingly, the isogenic α-hemolysin-deficient mutant RN6390hla was attenuated in its ability to activate epithelial p38 MAPK (Fig. 1B). To confirm that PFT were sufficient as well as necessary for activation of epithelial p38 MAPK in response to Gram-positive bacteria, we stimulated epithelial cells with purified S. aureus α-hemolysin, Ply, or other members of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin family, SLO and ALO (Fig. 2). In each case, purified PFT were sufficient to cause p38 phosphorylation in epithelial cells and required either high ng/ml or low μg/ml quantities (corresponding to nanomolar concentrations). These in vitro results correlate with and may account for our previous observations that Ply-expressing but not non-expressing S. pneumoniae induce mucosal production of macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (a murine homolog of interleukin-8) and subsequent recruitment of neutrophils during murine nasopharyngeal colonization (8van Rossum A.M. Lysenko E.S. Weiser J.N. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 7718-7726Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). At the toxin concentrations used, epithelial cell viability was unaffected and exceeded 95% as assessed by trypan blue exclusion. In addition, lactate dehydrogenase release from A549 cells treated with toxins at these concentrations was <5% of the positive control lysis in all cases (data not shown). At a 10-fold higher concentration of Ply (1 μg/ml), we noted release of >65% of total cellular lactate dehydrogenase. Thus, we found that subcytolytic concentrations of each toxin led to increased p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was detectable within 15 min after exposure of cells to toxin and reached its maximal level by 30 min (Fig. 2E). Likewise, we noted p38 MAPK phosphorylation in response to Ply in an unrelated cell line, Detroit 562 nasopharyngeal cells, suggesting that these effects were not specific to A549 cells (Fig. 2F). We attempted to confirm p38 MAPK phosphorylation in response to PFT in primary murine epithelial cells but were hampered by endogenous phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, making differences difficult to assess (data not shown). Toxin-mediated Pore Formation Activates p38 MAPK—It has been proposed that some PFT have effects on eukaryotic cells that are independent of pore formation. Specifically, Ply and other members of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins are putative ligands for the host pattern-recognition molecule toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) independent of their pore-forming activities (18Malley R. Henneke P. Morse S.C. Cieslewicz M.J. Lipsitch M. Thompson C.M. Kurt-Jones E. Paton J.C. Wessels M.R. Golenbock D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Med. 2004; 200: 1647-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 20Srivastava A. Henneke P. Visintin A. Morse S.C. Martin V. Watkins C. Paton J.C. Wessels M.R. Golenbock D.T. Malley R. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 6479-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Non-hemolytic Ply toxoids are equally efficient compared with native Ply as TLR4 agonists (18Malley R. Henneke P. Morse S.C. Cieslewicz M.J. Lipsitch M. Thompson C.M. Kurt-Jones E. Paton J.C. Wessels M.R. Golenbock D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1966-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Because S. aureus and S. pneumoniae produce PFT that are not structurally related, yet both induce epithelial p38 MAPK phosphorylation, we hypothesized that pore formation, rather than recognition of specific toxin motifs, might be an essential step in the p38 MAPK response to toxins. We used the Ply toxoid PdB, which has a point mutation in the region that is essential for pore formation, to distinguish the pore-forming properties of Ply from its potential action on receptors such as TLR4. PdB inserts into cholesterol-containing membranes and oligomerizes but does not form functional pores (21Korchev Y.E. Bashford C.L. Pederzolli C. Pasternak C.A. Morgan P.J. Andrew P.W. Mitchell T.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To confirm the non-cytolytic quality of PdB, we used an assay of horse erythrocyte hemolysis (Fig. 3A). Measurement of hemoglobin release from horse erythrocytes is a convenient measure of pore formation, although it takes place at substantially lower doses than the ones relevant to epithelial cell stimulation. Treatment of A549 cells with purified Ply, but not with equivalent concentrations of PdB, led to the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained using HEK cells, which lack TLR2 and TLR4 (22Nonnenmacher C. Dalpke A. Zimmermann S. Flores-De-Jacoby L. Mutters R. Heeg K. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 850-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), suggesting that the mechanism of p38 activation is independent of these receptors (data not shown). This finding as well as the observation that structurally unrelated PFT activate p38 MAPK suggests that pore formation, rather than any effect of Ply or PdB on TLR4-mediated signaling, is the mechanism of toxin-induced activation of this host cell pathway. Epithelial IL-8 Response to PFT Requires p38 MAPK Activity—Consistent with these findings, treatment of epithelial cells with Ply but not PdB led to the release of interleukin-8, a chemokine that functions as a potent neutrophil attractant. The chemical inhibitor of p38 MAPK activity, SB203580, was sufficient to reduce or abolish this response (Fig. 3C). Activation of ERK1/2 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) were also detected in response to PFT (data not shown). However, we focused our investigations on the mechanism of the p38 MAPK response because SB203580 inhibited epithelial IL-8 release in response to microbial products (Fig. 3C and Ref. 6Ratner A.J. Lysenko E.S. Paul M.N. Weiser J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3429-3434Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Divalent Cations Enhance Toxin-mediated Pore Formation—Studies of the effects of purified Ply on neutrophils have suggested a role for extracellular calcium in the initiation of host cell responses. Typically, chelation of divalent cations using EGTA has been associated with the inhibition of Ply-mediated effects. The mechanism of this effect has been hypothesized to involve entry of Ca2+ ions through Ply pores (23Fickl H. Cockeran R. Steel H.C. Feldman C. Cowan G. Mitchell T.J. Anderson R. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2005; 140: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 24Cockeran R. Durandt C. Feldman C. Mitchell T.J. Anderson R. J. Infect. Dis. 2002; 186: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 25Cockeran R. Steel H.C. Mitchell T.J. Feldman C. Anderson R. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 3494-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 26Cockeran R. Theron A.J. Steel H.C. Matlola N.M. Mitchell T.J. Feldman C. Anderson R. J. Infect. Dis. 2001; 183: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This is consistent with studies of PFT from Escherichia coli, showing that the insertion of pores into host cell membranes can induce calcium oscillations and transient currents that may activate host cell signaling pathways (27Uhlen P. Laestadius A. Jahnukainen T. Soderblom T. Backhed F. Celsi G. Brismar H. Normark S. Aperia A. Richter-Dahlfors A. Nature. 2000; 405: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We further investigated the role of divalent cations in Ply-induced host cell signaling. Chelation of extracellular divalent cations with EGTA eliminated the ability of Ply to induce p38 MAPK phosphorylation in A549 cells (Fig. 4A). However, this finding did not clarify whether the presence of divalent cations was important for pore formation or was a downstream effect essential for p38 MAPK activation (such as entry of cations through Ply pores). To explore this further, we used the cell-permeant acetoxymethyl ester of BAPTA, a related cation chelator. Consistent with the hypothesis that pore formation, rather than cation flux, is important for the activation of p38 MAPK by bacterial PFT, chelation of intracellular divalent cations with BAPTA/AM had no effect on Ply-mediated p38 MAPK activation (Fig. 4B). Concentrations of BAPTA/AM used in these experiments have been shown previously to efficiently inhibit Ca2+-dependent pathways in epithelial cells (15Ratner A.J. Bryan R. Weber A. Nguyen S. Barnes D. Pitt A. Gelber S. Cheung A. Prince A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19267-19275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In our system, BAPTA/AM did enhance phosphorylation of ERK in A549 cells treated with thapsigargin (1 μm, 15 min) (data not shown) as described previously in hepatic epithelial cells (28Maloney J.A. Tsygankova O.M. Yang L. Li Q. Szot A. Baysal K. Williamson J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C221-C230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EGTA chelation of extracellular divalent cations also increased the concentration of Ply needed to achieve the lysis of horse erythrocytes relative to conditions in which divalent cations were present (Fig. 4C), suggesting that these cations may be a previously unrecognized requirement for efficient formation of its pores. To confirm the dependence of this effect on the chelation capacity of EGTA, we added Mg2+ or Ca2+ salts in the presence of EGTA. Addition of either MgCl2 or CaCl2 increased the efficiency of Ply-mediated hemolysis. This is consistent with findings related to another unrelated PFT, α-latrotoxin, which requires divalent cations for efficient pore formation (29Orlova E.V. Rahman M.A. Gowen B. Volynski K.E. Ashton A.C. Manser C. van Heel M. Ushkaryov Y.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Previous studies of Ply pores demonstrated that small- and medium-sized Ply channels are gated by divalent cations, whereas large ones are insensitive to the effects of these cations (21Korchev Y.E. Bashford C.L. Pederzolli C. Pasternak C.A. Morgan P.J. Andrew P.W. Mitchell T.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 30Korchev Y.E. Bashford C.L. Pasternak C.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 127: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that it may be the larger, cation-insensitive pores that are responsible for the majority of cellular effects, including erythrocyte lysis and epithelial p38 MAPK activation. Epithelial Cells Sense PFT via Osmotic Stress—Because p38 MAPK phosphorylation is involved in osmotic stress sensation (31Uhlik M.T. Abell A.N. Johnson N.L. Sun W. Cuevas B.D. Lobel-Rice K.E. Horne E.A. Dell'Acqua M.L. Johnson G.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that activation of p38 MAPK by PFT might be a consequence of cellular processes normally used to sense membrane integrity. If that were the case, relief of osmotic stress caused by the sublethal disruption of membrane integrity by PFT ought to ameliorate p38 activation. We used high molecular weight dextran (Mr ∼167,000) larger than the cut-off size shown previously to enter through pores created by a related toxin, SLO (32Walev I. Hombach M. Bobkiewicz W. Fenske D. Bhakdi S. Husmann M. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 237-239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dextrans of this size are sufficient to inhibit toxin-induced hemolysis through osmotic protection (21Korchev Y.E. Bashford C.L. Pederzolli C. Pasternak C.A. Morgan P.J. Andrew P.W. Mitchell T.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Addition of high molecular weight dextran to the extracellular medium efficiently inhibited the p38 response of cells to Ply (Fig. 5A) or to S. aureus α-hemolysin (Fig. 5B) but not to TNF-α treatment (Fig. 5B), consistent with the hypothesis that osmosensing plays an important role in this epithelial response to PFT. The absence of an effect on TNF-mediated p38 MAPK phosphorylation suggests that the effect of dextran is specific to signaling initiated by PFT. Likewise, a suspension of cellulose particles of 20-μm diameter inhibited the response to PFT (Fig. 5C). In contrast, osmolytes of smaller sizes such as sucrose (50-150 mm), which would be expected to enter through the Ply pore, did not inhibit p38 MAPK phosphorylation in response to PFT (data not shown). Inhibition of p38 MAPK phosphorylation by dextran or cellulose makes it unlikely that impurities in any of our toxin preparations are responsible for the effects observed, as does the difference in response between Ply and PdB, both of which were purified from E. coli under identical conditions but exhibited strikingly different activities with respect to phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. Our finding of cross-talk between mechanisms of pathogen recognition and epithelial osmosensing is a novel observation. Additionally, detection of sublytic, nanomolar concentrations of bacterial PFT may provide a mechanism for epithelial cells to initiate proinflammatory responses early in infection when the bacterial density is still low. These observations have implications for our understanding of immune responses to pathogens at mucosal surfaces. Pathways that sense cell stress may represent a novel arm of the mucosal innate immune response.

We found high-level expression of PPARγ in embryo mouse brain and neural stem cells (NSCs), in contrast to extremely low levels in adult mouse brain. Here, we show that PPARγ mediates the proliferation and differentiation of murine NSCs via up-regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor and activation of the ERK pathway. Cell growth rates of NSCs prepared from heterozygous PPARγ-deficient mouse brains, PPARγ-RNA-silenced NSCs, and PPARγ dominant-negative NSCs were significantly decreased compared with those of wild-type NSCs. Physiological concentrations of PPARγ agonists, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, stimulated NSC growth, whereas antagonists caused cell death in a concentration-dependent manner via activation of the caspase cascade. The stimulation of cell growth by PPARγ was associated with a rapid activation of the ERK pathway by phosphorylation and up-regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor and cyclin B protein levels. In contrast, activation of PPARγ by agonists inhibited the differentiation of NSCs into neurons. The inhibition of differentiation was associated with an activation of STAT3.

These reports suggest that the PPARγ pathway plays important roles in regulating cellular function and tissue homeostasis. The effects of PPARγ on cellular proliferation and differentiation are potentially important to tissues such as the central nervous system that are critically dependent upon an ability to exhibit regeneration postinjury. In the central nervous system, most self-renewal is dependent upon neural stem cells (NSCs) that can be isolated from embryonic brains. NSCs are multipotent and self-renewing progenitor cells that can differentiate into neurons and glial cells (7Temple S. Nature. 2001; 414: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar, 8Reh T.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 392-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 9Song H-J. Stevens C.F. Gage F.H. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 438-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). As such, NSCs are expected to be of utility in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, nerve injury, stroke, and multiple sclerosis. Likewise, NSCs are not only considered the main source of neurons but are also useful for investigating central nervous system development in vitro. Therefore, many studies have been performed regarding the mechanisms or factors involved in the proliferation and differentiation of NSCs (10Torii M. Matsuzaki F. Osumi N. Kaibuchi K. Nakamura S. Casarosa S. Guillemot F. Nakafuku M. Development. 1999; 126: 443-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kaneko Y. Sakakibara S. Imai T. Suzuki A. Nakamura Y. Sawamoto K. Ogawa Y. Toyama Y. Miyata T.

Milanesi G. Pelicci G. Cattaneo E. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, no studies have been reported about the role of PPARγ in NSC functions. Therefore, we tried to investigate the novel hypothesis that PPARγ might play a role in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of murine NSCs. We found high-level expression of PPARγ in embryo mouse brain and NSCs. In contrast, extremely low levels were observed in adult mouse brain (Fig. 1, B and C). In this study, we investigated the role of PPARγ in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of murine NSCs into neurons. Whereas optimal activation of the PPARγ pathway stimulated NSC proliferation and inhibited differentiation of NSCs into neurons, inhibition or deficiency of PPARγ was associated with an inhibition of NSC proliferation and subsequent apoptosis via activation of the caspase cascade. Because excessive activation of the PPARγ pathway also caused death of NSCs, these results indicate that NSC expansion pre-differentiation to neurons is highly dependent upon PPARγ at a critical threshold level of signaling. These studies have important implications for understanding central nervous system development and the therapy of neurodegenerative disorders that require nerve cell replenishment.

The brain was removed from the embryo and placed in culture medium that consisted of the following: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 medium (Invitrogen) containing 0.6% glucose, 0.1% NaHCO3, 5 mm HEPES, 100 μg/ml bovine transferrin (Invitrogen), 25 μg/ml bovine insulin (Sigma), 10 μg/ml putrescine (Sigma), 30 nm sodium selenite (Sigma), 20 nm progesterone (Sigma), 20 ng/ml human EGF (PeproTech EC), 20 ng/ml human fibroblast growth factor (PeproTech E), 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). The cells were dissociated by mechanical dispersion with a fire-narrowed Pasteur pipette. After centrifugation, cells were re-suspended in culture medium. Primary stem cell proliferation was observed after 7-8 days. The neurospheres were collected, gently triturated with a fire-narrowed Pasteur pipette, and subcultured at a density <5 × 104 cells/ml in a culture bottle (Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL). Confirmation of NSCs was performed by the detection of nestin expression and neurosphere formation (12Conti L. Sipione S. Magrassi L. Bonfanti L. Rigamonti D. Pettirossi V. Peschanski M. Haddad B.

A wild-type pregnant BALB/c female mated with a PPARγ+/- male mouse was also used to prepare heterogeneous PPARγ knock-out (PPARγ+/-) NSCs. Confirmation of heterozygous PPARγ knock-out (PPARγ+/-) clones was performed by PCR of genomic DNA from each clone. The maintenance of the undifferentiated state of NSCs was performed in non-coated culture bottles (Nalge Nunc). Cell Culture of Neural Stem Cells for Differentiation and Treatment with Agonists and Antagonists—NSCs formed neurospheres in non-coated culture bottles, representing a state of undifferentiation. When cultured on poly-l-ornithine/laminin-coated plates (Biocoat, Becton Dickinson Labware, Bedford, MA), NSCs adhered to the plates, proliferated, extended their neurites, and differentiated into neurons (12Conti L. Sipione S. Magrassi L. Bonfanti L. Rigamonti D. Pettirossi V. Peschanski M. Haddad B. Pelicci P. Milanesi G. Pelicci G. Cattaneo E. Nat.

Treatment with PPARγ agonists, antagonists, or vehicle control (dimethyl sulfoxide) was started when NSCs were dissociated and scattered on the ornithine/laminin-coated plates or in non-coated culture bottles. Three days after treatment, morphological changes and the rate of cell growth were investigated. Evaluation of Cell Growth—After NSCs were treated with PPARγ agonists, antagonist, or vehicle for 3 days, MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) solution (Sigma) was added to the culture medium and the cells were incubated. SDS (20%) was then added, and absorbance at a wavelength of 595 nm was measured. The cell growth rate was expressed as a percentage compared with the vehicle control. In another set of experiments, NSCs were cultured on non-coated bottles after treatment with reagents. Various neuroblastoma-like cell lines, such as NB1 (human neuroblastoma), NB2a (mouse neuroblastoma), C1300N18 (mouse neuroblastoma), and SH-SY5Y (human neuroblastoma), were also used to evaluate cell growth in comparison to the NSCs. Chromatin Staining for Detection of Apoptosis—NSCs treated with PPARγ agonists or antagonists were cultured on poly-l-ornithine/laminin-coated Lab-Tek II Chamber Slides (Nalge Nunc International) for 24 h. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min and rinsed. Chromatin staining was performed with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) to detect nuclear condensation (a morphological change associated with apoptosis) and the cells were observed using a fluorescence microscope (IX 70, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Western Blotting Analysis for Detection of Activated Caspase—The cells were collected and homogenized in lysis buffer containing a mixture of protease inhibitors. Cell extracts, prepared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g, were resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis was performed. The detection was performed by using an ECL Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences). Evaluation of Differentiation—NSCs were treated with PPARγ agonists or antagonist, and cultured on poly-l-ornithine/laminin-coated Lab-Tek II Chamber Slides for 3 days. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min, and rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline. The fixed cells were incubated with anti-MAP2 or anti-nestin antibody for 16 h at 4 °C, and then visualized with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Nuclear staining was performed by incubation with SYTOX™ Orange (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and NSCs were observed using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (MRC1024, Nippon Bio-Rad). Preparation of Genomic DNA and PCR Amplification—Genomic DNA was prepared by standard procedures with SDS/proteinase K digestion overnight, extraction with phenol/chloroform, and precipitation with ethanol. To detect wild-type and knock-out alleles in DNA derived from tail tips, PCR was performed with Taq DNA polymerase (Sigma) using standard PCR mixtures containing purified genomic DNA and 10 pmol each of following three primers, 5′-TCCACTTCAGAAATTACC-3′, 5′-ACTTTGGTATTCTTGGAG-3′, and 5′-GCCACCAAAGAACGGAGCCG-3′, in 20 μl of mixture. The mixture was heated at 95 °C for 3 min, subjected to 40 cycles of 45 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 52 °C, and 45 s at 72 °C, with an extra 3-min incubation at 72 °C after the last cycle. The PCR products were determined by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis in a 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer. Preparation of Lentiviral Vector Expressing Short Hairpin RNA (shRNA) against PPARγ and Transduction into NSCs—Vectors were constructed by using standard cloning procedures. pHM5-H1 was designed to express shRNA when an appropriate sequence was inserted into the BglII/XbaI sites. Oligonucleotides encoding both strands of the targeting sequence were annealed and ligated into BglII/XbaI sites in pHM5-H1 (17Katayama K. Wada K. Miyoshi H. Ohashi K. Tachibana M. Furuki R. Mizuguchi H. Hayakawa T. Nakajima A. Kadowaki T. Tsutsumi Y. Nakagawa S. Kamisaki Y. Mayumi T. FEBS Lett. 2004; 560: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The sequence was verified on a DNA sequencer (ABI PRISM 310, Applied Biosystems) and the cassette containing the H1 promoter plus the shRNA was transferred to the self-inactivating lentiviral vector construct generating CS-H1-shRNA-EG. Because it is difficult to maintain the constant expression or deficiency of target genes in bone marrow cells or stem cells using Lipofectin or common virus vectors such as adenovirus or herpesvirus, we used the method of lentiviral vector-mediated transduction of target genes into NSCs. Lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein were prepared in accordance with methods reported previously (15Miyoshi H. Smith K.A. Mosier D.E. Verma I.M. Torbett B.E. Science. 1999; 283: 682-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 16Hanaoka-Tahara S. Sudo K. Ema H. Miyoshi H. Nakauchi H. Exp. Hematol. 2002; 30: 11-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells were transfected with four plasmids: a packaging construct (pMDLg/pRRE), a vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein-expressing construct (pMD.G), a Rev-expressing construct (pRSV-Rev), and the self-inactivating vector construct (CS-H1-shRNA-EG). Vector supernatants were concentrated by ultracentrifugation and the pellet resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution. Vector titers, which can be detected by EGFP expression under control of a human elongation factor 1-α subunit gene promoter, were determined by infection of HeLa cells with serial dilutions of the vector stocks, followed by FACS analysis for EGFP-positive cells (data not shown). We have previously reported two effective shRNA sequences, shRNA-P15 (GTCTGCTGATCTGCGAGCC) and -P17 (GTTTGAGTTTGCTGTGAAG), to suppress PPARγ RNA, and one ineffective sequence, shRNA-P18 (ATGAGCCTTCACCCCCTGC). We, therefore, used shRNA-P15 and -P17 as effective sequences to inhibit PPARγ RNA, and shRNA-P18 and -Lu (shRNA against firefly luciferase) as negative controls (17Katayama K. Wada K. Miyoshi H. Ohashi K. Tachibana M. Furuki R. Mizuguchi H. Hayakawa T. Nakajima A. Kadowaki T. Tsutsumi Y. Nakagawa S. Kamisaki Y. Mayumi T. FEBS Lett. 2004; 560: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). NSCs were dissociated by mechanical dispersion with a fire-narrowed Pasteur pipette, the remaining neurospheres were removed by filtration through filters of 70-μm pore size (Cell Strainer, FALCON) and scattered at 5 × 104 cells/ml into 12-well non-coated plates. NSCs were then infected with viral stocks at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 2.5 to 40, followed by FACS analysis to determine the transduction efficiency. Increases in EGFP expression in NSCs were observed in a viral concentration-dependent manner. Under the conditions used, transduction efficiency was almost 80% and >95% at m.o.i. of 10 and 20, respectively. The cell growth rate was measured by MTT assay after 5 days of infection and expressed as a percentage compared with that of non-infected NSCs. Preparation of Lentiviral Vector Expressing Mutated (Dominant-negative) PPARγ and Its Transduction Into NSCs—A 1.4-kb fragment of murine PPARγ1 cDNA (wild-type PPARγ, WT-PPARγ) was isolated from an intestinal cDNA library and conserved cysteine residues in the first zinc finger of the DNA-binding domain (Cys-126 and Cys-129) were mutated to serine residues (MT-PPARγ), which is unable to form a functional DNA-binding complex with RXR-α (18Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3131) Google Scholar) and could be a dominant-negative. Lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus-G glycoprotein were prepared by the same methods described in the section of shRNA, except for the self-inactivating vector construct (CSII-EF-WT-PPARγ-IRES-hrGFP or CSII-EF-MT-PPARγ-IRES-hrGFP), which could express the PPARγ gene and hrGFP under control of the human elongation factor 1-α subunit gene promoter. Dissociated NSCs were then infected with viral stocks at a m.o.i. of 0.44 to 12 for 48 h, followed by FACS analysis to determine transduction efficiency. Constant and viral concentration-dependent expression of the target genes was confirmed by expression of GFP proteins in infected NSCs. Approximately 80% of NSCs were GFP-positive at the m.o.i. of 12. The cell growth rate in non-coated culture bottles for 4 days was measured by MTT assay and expressed as a percentage compared with that of non-infected wild-type NSCs. PPARγ Deficiency Causes Disorder of Embryo and NSC Growth—As it has been reported that homozygous PPARγ knock-out (PPARγ-/-) mouse embryos are lethal at days 10-11 of gestation because of placental dysfunction and disordered development of embryo (Ref. 2Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Miki H. Tamemoto H. Yamauchi T. Komeda K. Satoh S. Nakano R. Ishii C. Sugiyama T. Eto K. Tsubamoto Y. Okuno A. Murakami K. Sekihara H. Hasegawa G. Naito M. Toyoshima Y. Tanaka S.

Cell. 1999; 4: 597-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar and Fig. 1A), we prepared clones of NSCs from heterozygous PPARγ-deficient (PPARγ+/-) mice. Definition of PPARγ+/- or wild-type NSC clones was determined by PCR of genomic DNA (Fig. 1D, upper panel) and confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1D, lower panel). The PPARγ+/--NSCs exhibited low levels of PPARγ protein compared with those of wild-type NSCs. The rate of cell growth of PPARγ+/--NSCs was observed to be much lower than that of wild-type NSCs in non-coated culture bottles (Fig. 1F). Morphologically, a disorder in the formation of neurospheres was observed in PPARγ+/--NSCs compared with that observed with the wild-type clones (Fig. 1E). These results suggest that in vivo deficiency of PPARγ is associated with diminished growth and disordered formation of neurospheres. Analysis of Cell Growth on PPARγ-RNA-silenced or Dominant-negative PPARγ-NSCs—To confirm the effect of PPARγ deficiency, we prepared PPARγ-RNA-silenced NSCs by shRNA and dominant-negative PPARγ-NSCs (17Katayama K. Wada K. Miyoshi H. Ohashi K. Tachibana M. Furuki R. Mizuguchi H. Hayakawa T. Nakajima A. Kadowaki T. Tsutsumi Y. Nakagawa S. Kamisaki Y. Mayumi T. FEBS Lett. 2004; 560: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We used two effective shRNAs (shRNA-P15 and shRNA-P17), one ineffective shRNA (shRNA-P18), and shRNA against luciferase (shRNA-Lu) as a control (17Katayama K. Wada K. Miyoshi H. Ohashi K. Tachibana M. Furuki R. Mizuguchi H. Hayakawa T. Nakajima A. Kadowaki T. Tsutsumi Y. Nakagawa S. Kamisaki Y. Mayumi T. FEBS Lett. 2004; 560: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). PPARγ-RNA-silenced NSCs (shRNA-P15 and -P17) exhibited a significant decrease in their cell growth rates compared with that observed with the ineffective shRNA (shRNA-P18) or shRNA-Lu-transfected NSCs (Fig. 2B) in a viral concentration-dependent manner (m.o.i.). Morphologically, PPARγ-RNA-silenced NSCs also failed to form neurospheres in comparison to that observed with the ineffective shRNA or shRNA-Lu-transfected NSCs (Fig. 2A). Similar results were also observed when mutant PPARγ-transfected NSCs expressing a dominant-negative form of PPARγ was investigated. Namely, mutant PPARγ-transfected NSCs that are dominant-negative exhibited a significant decrease in their cell growth rates compared with that of wild-type PPARγ-transfected NSCs in a viral concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2D). Dominant-negative PPARγ-NSCs also failed to form neurospheres in comparison to that observed with wild-type PPARγ-NSCs (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, we examined the recovery of the impaired cell growth observed with PPARγ-deficient (PPARγ+/-) NSCs (clone number 2) by increasing the expression of PPARγ using adenovirus-mediated PPARγ-gene transfer as previously established by us (19Katayama K. Wada K. Nakajima A. Mizuguchi H. Hayakawa T. Nakagawa S. Kadowaki T. Nagai R. Kamisaki Y. Blumberg R.S. Mayumi T. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 1315-1324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Adenovirus-mediated PPARγ-gene transfer successfully increased PPARγ protein levels in both wild-type (clone number 7) and PPARγ+/--NSCs (clone number 2) in a viral concentration-dependent manner (data not shown). This increase in PPARγ protein levels in PPARγ+/--NSCs resulted in reversal of the impaired cell growth (Fig. 2E). These results strongly suggest that PPARγ regulates the proliferation and the absence of PPARγ directly inhibits the self-renewal functions of NSCs. Biphasic Effects of PPARγ Agonists on Cell Growth of NSCs—We also used PPARγ-specific agonists and antagonists to confirm the effect of the PPARγ pathway on cell growth of NSCs prepared from ordinal BALB/c mouse embryo brains. NSCs treated with PPARγ-specific agonists, rosiglitazone or pioglitazone, at concentrations of 100 nm to 3 μm exhibited a significant stimulation of cell growth in non-coated culture bottles (Fig. 3, A and B). However, inhibition of cell growth was conversely observed at a concentration of PPARγ agonists above 30 μm. Similar results were observed when NSCs were treated with PPARγ agonists on poly-l-ornithine/laminin-coated plates that initiate differentiation of NSCs into neurons accompanied with outgrowth of neurites (Fig. 3, E and F). Interestingly, NSCs treated with the PPARγ agonists expanded while maintaining neurosphere morphology consistent with an undifferentiated state (Fig. 3E). The biphasic action of PPARγ agonists on cell growth was not observed in various neuroblastoma-like cell lines (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that the effect of PPARγ agonists on NSC growth is specific for NSCs supporting a role for PPARγ function in NSCs but not transformed neuroblastomas. To confirm that PPARγ was involved in stimulating NSC proliferation, we also examined PPARγ antagonists, BADGE and GW9662. BADGE and GW9662 inhibited cell growth in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). Cell Death of NSCs Induced by the PPARγ Antagonist Is Due to Apoptosis Mediated by the Activation of the Caspase Cascade—We next investigated whether the decrease in NSC growth by PPARγ antagonists, BADGE and GW9662, was because of apoptosis using nuclear condensation, a morphological change associated with apoptosis. Treatment of NSCs with either vehicle or the PPARγ agonist, rosiglitazone (3 μm), did not cause any evidence of nuclear condensation in the fields observed (Fig. 4A). However, treatment with BADGE or GW9662 caused nuclear condensation in NSCs. Using Western blot analysis, we observed that treatment with BADGE or GW9662 caused an increase in cleaved caspase-3, a marker of caspase cascade activation (Fig. 4B). In contrast, bisphenol A did not induce activation of the caspase cascade. These results indicate that the PPARγ pathway protects NSCs from apoptosis and promotes cellular proliferation and expansion. Activation of PPARγ Pathway Inhibits the Differentiation of NSCs into Neurons—NSCs treated with the PPARγ agonists showed the maintaining of neurosphere morphology consistent with an undifferentiated state, although vehicle-treated NSCs differentiated into neurons when cultured on poly-l-ornitine/laminin-coated plates (see Fig. 3E). Therefore, we next investigated the role of PPARγ in regulating the differentiation of NSCs into neurons. To do so, we used confocal microscopy to detect the expression of MAP2 protein, which is a marker for neurons. As shown in Fig. 4C, NSCs treated with a vehicle control showed MAP2 expression in most differentiated cells at day 3. However, treatment with PPARγ agonist, rosiglitazone (3 μm), inhibited the expression of MAP2. In contrast, the expression of nestin, a marker of undifferentiated NSCs, was strongly maintained in the rosiglitazone-treated group compared with that observed in the vehicle control group (Fig. 4D). These results were also confirmed by Western blot analysis in that the expression of MAP2 and nestin were inversely regulated in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 4E). Taken together, these data indicate that activation of the PPARγ pathway by specific agonists inhibits the differentiation of NSCs into neurons while at the same time maintaining NSCs in an undifferentiated state as neurospheres.

The cytoskeletal reorganization necessary to perform these functions has been extensively studied, but the role of cell volume regulation, which is likely dependent upon anion channels, has not been defined. Mice lacking the anion channel ClC-3 (Clcn3(–/–)) died from presumed sepsis following intravascular catheter placement, whereas Clcn3(+/+) littermates survived. We hypothesized that ClC-3 has a critical role in host defense and reasoned that PMN function would be compromised in these mice. Clcn3(–/–) PMNs displayed markedly reduced NADPH oxidase activity in response to opsonized zymosan and modestly reduced activity after phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Human PMNs treated with the anion channel inhibitors niflumic acid or 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid had a very similar defect. ClC-3 protein was detected in the secretory vesicles and secondary granules of resting PMNs and was up-regulated to the phagosomal membrane. Clcn3(–/–) PMNs and human PMNs lacking normal anion channel function both exhibited reduced uptake of opsonized zymosan at 1, 5, and 10 min in a synchronized phagocytosis assay. Niflumic acid-treated PMNs also had impaired transendothelial migration in vitro, whereas migration in vivo was not altered in Clcn3(–/–) PMNs. Selective inhibition of the swelling-activated chloride channel with tamoxifen profoundly reduced PMN migration but had no effect on NADPH oxidase activity. In summary, PMNs lacking normal anion channel function exhibited reduced NADPH oxidase activity, diminished phagocytosis, and impaired migration.

Both processes require profound changes in cell shape, which occur via rapid mobilization, and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. The spherical shape of the unstimulated PMN provides the smallest surface area:volume ratio possible. Any deviation in shape away from spherical requires insertion of additional membrane, loss of cytoplasm, or both. Therefore, tight regulation of PMN volume may be necessary to respond briskly to environmental demands. Mammalian cells regulate their volume by control of ion flux across the plasma membrane. When exposed to hypoosmotic media, cell swelling occurs secondary to influx of water, but a compensatory regulatory volume decrease is accomplished by loss of potassium (K+) and chloride (Cl–) through distinct conductances and the associated osmotic loss of water. In PMNs, hypotonic conditions activate a chloride channel that demonstrates electrophysiological properties and pharmacologic sensitivity similar to those of other previously described swelling-induced Cl– conductances (IClswell) (1Stoddard J.S. Steinbach J.H. Simchowitz L. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C156-C165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the response to hypotonic stress, Cl– efflux from PMNs is a component of the response to fMLP, interleukin-8, platelet-activating factor, and C5a, although the specific channel responsible for this conductance is unknown (2Shimizu Y. Daniels R.H. Elmore M.A. Finnen M.J. Hill M.E. Lackie J.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 1743-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Anion movement has also been implicated in the release of granule contents from certain intracellular vesicles in PMNs (3Korchak H.M. Eisenstat B.A. Hoffstein S.T. Dunham P.B. Weissmann G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2721-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, a role for anion flux in the cell volume regulation accompanying neutrophil migration or phagocytosis has not been previously investigated. The neutrophil does not have passive distribution of chloride based on resting membrane potential but actively maintains a very high intracellular Cl– concentration through inward active transport (4Simchowitz L. De Weer P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1986; 88: 167-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The anion conductance(s) and transporters responsible for maintenance of a steady-state intracellular Cl– concentration and/or the modulation of Cl– flux across plasma and phagosomal membranes during cell activation have not been well defined. Neutrophils have several distinct potential transport mechanisms for Cl–. In addition to the IClswell described above (1Stoddard J.S. Steinbach J.H. Simchowitz L. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C156-C165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a Na+/K+/2Cl– co-transporter (4Simchowitz L. De Weer P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1986; 88: 167-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and a calcium-activated, voltage-independent Cl– current (5Krause K.H. Welsh M.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) have been defined electrophysiologically in neutrophils. mRNA for several members of the ClC family of Cl– channels, including ClC-3, has also been identified by reverse transcription-PCR, although the presence of any of the proteins have not been demonstrated (6Perez-Cornejo P.

Mice deficient in ClC-3, a member of the ClC family of voltage-sensitive anion channels, have a complex phenotype, including growth retardation, blindness, kyphoscoliosis, seizures, and premature death (8Dickerson L.

Notably, ClC-3-deficient mice developed signs of sepsis within 24–72 h after placement of intravascular blood pressure monitoring devices using aseptic technique. The vast majority of knock-out mice succumbed following this procedure, whereas almost all heterozygotes and wild-type littermates survived. Based on these observations, we reasoned that the knock-out mice might be prone to sepsis because of a defect in one or more elements of innate immunity. To test the hypothesis that ClC-3 is important in host defense, we explored the role of ClC-3 in PMN function. Because of inherent differences between human and murine PMNs, we complemented studies of murine PMNs with an examination of human PMNs in the presence of several structurally distinct, well characterized pharmacologic inhibitors of anion channels to mimic the ClC-3 knock-out phenotype. The current studies demonstrate that NADPH oxidase activity, phagocytosis, and transendothelial migration were significantly impaired in PMNs lacking normal anion channel activity. These data suggest a critical and previously unappreciated role for anion channels during a number of essential PMN functions including two functions (phagocytosis and transendothelial migration) that are linked by the requirement for PMN shape change. In addition, a specific requirement for ClC-3 for normal NADPH oxidase activity and phagocytosis is demonstrated. Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS), Hepes-RPMI, l-glutamine, and Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) were obtained from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). Fetal bovine serum was obtained from HyClone (Logan, UT), and horse serum was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Round glass coverslips (12-mm diameter) were from Fisher (Pittsburgh, PA). PMA was from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). Zymosan particles were from ICN Biochemicals (Aurora, OH). Monoclonal antibodies to gp91phox (54.1) and p22phox (44.1) were the generous gift of Drs. A. J. Jesaitis, M. Quinn, and J. Burritt (Montana State University, Bozeman, MT). Polyclonal antibody to ClC-3 was from Sigma. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG+IgM and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit F(ab′)2 were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). NFA and NPPB were purchased from Sigma and dissolved in Me2SO at a concentration of 10–1 m, and used at final concentrations of 10–3 to 10–4 m as described. The appropriate concentration of Me2SO was used for control PMNs in all experiments. Additional reagents were all obtained from Sigma. Hanks' buffers made with alternative anions for studies of anion selectivity were made in sterile water as follows (concentrations in mm): NaCl, NaBr, or NaI (138 mm); KCl 5 mm, CaCl2 (1 mm), MgSO4·H2O (0.4 mm), Na2HPO4·2H2O (0.4 mm), K2HPO4·2H2O (0.4 mm) MgCl·6H2O (0.5 mm), and NaHCO3 (4.2 mm). 1% human serum albumin and 0.1% dextrose were added, and pH was adjusted to 7.4 with HCl. In preliminary studies, this NaCl buffer was compared with commercial HBSS (Bio-Whittaker) with albumin and dextrose added, as used in all other studies of NADPH oxidase activity, and demonstrated identical results. Generation of the Clcn3(–/–) mice has been previously described (8Dickerson L. Bonthius D. Schutte B. Yang B. Barna T. Bailey M. Nehrke K. Williamson R. Lamb F. Brain Res. 2002; 958: 227-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). All animals had free access to food and water. Experimental protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Iowa. Pairs of mice were injected with 1 ml of 3% thioglycollate intraperitoneally 16 h prior to leukocyte isolation. Migrated cells were harvested by peritoneal lavage using 3 ml of PBS and counted. In some experiments, murine PMNs were separated from the collected peritoneal leukocyte population by Hypaque-Ficoll density centrifugation as described below. Human PMNs were isolated according to standard techniques from heparin anti-coagulated venous blood from healthy consenting adults in accordance with a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects at the University of Iowa. PMNs were isolated using dextran sedimentation and Hypaque-Ficoll density-gradient separation, followed by hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes as previously described (9Boyum A. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1968; 21: 77-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). Purified PMNs were resuspended in 0.9% saline prior to use in migration experiments. Exclusion of trypan blue was used to assess cell viability following treatment with the anion channel inhibitors NFA and NPPB. Human PMNs were diluted to 2 × 106 cells/ml and incubated with the inhibitor for time points up to 1 h. Equal volumes of the treated cells and trypan blue were mixed and incubated for 3 min before counting on a hemacytometer to determine the percentage of cells stained with trypan blue. A minimum of 400 cells per condition was counted. Tamoxifen-treated cells were assayed for cell viability using propidium iodide staining followed by flow cytometry. Cells were incubated with HBSS buffer or tamoxifen (5–10 μm) for 1 h, then washed and resuspended in HBSS containing propidium iodide. Neutrophils were treated with the serine protease inhibitor diisopropylfluorophosphate (1 mm) for 20 min at room temperature and centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in relaxation buffer (10 mm PIPES, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2) with ATP (1 mm ATP(Na)) at 50 × 1062 PMN/ml with added phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm). Cells were placed in an ice-cold cavitation apparatus and closed tightly. The bomb was pressurized to 350 p.s.i. with nitrogen and allowed to equilibrate for 20 min at 4 °C. Cavitates were expelled dropwise into a tube containing EGTA (final concentration, 1.25 mm) and then centrifuged 200 × g for 20 min to remove unbroken cells and nuclei. These postnuclear supernatants were placed on top of either one-layer (isolation of phagosomes) or three-layer (isolation of granule fractions) Percoll gradients made as described previously (10Borregaard N. Heiple J. Simons E. Clark R. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) and centrifuged at 48,400 × g for 15 min at 4 °C without a brake. Subcellular fractions were carefully removed from the gradient, and Percoll was removed from each fraction by centrifugation. Fractions were then washed with relaxation buffer. Samples were resuspended in sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 2.3% SDS) and heated at 50 °C for 1 h prior to electrophoresis. Samples were resolved in 5–20% gradient gel by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoblots were processed using polyclonal antibody specific for ClC-3, or murine monoclonal antibodies to gp91phox (54.1) and/or p22phox (44.1) (11Burritt J.B. Quinn M.T. Jutila M.A. Bond C.W. Jesaitis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16974-16980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and horseradish peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse antibody (Bio-Rad) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection (Super Signal Substrate, Pierce). Immunoblots were scanned using the Typhoon imager (Amersham Biosciences), and relative abundances were quantitated using ImageQuaNT software for the PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Free-flow electrophoresis was used to separate secretory vesicles from plasma membrane using the γ-fraction isolated by three-layer Percoll density centrifugation as starting material (12Sengelov H. Nielsen M.H. Borregaard N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14912-14917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To reduce the surface charge on plasma membrane vesicles, the fraction was treated with neuraminidase (10 units/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C at a final concentration of 0.2 unit/ml. Following neuraminidase treatment, samples were centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 45 min and resuspended in 1 ml of buffer (6 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.4, sucrose 270 mm with conductivity adjusted to 420 μs/cm) by mixing 15 times with a 21-gauge needle. The electrode buffer was 50 mm triethanolamine and 50 mm acetic acid, pH 7.4, and free-flow electrophoresis was performed on an Elphor VaP 22 (Bender & Hobein, Munich) at 5 °C using a flow rate of 3.12 ml/h/fraction and current of 120 mA giving a voltage of 1120 V. Latent alkaline phosphatase activity assay was used to confirm separation of secretory vesicles from plasma membrane vesicles (12Sengelov H. Nielsen M.H. Borregaard N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14912-14917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μl of each fraction collected by free-flow electrophoresis was plated into duplicate 96-well microplates. 25 μl of 2% Triton X-100 was added to each well of one plate, and the mixture was incubated for 15 min at room temperature. 200 μl of 2 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate was added to each well, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min in the dark followed by reading on Spectramax at 405 nm. Fractions containing secretory vesicles demonstrate additional alkaline phosphatase activity after Triton permeabilization, i.e. latent activity, whereas plasma membrane vesicles do not demonstrate additional latent alkaline phosphatase activity. Streptococcus pneumoniae (serotype 2, strain D39) were stored at –80 °C, and an aliquot was streaked on blood agar plates 16 h prior to use. Bacteria were resuspended in endothelial basal medium, and bacterial concentration was determined by measuring optical density (A520). Staphylococcus aureus (strain RN450) and Escherichia coli (strain MC4100) were grown overnight from frozen stocks in tryptic soy broth (S. aureus) or nutrient broth (E. coli) at 37 °C with continuous shaking. Fresh subcultures were set up at A0.1 and grown for 2 h to mid-log phase. Bacterial concentration was determined by measuring A520 and confirmed by measuring colony forming units (CFU) in tryptic soy agar or nutrient broth agar plates. Bacteria were added to the Transwell lower chambers at known optical density, and samples from T = 0 to T = 4 h (just prior to the addition of the PMNs) were plated to determine the bacterial growth during the initial 4-h incubation with endothelial cells. Chemiluminescence—Lucigenin- and isoluminol-enhanced chemiluminescence assays of NADPH oxidase activity were performed in a 96-well plate using the Wallac Victor3 luminometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). 200 μl of a PMN suspension containing 2.5 × 106 PMNs/ml in HBSS with 1% human serum albumin and 0.1% dextrose was added to each well with final concentration of either lucigenin (100 μm) or isoluminol (100 μm) plus horseradish peroxidase (20 units/ml) as specified. Cells were stimulated by addition of either serum-opsonized zymosan (OpZ, 5 particles per cell) or PMA (10 ng/ml final concentration). Sub-maximal concentrations of agonists were used to investigate differences between the cells in the presence or absence of anion channel inhibition. Chemiluminescence was quantitated as relative luminescence units using a kinetic assay with readings every minute for 1 h. The leukocyte populations isolated after chemical induction of peritonitis in the mice were quantified according to cell type for every experiment by cytospins followed by Diff Quick staining and microscopy. PMN percentages ranged from 57 to 78%, with the remainder of cells from the macrophage lineage. NADPH oxidase activity of murine PMNs was normalized to the percentage of PMNs in each sample, to account for differences in the PMN percentage between knock-out and wild-type mice in each paired experiment. Use of this correction method yielded data that was not different from that obtained after PMNs were separated by density centrifugation before testing (data not shown). Reduction of Ferricytochrome c—Extracellular O2·¯ generation was measured as the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c in a 96-well microplate using SPECTRmax plus (Molecular Devices). PMN suspensions were diluted and added to the microplate as described above. Cytochrome c (100 μm) was added to the suspension just prior to loading in the microplate. In duplicate wells superoxide dismutase was added at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. The maximum rate (Vmax) of O2·¯ generation and the total nanomoles of O2·¯/10 min was calculated as the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c, with readings at absorbance 550 nm every 15 s for 30 min following injection of PMA (10 ng/ml). Oxygen Consumption—After calibration of the Clark electrode, PMNs (1 ml, 5.0 × 106/ml) were added to the sample chamber with 1.4 ml of HBSS and allowed to warm for 2 min. The probe was inserted, and the recorder was set to 100%. The samples were then measured for 5 min to determine the resting oxygen consumption rate. The stimulus was added in a 10-μl volume, OpZ, 50 × 106 particles/10 μl, or PMA (10 ng/ml), and measurements were continued for 20 min. The maximum rate of O2 consumption (Vmax) and total O2 consumed/10 min were calculated for each sample. PMNs at a concentration of 1 × 106/ml were analyzed for forward scatter (FSC) profiles using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Baseline forward scatter histograms were obtained for control PMNs in HBSS with Ca2+ and Mg2+. PMNs treated with tamoxifen (10 μm) in HBSS were analyzed for changes in forward and side scatter profiles over a 30-min period following addition of the tamoxifen to the PMN suspension to determine if tamoxifen had any effect on PMN size in isotonic buffer. Both tamoxifen and control PMNs were subjected to hypotonic stress by addition of sterile water to the isotonic buffer containing the PMNs. Cells were stressed with sterile water at 10 and 25% of the final volume. Forward and side scatter histograms were obtained at time 0 (immediately after addition of the sterile water) and at 30 s, and then every 1 min for 10 min. Additional histograms were obtained at 10-min intervals up to 40 min. S. aureus were subcultured for 2 h, diluted to 5 × 106 CFU/ml, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 100% normal human serum for opsonization. Bacteria were centrifuged and resuspended in HBSS with 1% human serum albumin and 0.1% dextrose and were mixed 1:1 (v/v) with PMNs to yield a final multiplicity of infection ranging from 2 to 3. Bacteria/PMN suspensions were coincubated for 10 min at 37 °C and centrifuged at 1500 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was assayed to enumerate bacterial colonies for quantitation of the percentage of the initial inoculum that was not phagocytosed. Cell suspensions were washed and resuspended, and PMN with adherent/ingested bacteria were incubated for an additional 30–60 min. 10-μl aliquots of each cell suspension was added to a 1% saponin solution to lyse the PMN. (This concentration of saponin had no effect on S. aureus viability, data not shown.) Samples were serially diluted and aliquoted into plates with tryptic soy broth agar poured on top. CFU were counted after overnight incubation. Zymosan particles were opsonized with 100% normal human serum or 100% pooled murine serum for 30 min at 37 °C, washed with DPBS, and then resuspended in Hepes-RPMI. For phagocytosis assays, PMNs were plated onto acid-washed glass coverslips precoated with 10% normal human serum to obtain ∼1 to 2 × 105 cells/coverslip. Phagocytosis of OpZ by adherent PMNs was synchronized, by centrifugation of cold OpZ particles onto PMNs (2 min, 400 × g, 15 °C), and internalization of the bound particles was stimulated by rapidly warming the cells to 37 °C. After 0–10 min at 37 °C, coverslips were processed for microscopy as described below (13Allen L.A. DeLeo F.R. Gallois A. Toyoshima S. Suzuki K. Nauseef W.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 3521-3530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments PMNs in suspension were treated with NFA (10–3 m) for 10 min at 37 °C prior to plating on glass coverslips. PMNs on glass coverslips were prepared for immunofluorescence microscopy by fixation for 15 min at room temperature in 10% neutral buffered formalin and then permeabilized in –20 °C acetone for 5 min. Fixed cells were rinsed with DPBS and then blocked in DPBS supplemented with 0.5 g/liter sodium azide, 5 g/liter bovine serum albumin, and 10% horse serum (blocking buffer) for 1 h at 25°Cor overnight at 4 °C. Fixed and permeabilized cells were incubated with primary antibodies (diluted in blocking buffer) for 1 h at 25°C in a humidified chamber and then washed six times in DPBS-azide-bovine serum albumin. After incubation with secondary antibodies or rhodamine-phalloidin for an additional hour, coverslips were washed six times in DPBS-azide-bovine serum albumin, once with ddH2O, and then mounted onto glass slides in Gelvatol. Specificity of staining was assessed by omission of primary antibodies and by the use of mouse and rabbit isotype control antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). Samples were viewed using a Zeiss Axioplan2 photomicroscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY), and digital images were obtained using a Zeiss AxioCam and AxioVision 3.1 software. Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-Ds) were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) and cultured on collagen-coated flasks (Type VI, human placental collagen, Sigma) using endothelial growth medium-2 (Clonetics) with added bovine brain extract, vascular epithelial growth factor, epithelial growth factor, Gentamicin, and hydrocortisone according to manufacturer's specifications. Cells were received from Clonetics at passage 4 and used between passages 5 and 8. Cells were passed from T-75 flasks at 70–80% confluence. HMVEC-Ds were detached using trypsin-EDTA and cultured on collagen-coated Transwell (Costar, Cambridge, MA) 12-mm filters for transmigration experiments. The integrity of the endothelial monolayer on the Transwell filter was monitored by measuring resistance changes across the monolayer using an End Ohm Epithelial Voltohmeter (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). The microvascular endothelial cell monolayers reached an average resistance of 28.7 ± 0.97 Ω/cm2 across the monolayer within 5–6 days. Medium was changed every 48 h. Migration assays were performed across HMVEC-D dermal monolayers as previously described (14Moreland J. Bailey G. Nauseef W.M. Weiss J.P. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 426-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, Transwell filters with attached endothelial cell monolayers were transferred to clean 12-well plates, and washed twice with HBSS. After removal of the HBSS, 400 μl of endothelial basal medium (Clonetics) was added to the Transwell filter compartment. Whole bacteria or other agonist was added to the lower compartment of the Transwell at the indicated concentration in a total volume of 1 ml and incubated with the endothelial cells for 4 h at 37 °C. At the end of this incubation, 10-μl samples were removed from the lower chamber for quantitation of the bacterial CFU, and 2 × 106 PMNs were added to the Transwell (upper chamber) in a volume of 100 μl. PMNs were pretreated with inhibitors (NFA, tamoxifen, and indomethacin) prior to addition to the Transwell. PMNs were centrifuged and resuspended in HBSS prior to addition to the Transwell to remove the inhibitors. PMNs were allowed to migrate over a 3-h period at 37 °C, after which migrated cells were collected from the lower chamber for counting in a hemacytometer in triplicate. In preliminary experiments PMNs recovered from above and below the endothelial monolayer accounted for ∼90% of the initial number added, indicating that there were not significant numbers of tightly adherent PMNs that were not recovered. Therefore, PMNs were counted from lower chamber only. Clcn3(–/–) Mice—Clcn3(–/–) and Clcn3(+/+) mice underwent placement of implantable telemetry devices using aseptic technique for continuous blood pressure and heart rate recording. In the first several days following placement, Clcn3(–/–) mice developed signs of sepsis, including lethargy, shivering, and progressive hypotension followed by death. Approximately 90% of the ClC-3-deficient mice died following monitor placement, whereas only 6% (1 mouse) of wild-type littermate controls died after the same procedure. Pretreatment of the Clcn3(–/–) mice with antibiotics (Enrofloxacin) improved their survival to 50% (n = 10, data not shown). Both the appearance of the mice after monitor placement and the improved survival following pretreatment with antimicrobial therapy suggested that bacterial sepsis was likely the cause of death. ROS Generation by Clcn3(–/–) PMNs—To determine if this phenotype of the Clcn3(–/–) mice reflected a defect in cellular elements of innate immunity, neutrophil function was assessed. Thioglycollate-elicited leukocytes were isolated from the peritoneal cavity of Clcn3(–/–) and Clcn3(+/+) mice, and lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence following stimulation with opsonized zymosan (OpZ) at a particle:cell ratio of 5:1 or PMA (10 ng/ml) was assessed.

https://openalex.org/W2059583297,"Up-regulation of BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) has been suggested to contribute to the action of antidepressants. However, it is unclear whether chronic treatment with antidepressants may influence acute BDNF signaling in central nervous system neurons. Because BDNF has been shown by us to reinforce excitatory glutamatergic transmission in cultured cortical neurons via the phospholipase-γ (PLC-γ)/inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)/Ca2+ pathway (Numakawa, T., Yamagishi, S., Adachi, N., Matsumoto, T., Yokomaku, D., Yamada, M., and Hatanaka, H. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 6520-6529), we examined in this study the possible effects of pretreatment with antidepressants on the BDNF signaling through the PLC-γ)/IP3/Ca2+ pathway. Furthermore, because the PLC-γ/IP3/Ca2+ pathway is regulated by sigma-1 receptors (Hayashi, T., and Su, T. P. (2001) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 98, 491-496), we examined whether the BDNF signaling is modulated by sigma-1 receptors (Sig-1R). We found that the BDNF-stimulated PLC-γ activation and the ensued increase in intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) were potentiated by pretreatment with imipramine or fluvoxamine, so was the BDNF-induced glutamate release. Furthermore, enhancement of the interaction between PLC-γ and TrkB (receptor for BDNF) after imipramine pretreatment was observed. Interestingly, BD1047, a potent Sig-1R antagonist, blocked the imipramine-dependent potentiation on the BDNF-induced PLC-γ activation and glutamate release. In contrast, overexpression of Sig-1R per se, without antidepressant pretreatment, enhances BDNF-induced PLC-γ activation and glutamate release. These results suggest that antidepressant pretreatment selectively enhance the BDNF signaling on the PLC-γ/IP3/Ca2+ pathway via Sig-1R, and that Sig-1R plays an important role in BDNF signaling leading to glutamate release. Up-regulation of BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) has been suggested to contribute to the action of antidepressants.

Antidepressant drugs increase the levels of serotonin and/or norepinephrine by blocking reuptake of these neurotransmitters to presynaptic terminals (3Duman R.S. Heninger G.R. Nestler E.J. Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 1997; 54: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar, 4Skolnick P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 375: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). However, although increase in monoamine levels occurs soon after drug administration, the effects of antidepressants emerge gradually over several weeks of continuous application (5Nestler E.J. Barrot M. DiLeone R.J. Eisch A.J. Gold S.J. Monteggia L.M. Neuron. 2002; 34: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2580) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that in addition to an increase in monoamine levels, other more temporal neuronal events may be responsible for the action of antidepressants. Alterations in cell signaling are supposed to be essential for the clinical effects of antidepressants because signal abnormalities have been shown to underlie both the pathophysiology and the treatment of depressive disorders (3Duman R.S. Heninger G.R. Nestler E.J. Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 1997; 54: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar). Many studies show the involvement of the cAMP pathway in depressive disorders (6Cowburn R.F. Marcusson J.O. Eriksson A. Wiehager B. O'Neill C. Brain Res. 1994; 633: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 7Dowlatshahi D. MacQueen G.M. Wang J.F. Reiach J.S. Young L.T. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1121-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Electroconvulsive therapy as well as antidepressant treatments up-regulate components of the cAMP pathway including transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein and its phosphorylation. These events have been proposed to play important roles in the clinical manifestation of antidepressants that are characterized by slow onsets in their effects (8Fitzgerald L.R. Vaidya V.A. Terwilliger R.Z. Duman R.S. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 429-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Jensen J.B. Mikkelsen J.D. Mork A. Eur.

BDNF may be one of the major targets in the clinical action of antidepressants. For example, chronic, but not acute, antidepressant (e.g. tranylcypromine, sertraline, desipramine, and mianserin) treatments or electroconvulsive seizure up-regulates BDNF mRNA in the rat brain (14Nibuya M. Morinobu S. Duman R.S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 7539-7547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Russo-Neustadt A.A. Beard R.C. Huang Y.M. Cotman C.W. Neuroscience. 2000; 101: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The infusion of BDNF into the rat midbrain area or hippocampus mimics the effects of antidepressants in behavioral models of depression such as learned helplessness and the forced swim test (16Siuciak J.A. Lewis D.R. Wiegand S.J. Lindsay R.M. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 1997; 56: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar, 17Shirayama Y. Chen A.C. Nakagawa S. Russell D.S. Duman R.S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3251-3261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the levels of BDNF was higher in the post-mortem hippocampal tissue obtained from antidepressant-treated subjects than those from untreated subjects (18Chen B. Dowlatshahi D. MacQueen G.M. Wang J.F. Young L.T. Biol. Psychiatry. 2001; 50: 260-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). These results suggest that antidepressants might exert their effects through an up-regulation of BDNF. Consistently, a reduction of BDNF mRNA expression in rat hippocampus was observed after the immobilization of stress (19Smith M.A. Makino S. Kvetnansky R. Post R.M. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1768-1777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A decrease in the serum BDNF level in subjects diagnosed with severe depression was also reported (20Karege F. Bondolfi G. Gervasoni N. Schwald M. Aubry J.M. Bertschy G. Biol. Psychiatry. 2005; 57: 1068-1072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Dwivedi et al. (21Dwivedi Y. Rizavi H.S. Conley R.R. Roberts R.C. Tamminga C.A. Pandey G.N. Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 2003; 60: 804-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar) reported that BDNF mRNA and protein were reduced in the postmortem hippocampus and frontal cortex of suicide victims, most of whom were diagnosed with major depression. These studies strongly suggest that BDNF is a key molecule involved in the pathophysiology of depressive disorder and perhaps in the pharmacological action of antidepressants as well. BDNF/TrkB signaling pathways have been well studied. Ras/ERK, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt, and PLC-γ pathways are activated after BDNF administration (22Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar, 23Huang E.J. Reichardt L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 609-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1982) Google Scholar). These pathways are required for cellular differentiation, survival promotion, neurotransmission, and neuronal plasticity in the central nervous system (24Thoenen H. Science. 1995; 270: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar, 25Bibel M. Barde Y.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2919-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 26Lu B. Learn. Mem. 2003; 10: 86-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathways have been implicated in BDNF-mediated survival and axon outgrowth. BDNF protects cortical neurons against camptothecin and serum deprivation-induced apoptosis via ERK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathways (27Hetman M. Kanning K. Cavanaugh J.E. Xia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22569-22580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Primary dendrite formation is also promoted via the same pathways (28Dijkhuizen P.A. Ghosh A. J. Neurobiol. 2005; 62: 278-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). BDNF-mediated PLC-γ signaling also plays an important role in the central nervous system neurons. We previously reported that BDNF induces the release of excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate, through the TrkB/PLC-γ/IP3 pathway in cultured cortical and cerebellar neurons (1Numakawa T. Yamagishi S. Adachi N. Matsumoto T. Yokomaku D. Yamada M. Hatanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6520-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 29Numakawa T. Matsumoto T.

Interestingly, Saarelainen et al. (32Saarelainen T. Hendolin P. Lucas G. Koponen E. Sairanen M. MacDonald E. Agerman K. Haapasalo A. Nawa H. Aloyz R. Ernfors P. Castren E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 349-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that TrkB-T1 (a kinase negative type of TrkB) transgenic mice show a reduced activation of TrkB in the brain, and are resistant to the antidepressants effect in the forced swim test, suggesting that TrkB signaling is involved in the action of antidepressants. However, the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of antidepressants that is characterized by slow onset, and the associated roles of BDNF/TrkB signaling, if any, are still unknown. Sig-1R are endoplasmic reticular proteins that, when stimulated by ligands or when overexpressed, can translocate (33Hayashi T. Su T.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 306: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 34Hayashi T. Su T.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 306: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The translocation of Sig-1R has been shown to increase [Ca2+]i by enhancing the IP3 receptor signaling at the endoplasmic reticulum via the removal of an inhibitory cytoskeletal adaptor protein ankyrin from the IP3 receptor (2Hayashi T. Su T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Interestingly, most antidepressants have high affinities to Sig-1R (35Takebayashi M. Hayashi T. Su T.P. Pharmacopsychiatry. 2004; 37: S208-S213Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesize that Sig-1R may participate in modulation of the BDNF-stimulated PLC-γ/IP3/Ca2+ pathway. In the present study, we focused on the influence of pretreatment with antidepressants on the BDNF-induced glutamate release through the PLC-γ/IP3/Ca2+ pathway and found that pretreatments with structurally different antidepressants that are Sig-1R agonists (i.e. imipramine and fluvoxamine) significantly potentiate the BDNF-triggered glutamate release in cultured cortical neurons. Such potentiation by antidepressants occurred via enhancing activation of the PLC-γ/IP3/Ca2+ pathway. Furthermore, we found that the potentiation of the PLC-γ/IP3/Ca2+ pathway may be through the Sig-1R-mediated action. Thus, it is possible that the potentiation of BDNF-induced glutamate release by antidepressant pretreatment may underlie the therapeutic effect of antidepressants and that antidepressants may exert this effect via Sig-1R. Cell Culture—Primary cultures were prepared from postnatal 2-day-old rat (SLC, Shizuoka, Japan) cortex as reported previously (1Numakawa T. Yamagishi S. Adachi N. Matsumoto T. Yokomaku D. Yamada M. Hatanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6520-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cortical cells were plated at a final density of 5 × 105/cm2 on polyethyleneimine-coated culture plates (Corning, Corning, NY) or cover glasses (Matsunami, Osaka, Japan) attached to flexiperm (VIVASCIENCE, Gottingen, Germany). The culture medium (5/5 DF) consisted of 5% fetal bovine serum, 5% heated-inactivated horse serum, 90% of a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium containing 15 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 30 nm Na2SeO3, and 1.9 mg/ml NaHCO3. The Pretreatment with Antidepressants—After maintenance of the cultured neurons for 5 days in vitro (DIV 5) with 5/5 DF media, antidepressants (imipramine hydrochloride and fluvoxamine maleate, Sigma) were added to cortical cultures by bath application. Then, the cultures were incubated for 48 h in the presence of antidepressants before performing collection of samples for amino acid measurement. BD1047 (1 μm, Tocris Cookson Ltd., Avonmouth, United Kingdom), an antagonist of Sig-1/2Rs (36Matsumoto R.R. Bowen W.D. Tom M.A. Vo V.N. Truong D.D. De Costa B.R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 280: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), was applied 30 min before adding the antidepressants. To examine the effect of BD1047, the antidepressant pretreatment was maintained in the presence of BD1047. Detection of Amino Acid Neurotransmitters—The amount of amino acid released from cultured cortical neurons were measured as described previously (29Numakawa T. Matsumoto T. Adachi N. Yokomaku D. Kojima M. Takei N. Hatanaka H. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 66: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, amino acids released into the assay buffer (modified HEPES-buffered Krebs Ringer solution: KRH containing 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan) with a fluorescence detector (Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan). After cortical cultures were washed three times with KRH assay buffer, initially, fresh KRH buffer was added to cultures and collected without stimulation (1 min), that is, the amount of glutamate in the sample was considered as a basal release. Next, BDNF (final 100 ng/ml, 1 min) dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline containing bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) was added to cultures by bath application. The basal or BDNF-stimulated samples were treated with o-phthalaldehyde and 2-mercaptopropionic acid for 5 min at 10 °C before being injected into the high performance liquid chromatography system and analyzed using a fluorescence monitor (excitation wavelength, 340 nm; emission wavelength, 445 nm). U73122 (Wako, Osaka, Japan), a PLC-γ inhibitor, was applied for 30 min at 2 μm before BDNF application. Xestospongin C (10 μm, Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI), an IP3 receptor inhibitor, was added 1 h before the application of BDNF. Representative data from a sister culture are shown in the figures. N indicates the well number of each plate. The reproducibility was confirmed in separated cultures. Imaging of Intracellular Ca2+—Ca2+ imaging was carried out as reported previously (1Numakawa T. Yamagishi S. Adachi N. Matsumoto T. Yokomaku D. Yamada M. Hatanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6520-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cultured cells were maintained on polyethyleneimine-coated cover glasses (Matsunami, Osaka, Japan) attached to flexiperm. The dye intensity was monitored using a fluorescent microscope (Axiovert 200 controlled by Slide Book TM 3.0, ZEISS, Tokyo, Japan). The emitted fluorescence was guided through a ×20 objective. Image data were obtained every 2 or 4 s. The data were stored and analyzed with the Slide Book™ 3.0 (Intelligent Imaging Innovations Inc., CO). All imaging experiments were performed at least 3 times with separate cultures. Representative data from neurons in a sister culture are shown in the figures. Immunoblotting—Pretreatment with antidepressants was carried out at 0.1 μm and the cultures were incubated for 48 h. Afterward, BDNF was applied at 100 ng/ml for 0.5, 1, or 3 min. Cells were lysed in a SDS lysis buffer containing 1% SDS, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm phenylarsine oxide, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected for analysis. Primary antibodies for immunoblotting were used at the following dilutions: anti-Akt (1:1000, Cell Signaling, MA), anti-phospho-Akt (1:1000, Cell Signaling), anti-ERK (1:1000, Cell Signaling), anti-phospho-ERK (1:1000, Cell Signaling), affinity purified anti-Sig-1R (1:2000), anti-ankyrin (CALBIOCHEM, Darmstadt, Germany), anti-IP3 receptor1 (1:1000, Affinity BioReagents), anti-synapsin I (1:1000, CHEMICON, CA), anti-synaptotagmin (1:3000, Transduction Laboratories, KY), anti-TUJ1 (1:5000, Berkeley Antibody Co., CA), and anti-GFP antibodies (1:1000, MBL, Nagoya, Japan). Anti-Sig-1R antisera was raised in rabbits by using a peptide antigen corresponding to amino acids 144-165 of guinea pig Sig-1R. Affinity purified anti-Sig-1R antibodies were raised in rabbits by using a peptide antigen corresponding to amino acids 52-69 of rat Sig-1R. To detect activation of TrkB or PLC-γ, immunoprecipitation was carried out as described previously (1Numakawa T. Yamagishi S. Adachi N. Matsumoto T. Yokomaku D. Yamada M. Hatanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6520-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Anti-phospho-Tyr (1:1000, Upstate, VA), anti-PLC-γ (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-TrkB (1:1000, BD Biosciences), and anti-Trk antibodies (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) were used. To examine the effect of phosphatase inhibitor, Na3VO4 (CALBIOCHEM), on the PLC-γ activation, Na3VO4 was applied to cortical cultures 1 h before BDNF stimulation. The immunoblotting experiments were performed three or four times with independent cultures and they were quantitatively analyzed as described previously (37Numakawa T. Yagasaki Y. Ishimoto T. Okada T. Suzuki T. Iwata N. Ozaki N. Taguchi T. Tatsumi M. Kamijima K. Straub R.E. Weinberger D.R. Kunugi H. Hashimoto R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 2699-2708Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Measurement of PLC-γ Activity—PLC-γ activity was determined by hydrolysis of PtdInsP2 by mixing 10 μl of the PLC solution with 20 μl of distilled water, 10 ml of reaction buffer, and 10 μl of phospholipid micelle solution (38Wahl M.I. Jones G.A. Nishibe S. Rhee S.G. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10447-10456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Kouchi Z. Fukami K. Shikano T. Oda S. Nakamura Y. Takenawa T. Miyazaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10408-10412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The final concentration was 50 μm phosphatidylethanolamine (Sigma), 40 μm PtdInsP2 (Sigma), 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]Pt-dInsP2 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 50 mm Mes, pH 7.0, 0.4 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The reaction mixture containing 30,000 dpm of [3H]PtdInsP2 was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, and the reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v). Radioactive InsP3 was extracted by adding 250 μl of 1 n HCl, and radio-activity in the upper aqueous phase was measured for 1 min in a liquid scintillation counter. Immunocytochemistry—Cultured neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and then rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min at room temperature. Anti-MAP2 (1:1000, Sigma) and anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (1:1000, CHEMICON) antibodies were applied overnight at 4 °C. Anti-Sig-1R (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) and anti-Sig-1R antisera (1:100) were also used. Alexa Fluor 488- or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:1000, Invitrogen) or anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000, Invitrogen) were used as secondary antibodies. Immunoreactivity was monitored with a fluorescence microscope (Axiovert 200, ZEISS). The images of GFP (green fluorescent protein) were obtained using the same system. Sindbis Virus—A bicistronic vector plasmid (pSinEGdsp) was provided by Dr. Kawamura (Niigata University, Japan). The plasmid was derived from pSinRep5 (Invitrogen, Tokyo, Japan) and had two subgenomic promoters followed by a multiple cloning site for arbitrary gene insertion and an enhanced GFP open reading frame, thus the virus can produce arbitrary protein and enhanced GFP independently in the infected cell, as previously described (40Kawamura M. Namba H. Otsu Y. Hayashi Y. Takei N. Nawa H. Recent Res. Dev. Neurochem. 2003; 6: 105-120Google Scholar). Rat Sig-1R cDNA amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR with primers (forward 5′-GGAATTCACTAGTCGTCCGACGTTGGTGGTA-3′ and reverse 5′-GCTCTAGACGCGTGTCCTTCCTCACACAGCAG-3′) were cleaved with SpeI and MluI sites. Cleaved fragments were inserted at the XbaI-MluI sites of the plasmid. Each plasmid was cleaved with NotI, and used as a template for mRNA transcription in vitro using a mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion, TX). Pseudovirions were produced according to the experimental procedure of Invitrogen. Baby hamster kidney cells were transfected with each mRNA and 26 S helper mRNA (Invitrogen) by electroporation (500 V/cm, 25 μF, double pulse) using Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). The cells were incubated with 5/5 DF media for 24 h at 37 °C, the supernatants were collected as pseudovirion-containing solutions. Materials—Regeneron Pharmaceutical Co. and Takeda Chemical Industries, LTD. generously donated the BDNF. Statistical Analysis—Data shown in this study are expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was evaluated with Student's t test, and probability values less than 5% were considered significant. Pretreatment with Antidepressants Enhanced BDNF-evoked Release of Glutamate and Increase in Intracellular Ca2+ Concentration in Cultured Cortical Neurons—Immunocytochemical analysis, using anti-microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2, a neuronal marker) and anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (an astroglial marker), revealed that the proportion of MAP2 positive cells in our cortical cultures (7 days in vitro, DIV 7) was ∼80% (n = 4, the number of selected fields), suggesting that the majority of cultured cells were neurons (Fig. 1A). After cultured neurons were pretreated with 0.01-10 μm imipramine or fluvoxamine for 48 h, BDNF-induced glutamate release was measured. As shown in Fig. 1B, both antidepressants enhanced the BDNF-induced glutamate release. Both drugs were effective at 0.1-10 μm, although these antidepressants had no effect at the concentration of 0.01 μm (a and b in Fig. 1B). The basal release of glutamate was not influenced by either drug. In our previous study (1Numakawa T. Yamagishi S. Adachi N. Matsumoto T. Yokomaku D. Yamada M. Hatanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6520-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 29Numakawa T. Matsumoto T. Adachi N. Yokomaku D. Kojima M. Takei N. Hatanaka H. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 66: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we showed that the BDNF-induced glutamate release depends on increases in [Ca2+]i through IP3-sensitive Ca2+ channels. Therefore, we monitored changes in the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ stimulated by BDNF. Pretreatment with imipramine or fluvoxamine potentiated the BDNF-elicited [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1C). The time dependence of the [Ca2+]i increase in cell bodies before and after BDNF application is shown (a in Fig. 1C). The changes in [Ca2+]i were quantified by normalizing the Fluo-3 fluorescence intensity to the basal line (F/F0). The [Ca2+]i increase by BDNF was observed in both neurites and soma (b in Fig. 1C). Quantitative data of [Ca2+]i were obtained by analyzing the concentration at the cell body (c in Fig. 1C) as a higher intensity of dye emission was seen in cell bodies than in neurites. Pretreatment with Imipramine Increased Activation of PLC-γ by BDNF—We previously reported that the PLC-γ/IP3/Ca2+ (an increase in [Ca2+]i from the IP3-sensitive Ca2+ channel receptors) pathway, downstream of TrkB, is essential for the BDNF-induced glutamate release (1Numakawa T. Yamagishi S. Adachi N. Matsumoto T. Yokomaku D. Yamada M. Hatanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6520-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 29Numakawa T. Matsumoto T. Adachi N. Yokomaku D. Kojima M. Takei N. Hatanaka H. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 66: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effect of pretreatment with imipramine on BDNF-stimulated PLC-γ activation (phosphorylation) was examined. To determine PLC-γ activity, the blotting with anti-phospho-Tyr anti-body following immunoprecipitation with anti-PLC-γ antibody was performed. As shown in Fig. 2A, PLC-γ was activated within 0.5 min after the application of BDNF with or without imipramine pretreatment. However, the magnification of PLC-γ activation was significantly greater in imipramine-treated cultures, compared with non-treated cultures. The enhancement of the PLC-γ activation was confirmed at 0.5, 1.0, or 3.0 min after the BDNF stimulation as compared with that obtained from non-treated cultures (a in Fig. 2A). Quantification of the levels of activated PLC-γ is shown (b in Fig. 2A). The enzymatic activity of PLC-γ stimulated by BDNF were also examined (supplementary Fig. S1). The enhancement of PLC-γ enzymatic activity was confirmed (supplementary Fig. S1). Activation of TrkB was also examined (Fig. 2B). TrkB was equally activated by BDNF with or without imipramine pretreatment (a in Fig. 2B). Quantification of the activated TrkB is shown (b in Fig. 2B). We then investigated other pathways activated by TrkB, i.e. phosphoinositide 3-kinase and MAPK/ERK pathways. However, imipramine pretreatment did not affect the activation of Akt (pAkt, phosphorylated Akt) or ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) caused by BDNF (a in Fig. 2C). Total expression of Akt or ERK1/2 was not influenced by imipramine. Quantifications of phosphorylated Akt and pERK1/2 levels are shown (b, c, and d in Fig. 2C). These results suggest that the chronic treatment with imipramine specifically affects the PLC-γ pathway. The duration of the magnification of PLC-γ activation was examined. As shown in supplementary Fig. S2, the magnification of BDNF-stimulated PLC-γ in imipramine-treated cultures was maintained until at least 24 h. In the present study, to investigate the effects of imipramine pretreatment on the acute action of BDNF, we focused on the neuronal responses within 3 min after BDNF stimulation following pretreatment with antidepressants. To further consolidate the possibility that the PLC-γ pathway is involved in the imipramine-potentiated glutamate release and the increase of intracellular Ca2+, we examined the effect of U73122, a PLC-γ inhibitor, in our system. In the presence of U-73122 (2 μm), the BDNF-induced glutamate releases in both non- and imipramine-pretreated cortical cultures were completely blocked (a in Fig. 3A). The IP3-sensitive Ca2+ channel inhibitor, xestospongin C, also blocked glutamate releases in both non- and imipramine-pretreated cultures (b in Fig. 3A). The effects of U73122 or xe"
https://openalex.org/W2129211064,"Although the antitumor effect of α-tocopheryl succinate (vitamin E succinate) has been well demonstrated, its underlying mechanism remains elusive. This study provides evidence that inhibition of Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 function represents a major pathway whereby α-tocopheryl succinate mediates apoptosis induction in prostate cancer cells. In vitro data indicate that α-tocopheryl succinate was able to disrupt the binding of Bak BH3 peptide to Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 with IC50 of 26 μm, in line with its potency in antiproliferation. Treatment of PC-3 cells with this agent led to reduced association of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL with Bak, leading to caspase-dependent apoptosis. Moreover, overexpression of Bcl-xL protected LNCaP cells from the apoptosis induction. This mechanistic finding provided a basis to develop potent Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 inhibitors. Docking of α-tocopheryl succinate into the Bak peptide-binding site indicates that it adopted a unique hairpin-shaped conformation for protein interactions. We rationalized that the hemisuccinate and the two proximal isopranyl units of the side chain played a crucial role in ligand anchoring and protein-ligand complex stabilization, respectively. However, exposure of the distal isopranyl unit to a polar environment might diminish the binding affinity of α-tocopheryl succinate. This premise was corroborated by a structure-activity analysis of a series of derivatives with truncated side chains and/or altered carboxyl terminus. This computer model predicted that the removal of the distal isopranyl unit from the side chain would improve binding affinity, leading to two agents with significantly higher potency in inhibiting Bak peptide binding and in suppressing prostate cancer cell proliferation.

Although numerous epidemiological and intervention studies have failed to establish a correlation between vitamin E intake and the incidence of cancer, recent investigations have suggested the potential use of α-tocopheryl succinate (vitamin E succinate) as a therapeutic agent for cancer (for reviews see Refs. 1Neuzil J.

Another school of thought is that α-tocopheryl succinate represents a provitamin form, of which the conversion to vitamin E occurs selectively in tumor interstitium by its acidic environment (1Neuzil J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 1309-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this study, we obtained several lines of evidence that Bcl-xL represented a major target by which α-tocopheryl succinate mediated antineoplastic activities in prostate cancer cells. This finding not only shed light onto the mode of action of this redox-inactive vitamin E analogue but also provided a molecular basis to carry out structure-based optimization to generate potent Bcl-xL inhibitors. Cell Culture—LNCaP androgen-dependent (p53+/+) and PC-3 androgen-nonresponsive (P53-/-) prostate cancer cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The preparation of the stable Bcl-xL-overexpressing LNCaP clone B3 (LNCaP/B3) was previously described (18Yang C.C. Lin H.P. Chen C.S. Yang Y.T. Tseng P.H. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol.

PC-3, LNCaP, and LNCaP/B3 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) 2The abbreviations used are: FBS, fetal bovine serum; PrEC, prostate epithelial cell; TS-1, succinic acid mono-[2-(4,8-dimethyl-nonyl)-2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-chroman-6-yl] ester; Ts-2, succinic acid mono-[2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-2-(4-methyl-pentyl)-chroman-6-yl] ester; TS-3, succinic acid mono-(2,2,5,7,8-pentamethyl-chroman-6-yl) ester; TS-4, 2-(4,8-dimethyl-nonyl)-2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-chroman-6-ol; TS-5, 3-[2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-2-(4,8-dimethyl-nonyl)-chroman-6-yloxy]propionic acid; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide); ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% carbon dioxide. Normal human prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) were purchased from Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville, Inc. (East Tutherford, NJ). Cells were maintained in prostate epithelial cell medium with growth supplements at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% carbon dioxide. The recommended seeding density for subculture is 2,500 cells/cm2. It takes 6-9 days from subculture to attain confluency. Reagents—α-Tocopherol, α-tocopheryl succinate, 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethyl-6-chromanol, and other chemical reagents required for the synthesis of various analogues were purchased from Sigma Aldrich unless otherwise indicated. Synthesis of TS-1 (succinic acid mono-[2-(4,8-dimethyl-nonyl)-2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-chroman-6-yl] ester), TS-2 (succinic acid mono-[2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-2-(4-methyl-pentyl)-chroman-6-yl] ester), TS-3 (succinic acid mono-(2,2,5,7,8-pentamethyl-chroman-6-yl) ester), TS-4 (2-(4,8-dimethyl-nonyl)-2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-chroman-6-ol), and TS-5 (3-[2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-2-(4,8-dimethyl-nonyl)-chroman-6-yloxy]propionic acid) will be published elsewhere. The identity and purity (≥99%) of these synthetic derivatives were verified by proton nuclear magnetic resonance, high resolution mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis. MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide)) for cell viability assay were purchased form TCI America, Inc. (Portland, OR). The Cell Death Detection ELISA kit was purchased from Roche Diagnostics. Rabbit antibodies against Bcl-xL, Bax, Bak, Bid, PARP, and cleaved caspases-9 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Rabbit antibodies against Bad, cytochrome c, and mouse anti-Bcl-2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-actin was from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA). Cell Viability Analysis—The effect of individual test agents on cell viability was assessed by using the MTT assay in 6-12 replicates. PC3, LNCaP, and B3-LNCaP cells were seeded and incubated in poly-p-lysine-coated, 96-well, flat-bottomed plates in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS medium for 24 h. PrEC cells were seeded at the recommend density in 96-well, flat-bottomed plates in prostate epithelial cell medium with growth supplements for 3 days. All cells were exposed to various concentrations of test agents dissolved in ethanol (for α-tocopherol, α-tocopheryl succinate, and TS-3) or Me2SO (all other test agents used) with a final concentration of 0.1% in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium for PC3, LNCaP, and LNCaP/B3 cells or in prostate epithelial cell basal medium with growth supplements for PrEC cells. Controls received Me2SO or ethanol vehicle at a concentration equal to that in drug-treated cells. The medium was removed, replaced by 200 μl of 0.5 mm MTT in 10% FBS-containing RPMI 1640 medium, and cells were incubated in the CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 2 h. Supernatants were removed from the wells, and the reduced MTT dye was solubilized in 200 μl/well of Me2SO. Absorbance at 570 nm was determined on a plate reader. Apoptosis Detection by ELISA—Induction of apoptosis was assessed with a cell death detection ELISA kit (Roche Diagnostics) by following the manufacturer's instruction. This test is based on the quantitative determination of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments in the form of mononucleosomes and oligonucleosomes after induced apoptotic death. In brief, 5 × 106 cells were cultured in a T-25 flask in 10% FBS-containing medium for 24 h and were treated with the test agents at various concentrations in serum-free medium for 24 h. Both floating and adherent cells were collected; cell lysates equivalent to 5 × 105 cells were used in the ELISA. Western Blot Analysis of Cytochrome c Release into the Cytoplasm— Cytosolic-specific, mitochondria-free lysates were prepared according to an established procedure (18Yang C.C. Lin H.P. Chen C.S. Yang Y.T. Tseng P.H. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25872-25878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In brief, after individual treatments for 24 h, both the incubation medium and adherent cells in T-75 flasks were collected and centrifuged at 600 × g for 5 min. The pellet fraction was recovered, placed on ice, and triturated with 100 μl of a chilled hypotonic lysis solution (50 mm PIPES-KOH (pH 7.4) containing 220 mm mannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors including 100 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 80 nm aprotinin, 5 μm bestatin, 1.5 μm E-64 protease inhibitor, 2 μm leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin A). After a 45-min incubation on ice, the mixture was centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected in a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min. An equivalent amount of protein (50 μg) from each supernatant was resolved in 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Bands were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-cytochrome c antibodies as described below. Bcl-xL Knockdown by siRNA—To validate the role of Bcl-xL in α-tocopheryl succinate-mediated apoptosis, we used siRNA against Bcl-xL from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) to attenuate Bcl-xL expression in PC-3 cells. In brief, PC-3 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at the density of 4 × 105 cells/well in 2 ml of 10% FBS-supplemented RPMI 1640 medium and, after a 24-h incubation, were washed with 2 ml of antibiotic-free normal growth medium supplemented with 10% FBS. For each transfection, the indicated amount of siRNA duplex and 6 μlof siRNA transfection reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were each added into 100 μl of siRNA transfection medium (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), incubated for 5 min separately, mixed, incubated for additional 30 min, and added to 800 μl of siRNA transfection medium. This mixture was added to PC-3 cells in each well, and the transfected cells were incubated at 37 °C for 5 h, and an equal volume of 20% FBS-containing RPMI 1640 medium was added without removing the transfection medium. The transfected cells were incubated with the medium for another 36 h before cells were lysed for Western blot analysis of Bcl-xL expression. Immunoblotting—Cells were seeded in 10% FBS-containing RPMI 1640 medium for 24 h and treated with various agents as aforementioned. After individual treatments for 24 h, the adherent cells in T-25 or T-75 flasks were scraped, combined with the medium, and centrifuged at 2,200 rpm for 10 min. The supernatants were recovered, placed on ice, and triturated with 20-50 μl of a chilled lysis buffer (M-PER, mammalian protein extraction reagent, Pierce), to which was added 1% protease inhibitor mixture (set III, EMD Biosciences, Inc., San Diego, CA). After a 30-min incubation on ice, the mixture was centrifuged at 16,100 × g for 3 min. Two μl of the suspension was taken for protein analysis using the Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad); to the remaining solution the same volume of 2× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) was added. The mixture was boiled for 10 min. Equal amounts of proteins were loaded onto 8-12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, protein bands were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes in a semidry transfer cell. The transblotted membrane was blocked with Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) containing 5% nonfat milk for 90 min, and the membrane was incubated with the appropriate primary antibody in TBST, 5% nonfat milk at 4 °C overnight. After washing three times with TBST for a total of 45 min, the transblotted membrane was incubated with goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugates (diluted 1:1,000) for 1 h at room temperature and washed four times with TBST for a total of 1 h. The immunoblots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Competitive Fluorescence Polarization Assay—The binding affinity of the test agent to Bcl-XL was analyzed by a competitive fluorescence polarization assay in which the ability of the agent to displace the binding of a Bak BH3-domain peptide to either Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL was determined. Flu-BakBH3, a Bak-BH3 peptide labeled at the NH2 terminus with fluorescein, was purchased from Genemed Synthesis (San Francisco, CA). COOH-terminal-truncated, His-tagged Bcl-XL was purchased from EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA) and soluble glutathione S-transferase-fused Bcl-2 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The binding analysis was carried out in a dual path length quartz cell with readings taken at λem 480 nm and λex 530 nm at room temperature using a luminescence spectrometer according to an established procedure (19Shiau C.W. Yang C.C. Kulp S.K. Chen K.F. Chen C.S. Huang J.W. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 1561-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Determination of IC50 Values—Data from cell viability and fluorescence polarization assays were analyzed by using the CalcuSyn software (Biosoft, Ferguson, MO) to determine IC50 values, in which the calculation was based on the medium effect equation i.e. log(fa/fu) = mlog(D) - mlog(Dm), where fa and fu denote fraction affected and unaffected, respectively, m represents the Hill-type coefficient signifying the sigmoidicity of the dose-effect curve, and D and Dm are the dose used and IC50, respectively. Co-immunoprecipitation—PC3 cells treated with 40 μm α-tocopheryl succinate or 10 μm TS-1 for 24 h were scraped off the flask, transferred into centrifuge tubes, and centrifuged at 2,200 rpm for 10 min to pellet the cells. The pellet was resuspended in ice-cold 0.5 ml of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture) and gently mixed on an orbital shaker at 4 °C for 15 min, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min to yield cell lysates. These cell lysates were treated with 100 μl of protein A-agarose bead slurry followed by brief centrifugation to remove nonspecific binding proteins. Equal amounts of proteins from these lysates, as determined by the Bradford assay, were mixed with anti-Bcl-2 or anti Bcl-XL antibodies in an orbital shaker at 23 °C for 2 h, followed by 100 μl of protein A-agarose bead slurry at 4 °C for 12 h. The immunocomplex was collected by brief centrifugation, washed four times with 800 μl of ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, and suspended in 50 μl of 2× SDS sample loading buffer. The suspension was boiled for 10 min, cooled, and briefly centrifuged to remove the beads. Western blot analysis with antibodies against Bak as described above. Molecular Modeling—Human Bcl-xL crystal structure, obtained from the Brookhaven Protein Data bank (entry code of 1R2D) (20Manion M.K. O'Neill J.W. Giedt C.D. Kim K.M. Zhang K.Y. Hockenbery D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2159-2165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), was subject to the deletion of water molecules, the addition of all hydrogens, and the assignment of Gasteiger charges (21Gasteiger J. Marsili M. Tetrahedron. 1980; 36: 3219-3228Crossref Scopus (3563) Google Scholar) and then nonpolar hydrogens were merged. Three-dimensional affinity grids centered on the Bak peptide-binding site with 0.375-Å spacing were calculated for each of the following atom types: (a) protein, A (aromatic C), C, HD, N, NA, OA, SA; (b) ligands, C, A, N, NA, OA, S, SA, HD, Br, e (electrostatic), and d (desolvation) using Autogrid4. AutoDock version 4.0.0 was used for the docking simulation. We selected the Lamarckian genetic algorithm for ligand conformational searching because it has enhanced performance relative to simulated annealing or the simple genetic algorithm. The translation, rotation, and internal torsions of the ligand are defined as its state variables, and each gene represents a state variable. The Lamarckian genetic algorithm adds local minimization to the genetic algorithm, enabling modification of the gene population. For each compound, the docking parameters were as follows: trials of 100 dockings, population size of 150, random starting position and conformation, translation step ranges of 2.0 Å, rotation step ranges of 50°, elitism of 1, mutation rate of 0.02, crossover rate of 0.8, local search rate of 0.06, and 100 million energy evaluations. Final docked conformations were clustered using a tolerance of 2.0 Å root mean square deviation. Differential Susceptibility of LNCaP and PC-3 Prostate Cancer Cell Lines to α-Tocopheryl Succinate—As part of our effort to understand the mode of action of α-tocopheryl succinate, we examined its antiproliferative effect in two human prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP and PC-3. Of these two types of cells, LNCaP cells were more susceptible to the proliferation inhibition than PC-3 cells, with IC50 values of 15 and 40 μm, respectively, in serum-free medium (Fig. 1A, curves b and a, respectively). This reduction in cell viability was, at least in part, resulting from mitochondria-dependent apoptosis induction, as evidenced by DNA fragmentation, cytochrome c release, and PARP cleavage (Fig. 1B). As both LNCaP and PC-3 cells exhibit up-regulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling due to loss of PTEN function, this differential sensitivity might be attributable to differences in the respective ability to maintain mitochondrial integrity in response to apoptotic signals. Data from this and other laboratories have demonstrated that PC-3 cells were resistant to the apoptosis-inducing effect of many therapeutic agents because of Bcl-xL overexpression (18Yang C.C. Lin H.P. Chen C.S. Yang Y.T. Tseng P.H. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25872-25878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Li X. Marani M. Mannucci R. Kinsey B. Andriani F. Nicoletti I. Denner L. Marcelli M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1699-1706PubMed Google Scholar). This premise is supported by the inverse relationship between increased expression levels of Bcl-xL and susceptibility to the apoptosis-inducing effects of α-tocopheryl succinate in these three cell lines. For example, in the presence of 5% FBS, the IC50 values of α-tocopheryl succinate in inducing apoptosis in LNCaP and PC-3 cells were 25 and 53 μm, respectively (Fig. 1, C and D). This decrease in sensitivity was associated with serum-stimulated increases in Bcl-xL expression in both cell lines (Fig. C, inset). Ectopic Bcl-xL Expression Protects LNCaP Cells from α-Tocopheryl Succinate-induced Apoptosis—To establish a mechanistic link between Bcl-xL and α-tocopheryl succinate-induced cell death, we assessed the effect of enforced Bcl-xL expression in a stably transfected LNCaP clone (LNCaP/B3). The expression level of ectopic Bcl-xL in B3 cells was ∼5-fold of that of the endogenous counterpart in PC-3 cells (Fig. 1A, inset), whereas that of Bcl-2 was slightly lower in the LNCaP/B3 cells (18Yang C.C. Lin H.P. Chen C.S. Yang Y.T. Tseng P.H. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25872-25878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The high level of ectopic Bcl-xL expression in LNCaP/B3 cells substantially increased the resistance of LNCaP cells to α-tocopheryl succinate-induced cell death, to a degree greater than that of PC-3 cells (Fig. 1A). α-Tocopheryl Succinate Is an Inhibitor of Bcl-xL Function—The above finding suggested that α-tocopheryl succinate-mediated apoptosis might involve the modulation of the function of Bcl-xL and/or other Bcl-2 members. Accordingly, we examined this putative link at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. First, we assessed the dose-dependent effect of α-tocopheryl succinate on the expression of different Bcl-2 family members in PC-3 cells, including Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, Bax, Bak, Bad, and Bid by Western blotting. Fig. 2A indicates that with the exception of a decrease in Bad expression, the exposure to α-tocopheryl succinate did not cause appreciable changes in the expression level of these Bcl-2 members. Second, we used a competitive fluorescence polarization analysis to investigate the effect of α-tocopheryl succinate on the binding of a fluorescein-labeled Bak BH3 domain peptide to Bcl-xL and Bcl-2. Fig. 2B depicts the ability of α-tocopheryl succinate to disrupt the BH3 domain-mediated interactions with Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 with equal potency, with IC50 of 26 ± 2 μm. To confirm the mode of action of α-tocopheryl succinate, we assessed the intracellular effects on the dynamics of Bcl-xL/Bak and Bcl-2/Bak interactions in PC-3 cells. Lysates from PC-3 cells treated with α-tocopheryl succinate vis à vis Me2SO vehicle for 12 h were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against Bcl-xL or Bcl-2. Probing of the immunoprecipitates with anti-Bak antibodies by Western blotting indicates that the level of Bak associated with Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 was significantly reduced compared with the Me2SO control (Fig. 2C, upper panel). This decrease in intracellular association bore out the above in vitro binding data. As Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 abrogated the effects of Bak and other proapoptotic Bcl-2 members through BH3 domain-mediated heterodimerization, we also showed that this decrease in Bak binding was accompanied by caspase-9 activation in a dose-dependent manner in drug-treated cells (Fig, 2C, lower panel). Together, these data demonstrate that the effect of α-tocopheryl succinate on apoptosis in prostate cancer cells was, at least in part, mediated through the inhibition of Bcl-xL function by disrupting BH3 domain-mediated heterodimerization. From a translational perspective, this mechanistic finding provided a molecular basis to structurally optimize this agent to develop potent Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 binding inhibitors. Validation of the Involvement of Bcl-xL in α-Tocopheryl Succinate-mediated Apoptotic Death—To validate the role of Bcl-xL in α-tocopheryl succinate-induced apoptosis, we used siRNA to knockdown the expression of Bcl-xL in PC-3 cells (Fig. 3). As shown, repression of Bcl-xL led to enhanced apoptotic death in a dose-dependent manner, as evidenced by increases in cytochrome c release, PARP cleavage, and nucleosome formation. Molecular Docking of α-Tocopheryl Succinate into the Bak Peptide-binding Site of Bcl-xL—α-Tocopheryl succinate was docked into the Bak peptide-binding site that is located in a hydrophobic cleft bound by the BH1, BH2, and BH3 regions of Bcl-xL (20Manion M.K.

Gross J.D. Yuan J. Wagner G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 1234-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A docking analysis indicates that α-tocopheryl succinate adopted a unique hairpin-shaped conformation in interacting with this hydrophobic pocket (Fig. 4A). As shown, the carboxyl terminus of the hemisuccinate formed electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding with the guanidino side chain of Arg-100. Although the chroman aromatic ring interacted with Tyr-101 and Phe-105 through π-π interactions, the phytyl chain coiled back to gain access to the hydrophobic side chain of Leu-108, Leu-130, and Ala-142. However, the terminal isopranyl unit of the aliphatic long chain overhung into a polar region that consisted of Asn-136, the amide backbone of Trp-137, Gly-138, Arg-130 located at the beginning end of a large helical dipole, and solvent. α-Tocopheryl Succinate Derivatives with Truncated Side Chains Exhibit Higher Potency in Bcl-xL Inhibition—This computer model shed light onto the mode of binding of α-tocopheryl succinate to Bcl-xL and provided a molecular basis for structural optimization. We rationalized that the hemisuccinate and the two proximal isopranyl units of the side chain play a crucial role in ligand anchoring and stabilization of the protein-ligand complex, respectively. However, exposure of the distal isopranyl unit to a polar environment might diminish the binding affinity of α-tocopheryl succinate. This premise was corroborated by docking TS-1, an analogue with one isopranyl unit removed from the phytyl side chain, into the Bcl-xL binding domain (Fig. 4B). The mode of binding of this truncated analogue was analogous to that of α-tocopheryl succinate, however, without the unfavorable interaction with the polar milieu. Theoretical ΔGbinding values were calculated to be -7.5 kcal/mol and -8.1 kcal/mol for α-tocopheryl succinate and TS-1, respectively, of which the discrepancy would give rise to a 3-fold difference in binding affinity. To validate the above modeling data, we carried out structural modifications of α-tocopheryl succinate by gradually removing the isopranyl unit from its phytyl side chain, yielding TS-1, TS-2, and TS-3 (Fig. 5A). In addition, TS-4 and TS-5 were synthesized to verify the role of the terminal carboxylic function in ligand anchoring, which represented TS-1 analogues with the hemisuccinate removed and replaced with an ether-linked propionate, respectively. Functional assays indicate that the potency of these derivatives vis à vis α-tocopheryl succinate in inhibiting Bak peptide-Bcl-xL binding paralleled that of suppressing cell viability (Fig. 5B). The potency was in the order of TS-1, TS-5 > TS-2 > α-tocopheryl succinate, whereas TS-3 and TS-4 lacked appreciable activity even at 100 μm. There existed a 3-fold difference in IC50 between TS-1 and α-tocopheryl succinate in blocking Bak peptide binding to Bcl-xL, which is consistent with that of the theoretical calculation. The differential inhibitory activity among α-tocopheryl succinate and its truncated analogues underlies the subtle impact of the length of the hydrophobic side chain on Bcl-xL binding. However, complete removal of the side chain in TS-3 abrogated the binding affinity, supporting the role of this hydrophobic interaction in the stabilization of protein-ligand complexes. In addition, replacement of the succinate with an ether-linked propionate had no effect on the Bcl-xL binding and antiproliferative activities. This finding suggests that the carbonyl group of the hemisuccinate ester linkage was not involved in ligand binding, consistent with the modeled recognition mode (Fig. 4). Evidence indicates that TS-1 mediated antiproliferative effects in PC-3 cells through the same mechanism as α-tocopheryl succinate. TS-1-induced apoptotic death was evidenced by DNA fragmentation, cytochrome c release, and PARP cleavage (Fig. 6A). Moreover, 10 μm TS-1 abolished the intracellular binding of Bak to Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 in PC-3 cells (Fig. 6B). As shown in Fig. 6C, normal PrECs were resistant to the antiproliferative effect of α-tocopheryl succinate, TS-1, and TS-5 even at high doses, whereas PC-3 cells exhibited differential susceptibility to these agents under the same conditions. This differential sensitivity between PrECs and PC-3 cells indicates that the effect of TS-1 and TS-3 on apoptosis was tumor cell-specific. Although the antitumor effect of α-tocopheryl succinate has been the focus of many recent investigations, the underlying mechanism has not yet been fully characterized. Here, we obtained several lines of evidence that inhibition of Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 function represents a major mechanism by which α-tocopheryl succinate mediates antitumor effect in prostate cancer cells. First, high expression levels of Bcl-xL render PC-3 and LNCaP/B3 cells resistant to α-tocopheryl succinate-induced apoptosis. Second, fluorescence polarization analysis demonstrates that α-tocopheryl succinate disrupted the binding of the Bak BH3 peptide to Bcl-xL. Third, the immunoprecipitation study demonstrates that the level of Bak associated with Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 was greatly reduced in drug-treated cells compared with Me2SO control. Fourth, the docking analysis of α-tocopheryl succinate into the Bak peptide-binding domain of Bcl-xL led to the development of more potent Bcl-xL inhibitors. α-Tocopheryl succinate exhibited equal potency in blocking Bak BH3 peptide binding to Bcl-xL and Bcl-2. Considering the pivotal role of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 in regulating mitochondrial integrity, this mode of action provides a molecular framework to account for the effect of α-tocopheryl succinate on apoptotic death in cancer cells. More importantly, it constituted a mechanistic basis for the structural optimization of α-tocopheryl succinate to generate more potent Bcl-xL inhibitors such as TS-1 and TS-5. The ability of these inhibitors to disrupt the dynamics in the interactions between antiapoptotic and proapoptotic Bcl-2 members leads to the release of cytochrome c, thereby activating the apoptosis machinery. Previously, we obtained evidence that Bcl-xL overexpression provides a distinct survival mechanism independent of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling in prostate cancer cells (18Yang C.C.

Consequently, these α-tocopheryl succinate-derived Bcl-xL inhibitors have translational relevance to be developed into antitumor agents for the prevention and/or therapy of cancer alone or in combination with other treatment. For example, α-tocopheryl succinate has been reported to sensitize Jurkat T lymphocytes to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (14Dalen H. Neuzil J. Br. J. Cancer. 2003; 88: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Consequently, validation of the involvement of Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 inhibition in α-tocopheryl succinate-mediated chemosensitization and further structure-based optimization of TS-1 are currently under way."
https://openalex.org/W2108403392,"A key unresolved question regarding the basic function of voltage-gated ion channels is how movement of the voltage sensor is coupled to channel opening. We previously proposed that the S4-S5 linker couples voltage sensor movement to the S6 domain in the human ether-a'-go-go-related gene (hERG) K+ channel. The recently solved crystal structure of the voltage-gated Kv1.2 channel reveals that the S4-S5 linker is the structural link between the voltage sensing and pore domains. In this study, we used chimeras constructed from hERG and ether-a'-go-go (EAG) channels to identify interactions between residues in the S4-S5 linker and S6 domain that were critical for stabilizing the channel in a closed state. To verify the spatial proximity of these regions, we introduced cysteines in the S4-S5 linker and at the C-terminal end of the S6 domain and then probed for the effect of oxidation. The D540C-L666C channel current decreased in an oxidizing environment in a state-dependent manner consistent with formation of a disulfide bond that locked the channel in a closed state. Disulfide bond formation also restricted movement of the voltage sensor, as measured by gating currents. Taken together, these data confirm that the S4-S5 linker directly couples voltage sensor movement to the activation gate. Moreover, rather than functioning simply as a mechanical lever, these findings imply that specific interactions between the S4-S5 linker and the activation gate stabilize the closed channel conformation.

Moreover, rather than functioning simply as a mechanical lever, these findings imply that specific interactions between the S4-S5 linker and the activation gate stabilize the closed channel conformation. A fundamental property of all voltage-gated ion channels is the ability to open or close in response to changes in membrane potential. In voltage-gated K+ channels, the transmembrane domains are partitioned into distinct functional modules: a voltage-sensing module (S1-S4) and an ion-conducting module (S5-S6). Changes in the transmembrane electrical field exert a force on the highly charged S4 domain to initiate a process that culminates in the opening of the activation gate (1Bezanilla F. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 555-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). The activation gate is formed by crisscrossing of the C-terminal portions of the S6 α-helices to form a narrow aperture near the cytoplasmic interface (2Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5770) Google Scholar). Channel opening is proposed to involve splaying of the S6 helices at a conserved glycine, thereby widening the aperture to allow passage of ions (3Jiang Y. Lee A. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 4Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Although substantial progress has been made in defining the structural basis of the voltage sensor and activation gate, the mechanism of coupling voltage sensing to channel opening, “electromechanical coupling” (5Long S.B. Campbell E.B. Mackinnon R. Science. 2005; 309: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar), remains poorly defined. Electromechanical coupling may involve global rearrangements between large domains within the channel complex, for example, outward movement of S4 coupled to rearrangements in S5 that are transmitted to S6. Alternatively, the coupling mechanism might involve discreet interactions between specific residues in more localized regions. The intracellular S4-S5 linker is ideally suited to function as an electromechanical coupler given that it is physically tethered to the S4 and, as such, could function to transduce voltage sensor movement. Mutations in the S4-S5 linker of a variety of K+ channels influence activation and gating charge movement (6McCormack K. Tanouye M.A. Iverson L.E. Lin J.W. Ramaswami M. McCormack T. Campanelli J.T.

Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels with a mutation in the S4-S5 linker behave as though the link between voltage sensing, and channel opening was severed (11Chen J.

A direct interaction between the S4-S5 linker and C-terminal portion of the S6 domain (C-S6) was suggested by studies designed to impart voltage sensitivity to the voltage-independent KcsA channel. A chimera containing the pore module of KcsA and the voltage-sensing module of Shaker gated in a voltage-dependent manner only if S4-S5 linker and a 9-amino-acid stretch of C-S6 residues from Shaker were included in the chimera (12Lu Z.

We proposed that an interaction between the S4-S5 linker and C-S6 was also important in stabilizing the closed conformation of the hERG 2The abbreviations used are: hERG, human ether-a-go-go-related gene; bEAG, bovine ether-a'-go-go; HP, holding potential; Ig, gating current; IgON, on gating current; IgOFF, off gating current; tbHO2, tert-butylhydroperoxide; DTT, dithiothreitol; WT, wild type; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.

Chen J. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18994-19000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). A charge reversal of a single residue in the S4-S5 linker (D540K) destabilized the closed state of hERG channels via an electrostatic interaction with an arginine in C-S6 (Arg-665). Most recently, a mechanism to explain electromechanical coupling was proposed based on the crystal structure of the mammalian voltagegated Kv1.2 channel solved in the open state (5Long S.B. Campbell E.B. Mackinnon R. Science. 2005; 309: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar, 16Long S.B. Campbell E.B. Mackinnon R. Science. 2005; 309: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1858) Google Scholar). The S4-S5 linker forms an amphipathic α-helix running parallel to the cytoplasmic interface and is positioned over the C-S6 from the same subunit. Inward movement of the voltage sensor with membrane hyperpolarization is postulated to compress the S4-S5 linker against the S6 helices, resulting in closure of the activation gate (5Long S.B. Campbell E.B. Mackinnon R. Science. 2005; 309: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). To date, a direct physical interaction between the S4-S5 linker and the activation gate has not been established unequivocally. In this study, we used chimeras constructed from hERG and the related bovine ether-a'-go-go (bEAG) channel to identify residues in the S4-S5 linker and C-S6 that were important for normal channel closure. We introduced cysteines into these regions and demonstrated that D540C-L666C current was decreased by oxidation in a state-dependent manner associated with reduced gating current. These data suggest that electromechanical coupling is transduced via the S4-S5 linker. Moreover, rather than functioning simply as a mechanical lever, our study suggests a stringent requirement for specific residues in the S4-S5 linker and the activation gate to stabilize the channel in a closed conformation. Molecular Biology—Site-directed mutagenesis, in vitro synthesis, and injection of cRNA into Xenopus laevis oocytes were performed as described previously (15Tristani-Firouzi M. Chen J. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18994-19000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with 2-15 ng of WT or mutant hERG cRNA and incubated for 3 days as described (15Tristani-Firouzi M. Chen J. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18994-19000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The HBS6 chimera was a kind gift of E. Ficker. Electrophysiology—Ionic currents were measured with the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique using a GeneClamp 500 amplifier (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA). Voltage commands were generated using pCLAMP8 software (Molecular Devices), a personal computer, and a DigiData 1320 interface (Molecular Devices). Recordings were performed at room temperature (22-24 °C). Currents were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 2 kHz. Microelectrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillary tubes and had resistances of 0.8-1.5 megaohms when filled with 3 m KCl. For hERG-bEAG chimera recordings, the extracellular solution contained (in mm): 96 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.6. For hERG Cys mutant recordings, the extracellular solution contained (in mm): 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 CaCl2,2MgCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.6. The recording chamber was perfused at a rate of ∼1 ml/min. Gating currents were measured at room temperature using the cutopen Vaseline gap (17Stefani E. Bezanilla F. Conn P.N. Methods in Enzymology. 293. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 300-318Google Scholar) recording technique and a CA-1B amplifier (Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN). Recordings were performed at room temperature. Signals were filtered at 5 kHz with an eight-pole Bessel filter and acquired at 20 kHz. Microelectrodes were filled with 3 m KCl to obtain resistances of 0.1-0.2 megaohms. The extracellular solution (top and guard chambers) consisted of (in mm): 120 tetraethylammonium-MES, 2 Ca-MES, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, and the intracellular solution consisted of (in mm): 120 tetraethylammonium-MES, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. The oocyte was permeabilized by adding 0.2% saponin to the lower chamber for 2 min. Intracellular K+ was depleted by clamping the membrane to 0 mV for 30 min. To ensure complete block of hERG channels, the specific hERG blocker MK-499 (50 μm) was added to the external and internal solutions after depletion of intracellular K+ as described (18Piper D.R. Varghese A. Sanguinetti M.C. Tristani-Firouzi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10534-10539Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Linear leak and capacitance currents were partially compensated by analog circuitry and subtracted on-line using a p/-8 protocol. (19Armstrong C.M. Bezanilla F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 70: 567-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar) from a pre-pulse potential of -140 or -160 mV and a holding potential (HP) of -110 mV. Non-linear transient currents were not detected in uninjected oocytes, indicating that gating currents detected in hERG-injected oocytes were not contaminated by constitutively expressed channels. Data Analysis—The isochronal voltage dependence of the activation of WT and mutant hERG channels was determined from tail current amplitudes measured at -70 or -120 mV following 2-s depolarizing voltage steps that were applied from an HP of -90 or -120 mV as described (15Tristani-Firouzi M. Chen J. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18994-19000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Tail current amplitude was plotted versus test potential (Vt) and fitted to a Boltzmann function using ORIGIN software (Northampton, MA) I=Imax/(1+exp[(V1/2-Vt)/k])(Eq. 1) where V1/2 is the voltage at which the currents are half-activated and k is the slope factor. Imax represents the maximum tail current value. All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Substitution of bEAG S6 Domain into hERG Disrupts Channel Closure—Ficker et al. (20Ficker E. Jarolimek W. Kiehn J. Baumann A. Brown A.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) reported that insertion of the entire S6 domain (including the first 5 residues of the C terminus) of bEAG into hERG (HBS6 chimera) disrupted activation gating such that channels appeared to be constitutively open at negative potentials. This is an unexpected finding given the high homology (81%) between the S6 domains of these channels and suggests a stringent requirement for specific residues to stabilize the activation gate in its closed conformation. WT hERG and HBS6 currents elicited by voltage steps to potentials between -150 and +40 mV from an HP of -120 mV are compared in Fig. 1, A and B. Membrane hyperpolarization did not elicit the opening of WT hERG channels (Fig. 1A). Depolarization evoked typical slowly activating, rapidly inactivating WT hERG currents. Subsequent repolarization elicited tail currents that represented recovery of channels that were inactivated by the preceding voltage step followed by deactivation. By contrast, HBS6 chimeric channels were open at HP of -120 mV, as evidenced by an inward holding current (Fig. 1B) that was eliminated by the application of the hERG channel blocker terfenadine (Fig. 1C). Hyperpolarizing and depolarizing voltage steps elicited nearly instantaneous inward and outward currents that resembled an inward rectifier channel (Fig. 1, B and D). Repolarization to -120 mV revealed tail currents that represented the recovery of channels from inactivation followed by slow and incomplete channel deactivation. Thus, HBS6 chimeric channels partially closed, leaving a constitutive conductance at hyperpolarized potentials. Voltage steps to potentials as negative as -170 mV failed to induce complete channel closure (Fig. 1D). The HBS6 activation curve indicated that a proportion of channels (0.16 ± 0.02) remain opened at -150 mV (Fig. 1E). In addition, the HBS6 activation curve was shifted by -51 mV when compared with WT hERG (Fig. 1E). Thus, despite the homology, the S6 helix of bEAG was unable to achieve a stable closed conformation when inserted into the hERG channel background. Channel Closure Is Normalized by Restoring C-terminal S6 Residues—To determine the residues responsible for destabilizing the closed conformation of the HBS6 chimera, we sequentially restored C-terminal HBS6 residues back to native hERG. Restoring just the C terminus back to hERG (residues Tyr-667-Ala-671, chimera A) failed to normalize channel closure, as evidenced by the inward holding current at -120 mV (Fig. 2A). Mutating 2 additional residues at the end of the S6 domain (Arg-665-Ala-671, chimera B) restored channel closure (Fig. 2B). Further restoration of S6 residues (Ser-660-Ala-671, chimera C) resulted in a channel that behaved more similar to WT hERG (Fig. 2C). Concordance between the S4-S5 Linker and C-terminal S6 Residues Restores Channel Closure—Because channel closure was normalized by mutating residues in the S6 proper (chimera B), we tested the effect of restoring only the last 2 amino acids of the S6 domain (Arg-665 and Leu-666) in the background of the HBS6 chimera (HBS6-Arg-665-Leu-666). Channel closure was normalized in the HBS6-Arg-665-Leu-666 chimera (Fig. 3, A and C). We reasoned that these channels were able to close properly because the HBS6-Arg-665-Leu-666 chimera contained hERG sequences in both the S4-S5 linker and C-S6, that is, both regions were concordant for hERG amino acid sequence. Conversely, discordance between the S4-S5 linker and the activation gate might explain the disrupted channel closure in the HBS6 chimera. To test this hypothesis, we mutated the residues in the HBS6 S4-S5 linker to match the bEAG sequence such that S4-S5 linker and S6 would both contain bEAG sequences. The S4-S5 linker of hERG differs from bEAG at two sites, Arg-541 and Ser-543 (Fig. 3B, inset). The mutations R541H and S543I in the background of the HBS6 chimera (HBS6-His-541-Ile-543) also restored channel closure (Fig. 3, B and C). Thus, discordance between the sequence of the S4-S5 linker and C-terminal S6 domain destabilized the closed conformation of the HBS6 chimera, allowing a constitutive conductance. This is an unexpected observation given the high homology between these related channels and illustrates that specific interactions between these two regions are required to effectively seal the activation gate. Cross-linking between Introduced Cys in the S4-S5 Linker and C-terminal S6 Residues—We previously proposed that an electrostatic interaction between Asp-540 and Arg-665 stabilizes the closed conformation of hERG channels (15Tristani-Firouzi M. Chen J. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18994-19000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In addition to Arg-665, the HBS6 chimera studies identified Leu-666 as a critical residue for stabilizing the closed conformation. To determine whether Asp-540, Arg-665, and Leu-666 are located within atomic distances, we introduced cysteines at these positions and probed the effect of oxidation on current magnitude. We reasoned that formation of a disulfide bond between these regions would lock the channel in a single state. The membrane-permeable oxidizing agent tert-butylhydroperoxide (tbHO2) was used in this study because the residues of interest are located near the intracellular portion of the membrane. Cells were repetitively pulsed (once every 10 s) to +40 mV for 2 s to activate and inactivate channels and then repolarized to -70 mV to measure peak tail currents (Itail). Following stabilization of the tail currents, 2 mm tbHO2 was perfused while cycling through the voltage protocol. After 8 min of tbHO2 application, cells were washed with normal extracellular solution. As shown in Fig. 4A, WT hERG tail current decreased minimally with tbHO2 treatment (normalized Itail = 0.86 ± 0.03, n = 5). D540C current increased slightly in the presence of tbHO2 (normalized Itail = 1.19 ± 0.04, n = 5), whereas D540C-R665C current decreased minimally (normalized Itail = 0.89 ± 0.02, n = 5). By contrast, D540C-L666C current dramatically decreased during tbHO2 treatment (normalized Itail = 0.15 ± 0.02, n = 10), an effect that was not reversed by washing with normal extracellular solution (normalized Itail = 0.10 ± 0.01, Fig. 4, A-C). Tail currents recorded from the single Cys mutant L666C decreased slightly with tbHO2 application (normalized Itail = 0.72 ± 0.02, n = 13; Fig. 4A), confirming that the dramatic reduction in current observed with D540C-L666C was specific. The marked reduction in D540C-L666C current induced by tbHO2 implied that formation of a disulfide bond between the S4-S5 linker and C-S6 locked the channel in a non-conducting state. To determine whether the putative disulfide bond could be reversed with a reducing agent, cells expressing D540C-L666C hERG were exposed to 0.5 mm tbHO2 followed by either 20 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) or normal extracellular solution (Fig. 4D). DTT partially reversed the effect of tbHO2 by increasing current to 0.78 ± 0.04 of control values (Fig. 4D, red curve, n = 5) when compared with 0.22 ± 0.01 for cells perfused with normal external solution (Fig. 4D, black curve, n = 6). To determine the state dependence of the tbHO2 effect on D540C-L666C channels, cells were held continuously at -90 mV (closed) or +40 mV (open/inactivated) during the application of 2 mm tbHO2 (Fig. 5A). When D540C-L666C channels were maintained in the closed state and exposed to tbHO2, current was markedly reduced following a step depolarization (normalized Itail = 0.12 ± 0.04, n = 7; Fig. 5, B and D). Holding D540C-L666C channels in the open/inactivated state during tbHO2 protected the channels from being irreversibly modified (normalized Itail = 1.04 ± 0.21, n = 6; Fig. 5, C and D). These observations indicate that β-carbons of Asp-540 and Leu-666 are adjacent in the closed state and move away from each other in the open/inactivated states. Cys Cross-linking between the S4-S5 Linker and C-terminal S6 Restricts Movement of the Voltage Sensor—If D540C and L666C form a disulfide bond in the closed state and prevent channel opening, one might predict that voltage sensor movement would be prevented by oxidation. To test this hypothesis, we measured gating currents (Ig) before and after tbHO2 application. Ig was elicited by a 50-ms voltage step to +40 mV from a prepulse potential of -140 mV for D540C-L666C channels and a 20-ms voltage step to +40 mV from a prepulse potential of -160 mV for D540C. As we reported previously, charge reversal or neutralization of Asp-540 markedly accelerates the rate of hERG channel activation (8Sanguinetti M.C. Xu Q.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 514: 667-675Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 21Piper D.R. Hinz W.A. Tallurri C.K. Sanguinetti M.C. Tristani-Firouzi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7206-7217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), shifts the charge-voltage relationship in the hyperpolarizing direction, and increases the rate of IgON and IgOFF (21Piper D.R. Hinz W.A. Tallurri C.K. Sanguinetti M.C. Tristani-Firouzi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7206-7217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Likewise, the kinetics of IgON and IgOFF were also fast for D540C-L666C and D540C channels (Fig. 6), an effect most likely attributable to mutation of Asp-540. Ig measurements were repeated after 2 mm tbHO2 was applied to the external solution (top and guard chambers) for 8 min while cells were cycled through 2-s step depolarizations to +40 mV. The application of tbHO2 markedly reduced D540C-L666C Ig, with minimal effect on D540C Ig (Fig. 6). The integral of IgON at +40 mV (QON) was 0.24 ± 0.03 of control values for D540C-L666C (n = 6) and 0.75 ± 0.06 for D540C (n = 5). WT hERG Ig was unaffected by tbHO2 treatment (data not shown). Taken together with the chimera data, the observation that disulfide bond formation reduces D540C-L666C Ig suggests that the S4-S5 linker couples movement of the S4 voltage sensor directly to the activation gate in S6. Although considerable effort has been directed toward defining the structural basis of the voltage sensor and the activation gate, the mechanism of electromechanical coupling in voltage-gated ion channels remains unclear. We and others proposed that the cytoplasmic S4-S5 linker transduces voltage sensor movement to the activation gate in the C-terminal S6 region (13Lu Z. Klem A.M. Ramu Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 663-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 15Tristani-Firouzi M. Chen J. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18994-19000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the crystal structure of the voltage-gated Kv1.2 channel confirmed that the S4-S5 linker and the C-terminal S6 domain are within atomic proximity (16Long S.B. Campbell E.B. Mackinnon R. Science. 2005; 309: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1858) Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structure of Kv1.2, Mackinnon and colleagues (5Long S.B. Campbell E.B. Mackinnon R. Science. 2005; 309: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar) proposed that the S4-S5 linker functions as a lever that exerts a mechanical force on the activation gate, driven by the electrical driving force of the transmembrane potential. Our findings imply that there are stringent requirements for the S4-S5 linker to efficiently function as a mechanical lever to stabilize the closed channel conformation. Discordance between the amino acid sequences of the S4-S5 linker and the end of S6 in the HBS6 chimera disrupted the stability of the helical bundle crossing such that passage of ions was permitted at potentials at which the activation gate is normally closed. Mutations in the activation gate of Shaker also dramatically disrupt channel closure, resulting in a biophysical phenotype similar to that of the HBS6 chimera. Mutation of the 2nd proline in the Pro-Val-Pro motif of Shaker resulted in a constitutive conductance at hyperpolarized potentials and further voltage-dependent opening at depolarized potentials (22Hackos D.H. Chang T.H. Swartz K.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 23Sukhareva M. Hackos D.H. Swartz K.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 541-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The constitutive conductance of these mutants was independent of voltage sensor movement (23Sukhareva M. Hackos D.H. Swartz K.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 541-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Single channel recordings at negative potentials revealed rapid, poorly resolved transitions between subconductance levels, consistent with disruption of the activation gate. The authors described the effect of the Pro mutations as an alteration in the equilibrium between the closed and open states (23Sukhareva M. Hackos D.H. Swartz K.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 541-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Likewise, the voltage independence of the constitutive conductance at hyperpolarized potentials in the HBS6 chimera implies that ion conduction occurs independent of movement of the voltage sensors. Presumably, the position of the activation gate with respect to the S4-S5 linker is altered such that the activation gate can achieve a conducting position at negative potentials. Effective channel closure is restored when the S4-S5 linker and C-terminal S6 amino acid sequences are concordant. Discordance between the S4-S5 linker and the S6 region in the Shaker-KcsA chimera also disrupted channel closure, independent of voltage sensor movement (13Lu Z. Klem A.M. Ramu Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 663-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Moreover, concordant Shaker sequences in these two regions was required for voltage-dependent gating (12Lu Z. Klem A.M. Ramu Y. Nature. 2001; 413: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 13Lu Z. Klem A.M. Ramu Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 663-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies support the idea that the S4-S5 linker and the C-terminal S6 region interact to seal the activation gate in its closed conformation. Our findings suggest that D540C and L666C form a disulfide bond under oxidizing conditions to lock the channel in the closed state and restrict movement of the voltage sensor. In the absence of biochemical evidence, disulfide bond formation between these 2 residues is strongly suggested by the state-dependent modification of D540C-L666C channels (but not the single Cys mutants D540C or L666C) and the ability to reverse modification with the reducing agent DTT. Formation of a disulfide bond between 2 Cys requires that the respective β-carbons are located within 5 Å and oriented orthogonally (24Careaga C.L. Falke J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1219-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 25Creighton T.E. Proteins: Structures and Molecular Properties.2nd Ed. W.H. Freeman and Company, New York1997: 18Google Scholar). Although we cannot exclude the possibility that D540C or L666C interact with an endogenous cysteine, our data are consistent with the notion that D540C and L666C are within 5 Å in the closed state and move away from each other in the open/inactivated states. The β-carbons of the homologous amino acids in Kv1.2 (Lys-312 and Phe-416) are separated by ∼11 Å in the open channel state (Fig. 7, top panel), consistent with the finding that membrane depolarization protected D540C-L666C channels from modification. How would Asp-540, located near the end of the S4 helix, move to a position adjacent to the end of the S6 helix in the closed state? As proposed by Mackinnon and colleagues (5Long S.B. Campbell E.B. Mackinnon R. Science. 2005; 309: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar), inward movement of the S4 helix induced by membrane repolarization would force the S4-S5 linker against the C-terminal end of S6, narrowing the aperture of the activation gate and repositioning Asp-540 near Leu-666. Although this implies a relatively large rearrangement of the S4-S5 linker with respect to S6 (Fig. 7), interhelical rearrangements of up to 15 Å have been reported in other membrane proteins by disulfide trapping techniques (24Careaga C.L. Falke J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1219-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Repacking of the S4-S5 linker against the S6 domain could occur as the result of any one of the proposed models of S4 movement, including the sliding helix model (1Bezanilla F. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 555-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 26Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 953-985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), “paddle” movement (27Jiang Y. Ruta V. Chen J. Lee A. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2003; 423: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar), or tilting of the S4 helix (28Chanda B. Asamoah O.K. Blunck R. Roux B. Bezanilla F. Nature. 2005; 436: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The absence of modification between D540C and R665C suggests either that the distance between these residues in the closed state exceeds 5 Å or that the geometry of the β-carbons is unfavorable for disulfide bond formation (24Careaga C.L. Falke J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1219-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). We favor the latter explanation given our previous mutational analysis of the S4-S5 linker and C-terminal S6 domain in hERG. The charge reversing mutation D540K destabilized the closed hERG channel conformation, enabling channel reopening with membrane hyperpolarization. This closed state disruption was dependent upon an electrostatic interaction between residues in positions 540 and 665 (15Tristani-Firouzi M. Chen J. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18994-19000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Charge neutralization of Arg-665 slows channel closure, whereas charge reversal either is not tolerated (R665E) or causes marked slowing of deactivation (R665D) (15Tristani-Firouzi M. Chen J. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18994-19000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), supporting a role for this residue in modulating the stability of the closed state of hERG channels. Mutational analysis of the homologous C-S6 residues in Shaker further underscores the importance of this region in coupling to the voltage sensor (29Ding S. Horn R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 30Ding S. Horn R. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These observations, however, do not preclude a role for other regions of the channel in coupling voltage sensing to channel opening. Although a role for the S4-S5 linker in electromechanical coupling has been previously proposed (5Long S.B. Campbell E.B. Mackinnon R.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15653-15658Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), our data define a direct interaction between the S4-S5 linker and the activation gate in the process of coupling voltage sensing to channel opening. In addition to transducing voltage sensor movement, specific residues in the S4-S5 linker stabilize the activation gate in the closed conformation. These findings, together with the recently solved crystal structure of Kv1.2, define the S4-S5 linker as the structural link that couples voltage sensing to channel opening.

Treatment of neonatal and adult mice with intraperitoneal leptin (5 mg/kg) induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 phosphorylation in pyriform and entorhinal cortex neurons. Stimulation of cultured embryonic cortical neurons with leptin evoked Janus kinase 2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation and activated the downstream effector 90-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase. Moreover, leptin elicited the phosphorylation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase effector Akt and evoked Ser-9 phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β), an event inactivating this kinase. Leptin-mediated GSK3β phosphorylation was prevented by the MEK/ERK inhibitor PD98059, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, or the protein kinase C inhibitor GF109203X. Exposure of cortical neurons to leptin also induced Ser-41 phosphorylation of the neuronal growth-associated protein GAP-43, an effect prevented by LY294002 and GF109203X but not by PD98059. Ser-41-GAP-43 phosphorylation is usually high in expanding axonal growth cones. Neurons exposed to 100 ng/ml leptin for 72 h displayed reduced rate of growth cone collapse, a shift of growth cone size distribution toward higher values, and a 4-fold increase in mean growth cone surface area compared with control cultures. The leptin-induced growth cone spreading was hampered in cortical neurons from Leprdb/db mice lacking functional leptin receptors; it was associated with localized Ser-9-GSK3β phosphorylation and mimicked by the GSK3β inhibitor SB216763. At concentrations preventing GSK3β phosphorylation, PD98059, LY294002, or GF109203X reversed the leptin-induced growth cone surface enlargement. We concluded that the leptin-mediated regulation of growth cone morphogenesis in cortical neurons relies on upstream regulators of GSK3β activity.

We concluded that the leptin-mediated regulation of growth cone morphogenesis in cortical neurons relies on upstream regulators of GSK3β activity. The adipocyte-derived hormone leptin acts as satiety signal in hypothalamic nuclei to regulate energy homeostasis (1Friedman J.M. Halaas J.L. Nature. 1998; 395: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (4483) Google Scholar, 2Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 2001; 104: 531-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar). Mice lacking leptin (Lepob/ob mice) display obesity and several associated abnormalities (1Friedman J.M. Halaas J.L. Nature. 1998; 395: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (4483) Google Scholar). Excluding very rare cases of humans with genetic obesity, obese human subjects have high circulating leptin levels and hypothalamic insensitivity to leptin (1Friedman J.M. Halaas J.L. Nature. 1998; 395: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (4483) Google Scholar).Five leptin receptors (LEPRs) 2The abbreviations used are: LEPR, leptin receptor; JAK2, Janus kinase 2; STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription-3; SOCS3, suppressor of cytokine signaling-3; RSK, ribosomal protein S6 kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; E15, embryonic day 15; DIV, days in vitro; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GAP-43, growth-associated protein-43; LTP, long term potentiation; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; P, postnatal day; E, embryonic day. 2The abbreviations used are: LEPR, leptin receptor; JAK2, Janus kinase 2; STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription-3; SOCS3, suppressor of cytokine signaling-3; RSK, ribosomal protein S6 kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; E15, embryonic day 15; DIV, days in vitro; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GAP-43, growth-associated protein-43; LTP, long term potentiation; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; P, postnatal day; E, embryonic day. in the mouse have been identified, including long (LEPRb) and short isoforms (LEPRa and LEPRc-e). LEPRb, which is ineffective in Leprdb/db mice, phosphorylates Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), which in turn phosphorylates LEPRb tyrosine residues to mediate downstream signaling (3Sweeney G. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 655-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 4Bates S.H. Myers Jr., M.G. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 14: 447-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Recruitment of the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) is broadly considered a molecular signature of hypothalamic leptin signaling and drives subsequent induction of genes, including that of the feedback inhibitor, suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3). LEPRb stimulation can also activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway (3Sweeney G. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 655-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 4Bates S.H. Myers Jr., M.G. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 14: 447-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar).The existence of LEPRs in extrahypothalamic brain areas, including neocortex, entorhinal, and pyriform cortex and hippocampus (5Huang X.F. Koutcherov I. Lin S. Wang H.Q. Storlien L. Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 2635-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 6Burguera B. Couce M.E. Long J. Lamsam J. Laakso K. Jensen M.D. Parisi J.E. Lloyd R.V. Neuroendocrinology. 2000; 71: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), suggests that leptin, besides controlling food intake, might affect cognitive abilities. The hormone actually facilitates memory mechanisms in mice (7Shanley L.J. Irving A.J. Harvey J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The finding of circulating leptin levels in fetal life (8Henson M.C. Castracane V.D. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 63: 1219-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and the 5-10-fold increase of serum leptin levels observed in neonatal mice when compared with the <10 ng/ml found in adult mice (9Ahima R.S. Prabakaran D. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1020-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) first suggested that leptin might intervene as a modulatory factor during development. LEPRs are also expressed in diverse areas of the developing brain (10Hoggard N. Hunter L. Duncan J.S. Williams L.M. Trayhurn P. Mercer J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11073-11078Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 11Matsuda J. Yokota I. Tsuruo Y. Murakami T. Ishimura K. Shima K. Kuroda Y.

Lepob/ob mice show decreased levels of synaptic proteins, which are partially restored by postnatal leptin treatment, indicating that leptin deficiency might interfere with neuronal maturation (13Ahima R.S. Bjorbaek C. Osei S. Flier J.S. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2755-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Recent papers show that leptin modulates axonal growth and synaptic plasticity within the hypothalamus (14Bouret S.G. Draper S.J. Simerly R.B. Science. 2004; 304: 108-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar, 15Pinto S. Roseberry A.G. Liu H. Diano S. Shanabrough M. Cai X. Friedman J.M. Horvath T.L. Science. 2004; 304: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). In particular, leptin increases neurite extension in the arcuate nucleus during mouse perinatal development, thus playing an early trophic role within those circuits that will be the target of leptin physiological actions in adult life (14Bouret S.G. Draper S.J. Simerly R.B. Science. 2004; 304: 108-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). However, these studies did not clarify whether the trophic effects of leptin are directly exerted on arcuate nucleus neurons, nor did the studies investigate the intracellular signals activated by leptin in the developmental and plastic changes described so far. Additional questions consider the possible trophic actions of leptin on extrahypothalamic circuits.We investigated the role of leptin in the development of mouse cerebral cortex neurons, and we discovered that the hormone acts as a trophic factor in the elaboration of cortical growth cones by modulating MEK/ERK, PI3K/Akt, and PKC signaling pathways that converge in the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β).MATERIALS AND METHODSIn Vivo Leptin Administration and Immunohistochemistry—Leprdb/db male mice or wild type C57BL/Ks congeners (Harlan, S. Pietro al Natisone, Italy) were treated with a single intraperitoneal injection of recombinant mouse leptin (National Hormone and Peptide Program, Torrance, CA) or vehicle at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight at postnatal days (P) 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 or at adult age (3 months). Forty five min later, mice were anesthetized with 100 mg/kg ketamine (Ketavet; Farmacia Gellini, Aprilia, Italy) and 10 mg/kg xylazine (Rompum; Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany) and transcardially perfused with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (PB), pH 7.4. Brains were quickly removed, post-fixed in the same fixative for 36 h, then cut in 40-μm coronal sections on a vibratome, collected as a series, and kept in PB until further use. The first section of each series was Nissl-stained to recognize structures according to Ref. 16Paxinos G. Franklin K.B.J. The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. Academic Press, San Diego2001Google Scholar. Free floating sections were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, which was used for all subsequent washes), quenched in 1% H2O2 for 30 min at room temperature, washed, and blocked in 3% normal horse serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing diphosphorylated ERK1/2 (1:1000 dilution, Sigma), washed, and then incubated in 1:200 biotinylated IgG anti-mouse horse serum (Vector Laboratories) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. After washing and incubation in avidin-biotin-peroxidase reagent (Vector Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature, signals were revealed with diamino-benzidine (Sigma). Finally, sections were mounted on gelatin-coated slices, air-dried, cleared with xylene, and coverslipped with Entellan®. Phospho-STAT3 immunohistochemistry was performed as described (17Munzberg H. Huo L. Nillni E.A. Hollenberg A.N. Bjorbaek C. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 2121-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) using the anti-phospho-STAT3 (Tyr-705) rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) at a dilution of 1:1000. Negative controls were obtained by using preimmune instead of primary antisera. Brightness and contrast of the final images (TIFF files) were adjusted using the Photoshop 6 software (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA).Neuronal Cultures and Treatments—Primary cortical neurons were prepared as described by Brewer et al. (18Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Embryonic day 15 (E15) cortices were isolated from CD1 mouse brains (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Calco, Italy), pooled, mechanically dissociated into a single-cell suspension in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) containing 2% B27 supplement (Invitrogen), 500 μm glutamine (Euroclone, Pero, Italy), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Euroclone) (N-B27 medium), and centrifuged for 5 min at 200 × g. Cells were plated onto poly-d-lysine (Sigma)-coated glass coverslips or dishes (2.5-7.5 × 104 cells/cm2) and cultured in N-B27 medium for diverse days in vitro (DIV). Cultures contained >99% neurons, as assessed by MAP2 immunostaining (data not shown). Cells were treated with murine recombinant leptin (National Hormone and Peptide Program), PD98059 (Calbiochem), GF109203X (Calbiochem), LY294002 (Cell Signaling Technology), or SB216763 (Tocris, Avonmouth, UK), for times and concentrations indicated in the text or figure legends. Phosphorylation of signaling molecules was assayed on cells maintained in B27-free culture medium 5 h before exposure to test molecules; signaling experiments at DIV 4 (not shown) and DIV 8 gave superimposable results.Neuronal Cultures from Leprdb/db Mice and Genotyping for the Leprdb Mutation—Pregnant female mice heterozygous for the Leprdb mutation (Leprdb/+), mated to Leprdb/+ male breeder mice, were purchased from Harlan (Oxon, UK). Cortices were isolated at E15 from several embryos of two litters and individually dissociated. Cortical neurons from each embryo were plated separately and fed as described above with N-B27 medium. We applied a PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism method for identifying the embryonal Leprdb genotype as described (19Yamashita H. Shao J. Ishizuka T. Klepcyk P.J. Muhlenkamp P. Qiao L. Hoggard N. Friedman J.E. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2888-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, cerebellar tissue from each embryo was digested in the presence of proteinase K (Sigma) overnight at 55 °C with agitation. DNA extracted by standard procedures served as a template in a PCR using primers and cycling conditions described previously (19Yamashita H. Shao J. Ishizuka T. Klepcyk P.J. Muhlenkamp P. Qiao L. Hoggard N. Friedman J.E. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2888-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The PCR products were digested in the presence of AccI restriction enzyme (Promega, Madison, WI) at 37 °C for 4 h. Digests were analyzed in 3.5% agarose gel (Sigma) containing ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml). Digestion with AccI yielded 85- and 24-bp fragments in Lepr+/+ mice, 58-, 27-, and 24-bp fragments in Leprdb/db mice, and 85-, 58-, 27-, and 24-bp fragments in the heterozygote Leprdb/+ mice. We failed to observe any gross difference between neuronal cultures obtained from Lepr+/+ and Leprdb/db mice in terms of cell number or in vitro differentiation properties in NB-27 medium (data not shown).Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA (1.5 μg) was extracted with an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and reverse-transcribed in the presence of oligo(dT) (18Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar) (Ambion, Austin, TX) and 200 units of Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) for 50 min at 42 °C. Transcripts were amplified with Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) in 50 μl of standard buffer containing 50 pmol of LEPRb primers or 12.5 pmol of primers for the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). For LEPRb PCR, 32 cycles were run at 94, 58, and 72 °C, 45 s each, with primers described by Hoggard et al. (10Hoggard N. Hunter L. Duncan J.S. Williams L.M. Trayhurn P. Mercer J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11073-11078Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) (amplified fragment, 534 bp); for GAPDH, 26 cycles were run as above with primers described by Wurmbach et al. (20Wurmbach E. Yuen T. Ebersole B.J. Sealfon S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47195-47201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) (amplified fragment, 199 bp). Primers were from MWG Biotec AG, Ebersberg, Germany. PCR fragments were separated by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Quantitation was performed by densitometric scanning using a computerized image system (Gel-Pro Analyzer, Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Omission of the reverse transcriptase step to provide negative PCR controls gave no amplified bands (data not shown).Western Immunoblots—Protein extracts were obtained from neuronal cultures, quantified, and processed for Western blot analysis as described by Valerio et al.

Denatured protein samples (25-50 μg each) were electrophoresed onto 4-12% NuPAGE BisTris Pre-Cast Gels (Invitrogen) and electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Filters were blocked1hin5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies (described below). After washing, membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences), and then immunodetection was performed by the enhanced chemiluminescence procedure (ECL plus kit; Amersham Biosciences). Primary antibodies were as follows: anti-leptin receptor, long form, rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:100 dilution; Linco Research, St. Charles, MO); anti-JAK2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology); anti-phospho-JAK2 (Tyr-1007/Tyr-1008) rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:1000; BIOSOURCE); anti-STAT1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); anti-phospho-STAT1 (Tyr-701) rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:1000; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY); anti-STAT3, anti-phospho-STAT3 (either Tyr-705 or Ser-727), anti-ERK44/42, anti-phospho-ERK44/42 (Thr-202/Tyr-204), anti-RSK, anti-phospho-p90RSK (Thr-359/Ser-363), anti-Akt, anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473), anti-GSK3β, anti-phospho-GSK3β (Ser-9) (all rabbit polyclonal antibodies, used at 1:1000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology); rabbit polyclonal anti-SOCS3 antibody (1:250; Abcam, Cambridge, UK); mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody (1:20,000; Sigma); anti-GAP-43 antibody (clone 7D4/1, 1:3000) and anti-phospho-GAP-43 antibody (Ser-41, clone 2G12/C7, 1:3000) were the gifts of K. F. Meiri, Boston (22Meiri K.F. Bickerstaff L.E. Schwob J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 991-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). After the visualization of phosphoproteins, filters were stripped with the Re-Blot Western blot recycling kit (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) and further used for the visualization of total proteins (phosphorylated and not phosphorylated). Quantification of at least three immunoblots with protein extracts from separate cell preparations was performed by densitometric scanning of exposed film using Gel-Pro Analyzer software.Immunofluorescence and Image Analysis—Neurons grown on coverslips were fixed for 20 min at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose in 0.1 m PB, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. The following primary antibodies were applied1hat room temperature: mouse monoclonal anti-GAP-43 (1:100; Chemicon International); mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (1:1000; Sigma); rabbit monoclonal anti-GSK3β (1:50; Cell Signaling Technology); goat polyclonal anti-phospho-GSK3β (Ser-9, 1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cells were then incubated in Cy3-, TRITC-, and/or Cy2-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) at room temperature for 1 h. When applied, staining with Oregon Green 488 phalloidin (1:15; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was performed for 1 h at the end of immunofluorescence procedure. Coverslips were mounted in FluorSave (Calbiochem). Fluorescence was acquired using an Olympus IX51 microscope equipped with a digital camera (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany). Leptin-mediated morphological changes were quantified on axonal growth cones, defined as GAP-43-positive fan-shaped structures at the neuritic tip, with a width at least three times greater than their neurite of origin. Growth cone collapse was scored in club-shaped growth cones displaying complete loss of lamellipodia and filopodia. In each coverslip 50 cortical neurons were analyzed at ×100 magnification. At least three separate experiments conducted in triplicate were performed. Growth cone area and phospho-GSK3β/GSK3β immunostaining intensity ratio were calculated using the Image ProPlus software (Media Cybernetics).Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were performed by one-way analysis of variance followed by t test as post-hoc analysis. Data are presented as means ± S.E.RESULTSIn Vivo Studies of Leptin Signaling—We acutely treated mice with leptin at various postnatal ages and evaluated the levels of phosphorylated STAT3 in diverse brain areas. Because we did not found any appreciable difference in leptin-driven signals at the examined ages, only the data at P20 will be showed. In untreated mice, grouped cells showed a weak nuclear phospho-STAT3 immunoreactivity in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (Fig. 1A). As expected, intraperitoneal leptin injection (5 mg/kg) increased phospho-STAT3 immunoreactivity in the hypothalamus of neonatal and adult mice. In particular, the arcuate, ventromedial, and dorsomedial nuclei contained numerous strongly stained cells (Fig. 1C). The increase in phospho-STAT3 immunostaining was not appreciable in Leprdb/db mice (data not shown). In contrast to mouse hypothalamus, intraperitoneal leptin injection did not affect STAT3 phosphorylation in mouse cerebral cortex at any serial level. As an example, the absence of phospho-STAT3 immunoreactivity is showed in pyriform cortex of untreated (Fig. 1B) and leptin-treated mice (Fig. 1D).The activation of ERK1/2 in the pyriform cortex was evaluated in untreated mice at various postnatal ages. In basal conditions, phospho-ERK1/2 immunostaining was better appreciated in the nuclei of the layer II pyramidal cells at P10, when the peak of endogenous leptin occurs (9Ahima R.S. Prabakaran D. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1020-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 1). The basal phospho-ERK1/2 signal lowered during postnatal development and was faintly detectable from P25 thereafter, consistently with the low serum leptin levels (9Ahima R.S. Prabakaran D. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1020-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 1). At P20, pale phospho-ERK1/2 immunostaining was detectable in the mouse pyriform cortex of untreated mice (Fig. 2A), mostly in the nuclei of the layer II pyramidal cells (Fig. 2B). After leptin administration, the pyriform cortex showed an increase in the number of phospho-ERK1/2-positive cells (Fig. 2C). Layer II pyramidal cell nuclei were more intensely stained and their somata and projections strongly labeled (Fig. 2D). The entorhinal cortex, usually found negative in the controls, showed signs of phospho-ERK1/2 activation after leptin treatment (data not shown). Leptin administration in Leprdb/db mice did not induce phospho-Erk1/2 staining either in the pyriform (Fig. 2, E and F) or in the entorhinal cortex (data not shown). Moreover, intraperitoneal leptin injection failed to activate ERK1/2 in the neocortex at any examined developmental age (data not shown).FIGURE 2Phospho-ERK1/2 immunohistochemistry in sections of pyriform cortex (Pyr) of mice at P20. In untreated wild type (wt) animals (A and B), the layer II pyramidal cells of the pyriform cortex show weak immunostaining. Leptin treatment produced an evident increase of phospho-ERK1/2 immunoreactivity in wild type animals (C and D) but not in Leprdb/db mice (E and F).

LEPRb mRNA was clearly detectable at DIV 1 and increased during in vitro neuronal maturation from DIV 1 up to DIV 12 (Fig. 3A). LEPRb protein was found at DIV 1 and gradually increased during in vitro differentiation of cortical neurons, peaking around DIV 8 (Fig. 3B). Neuronal cultures were acutely stimulated with leptin to verify the possible activation of JAK2. A time-dependent increase in JAK2 phosphorylation was rapidly observed. Phospho-JAK2 levels were significantly induced at 2 min and peaked 5 min after the addition of 100 ng/ml leptin to cortical neurons (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3Mouse cortical neurons express functionally active leptin receptors.

Up to a 500 ng/ml concentration of leptin did not induce STAT3 phosphorylation either at Tyr-705 or Ser-727 (Fig. 4A). Although the role of other STAT proteins in physiological leptin signaling is not recognized, the hormone activates STAT1 in adipose tissue (3Sweeney G. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 655-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Despite this, leptin at different concentrations and incubation times failed to phosphorylate STAT1 in cortical neurons (Fig. 4A). Accordingly, leptin (100 ng/ml) treatment of cortical neurons up to 24 h was unable to induce the expression of the SOCS3 protein (Fig. 4B), which is induced by leptin in a STAT3-dependent manner in the hypothalamus (4Bates S.H. Myers Jr., M.G. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 14: 447-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar).FIGURE 4Leptin does not affect STAT signaling in mouse cortical neurons. A, immunoblots of lysates from control- or leptin-treated DIV 8 neurons showing the levels of phosphorylated and total STAT proteins.

Moreover, mass spectrometric analysis of these extracts showed dramatic changes in N-glycans compatible with lack of β1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I activity. Interestingly, Mgat11/Mgat11 null mutants are viable but exhibit pronounced defects in adult locomotory activity when compared with Mgat11/CyO-GFP heterozygotes or wild type flies. In addition, in null mutants males are sterile and have a severely reduced mean and maximum life span. Microscopic examination of mutant adult fly brains showed the presence of fused β lobes. The removal of both maternal and zygotic Mgat1 also gave rise to embryos that no longer express the horseradish peroxidase antigen within the central nervous system.

According to recent genome project estimates, the human and fruit fly genomes contain about 24,000 and 14,000 genes, respectively. However, the number of functionally discrete proteins encoded by either of these genomes is probably increased by at least 1 order of magnitude because of post-translational modifications (PTM) 3The abbreviations used are: PTM, post-translational modification; CDG, congenital disorder of glycosylation; FucT, fucosyltransferase; GlcNAcT, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; MALDI-TOF-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry; MS, mass spectrometry; PNGase, protein N-glycanase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Gnase, β-N-acetylglucosaminidase. and processes such as gene splicing. PTM has been implicated in many important processes, e.g. signal transduction cascades, growth, transformation, and memory formation (1Parekh R.B. Rohlff C. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 718-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 2Routtenberg A. Rekart J.L. Trends Neurosci. 2005; 28: 12-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Glycosylation is one of the most common PTM. Protein-bound glycans are often branched and are composed of several different monomeric sugar components connected by one of six to eight different linkages. This type of structure confers on glycans the ability to carry a great deal of information in very compact structures and thereby to mediate many different functions (3Laine R.A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Our laboratory is interested in the synthesis and function of glycans conjugated to proteins by β-linkage of GlcNAc to the amido group of Asn (N-glycans). The first phase of N-glycan synthesis involves the assembly of a lipid-linked precursor Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-pyrophosphate-dolichol and the oligosaccharyltransferase-catalyzed transfer of the Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-moiety to an Asn residue within an Asn-X-(Ser/Thr) sequon (4Burda P. Aebi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). The second phase involves the processing, within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, of Asn-linked Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 to Man5GlcNAc2 (5Herscovics A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 96-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 6Moremen K.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) (Figs. 1 and 2A). The final phase of the pathway (7Schachter H. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) occurs in the Golgi apparatus and involves the conversion of Man5GlcNAc2-Asn to hybrid, paucimannose, and complex N-glycans (Fig. 2A). UDP-GlcNAc:α3-d-mannoside β1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GlcNAcTI, encoded by Mgat1) converts Man5GlcNAc2-Asn to the hybrid N-glycan GlcNAcMan5GlcNAc2-Asn. This is followed by the action of α3,6-mannosidase II to form the hybrid N-glycans GlcNAcMan4GlcNAc2-Asn and GlcNAcMan3GlcNAc2-Asn (Fig. 2A). In vertebrates, GlcNAcMan3GlcNAc2-Asn is converted to complex N-glycans by the action of UDP-GlcNAc:α6-d-mannoside β1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II (GlcNAcTII) and other branching GlcNAcTs (7Schachter H. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Further action by other glycosyltransferases (galactosyl-, sialyl-, and fucosyltransferases) on the distal nonreducing ends of the glycan creates a large variety of complex N-glycans.FIGURE 2A, N-glycan synthesis in wild type Drosophila. This scheme is based on the data in Table 1 and on Paschinger et al. (44Paschinger K. Staudacher E. Stemmer U. Fabini G. Wilson I.B. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The names of the N-glycans are defined in Fig. 1. Enzyme names are in italics. Reactions shown by continuous arrows have been established by in vitro assays, and broken arrows are based on other evidence (44Paschinger K. Staudacher E. Stemmer U. Fabini G. Wilson I.B. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Arrows crossed with double lines indicate reactions that do not occur. The figure shows the conversion of oligomannose N-glycans (M9-5Gn2) to hybrid (GnM5-3Gn2), paucimannose (M4-3Gn2), andcomplex (Gn2M3Gn2) N-glycans. The major structure in wild type flies is M3Gn2F6 (box with a thick continuous line) (14Fabini G. Freilinger A. Altmann F. Wilson I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28058-28067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 44Paschinger K. Staudacher E. Stemmer U. Fabini G. Wilson I.B. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar); other structures present in large amounts (32-68% of M3Gn2F6) are boxed with thin continuous lines. The remaining boxed structures (discontinuous lines) are present in amounts less than 10% of M3Gn2F6. Unboxed structures have not been detected by MS but are included in the figure on the basis of other evidence (44Paschinger K. Staudacher E. Stemmer U. Fabini G. Wilson I.B. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). GlcNAcTI adds GlcNAc in β1-2 linkage to the Manα1-3 arm of M5Gn2 to form the hybrid N-glycan GnM5Gn2 (36Sarkar M. Schachter H. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 69Schachter H. Glycoconj. J. 2000; 17: 465-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Two Man residues are removed from GnM5Gn2 by the action of α3,6-mannosidase II (MaseII) to form the truncated hybrid N-glycans GnM4Gn2 and GnM3Gn2 (6Moremen K.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A specific β-N-acetylglucosaminidase not found in vertebrates (Gnase (9Altmann F. Schwihla H. Staudacher E. Glossl J. Marz L. J.

GlcNAcTII (70Tsitilou S.G. Grammenoudi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 312: 1372-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) acts on GnM3Gn2 to initiate the synthesis of complex N-glycans; this is a minor pathway in plants, insects, and C. elegans because Gnase competes more effectively for substrate than GlcNAcTII. The substrates, products, and reactions of the core α1,6-FucT (6FucT) and α1,3-FucT (3FucT) are shown (44Paschinger K. Staudacher E. Stemmer U. Fabini G. Wilson I.B.

FucT6 cannot act on structures with a core α1-3-linked Fuc and must therefore act before FucTA to make the small amounts of M3Gn2F3F6 in wild type Drosophila (14Fabini G. Freilinger A. Altmann F.

GlcNAcTI-null flies make small amounts of fucosylated M3Gn2 (M3Gn2FX) (Table 1) indicating a GlcNAcTI-independent path to this structure; neither of the previously reported core FucTs are responsible because both enzymes require prior GlcNAcTI action (44Paschinger K. Staudacher E. Stemmer U. Fabini G. Wilson I.B. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The site and linkage of the Fuc on M3Gn2FX are unknown. GlcNAcTI-null flies make relatively large amounts of M3Gn2 and M4Gn2 (Table 1) suggesting that a GlcNAcTI-independent α-mannosidase (Mase) acts on M5Gn2 upstream of GlcNAcTI; such a mannosidase has been reported in Spodoptera frugiperda (71Kawar Z.

B, N-glycan synthesis in Mgat1-null flies. The figure is based on MS analysis of the N-glycan structures in GlcNAcTI-null flies (Table 1) and was obtained by removing all arrows dependent on the action of GlcNAcTI from the wild type fly scheme (see A). The definitions of names and arrows are as for A. The amounts of M5-M9Gn2 (boxes with continuous lines) are increased by 50-250% in the null flies. M3Gn2F6, M3Gn2, and M4Gn2 (boxes with bold discontinuous lines) are reduced by 100, 59, and 19%, respectively. A small amount of M3Gn2F was observed in GlcNAcTI-null flies (Table 1); this M3Gn2F is neither M3Gn2F3 nor M3Gn2F6 (the respective FucTs require prior GlcNAcTI action) and has been designated as M3Gn2FX (not boxed). Structures boxed with thin discontinuous lines are present in low amounts in wild type flies but are absent in the mutant flies. The arrows attached to M4Gn2FX indicate that the structure may be an intermediate in the pathway to M3Gn2FX. C, N-glycan synthesis in fdl-null flies. The figure is based on MS analysis of the N-glycan structures in the fdl and Df(2R)achi2 fly strains; fdl flies have a hypomorphic mutation in the fdl gene, and Df(2R)achi2 flies have a null mutation in fdl but also have mutations in five other genes (49Léonard R.

The fdl gene was recently cloned and shown to encode the β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (Gnase) that removes GlcNAc incorporated by GlcNAcTI (49Léonard R. Rendic D. Rabouille C. Wilson I.B.H. Préat T.

The insect β-N-acetylglucosaminidase cannot hydrolyze GlcNAcMan5GlcNAc2 and acts further downstream on GlcNAcMan3-4GlcNAc2Fuc0-1 after the action of α3,6-mannosidase II (Fig. 2A) (9Altmann F.

The first committed step toward synthesis of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-pyrophosphate-dolichol is catalyzed by UDP-GlcNAc:dolichylphosphate GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase. This step is essential for the synthesis of all N-glycans. Tunicamycin, a GlcNAc analogue that is a competitive inhibitor of GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase, is toxic to yeast (24Pittet M. Uldry D. Aebi M. Conzelmann A. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and to mammalian cells in culture (25Finnie J.W. J. Comp.

GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase-null mouse embryos complete preimplantation development but die 4-5 days after fertilization; neither trophoblast nor embryonic endodermal lineages derived from these early embryos survive in culture in vitro indicating that N-glycosylation is needed for the viability of early embryonic cells (28Marek K.W. Vijay I.K. Marth J.D. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1263-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In contrast, Chinese hamster ovary cells suffer no obvious phenotypic abnormalities in the absence of GlcNAcTI (29Chen W. Stanley P. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Mgat1 null mice, however, die at embryonic stage E9.5 days (30Metzler M. Gertz A. Sarkar M. Schachter H. Schrader J.W.

The data indicate that the oligomannose N-glycans made in the first two phases of N-glycan synthesis are essential to the survival of both unicellular and multicellular animals, whereas GlcNAcTI-dependent N-glycans are needed for normal vertebrate development but not for the survival of individual cells. Here we present evidence that GlcNAcTI-dependent N-glycans are also needed for the normal development of D. melanogaster. Vertebrate glycan function has been studied by analysis of mice and humans with mutations in genes required for glycosylation (32Lowe J.B. Marth J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 643-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 33Stanley P. Fukuda M. Hindsgaul O. Molecular and Cellular Glycobiology. Vol. 30.

Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK2005: 157-198Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Such studies are complicated by the fact that synthesis of glycans requires a complex multienzyme system acting on a large number of protein targets. In the expectation that the relatively primitive N-glycan synthesis pathway in Drosophila and C. elegans may be more amenable to functional analysis than the vertebrate pathway, we have initiated studies on Mgat1 null mutations in these invertebrates. We have shown that C. elegans Mgat1-deficient mutants are viable and have an apparently normal phenotype when grown under standard laboratory conditions but show decreased survival times when exposed to pathogenic bacteria (35Schachter H. Shi H. Spence A.M. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 1191Google Scholar). We have reported the cloning and expression of the Drosophila Mgat1 gene (36Sarkar M. Schachter H. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Here we show that null mutations in Drosophila Mgat1 give rise to viable adults with dramatically altered N-glycans that result in pronounced defects in locomotion, a severely reduced life span, and abnormal brain development. Fly Stocks and Generation of Mutants—All fly stocks were maintained at room temperature on standard cornmeal agar media. The liney1 w67c23; Mgat1KG02444 (stock BL-13222; Bloomington Stock Center) contains a P-element insertion at the 5′ end of Mgat1 and was used to generate both the precise excision line Mgat1+9 and the imprecise excision allele Mgat11. Because Mgat1+9 was generated at the same time as the Mgat11 allele and is in the same genetic background, this line was used as a control for all of our subsequent analyses (GlcNAcT1 assays, mass spectrometry, immunohistochemistry, locomotion, and life span) and behaved as wild type. yw; Sp/CyO; SbΔ2-3/TM6, Ubx was used as a source of transposase. The excision breakpoints were determined by PCR analysis and sequencing using the primers F1 5′-CCGATTGGGGTAGGTAAAT and R3 5′-CTGAGAGTGGCACACTTTC. The P-element line l(2)0551005510 cn1/CyO; ry506 contains a lethal mutation in the gene immediately upstream of Mgat1 (stock BL-12192). GlcNAcTI Enzyme Assay—Fourteen adult flies from each group were homogenized in 0.2 ml of 25 mm MES buffer, pH 6.5, containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor mixture. GlcNAcTI activity was measured using 0.6 mm Manα1-6[Manα1-3]Manβ1-O-n-octyl (Toronto Research Chemicals, Toronto, Canada) as acceptor substrate and 1.2 mm UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (100,000 dpm/nmol) as donor substrate. The assay mixture also contained 3.0 mm AMP, 60 mm GlcNAc, 20 mm MnCl2, in 0.05 m MES buffer, pH 6.5, and 0.01 or 0.02 ml of enzyme in a total volume of 0.04 ml. Time of incubation was 60 min at 37 °C. The assays were carried out as described previously (36Sarkar M. Schachter H. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The rate of product formation was proportional to enzyme volume. Mass Spectrometric Analysis of N-Glycans of Wild Type and Mutant Drosophila—Adult flies (∼0.5 g of Mgat1+9/Mgat1+9, Mgat11/CyO-GFP, Mgat11/Mgat11) were anesthetized with carbon dioxide, suspended in 0.3 ml of water, and boiled for 10 min. The preparation of N-glycans was performed as described previously (11Altmann F. Fabini G. Ahorn H. Wilson I.B. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 37Zhu S. Hanneman A. Reinhold V.N. Spence A.M. Schachter H. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Proteins were extracted in lysis buffer (35 mm Tris, 8 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 65 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.0), and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The protein content of the supernatant was determined using the Bradford assay (38Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217546) Google Scholar). Protein in the supernatant was precipitated with 15% trichloroacetic acid on ice for 1 h. The protein pellet was washed with 1 ml of acetone (three times) and 1 ml of chloroform/methanol/water (10:10:1) (three times), dried under nitrogen, and stored at -20 °C. The protein pellet was lyophilized prior to treatment with protein N-glycanase F (PNGase F). The released glycans were purified and subjected to matrixassisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). The glycans were reduced with NaBH4 (0.2 ml of 10 mg/ml NaBH4 in 10 mm NaOH) overnight at room temperature. Borate was removed by adding 2 drops of acetic acid on ice, followed by co-evaporation with 3 ml of ethanol, 3 ml of 1% acetic acid in methanol (five times), and 1 ml of toluene (three times). The reduced glycans were desalted, permethylated (39Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3215) Google Scholar), and analyzed by MALDI-IT-TOF (where IT indicates ion trap) MS for confirmation. Collision-induced dissociation was performed using MALDI-QIT MS (where QIT indicates quadrupole ion trap) (Kratos-Shimadzu Biotech) with 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as matrix (40Ashline D. Singh S. Hanneman A. Reinhold V. Anal. Chem. 2005; 77: 6250-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). All the structures reported here were confirmed by derivatization and MALDI-IT-MS. Locomotory Activity—The locomotory activity of adult male and female flies was measured using a slightly modified open field test (41Iliadi K.G. Iliadi N.N. Rashkovetsky E.L. Girin S.V. Nevo E. Korol A.B. Behav. Genet. 2002; 32: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, individual flies from each genotype were placed in a covered Petri dish (15 mm) and allowed to adapt to their environment for 5 min. The length of time adult flies were moving over a period of 3 min was then measured. Twenty five flies of each genotype were used for each experiment. Life Span Determination—The life span of Mgat11/Mgat11 adults was compared with Mgat11/CyO-GFP and Mgat1+9/Mgat1+9 flies. Briefly, an overnight egg collection was obtained from Mgat11/CyO-GFP flies and aged for 24-36 h. Upon hatching into first instar larvae, Mgat11/Mgat11 homozygotes were sorted from Mgat11/CyO-GFP heterozygotes by the absence (Mgat11/Mgat11) or presence (Mgat11/CyO, GFP) of a GFP marker. The sorted larvae were then transferred to vials containing standard medium and allowed to develop. Adult flies were removed as soon as they eclosed and were placed into fresh vials (10 flies/vial). The starting population size for each genotype was 100. The males and females were kept in separate vials. Dead flies were scored, and vials were changed every 3 days. For statistical analysis, the mean and maximum life span of each strain was calculated from the time in days when survival reached 50 and 10%, respectively, of the starting population in each of the 10 cohorts of each strain. Immunocytochemistry—Embryos from homozygous and heterozygous Mgat11 flies were collected overnight on grape plates, fixed using standard conditions, and double-labeled with antibodies to Elav (a neuron-specific antigen) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or GFP and HRP as described (42Leventis P.A. Chow B.M. Stewart B.A. Iyengar B. Campos A.R. Boulianne G.L. Traffic. 2001; 2: 839-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used were rat anti-Elav, 1:10 (clone 7E8A10; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa), rabbit anti-GFP, 1:500 (Molecular Probes), and anti-HRP fluorescein isothiocyanate, 1:500 (ICN Biomedicals). The secondary antibodies used were donkey anti-rat Cy3, 1:500 (Molecular Probes), and donkey anti-rabbit Cy3, 1:500 (Molecular Probes). Whole mount brains from immobilized adults 1-2 days post-eclosion were dissected in cold PBS, pH 7.2, fixed for 15 min at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and washed in PBT (PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100). The brains were then blocked for 30 min at room temperature in 5% normal donkey serum (Chemicon) in PBT. Primary and secondary antibody labeling was performed overnight at 4 °C in blocking solution. Antibodies used were mouse anti-fasciclin II (FasII), 1:5 (clone 1D4; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), and donkey anti-mouse Cy3, 1:500 (Molecular Probes). Washes between steps were performed with PBT at room temperature. Embryos and brains were mounted in antifade (2% Dabco™ (Sigma), 70% glycerol in 0.12 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6). Epifluorescent images were acquired with a Leica DMRA-2 microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu Orca-ER digital camera.

ING proteins contain a few conserved domains, including plant homeodomain motif, nuclear localization signal, and potential chromatin regulatory domain, suggesting that the ING family proteins may share common biological functions. ING3 has been shown to modulate p53-mediated transcription, cell cycle control, and apoptosis, possibly by modulating the NuA4 complex histone acetyltransferase activity. Because ING1b and ING2 have been shown to be involved in cellular stress responses such as nucleotide excision repair and apoptosis after UV irradiation, we investigated whether ING3 also mediated UV-induced apoptosis. We found that ING3 expression was rapidly induced by UV irradiation at both mRNA and protein levels. Using the stable clones of melanoma cells overexpressing ING3, we showed that overexpression of ING3 significantly promoted UV-induced apoptosis. Unlike its homologues ING1b and ING2, ING3-increased apoptosis was independent of functional p53. Furthermore, ING3 did not affect the expression of mitochondrial proteins but increased the cleavage of Bid and caspases-8, -9, and -3. Moreover, ING3-mediated apoptosis was blocked by inhibition of caspase-8 or Fas activation. In addition, ING3 up-regulated Fas expression at both mRNA and protein levels. Knock down of ING3 decreased UV-induced apoptosis remarkably.

Selleck W. Lane W.S. Tan S. Cote J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1884-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). However, unlike other ING genes (ING1, 2, 4, and 5), the ING3 gene locates far from the telomere terminus and is evolutionarily distinct from other family members (13Pedeux R. Sengupta S. Shen J.C. Demidov O.N. Saito S. Onogi H. Kumamoto K. Wincovitch S. Garfield S.H. McMenamin M. Nagashima M. Grossman S.R. Appella E. Harris C.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6639-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). ING3 does not physically associate with p53, which binds to and is required for the functions of ING1b, ING4, and ING5 (25Nagashima M. Shiseki M. Miura K. Hagiwara K. Linke S.P. Pedeux R. Wang X.W. Yokota J. Riabowol K. Harris C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9671-9676Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, the exact tumor-suppressive functions of ING3 protein remain to be clarified. ING1b and ING2 are both DNA damage-inducible genes. ING1b is induced by UV irradiation (26Scott M. Bonnefin P.

Cell Res. 2002; 279: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), whereas ING2 is induced by the DNA double strand break-inducing agents etoposide and neocarzinostatin (25Nagashima M. Shiseki M. Miura K. Hagiwara K. Linke S.P. Pedeux R. Wang X.W. Yokota J. Riabowol K. Harris C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9671-9676Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In response to UV irradiation, both ING1b and ING2 can promote UV-induced apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner (26Scott M. Bonnefin P. Vieyra D. Boisvert F.M. Young D. Bazett-Jones D.P. Riabowol K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3455-3462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Cheung K.J. Li G. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 279: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 28Chin M.Y. Ng K.C. Li G. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 304: 531-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). They also enhance the p53-mediated repair of UV-damaged DNA (29Cheung K.J. Mitchell D. Lin P. Li G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4974-4977PubMed Google Scholar, 30Wang J. Chin M.Y. Li G. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1906-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, the role of ING3 in cellular response to UV irradiation is not clear. In this study, we found that ING3 was rapidly induced by UV irradiation in melanoma cells. Overexpression of exogenous ING3 in melanoma cells can dramatically promote UV-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, unlike with its homologues ING1b and ING2, ING3-mediated apoptosis was independent of p53 function. We also demonstrated that ING3 induced Fas expression and promoted UV-induced apoptosis through the Fas/caspase-8 pathway. Cell Culture and UV Irradiation—The MMRU and MMAN cell lines were kind gifts from Dr. R. Byers, Boston University. The Sk-mel-5 cell line was obtained from the Tissue Bank at NCI, National Institutes of Health. The MEWO, Sk-mel-3, and Sk-mel-24 cell lines were kind gifts from Dr. A. P. Albino (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center). MMRU, MMAN, Sk-mel-5, and Sk-mel-24 cells harbor the wild-type p53 gene, but there is no detectable p53 protein in MMAN and the p53 protein in Sk-mel-5 is inactivated (31Luu Y. Li G.

Oncol. 1995; 37: 20-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and the status of p53 in Sk-mel-3 is unknown. All melanoma cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin, and 25 μg/ml of amphotericin B in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Normal human epithelial melanocytes were purchased from Clonetics (Walkersville, MD) and fed in melanocyte growth medium (Clonetics) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The wild-type p53 and p53-null HCT116 colorectal cancer cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and Dr. B. Vogelstein, respectively, and maintained in McCoy's 5A medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For UV irradiation, cells were rinsed with PBS and exposed to ultraviolet B (UVB) (290-320 nm) as previously described (29Cheung K.J. Mitchell D. Lin P. Li G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4974-4977PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids, Transfection, and ING3 Stable Clone Generation—The pcDNA3-ING3 and the dominant negative caspase-8 plasmids were kindly provided by Drs. O. Mamoru, and K. Arul, respectively. All the transfections were performed with Effectene reagent (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada). For the ING3 stable clone generation, MMRU cells were transfected with pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-ING3 and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h followed by a 14-day selection in the culture medium supplemented with 800 μg/ml of G418 (Sigma). Single clones were then picked up and maintained in the culture medium containing 100 μg/ml of G418. siRNA Transfection—At 50-60% confluency, cells were transfected with siRNA using SiLentFect reagent (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The Fas siRNA was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The sequences of p53 siRNA (Qiagen) were 5′-GCAUGAACCGGAGGCCCAUdTdT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AUGGGCCUCCGGUUCAUGCdTdT-3′ (antisense). The sequences of ING3 siRNA (Ambion, Austin, TX) were 5′-GCUGAUAAUGCUGGAAUUAUU-3′ (sense) and 5′-UAAUUCCAGCAUUAUCAGCUU-3′ (antisense). RT-PCR—Total RNA was prepared by TRIzol extraction (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed into cDNA with the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Hotstart PCR system was performed with Taq DNA polymerase reaction system (Qiagen). The sequences of human ING3 primers were 5′-CAGCCTCTTCTAACAATGCCTA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTTCATCAAACAAAAGGACCAC-3′ (antisense). The primers for human Fas were 5′-TCTAACTTGGGGTGGCTTTGTCTTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTGTCATACGCTTTCTTTCCAT-3′ (antisense). The primers for human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were 5′-CTCATGACCACAGTCCATG CCATC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTGATGTC-3′ (antisense). Western Blot—Cell pellets were lysed and extracted in 30 μl of triple detergent buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) containing freshly added protease inhibitors (100 μg/ml of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml of aprotinin, 1 μg/ml of leupeptin, 1 μg/ml of pepstatin A). The protein concentration was determined by a Bradford assay, and Western blot was performed as previously described (24Doyon Y. Selleck W. Lane W.S. Tan S. Cote J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1884-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The primary antisera included antibodies for p53, Bad, Fas, Fas-L, Noxa, actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Bax, Bcl-2, caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), Bid (BD Biosciences), ING3 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), and PARP (Oncogene, Cambridge, MA). The protein expression levels were quantitated with the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). FACS Analysis—Cells were collected by trypsinization and pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. Cell pellets were then resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic fluorochrome buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium citrate) containing 25 μg/ml of RNase A and 50 μg/ml of propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma). After being incubated at 4 °C in the dark for 1 h, samples were analyzed by EPICS XL-MCL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL) to determine the percentage of subdiploid DNA. Cells in sub-G1 phase were regarded as apoptotic cells. To quantify the cells in apoptosis from necrosis, cells were fixed and stained in Annexin-V-FLUOS staining kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells stained by both Annexin-V-FLUOS and PI were regarded as apoptotic. Hoechst Staining—Cells were rinsed with PBS, fixed in 2% formaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min, and stained with 2.5 μg/ml of Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) in PBS for 5 min. The cells were then washed with PBS, mounted on the slide with glycerol-PBS (1:1), and visualized under a fluorescent microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Cell Survival Assay—Cells in 24-well plates at 80% confluency were irradiated with UVB. Twenty-four hours after UV irradiation, cell survival was determined with the sulforhodamine B (Sigma) assay as described previously (36Li G. Tang L. Zhou X. Tron V. Ho V. Melanoma Res. 1998; 8: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, after the medium was removed, cells were fixed with 500 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid for 1 h at 4°C. The cells were then washed with tap water, air dried, and stained with 500 μl of 0.4% sulforhodamine B (dissolved in 1% acetic acid) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were destained with 1% acetic acid and air dried. For quantification, the cells were incubated with 500 μl of 10 mm Tris (pH 10.5) on a shaker for 20 min to dissolve the bound dye followed by colorimetric determination at 550 nm for 100-μl aliquots. Measurement of Caspase-8 Activity—Cells in 100-mm dishes were treated with or without 600 J/m2 UVB and cultured for 5 h before being harvested. Caspase-8 activity was determined using ApoAlert caspase colorimetric assay kits (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The protease activity was determined by comparing the absorbance of p-nitroaniline (p-NA) in treated cells with that in untreated cells. Statistical Analysis—The data were presented as the mean ± S.D. Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t-test, and p value <0.05 was considered significant. ING3 Is DNA Damage Inducible—To test our hypothesis that ING3 may play an important role in the cellular response to UV irradiation, we analyzed ING3 expression level after UVB irradiation in melanoma cells. We found that the ING3 protein expression was rapidly induced in MMRU melanoma cells as early as 0.5 h after UVB irradiation, reached its peak at 6 h (4.6-fold compared with un-irradiated MMRU cells), and returned to the basal level 24 h later (Fig. 1A). Using RT-PCR, we also found that this induction was at mRNA level (Fig. 1B). As expected, p53 levels were increased after UV irradiation. However, the p53 accumulation was obvious 2 h following UV irradiation, and its level gradually increased within 24 h (Fig. 1A). To assess whether UV-mediated induction of ING3 is a common event rather than a cell line-specific observation, we further examined ING3 expression after UV irradiation in other melanoma cell lines and HCT116 colon carcinoma cell lines. Despite the differences in basal expression level of ING3 among melanoma cell lines, we detected the induction of ING3 in all other five melanoma cell lines (MEWO, MMAN, Sk-mel-3, Sk-mel-5, and Sk-mel-24) (Fig. 1C). We also detected the induction of ING3 in both wild-type p53 and p53-null HCT116 cells, indicating that UV-induced ING3 expression is p53 independent (Fig. 1D). To evaluate whether ING3 can be induced by other DNA damage stimulus, we treated MMRU cells with genotoxic chemicals, including cisplatin, etoposide, doxorubicin, and camptothecin. Results showed that ING3 was induced by all the treatments except cisplatin (Fig. 1E). ING3 Promotes UV-induced Apoptosis—To investigate the role of ING3 in cellular stress response to UV irradiation in melanoma cells, we generated stable clones overexpressing ING3 in MMRU cells. ING3 protein and mRNA levels in the stable clones were analyzed by Western blot or RT-PCR, respectively. The results showed that the ING3 stable clones (F5, F6, and F9) had 3- to 5-fold higher ING3 expression compared with parental MMRU cells (Fig. 2, A and B). We noticed that the cells stably expressing ING3 are slightly bigger and less dendritic compared with the parental MMRU cells (Fig. 2C). There were increased basal apoptotic cells in ING3 stable clones (Fig. 3, A and B), but it was statistically obvious only when being determined by Annexin-V-FLUOS and PI double staining (Fig. 3C). However, ING3 stable clones were significantly more sensitive to UV-induced apoptosis by FACS analysis or Hoechst staining (Fig. 3, A and B). Compared with parental cells, ING3 stable clones enhanced UV-induced apoptosis by 35-100% after 300 or 600 J/m2 UVB irradiation. The ING3 stable clone F5, which has the highest expression of ING3 among all the stable clones (Fig. 2A), had a 2-fold increase in UV-induced apoptosis compared with the parental MMRU cells (p <0.001). As expected, we observed more cleaved caspase-9, caspase-3, and PARP in ING3 stable clone F5 cells after UV irradiation (Fig. 3D). The results of sulforhodamine B cell survival assay showed that ING3 stable clone F5 has fewer survived cells compared with parental MMRU cells after 300 or 600 J/m2 UVB irradiation (Fig. 3E). ING3 Mediates UV-induced Apoptosis Independently of p53—Because both ING1b and ING2, the homologues of ING3, can promote UV-induced apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner (26Scott M. Bonnefin P. Vieyra D. Boisvert F.M. Young D. Bazett-Jones D.P. Riabowol K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3455-3462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Cheung K.J. Li G. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 279: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we then investigated whether the increased apoptosis by ING3 also required the functional p53 protein. The p53 siRNA was used to knock down p53 expression in ING3 stable clone F5, which harbors the wild-type p53. Western blot analysis showed that the protein levels of p53 and its downstream target Bax were dramatically reduced in both MMRU and F5 cells after siRNA treatment (Fig. 4A, bottom panel). However, knock down of p53 in F5 cells did not cause a reduction of apoptosis after UVB irradiation (Fig. 4A, top panel), suggesting that ING3-mediated apoptosis is p53 independent. Similarly, ING3 overexpression did not have an effect on the expression of p53-targeting mitochondrial proteins Bax, Bcl-2, Bad, and Noxa (Fig. 4B), indicating that ING3 did not directly activate the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. When HCT116 cells were employed, we found that ING3 promoted both basal and UV-induced apoptosis in either wild-type p53 or p53-null HCT116 cells (Fig. 4C). ING3 Mediates UV-induced Apoptosis via Death Receptor Pathway— Western blot analysis showed that more caspase-8 was cleaved in F5 cells upon UV irradiation, which activated caspase cascades through the cleavage of Bid (Fig. 5A). The colorimetric assay also suggested higher caspase-8 activity in F5 cells after UV irradiation (Fig. 5B). These data suggested that ING3 may mediate UV-induced apoptosis through the death receptor pathway. To confirm that caspase-8 activation was crucial for ING3-mediated apoptosis under UV stress, we transfected the MMRU and F5 cells with a dominant negative caspase-8 expression vector. Results showed that inhibition of caspase-8 completely abolished the ING3-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, when the activation of caspase-8 was blocked, we did not observe a significant difference in caspase-9 activation between F5 and its parental MMRU cells in response to UV irradiation (Fig. 5D), confirming that caspase-9 was activated by caspase-8 via Bid cleavage in F5 cells. The Fas death receptor is activated by binding to Fas ligands. Fas death receptors then recruit Fas-associated death domain protein to the plasma membrane, which in turn activates pro-caspase-8, leading to the activation of a cascade of caspases (37Nafata S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 29-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 38Peter M.E. Krammer P.H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that Fas death receptor pathway is activated by UV radiation and contributes to UV-induced apoptosis (39Leverkus M. Yaar M. Gilchrest B.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 40Ivanov V.N. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3003-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To confirm that Fas death receptor pathway is crucial for ING3-mediated apoptosis under UV stress, MMRU and F5 cells were preincubated at 4 °C for 30 min, which was shown to block the Fas aggregation (41Kulms D. Poppelmann B. Yarosh D. Luger T.A. Krutmann J. Schwarz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7974-7979Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Our results showed that there was no significant difference in apoptosis rate between MMRU and F5 cells in response to UV irradiation (Fig. 5E). Meanwhile, when Fas expression was knocked down by Fas siRNA, we observed a significant decrease in the apoptosis of F5 cells after UV irradiation (Fig. 5F). ING3 Induces Fas Expression—To investigate how ING3 activated Fas death receptor pathway, we examined whether ING3 could modulate Fas expression. Our data indicated that ING3 induced Fas protein expression at non-stress condition and after UVB irradiation (Fig. 6A). The highest Fas induction by ING3 was observed at 8 h after 600 J/m2 UVB irradiation. Moreover, the induction of Fas by ING3 was at the transcriptional level (Fig. 6B). ING3 did not have effect on Fas ligand expression (Fig. 6A). Knock Down of ING3 Decreases UV-induced Apoptosis—To determine the physiological role of ING3 in UV-induced apoptosis, we knocked down ING3 expression in MMRU cells by ING3 siRNA (Fig. 7A). FACS analysis showed that UV-induced apoptosis in MMRU cells was significantly reduced after ING3 knock down (Fig. 7B). Like with its homologues ING1b and ING2, ING3 expression was rapidly induced after DNA damage. This induction by UV irradiation occurred much earlier than the p53 protein accumulation in melanoma cells (Fig. 1A), suggesting that this induction was independent of functional p53. The p53 independency of UV-induced ING3 expression was confirmed in melanoma cell lines with different p53 mutational status and in wild-type p53 and p53-deficient HCT116 cells (Fig. 1, C and D). Although UV can induce G1 or G2 cell cycle arrest (42Gujuluva C.N. Baek J.H. Shin K.H. Cherrick H.M. Park N.H. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1819-1827PubMed Google Scholar, 43Ceruti J.M. Scassa M.E. Flo J.M. Varone C.L. Canepa E.T. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4065-4080Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and ING3 may be periodically expressed during the cell cycle, this induction is not likely due to the augmented cell cycle population, because the induction of ING3 was rapid and transient and the ING3 expression returned to normal level 24 h after UV irradiation. DNA damage caused by UV and other genotoxic stress activates checkpoint proteins ATM or ATR, which then modulate the cell fate in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, or apoptosis through activating the downstream mediators, transducers, and effectors like p53, BRCA1, and Chk1/2 (44Kastan M.B. Bartek J. Nature. 2004; 432: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (2138) Google Scholar, 45Latonen L. Laiho M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1755: 71-89PubMed Google Scholar). Considering that ING3 is a key subunit of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex (24Doyon Y. Selleck W. Lane W.S. Tan S. Cote J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1884-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), the inducible ING3 may play an important role in chromatin remodeling in cellular response to UV irradiation. In this study, we for the first time showed that stable overexpression of ING3 can remarkably promote UV-induced apoptosis in melanoma cells. This increased apoptosis was independent of p53 function, although its homologues ING1b and ING2 both enhanced UV-induced apoptosis in p53-dependent manner (28Chin M.Y. Ng K.C. Li G. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 304: 531-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 29Cheung K.J. Mitchell D. Lin P. Li G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4974-4977PubMed Google Scholar). Because it was reported that ING3 can mediate p53-dependent growth arrest and apoptosis in RKO cells (22Nagashima M. Shiseki M. Pedeux R.M. Okamura S. Kitahama-Shiseki M. Miura K. Yokota J. Harris C.C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), it is likely that ING3 can modulate apoptosis in both a p53-dependent and -independent manner, which may rely on the cell type. The ING family proteins, ING1b, ING2, ING4, and ING5, all induce growth arrest and apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. Among these ING proteins, ING1b, ING4, and ING5 are physically associated with p53, whereas ING2 and ING3 are not (10Stratton M.R. Wooster R.W. Futreal P.A. J. Drugs Dermatol. 2004; 3: 573-575PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, ING1b, ING2, ING4, and ING5 can also activate and stabilize p53 by stimulating the acetylation of p53 at residue Lys-382 and/or Lys-373 (11Campos E.I. Chin M.Y. Kuo W.H. Li G. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 2597-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 25Nagashima M. Shiseki M. Miura K. Hagiwara K. Linke S.P. Pedeux R. Wang X.W. Yokota J. Riabowol K. Harris C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9671-9676Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, and 46Shiseki M. Nagashima M. Peduex R.M. Kitahama-Shiseki M. Miura K. Okamura S. Onogi H. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Yakota J. Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2373-2378PubMed Google Scholar). Although ING1b also induced apoptosis in a p53-independent manner, it was possibly through the homologues of p53, p63α and p73α (47Tsang F.C. Po L.S. Leung K.M. Lau A. Siu W.Y. Poon R.Y. FEBS Lett. 2003; 553: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this study, we did not detect any significant change of p53-responsive proteins, including Bax, Bcl-2, and Noxa, after overexpressing ING3, which further supports the notion that ING3-mediated apoptosis after UV irradiation is p53 independent. This discrepancy of ING3 function from other family members is probably because ING3 is evolutionarily distinct from other family members (13Pedeux R. Sengupta S. Shen J.C. Demidov O.N. Saito S. Onogi H. Kumamoto K. Wincovitch S. Garfield S.H. McMenamin M. Nagashima M. Grossman S.R. Appella E. Harris C.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6639-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Both ING1 and ING2 contain a small C-terminal conserved protein-interacting motif that binds a defined subset of peptides and, together with plant homeodomain, binds to phosphatidylinositol monophosphates (13Pedeux R. Sengupta S. Shen J.C. Demidov O.N. Saito S. Onogi H. Kumamoto K. Wincovitch S. Garfield S.H. McMenamin M. Nagashima M. Grossman S.R. Appella E. Harris C.C. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 2003; 114: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). ING1b also contains a unique N-terminal PCNA-interacting protein (PIP) domain, through which ING1b promoted UV-induced apoptosis (27Cheung K.J. Li G. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 279: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Moreover, there are two distinct insertions of 102 and 54 amino acids located between the potential chromatin regulatory and nuclear localization signals regions of ING3, respectively (13Pedeux R. Sengupta S. Shen J.C. Demidov O.N. Saito S. Onogi H. Kumamoto K. Wincovitch S. Garfield S.H. McMenamin M. Nagashima M. Grossman S.R. Appella E. Harris C.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6639-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Therefore, it will be interesting to clarify whether the structural differences between ING3 and ING1b or ING2 are responsible for the different pathways in UV-induced apoptosis. UV-induced apoptosis can be triggered through both p53-mediated mitochondrial pathway and death receptor pathways (50Kulms D. Schwarz T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 837-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In this study, both Western blot analysis and caspase-8 activity assay indicated that caspase-8 was more activated in ING3 stable clone F5 cells than in parental MMRU cells in response to UV irradiation (Fig. 5, A and B). Moreover, inhibition of caspase-8 activation blocked the cleavage of caspase-9 (Fig. 5D), confirming that ING3 does not directly affect the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway but operates through the cross-talk linked by cleaved Bid. The ING3-mediated apoptosis was abrogated when cells were transfected with dominant negative caspase-8 (Fig. 5C) or preincubated at 4 °C (Fig. 5E), supporting that death receptor pathways mediate ING3-triggered apoptosis. Because Fas siRNA treatment significantly reduced ING3-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 5F) and ING3 stable clone F5 had higher Fas mRNA and protein levels in both basal and UV-irradiated conditions (Fig. 6, A and B), Fas death receptor pathways are likely involved in ING3-mediated apoptosis. However, because both the inhibition of caspase-8 function and the blockage of death receptor aggregation can inhibit not only the Fas pathway but all the other death receptor signaling, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-1, TNFα-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors, and death receptor-3 (DR-3) signaling (51Lavrik I. Golks A. Krammer P.H. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 265-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), it remains possible that other death receptor pathways may also be involved in ING3-mediated apoptosis in response to UV irradiation. Like its homologue ING2 (28Chin M.Y. Ng K.C. Li G. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 304: 531-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), ING3 up-regulated Fas expression, leading to the activation of the death receptor pathway. Fas protein is a death receptor on the cell membrane, whereas ING3 protein is mainly located in the nucleus. Similar to transcriptional factors, including NF-κB and Egr-1 (52Thyss R. Virolle V. Imbert V. Peyron J.F. Aberdam D. Virolle T. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 128-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), the rapid induction and recovery of ING3 following UV irradiation suggested that ING3 may function as a transcription factor in response to DNA damage. Although ING3 does not modulate p53 function, it is likely that ING3 can act as a transcription factor or cofactor to mediate apoptosis by modulating chromatin remodeling through the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase multisubunit complex (24Doyon Y. Selleck W. Lane W.S. Tan S. Cote J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1884-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), which may help explain why loss of functional Tip60, the core histone acetyltransferase of NuA4 complex, failed to signal the existence of DNA damage to the apoptotic machinery (53Ikura T. Ogryzko V.V. Grigoriev M. Groisman R. Wang J. Horikoshi M. Scully R. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). The exact molecular mechanism of ING3-mediated chromatin-related transcriptional regulation remains to be revealed. In summary, we have demonstrated that ING3 regulates UV-induced apoptosis through modulating Fas expression, thereby resulting in the activation of Fas/caspase8 pathway and the activation of caspase cascades via Bid cleavage. We thank Drs. R. Byers, A. P. Albino, and B. Vogelstein for providing cell lines and Drs. O. Mamoru and K. Arul for the pcDNA3-ING3 and dominant negative caspase-8 plasmids, respectively."

Granzyme B (GrB) and perforin (PFN) are two proteins contained in granules and implicated in one of the mechanisms by which cytotoxic lymphocytes and natural killer cells exert their cytotoxicity against virus-infected, alloreactive, or transformed cells. The distribution of GrB and PFN in the skin has received little attention. However, Berthou and co-workers (Berthou, C., Michel, L., Soulie, A., Jean-Louis, F., Flageul, B., Dubertret, L., Sigaux, F., Zhang, Y., and Sasportes, M. (1997) J. Immunol. 159, 5293-5300) described that, whereas freshly isolated epidermal cells did not express GrB or PFN, keratinocyte growth to confluence was associated with GrB and PFN mRNA and protein synthesis. In this work, we have investigated the possible role of UV-B on GrB and PFN expression in keratinocytes. We found that UV-B induces GrB and PFN expression in these cells through redox-, epidermal growth factor receptor-, and mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent signaling. Furthermore, under UV irradiation, keratinocytes acquire a significant cytotoxicity, which is GrB and PFN dependent, toward a variety of cellular targets including transformed T-lymphocytes, melanocytes, and keratinocytes. This phenomenon may have important functional consequences in the regulation of skin inflammatory response and in the emergence of cancer skin.

This phenomenon may have important functional consequences in the regulation of skin inflammatory response and in the emergence of cancer skin. Human skin, unlike all other organs, is continuously and directly exposed to environmental influences. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun is among the most ubiquitous damaging environmental factors from which human skin must protect itself. UV radiation in sunlight is divided into three regions depending on wavelength, short-wave UV-C (200-280 nm), mid-wave UV-B (280-320 nm), and long-wave UV-A (320-400 nm). UV-C has the highest energy and, hence, is the most biologically damaging region of UV radiation. However, UV-C in solar radiation is filtered out by the ozone layer of the atmosphere of the Earth, and therefore, its role in human pathogenesis is minimal. Both UV-B, and to a lesser extent, UV-A radiation are responsible as causative factors for various skin disorders including photoaging and skin cancer (1de Gruijl F.R. Sterenborg H.J. Forbes P.D.

UV radiation, in particular UV-B from sunlight is known to alter cellular function via DNA damage (4Ananthaswamy H.N. Pierceall W.E. Prog. Clin. Biol.

UV-B is therefore one of the most important external stimuli that affects skin by inducing immunosuppression, cancer, premature skin aging, inflammation, and cell death (2Goihman-Yahr M. Clin.

Dermatol. 1995; 104: 922-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar).The granule secretory pathway is one of the mechanisms by which cytotoxic lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells exert their cytotoxicity against virus-infected, alloreactive, or transformed cells. The contact between effector cells and aberrant target cells induces exocytosis from the cytotoxic lymphocyte or the NK cells of granules that contain the potential cytolytic effector molecules (10Barry M. Bleackley R.C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 401-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This mechanism depends on the actions of several constituents of the secreted granules that contain the pore-forming molecule perforin (PFN) together with a variety of granule-associated enzymes (such as granzymes and granulysin) (11Trapani J.A. Smyth M.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 735-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Among of them, granzyme B (GrB) is the main effector when dealing with target cell death (12Heusel J.W. Wesselschmidt R.L. Shresta S. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 977-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Although the precise molecular and cellular pathways through which PFN and GrB cooperate to bring about cell death are still highly controversial, experiments indicate an absolute dependence on PFN for all granule-mediated cell death (13Shi L. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Aebersold R. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1521-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In vivo, this is illustrated by the fact that targeted mutation of the pfn gene in mice results in profound immunosuppression and altered skin and tumor allograft rejections (14Kagi D. Ledermann B. Burki K. Seiler P. Odermatt B. Olsen K.J. Podack E.R. Zinkernagel R.M. Hengartner H. Nature. 1994; 369: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar). By contrast, deficiency of grB has a severely depressed ability to cause target cell lysis (12Heusel J.W. Wesselschmidt R.L. Shresta S. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 977-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Previous studies have described that GrB and PFN are not strictly distributed in lymphoid cells. Indeed, GrB and PFN are contained in other hematopoietic cells, such as normal and leukemic myeloid cells (15Bruno A.P. Lautier D. d'Orgeix A.T. Laurent G. Quillet-Mary A. Blood. 2000; 96: 1914-1920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as non-hematopoietic cells, such as chondrocytes of articular cartilage (16Horiuchi K. Saito S. Sasaki R. Tomatsu T. Toyama Y. J. Rheumatol. 2003; 30: 1799-1810PubMed Google Scholar) and cells of the reproductive system, including spermatogenic cells (17Hirst C.E. Buzza M.S. Sutton V.R. Trapani J.A. Loveland K.L. Bird P.I. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2001; 7: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), granulosa cells of human ovary (18Sasson R. Amsterdam A. Biochem.

Reprod. 2001; 7: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).The distribution of GrB and PFN in the skin has received little attention except in the context of immune skin disorders, such as in allergy, psoriasis, vitiligo, and lichen planus, or eventually in graft versus host disease related skin injury. These situations are often associated with dermal or epidermal infiltration by GrB- and PFN-producing activated T cells. However, Berthou and co-workers (19Berthou C. Michel L. Soulie A. Jean-Louis F. Flageul B. Dubertret L. Sigaux F. Zhang Y. Sasportes M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5293-5300PubMed Google Scholar) described that, whereas freshly isolated epidermal cells did not express GrB or PFN, keratinocyte growth to confluence was associated to GrB and PFN mRNA and protein synthesis. In this study, the authors proposed that these proteins could be involved in epidermal homeostasis by preventing invasion by pathogens or migration of inflammatory cells (19Berthou C. Michel L. Soulie A. Jean-Louis F. Flageul B. Dubertret L. Sigaux F. Zhang Y. Sasportes M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5293-5300PubMed Google Scholar). The role of GrB and PFN in keratinocytes has not deserved further attention. This is surprising based on the importance of PFN-dependent cytolysis not only in a large variety of bacterial and viral infections but also in tumor surveillance (for review, see Ref. 20van den Broek M.F. Hengartner H. Exp. Physiol. 2000; 85: 681-685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is also surprising based on the role of GrB, which is not simply implied in cytolysis, but also exerts, as an extracellular enzyme, PFN-independent important functions in extracellular matrix remodeling as well as in cell adhesion and motility (21Buzza M.S. Zamurs L. Sun J. Bird C.H. Smith A.I. Trapani J.A. Froelich C.J. Nice E.C. Bird P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23549-23558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar).In this study, we have investigated the possible role of UV-B on GrB and PFN expression in keratinocytes. We found that UV-B induces GrB and PFN expression in these cells through redox-, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-, and MAPK-dependent signaling. Furthermore, under UV irradiation, keratinocytes acquire a significant cytotoxicity that is GrB- and PFN-dependent toward a variety of cellular targets including transformed T-lymphocytes, melanocytes, and keratinocytes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Chemicals—Immortalized human HaCaT keratinocytes, provided by CERPER (Pierre-Fabre, France), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Culture medium was supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), glutamine (2 mm), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and penicillin (200 units/ml) (all these reagents were purchased from Eurobio, les Ulis, France). Normal human primary keratinocytes (HK) were kindly provided by Prof. Hovnanian (Toulouse, France). HK were isolated from skin biopsies as previously described (22Watt F.M. Boukamp P. Hornung J. Fusenig N.E. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1987; 279: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and were expanded on a feeder layer of lethally irradiated 3T3-J2 mouse fibroblasts in keratinocyte growth medium, following the method described by Rheinwald and Green (23Rheinwald J.G. Green H. Cell. 1975; 6: 331-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3853) Google Scholar). K562 and Jurkat cell lines were obtained from the ATCC (Rockville, MD). The K562 cell line was stably transfected with pEGFP/PI-9 plasmid, kindly provided by Dr. P. I. Bird (Monash University, Victoria, Australia), using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's recommendations. Selection of transfected cells was done with 500 μg/ml geneticin. The melanoma cell line (KAL) was established by Cohen-Knafo et al. (24Cohen-Knafo E. al Saati T. Aziza J. Ralfkiaer E. Selves J. Gorguet B. Delsol G. J. Clin. Pathol. 1995; 48: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). K562, Jurkat, and KAL cells were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS, glutamine (2 mm), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and penicillin (200 units/ml).The UV-B irradiation source was a fluorescent lamp that emitted an energy peak at 310 nm. The emitted dose was calculated using a UV-B radiometer photodetector. UV-B irradiation was performed in cells incubated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).Drugs and Reagents—The rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Abs) against PFN and JNK (used at 1/500) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The rabbit polyclonal anti-MAPKAPK-2 and anti-phospho-MAPKAPK-2 Thr222 Abs (used at 1/1000) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (St. Quentin en Yvelines, France). The mouse monoclonal anti-GrB (clone GrB-7; used at 1/200), anti-β-actin (used at 1/1000), anti-phospho-JNK (used at 1/1000), and anti-GFP (used at 1/500) Abs were purchased, respectively, from Euromedex (Souffelweyersheim, France), NeoMarkers (Interchim, Montluçon, France), Cell Signaling Technology, and Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Affinity purified secondary Abs were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc. (Beckman Coulter Co., Marseille, France).3,4-Dichloroisocoumarin (DCIC) was purchased from ICN Biomedical (Aurora, OH) and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. SB203580, SP600125, and PD98059 were purchased from VWR International (Fontenay sous Bois, France). Antisense oligonucleotides and controls directed against GrB have been designed and manufactured by Biognostik (Euromedex) (15Bruno A.P. Lautier D. d'Orgeix A.T. Laurent G. Quillet-Mary A. Blood. 2000; 96: 1914-1920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other products were purchased from Sigma.Western Blot Analysis—Cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed, and then scrapped in lysis buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) for 5 min on ice, followed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. For each lysate, 30 μg of total protein was boiled for 5 min at 95 °C in the presence of 5% β-mercaptoethanol.Proteins were separated in a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Nonspecific binding to the membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 10% nonfat milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST). Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with specific primary antibody diluted at an appropriate concentration in PBST containing 1% nonfat milk. Membranes were then washed three times at room temperature and bound immunoglobulins were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Ab for 30 min at room temperature in 1% nonfat milk dissolved in PBST. Membranes were then washed with PBST and bound Abs were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence system ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences).Real-time Quantitative PCR—Total cellular RNA was extracted with TRIzol®. The cDNA was synthesized using random hexamers and oligo(dT) from 4 μg of mRNA and performed with the SuperScript™ First Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). Forward and reverse primers were designed following Guilloton et al. (25Guilloton F. de Thonel A. Jean C. Demur C. Mansat-De Mas V. Laurent G. Quillet-Mary A. Leukemia. 2005; 19: 2206-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) for GrB and following Simon et al. (26Simon T. Opelz G. Wiesel M. Ott R.C. Susal C. Am. J. Transplant. 2003; 3: 1121-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) for PFN (Table 1). Real-time PCR was performed using an iCycler thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems 7000 Real-Time PCR System, Courtaboeuf, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reactions were performed with 0.3 μm primers. Nucleotides, Taq DNA polymerase, and buffer were included in SYBR Green JumpStart™ Taq ReadyMix™ for quantitative PCR. cDNA amplification consisted of one cycle at 95 °C for 1 min and 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, and annealing and extension at 60 °C for 1 min. The threshold cycle (CT) values were determined by iCycler software (ABI Prism 7000) and the quantification data were analyzed following the ΔΔCT method using S14 as reference. We have checked that PCR efficiency (E) of the amplification was similar whatever the primers and we calculated the relative amount (RA): RA = (1 + E)-ΔΔCT. Electrophoresis of PCR products on a 2% agarose gel was undertaken when no gene expression was observed in non-treated cells.TABLE 1Oligonucleotide primer sequences for real-time quantitative PCRTarget geneForward primer (5′–3′)Reverse primer (5′–3′)Granzyme BTTCGTGCTGACAGCTGCTCACTCTCTCCAGCTGCAGTAGCATGAPerforinTGGAGTGCCGCTTCTACAGTTGCCCTCTTGAAGTCAGGGTGS14ATCAAACTCCGGGCCACAGGAGTGCTGTCAGAGGGGATGGGG Open table in a new tab Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy Analysis—Cells were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (10 min at room temperature), washed twice with PBS, and permeabilized using 100% methanol (2 min at room temperature). Coverslips were washed with PBS, saturated with 20% FCS/PBS for 20 min at room temperature, and incubated with anti-GrB and/or anti-PFN Abs, both at a 1/20 dilution in 1% FCS/PBS, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and/or Cy3 goat anti-mouse IgG (Beckman Coulters) diluted at 1/100 in 1% FCS/PBS for 25 min at room temperature. After washing, the coverslips were sealed and examined with the confocal imaging system that was a Zeiss (Oberkochen, Germany) scanning assembly incorporating argon and helium/neon lasers coupled to a Zeiss Axiovert 100 fluorescence microscope.Cytotoxicity Assays—The CytoTox 96 Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to evaluate stress-induced cytotoxicity (15Bruno A.P. Lautier D. d'Orgeix A.T. Laurent G. Quillet-Mary A. Blood. 2000; 96: 1914-1920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This assay is a colorimetric alternative to the 51Cr-release cytotoxicity assay based on the measurement of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a stable cytosolic enzyme that is released on cell lysis, in much the same way as 51Cr is released in radioactive assay and allows discrimination between effectors and targets LDH release (27Brander C. Wyss-Coray T. Mauri D. Bettens F. Pichler W.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 3217-3223Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Variations on this technology have been reported for measuring natural cytotoxicity and have been demonstrated to be identical (within experimental error) to values determined in parallel 51Cr-release assays and was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, effector cells (HaCaT: 4 × 106 cells/ml) were irradiated with 0.2 kJ/m2 UV-B, incubated for 16 h, trypsinized, washed, resuspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% FCS, incubated for 1 h, and mixed with target cells (K562, HaCaT, and HK cells: 1 × 105 cells/ml) in U-bottom 96-microwell plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) at various effector to target (E:T) ratios in triplicate. Microplates were spun for 3 min at 200 × g and incubated for 4 h at 37°C, 5% CO2. Supernatant (50 μl) was collected from each well and added to 50 μl of reconstituted Substrate Mix for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. Enzymatic reaction was stopped by adding Stop Solution (50 μl). Counting was realized by recording absorbance at 490 nm. Maximum release (TM) was determined by lysing target cells with 20 μl of Lysis Solution. Spontaneous release (TS) was determined by incubation of target cells in medium in the absence of effectors cells. Effectors spontaneous release (ES) was done with effector cells alone at the same E:T ratio. Results are expressed as a percentage of cytotoxicity, using the formula: % cytotoxicity = [(experimental - ES - TS)/(TM - TS)] × 100.Blocking experiments were performed with DCIC (20 μmol/liter), a broadly reactive serine esterase inhibitor, which has been shown to neutralize GrB enzymatic activity (28Hudig D. Allison N.J. Pickett T.M. Winkler U. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1360-1368PubMed Google Scholar, 29Odake S. Kam C.M. Narasimhan L. Poe M. Blake J.T. Krahenbuhl O. Tschopp J.

Kane K.P. Mescher M.F. Clark W.R. Nature. 1987; 330: 71-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), anti-CD95 (Fas/APO-1) blocking Ab (ZB4) (500 ng/ml), or antisense or sense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (5 μmol/liter) directed against GrB.Statistics—The Student's t test was performed to evaluate the statistical significance.RESULTSUV-B-induced GrB and PFN mRNA Expression in Keratinocytes—GrB and PFN mRNA expressions in the HaCaT cell line were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR followed by a separation of PCR products in 2% agarose gel. We first examined whether UV-B irradiation was able to stimulate production of GrB and PFN in HaCaT cells. Cells were irradiated with UV-B at different doses. In untreated non-confluent HaCaT cells, GrB and PFN mRNA were undetectable as previously described (19Berthou C. Michel L. Soulie A. Jean-Louis F. Flageul B. Dubertret L. Sigaux F. Zhang Y. Sasportes M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5293-5300PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B). However, UV-B irradiation induced GrB and PFN mRNA in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A and B). At the dose of 0.2 kJ/m2, cell loss was about 15% after 48 h (data not shown). Therefore, this dose was used for further experiments.In HaCaT cells grown at confluence, GrB and PFN mRNA were detectable as previously described (19Berthou C. Michel L. Soulie A. Jean-Louis F. Flageul B. Dubertret L. Sigaux F. Zhang Y. Sasportes M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5293-5300PubMed Google Scholar). However, in these conditions of culture, UV-B irradiation was still able to increase 3-4-fold GrB and PFN expression (Fig. 1C).In primary normal human keratinocytes (HK) from different donors, UV-B also increased GrB and PFN expression (Fig. 1D). It is interesting to note that, contrary to HaCaT cells, untreated fresh human keratinocytes do express GrB but not PFN. S14, a ribosomal protein, was used as an internal control as previously described (31Leonard M. Brice M. Engel J.D. Papayannopoulou T.

Indeed, S14 mRNA expression was found to be invariable, whereas we detected minor but significant changes in β-actin in UV-irradiated HaCaT cells. These results demonstrate that treatment with UV-B irradiation resulted in a significant increase in grB and pfn gene expression in both HaCaT and fresh human keratinocytes.UV-B-induced GrB and PFN Protein Expression in Keratinocytes—GrB and PFN protein expressions in the HaCaT cell line were analyzed by Western blot and confocal microscopy. Western blot analysis revealed that treatment with UV-B (0.2 kJ/m2) resulted in an increase in GrB and PFN protein expression 16 h after irradiation, as illustrated in Fig. 2A. Confocal analysis confirmed the lack of GrB or PFN in untreated cells (Fig. 2B). However, after irradiation, PFN was easily detected in the cytoplasm of HaCaT cells, whereas immunostaining with anti-GrB showed a more diffuse distribution with a predominant cytoplasmic distribution associated with a weak but detectable accumulation in the nucleus (Fig. 2B). Merging revealed that in the cytoplasm, PFN and GrB co-localized at 72.6% (Fig. 2B). This co-localization was also tested with Cy5 goat anti-mouse IgG and we obtained the same results (data not shown). These data suggested that these two lytic proteins accumulated into granules as they do in cytotoxic granules contained in activated immune effectors. These results demonstrate that in keratinocytes, UV-B irradiation induces the expression of GrB and PFN proteins that co-localize in cytoplasm.FIGURE 2Expression of GrB and PFN proteins in HaCaT cells. Cells were irradiated with UV-B (0.2 kJ/m2) and incubated for 16 h before protein extraction (A) or confocal analysis (B). Western blot and confocal analysis was performed using anti-GrB and anti-PFN Abs. β-Actin was used as a loading control for Western blot (A). These data are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Role of MAPK Pathway in the Induction of GrB and PFN by UV-B Irradiation—UV-B irradiation activates a large variety of signaling pathways, including c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), and p38 MAPK modules (33Devary Y.

To assess the involvement of MAPK activation in HaCaT cells, we examined whether different inhibitors suppressed GrB and/or PFN induction in response to UV-B irradiation.As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, SB203580, a specific and potent chemical inhibitor for p38 MAPK, totally inhibited GrB mRNA (A) and protein (B) expression. In contrast, SP600125, a specific inhibitor for JNK, and PD98059, a specific inhibitor for ERK, did not significantly reduce GrB mRNA and protein induction. Consistent with these results, phosphorylation of MAPKAPK-2, a substrate of p38 MAPK (36Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar), was also observed in HaCaT cells irradiated with UV-B, indicating that UV-B activates p38 MAPK (Fig. 3C). Then, grB gene stimulation was found to be specifically dependent from p38 MAPK module.FIGURE 3Role of MAPK pathway in the induction of GrB and PFN by UV-B irradiation. A and B, HaCaT cells were pre-treated with SB203580 (1 μm), an inhibitor for p38 MAPK, and/or SP600125 (5 μm), a specific inhibitor for JNK, or PD98059 (25 μm), a specific inhibitor of ERK for 1 h. Cells were then irradiated with UV-B (0.2 kJ/m2) and incubated for 16 h before mRNA extraction (A) or confocal analysis (B). A, expression of GrB and PFN mRNA was measured by real-time quantitative PCR. Electrophoresis of PCR products on a 2% agarose gel was undertaken because no gene expression was observed in non-treated cells. B, confocal analysis was performed using anti-GrB and anti-PFN Abs. C and D, HaCaT cells were pre-treated with SB203580 (1 μm) or SP600125 (5 μm) for 1 h. Cells were or were not irradiated with UV-B (0.2 kJ/m2) and incubated for 1 h before protein extraction. Expression of phosphorylated MAP-KAPK-2 (C) and phospho-JNK (D) was analyzed by Western blot.

Moreover, as expected, co-treatment with SB203580 and SP600125 resulted in total inhibition of both GrB and PFN expression (Fig. 3B). Altogether, these results show that UV-B irradiation activates GrB and PFN through p38 MAPK and JNK, respectively.Role of Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor in the Induction of GrB and PFN by UV-B Irradiation—Previous studies have documented that"
https://openalex.org/W2023879911,"Sphingosine kinases catalyze the formation of sphingosine 1-phosphate, a bioactive lipid involved in many aspects of cellular regulation, including the fundamental biological processes of cell growth and survival. A diverse range of cell agonists induce activation of human sphingosine kinase 1 (hSK1) and, commonly, its translocation to the plasma membrane. Although the activation of hSK1 in response to at least some agonists occurs directly via its phosphorylation at Ser225 by ERK1/2, many aspects governing the regulation of this phosphorylation and subsequent translocation remain unknown. Here, in an attempt to understand some of these processes, we have examined the known interaction of hSK1 with calmodulin (CaM). By using a combination of limited proteolysis, peptide interaction analysis, and site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified that the CaM-binding site of hSK1 resides in the region spanned by residues 191-206. Specifically, Phe197 and Leu198 are critically involved in the interaction because a version of hSK1 incorporating mutations of both Phe197 → Ala and Leu198 → Gln failed to bind CaM. We have also shown for the first time that human sphingosine kinase 2 (hSK2) binds CaM, and does so via a CaM binding region that is conserved with hSK1 because comparable mutations in hSK2 also ablate CaM binding to this protein. By using the CaM-binding-deficient version of hSK1, we have begun to elucidate the role of CaM in hSK1 regulation by demonstrating that disruption of the CaM-binding site ablates agonist-induced translocation of hSK1 from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane, while having no effect on hSK1 phosphorylation and catalytic activation.

Sphingosine kinases are important signaling enzymes because of their role in the synthesis of the bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). 3The abbreviations used are: S1P, sphingosine 1-phosphate; CaM, calmodulin; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; hSK1, human sphingosine kinase 1; hSK2, human sphingosine kinase 2; PCB, putative calmodulin binding region; PA, phosphatidic acid; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PS, phosphatidylserine; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α. 3The abbreviations used are: S1P, sphingosine 1-phosphate; CaM, calmodulin; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; hSK1, human sphingosine kinase 1; hSK2, human sphingosine kinase 2; PCB, putative calmodulin binding region; PA, phosphatidic acid; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PS, phosphatidylserine; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α. Many studies have shown that S1P can affect a diverse array of biological processes, including calcium mobilization, mitogenesis, apoptosis, atherosclerosis, inflammatory responses, cell motility, and angiogenesis (1Pyne S.

Although some of these varied effects of S1P result from its action as a ligand for S1P-specific cell-surface G-protein-coupled receptors (5Hla T. Lee M.-J. Ancellin N. Paik J.H. Kluk M.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1875-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), significant evidence now exists that indicates S1P can also function intracellularly as a second messenger, particularly in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis (6Maceyka M. Payne S.G. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar).Two sphingosine kinases exist in humans (hSK1 and hSK2), with most studies to date focusing on hSK1. Although these two enzymes originate from different genes and differ in size, tissue distribution, developmental expression, substrate specificity, specific activity, and possibly in their cellular roles (7Liu H.

In fact, almost all of the hSK1 sequence aligns with regions of the larger hSK2 sequence with 80% overall similarity (45% identity) (7Liu H. Sugiura M. Nava V.E. Edsall L.C. Kono K. Poulton S. Milstien S. Kohama T. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19513-19520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). However, hSK2 also possesses two additional polypeptide regions at its N terminus and within the central region of its sequence that are quite distinct from hSK1.Although hSK1 has considerable intrinsic catalytic activity (11Pitson S.M. D'Andrea R.J. Vandeleur L. Moretti P.A.B. Xia P. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 429-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), its activity can be enhanced by exposure of cells to various growth factors and other agonists (6Maceyka M. Payne S.G. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). This agonist-induced activation of hSK1 results in an increase in cellular levels of S1P, which appears critical in mediating the cellular effects attributed to S1P (12Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A.B.

We have recently identified that activation of hSK1 occurs directly via its phosphorylation at Ser225 by ERK1/2 (13Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A.B. Zebol J.R. Lynn H.E. Xia P. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5491-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). We have also observed that this phosphorylation and, in particular, the subsequent phosphorylation-dependent translocation of hSK1 to the plasma membrane are critical steps for the pro-proliferative, anti-apoptotic effects of this enzyme in the cell (14Pitson S.M.

Thus, considerable insight into the regulation of hSK1 has been recently gained. However, much is still not known regarding the exact molecular mechanisms controlling the activation and cellular localization of this enzyme.Numerous studies have shown that both human and mouse SK1 associate with calmodulin (CaM) in a Ca2+-dependent manner (11Pitson S.M.

Means A.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 322-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar), its potential role in the regulation of hSK1 has long been speculated (11Pitson S.M.

Although we have shown previously that neither Ca2+-bound nor Ca2+-free CaM (Ca2+/CaM and apoCaM, respectively) had an effect on hSK1 activity in vitro (11Pitson S.M. D'Andrea R.J. Vandeleur L. Moretti P.A.B. Xia P. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 429-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), other studies have suggested it may play a role in Ca2+-dependent translocation of hSK1 to the plasma membrane because this process is inhibited by the Ca2+/CaM antagonist W-7 (22Young K.W. Willets J.M. Parkinson M.J. Bartlett P. Spiegel S. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A.J. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Further elucidation of the direct role of CaM in the regulation of hSK1 has, however, been limited by the lack of molecular tools to specifically ablate CaM binding to hSK1. In this study we have identified the CaM-binding sites of hSK1 and hSK2. This has enabled the generation of CaM-binding-deficient versions of the proteins and allowed further molecular examination of the role of CaM in sphingosine kinase regulation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) containing 10% bovine calf serum (JRH Biosciences), 2 mm glutamine, 0.2% (w/v) sodium bicarbonate, penicillin (1.2 mg/ml), and streptomycin (1.6 mg/ml).

Wild type hSK2 and hSK2V327A/L328Q were amplified with 5′-TAGAATTCATGGCCCCGCCCCCA-3′ and 5′-TAGAATTCAGGGCTCCCGCCCCG-3′ primers, digested with EcoRI, and cloned into pcDNA3-EGFP. The orientation was determined by restriction analysis, with sequencing verifying the integrity of the EGFP-hSK2 cDNA sequences. hSK1hSK2-CBS and hSK2hSK1-CBS were generated from hSK1 and hSK2 cDNAs in pcDNA3 by QuikChange mutagenesis using the primers 5′-AGTGAGAAGTATCGGGCCCTGGGATCCGCGCGCTTCACTCTGGG-3′, 5′-CCCAGAGTGAAGCGCGCGGATCCCAGGGCCCGATACTTCTCACT-3′,5′-TTCACTCTGGGCACTGTCCTAGGTCTGGCAACCTTGCACACTTACCGCGGCCG-3′, and 5′-CGGCCGCGGTAAGTGTGCAAGGTTGCCAGACCTAGGACAGTGCCCAGAGTGAA-3′ for hSK1hSK2-CBS and 5′-GAGCGAGCGCTTCAGACGTCTGGGCGAGATGCGCTTCACACTGGGC-3′, 5′-GCCCAGTGTGAAGCGCATCTCGCCCAGACGTCTGAAGCGCTCGCTC-3′, 5′-TTCACACTGGGCACGTTTCTGCGACTCGCCGCACTACGTACCTACCGCGGACGC-3′, and 5′-GCGTCCGCGGTAGGTACGTAGTGCGGCGAGTCGCAGAAACGTGCCCAGTGTGAA-3′ for hSK2hSK1-CBS.Sphingosine Kinase Assays—Sphingosine kinase activity was routinely determined using d-erythro-sphingosine (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) and [γ-32P]ATP as substrates as described previously (10Roberts J.L.

A unit of sphingosine kinase activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to produce 1 pmol of S1P/min.Mass Measurement of S1P—Measurement of cellular S1P levels were performed using the enzymatic method described by Edsall et al.

Briefly, HEK293T cells overexpressing wild type or mutant hSK1 or hSK2 were harvested and lysed as described above. The cell lysates were then centrifuged (13,000 × g, 15 min at 4 °C) to remove cell debris. Aliquots of the supernatants were added to tubes containing CaM-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with binding buffer composed of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 mm Na3VO4, 7.5 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors (Complete™, Roche Applied Science) and incubated with either 5 mm CaCl2 or5mm EGTA for 30 min at 4 °C with continuous mixing. The CaM-Sepharose 4B beads were then pelleted by centrifugation (5000 × g, 5 min at 4 °C) and washed twice with binding buffer. Bound hSK1 or hSK2 was then resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Western blotting via the FLAG epitope. Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences) was used as a control for nonspecific binding to CaM-Sepharose 4B.For studies to elucidate the role of hSK1 phosphorylation on its association with CaM, purified recombinant hSK1 generated in E. coli was phosphorylated in vitro at Ser225 by ERK2 as described previously (13Pitson S.M.

The products were subsequently digested with EcoRI and cloned into pGEX2T. Cultures of Escherichia coli JM109 transformed with these pGEX2T-PCB plasmids were grown overnight in Luria broth containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin at 37 °C with shaking. The cultures were then diluted 1 in 10 into the same medium and grown at 37 °C for 1 h with shaking until reaching an A600 of ∼0.6. Expression of the GST-PCB peptides was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the cultures were incubated for an additional 3 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and lysed by sonication (3 times, 30-s pulses of 5 watts) in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors. Following clarification of the lysate by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with constant agitation. After this time the glutathione-Sepharose was washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the GST peptides were eluted with 20 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, for 10 min at 4 °C. Pull-down analyses with CaM-Sepharose and the GST peptide fusion proteins was performed as described above using ∼1 μg of each purified GST peptide or GST alone. Peptide binding to CaM-Sepharose was detected using an anti-GST antibody.Limited Proteolysis and N-terminal Sequencing—Recombinant hSK1 was generated and purified from Sf9 cells as described previously (17Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A.B. Zebol J.R. Zareie R. Derian C.K. Darrow A.L. Qi J. D'Andrea R.J. Bagley C.J. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. J. Biol.

Limited proteolysis of this hSK1 (1.5 μg in 15 μl) was performed in the presence or absence of a 3-fold molar excess of purified bovine CaM (Sigma) by the addition of 2 or 5 ng of trypsin (Roche Applied Science) in 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5. The mixture was then incubated at 37 °C for 60 min, stopped by the addition of 1.5 μl of 100 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Roche Applied Science), and incubated for an additional 5 min at 37 °C. Tryptic cleavage products were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Following Coomassie staining of the membrane, bands that were protected in the presence of CaM were excised, and their N-terminal sequences were determined by 6 cycles of automated Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems 494 Procise Protein Sequencing System at the Australian Proteome Analysis Facility.Western Blotting—SDS-PAGE was performed on cell lysates using 12% acrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and the membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% skim milk powder and 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100. hSK1 expression levels in cell lysates were quantitated over a dilution series of the lysates with the monoclonal M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), with the immunocomplexes detected with horseradish peroxidase anti-mouse (Pierce) IgG using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences).Fluorescence Microscopy and Subcellular Fractionation—HEK293T cells expressing EGFP fusion proteins were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated (Sigma) 8-well glass chamber slides and incubated for 24 h. Following incubation for 30 min with or without PMA, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. Epifluorescence microscopy was then performed on an Olympus BX-51 microscope equipped with a fluorescein excitation filter (494 nm), acquired to a Cool Snap FX charge-coupled device camera (Photometrics). COS-7 cells expressing EGFP fusion proteins were analyzed in a similar manner, except instead of PMA treatment, the effect of cell density on hSK2 cellular localization was determined by plating the cells at a wide range of cell densities. Cell lysates were fractionated into cytosol and membrane fractions as described previously (13Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A.B. Zebol J.R. Lynn H.E. Xia P. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W.

Previous analysis of the hSK1 polypeptide sequence indicated the presence of three potential Ca2+/CaM binding regions (11Pitson S.M. D'Andrea R.J. Vandeleur L. Moretti P.A.B. Xia P. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 429-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) as follows: two that overlap between residues 134 and 153 (termed here PCB1 and PCB2), and one spanning residues 290-303 (PCB4) (Fig. 1). All three of these putative Ca2+/CaM-binding sites are conserved in the mouse SK1 sequence (27Kohama T. Olivera A. Edsall L. Nagiec M.M. Dickson R. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23722-23728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Further analysis of the hSK1 polypeptide sequence using the CaM target data base (26Yap K.L. Kim J. Truong K. Sherman M. Yuan T. Ikura M. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2000; 1: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) also revealed another putative Ca2+/CaM-binding site spanning residues 191-206 (PCB3) (Fig. 1). Again, this putative Ca2+/CaM binding region is also conserved in murine SK1.To examine the potential role of the putative Ca2+/CaM-binding sites in the interaction of hSK1 with CaM, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of hSK1 in these regions. In particular, this mutagenesis concentrated on the conserved hydrophobic residues within these motifs that are generally critical in Ca2+/CaM binding (28Crivici A. Ikura M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 29Vetter S.W. Leclerc E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 404-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 30Bhattacharya S. Bunick C.G. Chazin W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1742: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), changing them to structurally conservative hydrophilic residues. PCB1 and PCB2 were targeted by a mutations of Leu147 → Gln (hSK1L147Q) and Leu153 → Gln (hSK1L153Q), respectively. PCB3 was targeted by mutations of Leu187 → Gln (hSK1L187Q) and Leu200 → Gln (hSK1L200Q), and PCB4 was targeted by a Phe303 → His mutation (hSK1F303H). These versions of hSK1 were then expressed in HEK293T cells and analyzed for both their ability to bind CaM-Sepharose and their catalytic activity, as a measure of retained gross protein folding. Although these hSK1 mutants all retained at least some catalytic activity (Fig. 2B), somewhat surprisingly, all five bound Ca2+/CaM with similar efficiency to wild type hSK1 (Fig. 2A). This suggested that these predicted Ca2+/CaM binding regions of hSK1 may not be involved in CaM binding. Unfortunately, further mutagenesis of other conserved hydrophobic residues within these putative Ca2+/CaM binding regions (i.e. Leu134 → Gln and Val290 → Asn) yielded catalytically inactive hSK1 proteins (Fig. 2B) that were therefore not further analyzed because of the likelihood that the mutations caused disruption to the gross folding of these proteins.FIGURE 2Site-directed mutagenesis of predicted CaM binding regions of hSK1. A, selective binding of the hSK1 mutants to CaM-Sepharose (CaM) was examined using extracts from HEK293T cells expressing the various hSK1 mutants (Load). Bound hSK1 proteins were visualized by Western blotting via their FLAG epitope. Binding to Sepharose CL-4B (CL4B) was used as a control to account for any nonspecific binding to the CaM-Sepharose beads. B, relative catalytic activity of the hSK1 mutants.

This was initially performed using limited proteolysis of purified recombinant hSK1 and identifying cleavage sites in hSK1 that were protected by the presence of Ca2+/CaM. Such an approach has been used previously to identify the CaM-binding sites of other proteins (31Moore C.P. Rodney G. Zhang J. Santacruz-Toloza L. Strasburg G. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8532-8537Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 32Zhang H. Zhang J. Danila C.I. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8348-8355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Limited proteolysis of purified recombinant hSK1 with trypsin generated several detectable cleavage products ranging in size from ∼9 to 32 kDa (Fig. 3A). Inclusion of Ca2+/CaM during this limited proteolysis, however, resulted in the loss of a number of hSK1-derived products in the 17-22-kDa range and the accumulation of larger hSK1-derived polypeptides (Fig. 3A). The two most notable polypeptides not generated during limited proteolysis in the presence of Ca2+/CaM had approximate molecular masses of 21 and 22 kDa (Fig. 3A). These polypeptides represented C-terminal fragments of hSK1 because they retained the His tag that resides at this end of the intact recombinant hSK1 (Fig. 3B), and they were presumably not generated because of the presence of bound Ca2+/CaM in close proximity to at least two tryptic cleavage sites within the central region of hSK1."
https://openalex.org/W1999743335,"Transglutaminase type 2 (TG2; also known as Gh) is a multifunctional protein involved in diverse cellular processes. It has two well characterized enzyme activities: receptor-stimulated signaling that requires GTP binding and calcium-activated transamidation or cross-linking that is inhibited by GTP. In addition to the GDP binding residues identified from the human TG2 crystal structure (Liu, S., Cerione, R. A., and Clardy, J. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 99, 2743-2747), we have previously implicated Ser171 in GTP binding, as binding is lost with glutamate substitution (Iismaa, S. E., Wu, M.-J., Nanda, N., Church, W. B., and Graham, R. M. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 18259-18265). Here, we have shown that alanine substitution of homologous residues in rat TG2 (Phe174 in the core domain or Arg476, Arg478, or Arg579 in barrel 1) does not affect TG activity but reduces or abolishes GTP binding and GTPγS inhibition of TG activity in vitro, indicating that these residues are important in GTP binding. Alanine substitution of Ser171 does not impair GTP binding, indicating this residue does not interact directly with GTP. Arg579 is particularly important for GTP binding, as isothermal titration calorimetry demonstrated a 100-fold reduction in GTP binding affinity by the R579A mutant. Unlike wild-type TG2 or its S171E or F174A mutants, which are sensitive to both trypsin and μ-calpain digestion, R579A is inherently more resistant to μ-calpain, but not trypsin, digestion, indicating reduced accessibility and/or flexibility of this mutant in the region of the calpain cleavage site(s). Basal TG activity of intact R579A stable SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell transfectants was slightly increased relative to wild-type transfectants and, in contrast to the TG activity of the latter, was further stimulated by muscarinic receptor-activated calcium mobilization. Thus, loss of GTP binding sensitizes TG2 to intracellular calcium concentrations. These findings are consistent with the notion that intracellularly, under physiological conditions, TG2 is maintained largely as a latent enzyme, its calcium-activated cross-linking activity being suppressed allosterically by guanine nucleotide binding.

Transglutaminase type 2 (TG2), 2The abbreviations used are: TG, transglutaminase; WT, wild type; DTT, dithiothreitol. 2The abbreviations used are: TG, transglutaminase; WT, wild type; DTT, dithiothreitol. also known as tissue transglutaminase or Gh (high molecular weight GTP-binding protein), is a multifunctional protein that is involved in diverse physiological processes, including apoptosis, bone ossification, wound repair, cell adhesion, and signal transduction and in the pathophysiology of various diseases, including gluten-induced enteropathy (celiac disease), neurodegenerative disorders, tumor growth, and diabetes (1Lorand L. Graham R.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 140-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). It is constitutively expressed by fibroblasts and endothelial and smooth muscle cells as well as a number of organ-specific cell types (2Thomazy V. Fésüs L. Cell Tissue Res. 1989; 255: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). At the subcellular level, it is found in the cytosol in association with plasma and nuclear membranes and is also found attached to the extracellular matrix (1Lorand L. Graham R.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 140-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar).TG2 has at least five distinct biological activities. It is a member of the transglutaminase family of cross-linking enzymes that catalyze post-translational covalent linkages, the best studied of which is transamidation. Transamidation results in either a protein cross-link between a glutamine and lysine residue to form an Nϵ-(γ-glutamyl) isopeptide bond, incorporation of an amine into a glutamine residue, or acylation of a lysine residue. TG2 also binds and hydrolyzes GTP (3Achyuthan K.E. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1901-1906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Im M.-J. Riek R.P. Graham R.M. J. Biol.

Additionally, TG2 can act as an adaptor protein that facilitates extracellular interaction between fibronectin and β1/3-integrins (11Akimov S.S. Belkin A.M. J.

Calcium activates TG activity, and GTP inhibits TG activity at subsaturating calcium concentrations (3Achyuthan K.E. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol.

In the presence of physiological intracellular concentrations of calcium and GTP, it has been suggested that TG2 exists largely as a latent transamidase (16Bergamini C.M.

Hausladen A. Slaughter T.F. Eu J.P. Stamler J.S. Greenberg C.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4904-4910Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In contrast, sphingosylphosphocholine, a relatively minor membrane phospholipid component that is increased in cells undergoing apoptosis, increases the sensitivity of TG2 to calcium (20Lai T.-S.

In pathological states, when cells become leaky to calcium and GTP generation is impaired, the TG activity of TG2 contributes to programmed cell death events, such as apoptotic body stabilization (17Smethurst P.A.

Dysregulation of the activities of TG2, therefore, could potentially have catastrophic cellular consequences due, for example, to unrestrained protein cross-linking and activation of pro-apoptotic pathways.Of the nine distinct, but closely related, members of the TG family (TG 1-7, Factor XIIIA and Band 4.2), only TG2, 3, (22Ahvazi B.

Recent crystallographic studies have revealed the tertiary structure of the inactive form of human TG2 bound to GDP (24Liu S. Cerione R.A. Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2743-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), which, like all other members of the TG family, is comprised of four domains: an N-terminal sandwich domain, a core domain that contains the TG active site catalytic triad (Cys277, His335, and Asp358) and transition state stabilizing residue (Trp241) (25Iismaa S. Holman S. Wouters M.A. Lorand L. Graham R.M. Husain A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12636-12641Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and two β-barrel domains (Fig. 1A). The GDP-binding site of TG2 is located in a hydrophobic pocket between the core and β-barrel 1, on the opposite face to the proposed glutamyl substrate-binding site (24Liu S. Cerione R.A. Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2743-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). It has a unique architecture that, although conserved in TG3 (22Ahvazi B. Boeshans K.M. Idler W. Baxa U. Steinert P.M. Rastinejad F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7180-7192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), is entirely distinct from that of other GTP-binding proteins and involves mainly residues from β-barrel 1 (amino acids 476-482 and 580-583) and Phe174 from the core. This is in agreement with our previous work, which localized GTP binding to residues 159-173 of the core and residues 465-589 of β-barrel 1 and additionally showed impaired GTP binding and hydrolysis by site-directed mutants of Lys173 (26Iismaa S.E. Wu M.-J. Nanda N. Church W.B. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18259-18265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Although not contained within the GDP binding pocket delineated by the crystal structure, our previous studies also implicated Ser171in GTP binding, because such binding was lost with the substitution of this residue by a glutamate, the homologous residue in a non-GTP binding member of the mammalian TG family, fXIIIA (26Iismaa S.E. Wu M.-J. Nanda N. Church W.B. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18259-18265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).The present study shows that several key residues of TG2 implicated in GDP binding in the crystal structure are indeed important for guanine nucleotide binding, because mutation reduces or abolishes GTP binding as well as GTPγS inhibition of TG activity in vitro. Ser171 does not interact directly with GTP, because nucleotide binding is unaltered with alanine substitution. Among the GTP binding residues, we have identified a particularly important residue, Arg579 in rat TG2 (equivalent to Arg580 in human TG2). Mutation of this residue to alanine not only renders it resistant to cleavage by the intracellular calcium-activated protease, μ-calpain, but also abolishes GTP regulation of TG activity in intact cells, resulting in dysregulated intracellular TG activity. This study, therefore, has provided the first physiological confirmation that the intracellular TG activity of TG2 is regulated by GTP.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstructs, Cell Culture, and Transfection of Cells—Site-directed mutants were constructed in rat TG2 cDNA as described (27Murthy S.N.

Protein expression was induced overnight (30 °C, 50 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside). Cells were sonicated in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 5 μg/ml of leupeptin, 5 μg/ml of aprotinin, 1 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml of pepstatin A, 0.15 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)). TG2 proteins were purified from the soluble fraction by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. TG2 proteins were liberated from the resin-bound glutathione S-transferase moiety by thrombin (Sigma) cleavage for 2 h at 25°C in the absence of calcium; digestion was stopped by addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 0.15 mm (26Iismaa S.E. Wu M.-J. Nanda N. Church W.B. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18259-18265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Eluted TG2 proteins were purified using a MonoQ 5/5 anion exchange column (27Murthy S.N. Iismaa S.E. Begg G. Freymann D.M. Graham R.M. Lorand L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2738-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.15 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm DTT). TG2 proteins were eluted at 0.5 ml/min with a 15-ml linear gradient of buffer A versus 60% buffer B (buffer A with 1 m NaCl). Protein concentration was determined by a modification of the Bradford method (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar) using the commercial Coomassie Blue Plus protein assay reagent (Pierce) and wild-type TG2 (quantitated by amino acid analysis) as the standard. Proteins were aliquotted and stored at -80 °C. Human protein was purified as described (24Liu S. Cerione R.A. Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2743-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar).Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Samples of purified WT and mutant TG2 were prepared by dialysis against high magnesium buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT) for 16 h at room temperature, followed by exhaustive dialysis at 4 °C against isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT). GTPγS (Roche Applied Science) was dissolved in ITC dialysis buffer, and the concentration was checked by absorbance at 256 nm (ϵ = 1.241 × 104 m-1). ITC experiments were carried out at 25 °C on a Microcal VP-ITC. Solutions were de-gassed for 5 min using a vacuum degasser immediately prior to experiments. GTPγS was injected into TG2 samples at the following concentrations: 100 μm GTPγS into 13.5 μm WT TG2, 90 μm GTPγS into 22.3 μm F174A TG2, 500 μm GTPγS into 17.9 μm R579A TG2. The injection sequence consisted of an initial injection of 1 μl followed by 20-30 sequential injections of 7-8 μl. Blank runs were also performed in which TG2 was omitted. Base-line-subtracted data were fitted by a single-site model using Origin ITC Analysis software (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA). Data for R579A TG2 were weaker and fitted with fixed stoichiometries (n = 0.3-1), and an average estimated Kd from these fits is presented.GTP Photolabeling—Recombinant WT or mutant TG2 (1.3 μm) was incubated with 67 nm [α-32P]GTP (30 °C, 10 min, final volume 20 μl) in 20 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm 5′-adenyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate, 5% glycerol, photolabeled by UV irradiation (254 nm, 2 min, ice water bath), incubated with SDS sample buffer (100 °C, 5 min), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Gels were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining followed by autoradiography.Immunoblotting—TG2 expression level was evaluated by Western blotting, using either anti-TG2 monoclonal antibody CUB 7402 (Neomarkers; 1:500 dilution in Tris-buffered saline/5% skim milk for 1 h at room temperature) or anti-human TG2 polyclonal antibody (generated in-house).Transamidase Assays—Purified proteins (10 nm WT or mutant TG2) or stable transfectant lysates (15 μg) were assayed for TG activity (26Iismaa S.E. Wu M.-J. Nanda N. Church W.B. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18259-18265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). TG activity in intact cells was determined via incorporation of biotinylated amine (5-(biotinamido)pentylamine) into intracellular proteins. Stably transfected SH-SY5Y cells were cultured for 72 h on 10-cm plates in RPMI medium containing 3% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 μg/ml of G-418. Plates were washed once with serum-free RPMI, preincubated for 2 h at 37°C/5% in 3 ml of RPMI containing 1% serum, glutamine, G-418, 2 mm 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine (prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), and stimulated for 90 min with 0, 0.1, or 0.25 mm carbachol or for 60 min with 0, 0.1, or 0.25 μm A23187. Cells were harvested and sonicated. Crude cell lysates (5 μg) were quantitated for TG activity by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (18Zhang J. Lesort M. Guttmann R.P. Johnson G.V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2288-2295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and TG expression by immunoblotting.Measurement of Intracellular Calcium—Cell monolayers were washed once with Krebs/HEPES buffer (KHB; 118 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 5 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), harvested in 25 ml KHB, and centrifuged (3 min, 180 × g). Cells were resuspended in 5 ml of KHB with 1 μm FURA 2-AM, incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, centrifuged (3 min, 180 × g), washed twice in 5 ml of KHB, and resuspended to 1 × 106 cells/ml in KHB. A 2-ml aliquot of cells was placed in a cuvette, and carbachol was added to 0.25 mm. Fura 2 fluorescence was monitored at 505 nm after excitation at 340 nm. Calibration of Ca2+ was performed after cell lysis (0.04% (v/v) Triton X-100) by determining minimal and maximal fluorescence in the presence of EGTA (10 mm) or CaCl2 (7.6 mm), respectively. Base-line, peak, and plateau values for [Ca2+] were calculated as described (31Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).Data Analysis—Results shown are the means ± S.E. Statistical differences were determined by analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's post-test, with p ≤ 0.05 being considered significant.RESULTSMutation of GDP-binding Site Residues Affects GTP Binding—We mutated some of the key GDP-binding site residues (Phe174, Arg476, Arg478, and Arg579) as well as Ser171 in rat TG2 (Fig. 1A) and tested their ability to bind GTP. Phe174 in the core domain forms part of a hydrophobic pocket around the guanine base, where it is thought to stabilize one side of the guanine ring through an aromatic stacking interaction (24Liu S. Cerione R.A. Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2743-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In agreement with this interpretation, removal of the phenylalanine side chain by substitution with alanine abolished [α-32P]GTP photolabeling, a qualitative measure of GTP binding, whereas tryptophan substitution retained wild-type binding (Fig. 1B). In β-barrel 1, Arg580, one of four positively charged residues surrounding the phosphate groups of GDP in the crystal structure, forms two ion pairs with the α- and β-phosphates of GDP, as well as interacting with the guanine base (24Liu S. Cerione R.A. Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2743-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Mutation of Arg579 of rat TG2 (equivalent to human Arg580) to alanine abolished [α-32P]GTP photolabeling, as did a more conservative mutation to lysine (the homologous residue in the GTP binding TG member, TG5 (23Candi E. Paradisi A. Terrinoni A. Pietroni V. Oddi S. Cadot B. Jogini V. Meiyappan M. Clardy J. Finazzi-Agro A. Melino G. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)), which retains the charge and much of the bulk of the arginine side chain. This confirms the importance of the arginine residue for nucleotide binding. In contrast, substitution of alanine for Arg478, which interacts with the β-phosphate, reduced but did not abolish [α-32P]GTP photolabeling. Similarly, alanine substitution of Arg476 (Fig. 1B) or leucine substitution of Lys173 (26Iismaa S.E. Wu M.-J. Nanda N. Church W.B. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18259-18265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), residues postulated to stabilize the γ-phosphate of GTP during binding and hydrolysis (24Liu S. Cerione R.A. Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2743-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), caused only a minor reduction in GTP photolabeling. The double mutant R476A/R478A photolabeled similarly to R478A alone. Although glutamate substitution of Ser171 prevents GTP binding (26Iismaa S.E. Wu M.-J. Nanda N. Church W.B. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18259-18265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), alanine substitution at the same position had no effect on GTP photolabeling, indicating Ser171 does not interact directly with GTP. Taken together, these results indicate that residues interacting only with phosphate groups contribute less to guanine-nucleotide binding than residues interacting with the guanine base.Isothermal titration calorimetry was used to quantitate the GTP binding affinities of the F174A and R579A mutants relative to that of WT TG2, as both of the mutants showed significant loss of GTP binding by photolabeling. Although it has been shown that TG2 binds GTP with a 1:1 stoichiometry (32Bergamini C.M. Signorini M. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 37-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the best fit to our initial calorimetry data gave a stoichiometry value of around 0.1 for GTP binding to both WT and F174A, indicating that only ∼10% of the protein was available to bind nucleotide. Native gel electrophoresis showed that almost all of the samples migrated in the faster GTP-bound form, as previously demonstrated (27Murthy S.N. Iismaa S.E. Begg G. Freymann D.M. Graham R.M. Lorand L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2738-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), indicating that the proteins were competent to bind GTP and that most of the protein was already nucleotide bound. Attempts to strip nucleotide from the proteins by dialysis against 2.5 m KCl (33Murthy S.N. Lomasney J.W. Mak E.C. Lorand L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11815-11819Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) resulted in the appearance of high molecular weight bands on native gels indicating aggregation, and less than 5% of the protein was available to bind GTP. As we have shown previously that TG2 binds less GTP in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2 (26Iismaa S.E. Wu M.-J. Nanda N. Church W.B. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18259-18265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), samples were dialysed against a buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2 prior to exchange into ITC buffer (as described under “Experimental Procedures”), resulting in ∼30% of the protein being available to bind GTP, and better quality data were obtained. WT TG2 bound GTPγS with a Kd of 1.6 μm, whereas the affinities of F174A (Kd, 2.9 μm) and R579A (Kd, 150 μm) for GTPγS were around 2- and 100-fold weaker, respectively (Fig. 1C). These dissociation constants were very similar to those obtained initially without magnesium pretreatment.In Vitro Inhibition of TG Activity by GTP Correlates with GTP Binding Affinity—All mutants exhibited dose-dependent Ca2+-stimulated TG activity comparable with WT (Fig. 2A and Table 1), indicating that the proteins were correctly folded and that their TG activity was not compromised by the mutation(s). GTP inhibition of TG2 activity is inversely proportional to Ca2+ activation and is greatest under conditions where TG activity is minimal (26Iismaa S.E. Wu M.-J. Nanda N. Church W.B. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18259-18265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). GTPγS inhibition of TG activity was evaluated in the presence of 75-125 μm free Ca2+ (which stimulates ∼40% of maximal activity; Fig. 2, B and C). Under these conditions, GTPγS inhibited the TG activity of WT TG2 with an IC50 of 27 μm. The TG activity of R476A and R478A was less sensitive to GTPγS inhibition than WT (Fig. 2B), yielding IC50 values >350 μm (R476A) and 450 μm (R478A). The TG activity of R476A/R478A was not measurably inhibited by GTPγS (Fig. 2B;IC50 >500 μm), indicating that mutation of both arginines further reduced GTP binding. The TG activities of the S171E (26Iismaa S.E. Wu M.-J. Nanda N. Church W.B. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18259-18265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), F174A, and R579A mutants were insensitive to GTPγS inhibition (Fig. 2C). Thus, loss of GTP inhibition of TG activity correlated with the degree of [α-32P]GTP photolabeling of the mutants (Fig. 1B).FIGURE 2Calcium activation and GTPγS inhibition of in vitro TG activity of WT and mutant TG2 proteins. A, Ca2+ activation of the TG activity of WT and mutant proteins (10 nm) was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data for each protein are presented as a percentage of maximal TG activity (at 3.4 mm free calcium); specific maximal TG activities (expressed as pmol 3H putrescine incorporated/min/pmol TG2) were WT (37Antonyak M.A. Singh U.S. Lee D.A.

B and C, GTPγS inhibition of TG activity was assayed at ∼40% maximal TG activity (symbols as in panel A). Activities as a percentage of maximal activity were 36% for WT, 43% for R478A, and 49% for R579A at 75 μm free Ca2+; 48% for R476A, 47% for R476A/R478A, and 40% for F174A at 98 μm free Ca2+; and 49% for S171E at 124 μm free Ca2+.

These two activities have competing effects on the response of the network to galactose such that the transport effects of Gal1p are dominant at low galactose concentrations, whereas its catabolic effects are dominant at high galactose concentrations. In addition, flow cytometry analysis revealed the unexpected phenomenon of multiple populations in the gal1Δ strains, which were not present in the isogenic GAL1 background.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae inducible promoter systems have long been used for expression of heterologous proteins, gene function studies, and other areas of molecular genetics. Native inducible promoters such as GAL1 (1Funk M. Niedenthal R. Mumberg D. Brinkmann K. Ronicke V. Henkel T. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), MET25 (2Solow S.P. Sengbusch J. Laird M.W. Biotechnol. Prog. 2005; 21: 617-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and CUP1 (3Koller A. Valesco J. Subramani S. Yeast. 2000; 16: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 4Mascorro-Gallardo J.O. Covarrubias A.A. Gaxiola R. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 172: 169-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), although used successfully without modification, exhibit certain properties that are undesirable for many applications. One common feature of these systems is their autocatalytic or switch-like behavior, in which the addition of small amounts of inducer leads to large increases in gene expression. In prokaryotes and bacteriophages, this is generally due to cooperative interactions between transcription factors and promoter elements. In more complex eukaryotic networks, other elements such as feedback loops (5Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1998; 280: 852-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), zero-order sensitivity (5Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1998; 280: 852-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), multistep signaling mechanisms (5Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1998; 280: 852-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and nucleocytoplasmic transport of regulatory proteins (6Verma M. Bhat P.J. Venkatesh K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48764-48769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) often contribute to nonlinear responses. In addition, native inducible promoter systems are often characterized by an all-or-none effect, in which genes are either maximally expressed or virtually not expressed in individual cells (7Louis M. Becskei A. Sci. STKE. 2002; 2002: PE33PubMed Google Scholar). In such cases, the observed population-averaged response upon the addition of inducer is due to an increase in the probability that a given cell will become fully induced. In contrast are systems that enable a homogenous cell population response and intermediate levels of gene expression in all cells proportional to the given stimulus (7Louis M. Becskei A. Sci. STKE. 2002; 2002: PE33PubMed Google Scholar); however, examples of this are relatively rare in eukaryotic systems. The widely used GAL promoter system is taken from an endogenous metabolic network regulating expression of a number of structural and regulatory genes required for efficient utilization of galactose as a primary carbon source (Fig. 1A). This complex and tightly controlled network has served as a paradigm for gene regulatory circuits in eukaryotic organisms. In noninducing-nonrepressing media, the Gal4p transcriptional activator binds as a dimer to recognition sites upstream of each galactose-regulated gene referred to as upstream activation sites (UASs). 2The abbreviations used are: UAS, upstream activation site; GFP, green fluorescent protein; yEGFP, yeast enhanced green fluorescent protein. An inhibitory protein Gal80p dimerizes and binds to nuclear Gal4p in the absence of galactose, preventing recruitment of activator proteins by Gal4p and effectively repressing gene expression. In the presence of inducer, Gal3p becomes activated and gains affinity for Gal80p, thereby reducing the amount of Gal80p bound to Gal4p and permitting transcription from GAL promoter elements. Gal3p is an exclusively cytoplasmic protein, whereas Gal80p continuously shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm and becomes sequestered in the cytoplasm when bound to activated Gal3p (8Peng G. Hopper J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8548-8553Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In the presence of glucose, the same genes are rapidly and fully repressed by multiple mechanisms; the intracellular galactose concentration is reduced via transcriptional repression and catabolite inactivation of Gal2p (9Horak J. Wolf D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1541-1549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the Mig1p repressor inhibits both the transcription and the activity of Gal4p (10Lamphier M.S. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5922-5926Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11Nehlin J.O. Carlberg M. Ronne H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3373-3377Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The inducer molecule galactose is transported across the cell membrane by both a facilitated diffusion mechanism and a galactose permease protein Gal2p, which has both a high affinity and a low affinity galactose transport mechanism (12Ramos J. Szkutnicka K. Cirillo V.P. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3539-3544Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Galactose is utilized as a sugar source by the cell through an initial conversion step catalyzed by a galactokinase Gal1p (13Schell M.A. Wilson D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1162-1166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The levels of Gal2p, Gal3p, and Gal80p are regulated by GAL promoters, thereby forming three nested feedback control loops (Fig. 1B) (14Acar M. Becskei A. van Oudenaarden A. Nature. 2005; 435: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). A number of other structural and regulatory proteins are under the control of GAL promoters with either one or two UASs. The nature of the autocatalytic response of the GAL genetic switch has been a topic of considerable research. Recent modeling work implicates the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Gal80p and the feedback response of the regulatory proteins Gal3p and Gal80p as being critical to both the dynamic and the steady-state performance of this system, and in particular, the ultrasensitive response of the GAL induction curve (6Verma M. Bhat P.J. Venkatesh K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48764-48769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15Ruhela A. Verma M. Edwards J.S. Bhat P.J. Bhartiya S. Venkatesh K.V. FEBS Lett. 2004; 576: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Modeling has also indicated that the switch is only functional if Gal80p and Gal3p are subject to the same regulation (6Verma M. Bhat P.J. Venkatesh K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48764-48769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Prior work has demonstrated that the response properties of the system are highly sensitive to relative levels of Gal4p, Gal80p, and Gal3p (16Venkatesh K.V. Bhat P.J. Kumar R.A. Doshi P. Biotechnol. Prog. 1999; 15: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The Gal2p galactose permease promoter region contains two UASs, whereas the promoter regions for Gal80p and Gal3p contain one UAS. Genes with multiple UASs are more tightly controlled by galactose, demonstrating lower basal expression and higher maximal induction; however, the effects of the permease feedback loop and transporter levels on the response of the network to varying galactose concentrations have not been examined. Recent efforts have demonstrated that the response properties of inducible promoter systems can be altered by engineering interactions between components of the network. For example, several groups have altered the network connectivity of the arabinose metabolic network to exhibit a more tunable, homogenous response from arabinose-inducible promoter systems in Escherichia coli as opposed to its native, all-or-none response (17Khlebnikov A. Datsenko K.A. Skaug T. Wanner B.L. Keasling J.D. Microbiology (N. Y.). 2001; 147: 3241-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 18Morgan-Kiss R.M. Wadler C. Cronan Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7373-7377Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This tunable promoter system was designed by altering the regulation of the arabinose transporter gene from autocatalytic control to constitutive or researcher-controlled systems that resulted in a more linear induction response (17Khlebnikov A. Datsenko K.A. Skaug T. Wanner B.L. Keasling J.D. Microbiology (N. Y.). 2001; 147: 3241-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In another recent study, the feedback loops of Gal3p and Gal80p were implicated in the memory response of the GAL network to growth history in S. cerevisiae (14Acar M. Becskei A. van Oudenaarden A. Nature. 2005; 435: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Although numerous factors certainly play critical roles in regulating the response behavior of the galactose network as described above, it is possible that the genetic switch response of the network may be altered by removing the positive feedback control loop regulating galactose transport mediated by the Gal2p permease. This work demonstrates that removing the positive feedback control loop regulating Gal2p expression is sufficient to alter the autocatalytic nature of this network such that the GAL promoter responds in a more linear manner to changes in galactose levels. Although complete removal of the permease enables a population-averaged linear response from the GAL promoter, constitutive expression of the permease largely maintains the linear response and increases the overall magnitude of the response at a particular galactose concentration. Identical modifications to the promoter regions of the regulatory proteins Gal3p and Gal80p did not have the same effect, indicating that the feedback loop around Gal2p is unique in its ability to affect this linear versus switch-like response. The Gal2p-modified network also alters the population distribution to a more homogenous and gradual response at the single cell level. In addition, deletion of the galactokinase Gal1p from this network has varying effects dependent on strain background and galactose concentrations due to its dual roles in catabolism and transport. At low galactose concentrations, transport effects dominate such that the network response is more linear when compared with the wild type, whereas at higher galactose concentrations, catabolic effects dominate such that the network response is amplified. Finally, our studies indicate that Gal1p may play a role in network stability as its removal results in the formation of multiple steady-state populations independent of strain background. Yeast Strain Construction—The wild-type haploid yeast strain used in this study is W303α (MATa his3-11,15 trp1-1 leu2-3 ura3-1 ade2-1). All other strains were constructed by making modifications to the chromosome of this wild-type strain through standard homologous recombination procedures (Table 1) (19Johnston M. Riles L. Hegemann J.H. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 194: 290-315Google Scholar). For each strain, an insertion cassette was constructed with the appropriate insertion sequences and regions of homology to the desired targeted sites on the chromosome. A cassette harboring an E. coli kanamycin resistance gene and associated promoter and terminator elements with ends homologous to regions flanking GAL2 on the chromosome was constructed by amplifying the appropriate segment from pFA6a-ZZ-TEV-S-kanMX6 (20Longtine M.S. McKenzie A. II I Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4170) Google Scholar). A second cassette harboring the tetO2 response element and minimal CYC1 promoter, the tTA transactivator and associated promoter and terminator elements, and the kanamycin resistance gene and associated promoter and terminator elements with ends homologous to regions flanking the GAL2 promoter was constructed in two steps (Fig. 1C). In the first step, the kanamycin resistance cassette was amplified from pFA6a-ZZ-TEV-S-kanMX6, and the tetracycline-regulatable promoter cassette was amplified from pCM188 (21Gari E. Piedrafita L. Aldea M. Herrero E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) separately. In a second round PCR step, these two cassettes were combined to form one cassette by overlap extension techniques (19Johnston M. Riles L. Hegemann J.H. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 194: 290-315Google Scholar). A third cassette harboring a Schizosaccharomyces pombe histidine biosynthetic gene (his5+) and associated promoter and terminator elements with ends homologous to regions flanking GAL1 on the chromosome was constructed by amplifying the appropriate segment from pFA6-S-TEV-ZZ-HIS3MX6 (20Longtine M.S. McKenzie A. II I Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4170) Google Scholar). Analogous cassettes with regions flanking the GAL3 and GAL80 promoters were also constructed (Fig. 1C).TABLE 1List of strains All strains are derivatives of W303α; only modifications to the wild-type background are indicated.Strain numberGenotypePlasmidW303αMATα his3–11,15 trp1–1 leu2–3 ura3–1 ade2–1CSY22gal2ΔCSY13Gal2p::KanMX6-tTA-tetO2CSY50Wild typepGAL-GFPCSY52gal2ΔpGAL-GFPCSY40Gal2p::KanMX6-tTA-tetO2pGAL-GFPCSY53gal1ΔpGAL-GFPCSY54gal1Δ gal2ΔpGAL-GFPCSY55gal1Δ Gal2p::KanMX6-tTA-tetO2pGAL-GFPCSY89Gal3p::KanMX6-tTA-tetO2pGAL-GFPCSY90Gal80p::His3MX6-tTA-tetO2pGAL-GFPCSY91Gal3p::KanMX6-tTA-tetO2 Gal80p::His3MX6-tTA-tetO2pGAL-GFP Open table in a new tab The individual fragments for the GAL2, GAL3, and GAL80 promoter substitution cassettes were amplified using the TripleMaster PCR system (Eppendorf). All other cassettes were constructed with standard PCR procedures in a Dyad PCR machine (MJ Research) with TaqDNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). Oligonucleotide primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, and primer sequences are available upon request. Cassettes were transformed into the appropriate strains using a standard lithium acetate procedure (22Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2077) Google Scholar). The GAL2 knock-out and GAL2, GAL3, and GAL80 tetracycline-regulatable expression cassettes were inserted into the wild-type strain. The GAL1 knock-out cassette was inserted into the wild-type strain, the GAL2 knock-out strain, and the GAL2 tetracycline-regulatable strain. Strains with inserted cassettes were selected by growth on synthetic complete media with the appropriate antibiotic selection and dropout media. Confirmation of cassette insertion into the correct chromosomal location was conducted by PCR amplification of the targeted region of the chromosome. Yeast Expression Plasmids—Standard molecular biology cloning techniques were used to construct the reporter plasmid to assay Gal4p activation (19Johnston M. Riles L. Hegemann J.H. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 194: 290-315Google Scholar). The plasmid was generated by cloning into the pCM190 (21Gari E. Piedrafita L. Aldea M. Herrero E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) shuttle plasmid. This plasmid contains an E. coli origin of replication (f1) and selection marker for ampicillin resistance, as well as a S. cerevisiae 2 μm high copy origin of replication and a uracil biosynthetic gene for plasmid maintenance in synthetic complete media supplemented with the appropriate amino acid dropout solution. A yeast enhanced green fluorescent protein (yEGFP) gene with a degradation tag (CLN2-PEST) (23Mateus C. Avery S.V. Yeast. 2000; 16: 1313-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and ADH1 terminator was inserted into the multicloning site of pCM190 behind the tetO7 promoter between the BamHI and MluI restriction sites. The GAL1 promoter was then cloned into this vector between EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites. The yEGFP-CLN2-PEST gene was amplified from pSVA15 (23Mateus C. Avery S.V. Yeast. 2000; 16: 1313-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) using standard PCR procedures as described previously. The GAL1 promoter was amplified from pRS314-Gal (24Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This promoter contains two UASs and has been used in previous studies to measure Gal4p activity levels (25Li J. Wang S. VanDusen W.J. Schultz L.D. George H.A. Herber W.K. Chae H.J. Bentley W.E. Rao G. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2000; 70: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The reporter plasmid was constructed using restriction endonucleases and T4 DNA ligase from New England Biolabs. Plasmids were screened by transformation into an electrocompetent E. coli strain, DH10B (Invitrogen; F-mcrA Δ(mrr-hsdRMS-mcrBC) ϕ80dlacZΔM15 ΔlacX74 deoR recA1 endA1 araD139 Δ(ara, leu)7697 galU galK λ-rpsL nupG), using a Gene Pulser Xcell System (BioRAD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subcloning was confirmed by restriction analysis. Confirmed plasmids were then transformed into the appropriate S. cerevisiae strains using a standard lithium acetate protocol (22Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2077) Google Scholar). E. coli cells were grown on Luria-Bertani media (BD Diagnostics) with 100 μg/ml ampicillin (EMD Chemicals) for plasmid maintenance, and S. cerevisiae cells were grown in synthetic complete media (BD Diagnostics) supplemented with the appropriate dropout solution (Calbiochem) for plasmid maintenance. Plasmid isolation was conducted using Perfectprep plasmid isolation kits (Eppendorf) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence Assays—Cell cultures were grown at 30 °C in test tubes shaken at 200 rpm. Strains containing the reporter plasmid were grown in synthetic complete media with the appropriate dropout solution (lacking uracil) and sugar source (2% raffinose, 1% sucrose). Overnight cultures were backdiluted 30-fold into fresh noninducing-nonrepressing media to an A600 between 0.05 and 0.1. For assaying the network response, this fresh media contained appropriate concentrations of galactose (BD Diagnostics), doxycycline (Sigma) for tetracycline-regulatable GAL2, GAL3, and GAL80 strains, or water (negative control). Fluorescence and A600 readings were measured using a Safire (Tecan Group Ltd.) fluorescent plate reader after 8 h. Sample volumes of 200 μl were aliquoted into 96-well flat-bottom black plates (Greiner). The excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 485 and 515 nm, respectively, with a bandwidth of 12 nm. Fluorescence was measured from the bottom of the plate with a gain setting of 100. Fluorescence was normalized for cell number by dividing relative fluorescence units by the A600 of the culture after subtracting the media background from each. All measurements were repeated at least in triplicate. Flow Cytometry Assays—Yeast cells were grown according to methods detailed in fluorescence assays prior to preparation for flow cytometry analysis. After 7 h of induction, 5 ml of cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 5 min, resuspended in 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated on ice for 30 min. This wash was repeated, and the cell solution was subsequently filtered through a 40-μm cell strainer (Falcon). Cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur instrument (Becton Dickinson) using a 15-milliwatt argon laser with a 400 nm excitation wavelength and a 488 nm emission wavelength. For each sample, ∼10,000 cells were analyzed, and each sample was repeated in duplicate. Data from the population fluorescence was analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc). Galactose Permease Deletion Results in a Linear Induction Response— Galactose is transported into the cell through both an induced high affinity and an induced low affinity transport mechanism and an uninduced facilitated diffusion mechanism. The response of the GAL network was determined when the outermost positive feedback loop controlling the autocatalytic expression of the galactose permease Gal2p was removed. Initial studies examined the response of the network in the absence of the induced transport response. A GAL2 deletion strain was constructed by inserting a kanamycin resistance marker into the GAL2 locus of the chromosome. This system enabled the examination of the network response under conditions in which the transport of galactose is limiting. Transcriptional activation, or the level of Gal4p not bound by Gal80p, in both the gal2Δ and the wild-type strain was determined by measuring fluorescence levels in cells harboring yEGFP under the control of a GAL1 promoter, which contains two UASs. The data from these studies indicate that the steady-state population-averaged induction response is linear with respect to galactose in the gal2Δ strain across a wide range of inducer concentrations, whereas the wild-type strain demonstrates the expected autocatalytic response curve. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, both strains exhibit similar induction levels of ∼25-fold over uninduced cells at the highest concentration of three percent galactose. Constitutive Expression of the Galactose Permease Results in a Tunable Linear Response—The complete removal of the induced transport mechanism eliminates the switch-like response of the GAL network. The response of the network in the presence of the inducible high and low affinity transport mechanisms removed from their feedback regulation scheme was also determined. A constitutive GAL2 strain, tetO2: GAL2, was constructed to allow for tunable levels of Gal2p while removing the native positive feedback control loop. A cassette was constructed to replace the GAL2 promoter with a tetracycline-repressible promoter (26Yen K. Gitsham P. Wishart J. Oliver S.G. Zhang N. Yeast. 2003; 20: 1255-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This cassette, which also contains the tTA transactivator and a kanamycin resistance gene, was inserted into the GAL2 promoter region of the chromosome. Prior studies have indicated that in the absence of an appropriate tetracycline analog such as doxycycline, the expression levels from this promoter are ∼10–20% of those observed from a fully induced GAL1 promoter (21Gari E. Piedrafita L. Aldea M. Herrero E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 27Belli G. Gari E. Piedrafita L. Aldea M. Herrero E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 942-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Similar steady-state assays of transcriptional activation in these strains were performed under varying concentrations of galactose and doxycycline. The former is expected to modulate the response of the GAL network in the presence of a constant level of galactose transporter, whereas the latter is expected to modulate the level of the galactose transporter. In the absence of doxycycline, permitting high Gal2p expression, the resulting induction curve is shifted upward when compared with the gal2Δ strain but largely retains linearity (Fig. 2B). The addition of varying concentrations of doxycycline shifts the curve to lower response levels, whereas at concentrations of 5 μg/ml, Gal2p expression is fully repressed and demonstrates a response identical to that of the gal2Δ strain. In addition, the maximum induction level observed in the tetO2:GAL2 strain is significantly greater than that observed in the wild-type strain. It should be noted that at high Gal2p expression levels and low galactose concentrations, the response of the system is slightly nonlinear. Constitutive Expression of Regulatory Proteins Enhances the Switch-like Response of the Network—The GAL network is regulated by three nested feedback control loops. The Gal2p loop is the exterior feedback loop, and the presented data indicate that removal of this loop is sufficient for modulating the sharp native response of this network to a linear response. The effects of the two interior nested loops regulating the expression of Gal80p and Gal3p on the steady-state population-averaged response of the GAL network were determined. Separate constitutive Gal80p and Gal3p strains were constructed by replacing the GAL80 and GAL3 promoters with previously described tetracycline-repressible promoter cassettes harboring the his5+ and kanamycin selection markers, respectively. In addition, a combined constitutive Gal80p/Gal3p strain was constructed by sequential insertion of these cassettes into the wild-type strain. These systems enabled the examination of the response of the GAL network under conditions in which the two internally nested control loops regulating the transcriptional repressor and activator were individually and combinatorially removed. Similar steady-state population-averaged assays of transcriptional activation in these strains were performed under varying concentrations of galactose and doxycycline. Constitutive strains for either regulatory protein Gal3p or Gal80p did not produce the same linear response observed from the constitutive Gal2p strain. The tetO2:GAL3 strain exhibited a steeper response curve under nonrepressed conditions (Fig. 3A). In addition, the repressed response curve demonstrated a memory response such that when doxycycline and galactose were added at the same time point, the response was similar to that under the nonrepressed conditions, whereas when cells were grown in the presence of doxycycline prior to galactose addition, the overall response curve was much lower. The tetO2:GAL80 strain also exhibited a steeper response curve under nonrepressed conditions (Fig. 3B). However, the addition of doxycycline either prior to or at the same time as the addition of galactose did not significantly alter the induction response. In addition, the induction response from the Gal3p/Gal80p constitutive strain was much lower than any of the other strains (Fig. 3C). In this strain, a history-dependent response was also observed in the repressed response curve such that slightly higher induction levels were observed when doxycycline and galactose were added at the same time point versus when the cells were grown in doxycycline prior to induction. Galactokinase Deletion Results in a Regimed Network Response— The data support that the nested positive and negative feedback loops in the GAL network influence the observed steady-state induction response to varying levels of galactose. The galactokinase Gal1p is also anticipated to play a key regulatory role in the response of the network as a result of its two distinct activities. The immediate role of this enzyme is in converting galactose into an energy source for the cell. Therefore, it is anticipated that removal of this activity will increase the overall response of the network at a given galactose concentration as the intracellular levels of galactose available for activating Gal3p will be effectively higher. Prior work has demonstrated higher fully induced response levels in a Gal1p knock-out strain (28Stagoj M.N. Comino A. Komel R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2005; 244: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, the galactokinase also plays a key role in the high affinity transport mechanisms associated with Gal2p (12Ramos J. Szkutnicka K. Cirillo V.P. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3539-354"

Since rhodopsin has a very small N-ted, the determination of its structure provided no clue to understand the process of peptide hormone binding to class II receptors. Experimentally based molecular modeling of the N-ted has been reported for the hPTH1 receptor (6Chorev M. Receptors Channels. 2002; 8: 219-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and a structural model has been constructed for the hVPAC1 by sequence homology with a functionally unrelated protein, the structure of which was available in the protein data bank (7Lins L.

DiGruccio M.R. Miller C.L. Rivier J.E. Vale W.W. Riek R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Couvineau A. Marie J.C. Receptors Channels. 2002; 8: 137-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). It appeared that the N-ted of the VPAC1 receptor plays a crucial role for VIP binding, although it is not sufficient to ensure high affinity (9Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Marie J.C. Receptors Channels. 2002; 8: 137-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The physical sites of interaction between VIP and its receptor had remained elusive until recent photoaffinity experiments showing that the side chains of positions 6 and 22 of VIP are in direct contact with the N-ted of the receptor (10Tan Y.V.

Chem. 2004; 279: 38889-38894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Since it is well known that VIP has diffuse pharmacophoric domains, with the amino acid residues important for biological activity being distributed along the whole 28-amino acid peptide chain (12Nicole P. Lins L. Rouyer-Fessard C. Drouot C. Fulcrand P. Thomas A. Couvineau A. Martinez J. Brasseur R. Laburthe M. J. Biol.

Moreover, contacts between residues in VIP and its receptor should be determined to dock VIP in its binding site.In this context, the present work has several complementary goals: (i) to develop a new photoaffinity probe by substituting benzoylbenzoyl-l-Lys for asparagine 24 and to determine spatial approximation between the hVPAC1 receptor and the side chain of position 24 of VIP; (ii) to determine by radiochemical Edman degradation the pairs of residues in VIP and in the receptor that ensure the covalent attachment of the above mentioned 125I-[Bz2-K24]-VIP probe but also of two photoaffinity probes previously described i.e. 125I-[Bpa6]-VIP (11Tan Y.V.

The concentration of peptides that elicited half-maximal inhibition of specific 125I-VIP binding (Ki) was determined by computer analysis. Adenylyl cyclase activity in cell membranes was assayed in the presence of increasing concentrations of VIP or [Bz2-K24]-VIP as described (12Nicole P. Lins L. Rouyer-Fessard C. Drouot C. Fulcrand P.

The photolabeled receptors were then analyzed directly by electrophoresis or after chemical or enzymatic cleavage.Photoaffinity-labeled Receptor Cleavage—Cleavage of labeled hVPAC1 receptor or mutants with CNBr, peptide N-glycosidase F, or endoproteinase Glu-C was performed as described (10Tan Y.V.

The apparent molecular masses of radiolabeled receptor fragments were determined by interpolation on a plot of the mobility of the Rainbow™ colored protein molecular weight markers from Amersham Biosciences or BenchMark™ prestained protein ladder from Invitrogen versus the log values of their masses.Edman Degradation Sequencing—Identification of receptor fragments affinity-labeled with VIP probes was performed by Edman degradation sequencing (18Edman P. Begg G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 1: 80-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells expressing receptor mutants were incubated with labeled photoaffinity probes, washed, and photolysed. Cells were then washed and collected by centrifugation, and pellets were analyzed by NuPAGE electrophoresis. The labeled receptor band was cut out from the gel, electroeluted, and lyophilized under vacuum, and then CNBr fragments were obtained as described (10Tan Y.V. Couvineau A. Van Rampelbergh J.

CNBr fragments were then dissolved in a buffer containing 10 mg/ml 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide and immobilized in the C terminus position by coupling to 20 mg of N-(2-aminoethyl-1)-3-aminopropyl glass beads for 2 h at room temperature. It should be noted that the carboxyl group of 125I-photolabile VIP probes was amidated as in the wild-type VIP and did not interfere with the coupling to the beads. Immobilized fragments were subjected to manual Edman degradation sequencing up to six cycles as follows. Beads were washed with 50 μl of triethylamine for three times and dried. 60 μl of triethylamine/methanol/phenylisothiocyanate mixture (1:7:1) were added to beads and incubated at 50 °C for 5 min. Beads were washed three times and dried. Dried beads were incubated with 50 μl of trifluoroacetic acid for 5 min at 25 °C and washed three times with 200 μl of methanol. Washing methanol effluents were pooled and evaporated, and the radioactivity released was quantified in a γ-spectrometer. The beads were dried and ready to use for the next cycle.Molecular Modeling—The three-dimensional NMR structure of the amino-terminal domain of the mouse CRF 2β receptor (8Grace C.R.R. Perrin M.H. DiGruccio M.R. Miller C.L. Rivier J.E. Vale W.W. Riek R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sequence of the N-ted-(1-137) of the hVPAC1 receptor was aligned with the N-terminal domain of CRF 2 receptor (Protein Data Bank code: 1U34) using FASTA algorithm (19Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9345) Google Scholar). To further check the homology, the hydrophobic cluster analysis plots of both sequences were compared using the Visualfasta program (P. Durand, Paris, France). Based on sequence alignment, 100 homology models were built using Modeler version 6.0, and the objective function was calculated for each model to select the best score (7Lins L. Couvineau A.

Energy minimization calculation was performed with the AMBER forcefield. The model has 77% of the φ, Ψ angle pairs in the allowed region of Ramachandran plot, indicating a correct stereochemistry.NMR Experiments and Structure Determination of VIP—VIP was dissolved at 2 mm in 90:10 H2O:D2O phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 30% (v/v) trifluoroethanol-d2 as a helix stabilizer. 1H-NMR experiments were carried out on a DRX 600 Bruker spectrometer at 25 and 30 °C. Total correlated spectroscopy and NOE spectroscopy were recorded with mixing times of 80 and 150 ms, respectively. From the NOE spectroscopy spectra, a total of 527 NOEs were observed. The NOE intensities were used as input to ARIA1.2 (20Linge J.P. Habeck M. Rieping W. Nilges M. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2003; 19: 315-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). An ensemble of 100 structures was calculated with the ARIA default protocol. The 10 lowest energy conformers were minimized using CHARMM29 (21Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J.

Using HADDOCK 1.2 (23Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M.J.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar) with the standard protocols, interaction restraints were applied between the residues Phe6, Tyr22, and Asn24 of the 10 conformers of VIP and the residues Asp107, Gly116, and Cys122 of the model of the receptor N-ted, respectively. The intermolecular distances were defined with a maximum value of 3 Å between any atom of the interacting residues. Interface was defined for VIP by all residues from 1 to 28 and for the (43-137) hVPAC1 receptor by the residues 79-86, 100-107, and 113-137. For the first iteration, 2000 rigid docking structures were generated, and then in the second iteration, the 200 best structures were subjected to a semiflexible simulated annealing. The lowest energy structure has been submitted to a 2 ns molecular dynamics at 300 K in vacuum using CHARMM 29. Minimization steps were carried out before and after the molecular dynamics run. A distance-dependent dielectric coefficient has been used to approximate the solvent screening effect without including explicit water molecules.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAnalysis of Spatial Approximation between VIP and Its Receptor by Photoaffinity—In previous studies, it was shown that photolabile residues in positions 6 and 22 of VIP covalently labeled receptor fragments 104-108 (11Tan Y.V. Couvineau A. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38889-38894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and 109-120 (10Tan Y.V. Couvineau A. Van Rampelbergh J. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36531-36536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) in the N-ted of the hVPAC1 receptor, respectively (Table 2). We further extend these studies by synthesizing [Bz2-K24]-VIP, which consists of substitution of Asn24 residue by the photolabile residue benzoylbenzoyl-l-Lys. This probe was equipotent with native VIP in inhibiting 125I-VIP binding (Ki of 0.6 nm) and in stimulating adenylyl cyclase activity (EC50 of 0.3 nm) in CHO cells expressing the hVPAC1 receptor (Fig. 1). This is not surprising since previous alanine scanning studies showed that the amino acid residue in position 24 of VIP is not important for biological activity of the peptide (12Nicole P. Lins L. Rouyer-Fessard C. Drouot C. Fulcrand P. Thomas A. Couvineau A. Martinez J. Brasseur R. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24003-24012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Incubation of 125I-[Bz2-K24]-VIP with transfected CHO cells followed by UV exposure and NuPAGE analysis of proteins revealed a single band at approximate Mr = 95,000, which disappeared when the labeled probe was incubated in the presence of 1 μm cold VIP (Fig. 2). After CNBr cleavage, the 95-kDa band generated a single 30-kDa labeled band (Fig. 2), which is highly glycosylated since it further generated an 11-kDa band after incubation with peptide N-glycosidase F (Fig. 2). Considering the known glycosylation sites of the hVPAC1 receptor (24Gaudin P. Couvineau A. Maoret J.J. Rouyer-Fessard C. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and the theoretical receptor fragments generated by its CNBr cleavage (10Tan Y.V. Couvineau A. Van Rampelbergh J. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36531-36536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), it can be concluded that 125I-[Bz2-K24]-VIP is attached to the Trp67-Met137 receptor fragment in the N-ted of the receptor. Endopeptidase Glu-C treatment of the 30-kDa band generated a major ∼6-kDa band (Fig. 2), which represented the receptor segment 109-133 considering the known cleavage sites for this enzyme (10Tan Y.V. Couvineau A. Van Rampelbergh J. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36531-36536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We created a new CNBr cleavage site within this sequence by mutating Ile120 into methionine. The I120M mutant stably expressed in CHO cell-bound VIP with an affinity identical to that of the wild-type receptor (not shown). After incubation of the I120M mutant with 125I-[Bz2-K24]-VIP and CNBr treatment of proteins, a 5-kDa labeled band was observed (not shown) instead of a 30-kDa band for the wild-type receptor (Fig. 2). This 5-kDa band represented the 121-133 receptor fragment (Table 2) attached to the covalently 125I-[Bz2-K24]-VIP probe.TABLE 2hVPAC1 receptor fragments and residues covalently attached to photoaffinity probesPhotoaffinity probeLabeled receptor fragmentRef.Receptor residue involved in covalent bondRef.125I-[Bpa6]-VIP104-10811Asp107This paper125I-[Bpa22]-VIP109-12010Gly116This paper125I-[Bz2-K24]-VIP121-133This paperCys122This paper Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2Photoaffinity labeling of the hVPAC1 receptor with the 125I-[Bz2-K24]-VIP probe.

https://openalex.org/W1966642383,"The high affinity iron uptake complex in the yeast plasma membrane (PM) consists of the ferroxidase, Fet3p, and the ferric iron permease, Ftr1p. We used a combination of yeast two-hybrid analysis, confocal fluorescence microscopy, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) quantification to delineate the motifs in the two proteins required for assembly and maturation into an uptake-competent complex. The cytoplasmic, carboxyl-terminal domain of each protein contains a four-residue motif adjacent to the cytoplasm-PM interface that supports an interaction between the proteins. This interaction has been quantified by two-hybrid analysis and is required for assembly and trafficking of the complex to the PM and for the ∼13% maximum FRET efficiency determined. In contrast, the Fet3p transmembrane domain (TM) can be exchanged with the TM domain from the vacuolar ferroxidase, Fet5p, with no loss of assembly and trafficking. A carboxyl-terminal interaction between the vacuolar proteins, Fet5p and Fth1p, also was quantified. As a measure of the specificity of interaction, no interaction between heterologous ferroxidase permease pairs was observed. Also, whereas FRET was quantified between fluorescent fusions of the copper permease (monomers), Ctr1p, none was observed between Fet3p and Ctr1p. The results are consistent with a (minimal) heterodimer model of the Fet3p·Ftr1p complex that supports the trafficking of iron from Fet3p to Ftr1p for iron permeation across the yeast PM."

The factor eIF2 is responsible for delivering Met-tRNAiMet to the 40 S subunit in the first step of translation initiation (reviewed in Refs. 1Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B.

The eIF2 is composed of three polypeptide chains: the core eIF2γ subunit (GCD11 in yeast), to which the eIF2α (SUI2) and eIF2β (SUI3) subunits bind. The eIF2γ subunit contains a consensus GTP-binding (G) domain at its N terminus, and structural studies on the eIF2γ homolog from archaea revealed a three-domain structure that closely resembles the structure of the translation elongation factor EF-Tu (EF1A) (3Roll-Mecak A.

Chem. 2004; 279: 15984-15993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The N terminus of the eIF2β subunit contains three lysine-rich segments (K-boxes) that are absent from the corresponding archaeal protein and do not appear to be important for binding to eIF2γ (7Yatime L. Schmitt E. Blanquet S. Mechulam Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15984-15993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 8Thompson G.M. Pacheco E. Melo E.O. Castilho B.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Moreover, the binding site for eIF2β on eIF2γ has not been resolved. Following binding of the eIF2 ternary complex (eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAiMet) to the 40 S subunit and association of other initiation factors, including eIF1, eIF1A, eIF3, and eIF5 (TIF5 in yeast), the so-called 43 S preinitiation complex binds to an mRNA near the 5′ cap structure in a reaction facilitated by the eIF4 family of factors (reviewed in Ref. 1Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 33-88Google Scholar). The 43 S complex then scans the mRNA in a 5′ to 3′ direction in search of an AUG start codon. Base pairing between the 5′-CAU-3′ anticodon of the Met-tRNAiMet in the 43 S complex with an AUG codon is thought to halt the scanning ribosome and trigger GTP hydrolysis by eIF2. This GTP hydrolysis reaction is stimulated by the putative GTPase-activating protein (GAP) eIF5 (9Das S. Ghosh R. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6720-6726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 10Paulin F.E. Campbell L.E. O'Brien K. Loughlin J. Proud C.G. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 55-59Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Following GTP hydrolysis, eIF2 and other initiation factors are released from the 40 S ribosome (11Maag D. Fekete C.A. Gryczynski Z. Lorsch J.R. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 12Unbehaun A. Borukhov S.I. Hellen C.U. Pestova T.V. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3078-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), which then joins with the 60 S subunit in a reaction catalyzed by a second GTPase eIF5B (13Pestova T.V. Lomakin I.B. Lee J.H. Choi S.K. Dever T.E. Hellen C.U.T. Nature. 2000; 403: 332-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The eIF2 is released from the ribosome bound to GDP, and, like a number of G proteins, eIF2 has a higher affinity for GDP than for GTP (∼100-fold difference for yeast eIF2). The nonenzymatic exchange of GTP for GDP on eIF2 occurs slowly, and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) eIF2B enhances the rate of this reaction and recycles eIF2 for use in subsequent rounds of translation initiation (2Hinnebusch A.G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 185-243Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the eIF2α subunit on Ser51 by one of the stress-responsive eIF2α kinases (GCN2, PERK, PKR, or HRI) converts eIF2 from a substrate to an inhibitor of eIF2B and thereby blocks cellular protein synthesis (reviewed in Ref. 14Dever T.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). The eIF2B is composed of five subunits that can be both physically and functionally separated into two subcomplexes (reviewed in Ref. 2Hinnebusch A.G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 185-243Google Scholar). The regulatory subcomplex, composed of the α (GCN3 in yeast), β (GCD7), and δ (GCD2) subunits of eIF2B, binds to eIF2α in a manner stimulated by Ser51 phosphorylation (15Krishnamoorthy T. Pavitt G.D. Zhang F. Dever T.E. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5018-5030Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The catalytic subcomplex, composed of the γ (GCD1) and ϵ (GCD6) subunits of eIF2B, binds to eIF2 and catalyzes guanine nucleotide exchange in vitro (16Pavitt G.D. Ramaiah K.V.A. Kimball S.R. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 514-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Further in vitro studies mapped the eIF2B GEF activity to the C-terminal ∼200 residues of eIF2Bϵ (17Gomez E. Mohammad S.S. Pavitt G.D. EMBO J. 2002; : 5292-5301Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), which was found to fold into an eight-stranded α-helical bundle resembling a HEAT repeat (18Boesen T. Mohammad S.S. Pavitt G.D. Andersen G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10584-10592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the eIF2Bϵ HEAT domain contains two regions of conserved aromatic and acidic amino acids referred to as AA-boxes (or the W2 domain) that are also found in eIF5 (see Fig. 1) (19Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1172-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 20Asano K. Krishnamoorthy T. Phan L. Pavitt G.D. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1673-1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These AA-boxes in both eIF2Bϵ and eIF5 have been shown to directly interact with the K-boxes in the N-terminal half of eIF2β (Fig. 1) (20Asano K. Krishnamoorthy T. Phan L. Pavitt G.D. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1673-1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Das S. Maiti T. Das K. Maitra U. J. Biol.

Multiple alanine substitutions in the AA-boxes of eIF2Bϵ and eIF5 disrupt binding to eIF2β (20Asano K. Krishnamoorthy T. Phan L. Pavitt G.D. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1673-1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistently, these AA-box mutations in eIF5 and the corresponding K-box mutations in eIF2β impair initiation complex assembly (23Asano K. Clayton J. Shalev A. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2534-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 24Asano K. Shalev A. Phan L. Nielsen K. Clayton J. Valásek L. Donahue T.F.

Chem. 2004; 279: 49644-49655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Given the direct interactions of eIF2B and eIF5 with eIF2β and the lack of evidence for a direct interaction of these proteins with the GTP-binding eIF2γ subunit, it could be proposed that these effectors of G protein function modulate eIF2γ nucleotide exchange and hydrolysis indirectly (allosterically) through eIF2β. Alternatively, the interactions with eIF2β may serve a scaffolding role to facilitate the binding of other regions in the GAP (eIF5) and GEF (eIF2B) to eIF2γ. Here we present in vitro evidence that both eIF5 and eIF2Bϵ directly interact with eIF2γ. Moreover, we map this interaction to the eIF2γ-G domain, consistent with the notion that these proteins directly modulate guanine nucleotide binding and hydrolysis by eIF2.

Plasmids—DNA fragments encoding various eIF2γ (GCD11) fragments were amplified by PCR and cloned into the vector pEGKT (26Mitchell D.A. Marshall T.K. Deschenes R.J. Yeast. 1993; 9: 715-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) between the BamHI and SalI sites. The primers used for PCR were as follows: pC2693 (encoding GST-G) (BamHI-GCD11 (5′-CGCGGATCCGACTTACAAGACCAAGAACCTAGC-3′) plus D1/SalI (5′-CGCAGTCGACTTAATCTCTTGGTGGTACGGGAATAGTC-3′)); pC2694 (encoding GST-D2) (D2/BamHI (5′-CGCGGATCCGTTTCTCCAAGGTTAATTGTTATTCGTTC-3′) plus D2/SalI (5′-CGCAGTCGACTTAAAGACGATCAGCTCTACACAAGG-3′)); pC2695 (encoding GST-D3) (D3/BamHI (5′-CGCGGATCCGGTCAAGTCGTCGGTGCTAAGGGTC-3′) plus D3/SalI (5′-CGCAGTCGACTTAAGCGATGGGTTCCAATGTAGTAC-3′)); pC2696 (encoding GST-G + D2) (BamHI-GCD11 (5′-CGCGGATCCGACTTACAAGACCAAGAACCTAGC-3′ plus D2/SalI (5′-CGCAGTCGACTTAAAGACGATCAGCTCTACACAAGG-3′)); pC2697 (encoding GST-FL) (BamHI-GCD11 (5′-CGCGGATCCGACTTACAAGACCAAGAACCTAGC-3′) plus D3/SalI (5′-CGCAGTCGACTTAAGCGATGGGTTCCAATGTAGTAC-3′)). DNA fragments encoding eIF5 (TIF5) were amplified by PCR and cloned between the BamHI and SalI sites of the vector pGEX-6P-1 using the indicated primers: pC2698 (full-length GST-eIF5) (BamHI/TIF5 (5′-CATGGATCCATTAATATTTGTAGAGATAATCATGATCC-3′) plus SalI/TIF5 (5′-CGCAGTCGACCTATTCGTCGTCTTCTTCATC-3′)); pC2702 (GST-eIF5Δ1-50) (BamHI/TIF5Δ1-50 (5′-CATGCGGATCCGCTCCATATATTGTCAAGTATTTTGGTTTC) plus SalI/TIF5); pC2699 (GST-eIF5-C-terminal domain (CTD)) (5′-CGAGGATCCCTAGACGTCTTGAATGATCC-3′ plus SalI/TIF5); pC2700 (GST-eIF5-N-terminal domain (NTD)) (BamHI/TIF5 (5′-CATGGATCCATTAATATTTGTAGAGATAATCATGATCC-3′) plus SalI/NT-stp-TIF5 (5′-CGCAGTCGACCTAGTCTAGTTCTGCAGCCTTC-3′)). DNA fragments encoding internal deletion mutants of eIF5 were generated by PCR amplification and cloned into pGEX-6P-1 using the following primers: pC2703 (GST-eIF5Δ50-100) (BamHI/TIF5 plus TIF5Nc50-100 (5′-GATGATCTCCGTTTCTGGATTTTTACAGCTAGGTCTATTTAGCGCGTGAGAGATGTC-3′)), TIF5Cod50-100 (5′-GACATCTCTCACGCGCTAAATAGACCTAGCTGTAAAAATCCAGAAACGGAGATCATC-3′ plus SalI/TIF5), pC2704 (GST-eIF5Δ75-100) (BamHI/TIF5 plus TIF5Nc75-100 (5′-GGTAATGATGATCTCCGTTTCTGGATTTTTACAGCTATAACGATCTTTGTCAACAGAG-3′), and TIF5Cod75-100 (5′-CTCTGTTGACAAAGATCGTTATAGCTGTAAAAATCCAGAAACGGAGATCATCATTACC) plus SalI/TIF5). A DNA fragment encoding the eIF2Bϵ C-terminal domain (CTD) was amplified using the primers SacI-FLAG-GCD6-524 (5′-GGGTGAGCTCATGTCCGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAAGTCAATAGTATATACACGGATAGAGAAG-3′) plus PstI/GCD6-524 (5′-CGCACTGCAGTTATTCCTCTTCTGAGGAAGATTCTTC-3′) and then subcloned into the vector p2444 (27Ung T.L. Cao C. Lu J. Ozato K. Dever T.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3728-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), generating the plasmid pC2701. Finally, a DNA fragment encoding full-length eIF2γ was amplified using the primers D1/NcoI (5′-CTGTCCATGGGTGACTTACAAGACCAAGAACCTAGC-3′) plus D3/EcoRI (5′-ACGCGAATTCTTAAGCGATGGGTTCCAATGTAGTAC-3′) and then subcloned to the vector pGBKT7 (Clontech), generating pC2705. Yeast GST Pull-down Assays—Yeast cells expressing various GST-eIF2γ fusion proteins were grown in 50 ml of synthetic complete (SC) medium at 30 °C to midlog phase, harvested, and washed with SGR medium (SC plus 10% galactose and 2% raffinose). The cells were then seeded in 50 ml of SGR medium to A600 ∼0.5, grown to A600 ∼0.8 to induce expression of the GST fusion proteins, harvested, and frozen at -80 °C until further use. Cells were suspended in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm β-ME, containing one tablet of protease inhibitor mixture and 2 μm each aprotinin, leupeptin, pefabloc, 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, and pepstatin (Roche Applied Science)), and whole cell extracts (WCEs) were prepared by homogenizing the cells by vortexing with glass beads. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were washed several times and suspended in 500 μl of binding buffer (lysis buffer plus 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and 1% skimmed milk). 350 μg of yeast WCEs were mixed with ∼70 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with rotation at 4 °C for 3 h. Proteins attached to the beads were washed three times with washing buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm β-ME, 0.2% Nonidet P-40), resuspended into 2× SDS loading buffer, boiled for 5 min, separated by 4-20% SDS-PAGE, and then analyzed by immunoblotting with previously described (28Valásek L. Phan L. Schoenfeld L.W. Valásková V. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 891-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) rabbit polyclonal antibodies against eIF3a (anti-TIF32), eIF2Bϵ (anti-GCD6), eIF5 (anti-TIF5), eIF2α (anti-SUI2), or RPS2 (anti-RPS2) or with rabbit polyclonal anti-GST (Sigma) antibodies or mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 peptide (Sigma) antibodies. Anti-yeast eIF2γ antiserum was obtained by inoculating rabbits with recombinant FL His6-tagged eIF2γ purified from Escherichia coli. Interactions between Recombinant Proteins in Vitro—GST (pGEX-6P-1) or GST-eIF5 fusions (pC2698 (eIF5-FL), pC2699 (eIF5-CTD280-405), pC2700 (eIF5-NTD1-279), pC2702 (eIF5-Δ 1-50), pC2703 (eIF5-Δ 50-100), and pC2704 (eIF5-Δ 75-100)) were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells. Cells were grown to A600 ∼0.8 at 37 °C, induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and incubated at 30 °C for 5 h. Cells were harvested, washed with ice-cold 1× Tris-buffered saline, and suspended in 5 ml of sonication buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm β-ME, 0.5% Triton X-100, and complete protease inhibitor mixture). Cells were sonicated five times with a 2-s burst and 2-s cooling, cell debris was removed, and WCEs were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. WCEs were mixed with 0.5 ml of Glutathione-Sepharose beads that had been washed three times and were incubated at 4 °C for 3 h on a nutator. The beads were washed with 20 bed volumes of wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2,5mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm β-ME, and 1% Triton X-100) and stored at -80 °C. The purified protein bound to the beads was assessed by SDS-PAGE. Templates for coupled in vitro transcription and translation of full-length eIF2γ or the isolated G domain were generated by PCR using pC2705 as a template and a common 5′ primer, PGBK5 (5′-CAGTGGAGACTGATATGCCTC-3′). The 3′ primer varied for three products: full-length eIF2γ, D3/EcoRI (5′-ACGCGAATTCTTAAGCGATGGGTTCCAATGTAGTAC-3′); G domain, D1/EcoRI (5′-ACGCGAATTCTTAATCTCTTGGTGGTACGGGAATAGTC-3′); and FLAG-tagged G domain, D1/EcoRI-Flg (5′-ACGCGAATTCTTATTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCAGCATCTCTTGGTGGTACGGGAATAGTC-3′). The [35S]methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol at 10 mCi/ml)-labeled proteins were synthesized by programming the TNT rabbit reticulocyte lysate transcription/translation kit (Promega) with the PCR-amplified templates, and the products were frozen at -80 °C. GST or various GST-eIF5 fusions bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were suspended in 500 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm β-ME, 1% Triton X-100, 1% skimmed milk, and complete protease inhibitor mixture), incubated at 4 °C for 1 h on a nutator to block nonspecific binding sites, and then mixed with the full TNT lysates containing 35S-labeled full-length eIF2γ or eIF2γ-G domain and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. Alternatively, the binding reactions contained 35S-labeled FLAG-tagged eIF2γ-G domain that was purified from rabbit reticulocyte lysates using anti-FLAG M2 agarose (Sigma) followed by elution with FLAG-peptide (100 μg/ml) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following binding, the beads were washed four times with 1 ml of binding buffer without skimmed milk, and bound proteins were eluted in 2× SDS loading buffer, boiled for 5 min, and separated by 4-20% SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with GelCode (Pierce) followed by autoradiography. GTPase Assays—Translation initiation factors eIF1, eIF1A, and eIF2, Met-tRNAiMet and 40 S ribosomal subunits were purified as described previously (29Algire M.A. Maag D. Savio P. Acker M.G. Tarun Jr., S.Z. Sachs A.B. Asano K. Nielsen K.H. Olsen D.S. Phan L. Hinnebusch A.G. Lorsch J.R. RNA. 2002; 8: 382-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). GST-eIF5 fusion proteins were purified as described above with the following additional steps. The glutathione-Sepharose beads were washed with 5 bed volumes of cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and then suspended in 1 bed volume of cleavage buffer. Following the addition of 20 units of PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences), the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C on a nutator. The cleaved GST, uncleaved GST-eIF5, and protease were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the liberated eIF5 in the supernatant was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in storage buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol). The model AUG-containing mRNA (30Algire M.A. Maag D. Lorsch J.R. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 251-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) was obtained from Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). The GTPase reactions and the calculations of the rate of GTP hydrolysis with the different versions of eIF5 were performed as described by Algire et al. (30Algire M.A. Maag D. Lorsch J.R. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 251-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), except eIF2 ternary complexes were formed in the presence of [γ-33P]GTP (10 mCi/ml, 3000 Ci/mmol), and 33Pi release was monitored by thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine-cellulose in 0.8 m lithium acetate and quantified using a PhosphorImager. Direct Interaction of eIF5 and eIF2Bϵ with eIF2γ—To study the interaction of eIF2γ with other translation initiation factors, we generated a fusion construct to overexpress in yeast cells GST fused to full-length (FL) eIF2γ. Expression of the GST fusion protein was under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter. Following induction of GST or GST-eIF2γ-FL expression, WCEs were prepared, and the GST or GST-eIF2γ fusion protein was immobilized on glutathione beads. Products of the pull-down reactions were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot analyses using antibodies specific for various translation factors. As shown in Fig. 2 (top), both GST and GST-eIF2γ were expressed and pelleted with the glutathione beads. The FL GST-eIF2γ fusion protein readily interacted with the α and β subunits of eIF2 (Fig. 2, lane 11), consistent with the idea that eIF2γ is the keystone of the eIF2 complex (3Roll-Mecak A. Alone P. Cao C. Dever T.E. Burley S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10634-10642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, GST-eIF2γ (FL) interacted with eIF5 and eIF2Bϵ (Fig. 2, lane 11) but not with the factor eIF3 nor with the small ribosomal subunit (RPS2p is a constituent of the yeast 40 S ribosomal subunit). Previous studies revealed that three lysine-rich segments (K-boxes) located in the N-terminal half of eIF2β mediate a direct interaction with a conserved sequence element consisting of two segments rich in acidic and aromatic amino acids (AA-boxes) and found near the C terminus of eIF5 and eIF2Bϵ (20Asano K. Krishnamoorthy T. Phan L. Pavitt G.D. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1673-1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Das S. Maiti T. Das K. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31712-31718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 22Das S. Maitra U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3942-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, the ability of eIF2γ-FL to pull down eIF5 and eIF2Bϵ could reflect an interaction bridged by eIF2β rather than a direct interaction of eIF2γ with these two effectors of eIF2 function. It was previously shown that substitution of alanine for all seven lysine residues in the first and second K-boxes of eIF2β (the K12 mutation) impaired the binding of eIF2β to both eIF5 and eIF2Bϵ (20Asano K. Krishnamoorthy T. Phan L. Pavitt G.D. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1673-1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to test if eIF5 and eIF2Bϵ bind directly to eIF2γ or whether this interaction is bridged by eIF2β, we examined the binding of eIF5 and eIF2Bϵ to eIF2γ in strains expressing the eIF2β-K12 mutant. However, prior to this experiment, we first tested whether the eIF2β-K12 mutation impaired the binding of eIF5 and eIF2Bϵ to eIF2β under the conditions of our pull-down assays. As shown in Fig. 3A (lane 2), eIF2γ, eIF5, and eIF2Bϵ were readily co-precipitated with FLAG-tagged wild-type eIF2β in FLAG pull-down assays. In contrast, only eIF2γ was co-precipitated with the FLAG-tagged eIF2β-K12 mutant (Fig. 3A, lane 4). Thus, the eIF2β-K12 mutation did not affect eIF2 (α + β + γ) complex formation, but it did impair the interaction between eIF2β and both eIF5 and eIF2Bϵ under the conditions of our experiments. Next, we examined, in the same whole cell extracts, the impact of the eIF2β-K12 mutation on the ability of the GST-eIF2γ-FL fusion protein to pull down other factors. As expected, the GST-eIF2γ-FL fusion protein readily interacted with eIF2α and eIF2β-K12 (Fig. 3B, lane 12). Interestingly, GST-eIF2γ-FL also bound to eIF5 and eIF2Bϵ in the eIF2β-K12 mutant strain (Fig. 3B, lane 12). Thus, disruption of the K-boxes in eIF2β did not impair the interaction between FL eIF2γ and eIF5 or eIF2Bϵ, consistent with the idea that this interaction is direct and not bridged by eIF2β. Providing further support for this idea, and as will be discussed below, the interaction between eIF2γ and eIF5 was likewise not impaired by mutations in the AA-boxes located near the C terminus of eIF5 that disrupt the interaction between eIF5 and eIF2β. Direct Binding of eIF5 and eIF2Bϵ to the eIF2γ-G Domain—Based upon the archaeal Methanocaldococcus jannaschii and Pyrococcus abyssi eIF2γ crystal structures (3Roll-Mecak A. Alone P. Cao C. Dever T.E.

To map the eIF2α, eIF2β, eIF5, and eIF2Bϵ binding sites on eIF2γ, we generated constructs to express GST fused to the G, D2, D3, G + D2, and G + D2 + D3 (FL) domains of eIF2γ. The various GST fusion proteins were expressed to high levels in yeast and were readily pelleted with glutathione beads (Fig. 2, top). Previously, we and others (3Roll-Mecak A. Alone P. Cao C.

However, in contrast to FL eIF2γ, GST fusion proteins containing a single eIF2γ domain (G, D2, or D3) or G + D2 failed to interact with eIF2α and eIF2β (Fig. 2, lanes 3, 5, 7, and 9). The failure of these individual eIF2γ domains to interact with eIF2α or eIF2β could indicate that stable incorporation of eIF2α and eIF2β in the eIF2 complex requires contacts with multiple domains of eIF2γ or that the epitopes required for eIF2α or eIF2β binding are not folding properly in the context of the isolated eIF2γ domains.

https://openalex.org/W2031249210,"Regulated translocation of canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) proteins to the plasma membrane has been proposed as a mechanism of their activation. By using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), we monitored green fluorescent protein-labeled TRPC3 (TRPC3-GFP) movement to the plasma membrane in HEK293 cells stably expressing this fusion protein. We observed no increase in TRPC3-GFP TIRFM in response to the muscarinic receptor agonist methacholine or the synthetic diacylglycerol, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol, despite activation of TRPC3 by these agents. We did, however, observe a TIRFM response to epidermal growth factor (EGF). This TIRFM response to EGF was accompanied by increased Ba2+ entry and TRPC3 currents. However, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol-induced TRPC3 activity was not increased. TIRFM also increased in response to Gd3+, a competitive inhibitor of TRPC3 channels. This may be indicative of constitutive trafficking of TRPC3, with Gd3+ acting to “trap” cycling TRPC3 molecules in the plasma membrane. Consistent with this interpretation, TRPC3-expressing cells exhibited large variance in membrane capacitance, and this variance was decreased by both Gd3+ and EGF. These results indicate the following: (i) trafficking of TRPC3 may play a role in regulating the concentration of channels in the plasma membrane but is not involved in activation through the phospholipase C pathway; (ii) TRPC3 undergoes constitutive cyclical trafficking in the plasma membrane, and the mechanism by which growth factors increase the number of plasma membrane channels may involve stabilizing them in the plasma membrane.

Mammalian TRPs have been further divided into three major subgroups as follows: the TRPV group, named after the founding member the vanilloid receptor; the TRPM group, named after the melastatin gene; and the TRPC or canonical TRP group, so named because these proteins share the greatest homology with the original Drosophila TRP. Similarly to Drosophila TRP, the TRPC proteins, which consist of seven members (TRPC1-7), are activated downstream of phospholipase C (PLC) (4Putney Jr., J.W.

Acta. 2004; 1742: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). PLC is activated as a result of stimulation of G-protein-coupled receptors or receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, and the enzyme is responsible for cleaving its substrate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into two second messenger molecules, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) (6Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). IP3 induces the release of Ca2+ stored within the endoplasmic reticulum by interacting with and gating the IP3 receptor, thus resulting in an increase in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration (7Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar). DAG is most recognizable as an activator of protein kinase C (8Newton A.C. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The PIP2 hydrolyzing activity of PLC is also an important regulator of TRPC activity, although the mechanisms may differ among TRPC isoforms and depend upon expression conditions and cellular environment. In many cases, TRPC channels can be activated as a consequence of IP3-mediated depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores, i.e. they function as capacitative or store-operated calcium channels (9Freichel M.

In other instances, TRPC channels appear to be activated as a consequence of PLC activation, but this occurs by a mechanism that does not depend upon store depletion. In this receptoror PLC-operated mode, the various TRPC isoforms can be grouped into the following two classes based on structural and functional similarities: TRPC3, -6, and -7 are activated by DAG via a protein kinase C-independent mechanism (20Hofmann T.

In addition, there is accumulating evidence that agonist-induced activation of TRPCs may involve their exocytotic insertion into the plasma membrane. Cayouette et al. (26Cayouette S. Lussier M.P. Mathieu E.L. Bousquet S.M. Boulay G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7241-7246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) showed by surface biotinylation labeling of HEK293 cells that externalization of overexpressed TRPC6 increases in response to muscarinic receptor stimulation or depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores with thapsigargin. Singh et al. (27Singh B.B. Lockwich T.P. Bandyopadhyay B.C. Liu X. Bollimuntha S. Brazer S.C. Combs C. Das S. Leenders A.G. Sheng Z.H. Knepper M.A. Ambudkar S.V. Ambudkar I.S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) also demonstrated carbachol-induced externalization of TRPC3 by surface biotinylation labeling. In both cases channel externalization occurred in the presence of 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, discounting the possibility of a secondary effect of the Ca2+ mobilizing activity of the agonists. Bezzerides et al. (28Bezzerides V.J. Ramsey I.S. Kotecha S. Greka A. Clapham D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) employed the technique of total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) together with surface biotinylation to demonstrate transport of overexpressed green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged TRPC5 to the plasma membrane in response to treatment with epidermal growth factor (EGF). An important question regarding directed translocation of TRPC channels to the plasma membrane is whether channel insertion accounts for or to some degree contributes to the mechanism of channel activation by neurotransmitters and hormones. A correlation between translocation of a mammalian TRP with regulation of channel activity was first made by Kanzaki et al. (29Kanzaki M. Zhang Y.-Q. Mashima H. Li L. Shibata H. Kojima I. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), who showed that insulin-like growth factor I-induced translocation of TRPV2 is responsible for the channel activity that is mediated by the growth factor. The case for a correlation between agonist-induced translocation of TRPC proteins and channel activity has been less clear. In this study we present several new findings that further address the relationship between TRPC translocation and channel activity. First, we have found that under conditions in which agonist-induced TRPC3 activation clearly occurs, TRPC3 translocation to the plasma membrane does not occur. Second, similarly to TRPC5, we have found that TRPC3 translocation to the plasma membrane occurs in response to EGF treatment; however, this increase in surface-expressed TRPC3 channels was not associated with an increase in agonist-induced cation entry. Thus, these results cast doubt on the hypothesis that agonist-induced translocation of TRPC3 to the plasma membrane is necessary for channel activation. Finally, we present evidence that TRPC3 channels undergo constitutive cycling in and out of the plasma membrane, and we suggest that the mechanism of directed trafficking of TRPC3 to the plasma membrane by EGF may involve prevention of re-internalization of these constitutively cycling channels. Reagents—Methacholine, thapsigargin, and 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) were purchased from Calbiochem. EGF was from Upstate, and fura-5F and N-(3-triethylammoniumpropyl)-4-(4-(dibutylamino) styryl)pyridinium dibromide (FM 1-43) were from Invitrogen. All other chemicals and reagents, unless otherwise specified, were from Sigma. TIRF Microscopy—All experiments were carried out using stable TRPC3-GFP-expressing HEK293 cells (30McKay R.R. Szmeczek-Seay C.L. Lièvremont J.-P. Bird G.St.J. Zitt C. Jüngling E. Lückhoff A. Putney Jr., J.W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 735-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) maintained in culture as described previously (31Trebak M. Bird G.St.J. McKay R.R. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21617-21623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). TIRFM was carried out using an Olympus (Melville, NY) IX2-RFAEVA-2 illumination system mounted on an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope. Illumination was provided by a 488-nm argon ion laser (Melles Griot, Carlsbad, CA) directed through a fiber optic cable, and illumination intensity was attenuated as needed by neutral density filters (Chroma Technology Corp., Rockingham, VT). Laser illumination was not toxic to cells, because HEK293 cells loaded with the Ca2+ dye Fluo-3 did not exhibit aberrant Ca2+ release or signs of degeneration when monitored with this system (data not shown). In TIRFM, incident illumination is angled such that it is totally internally reflected at the interface between the glass coverslip and the aqueous medium that bathes the cells. The angle of the illumination incident on the interface between the glass coverslip and aqueous medium was controlled by adjusting the lateral position of the laser beam prior to passing through a TIRFM 60×, 1.45 N.A. oil immersion objective (Olympus). Thus, TIRF illumination was achieved when the incident angle was greater than the critical angle for the glass (n = 1.518) to aqueous (n = 1.37) interface. The emitted fluorescence passed through a D525/50m filter (Chroma) and was captured by a Photometrics Cascade 512F cooled CCD (Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ). Acquisition and analysis of images were performed with MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices Corp., Downington, PA). Cells were grown on glass coverslips and were bathed in Hepes-buffered saline solution (HBSS: in mm, 120 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 0.8 MgCl2, 11 glucose, and 20 Hepes, pH 7.4) in a Teflon chamber at room temperature. Prior to the addition of any agonists, cells were first imaged for 3-5 min to establish the base line. For fluorescence intensity analysis, regions of interest were drawn to encompass the visible footprints of individual cells, based on initial bright field images. Data are presented as the ratio of the fluorescence intensity at each time point divided by the fluorescence intensity at the start of the experiment (F/F0), where each value was background-subtracted to correct for the dark-field noise of the camera. Images were captured every 10 s. Measurements of Ca2+ and Ba2+ Entry—Cells were grown on glass coverslips that were then mounted into Teflon chambers. For fura-5F loading, cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 2 μm fura-5F for 20 min at 37 °C in a humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were then washed in HBSS and allowed to equilibrate for at least 10 min at room temperature prior to the start of the experiments. For Ba2+ measurements, HBSS was replaced with nominally Ca2+-free HBSS, followed by exchange with nominally Ca2+-free HBSS supplemented with 2.0 mm Ba2+. To measure relative intracellular cation concentrations, excitation illumination was alternated between 340 and 380 nm, and emitted fluorescence was captured at 510 nm under the control of a digital fluorescence imaging system (InCyt Im2, Intracellular Imaging Inc., Cincinnati, OH). Pairs of fluorescence intensity measurements were obtained every 10 s. At the end of each experiment, background fluorescence values at 340 and 380 nm excitation were obtained by exposing the cells to 4 μm ionomycin and 20 mm Mn2+; these values were subtracted from each wavelength measurement for each cell, and data are presented as the ratio of the background-subtracted values for excitation at 340 and 380 nm. Because of the fact that some of these measurements represent a mixture of effects of Ba2+ and Ca2+ on fura-5F fluorescence, the data were not calibrated to give estimates of intracellular cation concentration. These experiments were performed at room temperature. Electrophysiology—Macroscopic membrane ion currents and capacitance were recorded using the patch clamp technique in its whole-cell configuration. The currents were acquired using pCLAMP-9.2 (Axon Instruments) and analyzed offline using Origin 6 (Microcal) software. The extracellular solution (osmolarity 310 mosm) contained (in mm) NaCl, 145; KCl, 5; Hepes, 10; MgCl2, 1; CaCl2, 2; pH 7.3 (adjusted with NaOH). The intracellular pipette solution (osmolarity 290 mosm/liter) contained (in mm) cesium methanesulfonate, 145; 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 10; Hepes, 10; MgCl2, 1; CaCl2, 2.2 (100 nm free Ca2+); pH 7.2 (adjusted with CsOH). Patch pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass capillaries (WPI Instruments, Waltham, MA). The resistance of the pipettes varied between 3 and 5 megohms. Necessary supplements were added directly to the respective solutions, in concentrations that would not significantly change the osmolarity. Changes in the external solutions were carried out using a multibarrel puffing micropipette with common outflow that was positioned in close proximity to the cell under investigation. During the experiment, the cell was continuously superfused with the solution via a puffing pipette to reduce possible artifacts related to changes between static and moving solutions. Surface Biotinylation—TRPC3-GFP expressing HEK293 cells were grown to ∼95% confluency on poly-d-lysine-coated 100-mm plates. Following agonist treatments (performed on-dish in HBSS), cells were washed four times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: in mm, 137 NaCl, 2.7 KCl, 8.1 Na2HPO4, 136.1 KH2PO4, pH 8.0), and then incubated in 1 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) in PBS for 20 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed four times in ice-cold PBS containing 100 mm glycine to quench the biotinylation reaction and lysed in lysis buffer (LB: in mm, 50 Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 NaCl, 1 EDTA, 1% v/v Nonidet P-40, 0.25% w/v sodium deoxycholate, 1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor Mixture Tablet (Roche Applied Science)) for 20 min on ice. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and equal amounts of protein were incubated with Neutravidin beads (Pierce) overnight at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were then washed four times in LB and boiled for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer with 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Recovered proteins were then analyzed by Western blot as described previously (32Vazquez G. Wedel B.J. Kawasaki B.T. Bird G.S. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40521-40528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Blots were probed with anti-GFP rabbit serum (Invitrogen) to detect TRPC3-GFP. Blots were then stripped and reprobed with anti-pan cadherin polyclonal antibody (AbCam, Cambridge, MA) to normalize for equal amounts of surface-expressed proteins. We confirmed that the biotinylation protocol did not pull down cytoplasmic proteins by reprobing blots with anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The secondary antibody used for all probings was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti rabbit IgG (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). Band intensities were quantified by densitometry. Statistical Analyses—Comparisons among three or more data groups were made by analysis of variance and between two groups by Student's t test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Agonists That Activate TRPC3 Do Not Stimulate TRPC3 Translocation—The original goal of this project was to determine whether agonists that induce TRPC3 channel activity, such as those that act through Gq-coupled receptor pathways, increase trafficking of TRPC3 channels to the plasma membrane and ultimately whether such putative trafficking plays a role in the activation or regulation of channel activity. We utilized TIRFM to monitor, in real time, the dynamics of TRPC3 channels in or near the plasma membrane in HEK293 cells stably expressing TRPC3-GFP. With TIRFM, the evanescent wave of illumination penetrates only ∼200 nm into the sample; thus, only fluorophores that are located within 200 nm of the plasma membrane are illuminated and contribute to the TIRFM image (33Axelrod D. Traffic. 2001; 2: 764-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 34Steyer J.A. Almers W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). TIRFM images of TRPC3-GFP cells revealed numerous individual punctae of GFP fluorescence, likely indicative of individual TRPC3-GFP-containing structures (see Figs. 1A and 7A for representative images). Over time, many of these foci of fluorescence disappeared from the image, and new points of fluorescence appeared in different regions of the cell (see supplemental movie), which may be indicative of constitutive trafficking of TRPC3-GFP to and from the plasma membrane (35Royle S.J. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Upon treatment of these cells with 300 μm methacholine, a concentration that resulted in maximal activation of TRPC3 channel activity (30McKay R.R. Szmeczek-Seay C.L. Lièvremont J.-P. Bird G.St.J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 21617-21623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) (data not shown), we failed to observe an increase in the number or intensity of fluorescent punctae in TIRFM images over a time course of 15 min (Fig. 1B). Because methacholine activates TRPC3 within seconds following application to cells overexpressing the channel, this result indicates that movement of TRPC3 channels to the plasma membrane is unlikely to be a requisite step in the activation mechanism of TRPC3 channel activity. In agreement with this, we also found that OAG, a membrane-permeant analog of DAG, failed to induce an increase in fluorescence intensity in TIRFM images of TRPC3-GFP cells (Fig. 1B). Likewise, depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores with thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, was also without effect (data not shown). Note that in our hands HEK293 cells not transfected with TRPC3 constructs do not respond to PLC-linked agonists or to diacylglycerols under the experimental conditions used in this study (23Trebak M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 16244-16252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), ensuring that the Ca2+, Ba2+, and electrophysiological signals can be attributed to the expressed, GFP-tagged TRPC3 channels that give rise to the TIRFM images.FIGURE 7Gd3+ induces an increase in peripheral TRPC3-GFP fluorescence. A bright field image of a field of HEK293 cells expressing TRPC3-GFP (A, left panel) was used to define the boundaries of individual cells. A TIRFM image of the same field of cells prior to Gd3+ addition is shown in the center panel. The arrow indicates a cell that exhibited numerous individual foci of fluorescence, likely indicative of individual TRPC3-GFP-containing vesicles. The arrowhead indicates a cell that, although clearly visible in the bright field image, did not exhibit any detectable fluorescence in the TIRFM image; it is likely that this cell was not fully attached to the coverslip so as to be within the range of depth of TIRFM illumination, and such cells that were not visible under conditions of TIRFM illumination were not used in further analyses. A TIRFM image taken 480 s after the addition of Gd3+ (100 μm) is shown in the right panel. B, fluorescence intensity plot corresponding to a region of interest encompassing the cell defined by the arrow in the A. C, summarized fluorescence intensity data collected at 15 min following the addition of a range of Gd3+ concentrations from 1 to 100 μm.

Following a recent report by Bezzerides et al. (28Bezzerides V.J. Ramsey I.S. Kotecha S. Greka A. Clapham D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) showing that EGF causes movement of TRPC5 channels to the plasma membrane, we evaluated the effect of EGF on TRPC3 trafficking. Similarly to its effect on TRPC5 localization, EGF (150 ng/ml) also induced an increase in peripheral TRPC3-GFP localization as evaluated by TIRFM (Fig. 1). In the fluorescence intensity profile shown in Fig. 1B, the EGF-induced net movement of TRPC3-GFP to the plasma membrane initiated rapidly and was maximal within 5 min of EGF addition; however, other cells were slower to react, requiring up to 15 min to respond maximally (not shown). On average, an increase of ∼50% in peripheral TRPC3-GFP fluorescence was observed 15 min following EGF addition (Fig. 1C). To control for possible contributions of changes in cellular or membrane morphology to the TIRFM data, we found that EGF did not induce a significant change in the fluorescence detectable by TIRFM in cells treated with the membrane dye FM 1-43 (data not shown). One caveat of the TIRFM method is that it does not allow one to determine whether a given protein fused to a fluorophore is inserted into the plasma membrane or is merely located in very close proximity to the membrane (i.e. within the 200 nm depth of TIRFM illumination). Thus, we performed surface biotinylation studies to determine whether cell surface expression of TRPC3-GFP increases in response to EGF treatment. TRPC3-GFP cells were treated with membrane-impermeant biotin to tag proteins on the cell surface only, and biotin-labeled proteins were then captured with avidin beads. When the avidin-precipitated samples were analyzed by Western blot with an anti-GFP antibody, a band appeared at ∼130 kDa, the expected molecular mass of TRPC3-GFP (Fig. 2). More importantly, the intensity of this band significantly increased when cells were treated for 15 min with EGF (150 ng/ml) prior to biotin application, confirming that EGF induces an increase in membrane insertion of TRPC3-GFP. This increase was prevented by pretreatment of cells with 10 nm wortmannin (Fig. 2), an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, a result similar to that reported previously for TRPC5 (28Bezzerides V.J. Ramsey I.S. Kotecha S. Greka A. Clapham D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we again failed to detect an increase in surface-expressed TRPC3-GFP in response to treatment of cells with methacholine (Fig. 2) or thapsigargin (data not shown). EGF Does Not Increase [Ca2+]i or Affect the [Ca2+]i Response to OAG—Interestingly, the increased number of TRPC3 channels in the plasma membrane induced by EGF did not result in a significant [Ca2+]i signal (Fig. 3). We expected, as confirmed below with Ba2+ entry experiments, that the increase in channels in the plasma membrane would result in a corresponding increase in constitutive TRPC3-mediated cation entry; however, it is likely that the modest increase in constitutively active channels does not produce enough Ca"
https://openalex.org/W1973735828,"Control of fatty acid homeostasis is crucial to prevent insulin resistance. During fasting, the plasma fatty acid level depends on triglyceride lipolysis and fatty acid re-esterification within fat cells. In rodents, Rosiglitazone® controls fatty acid homeostasis by stimulating two pathways in the adipocytes, glyceroneogenesis and glycerol phosphorylation, that provide the glycerol 3-phosphate necessary for fatty acid re-esterification. Here, we analyzed the functionality of both pathways for controlling fatty acid release in subcutaneous adipose tissue samples from lean and overweight women before and after Rosiglitazone® ex vivo treatment. In controls, pyruvate, used as a substrate of glyceroneogenesis, could contribute to the re-esterification of up to 65% of the fatty acids released after basal lipolysis, whereas glycerol phosphorylation accounted for only 14 ± 9%. However, the efficiency of glyceroneogenesis diminished as body mass index (BMI) of women increased. After Rosiglitazone treatment, increase of either pyruvate- or glycerol-dependent fatty acid re-esterification was strictly correlated to that of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glycerol kinase, the key enzymes of each pathway, but depended on BMI of the women. Whereas the Rosiglitazone® responsiveness of glyceroneogenesis was rather constant according to the BMI of the women, glycerol phosphorylation was mostly enhanced in lean women (BMI < 27). Overall, these data indicate that, whereas glyceroneogenesis is more utilized than glycerol phosphorylation for fatty acid re-esterification in human subcutaneous adipose tissue in the physiological situation, both are solicited in response to Rosiglitazone® but with lower efficiency when BMI is increased.

Although TZD target the γ isoform of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARγ) (1Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3447) Google Scholar), a nuclear receptor mainly expressed in adipose tissue (AT) and scantily in skeletal muscles, TZD exert their major effect on insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscles. To clarify this peculiar mechanism, numerous studies have revealed that in addition to their effects on the secretion of some adipocytokines (for a review, see Ref. 2Rangwala S.M. Lazar M.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 331-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), TZD reduced plasma nonesterified fatty acid (FA) levels, therefore preventing FA from opposing insulin action on skeletal muscle and other insulin target tissues. Indeed, evidence is emerging that elevated plasma FA levels contribute to the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome (3Boden G. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), and plasma FA is increased at the onset of diabetes in diabetic obese Zucker rats (4Lee Y. Hirose H. Ohneda M. Johnson J.H. McGarry J.D. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10878-10882Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). One of the proposed mechanisms is that TZD trigger the differentiation of preadipocytes into mature, small, insulin-sensitive, and metabolically active adipocytes able to clear away excessive FA from the circulation (5Adams M. Montague C.T. Prins J.B. Holder J.C. Smith S.A. Sanders L. Digby J.E. Sewter C.P. Lazar M.A. Chatterjee V.K. O'Rahilly S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 3149-3153Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), thus resulting in a slight competition of FA with glucose for uptake by skeletal muscles and an enhancement of insulin-mediated glucose uptake (6Randle P. Garland P. Hales C. Newsholme E. Lancet. 1963; 1: 785-789Abstract PubMed Scopus (3743) Google Scholar). Another mechanism for TZD capacity to reduce plasma FA levels has been recently highlighted (7Guan H.P. Li Y. Jensen M.V. Newgard C.B. Steppan C.M. Lazar M.A. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1122-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 8Tordjman J. Chauvet G. Quette J. Beale E.G. Forest C. Antoine B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18785-18790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). TZD induce a futile metabolic cycle that increases FA recycling by a re-esterification process in AT, resulting in a decreased output to the blood. Physiologically, this pathway is activated in lipolytic situations like fasting, when triglycerides (TG) are hydrolyzed to produce glycerol and FA (9Vaughan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3354-3358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Re-esterification supposedly acts as a retro-control pathway for reducing FA release. For this to occur, glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) synthesis is required. During fasting, G3P does not significantly come from glucose or from glycerol, since glycerol kinase (GyK) activity is very weak in white AT. An additional G3P-synthesizing pathway, named glyceroneogenesis (GNG), was recently highlighted (10Beale E.G. Hammer R.E. Antoine B. Forest C. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1695-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). GNG was first described by Reshef et al. (reviewed in Ref. 11Reshef L. Olswang Y. Cassuto H. Blum B. Croniger C.M. Kalhan S. Tilghman S.M. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30413-30416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) as the provider of G3P, in the lipolytic situation, from non-carbohydrate substrates like lactate and pyruvate; its key enzyme is the cytosolic isoform of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK-C), whose gene expression is strongly induced in fasting. Pharmacologically, in response to TZD, FA re-esterification is enhanced by the activation of both GNG and glycerol phosphorylation (GP) in rodents (7Guan H.P. Li Y. Jensen M.V. Newgard C.B. Steppan C.M. Lazar M.A. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1122-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 8Tordjman J. Chauvet G. Quette J. Beale E.G. Forest C. Antoine B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18785-18790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), where both PEPCK-C and GyK gene expression are positively controlled by PPARγ ligands in adipocytes (7Guan H.P.

Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 933-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The participation of both pathways in human AT was only assumed by means of TZD-induced expression of PEPCK-C and GyK genes (7Guan H.P. Li Y. Jensen M.V. Newgard C.B. Steppan C.M. Lazar M.A. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1122-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 13Duplus E. Benelli C. Reis A.F. Fouque F. Velho G. Forest C.

Diabetes Care. 2004; 27: 1660-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In the present work, we appreciated for the first time the functionality of GNG and GP for controlling FA release in cultured explants from human subcutaneous AT (SCAT). Physiologically, GNG was found to be the major pathway involved but with an efficiency that decreased when body mass index (BMI) increased. Pharmacologically, both pathways significantly contributed to the hypolipidemic action of Rosiglitazone (Rosi) but were less responsive to this drug in obese subjects. Culture of Explants and Monitoring of FA Re-esterification—SCAT was obtained from 16 healthy young women (age = 36.3 ± 4.1) with BMI from 20 to 33 (average BMI = 27.1 ± 4.2). All patients were undergoing elective surgery at Cochin Hospital (Director Prof. C. Chapron) and had given informed consent. Samples were transported in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 5 mm glucose and then cut into small pieces of about 30–50 mg, distributed in 12-well culture plates with about 400 mg/well, and incubated in 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5 mm glucose, containing biotin, pantothenate, and antibiotics as described (12Glorian M. Duplus E. Beale E.G. Scott D.K. Granner D.K. Forest C. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 933-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2 at 37 °C. Medium was changed every day, with or without 1 μm Rosi for 3 days. At day 3, samples were incubated in glucose- and serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 4 h before incubation with radioisotopes. Then the study of GNG or GP involvement in FA re-esterification was performed as follows. The medium of each well was replaced with 1 ml of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 3% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (catalog number A6003; Sigma) and either no added substrate or [14C1]pyruvate (1 μCi/ml) or [14C]glycerol (2 μCi/ml) as precursors of G3P. The isotopic dilution of radiolabeled substrates was kept constant at about 1:130. After 1 h, the incubation medium was discarded for the estimation of lipolytic FA and glycerol. Simultaneously, the corresponding tissue fragments were frozen in liquid nitrogen before lipid extraction according to the simplified method of Bligh and Dyer (15Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 371: 911-917Crossref Scopus (42411) Google Scholar). The subsequent [14C1]pyruvate or [14C]glycerol incorporation into the lipid moiety was estimated by counting the radioactivity associated with this fraction and was used to appreciate the level of FA that have been re-esterified during the lipolytic process. In the experiments carried out under acute lipolytic conditions, 1 μm isoproterenol was added in the incubation medium. For each SCAT, some explants were frozen at day 3 for the determination of PEPCK-C and GyK activities. Unfortunately, some of these parameters have not been evaluated in some SCAT sample because of their too low quantity. This explains why some values are missing for a given individual (or BMI). Biochemistry—PEPCK-C and GyK activities were estimated in a postmitochondrial fraction, prepared from frozen AT previously homogenized in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm dithiotrotreitol. PEPCK-C enzymatic activity was determined as described by Duff et al. (16Duff D.A. Snell K. Biochem. J. 1982; 206: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) by the acute radioactive method of Chang and Lane (17Chang H.C. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2413-2420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with saturating substrate concentration and 1:30 isotope dilution of [14C]NaHCO3. GyK activity was measured using the radioactive method of Newsholme et al. (18Newsholme E. Robinson J. Taylor K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 132: 338-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) with 0.3 mm [3H]glycerol (i.e. nonsaturating substrate concentration). Both reactions were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Protein content was determined using the BCA protein assay kit from Sigma. Concentrations of glycerol and FA released in the Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer were monitored using the glycerol UV method and the acyl-CoA oxidase kits from Roche Applied Science. Calculation of GNG-dependent FA Re-esterification—Hydrolysis of 1 mol of TG leads to 1 mol of glycerol and 3 mol of FA, thus giving a FA/glycerol ratio of 3 in the extracellular medium. Each glycerol molecule taken up from the extracellular medium for G3P synthesis via GyK would be esterified by three FA, leaving the FA/glycerol ratio unchanged. In contrast, when GNG is activated, G3P is synthesized from extracellular sources, such as pyruvate or lactate, that could re-esterify 3 mol of FA, thus decreasing the FA/glycerol ratio below 3. Conventional Statistical Analysis—General statistical analysis was performed with JMP statistics software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Correlations were examined by nonparametric Spearman's rank correlation test. p < 0.05. FA Re-esterification in Human SCAT Involves both Glyceroneogenesis and Glycerol Phosphorylation—FA re-esterification in rodent adipocytes requires G3P synthesis, which can be the result of either induced GNG via PEPCK-C (8Tordjman J. Chauvet G. Quette J. Beale E.G. Forest C. Antoine B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18785-18790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) or GP via GyK (7Guan H.P. Li Y. Jensen M.V. Newgard C.B. Steppan C.M. Lazar M.A. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1122-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). To estimate whether these pathways were effective in humans, we evaluated both specific activities of key enzymes and their functionality in the same human SCAT samples, 3 days after removal the “explants” being cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence or absence of 1 μm Rosi before the isolation of a postmitochondrial subfraction. PEPCK-C specific activity was determined with saturating substrate concentration and found to be dispersed from 0.05 to 0.4 nmol/min/mg protein (Fig. 1A). The overweight women exhibited the lowest activities, and a significant inverse correlation between PEPCK-C activity and BMI (r2 = 0.30) was observed. GyK specific activities were weaker than those of PEPCK-C, with an average of 4.83 ± 3.96 pmol/min/mg protein (Fig. 1B), partly because of the nonsaturating glycerol concentration used for assaying GyK. When plotted against patient BMI, GyK activities were below 6 pmol/min/mg protein for the major part of the patients, with the exception of two overweight women who exhibited higher values (Fig. 1B). Thus, it seems that PEPCK-C and GyK are not identically efficient in the SCAT of subjects according to their BMI, PEPCK-C being more active in lean people and GyK in some overweight patients. We then determined the incorporation of radiolabeled [14C1]pyruvate as a glyceroneogenic precursor or of [14C]glycerol for GP into the neosynthesized TG in human SCAT. No exogenous FA was added in the assay buffer to ascertain the occurrence of a re-esterification of FA coming directly from basal lipolysis of preexisting TG in SCAT explants. We used pyruvate that was radiolabeled in C1 exclusively, because the C1 cannot be incorporated into acyl-CoA for FA synthesis. Therefore, [14C1]pyruvate is a marker of the G3P moiety of TG that arises from GNG only. In such experimental conditions, dispersed values from 1 to 16 nmol of pyruvate incorporated into TG/h/g of AT were obtained (Fig. 1C). These results confirmed the existence of a GNG-dependent FA re-esterification process in human SCAT, but its efficiency decreased as BMI increased (r2 = 0.31). We ascertained the involvement of PEPCK-C in this process by adding a PEPCK-C inhibitor (19Watford M. Vinay P. Lemieux G. Gougoux A. Can. J. Biochem. 1980; 58: 440-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), 3-mercaptopicolinate, during the experiment. 140 μm 3-mercaptopicolinate was able to lower by 40% the amount of pyruvate incorporated into TG (results not shown). The involvement of GyK in FA re-esterification was analyzed by providing [14C]glycerol as the precursor of G3P (Fig. 1D). The average contribution of GyK to FA re-esterification was found to be ∼2.24 ± 0.95 nmol/h/g of AT (i.e. 6-fold lower than that of GNG for lean people although in the same order of magnitude for overweight subjects) (Fig. 1, compare C and D). Impact of FA Re-esterification on FA Release in Human SCAT—We then checked whether the FA re-esterification capacity of human SCAT was related to differences in FA release in the extracellular medium and investigated the respective involvement of GNG and GyK in this process. Since only FA re-esterification via GNG would result in a reduction in the FA/glycerol ratio (as explained under “Experimental Procedures”), the variation of this ratio could be theoretically used to appreciate the participation of GNG in FA release. We first verified if this ratio was dependent on PEPCK-C activity in three subjects with a BMI around 27 by using the PEPCK-C inhibitor, 3-mercaptopicolinate (Fig. 2A). In control, the FA/glycerol ratio was found to be 1.84 instead of the theoretical value of 3, showing that 1.16 μmol of FA/μmol of lipolyzed TG had been already cleared from the extracellular medium. In the presence of 3-mercaptopicolinate, this ratio increased to 2.8, confirming that the majority of these 1.16 μmol of cleared FA had been re-esterified to TG via GNG in a PEPCK-C-dependent manner. Since this was observed in the absence of added pyruvate, results suggested that residual intracellular substrates for GNG were still present in the SCAT samples, already allowing re-esterification of about 39% of FA generated during lipolysis. When pyruvate was added in the medium, the FA/glycerol ratio decreased in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). At the supraphysiological concentration of 25 mm pyruvate, up to 65% FA had been re-esterified via GNG. This meant that only one-third of FA that came from lipolysis was released in the extracellular medium in our experimental conditions and when pyruvate availability was not limiting. The amount of FA that could be cleared from the culture medium in response to the addition of 2.5 mm pyruvate (figuring physiological concentration) in comparison with no added exogenous substrate (Fig. 2C) was found to range between 250 and 950 nmol/μmol of lipolyzed TG (i.e. between 8 and 31%), with a significant inverse correlation with BMI (r2 = 0.57), as found previously for PEPCK-C activity and for [14C1]pyruvate incorporation into TG. Furthermore, for each subject, the amount of cleared FA was found to be correlated to the proportion of [14C1]pyruvate that had been incorporated into the neosynthesized TG in the presence of 2.5 mm pyruvate (r2 = 0.65) (Fig. 2B). GyK-dependent FA re-esterification was appreciated by comparing the FA concentration in the extracellular medium after a 1-h incubation of the explants with or without 1 mm glycerol. The latter concentration is 4-fold higher than that obtained during basal lipolysis (about 0.25 mm under our experimental conditions) and somehow mimics the glycerol concentration obtained after isoproterenol-induced lipolysis (3-fold induction as observed in Fig. 6A). Under such conditions, a glycerol-related clearance of 422 ± 264 nmol of FA/μmol of hydrolyzed TG (i.e. from 5 to 23%) was observed in SCAT (Fig. 2D). The elevated S.E. value was due to the very high values obtained with SCAT from two overweight patients. FA Re-esterification Is a Target for Rosiglitazone Action—We examined whether Rosi stimulated PEPCK-C and GyK specific activities in 16 human SCAT explants and if their FA re-esterification capacity increased in a parallel manner. PEPCK-C activity was increased by an average of 1.63 ± 0.38-fold (Fig. 3A) by a 3-day treatment with 1 μm Rosi. Simultaneously, [14C1]pyruvate incorporation into TG was induced 1.73 ± 0.32-fold (Fig. 3B). Three obese individuals with BMI of 29 and 33 were not responsive to Rosi and were not taken into account for calculating the mean ± S.E. value. We found a highly significant correlation between the increase in PEPCK-C activity and function (i.e. [14C1]pyruvate incorporation) (Fig. 3C, r2 = 0.68). In contrast, GyK activity was mostly induced by Rosi in subjects with BMI from 20 to 27 (range 2.5–9-fold) except for one with a BMI of 29, which showed a 5-fold induction (Fig. 3D). In overweight and obese individuals, a null or weak induction was observed. [14C]Glycerol incorporation into TG reflected the observed Rosi-induced stimulation of GyK activity (Fig. 3E). In both cases, we found correlation coefficients r2 of 0.65 and 0.53, confirming that both Rosi induction of GyK activity and that of GyK-dependent FA re-esterification were inversely correlated to BMI. Additionally, the increase in GyK activity and [14C]glycerol incorporation into TG were positively correlated (r2 = 0.37; Fig. 3F). Hence, both GNG and GP are functionally induced by Rosi, GyK being more inducible than PEPCK-C in lean subjects. Comparative Rate of Both FA Re-esterification Pathways after Rosi Treatment of Human SCAT—After Rosi treatment, the rate of pyruvate incorporated into lipids ranged from 30 to 1 nmol/h/g of AT and still significantly decreased inversely proportionally to BMI (r2 = 0.45, Fig. 4A) like it did in control (Fig. 1C). In contrast, the involvement of GP in FA re-esterification changed between the physiological and Rosi-induced states (Fig. 4B). Weak and rather constant in control with an average of 2.24 nmol of incorporated glycerol/h/g of AT (Fig. 1D), the GyK-dependent FA re-esterification tended also to decrease with BMI in response to Rosi (r2 = 0.26, p = 0.07) and now ranged from 6 to 1.5 nmol/h/g of AT. Thus, it seemed that, following Rosi treatment, the contribution of both pathways became of similar importance in overweight women and were both diminishing with increased BMI. In only one-fourth of the individuals (three of them having a BMI below 27 and the fourth one a BMI of 30 perhaps associated with a gynoidic obesity), the contribution of pyruvate-dependent FA re-esterification still remained quantitatively the major one and was 5-fold that of glycerol. Contribution of the GyK-dependent FA Re-esterification Pathway in the Control of FA Release from Rosi-treated Human SCAT—Glycerol release is usually considered as the physiological index of lipolysis because of the negligible GyK activity commonly observed in human AT. However, when GyK gene expression is pharmacologically induced by Rosi, some of the released glycerol molecules could be used back for FA re-esterification, hence decreasing the amount of glycerol from the culture medium. Indeed, under our experimental conditions, we usually found a decrease in the level of released glycerol in almost all of the Rosi-treated SCAT explants when compared with their respective controls (Fig. 5A). This effect was independent from G3P precursor availability and affected an average of 27.7% of the amount of released glycerol. Thus, lipolysis was found to generate an average of 765 ± 277 nmol of glycerol/h/g of AT in control SCAT and of 553 ± 134 nmol of glycerol/h/g (p < 0.2) in SCAT that was pretreated with Rosi. If these cleared glycerol molecules had been used for G3P production, thus allowing FA re-esterification via GyK, their disappearance from the medium should correlate with an increase in their incorporation into TG of the corresponding Rosi-treated SCAT explants. As shown in Fig. 5B, there is indeed a highly significant correlation (r2 = 0.57) between glycerol clearance and incorporation into lipids in response to Rosi treatment versus control. Then we tried to estimate the number of FA molecules that could have been re-esterified via GyK in response to Rosi treatment by multiplying by 3 the number of cleared glycerol molecules (Fig. 5C). Results suggest that the control of FA homeostasis via Rosi-induced glycerol phosphorylation is important, especially in lean subjects, and confirm that it significantly decreases with increased BMI (r2 = 0.54). In Rosi-treated SCAT from lean individuals, GyK seems to be responsible for sequestrating about 1200 nmol of FA/μmol of lipolyzed TG (i.e. 40%) (i.e. about 3-fold more in Rosi-pretreated SCAT than in lean controls) (Fig. 5C, empty circles). However, this effect only concerns about 600 nmol/μmol of lipolyzed TG (i.e. 20%) in overweight subjects (Fig. 5C). These estimated data corroborate the results obtained when the [14C]glycerol incorporation into TG was directly estimated (Fig. 4B) and clearly confirm the existence of an efficient GyK-dependent FA re-esterification in response to Rosi in lean subjects, which decreases with increased BMI. Contribution of Glyceroneogenesis to the Control of FA Release from Rosi-treated Human SCAT—The involvement of GNG in the control of FA homeostasis was appreciated, as explained under “Experimental Procedures,” by the calculation of the FA/glycerol ratio in the culture medium after 1 h of basal lipolysis and in the presence of 2.5 mm pyruvate (Fig. 6A). The FA/glycerol ratio was found to be 1.17 ± 0.21 nmol/h/g of AT whatever the BMI (20Hammond V.A. Johnston D.G.

This is in agreement with the score of 50–65% GNG-dependent re-esterified FA as estimated for three individuals with a BMI of 27 (Fig. 2A). When the SCAT explants were pretreated for 3 days with Rosi, this ratio decreased by half to 0.64 ± 0.18 nmol/h/g of AT, and the percentage of released FA decreased from 40% to about 20% of those generated by lipolysis of 1 μm TG and to only 30% in the presence of 140 μm 3-mercaptopicolinate, confirming the involvement of PEPCK-C.

Despite considerable effort, the etiology of these devastating diseases remains unclear. Although polypeptides with glutamine tracts recapitulate many of the observed characteristics of the gene products with CAG repeats, such as in vitro and in vivo aggregation and toxicity in model organisms, extended polyglutamine segments have also been reported to structurally perturb proteins into which they are inserted. Additionally, the sequence context of a polyglutamine tract has recently been shown to modulate its propensity to aggregate.

Destabilization of an adjacent domain may lead to loss of function, as well as favoring non-native structures in the neighboring domain causing them to be prone to intermolecular association and consequent aggregation. To explore these phenomena, we have used chimeras of a well studied globular protein and exon 1 of huntingtin. We find that expansion of the polyglutamine segment beyond the pathological threshold (>35 glutamines) results in structural perturbation of the neighboring protein whether the huntingtin exon is N- or C-terminal. Elongation of the polyglutamine region also substantially increases the propensity of the chimera to aggregate, both in vitro and in vivo, and in vitro aggregation kinetics of a chimera with a 53-glutamine repeat follow a nucleation polymerization mechanism with a monomeric nucleus.

Despite the functional and structural dissimilarity among the poly(Q)-containing proteins and the distinct pathologies they produce, each forms intranuclear inclusion bodies whose role in the disease pathogenesis is still controversial (4Ross C.A. Neuron. 2002; 35: 819-822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). In all of the poly(Q)-repeat diseases, there is a remarkable threshold effect of the length of the poly(Q) tract, which is inversely correlated with the age of onset and disease severity (5Margolis R.L. Ross C.A. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 479-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the specific case of HD, the elongated CAG repeat encoding a stretch of glutamines is located within the N-terminal exon 1 of the gene encoding the 350-kDa protein `huntingtin' (htt). Poly(Q) repeats in the protein huntingtin (Htt) below the threshold value of 35 are not associated with HD; whereas repeats over 36 residues cause neurodegenerative dysfunction, and longer repeats are characterized by an earlier age of onset (1Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). In ataxin-3, linked to type 3 spinocerebellar ataxia (Machado-Joseph disease), the poly(Q) repeat is located in the C-terminal portion of the protein, and there is a similar correlation of repeat length with disease severity and onset (6Kawaguchi Y. Okamoto T. Taniwaki M. Aizawa M. Inoue M. Katayama S. Kawakami H. Nakamura S. Nishimura M. Akiguchi I. Kimura J. Narumiya S. Kakizuka A. Nat.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4307-4318Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), raising the possibility of pathological mechanisms apart from aggregation.Although much of the pathology of CAG-repeat disorders can be attributed to the behavior of the poly(Q) segments, several studies have shown that the context of the poly(Q) tract must also be considered (21Nozaki K. Onodera O. Takano H. Tsuji S. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 3357-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 22Wetzel R.B. Wells R. Ashizawa T. Genetic Instabilities and Neurological Disorders. 2nd Ed.

Recent work shows that the presence of a proline-rich extension C-terminal to a poly(Q) tract modulates its conformational behavior and decreases its tendency to aggregate (24Bhattacharyya A. Thakur A.K. Chellgren V.M. Thiagarajan G. Williams A.D. Chellgren B.W. Creamer T.P. Wetzel R. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 524-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In exon 1 of huntingtin, the glutamine-rich tract is followed by a proline-rich region, which, based on this recent study, diminishes its aggregation propensity. In turn, effects on protein domains adjacent to glutamine-rich repeats may play a direct role in aggregation mechanisms. Incorporation of a Gly-Gln10-Gly peptide into chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) led to formation of dimeric and trimeric oligomers by the normally monomeric CI2 (25Stott K. Blackburn J.M. Butler P.J. Perutz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6509-6513Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). No perturbations in the structure of the CI2 were reported. By contrast, insertion of poly(Q) tracts longer than the pathological threshold into an otherwise stable protein (myoglobin) at the site of a surface-exposed loop caused modest structural perturbation and concomitant increase in aggregation propensity (26Tanaka M. Morishima I. Akagi T. Hashikawa T. Nukina N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45470-45475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 27Tanaka M. Machida Y. Nishikawa Y. Akagi T. Morishima I. Hashikawa T. Fujisawa T. Nukina N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10277-10286Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although in this case the structural perturbation was mild and did not appear to involve the core packing, the fact that myoglobin is very stable and contains a heme cofactor may have led it to be more robust.By comparison, Bevivino and Loll (28Bevivino A.E. Loll P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11955-11960Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) found that increasing the length of a glutamine repeat in the protein ataxin-3 from non-pathogenic (n = 27) to a pathogenic length (n = 78) was accompanied by significant structural destabilization as well as enhanced propensity to aggregate. To carry out experiments on the protein carrying a 78-residue-long glutamine repeat, these authors used constructs with ataxin-3 linked to a solubility-enhancing fusion partner, maltose-binding protein. Their findings appeared to be supported by another study of a non-pathological variant of the protein ataxin-3, which was observed to form fibrillar aggregates upon partial denaturation using guanidine HCl (29Chow M.K. Paulson H.L. Bottomley S.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This result implicates partially folded forms of protein domains neighboring poly(Q) tracts in the mechanism of aggregation. Recently, however, the same group has concluded that extending the poly(Q) tract in ataxin-3 does not destabilize the protein (30Chow M.K. Ellisdon A.M. Cabrita L.D. Bottomley S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47643-47651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the latter study the authors were forced to use pH denaturation and kinetics of unfolding/folding to obtain stability data, because aggregation processes confounded the use of chaotropes such as guanidinium hydrochloride. They concluded that the length-dependent influence of the poly(Q) region was not on the native state of the flanking domain but rather on a fibrillogenic state. Moreover, they speculated that a flanking sequence may exert a restraining force on poly(Q) segments, modulating their aggregation propensities. Provocatively, in a recent study it is reported that the AXH domain of ataxin-3 has an intrinsic tendency to aggregate even in the absence of an adjacent poly(Q) tract (23de Chiara C. Menon R.P. Dal Piaz F. Calder L. Pastore A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). All of these studies, while not uniform in their conclusions, point to the importance of understanding how poly(Q) tracts influence the sequences around them, and in turn how adjacent sequences may influence the behavior of poly(Q) repeats, to better understand CAG-repeat diseases.Examining how a poly(Q) sequence may influence an otherwise stably folded adjacent domain has been limited by the technical difficulties of obtaining well behaved soluble protein, in the presence of sequences that strongly favor aggregation. We have used fusions between cellular retinoic acid binding protein I (CRABP I) and Htt exon 1 for this work; constructs with the poly(Q)-containing sequence attached either at the N or C termini of CRABP I were examined (Fig. 1A).

CRABP I is a 136-amino acid long member of the intracellular lipid- binding protein family. These proteins have a β barrel structure composed of 10 antiparallel β strands, with a short helix-turn-helix between strands 1 and 2, wrapped around a ligand-binding cavity (solvent filled in the absence of ligand) (31Kleywegt G.J. Bergfors T. Senn H. Le Motte P. Gsell B. Shudo K. Jones T.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 1241-1258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 37Thompson J. Bratt J. Banaszak L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In contrast to the recent study of ataxin-3 (30Chow M.K. Ellisdon A.M. Cabrita L.D. Bottomley S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47643-47651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we find that poly(Q) expansion within Htt exon 1 in the pathological range (repeat length of 53) causes structural perturbation and decreased stability of the neighboring CRABP I protein domain as well as increased propensity for aggregation both in vivo and in vitro, whereas a fusion of CRABP I with Htt exon 1 containing a shorter poly(Q) repeat (n = 20) remains soluble with no evidence of structural disruption. The tight correlation of these effects with the poly(Q) length argues that the repeat tract is solely responsible for these perturbations and molecular pathologies. Aggregation in vitro of the CRABP I fusions to Htt exon 1 containing poly(Q) repeats above the pathological threshold showed nucleated polymerization kinetics and fit to a monomeric nucleus size, consistent with a dominant role for the poly(Q) sequence. We incorporated a tetra-Cys sequence within CRABP I to label the expressed protein in the cell with a low molecular weight membranepermeable fluorescent dye, FlAsH (38Griffin A. Adams S.R. Jones J. Tsien R.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In vivo, constructs with pathological poly(Q) repeats (n = 40, 53, or 64) aggregated, and the apparent lag time could be modified by varying the amount of expressed protein, as expected for nucleated polymerization kinetics. This system provides a manipulable model to explore how polyglutamine tracts may influence juxtaposed folded domains; both conformational and energetic factors can be investigated due to the well behaved nature of these constructs. We speculate that the nature of the CRABP I structure and its moderate stability may make it susceptible to perturbation from the poly(Q) sequences.MATERIALS AND METHODSConstructs—Tetra-Cys CRABP I (with a FlAsH-binding tetra-Cys motif) behind the T7 promoter was constructed as described (39Ignatova Z. Gierasch L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Upstream of the start codon comprising the NdeI restriction site, a new SalI restriction site necessary for the N-terminal insertion of the htt exon 1 was incorporated using a QuikChange protocol (Stratagene). For the C-terminal fusions, the stop codon and its nearest 3′-flanking region were replaced by XhoI and BamHI restriction sites. Due to the genetic manipulations, two new amino acids (Leu-Glu) were inserted at the C terminus of tetra-Cys CRABP I in the C-terminal fusions. Sequences encoding htt exon 1 with CAG repeats of 20 and 53 were amplified by PCR with NdeI/SalI (lacking a stop codon) or XhoI/BamHI flanking recognition sites from plasmids pGEX-htt20Q and pGEX-htt53Q (gifts from U. Hartl and M. Hayer-Hartl, Max Planck Institute, Martinsried, Germany) (40Muchowski P.J. Schaffar G. Sittler A. Wanker E.E. Hayer-Hartl M.K. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7841-7846Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar); sequences encoding htt exon 1 with 33, 40, and 64 length poly(Q) tracts were amplified with XhoI/BamHI flanking sites from plasmids pPD30.38-Q33-YFP, pPD30.38-40-YFP, and pPD30.38-Q64-YFP, respectively (gifts of R. Morimoto, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL) (11Morley J.F. Brignull H.R. Weyers J.J. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The double-digested PCR products were cloned up- or downstream of the tetra-Cys CRABP I gene yielding N- and C-terminal chimeras of tetra-Cys CRABP and Htt exon 1 with an N-terminal polyhistidine tag (sequence: MGHHHHHHHHHSSGHIEGRH-). The resulting plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing.Protein Expression and Purification—All constructs (see Fig. 1A) were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. Tetra-Cys CRABP I, Htt20 tetra-Cys CRABP (Htt exon 1 fused to the N terminus), and tetra-Cys CRABP Htt20 (Htt exon 1 fused to the C terminus) were purified from the soluble fraction of the cell lysates (39Ignatova Z. Gierasch L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), whereas both the N- and C-terminal tetra-Cys CRABP fusions with Htt53 were isolated from the insoluble fraction after solubilization with 8 m urea (35Clark P.L. Weston B.F. Gierasch L.M. Fold Des. 1998; 3: 401-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Protein solutions (100-150 μm) of tetra-Cys CRABP I and tetra-Cys CRABP Htt20 (N- or C-terminal) were stored at 4 °C and used within 2 weeks. Concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using [cepsilon]280 of 21,750 m-1cm-1 (a corrected value for wild-type CRABP I containing four additional cysteines). Refolding was accomplished by dropwise dilution (100-fold) of the urea-containing protein fractions in 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, or in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, containing 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol (depending on the subsequent step). The refolding efficacy was determined by ligand (retinoic acid) binding, CD spectroscopy, and measurement of the intrinsic Trp fluorescence. The variants with 53 poly(Q) showed a high tendency to aggregate and were stored in dilute stocks (10-15 nm). The protein samples were proteolytically stable for at least 6 days, as evidenced by mass spectrometry. Before use small aliquots were concentrated to the desired concentration using a Centricon system (molecular mass cut-off 10 kDa) at 4 °C and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 10 min to remove aggregates. The properties of refolded tetra-Cys CRABP I Htt53 (N- or C-terminal fusion) were found to be the same as those of protein isolated in very low yield from the soluble fraction 45 min post-induction.In-cell FlAsH-EDT2 Labeling—E. coli BL21(DE3) cells expressing tetra-Cys constructs were labeled as described (39Ignatova Z. Gierasch L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). A 10-fold excess of ethanedithiol (EDT) was added to suppress the labeling of the endogenous cysteine pairs (38Griffin A. Adams S.R. Jones J. Tsien R.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The cells were preloaded with FlAsH-EDT2 one generation prior to induction with 0.4 mm isopropyl γ-d-thiogalactoside at A600 = 1. Aliquots of 150 μl were withdrawn and subjected to fluorescence measurements at 530 nm (bandwidth 2 nm) with excitation at 500 nm (bandwidth 2 nm, Photon Technology International QM-1 fluorometer). The fluorescence of a negative control of CRABP I wild-type expressing cells pre-loaded with FlAsH-EDT2 was subtracted from each point. (Note that FlAsH is now marketed by Invitrogen under the trade name “Lumio.”)Cell Fractionation—10-ml aliquots of cells expressing the tetra-Cys CRABP I variants were harvested by centrifugation and fractionated into soluble and insoluble fractions (39Ignatova Z. Gierasch L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The insoluble fraction was solubilized in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 8 m urea and 2% SDS and centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was re-suspended in 1.5 ml of 20 mm Tris·HCl buffer and defined as the SDS-insoluble fraction. All fractions were analyzed on a 12% SDS-PAGE, and the intensity of the Coomassie-stained bands of interest was detected by optical densitometry (Bio-Rad).Circular Dichroism and Fluorescence—Far-UV CD spectra were collected at 20 °C on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter with a 1-mm path length cell (1 nm bandwidth). The concentration of protein was 5 μm, and each spectrum was an average of five spectra. Fluorescence spectra of 3 μm proteins were taken at 20 °C with an excitation at 280 nm (1 nm slit width) and emission from 300-380 nm (2 nm slit width).Stability Measurements—For the urea unfolding titrations, 3 μm protein (FlAsH-labeled) was diluted in 0-8 m urea containing 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, and incubated for >2 h at 37 °C. Unfolding was monitored at 37 °C by Trp fluorescence (as above). Urea titration curves were fit to a two-state model to derive thermodynamic values. To test proteolytic susceptibility and ability to bind ligand, tetra-Cys CRABP I variants were digested with α-chymotrypsin (α-CT:protein = 1:20 ratio) for 45 min on ice, with and without preincubation with 2.5-fold excess of retinoic acid (5 min in the dark). The reaction was stopped by adding SDS-loading buffer and boiling.Aggregation Time-Course Assays in Vitro—Aliquots of tetra-Cys CRABP I Htt53 (10-15 nm) were labeled with FlAsH-EDT2 for 60 min as described previously (41Ignatova Z. Gierasch L.M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7266-7274Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The diluted labeled tetra-Cys CRABP I Htt53 solutions were concentrated at 4 °C by ultrafiltration (cut-off 10 kDa) and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C. Solutions were used immediately to conduct kinetic experiments. To study the aggregation process in the laboratory at reasonable time scales, the labeled protein was destabilized with 1 m urea (in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8). Aggregation was followed by increasing FlAsH fluorescence or by estimation of the concentration of soluble monomer by absorbance measurements of the clarified supernatant at 280 nm as described (41Ignatova Z. Gierasch L.M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7266-7274Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In both fluorescence and spectroscopic measurements, the samples were incubated without stirring and gently vortexed prior to withdrawal of an aliquot to ensure an equal distribution of the aggregates over the entire volume of the sample. In parallel, the fluorescence and absorbance at 280 nm of controls without protein were recorded for all experiments and subtracted from those of the samples.Seeding Experiments—10 μm FlAsH-labeled tetra-Cys CRABP Htt53 was destabilized by dissolving in 1.0 m urea and incubated overnight at 37 °C without stirring to allow complete aggregation. To improve their seeding potency, the aggregates were sonicated for 2 min in 30-s bursts after washing with equal volumes of water and 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0. Solutions of labeled tetra-Cys CRABP I Htt53 were preincubated to reach the test temperature of 37 °C, then seeded with pre-formed aggregates representing 1%, 5%, and 10% of the initial tetra-Cys CRABP I Htt53 concentration. Aggregation was monitored by FlAsH fluorescence.Determination of Nucleus Size—The time course of in vitro aggregation was analyzed by the mathematical model describing nucleationcontrolled aggregation kinetics developed by Ferrone (42Ferrone F. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 256-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) that has been applied to several cases of protein aggregation (7Chen S. Ferrone F.A. Wetzel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11884-11889Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 41Ignatova Z. Gierasch L.M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7266-7274Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 43Thakur A.K. Wetzel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 17014-17019Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). A plot of the initial rate of aggregate formation (followed by FlAsH fluorescence) or the changes of the soluble monomer concentration versus t2 gives a slope equal to 1/2k2+Kn*c(n*+2), where k+ is the elongation rate, Kn* is the equilibrium constant for the monomer-nucleus equilibrium, c is the concentration of monomer, and n* is the number of monomers in the nucleus. Plotting the log of the slope versus the log of the bulk monomer concentration [ln(slope) = ln(1/2k2+Kn*) + (n* + 2) ln(c)] yields a new slope of n* + 2, which can be used to estimate the size of the critical nucleus.Fluorescence and Electron Microscopy Experiments—Tetra-Cys CRABP I Htt53-expressing cells labeled with FlAsH-EDT2 were harvested at different times after induction and imaged by fluorescence microscopy. Intact inclusion bodies were isolated from tetra-Cys CRABP I Htt53-expressing cells labeled with FlAsH-EDT2 and harvested 4 h post-induction, as described by Oberg et al. (44Oberg K. Chrunyk B.A. Wetzel R. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2628-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) For fluorescence microscopy, 2 μl of labeled cells or aggregates isolated from cells were immobilized in 1% agarose in LB and imaged using a Nikon Eclipse E600 with excitation at 485 nm and a 510 nm emission cut-off filter. For electron microscopy, samples of isolated aggregates were applied to carbon-coated copper grids, stained with 3% (w/v) ammonium molybdate (pH 6.8), and imaged under defocus conditions with a Phillips CM12 microscope operating at 120 kV.RESULTSHtt Exon 1 with an Expanded poly(Q) Tract Causes Aggregation in Vivo—Expression of the fusion proteins in which Htt exon 1 with varying lengths of poly(Q) tracts was attached to the C terminus of tetra-Cys CRABP I (Fig. 1A) was followed by fluorescence at 530 nm (excitation 500 nm) after pre-loading the cells with FlAsH dye as described previously (39Ignatova Z.

https://openalex.org/W2089944303,"Abstract Sodium pumps (αβ dimers) with the α1 isoform of the catalytic (α) subunit are expressed in all cells. Additionally, most cells express Na+ pumps with a second α isoform. For example, astrocytes and arterial myocytes also express Na+ pumps with the α2 isoform. The α2 pumps localize to plasma membrane (PM) microdomains overlying “junctional” sarco-/endoplasmic reticulum (S/ER), but the α1 pumps are more uniformly distributed. To study α2 targeting, we expressed α1/α2 and α2/α1 chimeras and 1-90 and 1-120 amino acid N-terminal peptides in primary cultured mouse astrocytes. Immunocytochemistry revealed that α2/α1 (but not α1/α2) chimeras markedly reduced native α2 (i.e. were “dominant negatives”). N-terminal (1-120 and 1-90 amino acids) α2 (and α3), but not α1 peptides also targeted to the PM-S/ER junctions and were dominant negative for native α2 in astrocytes and arterial myocytes. Thus α2 and α3 have the same targeting sequence. Ca2+ (fura-2) signals in astrocytes expressing the 1-90 α2 peptide were comparable to signals in cells from α2 null mutants (i.e. functionally dominant negative): 1 μm ATP-evoked Ca2+ transients were augmented, and 100 nm ouabain-induced amplification was abolished. Amino acid substitutions in the 1-120 α1 and α2 constructs, and in full-length α1, revealed that Leu-27 and Ala-35 are essential for targeting/tethering the constructs to PM-S/ER junctions."

Several lines of evidence suggest a relative lack of importance of DNA methylation in gene regulation in the extraembryonic tissues when compared with embryonic ones.

The level of DNA methylation of bulk genome changes during mammalian embryogenesis. In the mouse, the paternal contribution of the genome (sperm-derived DNA) undergoes rapid and very likely active demethylation, whereas the maternal contribution of the genome (oocyte DNA) is gradually demethylated in a passive manner until the morula stage (9Mayer W. Niveleau A. Walter J. Fundele R. Haaf T. Nature. 2000; 403: 501-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar, 10Reik W. Dean W. Walter J. Science. 2001; 293: 1089-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar). In the blastocyst, the level of DNA methylation increases by de novo methylation but is much lower in the trophectoderm than in the inner cell mass (11Santos F. Hendrich B. Reik W. Dean W. Dev. Biol. 2002; 241: 172-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). The hypomethylated status of the genome of extraembryonic lineages persists later in postimplantation development (12Chapman V. Forrester L. Sanford J. Hastie N. Rossant J. Nature. 1984; 307: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 13Rossant J. Sanford J.P. Chapman V.M. Andrews G.K. Dev. Biol. 1986; 117: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), rendering the impression that DNA methylation may play a less relevant role in gene regulation in the extraembryonic lineages than in the embryonic lineages. In support of this concept, it has been reported that both maintenance of imprinted X inactivation and maintenance of imprinted expression of some genes on mouse distal chromosome 7 in the extraembryonic lineages are not perturbed by genome-wide demethylation due to genetic ablation of DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) gene (14Tanaka M. Puchyr M. Gertsenstein M. Harpal K. Jaenisch R. Rossant J. Nagy A. Mech. Dev. 1999; 87: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 15Sado T. Fenner M.H. Tan S.S. Tam P. Shioda T. Li E. Dev.

We have previously reported that the enhancer/promoter region of mouse Oct4 gene is hypermethylated in trophectoderm-derived mouse trophoblast stem (TS) cells and in the placenta, both having repressed Oct4 expression. Ectopic Oct4 expression in TS cells treated with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases, and in the Dnmt1-deficient placenta, has suggested that at least on the Oct4 locus, DNA methylation plays an important role in transcriptional regulation in cells/tissues of extraembryonic origin (17Hattori N. Nishino K. Ko Y.G. Hattori N. Ohgane J. Tanaka S. Shiota K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17063-17069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). We have also reported that both de novo methylation and demethylation of some NotI recognition sites occur in a differentiation-dependent manner in rat Rcho-1 cells, a progenitor population of trophoblast giant cells (18Ohgane J. Hattori N. Oda M. Tanaka S. Shiota K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Similarly, in mouse TS cells, equal numbers of NotI sites (15 each out of ∼1,500 analyzed) in the genome were revealed to be methylated or demethylated as the cells were induced to differentiate (19Shiota K. Kogo Y. Ohgane J. Imamura T. Urano A. Nishino K. Tanaka S. Hattori N. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These findings implied that DNA methylation might regulate dynamic changes in gene expression during the differentiation process even of trophoblast cells. However, it remained to be demonstrated whether differentiation status-dependent changes in DNA methylation are indeed involved in the regulation of gene expression in trophoblast cells. In the present study, we analyzed the expression and epigenetic status of the gene encoding the dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 2 (Ddah2) in mouse TS cells and in trophoblastic tissues of postimplantation mouse embryos. The Ddah2 gene has been identified in our attempts to isolate genes differentially expressed between undifferentiated and differentiated TS cells. There is no report to date showing the contribution of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms in the regulation of this gene, but it has a GC-rich and TATA-less promoter region (see Fig. 1A). Our results here suggest that DNA methylation, accompanied by repressive histone modifications, plays a pivotal role in trophoblast stem cell-specific silencing of the Ddah2 gene. TS Cell Culture and Chemical Treatment—The TS cell line used in this study was established from C57BL/6 strain mouse embryo (19Shiota K. Kogo Y. Ohgane J. Imamura T. Urano A. Nishino K. Tanaka S. Hattori N. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and maintained as described previously (20Tanaka S. Kunath T. Hadjantonakis A.K. Nagy A. Rossant J. Science. 1998; 282: 2072-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar) with slight modification. In brief, TS cells were grown in the medium supplemented with 37.5 ng/ml FGF4 (PeproTech, London, UK), 1.5 μg/ml heparin (Sigma), and 80% mouse embryonic fibroblast cell-conditioned medium (CM). Differentiation of TS cells was induced by substituting the medium with one lacking FGF4, heparin, and CM. For treatment with 5-aza-dC (Sigma) and trichostatin A (TSA) (Sigma), TS cells were cultured for 2 days with FGF4, heparin, and CM, and then were cultured for an additional 2 days after the addition of 5-aza-dC (1 or 5 μ) and/or TSA (200 n). All reagents used in this study were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan) unless stated otherwise. Animals and Tissue Preparation—Adult C57BL/6 strain mice were purchased from Charles River Japan (Yokohama, Japan). Noon of the day when a vaginal plug was found was designated as embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5). Postimplantation embryos collected at E6.5 were embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Finetechnical, Tokyo, Japan) and subjected to in situ hybridization and laser microdissection. Frozen sections (6-μm thick) of E6.5 embryos were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and then stained with Mayer's hematoxylin and dried well. Isolation of tissues from the sections was performed using the P.A.L.M. MicroBeam system (P.A.L.M. Microlaser Technologies AG, Bernried, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells of each tissue were pooled (200-500 cells) and stored at -80 °C until used for DNA/RNA extraction. In Situ Hybridization Analysis—In situ hybridization analysis on the frozen sections of E6.5 embryos (6-μm thick) was performed essentially as described (21Hirota S. Ito A. Morii E. Wanaka A. Tohyama M. Kitamura Y. Nomura S. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 15: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Hybridization with digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled antisense RNA (cRNA) probe for Ddah2 was carried out at 55 °C overnight, and hybridized probes were detected using an alkaline phosphataseconjugated anti-DIG Fab fragment (Roche Diagnostics, Tokyo, Japan) and nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Roche Diagnostics). The cDNA clone used to make the Ddah2 cRNA probe (IMAGE clone number 329801) was purchased from Kurabo Industries (Osaka, Japan). RNA Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from cells and tissues with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Northern hybridization analysis was performed by a standard protocol with cRNA probes for Ddah2, Errβ (22Luo J. Sladek R. Bader J.A. Matthyssen A. Rossant J. Giguere V.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar) labeled with DIG-11-uridine triphosphate (Roche Diagnostics). The DIG-labeled probes were detected with a DIG luminescence detection kit (Roche Diagnostics). For RT-PCR analysis, first-strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA (150 ng) using random hexamers and SuperScript first-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). The PCR was carried out with Ddah2-specific primers (5′-CCAGATGATGCAGCTAGTGAC-3′ and 5′-CCACAACTACCCAGCCTCTAT-3′), Errβ-specific primers (5′-CGCTCCCATACGATGACAAGC-3′ and 5′-CATGGCGCTGACTCAGCTCAT-3′), Tpbp-specific primers (5′-CATGACTCCTACAATCTTCC-3′ and 5′-TTTTTGCTTGCCCTTGCCCC-3′), or β-actin-specific primers (5′-GACAACGGCTCCGGCATGTGCAAAG-3′ and 5′-TTCACGGTTGGCCTTAGGGTTCAG-3′). Each PCR reaction was performed under the following conditions: for Ddah2, Errβ, and Tpbp, 95 °C 10 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min, with a final extension 72 °C for 10 min; and for β-actin, 95 °C 10 min, 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min, with a final extension 72 °C for 10 min. Sodium Bisulfite Sequencing—Genomic DNA was extracted as described previously (27Nishino K. Hattori N. Tanaka S. Shiota K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22306-22313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Sodium bisulfite treatment of genomic DNA and sequencing analysis were carried out essentially as described (17Hattori N. Nishino K. Ko Y.G. Hattori N. Ohgane J. Tanaka S. Shiota K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17063-17069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The DNA fragment covering the 5′-flanking sequence of the Ddah2 gene was amplified by PCR using the following set of primers: D2B1F; 5′-GGTGGTGTGCAAAAAGTACAGAGGC-3′, D2B1R; 5′-GCAGTGTCCAGGCCCACCCTGATCC-3′, D2B2F; 5′-ATCAGGGTGGGCCTGGACACTGCTC-3′, D2B2R; 5′-ACCCAGTACAAACCAGACTTAGTCC-3′, D2B3F; 5′-AGACCAGAGGATCTGATGCACAGTC-3′, D2B3R; 5′-AGATTAGAGGATTTGATGTATAGTT-3′. The PCR products were cloned into pGEM-Teasy vector (Promega), and 10 or more clones randomly picked from each of two independent PCRs were sequenced to determine the presence of methylated cytosines. Plasmid Construction—The 5′-flanking fragments of the Ddah2 gene containing sequence -924 to -36 and sequence -609 to -36 were isolated by genomic PCR using specific forward primers (5′-GGGGTACCCCATTGGTCTGGCATCCTGG-3′ and 5′-GGGGTACCCCAGGGCTCTCAAATGAGCA-3′) and a common reverse primer (5′-GAAGATCTTCTAAGACCACGCCCATTCC-3′). The forward primers include the KpnI site at the 5′ end of the sequence, and the reverse primer also includes the BglII site. Each PCR product was cloned into pGL3-Basic vector (Promega), a promoterless luciferase vector. The resultant plasmid constructs were designated as pGL-924 and pGL-609 according to the positions of fragments. To make hybrid constructs, pGL-924 was digested with KpnI and BalI, releasing two DNA fragments. Both fragments were isolated and separately collected. The smaller fragment (-924 to -611) was methylated by SssI methylase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and then religated with the larger fragment, which lacked the region from -924 to -611. As a control, the unmethylated smaller fragment was also religated with the larger fragment. These religated constructs were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified to avoid contamination of unligated fragments. Methylation status of these constructs was verified by bisulfite sequencing. The regionally methylated construct and unmethylated control construct were designated as pGL-me-924 and pGL-um-924, respectively. Transfection and Promoter Luciferase Assays—The TS cells were replated on 24-well plates at 5 × 104 cells per well 1 day prior to transfection and cultured in differentiative condition. All constructs (0.4 μg) were transfected into these cells by using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) with pRL-TK. Luciferase activities were determined using Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) at 72 h after transfection according to the manufacturer's instructions. Promoter activity was normalized via Renilla luciferase activity. Assays were performed three times each in triplicate. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—The ChIP assay was performed with 1 × 106 cells per assay using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) as recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, fixed cells were lysed and sonicated until chromatin fragments become 200 -1,000 bp in size. All antibodies used in this study were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Antibodies against acetylated histone H3 (catalog number 06-599), acetylated histone H4 (catalog number 06-598), dimethylated lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4) (catalog number 07-030), and dimethylated lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9) (catalog number 07-212) were used for immunoprecipitation (IP), and rabbit IgG (catalog number 12-370) was used as a negative control to check the specificity of IP. After IP, recovered chromatin samples were subjected to PCR with the following set of primers: for region I, 5′-CAGAGGATCTGATGCACAGTC-3′ and 5′-CATGTACCCTGTGCCTAGAGT-3′; for region II, 5′-AGTTCATTGGTCTGGCATCCTG-3′ and 5′-GGATGGTGAAGCCTCTGTACT-3′; and for region III, 5′-GATTGTAACCCCACAGCCAG-3′ and 5′-CGAGCTCACGTACGACGAT-3′. The PCR products were run on agarose gel, and the intensity of each band was measured using ImageJ software (version 1.32; National Institutes of Health). Results from two independent experiments performed in triplicate were quantified and averaged. Expression of Ddah2 Gene in Trophoblast Cell Lineage—The TS cell line is derived from trophoblast stem cells localized in the trophectoderm of blastocysts and extraembryonic ectoderm (ExE) of postimplantation embryos (20Tanaka S. Kunath T. Hadjantonakis A.K. Nagy A. Rossant J. Science. 1998; 282: 2072-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). These cells retain an undifferentiated state in the presence of FGF4 and heparin in medium supplemented with 80% CM (stem cell conditions). The removal of FGF4, heparin, or CM induces differentiation into trophoblast subtypes in vitro (20Tanaka S. Kunath T. Hadjantonakis A.K. Nagy A. Rossant J. Science. 1998; 282: 2072-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Errβ is a marker gene of trophoblast stem cells (22Luo J. Sladek R. Bader J.A. Matthyssen A. Rossant J. Giguere V. Nature. 1997; 388: 778-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Mash2 is expressed in the ectoplacental cone (EPC), a reservoir of differentiating trophoblast cells of postimplantation embryos (23Guillemot F. Nagy A. Auerbach A. Rossant J. Joyner A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar); Tpbp is also detected in EPC and further differentiated diploid trophoblast cells in placenta (24Lescisin K.R. Varmuza S. Rossant J. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1639-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Pl-1 is a gene specifically expressed in trophoblast giant cells (25Colosi P. Talamantes F. Linzer D.I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 767-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In TS cell differentiation, Ddah2 expression was repressed under stem cell conditions, whereas it was increased upon induction of differentiation (Fig. 1B). Trophoblast stem cell-specific repression of the Ddah2 gene was also observed in E6.5 embryo by in situ hybridization analysis. Ddah2 was widely expressed in most of the tissues, including EPC, but was barely detectable in ExE close to the extraembryonic-embryonic boundary, a pool of trophoblast stem cells in E6.5 conceptus (Fig. 1C). In further developed placenta, Ddah2 continued to be expressed at high levels (Fig. 1D). Thus, the Ddah2 gene expression during trophoblast cell differentiation was regulated in a differentiation status-dependent manner both in vivo and in vitro. Derepression of Ddah2 Gene in TS Cells by Treatment with Reagents Affecting Epigenetic Status—To investigate whether repression of the Ddah2 gene is mediated by epigenetic mechanisms, we treated TS cells with 5-aza-dC, an inhibitor of DNA methylation, and/or TSA, an inhibitor of histone deacetylation. Up-regulation of Ddah2 expression in undifferentiated TS cells was induced by 5-aza-dC treatment (Fig. 2). In addition, TSA also strongly induced Ddah2 expression, suggesting that both DNA methylation and histone deacetylation are involved in the repression of the Ddah2 gene. DNA Methylation Status of 5′-flanking Region of Ddah2 Gene in Trophoblast Cell Lineage—Repression of Ddah2 expression in undifferentiated TS cells was alleviated by 5-aza-dC treatment alone. Thus, we predicted the presence of CpGs, differentially methylated between undifferentiated and differentiated TS cells, in the upstream region of the transcription start site of the Ddah2 gene. The Ddah2 locus has a CpG island overlapping the first exon. Bisulfite sequencing analysis of the Ddah2 upstream region (-1,289 to +456) revealed that CpGs within the CpG island (-71 to +430) were almost completely unmethylated. However, the CpGs upstream of the CpG island appeared hypermethylated in undifferentiated TS cells, whereas these CpGs were relatively hypomethylated in differentiated TS cells (Fig. 3). In particular, five CpGs, located at -897, -710, -698, -684, and -674, were found to be almost completely demethylated in differentiated TS cells, where Ddah2 is expressed. To investigate whether TS cells indeed recapitulated the epigenetic change of Ddah2 locus in vivo, we then analyzed the DNA methylation status of CpGs in the Ddah2 upstream region in ExE and EPC cells. Laser microdissection was used to isolate pieces of each tissue from sections of E6.5 concepti (Fig. 4A), and the integrity of collected tissues was verified by RT-PCR for the expression of marker genes. Detection of Errβ in ExE-derived but not EPC-derived RNA and restricted expression of Tpbp in EPC-derived cells indicated that the tissues were properly isolated from each population (Fig. 4B). Moreover, as was shown in Fig. 1C, Ddah2 was detected in EPC and only faintly detected in ExE. Bisulfite sequencing analysis of genomic DNAs prepared from the collected tissues again revealed almost no methylation of CpGs in the CpG island and the differentiation status-dependent change in methylation of CpGs at -897, -710, -698, -684, and -674 (Fig. 4C). In contrast to the case of TS cells, CpGs further upstream (-1,249, -1,201, -987, -956, and -931) showed nearly complete methylation in both ExE and EPC. These results indicated that TS cell differentiation in vitro basically recapitulated differentiation of trophoblast cell lineage in vivo in terms of the change in DNA methylation status of Ddah2 locus and suggested that methylation of a particular set of CpGs in the 5′-flanking region of the Ddah2 gene plays an important role in repression of this gene at least in trophoblast cell lineage. Therefore, we designated the region containing five differentially methylated CpGs as a tissue-dependent differentially methylated region (T-DMR) of Ddah2 locus. Chromatin Modification Status of 5′-flanking Region of Ddah2 Gene in TS Cells—Since a differentiation status-dependent change in histone acetylation at Ddah2 locus in TS cells was also suggested, we next examined the chromatin modification status of the Ddah2 upstream region by ChIP assays with anti-acetylated histone H3 and anti-acetylated histone H4 antibodies. We designed three sets of primers across the Ddah2 5′-flanking region: an upstream region of the T-DMR (-1,285 to -1,021; region I), a region included within the T-DMR (-928 to -722; region II) and a region closer to the transcription start site (-180 to +44; region III) (Fig. 5A). ChIP assays revealed increased H3 and H4 acetylation at all examined regions in differentiated TS cells when compared with undifferentiated ones (Fig. 5, B and C). Methylation status of lysines in histone H3 was also examined by using anti-dimethylated H3K4 and anti-dimethylated H3K9 antibodies. Although dimethylation of H3K4 at the T-DMR (region II) was likewise increased with differentiation of TS cells, that of both region I and region III did not change with statistic significance. Conversely, a slight reduction of H3K9 methylation was observed at all examined region. These results suggest that histone code in a repressive state was established not only at the T-DMR but also in the broad 5′-flanking region of the Ddah2 gene in undifferentiated TS cells with repressed Ddah2 expression. Inhibition of Promoter Activity by Methylation of Ddah2 T-DMR in Luciferase Assay—To elucidate the role of T-DMR in the regulation of Ddah2 transcription, we carried out luciferase reporter assays in differentiated TS cells. The construct containing Ddah2 upstream region up to T-DMR (pGL-924) showed a significant increase in luciferase activity relative to that of the empty vector (pGL3-Basic), whereas lack of the T-DMR (pGL-609) reduced activity by ∼45%, indicating that the proximal 5′-flanking region and the T-DMR have promoter and enhancer activities, respectively (Fig. 6A). We then methylated the T-DMR fragment (-924 to -611) in vitro by SssI methylase and inserted it into plasmids harboring Ddah2 promoter region (-610 to -36) to produce T-DMR-specifically methylated construct (pGL-me-924). As a control, unmethylated construct (pGL-um-924) was rebuilt by inserting unmethylated T-DMR fragment. In comparison with pGL-um-924, pGL-me-924 showed significant decrease in activity to the level comparable with that of pGL3-Basic (Fig. 6B). This result strongly suggests that DNA methylation at the Ddah2 T-DMR inhibits Ddah2 promoter-driven transcription and is a predominant regulator of the Ddah2 gene activity in TS cells. In this study, we found a T-DMR in the 5′-flanking region of the Ddah2 gene. The Ddah2 T-DMR was hypermethylated in ExE of E6.5 mouse embryo, where Ddah2 expression is repressed, whereas it was hypomethylated in EPC, where Ddah2 is expressed. Dynamic change in the methylation status of the T-DMR was also demonstrated in vitro in TS cells. Importantly, in vitro methylation of the T-DMR was sufficient to inhibit promoter activity of the Ddah2 5′-flanking region in the reporter assay, strongly suggesting that methylation of the T-DMR is crucial for silencing Ddah2 gene. Complete inhibition of Ddah2 promoter activity by methylation of only five cytosines in the Ddah2 T-DMR was rather surprising. These CpGs are located 674-897 bp upstream of the transcription start site, encompassing a single core histone octamer in theory, and are apparently outside of the region that showed promoter activity (-609 to -36) in the reporter assay. Another set of CpGs further upstream (-1,249, -1,201, -987, -956, and -931) appeared fully methylated in EPC and almost completely methylated in ExE. However, this set showed partial loss of methylation even in TS cells maintained in an undifferentiated state, although it was still hypermethylated in comparison with the set in differentiated TS cells. This may indicate that methylation of distal CpGs is less relevant for repression of Ddah2 expression. Methylation of DNA at the transcription regulatory region is generally associated with gene silencing (3Chan Y. Fish J.E. D'Abreo C. Lin S. Robb G.B. Teichert A.M. Karantzoulis-Fegaras F.

These proteins recruit histone deacetylases and histone methyltransferase, thereby resulting in formation of a closed chromatin structure (5Fujita N. Watanabe S. Ichimura T. Tsuruzoe S. Shinkai Y.

Science. 2003; 302: 890-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). A search for CpG-containing conserved sequences of transcription factor binding sites did not reveal any within the Ddah2 T-DMR, excluding the possibility that CpG methylation directly inhibited binding of known transcription factors to the T-DMR. However, Ddah2 expression in undifferentiated TS cells was up-regulated by treatment with TSA, showing that histone acetylation-mediated change of chromatin structure is also involved in regulation of the Ddah2 gene. In the 5′-flanking region of the Ddah2 gene that includes the T-DMR, histones H3 and H4 were hyperacetylated and H3K4 was hypermethylated in differentiated TS cells when compared with undifferentiated ones. In addition, the level of H3K9 methylation was reduced with differentiation, suggesting that the Ddah2 upstream region switches from an inactive to an active chromatin structure with differentiation of TS cells (8Berger S.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3007-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 30Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Sherriff J. Bernstein B.E. Emre N.C. Schreiber S.L. Mellor J. Kouzarides T.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1779-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). In the luciferase reporter assay, methylation of only the T-DMR reduced luciferase activity to the level comparable with that of empty vector, suggesting that methylation inhibited not only enhancer activity of the T-DMR itself but also promoter activity conferred by the region proximal to the T-DMR. These results, together with the derepression of Ddah2 by 5-aza-dC treatment in undifferentiated TS cells, imply that methylation of Ddah2 T-DMR plays a causal role in changing the chromatin structure toward a repressive state at the region around the Ddah2 T-DMR. As Ddah2 was widely expressed in virtually all regions of E6.5 embryo except ExE and in a wide variety of adult tissues (32Leiper J.M. Santa Maria J. Chubb A. MacAllister R.J. Charles I.G. Whitley G.S. Vallance P. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 33Tran C.T. Fox M.F. Vallance P. Leiper J.M. Genomics. 2000; 68: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), we assume that Ddah2 expression is activated by ubiquitously expressed transcription factor(s) and is actively suppressed in ExE through methylation of the Ddah2 T-DMR. In support of this view, involvement of transcription factors such as Sp1 and E2F in human DDAH2 expression has been suggested (34Jones L.C. Tran C.T. Leiper J.M. Hingorani A.D. Vallance P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 310: 836-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In mouse Ddah2 locus, we found some putative Sp1 binding sites immediately upstream of the transcription start site (data not shown). Although the participation of Sp1, E2F, and their putative binding sites in the activation of the Ddah2 gene should be directly examined, we presume that tissue- and developmental stage-dependent expression of the Ddah2 gene is regulated by the presence of widely expressed transcription factors in combination with the epigenetic status around the T-DMR. In this context, specific repression of Ddah2 in ExE of E6.5 embryo is of great interest. It may be possible that methylation of the Ddah2 T-DMR is regulated under the control of signaling pathways specifically activated in ExE and undifferentiated TS cells. To date, a molecular link between extracellular signal and genomic regionspecific change in DNA methylation has not been defined. The TS cells may provide a unique model system to address this issue. The physiological role of Ddah2 in the trophoblast cell lineage is unknown. Ddah2 has been shown to metabolize mono- or asymmetrically dimethylated free arginine residues to citrulline and has been implicated in the positive regulation of nitric oxide synthesis (35Gagioti S. Scavone C. Bevilacqua E. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, production of nitric oxide both in ExE and in EPC of postimplantation mouse embryos has not been detected (36MacAllister R.J. Parry H. Kimoto M. Ogawa T. Russell R.J. Hodson H. Whitley G.S. Vallance P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 1533-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Recently, conversion of methyl-arginine residues in histones H3 and H4 to citrulline by PAD4/PADI4 was shown to play a pivotal role in epigenetic regulation of transcriptional activity (37Wang Y. Wysocka J. Sayegh J. Lee Y.H. Perlin J.R. Leonelli L. Sonbuchner L.S. McDonald C.H. Cook R.G. Dou Y. Roeder R.G. Clarke S. Stallcup M.R. Allis C.D. Coonrod S.A. Science. 2004; 306: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). It may be possible that Ddah2 activity is also involved in these epigenetic modifications, although it is still unclear whether Ddah2 converts methyl-arginine residues within a polypeptide chain to citrulline. In conclusion, our data indicate for the first time not only the presence of CpGs methylated in a differentiation status-dependent manner but also the existence of the link between DNA methylation and transcriptional regulation of a non-imprinted unique gene in the trophoblast cell lineage.

Members of the family harbor a variety of domains for protein-protein interactions, one of which is a unique PDZ domain that differs significantly from those of other proteins. We have identified a novel binding partner for this PDZ domain, termed ProSAPiP1, that is highly enriched in the PSD and shares significant sequence homology with the PSD protein PSD-Zip70. Both molecules code for a Fez1 domain that can be found in a total of four related proteins. ProSAPiP1 is widely expressed in rat brain and co-localizes with ProSAP2/Shank3 in excitatory spines and synapses. ProSAP2/Shank3 co-immunoprecipitates with ProSAPiP1 but not with PSD-Zip70. Both proteins, however, bind and recruit SPAR to synapses with a central coiled-coil region that harbors a leucine zipper motif. This region is also responsible for homo- and heteromultimerization of ProSAPiP1 and PSD-Zip70. Thus, ProSAPiP1 and PSD-Zip70 are founders of a novel family of scaffolding proteins, the “Fezzins,” which adds further complexity to the organization of the PSD protein network.

In this report we characterize a new protein, termed ProSAPiP1 (ProSAP-interacting Protein 1), that interacts with the PDZ domain of ProSAP2/Shank3. ProSAPiP1 is a synaptic protein that shares significant sequence homology with another recently described PSD protein, termed PSD-Zip70 (24Konno D. Ko J.-A. Usui S. Hori K. Maruoka H. Inui M.

Moreover, these proteins are founding a family of altogether four proteins harboring a Fez1 domain with previously unknown function (F37/Esophageal cancer-related gene coding leucine zipper motif 1 (28Ishii H.

We report that the C terminus of PSD-Zip70 does not bind to the same PDZ domain but, like ProSAPiP1, binds the recently identified RapGAP SPAR with a central coiled-coil domain that harbors a leucine zipper motif. Moreover, ProSAPiP1 and PSD-Zip70 can form homo- and heteromultimers. We therefore propose that both proteins constitute a novel family of scaffolding molecules, the “Fezzins.” Yeast Two-hybrid Screening and Cloning of a Full-length Rat ProSAPiP1 cDNA—Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed according to published methods (23Böckers T.M. Mameza M.G. Kreutz M.R. Bockmann J. Weise C. Buck F. Richter D. Gundelfinger E.D. Kreienkamp H.J. J. Biol.

As bait, the cDNAs coding for the PDZ domain of ProSAP2/Shank3 (aa 670-760), full-length ProSAPiP1 (aa 1-704), or the coiled-coil region of ProSAPiP1 (aa 286-475) were fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain of vector pAS2-1 (Clontech). A rat brain cDNA library cloned into the pACT vector (GAL4 activation domain; Clontech) was screened. By screening with the ProSAP2/Shank3 PDZ domain, three partial cDNA clones for ProSAPiP1 were obtained and sequenced. A full-length cDNA was cloned by several rounds of screening of λ ZAPII (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) rat hippocampal and total brain cDNA libraries with the 32P-labeled ProSAPiP1 cDNA fragments. Full-length GFP expression constructs were amplified by PCR, cloned into the plasmid pEGFP-C2 (Clontech), and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Similarly, mutant constructs were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis and confirmed by DNA sequencing to determine the ProSAP2/Shank3-binding motif of ProSAPiP1 in a yeast two-hybrid assay approach. Subsequently, yeast two-hybrid screening and assay with the ProSAPiP1 full-length and ProSAPiP1 coiled-coil bait was done as described. Full-length SPAR cDNA was obtained after screening λ ZAPII (Stratagene) rat hippocampal and total brain cDNA libraries with the partial cDNAs for SPAR (prey). Antibodies—A partial cDNA of ProSAPiP1 (encoding aa 332-704) was subcloned in the bacterial expression vector pGEX-4T (Amersham Biosciences). A 68.5-kDa glutathione S-transferase (GST)-ProSAPiP1 fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL 21 and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). The fusion protein was used to generate ProSAPiP1 antibodies in rabbits (Eurogentec, Southampton, UK). The PSD-Zip70 and ProSAP2/Shank3 antibodies have been described previously (5Boeckers T.M.

Immunohistochemistry—Immunocytochemical staining was performed using 7-μm microtome sections from rat brains at different developmental stages, which were fixed by immersion in Bouin's fluid for 48 h, dehydrated, and embedded in paraplast. ProSAPiP1 was detected with the C-terminal rabbit anti-ProSAPiP1 polyclonal antibody diluted 1:600 using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) technique. Briefly, the ABC method included incubation of cryostat, deparaffinized sections with primary antibodies in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 24 h at room temperature, followed by incubation for 30 min at room temperature with the second antibody, biotin-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Soham, Cambridgeshire, UK). The sections were than incubated for 30 min with a preformed complex of biotin-peroxidase-streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Soham, Cambridgeshire, UK), and peroxidase activity was revealed with 0.02% diaminobenzidine hydrochloride (DAB) as chromogen. Electron microscopy was performed using vibratome sections (50 μm) from rat brain fixed by perfusion with 0.5% glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.35. Cortical tissue from rat brains was fixed by immersion with the same fixative. Floating sections were stained with the Vectastain ABC staining kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After color reaction with DAB, sections were extensively washed in 0.05 m Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.4, and in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, before being fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, for 2 h (4 °C). Subsequently, sections were further washed in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, and doubly distilled water (ddH2O). Silver enhancement of the DAB product was performed as follows: solution A, 3% hexamethylenetetramine in ddH2O; solution B, 5% silver nitrate (AgNO3) in ddH2O; solution C, 2.5% disodium tetraborate in ddH2O; solution D, 0.05% tetrachloroauric acid in ddH2O. The sections were first incubated for 10 min at 60 °C in premixed solution, 5 ml of solution A + 250 μl of solution B + 500 μl of solution C, and then washed in distilled water (dH2O) (three times for 3 min). Thereafter, the sections were incubated in solution D at room temperature for 3 min, washed with dH2O three times for 3 min, incubated in solution E for 3 min, and washed again three times for 3 min in dH2O. Subsequently, the sections were post-fixed in 1% OsO4, dehydrated in ethanol, and embedded in Epon. Parallel semi-thin sections were stained with toluidine blue for morphological orientation; ultrathin sections were contrasted with uranyl acetate/lead citrate before analysis with a Philips electron microscope. In Situ Hybridization and Northern Blot Analysis—In situ hybridization was performed according to protocols described previously (5Boeckers T.M. Kreutz M.R. Winter C. Zuschratter W. Smalla K.H.

For Northern blot analysis, a rat multiple tissue Northern blot (Clontech) was hybridized with a C-terminal ProSAPiP1 cDNA probe (bp 1157-end) according to the manufacturer's protocol (Clontech). Western Blot Analysis, Isolation of Subcellular Protein Fractions, Overlay and Multimerization Assays, GST Pulldown Assay, and Immunoprecipitation of Brain Lysates—Subcellular fractionation studies were performed as described previously (31Seidenbecher C.I. Langnaese K. Sanmarti-Vila L. Boeckers T.M. Smalla K.H. Sabel B.A. Garner C.C. Gundelfinger E.D. Kreutz M.R. J. Biol.

In brief, tissue from adult rats was homogenized in homogenization buffer (320 mm sucrose, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science); cell debris and nuclei were removed by 1000 × g centrifugation. The supernatant was spun for 20 min by 12,000 × g, resulting in supernatant S2 and pellet P2 (crude membrane fraction). The S2 was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the resulting supernatant was taken as the cytoplasmic section (S100). The P2 pellet was further fractionated by centrifugation in a sucrose step gradient (0.85, 1.0, and 1.2 m). For isolation of synaptic junctional proteins (PSD fraction), the synaptosomal fraction of the first gradient was diluted with 5 volumes of 1 mm Tris, pH 8.1. The suspension was kept on ice for 30 min and was centrifuged for 30 min at 33,000 × g. The pellet P3 was resuspended in 5mm Tris, pH 8.1 (1.5 ml/1 g wet tissue), and once again fractionated by centrifugation in a sucrose gradient. The 1.0/1.2 m interphase (synaptic junctions) was suspended in 320 mm sucrose, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm Tris, pH 8.1 (120 ml/10 g wet tissue), kept on ice for 15 min, and centrifuged for 30 min at 33,000 × g. This PSD I fraction was resuspended in5mm Tris, pH 8.1, 320 mm sucrose, and 0.5% Triton X-100. The solution was kept on ice for 15 min and centrifuged at 33,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of water. To study the expression of ProSAPiP1 during postnatal development, P2 fractions from brains of 1-, 4-, 7-, 10-, 14-, 21-, 30-, and 90-day-old rats were resuspended in 500 μl of Laemmli buffer. Proteins (20 μg/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% gels under fully reducing conditions and transferred on PVDF membranes. For immunodetection, Western blots were incubated with the polyclonal ProSAPiP1 anti-serum (dilution 1:2000). Immunoreactivity was visualized using the SuperSignal detection system (Pierce). For the GST pulldown assay, the last 371 aa of ProSAPiP1 and the PDZ domain of ProSAP2 were cloned into the pGEX4-T2 vector. The GST fusion proteins were coupled to glutathione S-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. The crude membrane fraction of rat brain was extracted for 1 h with RIPA at 4 °C. After centrifugation (12,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), the supernatant was incubated with Sepharose containing the fusion proteins or GST alone overnight at 4 °C. The precipitates were washed twice with RIPA and once with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and analyzed with antibodies against ProSAPiP1 and ProSAP2/Shank3. For the overlay assay, a full-length GFP-SPAR construct was transfected in COS-7 cells. Cells were harvested, separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and blotted on a PVDF membrane. The membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with a crude membrane fraction of rat brain extracted with RIPA buffer. Membranes were intensely washed, and either GFP or ProSAPiP1 antibodies were used for immunodetection of the antigen. Multimerization assay was performed essentially as described by Tadokoro et al. (32Tadokoro S. Tachibana T. Imanaka T. Nishida W. Sobue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13801-13806Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Recombinant GST-ProSAPiP1 proteins were diluted in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl (0.2 mg/ml) and treated with or without 0.05% glutaraldehyde at 30 °C for 30 min, separated by SDS-PAGE (14%), and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R. For immunoprecipitation the following primary antibodies were used: ProSAPiP1, ProSAP2/Shank3, SPAR, and nonimmune rabbit and nonimmune guinea pig IgG. 50 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein-A-agarose (Roche Applied Science) was washed three times with PBS and then preincubated with the antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C. The crude membrane fraction (P2) of an adult rat brain was solubilized with RIPA for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation (20 min, 12,000 × g, 4 °C) the supernatant was added to the agarose and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The mixture was washed twice with RIPA and once with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto PVDF membrane. Immunoreactivity was visualized by using ProSAP1/Shank2, ProSAP2/Shank3, ProSAPiP1, Spar, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the SuperSignal detection system (Pierce). Neuronal Cell Culture and COS-7 Cell Transfections—To test the interaction between ProSAPiP1 and ProSAP2/Shank3 in COS-7 cells, ProSAPiP1 was cloned into the red fluorescent protein expression vector (pDsRed2; Clontech) using PCR strategies. Afterward, this expression vector was co-transfected with a GFP-ProSAP2 construct (pEGFP-ProSAP2PDZ638-746). Cells were grown on glass coverslips, transfected by using Polyfect (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde 24 h after transfection. Cell cultures of hippocampal primary neurons and transfections were performed as described previously (33Boeckers T.M. Liedtke T. Spilker C. Dresbach T. Bockmann J. Kreutz M.R. Gundelfinger E.D. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 519-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Hippocampal neurons were fixed at -20 °C for 5 min in methanol. Cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with 2% bovine serum albumin, 10% horse serum, 5% sucrose, and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS to block nonspecific binding and subsequently with primary antibodies for 1-3 h at room temperature with the following dilutions: ProSAPiP1 antiserum at 1:600; ProSAP2/Shank3 antiserum at 1:500; SPAR antiserum 1:1000; and SAP90/PSD95 antiserum at 1:500. Anti-rabbit, anti-guinea pig, and anti-mouse IgGs coupled to Cy2 or Cy3 (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) were used to detect the primary antibodies. Identification of ProSAPiP1 as a PDZ Domain-interacting Protein for ProSAP2/Shank3—By utilizing the yeast two-hybrid system, we screened 1.6 × 106 clones of a rat brain cDNA library with the PDZ domain of ProSAP2/Shank 3 as bait. A total of three clones were obtained that encoded partially or full-length a novel protein of 704 aa (EMBL/Gen-Bank™ accession number AJ278801, human homologue KIAA0552; EMBL/GenBank™ accession number NM_014731) termed ProSAPiP1 for ProSAP-interacting Protein 1 (Fig. 1, A and B). ProSAPiP1 is characterized by a coiled-coil domain, a leucine zipper, a C-terminal Fez1 domain (28Ishii H. Baffa R. Numata S.I. Murakumo Y. Rattan S. Inoue H. Mori M. Fidanza V. Alder H. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3928-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and a C-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif -STEI. ProSAPiP1 is localized on rat chromosome 3q36 and encoded by five exons (Fig. 1C). A data base search revealed that ProSAPiP1 is closely related to other Fez1 proteins. We could identify a Fezzin family with a total of four members. The highest sequence identity of ProSAPiP1 is found with the PSD protein PSD-Zip70 (24Konno D. Ko J.-A. Usui S. Hori K. Maruoka H. Inui M. Fujikado T. Tano Y. Suzuki T. Tohyama K. Sobue K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4695-4706Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, D and E) and with a putative tumor suppressor molecule named LAPSER1 (26Cabeza-Arvelaiz Y. Thompson T.C. Sepulveda J.L. Chinault A.C. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6707-6717Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The sequence homology encompassed the entire open reading frame, including all three putative protein-protein interaction domains, i.e. a coiled-coil domain (aa 348-462), the Fez1 domain, and a PDZ domain-binding motif at the C terminus (either -STEI or -ATEI; Fig. 1, D-F) with the exception of an N-myristoylation motif that is lacking in ProSAPiP1. Interestingly, the highest degree of similarity for both proteins is found in the coiled-coil and Fez1 domain, raising the possibility that both proteins might bind common binding partners via this region. The N4BP3 (Nedd4-binding protein 3) is a more distantly and slightly smaller member of this novel Fez1 domain protein family (27Murillas R. Simms K.S. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Kuehn M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 25: 2897-2907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (62) Google Scholar). ProSAPiP1 Is a Brain-specific Protein Highly Enriched in the PSD—A 4-kb band could be detected on a multiple tissue Northern blot in kidney and brain (Fig. 2A). However, Western blot analysis with a polyclonal antibody directed specifically against ProSAPiP1 as shown, i.e. by GFP-ProSAPiP1 transfection experiments (Fig. 2B), identified the protein-like PSD-Zip70 (24Konno D. Ko J.-A. Usui S. Hori K. Maruoka H. Inui M. Fujikado T. Tano Y. Suzuki T. Tohyama K. Sobue K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4695-4706Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) exclusively in brain but not in other tissues (Fig. 2C). The expression level of the protein increases significantly between day 8 and day 16 in brain (Fig. 2E), and the highest levels of the protein were found in cerebral cortex, the cerebellum, and in the hippocampus (Fig. 2D). In a next set of experiments, we investigated whether ProSAPiP1 is indeed a postsynaptic brain protein that can interact in vivo with ProSAP2/Shank3 in the PSD. Extraction experiments had already shown that ProSAPiP1 is tightly connected to the cytoskeleton and Triton X-100-insoluble (data not shown). Subcellular fractionation aimed to purify protein components of the PSD showed a clear enrichment of the relative amount of ProSAPiP1 immunoreactivity in the PSD fraction as compared with other fractions (Fig. 2F). The increasing amounts of protein during brain development is reflected by a relative increase of protein levels in highly purified PSD fractions following the time course of synapse formation and maturation (Fig. 2G). C-terminal Amino Acids of ProSAPiP1 Are Crucial for the Interaction with the PDZ Domain of ProSAP2/Shank3—To prove that the C terminus of ProSAPiP1 is necessary for binding to the PDZ domain of ProSAP2/Shank3, we employed a deletion construct lacking the last three amino acids. As expected, this construct showed no binding to the PDZ domain of ProSAP2/Shank3 in yeast (Fig. 2H). Next we determined whether the C terminus of ProSAPiP1 binds in a canonical manner to the PDZ domain of ProSAP2/Shank3 by generating a variety of mutant ProSAPiP1 constructs with point mutations in the last four amino acids, and we tested their binding affinity in a semi-quantitative yeast two-hybrid assay. Inspection of the C terminus of ProSAPiP1 suggests that it should bind to class 1 PDZ domains with the consensus sequence X(T/S)Y(V/L) (34Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly and as reported previously (7Naisbitt S. Kim E. Tu J.C. Xiao B. Sala C. Valtschanoff J. Weinberg R.J. Worley P.F. Sheng M. Neuron. 1999; 23:"
https://openalex.org/W1984592839,"Dynamins and dynamin-like proteins play important roles in organelle division. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the dynamin-like protein Vps1p (vacuolar protein sorting protein 1) is involved in peroxisome fission, as cells deleted for the VPS1 gene contain reduced numbers of enlarged peroxisomes. What relationship Vps1p has with peroxisomes remains unclear. Here we show that Vps1p interacts with Pex19p, a peroxin that acts as a shuttling receptor for peroxisomal membrane proteins or as a chaperone assisting the assembly/stabilization of proteins at the peroxisome membrane. Vps1p contains two putative Pex19p recognition sequences at amino acids 509-523 and 633-647. Deletion of the first (but not the second) sequence results in reduced numbers of enlarged peroxisomes in cells, as in vps1Δ cells. Deletion of either sequence has no effect on vacuolar morphology or vacuolar protein sorting, suggesting that the peroxisome and vacuole biogenic functions of Vps1p are separate and separable. Substitution of proline for valine at position 516 of Vps1p abrogates Pex19p binding and gives the peroxisome phenotype of vps1Δ cells. Microscopic analysis showed that overexpression of Pex19p or redirection of Pex19p to the nucleus does not affect the normal cellular distribution of Vps1p in the cytosol and in punctate structures that are not peroxisomes, suggesting that Pex19p does not function in targeting Vps1p to peroxisomes. Subcellular fractionation showed that a fraction of Vps1p is associated with peroxisomes and that deletion or mutation of the first Pex19p recognition sequence abrogates this association. Our results are consistent with Pex19p acting as a chaperone to stabilize the association of Vps1p with peroxisomes and not as a receptor involved in targeting Vps1p to peroxisomes.

There is also evidence for a metabolic control of peroxisome division (11Poll-Thé B.T. Roels F. Ogier H. Scotto J. Vamecq J. Schutgens R.B.H. Wanders R.J.A. van Roermund C.W.T. van Wijland M.J.A.

We recently showed that the peroxisomal integral membrane proteins Pex28p through Pex32p are also involved in controlling peroxisome number and size in S. cerevisiae (16Vizeacoumar F.J.

Aitchison J.D. Rachubinski R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 665-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar); however, their exact roles in peroxisome division have yet to be determined. One family of proteins implicated in organelle division are the dynamins. Dynamin and dynamin-like proteins are a highly conserved family of large GTPases involved in a variety of cellular processes, including endocytosis, intracellular protein trafficking and organelle partitioning (18Hinshaw J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 483-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 19Danino D. Hinshaw J.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, the dynamin-like protein Dnm1p has been shown to assemble in a multicomponent complex at the outer mitochondrial membrane and mediate the division of mitochondria (20Osteryoung K.W. Nunnari J. Science. 2003; 302: 1698-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), whereas the dynamin-like protein vacuolar protein sorting protein 1 (Vps1p) has been implicated in peroxisome fission (21Hoepfner D. van den Berg M. Philippsen P. Tabak H.F. Hettema E.H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 979-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Cells lacking Vps1p have fewer and enlarged peroxisomes as compared with wildtype cells. Vps1p is related to mammalian DLP1. Peroxisome elongation and constriction can occur independently of DLP1, whereas peroxisome fission requires DLP1 (22Koch A. Schneider G. Luers G.H. Schrader M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3995-4006Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Pex11p has been suggested to recruit DLP1 to peroxisomes, although no direct interaction between these two proteins has been observed (23Li X. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17012-17020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We have reported that oversynthesis of Pex11p in vps1Δ cells results in the formation of peroxisomes that are similar in size and number to the peroxisomes of wild-type cells, suggesting that overproduction of Pex11p can overcome the requirement for Vps1p in controlling peroxisome fission (16Vizeacoumar F.J. Torres-Guzman J.C. Tam Y.Y.C. Aitchison J.D. Rachubinski R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Vps1p has also been suggested to regulate the actin cytoskeleton through its interaction with proteins capable of promoting actin assembly (24Tang H.Y. Munn A. Cai M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4294-4304Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 25Howard J.P. Hutton J.L. Olson J.M. Payne G.S. J.

Interestingly, a vps1Δ rho1Δ double mutant of S. cerevisiae showed accumulation of actin on peroxisomes, suggesting that actin is reorganized/disassembled before peroxisome fission (29Marelli M. Smith J.J. Jung S. Yi E. Nesvizhskii A.I. Christmas R.H. Saleem R.A. Tam Y.Y.C. Fagarasanu A. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Rachubinski R.A. Aitchison J.D. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1099-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). All of these observations support a direct role for Vps1p in peroxisome fission at the level of the peroxisome itself, but it remains to be determined how Vps1p could associate with peroxisomes. One protein that could recruit Vps1p to peroxisomes is Pex19p. Pex19p is a farnesylated peroxin involved in peroxisome membrane biogenesis (30Götte K. Girzalsky W. Linkert M. Baumgart E. Kammerer S.

Studies suggest that Pex19p functions as an import receptor for peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMP) 4The abbreviations used are: PMP, peroxisomal membrane protein; NLS, nuclear localization signal; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CPY, carboxypeptidase Y; 20KgS, 20,000 × g supernatant; 20KgP, 20,000 × g pellet. and/or as a chaperone acting in the assembly or stabilization of PMPs in the cytosol or at the peroxisomal membrane (32Sacksteder K.A.

Here we show that the association of Vps1p with peroxisomes is dependent on Pex19p and that the interaction of Vps1p with Pex19p is required for peroxisomal fission. Our findings are consistent with a role for Pex19p as an assembly or stabilization factor for Vps1p at the peroxisome.

Genes to be overexpressed were amplified by PCR and cloned into the plasmid YEp13 (37Broach J.R. Strathern J.N. Hicks J.B. Gene. 1979; 8: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). For overexpression, the PEX19 gene included 400 bp of upstream sequence and 347 bp of downstream sequence. The plasmid pGFP/HIS5 was constructed from the plasmid pProtA/HIS5 (38Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Suprapto A. Hjertaas K. Zhao Y. Chait B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 635-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar) by exchange of the sequence encoding protein A (ProtA) with sequence encoding an improved version of GFP (GFP+) from Aequoria victoria (39Scholz O. Thiel A. Hillen W. Niederweis M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1565-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The plasmid pGFP/NAT (nourseothricin) was constructed from pGFP/HIS5 by exchange of the HIS5 auxotrophic marker for the gene encoding resistance to the drug nourseothricin. pNLS-PEX19 and pNLS-GFP-PEX19 were constructed in pRS316 and contained sequence encoding either the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of Mad1p NLS-Pex19p or NLS-GFP-Pex19p under the control of the PHO4 promoter. GFP Tagging of Genes—Genes were genomically tagged with the sequence encoding GFP by homologous recombination with a PCR-based integrative transformation of parental BY4742 or pex19Δ haploid cells (40Dilworth D.J. Suprapto A. Padovan J.C. Chait B.T. Wozniak R.W. Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1465-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The functionality of fusion proteins was confirmed by the lack of a mutant phenotype in transformed strains. Construction of Yeast Strains Mutated in the VPS1 Gene—In-frame deletions of the regions of the VPS1 gene coding for putative Pex19p recognition sequences were constructed by overlapping PCR followed by genomic integration of the mutated genes at the VPS1 locus of the haploid parental strain BY4742 to make the strains vps1Δ509-523 and vps1Δ633-647. Codon 516 of the VPS1 gene encoding valine was changed to a codon encoding proline by site-directed mutagenesis, and the mutated gene was genomically integrated at the VPS1 locus of the strain BY4742 to make the strain vps1V516P. Microscopy—Strains synthesizing GFP chimeric proteins or transformed with the plasmid pDsRed-PTS1 were grown in SM medium for 12 h and then incubated in YPBO medium for 8 h. Images were captured on a LSM510 META (Carl Zeiss) laser scanning microscope or on an Olympus BX50 microscope equipped with a digital fluorescence camera (Spot Diagnostic Instruments). Cells were processed for immunofluorescence microscopy (41Pringle J.R. Adams A.E.M. Drubin D.G. Haarer B.K. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 565-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) and electron microscopy (42Eitzen G.A. Szilard R.K. Rachubinski R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1265-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Two-hybrid Analysis—Physical interactions between Pex19p and Vps1p or Vps1pV516P were detected using the Matchmaker two-hybrid system (BD Biosciences). Chimeric genes were made by amplifying the open reading frames for Pex19p, Vps1p, and Vps1pV516P and ligating them in-frame and downstream of the DNA encoding the transcription-activating domain (AD) and the DNA-binding domain (BD) of the GAL4 transcriptional activator in the plasmids pGAD424 and pGBT9, respectively. Cells of S. cerevisiae strain HF7c were transformed simultaneously with a pGAD424-derived plasmid and a pGBT9-derived plasmid. Transformants were grown on SM agar medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. Growth on this medium indicates an interaction between two chimeric proteins. Secretion of Vacuolar Carboxypeptidase Y—Detection of the secretion of vacuolar carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) was performed as described previously (43Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were grown in YPD medium to an A600 of 0.5 and then spotted onto YPD agar plates in 2-fold serial dilutions. The cells were overlaid with nitrocellulose and then incubated at 30 °C for 24 h. The nitrocellulose was lifted from the plate, rinsed with water, and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-CPY antibody. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Vacuolar Staining—Cells grown overnight at 30 °C in YPD medium were subcultured in YPD medium at 30 °C until they reached an A600 of 0.5. 1 μl of 8 mm FM4-64 (44Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar) was added to 100 μl of cells, and the cells were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The cells were washed with water and incubated in fresh YPD medium for 90 min at 30 °C. The cells were washed twice with water and then observed by fluorescence microscopy. Subcellular Fractionation and Isolation of Peroxisomes—Subcellular fractionation of oleic acid-incubated cells was done as described previously (3Smith J.J. Marelli M. Christmas R.H. Vizeacoumar F.J.

Peroxisomes were purified from the 20KgP fraction by isopycnic density centrifugation on Nycodenz gradients (3Smith J.J. Marelli M. Christmas R.H. Vizeacoumar F.J. Dilworth D.J. Ideker T. Galitski T.

Rabbit antibodies to S. cerevisiae glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were from Sigma-Aldrich. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and rhodamine-conjugated antiguinea pig IgG (The Jackson Laboratory) were used to detect primary antibodies in immunofluorescence microscopy. Analytical Procedures—Extraction of nucleic acid from yeast lysates and manipulation of DNA were performed as described previously (46Ausubel F.J. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1994Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed using a wet transfer system (46Ausubel F.J. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1994Google Scholar), and antigen-antibody complexes in immunoblots were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Protein concentration was determined using a commercially available kit (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin as a standard. Pex19p Interacts with Vps1p—Vps1p belongs to the dynamin family of proteins and is required for sorting proteins to the vacuolar compartment. Vps1p also has a role in peroxisome biogenesis, as cells deleted for the VPS1 gene contain reduced numbers of enlarged peroxisomes (21Hoepfner D. van den Berg M. Philippsen P. Tabak H.F. Hettema E.H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 979-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Vps1p has been suggested to cycle from the cytosol to the surface of the peroxisome (21Hoepfner D. van den Berg M. Philippsen P. Tabak H.F. Hettema E.H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 979-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The peroxin Pex19p has been implicated in peroxisome membrane biogenesis and functions either as an import receptor for PMPs or as an assembly/disassembly factor, i.e. a chaperone, for PMPs in the cytosol or at the peroxisomal membrane (32Sacksteder K.A.

Recent work has defined a consensus sequence for recognition of a protein by Pex19p (47Rottensteiner H. Kramer A. Lorenzen S. Stein K. Landgraf C. Volkmer-Engert R. Erdmann R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3406-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Vps1p contains two stretches of amino acids that conform to this consensus sequence (Fig. 1A). Yeast two-hybrid analysis showed an interaction between Vps1p and Pex19p (Fig. 1B). Deletion of the First Consensus Pex19p Recognition Sequence in Vps1p Yields the vps1Δ Peroxisomal Phenotype—Cells carrying chromosomally integrated mutant forms of VPS1 deleted for sequences encoding the first (vps1Δ509-523) or second (vps1Δ633-647) putative Pex19p recognition site were examined by immunofluorescence microscopy to observe whether they exhibited the mutant peroxisomal phenotype of vps1Δ cells. vps1Δ509-523 cells showed reduced numbers of enlarged peroxisomes characteristic of vps1Δ cells, whereas vps1Δ633-647 cells showed a peroxisomal phenotype similar to that of wild-type cells (Fig. 2). Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of enlarged peroxisomes in vps1Δ509-523 cells (see Fig. 5B), which were similar in size to peroxisomes of vps1Δ cells (see Fig. 5C) and much larger than those of wildtype cells (see Fig. 5A). Our findings show that the consensus Pex19p recognition sequence in Vps1p at amino acids 509-523 is required for Vps1p function in controlling peroxisome size and number.FIGURE 5Peroxisome ultrastructure in wild-type and vps1 mutant cells. Cells of the wild-type strain BY4742 (A) and of the vps1 mutant strains vps1Δ509-523 (B), vps1Δ (C), and vps1V516P (D) were grown in YPD medium for 16 h, transferred to YPBO medium and incubated in YPBO medium for 8 h.

Mutations of genes involved in these processes often lead to vacuoles with aberrant morphology (48Seeley E.S. Kato M. Margolis N. Wickner W. Eitzen G.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 782-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and defects in vacuolar protein sorting (49Marcusson E.G. Horazdovsky B.F. Cereghino J.L. Gharakhanian E. Emr S.D.

We stained wild-type and vps1 mutant cells with the fluorescent vacuolar vital stain FM4-64 to examine their vacuolar morphology (Fig. 3A). The majority of vps1Δ cells exhibited a fragmented vacuolar morphology, as has been observed previously (48Seeley E.S. Kato M. Margolis N. Wickner W. Eitzen G.A. Mol. Biol.

We also analyzed the sorting of the soluble vacuolar hydrolase carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) (Fig. 3B). Defects in vacuolar protein sorting lead to secretion of CPY (49Marcusson E.G. Horazdovsky B.F. Cereghino J.L. Gharakhanian E. Emr S.D.

This result suggests that the peroxisome and vacuolar biogenic roles of Vps1p are separate and separable. vps1Δ633-647 cells showed a slightly increased level of secreted CPY but much less than that observed for vps1Δ cells, suggesting that these amino acids"

The only known missense mutation in human Sco1, a P174L substitution in the copper-binding domain, is associated with a fatal neonatal hepatopathy; however, the molecular basis for dysfunction of the protein is unknown. Immortalized fibroblasts from a SCO1 patient show a severe deficiency in cytochrome c oxidase activity that was partially rescued by overexpression of P174L Sco1. The mutant protein retained the ability to bind Cu(I) and Cu(II) normally when expressed in bacteria, but Cox17-mediated copper transfer was severely compromised both in vitro and in a yeast cytoplasmic assay. The corresponding P153L substitution in yeast Sco1 was impaired in suppressing the phenotype of cells harboring the weakly functional C57Y allele of Cox17; however, it was functional in sco1Δ yeast when the wild-type COX17 gene was present. Pulse-chase labeling of mitochondrial translation products in SCO1 patient fibroblasts showed no change in the rate of CoxII translation, but there was a specific and rapid turnover of CoxII protein in the chase. These data indicate that the P174L mutation attenuates a transient interaction with Cox17 that is necessary for copper transfer. They further suggest that defective Cox17-mediated copper metallation of Sco1, as well as the subsequent failure of CuA site maturation, is the basis for the inefficient assembly of the cytochrome c oxidase complex in SCO1 patients.

The enzyme catalyzes the reduction of molecular oxygen and couples this reduction with proton translocation across the inner membrane to generate the membrane potential used to synthesize ATP. The mammalian enzyme consists of 13 subunits, three of which, CoxI, CoxII and CoxIII, are mitochondrially encoded and form the catalytic core. Structurally conserved domains within subunits I and II contain the copper and heme cofactors that are essential for the catalytic competence of the holoenzyme (1Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Hakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1995; 269: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). CoxI contains two heme A moieties, one of which interacts with a mononuclear copper site forming a heterobimetallic site, designated heme A3-CuB. Two additional copper ions exist in a cysteine-bridged, binuclear, mixed valent center in CoxII designated CuA. Assembly of individual structural subunits into a functional holoenzyme complex within the mitochondrial inner membrane requires more than 30 accessory factors (2Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated CcO deficiency, one of the most commonly recognized causes of respiratory chain defects in humans, is associated with a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes (3Zhu Z. Yao J. Johns T. Fu K.

Two such factors, SCO1 and SCO2, encode metallochaperones that play a role in the copper ion metallation of the CuA site in CoxII. This step in CcO assembly requires a single Sco protein in yeast (Sco1), but both Sco proteins are essential in humans. Recent studies with immortalized fibroblasts from SCO1 and SCO2 patients suggest that Sco1 and Sco2 have non-overlapping but cooperative functions in the maturation of the CuA site (10Leary S.C. Kaufman B.A. Pellechia G. Gguercin G.-H. Mattman A. Jaksch M. Shoubridge E.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1839-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), although their specific molecular roles in CcO assembly have yet to be defined. Sco1 was first implicated in copper delivery to CcO by the observation that the respiration-deficient phenotype of a cox17-1 yeast mutant was suppressed by overexpression of SCO1 (11Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20531-20535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Deletion of the SCO1 gene in yeast cells produces a respiratory phenotype attributable to a lack of CcO activity. Structural studies of Sco1 show that it has a globular domain with a thioredoxin fold consisting of a central four-stranded β-sheet covered with flanking helices that protrude into the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) (12Williams J.C.

Two other notable features of Sco proteins are a conserved pair of cysteinyl residues in a CXXXC motif and a conserved histidyl residue. These residues are spatially close in the apo-Sco1 structure in a solvent-exposed pocket (12Williams J.C. Sue C. Banting G.S. Yang H. Glerum D.M. Hendrickson W.A. Schon E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15202-15211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Sco1 is capable of binding a single Cu(I) ion (18Nittis T. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42520-42526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). X-ray absorption spectroscopy suggests that the Cu(I) is ligated via two sulfur donors and a nitrogen. Mutation of either the Cys or His residues abolishes Cu(I) binding and results in a nonfunctional CcO complex (18Nittis T. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42520-42526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Cox17 is the likely physiological copper donor to Sco1 (19Horng Y.C. Cobine P.A. Maxfield A.B. Carr H.S. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35334-35340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) consistent with the postulate that Sco1 mediates Cu(I) transfer from Cox17 to CoxII. Sco proteins also bind Cu(II) (13Horng Y.-C. Leary S.C. Cobine P.A. Young F.B.J. George G.N. Shoubridge E.A. Winge D.R. J. Biol.

The Cu(II) site resembles a type II Cu(II) site with a higher coordination number than the three-coordinate Cu(I) site. A D238A substitution in yeast Sco1 abrogated Cu(II) coordination, leading to a nonfunctional protein. These data suggest that both Cu(I) and Cu(II) binding are critical for normal Sco1 function (13Horng Y.-C. Leary S.C. Cobine P.A. Young F.B.J. George G.N. Shoubridge E.A. Winge D.R. J. Biol.

SCO2 mutations are associated with neonatal encephalocardiomyopathy, whereas SCO1 patients present with neonatal hepatic failure and ketoacidotic coma. These distinct clinical phenotypes are not a result of tissue-specific expression of the two genes, as SCO1 and SCO2 are ubiquitously expressed and exhibit a similar expression pattern in different human tissues (4Papadopolou L.C. Sue C.M. Davidson M.M. Tanji K. Nishion I. Sadlock J.E. Krishna S. Walker W. Selby J. Glerum D.M. Van Coster R. Lyon G. Scalais E. Lebel R. Kaplan P. Shanske S. DeVito D.C. Bonilla E. Hirano M. DiMauro S. Schon E.A. Nature Genetics. 1999; 23: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). All reported SCO2 patients carry an E140K missense mutation on one allele and are either homozygous for this mutation or are compound heterozygotes. Homozygous patients have a delayed onset of the disease pathology and a more prolonged course of disease as compared with heterozygotes (14Jaksch M. Horvath R. Horn N. Auer D.P. Macmillan C. Peters J. Gerbitz K.-D. Kraegeloh-Mann I. Muntau A. Karcagi V. Kalmanchey R. Lochmuller H. Shoubridge E.A. Freisinger P. Neurology. 2001; 57: 1440-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). SCO1 mutations have only been identified in a single pedigree in which the reported patients carried a nonsense mutation on one allele and a P174L missense mutation on the second allele (5Valnot I. Von Kleist-Retzow J.-C. Barrientos A. Gorbatyuk M. Taanman J.-W. Mehaye B. Rustin P. Tzagoloff A. Munnich A. Rotig A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1245-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Both the E140K and P174L substitutions are adjacent to the CXXXC sequence motif. Human Sco1 and Sco2 are nonfunctional in yeast sco1Δ cells (15Paret C. Ostermann K. Krause-Buchholz U. Rentzsch A. Rodel G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, a chimeric protein consisting of 158 residues from the N terminus of yeast Sco1 fused to a C-terminal segment of hSco1, but not hSco2, is functional. A P174L substitution was found to attenuate its function (15Paret C. Ostermann K. Krause-Buchholz U. Rentzsch A. Rodel G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 16Paret C. Lode A. Krause-Buchholz U. Rodel G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), although the CcO deficiency in yeast sco1Δ cells harboring the mutant yeast/human Sco1 chimera could be rescued for growth on a nonfermentable carbon by the addition of 0.2% CuSO4 (16Paret C. Lode A. Krause-Buchholz U. Rodel G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This suggests that P174L Sco1 retains some residual function; however, the molecular defect in Sco1 function that results from this amino acid substitution remains unknown. The present study was therefore initiated to investigate whether copper binding is defective in the P174L mutant Sco1. We report that although copper binding is wild type in the mutant Sco1, its metallation by Cox17 is severely compromised. Yeast Strains and Human Cell Lines—All yeast strains used were in the W303 background (MAT a, ade2-1, his3-1,15, leu2,3,112, trp1-1, ura3-1). Cells were cultured with glucose, raffinose, or galactose as carbon sources as described (19Horng Y.C. Cobine P.A. Maxfield A.B. Carr H.S. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35334-35340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). DNA transformations were performed using a lithium acetate protocol. Primary cell lines from control SCO1 and SCO2 patient skin fibroblasts were immortalized and cultured as described previously (10Leary S.C. Kaufman B.A. Pellechia G. Gguercin G.-H. Mattman A. Jaksch M. Shoubridge E.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1839-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Preparation and supplementation of the growth media with copper histidine (Cu-His) was also as described elsewhere (10Leary S.C. Kaufman B.A. Pellechia G. Gguercin G.-H. Mattman A. Jaksch M. Shoubridge E.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1839-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Plasmids—The construction of YEp-GAL1-hSCO1 and pHis-hSCO1 were described previously (13Horng Y.-C. Leary S.C. Cobine P.A. Young F.B.J. George G.N. Shoubridge E.A. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34113-34122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The P174L mutation was introduced into these plasmids using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A pRS413 vector (YCp) expressing yeast SCO1 with a C-terminal HA tag sequence under the control of the MET25 promoter with a CYC1 terminator was used as a template to generate the P153L mutation. The entire insert was then subcloned into a pRS423 vector (YEp). The MET25 promoter was also replaced with the 350 upstream base pairs that make up the SCO1 promoter in the centromeric vector. The plasmid encoding Cyb2-C57Y Cox17 was described previously (17Maxfield A.B. Heaton D.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5072-5080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). DNA sequences were confirmed prior to use. Wild-type hSCO1 cloned into the Gateway-modified retroviral expression vector pLXSH was used as a template to generate the P174L point mutant using the QuikChange™ mutagenesis. The fidelity of the resultant construct was confirmed by sequencing. Phoenix amphotropic cells (Dr. G. Nolan, Stanford University) were used to transiently produce and package all individual human cDNA constructs. Subsequent infection and selection of fibroblast cell lines were done as described previously (10Leary S.C. Kaufman B.A. Pellechia G. Gguercin G.-H. Mattman A. Jaksch M. Shoubridge E.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1839-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Protein Purification—Recombinant human and yeast Sco1 proteins were purified from BL21(DE3) transformants harboring pHis-hSCO1 (His-tagged SCO1 or mutant SCO1) as described previously (18Nittis T. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42520-42526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Yeast transformants with YEp-GAL1-hSCO1 were cultured in raffinose medium to an A600 nm of 0.6. Galactose was then added to induce expression of the His-tagged Sco1. Cells were harvested after 5 h, and lysates were prepared by use of a French press. Nickel-NTA Superflow (Qiagen) was used for the purification of the His-tagged Sco1 proteins from clarified samples. Spectroscopic Analyses—Absorption spectra were recorded with a Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer. X-band EPR spectra were obtained on a 9-GHz Bruker EMX spectrometer. All samples were run at 77 K in a liquid nitrogen finger Dewar. Spin quantitation was determined relative to a 0.5 mm CuEDTA standard. Luminescence was monitored on a PerkinElmer fluorimeter with excitation wavelength of 300 nm, and emissions were scanned from 350 to 700 nm. An excitation slit of 5 nm and emission slit of 15 nm and a 350 nm bandpass filter were used. The copper concentration of the protein samples was measured using a PerkinElmer (AAnalyst 100) atomic absorption spectrophotometer or an Optima (3100XL) ICP spectrometer (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences). Circular dichroism spectra, recorded on an Aviv 62DS spectrometer at room temperature using a 0.3-cm cuvette path length, are the average of three scans. Assays—A bathocuproine sulfonate (BCS) assay was used to determine the Cu(I) content of the protein samples. The appearance of a Cu(BCS)2 complex was measured by monitoring the absorbance at 483 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 12,250 cm–1 m–1. Protein was quantified by amino acid analysis after hydrolysis in 5.7 n HCl at 110 °C in vacuo on a Beckman 6300 analyzer. Mitochondrial Translation Studies—Cells were pulse-labeled for 60 min at 37 °C in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 200 μCi/ml [35S]methionine, anisomycin (100 μg/ml) and a reversible cytosolic translation inhibitor and chased for up to 17.5 h in regular Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Total cellular protein (50 μg) was resuspended in loading buffer containing 93 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 7.5% glycerol, 3.5% SDS, 0.25 mg of bromphenol blue/ml, and 3% mercaptoethanol, sonicated for 3–8 s, loaded, and run on 12–20% polyacrylamide gradient gels. Immunoblot Analysis of Yeast Proteins—Protein (10–50 μg) from the mitochondrial fraction was electrophoresed on a 15% SDS-PAGE system and transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (50 mm Na2PO4, 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.0), 0.01% Tween 20, and 10% milk solution) prior to detection with appropriate antibodies and visualization with Pierce chemiluminescence reagents using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Antiserum to porin (Por1) was from Molecular Probes. Rabbit anti-Sco1 antiserum was generated as described previously (18Nittis T. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42520-42526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Immunoblot Analysis of Human Proteins—Immortalized human fibroblasts and myoblasts were differentially permeabilized using digitonin to generate mitochondrially enriched fractions and were subsequently solubilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1.5% lauryl maltoside supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) (10Leary S.C. Kaufman B.A. Pellechia G. Gguercin G.-H. Mattman A. Jaksch M. Shoubridge E.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1839-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein were fractionated on 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blotted with polyclonal antisera raised against human Sco1 and CoxII and a monoclonal anti-Por1 antibody (Calbiochem). Following incubation with the relevant secondary antibody, immunoreactive proteins were detected by luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Miscellaneous—Protein concentration and CcO and citrate synthase activities in human cell lines were measured as described elsewhere (10Leary S.C. Kaufman B.A. Pellechia G. Gguercin G.-H. Mattman A. Jaksch M. Shoubridge E.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1839-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Immortalized fibroblasts from a SCO1 patient with the P174L substitution exhibited a severe deficiency in CcO, which is reflected in both low residual enzyme activity and low steady-state levels of CoxII protein (Fig. 1, A and C). Transduction of patient fibroblasts with a retroviral virus overexpressing SCO1 completely restored wild-type CcO activity (Fig. 1A) (10Leary S.C. Kaufman B.A. Pellechia G. Gguercin G.-H. Mattman A. Jaksch M. Shoubridge E.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1839-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of the P174L mutant SCO1 only partially rescued the CcO deficiency (Fig. 1A). These changes in CcO activity were accompanied by parallel increases in the steady-state levels of CoxII protein (Fig. 1C). Residual CcO activity in P174L-overexpressing SCO1 patient fibroblasts could be further increased by supplementing the growth media with Cu-His (Fig. 1A), an effect that was not attributable to altered levels of Sco1 protein (data not shown) These data demonstrate that the P174L mutant Sco1 retains sufficient residual function to allow for some assembly of the CcO holoenzyme. Although the reduced CcO activity in SCO1 patient cells could be due in part to reduced Sco1 protein levels (10Leary S.C. Kaufman B.A. Pellechia G. Gguercin G.-H. Mattman A. Jaksch M. Shoubridge E.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1839-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C), the inability of overexpressed P174L Sco1 mutant to fully restore CcO activity argues that some aspect of its function is impaired. We previously showed that overexpression of either of the Sco proteins in the reciprocal patient background exerts a dominant-negative effect on CcO activity (10Leary S.C. Kaufman B.A. Pellechia G.

To evaluate whether the P174L substitution affected this genetic interaction between Sco1 and Sco2, we overexpressed either the wild-type or the P174L mutant Sco1 in SCO2 patient fibroblasts. Both wild-type and mutant Sco1 proteins exerted a comparable dominant-negative effect on residual CcO activity and residual CoxII protein levels (Fig. 1, B and D). This phenotype was robust and could not be perturbed by the presence of Cu-His in the growth media. These results suggest that at least a fraction of overexpressed P174L Sco1 is metallated in SCO2 fibroblasts. To further evaluate the molecular defect in the P174L mutant Sco1, N-terminal truncates of wild-type and P174L human Sco1 were expressed and purified (13Horng Y.-C. Leary S.C. Cobine P.A.

Both wild-type Sco1 and the P174L mutant protein eluted from gel filtration in fractions corresponding to monomeric molecules, and each contained 0.9 mol eq of copper (Table 1). Dialysis of the copper-containing proteins overnight in 1 mm EDTA/1 mm dithiothreitol resulted in only a slight depletion of bound copper; both wild-type and P174L Sco1 proteins retained 0.8 mol eq bound copper. The copper binding avidity to wild-type and P174L Sco1 was therefore similar. Titration of the proteins with varying levels of the Cu(I)-specific chelator BCS revealed a similar BCS concentration dependence in Cu(I) depletion, further suggesting that Cu(I) coordination is similar in the two proteins (Fig. 2).TABLE 1Cu(I) and Cu(II) binding stoichiometry of human Sco1 and Sco1 P174LTotal Cu/proteinCu(II)/proteinPost-dialysis total Cu/proteinPost-dialysis Cu(II)/proteinmol eqmol eqmol eqmol eqhSco10.94 ± 0.10.40 ± 0.050.80 ± 0.10.40 ± 0.07hSco1 P174L0.95 ± 0.10.44 ± 0.050.78 ± 0.20.42 ± 0.05 Open table in a new tab The Cu(II) content, assessed by the quantity of copper that is not BCS-titratable, was 0.4 mol eq for both the wild-type and P174L Sco1 (Table 1). Absorption spectroscopy of purified wild-type Sco1 revealed the expected transitions of the Cu(II) chromophore in the visible spectral region with maxima at 360 and 480 nm (Fig. 3A). The P174L Sco1 exhibited the same transitions, confirming that the mutant Sco1 binds Cu(II) in a manner analogous to that of the wild-type protein. Comparable Cu(II) coordination between wild-type and P174L Sco1 was further confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy; both proteins exhibited similar hyperfine splitting of the gz component of the Cu(II) signal (Fig. 3B). Far UV circular dichroism revealed that the wild-type and mutant Sco1 proteins exhibited similar bulk structure, with comparable ellipticity in the two proteins, suggesting that the P174L substitution fails to grossly perturb the tertiary conformation of the protein (Fig. 4). Collectively, these data strongly suggest that the molecular defect caused by the P174L substitution does not result from aberrant copper binding.FIGURE 4Far UV circular dichroism spectra of purified hSco1 and hSco1 P174L.

To investigate whether P174L Sco1 can be metallated by Cox17, purified wild-type and mutant Sco1 proteins were initially tested in an in vitro transfer assay. CuCox17 exhibits a characteristic luminescence at 580 nm that, upon addition of apo-Sco1, leads to an attenuation in emission due to Cu(I) transfer (19Horng Y.C. Cobine P.A. Maxfield A.B. Carr H.S. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35334-35340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The addition of apo-hSco1 to CuCox17 resulted in a rapid attenuation in the Cox17 luminescence (Fig. 5A). Subsequent purification of hSco1 by Ni-NTA chromatography and quantitation of bound copper confirmed that the quenching of Cox17 luminescence was attributable to copper transfer (Fig. 5C). The eluate contained only hSco1, and thus the observed copper transfer between Cox17 and hSco1 was likely mediated by transient interactions between the two proteins (Fig. 5D). The specificity of the Cu(I) transfer from Cox17 to hSco1 was verified by using a C57Y mutant, Cox17, that we previously demonstrated as failing to transfer Cu(I) to yeast Sco1 (19Horng Y.C.

As found earlier, incubation of hSco1 with the yeast C57Y mutant Cox17 failed to show any Cu(I) transfer as assessed by the lack of diminution in the Cox17 emission spectrum (Fig. 5A). In contrast to wild-type hSco1, incubation of CuCox17 with P174L hSco1 failed to show either a diminution in CuCox17 emission or Cu(I) transfer after recovery of the mutant protein (Fig. 5,"

Thus, overexpression of HAP4 has been shown to result in a 10% increase in the respiratory capacity. Here the physiology of a HAP4-deleted S. cerevisiae strain was investigated, and we found that the hap4Δ S. cerevisiae exhibited poor growth on ethanol, although the growth rate on glucose was indifferent from the wild type in aerobic as well as anaerobic cultures. Moreover, it exhibited a large (75%) reduction in the critical glucose uptake rate at which fermentative metabolism is onset, indicating a substantial reduction in respiratory capacity. We also performed whole genome transcription analysis for the hap4Δ and the wild type, grown in carbon-limited chemostat cultures operated at a dilution rate of 0.05 h–1. Although both strains exhibited respiratory metabolism, there was significant change in expression of many genes in the hap4Δ strain. These genes are involved in several different parts of the metabolism, including oxidative stress response, peroxisomal functions, and energy generation. This study strongly indicates that Hap4 activation only occurs at intermediate specific growth rates, below which the transcription of genes responsible for respiration is dependent on the Hap2/3/5 complex and above which the Hap4 protein augments the transcription. Furthermore, statistical analysis of the transcription data and integration of the data with a genome scale metabolic network provided new insight and evidence for the role of Hap4 in transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial respiration.

Furthermore, statistical analysis of the transcription data and integration of the data with a genome scale metabolic network provided new insight and evidence for the role of Hap4 in transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial respiration. Respiration plays a central role in providing Gibbs free energy required for growth and overall cellular function. The respiratory chain is closely coupled with the operation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle as it ensures oxidation of NADH generated in this cycle. Proper functioning of respiration is therefore essential not only for providing Gibbs free energy but also for operation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Consequently, many metabolic diseases result either directly or indirectly from altered functioning of respiration. Moreover, respiration and energy metabolism are of particular interest in metabolic engineering, where the objective may be to design new cell factories for production of chemicals that demand energy for their synthesis. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is not only an important cell factory for production of fuels, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals but also serves as an important eukaryotic model organism for studying human diseases, thus making it an attractive model for studying respiration. In S. cerevisiae, the heme-activated protein complex Hap2/3/4/5 plays a major role in orchestrating the transcription of genes involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the electron transport chain, ATP generation, and mitochondrial biogenesis by binding to the CCAAT box at the upstream activation sequence of genes encoding enzymes of these pathways (1Forsburg S.L. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1166-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Binding is believed to take place at the consensus sequence TNRTTGGT, and it is primarily found to occur at relatively low glucose uptake rates, i.e. when there is solely respiratory metabolism on glucose, and during growth on carbon sources that require respiratory metabolism, e.g. ethanol, acetate, and glycerol (2Zitomer R.S. Lowry C.V. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA binding capability of the Hap complex is conferred by the Hap2/3/5 proteins, and Hap4 enhances their activity via its activation domain. Hap4 has also been found to possess at least two distinct trans-activation domains, each of which has different levels of dependence on co-activation proteins (3Stebbins J.L. Triezenberg S.J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vitro experiments have shown that the mechanism involved in translation of HAP4 mRNA shifts from the cap-dependent to completely IRES 2The abbreviations used are: IRES, internal ribosome entry site; WT, wild type. (4Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996Google Scholar)-dependent translation at derepressed conditions. In vivo experiments have confirmed that the IRES-dependent translational efficiency was at a low level at the beginning of the stationary growth phase and was enhanced during the glucose-exhausted phase, indicating that there is an increase in the level of the Hap4 protein under glucose-derepressing conditions due to a shift toward IRES-dependent translation (5Seino A. Yanagida Y. Aizawa M. Kobatake E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1681: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Although the other members of the complex are constitutively expressed, the expression of HAP4 is regulated by the carbon source and is up-regulated manyfold upon glucose exhaustion (6DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3699) Google Scholar). Glucose represses the expression of HAP4 via the Mig1 pathway and thereby activation of respiration is prevented at high glucose concentrations. However, loss of function of Mig1 alone does not result in constitutive activation of respiration and the tricarboxylic acid cycle 3S. L. Westergaard, A. P. Oliveira, C. Bro, L. Olsson, and J. Nielsen, submitted for publication. (7Gombert A. Moreira dos Santos M. Christensen B. Nielsen J. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1441-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Under fermentative conditions, yeasts have compromised mitochondrial function, and the control of the tricarboxylic acid cycle genes might take place by a synergistic action of the retrograde genes (retrograde signaling becomes operative when cells sense dysfunctional mitochondrion) and the Hap complex. The transcription factor Rtg2, for example, is known to upregulate three genes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, viz. CIT1, ACO1, and IDH1, and the anapleurotic reaction toward oxaloacetate encoded by PYC2, to match the increased requirement for precursor metabolites for amino acid biosynthesis (8Liu Z. Butow R.A.

Science. 1987; 235: 576-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Even though the name of the gene suggests that Hap4 is activated by heme, neither the heme nor the oxygen regulation of the Hap complex is clearly understood. Tai et al. (11Tai S.L. Boer V.M. ran-Lapujade P. Walsh M.C. De Winde J.H. Daran J.M. Pronk J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 437-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) report that HAP4 mRNA is present in carbon-limited cultivations even under anaerobic conditions where Hap4 has no obvious role. The promoter of HAP4 has three carbon source responsive elements (12Brons J.F. De J.M. Valens M. Grivell L.A. Bolotin-Fukuhara M. Blom J. Yeast. 2002; 19: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), which require a functional Cat8 for the activation (a transcription factor that activates gluconeogenic genes); however, deletion of CAT8 had no effect on the steady state level of HAP4 expression (13Haurie V. Perrot M. Mini T. Jeno P. Sagliocco F. Boucherie H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 76-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It has not been proven in vivo that Mig1 binds to the HAP4 promoter even though it is generally accepted that HAP4 expression is under glucose repression via Mig1. Moreover, deletion of MIG1 together with HAP4 overexpression was found to result in further derepression of the SUC2 gene compared with a mig1Δ control (14Lascaris R. Piwowarski J. van der Spek S.H. Teixeira de M.J. Grivell L. Blom J. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 929-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), indicating a possible role of Hap4 in Mig1-mediated glucose repression. Overexpression of HAP4 has been shown to result in a 10% increase in the respiratory capacity (seen as an increase in the dilution rate in a chemostat culture at which there is onset of fermentation), implying that Hap4 activity is limiting the respiratory metabolism (15van Maris A.J. Bakker B.M. Brandt M. Boorsma A. Teixeira de Mattos M.J. Grivell L.A. Pronk J.T. Blom J. FEMS Yeast Res. 2001; 1: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The increased level of respiration because of overexpression of HAP4 has been shown further to result in an extended life span of yeast (16Lin S. Kaeberlain M. Andalis A. Sturtz L. Defossez P. Culotta V. Fink G. Guarente L. Nature. 2002; 418: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Homologues of HAP4 have also been found in many related and distant yeasts. In Kluyveromyces lactis, expression of HAP4 is constitutive, and deletion resulted in no distinct phenotype on respiratory substrates (17Buschlen S. Amillet J.-M. Guiard B. Fournier A. Marcireau C. Bolotin-Fukuhara M. Comp. Funct. Genomics. 2003; 4: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), whereas in S. cerevisiae deletion of HAP4 almost abrogates growth on glycerol or ethanol. By genome-wide transcription analysis of deletion mutants of HAP2 and HAP4, it has been found that a number of genes related to mitochondrial biogenesis and translation had changed expression (17Buschlen S. Amillet J.-M. Guiard B. Fournier A. Marcireau C. Bolotin-Fukuhara M. Comp. Funct. Genomics. 2003; 4: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The study was based on shake flask cultivations in YPGalactose medium, to prevent repression of the respiratory genes by the use of glucose. However, there have not been any studies on the effect of deleting HAP4 during growth on glucose. We therefore conducted a characterization and transcription analysis of a HAP4 deletion mutant grown on a minimal medium at defined physiological states (chemostat cultures). The microarray data were also analyzed by using an integrative algorithm (18Patil K.R. Nielsen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2685-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) for identification of reporter metabolites (metabolites around which the most significant expression changes occur, see “Materials and Methods” for detailed description) and metabolic subnetworks (connected metabolic subnetworks with significant collective transcriptional response, see “Materials and Methods” for detailed description). Strains—S. cerevisiae strains employed in the study were CEN.PK 113-7D (wild type (WT); MATa MAL2-8cSUC2) and CEN.PK 517-1A (MATa MAL2-8c SUC2 HAP4::loxP-Kan-loxP). The strains were stored at –80 °C suspended in yeast extract, peptone, and dextrose medium containing 20% glycerol. Before each experiment, cells from the stock were plated out to YPD medium and incubated at 30 °C for 24 h before use. Batch Fermentations—The shake flask and the fermentation medium employed were the same and were prepared according to Ref. 19Verduyn C. Postma E. Scheffers W.A. van Dijken J.P. Yeast. 1992; 8: 501-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar. A single colony was inoculated from a fresh YPD plate to the shake flask and kept in an orbital shaker set at 150 rpm and at a temperature of 30 °C for 24 h. The medium used in the fermentor was exactly the same as the inoculation medium except that the batch cultivations had 20 g/liter glucose and the anaerobic medium was supplemented with ergosterol and Tween 80 (20Verduyn C. Postma E. Scheffers W.A. van Dijken J.P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Batch experiments were carried out in a Braun Biostat B reactor with a working volume of 2 liters. The temperature was controlled at 30 °C. The aeration rate employed for the batch cultivation was 0.5 volume of air/volume of liquid volume/min, whereas the anaerobic culture was sparged with N2, both of which were filtered through a 0.22-μm sterile membrane filter. The pH was controlled at 5 by the automatic addition of 2 m KOH. The agitation was maintained at 800 rpm. The culture vessel was inoculated with an initial absorbance (λ = 600 nm) of 0.02 from an exponentially growing shake flask culture. The exhaust gas was passed through a condenser, maintained at a temperature of 6 °C by circulating cooled water, before entering the gas analyzer. 15-ml samples were taken for biomass, optical density, and metabolite analysis. The concentration of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the exhaust gas was determined by use of an acoustic gas analyzer (Brüel & Kjær, Denmark). Chemostat Cultivations—The chemostat experiments were also carried out in Braun Biostat B (with all the process variables maintained same as mentioned in the aerobic batch) but with a working volume of 1 liter, initially as a batch mode for 24 h until glucose depletion and then switched to a chemostat mode, at a dilution rate of 0.05 h–1 by continuous addition of medium (feed concentration of glucose, 10 g/liter). 15-ml samples were taken for biomass, optical density, and metabolite analysis every 20 h (time taken for 1 volume change). Steady state was assumed to be reached after at least 5 volume changes had passed since the last change in growth conditions, and when the CO2 evolution and the biomass concentration had remained constant during at least two volume changes (±3%). Productostat—A productostat was used to obtain a steady state dilution rate that corresponds with a given ethanol concentration. Ethanol was measured online by a sensor placed in the outlet gas stream. The sensor used (measuring the content of reduced gases) was the Figaro TGS 822 (Hammer Electronic, Elsinore, Denmark). The set point (1 V) for the voltage of the sensor was found to correlate with an ethanol concentration in the cultivation broth of 30–60 mg/liter. The dilution rate controller was a proportional-integral controller with a nonlinear error term to account for the nonlinear behavior of the ethanol concentration around the critical dilution rate (21Lei F. Dynamics and Nonlinear Phenomena in Continuous Cultivations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark2001Google Scholar). The bioreactor was operated as batch cultivation for ∼24 h until glucose depletion, and then it was shifted to chemostat operation. When there was no more ethanol in the fermentation medium, operation of the bioreactor shifted to productostat mode. In this mode the controller increased the dilution rate until there was a stable low ethanol measurement, which could be maintained for several residence times with a very low standard deviation. Biomass Determination—A 5-ml sample in duplicate was filtered using a pre-dried, pre-weighed 0.45-μm filter and washed with distilled water. The filter with wet biomass was dried in a microwave oven at 150 watts for 15 min. The biomass concentration was calculated from the difference of the weights. Extracellular Metabolite Determination—The glucose concentration during the course of the fermentations was analyzed using a 1-ml sample from the reactor, which was filtered immediately through a 0.45-μm filter (Frisenette ApS, Denmark). Glucose, glycerol, succinate, and ethanol were detected by measurement of the refractive index, whereas acetate and pyruvate were determined by a UV detector, in a Waters high pressure liquid chromatography fitted with a Bio-Rad HPX-87H column and maintained at a temperature of 60 °C, using an autosampler. The eluent used was 5 mm H2SO4, at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. Transcription Analysis—Metabolic oscillations were persistent in the HAP4-deleted strain, and we were unable to avoid the oscillations. All samples were therefore taken when the CO2 partial pressure in the exhaust gas exhibited a maximum. To evaluate the possible effect of the oscillations, a single sample was also taken when the CO2 partial pressure in the exhaust gas exhibited a minimum. Three 20-ml samples were taken from each steady state (and as mentioned one additional sample for the oscillating culture) using a syringe, injected directly into a Falcon tube (precooled in liquid N2), and spun for 5 min at 4000 rpm. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was stored at –80 °C until further use. Total RNA extraction was performed with FastRNA® Pro Red kit (Qbiogene) following the manufacturer's instructions with minor modifications. cRNA was synthesized as described in the Affymetrix Gene-Chip® Expression Analysis Manual, after which 15 μg were hybridized to Yeast Genome S98 oligonucleotide arrays (Affymetrix). Microarrays were scanned in an Agilent gene array scanner (Affymetrix), followed by raw data processing, which was performed with the Microarray Suite software, version 5.0, with a global scaling factor for target intensity equal to 500. Average difference values, representing the absolute hybridization intensities, were then calculated for each probe set. The microarray data were first normalized using dChip software suit (dChip, version 1.3; Wong Laboratory, Harvard School of Public Health and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston). Expression levels of all 9335 probe sets were calculated with the Perfect Match model using dChip version 1.3. From the 9335 probe sets in the array, the expression level of 6079 annotated unique open reading frames from the Saccharomyces Genome Data base were extracted. Using the absent/present call as calculated by GeneChip® Operation software, transcripts found to be absent in all arrays were excluded. Hence, the forthcoming analyses were performed on the remaining 5814 transcripts. Significance of expression change was calculated in terms of p values for all the genes using Student's t test. Reporter Metabolite and Subnetwork Analysis—Gene expression changes in response to HAP4 deletion were mapped on the genome scale metabolic model of S. cerevisiae (22Forster J. Famili I. Fu P. Palsson B.O. Nielsen J. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 244-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar) in order to identify metabolic hot spots with respect to transcriptional regulation. The analysis involved identification of so-called reporter metabolites, defined as metabolites around which significant transcriptional changes were observed, and enzyme subnetworks with maximum transcriptional response. All enzymes/reactions in the genome scale metabolic model were scored based on the significance value of change in the expression of the corresponding gene by using the t test. Metabolites were then scored based on the average score of its k neighboring enzymes, and corrected for the number of neighbors and background distribution by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of average scores of 10,000 randomly selected enzyme groups of size k. The corrected score was then converted to the p value by using normal cumulative distribution. Top scoring metabolites were selected for further analysis. To uncover the global coordinated response of the genes across different pathways, the genome scale model was first converted to an enzyme interaction graph where enzymes were represented as nodes and metabolites as interaction. Enzyme subnetwork(s) (any connected set of enzymes) with maximum average score (corrected for the background distribution and size) were then identified by using a simulated annealing algorithm. HAP4 Deletion Mutant Is Phenotypically Indifferent from WT in Aerobic and Anaerobic Batch Cultivation for Growth on Glucose—To evaluate whether Hap4 influences unrestricted growth on glucose, duplicate batch fermentations with the hap4Δ strain under aerobic as well as anaerobic conditions were carried out with 20 g/liter glucose in a minimal medium (see “Materials and Methods”). From these experiments the maximum specific growth rate and the overall yield coefficients, i.e. biomass formation and ethanol production per unit of glucose consumed, were determined. The results (Table 1) show the characteristic growth behavior of S. cerevisiae at high glucose uptake rates, i.e. there is fermentative metabolism with most of the carbon being directed toward ethanol with concomitant secretion of pyruvate, acetate, glycerol, and succinate. The yield of biomass was about 0.1 g per g of glucose consumed, both at aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions. The results show that deletion of HAP4 had little or no effect on the specific growth rate, compared with the wild type both aerobically as well as anaerobically. Similarly, as the yield coefficients are almost the same for the two strains, there is no major shift in overall flux distribution upon deletion of HAP4.TABLE 1Physiological parameters obtained from duplicate batch cultivations with the hap4Δ mutantStrainConditionμmaxYsxYsacYseYspyrYsgRef.hap4ΔAerobic0.270.110.00220.380.00490.081hap4ΔAnaerobic0.30.11ND0.410.00270.1WTAerobic0.310.100.00420.34ND0.07337Westergaard S.L.

Bakker B.M. Brandt M. Boorsma A. Teixeira de Mattos M.J. Grivell L.A. Pronk J.T. Blom J. FEMS Yeast Res. 2001; 1: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, as the hap4Δ strain could show completely respiratory metabolism at very low glucose uptake rates, it can be concluded that Hap4 is not solely responsible for activation of respiration. hap4Δ Cells Exhibit Respiratory Growth at a Dilution Rate of 0.05 h–1—To understand better the respiratory behavior of the mutant at dilution rates below the critical dilution rate, we performed whole genome transcription analysis in glucose-limited chemostat cultures operated at a dilution rate of 0.05 h–1. The respiratory growth at this dilution rate is characterized by a low glucose uptake rate, production of biomass and CO2, and not measurable amounts of ethanol and other metabolites (Table 2). In the chemostat cultures with the hap4Δ mutant there was sustained oscillations (observed from the CO2 measurements in the off gas) within a period of about 5.5 h (oscillations were not observed at dilution rates above the critical dilution rate). Oscillations started after the washout of ethanol that was produced during the initial batch phase. Normally oscillations occur at low dilution rates in a carbon-limited chemostat, even in WT, and are prevented by briefly imposing oxygen limitation. With the hap4Δ mutant it was not possible, however, to avoid the sustained oscillations by introducing small perturbations to the system.TABLE 2Physiological parameters observed during the chemostat cultivationsYsxqsqCO2qO2DRQWT0.48 ± 0.000.51 ± 0.001.2 ± 0.001.2 ± 0.040.045 ± 0.000.98 ± 0.02hap4Δ0.48 ± 0.000.57 ± 0.001.46 ± 0.001.69 ± 0.120.049 ± 0.000.87 ± 0.05 Open table in a new tab Transcriptional Profiling during Respiring Conditions—The use of chemostat cultures enabled analysis of the role of Hap4 in respiratory metabolism at low glucose uptake rates. For a p value cut-off of 0.01 and 0.05, there were 90 and 390 genes significantly changed, respectively. Of the 390 genes, 122 had no known function (supplemental Table S1). The significantly changed genes with known functions are depicted in Fig. 2. Changes in mRNA expression were found to span several different parts of the metabolic network, including carbohydrate metabolism, energy generation, mitochondrial dynamics, amino acid metabolism, stress response and detoxification, and DNA repair. Reporter Metabolites and Subnetwork Analysis Reveal Changes Associated with Redox, Tricarboxylic Acid Intermediates, and Ethanol—To further analyze the transcription data in the context of the whole metabolism, we used an algorithm reported by Patil and Nielsen (18Patil K.R. Nielsen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2685-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) to identify small but biologically significant and coordinated changes following deletion of HAP4. Reporter metabolites were calculated as the metabolites around which the most significant and coordinated expression changes occurred in the HAP4-deleted mutant as compared with the WT (Table 3). This list highlights metabolites involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (e.g. α-ketoglutarate and isocitrate) and metabolites playing an important role in redox balancing and fermentative pathway in yeast (e.g. NADH, acetaldehyde, and ethanol). Interestingly, the top scoring metabolite found is CO2, indicating major transcriptional changes in the genes involved in the oxidation/respiration. Certain metabolites related to amino acid and nucleotide metabolism also appear on the list, showing the multitude of effects HAP4 deletion caused in reprogramming the mRNA expression of the metabolic network.TABLE 3Reporter metabolites with significant normalized transcriptional response of the neighboring genes (see “Materials and Methods” for detailed description) while comparing expression in wild type and hap4Δ strainMetaboliteNo. of neighborsCO237(RS)-Lactoylglutathione1Glutathione15′-Phosphoribosyl-N-formylglycinamide2Acetaldehyde12NADH41Ethanol55′-Phosphoribosylglycinamide2Acetaldehyde3Coproporphyrinogen2Cytosine4Citrate2Isocitrate52-Oxoglutarate21Methylglyoxal1Guanine6d-Glucosamine 1-phosphate1Heme1Malate5Palmitoyl-CoA2 Open table in a new tab Consistent with these findings, the significantly co-regulated metabolic subnetwork (Table 4) also consisted of many genes related to mitochondrial respiration and redox metabolism. This subnetwork spans many branches of the metabolism indicating the tight connection of regulatory mechanisms across them. This is expected, as changes in redox genes will demand readjustment of many cellular pathways to adjust metabolite levels to the new steady state or to maintain homeostasis. Notably, certain transport-related genes (YOR071C, HIP1, and HXT16) are also part of this subnetwork supporting this hypothesis.TABLE 4Genes identified as part of the metabolic subnetwork with maximum normalized transcriptional response (see “Materials and Methods” for detailed description) while comparing expression in wild type and hap4Δ strainGene name/open reading frameEnzymatic functionp valueAAT2Aspartate aminotransferase0.0052ADE5,7Phosphoribosylamine-glycine ligase0.1504ADE8Phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase0.0034ADH2Alcohol dehydrogenase II0.0023ADH4Alcohol dehydrogenase IV0.0278ALD4Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase0.0005CAR2Ornithine aminotransferase0.0027CPA2Carbamyl-phosphate synthetase0.0320CTP1Mitochondrial inner membrane citrate transport protein0.0240DAK2Dihydroxyacetone kinase0.0004FAA1Long chain fatty acid CoA ligase0.0198FCY1Cytosine deaminase0.0180FDH1Formate dehydrogenase0.0010GLK1Glucokinase0.0361HEM13Coproporphyrinogen III oxidase0.0201HIP1Histidine permease0.0136HXT16Hexose transporter0.0264IDP3NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase0.0099LCB1Serine C-palmitoyltransferase0.0007LYS1Saccharopine dehydrogenase0.0099MAE1Mitochondrial malic enzyme0.0112MET12Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase0.0302MET2Homoserine O-acetyltransferase0.0262OAC1Mitochondrial oxaloacetate transporter0.0067PMP1Plasma membrane proteolipid (ATPase)0.0259PNP1Purine nucleoside phosphorylase0.0206PSD1Phosphatidylserine decarboxylase0.0174SAH1Adenosylhomocysteinase0.0226SER13-Phosphoserine transaminase0.0198SUR2Hydroxylase involved in sphingolipid metabolism0.0253TDH1Triose-phosphate dehydrogena"

Recently, we showed that the magnitude of Stat3 binding to three IL-6 motifs on the human γFBG promoter correlates negatively with their functional activity in hepatocytes, although these cis-elements are critical for promoter activity. We determined the role of IL-6-receptor-gp130-Stat3 signaling in IL-6 activation of the γFBG promoter in liver and lung epithelial cells. Although IL-6 induced γFBG promoter activity ∼30-fold in HepG2 cells, it was increased only 2-fold in lung A549 cells. Equivalent production of gp130 was demonstrated in both cell types by Western blotting; however, lower production of both IL-6-receptor and Stat3 explains, in part, reduced activity of the γFBG promoter in lung cells. Dexamethasone potentiated IL-6 induction of the γFBG promoter 2.3-fold in both HepG2 and A549 cells for a combined increase in promoter activity of 70-fold or 4.5-fold, respectively. Dexamethasone potentiation is likely due to the induction of IL-6-receptor expression as well as prolonged intensity and duration of Stat3 activation. By circumventing IL-6-receptor-gp130-coupled signaling with ectopic expression of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (GCSFR)-gp130(133) chimeric receptor, overexpression of Stat3 induced γFBG promoter activity 30-fold in A549 cells.

In addition, FBG plays an important role in homeostasis. Disrupters of homeostasis, such as infection, inflammation, tissue injury, or neoplasia, result in the activation of the acute phase response. During inflammation, both local and systemic responses occur resulting in activation of various cell types to produce proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and IL-6 (1Baumann H. Gauldie J. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 74-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). FBG is one of a number of acute phase proteins (APPs) up-regulated 2–10-fold during inflammation (2Heinrich P.C. Castell J.V. Andus T. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 621-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (2262) Google Scholar, 3Huber P. Laurent M. Dalmon J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5695-5701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Otto J.M.

Increased levels of plasma FBG augment the immune responses of the host to restore homeostasis (reviewed in Ref. 5Bini A. Simpson-Haidaris P.J. Kudryk B.J. Bikfalvi A. Encyclopedic Reference of Vascular Biology and Pathology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2000: 107-125Google Scholar). FBG serves as a substratum for epithelial (6Donaldson D.J. Mahan J.T. Amrani D.

Furthermore, FBG and fibrin degradation products stimulate fibroblast proliferation (9Gray A.J. Bishop J.E. Reeves J.T. Laurent G.J. J.

Although the liver is the major site of plasma FBG production, epithelial cells from extrahepatic tissues, including respiratory epithelium, are capable of producing FBG (10Simpson-Haidaris P.J.

Little constitutive expression of the three FBG genes, fga, fbg, and fgg, occurs in lung cells; however, de novo synthesis is induced by IL-6 and glucocorticoids (GCs) (10Simpson-Haidaris P.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 873-882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Simpson-Haidaris P.J. Courtney M.A. Wright T.W. Goss R. Harmsen A. Gigliotti F. Infect.

Lung-derived FBG is secreted from the basolateral surface of alveolar epithelial cells, where it is deposited into the extracellular matrix (22Guadiz G. Sporn L.A. Goss R.A. Lawrence S.O. Marder V.J. Simpson-Haidaris P.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). IL-1β down-regulates constitutive and IL-6-induced FBG production in liver and lung epithelial cells. However, GC treatment overcomes IL-1β-mediated inhibition of fga, fbg, and fgg expression and FGB protein production in a lung epithelial cell type-specific manner (23Nguyen M.D. Simpson-Haidaris P.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Stat3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; also known as acute phase response factor) is the major transcription factor mediating regulation of IL-6-responsive APP genes. GCs have a synergistic effect on IL-6-mediated up-regulation of type II APP genes including FBG (24Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). Recently, we defined a minimal promoter-enhancer region of the human fgg that is regulated by IL-6 and GCs in liver HepG2 epithelial cells (25Duan H.O. Simpson-Haidaris P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41270-41281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Three type II IL-6 response elements (IL-6REs) were identified and shown to be critical for transactivation of the γFBG promoter by IL-6; however, the magnitude of Stat3 binding to these elements correlates negatively with their functional activity (25Duan H.O. Simpson-Haidaris P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41270-41281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Based on the aforementioned observations, we hypothesized that FBG production is regulated systemically (liver) and locally (lung) in a cell type-specific manner during inflammation. We investigated mechanisms that account, at least in part, for the different induction patterns of γFBG by IL-6 and GCs in lung A549 when compared with liver HepG2 epithelial cells. Cell Culture, Reagents, and Antibodies—HepG2 and A549 cells were grown as described previously (10Simpson-Haidaris P.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 873-882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant human proteins, IL-6, soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), were purchased from Research Diagnostics, Inc. (Flanders, NJ), and dexamethasone (DEX) was from Sigma. Mouse monoclonal antibody against total Stat3 (F-2)X and Tyr705-p-Stat3 (B-7), rabbit polyclonal antibody to Ser727-p-Stat3 (sc-8001-R), IL-6Rα (C-20) and gp130 (H-255), and goat anti-actin (C-11) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal antibody J88B, which specifically recognizes human γFBG, was produced as described (26Odrljin T.M. Rybarczyk B.J. Francis C.W. Lawrence S.O. Hamaguchi M. Simpson-Haidaris P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1298: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Cells were grown under various conditions as described in the figure legends. After treatment, whole cell lysates were prepared as described (10Simpson-Haidaris P.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 873-882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After determining the protein concentration by Bradford assay, equivalent amounts of protein from the cell lysates were reduced and resolved by SDS-10%-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes; specific proteins were detected by immunoblotting as described previously (25Duan H.O. Simpson-Haidaris P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41270-41281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Blots were stripped and reprobed with antibody to actin to control for the protein load in each lane. Luciferase Reporter Plasmid Construction—A human γFBG promoter construct in pGL2-basic vector containing 1359 bp of the 5′-flanking region of the FBG γ-chain gene (pGL2–1359) was kindly provided by Dr. M. L. Tenchini (University of Milan, Italy) (27Asselta R. Duga S. Modugno M. Malcovati M. Tenchini M.L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 1144-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The chimeric receptor, GCSFR-gp130(133), which is composed of the extracellular domain of human GCSF receptor (GCSFR) fused to the transmembrane and first 133 residues of the cytoplasmic domain of human gp130, and the rat wild type Stat3(WT) were generously provided by Dr. H. Baumann (Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY) (28Lai C.F. Ripperger J. Morella K.K. Wang Y. Gearing D.P. Fey G.H. Baumann H. J. Biol.

Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assays—Transfection was performed using SuperFect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were grown to 40–50% confluence in 35-mm culture dishes and transfected with 1 μg of total DNA including 2.5 ng of pRL-SV40 (Promega, Madison, WI) to control for transfection efficiency. The total amount of DNA was kept constant by adding pSG5 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The amounts of reporter and expression vectors used in each experiment are indicated in the figure legends. After SuperFect-DNA precipitates were incubated with cells for 16–18 h, fresh medium with various concentrations of IL-6 ± DEX was added, and the cells were incubated another 24 h (25Duan H.O. Simpson-Haidaris P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41270-41281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared, and the relative-fold luciferase activity was determined using the Dual-Luciferase reporter kit (Promega). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—After the desired treatment, A549 nuclear extracts were prepared as described (25Duan H.O. Simpson-Haidaris P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41270-41281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The rat α2-macroglobulin (α2M) type II IL-6RE, which binds with high affinity to Stat3 (30Bode J.G. Fischer R. Haussinger D. Graeve L. Heinrich P.C. Schaper F. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1469-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), was used to monitor activation of Stat3 in A549 cells in response to various treatments over time. Double-stranded probes were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase; DNA-protein binding reactions were performed as described (25Duan H.O. Simpson-Haidaris P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41270-41281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) using 2 μg of nuclear extract and 20 fmol of labeled probe for each reaction. Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Two μg of total RNA were reverse-transcribed with RETROscript™ (Ambion, Austin, TX). One-tenth of the mRNA:cDNA heteroduplex was used in the PCR. Oligonucleotide primers used in this study are: Stat3 forward, 5′-ATTCGGGAAGTATTGTCG-3′, Stat3 reverse, 5′-GCCTCAGTCGTATCTTTC-3′; IL-6R forward, 5′-GCTCCACGACTCTGGAAACTATTC-3′, IL-6R reverse, 5′-GTTTTGCTGAACTTGCTCCCGAC-3′; gp130 forward, 5′-GGTACGAATGGCAGCATACACG-3′, gp130 reverse, 5′-CTGGACTGGATTCATGCTGAC-3′. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers were described previously (31Shi R.J. Simpson-Haidaris P.J. Lerner N.B. Marder V.J. Silverman D.J. Sporn L.A. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1070-1075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCR amplification was performed through 35 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min; final extension of PCR products was performed for 7 min at 72 °C. For semiquantitative RT-PCR, products were sampled every fifth cycle beginning at cycle 25 as described (31Shi R.J. Simpson-Haidaris P.J. Lerner N.B. Marder V.J. Silverman D.J. Sporn L.A. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1070-1075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to ensure that the PCR amplification had not reached plateau phase. Equal volumes of reaction mixture from each sample were loaded on a 1.7% agarose gel and resolved by electrophoresis. Images were digitally captured and band intensity analyzed using Kodak 1D image analysis software, version 3.5.3 (Eastman Kodak Co.). Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. The experiments were repeated 3–6 times, and the differences between means were examined for statistically significance (p value <0.05) by two-way analysis of variance using StatView™ (Abacus Concepts Inc., Beverly, CA). Transactivation Potential of the Human γFBG Promoter Is Significantly Reduced in Alveolar Epithelial Cells When Compared with Hepatocytes—In HepG2 cells, pGL2–1359 γFBG promoter activity increased in a dose-dependent and statistically significant manner reaching a maximal 30-fold induction with 50 ng/ml IL-6 (Fig. 1A). These results agree with those previously reported using the minimal 600-bp promoter-enhancer region of the human γFBG gene (25Duan H.O. Simpson-Haidaris P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41270-41281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In contrast, γFBG promoter activity reached only a 2-fold increase over basal levels in A549 cells, although a modest IL-6 dose-dependent increase in γFBG transactivation was observed (Fig. 1, A and B). In the absence of a consensus glucocorticoid response element, DEX potentiates IL-6-induced γFBG promoter activity 2-fold in HepG2 cells (25Duan H.O. Simpson-Haidaris P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41270-41281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the presence of a functional glucocorticoid-response element (27Asselta R. Duga S. Modugno M. Malcovati M. Tenchini M.L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 1144-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), increasing concentrations of DEX alone did not appreciably induce γFBG promoter activity driven by pGL2–1359 in either HepG2 or A549 cells (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, in the presence of 50 ng/ml IL-6, 0.1 μm DEX maximally potentiated by 2.3-fold the IL-6-induced luciferase expression driven by the human γFBG promoter in each cell type, resulting in a combined 70-fold induction in HepG2 cells (p < 0.001) and a 4.5-fold induction in A549 cells (p = 0.0013). Nonstimulated A549 cells constitutively produced ∼1–2% the amount of γFBG protein when compared with the constitutive levels produced by HepG2 cells when compared with similar amounts of actin for each cell type (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, IL-6 induced a corresponding dose-dependent increase in γFBG protein, which was also potentiated ∼2–3-fold by 0.1 μm DEX when compared with 50 ng/ml IL-6 alone in both cell types (Fig. 1C). However, two striking differences were noted. First, maximum potentiation of IL-6-mediated transactivation of the γFBG promoter was achieved at lower concentrations of DEX in A549 cells (0.001 μm) when compared with HepG2 cells (0.1 μm). Second, maximal potentiation of γFBG promoter activity occurred over a broader range of DEX concentrations (0.001–1.0 μm) in A549 than in HepG2 cells (Fig. 1, A and B). Together with our previous observations (10Simpson-Haidaris P.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 873-882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these results demonstrate that lung and liver epithelial cells respond to IL-6 and DEX to produce increased levels of γFBG protein by transcriptional activation of the γFBG promoter. However, the transactivation potential of the human γFBG promoter is significantly reduced in lung when compared with liver epithelial cells. Stat3β mRNA Is Minimally Expressed in Lung and Liver Epithelial Cells—Two naturally occurring isoforms of Stat3 mRNA are produced by differential splicing of the primary transcript. The shorter form, Stat3β, is missing the last 55 C-terminal residues of the longer form, Stat3α, which encode the transactivation domain and Ser727 phosphorylation site (32Caldenhoven E. van Dijk T.B. Solari R. Armstrong J. Raaijmakers J.A. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. de Groot R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13221-13227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 33Yoo J.Y. Huso D.L. Nathans D. Desiderio S. Cell. 2002; 108: 331-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Instead, 7 unique residues in the C terminus of Stat3β replace this region. Stat3β retains its ability to bind to DNA but fails to effectively transactivate gene expression, thereby functioning as a dominant negative to Stat3 signaling. Therefore, to determine whether A549 cells express relatively higher proportions of steady state levels of Stat3β when compared with Stat3α mRNA than that found in HepG2 cells, we performed RT-PCR using primer pairs spanning the Stat3 alternative splicing region. If differential mRNA splicing were responsible for the reduced transactivation of the γFBG promoter, we would expect to find a higher relative abundance of the 261-bp Stat3β RT-PCR product when compared with the 311-bp Stat3α product in A549 when compared with HepG2 cells. RT-PCR results from both cell lines revealed little amplification of the Stat3β fragment (261 bp) (Fig. 2). Although these results do not represent the relative abundance of Stat3 isoform mRNAs between cell types, they do demonstrate that both HepG2 and A549 cells express equivalent but very low steady state levels of Stat3β relative to endogenous Stat3α mRNA. Stat3 mRNA expression was not modulated by IL-6 treatment over 12 h (Fig. 2). These results rule out the possibility that Stat3β interferes with Stat3α transactivation to dampen down γFBG promoter activity in A549 cells. A549 Cells Express Constitutively Low Levels of IL-6R and Stat3 Protein When Compared with HepG2 Cells—It is well established that IL-6 signaling occurs by ligand activation of the high affinity IL-6R and homodimerization of the gp130 transmembrane spanning signal transduction molecule, leading to activation of Stat3 (24Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). To explore other possibilities for the low transactivation potential of the γFBG promoter in response to IL-6 in A549 cells, we tested whether the expression levels of some key components of the IL-6 signaling pathway were different in relationship to the amount of actin expressed in each of these cell lines. Western blotting indicated that these cells produce similar amounts of gp130 protein; however, constitutive levels of both IL-6R and Stat3 were reduced in A549 when compared with HepG2 cells (Fig. 3), suggesting cell type-specific differences in Stat3 signaling in response to IL-6. DEX Induces IL-6R mRNA Expression and Protein Production—A previous study showed that DEX induces IL-6R mRNA expression and protein production in HepG2 cells (34Snyers L. De Wit L. Content J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2838-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine whether DEX treatment changes the expression of IL-6R-gp130-Stat3 signaling components in lung epithelial cells, we employed semiquantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 4A). DEX-induced expression of steady state levels of IL-6R mRNA 1.8-fold by 2 h (p < 0.05) peaked at 2.2-fold after 6 h (p = 0.003) and remained elevated by 2-fold at 12 h (p = 0.0112) after treatment (Fig. 4A). A similar increase in IL-6R protein production was also observed in response to DEX treatment, reaching peak production at 6 h and remaining elevated out to 24 h after treatment (Fig. 4B). The relative fold increase in IL-6R mRNA and protein in response to DEX treatment corresponds with the ∼2.3-fold DEX potentiation of IL-6-mediated γFBG promoter activity (Fig. 1). IL-6 + DEX Induces Elevated and Prolonged Stat3 Activation—A third possibility for reduced IL-6-mediated transactivation of the γFBG promoter in A549 cells was a difference in cell type-specific activation of Stat3. Therefore, we compared the activation profiles of Stat3 in both A549 and HepG2 cells using phospho-Stat3-specific antibodies for Tyr705 and Ser727 when compared with total Stat3 by Western blotting (Fig. 5). In response to 50 ng/ml IL-6, phosphorylation of Stat3-Tyr705 was both rapid and transient in both cell lines; peak Tyr705 phosphorylation was observed within 5 min and remained at or near peak levels for 30 min, after which it was barely discernible (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the kinetics of Ser727 phosphorylation was slower, reaching peak levels in both HepG2 and A549 cells after 120 min of IL-6 treatment and remaining active throughout the entire 4-h treatment. On the other hand, 0.1 μm DEX did not stimulate phosphorylation of Tyr705 in either cell type but instead induced phosphorylation of Ser727 in both HepG2 and A549 cells with similar kinetics observed in response to IL-6 treatment (Fig. 5A). Notably, when given both IL-6 + DEX, there was sustained phosphorylation of Ser727 as well as evidence of biphasic and prolonged phosphorylation of Tyr705 in both cell types, resulting in prolonged intensity and duration of Stat3 activation. To determine whether IL-6 + DEX-sustained activation of Stat3 leads to prolonged nuclear localization, we tested the ability of Stat3 in A549 nuclear extracts to bind to type II IL-6REs in the human γFBG promoter and the rat α2M promoter by EMSA. Activated Stat3 from A549 cells did not bind to any of the three human γFBG type II IL-6REs (not shown); however, this was not surprising for three reasons. First, A549 cells produce lower amounts of Stat3 when compared with HepG2 cells relative to equivalent amounts of actin produced by these cells (Fig. 3). Second, activated Stat3 binds with low affinity to the type II IL-6REs in the γFBG promoter when compared with that in the α2M promoter in HepG2 cells (25Duan H.O. Simpson-Haidaris P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41270-41281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Third, the weak binding of Stat3 to the wild type γFBG IL-6REs is in accord with the general inability to demonstrate complex formation with wild type IL-6 promoter regions of several APP genes (25Duan H.O. Simpson-Haidaris P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41270-41281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Activated Stat3 can act as a transcriptional coactivator without direct association with its DNA binding motif (35Zhang Z. Jones S. Hagood J.S. Fuentes N.L. Fuller G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30607-30610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The combined effects of low affinity binding of Stat3 to the γFBG IL-6REs and reduced amounts of Stat3 precluded detection of Stat3-γFBG promoter DNA complexes from lung A549 cell nuclear extracts. EMSA using the α2M IL-6RE DNA probe revealed that IL-6 induced nuclear translocation and DNA-protein complex formation of activated Stat3 (Fig. 5B), which is consistent with IL-6 induction of rapid and transient phosphorylation of Stat3-Tyr705 (Fig. 5A). After 30–60 min, nuclear accumulation of IL-6-activated Stat3 returned to baseline. However, by 160–240 min, prolonged and sustained nuclear accumulation and α2M DNA-Stat3 complex formation occurred (Fig. 5B). This biphasic activation and nuclear accumulation of Stat3 likely reflects the slower kinetics and prolonged phosphorylation of Ser727 (Fig. 5A). The results shown in Fig. 5A demonstrated that DEX alone failed to stimulate phosphorylation of Stat3 Tyr705, indicating that DEX-mediated phosphorylation of Ser727 is not sufficient for nuclear translocation of Stat3 above baseline (Fig. 5B). Similarly, IL-6 + DEX induced rapid biphasic activation and nuclear localization of Stat3, leading to elevated and sustained DNA-protein complex formation with the α2M IL-6RE (Fig. 5B). Ectopic Expression of GCSFR-gp130(133) and Overexpression of Stat3(WT) Restores the Transactivation Potential of the γFBG Promoter in A549 Cells—The result from Fig. 2 indicated that low expression of IL-6R and Stat3 might play an important role in the significantly reduced activation of the γFBG promoter in A549 cells in response to IL-6. Therefore, we tested whether overexpression of Stat3(WT) would reconstitute IL-6-mediated transactivation of the γFBG promoter in A549 cells to a similar degree observed in HepG2 cells (i.e. from 2- to ∼30-fold, respectively). The overexpression of Stat3(WT) in A549 cells did not affect IL-6 induction of the γFBG promoter (Fig. 6A)(p = not significant), potentially due to the low endogenous levels of IL-6R. However, the addition of sIL-6R failed to restore the full transactivation potential of the γFBG promoter activity in response to IL-6 (not shown). To bypass the need for endogenous IL-6R-gp130 signal transduction, we tested whether overexpression of the chimeric receptor, GCSFR-gp130(133), would overcome the low endogenous activation of the γFBG promoter in A549 cells. In cells expressing the chimeric receptor, dose-dependent GCSF activation of the γFBG promoter was observed, reaching a maximum 9-fold induction (Fig. 6B; p < 0.0001) when compared with the 2-fold activation observed in response to IL-6 in parental A549 cells (Figs. 1 and 6A). By circumventing the IL-6R, endogenous Stat3 has a higher potential to transactivate the γFBG promoter in A549 cells. Overexpression of both GCSFR-gp130(133) and Stat3(WT) induced γFBG promoter activity ∼32-fold in response to 50 ng/ml GCSF (Fig. 6B; in the presence of 10 and 50 ng/ml GCSF and 225 or 450 ng/ml Stat3(WT), all p values <0.0005), which is equivalent to the ∼30-fold induction achieved by IL-6 in HepG2 cells (Fig. 1A). Together, these results indicate that the reduced expression of both IL-6R and Stat3 in A549 cells likely plays a major role in limiting IL-6-induced transactivation of the γFBG promoter in a cell type-specific manner. Stat family members participate in signaling pathways in response to a wide variety of cytokines and growth factors. Stat transcription factors are localized to the cytoplasm in latent form where, upon activation, they dimerize and translocate to the nucleus to activate transcription of target genes. Stat3 was initially identified as acute phase response factor for its role in induction of hepatic APP genes in response to IL-6 during systemic inflammation (36Wegenka U.M. Lutticken C. Buschmann J. Yuan J. Lottspeich F. Muller-Esterl W. Schindler C. Roeb E. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3186-3196Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). However, Stat3 also plays important roles in regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and oncogenic transformation (37Akira S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2607-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 38Hirano T. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2548-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar, 39Dauer D.J. Ferraro B. Song L. Yu B. Mora L. Buettner R. Enkemann S. Jove R. Haura E.B. Oncogene. 2005; 28: 28Google Scholar). Both Stat3 and GCs regulate expression of surfactant proteins, which are critical components for surfactant structure and function in lung homeostasis (40Severgnini M. Takahashi S. Rozo L.M. Homer R.J. Kuhn C. Jhung J.W. Perides G. Steer M. Hassoun P.M. Fanburg B.L. Cochran B.H. Simon A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: L1282-L1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 41Yan C.

Physiol. 1991; 260: L146-L152PubMed Google Scholar). Stat3 also functions as a survival factor to prevent apoptosis (44Lerner L. Henriksen M.A. Zhang X. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2564-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Stat3-induced expression of surfactant protein B is required for remodeling of the alveolar epithelium following oxygen injury (41Yan C. Naltner A. Martin M. Naltner M. Fangman J.M. Gurel O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10967-10972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In transgenic mice that overexpress IL-6 in a lung-specific manner, survival of animals in 100% oxygen-induced injury is markedly enhanced due to diminished alveolar-capillary protein leakage and epithelial cell injury. Furthermore, GCs enhance cell-cell tight junction formation to enhance barrier function and epithelial cell polarity (45Ward N.S. Waxman A.B. Homer R.J. Mantell L.L. Einarsson O. Du Y. Elias J.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 46Rubenstein N.M. Guan Y. Woo P.L. Firestone G.L. J. Biol.

Indeed, mothers at risk for pre-term delivery are treated with DEX to induce maturation of the lungs of the baby and promote surfactant protein production prior to birth (47Sloboda D.M. Challis J.R. Moss T.J. Newnham J.P. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2005; 11: 1459-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This study focused on the regulation of human fgg gene expression in lung when compared with liver epithelial cells in response to IL-6 and GCs. We found that when compared with the HepG2 liver cell line, lung A549 cells exhibited a 15-fold lower activation of the human γFBG promoter in response to IL-6. Therefore, we tested several possibilities that could account for the cell type-specific differences in fgg gene expression. First, analysis of RT-PCR products obtained prior to the plateau phase of amplification showed that barely detectable levels of Stat3β mRNA were expressed and that the relative abundance of Stat3β to Stat3α mRNA was similar in HepG2 and A549 cells. Second, relative to actin, the expression of endogenous IL-6R and Stat3 protein was much lower in A549 than in HepG2 cells, whereas gp130 expression was similar in both cell types. Third, overexpression of Stat3(WT) in A549 cells failed to restore IL-6-induced γFBG promoter activity, suggesting that low expression of IL-6R contributes to the 15-fold lower activation of the γFBG promoter in A549 cells. The addition of sIL-6R, however, failed to significantly restore IL-6 activation of the γFBG promoter, indicating that low expression of IL-6R was not the sole cause of reduced IL-6-mediated transactivation of the γFBG promoter. Fourth, Western blotting taken together with EMSA showed that rapid and transient kinetics of Stat3 Tyr705 phosphorylation is required for nuclear translocation and binding of activated Stat3 to the α2M IL-6RE. Finally, when overexpression of a chimeric receptor, GCSFR-gp130(133), was used to bypass IL-6R-gp130-coupled signal transduction, γFBG promoter activity was induced only 9-fold. However, in combination with the chimeric receptor, increasing expression of Stat3(WT) restored γFBG promoter activity in A549 cells to match the ∼30-fold activity achieved by IL-6 through the endogenous IL-6R-gp130 signaling pathway in HepG2 cells. There is increasing evidence that demonstrates synergism between IL-6 and GCs in the synthesis of APPs (44Lerner L. Henriksen M.A. Zhang X. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2564-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 48Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Haan S. Hermanns H.M. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2442) Google Scholar). DEX treatment stimulated IL-6R mRNA expression and protein production 2–3-fold in A549 cells, which could account for the similar-fold DEX potentiation of γFBG promoter activity in response to IL-6. Because compensation of low levels of endogenous IL-6R with sIL-6R failed to replicate the DEX effect, DEX-induced expression of IL-6R is not sufficient to explain DEX potentiation of IL-6-induced activation of the γFBG promoter in A549 cells. DEX alone promoted Ser727 phosphorylation of Stat3 in both HepG2 and A549 cells with a conspicuous absence of Tyr705 phosphorylation. These results indicate that GCs stimulate Stat3 serine phosphorylation in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation in an IL-6-independent manner. EMSA revealed that Stat3 phosphorylated at Ser727 but not at Tyr705 was incapable of translocating to the nucleus. However, the combined treatment of IL-6 + DEX led to sustained activation of Stat3 by phosphorylation of both Tyr705 and Ser727; both tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of Stat3 is required for maximum transactivation of target genes (49Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IL-6 + DEX induced phosphorylation of Stat3 at Tyr705 and Ser727 promotes nuclear accumulation of Stat3 as well as biphasic and sustained DNA-protein complex formation. Taken together, these results suggest that DEX induction of the high affinity IL-6R, as well as the elevated and sustained activation and nuclear accumulation of Stat3, accounts for the majority of DEX potentiation of type II IL-6RE-containing target gene expression. In summary, the data reported here suggest that low constitutive expression of IL-6R and/or Stat3 in lung epithelium may be beneficial to lung homeostasis. Indeed, Stat3 activation occurs long before signs of acute lung injury are observed, suggesting that Stat3 plays a role in initiating local inflammatory responses (40Severgnini M. Takahashi S. Rozo L.M. Homer R.J. Kuhn C. Jhung J.W. Perides G. Steer M. Hassoun P.M. Fanburg B.L. Cochran B.H. Simon A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: L1282-L1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the results of this study show that lung alveolar A549 cells are more sensitive to DEX potentiation of IL-6-induced FBG expression when compared with HepG2 cells (0.001 μm when compared with 0.1 μm, respectively); GCs maintain lung epithelial cell tight junctions and cell polarity (45Ward N.S. Waxman A.B. Homer R.J. Mantell L.L. Einarsson O. Du Y. Elias J.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 46Rubenstein N.M. Guan Y. Woo P.L.

In that respiratory epithelium is subjected to daily insults from airborne contaminants, it is likely that IL-6 and GC modulation of Stat3 activation in lung is limited to restrict the intensity of a local (lung epithelial) inflammatory response to IL-6 and GCs while allowing a full-scale systemic (hepatic) response. FBG is secreted basolaterally and incorporated into the alveolar extracellular matrix in response to IL-6 and GCs only when tight junctions are maintained (17Simpson-Haidaris P.J. Courtney M.A. Wright T.W. Goss R. Harmsen A. Gigliotti F. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 4431-4439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Guadiz G. Sporn L.A. Goss R.A. Lawrence S.O. Marder V.J.

Blood. 1997; 90: 2644-2653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that limited activation of Stat3 by IL-6 and GCs and subsequent FBG production contributes to the maintenance of respiratory epithelial barrier integrity and lung homeostasis. Elucidation of the mechanisms regulating FBG expression in lung will enhance our understanding of signaling mechanisms by which acute phase response mediators and APPs function to regulate pulmonary inflammation.

PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim homology domain) proteins are members of the bHLH superfamily of transcription factors for which dimerization is required for DNA binding activity. Dimerization occurs between HLH domains, allowing DNA binding by the adjacent basic sequences. There are three main subgroups of bHLH proteins: those containing only the bHLH domain and those where the bHLH domain is contiguous with either a leucine zipper (LZ) or PAS region, which additionally regulates dimerization (1Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar, 2Taylor B.L. Zhulin I.B. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 479-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PAS region in bHLH·PAS proteins generally consists of two adjacent PAS domains, degenerate repeats of ∼130 amino acids termed PAS A and PAS B. PAS domains are not restricted to bHLH DNA-binding proteins and, like the leucine zipper motif, are a widely observed protein-protein interaction module forming a highly conserved structure (2Taylor B.L. Zhulin I.B. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 479-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Crews S.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 4Crews S.T. Fan C.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar).In common with many dimeric transcription factor families, the three bHLH systems generally combine a specific component with a generic partner protein, such that partner choice determines target gene response and family members can be grouped into two classes based on dimerization behavior (2Taylor B.L. Zhulin I.B. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 479-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kewley R.J. Whitelaw M.L. Chapman-Smith A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 189-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The Class I bHLH·PAS proteins, which include the Dioxin (or Aryl hydrocarbon) Receptor (DR) and the Hypoxia-inducible Factors (HIFαs), neither homodimerize nor heterodimerize with other Class I factors. To form active DNA binding complexes they must dimerize with a Class II bHLH·PAS factor, which promiscuously homo- and heterodimerize. The common obligate Class II dimerization partner for both the DR and HIFα is the ubiquitous Aryl hydrocarbon Nuclear Receptor Translocator (Arnt).Among bHLH·PAS and bHLH·LZ proteins, it is the second dimerization domain, PAS or LZ, that defines partner choice and prevents dimer formation with inappropriate bHLH family members. The isolated bHLH domain of the DR is able to both homodimerize and form heterodimers with the bHLH·LZ protein USF. Addition of the N-terminal region of the adjacent PAS domain restricts dimerization of the DR to the appropriate partner, Arnt (6Pongratz I. Antonsson C. Whitelaw M.L. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4079-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). As well as determining partner specificity, it is clear that the PAS domains also contribute to dimer stability. In the absence of the bHLH domain, the DR/Arnt PAS domain interaction can be detected using a mammalian two-hybrid assay (7Lindebro M.C. Poellinger L. Whitelaw M.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3528-3539Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and deletion of the entire PAS region of Arnt markedly reduces dimerization with the DR (8Reisz-Porszasz S. Probst M.R. Fukunaga B.N. Hankinson O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6075-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). We have shown that the bHLH domain alone is unable to form stable dimers in bacterial expression systems and recovery of functional DR or HIFα protein requires coexpression of the bHLH·PAS A region of each protein with the equivalent region of the Arnt partner protein (9Chapman-Smith A. Lutwyche J.K. Whitelaw M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5353-5362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Full dimerization and DNA binding activity are observed with a truncated DR consisting of only the N-terminal bHLH·PAS A region (10Dolwick K.M. Swanson H.I. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8566-8570Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). A general architecture is apparent across the bHLH·PAS family where the N-terminal bHLH·PAS domains harbor dimerization and DNA binding activities, with C-terminal regions functioning in signaling and transactivation or transrepression (Fig. 1A) (2Taylor B.L. Zhulin I.B. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 479-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kewley R.J. Whitelaw M.L. Chapman-Smith A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 189-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar).In addition to controlling dimerization specificity and contributing to dimerization strength, the PAS domains of the bHLH·PAS proteins have a role in DNA binding that is as yet poorly defined but seems to differ substantially from the simple model proposed for the role of leucine zippers in the related bHLH·LZ proteins. Structural analyses of bHLH and bHLH·LZ proteins demonstrate that the HLH dimer forms a compact four-helical bundle that positions the basic region to interact with the E-box (11Ellenberger T. Fass D. Arnaud M. Harrison S.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 970-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). For bHLH·LZ proteins, the LZ domain forms an α-helix that is continuous with the C-terminal helix of the bHLH domain (Helix2) and that dimerizes with the corresponding region of the partner protein. The LZ enhances DNA binding by extending the dimerization interface in a long rigid α-helical bundle (12Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Prendergast G.C. Ziff E.B. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 363: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 13Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 14Nair S.K. Burley S.K. Cell. 2003; 112: 193-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). This observation explains why chimeric bHLH·LZ proteins in which LZ domains have been interchanged are able to form stable dimers and bind DNA. For example, chimeric proteins with combinations of the bHLH and LZ domains of SREBP, USF, and Max show no reduction in DNA binding, providing that the individual bHLH and LZ domains present in the chimeras are derived from proteins that normally dimerize in native situations (15Rishi V. Gal J. Krylov D. Fridriksson J. Boysen M.S. Mandrup S. Vinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11863-11874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Several lines of evidence suggest that this structural model is not sufficient to explain the molecular interactions necessary for high affinity DNA binding by bHLH·PAS proteins. First, although a dimer comprising only the bHLH regions of DR and Arnt can recognize the Xenobiotic Response Element (XRE) target sequence (6Pongratz I. Antonsson C. Whitelaw M.L. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4079-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), distinct point mutations within either the DR or Arnt PAS regions dramatically attenuate DNA binding, apparently without significantly disrupting dimerization (16Sun W. Zhang J. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31845-31854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 17Numayama-Tsuruta K. Kobayashi A. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 486-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Second, our recent data using purified bacterially expressed proteins demonstrate that strong DNA binding by DR/Arnt and HIF1α/Arnt heterodimers requires the PAS A domains. For DR/Arnt, this effect on DNA binding requires the DR PAS domain, because a chimeric protein containing DR bHLH fused to the PAS A domain of Arnt binds DNA poorly when heterodimerized with Arnt (9Chapman-Smith A. Lutwyche J.K. Whitelaw M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5353-5362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 18Antonsson C. Whitelaw M.L. McGuire J. Gustafsson J.A. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 756-765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data also show increased protease susceptibility in the bHLH·PAS chimeric protein relative to the native protein, suggesting a destabilized structure. These observations are in contrast with the behavior of analogous bHLH·LZ chimeric proteins (15Rishi V. Gal J. Krylov D. Fridriksson J. Boysen M.S. Mandrup S. Vinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11863-11874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and suggest that, unlike the LZ, the contribution of the PAS domain in DNA binding is not simply a consequence of protein dimerization strength. Third, although DR and HIF, which bind atypical E-boxes (the XRE (TNGCGTG) and Hypoxic Response Element (TACGTG), respectively) (4Crews S.T. Fan C.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 5Kewley R.J. Whitelaw M.L. Chapman-Smith A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 189-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), require the PAS A domain for high affinity DNA binding, the Arnt homodimer, which binds the canonical E-box (CACGTG), does not. The PAS domains of Arnt have no effect on DNA binding by Arnt homodimers but are, however, necessary for forming stable homodimers (9Chapman-Smith A. Lutwyche J.K. Whitelaw M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5353-5362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Taken together, these observations imply a critical influence of the PAS domains on DNA binding for Class I bHLH·PAS proteins and led us to consider the possibility that there may be interactions between the bHLH and PAS regions that contribute to effective dimerization and strong DNA binding. Here, we have presented evidence for the existence of a direct interaction between the bHLH and PAS domains of the DR, as well as a direct effect of the PAS A domains of the DR/Arnt heterodimer on the interaction with target DNA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—Expression plasmids were constructed by standard methods and verified by sequencing. All proteins containing the DR bHLH were expressed from pET32a (Novagen) and those with Arnt bHLH from derivatives of pAC28 (19Kholod N. Mustelin T. BioTechniques. 2001; 31 (326-328): 322-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) that had been constructed to produce proteins with an N-terminal TrxH6 described previously (9Chapman-Smith A. Lutwyche J.K. Whitelaw M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5353-5362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Fusions to the LZ region of Myc and Max were constructed by overlap extension PCR using the plasmid pET3d-mycmax (20Fieber W. Schneider M.L. Matt T. Krautler B. Konrat R. Bister K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1395-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) as template for the LZ coding sequences.Protein Techniques—Protein expression, purification, quantitation, and DNA binding analysis using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were carried out as described previously (9Chapman-Smith A. Lutwyche J.K. Whitelaw M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5353-5362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To analyze the stability of protein-DNA complexes, binding reactions contained 1 nm labeled XRE DNA and protein concentrations between 10 nm and 200 nm, such that a similar proportion of labeled DNA was bound by protein initially for all samples. After equilibration for 30 min at 4 °C, 260 nm unlabeled XRE DNA was added to the reaction (t 0) and dissociation of protein-DNA complexes over time analyzed by EMSA. Antibodies used were a rabbit polyclonal antiserum against the N terminus of Arnt (21Mason G. Witte A. Whitelaw M. Antonsson C. McGuire J. Wilhelmsson A. Poellinger L. Gustafsson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4438-4449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mouse monoclonals RPT1 and RPT9, purchased from Affinity BioReagents.Bacterial Two-hybrid Reporter Gene Assays—Assays were carried out using the BacterioMatch II system (Stratagene). Sequences encoding the bHLH domains of DR (residues 1-83) or Arnt-(1-142), the PAS A domains of DR-(84-287), Arnt-(143-362), or HIF1α-(74-241), as well as the entire DR or Arnt bHLH·PAS A regions (DR-(1-287), Arnt-(1-362)) were cloned into the bacterial expression plasmids pBT and pTRG to create in-frame fusions to λ-phage C1 repressor (λC1) and the α-subunit of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase, respectively. The resultant plasmids were transformed pairwise into the supplied reporter strain containing a HIS3-aadA reporter cassette, following the protocol recommended by Stratagene. After adaption to histidine-lacking minimal medium (His-), one half of the transformed pool was plated onto His antibiotic plates to select for successfully cotransformed bacteria. This allowed assessment of the transformation efficiency for the different plasmids, which was similar for all plasmid pairs. The remaining transformants were grown at 30 °C in His- liquid culture with antibiotic selection for 24-48 h, after which the selected bacteria were subcultured in His- medium with antibiotic selection in either the absence or presence of 1.8 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3AT). Growth at 30 °C was followed using A600 nm over 8-24 h. All cultures grew in the absence of 3AT, due to basal transcription of the HIS3 gene, although the rates varied somewhat between cultures and between experiments. Growth in the presence of 3AT provided a measure of reporter gene activation resulting from protein-protein interaction.DNase I Footprinting—DNA fragments for footprinting were prepared by PCR with the mouse cytochrome P450 1A1 (cyp1A1) promoter as template and one of the oligonucleotide primers labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein at the 5′-end (GeneWorks, Adelaide, SA, Australia). This produced DNA probes of 212 base pairs labeled on either the sense or antisense strand, which were confirmed by sequencing. Footprinting reactions were carried out essentially as described by Yindeeyoungyeon and Schell (22Yindeeyoungyeon W. Schell M.A. BioTechniques. 2000; 29: 1032-1041Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and the denatured DNA fragments were mixed with molecular weight standards and separated on an ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer.RESULTSThe Functional Extent of the DR PAS A Domain—Initially we wanted to more precisely delineate the sequences within the DR PAS region required for stable interaction with Arnt and strong DNA binding. To do this we constructed a series of DR-Arnt chimeric proteins encompassing the N-terminal bHLH·PAS A region, with fusion points progressively more C-terminal to the bHLH domain (Fig. 1). The fusion points were designed around the proposed structural elements within the region, using the PAS domain structure-based alignments of Pellequer et al. (23Pellequer J.L. Wager-Smith K.A. Kay S.A. Getzoff E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5884-5890Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and Taylor and Zhulin (2Taylor B.L. Zhulin I.B. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 479-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The minimal PAS domain structure consists of a 5-stranded β-sheet with a central α-helical PAS core region and a helical connector spanning the two halves of the β-scaffold (4Crews S.T. Fan C.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). This putative minimal domain (residues 122-226 of DR and 175-279 of Arnt) was not interrupted in our fusion proteins. We sought to determine the importance of the sequences between Helix2 and PAS A (CH0 and CH1) and between the minimal PAS A and B domains. Some PAS domains include an additional N-terminal α-helical cap structure (24Borgstahl G.E. Williams D.R. Getzoff E.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6278-6287Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Although sequence conservation between different PAS domains within this region is low, the PAS B cap structure is predicted to encompass residues 311-361 of Arnt and residues ∼235-282 of DR (23Pellequer J.L. Wager-Smith K.A. Kay S.A. Getzoff E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5884-5890Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Because residues 230-287 of DR have been shown to contribute to the interaction with Arnt (7Lindebro M.C. Poellinger L. Whitelaw M.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3528-3539Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 25McGuire J. Okamoto K. Whitelaw M.L. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41841-41849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we looked at the effect of substituting this proposed structural element of DR with that of Arnt (CH2 and CH3). The two mutations identified in cell lines derived from mouse hepatoma Hepa-1c1c7 cells, G341D in Arnt and C216W in DR, which result in proteins that are unable to bind the XRE in response to DR ligand (16Sun W. Zhang J. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31845-31854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 17Numayama-Tsuruta K. Kobayashi A. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 486-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), were constructed in bacterial expression vectors. In addition, to see whether the observed effect of the DR PAS domain on DNA binding was specific to the DR or a general property of Class I/II PAS heterodimers, the sequence in DR between Helix2 and PAS B was replaced with the same region of HIF1α (DR·HIFch).The chimeric and mutant DR proteins all contained an N-terminal thioredoxin 6-histidine tag (TrxH6) and were coexpressed in E. coli with TrxH6 Arnt bHLH·PAS A constructs. Similarly, the Arnt bHLH·PAS A construct containing the G341D substitution was coexpressed with wild-type DR bHLH·PAS A. The proteins were purified from bacterial extracts by nickel affinity chromatography and analyzed for XRE DNA binding activity (Fig. 2A). For the samples where we could recover functional protein after further purification by size exclusion chromatography, DNA binding was analyzed quantitatively over a concentration range (Fig. 2B). The effect of dilution during this chromatography step also allowed us to make a qualitative assessment of dimerization strength.FIGURE 2DNA binding by chimeric and mutant bHLH·PAS proteins. A, DR·Arnt chimeric proteins coexpressed with Arnt, or mutant Arnt (*) or DR (o) proteins coexpressed with wild-type partner protein (illustrated in Fig. 1), were purified by nickel affinity chromatography and tested for binding to XRE DNA in EMSAs. The amount of protein (ng) in each lane refers to the limiting component. B, DR·Arnt CH0, DR·Arnt CH1, and DR·HIF chimeric protein preparations were further purified to near homogeneity by size exclusion chromatography and analyzed for XRE DNA binding activity in EMSAs. The graph shows the fraction of bound DNA as a function of protein dimer concentration. C, mutant (G341D) or wild-type Arnt protein, expressed in bacteria and purified by nickel affinity and size exclusion chromatography, was analyzed over a concentration range for E-box DNA binding activity in EMSAs (left panel) and the data plotted to show the fraction of bound DNA as a function of protein dimer concentration (right panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As we have noted previously, standard assays for dimerization cannot be applied to the proteins used in this work (9Chapman-Smith A. Lutwyche J.K. Whitelaw M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5353-5362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For our native (truncated) proteins, partner proteins must be coexpressed to recover material having good DNA binding activity. In addition, the native proteins tend to aggregate at concentrations in the high nm range, which precludes analysis of dimerization using techniques such as equilibrium sedimentation and circular dichroism. However, the effect of dilution during size exclusion chromatography on preformed protein dimers has given us a useful method of assessing dimerization, at least comparatively, to investigate aspects of the structure/function relationships in DR and Arnt that would otherwise not be possible.As seen previously (9Chapman-Smith A. Lutwyche J.K. Whitelaw M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5353-5362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), CH0 showed markedly reduced DNA binding, with CH1 having very similar properties to CH0 in both DNA binding (Fig. 2, A and B) and dimerization with Arnt (data not shown). Because the behavior of the proteins was the same whether the sequence between Helix2 and PAS A corresponded to DR or Arnt, we have concluded that this region of DR does not contribute specifically to dimerization and DNA binding. CH2 and CH3 proteins were expressed at only low levels and, when copurified with Arnt, bound DNA with greatly reduced affinity (Fig. 2A). The proteins could not be purified by size exclusion chromatography. These observations are consistent with them being poorly structured proteins having dramatically reduced dimerization with Arnt. As expected, DR/Arnt heterodimers containing either the DR C216W or Arnt G341D mutant proteins also showed reduced DNA binding (Fig. 2A). In addition, both mutations appeared to disrupt the structure of the proteins. Expression levels were lower than for wild-type counterparts, and the resultant heterodimers were unstable, prone to aggregation as well as dissociating and losing DNA binding activity on dilution during size exclusion chromatography (data not shown). Taken together, the behavior of CH2, CH3, and the mutant heterodimers indicates that sequences between the homology-defined C terminus of the PAS A domain and the N terminus of the PAS B domain (DR residues 235-282; Arnt residues 279-362) are required in both DR and Arnt to form well structured proteins that have good dimerization with the partner protein and strong XRE DNA binding.The alignments we used to define the PAS domain boundaries in designing CH2 and CH3 were based on structures of proteins functionally unrelated to DR and Arnt, where the PAS domain is a signaling module (2Taylor B.L. Zhulin I.B. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 479-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Crews S.T. Fan C.M. Curr. Opin. Genet.

A. 1998; 95: 5884-5890Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). While this work was in progress, the crystal structure of the PAS repeat region (PAS A+B) from the Drosophila Period (Per) protein was determined (26Yildiz O. Doi M. Yujnovsky I. Cardone L. Berndt A. Hennig S. Schulze S. Urbanke C. Sassone-Corsi P. Wolf E. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 69-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Per lacks a bHLH domain and functions as a negative regulator of DNA binding by dimerizing with bHLH·PAS circadian clock proteins. This is the first structure of a PAS A domain closely related to the bHLH·PAS proteins that are the subject of the present work. The new alignments of DR and Arnt based on the Per PAS A structure (26Yildiz O. Doi M. Yujnovsky I. Cardone L. Berndt A. Hennig S. Schulze S. Urbanke C. Sassone-Corsi P. Wolf E. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 69-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) differ from the previous alignments, particularly in the sequences DR-(230-280) and Arnt-(280-360). They suggest that the C-terminal boundary of the structured PAS A domain in DR and Arnt lies much closer to the start of PAS B than previously supposed and that the sequences exchanged in our chimeras, CH2 and CH3, contribute to the hydrophobic core of these domains, as well as contain previously unidentified extended loop regions. This prediction is consistent with the behavior of the DR·Arnt chimeras CH2 and CH3, because exchanging these sequences in DR with the corresponding region of Arnt gave rise to non-functional proteins. We have concluded that, as predicted from the Per PAS structure (26Yildiz O. Doi M. Yujnovsky I. Cardone L. Berndt A. Hennig S. Schulze S. Urbanke C. Sassone-Corsi P. Wolf E. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 69-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the DR minimal PAS A region in fact extends to the start of the PAS B domain.Binding to XRE DNA by the DR·HIF chimeric protein was comparable with that of the equivalent DR·Arnt chimera (CH0) when paired with Arnt (Fig. 2B), confirming that the high affinity XRE DNA binding conferred by PAS A is specific to DR PAS. When Arnt G341D was purified alone to enable recovery of the mutant homodimer, although yields were reduced and the protein showed a marked tendency to aggregate we were able to recover homodimer that bound E-box DNA with similar affinity to wild-type Arnt (Fig. 2C). This observation is consistent with our previous work showing that Arnt PAS domain does not contribute to DNA binding by the homodimer (9Chapman-Smith A. Lutwyche J.K. Whitelaw M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5353-5362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).The Entire DR bHLH·PAS A Region Is Necessary for Dimerization with Arnt—The simplest model for bHLH·PAS dimerization, which is implicit in much of the literature to date, is that the bHLH and PAS domains form independent modules that interact solely and specifically with their counterparts in the partner protein, essentially analogous to dimerization between bHLH·LZ proteins. If this model holds true, we would predict that the chimeric protein containing the DR bHLH and Arnt PAS domains (Fig. 1A, CH0) should form stable dimers with Arnt bHLH·PAS, as would a heterodimer consisting of the DR and Arnt bHLH and PAS domains in a trans arrangement (DR/Arnt PAS swap dimer, illustrated schematically in Fig. 1B). Such dimers would be predic"

To determine whether syntaxin with arginine instead of glutamine in its zero layer can support SNARE function in vivo, we introduced it as a transgene into a Caenorhabditis elegans syntaxin-null strain. Mutant syntaxin rescued viability and locomotory defects similarly to wild-type syntaxin, demonstrating that SNARE complexes with two glutamines and two arginines in the zero layer can support neurotransmission.

Intracellular membrane trafficking depends on the ordered formation and consumption of transport intermediates and requires that membranes fuse with each other in a tightly regulated and highly specific manner.

SNAREs assemble into coiled coil-like complexes that are thought to pull membranes together and thereby promote fusion (1Hanson P.I. Heuser J.E. Jahn R. Curr. Opin.

Proteins responsible for disassembly are the AAA+ (ATPase associated with a variety of cellular activities) protein NSF and its adaptor protein α-SNAP (5Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W.

Because of the critical role that SNARE complexes play in membrane fusion, understanding how their assembly and disassembly are controlled is critical to describing how cellular membrane trafficking is regulated. SNAREs are defined by the presence of one or more copies of a conserved 60-70-amino acid “SNARE motif” (3Jahn R. Lang T. Sudhof T.C.

Biol. 2002; 9: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The core consists of 16 layers of interacting residues. At the midpoint is a unique layer containing polar rather than hydrophobic residues, typically one arginine and three glutamines. This layer is referred to as the zero layer. Its residues are hydrogen-bonded to each other and sequestered from solvent by hydrophobic layers on either side. The zero layer is the most distinctive feature common to all SNARE complexes and has therefore attracted much attention. It provides the basis for naming the four groups of SNARE motifs as QA-, QB-, QC-, and R-SNAREs to reflect both the residue that each SNARE contributes to the zero layer and the position that it occupies in an assembled complex (8Fasshauer D. Sutton R.B. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15781-15786Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 9Bock J.B. Matern H.T. Peden A.A. Scheller R.H.

The founding members of each of these groups are the SNAREs of the synaptic SNARE complex, with syntaxin-1 providing the QA helix; the N- and C-terminal ends of SNAP-25 providing the QB and QC helices, respectively; and synaptobrevin (vesicle-associated membrane protein) providing the R helix. Various ideas for how polar zero layer residues might impact SNARE function have been put forward. One attractive possibility is that favorable interactions among the polar residues within the layer ensure that SNARE motifs assemble in register with respect to each other and the membranes in which they are anchored (11Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar, 14Ernst J.A. Brunger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8630-8636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The zero layer may also help to specify the oligomeric state of the complex. It could provide a “half-way” point during complex assembly, separating formation of “trans-SNARE complexes” between membranes into two phases (15Xu T. Rammner B. Margittai M. Artalejo A.R. Neher E. Jahn R. Cell. 1999; 99: 713-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Finally, the zero layer might serve as a starting point for NSF/α-SNAP-driven complex disassembly (11Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar, 14Ernst J.A. Brunger A.T. J. Biol.

A. 2001; 98: 14262-14267Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Whether one or several of these explain the high degree of conservation of the layer remains unknown. A number of mutagenesis studies have investigated how manipulating zero layer residues affects SNARE-dependent processes in vivo using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system (17Ossig R.

Chem. 2001; 276: 34537-34544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A general conclusion from these experiments is that trying to accommodate a second arginine in the zero layer perturbs SNARE complex function, whereas eliminating all arginines is less disruptive. The disruption caused by a second arginine can be overcome by changing the original arginine to glutamine (17Ossig R. Schmitt H.D. de Groot B. Riedel D. Keranen S. Ronne H. Grubmuller H. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6000-6010Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 18Katz L. Hanson P.I. Heuser J.E. Brennwald P.

This demonstrates that the number (one versus two) rather than the absolute position of the arginine is what matters for complex function. Whether the overall presence of a polar zero layer is functionally important has not been examined in vivo because all mutant complexes studied to date in yeast retain at least a partially polar zero layer. Contributions of individual core residues, including those of the zero layer, to the function of the synaptic SNARE complex have been extensively examined using in vitro assays of PC12 cell secretory granule exocytosis (22Chen Y.A.

For in vitro exocytosis studies, analysis has been limited to changes in the SNAP-25 QB and QC helices because these do not need to be anchored to the membrane to function. Not surprisingly, mutations of hydrophobic core residues in either the QB or QC helix disrupt the apparent stability of the SNARE complex as well as its ability to promote exocytosis (22Chen Y.A.

When examined in living preparations, mutations of hydrophobic layer residues in syntaxin or synaptobrevin have been similarly disruptive (25Saifee O. Wei L.P. Nonet M.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1235-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 26Nonet M.L. Saifee O. Zhao H. Rand J.B. Wei L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 70-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Fergestad T. Wu M.N. Schulze K.L. Lloyd T.E. Bellen H.J. Broadie K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9142-9150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Somewhat surprisingly, changes in the residue(s) that SNAP-25 brings to the zero layer have relatively minor effects on in vitro secretory granule exocytosis, particularly when compared with the effects of mutations in adjacent hydrophobic layers that have similar effects on apparent complex stability (22Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Patel S.M. Doung Y.C. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 23Scales S.J. Chen Y.A. Yoo B.Y. Patel S.M. Doung Y.C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 26680-26687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). SNAP-25 zero layer mutants introduced into living cells again have little or no effect on fusion per se (28Graham M.E. Washbourne P. Wilson M.C. Burgoyne R.D. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4397-4405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Wei S. Xu T. Ashery U. Kollewe A. Matti U. Antonin W. Rettig J. Neher E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1279-1289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although expressing SNAP-25 with both its glutamines changed to leucine slows the kinetics of vesicle pool refilling in adrenal chromaffin cells (29Wei S. Xu T. Ashery U. Kollewe A. Matti U. Antonin W. Rettig J. Neher E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1279-1289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the minimal effects of synaptic SNARE complex zero layer mutations on secretory granule exocytosis, Scheller and co-workers (16Scales S.J. Yoo B.Y. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14262-14267Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) investigated whether these changes might instead affect a SNARE reaction not directly involved in fusion such as NSF-mediated complex disassembly. They found that disassembly appeared to be inhibited by some zero layer mutations, with the most dramatic effects seen when the QA (syntaxin) zero layer glutamine was changed to any other amino acid (16Scales S.J. Yoo B.Y. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14262-14267Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Neher and co-workers (29Wei S. Xu T. Ashery U. Kollewe A. Matti U. Antonin W. Rettig J. Neher E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1279-1289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) considered slowing of disassembly as a possible explanation for the delay in pool replenishment caused by expressing the SNAP-25 zero layer leucine mutant in adrenal chromaffin cells, but dismissed it based on unpublished data showing that a SNARE complex with four leucines in its zero layer was disassembled in vitro as fast or faster than the wild-type complex. Disassembly of SNARE complexes in yeast expressing zero layer mutants has not been directly examined, but the range of phenotypes observed (17Ossig R. Schmitt H.D. de Groot B. Riedel D. Keranen S. Ronne H. Grubmuller H. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6000-6010Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 18Katz L. Hanson P.I. Heuser J.E. Brennwald P.

Chem. 2001; 276: 34537-34544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and, in particular, the ability to restore function by rotating the arginine within the layer indicate that a general requirement for a QA glutamine in disassembly is unlikely. To understand more specifically how NSF disassembles SNARE complexes, we were interested in further exploring the proposed role of the zero layer in disassembly of the synaptic SNARE complex. Here, we revisited the question of how manipulating the zero layer affects complex disassembly in vitro and also investigated how a zero layer mutation in syntaxin affects the normal function of this QA-SNARE in vivo in Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that changes in the zero layer, either single replacement of the syntaxin glutamine with arginine or multiple replacement of all four layer residues with non-polar amino acids, did not significantly affect NSF-mediated disassembly in vitro. Furthermore, replacing the syntaxin glutamine with arginine did not impair syntaxin function in C. elegans. This suggests that, at least in the case of the synaptic SNARE complex, there is no special role for polar zero layer residues and, in particular, for the syntaxin glutamine in NSF-mediated disassembly. Our results confirm that the function of the synaptic SNARE complex is remarkably tolerant to changes in its zero layer and open the way to further studies aimed at defining the contribution of this layer to the normal functioning of SNARE complexes. Protein Expression Vectors—pET28-CFP and pET28-YFP vectors were created by moving enhanced CFP or YFP (Invitrogen) from pECFP-N1 or pEYFP-N1, respectively, as a BamHI-NotI fragment into pET28a. His6-syntaxin-CFP was created by introducing residues 1-265 of rat syntaxin-1a as a NdeI-AgeI fragment into pET28a-CFP. The resulting construct contains a His6 tag, syntaxin-1a, and CFP with residues VPVAT between syntaxin and CFP. The syntaxin also contains a C145S mutation. His6-synaptobrevin-YFP was similarly constructed by introducing residues 1-96 of rat synaptobrevin II into the NdeI-BamHI fragment of pET28a-YFP with residues VDPPVAT between synaptobrevin and YFP. All fragments were generated by PCR using oligonucleotide primers containing the indicated restriction sites. The sequences of all constructs were confirmed by ABI PRISM BigDye terminator cycle sequencing (Applied Biosystems) at the Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratory of the Washington University School of Medicine. SNAP-25b in pHO4d, syntaxin-(1-265) in pHO4d, and synaptobrevin-(1-96) in pET15b were as described previously (10Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Mutations in the SNARE zero layers (syntaxin(Q226R), syntaxin(Q226L), SNAP-25(Q53A/Q174L), synaptobrevin(R56Q), and synaptobrevin(R56A)) were introduced by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) into the indicated plasmids. For expression in C. elegans, a Q227R mutation was similarly introduced into pTX12, an unc-64 syntaxin minigene expressed under the control of the unc-64 promoter (25Saifee O. Wei L.P. Nonet M.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1235-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). An expression vector for NSF was created by amplifying full-length Chinese hamster NSF from pQE9-NSF (5Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar) and inserting it as a BamHI-XhoI fragment into pET28a. The resulting protein has N-terminal His6 and T7 tags. Bovine α-SNAP in pET28a was as described (30Marz K.E. Lauer J.M. Hanson P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27000-27008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Protein Purification and Complex Preparation—Proteins were purified essentially as described (10Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 30Marz K.E. Lauer J.M. Hanson P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27000-27008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). NSF, syntaxin, SNAP-25, and synaptobrevin were quantified using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. α-SNAP was quantified by measuring absorbance at 280 nm using ϵ = 40,200 (30Marz K.E. Lauer J.M. Hanson P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27000-27008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). All proteins and complexes were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. A SNARE complex was assembled by combining syntaxin-CFP, SNAP-25, and synaptobrevin-YFP (8-10 μm final concentration of each); dialyzing overnight into 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol; and then separating the mixture on a Mono Q anion exchange column. Fractions containing the highest concentrations of SDS-resistant complex relative to unincorporated individual proteins were pooled, aliquoted, and stored as described above. At least three independent preparations of each complex were purified and studied. Quick-freeze Deep-etch Electron Microscopy—SNARE complexes adsorbed to mica chips were replicated and viewed by transmission electron microscopy as described previously (10Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Temperature-dependent Dissociation in SDS—The SNARE complex (30 μg) was brought to a final volume of 150 μlin1× Laemmli buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue). Aliquots (15 μl) were incubated at the indicated temperatures for 5 min, returned to room temperature, and loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins in the gel were stained with SYPRO Red and visualized and quantified using a STORM 860 imaging system (30Marz K.E. Lauer J.M. Hanson P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27000-27008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). SNARE Complex Disassembly Reactions—Disassembly reactions were performed in 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 100 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin supplemented where indicated with an ATP-regenerating system of 1 mm creatine phosphate and 20 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase. Bovine serum albumin was omitted from disassembly reactions analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Unless indicated otherwise, all reactions were performed at 30 °C. For FRET analysis, disassembly reactions were carried out in a final volume of 500 μl. Buffer, SNARE complex (100 nm unless indicated otherwise), and α-SNAP (2 μm or as indicated) were premixed and transferred into a 10 × 2-mm quartz cuvette. An initial emission scan was acquired (λex = 434 nm and λem = 450-600 nm with slits at 3 nm and measurements every 1 nm), followed by two kinetic scans (λex = 434 nm and λem = 473 and 523 nm in separate photomultiplier tubes). The first scan was used to confirm a stable fluorescence base line. In the second scan, NSF6 (1-10 nm or 0.25-2.5 μg) was added after 60 s, and the reaction was followed for another 500 s. Fluorescence measurements were performed using a Spex FluoroLog-3 operating in T-format. For monitoring disassembly of SDS-resistant complexes by gel electrophoresis, α-SNAP was premixed with the SNARE complex (100-800 nm, 150-μl reaction volume) prior to initiating disassembly with NSF. Aliquots were removed at the indicated times and quenched by addition of 5 mm EDTA and Laemmli buffer. Samples were immediately separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Protein was visualized and quantified by staining with SYPRO Red as described above. Data Analysis—All scans were corrected for buffer background. Apparent FRET efficiency was calculated from corrected CFP emission (477 nm) as 1-(FDA/FD), where FDA is the measured CFP fluorescence of the complex at a given time and FD is the CFP fluorescence of the fully disassembled complex. The FRET signal measured for each complex was taken to represent 100% assembled complex, whereas that for the fully disassembled complex was set to 0%. The initial rate of complex disassembly was calculated from the slope of a line fit to the first 20 s of data collected after addition of NSF (data rejected if the line had R2 < 0.98), taking into account the amount of SNARE complex (in pmol) and NSF (in μg) in the reaction. Rate data for disassembly at different α-SNAP concentrations (see Fig. 6) were fit directly to a modified Hill equation: v = (Vmax(app) × [α-SNAP]h)/(K0.5 + [α-SNAP]h), assuming equivalent binding sites for α-SNAP on the SNARE complex. Curve fitting and plotting were carried out using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) and GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Growth and Culture of C. elegans—C. elegans was grown at 22.5 °C on solid medium as described (31Sulston J. Hodgkin J. Wood W.B. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 587-606Google Scholar). Aldicarb (2-methyl-2-(methylthio)proprionaldehyde O-(methylcarbamoyl)oxime) was obtained from Chem Services, Inc. (West Chester, PA). The strains used in this study were wild-type N2, NM2707 (unc-64(js115), jsEx823 (pTX12(Q227R), pPD118.33)), NM2708 (unc-65(js115), jsEx822 (pTX12, pPD118.33)), NM2709 (unc-64(js115), jsEx824 (pTX12(Q227R), pPD118.33)), NM2710 (unc-64(js115), jsEx825 (pTX12(Q227R), pPD118.33)), NM204 (snt-1(md290)), NM467 (snb-1(md247)), NM464 (unc-64(md130)), NM979 (unc-64(js115)/bli-5(e518)), and NM318 (unc-64(e246)). Construction of Syntaxin(Q227R) Transgenic Strains—C. elegans strains were transformed using a standard microinjection protocol (32Mello C. Fire A. Epstein H.F. Shakes D.C. Methods in Cell Biology: Caenorhabditis elegans: Modern Analysis of an Organism. 48. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1995: 451-482Google Scholar). Plasmid pPD118.33 (a gift of Andy Fire) expressing green fluorescent protein in the pharynx under the control of the myo-2 promoter was used as a cotransformation marker. Transgenic strains containing unc-64(js115) in the homozygous state were created by injecting unc-64(js115)/bli-5(e518) heterozygotes and screened for fluorescent transgenic animals that failed to segregate the bli-5 chromosome. Progeny of the resulting animals consisted only of green fluorescent protein-positive viable animals and green fluorescent protein-negative Unc-64 L1-arrested paralyzed animals. Three independent lines were analyzed for each transgene. Immunoblotting—C. elegans lysates were created as described previously (33Weimer R.M. Richmond J.E. Davis W.S. Hadwiger G. Nonet M.L. Jorgensen E.M. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Blots were blocked for 1 h, incubated overnight with primary antibody at 4 °C, and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence and a STORM 860 imaging system.

https://openalex.org/W2017608841,"MARCO is a class A scavenger receptor capable of binding both Gram-negative and -positive bacteria. Using the surface plasmon resonance technique, we show here that a recombinant, soluble form of MARCO, sMARCO, binds the major Gram-negative and -positive bacterial surface components, lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid. Yet, the interaction of these two polyanions with sMARCO is of much lower affinity than that of polyinosinic acid, a polyanionic inhibitor of bacterial binding to MARCO. To further elucidate the ligand-binding functions of MARCO, we performed a phage display screen with sMARCO. The screening resulted in the enrichment of only a handful of phage clones. Contrary to expectations, no polyanionic peptides, but only those with a predominantly hydrophobic nature, were enriched. One peptide, VRWGSFAAWL, was displayed on two-thirds of the phages recovered after four rounds of screening. The VRWGSFAAWL phage-sMARCO interaction had significantly slower dissociation kinetics than that between sMARCO and lipopolysaccharide or lipoteichoic acid. Further work with this phage, and the second most enriched phage, displaying the peptide RLNWAWWLSY, demonstrated that both peptides bind to the SRCR domain of MARCO, and that they probably bind to the same site. Data base searches suggested that the VRWGSFAAWL peptide represents complement component C4, but we could not convincingly confirm this suggestion. A study with chimeric scavenger receptors indicated that even minor sequence changes in the MARCO scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domain can have profound effects on the binding of the prototypic scavenger receptor ligand, acetylated low density lipoprotein. As shown by differential binding of glutathione S-transferase-VR-WGSFAAWL, these differences were very likely due to conformational changes. These findings led to experiments that demonstrated a crucial role of the SRCR domain for acetylated low density lipoprotein binding in MARCO. Thus, our results strengthen the notion that the SRCR domain is the major ligand-binding domain in MARCO. Furthermore, they suggest that the domain may contain multiple ligand-binding sites. MARCO is a class A scavenger receptor capable of binding both Gram-negative and -positive bacteria. Using the surface plasmon resonance technique, we show here that a recombinant, soluble form of MARCO, sMARCO, binds the major Gram-negative and -positive bacterial surface components, lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid. Yet, the interaction of these two polyanions with sMARCO is of much lower affinity than that of polyinosinic acid, a polyanionic inhibitor of bacterial binding to MARCO. To further elucidate the ligand-binding functions of MARCO, we performed a phage display screen with sMARCO. The screening resulted in the enrichment of only a handful of phage clones. Contrary to expectations, no polyanionic peptides, but only those with a predominantly hydrophobic nature, were enriched. One peptide, VRWGSFAAWL, was displayed on two-thirds of the phages recovered after four rounds of screening. The VRWGSFAAWL phage-sMARCO interaction had significantly slower dissociation kinetics than that between sMARCO and lipopolysaccharide or lipoteichoic acid. Further work with this phage, and the second most enriched phage, displaying the peptide RLNWAWWLSY, demonstrated that both peptides bind to the SRCR domain of MARCO, and that they probably bind to the same site. Data base searches suggested that the VRWGSFAAWL peptide represents complement component C4, but we could not convincingly confirm this suggestion. A study with chimeric scavenger receptors indicated that even minor sequence changes in the MARCO scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domain can have profound effects on the binding of the prototypic scavenger receptor ligand, acetylated low density lipoprotein. As shown by differential binding of glutathione S-transferase-VR-WGSFAAWL, these differences were very likely due to conformational changes. These findings led to experiments that demonstrated a crucial role of the SRCR domain for acetylated low density lipoprotein binding in MARCO. Thus, our results strengthen the notion that the SRCR domain is the major ligand-binding domain in MARCO. Furthermore, they suggest that the domain may contain multiple ligand-binding sites. MARCO, a close relative of scavenger receptor A (see Ref. 1Peiser L. Mukhopadhyay S. Gordon S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), is a trimeric type II transmembrane protein with an N-terminal intracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an extracellular portion composed of a short spacer domain, a long triple-helical collagenous domain, and a C-terminal scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) 3The abbreviations used are: SRCR, scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain; AcLDL, acetylated low density lipoprotein; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; LTA, lipoteichoic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; poly(I), polyinosinic acid; recV, recombinant domain V; sMARCO, recombinant soluble MARCO; RU, resonance unit; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. 3The abbreviations used are: SRCR, scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain; AcLDL, acetylated low density lipoprotein; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; LTA, lipoteichoic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; poly(I), polyinosinic acid; recV, recombinant domain V; sMARCO, recombinant soluble MARCO; RU, resonance unit; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. domain (2Elomaa O.

MARCO has a very restricted expression pattern in adult mice living under pathogen-free conditions. It is expressed at significant levels only in the marginal zone macrophages of the spleen, in macrophages of the medullary cord of lymph nodes, and in the peritoneal macrophages (2Elomaa O. Kangas M.

MARCO also has other than microbial ligands, because it was identified as the main receptor for large environmental particles in the lung alveolar macrophages (7Palecanda A. Paulauskis J. Al-Mutairi E. Imrich A. Qin G. Suzuki H. Kodama T. Tryggvason K. Koziel H. Kobzik L. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1497-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that MARCO has endogenous ligands, too. Indeed, the interaction between MARCO and a cell surface determinant on the marginal zone B cells was found to contribute to the retention of the marginal zone B cells within the marginal zone (8Karlsson M.C. Guinamard R. Bolland S. Sankala M. Steinman R.M. Ravetch J.V. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In another recent study, the uteroglobin-related protein 1, UGRP1, was identified as an endogenous ligand of MARCO in the lung (9Bin L.H. Nielson L.D. Liu X. Mason R.J. Shu H.B. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 924-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Studies with MARCO knock-out mice have demonstrated a role for MARCO in lung defense against pneumococcal pneumonia and inhaled particles (10Arredouani M. Yang Z. Ning Y. Qin G. Soininen R. Tryggvason K. Kobzik L. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). MARCO may also have a role in the macrophage adhesion/spreading processes, because ectopic MARCO expression induces the formation of long dendritic processes (11Pikkarainen T. Brannstrom A. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10975-10982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The SRCR domain is crucial for this activity of MARCO (11Pikkarainen T. Brannstrom A. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10975-10982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Similarly, this domain is the major bacteria-binding domain in MARCO (3Elomaa O. Sankala M. Pikkarainen T. Bergmann U. Tuuttila A. RaatikainenAhokas A. Sariola H. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4530-4538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 12Brannstrom A. Sankala M. Tryggvason K. Pikkarainen T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1462-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We have recently succeeded in establishing a production system for the recombinant soluble MARCO (sMARCO), the extracellular part of this scavenger receptor. The protein was found to have assembled into a collagenous triple-helix, and bind both heat-killed and living Escherichia coli (13Sankala M. Brannstrom A. Schulthess T. Bergmann U. Morgunova E. Engel J. Tryggvason K. Pikkarainen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33378-33385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Furthermore, purified lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a surface component of Gram-negative bacteria, was found to interact with the polyhistidine-tagged sMARCO conjugated to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads, but not with beads containing a polyhistidine-tagged control protein. Here, we have extended our studies on sMARCO, and first examined the interaction of LPS, lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a surface component of Gram-positive bacteria and a putative ligand of MARCO, as well as that of the polyribonucleotide poly(I) with the protein using surface plasmon resonance. We show that all these molecules bind MARCO, but poly(I), an inhibitor of bacterial binding to MARCO, has clearly the highest affinity. We then performed a phage display screen with immobilized sMARCO, as well as AcLDL binding studies with transfected cells, and both studies provide further support for the notion that the SRCR domain has a major role in the ligand-binding function of MARCO. Materials—The rat anti-mouse MARCO monoclonal antibody ED31 was kindly provided by Dr. G. Kraal (Free University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. Polyinosinic acid (poly(I)), LPS (from E. coli serotype 0111:B4), and LTA (from Staphylococcus aureus) were from Sigma. The LPS was phenolextracted and purified by ion-exchange chromatography (L-3024). Construction of the random decapeptide phage library displayed on the minor M13 coat protein P3 has been described (14Koivunen E. Restel B.H. Rajotte D. Lahdenranta J. Hagedorn M. Arap W. Pasqualini R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 129: 3-17PubMed Google Scholar). Human complement components C4 and C4b were from Advanced Research Technologies (>95% pure by SDS-PAGE). Recombinant human C4d of the B isotype corresponding in length to the physiological degradation fragment of C4b was expressed in bacteria, and purified to the end of the DEAE-Sephacel step as described previously (15van den Elsen J.M. Martin A. Wong V. Clemenza L. Rose D.R. Isenman D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 1103-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that the preparation was ∼90% pure. Mouse anti-M13 monoclonal antibody and goat anti-GST polyclonal antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences. Affinity-purified rabbit anti-GST polyclonal antibodies were generated in our laboratory. 5J. Ojala, unpublished data. Rabbit anti-human complement component C4 antibodies were from Sigma, or obtained from Dr. A. Blom (Lund University, Sweden). Secondary antibodies were purchased from Dako or Molecular Probes. Sulfo-NHS-biotin was from Pierce. Acetylated LDL and FITC-labeled E. coli were from Molecular Probes. The synthetic peptide and its keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate were purchased from Anaspec. Surface Plasmon Resonance Experiments—All experiments were run at 25 °C at a flow rate of 5 μl/min in PBS or 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, using a BIAcore 3000 instrument and NTA sensor chips (BIAcore AB). Buffers were degassed and filtered through 0.2-μm cut-off filters. Soluble MARCO was purified as described previously (13Sankala M. Brannstrom A. Schulthess T. Bergmann U. Morgunova E. Engel J. Tryggvason K. Pikkarainen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33378-33385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The NTA sensor chips were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Prior to an experiment, purified sMARCO (ligand) in the eluent buffer (PBS) was coupled to the flow cells at densities ranging from 1000 to 3000 RU. Flow cells without immobilized sMARCO were used as reference cells. Analytes were injected over the flow cell surfaces at the following concentrations: LPS and LTA, 25-100 μg/ml; poly(I) and heparin, 5-15 μg/ml. The LPS and LTA solutions were sonicated 3 times for 15 s before the use. The injection time was 7 min. A fresh ligand was applied to the flow cells before each run. Thus, after a run, the chip was washed with 250 mm EDTA, followed with 100 mm NaOH. Thereafter, the NTA surface was first recharged with nickel ions before applying sMARCO. The control flow cell was not loaded with sMARCO. This reloading procedure was chosen, because we observed that a fraction of sMARCO was stripped away from the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid surface when LPS and LTA were passed over the chip (see “Results”). Data Processing—Prior to analysis, the data were zero-adjusted and the reference cell signal was subtracted. Sensorgrams exhibiting instrumental artifacts were excluded from the analysis. The association and dissociation rate constants (Ka and Kd) were calculated according to the BIAcore evaluation program. The ratio of Kd and Ka yields the value of the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (KD). A simple 1:1 Langmuir model was used to fit the data. The molar concentrations of the injected analytes were calculated using the following molecular weight values: E. coli 0111:B4 LPS, 10,000 (16Aurell C.A. Wistrom A.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar); S. aureus LTA, 7,000 (17Greenberg J.W. Fischer W. Joiner K.A. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3318-3325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); poly(I), 500,000 (manufacturer's information). Selection of sMARCO-binding Phages—Selection of phages binding to sMARCO was done essentially as described by Koivunen et al. (14Koivunen E. Restel B.H. Rajotte D. Lahdenranta J. Hagedorn M. Arap W. Pasqualini R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 129: 3-17PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, sMARCO (100 μg/ml PBS) was first coated onto a Nunc Maxisorp microtiter well overnight at 4 °C. After blocking 1-2 h with 2% BSA/PBS at room temperature, the phage library solution (1 × 109 transducing units in 2% BSA/PBS) was added, and the plate was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The well was washed with PBS containing Tween 20 to remove unbound phages. Bound phages were eluted with a low pH buffer, neutralized, and used to infect competent K91kan E. coli. Three more rounds of panning were carried out in the same manner, except that less sMARCO was coated onto the microtiter plates for rounds three and four (50 and 500 ng/well), and the phage solution was incubated with the immobilized sMARCO for 1 h only. During these rounds, enrichment was verified by comparing the phage binding onto sMARCO- and BSA-coated surfaces. Randomly selected clones were sequenced as described (18Koivunen E. Ranta T.M. Annila A. Taube S. Uppala A. Jokinen M. van Willigen G. Ihanus E. Gahmberg C.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 905-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Binding of individual phages to surfaces coated with sMARCO, recombinant SRCR domain of MARCO, recV (13Sankala M. Brannstrom A. Schulthess T. Bergmann U. Morgunova E. Engel J. Tryggvason K. Pikkarainen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33378-33385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), or recombinant nephrin encompassing the first two IgG domains (rNephrin) was tested in the same manner (1 × 108 transducing units of phages added per well). Proteins were coated at the concentration of 10 μg/ml overnight at 4 °C (100 μl/well). Two wells were coated with each protein. Control wells were coated with a similar concentration of BSA. The assay was repeated three times. Production of the GST-VRWGSFAAWL Peptide Fusion Protein—A construct encoding a GST protein with the VRWGSFAAWL decapeptide extension was generated as follows. A fragment encoding the phage insert was first produced by PCR with the forward and reverse primers containing, respectively, BamHI and EcoRI recognition sites (the forward primer: 5′-AGGCTCGAGGATCCTCGGCCGACGGGGCT-3′, the reverse primer: 5′-AGGTCTAGAATTCGCCCCAGCGGCCCC-3′) using phage DNA as a template. The fragment was gel-purified, digested with BamHI and EcoRI, and cloned into the BamHI-EcoRI-digested pGEX-2TK. The correctness of the construct was verified by DNA sequencing. The GST fusion protein and GST alone were expressed in E. coli BL21 strain. The proteins were produced and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Phage-binding Assays in the Presence of the GST Proteins or the Synthetic VRWGSFAAWL Peptide—Some of the in vitro phage-binding assays were carried out in the presence of 250 μg/ml GST or GST-VRWGSFAAWL. Also, before adding the test solution to wells coated with the different proteins, the wells were preincubated in the blocking solution containing a GST protein for 45 min. Some of the assays were carried out in the presence of the synthetic VRWGS-FAAWL peptide. The peptide was dissolved in Me2SO to obtain a stock solution of 4 mg/ml, and then diluted to the concentration of 200 μg/ml in the blocking solution. A fraction of the peptide precipitated in this solution, and therefore the solution was cleared by centrifugation before applying into the wells. Control binding assays were carried out in the presence of a similar vehicle concentration. Binding Assays with Transfected Cells—CHO cells transfected with the various MARCO expression constructs were tested for the binding of the VRWGSFAAWL phage, the RLNWAWWLSY phage, and a randomly picked control phage. Cells were prepared for the assay as described previously (12Brannstrom A. Sankala M. Tryggvason K. Pikkarainen T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1462-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). At the time of assay, the culture medium was removed, and the cells were first incubated for 10 min in ice-cold DMEM containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 2% BSA (incubation medium). This solution was then removed, and the phage-containing solution was added (1 × 109 transducing units of phage in the ice-cold incubation medium). After 45 min incubation on ice, the cells were washed five times with ice-cold PBS. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized for 5 min with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS, and incubated in PBS containing 2% BSA (blocking solution) before staining for M13 phage and MARCO. All antibodies were diluted in the blocking solution. To detect the M13 phage, the cells were first incubated overnight at 4 °C with a mouse anti-M13 monoclonal antibody (10 μg/ml), then rinsed several times with PBS, and incubated with FITC-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment of goat anti-mouse IgG (10 μg/ml) for 45 min. After rinsing several times in PBS, the cells were fixed again in the paraformaldehyde solution, and stained for MARCO using polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse MARCO antibodies recognizing the intracellular domain of mouse MARCO (2Elomaa O. Kangas M. Sahlberg C. Tuukkanen J. Sormunen R. Liakka A. Thesleff I. Kraal G. Tryggvason K. Cell. 1995; 80: 603-609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). TRITC-conjugated swine antirabbit IgG was used as a secondary antibody. The binding of the GST proteins was tested in the same manner. The cells were incubated on ice with 100 μg/ml of a GST protein in DMEM/Hepes with or without 2% BSA for 45 min. After fixation, the permeabilization step was omitted, and the cells were directly stained for GST using either polyclonal goat or rabbit anti-GST antibodies. The antibodies were used, respectively, at the concentration of 25 and 10 μg/ml blocking solution. FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies were used to detect the bound GST proteins. We did not double stain for GST and MARCO in these assays. It was separately verified that the transfections were successful. In some experiments, we tested the binding of biotinylated GST proteins. The proteins (in PBS) were biotinylated by incubating2honice with sulfo-NHS-biotin (25:1 molar ratio of sulfo-NHS-biotin to protein). Unreacted biotin was then quenched by adding Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, to the final concentration of 20 mm, and the reaction mixtures were extensively dialyzed against PBS at 4 °C. Biotinylation was confirmed by Western blotting with a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. In some assays, the binding of AcLDL and FITC-labeled heat-killed E. coli was tested. Briefly, the cells were first washed once with DMEM, then incubated in DMEM containing either 2.5 μg/ml AcLDL or different concentrations of FITC-labeled E. coli for 1 h in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C, after which the cells were washed two times with DMEM, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and two times with PBS before fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. When testing the binding of human complement proteins C4 and C4b, the proteins (50 μg/ml in DMEM/Hepes) were incubated with the cells on ice for 1 h. Thereafter, the cells were processed as described above, and stained with rabbit anti-human complement C4 antibodies. The binding of biotinylated C4d was tested in a similar manner, except that the bound protein was detected with a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. We used the biotinylated form of C4d, because the anti-C4 antibodies did not recognize this fragment. Biotinylation of C4d was performed as described above. Anti-VRWGSFAAWL Peptide Antibodies—Antibodies were raised against the VRWGSFAAWLC peptide-keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate. A cysteine residue was added to the C terminus of the peptide to facilitate coupling to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Immunoglobulins were purified from the antiserum on a Gamma-bind Sepharose column. Alternatively, anti-peptide antibodies were affinity purified from the antiserum using the GST-VRWGSFAAWL peptide fusion protein coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose (10 mg of the fusion protein conjugated to 2 ml of the beads), or on a peptide affinity matrix (10 mg of the synthetic peptide coupled via its C-terminal cysteine residue to 2 ml of thiopropyl-Sepharose). 5 ml of antiserum, diluted to 25 ml with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl (column buffer), was passed over the columns three to four times. After washing with 20 volumes of the column buffer, and 10 volumes of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.4 m NaCl, the antibodies were eluted with 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.5, 150 mm NaCl. Eluted antibodies were immediately neutralized with 1 m Tris, pH 8.3, and dialyzed against PBS. Characterization of the Binding Properties of sMARCO Using the BIA-core System—We have previously described initial characterization of the binding properties of recombinant sMARCO (13Sankala M. Brannstrom A. Schulthess T. Bergmann U. Morgunova E. Engel J. Tryggvason K. Pikkarainen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33378-33385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although the main aim of this study was to use sMARCO in a phage display screen to identify potential novel ligands for this scavenger receptor, we first wanted to further characterize sMARCO, and studied its binding properties using the BIAcore system. Another motive for setting up this system was that if obtaining enrichment in the phage display screen, the BIAcore system would provide a method for comparing the binding kinetics of the phage-sMARCO interaction to those between sMARCO and its other ligands. Polyhistidine-tagged sMARCO was bound onto NTA chips. Binding to the chip was very stable and there was no detectable dissociation (Fig. 1A). This was probably due to the fact that each sMARCO-molecule contains three polyhistidine tails. Interaction between sMARCO and LPS, LTA, poly(I), or heparin was then examined. Of these polyanionic compounds, LPS, LTA, and poly(I) are ligands of scavenger receptor A (19Hampton R.Y. Golenbock D.T. Penman M. Krieger M. Raetz C.R. Nature. 1991; 352: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 20Ashkenas J. Penman M. Vasile E. Acton S. Freeman M. Krieger M. J.

A. 1994; 91: 1863-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Both LPS and LTA have a tendency to form micelles in an aqueous environment (16Aurell C.A. Wistrom A.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 23Santos N.C. Silva A.C. Castanho M.A. Martins-Silva J. Saldanha C. Chembiochem. 2003; 4: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 24Labischinski H. Naumann D. Fischer W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1269-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As mentioned in the Introduction, we have found previously that sMARCO interacts with LPS in a test tube assay (13Sankala M. Brannstrom A. Schulthess T. Bergmann U. Morgunova E. Engel J. Tryggvason K. Pikkarainen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33378-33385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). MARCO-transfected cells have been shown to bind not only Gram-negative, but also Gram-positive bacteria, suggesting that LTA, the major surface component of this latter class of bacteria, might also be a ligand of MARCO (2Elomaa O. Kangas M. Sahlberg C. Tuukkanen J. Sormunen R. Liakka A. Thesleff I. Kraal G. Tryggvason K. Cell. 1995; 80: 603-609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The polyribonucleotide poly(I) is clearly a ligand of MARCO, because it can be used to block bacterial binding to MARCO-transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, sMARCO binds LPS in the BIAcore system, too, but the binding is followed by rapid dissociation. Curiously, the curve falls below the baseline that might be due to stripping of sMARCO from the NTA surface. A survey of the literature indicates that LPS can interact with nickel (25Wellinghausen N. Schromm A.B. Seydel U. Brandenburg K. Luhm J. Kirchner H. Rink L. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3139-3145PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, if a fraction of NTA-chelated nickel is removed when LPS is passed over the flow cell surface, the amount of bound sMARCO also decreases. Fig. 1C shows that sMARCO binds LTA in a similar manner as it binds LPS. Interestingly, no interaction between immobilized sMARCO and LPS or LTA was detected, if sonicated solutions were left to stand for some hours before the BIAcore assay. Because it is known that sonication causes dispersion of large aggregates into smaller and more uniform micelles (26Risco C. Carrascosa J.L. Bosch M.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1991; 39: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), micelle size appears to be a parameter that affects the interaction of LPS and LTA with sMARCO in this system. Analysis of the binding curves indicated variation in the KD values ranging from the high nanomolar to low micromolar level for both interactions. This variation is very likely due to the two above described potential sources of variability. As shown in Fig. 1D, poly(I) was found to interact with sMARCO with very high affinity. Determination of the binding constants indicated that this polyanionic macromolecule bound immobilized sMARCO with the association(Ka) and dissociation rate(Kd)constants of 4.4 (±2.9) × 105 m-1 s-1 and 1.6 (±0.9) × 10-4 s-1, respectively, yielding a KD value of 4.3 (±3.0) × 10-10 m (n = 4).

https://openalex.org/W2038537435,"Ss-LrpB from the hyperthermoacidophilic crenarchaeote Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 is a member of the Lrp-like family of Bacterial/Archaeal transcription regulators that binds its own control region at three regularly spaced and partially conserved 15-bp-long imperfect palindromes. We have used atomic force microscopy to analyze the architecture of Ss-LrpB·DNA complexes with a different stoichiometry formed with the wild type operator and with an operator mutant. Binding of dimeric Ss-LrpB to all three target sites is accompanied by the formation of globular complexes, in which the protein induces strong DNA deformations. Furthermore, DNA contour length foreshortening of these complexes indicates DNA wrapping, with about 100 bp being condensed. The average bending angle is 260°. The establishment of protein-protein contacts between Ss-LrpB dimers in these globular complexes will contribute to the cooperativity of the binding. The profound remodeling of the control region is expected to have a strong impact on gene expression and might constitute the key element in the autoregulatory process.

Archaeal transcription is a chimera of eukaryotic and bacterial features (for a recent review, see Ref. 1Geiduschek E.P. Ouhammouch M. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1397-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The basal transcription apparatus resembles that of eukaryotes. The archaeal polymerase is a homologue of RNA polymerase II and initiation requires the basal transcription factors TATA Box-binding protein and transcription factor B. In contrast, archaeal transcription regulators are mainly of the bacterial type. This is a surprising finding and the question arises as to how these bacterial type regulators (mainly helix-turn-helix proteins) interact with this multicomponent eukaryal type basal transcription machinery. To date, little information is available on archaeal regulators. Most of the best characterized proteins belong to the leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) 2The abbreviations used are: Lrp, leucine-responsive regulatory protein; AFM, atomic force microscopy; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; DMSI, dimethyl suberimidate; L, length; P, persistence length; WT, wild type. family (2Brinkman A.B.

At present, the crystallographic structure of only two members of this family is known: LrpA from Pyrococcus furiosus (3Leonard P.M. Smits S.H.J. Sedelnikova S.E.

Sulfolobus solfataricus contains at least five Lrp-like regulators (5Napoli A. van der Oost J. Sensen C. Charlebois R. Rossi M. Ciaramella M. J.

Microbiol. 2004; 54: 321-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Their physiological role is still unclear, except for LysM that is involved in the regulation of lysine metabolism (7Brinkman A.B. Bell S.D. Lebbink R.J. de Vos W.M. van der Oost J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29537-29549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). DNA-binding proteins, especially architectural nucleoid-associated proteins, polymerases, general transcription factors such as TATA Box-binding protein, and transcription regulators, often change the DNA conformation upon binding as part of their mode of action. This can result in DNA bending or even wrapping, DNA looping, DNA stiffening, or other forms of DNA remodeling. Intrinsic bending, protein-induced remodeling of the DNA, and the conformability of operator segments, even if they constitute linker regions that are not directly contacted by the regulatory protein(s), may play an important role in the proceeding of a regulatory response. The determination of the architecture of the regulatory nucleoprotein complex(es) is therefore a crucial step in the analysis of gene regulation. The structural analysis of nucleoprotein complexes can be performed by biochemical analyses, crystallography, or microscopy techniques such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) or electron microscopy. AFM is becoming a widespread and very valuable technique in the study of protein·DNA complexes at nanometer resolution (10Yang Y. Wang H. Erie D.A. Methods (Orlando). 2002; 29: 175-187Google Scholar). This technique is straightforward, and sample preparation and analyses occur under near native conditions, thereby limiting the risk of artifacts. AFM allows the simultaneous analysis of many aspects of the complexes (e.g. morphology, contour length, and bending angle), resulting in both qualitative and quantitative information. As a consequence, the architecture of several protein·DNA complexes formed by bacterial and, to a lesser extent, eukaryal regulators and RNA polymerases have been studied (for a review on bacterial studies, see Ref. 11Dame R.T. Wyman C. Goosen N. J. Microsc. 2003; 212: 244-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, this has not yet been done for archaeal transcription regulators. Here, we use the high resolution imaging capacity of AFM to study the architecture of various Ss-LrpB·DNA complexes. Previously, we have shown that Ss-LrpB binds to its own control region at three specific and regularly spaced binding sites called Box1, Box2, and Box3 (9Peeters E. Thia-Toong T.L. Gigot D. Maes D. Charlier D. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 321-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This Ss-LrpB-DNA interaction occurs with an apparent dissociation constant KD of ∼10 nm, and is cooperative. Each binding site is 15 bp long, semipalindromic, and exhibits a variable degree of sequence identity with the consensus sequence 5′-TTGYAWWWWWTRCAA-3′ (Y = pyrimidine, R = purine, W = weak bp). Box1, the most promoter proximal target, shows an overlap of 1 bp with the BRE promoter element. In-gel footprinting demonstrated that the two outermost binding sites that show a high degree of sequence identity with the consensus sequence are occupied before the middle site, Box2, is bound. Box2 shows less sequence identity with the consensus and is a low affinity site. Protein-protein interactions and DNA deformations are supposed to play an important role in this cooperative interaction (9Peeters E. Thia-Toong T.L. Gigot D. Maes D. Charlier D. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 321-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Here, we determine the oligomeric state of Ss-LrpB in solution and present a detailed analysis of the three-dimensional structure of protein·DNA complexes exhibiting different stoichiometries, formed by binding of Ss-LrpB on the own control region (wild type and mutant forms). Measurements of contour length and bending angle of the complexes indicate that Ss-LrpB binding to the three targets accompanies pronounced DNA bending and condensation. This leads us to the hypothesis that the regulator wraps the control region DNA. These observations provide further insights into the autoregulatory mechanism that is employed by Ss-LrpB. Protein Purification—Recombinant Ss-LrpB protein was obtained by a combination of heat treatment and ion exchange chromatography. Ss-LrpB was purified from a 300-ml culture of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) containing pET24Ss-lrpBNde-null (9Peeters E. Thia-Toong T.L. Gigot D. Maes D. Charlier D. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 321-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The culture was grown in rich medium containing kanamycin (30 μg ml-1) at 30°C. Expression was induced at a cell density of 13.5 × 108 cells ml-1 by adding 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside followed by overnight incubation. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 7000 rev min-1 for 10 min (Sorvall RC5B Plus, rotor SLA-1500) and resuspended in 6 ml of extraction buffer (20 mm piperidine buffer (pH 10.7)). Cells were broken by sonication for 6 min at 20% of the maximal amplitude (Vibracell, Bioblock Scientific) in a cell cooled at 4 °C. After centrifugation of the disrupted cells at 10,000 rev min-1 for 10 min (microcentrifuge), the supernatant was incubated at 80 °C for 10 min. Denatured proteins were removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rev min-1 for 3 min (microcentrifuge). The extract was then loaded on a 6-ml ResourceQ anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with extraction buffer. Ss-LrpB was eluted by applying a linear gradient of 0 to 1.0 m NaCl. Fractions containing Ss-LrpB were identified by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretic mobility shift acssay (EMSA) and pooled. This resulted in ∼4 mg of electrophoretically pure Ss-LrpB. All protein concentrations were determined by a MicroBCA assay (Pierce) and are expressed in Ss-LrpB monomer equivalents. An aliquot of purified Ss-LrpB was analyzed by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 75 16/60 column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated with 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and calibrated with RNase A (13.7 kDa), chymotrypsin A (25 kDa), ovalbumine (43 kDa), and albumin (67 kDa). In total, 185 μg of the Ss-LrpB protein was dialyzed against this buffer and loaded onto the column. Chemical Cross-linking—Chemical cross-linking was performed as described before (12Davies G.E. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 66: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Purified Ss-LrpB was diluted in 0.5 m triethanolamine HCl (pH 8.5) (TEA buffer) to a final concentration of 30 μm. Dimethyl suberimidate (DMSI) was freshly prepared in TEA buffer and added at a final concentration ranging from 0 to 10 mg/ml. Higher DSMI concentrations resulted in smearing and the disappearance of higher molecular mass bands (data not shown). The final volume of each reaction mixture was 16 μl. After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, the reaction was quenched by adding 4 μl of 250 mm Tris (pH 6.8). Fifteen μl of each reaction mixture were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in denaturing conditions (SDS-PAGE). DNA Manipulations—The DNA fragments used in the AFM experiments were prepared by a PCR approach. To obtain the wild type operator fragment, we started from the template DNA pBendBox1 + Box2 + Box3 (9Peeters E. Thia-Toong T.L. Gigot D. Maes D. Charlier D. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 321-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and amplified a 579-bp region containing the three boxes. This was done by using ReadyMix TaqPCR reaction mix (Sigma) and the oligonucleotides 5′-GGTTCCGCGCACATTTCCCCG-3′ and 5′-CGGCATAACCAAGCCTATGCC-3′ as primers. The 583-bp Box2 mutant operator fragment was obtained by a similar approach with pUC18 p/oSs-lrpBBox2TTT as template DNA (9Peeters E. Thia-Toong T.L. Gigot D. Maes D. Charlier D. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 321-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and the oligonucleotides 5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGACCATG-3′ and 5′-GAGAGTGCACCATATGCGGTGTG-3′ as primers. Following the PCR, the DNA fragments were separated from parasite DNA on a 1.5% agarose gel, excised, and eluted using a GenElute gel extraction Kit (Sigma). All oligonucleotides used in this work were purchased from Sigma Genosys. Atomic Force Microscopy—Prior to deposition, DNA molecules (∼130 ng) were diluted in LrpB binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 12.5% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm EDTA) in a total volume of 15 μl. The mixture was then diluted 2-fold in adsorption buffer (40 mm Hepes (pH 6.87), 10 mm NiCl2·6H2O) and 15 μl were deposited on freshly cleaved mica. Allowing 5 min of adsorption, the sample was rinsed with deionized ultrapure water, and excess water was blotted off with absorbing paper. Finally, the mica disc was blown dry in a nitrogen gas stream. Ss-LrpB·DNA complexes were formed by incubating 63 ng of Ss-LrpB-protein with ∼200 ng of DNA (either the WT fragment or the mutant operator fragment) in LrpB binding buffer in a total volume of 15 μl at 37°C for 20 min. This corresponds to an Ss-LrpB concentration of 180 nm. The mixture was deposited on mica following the same procedure as described above. Immediately after deposition, 512 × 512 pixel images were acquired with a Nanoscope IIIa atomic force microscope (Digital Instruments/Veeco) operating in tapping mode at room temperature. We used Nanoprobe SPM tips, type TESP (Veeco), with 125-μm cantilevers with a nominal spring constant of 50 N m-1 and resonant frequencies in the range from 279 to 362 kHz. The scan rate was 2 Hz and the scan size was 1.5 × 1.5 μm. All images in one analysis were obtained with the same tip and deposition. Image Analysis—In the chemical cross-linking experiment, the band densities from the gel electrophoresis analysis were quantified using the Intelligent Quantifier software (Bio Image). All AFM images were flattened prior to analysis using the NanoScope 6.11r1 software (Digital Instruments/Veeco). To measure the contour length and end-to-end distance, the molecules were manually traced using ImageJ (Ref. 13Abramoff M.D. Magelhaes P.J. Ram S.J. Biophotonics Intl. 2004; 11: 36-42Google Scholar; available at rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). All contour length histograms were fitted to a normal distribution (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences). Direct measurement of the bending angle was done using ImageJ, and bending angle analysis was performed by applying the Bending Analysis software (Ref. 14Dame R.T. van Mameren J. Luijsterburg M.S. Mysiak M.E. Janicijevic A. Pazdzior G. van der Vliet P.C. Wyman C. Wuite G.J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33 (erratum (2005) Nucleic Acids Res.33, 2767): e68Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar; available at www.nat.vu.nl/compl/bendinganalysis). The optimal bin size was determined by dividing the range of measurements by the square root of the number of measurements. Volume analysis was done by performing a section analysis with the NanoScope 6.11r1 software. This allowed measurement of the height and width of each complexed region. The width was measured at a height of 0.5 nm, and 0.5 nm was also subtracted from the measured height as a correction for the height of the DNA molecules and the background. It was hypothesized that each complexed region can be approached by an oblate spheroid with the minor axis corresponding to the measured width and the major axis corresponding to the measured height. The apparent volume was calculated as follows: Vapp = π·height·(width)2/6. The apparent volume of the complexed region deviates significantly from the real volume; therefore it was only used for comparisons between molecules of the same deposition, which were imaged with a single tip. Ss-LrpB Behaves Mainly as a Dimer in Solution—DMSI cross-linking is a classical method used for the determination of the oligomeric state(s) of a protein (12Davies G.E. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 66: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). DMSI forms covalent cross-links between lysyl residues by aminidation of the primary amino groups. Fig. 1A shows a DMSI cross-linking experiment carried out with purified Ss-LrpB (theoretical monomer molecular mass of 17.5 kDa). One major band of ∼32.2 kDa and four minor bands of ∼52.2, 67.3, 78.2, and 94.1 kDa appeared after cross-linking. These correspond to cross-linked dimers and cross-linked trimers, tetramers, pentamers, and hexamers, respectively (Fig. 1A). Even at the highest DMSI concentrations used, the Ss-LrpB dimer constitutes by far the predominant cross-linked species (>85%). Tetramers and trimers made up between 5 and 10% of the cross-linked protein at DMSI concentrations of at least 1.25 mg/ml. Cross-linked hexamers and pentamers only appeared at the highest DMSI concentrations used. Therefore, in solution Ss-LrpB occurs mainly as a dimer. In parallel, we performed similar experiments with two other Lrp-like proteins, Ss-Lrp and Sa-Lrp from S. solfataricus and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, respectively, which have a characterized oligomeric state (8Enoru-Eta J. Gigot D. Glansdorff N. Charlier D. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1541-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). DMSI cross-linking confirmed that Ss-Lrp exists primarily as a tetramer in solution and that Sa-Lrp forms different oligomeric species up to a dodecamer (data not shown). The oligomeric state of Ss-LrpB as determined by cross-linking was supported by size exclusion chromatography, in the sense that no Ss-LrpB oligomeric forms higher than a dimer were detected. Purified Ss-LrpB was applied to the column at a concentration of 5.2 μm. Only one peak, eluting with a maximum corresponding to 22.4 kDa (Fig. 1B), contained Ss-LrpB perceptible by SDS-PAGE. This molecular mass lies closer to that of an Ss-LrpB monomer (17.5 kDa) than to that of a dimer (35 kDa). Due to possible interactions with the column beads or a non-spherical architecture of the dimeric protein, the peak can more likely be explained by a dimer eluting later than a monomer eluting earlier. In any case, no higher molecular weight Ss-LrpB peaks were observed. Therefore, it can be concluded that no significant amount of Ss-LrpB exist as oligomeric forms higher than a dimer at the concentrations used. Visualization of DNA Molecules by AFM—Purified 579-bp-long PCR amplicons were used containing the three regularly spaced binding sites of the Ss-lrpB control region near the center of the fragment (Fig. 2A). Each Box is 15 bp long. The center-to-center distance between Box1 and Box2, and Box2 and Box3, is 32 and 31 bp, respectively (Fig. 2B). Tapping mode AFM in air allowed visualization of these DNA molecules (Fig. 2C). The contour length (L) of 355 DNA molecules was measured by tracing the molecules from one end to the other using ImageJ. Overlapping DNA molecules or molecules that contained visible anomalies were omitted from the analysis. This resulted in an average length L of 173 ± 16 nm (Fig. 3A). The calculated axial base pair rise is 0.30 nm/bp (L/579), which is a value lower than the rise of regular B-form DNA (0.34 nm/bp) but in agreement with the bp rise determined in previous AFM studies. The difference with the theoretical bp rise can be explained by the smoothing procedure that rounds sharp bends and the limited resolution of the microscope, incapable of resolving bends within a small range (15Rivetti C. Guthold M. Bustamante C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4464-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar).FIGURE 3A, histogram of the contour length distribution of 355 unbound DNA molecules with an overlay of a normal distribution curve.

This is in contrast to kinetic trapping, a process that results in the projection of the three-dimensional conformation of the molecules (16Rivetti C. Guthold M. Bustamante C. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 919-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). The latter would result in unrelevant data on the conformation of the complexes. This can be assessed by analyzing DNA persistence length (P). P describes the bendability of a DNA molecule and is a measure of the average length at which thermal energy causes the DNA molecule to bend in another direction. The mean square end-to-end distance (〈R2 〉) can be expressed as a function of L and P for both cases (〈R2 〉2D or 〈R2 〉proj, respectively) (16Rivetti C. Guthold M. Bustamante C. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 919-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Assuming a P of 53 nm, which is the value for DNA molecules in solution (independent of the length of the molecules), and a L of 173 nm for the operator DNA, 〈R2 〉2D would correspond to 18,597 nm2 and 〈R2 〉proj to 8623 nm2. The experimentally obtained 〈R2 〉 of this set of DNA molecules is 18,494 nm2 which is a value consistent with the two-dimensional (2D) model. P was also determined when applying simulation-based bending analysis software (see below; Ref. 14Dame R.T. van Mameren J. Luijsterburg M.S. Mysiak M.E. Janicijevic A. Pazdzior G. van der Vliet P.C. Wyman C. Wuite G.J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33 (erratum (2005) Nucleic Acids Res.33, 2767): e68Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The normalized R distribution of these molecules was fitted using distributions obtained by simulations of DNA molecules exhibiting no protein-induced bending. This resulted in a L/p value of 3.2, corresponding to a P of 54 nm. Therefore, free equilibration can be assumed. Visualization of Distinct Ss-LrpB·Operator Complexes—AFM allowed visualization of the conformational change of the operator DNA molecules caused by binding of Ss-LrpB (Fig. 2). To obtain a stoichiometrically uniform population representing full occupation of the operator, Ss-LrpB·DNA complexes were allowed to be formed at a Ss-LrpB concentration (180 nm) that favorizes binding to all three Boxes. Many complexes were observed, most of them being “single” complexes, containing only one DNA molecule (Fig. 2D). Single complexes with different morphologies were observed (Fig. 2, E-H). They have in common that their complexed region is typically globular shaped with two DNA arms of nearly identical length. This globular shape and the sharp angle formed between the in- and out-going DNA arms are indicative of DNA wrapping. Besides the single complexes, “multiple” complexes were observed, containing several DNA molecules linked by higher oligomeric Ss-LrpB forms (Fig. 2, D and J). Their number might be underestimated because larger complexes might not attach as firmly to the mica surface as smaller ones. In a single case, a complex was formed with two adjacent globular regions (Fig. 2, D and I). This morphology is an indication of the existence of rare complexes (at this protein concentration) with a different stoichiometry. Likely, this molecule represents binding of two Ss-LrpB oligomers to two binding sites. The existence of these types of complexes was confirmed when analyzing complexes with a mutant operator fragment (see below). For the remainder of the analysis with WT operator complexes, only single complexes are considered. Ss-LrpB Shortens the DNA Contour Length upon Full Occupation of the Operator—Measuring the contour length of protein·DNA complexes can provide more information on protein-induced conformational changes. In case of DNA wrapping a foreshortening can be expected. The contour length of AFM-visualized complexes can be measured in different ways (Fig. 3, B and C). The visible contour length corresponds to the total length of the two naked DNA arms. This might result in an underestimation of the length because the “shadow” of the protein causes a partial occlusion of the naked DNA (17Heddle J.G. Mitelheiser S. Maxwell A. Thomson N.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The read-through contour length corresponds to the visible length increased with the length of the shortest path through the complexed region. This measurement could result in an overestimation when the entry and exit points of the DNA are distant; the DNA measured through the complexed region could then be part of the DNA that is condensed by the protein. We measured both visible and read-through contour length for 353 Ss-LrpB·DNA complexes with the WT operator fragment (Fig. 3, B and C). It can be assumed that in most complexes all three Boxes are bound (due to the high Ss-LrpB concentration). The visible contour length was on average 130 ± 19 nm, which is a difference of 43 nm or 143 bp with the contour length of unbound DNA molecules. The read-through contour length was 158 ± 18 nm, which corresponds to a difference of 15 nm or 50 bp. Therefore, it can be concluded that Ss-LrpB considerably condenses the DNA upon full occupation of the operator, a very strong indication of DNA wrapping. The exact amount of bps condensed by the protein will probably be situated between 50 and 143 bp. The three Boxes and linkers correspond to 78 bp. Ss-LrpB Bends the DNA with an Average Bending Angle of 260°—Circular permutation assays (9Peeters E. Thia-Toong T.L. Gigot D. Maes D. Charlier D. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 321-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and the AFM images described above suggest that Ss-LrpB might cause a pronounced bending or even wrapping of the operator region. We used the tangent method to determine the apparent bending angle of the Ss-LrpB·DNA complexes by direct measurement of the angle between the in- and out-going DNA tails of the 353 complexes, which were also used for contour length measurements. The bending angle was calculated by subtracting the measured angle from 180° (Fig. 4A). This resulted in an apparent bending angle of 88 ± 45° (Fig. 4B). This is a very broad distribution that likely reflects the effect of thermal fluctuations and the flexibility of the complexes, rather than the existence of several “microstates” exhibiting different bending angles. The latter would result in separate populations with different mobilities in EMSAs, which is not the case (9Peeters E. Thia-Toong T.L. Gigot D. Maes D. Charlier D. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 321-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This broad distribution is consistent with other AFM studies of protein-induced DNA bending (15Rivetti C. Guthold M. Bustamante C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4464-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 18Jafri S. Evoy S. Cho K. Craighead H.G. Winans S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 811-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recently, a method was developed to allow bending angle analysis of AFM images based on the end-to-end distance (R) distribution of the nucleoprotein complexes (14Dame R.T. van Mameren J. Luijsterburg M.S. Mysiak M.E. Janicijevic A. Pazdzior G. van der Vliet P.C. Wyman C. Wuite G.J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33 (erratum (2005) Nucleic Acids Res.33, 2767): e68Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The R distribution, normalized by L, is fitted to histograms based on simulations using least squares minimization (14Dame R.T. van Mameren J. Luijsterburg M.S. Mysiak M.E. Janicijevic A. Pazdzior G. van der Vliet P.C. Wyman C. Wuite G.J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33 (erratum (2005) Nucleic Acids Res.33, 2767): e68Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The bin size was chosen to be optimal. The application of the simulation-based bending analysis software (Bending Analysis) indicated a best fit apparent bending angle of 100° (Fig. 4, C and D). This value is higher than the apparent angle obtained by direct measurement (tangent method) and will probably be a better approximation of the real bending angle. If the DNA is being wrapped, an apparent bending angle of 100° would correspond to a 260° bend in the opposite direction (Fig. 4A). Ss-LrpB Binding to the Box2 Mutant Operator—To further analyze the structural identity of the globular nucleoprotein complexes observed with the WT operator, we have analyzed complexes formed with an operator mutant carrying a three bp substitution (CAA to TTT) in the downstream half-site of Box2 (Fig. 5A). As shown previously by EMSA, this mutation inhibits but does not completely abolish the formation of complexes with all three sites"

https://openalex.org/W2035709706,"Transcription activators often recruit promoter-targeted assembly of a pre-initiation complex; many repressors antagonize recruitment. These activities can involve direct interactions with proteins in the pre-initiation complex. We used an optimized yeast two-hybrid system to screen mouse pregnancy-associated libraries for proteins that interact with TATA-binding protein (TBP). Screens revealed an interaction between TBP and a single member of the zinc finger family of transcription factors, ZFP523. Two members of the protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS) family, PIAS1 and PIAS3, also interacted with TBP in screens. Endogenous PIAS1 and TBP co-immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts, suggesting the interaction occurred in vivo. In vitro-translated PIAS1 and TBP coimmunopreciptated, which indicated that other nuclear proteins were not required for the interaction. Deletion analysis mapped the PIAS-interacting domain of TBP to the conserved TBPCORE and the TBP-interacting domain on PIAS1 to a 39-amino acid C-terminal region. Mammals issue seven known PIAS proteins from four pias genes, pias1, pias3, piasx, and piasy, each with different cell type-specific expression patterns; the TBP-interacting domain reported here is the only part of the PIAS C-terminal region shared by all seven PIAS proteins. Direct analyses indicated that PIASx and PIASy also interacted with TBP. Our results suggest that all PIAS proteins might mediate situation-specific regulatory signaling at the TBP interface and that previously unknown levels of complexity could exist in the gene regulatory interplay between TBP, PIAS proteins, ZFP523, and other transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W2040112072,"We previously demonstrated that Jak3 is a primary response gene for G-CSF and ectopic overexpression of Jak3 can accelerate granulocytic differentiation of normal mouse bone marrow cells induced by G-CSF and GM-CSF. To gain insight into the regulation of G-CSF-induced transcription of Jak3, we constructed deletion and linker scanning mutants of the Jak3 promoter sequences and performed luciferase reporter assays in the murine myeloid cell line 32Dcl3, with and without G-CSF stimulation. These experiments showed that mutation of a −67 to −85 element, which contained a putative Sp1 binding site, or mutation of a −44 to −53 GAS element resulted in a marked reduction of Jak3 promoter activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that Sp1 and Stat3 present in nuclear lysates of 32Dcl3 cells stimulated with G-CSF can bind to the −67 to −85 element and −44 to −53 GAS element, respectively. In addition, cotransfection of a constitutively active mutant of Stat3 along with a Jak3 promoter/luciferase reporter resulted in enhanced Jak3 promoter activity. Together, these results demonstrate that activation of Jak3 transcription during G-CSF- induced granulocytic differentiation is mediated by the combined action of Sp1 and Stat3, a mechanism also shown to be important in IL-6-induced monocytic differentiation."
