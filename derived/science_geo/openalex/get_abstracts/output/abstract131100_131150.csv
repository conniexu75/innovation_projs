https://openalex.org/W2120138780,"Protein kinase B (PKB) is activated in response to phosphoinositide 3-kinases and their lipid products phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3 ] and PtdIns(3,4)P 2 in the signaling pathways used by a wide variety of growth factors, antigens, and inflammatory stimuli. PKB is a direct target of these lipids, but this regulation is complex. The lipids can bind to the pleckstrin homologous domain of PKB, causing its translocation to the membrane, and also enable upstream, Thr 308 -directed kinases to phosphorylate and activate PKB. Four isoforms of these PKB kinases were purified from sheep brain. They bound PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3 and associated with lipid vesicles containing it. These kinases contain an NH 2 -terminal catalytic domain and a COOH-terminal pleckstrin homologous domain, and their heterologous expression augments receptor activation of PKB, which suggests they are the primary signal transducers that enable PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3 or PtdIns- (3,4)P 2 to activate PKB and hence to control signaling pathways regulating cell survival, glucose uptake, and glycogen metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2041926656,"Activation of the protein p70 s6k by mitogens leads to increased translation of a family of messenger RNAs that encode essential components of the protein synthetic apparatus. Activation of the kinase requires hierarchical phosphorylation at multiple sites, culminating in the phosphorylation of the threonine in position 229 (Thr 229 ), in the catalytic domain. The homologous site in protein kinase B (PKB), Thr 308 , has been shown to be phosphorylated by the phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase PDK1. A regulatory link between p70 s6k and PKB was demonstrated, as PDK1 was found to selectively phosphorylate p70 s6k at Thr 229 . More importantly, PDK1 activated p70 s6k in vitro and in vivo, whereas the catalytically inactive PDK1 blocked insulin-induced activation of p70 s6k ."

Chemical and ultrastructural analyses together with map-based cloning indicate that the RSW1 locus of Arabidopsis encodes the catalytic subunit of cellulose synthase. The cloned gene complements the rsw1 mutant whose temperature-sensitive allele is changed in one amino acid. The mutant allele causes a specific reduction in cellulose synthesis, accumulation of noncrystalline β-1,4-glucan, disassembly of cellulose synthase, and widespread morphological abnormalities. Microfibril crystallization may require proper assembly of the RSW1 gene product into synthase complexes whereas glucan biosynthesis per se does not."
https://openalex.org/W1976140288,"Different classes of mammalian transcription factors—nuclear receptors, cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate–regulated enhancer binding protein (CREB), and signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT-1)—functionally require distinct components of the coactivator complex, including CREB-binding protein (CBP/p300), nuclear receptor coactivators (NCoAs), and p300/CBP-associated factor (p/CAF), based on their platform or assembly properties. Retinoic acid receptor, CREB, and STAT-1 also require different histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activities to activate transcription. Thus, transcription factor–specific differences in configuration and content of the coactivator complex dictate requirements for specific acetyltransferase activities, providing an explanation, at least in part, for the presence of multiple HAT components of the complex."

A kindred with a rare, recessively inherited type of alopecia universalis was used to search for a locus by homozygosity mapping, and linkage was established in a 6-centimorgan interval on chromosome 8p12 (the logarithm of the odds favoring linkage score was 6.19). The human homolog of a murine gene, hairless, was localized in this interval by radiation hybrid mapping, and a missense mutation was found in affected individuals. Human hairless encodes a putative single zinc finger transcription factor protein with restricted expression in the brain and skin."

Previous studies have shown that treatment of LDL with bacterial sphingomyelinase (SMase)in vitro leads to the formation of lesion-like LDL aggregates that become retained on extracellular matrix and stimulate macrophage foam cell formation. In addition, aggregated human lesional LDL, but not unaggregated lesional LDL or plasma LDL, shows evidence of hydrolysis by an arterial wall SMase in vivo, and several arterial wall cell types secrete a SMase (S-SMase). S-SMase, however, has a sharp acid pH optimum using a standard in vitroSM-micelle assay. Thus, a critical issue regarding the potential role of S-SMase in atherogenesis is whether the enzyme can hydrolyze lipoprotein-SM, particularly at neutral pH. We now show that S-SMase can hydrolyze and aggregate native plasma LDL at pH 5.5 but not at pH 7.4. Remarkably, LDL modified by oxidation, treatment with phospholipase A2, or enrichment with apolipoprotein CIII, which are modifications associated with increased atherogenesis, is hydrolyzed readily by S-SMase at pH 7.4. In addition, lipoproteins from the plasma of apolipoprotein E knock-out mice, which develop extensive atherosclerosis, are highly susceptible to hydrolysis and aggregation by S-SMase at pH 7.4; a high SM:PC ratio in these lipoproteins appears to be an important factor in their susceptibility to S-SMase. Most importantly, LDL extracted from human atherosclerotic lesions, which is enriched in sphingomyelin compared with plasma LDL, is hydrolyzed by S-SMase at pH 7.4 10-fold more than same donor plasma LDL, suggesting that LDL is modified in the arterial wall to increase its susceptibility to S-SMase. In summary, atherogenic lipoproteins are excellent substrates for S-SMase, even at neutral pH, making this enzyme a leading candidate for the arterial wall SMase that hydrolyzes LDL-SM and causes subendothelial LDL aggregation.

First, processes that promote lipoprotein aggregation before or during retention dramatically increase the amount of lipoprotein retained (16Tabas I. Li Y. Brocia R.W. Xu S.W. Swenson T.L. Williams K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20419-20432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, aggregated LDL, but not unaggregated LDL, is a potent inducer of macrophage foam cell formation (17Hoff H.F. O'Neill J. Pepin J.M. Cole T.B. Eur.

Although the mechanism of lipoprotein aggregation in lesions is not known, several studies from our laboratories suggest a role for the enzyme sphingomyelinase (SMase). First, LDL treated with bacterial SMase forms lesion-like self-aggregates (20Xu X.X. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24849-24858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) due to enrichment in ceramide (7Schissel S.L. Tweedie-Hardman J. Rapp J.H. Graham G. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1455-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), the major product of SM hydrolysis; furthermore, these aggregates potently induce macrophage foam cell formation in vitro (16Tabas I.

Chem. 1991; 266: 24849-24858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, aggregated LDL from human atherosclerotic lesions, but not unaggregated lesional LDL or plasma LDL, shows evidence of hydrolysis by an extracellular SMase, and LDL retained in rabbit aortic strips ex vivo is hydrolyzed by an extracellular, cation-dependent SMase (7Schissel S.L. Tweedie-Hardman J. Rapp J.H. Graham G. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1455-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Third, and most important, we have found that several cell types present in atherosclerotic lesions, namely macrophages (21Schissel S.L. Schuchman E.H. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18431-18436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and endothelial cells, 2Marathe, S., Schissel, S.

L., Schuchman, E., Yellin, M., Beatini, N., Minzer, R., Williams, K. J., and Tabas, I. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, in press. secrete a Zn2+-activated SMase (S-SMase). The cellular origins, secretion, and cation dependence make S-SMase a leading candidate for the arterial wall SMase that acts on retained lipoproteins. Nonetheless, two major issues regarding the relevance of S-SMase to atherogenesis needed to be addressed. First, mammalian SMases are much more selective than bacterial SMases in terms of the milieu in which the SM is presented to the enzyme (22Spence M.W. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 3-23PubMed Google Scholar). 3S. L. Schissel and I. Tabas, unpublished data. 3S. L. Schissel and I. Tabas, unpublished data. Second, studies on the molecular origin of S-SMase have revealed that it is a product of the same gene, the acid SMase (ASM) gene, that gives rise to lysosomal SMase (L-SMase) (21Schissel S.L. Schuchman E.H. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18431-18436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, therefore, S-SMase shares with L-SMase a sharp acid pH optimum when assayed under standardin vitro conditions using detergent-solubilized SM-micelles as a substrate (21Schissel S.L. Schuchman E.H. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18431-18436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 23Spence M.W. Byers D.M. St C. Palmer F.B. Cook H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5358-5363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is possible that acidic enzymes are active in advanced atherosclerotic lesions, where local pockets of acidity may occur (24Menkin V. Am. J. Pathol. 1934; 10: 193-210PubMed Google Scholar, 25Smith E.B. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1979; 115: 245-297Crossref Google Scholar, 26Maroudas A. Weinberg P.D. Parker K.H. Winlove C.P. Biophys.

Etherington D.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar), a role for such enzymes in pre-lesional or early lesional events would require activity at neutral pH with physiologic substrates. In this context, the goal of the current study was to test whether S-SMase can hydrolyze LDL-SM, particularly at neutral pH. Herein, we show that S-SMase can hydrolyze and aggregate native LDL at acid but not neutral pH. LDL modified by several means that have been shown to occur or might occur during atherogenesis, however, is an excellent substrate for S-SMase at pH 7.4. Most importantly, LDL extracted from human atherosclerotic lesions is efficiently hydrolyzed by S-SMase at neutral pH, suggesting that LDL is modified in the arterial wall to increase its susceptibility to S-SMase. Our results support a role for S-SMase in the subendothelial hydrolysis of LDL-SM, perhaps leading to lipoprotein aggregation and lesion initiation and progression. sn-1,2-Diacylglycerol kinase (fromEscherichia coli) was purchased from Calbiochem.

Briefly, aortic plaque was removed from individuals as part of the standard reconstructive surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysms at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center.

The dried lipids were resuspended in 1 ml of 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and, to prepare [3H]SM/PC liposomes, sonicated for three 50-s pulses at 4 °C using a tapered microtip on a Branson 450 sonicator (setting 3). The liposomes were then incubated with 30 mg (by protein mass) of LDL, 50 μg of partially purified phospholipid transfer protein, 100 units of penicillin, and 100 μg of streptomycin for 18 h at 37 °C under argon. LDL was then separated from the liposomes after phospholipid transfer by centrifuging the mixture at density = 1.006 g/ml for 8 h at 35,000 rpm in a Beckman 50.3 rotor; the supernatant containing the liposomes was removed, and the LDL band at the bottom of the tube was harvested. The LDL solution was mixed with buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.3 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and centrifuged as before. This wash procedure was performed a total of four times, resulting in the removal of 95% of the unreacted [3H]SM/PC liposomes. All lipoproteins were stored under argon at 4 °C and were used within 2 weeks of preparation. [3H]SM-emulsions with a lipid composition similar to human LDL were prepared as follows: 5.4 mg of cholesteryl oleate, 0.48 mg of triolein, 1.08 mg of free cholesterol, 2.04 mg of phosphatidylcholine, 0.96 mg of sphingomyelin, and 50 μCi of [N-palmitoyl-9,10-3H]sphingomyelin were all added in chloroform to a sonication vial, and the solvent was completely evaporated by exposure to a stream of nitrogen, followed by the high vacuum of a lyophilizer. The dried lipids were resuspended in 3 ml of buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.3 mmEDTA, pH 7.4, and sonicated under a stream of argon at 40 °C until translucent (approximately 90 min). The sonicated material was then centrifuged twice at 15,000 × g to pellet any titanium shed from the sonication probe. SM-rich emulsions were prepared exactly as above except that 1.2 mg of phosphatidylcholine and 1.8 mg of SM were used, and sonication time was increased to 120 min. [3H]SM-emulsions were enriched with apoCIII based on the method of Ahmad et al. (42Ahmad T.Y. Beaudet A.L. Sparrow J.T. Morrisett J.D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4415-4420Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Briefly, [3H]SM-emulsions (0.4 ml; 182 nmol of SM) were incubated with 200 μg of apoCIII (22.5 nmol) for 2 h at 40 °C. A portion of the emulsions was re-isolated from free apoCIII using ultrafiltration (29Clavey V. Lestavel-Delattre S. Copin C. Bard J.M. Fruchart J.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) as follows: the crude emulsion/apoCIII mixture was diluted to 2 ml with buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.3 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and ultrafiltered and concentrated to 0.2 ml using a Centricon 30 (molecular weight cut-off = 30,000); the concentrated emulsions were then diluted to 2 ml, and the process was repeated 5 times. [3H]SM-emulsions run through the same enrichment and re-isolation protocols in the absence of apoCIII served as the control for the experiments in Fig. 5 A. Ceramide was measured from LDL lipid extracts using the method described by Schneider and Kennedy (43Schneider E.G. Kennedy E.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 441: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and adapted by Preiss et al. (44Preiss J. Loomis C.R. Bishop W.R. Stein R. Niedel J.E. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8597-8600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this method, diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase phosphorylates ceramide and DAG using [γ-32P]ATP. For ceramide measurement, the lipids were first incubated with 0.1 n KOH in methanol for 1 h at 37 °C, which hydrolyzes DAG but not ceramide. The extracted lipids were dried under nitrogen and then solubilized in 5 mmcardiolipin, 7.5% octyl-β-glucopyranoside, and 1 mmdiethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid by bath sonication. This solution was then added to reaction buffer (50 mm imidazole HCl, pH 6.6, 50 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) containing sn-1,2-DAG kinase (0.7 units/ml). The reaction was initiated by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP (final concentration = 10 mm). After incubation at room temperature for 60 min, the reaction was stopped by lipid extraction with chloroform:methanol:HCl (100:100:1, v/v/v) and 10 mm EDTA. Ceramide 1-[32P]phosphate in the organic phase was separated by TLC using chloroform:methanol:acetic acid (65:15:5, v/v/v) and visualized with autoradiography and identified by comparing with standards. The spots corresponding to ceramide 1-[32P]phosphate were scraped and counted, and the mass was calculated by comparison with a ceramide standard curve. To rule out changes in the DAG kinase enzyme itself (cf. Ref. 45Watts J.D. Gu M. Polverino A.J. Patterson S.D. Aebersold R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7292-7296Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), C2:0 ceramide was added to some of the lipid extracts and shown not to undergo increased phosphorylation in samples in which LDL ceramide was found to be elevated. Lipid extracts (46Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42389) Google Scholar) of lipoproteins were chromatographed by TLC using chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:H2O (50:25:8:4, v/v/v/v). Individual phospholipid subclasses were visualized by iodine vapor staining, and the SM and PC spots were identified by comparison with standards. The spots were scraped, extracted twice with chloroform:methanol (2:1), and assayed for phosphate content by the method of Bartlett (47Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LDL lipid peroxides were measured using the method of El-Saadani et al. (48El-Saadani M. Esterbauer H. El-Sayed M. Goher M. Nassar A.Y. Jurgens G. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 627-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LDL (50–150 μg of protein), in a volume of no more than 100 μl, was added to 1 ml of color reagent (0.2 m KH2PO4, 0.12 m KI, 0.15 mm NaN3, 2 g of Triton X-100/liter, 0.1 g of benzalkonium chloride/liter, 10 μm ammonium molybdate, 20 μm BHT, 25 μm EDTA, pH 6.2) and incubated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature; light absorbance at 365 nm was then measured and lipid peroxides were quantified by comparison with a H2O2 standard curve. Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) were measured using a standard method (49Puhl H. Waeg G. Esterbauer H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 425-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Briefly, LDL (100 μl, 100–200 μg of protein) was mixed with 1 ml of 20% trichloroacetic acid and incubated on ice for 30 min. Following precipitation, 1 ml of 1% thiobarbituric acid was added, and the samples were heated at 95 °C for 45 min. After cooling, the samples were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 20 min, and the light absorbance at 532 nm was measured. TBARS were quantified by comparison with a malonaldehyde standard curve prepared using tetramethoxypropane. LDL electrophoretic mobility was assayed by loading 30 μg of LDL protein onto a polyacrylamide 0.75–27% gradient gel (Lipogel; Zaxis, Hudson, OH) and electrophoresing in 0.1m Tris base, 0.1 m boric acid, 20 mm EDTA (upper chamber, pH 8.7; lower chamber, pH 8.3) for 12 h at 100 V. The gel was then stained with Sudan black and the bands visualized by counter-staining with methanol:acetic acid:water (10:7:83, v/v/v). The source of S-SMase was serum-free conditioned medium from DG44 Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with the human acid SMase cDNA (21Schissel S.L. Schuchman E.H. Williams K.J. Tabas I.

Schuchman E.H. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18431-18436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in 100-mm dishes and cultured for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 292 μg of glutamine/ml, 100 units penicillin/ml, and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml. The cells were then changed to low protein serum-free media for 12 h, washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline, and finally incubated for 18 h in fresh serum-free media (6 ml per 100-mm dish). The “18-h conditioned medium” was then collected, centrifuged at 1000 × g to pellet any cells, and, except where indicated, ZnCl2 (final concentration = 100 μm) was added to fully activate and stabilize S-SMase; this S-SMase-containing conditioned medium was then used fresh to treat"
https://openalex.org/W2151064612,"The genes of the family of interferon (IFN) regulatory factors (IRF) encode DNA binding transcriptional factors that are involved in modulation of transcription of IFN and interferon-induced genes (ISG). The presence of IRF binding sites in the promoter region of IFNA and IFNB genes indicates that IRF factors recognizing these sites play an important role in the virus-mediated induction of these genes. We have described a novel human gene of this family, IRF-3, that is constitutively expressed in a variety of cell types. IRF-3 binds to the interferon-sensitive response element (ISRE) present in the ISG15 gene promoter and activates its transcriptional activity. In the present study, we examined whether IRF-3 can modulate transcriptional activity of IFNA and IFNB promoter regions. Our results demonstrate that IRF-3 can bind to the IRF-like binding sites present in the virus-inducible region of the IFNA4 promoter and to the PRDIII region of the IFNB promoter but cannot alone stimulate their transcriptional activity in the human cell line, 293. However, the fusion protein generated from the IRF-3 binding domain and the RelA(p65) activation domain effectively activates both IFNA4 and IFNB promoters. Cotransfection of IRF-3 and RelA(p65) expression plasmids activates the IFNBgene promoter but not the promoter of IFNA4 gene that does not contain the NF-kB binding site. Surprisingly, activation of the IFNA4 gene promoter by virus and IRF-1 in these cells was inhibited by IRF-3. These data indicate that in 293 cells IRF-3 does not stimulate expression of IFN genes but can cooperate with RelA(p65) to stimulate the IFNB promoter.

Viral infection leads to the transient expression of early inflammatory genes. The proteins encoded by these genes enhance recognition of the infected cells by the host immune system. A group of proteins, called interferons (IFNs), 1The abbreviations used are: IFN, interferon; IRF, interferon regulatory factor; ISG, interferon-stimulated gene; ISRE, interferon-sensitive response element; NDV, Newcastle disease virus; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis; IE, inducible element; PRD, positive regulatory domain; VRE, virus-inducible regions; aa, amino acid. 1The abbreviations used are: IFN, interferon; IRF, interferon regulatory factor; ISG, interferon-stimulated gene; ISRE, interferon-sensitive response element; NDV, Newcastle disease virus; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis; IE, inducible element; PRD, positive regulatory domain; VRE, virus-inducible regions; aa, amino acid. can directly inhibit viral replication. Type I IFNs are encoded by a family of closely related α genes and a single IFNB gene, which are all localized on chromosome 9 (1Diaz M.O. Pomykala H.M. Bohlander S.K. Maltepe E. Malik K.

A. 1993; 90: 5893-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The sequences that regulate inducible transcription of these genes are localized within the 100-nucleotide 5′-end of the transcriptional start of IFNA and IFNB genes (3Hiscott J. Nguyen H. Lin R. Semin. Virol. 1995; 6: 161-173Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 4Pitha P.M. Au W.-C. Semin. Virol. 1995; 6: 151-159Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These regions contain a number of a short overlapping GAAAGT-rich sequences that serve as a binding sites for multiple transcriptional factors. Several elements that function as positive regulatory domains (PRD) in virus-infected cells were identified in the promoter region of the IFNB gene (5Maniatis T Whittemore L. Du W. Fan C. Keller A.D. Palombella V.J. Thanos D.N. Transcription Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). It was further shown that the region designated as PRDII contains an NF-kB binding site (6Fujita T. Kimura Y. Miyamoto M. Barsoumian E.L. Taniguchi T.

Acad. Sci. U. S.

The transcriptional activation of this promoter, in virus-infected cells, is a result of the interaction among these multiple transcriptional factors (13Leblanc J.F. Cohen L. Rodrigues M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3987-3993Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) where the virus-induced binding of p50·p65 heterodimer plays a crucial role (14Garoufalis E. Kwan I. Lin R. Mustafa A.

However, both the murine and human IFNA virus-inducible regions (VRE) contain multiple repeats to the GAAAGT and AAGTGA elements that could serve as binding sites for the IRF-1 and IRF-2 factors (16Naf D.

In addition, the deletion and mutation analysis of the murine IFNA4 promoter region identified an essential element, named αF1 (19Raj N.B.K. Au W.-C. Pitha P.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 24032-24040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the human IFNA1 promoter region, another essential binding site interacting with the TG protein was identified (21MacDonald N.J. Kuhl D. Maguire D. Naf D. Gallant P. Goswamy A. Hug H. Bueler H.

Recent studies have identified a distinct multisubunit complex in virus-induced cells (22Genin P. Braganca J. Darracq N. Doly J. Civas A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5055-5063Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The presence of IRF-like binding sites in the promoter region of the IFNA and IFNB genes indicated that the IRF factors recognizing these sites play an essential role in the induction of IFN genes. The original results of Harada et al. (11Harada H. Fujita T. Miyamoto M. Kimura Y. Maruyama M. Furia A. Miyata T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1989; 58: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar) suggested that the up-regulation of these genes is mediated by IRF-1, while the closely related IRF-2 suppresses the expression of these genes. However, the essential role of IRF-1 and IRF-2 in the regulation of IFNA and IFNB gene expression in infected cells was disputed by the finding that mice containing the homozygous deletion of IRF-1 or IRF-2, or fibroblast derived from these mice, were able to induce IFNA and IFNB gene expression upon infection with Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) to the same level as the wild-type mice or cells (23Matsuyama T.

IRF-1 binds the ISRE element present in many IFN-inducible gene promoters and activates expression of some of these genes (26Kamijo R. Harada H. Matsuyama T. Bosland M. Gerecitano J. Shapiro D. Le J.

The homozygous deletion of p48 in mice abolishes the sensitivity of these mice to the antiviral effect of IFNs (25Kimura T. Kadokawa Y. Harada H. Matsumoto M. Sato M. Kashiwazaki Y. Taruntani M.

Another novel member of the IRF family, IRF-7, was recently identified by its ability to bind to an ISRE-like element in the promoter region of the Qp gene of EBV (42Nonkwelo C. Ruf I.K. Sample J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6887-6897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Zhang L. Pagano J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5748-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the genome of human herpesvirus 8 contains four open reading frames, which show homology to the cellular IRF family of genes (44Russo J.J. Bohenzky R.A. Chien M.-C. Chen J. Yan M. Maddalena D. Parry J.P. Peruzzi D. Edelman I.S. Chang Y. Moore P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14862-14867Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). These data indicate that transcriptional factors of the IRF family may modulate not only the expression of cellular genes but viral genes as well. We previously identified and described another member of the human IRF family, IRF-3 (45Au W.-C. Moore P.A. Lowther W. Juang Y.-T. Pitha P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11657-11661Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The IRF-3 gene encodes a 55-kDa protein and is expressed constitutively in all tissues. Recombinant IRF-3 binds to the ISRE element of the IFN-induced gene, ISG15, and overexpression of IRF-3 activates transcription of this promoter in the transient expression assay. Viral infection or IFN treatment does not activate the expression of the IRF-3 gene. In the present study, we address the question whether IRF-3 can modulate the expression of IFNA and IFNB genes. The IRF-1 site(s) plays an important role in the transcriptional activation of these genes; therefore, it is important to determine which member of the IRF family plays a role in the activation of IFNA and IFNB genes in virus-infected cells. Our results demonstrate that: 1) recombinant IRF-3 can bind to the IRF-like binding sites present in the virus-inducible region of the IFNA and IFNB promoters; 2) in 293 cells, overexpression of IRF-3 neither activates transcription of the IFNA or IFNB promoters in a transient expression assay nor induces expression of the endogenous IFN genes; 3) fusion of the IRF-3 DNA binding domain with the RelA(p65) transactivation domain generated a fusion protein that effectively activated both the IFNA and IFNB promoters; and 4) activation of the IFNA4 promoter region by IRF-1 in these cells is inhibited in the presence of IRF-3. 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. In the transfection assays, subconfluent 293 cells (2.5 × 106 cells/plate) were cotransfected with 2.5 μg of reporter plasmid chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and the indicated amounts of the IRF or p65 expression plasmids, using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (46Mosca J.D.

When indicated, treatment with IFNα (500 units/ml) or infection with NDV (multiplicity of infection = 5) was done 24 h after transfection for 16 h. Protein extracts, prepared by the freeze-thaw method, and CAT assays were done as described previously (19Raj N.B.K. Au W.-C. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11360-11365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To compensate for the possible differences in transfection efficiency, each sample was cotransfected with β-galactosidase expressing plasmid (2.5 μg), and CAT activity was normalized to the constant levels of β-galactosidase (47MacGregor G.R. Caskey C.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The total transfected DNA was kept constant in each experiment. Each transfection with the CAT reporter plasmids was repeated at least three times, and the data presented represents averages of these experiments. The IRF-3 and IRF-1 expression plasmids in which expression of IRF cDNA is under the regulation of the IE cytomegalovirus promoter region and GST-IRF-1 and GST-IRF-3 fusion plasmids were described previously (20Au W.-C.

The GST-IRF-3(133) fusion plasmid consists of the 5′-DNA fragment that codes for the first 133 amino acids of IRF-3 cloned into pGEX2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The plasmids containing the various lengths of the IFNA4 promoter regions inserted 5′ of the CAT gene were described previously (17Raj N.B.K. Israeli R. Kellum M. Pitha P.M. J. Biol.

The IRF-1/p65, IRF-2/p65, and IRF-3/p65 plasmids encode the amino-terminal portion of the indicated IRF protein (1–204 aa, IRF-1; 1–133 aa, IRF-3) fused to the carboxyl-terminal transactivating domain of RelA(p65) (397–550 aa) (48Lin R. Mustafa A. Nguyen H. Gewert D. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17542-17549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The IFNB-CAT and TH-CAT plasmids were described previously (13Leblanc J.F. Cohen L. Rodrigues M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3987-3993Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The GST-IRF-1 and IRF-3 fusion proteins were purified from bacterial lysates by affinity chromatography on a glutathione-agarose column (Sigma). The indicated amounts of purified GST-IRF-3 (full-length or 133 aa) fusion proteins were preincubated for 10 min in a total volume of 20 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 62 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)). The extracts were then incubated with the respective32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the different regions of the IFNA4 promoter for 15 min at room temperature. Protein-DNA complexes were then resolved in a nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel. The following IE probes were used in these experiments: WT, GAGTGAAGTAAAGAAAGTGAAAAGAGAATTGGAAAG; 92, GAGTGAAGTAAAGAAAGTAAAAAGAGAATTGGAAAG; 94, GAGTGAAGTAAAGAAAATGAAAAGAGAATTGGAAAG; 87, GAGTGAAGTAAAGAAAGTGAAAAAAGAATTGGAAAG; 103, GAGTGAAATAAAGAAAGTGAAAAGAGAATTGGAAAG; 90, GAGTGAAGTAAAGAAAGTGAGAAGAGAATTGGAAAG; 92/87, GAGTGAAGTAAAGAAAGTAAAAAAAGAATTGGAAAG.

The amino-terminal region of IRF-3 shows a high degree of homology to IRF-1 and IRF-2 (Fig. 1 A). Au et al. (49Au W.-C. Raj N.B.K. Pine R. Pitha P.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2877-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) showed that IRF-1 is an effective activator of the IFNA4 promoter in transient cotransfection assays, whereas IRF-2 inhibits the IRF-1-mediated activation (14Garoufalis E. Kwan I. Lin R. Mustafa A. Pepin N. Roulston A. Lacoste J. Hiscott J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4707-4715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have analyzed whether IRF-3 plays any role in the regulation of the IFNA4 promoter. The IFNA4 promoter contains an IRF-1 binding sites in its inducible region (IE) (Fig. 1B) and additional IRF-1-like sites can be located in the upstream region of this promoter. Human 293 cells were cotransfected with murine IFNA(−464)-CAT reporter plasmid and IRF-1 or IRF-3 (Fig. 2). Results of the transient transfection showed that IRF-1 is an effective transactivator as shown previously (20Au W.-C. Su Y. Raj N.B.K. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24032-24040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas IRF-3 does not transactivate the IFNA promoter. Next, we wanted to determine whether IRF-3 modulates the IRF-1-mediated transactivation of this promoter. Cotransfection of IRF-1 and IRF-3 showed that IRF-3 inhibited IRF-1-mediated activation of IFNA promoter in a concentration-dependent manner. At the ratio of IRF-3 to IRF-1 of 2:1, the activation was reduced by 50%. The next question was if IRF-3-mediated inhibition of IFNA was through competition for the same binding site or due to protein-protein interaction as shown with ICSBP and IRF-1 (34Nelson N. Marks S. Driggers P.H. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 588-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined whether variants of IRF-3 with carboxyl-terminal deletions would also be inhibitory. Since proline-rich regions are often involved in protein-protein interaction, we also cotransfected IRF-1 with IRF-3 that had its proline-rich region deleted (Fig. 3). However, the proline-deleted form of IRF-3 could still inhibit IRF-1 activation of IFNA promoter, indicating that the proline-rich region of IRF-3 did not play any role in the observed inhibition. Plasmids encoding the truncated forms of the IRF-3 protein (327 and 240 aa) were also potent inhibitors of IRF-1 activity. These data suggest that IRF-3 and IRF-1 compete for the same or overlapping binding site on the IFNA promoter and that the truncated proteins may bind more strongly than the full-length IRF-3.Figure 2Modulation of the IFNA4 promoter by IRF-3, IRF-1, and mutants of IRF-3. 293 cells were cotransfected with 2.5 μg of IFNA4-CAT plasmid and 5 μg of the indicated expression plasmids IRF-3, IRF-3dPRo, IRF-3(327), IRF-2(244), except IRF-1, for which 2.5 μg was used. Cultures were harvested 48 h after transfection and assayed for CAT activity. The data from IRF-3dPro, IRF-3(327), and IRF-3(244) are not shown, but they exhibited the same low level of activation as wild-type IRF-3. Standard deviations are shown by the T-bars.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3Modulation of the IFNA4 promoter and its deleted mutants by IRF-3, IRF-1, and their chimeric fusion proteins. 293 cells were cotransfected with 2.5 μg of the different IFNA4-CAT plasmids and 5 μg of the indicated expression plasmids, IRF-3, IRF-1, IRF-3/p65, and IRF-1/p65. Cultures were harvested 48 h after transfection and assayed for CAT activity. The chimeric fusion plasmids have the amino-terminal DNA binding domain of IRF-3 or IRF-1 fused to the carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain of p65. Standard deviations are indicated by the T-bars.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Since IRF-3 could not transactivate the IFNA4-CAT promoter in 293 cells, we wanted to determine if this was a result of weak binding or the inability to transactivate this promoter in 293 cells. Therefore, a plasmid encoding a chimeric protein containing the amino-terminal binding domain of IRF-3 (1–133 aa) and the carboxyl-terminal transactivating domain of RelA(p65) (397–550 aa) was generated. 293 cells were cotransfected with IFNA4-CAT and the chimeric fusion protein IRF-3/p65 or with the previously described chimeric plasmid IRF-1/p65 used as a positive control (48Lin R. Mustafa A. Nguyen H. Gewert D. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17542-17549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The levels of transactivation show that IRF-1/p65 and IRF-3/p65 chimeric fusion proteins were equally effective transactivators of the full-length IFNA(−464) promoter (Fig. 3), indicating that IRF-3 does bind but does not transactivate the IFNA4 promoter. In contrast to the IRF-3/p65 plasmids, cotransfection of IRF-3 and p65 plasmids in transcould not transactivate the IFNA promoter (data not shown). Since there is no obvious NF-kB binding site in IFNA promoters, the inability of p65 to cooperate with IRF-3 in trans further supports the idea that NF-kB binding does not play a role in the activation of the IFNA4 promoter. Transfection of the chimeric fusion plasmids with a series of IFNA promoter deletions resulted in a gradual reduction in reporter gene transactivation, suggesting the presence of multiple IRF-1 and IRF-3 binding sites in the upstream (−464) region of the IFNA promoter, which may act in a cooperative manner. We previously found that in L929 cells transfection of IRF-3 alone did not activate the IFNA promoter, but it enhanced NDV-induced activation (45Au W.-C. Moore P.A. Lowther W. Juang Y.-T. Pitha P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11657-11661Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). To determine whether IRF-3 also cooperates with NDV in 293 cells, the cells were cotransfected with IFNA4-CAT, IRF-3, or IRF-1 and infected with NDV. As shown in Fig. 4, NDV induces the IFNA promoter effectively, but the induction is inhibited in the presence of IRF-3. In contrast, combination of IRF-1 with the viral infection shows an additive effect on the activity of the IFNA4 promoter as previously shown by Au et al. (49Au W.-C. Raj N.B.K. Pine R. Pitha P.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2877-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The VRE of IFNB promoter contains two IRF binding sites (PRDI and PRDIII) and an NF-kB binding site (PRDII). To examine the effect of IRF-3 on the activity of IFNB promoter, we used the IFNB-CAT plasmid, which contains the IFNB promoter (−281 to +19) inserted in front of the CAT gene (Fig. 5 A). In a transient transfection assay, overexpression of IRF-1 and IRF-3 did not transactivate the IFNB-CAT promoter in 293 cells, while a slight activation of this promoter was seen upon cotransfection with RelA(p65) expression plasmid. When IRF-1 and IRF-3 expressing plasmids were cotransfected together with the RelA(p65) expression plasmid (intrans), transactivation of the IFNB promoter was observed (13- and 8-fold, respectively), demonstrating that IRF-3 and IRF-1 can synergize with p65 and activate transcriptional activity (2-fold) of the IFNB promoter. The chimeric fusion protein IRF-1/p65 did not significantly transactivate the IFNB promoter. However, the IRF-3/p65 chimeric fusion protein was a strong transactivator (16-fold), suggesting that IRF-3/p65 is able to bypass the requirement for cooperation between NF"

Transcriptional activation by the signal transducer and activator of transcription–1 (STAT1) protein requires the C/H3 domain in CBP, which is the primary target of E1A inhibition. Here it was found that the C/H3 domain is not required for retinoic acid receptor (RAR) function, nor is it involved in E1A inhibition. Instead, E1A inhibits RAR function by preventing the assembly of CBP–nuclear receptor coactivator complexes, revealing differences in required CBP domains for transcriptional activation by RAR and STAT1."

Here, in contrast to expectations, Cp was shown to increase iron uptake by HepG2 cells, increasing the apparent affinity for the substrate by three times. Consistent with its role in iron uptake, Cp synthesis was regulated by iron supply and was increased four- to fivefold after iron depletion. Unlike other iron controllers that are posttranscriptionally regulated, Cp synthesis was transcriptionally regulated. Thus, iron-deficient cells could increase Cp synthesis to maintain intracellular iron homeostasis, so that defects would lead to global accumulation of iron in tissues."

https://openalex.org/W2056358535,"We examined downstream signaling events that followed the exposure of PC12 cells to extracellular ATP and UTP, and we compared the effects of these P2 receptor agonists with those of growth factors and other stimuli. Based on early findings, we focused particular attention on the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway. ATP and/or UTP produced increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins, including p42 MAP (ERK2) kinase, related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase (RAFTK) (PYK2, CAKβ), focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Shc, and protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ). MAP (ERK2) kinase activity (quantified by substrate phosphorylation) was increased by UTP, ATP, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, ionomycin, and growth factors. UTP and ATP were equipotent (EC50 ∼25 μm) in stimulating MAP kinase activity, suggesting that these effects were mediated via the Gi-linked P2Y2 (P2U) receptor. Consistent with this, the UTP- and ATP-promoted activation of MAP kinase was diminished in pertussis toxin-treated cells. Treatment of cells with pertussis toxin also reduced both the UTP-dependent increases in intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i) and the tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK. Similarly, when [Ca2+]i elevation was prevented using BAPTA and EGTA, the activation of MAP kinase by UTP and ionomycin was blocked, and the tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK was reduced. The UTP-promoted increase in MAP kinase activity was partially reduced in cells in which PKC was down-regulated, suggesting that both PKC-dependent and PKC-independent pathways were involved. PKCδ, which increases MAP kinase activity in some systems, became tyrosine-phosphorylated within 15 s of exposure of cells to ATP or UTP; but epidermal growth factor, nerve growth factor, and insulin had little effect. UTP also promoted the association of Shc with Grb2. These results suggest that the P2Y2 receptor-initiated activation of MAP kinase was dependent on the elevation of [Ca2+]i, involved the recruitment of Shc and Grb2, and was mediated by RAFTK and PKC.

P2-type purinoceptors constitute a diverse set of proteins that are linked by their common ability to bind extracellular ATP and elicit an increase in intracellular Ca2+ and other ions. ATP is a neurotransmitter or co-transmitter in some systems (1Burnstock G. Bolis R.W.S.a. L. Cell Membrane Receptors for Drugs and Hormones.

Previously, classifications of receptor subtypes were based on pharmacological hierarchies of the responses to ATP analogs (4Gordon J.L. Biochem.

The P2 subclassifications have been reorganized based on recent molecular biology approaches and now enfold more than a dozen types of P2 receptors into a family of two main receptor types: P2X and P2Ypurinoceptors. P2X receptors are ligand-gated ion channels, and P2Y receptors are seven transmembrane proteins that are GTP-dependent protein (G-protein) 1The abbreviations used are: G-protein, GTP-dependent protein; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; [Ca2+]i, intracellular calcium ion concentration; PKC, protein kinase C; NGF, nerve growth factor; RAFTK, related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; EGF, epidermal growth factor; P-Tyr, phosphotyrosine; PTX, pertussis toxin; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N, N, N′, N′-tetraacetic acid; MPB, myelin basic protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; BzATP, 3-O-(4′- benzoyl)-benzoyl-ATP. -coupled receptors (6Abbracchio M.P.

In preliminary studies we observed that ATP and UTP produced alterations in the tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins in PC12 cells, including one similar in mass to mitogen-activated protein (MAP) (p42 ERK) kinase, suggesting the involvement of the P2Y2 receptor in various signal transduction events. This receptor is a 53-kDa protein (8Lustig K.D. Shiau A.K. Brake A.J. Julius D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5113-5117Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) that is linked by a heterotrimeric G-protein to phospholipase C, and UTP promotes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which activate protein kinase C (PKC) and elevate the intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i), respectively. The P2Y2 receptor has been postulated to be activated by the physiological release of intracellular ATP from cells, and thus ATP may act as an autocrine or paracrine factor (9Schwiebert E.M. Flotte T.R. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 1063-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 10Hwang T.-H. Schwiebert E.M. Guggino W.B. Am. J.

However, signaling molecules that are downstream of the P2Y2 and other P2 receptors have not been characterized as well as those activated by growth factors. In the present study we focused attention on several proteins, particularly those involved in the MAP kinase cascade, to determine which signaling molecules were stimulated by activation of the P2Y2 receptor by ATP and UTP. In addition, we compared the effects of extracellular nucleotides and growth factors on PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation. PKCδ, a Ca2+-insensitive member of the PKC family of proteins, is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to various stimuli. These include the activation of platelet-derived growth factor receptors in NIH3T3 and 32D cells (12Li W. Yu J.-C. Michieli P. Beeler J.F. Ellmore N. Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6727-6735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), muscarinic and substance P receptors in freshly isolated parotid acinar cells (13Soltoff S.P. Toker A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13490-13495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and the transformation of cells with the oncogenic Ras protein (14Denning M.F. Dlugosz A.A. Howett M.K. Yuspa S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26079-26081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In 32D cells, a murine myeloid progenitor cell line, the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ was associated with cell differentiation (13Soltoff S.P. Toker A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13490-13495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, as reported here, we find that nerve growth factor (NGF), which promotes differentiation (neurite outgrowth) in PC12 cells, did not promote the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ; in contrast, the activation of the P2Y2 receptor was much more effective in promoting this phosphorylation. Our results indicate that MAP (p42 ERK) kinase activity was increased by UTP by a mechanism distinct from that of growth factors. MAP kinase activation by UTP was correlated with the tyrosine phosphorylation of related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase (RAFTK), a protein that is upstream of MAP kinase, and conditions that reduced the tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK also reduced the activation of MAP kinase by UTP. The tyrosine phosphorylation of p42 MAP kinase, PKCδ, RAFTK, and other proteins in cells treated with ATP and UTP indicates that stimulation of the P2Y2 receptor promotes the activation of multiple signaling molecules and demonstrates that tyrosine phosphorylation is involved in mediating signal transduction events initiated by the activation of this G-protein-coupled receptor.

Pertussis toxin (PTX; product 180) was purchased from List Biological Laboratories, Inc. (Campbell, CA). PC12 cells were grown in 100-mm-diameter dishes at 37 °C in a mixture of 95% air and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% calf serum and 5% horse serum. Cells were used at or near confluence. In all experiments, cells were maintained overnight in low serum medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 0.05% calf serum, 0.05% horse serum). Cells were exposed to stimuli by exchanging this medium with medium containing stimuli or vehicle. Cells in which PKC was down-regulated were exposed to 1 μm PMA or vehicle (0.06% dimethyl sulfoxide) overnight (∼16 h). In some experiments cells were exposed to PTX (100 ng/ml) or vehicle (0.1 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0; NaCl, 0.5 mm) overnight (∼16 h). In experiments in which elevations in intracellular calcium elevation were blocked, serum-starved cells were exposed to 10 μm BAPTA or vehicle (0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide) for 1 h and then switched to low serum medium ± 5 mm EGTA ± stimuli or vehicle for 5 min. After cells were exposed to a stimulatory agent for the designated time, the cells were washed twice with an ice-cold buffered saline solution (137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris base, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm vanadate, pH 7.5) and were lysed in lysis buffer (137 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris base, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) containing the following phosphatase and protease inhibitors: 1 mm vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmZnCl2, 4.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mg/ml NaF, 2 mg/ml β-glycerophosphate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. The lysates were vortexed thoroughly and centrifuged at 16,000 × g (Eppendorf 5414 microcentrifuge). The cleared supernatants were transferred to fresh microcentrifuge tubes. A portion (5–10% of the volume) of the lysate was removed and combined with an equal volume of 2 × sample buffer (62.5 mmTris, pH 6.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 6.25% (v/v) SDS, 0.72 nβ-mercaptoethanol, and bromphenol blue for color). The remainder was incubated at 4 °C for 3 h or overnight with anti-PKCδ (1–2 μg/ml), anti-ERK2 (1 μg/ml), polyclonal anti-Shc (1 μg/ml), anti-RAFTK (5 μl), or anti-P-Tyr antibody (∼6 μg/ml), plus protein G-Sepharose (4 mg/ml) with the anti-RAFTK antibody and protein A-Sepharose (4 mg/ml) with the other antibodies. At the end of the incubation, the immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 15.7 mmNaH2PO4, 1.47 mmKH2PO4, 2.68 mm KCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4), twice in 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5, and 0.5m LiCl, and two times in TNE (10 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5). All wash solutions contained 0.2 mm vanadate. The majority of the TNE was removed, the remaining volume was diluted with an equal volume of 2 × sample buffer, and the samples were boiled for 5–10 min. The immunoprecipitated proteins and the lysate fractions were subjected to electrophoresis or stored at −80 °C before electrophoresis. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis on an SDS-polyacrylamide separating gel with a 3% stacking gel. The separating gel was 12% for anti-Shc immunoprecipitates, and 7% for all others. Proteins were transferred to 0.2-μm pore size nitrocellulose filters, and the filters were blocked with TBS (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl) and 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 1 h. The filters were washed in TTBS (TBS and 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20) three times. The nitrocellulose filters were exposed to blotting antibodies in TTBS and 1% bovine serum albumin for ∼16 h at 4 °C. The filters were washed three times in TTBS and exposed to anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (Boehringer Mannheim) at a 1:10,000 dilution in TTBS and 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. All washes and exposure to the secondary antibody were performed at room temperature. Filters were washed three times with TTBS and twice with TBS and were visualized on x-ray film (Kodak) using a chemiluminescence system (Amersham or NEN Life Science Products). In some experiments, the filters were stripped of antibodies by exposing them to 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol, and 2% (w/v) SDS at 70 °C for 40 min. The stripped filters were washed several times in TTBS, once in TBS, blocked with TBS and 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, and reprobed with antibody overnight. Blots were then treated as described above. ERK2 was immunoprecipitated from PC12 cells by incubating cleared lysates with anti-ERK2 antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads for 3–4 h (see above). The immunoprecipitates were washed two times with RIPA buffer containing 1 mm vanadate and two times with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2). Immunoprecipitates were resuspended in a final volume of 50 μl of kinase buffer containing myelin basic protein (MBP) (200 μg/ml kinase buffer), and the kinase assay was initiated with the addition of 40 μm ATP plus [32P]ATP (1 μCi). After 30 min, in some experiments 20 μl of the supernatant was removed and spotted onto p81 Whatman paper. An identical volume of supernatant was collected and spotted from a kinase mixture prepared in the absence of immunoprecipitated proteins as a control, and this background value of radioactivity was subtracted from all samples. Unreacted [32P]ATP was removed by rinsing the p81 papers five times with 0.22 m phosphoric acid, and the phosphorylated MBP on each p81 paper was quantified by scintillation counting. In other experiments the supernatant was added to an equal volume of 2 × sample buffer, boiled, and subjected to SDS-PAGE using a 15% separating gel. The phosphorylated MBP was quantified using a molecular imager system (Bio-Rad GS-363). Similar results were obtained using the two methods of MAP kinase quantification. PC12 cells were suspended in a physiological salt solution containing 2 μm fura-2 acetoxymethylester and 10 μm probenecid in a physiological salt solution for 50 min, as reported previously for other cells (16Soltoff S.P. McMillian M. Cantley L.C. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Talamo B.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 93: 285-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The cells were washed twice, and [Ca2+]i was monitored at room temperature in a SPEX FluoroMax-2 spectrofluorometer. [Ca2+]i was quantified from the fluorometric ratio emitted at 510 nm from dual wavelength excitation at 340 and 380 nm. Immunoblots similar to those shown in the figures were obtained in two or more independent experiments. The numbers (n) of independent assays of ERK2 activity were as noted on the figures or in the text. Analysis of the tyrosine phosphorylation pattern of cells treated with UTP, ATP, and PMA indicated that multiple proteins were phosphorylated after various lengths of exposure to ATP and UTP (Fig. 1). These included proteins at the following apparent molecular masses (and the time of peak tyrosine phosphorylation): ∼159 kDa (UTP or ATP for 1 min), ∼102 kDa and ∼90 kDa (ATP or UTP for 1 or 5 min), ∼76 kDa (UTP or PMA for 5 min), ∼63 and ∼67 kDa (UTP or ATP for 1 min), ∼49 kDa (UTP or ATP for 1 min), ∼40 kDa and ∼44 kDa (UTP and PMA for 5 min). Thus, there were distinct proteins that exhibited different peak times in tyrosine phosphorylation when exposed to P2Y2 agonists or PMA. Several proteins were identified by reprobing the blots with antibodies to known proteins of similar size. The ∼40- and ∼44-kDa proteins co-localized with the MAP kinases ERK2 and ERK1 (not shown), respectively, which are proteins of 42 and 44 kDa. This suggested that activation of the P2Y2 (P2U) receptor activated MAP kinase and affected other signaling proteins in these cells. Additional experiments were performed to confirm that MAP kinase activity was increased by activation of the P2Y2 receptor. In vitro phosphorylation assays were performed on ERK2 kinase immunoprecipitates using MBP as a substrate (see “Materials and Methods”). MAP kinase activity was increased in cells exposed to UTP (100 μm) or ATP (100 μm) for 5 min (Fig. 2 A). This period of time (5 min) was one at which there appeared to be a readily detectable increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of MAP kinase promoted by these stimuli (Fig. 1). In experiments in which the effects of UTP (100 μm) and ATP (100 μm) were both measured after a 5-min exposure, the activation of MAP kinase by UTP was 67.0 ± 9.0% (10Hwang T.-H. Schwiebert E.M. Guggino W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1611-C1623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as large as that produced by ATP, consistent with the ability of either UTP or ATP to bind to and activate the P2Y2 receptor. There were negligible increases in MAP kinase activity in cells treated with UTP (100 μm) for 1 min. PMA, EGF, NGF, and the calcium ionophore ionomycin also produced large increases in MAP kinase activity after a 5-min exposure (Fig. 2 A), as reported by others. The concentration dependences of ATP and UTP on MAP kinase activity also were examined. Although the absolute magnitudes of MAP kinase activities were different for the two nucleotides at each concentration, the relative effects of different concentrations of each nucleotide were very similar, and the EC50 value was ∼25 μm for both ATP and UTP (Fig. 2 B). This is consistent with the stimulatory effects of ATP and UTP on MAP kinase being caused by the activation of a P2Y2 receptor. The activation of MAP kinase by UTP and ATP was reduced by about 40% in PTX-treated cells (Fig. 3). In contrast, the basal MAP kinase activity and the activation of MAP kinase by EGF and ionomycin were not significantly affected by PTX treatment. These results are consistent with the P2Y2receptor being coupled to Gi, a PTX-sensitive G-protein, and suggest that the activation of MAP kinase by UTP and ATP is initiated by the activation of this receptor. Because UTP elevates [Ca2+]i in PC12 (17Barry V.A. Cheek T.R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 451-462PubMed Google Scholar) and other cells (for review, see Ref. 5Dubyak G.R. El-Moatassim C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C577-C606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and calcium ionophores activate MAP kinase in PC12 (18Rosen L.B. Ginty D.D. Weber M.J. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1207-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) and other cells, we examined whether the UTP-dependent activation of MAP kinase was dependent on an elevation of [Ca2+]i. To block the elevation of [Ca2+]i, PC12 cells were loaded with the calcium chelator BAPTA, and extracellular calcium was depleted by the addition of EGTA to the medium. These conditions reduced the activation of MAP kinase by UTP and ionomycin to near basal levels, but the activation of MAP kinase by EGF was not affected significantly (Fig. 4). Treatment of cells with BAPTA/EGTA also blocked the tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK2 and ERK1 by UTP and ionomycin but not by EGF (not shown). These results indicated that the elevation of [Ca2+]i mediated the activation of MAP kinase by UTP and ionomycin but not by EGF. We also examined the effects of PTX on alterations of [Ca2+]i by different stimuli. The elevation of [Ca2+]i by 100 μm UTP was reduced by 50% in PTX-treated PC12 cells compared with control cells (not shown), consistent with the coupling of Gi between the P2Y2 receptor and phospholipase C. In contrast, PTX did not affect the increase in [Ca2+]i which was produced by 10−8m bradykinin (not shown). Along with the BAPTA/EGTA data presented in Fig. 4, these results suggest that an increase in [Ca2+]i is upstream of the the P2Y2 receptor-initiated activation of MAP kinase. RAFTK (also called PYK2 and CAKβ), is a protein tyrosine kinase that can couple G-protein-linked receptors to the MAP kinase activation cascade (19Avraham S. London R. Fu Y. Ota S. Hiregowdara D.

Kotani K. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21206-21219Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). PYK2/RAFTK is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues when [Ca2+]i is elevated or PKC is activated (20Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Mussachio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessenger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). Because the effects of UTP on MAP kinase activation require elevations in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 4), we examined the tyrosine phosphorylation status of RAFTK to determine if it might be involved in mediating the MAP kinase activation by UTP. In anti-RAFTK immunoprecipitations, RAFTK was phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in cells exposed to UTP, ionomycin, and EGF (Fig. 5 A), indicating that all three stimuli activated this kinase. In most experiments, the tyrosine phosphorylations initiated by UTP and ionomycin were much greater than those produced by EGF. The tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a tyrosine kinase that has substantial sequence homology to RAFTK (hence the name, Related AdhesionFocal Tyrosine Kinase) was also increased by UTP and EGF (Fig. 5 B). EGF produced a greater increase in FAK tyrosine phosphorylation than did UTP, and ionomycin decreased the phosphorylation to levels below that found under basal conditions. In cells loaded with BAPTA and exposed to EGTA, the tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK was decreased significantly in UTP- and ionomycin-treated cells but not in EGF-treated cells (Fig. 5 C). In multiple experiments, exposure of cells to BAPTA/EGTA blocked the ionomycin-promoted phosphorylation of RAFTK more completely than this treatment blocked the UTP-promoted phosphorylation. This was probably because both the elevation of [Ca2+]i and the activation of PKC contributed to the UTP-promoted phosphorylation of RAFTK, and BAPTA/EGTA blocked the former. These results are consistent with the involvement of RAFTK in the activation of MAP kinase by UTP and suggest that at least part of the response is caused by the UTP-promoted increase in [Ca2+]i. The UTP-promoted tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK was also decreased substantially in PTX-treated cells (see Fig. 7 D), consistent with the inhibitory effect of PTX on the elevation of [Ca2+]i (see above) and a role for [Ca2+]i upstream of RAFTK activation. These results suggest the involvement of RAFTK in the activation of MAP kinase by UTP and indicate that a large part of the MAP kinase activation is caused by the UTP-promoted increase in [Ca2+]i. To determine whether PKC was involved in the activation of MAP kinase by UTP, the response of cells to UTP was measured in cells in which PKC was down-regulated by treating the cells overnight with PMA. The exposure of PKC-down-regulated cells to UTP for 5 min produced a reduced but significant increase in activity (Fig. 6 A). In contrast, the basal MAP kinase activity was not affected significantly in PKC-down-regulated cells, and the effect of an acute addition of PMA was completely ineffective in stimulating MAP kinase activity. These findings suggest that MAP kinase activation via stimulation of the P2Y2 receptor involves both PKC-dependent and PKC-independent pathways. The effects of PKC down-regulation on the activation of MAP kinase were also observable by Western blotting the immunoprecipitated ERK2 proteins. In anti-ERK2 blots, ERK2 was identified as a doublet in cells treated with UTP, ATP, or PMA for 5 min (Fig. 6 B). In cells in which PKC was down-regulated by overnight treatment of the cells with PMA, the upper protein was observed in UTP-treated cells but not in cells acutely exposed to PMA. When these blots were stripped and reblotted using anti-P-Tyr antibody, a tyrosine-phosphorylated band co-migrated with the upper form of the doublet under all conditions in which the doublet was observed. The upper band was present in PKC-down-regulated cells that were subsequently treated with UTP, although this band was of lesser intensity than that seen in cells in which PKC was not down-regulated (Fig. 6 B, upper panel). These results were parallel to those obtained in the MAP kinase in vitro substrate phosphorylation assay (Fig. 6 A). Thus, UTP, ATP, and PMA all promote the tyrosine phosphorylation of MAP kinase which is dependent on the activation of PKC. Preliminary studies indicated that exposure of cells to ATP initiated the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ in PC12 cells. Because activation of the P2Y2 receptor by UTP and ATP increased MAP kinase activity in PC12 cells in a PKC-dependent manner (see above) and the overexpression of PKCδ increased MAP kinase activity (22Ueda Y. Hirai S. Osada S. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23512-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) and was associated with cell differentiation (12Li W. Yu J.-C. Michieli P. Beeler J.F. Ellmore N. Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6727-6735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in other cells, we examined further the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ to (a) determine whether the effects on PKCδ were mediated by the activation of a P2Y2receptor and (b) compare the effects of ATP with various growth factors including NGF, which causes PC12 cells to differentiate. Among a selection of P2 purinoceptor agonists, ATP and UTP promoted the largest increase in phosphorylation, and BzATP produced a much smaller increase, consistent with the nucleotide-dependent activation of the P2Y2receptor (Fig. 7 A). All three of these compounds will bind to P2Y2 receptors, although BzATP is not a very effective or potent agonist (23Erb L. Lustig K.D. Sullivan D.M. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10453-10459Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). α,β-methylene ATP and 2-methyl-thio-ATP, agonists of P2X receptors and other P2Y receptors, produced little alteration in tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, although P2X receptors have been found on PC12 cells (24Brake A.J. Wagenbach M.J. Julius D. Nature. 1994; 371: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar), activation of the P2Y2 receptor appeared to be selective for promoting the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ. Activation of the EGF and insulin receptors, two receptor tyrosine kinases that activate pathways involving the tyrosine phosphorylation of other proteins in these cells, did not produce significant changes in tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ (Fig. 7 A).

(1996) J. Biol. Chem.271, 29780–29784). However, a potential downstream effector of Rho that induces neurite retraction was not identified. Here we examined the morphological effect of p160 RhoA-binding kinase ROKα, a target for RhoA recently identified, on the nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells. Microinjection of the catalytic domain of ROKα rapidly induced neurite retraction similar to that induced by microinjection of a constitutively active Rho, RhoV14, whereas microinjection of the kinase-deficient catalytic domain of ROKα did not induce neurite retraction. This morphological change was observed even though C3 exoenzyme, which was known to inactivate Rho, had been preinjected. On the other hand, microinjection of the Rho-binding domain or the pleckstrin homology domain of ROKα inhibited the EP3 receptor-induced neurite retraction. These results demonstrate that ROKα induces neurite retraction acting downstream of Rho in neuronal cells.

Although this effect appears to be induced by the contractility of the actin-based cytoskeleton (24Jalink K. Coven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J.

We previously reported that the activation of prostaglandin EP3 receptor caused Rho-dependent neurite retraction in the NGF-differentiated PC12 cells expressing the EP3B receptor (27Katoh H. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29780-29784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), one of the EP3 receptor isoforms isolated from bovine adrenal medulla (28Namba T. Sugimoto Y.

In non-neuronal cells, the activation of EP3 receptor stimulates the Rho-mediated formation of stress fibers (29Hasegawa H. Negishi M. Katoh H. Ichikawa A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), indicating that EP3 receptor is a potent activator of Rho in various cell types. In this report, we have examined the putative role of ROKα in the EP3 receptor-mediated neurite retraction in the NGF-differentiated PC12 cells. We show that ROKα is involved in the EP3 receptor-mediated neurite retraction and that the activation of ROKα is sufficient for inducing neurite retraction. M&B28767 was a generous gift from Dr. M. P. L. Caton of Rhone-Poulene Ltd. NGF 2.5S was purchased from Promega Corporation, and C. botulinum C3 exoenzyme was from Seikagaku Kogyo (Tokyo, Japan). The sources of the other materials are shown in the text. The coding region of human RhoA was generated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from HeLa cells using primers 5′-CTGGACTCGAATTCGTTGCCTGAGCAATGG-3′ and 5′-GCAAGATGAATTCTGATTTGTAATCTTAGG-3′. The PCR product was digested withEcoRI, cloned into the pBluescript KS(+), and completely sequenced. cDNAs for RhoAV14 and RhoAV14A37 were generated by PCR-mediated mutagenesis (30Ito W. Ishiguro H. Kurosawa Y. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 102: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), subcloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-4T-2 vector, and sequenced. Recombinant RhoAV14 and RhoAV14A37 were expressed as glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins inEscherichia coli, and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the method of Self and Hall (31Self A.J. Hall A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The sequence encoding ROKα containing the catalytic domain (CD-ROKα, amino acids 1–543), the Rho-binding domain (RBD-ROKα, amino acids 932–1065), and the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (PHD-ROKα, amino acids 1116–1379) were generated by reverse transcription-PCR from PC12 cells, using primers 5′-ATGAGCGGATCCCCGCCGACGGGGAAA-3′ and 5′-ACCTTCTGAATTCATATCTGAGAGCTCTGG-3′ for CD-ROKα, 5′-GACGGATCCAAAGAGAAGATCATGAAAGAGC-3′ and 5′-GTTGTGTGAATTCTTAACGTTCAG-3′ for RBD-ROKα, and 5′-TCGCAGGGATCCGCCTTGCATATTGG-3′ and 5′TCTTGTGGATGGAAGAATTCGATCACCTTC3′ for PHD-ROKα, respectively. The kinase-deficient mutant of CD-ROKα (CD-ROKαK112G) was generated by PCR-mediated mutagenesis. All PCR products for each domain of ROKα were cloned into the pCR2.1 vector and sequenced completely. The PCR products for RBD-ROKα and PHD-ROKα were subcloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-4T-2 vector, and recombinant proteins were expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads. The PCR products for CD-ROKα and CD-ROKαK112G were subcloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pAcG2T vector, and recombinant proteins were expressed as GST fusion proteins in Sf9 cells with BaculoGold™ system (PharMingen) and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the method of Matsui et al. (10Matsui T. Amano M. Yamamoto T. Chihara K. Nakafuku M. Ito M. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2208-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). All recombinant proteins were dialyzed with an injection buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mmdithiothreitol) at 4 °C overnight for microinjection. Protein concentration was determined by comparing with bovine serum albumin standards after electrophoresis on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The EP3B receptor-expressing PC12 cells (27Katoh H. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29780-29784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% horse serum, 4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.2 mg/ml streptomycin under humidified conditions in 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For microinjection, cells were seeded on poly-d-lysine-coated (Sigma) 35-mm dishes, which were marked with a cross to facilitate the localization of injected cells. After the cells had been differentiated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 50 ng/ml NGF and 20 μm indomethacin for 3 days, microinjection was performed using an IMM-188 microinjection apparatus (Narishige, Tokyo, Japan). During microinjection, the differentiated cells were maintained in Hepes-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, pH 7.4, at 37 °C. Cells were photographed at × 200 magnification under a phase contrast microscope. For the quantitative examination shown in Fig. 3, neurite-retracted cells were defined as the cells that retracted by more than 10% of their original length within 30 min of the addition of the agonist or of the microinjection of recombinant proteins. The percentages of neurite-retracted cells were calculated by counting at least 30 cells in the same field. Data were obtained from triplicate experiments. In our previous study, we obtained evidence that M&B28767, an EP3 agonist, induced neurite retraction in the EP3B receptor-expressing PC12 cells and that this morphological change was completely inhibited when the cells were microinjected with C3 exoenzyme, which ADP-ribosylates and inactivates Rho (22Aktories K. Weller U. Chhatwal G.S. FEBS Lett. 1987; 212: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 23Sekine A. Fujiwara M. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8602-8605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the EP3B receptor induced neurite retraction through the activation of Rho (27Katoh H. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29780-29784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To determine whether activation of Rho is sufficient for inducing neurite retraction in the PC12 cells, we microinjected a constitutively activated recombinant RhoA, RhoAV14 into the NGF-differentiated PC12 cells and examined its effect. As shown in Fig. 1 (C and D), microinjection of RhoV14 into the cytoplasm caused retraction of the neurites within 30 min. More than 70% of the injected cells retracted their neurites (Fig. 3). This morphological change was similar to that stimulated by M&B28767 (Fig. 1, A and B). The neurite-retracted cells by microinjection of RhoAV14 was not stained with trypan blue (data not shown), indicating that they did not undergo cell death. On the other hand, RhoAV14 containing a T37A substitution in the effector region, RhoAV14A37, had no effect on the differentiated cells after microinjection (Fig. 1, E and F, and Fig. 3), suggesting that this mutation blocked the interaction of Rho with its target to induce neurite retraction. This result also indicated that there were not any nonspecific effects due to the microinjection itself. Previous studies suggested that the generation of actin-based contractile forces was required for neurite retraction (24Jalink K. Coven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 26Jalink K. Eichholtz T. Postma F.R. Coven E.J. Moolenaar W.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 247-255PubMed Google Scholar). Among several targets of Rho, ROKα appears to participate in Rho-dependent contractile events, such as the formation of stress fibers (16Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukuta Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar) and the regulation of cytokinesis (18Kosako H. Amano M. Yanagida M. Tanebe K. Nishi Y. Kaibuchi K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10333-10336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). By Northern blot analysis, ROKα was expressed in the NGF-differentiated PC12 cells (data not shown). Therefore, we examined whether ROKα was involved in the Rho-mediated neurite retraction in the NGF-differentiated PC12 cells. ROKα contains the catalytic domain in its amino terminus, the coiled-coil domain, the Rho-binding domain, and the PH domain in its carboxyl terminus (9Leung T. Manser E. Tan L. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29051-29054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). It was recently shown that the truncation mutant of ROKα containing the catalytic domain displayed constitutive kinase activity without the addition of active form of Rho, whereas the Rho-binding domain and the PH domain of ROKα served as dominant negative forms of the kinase (16Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukuta Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). Based on these characters, we generated recombinant proteins containing these domains: the catalytic domain of ROKα (CD-ROKα, amino acids 1–543), the kinase-deficient mutant of CD-ROKα (CD-ROKαK112G), the Rho-binding domain of ROKα (RBD-ROKα, amino acids 932–1065), and the PH domain of ROKα (PHD-ROKα, amino acids 1116–1379). To examine the effects of these domains of ROKα on neurite retraction, we microinjected these recombinant proteins into the NGF-differentiated cells and analyzed their morphologies. After the cells had been microinjected with CD-ROKα, they rapidly retracted their neurites within 30 min (Fig. 2, A and B, and Fig. 3). This morphological change was similar to that induced by microinjection of RhoAV14. The neurite-retracted cells by microinjection of CD-ROKα was not stained with trypan blue (data not shown), indicating that they did not undergo cell death. On the other hand, microinjection of the kinase-deficient mutant of CD-ROKα mutant CD-ROKαK112G had no effect (Fig. 2, C and D, and Fig. 3), indicating that the kinase activity of CD-ROKα was required for inducing neurite retraction. When the cells were microinjected with C3 exoenzyme, the M&B28767-induced neurite retraction was completely inhibited (Fig. 2, E and F). However, the CD-ROKα-induced neurite retraction was not inhibited after the cells had been microinjected with C3 exoenzyme (Fig. 2, G and H), indicating that CD-ROKα acted downstream of Rho. Next we microinjected RBD-ROKα or PHD-ROKα, which served as dominant negative forms of ROKα, into the differentiated cells and examined each effect on the M&B28767-induced neurite retraction. When the cells had been microinjected with RBD-ROKα or PHD-ROKα, the M&B28767-induced neurite retraction was inhibited (Fig. 4). All the cells microinjected with RBD-ROKα or PHD-ROKα had no response to M&B28767. These results suggest that ROKα is involved in the EP3 receptor-mediated neurite retraction in the PC12 cells. Taken together, our results suggest that ROKα induces neurite retraction acting downstream of Rho in the NGF-differentiated PC12 cells. Recently, ROKα was shown to be involved in Rho-induced formation of stress fibers and focal adhesion in other cell types such as fibroblasts. However, the organization of stress fibers induced by constitutively active ROKα was apparently different from that induced by lysophosphatidic acid or constitutively active Rho (16Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukuta Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar), suggesting that additional signals were required for Rho-induced stress fiber formation. In this study, however, microinjection of CD-ROKα sufficiently induced neurite retraction similar to that induced by RhoV14 even though C3 exoenzyme had been preinjected, whereas CD-ROKαK112G failed to induce neurite retraction (Figs. 2 and 3), suggesting that the increase in the kinase activity of ROKα by Rho appears to be sufficient for inducing neurite retraction. Because myosin-binding subunits of myosin phosphatase and myosin light chain are known to be substrates for ROKα and activation of ROKα leads to phosphorylation and activation of myosin (14Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukuta Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar, 15Amano M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20246-20249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar), neurite retraction may be induced by ROKα-mediated regulation of myosin phosphorylation. In addition, it was recently reported that glial fibrillary acidic protein, an intermediate filament protein expressed in the cytoplasm of astroglia, was identified as another substrate for ROKα (18Kosako H. Amano M. Yanagida M. Tanebe K. Nishi Y. Kaibuchi K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10333-10336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Therefore, we will consider substrate(s) of this kinase for neurite retraction in future studies. Until now, we have obtained evidence that the activation of EP3B receptor, coupling to Rho activation, did not affect the NGF-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in the PC12 cells (data not shown), suggesting that the activation of Rho or ROKα did not inhibit the NGF-induced signaling to the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. To examine the direct effect of Rho or ROKα on the NGF-induced differentiation, we are currently establishing PC12 cell lines that express RhoAV14 or CD-ROKα under the control of an inducible promoter. As shown in Fig. 4, two fragments of ROKα, the Rho-binding domain and the PH domain, served as dominant negative forms of ROKα in the EP3 receptor-mediated neurite retraction, as reported for the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesion (16Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukuta Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). ROKα has been shown to be translocated to peripheral membranes upon transfection with RhoV14 (9Leung T. Manser E. Tan L. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29051-29054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Because PH domains are supposed to play a key role in localization of molecules to the specific target regions in the membranes, the PH domain of ROKα may localize this kinase at the specified region in response to the EP3 receptor-induced activation of Rho, and this translocation of ROKα to its target region seems to be essential for inducing neurite retraction. On the other hand, RBD-ROKα may block the interaction between endogenous Rho and ROKα. We also showed that RhoAV14A37, a mutant at the effector region, lost the ability to induce neurite retraction in the differentiated PC12 cells (Fig. 1, E and F, and Fig. 3). Indeed, RhoAV14 bound to the RBD-ROKα, but RhoAV14A37 did not (data not shown). This defect in binding to ROKα seems to be the reason for the inability of RhoAV14A37 to induce neurite retraction. In conclusion, we have here shown that ROKα is an essential component of Rho-mediated neurite retraction in neuronal cells. Considering that ROKα is enriched in the brain (16Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), ROKα may play a critical role in the regulation of neuronal cell morphology in the brain. However, many questions have not yet been elucidated in this field, for example how the G-protein coupled receptor activates Rho. Further investigations are necessary to understand Rho-mediated signal transduction in neuronal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2067124986,"The sphingomyelin signal transduction pathway is known to play a role in mediating the action of various cytokines. Here we examined the possible role of the sphingomyelin signaling pathway on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and cytokine-mediated production of NO and the expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS). Sphingomyelinase (SMase) treatment of astrocytes increased the cellular levels of ceramide without the induction of NO production. However, incubation of LPS or cytokine-stimulated astrocytes with SMase or by increasing intracellular ceramide by cell-permeable ceramide analogs (C2- or C6-ceramide) or inhibitor of ceramidase (N-oleoyl ethanolamine) led to a time- and dose-dependent increase in the production of NO. This increase in NO production was accompanied by an increase in iNOS activity, iNOS protein, and iNOS mRNA. Similar to astrocytes, SMase or ceramide analogs also stimulated the LPS- and cytokine-mediated expression of iNOS in the C6 glial cell line. Since activation of NF-κB is necessary for the induction of iNOS, we examined the effect of SMase and C2-ceramide on the activation of NF-κB. Although SMase or C2-ceramide alone was ineffective in activating NF-κB, both stimulated the LPS-mediated activation of NF-κB in LPS-activated astrocytes. Inhibition of ceramide and LPS-mediated induction of iNOS by antioxidant inhibitors of NF-κB (N-acetylcysteine and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate) suggest that the stimulatory effect of ceramide on the induction of iNOS is due to the stimulation of NF-κB activation and that cellular redox plays a role in the activation of NF-κB and induction of iNOS. Inhibition of LPS-mediated as well as LPS and ceramide-mediated induction of iNOS and activation of NF-κB by PD98059, a specific inhibitor of activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase (MEK), and FPT inhibitor II, a selective inhibitor of Ras farnesyl protein transferase, indicate that the Ras-MAP kinase pathway is involved in LPS-ceramide induced activation of NF-κB and induction of iNOS, and that ceramide-mediated signaling events probably converge into the LPS-modulated MAP kinase signaling pathway resulting in greater activation of NF-κB and iNOS induction. This study illustrates a novel role of the sphingomyelin-ceramide signaling pathway in stimulating the expression of iNOS via LPS- or cytokine-mediated activation of NF-κB in astrocytes.

The sphingomyelin pathway is a newly described signal transduction pathway mediating the action of several extracellular stimuli and leading to important biochemical and cellular responses (1Hannun Y.A.

These conclusions are primarily based on the ability of exogenous, cell-permeable, ceramide analogs and endogenous ceramide generated by sphingomyelin-ceramide signaling events specifically to cause cell differentiation and growth inhibition. Although the ceramide dependent pathway for signal transduction is not very well established so far, present knowledge indicates that a ceramide-mediated signal transduction pathway includes activation of a specific proline-directed Ser/Thr protein kinase (5Yao B.

Nitric oxide (NO), a product of iNOS, is a diffusible gas that plays a part in many physiological and diverse pathological conditions. At low concentration NO has been shown to play a role in neurotransmission and vasodilation while at higher concentration it is neurotoxic. This is of particular importance in demyelinating conditions (e.g. multiple sclerosis, experimental allergic encephalopathy, advanced HIV encephalitis, X-adrenoleukodystrophy) and in ischemia and traumatic injuries associated with infiltrating macrophages and the production of proinflammatory cytokines (11Koprowski H.

We report that SMase or cell-permeable ceramide analogs by themselves were unable to activate NF-κB and induce iNOS, however, SMase and ceramide markedly enhanced the LPS- and cytokine-mediated activation of NF-κB and induction of iNOS. Antioxidant inhibitors of NF-κB activation (N-acetyl-l-cysteine and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate) inhibited the LPS and ceramide-mediated induction of iNOS, indicating that ceramide stimulates the LPS-mediated induction of iNOS by stimulating the activation of NF-κB and that cellular redox plays a role in the activation of NF-κB and induction of iNOS. Inhibition of LPS- and ceramide-mediated activation of NF-κB and induction of iNOS by PD98059, an inhibitor of MAP kinase kinase, and FPT inhibitor II, an inhibitor of Ras farnesyl protein transferase, suggest that ceramide potentiates LPS-mediated MAP kinase signaling pathways to stimulate activation of NF-κB and iNOS expression. The ability of ceramides to potentiate the LPS- or cytokine-mediated activation of NF-κB activation and expression of iNOS and production of NO in astrocytes indicate that sphingomyelin-ceramide signaling events may play a role in inflammatory neuropathies associated with the induction of iNOS and production of NO. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a positive modulatory role in the regulation of iNOS expression by ceramides in a cell. Recombinant rat IFN-γ, DMEM/F-12, and fetal bovine serum were from Life Technologies, Inc. Human IL-1β was from Genzyme. Mouse recombinant TNF-α was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim, Germany. Sphingomyelinase (Staphylococcus aureus), LPS (Escherichia coli), NADPH, FAD, tetrahydrobiopterin, N-acetylcysteine, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, and Dowex 50W were from Sigma. C2- and C6-ceramides and PD98059 were purchased from Biomol. NG-Methyl-l-arginine, FPT inhibitor II, and antibodies against mouse macrophage iNOS were obtained from Calbiochem. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products.l-[2,3,4,5-H3]Arginine was from Amersham. NF-κB DNA-binding protein detection kit was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Astrocytes were prepared from rat cerebral tissue as described by McCarthy and DeVellis (14McCarthy K. DeVellis J. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (3378) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in DMEM/F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After 10 days of culture, astrocytes were separated from microglia and oligodendrocytes by shaking for 24 h in an orbital shaker at 240 rpm. To ensure the complete removal of all the oligodendrocytes and microglia before subculturing, the shaking was repeated twice after a gap of 1 or 2 days. Cells were trypsinized, subcultured, and stimulated with LPS or different cytokines in serum-free DMEM/F-12. C6 glial cells obtained from ATCC were also maintained and induced with different stimuli as above. Approximately 1.0 × 106cells were exposed to 1.0 μg/ml LPS or 1.0 μg/ml LPS with 100 milliunits/ml of bacterial SMase for different periods and lipids were extracted according to the method described by Welsh (15Welsh N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8307-8312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Ceramide content was quantified essentially according to Priess et al. (16Priess J. Loomis C.R. Bishop W.R. Stein R. Niedel J.E. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8597-8600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using diacylglycerol kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Briefly, dried lipids were solubilized in 20 μl of an octyl-β-d- glucoside/cardiolipin solution (7.5% octyl-β-d-glucoside, 5 mm cardiolipin in 1 mm DTPA) by sonication in a sonicator bath. The reaction was then carried out in a final volume of 100 μl containing the 20-μl sample solution, 50 mm imidazole HCl, pH 6.6, 50 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 6.6 μg of diacylglycerol kinase, and 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity of 1–5 × 105 cpm/nmol) for 30 min at room temperature. The labeled ceramide 1-phosphate was resolved with a solvent system consisting of methyl acetate, n-propanol, chloroform, methanol, 0.25% KCl in water:acetic acid (100:100:100:40:36:2). A standard sample of ceramide was phosphorylated under identical conditions and developed in parallel. Both standard and samples had identical RF value (0.46). Quantification of ceramide 1-phosphate was carried out by autoradiography and densitometric scanning using Imaging Densitometer (Model GS-670; Bio-Rad) and software provided with the instrument by the manufacturer. Values are expressed either as arbitrary units (absorbance) or as percent change. Synthesis of NO was determined by assaying of culture supernatants for nitrite, a stable reaction product of NO with molecular oxygen. Briefly, 400 μl of culture supernatant was allowed to react with 200 μl of Griess reagent (17Feinstein D.L. Galea E. Roberts S. Berquist H. Wang H. Reis D.J. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 18Pahan K. Namboodiri A.M.S. Sheikh F.G. Smith B.T. Singh I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7786-7791Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The optical density of the assay samples was measured spectrophotometrically at 570 nm. Fresh culture media served as the blank in all experiments. Nitrite concentrations were calculated from a standard curve derived from the reaction of NaNO2 in the assay. NOS activity was measured directly by production of l-[2,3,4,5-3H]citrulline from l-[2,3,4,5-3H]arginine (17Feinstein D.L. Galea E. Roberts S. Berquist H. Wang H. Reis D.J. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7786-7791Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In these experiments, 50 μl of astrocyte homogenate was incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.5 mm NADPH, 5 μm FAD, 5 μmtetrahydrobiopterin, and 12 μml-[2,3,4,5-3H]arginine (118 mCi/mmol) in a total volume of 200 μl. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 800 μl of ice-cold 20 mm HEPES, pH 5.5, followed by the addition of 2 ml of Dowex 50W equilibrated in the same buffer. The samples were then centrifuged and the concentration ofl-[3H]citrulline was determined in the supernatant by liquid scintillation counting. Protein was measured by the procedure of Bradford (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214435) Google Scholar). Following 24-h incubations in the presence or absence of different stimuli, astrocytes were scraped off, washed with Hank's buffer, and homogenized in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and the iNOS band was visualized by immunoblotting with antibodies against mouse macrophage iNOS and 125I-labeled protein A as described earlier (18Pahan K. Namboodiri A.M.S. Sheikh F.G. Smith B.T. Singh I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7786-7791Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Stimulated primary astrocytes were taken out from culture dishes directly by adding Ultraspec-II RNA reagent (Biotecx Laboratories Inc.) and total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's protocol. For Northern blot analyses, 20 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on 1.2% denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gels, electrotransferred to Hybond-Nylon Membrane (Amersham) and hybridized at 68 °C with 32P-labeled cDNA probe using ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH) as described by the manufacturer. The cDNA probe was made by polymerase chain reaction amplification using two primers (forward primer, 5′-CTCCTTCAAAGAGGCAAAAATA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CACTTCCTCCAGGATGTTGT-3′) (18Pahan K.

After hybridization, filters were washed two to three times in solution I (2 × SSC, 0.05% SDS) for 1 h at room temperature followed by solution II (0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS) at 50 °C for another hour. The membranes were then dried and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak). The same filters were stripped and rehybridized with probes for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The relative mRNA content for iNOS was measured after scanning the bands with a Bio-Rad (Model GS-670) imaging densitometer. For the measurement of gene transcription, nuclei were prepared and in vitrotranscriptional activity was measured with nuclei (25 × 106 nuclei per assay) using 30 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (400 Ci/mmol) as described by Caira et al. (21Caira F. Pacot C. Bardot O. Malki M.C. Latruffe N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, the filters were prehybridized in 1 ml of hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 1% SDS, 15% dextran sulfate, 1 × Denhardt's solution, 50 μg/ml heparin). Following 24 h of prehybridization in the above buffer, hybridization was carried out with the labeled RNAs (1.3 × 105 cpm) at 42 °C for 60 h to 3 μg of the immobilized plasmid pGEM-T as a control or to plasmids containing inserts of rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, rat actin, and human iNOS cDNAs. The filters were washed twice in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 42 °C and twice in 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min. Then the filters were treated with RNase buffer (300 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 40 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml RNase A, and 350 units/ml RNase T1) at 37 °C for 30 min and then in the same buffer without RNase for another 30 min and autoradiographed. Nuclear extracts from stimulated or unstimulated astrocytes (1 × 107 cells) were prepared using the method of Dignam et al. (22Dignam D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9149) Google Scholar) with slight modification. Cells were harvested, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin) containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 15 min on ice, vortexed vigorously for 15 s, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 s. The pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 40 μl of buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.42 mNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). After 30 min on ice, lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatants containing the nuclear proteins were diluted with 20 μl of modified buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05 mKCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and stored at −70 °C until further use. Nuclear extracts were used for the electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the NF-κB DNA-binding protein detection system kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Rat primary astrocytes were cultured in serum-free media with LPS and SMase, alone or in combination, for different times and the amount of ceramide was quantitated by the diacylglycerol kinase assay (16Priess J. Loomis C.R. Bishop W.R. Stein R. Niedel J.E. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8597-8600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LPS alone induced a significant increase in the ceramide content within 10–60 min of exposure (Fig. 1). Almost 2.5-fold increase in ceramide was observed after 30 min of exposure. Bacterial neutral SMase, the enzyme capable of degrading sphingomyelin to ceramide, alone also induced a marked generation of ceramide (8.0-fold after 10 min) demonstrating that under these experimental conditions SMase alone can degrade sphingomyelin and increase the level of ceramide to the same level as the combined effect of LPS and SMase. Rat primary astrocytes were cultured in serum-free media in the presence of LPS and SMase. The activity of iNOS was measured as production of nitrite, a soluble product of NO in the culture medium (Table I) and as conversion of arginine to citrulline (Fig. 2 B). It is evident from Table I that in astrocytes, LPS (1 μg/ml) induced the production of nitrite by more than 7-fold. BothNG-methyl-l-arginine, a competitive inhibitor of NOS, and arginase, an enzyme that degrades the substrate (l-arginine) for NOS, suppressed the LPS-mediated nitrite secretion suggesting that LPS-induced nitrite release in primary astrocytes is dependent on NOS-mediated arginine metabolism. SMase by itself was neither stimulatory nor inhibitory to nitrite production in astrocytes. However, SMase, when added with LPS, potently stimulated the LPS-mediated induction of nitrite production in astrocytes. Almost 3-fold stimulation was observed when SMase was used at a concentration of 100 or 200 milliunits/ml (Table I). Similar effects of SMase were also observed on cytokine-induced nitrite production in astrocytes (Fig. 3 A). Addition of SMase stimulated the TNF-α-, IL-1β-, or IFN-γ-induced nitrite production in astrocytes by 3–4-fold. Consistent with the production of nitrite, the formation of l-citrulline froml-arginine in an enzymatic assay with astrocyte homogenate was also stimulated approximately 3-fold by treatment of LPS- or cytokine-stimulated astrocytes with SMase (100 milliunits/ml) (Figs.2 B and 3 B). To understand the mechanism of the stimulatory effect of SMase on LPS- and/or cytokine-induced activation of iNOS in astrocytes, we examined the effect of SMase on the expression of iNOS protein and iNOS mRNA. Immunoblot analysis with antibodies against murine macrophage iNOS and Northern blot analysis for iNOS mRNA of LPS-stimulated astrocytes clearly showed that SMase enhanced the LPS-mediated induction of iNOS protein (Fig. 2 C) and mRNA (Fig. 2 D). To correlate the expression of iNOS with ceramide, we measured ceramide levels under these conditions. LPS, capable of inducing only modest generation of ceramide (2.5-fold after 30 min of incubation) (Fig. 2 A) induced the expression of iNOS and production of NO. In contrast, SMase (200 milliunits/ml) itself capable of inducing marked generation of ceramide (7.5-fold after 30 min of incubation) (Fig. 2 A) was ineffective in inducing the expression of iNOS or production of NO. However, increased ceramide level produced by SMase markedly stimulated LPS-mediated induction of iNOS and production of NO (Fig. 2). Similar stimulatory effects of SMase were also found on cytokine-induced expression of iNOS (Fig. 3). In primary astrocytes, TNF-α, IL-1β, or IFN-γ alone were able to induce the expression of iNOS and the addition of SMase along with cytokines stimulated the induction of iNOS expression.Table IEffect of SMase on arginine-dependent nitrite accumulation in LPS-stimulated rat primary astrocytesTreatmentsNitritenmol/mg/24 hControl3.2 ± 0.5LPS only30.1 ± 3.2LPS + arginase5.8 ± 1.2LPS +l-NMA6.1 ± 0.8SMase (200 milliunits/ml) only3.7 ± 0.7LPS + SMase (50 milliunits/ml)61.6 ± 5.9LPS + SMase (100 milliunits/ml)86.5 ± 7.3LPS + SMase (200 milliunits/ml)89.3 ± 6.9 Open table in a new tab Figure 3Effect of SMase on cytokine-induced production of NO and expression of iNOS in rat primary astrocytes.Cells incubated in serum-free DMEM/F-12 received 100 milliunits/ml SMase along with different cytokines (TNF-α, 100 ng/ml; IL-1β, 100 ng/ml; IFN-γ, 200 units/ml). After 24 h of incubation, concentration of nitrite was measured in supernatants (A) and activity of iNOS was assayed in cell homogenates (B) as mentioned under “Materials and Methods.” Data are mean ± S.D. of three different experiments.

To evaluate its effect on the expression of iNOS, the experiments described above for SMase studies were repeated with the cell-permeable C2- and C6-ceramide analogs. Similar to SMase, ceramide analogs alone did not induce the production of nitrite but addition of C2- or C6-ceramide to astrocytes along with LPS increased expression of iNOS mRNA, iNOS protein as well as production of NO (Fig. 4). This stimulatory effect peaked at 10 μm for C2- or C6-ceramide. To examine the specificity of ceramide, we studied the effect of C2-dihydroceramide, the inactive analog of C2-ceramide, on LPS-mediated production of NO. In contrast to C2-ceramide, C2-dihydroceramide was ineffective in stimulating the LPS-induced production of nitrite (Fig. 5). A 10 μm concentration of ceramide produced a maximal effect on LPS-induced production of NO, however, a higher concentration of ceramide (25 μm) was ineffective in inducing the production of NO.Figure 5Effect of C2-dihydroceramide on the LPS-mediated production of NO in rat primary astrocytes. Cells incubated in serum-free DMEM/F-12 received different concentrations of C2-ceramide and C2-dihydroceramide in the presence or absence of LPS (1.0 μg/ml). After 24 h of incubation, concentration of nitrite was measured in the supernatants as mentioned under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Oleoylethanolamine (OE), an inhibitor of ceramidase, the enzyme responsible for the catabolism of ceramide to sphingosine and fatty acid, has been reported to induce apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells (23Wiesner D.A. Dawson G. Glycoconjugate J. 1996; 13: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) because of the increased concentration of ceramide due to the inhibition of catabolism of ceramide (23Wiesner D.A. Dawson G. Glycoconjugate J. 1996; 13: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We examined the possible role of increased intracellular ceramide by the inhibition of ceramidase on the induction of iNOS mRNA, iNOS protein, and NO production. Treatment of astrocytes with OE 2 h before the addition of LPS stimulated the expression of iNOS mRNA, iNOS protein, and the production of NO (Fig. 4), supporting the conclusion that the increase in concentration of intracellular ceramides stimulates the expression of iNOS. The stimulatory effect of OE peaked after 100 μm (data not shown). However, similar to studies with SMase or exogenous ceramides, OE alone did not induce the expression of iNOS in astrocytes. To gain further insight into the mechanism of the stimulatory effect of SMase and ceramide on LPS- or cytokine-mediated expression of iNOS mRNA, we studied the influence of SMase and ceramide on the rate of iNOS gene transcription, as measured by nuclear run-on assays. Fig. 6shows that LPS induced the transcription of the iNOS gene in astrocytes, and addition of SMase (100 milliunits/ml) or C2-ceramide (10 μm) along with LPS stimulated LPS-induced transcription of the iNOS gene. These results clearly suggest that SMase and ceramide stimulate LPS-induced expression of iNOS mRNA, protein, and activity by stimulating transcription of the iNOS gene. Similar to primary astrocytes, SMase also stimulated LPS- and/or cytokine-induced production of nitrite as well as the expression of iNOS in rat C6 glial cells (Fig. 7).

We have previously shown that the SarA protein is required for optimal transcription of RNAII and RNAIII in the agr locus. To define the specific molecular interaction, we overexpressed SarA as a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein by cloning the 372-base pair (bp) sarA gene into the vector. The purified GST-SarA as well as cleaved SarA were able to bind specifically to the P2, P3, and the combined P2-P3 promoter fragments of agr in gel shift assays. Using monoclonal antibodies to SarA, we found that SarA is a part of the retarded protein-DNA complex as evidenced by the formation of a supershifted band. The SarA binding site on the agr promoter, mapped by DNase I footprinting assay, covered a 29-bp region between the P2 and P3 promoters devoid of any direct repeats. A synthetic 45-bp fragment encompassing the 29-bp sequence also bound the SarA protein in band shift assays. Serial in-frame deletion analysis of sarA revealed that, with the exception of 15 residues in the N terminus, almost all of SarA (residues 16–124) is essential for agr binding activity. Northern analysis confirmed that only the sar mutant clone containing a truncated sarA gene with a 15-residue deletion in the N terminus (SarA16–124) could activate agrtranscription to a level approaching that of the full-length counterpart (SarA1–124).

Staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen with many clinical manifestations (1Crossley K.B. Archer G.L. The Staphylococci in Human Disease. Churchill Livingston, New York1997Google Scholar). Infections due to this organism can range from minor wound infections to severe sepsis. The capacity of S. aureus to cause various infections is probably related to the fact that this organism has an amazing ability to respond to changing environments. The adaptive response is highly coordinated and is generally modulated by regulatory elements via signal transduction pathways. The regulatory elements, in turn, control the transcription of a wide variety of unlinked genes, many of which are involved in pathogenesis (2Waldvogel F.A. Mandell G.L. Douglas R.G.J. Bennett J.E.

Microbiol. 1996; 21: 1227-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The ensuing transcription of RNAII and RNAIII would lead to activation of exoprotein gene transcription (7Morfeldt E. Taylor D. von Gabain A. Arvidson S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4569-4577Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In contrast to the RNAIII-mediated control of exoprotein synthesis inagr, we recently reported that the SarA protein likely modulates α-hemolysin production in S. aureus (10Cheung A.L. Bayer M.G. Heinrichs J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3963-3971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transcriptional and deletion analyses indicated that the intact SarA protein is required for full agr expression (i.e.RNAII and RNAIII) in S. aureus (10Cheung A.L. Bayer M.G. Heinrichs J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3963-3971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we examined the binding of GST-SarA fusion protein as well as purified SarA to the agr promoters. Our results demonstrated that both of these proteins bind to the P2 and P3 promoters of agr in a dose- dependent fashion. The binding affinity of GST-SarA appears to be higher with the P2 than with the P3 promoter. DNase I footprinting analysis of SarA binding to the agrpromoter region revealed that the SarA binding site resides in a 29-bp sequence between the P2 and P3 promoter region (−73 to −101 upstream of the P2 transcription start). Interestingly, the binding site excludes the 7-bp consensus repeat (AGTTAAG) within the P2-P3 interpromoter region previously reported by Morfeldt et al. (11Morfeldt E. Tegmark K. Arvidson S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 1227-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). A labeled 45-bp DNA oligonucleotide probe encompassing the 29-bp binding site also bound the GST-SarA fusion protein in a gel retardation assay. In-frame deletion analysis of the SarA protein revealed that, with the exception of the 15 residues in the N terminus, almost all of the SarA protein (residues 16–124) is essential for binding activity to the agr promoter (P2-P3). Northern analysis also confirmed that only the sar mutant clones containing either the full-length SarA1–124 or the truncated form (SarA16–124) could activate RNAII and RNAIII transcription of the agr locus. Taken together, our data indicated that SarA is a DNA-binding protein with binding specificity to the interpromoter region between P2 and P3 of agr, thereby leading to activation of P2 (RNAII) and P3 (RNAIII) transcription. The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. Phage φ11 was used as the transducing phage for S. aureusstrains. CYGP, 0.3 GL, and tryptic soy broth media were used for the growth of S. aureus (4Cheung A.L. Koomey J.M. Butler C.A. Projan S.J. Fischetti V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Open table in a new tab The intact 372-bp sarA gene (13Cheung A.L. Projan S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4168-4172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using a plasmid template (pALC70) and primers containing restriction sites (XhoI and BamHI) to facilitate cloning. Likewise, sarA gene fragments coding for the truncated SarA with in-frame deletions in the N and C termini were amplified by PCR. PCR products representing assorted sarAfragments were digested with XhoI and BamHI and ligated into GST vector pGEX-4T-1 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Piscataway, NJ). The resulting plasmids containing the entire or truncatedsarA gene are listed in Table I. The GST-SarA fusion clones were verified by restriction digestion and DNA sequencing. Enhanced expression of various GST-SarA constructs was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) at 1 mm to a growing culture (30 °C) at anA600 of 0.7. Three h after induction, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min), resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (0.14 mNaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10.1 mmNa2HPO4, 1.8 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.3) and sonicated on ice. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 15 min), and the clarified supernatant was applied directly to the glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Pharmacia). The affinity purification procedure was conducted following the instruction of the manufacturer. For some assays, the recombinant fusion protein was cleaved with thrombin to yield the full-length SarA protein. Purified SarA and GST fusion proteins were detected by anti-SarA monoclonal antibody (see below) on immunoblots, and the purity was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Purified SarA protein or homogeneous GST-SarA fusion proteins were used for the gel shift and footprinting assays. Purified SarA protein was authenticated by determining the 15 residues at the N terminus with protein sequencing. This protein was used to immunize BALB/c × SJL/J (F1 cross) mice to obtain monoclonal antibodies as described (14Jones K.F. Khan S.A. Erickson B.W. Hollingshead S.A. Scott J.R. Fischetti V.A. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 1226-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Antibodies from limited dilutions were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with immobilized SarA protein. Monoclonal antibodies 1D1, 1F7, 3H2, and 8F3 were purified from culture supernatants as described (14Jones K.F. Khan S.A. Erickson B.W. Hollingshead S.A. Scott J.R. Fischetti V.A. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 1226-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To introduce in-frame deletions within the sarA coding region, site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the Stratagene Quick Change mutagenesis kit. A 1.7-kb fragment encompassing the entire sar locus was cloned into pBluescript (ALC559) to serve as a template for mutagenesis. Two complimentary oligonucleotide pairs, (5′-848AATAGGGAGGTTTTAAACATG868911GTCACTTATGCTGACAAATTA931-3′) (9Bayer M.G. Heinrichs J.H. Cheung A.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4563-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and (5′-846CAAATAGGGAGGTTTTAAACATG868941ATTAAAAAGGAATTTTCAATTAG963-3′) (9Bayer M.G. Heinrichs J.H. Cheung A.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4563-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), were designed for each mutagenesis (Table I). After constructing the mutations, the recombinant phagemid DNA was transformed into XL1-Blue competent cells (Strategene). The in-frame deletion withinsarA in pBluescript was confirmed by DNA sequencing. DNA fragments containing the mutations were then gel purified and ligated into shuttle vector pSPT181. Electroporation of S. aureusRN4220 with recombinant pSPT181 containing the mutated sarAgene within the sar locus was performed as described previously (15Schenk S. Laddaga R.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 94: 133-138Crossref Google Scholar). For transduction, phage φ11 was used to produce phage lysates of strain RN4220 containing the recombinant pSPT181 shuttle vector with sar fragments. The phage lysate was then used to infect the sar mutant ALC136 as described (4Cheung A.L. Koomey J.M. Butler C.A. Projan S.J. Fischetti V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6462-6466Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The presence of correct plasmids was confirmed by restriction mapping. Proteins were resolved and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes as described (16Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Anti-SarA monoclonal antibodies diluted 1:5,000 were allowed to incubate with the membrane for 1 h followed by another h of incubation with a 1:10,000 dilution of goat anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Immunoactive bands were detected as described (17Blake M.S. Johnston K.H. Russell-Jones G.J. Gotschlich E.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar). SeeBlue prestained protein standards (Novex, San Diego, CA) were used for molecular weight estimation. Overnight cultures of S. aureus were diluted 1:50 in CYGP and grown to late log (OD650 = 1.1), and postexponential (OD650 = 1.7) phases. The cells were pelleted and processed with a FastRNA isolation kit (BIO 101 Inc., Vista, CA) in combination with 0.1-mm-diameter sirconia-silica beads and a FastPrep reciprocating shaker (BIO 101 Inc.) as described (18Cheung A.L. Eberhardt K. Fischetti V.A. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 511-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Ten μg of each sample was electrophoresed through a 1.5% agarose, 0.66 mformaldehyde gel in MOPS running buffer (20 mm MOPS, 10 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.0). Blotting of RNA onto Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham Corp.) was performed with the Turboblotter alkaline transfer system (Schleicher & Schuell). For detection of specific transcripts, DNA probes were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the random primed method (Ready-To-Go labeling kit, Pharmacia) and hybridized under high stringency conditions. The blots were subsequently washed and autoradiographed. DNA fragments containing the agr P2 and P3 promoter region were amplified by PCR usingS. aureus chromosomal DNA as a template. Prior to PCR, one of these primers was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Pharmacia), and the PCR fragments were purified by ProbeQuant G-50 columns (Pharmacia). To confirm the fidelity of the PCR reactions, the PCR products were completely sequenced. The following PCR primers were used: 5′-ATCAACTATTTTCCATCACATCT-3′ (oligo 422) and 5′-TTACACCACTCTCCTCACT-3′ (oligo 178) for a 235-bp P2-P3 fragment (from nt 1539 to 1773) (3Kornblum J. Kreiswirth B. Projan S.J. Ross H. Novick R.P. Novick R.P. Molecular Biology of the Staphylococci. VCH Publishers, New York1990: 373-402Google Scholar); 5′-GTCGTTTTTTATTCTTAACTGT-3′ and oligo 178 for a 152-bp P2 fragment (from nt 1622 to 1773) (3Kornblum J. Kreiswirth B. Projan S.J. Ross H. Novick R.P. Novick R.P. Molecular Biology of the Staphylococci.

Projan S.J. Ross H. Novick R.P. Novick R.P. Molecular Biology of the Staphylococci. VCH Publishers, New York1990: 373-402Google Scholar); and 5′-AGTTAAGAATAAAAAACGAC-3′ and oligo 422 for a 103-bp DNA fragment (from nt 1539 to 1641) (3Kornblum J. Kreiswirth B. Projan S.J. Ross H. Novick R.P. Novick R.P. Molecular Biology of the Staphylococci. VCH Publishers, New York1990: 373-402Google Scholar). A 45-bp DNA fragment (5′- GTAAATTTTTTTATGTTAAAATATTAAATACAAATTACATTTAAC-3′) and its complementary strand located in the intergenic region between the agr P2 and P3 promoters were also synthesized. Protein samples were incubated with 5 × 103 cpm (0.3 ng) of end-labeled PCR fragments in the presence of 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia) in a final volume of 20 μl. Incubations were carried out on ice for 30 min in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Samples were resolved on 5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × Tris-borate-EDTA buffer (19Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning, a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis, gels were dried and autoradiographed. Binding reactions were performed as described for the gel mobility shift assay except that a total volume of 100 μl was used. DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim) (0.01 unit) was added and incubated for 2 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by adding 100 μl of freshly made stop solution (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2% (w/v) SDS, 10 mmEDTA, proteinase K at 0.4 μg/ml, and glycogen at 100 mg/ml). The reaction mixture was extracted with phenol/chloroform. DNA was ethanol-precipitated, washed with 70% ethanol, and resuspended in loading buffer (98% deionized formamide, 10 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.025% (w/v) xylene cyanol FF, and 0.025% (w/v) bromphenol blue). DNA was denatured at 95 °C for 3 min and run on a 6% sequencing gel. Chemical cleavage at purine (A+G) residues were performed by the standard method (19Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning, a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The intact 372-bp sarA gene was cloned in-frame into GST fusion vector pGEX-4T-1 and overproduced in E. coli DH5α. The expressed recombinant fusion protein contained a 26-kDa GST protein fragment followed by a thrombin cleavage site and the SarA protein. Soluble fraction of the cell lysate from E. coli that had been induced with IPTG was prepared and purified on a GST affinity column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The soluble crude extract and the purified protein were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the purified GST-SarA fusion protein (41.5 kDa) and the SarA protein (14.5 kDa) generated by cleavage with thrombin were essentially homogeneous. The identity of these proteins was confirmed by immunoblots with monoclonal antibody 1D1 raised against SarA (Fig. 1 B). These protein preparations were used in subsequent band shift and footprinting assays (see below). Indirect biochemical evidence with crude extracts from S. aureusmutant clones containing sar fragments from our laboratory (10Cheung A.L. Bayer M.G. Heinrichs J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3963-3971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Heinrichs J.H. Bayer M.G. Cheung A.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 418-423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that SarA may interact with the agr locus by binding to the P2 promoter. To examine further the interaction between SarA and agr promoter, purified recombinant GST-SarA and SarA from E. coli were used in band shift assays withagr P2 and P3 promoters. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, the purified GST-SarA fusion protein bound to the agr P2 and P3 promoters in a dose-dependent fashion, with ≥ 50% retardation for P2 and P3 promoter probes by adding 1 and 10 μg of the fusion protein, respectively. With the combined P2-P3 promoter fragment (Fig. 2 C), binding activity of GST-SarA appeared to be increased (≥50% band shift with 0.5 μg of protein). The estimated dissociation constant (Kd) for the P2 promoter (18 nm) was lower than its P3 (190 nm) counterpart, thus implying that SarA binds with higher affinity to the P2 than to the P3 agr promoter. Remarkably, the combined P2-P3 promoter has the highest affinity for the SarA protein (Kd = 6 nm). The addition of unlabeled P2-P3 fragment interfered with the formation of the binding complex between the labeled probe and the GST-SarA fusion protein (Fig. 2 C, lanes 7–12) while increasing concentrations of a 165-bp nifH2 promoter region from Methanosarcina barkeri or calf thymus DNA had no effect (data not shown). We also tested the binding of the full-length SarA (GST portion removed by thrombin digestion) to the agr P2-P3 promoter (Fig. 2 D). As anticipated, purified SarA was able to bind to the P2-P3 promoter, with the binding pattern similar to that of the fusion protein (Fig. 2, C and D). The data above indicated that recombinant SarA from S. aureus is capable of binding to the agr promoter. To show that SarA is truly a part of the retarded protein-DNA complex, we used four anti-SarA monoclonal antibodies (1D1, 1F7, 3H2, and 8F3) to detect its presence. By incubating these four anti-SarA monoclonal antibodies with the reaction mixture containing SarA and labeled P2-P3 probe, we discovered that they bound to the retarded SarA-DNA complex (Fig. 3) as evidenced by the formation of a supershifted complex in each instance (lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12). As a control, the addition of antibody alone without SarA did not produce any shifted band, suggesting that the supershifted band is not due to the binding of antibody to the agrpromoter probe (Fig. 3, lanes 4, 7, 10, and 13). Our band shift assays have shown that SarA binds specifically to the P2 and P3 promoter region of agr. To determine the binding site more precisely, we analyzed protein-DNA complexes by the DNase I protection assay (19Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning, a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Binding to both top and bottom strands was examined using PCR-amplified templates. When ≈50 μg of purified GST-SarA was used, a large region of protection was observed on both strands (Fig. 4, A and B). In both instances, the protected regions are identical and correspond to nt −73 to −101 upstream of the P2 transcription start site (−83 to −111 upstream of P3), covering a 29-bp region (Fig. 4 C). We also performed the footprinting experiments with purified SarA derived from thrombin-cleaved GST-SarA. The protection pattern is essentially the same (data not shown). The transcription starts between two agr promoters (P2 and P3) are separated by a 186-bp sequence containing several direct and inverted repeats. The upstream regions of P2 and P3 are very similar in that each contains duplications of the heptanucleotides 5′-AGTTAAG-3 (Fig. 4 C). These repeats have been suggested to be the binding site for a common regulatory protein, with SarA being a potential candidate (11Morfeldt E. Tegmark K. Arvidson S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 1227-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, our footprinting analysis indicated that the SarA protein binds to a 29-bp region located between the P2 and P3 promoters. This region does not contain the putative repeats. To confirm our footprinting result, we performed band shift assays with a labeled 45-bp oligonucleotide probe spanning the 29-bp SarA binding site. As shown in Fig. 5, the 45-bp DNA fragment was retarded by the GST-SarA fusion protein in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, a 103-bp fragment containing the repeats but not the SarA binding site failed to bind to the SarA protein (Fig. 5 C). These data strongly suggest that the direct repeats are not the binding site for SarA. To evaluate the specificity of this binding, we also performed a series of competition assays with combinations of labeled and unlabeled DNA. The results showed that the unlabeled 45-bp DNA was able to compete with labeled P2, P3, or 45-bp DNA fragments for the binding to the SarA protein (data not shown). To map the DNA-binding domain of SarA to the agr P2 and P3 promoters, we constructed an assortment of GST fusion proteins spanning full-length to truncated forms of SarA (Fig. 6 A). These constructs were expressed with IPTG induction and purified to homogeneity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Gel shift experiments were used to test interactions of these truncated fusion proteins with the agr promoter sequence (P2-P3) in an attempt to determine the minimal SarA protein sequence that can function as a DNA-binding protein (Fig. 6 B). N-terminal truncations up to 15 residues (ALC1133) still bound the P2-P3 promoter (Fig. 6 B, lane 7), but truncations extending to 25 residues or more (ALC1218, ALC1193, A"

Suarez-Pinzon W.L. Solensen O. Bleackley C. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2093-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 14Faust A. Kleemann R. Rothe H. Kolb H. Shafrir E. Lessons from Animal Diabetes VI. Birkäuser, Boston1996: 47-56Crossref Google Scholar). In this study, we produced transgenic mice expressing NOS2 constitutively in pancreatic β cells and found that the transgenic mice developed severe IDDM without macrophage or lymphocyte infiltration in and around islets. Islets were isolated from ICR mice by the collagenase digestion method (15Okamoto H. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1981; 37: 43-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and cultured for 12 h in the presence of 150 units/ml IL-1β (Sigma). A mouse NOS2 cDNA was cloned by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of reverse-transcribed RNA from IL-1β-stimulated islets. Primers used in the PCR reaction were 5′-TTCCCGGGAGCAGAAGTGCAAAGTCTCAGAC-3′ and 5′-AAAGATCTGGGCTGTCAGAGCCTCGTGGCTTT-3′; these sequences correspond to the nucleotides −25 to −1 and 3418 to 3444 of mouse NOS2 cDNA (16Lyons C.R. Orloff G.J. Cunningham J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6370-6374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and contain XmaI and BglII sites (underlined sequences), respectively. The cloned cDNA sequence was determined and was found to be exactly the same as the reported NOS2 sequence (16Lyons C.R. Orloff G.J. Cunningham J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6370-6374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To express NOS2 in β cells, the 0.7-kbp BamHI-XmaI fragment of the rat insulin II promoter (17Kato I. Suzuki Y. Akabane A.

The resultant hybrid gene (5.8 kbp) separated from the pBlueScript SK (−) (Stratagene) by KpnI and NotI was used for microinjection. To generate transgenic mice, a DNA solution (2 μg/ml) was microinjected into the male pronuclei of fertilized eggs from BDF1 females as described (17Kato I. Suzuki Y. Akabane A. Yonekura H. Tanaka O.

In the present study, the two diabetic transgenic lines, 31 and 40, were established, maintained on CD-1 mouse background, and analyzed. Because the diabetes occurred in two independent lines of transgenic mice, the pathology was assumed to have resulted from the transgene expression rather than from the positional or insertional effects of the transgene. Pancreatic islets were isolated from 4–8-week-old mice by collagenase digestion (15Okamoto H. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1981; 37: 43-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and homogenized (19Kato I. Takasawa S. Akabane A. Tanaka O. Abe H. Takamura T. Suzuki Y. Nata K. Yonekura H. Yoshimoto T.

Control islets were also incubated in the presence of IL-1β (150 units/ml; Sigma). Medium samples (50 μl) were removed at 12 and 24 h. Nitrite levels in the medium were analyzed by using Griess reagent (22Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10586) Google Scholar). Blood and urinary glucose levels were determined by using Advantage equipment (Boehringer Manheim) and Tes-tape assay (Lilly, Indianapolis, IN), respectively. Pancreatic extracts were obtained from the entire pancreas by acid-ethanol extraction (23Epstein P.N. Overbeek P.A. Means A.R. Cell. 1988; 58: 1067-1073Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The insulin levels in the serum and pancreatic extracts were determined by using an insulin radioimmunoassay kit (Amersham Corp.) and rat insulin standards. Aminoguanidine hemisulfate salt (Sigma) at 12 mg/ml in 0.9% NaCl solution was administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 200 mg/kg body weight every 12 h, beginning at 1 day of age. Pancreata from 4-week-old mice were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. In situ nick translation reaction was performed as described (9Fehsel K. Jalowy A. Qi S. Burkart V.

Pancreas. 1995; 10: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and the incorporated biotin-dUTP was visualized by peroxidase reaction. For analysis of DNA strand breaks by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis (9Fehsel K. Jalowy A. Qi S. Burkart V. Hartmann B. Kolb H. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 496-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), genomic DNA was extracted from isolated islets by phenol-chloroform extraction. The DNA (25 ng) labeled by nick translation (25Nose K. Okamoto H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 111: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) using [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Corp.) was electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose gel and autoradiographed. The incorporation of [α-32P]dCTP into the DNA was determined as described (25Nose K. Okamoto H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 111: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis using an NOS2-specific antibody showed that the transgenic mice (lines 31 and 40), but not the nontransgenic control mice, expressed NOS2 in the pancreatic islets (Fig. 1 A). The NOS2 expression was not detected in other tissues such as brain, liver, kidney, and small intestine of the transgenic mice (Fig. 1 B). NOS2 mRNA was detected only in the transgenic islets by Northern blot analysis (data not shown). In immunohistochemistry, islets of transgenic mice were stained for NOS2 (Fig. 2, B and C). The NOS2 expression in transgenic islets was observed from 1 week of age (data not shown). The proportion of insulin-producing cell mass to total pancreatic cell mass was markedly reduced in the transgenic mice (Fig. 2, D–G). On the other hand, islets of the control mice showed no immunoreactivity for NOS2, and the pancreatic exocrine cells showed no detectable staining for NOS2 in the transgenic and nontransgenic mice (Fig. 2, A–C).Figure 2Immunohistochemical detection of NOS2 in mouse pancreas (A–C), insulin staining of representative sections of pancreas (D–F), and islet cell mass of transgenic mice (G).

Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test. *, p < 0.05 (different from control).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next incubated islets from transgenic and control mice and measured the nitrite content in the incubation medium, which is indicative of NO⋅ release (16Lyons C.R. Orloff G.J. Cunningham J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6370-6374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, high levels of nitrite were detected in a time-dependent manner in the medium containing transgenic islets, whereas the nitrite content in the control islet medium was under the limit of detection. The amount of nitrite in the medium of transgenic line 31 was almost equivalent to that of the medium containing IL-1β-stimulated control islets. In the transgenic lines 31 and 40, the mice developed hyperglycemia from 1 week of age (Fig. 4 A) and exhibited profound polydipsia/polyuria by 4 weeks of age. The blood glucose levels of both lines of transgenic mice were over 400 mg/dl, and the urine tested strongly positive (250–500 mg/dl) for glucose. The nontransgenic control mice had normal glucose levels (less than 200 mg/dl) and never showed glycosuria. The serum insulin levels in the transgenic lines 31 (0.69 ± 0.07 ng/ml, n = 7) and 40 (0.53 ± 0.07 ng/ml, n = 7) were significantly (p < 0.05) lower than those in the control mice (3.68 ± 1.10 ng/ml, n = 7). Urine from both lines of transgenic mice often tested positive for ketones; the presence of ketonuria indicated the severity of the diabetes. We followed the diabetes development every week from the first week of age by monitoring the blood glucose levels and pancreatic insulin contents. As shown in Fig. 4, the transgenic mice developed diabetes from as early as 1 week of age. The diabetes was clearly insulin-dependent, because the blood glucose level of diabetic mice injected with 4 units of exogenous insulin (Humulin U, Lilly) was reduced to below 200 mg/dl (data not shown). These results indicated that the diabetes observed in the transgenic mice was characteristic of IDDM (type 1 diabetes, ketosis prone) (27Fajans S.S. Rifkin H. Porte D.J. Ellenberg and Rifkin's Diabetes Mellitus: Theory and Practice. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1990: 346-356Google Scholar). At 1 week of age, NOS2 was immunohistochemically detected in the islets of the transgenic mice, suggesting that NOS2 expression was correlated with the development of diabetes. There was no evidence of transient insulitis such as infiltration of macrophages or lymphocytes at any time from the first to the eighth week of age (Fig. 2). It has been reported that aminoguanidine, an inhibitor of NOS2 (28Corbett J.A. Tilton R.G. Chang K. Hasan K.S. Ido Y. Wang J.L. Sweetland M.A. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Williamson J.R. McDaniel M.L. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 552-556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was effective in reducing NO⋅ produced by IL-1β-treated isletsin vitro (29Corbett J.A. McDaniel M.L. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that the diabetes in the transgenic mice was dependent on NO⋅ production, we undertook a prophylactic intervention with aminoguanidine. The elevation of blood glucose levels as well as the reduction of pancreatic insulin contents in the transgenic mice were prevented (line 31) or delayed (line 40) by aminoguanidine treatment (Fig. 4). In control mice, the intraperitoneal administration of aminoguanidine did not affect the body weight, blood glucose levels, or serum insulin levels during the 8 weeks. Furthermore, the reduction of the insulin-producing cell mass was also prevented or improved by aminoguanidine (Fig. 2 G), indicating that the transgenic model represents the effect of NO⋅ produced by NOS2 in β cells. Immunohistochemical staining of NOS2 showed that the transgenic mice treated with aminoguanidine did express NOS2 (data not shown), indicating that the effects of aminoguanidine were not due to the loss of expression of specific transgenes under the control of the insulin promoter. It has been reported that aminoguanidine treatment has no effect on the appearance of insulitis or the incidence of diabetes in animal models of immune-mediated IDDM (14Faust A. Kleemann R. Rothe H. Kolb H. Shafrir E. Lessons from Animal Diabetes VI. Birkäuser, Boston1996: 47-56Crossref Google Scholar, 30Holstad M. Sandler S.

It is reasonable to assume that not only NO⋅ but also other β cytotoxic factors such as hydroxyl radicals and direct cytotoxic actions by cytotoxic T lymphocytes can be involved in the development of the immune-mediated model (3Okamoto H. Okamoto H. Molecular Biology of the Islets of Langerhans. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1990: 209-231Crossref Google Scholar,4Okamoto H. Shafrir E. Lessons from Animal Diabetes VI. Birkäuser, Boston1996: 97-111Crossref Google Scholar). Because high concentrations of exogenous NO⋅ have been shown to cause islet DNA strand breaks in vitro (8Delaney C.A. Green M.H.L. Lowe J.E. Green I.C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 9Fehsel K. Jalowy A. Qi S. Burkart V. Hartmann B. Kolb H. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 496-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), we examined DNA strand breaks in transgenic and control islets. DNA was labeled by nick translation and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 5 A, [32P]dCTP was incorporated into transgenic islet DNA but not into control islet DNA. The estimated incorporation of [32P]dCTP into transgenic islet DNA (line 31, 27.2 ± 0.98 cpm/pg DNA; line 40, 45.1 ± 1.58 cpm/pg DNA) was much higher than that into control DNA (0.66 ± 0.06 cpm/pg DNA). We further confirmed the presence of DNA strand breaks by in situ nick translation. Transgenic islet cells showed extensive DNA strand breaks (Fig. 5, C and D), but nontransgenic islet cells did not (Fig. 5 B). We and others have reported that when NO⋅ is produced in β cells upon cytokine stimulation (4Okamoto H. Shafrir E. Lessons from Animal Diabetes VI.

The depletion of NAD+ severely impairs β cell functions and ultimately evokes β cell death (3Okamoto H. Okamoto H. Molecular Biology of the Islets of Langerhans.

We have already proposed that although IDDM can be caused by many different agents such as immunologic abnormalities, inflammatory tissue damage, and β cytotoxic chemical substances, the final pathway for the toxic agents is the same (3Okamoto H.

This pathway involves DNA damage by free radicals such as NO⋅and hydroxyl radicals, poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase activation, and NAD+depletion. Therefore, IDDM is theoretically preventable by suppressing immune reactions, scavenging free radicals, and inhibiting poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase by its inhibitors. The mechanism of β cell death and its prevention was confirmed by using poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase gene disrupted mice (13Heller B. Wang Z.-Q. Wagner E.F. Radons J. Bürkle A. Fehsel K. Burkart V. Kolb H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11176-11180Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In the present study, we showed that NOS2 transgenic mice developed IDDM with β cell DNA damages by NO⋅ produced in the cells. Moreover, it was recently reported that NO⋅-mediated poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase activation plays an essential role in ischemic neuronal cell death (36Eliasson M.J.L. Sampei K. Mandir A.S. Hurn P.D.

It is thus reasonable to assume that not only β cell death in IDDM but also many other cell deaths such as ischemic brain injury can be explained by the pathway described above. We thank Drs. O.

https://openalex.org/W2012826947,"Expression of the bradykinin B1receptor gene is up-regulated in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in response to a variety of inflammatory stimuli. We isolated the 5′-flanking region of the human bradykinin B1 receptor gene and examined its promoter activity by transient transfection analysis. This region (−2582 to +34) showed promoter activity inducible by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in VSMCs. Further deletion analysis revealed that constructs containing 111 base pairs of 5′-flanking sequence were sufficient for transcriptional induction. Mutagenesis of a nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-like site at −64 to −55 abolished most of the LPS, TNF-α, and IL-1β inducibility, whereas a mutation of a cyclic AMP response element at −50 to −43 markedly reduced the basal promoter activity, and a mutation of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) site at −78 to −72 had minimal effects. Nuclear extracts from LPS, TNF-α, and IL-1β-treated VSMCs, IL-1β-treated human hepatoma HepG2, and human lung fibroblast IMR-90 cells showed strong inducible binding activity to the NF-κB-like site by gel shift assays. These results demonstrated that NF-κB-like nuclear factor was involved in the inducible expression of the human bradykinin B1 receptor gene during inflammatory processes."

https://openalex.org/W2058982726,"Intracellular Ca2+ mobilization occurs in a variety of cellular processes and is mediated by two major systems, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) systems. cADPR has been proposed to be a second messenger for insulin secretion induced by glucose in pancreatic β-cells (Takasawa, S., Nata, K., Yonekura, H., and Okamoto, H. (1993)Science 259, 370–373). Here we show that the cADPR signal system for insulin secretion is replaced by the IP3 system in diabetic β-cells such as ob/ob mouse islets and RINm5F cells. We measured the cADPR content in these β-cells by radioimmunoassay and found that the increase of the cADPR content by glucose did not occur in ob/ob mouse islets and RINm5F cells, whereas the increased cADPR level by glucose was observed in normal rat and mouse islets. Microsomes of these diabetic β-cells released Ca2+ in response to IP3 but not to cADPR. In the diabetic β-cells, CD38 (ADP-ribosyl cyclase/cADPR hydrolase) and type 2 ryanodine receptor mRNAs were scarcely detected and, in contrast, an increased expression of IP3receptor mRNAs was observed. The diabetic β-cells secreted insulin rather by carbamylcholine than by glucose. Intracellular Ca2+ mobilization occurs in a variety of cellular processes and is mediated by two major systems, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) systems. cADPR has been proposed to be a second messenger for insulin secretion induced by glucose in pancreatic β-cells (Takasawa, S., Nata, K., Yonekura, H., and Okamoto, H. (1993)Science 259, 370–373). Here we show that the cADPR signal system for insulin secretion is replaced by the IP3 system in diabetic β-cells such as ob/ob mouse islets and RINm5F cells. We measured the cADPR content in these β-cells by radioimmunoassay and found that the increase of the cADPR content by glucose did not occur in ob/ob mouse islets and RINm5F cells, whereas the increased cADPR level by glucose was observed in normal rat and mouse islets. Microsomes of these diabetic β-cells released Ca2+ in response to IP3 but not to cADPR. In the diabetic β-cells, CD38 (ADP-ribosyl cyclase/cADPR hydrolase) and type 2 ryanodine receptor mRNAs were scarcely detected and, in contrast, an increased expression of IP3receptor mRNAs was observed. The diabetic β-cells secreted insulin rather by carbamylcholine than by glucose. Glucose is the primary stimulus of insulin secretion and synthesis in pancreatic β-cells of the islets of Langerhans (1Hedeskov J.C. Physiol.

Biochem. 1981; 37: 43-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Increases in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration mediate the biochemical events that couple glucose stimulation to insulin secretion and mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores in the endoplasmic reticulum as well as Ca2+ influx from extracellular sources (4Ashcroft F.M. Ashcroft S.J.H. Ashcroft F.M. Ashcroft S.J.H. Insulin: Molecular Biology to Pathology. Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 97-150Google Scholar) are important in this process (5Rojas E. Carroll P.B.

It has been thought that inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) 1The abbreviations used are: IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; cADPR, cyclic ADP-ribose; KRB, Krebs-Ringer's bicarbonate buffer; RIA, radioimmunoassay; RT, reverse transcriptase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; BST-1, bone marrow stromal cell antigen-1; RyR, ryanodine receptor; IP3R, IP3 receptor; 8-NH2-cADPR, 8-amino-cADPR. is a second messenger for Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores (6Berridge M.J.

We have recently proposed another pathway for the increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration for insulin secretion by glucose via the CD38 (ADP-ribosyl cyclase/cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) hydrolase)-cADPR signal system in pancreatic β-cells (7Okamoto H.

In the present study, we showed that the cADPR-dependent signal system for intracellular Ca2+ mobilization for insulin secretion did not work in diabetic β-cells such as ob/ob mouse islets and RINm5F cells, which in contrast used the IP3-dependent Ca2+ signal system. Two systems for intracellular Ca2+ mobilization thus appear to be differentially used depending on whether the condition is physiological or pathological. Animals were fasted for 24 h before the experiments. 1200–2000 pancreatic islets were isolated from 6–10 animals of male Wistar rats (250–350 g, SLC, Hamamatsu, Japan), C57BL/6J mice, or ob/ob mice (8–14 weeks old, Jackson Laboratories) by the collagenase procedure using Hanks' solution containing 2.8 mm glucose (3Okamoto H.

After incubation, the incubation medium was removed and the islets were sonicated (3 × 10 s) in 370 μl of perchloric solution (2.5%, v/v). Likewise, cultured rat RINm5F insulinoma cells (5 × 106 cells) were sonicated in 370 μl of perchloric acid solution. The homogenates were stored at −80 °C and later defrosted and centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g. The supernatant (330–350 μl) of the homogenates was then mixed with 150 μl of a suspension of Norit A (27 mg/ml in H2O, Nacalai tesque, Kyoto, Japan). After 30 min incubation at 37 °C, the samples were again centrifuged, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed three times with 1.0 ml of H2O, resuspended in a pyridine/ethanol/H2O mixture (10:50:40, v/v/v), and incubated for 120 min at 37 °C. After a further centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and evaporated (Speedvac; Savant Instrument Inc., Farmingdale, NY). The recovery of cADPR, monitored by the recovery of [3H]cADPR added in each homogenate, was 67.8 ± 1.49% (n = 47). Correction was introduced for the recovery of cADPR. The cADPR content of the cell extracts was measured by a radioimmunoassay (RIA) as described (15Takahashi K. Kukimoto I. Tokita K. Inageda K. Inoue S. Kontani K. Hoshino S. Nishina H. Kanaho Y. Katada T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, the evaporated materials eluted from Norit A charcoal were resuspended with 50 μl of H2O and then incubated at 25 °C for 2 h with bovine alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) and venom phosphodiesterase (Worthington) at final concentrations of 50 and 2 units/ml, respectively, in 100 mm imidazole HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 400 mm KCl. The reaction was terminated by adding a solution of trichloroacetic acid (at a final concentration of 4%, w/v) and kept on ice for 20 min. A clear supernatant was obtained after centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min. An aliquot (10–20 μl) of the supernatant was immediately neutralized with a solution of 2m Tris base and subjected to the procedure of cADPR measurement (15Takahashi K. Kukimoto I. Tokita K.

As a control, another aliquot was heated at 95 °C for 10 min before being neutralized and analyzed by the RIA. The identity of the immunoreactive cADPR in islets was also confirmed after its separation by high performance liquid chromatography with an anion-exchange column, as described previously (15Takahashi K.

Immunoreactive cADPR was eluted as a single peak at the same retention time as the standard of cADPR. Almost 100% of the total immunoreactive cADPR applied to the column was recovered at the elution position of cADPR (data not shown). Microsomes were prepared as described previously (9Kato I.

In brief, 2000 hand-picked islets from male mice (C57BL/6J or ob/ob) or RINm5F cells (1 × 107) were homogenized with a pellet mixer (Treff, Degersheim, Switzerland) in 0.2 ml of acetate intracellular medium composed of 250 mm potassium acetate, 250 mm N-methylglucamine, 1 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.2) supplemented with 0.5 mmATP, 4 mm phosphocreatine, creatine phosphokinase (2 units/ml), 2.5 mm benzamidine, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After the homogenates had been centrifuged for 45 s at 13,000 × g, the microsomes were prepared by Percoll density gradient centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 40 min at 10 °C. Release of Ca2+ was monitored in 0.6 ml of intracellular medium composed of 250 mm potassium gluconate, 250 mm N-methylglucamine, 1 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.2) supplemented with 1 mmATP, 4 mm phosphocreatine, creatine phosphokinase (2 units/ml), 2.5 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 7 μg/ml bovine brain calmodulin (13Takasawa S.

We first incubated rat islets with low and high glucose and measured the cADPR content by RIA. As shown in Fig. 1, it was found that the cADPR content of islets incubated with 20 mm glucose was increased within 5 min, whereas the cADPR content of islets incubated with 2.8 mm glucose was not. The results were consistent with our previous observation based on the Ca2+ releasing activity of cADPR in islet extracts (12Takasawa S. Nata K. Yonekura H. Okamoto H. Science. 1993; 259: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). We also isolated islets from C57BL/6J mice, incubated them with glucose, and measured the cADPR content. The cADPR content was significantly increased by glucose stimulation (Table I). We next isolated islets from mutant mice of C57BL/6J, ob/ob diabetic mice, and measured the cADPR content. Some amounts of cADPR in ob/ob islets was detected when incubated in 2.8 mm glucose, but the cADPR content was not increased by glucose stimulation (Table I). Because rat insulinoma-derived RINm5F β-cells, which synthesize and secrete very little insulin in response to glucose (28Praz G.A. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Blondel B. Strauss A.J. Renold A.E.

In contrast to normal islet microsomes, microsomes from diabetic β-cells showed quite different responses to the two Ca2+-releasing second messengers: ob/ob islet microsomes released very little Ca2+ by cADPR but released much Ca2+ by IP3. RINm5F cell microsomes responded well to IP3 to release Ca2+ but scarcely responded to cADPR (Fig. 2). The Ca2+ releases by IP3 in ob/ob islet and RINm5F microsomes were attenuated by the prior addition of 100 μg/ml heparin, an inhibitor of IP3 receptors, (12Takasawa S. Nata K. Yonekura H. Okamoto H.

As shown in Fig. 3 A, the CD38 mRNA level was significantly decreased in ob/ob islets. The decrease of CD38 mRNA in ob/ob islets may explain the low response in cADPR content by glucose stimulation because CD38 has both the ADP-ribosyl cyclase and the cADPR hydrolase activity, and the increase of cADPR by glucose stimulation is achieved by inhibition of the cADPR hydrolase activity of CD38 (9Kato I.

Concerning intracellular Ca2+ release channels, the mRNA expression of RyR-2, which is postulated to be a Ca2+ release channel for cADPR (14Noguchi N. Takasawa S. Nata K. Tohgo A. Kato I. Ikehata F.

Nature. 1993; 364: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), was clearly detected in normal islets but not in ob/ob islets. In contrast, IP3R mRNAs (IP3R-1, IP3R-2, IP3R-4, and IP3R-5) were not detected in normal islets but were clearly detected inob/ob islets, and although IP3R-3 mRNA was slightly detected in normal islets, the mRNA was significantly increased in ob/ob islets (Fig. 3 B), well fitting with the observation that IP3-induced Ca2+mobilization preferentially worked in ob/ob islet microsomes (Fig. 2). From these results, it is possible that changes in gene expression involved in intracellular Ca2+ mobilization occurred in diabetic β-cells, resulting in the abnormal response to glucose. The above observed phenomena well explain the differences between C57BL/6J and ob/ob islets in insulin secretion by glucose and carbamylcholine (Fig. 4):ob/ob islets secreted far more insulin by carbamylcholine stimulation, which is thought to be mediated by IP3-induced Ca2+ mobilization, than did C57BL/6J islets. Moreover, simultaneous stimulation to ob/ob islets by glucose and carbamylcholine did not induce much more insulin than that by glucose and carbamylcholine independently, whereas the simultaneous stimulation to C57BL/6J islets induced significantly more insulin than that by glucose alone (Fig. 4). These results suggest that, in normal islets, Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores by glucose stimulation for insulin secretion is mediated by the cADPR-dependent system and other stimulants for insulin secretion such as acetylcholine mobilize a little Ca2+ via the IP3-dependent system independently. Inob/ob islets, the intracellular Ca2+mobilization for insulin secretion appears to be mainly mediated by the IP3-dependent system. Intracellular Ca2+ mobilization has been reported to be mediated by both IP3 and cADPR in a variety of cells (33Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Walseth T.F.

However, some cells are reported to utilize preferentially one of the two second messengers (12Takasawa S. Nata K. Yonekura H. Okamoto H.

HgTX1 inhibits125I-margatoxin binding to rat brain membranes as well as depolarization-induced 86Rb+ flux through homotetrameric Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.3 channels stably transfected in HEK-293 cells, but it displays much lower affinity for Kv1.6 channels. A HgTX1 double mutant (HgTX1-A19Y/Y37F) was constructed to allow high specific activity iodination of the peptide. HgTX1-A19Y/Y37F and monoiodinated HgTX1-A19Y/Y37F are equally potent in inhibiting125I-margatoxin binding to rat brain membranes as HgTX1 (IC50 values ∼0.3 pm).125I-HgTX1-A19Y/Y37F binds with subpicomolar affinities to membranes derived from HEK-293 cells expressing homotetrameric Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.3 channels and to rat brain membranes (K d values 0.1–0.25 pm, respectively) but with lower affinity to Kv1.6 channels (K d 9.6 pm), and it does not interact with either Kv1.4 or Kv1.5 channels. Several subpopulations of native Kv1 subunit oligomers that contribute to the rat brain HgTX1 receptor have been deduced by immunoprecipitation experiments using antibodies specific for Kv1 subunits. HgTX1 represents a novel and useful tool with which to investigate subclasses of voltage-gated K+ channels and Kv1 subunit assembly in different tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2011037261,Isotopic dating indicates that chondrules were produced a few million years after the solar nebula formed. This timing is incompatible with dynamical lifetimes of small particles in the nebula and short time scales for the formation of planetesimals. Temporal and dynamical constraints can be reconciled if chondrules were produced by heating of debris from disrupted first-generation planetesimals. Jovian resonances can excite planetesimal eccentricities enough to cause collisional disruption and melting of dust by bow shocks in the nebular gas. The ages of chondrules may indicate the times of Jupiter's formation and dissipation of gas from the asteroidal region.

This pool, but not the target, Golgi-associated Syn5 pool, was essential for the assembly of vesicular-tubular pre-Golgi intermediates and the delivery of cargo to the Golgi.

Thus, endothelial cell TM, in vitro at least, appears to participate in the regulation of not only coagulation but also fibrinolysis. Thrombin and plasmin are the terminal proteases formed by the coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways (1Collen D. Lijnen H.R. Blood. 1991; 78: 3114-3124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Astrup T. Semin.

Thrombin catalyzes the cleavage of fibrinogen to form a fibrin clot, while plasmin catalyzes the proteolysis of fibrin and subsequent clot degradation. Since both proteases appear to work antagonistically, the coagulation and the fibrinolytic systems presumably must be tightly regulated and interconnected. The failure to form a stable clot or its unregulated removal could result in exsanguination in the event of injury, whereas the failure to remove a clot or prevent its continuous formation could lead to thrombosis, heart attack, or stroke. Thrombin regulates its own generation via the protein C pathway (3Esmon C.T. Esmon N.L. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1984; 10: 122-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 4Esmon C.T.

Thrombin, in complex with thrombomodulin, catalyzes the proteolytic activation of protein C to produce the serine protease-activated protein C.

We recently demonstrated that the thrombin-catalyzed activation of TAFI is enhanced by a recombinant soluble form of thrombomodulin (15Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). The proposed mechanism, for which the kinetic parameters includedKm = 1.0 μm and kcat = 1.24 s−1, allows for the formation of the binary complexes thrombin-thrombomodulin and thrombin-TAFI, and subsequent formation of the thrombin-thrombomodulin-TAFI complex. Because protein C and TAFI are both substrates for thrombin-thrombomodulin, thrombomodulin may regulate not only coagulation, through activation of the protein C pathway, but also fibrinolysis, through the enhancement of TAFI activation. Thus, thrombomodulin potentially couples and regulates both the coagulation and fibrinolytic cascades. This possibility was tested in the present studies. The results indicate that a soluble form of thrombomodulin prolongs the lysis time of clots formed from both purified components and human plasma. These effects require TAFI activation. In addition, thrombomodulin expressed on HUVECs potentiates the activation of TAFI, thereby retarding the lysis of clots formed in their presence. These data indicate that the thrombomodulin-thrombin complex is relevant as a regulator not only of protein C activation but also of TAFI activation, thereby contributing to the down-regulation of both coagulation and fibrinolysis.

In the system of purified components, a solution was prepared in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl containing fibrinogen (2.7 μm), plasminogen (0.6 μm), PC/PS (10 μm), prothrombin (0.7 μm), factor V (8.3 nm), antithrombin III (1.3 μm), α2-antiplasmin (0.5 μm), and, when included, TAFI (30 nm) and protein C (100 nm). To assess fibrinolysis, aliquots (100 μl) were pipetted into the wells of a microtiter plate containing separated, small aliquots of thrombin (6.0 nm final concentration), tPA (294 pm final) and Ca2+ (10 mm final). Immediate clotting and subsequent fibrinolysis were monitored over time by continual absorbance (turbidity) measurements at 405 nm, at 37 °C, in a Thermomax plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Lysis time is defined as the time to the midpoint of the turbid-to-clear transition that characterizes the lysis of fibrin.

Chem. 1990; 265: 16948-16954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from fresh frozen human plasma that had been thawed at 37 °C and then dialyzed versus 0.02 m HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4 (HBS) or adsorbed with barium citrate to remove vitamin K-dependent proteins prior to dialysis. The TAFI-deficient plasmas were produced by passing the NHP or BAP over a column containing immobilized anti-TAFI monoclonal antibody mAb TAFI16. The TAFI-deficient plasmas were 99.9% TAFI-free as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (12Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. Tracy P.B. Blood. 1996; 88: 2093-2100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primary cultures of HUVECs were isolated as described by Shatos et al. (21Shatos M.A. Doherty J.M. Stump D.C. Thompson E.A. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20443-20448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, human umbilical cords were removed from the placenta within 2 h of birth and stored for no more than 24 h at 4 °C. Veins were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (0.02 m sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Collagenase was then maintained within the vein for 15 min, and released endothelial cells were recovered. The vein was then rinsed with Hanks' buffered salt solution containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. The rinse solution was combined with the collagenase extract. Cells were then pelleted and resuspended in M-199 medium (Sigma) with 20% fetal bovine serum at 1 × 105 cells/ml. Wells of a 24- or 96-well plate (Falcon from VWR, Boston, MA) were seeded with 100,000 or 10,000 HUVECs/well, respectively, and maintained in M-199 with 20% fetal bovine serum, refeeding every other day, until confluent. Confluent cultures were rinsed three times with HBS immediately before use. HUVECs displayed the prerequisite cobblestone appearance and stained positively for both vWF (rabbit polyanti-vWF, Cappel), and β-actin (monoclonal from Sigma) and negative for α-actin (monoclonal from Sigma). Plasmas that included BAP, TdBAP, NHP, or TdNHP were diluted 2:3 with HBS, and tPA was added (183 pm final concentration to either of the barium citrate-adsorbed plasma samples or 367 pm final concentration to either of the normal human plasma samples). After rinsing the wells of a 96-well microtiter plate containing the confluent monolayer of HUVECs with HBS, an aliquot (25 μl) containing both thrombin (6 nm, final concentration) and CaCl2 (10 mm, final) in HBS was added to each well, immediately before the addition of 25 μl of 2:3 diluted plasma. Clot formation and subsequent fibrinolysis thus were initiated by the addition of the plasma to the well. Turbidity, monitored at 405 nm, was determined at 2.5-min intervals using a Thermomax plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) maintained at 37 °C. Lysis time was defined as the time required to achieve a 50% reduction in the maximum absorbance produced by the initial formation of a fibrin clot. Either mAb TAFI16 or mAb TM-531 (100 nm, final concentration), when required, was added to the plasma prior to its addition to each well to verify both TAFI- and thrombomodulin-dependent prolongation of lysis times. Samples (10 μl) containing TAFIa were added to 190 μl of TdNHP, diluted 1:3 (A280 = 16.0), containing PC/PS vesicles (10 μm). One hundred μl of the mixture was then pipetted into the well of a microtiter plate that contained separated, 2-μl aliquots of thrombin, activated protein C, tPA, and CaCl2. Their respective final concentrations were 6.0 nm, 10 or 50 nm, 294 pm, and 5.0 mm. Turbidity was continually monitored at 405 nm and 37 °C in a Thermomax plate reader, and lysis time was determined as described previously (10Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 20Bajzar L. Fredenburgh J.C. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16948-16954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activated TAFI was produced from purified TAFI (1.0 μm) by incubating it at 22 °C for 15 min in a solution of 0.02 m HEPES, 0.15m NaCl, 5.0 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, containing thrombin (20 nm) and soluble thrombomodulin (50 nm). The sample was serially diluted to generate the standard curve. The standard curve is approximately linear up to 2.0 nm TAFIa and then tends toward saturation at higher TAFIa concentrations (Fig. 1). The lower and upper limits of lysis times are 60 and 185 min under these conditions. Because activated protein C is included in the assay, endogenous thrombin formation in the plasma is prevented (9Bajzar L. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8608-8616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar); therefore, unactivated TAFI is not converted to TAFIa during the assay. As a consequence, the assay is specific for TAFIa, and mixtures of TAFIa and TAFI can be assessed without interference from the latter. A solution was prepared containing HBS, CaCl2 (5.0 mm), bovine serum albumin (1% w/v), and either TAFI (400 nm) or protein C (100 nm). An aliquot (200 μl) was then added to washed HUVECs that had been grown to confluence in the wells of a 24-well plate (Falcon from VWR). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C, and at regular intervals 15-μl aliquots were withdrawn and placed on ice. At the end of the experiment, 10-μl aliquots of the samples were added to 190 μl of TdNHP supplemented with 10 μm PC/PS vesicles. Two 100-μl aliquots of these samples were then added to each of two wells in a microtiter plate. One well, for the assay of TAFIa, contained thrombin, tPA, activated protein C, and Ca2+ at final concentrations indicated above in the description of the TAFIa assay. The other well lacked activated protein C. Thus, in this sample, endogenous prothrombin activation was allowed, which led to activation of the zymogen TAFI in the sample and thereby provided a semiquantitative measure of both TAFIa and TAFI in the sample. These experiments were performed in both the absence and presence of an inhibitory monoclonal antibody directed at thrombomodulin (mAb TM-531, 100 nm). In addition, control experiments included incubations performed in the absence of HUVECs. Other experiments were performed under identical conditions except that TAFI was replaced with protein C. At various intervals throughout the incubation, aliquots were removed and diluted in a quenching buffer containing 100 nm hirudin (22Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4622-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Activated protein C was subsequently quantified by measuring rates of hydrolysis of the fluorescent peptidyl substrate, d-valylprolylarginyl aminonaphthalenebutyl sulfonamide (23Butenas S. Drungilaite V. Mann K.G. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and comparing them to a standard curve generated with purified activated protein C. Fibrin clots were formed from a solution comprising purified components including fibrinogen, plasminogen, prothrombin, factor V, antithrombin III, and α2-antiplasmin at approximately 13 their respective plasma concentrations. These experiments were performed in the presence of PC/PS vesicles and of soluble thrombomodulin at various concentrations. The tPA-induced lysis times were then determined (Fig. 2). Because factor Xa is absent in this system, prothrombin activation cannot occur. Thus, the only thrombin present is that used to initiate clot formation. In the absence of thrombomodulin, TAFI elicited a modest increase in lysis time (from 38 to 50 min), most likely due to its partial activation during the lysis assay. Notably, however, the addition of as little as 2.5 nm thrombomodulin to the assay system caused an approximate doubling of the lysis time to 100 min. The maximum increase in lysis time was observed at 5 nmthrombomodulin, and an EC50 value of 1.0 nm was obtained. In the absence of TAFI, however, lysis time was unaffected by thrombomodulin at any concentration tested. Since the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex also activates protein C, the ability of the latter to competitively inhibit TAFI activation was assessed by comparing the effect of soluble thrombomodulin on lysis time in the presence and absence of protein C at its plasma concentration (Fig. 2). The data demonstrated that protein C had negligible effect, indicating that thrombomodulin was able to prolong lysis time in a TAFI-dependent manner despite the presence of the alternate substrate at its plasma concentration. The substrate concentration dependence for a substrate S, in the presence of a competing substrate S2 is given by the equation, r =kcat(E0)[S1]/(1 + [S1]/Km1 + [S2]/Km2). If [S2] ≪ Km2, which is the case here for protein C (Km ∼5.0 μm, [PC] = 0.1 μm; Refs. 24Le Bonniec B.F. MacGillivray R.T.A. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13796-13803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 25Griffin J.H. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1984; 10: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), then the effect of the competing substrate on the rate of conversion of the first substrate is very small. Similar results (Fig. 3) were obtained in assessing the effect of thrombomodulin on the lysis times of clots formed from BAP, TdBAP, and TdBAP reconstituted with 50 nmpurified TAFI (rTdBAP). In this system, the vitamin K-dependent proteins are absent, and prothrombin activation cannot occur during the lysis assay. Again, by increasing the concentration of thrombomodulin in the assay (from 0 to 20 nm), lysis times of clots formed from BAP or rTdBAP minimally doubled (from 60 to either 150 or 135 min, respectively), whereas thrombomodulin had no effect on the lysis time of clots formed from TdBAP. The doubling of lysis time observed was comparable with that observed in a system comprising purified components (Fig. 2). The dependence of lysis time on the thrombomodulin concentration exhibited saturation between 5 and 10 nm (EC50 = 1.5 nm). These data show that in a plasma-based system thrombomodulin prolongs lysis time through a mechanism that is TAFI-dependent and does not require the production of high concentrations of thrombin in situ. To determine whether thrombomodulin prolongs clot lysis time through a TAFI-dependent mechanism, two monoclonal antibodies, mAb TAFI16 and mAb TM-531, were examined for their ability to inhibit both the TAFI- and the thrombomodulin-dependent prolongation of lysis time. mAb TAFI16 specifically blocks the activation of TAFI by both thrombin and the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex (12Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. Tracy P.B. Blood. 1996; 88: 2093-2100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas mAb TM-531 inhibits protein C activation catalyzed by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. 2J. Morser, unpublished results. mAb TAFI16 (100 nm) inhibited the prolongation in lysis time produced by 20 nm thrombomodulin in both BAP and rTdBAP (Fig. 4 A) without affecting the lysis time of TdBAP in both the presence and absence of thrombomodulin. Similarly, mAb TM-531 at approximately 25 nm completely neutralized the inhibitory effects of 20 nm thrombomodulin but had no effect on lysis time in the absence of thrombomodulin (Fig. 4 B). These data indicate that mAb TAFI16 and mAb TM-531 specifically inhibit TAFI- and thrombomodulin-dependent prolongation of lysis times and are, therefore, suitable tools to assess the contributions of TAFI and thrombomodulin to lysis times in complex systems. Thrombomodulin prolongs lysis times of clots formed in a defined system comprising purified components both in the absence and presence of protein C at its plasma concentration, as well as in clots formed from BAP (plasma depleted of the vitamin K-dependent proteins including protein C). The effect of protein C on thrombomodulin-dependent prolongation of lysis times in clots formed from normal human plasma, however, is unknown. The results, shown in Fig. 5, indicate that as little as 1 nm thrombomodulin increases the lysis time from 120 to 180 min maximally in normal human plasma. Notably, in the absence of thrombomodulin, the lysis time was 120 min, which is twice as long as that observed in BAP in the absence of thrombomodulin (Fig. 4 A). This observation is consistent with partial activation of TAFI by thrombin at the high concentrations formed during the lysis assay in clots formed from NHP but not in clots formed from BAP (9Bajzar L. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8608-8616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,26Hemker H.C. Wielders S. Kessels H. Beguin S. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Again, the effect of thrombomodulin in clots formed from NHP was eliminated by mAb TAFI16 (100 nm), indicating the dependence of this effect on TAFI. This shows that the lysis time of clots formed from NHP is prolonged in a TAFI-dependent manner by thrombomodulin. Most likely, the formation of additional thrombin in NHP during the assay contributes to the activation of TAFI and reduces the requirement for thrombomodulin. This is reflected in the observation that both the EC50(0.5 nm) and the concentration of thrombomodulin required to achieve saturation are reduced when compared with those determined for clots produced from BAP. Furthermore, protein C (present in NHP but not in BAP) did not negate the effect of thrombomodulin by acting as a competing substrate for the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. Although soluble thrombomodulin prolongs lysis times in a TAFI-dependent manner, no evidence exists indicating that cellular thrombomodulin is capable of inducing a similar response. Therefore, cultured HUVECs, as a cellular source of thrombomodulin, were examined for their effects on lysis times of clots formed from either BAP or TdBAP. BAP and TdBAP, rather than NHP and TdNHP, were used in initial experiments to avoid generation of additional thrombin during the experiment, which would contribute to TAFI activation and perhaps obscure the effects of cellular thrombomodulin on lysis times. Data shown in Table I indicate that HUVECs prolong lysis times of clots formed from BAP (containing TAFI) from 50 to 115 min. The data also indicate that the observed prolongation of lysis time is attenuated by both mAb TAFI16 and mAb TM-531, either individually or in combination. The antibodies did not affect the lysis times of clots formed in the absence of HUVECs. This indicates that the effect of HUVECs on lysis time is both TAFI- and thrombomodulin-dependent. Furthermore, since the lysis time observed in the presence of both antibodies was identical to that observed in the presence of each antibody individually, prolongation of lysis time involves a single pathway including both TAFI and thrombomodulin.Table IEffect of cultured HUVECs on tPA-induced fibrinolysisConditionsLysis time ± S.E.

There is pre-Holocene ice near the bed. The change in delta18O since the last glacial maximum (LGM) is at least 12.5 per mil, compared with an expected value of 7 per mil, suggesting that LGM ice originated at the much higher elevations of the then existing Foxe Dome and Foxe Ridge of the Laurentide Ice Sheet.

(1996) Science 271, 648–650). Detailed analysis of the PRK1 region involved in RhoA binding has revealed that two homologous sequences within the HR1 domain (HR1a and HR1b) both bind to RhoA; the third repeat within this domain, HR1cPRK1, does not bind RhoA. The related HR1 motif is also found to confer RhoA binding activity to the only other fully cloned member of this kinase family, PRK2. Furthermore, the predictive value of this motif is established for an HR1a sequence derived from aCaenorhabditis elegans open reading frame encoding a protein kinase of unknown function. Interestingly, the HR1aPRK1 and HR1bPRK1 subdomains are shown to display a distinctive nucleotide dependence for RhoA binding. HRIaPRK1 is entirely GTP-dependent, while HR1bPRK1 binds both GTP- and GDP-bound forms of RhoA. This distinction indicates that there are two sites of contact between RhoA and PRK1, one contact through a region that is conformationally dependent upon the nucleotide-bound state of RhoA and one that is not. Analysis of binding to Rho/Rac chimera provides evidence for a HR1aPRK1 but not HR1bPRK1 interaction in the central third of Rho. Additionally, it is observed that the V14RhoA mutant binds HR1a but does not bind HR1b.

Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins provide a class of cellular switches that cycle between functional states defined by their GTP or GDP binding status. The specific roles of these GTP-binding proteins in the control of cell functions are many, ranging from the interaction of receptor coupled heterotrimeric G-proteins with second messenger generators (e.g. Ref. 2Gilman A.G. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 65-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) to that of initiation control in translation (3Proud C.G. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1992; 32: 243-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Among this broad class of proteins are the “small” GTP-binding proteins constituted by the Ras, Rho, Rab, Arf, and Ran families. These G-proteins have distinctive roles in cellular control, encompassing cell proliferation/differentiation (4Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev.

Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21663-21670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the nomenclature employed here will be PRK (protein kinase C-related kinase) throughout. (29Mukai H.

This kinase and two related sequences were originally identified in screens for protein kinase C gene products; however, it is clear that these proteins are in fact quite distinct from protein kinase C within their regulatory domains. The complete cDNA cloning of PRK1 and PRK2 has revealed conserved regulatory domain features in these predicted proteins absent from protein kinase C (31Palmer R.H. Ridden J. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), although it should be noted that one domain is predicted to retain some structural resemblance to the protein kinase C C2 domain (32Ponting C.P. Parker P.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). PRK1 has been shown to bind to and be stimulated by RhoA in vitro (1Amano M. Mukai H. Ono Y. Chihara K. Matsui T. Hamajima Y. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 271: 648-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar); it has been demonstrated also to be activated by various fatty acids and phosphoinositides (33Mukai H. Kitagawa M. Shibata H.

Le Good J.A. Gigg R. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22412-22416Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The precise molecular action of these effector molecules on PRK1 is poorly understood. The potential importance of the Rho-PRK pathway in controlling cell functions has led us to define the site of interaction of these proteins. Interestingly, the results demonstrate that in fact RhoA can make two independent contacts with PRK1 that differ in their dependence upon RhoA conformation and lead to a high affinity interaction. The two target sites on PRK1 are homologous and define a class of binding sites for Rho. The full-length PRK1 was inserted into the mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). PRK1 cDNA was digested with BssHI and XhoI; the BssHI site was blunt-ended with mung bean nuclease, and the purified fragment was inserted into the EcoRV/XhoI sites of pcDNA3. The PRK2 HR1abc fragment (amino acids 1–380) was subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-2TK (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) at the BamHI/EcoRI site. DNA fragments encoding various PRK1 HR1 motifs were amplified by PCR using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) and the following oligonucleotide primers: HR1aPRK1, 5′-GGGATCCCCATGGCCAGCGACGCCGTG-3′ and 5′-CCTCGAGTCAGGTGGCCGCCGGGTCGGG-3′; HR1bPRK1, 5′-GGGGATCCCCGCCACCAACCTGAGCCGC-3′ and 5′-CCCTCGAGTCACGGGGCTGCCTGGTTCTC-3′; HR1cPRK1, 5′-GGGGATCCCCGATGACACCCAAGGGAGT-3′ and 5′-CCCTCGAGTCAAGCGAGCTCTTCTCGCAG-3′; HR1abcPRK1, 5′-GGGATCCCCATGGCCAGCGACGCCGTG-3′ and 5′-GGGGATCCCCGATGACACCCAAGGGAGT-3′; F46F6.2 HR1a, 5′-TGGGATCCCCGGCACTTATTGGGAGACA-3′ and 5′-CCCTCGAGCTAAAAAGCTCCACTGTTGT-3′. The products were digested with BamHI and XhoI and subcloned into the BamHI/XhoI site of pGEX-5X-1 (Pharmacia). All of the constructs were confirmed by sequencing. The small G-protein constructs, both wild type and chimeric, have been described previously (35Diekmann D. Nobes C.D. Burbelo P.D. Abo A. Hall A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5297-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The full-length PRK1 in pcDNA3 was transfected into COS7 cells by electroporation, expressed for 36 h, and harvested directly into SDS-PAGE 2The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; RU, resonance units. sample buffer. The various cDNA constructs in pGEX vectors were expressed in the Escherichia coli Bl21 bacterial strain and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose. The GST-GTPase fusion proteins were cleaved by thrombin treatment (3 units/liter of culture), whereas the purified kinase fragments were eluted as fusion proteins from the Sepharose with 10 mmreduced glutathione. The relative nucleotide loading capacities of the small GTPases used in all of the studies were determined by a guanine nucleotide filter binding assay (36Self A.J. Hall A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Briefly, GTPases were incubated with [α-32P]GTP in a low MgCl2 buffer for 20 min at 30 °C followed by the addition of excess MgCl2and filtering through prewetted nitrocellulose using a Millipore filtration device. Filters were washed, and bound nucleotide was determined by scintillation counting. The relationship between mol of nucleotide retained on the filters and mol of GTPase present was used to calculate the percentage of nucleotide loading capacity. Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose, and the filters were incubated in renaturation solution: phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.5 mm MgCl2, 50 μl of ZnCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 5 mmdithiothreitol (25Ishizaki T. Maekawa M. Fujisawa K. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Fujita A. Watanabe N. Saito Y. Kakizuka A. Morii N. Narumiya S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1885-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar) for 15 h at 4 °C, followed by blocking in 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h. The recombinant, wild-type RhoA, which had previously been determined to have approximately 10% nucleotide loading capacity, was radiolabeled by incubating 10 μm protein with 20 μCi of [α-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol) in PBS with 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mg/ml BSA for 30 min at 30 °C. Nucleotide exchange was stopped by adding 10 mm MgCl2 and placing the reaction on ice. The filters were then incubated in PBS with 10 mm MgCl2 and 2 mg/ml of the radiolabeled RhoA for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by two washes in PBS containing 10 mm MgCl2 at 4 °C. The bound [α-32P]GTP-loaded RhoA was then visualized by autoradiography. For the chimeric protein overlays, equimolar amounts of the HR1PRK1 constructs were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose followed by renaturation and blocking (as above). The nucleotide loading capacity of the Rho/Rac chimeras, as well as the positive and negative controls were determined prior to the overlay, which was carried out exactly as above. BIAcore methodologies employed were as previously published (37Jonsson U. Fagerstam L. Roos H. Ronnberg J. Sjolander S. Stenberg E. Stahlberg C. Urbaniczky C. Ostlin H. Malmqvist M. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 520-527PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at 25 °C and at a constant flow of 5 μl/min in running buffer: phosphate-buffered saline, 10 mm MgCl2. For immobilization of proteins, a carboxymethylated dextran layer on a CM5 sensor chip (Pharmacia) was activated by a 40-μl injection of a 1:1 mixture of 11.5 mg/ml N-hydroxysuccinimide and 75 mg/mlN-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide. Proteins were diluted in coupling buffer (10 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.5) and injected over the activated surface. Excess, uncoupled sites were blocked by an injection of 1 methanolamine. Rho proteins were passed through small desalting columns (NICK columns, Pharmacia) to exchange them into running buffer (as above) and were then injected over the immobilized proteins at a concentration of between 10 and 20 μg/ml. The response was recorded in arbitrary resonance units (RU), and the resulting RUversus time plots were analyzed with the evaluation software supplied with the instrument. Equimolar amounts of the PRK1 GST fusion proteins; HR1abcPRK1, HR1aPRK1, HR1bPRK1, HR1cPRK1, and GST control were bound to glutathione-Sepharose, which was packed into Clontech minicolumns (50-μl bed volume). Any nonspecific sites on either the column or the Sepharose were then blocked by washing the columns with Buffer A: PBS containing 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml BSA, and 0.1 mm GTP or GDP. The recombinant wild type RhoA (10 or 20 μg, as indicated) was loaded with either GTP or GDP by incubation with an excess of the nucleotide in the presence of 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmEDTA, and 1 mg/ml BSA at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 mm MgCl2. The nucleotide-loaded RhoA was applied to the Sepharose columns, and the flow through the columns was blocked for an incubation period of 1 h. The columns were then washed with Buffer A using either 0.4 ml (8 × Sepharose bed volume) for the experiment shown in Fig. 5 A or 0, 0.25, 1.00, and 4.00 ml for the experiment in Fig. 5 B. Proteins were then eluted using 20 mmglutathione. Both the application of the RhoA and the subsequent washes were carried out at 4 °C, whereas the glutathione-dependent elution was performed at room temperature. Samples of the eluate were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted for RhoA. The same procedure was employed for the Caenorhabditis elegans GST-HR1a immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose. PRK1 has been identified as a target for RhoA through yeast two-hybrid analysis and direct protein-protein interaction (see Introduction). To delineate the RhoA binding site on PRK1, attention was focused on the noncatalytic regulatory domain of the protein. We had previously identified two domains in PRK1, HR1 and HR2, based upon conservation with PRK2 (see Fig. 1). The full-length PRK1 as well as these two regulatory domains were expressed, and binding of [32P]GTP-bound RhoA was determined by overlay. Full-length PRK1 itself bound RhoA in this assay as shown in Fig. 2 A. No equivalent binding activity was detected in COS cell extracts from vector-transfected cells. An E. coli-expressed GST fusion of HR1PRK1 also bound RhoA, while GST itself did not (Fig. 2 B). No binding was observed for HR2PRK1 (data not shown). Consistent with the binding activity of the HR1PRK1 domain, the homologous domain from PRK2 was found also to bind RhoA (Fig. 2 B). The specificity with respect to G-protein was tested by comparison with [32P]GTP-bound Rac1 and Cdc42, neither of which were found to bind HR1PRK1effectively (data not shown; see below).Figure 2RhoA binds to PRK1 and PRK2 via the HR1 repeat. Binding of RhoA [α-32P]GTP via ligand overlay assay was assessed for the following. A, full-length PRK1 (amino acids 1–942) transiently overexpressed in COS cells; whole cell lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for the overlay assay. Vector-transfected cell extracts are shown as a control. B, HR1PRK1 (amino acids 1–293) was expressed as a GST fusion protein, HR1PRK2(amino acids 1–380 was a His-ragged construct). The bacterial proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for overlay (see “Experimental Procedures”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Since we had defined the HR1 domain as three consecutive repeats of a ∼100-amino acid motif, these were expressed individually as subdomains, as defined under “Experimental Procedures.” The a, b, and c repeat motifs (denoted HR1aPRK1, etc) were expressed as GST fusion proteins and purified for analysis by overlay. Interestingly, both the HR1aPRK1 and HR1bPRK1GST fusion proteins bound RhoA; no binding was observed for HR1cPRK1 nor for the GST control (Fig. 3 A). The greater sequence similarity between HR1aPRK1 and HR1bPRK1compared with HR1cPRK1 (Fig. 1) is consistent with this pattern of behavior. The RhoA binding property ascribed to both the HR1aPRK1 and HR1bPRK1 repeats suggests that this defines a subdomain that has predictive value for RhoA targets. To test this notion, we identified a C. elegans open reading frame encoding a protein kinase that has an amino-terminal HR1 domain. The HR1a sequence from this gene was cloned, expressed as a GST fusion protein, and purified. This repeat was also found to bind RhoA in an overlay assay (Fig. 3 B). The data indicate that the HR1a repeat provides a useful predictive sequence for the identification of Rho targets. To further characterize the multiple HR1PRK1-RhoA binding sites and define the nucleotide dependence of this interaction, binding was monitored using a BIAcore; this permitted a real time evaluation of RhoA-HR1PRK1 interactions. For these studies, RhoA was loaded with nucleotide immediately prior to use. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the complete HR1PRK1(HR1abc) domain bound RhoA in a GTP-dependent manner. Consistent with the overlay assay, both HR1aPRK1 and HR1bPRK1 but not HR1cPRK1 also bound RhoA. However, in contrast to HR1aPRK1, where binding was completely specific to GTP-RhoA, for HR1bPRK1 a degree of binding over background was observed for GDP-RhoA. There was no specific binding of RhoA (GTP- or GDP-loaded) to the HR1cPRK1 domain when compared with the GST control. While it is possible to obtain kinetic parameters (such as association and dissociation rates) from BIAcore data, a simple correlation between the present data and defined kinetic models for a one- or two-site interaction was not seen. Furthermore, the immobilized ligands were found to be unstable after a few rounds of interaction and regeneration, precluding the determination of equilibrium binding over a range of RhoA concentrations. It should be noted also that the complexity of HR1-RhoA interactions does not reflect mass transport-related distortions as judged by plots of ln(abs dR/dt). Thus, the data indicate that the binding of HR1 and RhoA is not simple in this context. This situation might have arisen from the dimerization state of the immobilized fusion proteins due to their GST tags; however, the observed homooligomerization of the individual HR1 repeats after cleavage from their expression tags 3P. Flynn and P. J. Parker, unpublished observations. precluded the use of cleaved proteins as a means of obtaining a clearer result. Consequently, the comparisons made here are semiquantitative; proteins that give the highest response in RU are presumed to have the highest affinity for the immobilized ligand, i.e.HR1abcPRK1 > HR1aPRK1 > HR1bPRK1≫ HR1cPRK1. This relative efficacy and the nucleotide dependence are consistent with the solution binding studies (see below). To assess further the distinctive nucleotide dependence of HR1 subdomain-RhoA interactions noted on the BIAcore, direct binding and dissociation were monitored for GST-HR1PRK1 constructs immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. Consistent with the binding data above, it was found that immobilized HR1aPRK1 and HR1bPRK1 bound RhoA, while HR1c PRK1 did not. The binding of Rho to the C. elegans HR1a domain was also tested. This HR1aF46F6.2 domain behaved exactly as HR1aPRK1 (see Fig. 6) and was found to display complete GTP dependence for maintenance of RhoA binding (Fig. 5 B). The dissociation of these RhoA complexes was assessed by a sequential washing protocol. The stable association of HR1abcPRK1 to RhoA occurred with a distinct, but not exclusive, preference for the GTP-bound state (Fig. 6). For HR1aPRK1, sequential washing revealed no stable binding of GDP-RhoA, while GTP-RhoA was retained. HR1bPRK1was found to bind stably to GDP-RhoA in addition to GTP-RhoA, with equivalent dissociation after washing with 20 bed volumes (Fig. 6). The different properties of the HR1aPRK1 and HR1bPRK1 in the retention and dissociation of GTP-RhoA and GDP-RhoA are consistent with the BIAcore data. These results demonstrate that although homologous, these HR1 repeats make different contacts with RhoA. Furthermore, it appears that the specific properties of the HR1aPRK1 repeat are retained for HR1aF46F6.2. It is implicit in the conclusions above that HR1aPRK1 and HR1bPRK1 bind distinct sites on RhoA. To establish whether these are overlapping or whether in fact two simultaneous contacts might be made between RhoA and PRK1, “fragmentation” of RhoA was employed through the use of the Rac-Rho chimera. It has been established previously that PRK1 does not bind Rac (1Amano M. Mukai H. Ono Y. Chihara K. Matsui T. Hamajima Y. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 271: 648-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar); however, here a very low level of Rac association with HR1a is reproducibly seen (see below). This degree of binding is mirrored by the Rac143Rho chimera. The chimera were loaded with equal efficiency (see “Experimental Procedures”), demonstrating the integrity of each of the constructs employed. These chimera were assessed for interactions with HR1aPRK1, HR1bPRK1, and HR1cPRK1using an overlay assay, to reduce any influence of the oligomeric state of the HR1 proteins on binding. As shown in Fig. 7 A, it was observed that the Rac-(1–73)/Rho chimera bound only to HR1aPRK1, clearly distinguishing the sites of HR1aPRK1 and HR1bPRK1 binding. The Rac-(1–143)/Rho chimera bound neither HR1aPRK1 nor HR1bPRK1. Expression of the RhoA-(1-73)/Rac chimera did not yield sufficient material for analysis of HR1a/bPRK1 binding due to protein instability; this problem has been noted previously (35Diekmann D. Nobes C.D. Burbelo P.D. Abo A. Hall A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5297-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These observations indicate a site of HR1aPRK1 interaction with RhoA between residues 73 and 143 and suggest that the HR1bPRK1 may interact with RhoA within the amino-terminal 73 amino acids. To further assess the binding of HR1b to the amino-terminal region of RhoA, the “activating” V14RhoA mutant was employed. As shown in Fig. 7 B, the mutant failed to bind HR1b while retaining binding to HR1a. Since HR1b binds GTP-RhoA, the inability of this domain to bind V14RhoA implies a contact within the amino-terminal region close to residue 14 and not a consequence of the activating conformational changes induced by this mutation. Previous studies have identified PRK1 (PKN) as a target for RhoA (1Amano M. Mukai H. Ono Y. Chihara K. Matsui T. Hamajima Y. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 271: 648-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 27Watanabe G. Saito Y. Madaule P. Ishizaki T. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Mukai H. Ono Y. Kakizuka A. Narumiya S. Science. 1996; 271: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) and indeed demonstrated a modest activation of this protein kinase by GTP-RhoA (1Amano M. Mukai H. Ono Y. Chihara K. Matsui T. Hamajima Y. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 271: 648-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The work described here defines a two-site interaction between RhoA and PRK1. Interestingly, the two regions of contact within the PRK1 protein are in the regulatory domain and are defined by the first two HR1 repeats, a and b. Of the three repeats present, these are the two with the most similar amino acid sequences (see Fig. 1). Despite the similarity of the HR1aPRK1 and HR1bPRK1 repeats, these proteins have differing specificities for RhoA; HR1aPRK1 binds to only the GTP-bound form of RhoA, and HR1bPRK1 binds to both GTP- and GDP-bound forms. This implies that within the context of PRK1 itself, HR1aPRK1 makes contact with a conformation determined by GTP binding, while HR1bPRK1 does not. Indeed, the properties of the intact HR1abcPRK1 domain are consistent with this, given its preferential but nonexclusive binding to the GTP-bound form of RhoA. It can be concluded that tight binding of GTP-RhoA for intact PRK1 is effected through the combined contacts of the HR1aPRK1 and HR1bPRK1 motifs. These interactions are summarized in Fig. 8(see below). That HR1abcPRK1 does indeed bind more tightly than either HR1aPRK1 or HR1bPRK1 alone is evidenced by the slower dissociation of RhoA seen for the immobilized HR1 repeats. Precise dissociation rates based upon the BIAcore analysis could not be derived, since the binding data did not fit rigorously the binding models tested. The elucidation of the binding activities of these HR1 repeat motifs indicates that there is indeed a reason for defining these as functional units. Previously, these repeats had been defined only on the basis of conservation between the PRK1 and PRK2 gene products (31Palmer R.H. Ridden J. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The demonstration that the HR1 domain of PRK2 also confers GTP-RhoA binding is entirely consistent with this analysis. Furthermore, the predictive nature of the HR1 repeat motif has been established by demonstration that such a sequence from a C. elegans open reading frame will also bind GTP-RhoA. Similar HR1 repeat sequences are found in numerous other proteins including rhotekin, which interestingly has only the HR1a motif and has been shown to bind Rho in a GTP-dependent manner (26Reid T. Furuyashiki T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Madaule P. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13556-13560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). During revision of this submission, it was reported that PRK2 binds to RhoA in a nucleotide-independent manner (38Vincent S. Settleman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2247-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This is compatible with the finding here that PRK1 also makes a nucleotide-independent contact. However, for the intact RhoA binding domain of PRK1, a relative GTP dependence is observed, demonstrating a significant contribution from the HR1a-RhoA contact; it would appear that in PRK2, the predicted nucleotide-independent contact with the HR1bPRK2 domain is dominant. It is also notable that PRK2 will bind Rac, albeit less effectively than RhoA (38Vincent S. Settleman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2247-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar); the very weak binding of HR1aPRK1 to Rac observed here indicates a similar property for PRK1. It has been reported recently that RhoA binds PRK1 through an amino-terminal region that encompasses the HR1a repeat (27Watanabe G. Saito Y. Madaule P. Ishizaki T. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Mukai H. Ono Y. Kakizuka A. Narumiya S. Science. 1996; 271: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the results here, albeit only a partial solution to the RhoA-PRK1 interaction as defined here. Additionally, Ono and colleagues (39Kitagawa M. Shibata H. Toshimori M. Mukai H. Ono Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 963-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) have provided evidence for a pseudosubstrate motif in the basic region of the HR1a repeat, and it is possible that sequestration of this region alongside the basic region also conserved in the HR1b repeat contributes to the RhoA-dependent activation of PRK1 (see Fig. 8). A notable feature of the PRK1-RhoA interaction is that these homologous repeats within the HR1 domain bind to distinct target sites on RhoA. The RhoA/Rac chimera analysis is consistent with HR1bPRK1interaction with the RhoA amino terminus (residues 1–73) and HR1aPRK1 interaction with RhoA between residues 73 and 143 (see Fig. 7). The RhoA/Rac chimera (i.e. RhoA1–73Rac) that would be predicted to bind HR1bPRK1 but not HR1aPRK1 degrades during purification; hence, it has not proved possible to confirm this prediction. The finding that the V14 point mutant in RhoA fails to bind HR1b while still binding HR1a corroborates the conclusion from the chimera analysis that the HR1b binds to the amino-terminal region of RhoA. Furthermore, the more avid binding of RhoA to HR1abc compared with HR1a or HR1b indicates that both RhoA sites are contacted upon interaction with the intact HR1 domain. It is noteworthy that the binding of HR1abc to GDP-RhoA resembles that of HR1b alone; i.e. a single lower affinity contact is made for GDP-RhoA. While it is concluded that the binding of HR1abc to GTP-RhoA involves both HR1a and HR1b contact, independent proof of this from competition analysis has not been possible, since recombinant HR1a and HR1b domains interact directly in vitro.3 Furthermore, overlapping oligopeptides based upon RhoA covering the entire predicted binding regions for HR1a and HR1b (residues 1–100) are neither able to interact directly nor able to compete for HR1a/HR1b binding to RhoA, indicating that the sites of interaction on RhoA are sensitive to conformational constraints. The site of interaction on RhoA for HR1aPRK1 (amino acids 73–143) overlaps the Switch II region of RhoA, suggesting that this may be involved in the GTP-dependent contact. By contrast, while HR1bPRK1 is predicted to bind to the amino-terminal region of RhoA (amino acids 1–73), the nucleotide dependence of this interaction indicates that the Switch I region is unlikely to be involved. One can speculate that duplication of this HR1 motif has permitted the evolution of a high affinity (two contacts) RhoA binding domain. It is of interest that the interaction of Ras with c-Raf is also thought to operate through two sites (40Ghosh S. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30785-30788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Hu C.D. Kariya K. Tamada M. Akasaka K. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 233-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, in this case the points of contact in the effector (i.e. Raf) are not themselves homologous. A clear precedent for asymmetric interactions of homologous proteins is afforded by the growth hormone receptor; here the two identical receptors contact distinct sites on growth hormone causing dimerization (43Wells J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). In PRK1, there is no evidence for dimerization, and in fact the HR1abcPRK1 domain is likely to form a discrete folded domain, since HR1bPRK1alone behaves as a dimer on gel filtration. 4P. Flynn, unpublished observations. Whether this behavior is consequent upon the predicted leucine zipper that is part of each HR1 repeat motif awaits further analysis. The results described here establish the nature of the RhoA binding site on PRK1 and PRK2. Further, the dissection of this site on PRK1 demonstrates that the strong interaction between regulator (RhoA) and effector (PRK1) is driven by a bipartite interaction involving sequential repeats on PRK1 and distinct regions on RhoA. The actual molecular organization of this interaction will require direct structural analysis. We are indebted to Dr. Alan Hall for the RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42 constructs."

https://openalex.org/W2170900242,"Fibronectin matrix assembly is thought to involve binding interactions between the amino-terminal I1–5repeats and the first type III repeat (III1). Here we report that a third site, located within the III12–14repeats of the carboxyl-terminal heparin II domain of fibronectin, is also involved in fibrillogenesis. Heparin II fragments inhibited fibril formation and binding of 125I-labeled fibronectin and/or 70-kDa fragments to the cell surface, deoxycholate-insoluble matrix, and adsorbed 160-kDa cell adhesion fragments of fibronectin. The inhibitory effects of heparin II fragments were as large or up to 20 times larger than those of a 44-kDa fibronectin fragment containing the III1 repeat. Under physiological conditions, amino-terminal fragments of fibronectin containing the I1–5 repeats interacted preferentially with proteolytically derived heparin II fragments and a recombinant III12–14 peptide both in solution and in solid phase, indicating that matrix assembly may involve direct interactions between I1–5 and III12–14 repeats. Interactions between the I1–5 repeats and 160-kDa fragments containing the III12–14 and III1 repeats could be inhibited by ≥ 90% by either an anti-III13–14 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (IST-2) or an anti-III1 mAb (9D2), suggesting that cooperative interactions between III12–14and III1 repeats may also promote binding of the I1–5 repeats. Neither mAb IST-2 nor mAb 9D2, alone or in combination, inhibited binding of 125I-labeled 70-kDa fragments to cycloheximide-treated cells plated on the 160-kDa substrate, suggesting that additional I1–5 binding sites, independent of the III1 and III12–14 repeats, may be involved in fibrillogenesis.

Under physiological conditions, amino-terminal fragments of fibronectin containing the I1–5 repeats interacted preferentially with proteolytically derived heparin II fragments and a recombinant III12–14 peptide both in solution and in solid phase, indicating that matrix assembly may involve direct interactions between I1–5 and III12–14 repeats. Interactions between the I1–5 repeats and 160-kDa fragments containing the III12–14 and III1 repeats could be inhibited by ≥ 90% by either an anti-III13–14 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (IST-2) or an anti-III1 mAb (9D2), suggesting that cooperative interactions between III12–14and III1 repeats may also promote binding of the I1–5 repeats. Neither mAb IST-2 nor mAb 9D2, alone or in combination, inhibited binding of 125I-labeled 70-kDa fragments to cycloheximide-treated cells plated on the 160-kDa substrate, suggesting that additional I1–5 binding sites, independent of the III1 and III12–14 repeats, may be involved in fibrillogenesis. Fibronectin is required for normal growth and development (1George E.L. Georges-Labouesse E.N. Patel-King R.S. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. Development. 1993; 119: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and plays an important role in regulating cell attachment and movement, wound healing, and tumorigenesis (for review, see Refs. 2Mosher D.F. Fibronectin. Academic Press, New York1989Google Scholar and 3Hynes R.O. Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag, New York1989Google Scholar). It is a 500-kDa disulfide-bonded dimer consisting of similar subunits and is found as a soluble glycoprotein in blood and other body fluids and as an insoluble fibrous matrix component in tissues. Each subunit of fibronectin consists of three different types of repeating sequences, called types I, II, and III, which are arranged into discrete structural and functional modules. Assembly of dimeric fibronectin into the extracellular matrix involves multiple consecutive binding interactions with integrin receptors, with itself, and with matrix components such as type I collagen (for review, see Refs. 4Mosher D.F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 214-222Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 5Peters D.M. Mosher D.F. Yurchenco P. Birk D.E. Mecham R.P. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure.

Although the α5β1 integrin appears to be the primary fibronectin receptor involved in matrix assembly (7Akiyama S.K. Yamada S.S. Chen W.T. Yamada K.M. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19646-19652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), at least two other integrins, αIIbβ3 and αvβ3, can also support fibronectin fibrillogenesis (13Wu C. Keivens V.M. O'Toole T.E. McDonald J.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1995; 83: 715-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 14Wennerberg K. Lohikangas L. Gullberg D. Pfaff M. Johansson S. Fässler R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). High affinity binding interactions between these integrins and the RGD site in the 10th type III repeat (III10) of fibronectin are thought to promote fibrillogenesis by exposing appropriate self-assembly sites in fibronectin. Such sites may become exposed through local integrin-induced conformational changes in III10repeats (15Ugarova T.P. Zamarron C. Veklich Y. Bowditsch R.D. Ginsberg M.H. Weisel J.W. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4457-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) or through integrin-mediated stretching (reversible unfolding) of one or a whole array of type III repeats in fibronectin in response to cell movements (13Wu C. Keivens V.M. O'Toole T.E. McDonald J.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1995; 83: 715-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 16Erickson H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10114-10118Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Self-assembly of fibronectin dimers into fibrils is currently thought to involve primarily interactions between the first five type I repeats (I1–5) and the first type III (III1) repeat (17Hocking D.C. Sottile J. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19183-19191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Aguirre K.M.R. McCormick J. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27863-27868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The I1–5 repeats are critical for matrix assembly, i.e. peptides including these repeats block assembly of fibronectin into fibrils, and fibronectin dimers lacking these repeats will not be incorporated into fibrils (19McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 20Quade B.J. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19602-19609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1463-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 22Sottile J. Schwarzbauer J.E. Selegue J. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12840-12843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The III1 repeats are also important for fibril formation, and either anti-III1 monoclonal antibodies or peptides derived from III1 repeats can block assembly of fibronectin into matrix (23Chernousov M.A. Fogerty F. Koteliansky V.E. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10851-10858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Morla A. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 188: 421-429Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The mechanism, however, by which I1–5-III1 interactions affect matrix assembly remains controversial. For example, Hocking et al. (25Hocking D.C. Smith R.K. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) have shown that III1 repeats will interact not only with I1–5 repeats but also with heat-denatured III10 repeats. They have proposed that the latter interaction activates the III1 repeat thereby allowing it to function as a receptor for the amino termini of a second fibronectin dimer. In contrast, Sechler et al. (26Sechler J.L. Takada Y. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) have shown that fibronectin dimers lacking III1–7 repeats are readily polymerized into fibrils. In fact, the mutated dimers are rendered deoxycholate-insoluble more rapidly than intact dimers, suggesting that III1 repeats do not promote, but rather inhibit matrix assembly by keeping fibronectin in a compact form through intramolecular interactions with I1–5 repeats. Earlier studies by Homandberg and Erickson (27Homandberg G.A. Erickson J.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6917-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) had indicated that another complementary binding site of the I1–5 repeats is located within the III12–14 repeats of the carboxyl-terminal heparin II binding domain of fibronectin, but the functional significance of this site was never investigated. Here we report that the heparin II domain plays an important role in matrix assembly, and we demonstrate that peptides containing the III12–14 repeats specifically block binding of fibronectin and its 70-kDa amino-terminal fragments to cells and their matrix. We also present evidence indicating that the inhibitory effects of the heparin II domain may involve direct interactions between the I1–5 and the III12–14 repeats and that binding of the I1–5 repeats may depend on cooperative interactions between the III12–14 and III1repeats. Finally, the data presented here confirm our earlier report (12Dzamba B.J. Bultmann H. Akiyama S.K. Peters D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19646-19652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and show that the amino terminus participates in additional binding interactions that are independent of either the III1 or the III12–14 repeats. Neonatal human skin fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Binding assays in confluent cultures of matrix-deprived cells were performed as described before (12Dzamba B.J. Bultmann H. Akiyama S.K. Peters D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19646-19652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested with trypsin and EDTA, washed in the presence of soybean trypsin inhibitor, and kept in suspension for 1 h at 21 °C in binding buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 μg/ml cycloheximide, 2 mg/ml BSA, 1The abbreviations used are: BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BS3, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate; mAb, monoclonal antibody; GST, glutathione S-transferase. 100 units/ml penicillin G, 5 μm streptomycin sulfate, and 25 mmHepes, pH 7.4). Cells were then plated in 96-well polystyrene microtiter wells precoated with 40–120 μg/ml of the 160-kDa or 5 μg/ml of the 75-kDa cell adhesion fragments of fibronectin. These coating concentrations had been shown previously to be optimal for cell spreading and binding of 70-kDa fragments (12Dzamba B.J. Bultmann H. Akiyama S.K. Peters D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19646-19652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plates were blocked overnight with 2 mg/ml heat-denatured BSA (5 min at 80 °C). In some experiments, antibodies were added to the cell suspension just before plating. After 3 h at 37 °C, cells were incubated with125I-labeled fibronectin (1 × 107cpm/pmol) or 70-kDa fragments (1.5–3 × 106 cpm/pmol) for 1 or 2 h at 37 °C, and wells were washed, separated, and counted. Binding interactions between ligand and substrate which occur in the absence of cells were also measured in microtiter wells as described previously (12Dzamba B.J. Bultmann H. Akiyama S.K. Peters D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19646-19652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For some of these experiments (see Figs. 6 and 7), the pH of the binding buffer was adjusted to 6.6 with HCl. Nonspecific binding was measured either in wells that had been coated only with the blocking agent (2 mg/ml heat-denatured BSA) or in the presence of a >100-fold excess of unlabeled ligand. Nonspecific binding measured in the presence of excess competitor represented 10–20% and 20–50% of total binding in the presence and absence of cells, respectively, and was independent of the addition of any of the antibodies.Figure 7Comparison of 29-, 40-, and 70-kDa amino-terminal fragments binding to adsorbed heparin II-binding fragments. 125I-Labeled 29-kDa (18.3 nm or 2.3 × 105 cpm/well) (○), 70-kDa fragments (11.9 nm or 5.3 × 105 cpm/well) (•), or 40-kDa gelatin-binding fragments (12.3 nm or 3.7 × 105 cpm/well) (▵) were incubated at pH 6.6 for 4 h at 37 °C in microtiter wells coated with increasing concentrations of heparin II-binding fragments. The data have been normalized to a ligand input of 10 nm, and they represent the means of triplicate measurements. Bars indicate the S.E. Curves are third order regression lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Cells were plated at confluence and maintained in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum for 3 days. Cells plated in 35-mm dishes were then incubated with 0.1 nm125I-fibronectin (1 × 106 cpm/ml) in 0.25 ml of binding buffer, pH 7.4, for 2 h at 37 °C with gentle rocking. Cells plated in 60-mm dishes were incubated with 0.75 nm125I-labeled 70-kDa fragments (2 × 106 cpm/ml) in 1 ml of binding buffer, pH 7.4, for 4 h at 37 °C with gentle rocking. The cells were washed five times with binding buffer and lysed at 4 °C with 1% deoxycholate in hypotonic buffer (1.5 ml/dish 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, containing 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin) and scraped from the dishes. The deoxycholate-soluble cellular fraction (pool I) and insoluble matrix fraction (pool II) were separated by centrifugation at 35,000 × g as described (28McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The deoxycholate-insoluble material was washed with 1% deoxycholate in hypotonic buffer and recentrifuged. All operations were done at 4 °C. Adherent matrices were prepared from fibroblast cultures that had been plated at confluence in 60-mm dishes and maintained in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum for 3 days. Cells were lysed with 1% deoxycholate in hypotonic buffer for 5 min (28McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The lysates in the plates were treated with DNase I (50 units/ml; Sigma), MgCl2, and CaCl2 (5 mg/ml each) in hypotonic buffer for 15 min, and the plates were rinsed with hypotonic buffer followed by binding buffer. The fibrous matrices, prepared in this way at 21 °C, remained firmly attached to the dishes in subsequent binding assays. Binding assays using isolated matrices were done as described above for intact cell layers. Binding reactions in solution were carried out at 21 °C by mixing 0.3–1.8 pmol of the125I-ligand (3–16 × 105 cpm/pmol) with 25 pmol of biotinylated 70-kDa fragments in 240 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 0.08 mNaCl (PBS) in the absence or presence of 1 mg/ml bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3; Pierce). After 30 min, the cross-linker was inactivated by adding 27 μl of 1.5 m glycine, pH 7.4. Twenty min later 11 μl of 50 mm BSA was added. From each reaction vial, 250 μl was transferred to a new vial containing 6 μl of packed streptavidin-conjugated agarose beads (1.2 mg streptavidin/ml; Sigma) and 40 μl of packed Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The agarose beads and Sepharose were preblocked with 2 mg/ml BSA in PBS to reduce nonspecific binding. Binding to the beads was carried out at 21 °C for 1 h on an end-over-end rotator. The beads were then sedimented, washed three times with 1 ml of PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and counted in a γ counter. In each case, BS3-dependent as well as BS3-independent binding increased linearly with the concentration of the ligand (data not shown). Fig. 1 illustrates the fragments used in this study. Human plasma fibronectin and its 29-kDa (type I1–5repeats), 40-kDa (type I6–I9 repeats), 70-kDa (type I1–I9 repeats), and 160-kDa (type III1–III14 repeats) proteolytic fragments were prepared as described before (29Mosher D.F. Proctor R.B. Science. 1980; 209: 927-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 30Mosher D.F. Johnson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6001-6595Google Scholar, 31Peters D.M.P. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal heparin II-binding fragments were isolated from a catheptic D digest of plasma fibronectin, from which gelatin-binding fragments (notably the 70-kDa fragment) had been removed by first passing the digest over on a gelatin-Sepharose column. The flow-through from the gelatin-Sepharose column was then passed through a heparin-agarose column, and the bound material was eluted with increasing concentrations of NaCl (70–600 mm in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis and Western blots indicated that the carboxyl-terminal heparin-binding fragments were included in the last peak eluted from the column. This peak contained five fragments (65, 46, 43, 41, and 39 kDa). None of these fragments contained the COOH-terminal disulfide bond. Calculations of molar concentrations are based on the weighed average molecular mass of these fragments (50 kDa). The 44- and 75-kDa fragments were obtained by digesting reduced and alkylated plasma fibronectin with 10 μg of tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin/mg of fibronectin for 30 min at 37 °C and separating the resulting fragments on a Sephacryl S-300 column (Pharmarcia) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4. The 44-kDa fragments were purified further on a heparin-agarose column to remove traces of contaminating material reacting with mAb IST-2. All fragments were characterized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blots, and direct or competitive enzyme-linked immunoassays. The large 160-kDa cell adhesion fragment was recognized by mAbs 9D2 (anti-III1), C6F10(anti-III8–11), and IST-2 (anti-III13–14) but not by IST-7 (anti-III15), whereas the smaller 75-kDa cell adhesion fragment was recognized by C6F10 only. The 44-kDa fragment was recognized by 9D2 but not by L8 (anti-I9-III1) or C6F10. None of the four antibodies recognized the amino-terminal 29-, 40-, and 70-kDa fragments. All of the COOH-terminal heparin-binding fragments, except for the 43-kDa fragment, were recognized by mAbs IST-2 and IST-7. None of these COOH-terminal fragments was recognized by the mAbs C6F10 and 9D2. All fragments were iodinated with carrier-free Na125I by the chloramine-T method (32Greenwood F.C. Hunter W.M. Glover J.S. Biochem. J. 1963; 89: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (6740) Google Scholar). These radioiodinated probes were also used to measured adsorption and desorption of fibronectin fragments in microtiter wells. Biotinylated 70-kDa fragments were prepared using Enzotin (NZM Biochem, New York) as described by the manufacturer. The mAbs L8, 9D2, and C6F10 were provided by Dr. Deane Mosher, University of Wisconsin. The mAbs IST-2 and IST-7 were obtained from Dr. Luciano Zardi, Instituto Nationale per La Ricera Sul Cancro. The antibodies were concentrated by precipitation with 30% ammonium sulfate and/or solvent extraction with flakes of polyethylene glycol followed by dialysis against 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl. IgG concentrations were determined by using a mouse IgG kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Human full-length fibronectin cDNA, pFH100 (33Dufour S. Gutman A. Bois F. Lamb N. Thiery J.P. Kornblihtt A.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 193: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), was used as a template for polymerase chain reaction amplification (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 14.14-14.19Google Scholar) of a DNA sequence (bases 5072–5923) encoding the III12–14repeats of fibronectin (amino acid Glu1687 through Pro1970). The DNA was generously provided by Dr. Deane Mosher (who received it from Dr. Jean Paul Thiery, CNRS URA, Paris). The bases are numbered starting with the G before the first codon of the first amino acid of the mature protein (GenBankTMaccession no. X02761), and the amino acids are numbered starting with the pyroglutamic acid (35Kornblihtt A.R. Umezawa K. Vibe-Petersen K. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1755-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). This region spans the entire length of the III12–14 repeats and also includes 3 amino acids upstream of the III12 repeat (QST) as well as 10 amino acids downstream of the III14 repeat (DELPQLVTLP). The sense primer, 5′-GAATTCCAGTCCACAGCTATTCCTG, generated anEcoRI site (in boldface), whereas the antisense primer, 5′-CTCGAG CTATGGAAGGGTTACCAGTTG, generated anXhoI site (in boldface) and also introduced a stop codon (underlined). The polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA was purified using the WizardTM PCR Preps DNA Purification System (Promega, Madison, WI) and subsequently ligated into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The pGEM-T vector containing the insert was transfected through electroporation (ElectroCell Manipulator 600 BTX Electroporation System) into JM109 bacteria. The pGEM-T vectors containing the appropriate sized insert were digested with EcoRI and XhoI, and the cDNA fragment encoding the III12–14 repeats was gel purified using the WizardTM PCR Preps DNA Purification System. This purified DNA fragment was then cloned in-frame into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-4T1 (Pharmacia) and electroporated as described above. Expression of the glutathione S-transferase fusion peptide (GST-III12–14 repeats) was confirmed using Western blot analysis with mAb IST-2. The GST-III12–14 fusion peptide was purified using modifications of the procedure described previously (36Peters D.M.P. Kintner R.L. Steger C.A. Bultmann K. Brandt C.R. Investig. Opthalmol. Visual Sci. 1996; 37: 2047-2059PubMed Google Scholar). The modifications included adding 1 mm Pefabloc®SC (Boehringer Mannheim) and lysing the cells with a French press followed by sonication (three cycles of 10 s each). The fusion peptide was adsorbed to glutathione-Sepharose 6B beads (Pharmacia) and digested overnight at 4 °C with thrombin (10 NIH units/500 ml of original culture). The beads were removed by centrifugation at 250 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing the cleaved peptide was incubated with p-aminobenzamidine Sepharose 6B beads (Sigma) for 20 min at 4 °C to remove thrombin. The beads were removed by centrifugation at 250 × gfor 5 min, and the recombinant III12–14 peptide in the final supernatant was concentrated on flakes of polyethylene glycol and dialyzed into PBS. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blots showed that the recombinant III12–14 peptide migrated as a doublet (∼29-kDa) and was recognized by the mAb IST-2 (data not shown). Western blot analysis using a goat anti-GST serum (gift from Dr. James Tracy, University of Wisconsin, Madison) showed that the recombinant peptide did not contain any uncleaved fusion peptide or GST (data not shown). Teflon® coated 12-well slides (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) were precoated for 2 h at 21 °C with 20 μg/ml of the 160-kDa fragment of fibronectin in Hanks' balanced salt solution. Fibroblasts suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 7.5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 5 μm streptomycin sulfate were plated at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well and incubated at 37 °C to allow the cells to attach. After 1 h, the medium was replaced with serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 2 mg/ml BSA, 25 μg/ml cycloheximide, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 5 μm streptomycin sulfate), and the cells were allowed to spread for 3 h at 37 °C. The medium was removed again and replaced with fresh serum-free medium containing 1 μg/ml human plasma fibronectin. In some wells, either the 70-kDa (93 μg/ml) or heparin II-containing fragments (200 μg/ml) were added as inhibitors. Fibroblasts were kept overnight at 37 °C, washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 for 30 min at 21 °C. Fibronectin fibrils were labeled with a polyclonal anti-fibronectin serum as described previously (37Dzamba B.J. Wu H. Jaenisch R. Peters D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1165-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and viewed by epifluorescence with a Nikon Optiphot microscope. Images were digitized using a Photometrics Image Point®CCD camera and Image Pro Plus® program. Earlier studies by Homandberg and Erickson (27Homandberg G.A. Erickson J.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6917-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) had indicated that the heparin II binding domain of fibronectin may contain an amino-terminal binding site. Because an amino-terminal binding site in the III1 repeat of fibronectin had been shown to play an important role in the assembly of fibronectin into fibrils (17Hocking D.C. Sottile J. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19183-19191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Aguirre K.M.R. McCormick J. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), we wanted to know whether the heparin II binding domain of fibronectin also participates in fibrillogenesis. To examine this question, cycloheximide-treated fibroblasts capable of assembling exogenous plasma fibronectin into fibrils (38Peters D.M.P. Portz L.M. Fullenwider J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) were tested for their ability to assemble plasma fibronectin into fibrils in the presence, or absence, of proteolytically derived fragments of fibronectin. In the absence of any fibronectin fragments, numerous fibronectin fibrils were observed in these cultures (arrowheads, Fig. 2 a). If, however, fragments of fibronectin containing the heparin II domain were added, fibril formation was inhibited completely (Fig. 2 c), indicating that the heparin II domain may indeed play a role in fibrillogenesis. The 70-kDa amino-terminal fragment of fibronectin, as expected (19McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar,39McDonald J.A. Quade B.J. Broekelmann T.J. LaChance R. Forsman K. Hasegawa E. Akiyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2957-2967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also blocked incorporation of exogenous fibronectin into matrices (Fig. 2 b). The inhibitory effect of the heparin II domain on fibrillogenesis was confirmed biochemically using the matrix assembly assay described by McKeown-Longo and Mosher (19McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 28McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In this assay, incorporation of125I-fibronectin into the deoxycholate-insoluble matrix (pool II) was inhibited with increasing concentrations of unlabeled 70-kDa fragments (Fig. 3). The IC50 of the inhibition was 1.0 μm. At 10-fold higher concentrations, fragments containing the III12–14repeats were equally effective inhibitors (IC50 = 10 μm). The 44-kDa fragment containing the III1–4 repeats was also inhibitory at these higher concentrations, however it never blocked incorporation of125I-fibronectin by more than 40%. In contrast, 75-kDa fragments containing the III5–10 repeats or BSA had little (20%) or no inhibitory effects. Fragments containing the heparin II binding domain also inhibited binding of 125I-fibronectin to the cell surface in confluent cell layers of matrix-deprived cycloheximide-treated fibroblasts plated on the 75-kDa cell adhesion fragment of fibronectin (12Dzamba B.J. Bultmann H. Akiyama S.K. Peters D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19646-19652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 A, the 70-kDa fragment was again the most effective inhibitor (IC50 = 0.1 μm) followed by the heparin II (IC50 = 3 μm) and the 44-kDa (IC50 ≈ 20 μm) fragments. The 75-kDa fragment and BSA had little or no inhibitory effect. Thus, under physiological conditions, III12–14-containing fragments inhibited binding of 125I-fibronectin to cell layers at least"

It is effectively regulated by the external osmolality both on the level of expression and of activity. BetP carries highly charged domains both at the N and at the C terminus. We investigated the role of these extensions in the regulatory response to hyperosmotic stress. Mutants of the betP gene coding for proteins with truncated N- and C-terminal extensions were expressed in the C. glutamicum betP deletion strain DHP1 and were functionally characterized with respect to regulation of activity. The optimum of activation at 1.3 osmol/kg in wild type was shifted in the recombinant strains to about 2.6 osmol/kg in mutants with deletions in the N-terminal part. Deletions in the C-terminal domain resulted in a complete loss of regulation. The altered response to changes in osmolality led to severe consequences in the cellular adaption to hyperosmotic stress. Whereas in the wild type, the steady state level of glycine betaine accumulation is maintained by activity regulation of the BetP system itself, in the mutant with BetP proteins carrying truncations in the C-terminal domain, the observed steady state betaine accumulation was found to be due to a kinetic balance of unregulated glycine betaine uptake by the modifed BetP and efflux via the mechanosensitive efflux channel for compatible solutes at the same time.

Bacterial membranes are readily permeable to water but constitute an effective barrier to most other solutes. An increase in the external osmolality thus leads to instant efflux of water and to a decrease in cell turgor. To avoid dehydration of the cytoplasm, bacteria have developed adaptation mechanisms to hyperosmotic stress, both long term responses, manifested during growth at high osmolality, and short term responses, which occur instantly after changes in the external osmolality (1Yantzey P.H.

A general defense mechanism against high osmolality is the uptake and accumulation of compatible solutes like glycine betaine, proline, or ectoine. Unlike other solutes, these substances do not interfer with vital cellular functions when present at high concentration. The uptake of compatible solutes is mediated by transport systems that are regulated in dependent of the change in external osmolality. Mechanisms and systems of osmo-adaption have been intensively studied in the Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. Two uptake systems for compatible solutes have been identified in these organisms, namely the binding protein-dependent transporter ProU and the secondary carrier ProP. Whereas ProU is regulated both on the level of transcription and activity (4Cairney J. Booth I.R. Higgins C.F. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 1224-1232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Lucht J.M. Bremer E. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 14: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), ProP is mainly regulated on the activity level (6Cairney J. Booth I.R. Higgins C.F. J.

Another well studied organism in this respect is the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis. In this organism, glycine betaine is taken up via three osmo-regulated transport systems, belonging either to the ABC-type or to the class of secondary carriers (9Kappes R. Kempf B. Bremer E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5071-5079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kempf B. Bremer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16701-16713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 11Lin Y. Hansen J.N. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6874-6880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of these transport systems in various organisms was studied in detail on the genetic level; however, less information is available concerning their regulation on the level of activity (12Culham E.D. Lasby B. Marangoni A.G. Milner J.L. Steer B.A. van Nues R.W. Wood J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Corynebacterium glutamicum carries several osmo-responsive uptake systems for compatible solutes. The specific, high affinity glycine betaine transporter BetP was cloned and sequenced (13Peter H. Burkovski A. Krämer R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5229-5234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its function and its response to osmotic changes has been analyzed in detail (14Farwick M. Siewe R.M. Krämer R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4690-4695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, further osmo-regulated uptake systems for compatible solutes have been identified (15Peter H. Bader A. Burkovski A. Lambert C. Krämer R. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 168: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). As for other bacteria, however, nothing is known so far about the mechanism of osmo-sensing and regulation on the activity level that triggers the immediate response of the carrier protein to osmotic stress. In the present communication we report molecular studies on the mechanism of osmo-sensing by the glycine betaine uptake system BetP of C. glutamicum. It has been shown that BetP is effectively regulated in dependence of external osmolality. Whereas the carrier is completely inactive under isoosmotic conditions, its activity increases on hyperosmotic stress in a time range of seconds or less (14Farwick M. Siewe R.M. Krämer R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4690-4695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A similar regulation pattern, although shifted in its optimum, was observed after expression of betP in E. coli(13Peter H. Burkovski A. Krämer R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5229-5234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We thus concluded that BetP functions not only as an osmo-regulated carrier but also as a sensor of osmotic stress. The secondary structure of BetP was predicted to carry two extensions at the cytoplasmic face, a negatively charged N-terminal and a positively charged C-terminal extension (13Peter H. Burkovski A. Krämer R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5229-5234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The function of these domains in sensing osmotic stress was studied by construction of deletion mutants and functional characterization of the gene products. The bacterial strains and plasmids used are described in Table I. E. coli strain DH5αmcr was grown at 37 °C in Luria Bertani (LB) medium (16Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J.

Plasmid DNA was isolated using the QIAGEN plasmid kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, FRG). E. coli was transformed using standard methods (18Chung C.T. Niemela S.L. Miller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2172-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). To make C. glutamicum competent, strains were grown in LB in the presence of 0.4% isonicotinic acid hydrazide, 2.5% glycine, and 0.1% Tween 80 (19Liebl W. Bayerl A. Schein B. Stillner U. Schleifer K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1989; 65: 299-304Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cells were washed four times with ice-cold 10% glycerol. Transformation was carried out by electroporation (19Liebl W. Bayerl A. Schein B. Stillner U. Schleifer K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1989; 65: 299-304Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cells were immediately transferred to BHI medium containing 0.5 msorbitol (19Liebl W. Bayerl A. Schein B. Stillner U. Schleifer K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1989; 65: 299-304Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar), incubated for 1 h at 30 °C in a shaking flask, and plated on BHI medium containing 20 mg/liter kanamycin. Restriction enzymes, DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment), proteinase K, RNase, and T4 DNA ligase were obtained from Boehringer, Mannheim (Federal Republic of Germany (FRG)) or from Promega (Heidelberg, FRG) and used as recommended by the manufacturers. Restriction analyses were carried out by separation of DNA fragments in 0.8% agarose gels. DNA fragments were isolated by use of QIAex (QIAGEN, Hilden, FRG). For DNA sequencing, the automated laser fluorescence DNA sequencer from Pharmacia (Freiburg, FRG) was used. Sequence reactions were carried out using the AutoRead Sequencing kit (Pharmacia). Deletion mutants were constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification using Taqpolymerase (Boehringer, Mannheim) and a Thermo-Cycler 480 (Perkin-Elmer). The primers are listed in Table II. A denaturating temperature of 94 °C for 30 s, an annealing time of 30 s, and an extension temperature of 72 °C for 120 s was used for 30 cycles (Table II). Each primer was added to a final concentration of 10 pm. As template, plasmid pHP2 was used in a final concentration of 1 nm. Polymerase chain reaction products were ligated to the vector pUC18/SmaI using the ochre codon directly after the SmaI site as a stop signal. All clones were sequenced to verify the desired mutation, and correct mutants were ligated with the IPTG-inducible plasmid pEKEX2 using the BamHI/EcoRI restriction sites.Table IIPrimers and annealing temperatures for constructing deletion mutants of betPClonePrimer 1Primer 2Annealing temperatureGTG5′-GTGAGTTTTATGACTACATCTGAC-3′5′-CTATCGACGCTTCCCCGCG-3′64 °CN05′-ATGTCAGTCATCGTTCCAGCC-3′5′-CTATCGACGCTTCCCCGCG-3′64 °CN15′-ATGGAAGGCGAAGACACCCAG-3′5′-CTATCGACGCTTCCCCGCG-3′64 °CN25′-ATGCCAACTAACCTGGAAGG-3′5′-CTATCGACGCTTCCCCGCG-3′62 °CN35′-ATGACCGCAACCGAAGAACTG-3′5′-CTATCGACGCTTCCCCGCG-3′64 °CC05′-GTCCTTGACTAACGCAAACATC-3′5′-GTGAGTTTTATGACTACATCTGAC-3′62 °CC15′-AAGGCGCGCGTTGAAGCG-3′5′-GTGAGTTTTATGACTACATCTGAC-3′60 °CC25′-GTGAACACGACGTTCACGG-3′5′-GTGAGTTTTATGACTACATCTGAC-3′60 °CC35′-GCGTCGCTTTGCAGCCAG-3′5′-GTGAGTTTTATGACTACATCTGAC-3′60 °CC0N05′-ATGTCAGTCATCGTTCCAGCC-3′5′-GTCCTTGACTAACGCAAACATC-3′62 °CC1N05′-ATGTCAGTCATCGTTCCAGCC-3′5′-AAGGCGCGCGTTGAAGCG-3′62 °CC2N05′-ATGTCAGTCATCGTTCCAGCC-3′5′-GTGAACACGACGTTCACGG-3′62 °C Open table in a new tab Synthesis of [14C]glycine betaine by oxidation of [14C]choline (specific activity 52 μCi/μmol) using choline oxidase was performed as described earlier (20Landfald B. Strøm A.R. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). To dilute the ethanolic [14C]choline solution, the volume was increased to 500 μl and 30 units of choline oxidase were used. Radiolabeled [14C]choline was purchased from Amersham International (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK). C. glutamicum cells were grown overnight in BHI medium. IPTG (0.2 mm) was added when indicated. The cells were washed with buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) and 10 mm NaCl, energized with 10 mm glucose, and, where indicated, osmotically stressed by the addition of solutes, e.g. NaCl or sorbitol for 3 min at 30 °C. For determination of the Na+ affinity, cells were washed with 50 mmmorpholine propanesulfonic acid (MOPS)-KOH buffer (pH 7.0), resuspended, and measured in the same buffer containing 10 mm glucose. The osmolality in the uptake assay was adjusted to 600 mosmol/kg by the addition of sorbitol. Uptake was started by adding [14C]glycine betaine (0.1 μCi/ml) at a final concentration of 100 or 200 μm. Aliquots of 200 μl were transferred to glass fiber filters (type F, 0.45 μm pore size, Millipore, Eschborn, FRG) at time intervals of 15 or 30 s. At least five samples at different times were taken for each uptake measurement. The filters were washed twice with 2.5 ml of 0.1m LiCl solution, and the radioactivity retained on the filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting. We recently characterized the glycine betaine uptake system BetP of C. glutamicum as being strongly regulated on the level of activity by the external NaCl concentration (14Farwick M. Siewe R.M. Krämer R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4690-4695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For a more general analysis with respect to the question of whether BetP is regulated by the external osmolality and/or by the ionic strength, we compared betaine uptake of C. glutamicumwild type strain ATCC 13032 independent of either NaCl or sorbitol (Fig. 1 A). The regulation pattern was identical in the two experiments, indicating that in fact the change in osmolality is the true signal for carrier activation. To exclude a general salt effect on transport systems, the activity of the related Na+-dependent proline uptake system PutP is also shown in Fig. 1 A as a control (15Peter H. Bader A. Burkovski A. Lambert C. Krämer R. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 168: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have previously shown that the major driving force, i.e. the membrane potential, is not significantly changed under these conditions (14Farwick M. Siewe R.M. Krämer R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4690-4695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For a more fundamental approach, we investigated whether the change in the physical state of the membrane (mechanostress) is the direct signal for carrier activation. We applied a method known from biophysical studies on membranes, i.e. the addition of local anesthetics, to influence the membrane tension in a defined manner (21Bottner M. Winter R. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 2041-2046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22Hornby A.P. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys.

Hirokawa K. Nakashima K. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For this purpose, the influence of tetracaine on betaine uptake in the wild type strain C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 as well as in the betP deletion strain DHP1 was determined (Fig. 1 B). The osmolality was adjusted with NaCl to a final value of 400, 650, or 1,000 mosmol/kg, respectively, and tetracaine was varied from 0 to 1.25 mm. Whereas at 400 mosmol/kg the uptake activity of the wild type reached its optimum between 0.5 and 0.75 mm added tetracaine, no increase in activity was observed in strain DHP1. At higher osmolalities (650 and 1,000 mosmol/kg) the tetracaine-induced increase in uptake activity of the wild type was less pronounced and reached optimal values between 0.75 and 1 mm tetracaine. The results of Fig. 1 Bdemonstrate that BetP can be stimulated by the addition of tetracaine alone and this stimulation is related to the activation of the carrier protein by hyperosmotic stress. From the nucleotide sequence of the betP gene, a protein of 595 amino acids was derived that shares a high degree of identity to two other osmotically regulated bacterial carriers, OpuD of B. subtilis and BetT of E. coli (9Kappes R. Kempf B. Bremer E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5071-5079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lamark T. Kaasen I. Eshoo M.W. Falkenberg P. Mc Dougall J. Strøm A.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1049-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The secondary structure prediction (PHDhtmtop program; EMBL, Heidelberg, FRG) of these three proteins revealed a common structure of 12 transmembrane segments as well as a common hydrophilic C-terminal extension. In contrast to the other two carriers, BetP possesses an additional hydrophilic N-terminal domain, which is longer than the C-terminal one. Interestingly, the two hydrophilic domains, which are predicted to face the cytoplasm, are both highly charged; however, with different polarity. Whereas 15 negatively charged and only two positively charged residues are located within the 62 amino acids of the N-terminal part, 21 positively charged and 8 negatively charged amino acid residues are located within the 55 amino acid residues of the C-terminal domain (Fig. 2). We investigated the role of these two extensions in osmo-sensing and regulation by constructing mutant genes of betP coding for proteins with deletions in one or both extensions. The two domains were truncated stepwise, resulting in four mutants of each domain. In the case of a full deletion of the extensions (C0 and N0) only two and three amino acid residues, respectively, were left in front of the first putative transmembrane segment or at the end of the last segment. In addition, three double mutants lacking the N-terminal and part or all of the C-terminal domain were constructed (C0N0, C1N0, C2N0) (Fig. 2). The C. glutamicum betP deletion mutant DHP1 showed a reduced betaine uptake rate of about 10% that of the wild type, which is due to at least one additional osmo-regulated uptake system (15Peter H. Bader A. Burkovski A. Lambert C. Krämer R. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 168: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In contrast to specific uptake via BetP, betaine uptake by the additional transport system(s) was competitively inhibited by ectoine or proline. To discriminate the activity of the mutant BetP proteins in C. glutamicum DHP1, we tested betaine uptake of strain DHP1/pGTG carrying the wild typebetP gene and of strain DHP1/pEKEX2 (vector without insert) in the absence and presence of ectoine (Fig. 3). Betaine uptake of the betPdeletion strain DHP1/pEKEX2 was completely abolished by the addition of ectoine in 100-fold excess. In contrast, strain DHP1/pGTG showed high betaine uptake in the presence of ectoine, the activity of which depended on the external osmolality exactly as in C. glutamicum wild type. Thus, the betaine uptake observed in the presence of a 100-fold excess of ectoine represents the activity of BetP only. These conditions were used in all further measurements. Fig. 4 shows betaine uptake of the various plasmid-encoded BetP mutant carrier proteins in the presence of unlabeled ectoine in comparison to strain DHP1/pGTG. All BetP proteins with deletions in the N-terminal extension were active; however, the regulation pattern was altered. Whereas the wild type reached its maximum activity at 600 mm NaCl (corresponding to 1.35 osmol/kg), the optimal activation of the proteins with N-terminal deletions was shifted to higher values. All mutant proteins behaved similarly and reached their maximum of activity at osmolalities 2-fold higher than that of the wild type. Fig. 4 B summarizes the uptake rates of proteins with truncated C-terminal part. Strain DHP1/pC0 completely lacking the extension was not active at all. The activity of all other C-terminal deletion mutants increased with increasing NaCl, similar to the wild type. However, the optimum activity was shifted to lower NaCl concentrations of about 200 mm. Furthermore, uptake activity of strains DHP1/pC1 and DHP1/pC2 did not decrease as strongly as the wild type activity at higher NaCl concentrations but remained nearly constant between 200 and 1,500 mm NaCl. For further analysis, double mutants were constructed with deletions in both, the C- and the N-terminal domains. As expected, strain DHP1/pC0N0, i.e. the mutant protein with deletion of both extensions, was not active, as was strain DHP1/pC0 (Fig. 4 C). The double mutants DHP1/pC1N0 and DHP1/pC2N0 were active in transport and behaved similar to the corresponding C-terminal deletion mutants DHP1/pC1 and DHP1/pC2. Glycine betaine uptake via the BetP system is coupled to symport of two Na+ ions (14Farwick M. Siewe R.M. Krämer R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4690-4695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a consequence, Na+ acts on betaine transport both as cosubstrate and as osmo-stimulants. To discriminate between the two effects, we measured betaine uptake at a constant NaCl concentration of 50 mmand varied the external osmolality with sorbitol. 50 mmNaCl does not stimulate uptake in the wild type and is not sufficient to fully stimulate uptake in the respective BetP mutants. Fig. 5 shows the uptake activities of strains DHP1/pC1, DHP1/pC2, and DHP1/pC1N0 in comparison to strain DHP1/pGTG. Whereas the wild type carrier was stimulated by sorbitol similar as observed for NaCl, the mutant strains did not respond to the change in osmolality. High sorbitol concentrations led to a decrease of glycine betaine uptake in strains DHP1/pC1 and DHP1/pC1N0, whereas uptake of strain DHP1/pC2 remained constant. Consequently, the data of Fig. 4 B must be re-interpreted. Stimulation of uptake activity of the proteins C1 and C2 at low NaCl concentrations between 10 and 200 mm must in fact be caused by the increasing concentration of Na+ ions but not by the increase in osmolality. It could be argued that the initial stimulation by 50 mmNaCl is not due to the availability of Na+ ions specifically but to the change in ionic strength. We thus measured uptake activity of the C-terminal mutants at increasing NaCl concentration (10–150 mm) and adjusted the ionic strength by KCl to a constant salt concentration of 1,200 mm. Whereas the wild type and the C3 mutant reached their full activity below 50 mm NaCl, the activity of the C1 mutant increased up to 100 mm NaCl (data not shown). These results indicate that neither the increase in osmolality nor in ionic strength is responsible for uptake stimulation in these mutants. Consequently, the Na+ affinity of the C1 mutant must be altered as compared with the wild type. To determine the Na+ affinity of the mutants we adjusted the osmolality of the assays by sorbitol to a constant value of 600 mosmol/kg and varied NaCl in the range of 1–150 mm (Fig. 6). The Na+ dependence of strain DHP1/pC3 did not differ significantly from the wild type, whereas the affinity toward Na+ was decreased in strains DHP1/pC1 and DHP1/pC2, corroborating the results of Fig. 5. The dependence of uptake activity on Na+ was found to be sigmoidal in shape. However, when the results of all four strains are analyzed according to the Hill equation, irrespective of the significantly changed affinity for Na+, the best fit for the value of (Hill)n actually lies between 2.2 and 2.35 in all four cases (plot not shown). For a further characterization of the mutant proteins, the Km values for glycine betaine were determined also (Table III). Except for strains DHP1/pC1 and DHP1/pC1N0, Km was not altered as compared with the wild type. Strains DHP1/pC1 and DHP1/pC1N0 showed a 6- to 10-fold lowered substrate affinity; however, the uptake rate of these strains was quite low, thereby rendering the discrimination against additional betaine uptake systems by use of the competitor ectoine problematic. The Vmax values of uptake of the other strains varied from 35 to 61 nmol·min−1·(mg of dry weight)−1. Despite various attempts, we did not succeed in obtaining a specific antiserum against BetP. Thus, we could not decide whether the differences in the maximum rates resulted from a different degree of expression or whether they were caused by the mutations directly. Consequently, in contrast to the Kmvalues, the observed maximum rates are not a meaningful characterization of the different mutant strains.Table IIIKinetic constants of glycine betaine transportStrainKmVmaxμmnmol⋅min−1⋅(mg dry weight)−1ATCC 130328.6 ± 0.4110DHP1/pGTG7.9 ± 0.635DHP1/pC152 ± 7.611.7DHP1/pC27.7 ± 0.441.2DHP1/pC36.2 ± 0.546.5DHP1/pN09.5 ± 0.461DHP1/pC1N094 ± 143.2DHP1/pC2N07.9 ± 0.837 Open table in a new tab So far we have used initial uptake rates to characterize the various mutant carrier proteins. To test whether the regulation under steady state conditions is changed in the mutant proteins, betaine uptake was analyzed under equilibrium conditions by measuring the internal [14C]glycine betaine for 2.5 h after a hyperosmotic shift in strain DHP1/pC2 as compared with the wild type (Fig. 7, A and B). Both strains accumulated betaine until a steady state was reached at about 1 h, whereafter internal betaine remained virtually constant (130 mm for DHP1/pGTG and 210 mm for DHP1/pC2). The observed steady state can be explained by at least three different models. (i) The activity of BetP is switched off when the internal osmolality matches that of the medium, (ii) BetP remains active, and the observed constant concentration of betaine is the sum of uptake and efflux via BetP, (iii) BetP remains active, and the observed constant internal label is the sum of the uptake activity of BetP and the efflux via another system. Recently we have shown that C. glutamicum is able to release compatible solutes via stretch-activated (mechanosensitive) channels which are tightly regulated under hypoosmotic conditions (outside low) (27Ruffert S. Lambert C. Peter H. Wendisch V.F. Krämer R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 572-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We did not find any indication for a betaine efflux carrier, as reported for Lactobacillus plantarum (28Glaasker E. Konings W.N. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10060-10065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To discriminate between the three different possibilities, we added unlabeled betaine in 33-fold excess to cells 1.5 h after the addition of labeled betaine, i.e. after the steady state of betaine accumulation had been reached (Fig. 7). The addition of 50 mm unlabeled substrate did not lead to a major decrease of internal label in strain DHP1/pGTG. The low efflux of glycine betaine thus indicates that both the reverse reaction of BetP and the activity of a putative efflux channel must be very low, i.e. model (i) held true in this case. In contrast, the addition of unlabeled betaine to strain DHP1/pC2 resulted in a rapid decrease of internal label. Consequently, the observed steady state must be the sum of both uptake and efflux, i.e. models (ii) or (iii) are valid. Thus, either the mutant BetP is functionally changed, being now active in a (futile) exchange under iso-osmotic conditions, or the mutant protein catalyzes uptake of unlabeled substrate, and the label is released from the cytosol via the efflux channel. For a discrimination, unlabeled substrate was added after 5 min, i.e. when betaine was still taken up at the maximum rate. As expected, the internal label remained constant in strain DHP1/pGTG, indicating again that no efflux occurred (Fig. 7 A). The uptake kinetics seems to stops at the point of addition because of the low specific label of external betaine after the addition of unlabeled substrate. In strain DHP1/pC2 no efflux of label occurred within the first 30 min after addition of unlabeled substrate (Fig. 7 B). Interestingly, the onset of the efflux occurred at the same time, when the cells without betaine addition were approaching the steady state. On the basis of these results models (ii) and (iii) can be discriminated. Since no initial efflux was observed after the addition of unlabeled betaine to cells that carry the mutant protein and were actively taking up betaine, the mutant carrier also does not catalyze counter-exchange under these conditions, identical to the wild type protein. Consequently, the rapid decay of internal label on the addition of unlabeled substrate after 1.5 h is not due to exchange activity of the modified BetP but represents the sum of uptake activity of BetP and efflux activity via the channel. Osmotic stress is a major challenge in the habitat of a soil bacterium like C. glutamicum. Consequently, this organism is not only equipped with a number of transport systems responding to osmotic stress, but these systems are also efficiently regulated, both on the level of expression and, most important for an instant stress response, on the activity level. We have previously described that the glycine betaine carrier BetP, the major osmo-reactive uptake system inC. glutamicum, effectively responds to osmotic changes within a time range of seconds or less (14Farwick M. Siewe R.M. Krämer R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4690-4695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We were interested in the mechanism of how the BetP protein senses the osmotic stress. The data presented here indicate that both the negatively charged N- and the positively charged C-terminal extension of BetP are involved in sensing and/or transducing osmotic changes to the domain of the protein responsible for the translocation of the substrate glycine betaine. The usual way to exert osmotic stress to a bacterial cell is the addition of salts, e.g. NaCl. In the case of BetP being a Na+-coupled secondary system (14Farwick M. Siewe R.M. Krämer R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4690-4695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the addition of NaCl changes not only the osmolality but also the ionic strength as well as the concentration of the coupling ion. To discriminate between these mechanisms, we extended our previous studies of NaCl-dependent regulation of BetP to the uncharged solute sorbitol and to the membrane-active amphipathic local anesthetic tetracaine. Tetracaine is known to change the physical state of the membrane (21Bottner M. Winter R. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 2041-2046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22Hornby A.P. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 647: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23Lambert C. Erdmann A. Eikmanns M. Krämer R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 4334-4342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Shimooka T. Shibata A. Terada H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1104: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which is the structural basis of osmo-stress (mechanostress) on the level of membrane structure. In a similar study on osmo-sensing by the KdpD protein, a sensor kinase of the E. coli Kdp system, local anesthetics were found to modulate the activity of the membrane-inserted protein (25Sugiura A. Hirokawa K. Nakashima K. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Both the addition of sorbitol and of local anesthetics led to an activation of the BetP protein, similar to that evoked by the addition of NaCl. This indicates that in fact membrane/protein interaction is the basis of the transduction of osmo-stress to the carrier protein. Interestingly, additional transport systems involved in osmo-regulation in C. glutamicum do not seem to respond to addition of tetracaine (Fig. 1 B), which indicates again that the effect of the local anesthetic is not at all simply an unspecific membrane action. The charged N- and C-terminal extensions of BetP are an obvious target for studies on osmotic regulation, especially in view of the hypothesis on ProP function in E. coli, which shows a comparable C-terminal extension (12Culham E.D. Lasby B. Marangoni A.G. Milner J.L. Steer B.A. van Nues R.W. Wood J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). All four different deletion mutants in the N-terminal region of BetP were active in transport. Furthermore, even the carrier protein with a completely missing N-terminal extension did not show a change in the binding affinity toward glycine betaine. On the other hand, the pattern of osmo-regulation of these recombinant proteins on the level of activity was altered. We observed an optimum of stimulation at a 2-fold higher external osmolality, i.e.at a NaCl concentration where the wild type protein is already largely inhibited. The consequences of changes in the C-terminal region were completely different. Truncation of only 12 amino acid residues (C3 mutant) led to activity of the carrier at low external osmolality, i.e. in a range where the wild type protein is inactive. Deletion of 23 and 32 residues in the C2 and C1 mutants, respectively, resulted in proteins that were not only active at low osmolality but remained active over a broad range of osmolality. The full extent of the change in regulation properties of BetP proteins with truncated C-terminal extensions became obvious after a detailed functional analysis. Proteins with a significantly shortened C-terminal extension (C2 and C1 mutants) had completely lost regulation by osmotic stress both at high and low osmolality. The initial rise in activity, which seemed to be similar to the wild type, was found to be solely the consequence of a changed affinity for the co-substrate Na+. In the presence of a low basic concentration of Na+, we demonstrated by the use of sorbitol instead of NaCl that these mutant BetP proteins are in fact not sensitive to osmo-stress anymore. The dominance of the C-terminal extension for this regulation was corroborated by the construction of double mutants with deletions both in the N- and in the C-terminal region. The double mutants turned out to be functionally identical to the respective proteins with altered C-terminal region only. In summary, the following pattern of consequences of truncating terminal regions of BetP emerges. Deletions in the N-terminal extension cause a shift to higher values of the optimum of osmotic stimulation. A truncation in the C-terminal region by 12 amino acids (C3) lowers the optimum of activation. Larger deletions of 23 (C2) or 32 amino acids (C1) lead to a complete loss of the response to osmotic stress as well as to a significant decrease in the Na+ affinity. In addition, deletion of 32 amino acids (C1) results in a decrease of the affinity toward glycine betaine. After truncation of the whole C-terminal extension, no transport activity was detected anymore. These findings to some extent resemble a hypothesis that was put forward for the E. coli ProP protein (12Culham E.D. Lasby B. Marangoni A.G. Milner J.L. Steer B.A. van Nues R.W. Wood J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The E. coli proline/betaine transporter ProP also functions both as osmo-sensor and osmo-regulator and carries a C-terminal extension of about 50 amino acids, which was supposed to be involved in osmo-sensing. Furthermore, a related hypothesis on the location of sensory and regulatory domains in a membrane protein involved in the response to osmotic stress was suggested for the KdpD sensor kinase inE. coli. In this case, however, transmembrane segments were made responsible for the putative sensory domain (29Zimmann P. Puppe W. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28282-28288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The results on the BetP protein provide the first step for a molecular analysis of membrane-protein interactions involved in osmo-sensing by a bacterial carrier system. Moreover, our results demonstrate that the altered regulation of the mutant proteins has severe consequences for the response of the cell to osmostress. C. glutamicumcarrying the C2 mutant with the truncated C-terminal region reached a significantly higher level of steady state accumulation of betaine. This indicates that the basis for the kinetic steady state in wild type cells and in cells with the mutant BetP carrier are different. A kinetic analysis of the situation revealed that this is in fact the case. By measuring exchange of labeled (internal) and unlabeled (external) betaine in the wild type and in mutant strains, we showed that the steady state in the wild type is based on a down-regulation of BetP activity due to the fact that the stimulus, i.e. the osmotic stress, is abolished after a high internal concentration of compatible solute is reached (14Farwick M. Siewe R.M. Krämer R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4690-4695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, in the mutant strain carrying the BetP protein that is insensitive to hyperosmotic stress, the observed steady state was found to be the result of an unchanged uptake activity counter-balanced by glycine betaine efflux via a different pathway, independent from BetP. Consequently, in this case, a futile cycle is created. The efflux pathway, being a security valve under these conditions, most likely is the mechanosensitive efflux channel that we recently described in C. glutamicum(27Ruffert S. Lambert C. Peter H. Wendisch V.F. Krämer R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 572-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We thank E. Galinski for a gift of ectoine, J.

Stimulation of JNK can be induced by stress factors and by agonists of tyrosine kinase and G protein-coupled receptors. G protein-dependent receptors stimulate JNK via Gβγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, but the subsequent signaling reaction has been undefined. Here we demonstrate JNK activation in COS-7 cells by Gβγ-stimulated phosphoinositide 3-kinase γ (PI3Kγ). Signal transduction from PI3Kγ to JNK can be suppressed by dominant negative mutants of Ras, Rac, and the protein kinase PAK. These results identify PI3Kγ as a mediator of Gβγ-dependent regulation of JNK activity. Jun kinases (JNK) are involved in the stress response of mammalian cells.

Interaction of cells with a wide variety of agonists results in a stimulation of intracellular mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK (or SAPK), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (or stress-activated protein kinase); PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; HA, hemagglutinin; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK (or SAPK), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (or stress-activated protein kinase); PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; HA, hemagglutinin; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. cascades. MAPKs control the expression of genes that are important for the regulation of many cell functions including proliferation and differentiation. In mammalian cells three parallel MAPK pathways have been characterized so far (1Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). The canonical MAPK cascade composed of Raf, MEK, and ERK is regulated by the Ras GTPase in response to agonists of tyrosine kinase and G protein-coupled receptors. ERK species catalyze the phosphorylation of transcription factors including Elk-1, thus controlling the expression of several genes (2Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 270: 14553-14556Google Scholar). A second MAPK cascade that is stimulated by osmotic stress regulates the activity of the protein kinase p38. Signal transduction to p38 and the function of this pathway are still unclear. Like p38 the elements of the Jun kinase (JNK) cascade as a third MAPK pathway are involved in the stress response of mammalian cells. JNK can be stimulated by stress factors like interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor but also by agonists of tyrosine kinase and G protein-coupled receptors (3Kyriakis J. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5620-5624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Available evidences point to an involvement of the small GTPase Rac and several protein kinases in the regulation of JNK activity (5Ridley A.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1256-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In some cellular systems the STE 20 homologue PAK was found to act as a JNK kinase kinase kinase (6Bagrodia S. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27995-27998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). PAK is able to activate JNK via sequential stimulation of the protein kinases MEKK and SEK. The mechanism of signal transduction from G protein-coupled receptors to the JNK cascade is only partially understood. Using COS-7 cells as a transient expression system a recent report showed the involvement of Gβγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins in the stimulation of JNK by agonists of the G protein-coupled muscarinergic receptor m2 (7Coso O.A. Teramoto H. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3963-3966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Additionally the small GTPases Ras and Rac have been demonstrated to mediate signal transduction from G protein-coupled receptor to JNK, but the topology of the signaling path from Gβγ to Ras and Rac remains unknown (7Coso O.A.

Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar). One candidate for the link of G protein-coupled receptor and JNK cascade is phosphoinositide 3-kinase γ (PI3Kγ). This subspecies of the PI3K family is stimulated in vitro by Gβγ and recently has been shown to be involved in signal transduction from G protein-coupled receptor to the ERK path of MAPK cascades (10Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). We now present evidences that JNK stimulation by an agonist of the m2 muscarinergic receptor and by Gβγ also implies a PI3K. Overexpression of PI3Kγ in COS-7 cells induces a significant increase of JNK activity. Stimulation of JNK by Gβγ can be suppressed by the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin and a lipid kinase negative mutant of PI3K. Dominant negative mutants of Ras, Rac, and PAK significantly reduce the stimulatory effect of PI3Kγ on JNK. Thus PI3Kγ seems to act as an intermediate connecting G protein-coupled receptors to the JNK cascade. COS-7 cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were split the day before transfection. Subconfluent cells were transfected with pcDNAIII-HA-JNK or pcDNAIII-HA-MAPK and additional DNAs, following the DEAE-dextran technique, adjusting the total amount of DNA to 5 μg per plate with vector DNA when necessary. Assays were performed 48 h after transfection (9Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S.

For JNK assays the cells were serum-starved for 2 h, whereas for MAPK the cells were starved overnight in serum-free medium.

Briefly, serum-starved cells left untreated or stimulated with various agents were lysed, and after centrifugation, clarified supernatants were immunoprecipitated with an anti-hemagglutinin monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Babco, Richmond, CA) for 1–2 h at 4 °C, and immunocomplexes were recovered with the aid of GammaBind (Pharmacia, Uppsala). Pellets were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline solution, supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40, and 2 mm sodium vanadate, once with 0.5 mLiCl in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and once with kinase reaction buffer (12.5 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 12.5 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm sodium fluoride, 0.5 mm vanadate). Reactions were performed in a 30-μl volume of kinase reaction buffer containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/reaction, 20 μm unlabeled ATP, and 1.5 mg/ml substrate at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by addition of 5× Laemmli buffer, boiled, and electrophoresed in 12% polyacrylamide gel. Phosphorylated GST-ATF2(96) was visualized by autoradiography and quantified with a PhosphorImager. MAPK activity in cells transfected with an epitope-tagged MAPK (HA-MAPK) was determined as described previously (11Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). In each case, parallel samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and processed by Western blot analysis using the appropriate antibody (Santa Cruz Technology, Santa Cruz, CA). Immunocomplexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham) with the use of goat antiserum to rabbit or mouse immunoglobulin G coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Technology). To investigate signaling from G protein-coupled receptor to JNK the muscarinergic m2 receptor has been transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. Confirming previous results (7Coso O.A. Teramoto H. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3963-3966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) we observed an increase of JNK activity after treatment with the receptor agonist carbachol (Fig. 1 A). Overexpression of Gβγ mimics the effect of carbachol on JNK. As shown in Fig. 1 Aboth m2- and Gβγ-mediated stimulation could be effectively suppressed by wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of PI3K. In contrast JNK activation by the stress-inducing agent anisomycin was unaffected by wortmannin, demonstrating the specificity of this approach. Another PI3K inhibitor LY 294002 decreased JNK stimulation induced by Gβγ in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B). Together these data point to an involvement of PI3K in the stimulation of JNK by G protein-coupled receptor. Trying to outline the PI3K species that induces Gβγ-dependent JNK activation we expressed PI3Kγ in COS-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 2 A, PI3Kγ moderately stimulated JNK activity. This effect could be significantly enhanced by coexpression of p101, a PI3Kγ-binding protein recently discovered (12Stephens L.R. Eguinoa A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Cooke F. Coadwell J.

For a comparison Fig. 2 A expresses the individual effects of p101, PI3Kγ, and PI3Kγ + p101 on MAP kinase (ERK) activity. Interestingly p101 exhibited significantly lower potency to affect PI3Kγ-dependent MAPK activity than JNK induced by PI3Kγ. To examine possible autocrine reactions of the transfectants we analyzed the effects of conditioned media from COS-7 cells expressing PI3Kγ and/or p101 on naive cells. Supernatants of the transfected cells did not induce any measurable stimulation of JNK activity in untreated cells, thus providing evidence for direct signaling from PI3Kγ and p101 to JNK (data not shown). Fig. 2 B demonstrates the dependence of JNK activation on the expression levels of p101 and PI3Kγ. Thus optimal stimulation of JNK seems to depend on PI3Kγ and p101. The activatory effect of PI3Kγ on JNK could be completely inhibited by wortmannin suggesting an important role of the kinase activities of the PI3K (Fig. 3 A). PI3Kγ recently has been shown to exhibit a significant ability to catalyze autophosphorylation in addition to its lipid kinase activity (15Stoyanova S. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Kirsch C. Hanck T. Klinger R. Wetzker R. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Both kinase activities depend on magnesium and can be inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of wortmannin. A recently described mutant of PI3Kγ K799R, which does not express significant lipid kinase and protein kinase activities, was able to suppress the JNK stimulation induced by Gβγ (Fig. 3 B). Together with our previous report (10Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) these findings provide clear evidence that PI3Kγ links both JNK and MAPK to G protein-coupled receptors. Involvement of PI3Kα, which recently has been shown to mediate signaling of platelet-derived growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase to JNK (16Lopez-Ilasaca M. Li W. Uren A. Yu J. Kazlauskas A. Gutkind J.S. Heidaran M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) seems improbable. The recently described involvement of Ras and Rac in signal transduction from G protein-coupled receptors to JNK prompted us to investigate a possible role of these small GTPases in JNK stimulation induced by PI3Kγ. As shown in Fig. 4 A coexpression of dominant negative forms of Ras and Rac prevented activation of JNK by PI3Kγ. In contrast coexpression of the negative mutants of two other small GTPases RhoA and Cdc42 did not affect the stimulation of JNK by PI3Kγ. Therefore Ras and Rac1 seem to represent essential elements of the signaling path from PI3Kγ to JNK. Expression of βARK as a binding protein for Gβγ (9Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar, 10Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) also suppressed JNK stimulation induced by PI3Kγ (data not shown). This effect points to an essential role of Gβγ as a link of G protein-coupled receptors to PI3Kγ. We next explored a possible involvement of protein kinase PAK in downstream signaling from PI3Kγ to JNK. The coexpression of a dominant negative mutant of this protein kinase also induced a partial suppression of JNK stimulation by Gβγ, PI3Kγ, and a constitutively active mutant of Rac (Fig. 4 B). Thus signaling from G protein-coupled receptor to JNK appears to require Gβγ, PI3Kγ, Ras, Rac, and PAK. Nevertheless the sequence of events connecting PI3Kγ and JNK remains unclear. A PI3Kγ effect on Ras has been proposed in our previous report on ERK activation by PI3Kγ (10Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). In this paper we provide evidences that Ras could be activated by PI3Kγ via a Src-type tyrosine kinase, the adapter proteins Shc and Grb2, and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos. Stimulated in this way Ras could act as a dissociation point for signals from PI3Kγ to ERK and JNK. Such a bifurcating function of Ras as a regulator of the Raf-ERK path and signal transduction to Rac, PAK, and JNK has been proposed (6Bagrodia S. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27995-27998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Despite the attractiveness of this model some experimental data point to a more complex relation of the signaling proteins involved. Thus the differential effects of p101 on the PI3Kγ-dependent stimulation of ERK and JNK cannot be explained by simple sequential signal transduction from PI3Kγ via the lipid kinase product PIP3 to Ras and subsequent stimulation of JNK and ERK paths. One possible explanation for the distinct effects of PI3Kγ and its ligands on the MAPK cascades could be the involvement of signaling activities of the enzyme in addition to PIP3 production. Wortmannin-sensitive protein kinase activity of PI3Kγ has been reported (15Stoyanova S. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Kirsch C. Hanck T. Klinger R. Wetzker R. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). If Gβγ and p101 produce divergent effects on the lipid kinase and protein kinase activities of PI3Kγ and if both activities are important for signal transduction different downstream events could be expected. The individual signaling functions of PI3Kγ lipid kinase and protein kinase activities are currently under investigation. The effects of PI3Kγ on different MAPK cascades clearly represent another example for the complex interrelations of these intracellular signaling proteins. We are very grateful to Drs. Len Stephens and Phill Hawkins for providing us with the pcDNA3-p101 construct."

Incubation of [3H]BK at 37 °C with cells expressing wild type B2KR resulted in pronounced and rapid ligand internalization (∼80% after 10 min). By contrast, incubation of3H-labeled des-Arg10-kallidin with cells expressing B1KR resulted in a modest, slow internalization of the ligand (<20% after 10 min). Replacement, from Cys324, of the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus of the B2KR with that of the B1KR from Cys330 (both Cys residues are putative palmitoylation sites) greatly reduced ligand internalization (∼40% after 10 min) without significantly altering Kd or ligand-induced signal activation. By marked contrast, the corresponding replacement, of the sequence from Cys330 of the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus of the B1KR with the segment of the B2KR, led to a striking increase of ligand internalization (∼75% within 10 min) without altering Kd or ligand-induced signal activation. Truncation of the B2KR to within three amino acids of Cys324 (truncation at Gly327) led to strongly reduced ligand internalization (∼40% after 10 min). Truncation of the B2KR up to Lys315 almost completely abolished internalization of [3H]BK (10% after 10 min). This additional reduction is apparently not caused by the loss of the potential palmitoylation site at Cys324, since a B2KR with a point mutation of Cys324 to Ala internalized [3H]BK as rapidly as the wild type B2KR.From these results we conclude that the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus of the human B2KR contains sequences that are necessary and sufficient to permit rapid ligand-induced sequestration of human kinin receptors and internalization of their agonists.

From these results we conclude that the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus of the human B2KR contains sequences that are necessary and sufficient to permit rapid ligand-induced sequestration of human kinin receptors and internalization of their agonists. Kinins are small peptides that are released from high molecular weight precursors, called kininogens, by limited proteolysis performed by enzymes known as kallikreins. They exert their large array of biologic effects at the cellular level via two types of receptors, B1 and B2 kinin receptors (B1KR 1The abbreviations used are: B1KR, B1 kinin receptor; B2KR, B2 kinin receptor; BK, bradykinin; DAK, des-Arg10-kallidin (des-Arg10-Lys-BK); CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PIPES, piperazine-N, N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid); IP, inositol phosphate; WT, wild type. 1The abbreviations used are: B1KR, B1 kinin receptor; B2KR, B2 kinin receptor; BK, bradykinin; DAK, des-Arg10-kallidin (des-Arg10-Lys-BK); CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PIPES, piperazine-N, N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid); IP, inositol phosphate; WT, wild type.and B2KR, respectively) (1Regoli D.

The B2KR is constitutively expressed in a variety of tissues and cell lines, binding with high affinity to bradykinin (BK) and to Lys-BK (Kallidin), but not to their respective carboxypeptidase degradation products des-Arg10-BK and des-Arg10-kallidin (DAK). The B1KR, in contrast, is expressed de novo under certain pathological conditions and exhibits no affinity for BK but a high affinity for DAK and a low affinity for kallidin and des-Arg9-BK (7Austin C.E.

Both human kinin receptors have been cloned recently (8Hess F.J. Borkowski J.A. Young G.S. Strader C.D. Ransom R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21583-21586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hydrophobicity analysis of their amino acid sequence revealed that they both have seven hydrophobic domains that are typical for members of the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The amino acid sequences of both receptors show an overall homology of only 36%, however, with higher areas of homology in the transmembrane regions (9Menke J.G. Borkowski J.A. Bierilo K.K. McNeil T. Derrick A.W. Schneck K.A. Ransom R.W. Strader C.D. Linemeyer D.L. Hess J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21583-21586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite their relatively low homology, the receptors appear to share similar signal transduction pathways, such as activation of phospholipase C that leads to the release of inositol phosphates and an increase in intracellular [Ca2+] levels, in response to binding of agonists (9Menke J.G. Borkowski J.A. Bierilo K.K. McNeil T. Derrick A.W. Schneck K.A. Ransom R.W. Strader C.D. Linemeyer D.L. Hess J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21583-21586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While it is already well established that B2KR couples to phospholipase C via the G-protein Gq (10Gutowski S. Smrcka A. Nowak L. Wu D.G. Simon M. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20519-20524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Liao J.K. Homcy C.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2168-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we demonstrated only recently that binding of DAK to B1KR leads to the activation of Gq and Gi1,2 (7Austin C.E. Faussner A.

The kinin receptors appear to differ, however, in mechanisms of signal “termination.” Several studies showed that B2KR responds to agonist binding with ligand-induced receptor sequestration (12Roscher A.A. Manganiello V.C. Jelsema L.J. Moss J. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 13Munoz C.M. Cotecchia S. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 336-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and ligand internalization (14Roscher A.A. Klier C. Dengler R. Faussner A. Müller-Esterl W. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1990; 15: S39-S43Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Munoz C.M. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 303-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These properties of the B2KR may be responsible, at least in part, for the rapid decrease in responsiveness of the involved cells to a second stimulation with BK (desensitization). The B1KR, in contrast, internalizes its ligand very slowly and shows almost no short term desensitization (7Austin C.E. Faussner A. Robinson H.E. Sarvait C. Kyle D.J. Bathon J.M. Proud D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11420-11425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For GPCRs with very long third intracellular loops, such as the muscarinic receptor (almost 300 amino acids), important sequences for ligand-induced receptor sequestration and ligand internalization have been identified in this third loop (16Moro O. Lameh J. Sadee W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6862-6865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29004-29011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In GPCRs with short third intracellular loops, other domains may contribute to the signal for ligand internalization. For receptors including the β-adrenergic, angiotensin II, gastrin-releasing peptide, parathyroid hormone receptors, and δ-opioid receptor, domains have been localized to the cytoplasmic tail, particularly to sequences enriched in serine and threonine residues (18Yu S.S.

Both kinin receptor subtypes have short third intracellular loops, and their cytoplasmic COOH termini share no homology after the putatively palmitoylated cysteine. Therefore, we asked whether their opposite patterns of internalization are the consequence of either a positive sequence (in the case of the B2KR) or an inhibitory sequence (B1KR) for sequestration and/or ligand internalization provided by their cytoplasmic tails. The results of our study demonstrate for the first time (i) that the information encoded in the cytoplasmic tail of the B2KR is necessary and sufficient for ligand-induced sequestration of B2 and also B1 kinin receptors; (ii) that loss of a putative palmitoylation site in the cytoplasmic tail of B2KR does not interfere with ligand internalization or receptor sequestration; (iii) that the B1KR, in contrast to B2KR, does not respond to binding of an agonist with receptor sequestration; and (iv) that exchange of the cytoplasmic tail does not transfer the desensitization pattern. Chinese hamster ovary cells DUKXB1 (CHO) and human fetal lung fibroblasts IMR 90 were obtained from ATCC. [2,3-prolyl-3,4-3H]Bradykinin (100–108 Ci/mmol), [3,4-prolyl-3,4-3H]des-Arg10-kallidin (84–89 Ci/mmol), and myo-[2-3H]inositol (22 Ci/mmol) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Unlabeled peptides were bought from Bachem. All primers were synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. and delivered desalted and lyophilized. Restriction enzymes and phosphoramidon were from Boehringer Mannheim or New England Biolabs. Pfu DNA polymerase was obtained from Stratagene. Lipofectamine, culture media, most additives, Opti-MEM, Geneticin (G418 sulfate), and fetal calf serum were bought from Life Technologies, Inc. Penicillin/streptomycin was obtained from Biofluids Inc. Captopril was purchased from Sigma. All other reagents were of analytical grade and commercially available. A pcDNA3 vector, harboring the cDNA encoding the B1 receptor (pcDNA3-B1), was kindly provided by Dr J. Fred Hess (Merck). Stock cultures of IMR 90 lung fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose, 2 mm glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, and penicillin/streptomycin. Half of the spent medium was replaced by fresh medium every 4 days. For subcultures, cells were lifted with trypsin and seeded in six-well trays in medium composed of two parts of fresh medium and one part of used (conditioned) medium. Naive CHO cells and transfected cells were cultivated in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin (complete medium). mRNA from human synovial fibroblasts was used as starting material to obtain the cDNA encoding the B2KR gene by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR product was then subcloned between the BamHI and XhoI sites of the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). The sequence of the insert was determined by sequencing selected clones using the dideoxynucleotide method (24Sanger F. Science. 1981; 214: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) and was identical with the published human B2KR sequence (8Hess F.J. Borkowski J.A. Young G.S. Strader C.D. Ransom R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). This pcDNA3 vector harboring the B2KR (pcDNA3-B2) was consequently used as a template to generate the truncated mutants Gly327 and Lys315 and the point mutation C324A using standard PCR methodology with appropriate oligonucleotides. For the synthesis of the chimera, in which the cytoplasmic tail of the B1KR was replaced with that of the B2KR (B2CB1), a first PCR was performed with the pcDNA3-B1 vector as template using a T7 primer and a chimeric antisense primer 5′-CCTGCAGCCCCCTTTCTGGCATTGTTTATAAAGTTCC-3′ composed of 16 base pairs from the B1 sequence upstream of Cys330(encoded by GCA) and 18 base pairs of the B2 sequence downstream of Cys324 (GCA). A second PCR was executed with pcDNA3-B2 as template with the sense primer 5′-CAATGCCAGAAAGGGGGCTGCAGG-3′ corresponding to the B2 sequence, starting at Cys324 (encoded by TGC) and one triplet of the B1 sequence downstream stream of Cys330, and the antisense primer Sp6. The products of both reactions, displaying the predicted sizes, were gel-purified and used with T7 and Sp6 primers in a third PCR. The product of this reaction, the chimeric receptor gene, was subcloned between the BamHI and XhoI sites of the pcDNA3 vector. The chimeric B2CB1, in which the cytoplasmic tail of the B2KR was replaced with that of the B1KR was generated in the same way using 5′-GCAAGACTTTTAGGGGTGCACACTCCCTGGTACACC-3′ as antisense primer for the first reaction with pcDNA3-B2 as template and 5′-GTGTGCACCCCTAAAAGTCTTGC-3′ as sense primer in the second PCR with pcDNA3-B1 as template. The accuracy of the sequence of the chimeras was confirmed by sequencing selected clones using the dideoxynucleotide method (24Sanger F. Science. 1981; 214: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Plasmids were obtained using JM109 bacteria (Promega) and a plasmid purification midi kit from Qiagen. 20 μg of plasmid DNA in 300 μl of Opti-MEM and 30 μl of Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 270 μl of Opti-MEM were combined and kept at room temperature for 15 min to obtain a precipitate. After the addition of 4.6 ml of Opti-MEM, the whole mixture was added to subconfluent (40–70%) CHO cells in a 80-cm2 flask that had been rinsed with 5 ml of Opti-MEM and incubated with another 5 ml for 15 min at 37 °C. After 16–36 h, the medium was changed with 10 ml of complete medium containing G 418 (800 μg of geneticin/ml) to start the selection of stably transfected cells. Medium was changed every 4 days, and after about 15 days individual clones were isolated by limiting dilution and screened for binding of the appropriate ligand. All stock cultures were kept under constant selection pressure of G418 (800 μg/ml), whereas cells seeded in dishes/wells were maintained without G418 and used within 2–5 days. For the determination of dissociation constants (Kd) and receptor numbers (Bmax), cell monolayers in 24- or 12-well (CHO) or 6-well trays (IMR 90) were washed three times with wash buffer (40 mm PIPES, 109 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.1% glucose, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, 2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) followed by preincubation at 37 °C with incubation buffer (wash buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors: 2 mm bacitracin, 10 μm phosphoramidon, and 100 μm captopril). The trays were subsequently placed on ice, and the indicated concentrations of [3H]BK or [3H]DAK were added for determination of total B2KR and B1KR binding, respectively. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 5 μm of the appropriate unlabeled ligand. After an incubation time of at least 90 min, the cell monolayers were washed four times with ice-cold incubation buffer, lysed with 0.3m sodium hydroxide, and transferred quantitatively into scintillation vials. Radioactivity of the samples was measured in a β-counter after the addition of a 10-fold volume of scintillation fluid. Specific binding was calculated as the difference between total binding and nonspecific binding. To determine the internalization of receptor-bound ligand, cell monolayers were washed three times with prewarmed (37 °C) wash buffer and preincubated at 37 °C with incubation buffer for at least 30 min. Internalization was started by replacing the buffer with incubation buffer containing the indicated concentrations of 3H-ligand with or without 5 μm unlabeled ligand. After the indicated time, the incubation was stopped by washing the monolayers four times with ice-cold wash buffer. The trays were placed on ice, and the cells were treated with an ice-cold solution of 0.2 macetic acid and 0.5 m NaCl, pH 2.7 (dissociation solution) for 10 min in order to dissociate the surface-bound3H-ligand (0.3 ml for 12-well trays). The supernatant was transferred to scintillation vials, and the radioactivity was quantified. The acid-resistant 3H radioactivity, considered to be internalized 3H-ligand, was quantified after lysis of the cells with 0.3 m sodium hydroxide. Monolayers of cells in 12-well dishes were washed twice with prewarmed (37 °C) wash buffer, preincubated in incubation buffer for at least 30 min at 37 °C, and incubated with the same buffer containing 1 μm of the appropriate unlabeled ligand (BK or DAK). After the indicated times, the cells were washed four times with 0.5 ml of ice-cold wash buffer and treated on ice for 10 min with dissociation solution to remove all unlabeled surface-bound ligand. The monolayers were washed again four times with ice-cold wash buffer, and specific B2KR or B1KR binding was determined at 0 °C as described above using approximately 2 nm [3H]BK or 1 nm[3H]DAK. 80% confluent cell monolayers of stably transfected clones grown in 12-well trays were labeled for 24–48 h with 2 μCi of myo-[3H]inositol in 0.5 ml of α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 0.05% bovine serum albumin and penicillin/streptomycin. Monolayers were rinsed with wash buffer, equilibrated in prewarmed incubation buffer containing 50 mm LiCl for 15–30 min, and stimulated with the appropriate agonist at 37 °C. The stimulation was terminated by exchanging the buffer for 0.75 ml of an ice-cold solution of 20 mm formic acid and by placing the trays on ice for 30 min. After transferring the supernatants quantitatively with another 0.75 ml of 20 mmformic acid to tubes, 0.2 ml of a 3% ammonium hydroxide solution was added, and the mixtures were applied to AG 1-X8 anion exchange columns (1-ml volume). The columns were washed with 1 ml of 1.8% ammonium hydroxide, followed by 9 ml of 60 mm sodium formate, 5 mm tetraborate buffer, and total inositol phosphates were eluted with 1.5 ml of 4 m ammonium formate, 0.2m formic acid. For the determination of the EC50 values, the cell monolayers were stimulated for 30 min with increasing concentrations of agonist. For the time curves, stimulation was carried out with 1 μm of the appropriate agonist. All points in the figures represent the mean ± S.E. of at least three experiments done in triplicate. For internalization and sequestration experiments with transfected CHO cells, G418-selected, but not cloned, cell populations and at least one stably transfected clone were evaluated. Data were analyzed using paired or unpaired t tests, as appropriate. Significance was assumed for values of p < 0.05. Human embryonic lung fibroblasts IMR 90 represent one of the few human cell lines that naturally express both types of kinin receptors, but B1KR expression is low (5,000 sites/cell) compared with that of B2KR (70,000 sites/cell) (9Menke J.G. Borkowski J.A. Bierilo K.K. McNeil T. Derrick A.W. Schneck K.A. Ransom R.W. Strader C.D. Linemeyer D.L. Hess J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21583-21586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To date it is not known whether the B1KR becomes sequestered upon ligand stimulation as has been described for the human B2KR (12Roscher A.A. Manganiello V.C. Jelsema L.J. Moss J. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 13Munoz C.M. Cotecchia S. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 336-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and it was only very recently that we reported the almost complete lack of internalization of DAK after binding to a B1KR expressed in CHO cells (7Austin C.E. Faussner A. Robinson H.E. Sarvait C. Kyle D.J. Bathon J.M. Proud D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11420-11425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Since this lack of internalization might have been due to the expression of the B1KR in a noncompatible cell system, we used the acetic acid treatment method (25Haigler H.T. Maxfield F.R. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1239-1241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that has been used to study the internalization of a variety of hormones to examine the behavior of the B1KR in IMR 90 cells. An added benefit to the study of IMR 90 cells is the ability to compare internalization/sequestration of both kinin receptor types in the same cell line. The B2KR of IMR 90 cells internalized [3H]BK very quickly reaching a plateau of 75% internalization of bound ligand after 10 min (Fig. 1). This is similar to what has been described for the B2KR in other cell lines (14Roscher A.A. Klier C. Dengler R. Faussner A. Müller-Esterl W. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1990; 15: S39-S43Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Munoz C.M. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 303-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, even after 30 min of incubation, less then 20% of bound [3H]DAK was found in an acid-resistant compartment (Fig. 1). We considered that the low level of B1KR expression in IMR 90 cells might be responsible for slow [3H]DAK internalization. We addressed this possibility using two approaches. First, we enhanced expression of B1KR in IMR 90 cells by preincubation with IL-1 (1 ng/ml) for 24 h as previously reported (not shown) (9Menke J.G. Borkowski J.A. Bierilo K.K. McNeil T. Derrick A.W. Schneck K.A. Ransom R.W. Strader C.D. Linemeyer D.L. Hess J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21583-21586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, we expressed high numbers of each receptor type in CHO cells, resulting in up to 67 fmol of B1KR/106 cells and up to 94 fmol of B2KR/106 cells. In each case, internalization rates for the respective ligands for each receptor were nearly identical to those observed in untreated IMR 90 cells (Fig. 1 and Ref. 7Austin C.E. Faussner A. Robinson H.E. Sarvait C. Kyle D.J. Bathon J.M. Proud D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11420-11425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These studies confirmed that the markedly different internalization rates of the B1KR and B2KR ligands are a property of the receptors themselves rather than simply a reflection of variable receptor density. Nontransfected CHO cells showed no uptake (internalization) of labeled ligand in these conditions (not shown). For all described experiments, CHO cells were transfected with pcDNA3 vectors, harboring inserts encoding the B1KR or the B2KR. Geneticin-selected, uncloned populations of both wild type receptors (WT B1 and WT B2) were used to isolate up to 20 individual clones. The expression levels of these G418-resistant clones were quite variable, ranging from no expression of kinin receptors at all to almost 500 fmol/106 cells. Nonetheless, for all wild type and mutant kinin receptors expressed in CHO cells, the pattern of ligand internalization was quite consistent between selected, uncloned populations and/or clones with varying expression levels (data not shown), similar to what has been reported for the angiotensin II receptor (20Thomas W.G. Baker K.M. Motel T.J. Thekkumkara T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22153-22159Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In view of the role of the cytoplasmic tail in conveying a signal for internalization in a number of nonkinin receptors (18Yu S.S. Lefkowitz R.J. Hausdorff W.P. J. Biol.

To address these questions, we created chimeric receptors in which the cytoplasmic tails were switched at a highly conserved (putative) palmitoylation site (Cys324 in B2KR and Cys330 in B1KR) (Fig. 2) This exchange did not significantly change the affinities of the receptors for their respective ligands at 0 °C (Table I). There was, however, a dramatic change in their internalization behavior at 37 °C. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the B2 chimera with the B1 tail (B2CB1) internalized [3H]BK at a considerably lower rate than WT B2, whereas the B1 chimera with the B2 tail (B1CB2) now internalized [3H]DAK almost as quickly as WT B2 internalized its ligand [3H]BK.Table IDissociation constant Kd, receptor density Bmax, and total inositol phosphate production upon ligand stimulation for 30 min of wild type, chimeric, and truncated kinin receptorsCell lineKdBmaxEC50± S.E.nmfmol/106 cellsnmWT B21.3940.32 ± 0.21 (n = 4)WT B10.31-aData from Austin et al.

Open table in a new tab To examine whether the low internalization rate of the B2CB1 chimera was due to an inhibitory sequence in the cytoplasmic tail of B1KR, we examined the effect of truncation of the B2KR on its rate of ligand internalization. Cys324 was felt to be the ideal site for truncation, since this would maintain consistency with the site of cytoplasmic tail exchange in the previous experiments. Cys324 is presumed to be palmitoylated, however, and several fatty acid transferases require additional amino acids adjacent to the target amino acid (Cys) to function properly. Therefore, we performed a more conservative truncation at Gly327. This truncation resulted in a significant reduction in [3H]BK internalization to a rate comparable with that of the B2CB1 chimera (Fig. 3). Because internalization was still considerably faster in the Gly327 mutant than in the B1KR, which serves as our reference for lack o"
https://openalex.org/W2071292533,"Undifferentiated human embryonal carcinoma cells are characterized by high expression of lactoneotetraosylceramide (nLc4), globoside (Gb4), and extended globo-series glycosphingolipids (GSLs) termed “stage-specific embryonic antigens 3 and 4” (SSEA-3 and -4). Expression of these GSLs declines in association with a decline of homotypic adhesion during the differentiation process. Therefore, these GSLs may play an essential role in adhesion among these cells. As an example, human embryonal carcinoma 2102 cells display strong adhesion to plates coated with Gb4 (“Gb4-dependent cell adhesion”). This adhesion, which simulates homotypic 2102 cell aggregation, is based on interaction between Gb4 and nLc4, or between Gb4 and GalGb4 (IV3GalGb4; the major SSEA-3 epitope), as indicated by the following observations: (i) adhesion of 2102 cells or GSL-liposomes to GSL-coated plates in various combinations; (ii) inhibition of Gb4-dependent 2102 cell adhesion by preincubation of cells with anti-SSEA-3 or anti-nLc4 antibodies, or by pretreatment of Gb4-coated plates with aqueous micellar solution of nLc4 or GalGb4; (iii) decline of the cell adhesion in association with retinoic acid-induced differentiation, whereby SSEA-3 and nLc4levels are reduced. Since cell adhesion is an essential prerequisite for induction of differentiation, as observed at each step of embryogenesis, expression of seven transcription factors following adhesion of 2102 cells to Gb4-coated plates, and to detergent-insoluble substrate adhesion matrix prepared from 2102 cells, were studied. In both types of adhesion, a strong enhancement of AP1 and CREB site binding activity was observed during the early stage (15–60 min following initial adhesion). Although 2102 cells showed strong adhesion to Gg3-coated plates, based on interaction between Gg3 and Gb4, adhesion of the cells to Gg3 did not cause changes of AP1 and CREB activity. No other transcription factors showed changes induced by Gg3- or Gb4-dependent adhesion.

Expression of adhesion receptor families (e.g.integrins, immunoglobulin analogs, cadherins, selectins, galectins, etc.) and their respective ligands plays a pivotal role in the cell adhesion process (1Hynes R.O.

Carbohydrate-carbohydrate interaction has been shown to play an accessory role in initiating cell adhesion prior to involvement of integrins and other adhesion receptors as above (Refs. 6Eggens I.

A model of embryogenesis is autoaggregation of mouse embryonal carcinoma F9 cells, which is based on Lex-to-Lex interaction in the presence of Ca2+ (6Eggens I. Fenderson B. Toyokuni T. Dean B.

Glycoconj. J. 1994; 11: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Involvement of uvomorulin or E-cadherin in the compaction process and in F9 cell autoaggregation has been clearly documented (3Takeichi M.

Recent studies indicate that E-cadherin and Lex cooperate in adhesion of F9 cells, and presumably in the compaction process (14Boubelik M. Draberova L. Draber P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

We now find that nLc4, the precursor of Lex, is expressed highly, together with Gb4 and other globo-series GSLs, in human embryonal carcinoma 2102 cells, and that all these structures are involved in adhesion among these cells. The same adhesion process may be involved in compaction of human embryos. Since cell adhesion is a prerequisite for induction of differentiation, occurrence of signal transduction following carbohydrate-dependent cell adhesion is expected. This study was designed to answer two basic questions. (i) Are globo-series GSLs and nLc4 involved in adhesion of human embryonal carcinoma cells based on carbohydrate-carbohydrate interaction, and, if so, what is the adhesion mechanism? (ii) Is signal transduction triggered by Gb4-dependent cell adhesion? Our results indicate that adhesion of 2102 cells to Gb4-coated plates, which simulates self-aggregation of 2102 cells, is indeed based on carbohydrate-carbohydrate interaction, and induces signal transduction in terms of activation of transcription factors. Human embryonal carcinoma cell line 2102 Ep was derived from a surgical specimen of a primary testicular germ cell tumor containing embryonal carcinoma (19Andrews P.W. Goodfellow P.N. Shevinsky L.H.

All GSLs used were prepared and purified in this laboratory as described previously (20Hakomori S. Kanfer J.N. Hakomori S. Sphingolipid Biochemistry.

The major epitope of MC631 is GalGb4, but the mAb cross-reacts with fucosyl-GalGb4 and weakly with Gb4 (17Kannagi R. Cochran N.A. Ishigami F. Hakomori S. Andrews P.W. Knowles B.B. Solter D.

Briefly, 5 × 105 cells were incubated with the specific primary antibody with gentle shaking for 2 h at 4 °C, washed with washing buffer (1% BSA, PBS, 0.1% NaN3), treated with fluorescence-labeled goat (Fab)2 anti-mouse IgM + G (Tago, Camarillo, CA) or anti-rabbit Ig antibody for 1 h on ice, washed twice with washing buffer, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde solution, and analyzed by flow cytometer (Coulter Electronics Corp., Hialeah, FL). Liposomes labeled with [3H]cholesterol containing Gb4 were prepared, and their interactions with plastic surfaces coated with various GSLs were studied as described previously (6Eggens I. Fenderson B. Toyokuni T. Dean B. Stroud M. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9476-9484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with slight modification. Briefly, 35 μg of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, 20 μg of cholesterol containing3H-labeled material, and 12.5 μg of Gb4 were dissolved in 200 μl of chloroform-methanol (2:1), and the solution was evaporated to dryness in a rotary evaporator. The residue was mixed with 2 ml of PBS with or without bivalent cation, vigorously mixed with a Vortex mixer, sonicated for 30 min (Branson 5200), and allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 min. Liposome suspensions obtained after three repetitions of the sonication/incubation procedure were used. In most experiments, PBS containing 0.9 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2 was used as a solution for suspension. Liposomes were also prepared in the absence of any bivalent cation, and in the presence of 15 mm EDTA in PBS. To prepare solid phase polystyrene plastic surfaces coated with GSLs, 30 nmol/ml ethanol solutions of various GSLs were prepared, and a 50-μl aliquot (containing 1.5 nmol of GSL) or its appropriately diluted solution was added to each well of 96-well flat bottom plastic plates (Falcon 3912, flexible assay plate), dried at 37 °C, and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS. GSLs tested were nLc4, sialosyl-nLc4, Lc3, GM1, Gg3, GM3, Gb3, Gb4, GalGb4, sialosyl-GalGb4, Lexpentaosyl-Cer, Lea pentaosyl-Cer, and Lebhexaosyl-Cer. To each GSL-coated well on the 96-well plate, 100 μl of liposome containing Gb4 and 3H-labeled cholesterol (1.0 × 105 cpm/well) was added and incubated in PBS at room temperature for 16 h. Wells were washed with PBS by seven repetitions of the following special procedure. To each well of the plate, 200 μl of PBS was added, after which the plate was held upside-down and shaken gently to remove the PBS. The3H-labeled liposomes remaining on the plate were counted by scintillation counter. 2102 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS in 15-cm plates. Cells were detached from confluent cultures in 0.52 mm EDTA, collected, and suspended in 1% BSA in DMEM at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. Aliquots (100 μl) of the cell suspension were placed in each well of a 96-well plate coated with various GSLs as described above, and the plates were incubated for 30 min to 2 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. After incubation, the plates were washed once with PBS by the following special procedure. The plate was immersed in PBS(+) in a large container, and suspended upside down above the the bottom of the container for 15–20 min with gentle shaking to allow nonadherent cells to sediment (fall) out of the plates. The plate was then turned rightside up, removed from the container, and PBS in each well was removed by gentle aspiration. The adherent cells remaining after this procedure were fixed with 150 μl of 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 2 h at room temperature and stained with 0.1% Toluidine Blue O for 30 min. The remaining cells were lysed with 10% acetic acid, and absorbance was measured at 630 nm. 2102 cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells/75-cm2 flask in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, and differentiation was induced by either 10 μm retinoic acid or 3 μm BrdUrd. Alltrans-retinoic acid and BrdUrd were purchased from Sigma. After 7 days of incubation, cells were harvested and expression of carbohydrate epitopes on the cell surface was determined. Next, binding to Gb4-coated solid phase was performed as described above. For determination of the effect of mAbs on 2102 cell adhesion, cells (1 × 106/ml) were separately incubated in control medium or medium containing IgM mAbs 2D4 (anti-Gg3) (23Young W.W.J.

After washing with serum-free medium, the cells were resuspended in 1% BSA in DMEM and used for binding assay. The effect of anti-Gb4 mAb 9G7 on Gb4-dependent 2102 cell adhesion was also studied by pretreatment of Gb4-coated plates with 9G7 (concentrations ranged from 0 to 1 μg/well), followed by addition of 2102 cells. Each well of a 96-well plate was coated with 1.0 nmol of Gb4 by evaporation of ethanol solution at 37 °C. Each well was first incubated with 1% BSA in PBS (for blocking nonspecific binding), after which was added 100 μl of aqueous micellar solution of nLc4 or GalGb4 containing various quantities (5, 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 nmol), and incubated 2 h at 37 °C. As a negative control, wells were incubated with BSA as above and 100 μl of aqueous micellar solution of Gb4 containing the same quantity range (5–50 nmol) was added. Next, aqueous micellar solution of GSL in each well was removed by aspiration, and 105 2102 cells were added to each well. After incubation for 1 h, non-adherent cells were washed out of the plate, and quantity of adherent cells was determined by absorbance of stained cells in each well as described above. Large quantities of 2102 cells (approximately 1 × 107) were adhered simultaneously to 10-cm cell culture plates coated with GSL or containing DISAM. GSL-coated plates were prepared by adding 6 ml of ethanol solution containing 300 nmol of Gb4 or Gg3 and air-drying inside a sterile hood. Ethanol solutions without GSL were treated under the same conditions, as controls. DISAM was prepared as follows. 2102 cells were cultured in 10-cm plates. 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS was added to cell monolayer after confluence, and the plates were shaken in a gyratory shaker for 15 min at 4 °C and aspirated. All cells were detached or dissolved, and no cells remained on the plates. The residue remaining on the plate (i.e. DISAM) was washed five times with PBS and prepared for cell binding. DISAM thus prepared contained the majority of GSL at cell adhesion sites and membrane-associated pericellular matrix, as described previously (28Carter W.G. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6953-6960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Okada Y. Mugnai G. Bremer E.G. Hakomori S. Exp. Cell Res. 1984; 155: 448-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). 2102 cells from confluent culture were detached by 0.52 mmEDTA and centrifuged, the cell pellet was suspended in 1% FBS/DMEM, and 6 ml of cell suspension containing 107 cells was placed in Gb4- or Gg3-coated or DISAM-containing plates. Cell adhesion was initiated by centrifugation. Several plates were stacked in a hanging holder (“microplate carrier”) designed for use in a centrifuge, and centrifuged at 600 rpm for 5 min. The time at the end of centrifugation was defined as the start of adhesion. After incubation (which began immediately after centrifugation) for 15, 30, or 60 min at 37 °C in CO2 incubator, cells adhering to the bottom of the plates were subjected to nuclear protein extraction. Cells, adhered and incubated as above, were harvested by scraping with rubber policeman, centrifuged, and washed once with 1 ml of PBS and once with 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, and 1.5 mmMgCl2, pH 7.9, 4 °C). Cells were lysed by suspending the cell pellet in 30 μl of lysis buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 10 min on ice, by the mini-preparation method described previously (30Bomsztyk K. Toivola B. Emery D.W. Rooney J.W. Dower S.K. Rachie N.A. Hopkins-Sibley C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9413-9417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To isolate nuclei, the lysis buffer suspension was vigorously mixed and centrifuged in a microcentrifuge (5 min at 15,000 rpm, 4 °C). Nuclear proteins were extracted by resuspending the nuclear pellet in 20 μl of protein extraction buffer (420 mmNaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 25% glycerol, pH 7.9) for 10 min at 4 °C. After vigorous mixing, the nuclear suspension was microcentrifuged (5 min, 15000 rpm, 4 °C), the pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was microcentrifuged under the same conditions as above. The supernatant from the second centrifugation was diluted with 30 μl of diluting buffer (50 mm KCl, 20 mmHEPES, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol, pH 7.9) and the protein concentration was measured (Micro BCA protein assay, Pierce). Protease inhibitors, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin were added to both lysis and extraction buffers just before use. The diluting buffer contained the same amounts of dithiothreitol and leupeptin, but only 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The nuclear protein samples were stored at −80 °C until use. Oligonucleotides containing consensus binding sites for AP1, AP2, CREB, E2F1, Egr, NFκB, and SP1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA. The oligonucleotide probes were end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (30Bomsztyk K. Toivola B. Emery D.W. Rooney J.W. Dower S.K. Rachie N.A. Hopkins-Sibley C. J. Biol.

Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, 25 ng of each oligonucleotide, 20 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP were mixed in a microcentrifuge tube, and brought to 20 μl with T4 kinase buffer. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and the labeled probe was separated from unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP using QIAquick nucleotide removal kit (QIAGEN). Equal amounts of protein from each sample were mixed with a reaction buffer (1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, and 5% glycerol) containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 ng of end-labeled oligonucleotide probe. For competition experiments, 40 ng of each cold probe was added to each reaction. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. For supershift assay, 2 μl of specific mAb directed to AP1 family transcription factors c-Jun and c-Fos, or anti-CREB mAb ATF-1, was first added to each reaction mixture. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, 32P-labeled probe was added to the reaction mixture, which was incubated for another 30 min at room temperature. For each type of assay, samples were then loaded onto a 4% polyacrylamide gel (prerun at 150 V, 4 °C, 2 h) and run at 500 V, 4 °C. Dried gels were allowed to expose film (Kodak, X-Omat) for 12–16 h at room temperature with intensifying screens. Cytofluorometric patterns of a few carbohydrate epitopes expressed at the surface of undifferentiated human embryonal carcinoma 2102 cells are shown in Fig. 1. The patterns are characterized by high expression of nLc4 and SSEA-3 (principal epitope, GalGb4) and moderate expression of Gb4. Gg3, defined by mAb 2D4, was not expressed (data not shown). Binding of liposomes containing Gb4 to 96-well plates coated with various GSLs indicated strong interaction of the liposomes with nLc4 (Fig. 2 A), weaker interaction with GalGb4 and Lex pentaosyl-Cer (Fig. 2 B), and no interaction with Lc3, GM1, sialosylparagloboside (Fig. 2 A), or with Gb4, Gb3, or GM3 (Fig. 2 B). Gb4-liposomes also did not interact with mono- or disialosyl-GalGb4 (SSEA-4), Leapentaosyl-Cer, or Leb hexaosyl-Cer (data not shown). Gb4-liposomes interacted strongly with Gg3-coated plates (data not shown); however, Gg3 and other ganglio-series GSLs are absent in 2102 cells. Interaction of Gb4-liposome with nLc4-, GalGb4-, or Lex GSL-coated plates was clearly dependent on the quantity of these GSLs coated on plates, in contrast to the absence of adhesion and the lack of dose-dependent interaction with Gb3, Lc3, Lea, Leb, GM1, GM3, sialosylparagloboside, monosialosyl GalGb4, and Gb4. Significantly, Gb4-liposome interaction with nLc4, GalGb4, and Lex was observed even in the absence of bivalent cation or in the presence of 15 mmEDTA. 4Dependence of Lex-Lex, GM3-Gg3, and GalCer-sulfatide interactions on bivalent cation (Ca2+, Mg2+) has been well documented (6Eggens I. Fenderson B. Toyokuni T. Dean B. Stroud M. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9476-9484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kojima N. Hakomori S. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3496-3499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast, the strong interaction of KDN-GM3 with Gg3, the basis of sperm-egg adhesion in rainbow trout, does not require bivalent cation (Y. Song, K. Kitajima, S. Inoue, S. Kudo, N. Kojima, S. Hakomori, and Y. Inoue, unpublished data). Similarly, interaction of Gb4 with nLc4 or with GalGb4 does not require bivalent cation. The molecular basis of bivalent cation dependence versus independence in carbohydrate-carbohydrate interaction is currently unknown. 2102 cells, characterized as high expressors of nLc4 and SSEA-3, adhered strongly to Gg3- and Gb4-coated plates, but not to Gb3-, Lc3-, Lea-, Leb-, GM1-, or GM3-coated plates so far tested. This adhesion depended on the quantity of GSL coated (Fig. 3 A), and occurred rapidly, reaching maximal value within 30 min. There was no significant increase during prolonged incubation time (data not shown). 2102 cell adhesion to Gg3-coated plates was clear and strong, but has no physiological significance since Gg3 is absent in these cells. The partner ligand expressed at the 2102 cell surface that binds to Gb4 coated on plates might be nLc4 or GalGb4, but not Gb4 per se, as indicated by liposome binding assay (Fig. 2 B). To clarify this point, the effect of micellar GSL solutions and anti-GSL antibodies on Gb4-dependent 2102 cell adhesion was studied. The adhesion was inhibited when plates were preincubated with micellar aqueous solution of nLc4 (Fig. 4 A), and to a slightly lesser extent with micellar solution of GalGb4 (Fig. 4 B). The adhesion was not inhibited (on the contrary, it was slightly enhanced) when plates were preincubated with Gb4 (Fig. 4 C). These results indicate that nLc4 and GalGb4 expressed at the surface of 2102 cells are both involved in Gb4-dependent 2102 cell adhesion. Involvement of nLc4 and GalGb4 in this process was further confirmed by the fact that the adhesion was inhibited when cells were preincubated with mAb 1B2 (anti-nLc4) or with mAb MC631 (anti-SSEA-3), but not with mAb 2D4 (anti-Gg3) or with mAb 9G7 (anti-Gb4) (Fig. 3 B). 5Preincubation of 2102 cells with anti-SSEA-3 mAb MC631 inhibits Gb4-dependent cell adhesion only at high concentration (10–20 μg/ml), but not at lower concentration (1–2 μg/ml). The inhibitory effects of anti-carbohydrate antibodies on cell adhesion varied extensively depending on antibody affinity and quantity of antigen expressed at the cell surface. Compaction of morula is inhibited, or once-compacted embryo is decompacted, by multivalent lacto-N-neotetraose III (Lex) structure (11Fenderson B.A. Zehavi U. Hakomori S. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1591-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Thus, Lex is obviously involved in the compaction process, and the mechanism is"

Such high energies may indicate that the gamma rays from Markarian 501 are due to the acceleration of protons rather than electrons. Furthermore, the observed absence of gamma ray attenuation due to electron-positron pair production in collisions with cosmic infrared photons implies a limit of 2 to 4 nanowatts per square meter per steradian for the energy flux of an extragalactic infrared radiation background at a wavelength of 25 micrometers. This limit provides important clues about the epoch of galaxy formation."

K+ deprivation promotes H+-K+-ATPase α2 (HKα2) gene expression in the medullary collecting duct, the principal site of active K+ reabsorption, suggesting that this isozyme contributes to renal K+ reclamation. We report here that alternative transcriptional initiation and mRNA splicing give rise to distinct N-terminal variants of the HKα2 subunit. Sequence analysis and in vitro translation revealed that HKα2a corresponds to the known HKα2 cDNA (Crowson, M. S., and Shull, G. E. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 13740–13748), whereas HKα2b represents a novel variant truncated by 108 amino acids at its N terminus. HKα2b mRNA contains a complex 5′-untranslated region with eight upstream open reading frames, features implicated in translational regulation of other genes. Heterologous expression of HKα2b with and without the gastric H+-K+-ATPase β subunit in HEK 293 cells indicated that this variant encodes a K+ uptake mechanism that is relatively Sch 28080-resistant, partially sensitive to ouabain, and appears to require coexpression with the gastric H+-K+-ATPase β subunit for optimal functional activity. Northern analysis demonstrated that both subtypes (HKα2b > HKα2a) are expressed abundantly in distal colon and modestly in proximal colon and kidney. Moreover, the abundance of the two mRNAs increases coordinately among the renal zones, but not in colon, with chronic K+ deprivation.

The maintenance of body potassium (K+) balance is critical to the normal function of all cells. Perturbations in K+ homeostasis disrupt normal cell growth and division, metabolism, volume and osmotic regulation, acid-base economy, and the excitability of nerve and contractile cells. The kidney is the principal arbiter of body K+ balance in mammals, adjusting K+ excretion to match large variations in dietary K+ intake. The late distal tubule and collecting duct have the dual ability to secrete and reabsorb K+ as needed to effect this balance (1Okusa M.D. Unwin R.J. Velzaquez H. Giebisch G. Wright F.S. Am. J.

Ickes J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G59-G62Crossref Google Scholar). The H+-K+-ATPases constitute a subfamily of isozymes that belong to the X+-K+-ATPase multigene family, which also includes the Na+-K+-ATPase isoforms. the X+-K+-ATPases share common catalytic and ion transport mechanisms and an apparent requirement for heterodimeric (α:β) structure. the X+-K+-ATPase α subunits exhibit considerable (∼65%) structural homology and contribute most of the functional properties of the holoenzymes, but they can be distinguished to a degree from one another on the basis of organ distributions and sensitivities to the inhibitors ouabain and Sch 28080 (13Kone B.C.

To date, three distinct H+-K+-ATPase α subunits have been cloned from mammals, structurally characterized, and expressed in heterologous systems.

The pharmacological signature of the HKα1 protein is its high sensitivity to inhibition by Sch 28080 and its complete resistance to inhibition by ouabain (15Mathews P.M. Claeys D. Jaisser F.

Recent studies by our laboratory and others have shown that chronic K+ deprivation enhances HKα2, but not HKα1 (3Ahn K.Y. Turner P.B. Madsen K.M. Kone B.C. Am. J.

Physiol. 1997; 272: C685-C696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), HKα2 protein levels, but not mRNA levels, were enhanced in the outer medulla of K+-deprived rats, suggesting the potential operation of translational or post-translational control mechanisms. In contrast to kidney, chronic hypokalemia does not appear to alter HKα2 mRNA (5Jaisser F. Escoubet B. Coutry N. Eugene E. Bonvalet J.P. Am. J.

Moreover, recent work demonstrating disparate effects of adrenalectomy, dexamethasone treatment (5Jaisser F. Escoubet B. Coutry N. Eugene E. Bonvalet J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C679-C687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and dietary Na+ depletion (8Sangan P. Rajendran V.M. Mann A.S. Kashgarian M. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C685-C696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on HKα2 abundance in the rat outer medulla and distal colon indicated that cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms govern HKα2 gene expression in these tissues. Since both transcriptional and translational control mechanisms, as well as alternative mRNA splicing, can lead to regulated, tissue-specific gene expression, we hypothesized that these mechanisms might operate to confer structural and/or regulatory diversity to the HKα2 subunit gene. Although the structural organization of the rat and human HKα1 (23Newman P.R. Greeb J. Keeton T.P. Reyes A.A. Shull G.E. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 749-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and human ATP1AL1 (24Sverdlov V.E. Kostina M.B. Modyanov N.N. Genomics. 1996; 32: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) genes is known, that of the rat HKα2 gene has not been described. We report here that distinct transcription initiation sites in the rat HKα2 gene and alternative mRNA splicing, combined regulatory mechanisms not known to be utilized by other members of the X+-K+-ATPase α subunit family, direct the synthesis of two N-terminal HKα2 variants that are expressed principally, if not exclusively, in the kidney and colon and that appear to respond coordinately in kidney to chronic K+deprivation. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (180–220 g) were fed normal rat chow (150 mEq KCl/kg chow, TD88081, Harlan Teklad) or a nominally K+-free (TD88082, Harlan Teklad) diet for 2 weeks. This K+-restriction protocol reproducibly results in significant hypokalemia (3Ahn K.Y. Turner P.B. Madsen K.M. Kone B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F566-F577Google Scholar) and has been used in our previous studies (3Ahn K.Y. Turner P.B. Madsen K.M. Kone B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F566-F577Google Scholar, 6Ahn K.Y. Park K.Y. Kim K.K. Kone B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F314-F321PubMed Google Scholar). PCR primers not included in specific kits were synthesized by Genosys, Inc. (The Woodlands, TX). The sequences of the various HKα2 subunit primers are presented in Fig. 1 A, and those of the HKβg subunit are given below. The 5′-RACE protocol was performed using the MarathonTM cDNA Amplification Kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNAs were generated from 1 μg of rat kidney poly(A)+ RNA, using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and a modified locking oligo(dT) primer containing two degenerate nucleotide positions at its 3′ end provided with the kit. Second strand synthesis was accomplished with a mixture of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, RNase H, and E. coli DNA ligase. After creation of blunt ends with T4 DNA polymerase, the double-stranded cDNA was ligated to adapter primer 1 furnished with the kit, using T4 DNA ligase. The anchor-ligated cDNAs were then subjected to 5′-RACE using a nested primer (adapter primer 2, supplied with the RACE kit) complementary to adapter primer 1, HKα2-specific reverse primer (P1, Fig. 1 A) complementary to nucleotides +344 to +325 of the published HKα2 cDNA sequence (17Crowson M.S. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13740-13748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the components of the AdvantageTM cDNA Amplification Kit (CLONTECH). PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 94 °C × 1 min, followed by 28 cycles of 94 °C × 30 s, 68 °C × 4 min, and a final step of 68 °C × 4 min. Ten μl of the amplified products were separated by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining and UV shadowing. The final amplicons were then subcloned into the plasmid vector pCR2.1TM (Invitrogen) and sequenced on both strands by a cycle sequencing method. To establish the coding sequences 3′ to the alternative splice site of the HKα2b variant (see “Results”), the complete encoding DNA was PCR-amplified from oligo(dT)17-primed rat kidney cDNA, using the HKα2b-specific sense primer P5 (Fig. 1 A) and a common antisense primer (P10, 5′-GCTCGAGGAATCATAGTCTAGC-3′) located in the 3′-UTR (nucleotides 3647–3667) of the published HKα2 sequence (17Crowson M.S. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13740-13748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An XhoI site (underlined) was incorporated into the 5′ end of the primer to facilitate eventual subcloning into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1−/Neo (Invitrogen). The amplicons were first subcloned into pCR2.1TM and sequenced on both strands. The sequence-verified encoding DNA for HKα2b was then excised from pCR2.1TM and cloned into the XbaI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1−/Neo downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The resultant recombinant molecule was designated pcDNA3.1−/HKα2b-Neo. The encoding DNA of the rat HKβg subunit was PCR-amplified from rat stomach cDNA using primers flanking the coding region: sense 5′- ATAAGCTTCAGCCCTGCAGGAGAAG-3′ (nucleotides +16 to +32 of the published sequence (25Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12123-12126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and antisense 5′- ATTCTAGATTACTTCTGTATTGTGAGC-3′ (nucleotides +878 to +896 of the published sequence). HindIII and XbaI sites (underlined) were added to the 5′ ends of the sense and antisense HKβg primers, respectively, to facilitate subcloning. The resultant amplicon was digested with HindIII and XbaI and subcloned into these sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1+/Zeo (yielding the recombinant pcDNA3.1/HKβg-Zeo). The insert HKβg DNA was sequenced to verify its authenticity. Antisense primers (Fig. 1 A) specific for HKα2a (P7) and HKα2b (P8 and P9) were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The primers were annealed to 10 μg of total RNA from distal colon at 58 °C for 20 min. After cooling at room temperature for 10 min, the primers were extended with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase at 42 °C for 15 min in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, at 42 °C, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm each dNTP, 0.5 mm spermidine, and 2.8 mm sodium pyrophosphate. The reactions were stopped by the addition of gel loading dye, and the samples were heated at 90 °C for 10 min. The primer extension products were resolved by electrophoresis on 8% acrylamide, 7 m urea polyacrylamide gels in TBE buffer. The sizes of the primer extension products were established by comparison with a sequence ladder generated by cycle sequencing with the 32P-labeled primer used for each extension reaction and the HKα2 partial genomic DNA clone (see “Results”) as template. The 5′ end of the HKα2 gene was analyzed using the Rat PromoterFinderTM DNA Walking Kit (CLONTECH), which contains separate pools (“libraries”) of uncloned, genomic DNA that have been predigested with EcoRV, ScaI, DraI, PvuII, or SspI and ligated to an oligonucleotide anchor (adapter primer 1). A nested PCR approach was employed. In the first round, aliquots of each “library” were amplified with adapter primer 1 and HKα2 primer P1, using a program of 94 °C × 25 s, 72 °C × 4 min for 7 cycles, 94 °C × 25 s, 67 °C × 4 min for 32 cycles, and 67 °C × 4 min for 1 cycle. After analysis of an aliquot of the PCR products on a 1.2% agarose gel, the remaining PCR products were diluted 1:50 in sterile deionized H20 and subjected to a second round of PCR, using the nested adapter primer 2 and the nested HKα2 primer P2 (Fig. 1 A) in a program of 94 °C × 25 s, 72 °C × 4 min for 7 cycles, 94 °C × 25 s, 67 °C × 4 min for 20 cycles, and 67 °C × 4 min for 1 cycle. The amplified products were separated by electrophoresis in a 0.9% agarose gel, subcloned into pCR2.1TM, and sequenced on both strands by a cycle sequencing method. Total RNA was extracted from selected tissues and renal parenchymal zones of normal and K+-deprived rats using RNAzol B (Tel-Test). The samples were quantitated by spectrophotometry at 260 nm. Isoform-specific cDNAs of roughly comparable length (Fig. 1 A) were generated by PCR from the cloned HKα2a and HKα2b cDNAs, using primer pairs P3 + P4 and P5 + P6 (Fig. 1 A) directed at the unique 5′ exonic sequences of the HKα2a and HKα2b isoforms, respectively. Sequence analysis showed that these regions exhibited no significant homology to each other or to any sequence in the GenBank data base. A rat GAPDH cDNA (nucleotides 469–984, Ref. 26Tso J.Y. Sun X.H. Kao T.H. Reece K.S. Wu R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2485-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar) was also generated by PCR. For Northern analysis, the GAPDH and HKα2a- and HKα2b-specific cDNAs were radiolabeled with 32P by the random primer method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Prime-a-Gene, Promega, Madison, WI). Fifteen μg of total RNA per lane were separated by size on 1% agarose, 2% formaldehyde gels and blotted to nylon membranes (Hybond N, Amersham Corp.). After UV cross-linking, the blots were visualized under UV light, hybridized for 2 h at 68 °C in QuickHyb solution (Stratagene) with probes specific for HKα2a, HKα2b, or GAPDH (as an additional control for RNA quality and equality of sample loading and transfer), and washed to a final stringency of 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% (s/v) SDS at 60 °C. Autoradiographs of the blots were prepared at −70 °C. In several experiments (as indicated in the figure legends), the blots were sequentially hybridized with HKα2a and HKα2b DNA probes of comparable size and specific activity, followed by the GAPDH DNA probe, with the blots being stripped before proceeding to the next analysis. After each stripping, autoradiographs of the blots were prepared to verify removal of the probe. pcDNA3.1−/HKα2b-Neo and the HKα2a encoding DNA subcloned into the vector pAGA2 (16Codina J. Kone B.C. Dalmas-Mata J.T. DuBose Jr., T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29759-29763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) were transcribed and translated in the presence of [35S]methionine with T7 RNA polymerase and the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate kit (Promega, Madison, WI). The synthesized proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by fluorography. HEK 293 cells were grown in modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 5 ng/ml selenium, and 2 mml-glutamine (complete medium). Subconfluent HEK 293 cells grown on 10-mm culture dishes were transfected with pcDNA3.1−/Neo (as a vector control) or pcDNA3.1/HKα2b-Neo with the Tfx-50 reagent (Boehringer Mannheim) to yield HEK-NEO and HEK-HKα2b cell lines, respectively. In brief, 10 μg of plasmid DNA and 22 μl of Tfx-50 reagent were mixed with 6 ml of modified Eagle's medium. The mixture was added to the monolayers and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Twelve ml of prewarmed complete medium was then overlaid onto the medium, and the cells were returned to the incubator. After 48 h, the medium was replaced with complete medium containing 600 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). The G418-containing medium was replaced every 3 days until individual resistant colonies were isolated and established in culture as individual lines. All lines were maintained in G418 medium and frozen after one to three in vitro passages. HEK-HKα2b clone 25 was used in the functional analysis detailed below. To test whether coexpression of the HKβg affected functional expression of HKα2b, HEK-NEO and HEK-HKα2b cell lines were stably transfected with pcDNA3.1/HKβg-Zeo and selected in complete medium containing 600 μg/ml G418 and 250 μg/ml Zeocin. Cells surviving selection were screened for HKα2b and/or HKβg expression by Northern analysis with probes specific for each subunit. The doubly transfected cells were termed HEK-HKα2b/HKβg, and clone 40 was selected for further functional analysis. Uptake of86Rb+, a K+ congener, was measured at 37 °C in transfected HEK 293 cells grown in 24-well plates according to a published protocol (22Grishin A.V. Bevensee M.O. Modyanov N.N. Rajendran V. Boron W.F. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C992-C997Google Scholar). Monolayers were rinsed five times and preincubated in uptake buffer (145 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 10 mm glucose, 1.2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mmNaH2PO4, 32 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 200 μm bumetanide) at 37 °C for 20 min in the presence or absence of different concentrations of ouabain as indicated in the figure legends. External 1 mm K+ was used in these assays, because K+ competitively inhibits both Sch 28080 and ouabain binding toX+-K+-ATPase α subunits, and this concentration is within the narrow range of Kmvalues reported for K+ dependence of all knownX+-K+-ATPase α subunits. Uptake was initiated by adding 0.2 ml of uptake buffer containing ∼4 μCi/ml 86Rb+. After 12 min, the reaction was stopped by six rapid washes with ice-cold stop buffer (100 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HEPES, pH 7.4). Parametric studies indicated that this time point was in the linear range of uptake. The cells were solubilized in 2% SDS, 0.1n NaOH, and the resulting extracts were measured for86Rb+ by Cerenkov radiation and for protein content by the BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). Triplicate or quadruplicate measurements were obtained in each uptake condition. The intensities of bands on the Northern blot autoradiograms were measured by whole band densitometry software running on a SPARC Station IPC (Sun Microsystems, Mountain View, CA) equipped with an image analysis system (BioImage, Ann Arbor, MI). Predictions of membrane-spanning regions and their orientation were generated by the TMpred program (27Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 166Google Scholar) through the ISREC Bioinformatics Group server. Predictions of potential promoter regions were obtained with a neural networks algorithm (28Reese, M. G., Harris, N. L., and Eeckman, F. H. (1996) in Proceedings of the Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing(Hunter, L., and Klein, T., eds) Kona, HI.Google Scholar) through the LBNL Human Genome Informatics Group server. Potential regulatory motifs in the HKα2 gene were identified with Transcription Element Search Software from the Computational Biology and Informatics Laboratory server of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, using the Transfac 3.1 data base. Quantitative data are presented as mean ± S.E. and were analyzed for significance by analysis of variance. Significance was assigned at p < 0.05. The anchor-ligated cDNAs synthesized from rat kidney mRNA were subjected to 5′-RACE using adapter primer 2 and HKα2-specific primer P1 from exon 2 (Fig. 1 A). Two distinct PCR products of ∼400 and ∼600 bp, subsequently shown to correspond to the 5′ ends of HKα2a and HKα2b, respectively, were consistently amplified. These products were isolated, subcloned, and sequenced. A total of 16 RACE reactions for both amplicons was analyzed in this manner. The two RACE product subtypes differed in sequence at their 5′ ends but were identical at their 3′ ends, with common sequence beginning at the codon for Lys4 of the known HKα2a sequence (Fig. 1 A). HKα2a was identical in sequence to the corresponding region of the HKα2 cDNA reported by Crowson and Shull (17Crowson M.S. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13740-13748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but included an additional 72 bp at its 5′ end, so that the total 5′-UTR was 274 bp. By using a sense primer from the 5′-UTR of HKα2b and an antisense primer derived from the 3′-UTR of the published HKα2 cDNA (17Crowson M.S. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13740-13748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a 3847-bp cDNA, including the entire HKα2b coding region, was PCR-amplified from rat"
https://openalex.org/W2063224703,"Heptosyltransferase I, encoded by the rfaC(waaC) gene of Escherichia coli, is thought to addl-glycero-d-manno-heptose to the inner 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) residue of the lipopolysaccharide core. Lipopolysaccharide isolated from mutants defective in rfaC lack heptose and all other sugars distal to heptose. The putative donor, ADP-l-glycero-d-manno-heptose, has never been fully characterized and is not readily available. In cell extracts, the analog ADP-mannose can serve as an alternative donor for RfaC-catalyzed glycosylation of the acceptor, Kdo2-lipid IVA. Using a T7 promoter construct that overexpresses RfaC ∼15,000-fold, the enzyme has been purified to near homogeneity. NH2-terminal sequencing confirms that the purified enzyme is the rfaC gene product. The subunit molecular mass is 36 kDa. Enzymatic activity is dependent upon the presence of Triton X-100 and is maximal at pH 7.5. The apparentKm (determined at near saturating concentrations of the second substrate) is 1.5 mm for ADP-mannose and 4.5 μm for Kdo2-lipid IVA. Chemical hydrolysis of the RfaC reaction product at 100 °C in the presence of sodium acetate and 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate generates fragments consistent with the inner Kdo residue of Kdo2-lipid IVA as the site of mannosylation. The analog, Kdo-lipid IVA, functions as an acceptor, but is mannosylated at less than 1% the rate of Kdo2-lipid IVA. The purified enzyme displays no activity with ADP-glucose, GDP-mannose, UDP-glucose, or UDP-galactose. Mannosylation of Kdo2-lipid IVA catalyzed by RfaC proceeds in high yield and may be useful for the synthesis of lipopolysaccharide analogs. Pure RfaC can also be used together with Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA to assay for the physiological donor (presumably ADP-l-glycero-d-manno-heptose) in a crude, low molecular weight fraction isolated from wild type cells.

It is composed of three domains (Fig. 1): 1) a hydrophobic anchor, known as lipid A, that consists of an acylated disaccharide of glucosamine; 2) a non-repeating oligosaccharide, designated the core, that serves as a barrier to many antibiotics; and 3) the O-antigen, that extends outwards from the core and is comprised of a distinct repeating oligosaccharide. All components of LPS are required for the virulence of Gram-negative bacteria (1Raetz C.R.H. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1.

Previous studies of E. coli and Salmonellaheptosyltransferase I suffered from some of the above mentioned limitations (17Sirisena D.M. Brozek K.A. MacLachlan P.R. Sanderson K.E. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

Since synthetic ADP-l-glycero-d-manno-heptose was not available, partially purified preparations of ADP-heptose, isolated from cells of Shigella sonnei (22Kontrohr T. Kocsis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7715-7718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were utilized. However, the heptosyl acceptor employed, Kdo2-lipid IVA, was well characterized (23Brozek K.A. Hosaka K. Robertson A.D. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6956-6966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kdo2-lipid IVA is thought to be capable of acquiring a complete corein vivo (24Walenga R.W. Osborn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4257-4263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Even so, the products generated by thisin vitro system could only be isolated in radiochemical amounts insufficient for physical analysis (17Sirisena D.M. Brozek K.A. MacLachlan P.R. Sanderson K.E.

Recently, we have described a new assay for heptosyltransferase I of E. coli, using commercially available ADP-mannose as an alternative donor in place of ADP-l-glycero-d-manno-heptose (21Kadrmas J.L. Brozek K.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32119-32125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 2. ADP-mannose is a naturally occurring sugar nucleotide found in corn (25Dankert M. Passeron S. Recondo E. Leloir L.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1964; 14: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 26Passeron S. Recondo E. Dankert M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 89: 372-374PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we report the first characterization of the catalytic properties of heptosyltransferase I, using ADP-mannose as the donor and Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA as the acceptor. We have purified RfaC to near homogeneity using this optimized assay system, and we have characterized the product as mannosyl-Kdo2-lipid IVA (proposed structure shown in Fig. 2). We have also devised a new procedure for the isolation of a crude (low molecular weight) sugar nucleotide-containing fraction from various strains of E. coli and Salmonella. Assays utilizing these sugar nucleotide preparations in place of ADP-mannose demonstrate that pure RfaC is capable of glycosylating Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA with a single sugar presumed to be ADP-l-glycero-d-manno-heptose. This reaction should serve as a functional assay for the definitive isolation and structural characterization of the elusive endogenous heptosyl donor of LPS biosynthesis.

Prior to each use, these substrates were subjected to ultrasonic irradiation in a water bath for 60 s. Unless indicated, reaction mixtures (10–40 μl) contained 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 μm Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA at 80,000 cpm/nmol, and 1.0 mm ADP-mannose (21Kadrmas J.L. Brozek K.A.

The enzyme source, added last to initiate the reaction, contained 1 mg/ml BSA when diluted to less than 1 μg/ml. The enzyme generally comprised 1/10 of the reaction volume. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 5–60 min. Reactions were terminated by spotting 5-μl portions of the reaction mixture onto a Silica Gel 60 thin layer plate. After drying in a stream of cold air, plates were developed in chloroform/pyridine/88% formic acid/water (30:70:16:10, v/v). The plate was dried and then exposed to a PhosphorImager screen overnight. The amount of product formed was calculated from the percent conversion of the radioactive substrate (of known specific radioactivity) to product. Plasmids were prepared using the Promega Wizard Miniprep kit. Restriction endonucleases, shrimp alkaline phosphatase, and T4 DNA ligase were all used according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA fragments were isolated from agarose gels using a Qiaex II gel extraction kit (Qiagen). All other techniques involving manipulation of nucleic acids were from Ausubelet al. (39Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989Google Scholar). Cells were made competent for electroporation by resuspension in 10% glycerol (39Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989Google Scholar), as described. Transformation of plasmid DNA into competent cells was performed by high voltage electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II at 2.5 kV, 200 ohms, and 25 microfarads. The cloning of PCR-generated rfaC DNA into a vector under T7 promoter control is outlined in Fig. 3 (40Rosenberg A.H. Lade B.N. Chui D.S. Lin S., J.J., D. Studier F.W.

The forward primer was synthesized with a GC clamp, an NdeI restriction site, and an rfaC coding strand starting at the translation initiation site (primer sequences are shown in legend for Fig. 3). The reverse primer was synthesized with a GC clamp, aBamHI restriction site, and an rfaC anticoding strand that includes the stop site. The PCR was performed usingPfu polymerase, as specified by the manufacturer. The plasmid pLC10–7 (28Creeger E.S. Rothfield L.I. J. Biol.

Rev. 1992; 56: 137-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as the template. Amplification was carried out in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 100 ng of template, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% BSA, 2 mm MgSO4, 250 μm of each of the dNTPs, 200 ng of each primer, and 1.2 units of Pfu polymerase. The reaction was subjected to 30 cycles of denaturation (1 min, 94 °C), annealing (1 min, 55 °C), and extension (1.5 min, 72 °C) in a DNA thermal cycler. The reaction product was analyzed on a 1% agarose gel, digested withNdeI and BamHI, and ligated into the expression vector pET3a that had been similarly digested. The resulting desired hybrid plasmid (designated pJK1) was transformed into E. coli SURE cells, reisolated and digested again to verify its structure, and finally transformed into cells of strain BLR(DE3)pLysS. BLR(DE3)pLysS/pET3a and BLR(DE3)pLysS/pJK1 were grown from a single colony in 1 liter of LB medium (43Miller J.R. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml) at 37 °C until the A600 reached approximately 0.5. The culture was split into two equal portions, and one portion was induced with 100 μg/ml IPTG. Both cultures were incubated with shaking at 225 rpm for an additional 3 h at 37 °C, the A600 was recorded, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 6000 × gav at 4 °C. All subsequent steps were performed either on ice or at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in a minimal volume, typically 10 ml of 50 mmHepes, pH 7.5, and broken by passage through a 5-ml French pressure cell at 18,000 p.s.i. Unbroken cells and debris were removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 6000 × g. The resulting crude extract supernatant was used to prepare membranes. The crude extract was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 ×gav for 60 min. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 1.5 ml of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. The protein content of each fraction was determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (44Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar) using BSA as the standard. A 1 ml portion containing 8–10 mg/ml protein of the BLR(DE3)pLysS/pJK1 membranes was mixed with an equal volume of 2% Triton X-100 and incubated on ice for 2 h with periodic gentle inversion of the tube. The solubilization mixture was then centrifuged at 100,000 × gav for 60 min to remove any unsolubilized proteins. The pellet was resuspended in 750 μl of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and the protein contents of both the solubilized and unsolubilized fractions were determined by the BCA assay (44Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). One gram of Reactive Green 19 resin suspended in 5 ml of water was equilibrated in a small plastic disposable column with 10 column volumes of equilibration buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100). A 4-mg sample of solubilized membrane proteins (in 1.25 ml) was diluted 10-fold with 50 mm Hepes pH 7.5, and the material was then applied to the column at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions of 2.5 ml were collected throughout. Next, the column was washed with 25 ml of equilibration buffer. Elution was carried out in three stages: 1) 25 ml of equilibration buffer plus 0.5 m NaCl, 2) 25 ml of equilibration buffer plus 1.0 m NaCl, and, finally, 3) 25 ml of equilibration buffer plus 2.5 m NaCl. The protein content of each fraction was determined using the BCA assay (44Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). The peak of enzyme activity was determined by assaying each fraction in the linear range under standard conditions for detection of mannose transfer to Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA. The protein in certain samples was also visualized by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS, using the Laemmli buffer system (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) in conjunction with Bio-Rad Mini-Protean II electrophoresis equipment. Approximately 20 μg (400 μl) of Green 19 purified protein was concentrated 40-fold on a Microcon 10 device, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The concentrated sample was loaded onto a 10% polyacrylamide SDS gel along with a lane containing prestained standards as a control for transfer. Electrophoresis was carried out at 200 V for 50 min in a Laemmli gel buffer system. The gel was then soaked in 10 mm CAPS, pH 11, for 10 min at 4 °C. A polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was prepared while the electrophoresis was in progress by brief soaking in methanol, rinsing with water, and then soaking in 10 mm CAPS, pH 11. A Bio-Rad SD electroblotter was used according to the manufacturer's directions at 20 V for 40 min. Protein bands transferred to the membrane were visualized by Coomassie staining, and the band of interest was excised. NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing of the intact protein was carried out by Dr. John Leszyk of the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology, Shrewsbury, MA. Two 10-μl reaction mixtures were prepared containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.4 μm Kdo2-lipid IVA (1 × 107 cpm/nmol or 40,000 cpm/reaction), and 1 mmADP-mannose. To only one tube, 0.3 μg/ml purified RfaC was added. Both tubes were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Next, 4 μl of 10% SDS and 26 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate pH 4.5 were added (46Cano E. Mahadevan L.C.

However, when these cells are transferred to medium containing G-CSF, the cell number increases 4 – 5-fold and after 12 days the entire population is differentiated into granulocytes followed by apoptotic death. In our search for genes that are induced during apoptosis and/or terminal differentiation of 32Dcl3 cells, we identified a novel gene termed AATYK (Apoptosis Associated Tyrosine Kinase), whose expression is dramatically upregulated during IL-3 deprivation as well as G-CSF-induced terminal differentiation. In this report, we describe the sequence of the cDNA clone, derived from the mRNA transcript of this gene. These studies show that this gene encodes a protein with a tyrosine kinase domain at the N-terminal end and a proline-rich domain at the C-terminal end. We also report that the expression of this gene is blocked in v-abl or bcr – abl transformed myeloid cells which are unable to apoptose when grown in the absence of IL-3. However, AATYK expression is induced in 32D cells transformed by the v-abl gene when these cells are incubated in the presence of DMSO, which induces growth arrest and apoptotic death of the cells. On the other hand, DMSO fails to induce apoptosis or AATYK expression in 32D cells transformed by the bcr – abl oncogene, suggesting that AATYK expression may be a necessary pre-requisite for the induction of growth arrest and/or apoptosis of myeloid precursor cells."

In addition, the current ethical guidelines fail to address the concern that poor countries may not find it economically or technically possible to implement some recommendations."
https://openalex.org/W2035740558,"Differentiation-inducing factor (DIF)-1 is a chlorinated alkyl phenone released by developingDictyostelium amoebae, which induces them to differentiate into stalk cells. A biosynthetic pathway for DIF-1 is proposed from labeling, inhibitor, and enzymological experiments. Cells incorporate36Cl− into DIF-1 during development, showing that the chlorine atoms originate from chloride ions; peak incorporation is at the first finger stage. DIF-1 synthesis can be blocked by cerulenin, a polyketide synthase inhibitor, suggesting that it is made from a polyketide. This is most likely the C12polyketide (2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl)-1-hexan-1-one (THPH). Feeding experiments confirm that living cells can convert THPH to DIF-1. Conversion requires both chlorination and methylation of THPH, and enzymatic activities able to do this exist in cell lysates. The chlorinating activity, assayed using 36Cl−, is stimulated by H2O2 and requires both soluble and particulate components. It is specific for THPH and does not use this compound after O-methylation. The methyltransferase is soluble, usesS-adenosyl-l-methionine as a co-substrate, has a Km for dichloro-THPH of about 1.1 μm, and strongly prefers this substrate to close analogues. Both chlorinating and methyltransferase activities increase in development in parallel with DIF-1 production, and both are greatly reduced in a mutant strain that makes little DIF-1.

In suitable conditions, isolated cells are induced by DIF-1 to differentiate into stalk cells, whereas without it they become spores (1Town C.D. Gross J.D. Kay R.R.

Development. 1988; 103: 519-524PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, when Dictyostelium aggregates develop on a substratum containing DIF-1, the proportion of stalk precursor cells (prestalk cells) increases, and the proportion of prespores decreases (7Kay R.R. Berks M. Traynor D. Development. 1989; 107: 81-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wang M. Schaap P. Development. 1989; 105: 569-574Google Scholar). DIF-1 levels rise strongly in development as prestalk cells first differentiate (9Brookman J.J. Town C.D. Jermyn K.A. Kay R.R. Dev. Biol. 1982; 91: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 10Sobolewski A. Neave N. Weeks G. Differentiation. 1983; 25: 93-100Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and our current view is that these rising DIF-1 levels induce the most sensitive cells in the aggregate to differentiate into prestalk cells. These cells rapidly produce DIF-1 dechlorinase, which inactivates DIF-1 and prevents a further rise in levels, allowing the majority of cells to differentiate as prespores (11Insall R. Nayler O. Kay R.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2849-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12Schaap P. Tang Y.H. Othmer H.G. Differentiation. 1996; 60: 1-16Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To understand this process further requires a better knowledge of DIF-1 signaling and, to this end, I have attempted to discover the biosynthetic pathway for DIF-1. DIF-1 is an unusual signal molecule, a chlorinated alkyl phenone (13Morris H.R. Taylor G.W. Masento M.S. Jermyn K.A. Kay R.R. Nature. 1987; 328: 811-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), for which neither the biosynthetic pathway nor any of the biosynthetic enzymes are known. The methods used for elucidating the biosynthetic pathways of many natural products are difficult to apply to DIF-1. Genetic analysis has identified a number of mutants potentially defective in DIF-1 biosynthesis (4Kopachik W. Oohata W. Dhokia B. Brookman J.J. Kay R.R. Cell. 1983; 33: 397-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), but efforts to clone the mutated genes by complementation (14Dynes J.L. Firtel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7966-7970Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) have so far failed 2J. Williams, personal communication. ; nor have such mutants been isolated yet by insertional mutagenesis, 3R. R. Kay, unpublished observations. which would facilitate subsequent cloning of the mutated genes (15Kuspa A. Loomis W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8803-8807Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). DIF-1 is active at 10−9m and so is only present at concentrations orders of magnitude lower than many secondary metabolites; it took a massive effort to isolate 50 μg for identification of the structure (13Morris H.R. Taylor G.W. Masento M.S. Jermyn K.A. Kay R.R. Nature. 1987; 328: 811-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 16Kay R.R. Dhokia B. Jermyn K.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 136: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Standard methods for determining the biosynthetic origin of the carbon backbone and oxygen substituents by stable isotopic labeling are therefore difficult. However, it has been possible to deduce a likely biosynthetic pathway for DIF-1 from labeling experiments with36Cl−, from inhibitor studies, and by searching biochemically for some of the predicted biosynthetic enzymes. The initial experiments were guided by clues provided by the structure of DIF-1 itself and by various biosynthetic precedents. Since DIF-1 does not resemble any known intermediary metabolite, it is probably made by a dedicated biosynthetic pathway. The aromatic ring of DIF-1 could arise either from the shikimate pathway of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis (17Weiss U. Edwards J.M. The Biosynthesis of Aromatic Compounds. Wiley-Interscience, New York1980Google Scholar) or from a polyketide. Of these alternatives, a polyketide origin for DIF-1 is the more likely, since it automatically explains the four alternating oxysubstitutions of the final molecule (18Birch A.J. Science. 1967; 156: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and because this is the way that many simple aromatic metabolites are made, including acetylphloroglucinol (19O'Hagan D. The Polyketide Metabolites. Ellis Horwood, Chichester, UK1991Google Scholar), a homologue of the proposed polyketide precursor of DIF-1. Polyketides are typically formed by condensing together acetate units, from malonyl CoA, onto a starter such as acetate in a reaction closely related to fatty acid biosynthesis (19O'Hagan D. The Polyketide Metabolites. Ellis Horwood, Chichester, UK1991Google Scholar, 20Hopwood D.A. Sherman D.H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 37-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The initial carbonyl groups of the polyketide are either left intact or variously reduced to hydroxyl, alkenyl (after elimination of water), or fully to alkyl, depending on the programming of the particular polyketide synthase. The polyketide can be ring closed, aromatized, and substituted in various ways, allowing a great diversity of products to be made. Polyketide synthases usually combine the activities required for polyketide synthesis into a large complex, often with a single polypeptide combining several activities. The condensing enzymes of polyketide and fatty acid synthases share conserved sequence motifs around the active site (21Siggaard-Andersen M. Protein Sequence Data Anal. 1993; 5: 325-335Google Scholar), and the active site cysteine is normally the target for the covalent inhibitor, cerulenin (22Omura S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 72: 520-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 23Roberts G. Leadlay P.F. FEBS Lett. 1983; 159: 13-16Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 24Kauppinen S. Siggaard-Andersen M. von Wettstein-Knowles P. Carlseberg Res. Commun. 1988; 53: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Inhibition by cerulenin therefore provides a diagnostic test for the proposed polyketide origin of DIF-1 (25Martin J.F. McDaniel L.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 411: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 26Ohno H. Ohno T. Awaya J. Omura S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1975; 78: 1149-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The most likely polyketide precursor of DIF-1 is a hexaketide, which, after complete reduction of two carbonyls and ring closure, would yield (2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl)-1-hexan-1-one (THPH; see Fig. 8 for structures). THPH has the complete 12-carbon backbone of DIF-1 and only requires chlorination and O-methylation to form DIF-1. Chlorinations can be carried out by chloroperoxidase enzymes, which utilize hydrogen peroxide to oxidize chloride ions and chlorinate a variety of phenolic compounds (27Morris D.R. Hager L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 1763-1768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Neidleman S.L. Geigert J. Biohalogenation: Principles, Basic Roles and Applications. Ellis Horwood, Chichester, UK1986Google Scholar). Methylations are normally carried out by methyltransferases, usingS-adenosylmethionine as the methyl donor, and a number of O-methyltransferases have been identified in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (29Khouri H.E. Tahara S. Ibrahim R.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 262: 592-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 30Kreuzman A.J. Turner J.R. Yeh W. J. Biol.

Since THPH and a variety of other potential substrates have been synthesized (32Masento M.S. Morris H.R. Taylor G.W. Johnson S.J. Skapski A.C. Kay R.R. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 33Morandini P. Offer J. Traynor D. Nayler O. Neuhaus D. Taylor G.W. Kay R.R. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), it was possible to devise biochemical assays for the predicted chlorinating and methylating enzymes, which were duly detected. All reagents, unless otherwise stated, were from Sigma or Aldrich. S-Adenosyl-[methyl-3H]methionine and Na36Cl were from Amersham Corp. DIF-1, DIF-3, THPH, (3-chloro-2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl)-1-hexan-1-one (monochloro-THPH), and (2,6-dihydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-1-hexan-1-one (methoxy-THPH) were synthesized essentially as described previously and purified by Flash chromatography on silica, eluting with 7.5% ethyl acetate in hexane, followed by reverse phase HPLC (32Masento M.S. Morris H.R. Taylor G.W. Johnson S.J. Skapski A.C. Kay R.R. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 33Morandini P. Offer J. Traynor D. Nayler O. Neuhaus D. Taylor G.W. Kay R.R. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Protein was assayed using the Bio-Rad dye-binding assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard. RNA was extracted, and Northern blots were performed as previously (34Berks M. Kay R.R. Development. 1990; 110: 977-984PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown and developed at 22 °C. Strain Ax2 was grown in axenic medium with shaking (35Watts D.J. Ashworth J.M. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar), and strain V12M2 was grown on nutrient plates in association withKlebsiella aerogenes (36Kay R.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 433-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and washed free of bacteria in KK2 (20 mm K1K2PO4, 2 mm MgSO4, pH 6.2) before use. To label with 36Cl− during normal development, 5 × 108 V12M2 cells were spread per 14-cm diameter plate, each containing 30 ml of 1.8% electrophoresis grade agarose in 10% DIFlab (100% is 12 mm KH2PO4, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 0.1 mmMgSO4, pH 6.7; these conditions were chosen to minimize Cl− contamination) plus 0.1 μCi/ml36Cl− (16.75 μCi/mg). Varying the concentration of 36Cl− showed that 0.1 μCi/ml (approximately 0.17 mm) gave maximal incorporation into DIF-1. At the indicated times, samples were taken for extraction of RNA and labeled compounds (37Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). V12M2 cells were also developed in submerged monolayers (10 ml of medium/9-cm diameter tissue culture plate) at a density of 4 × 106/ml in 50% DIFlab, 0.1 mmMgSO4, containing 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 5 mm cAMP, 0.1 μCi/ml 36Cl− with additions as indicated. After 16 h, the medium was taken off, and nonpolar compounds were extracted using a C18 SepPak cartridge (Waters). The rate of 36Cl− uptake by cells was determined by incubating disaggregated slug-stage cells (disaggregated by passing twice through a 20-gauge and once through a 23-gauge syringe needle) at 4 × 107 cells/ml in 10% DIFlab, 0.1 mm MgSO4 containing 0.1 μCi/ml36Cl− and 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]inulin (Amersham). After different times of incubation, the cells from triplicate samples were pelleted, and the pellets were dissolved in 20 μl of formic acid before dual channel scintillation counting. Uptake was calculated after correcting for extracellular volume, using inulin as the marker. Fig. 1 shows that uptake is half-maximal after about 5 min. Lysates were made by freeze/thawing or filter lysis (38Insall R. Kay R.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3323-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) of Ax2 cells (unless otherwise stated) developed to the appropriate stage on 1.8% L28 agar (Oxoid) containing KK2. For the chlorination assay, lysates were in 50 mmK1K2PO4, pH 7.5, 2 mmMgSO4, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol plus 1 × protease inhibitors (1000 × is 5 mg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 mg/ml pepstatin, 150 mg/ml benzaminide); for the methyltransferase assay, lysates were in 50 mmK1K2PO4, pH 7.5, 2 mmEDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol plus 1 × protease inhibitors. Lysates were fractionated into pellet and supernatant by centrifugation in a Beckman TL-100 centrifuge (30,000 × g for 30 min for chlorination; 300,000 × g for 30 min for methyltransferase assays). DIF-1 dechlorinase was assayed as previously (39Nayler O. Insall R. Kay R.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). 100 μl of sample in lysis buffer containing 0.1 μCi of 36Cl− (equivalent to 2 mm Cl−), 0.1 mm THPH, and 50 mm H2O2, unless otherwise stated, was incubated at 25 °C, and the incubation was terminated at the appropriate times by the addition of 100 μl of stop solution (90/10/2 ethyl acetate/hexane/acetic acid, containing 5 mg/ml butylated hydroxytoluene and 1 mg/ml 50% tocopherol as antioxidants). After centrifugation, the upper phase was taken off, and the lower phase was reextracted with 150 μl of ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases were dried down in a Savant Speed-Vac and quantitatively loaded onto TLC plates. A 50-μl sample in lysis buffer was incubated with 50 μmdichloro-THPH and 1 μm AdoMet (including 0.5 μCi of [3H]AdoMet) at 25 °C, and the reaction was terminated by adding 50 μl of stop solution. After centrifugation in a microcentrifuge, 35 μl of the organic phase was loaded directly onto each lane of the TLC plate. Kinetic data was analyzed using the Enzyme Kinetics software of D.G. Gilbert. The 35–60% ammonium sulfate cut of a high speed supernatant from a lysate of 1.2 × 1010 slug stage cells was dialyzed into 20 mm MOPS, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5 (MEG buffer) and loaded onto a POROS 20HQ strong anion exchange column (10 × 0.46 cm). Proteins were eluted with a gradient of 0–1 m KCl in MEG buffer over 5 min at 5 ml/min, and methyltransferase activity was located. The two steps gave a purification of 11.5-fold over the high speed supernatant. TLC was on activated Whatman LK6D silica plates developed with 60/40/2 ethyl acetate/hexane/acetic acid for the enzyme assays (RF values were as follows: THPH, 0.51; monochloro-THPH, 0.50; dichloro-THPH, 0.65; DIF-3, 0.58; DIF-1, 0.72) or 90/21/3/3 chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water for whole cell extracts. Tritiated compounds were detected by autoradiography after spraying the plates with 3H-Enhance (NEN Life Science Products) and36Cl−-labeled compounds directly, either on film (Kodak XAR5) or on phosphor imaging plates (Eastman Kodak Co.) exposed in a lead box to reduce background. Tritiated compounds were quantitated by scintillation counting after scraping the labeled bands from the TLC plate and 36Cl by reference to standard spots on the TLC plates, using Molecular Dynamics scanners for film and image plates as appropriate. The standard curve was linear from 0.5–16 cpm on film and over a much wider range on phosphor imaging plates. HPLC was performed as previously on ODS columns using methanol/water/acetic acid or acetonitrile/water/acetic acid gradients (40Traynor D. Kay R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5291-5297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Kay R.R. Taylor G.W. Jermyn K.A. Traynor D. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In vivo labeling with potential precursors was used to define the period of peak DIF-1 accumulation during development and to search for possible biosynthetic intermediates. Labeling with radioactive acetate or methionine (as a methyl donor) yielded strong incorporation into a number of lipids (42van Waarde A. van Hoof P.J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 836: 27-38Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar) but not detectably into DIF-1. Alternatively, the DIF-1 released into the medium by developing cells can be labeled with36Cl− (41Kay R.R. Taylor G.W. Jermyn K.A. Traynor D. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Since none of the accompanying labeled compounds are potential precursors (40Traynor D. Kay R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5291-5297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cell-associated compounds were examined. Developing cells were labeled with36Cl− and extracted with organic solvents, and the extracts were separated by TLC. The very low specific activity of36Cl− necessitated autoradiographic exposures of a few months on film or a few days on phosphor imaging plates. Fig. 2 shows that only two labeled compounds are detected in cell extracts. One is DIF-1, as shown by co-chromatography on two different TLC systems (not shown) and by the previous demonstration of DIF-1 in slug extracts by HPLC (43Brookman J.J. Jermyn K.A. Kay R.R. Development. 1987; 100: 119-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the other compound (X) is unidentified. This compound runs in approximately the same place on TLC as dichloro-THPH, a proposed precursor of DIF-1 (Fig. 8), but further characterization was not attempted due to the low amounts present. The time course shows that DIF-1 rises from very low, or undetectable, levels in the first 2 h of development to very low, but definite, levels in aggregation (e.g. 2.5 nm at 6 h) before increasing strongly as tips form to a peak in the fully elongated first finger. This is broadly in line with earlier work, using the bioassay to detect DIF (9Brookman J.J. Town C.D. Jermyn K.A. Kay R.R. Dev. Biol. 1982; 91: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 10Sobolewski A. Neave N. Weeks G. Differentiation. 1983; 25: 93-100Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The detection of DIF-1 during aggregation was surprising, because it has no clear role at this stage of development, but it was confirmed by HPLC fractionation of labeled compounds released after 5 h of development (41Kay R.R. Taylor G.W. Jermyn K.A. Traynor D. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) (not shown). The expression of the DIF-1-induced mRNAs for ecmA and ecmB and the prespore marker mRNA, for pspA, is shown for comparison in Fig. 2. pspA mRNA levels rise coordinately with the major rise in DIF-1 levels; ecmA and ecmB mRNA levels rise with a delay of 1–2 h. Since labeling of the intracellular pool with36Cl− is at equilibrium and saturating (equilibrium is reached in about 30 min, and doubling or halving the amount of label makes no difference to incorporation; see Fig. 1 and “Materials and Methods”), the specific activity of total Cl− is taken as that of the input label. With this assumption, and taking 1 ml of packed slug cells as 66.4 mg of protein, the concentration of DIF-1 in the slug is 62 ± 30 nm(n = 4). These experiments indicate that chlorine is incorporated into DIF-1 from chloride ions, that the biosynthetic enzymes should be maximally active at the first finger and slug stages of development, and that dichloro-THPH could be a precursor of DIF-1. The low concentration of DIF-1 in cells helps to explain the difficulty in labeling it with other potential precursors. To test whether the polyketide synthase inhibitor, cerulenin, inhibits DIF-1 biosynthesis, cells were incubated in submerged culture with cAMP to stimulate their development and with 36Cl− to label the DIF-1 produced. After 16 h, DIF-1 was extracted from the medium and resolved by TLC. Fig. 3 A shows that cerulenin efficiently inhibits DIF-1 synthesis at concentrations similar to those inhibiting condensing enzymes in other organisms (25Martin J.F. McDaniel L.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 411: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 26Ohno H. Ohno T. Awaya J. Omura S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1975; 78: 1149-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 44Inokoshi J. Tomoda H. Hashimoto H. Watanabe A. Takeshima H. Omura S. Mol. Gen.

A. 1994; 91: 11027-11031Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cerulenin also inhibits the condensing enzyme of fatty acid synthase and is known to inhibit fatty acid synthesis inDictyostelium (46Chance K. Hemmingsen S. Weeks G. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 128: 21-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although fatty acid synthesis would not be expected to be important during development, since the cells are starving, the cerulenin experiment still requires controls for specificity. Fig. 3 B shows that when cells are allowed to develop in the absence of cerulenin, they eventually form stalk cells, having accumulated enough DIF-1 to induce their own differentiation. Stalk cell differentiation is inhibited by cerulenin, as expected from its inhibition of DIF-1 synthesis, but the cells remain amoeboid and move around actively. However, when DIF-1 is added to these inhibited cells, they efficiently turn into stalk cells, showing that cerulenin does not have a generally deleterious effect on the cells or compromise any specific function necessary to respond to DIF-1. As further controls, adding fatty acids to the medium restored neither stalk cell differentiation nor DIF-1 production to cerulenin-treated cells (palmitic and stearic acids were tested, as well as hexanoic acid, the possible origin of the alkyl side chain of DIF-1; not shown). The likeliest polyketide precursor for DIF-1 is the C12 polyketide THPH, which is DIF-1 less the chlorines and methoxy group (see Fig. 8). It was synthesized, along with some related compounds, and fed to cells inhibited with cerulenin, to test whether it could be converted to DIF-1. Fig. 4 shows that it can be. DIF-1 synthesis is inhibited by cerulenin, as before, but it is fully restored when either THPH or monochloro-THPH is supplied to the cells. THPH is converted to compounds co-eluting with monochloro-THPH and dichloro-THPH, which are therefore likely intermediates in the biosynthetic pathway, and finally to DIF-1 itself. Monochloro-THPH is converted to dichloro-THPH and DIF-1 (the trace of label in the position of monochloro-THPH is most likely due to a trace contamination of THPH in the original substrate). The compounds running below monochloro-THPH are most likely metabolites of DIF-1, which would be made in these conditions (40Traynor D. Kay R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5291-5297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DIF-3, DIF-1 itself, 4-methoxy-THPH, and various fatty acids are all ineffective at restoring DIF-1 synthesis. The lack of chlorination of 4-methoxy-THPH and of the monochlorinated form of this compound (i.e. DIF-3) is significant; it indicates that once THPH is methylated, it cannot then be chlorinated and therefore that chlorination precedes methylation in the biosynthetic pathway. This supposition is supported by the substrate specificities of the chlorinating and methylating enzymes, described below. At 0.2 μm THPH, DIF-1 is the major product, but at higher THPH concentrations, the chlorinated but unmethylated products accumulate, suggesting that in these conditions activity of the methyltransferase becomes rate-limiting (not shown). These experiments therefore provided strong evidence for the polyketide origin of DIF-1 and encouraged a search for the predicted methylating and chlorinating enzymes. Cell lysates were made from slugs, when DIF-1 synthesis is near maximal, and tested for the presence of a methylating enzyme by incubating them withS-adenosyl-[methyl-3H]methionine as methyl donor and a number of potential DIF-1 precursors. After incubation at 25 °C, nonpolar products were extracted from the reaction mixes with ethyl acetate/hexane and analyzed by TLC. Fig. 5 shows that, although lysates make a background of methylated compounds from endogenous substrates, there is a massive incorporation of label into a new product when dichloro-THPH is supplied. TLC and HPLC co-elution with authentic DIF-1 shows that this product is DIF-1 (not shown). Monochloro-THPH can also be methylated to make DIF-3 (which coincides with a background band in Fig. 5), and 2-methoxy DIF-1 is also utilized, albeit poorly (not visible in Fig. 5 but apparent with purified enzyme preparations). The methylating activity resides in the high speed supernatant of cell lysates (S300) and is therefore presumably cytosolic. It has a broad pH optimum from pH 6.5 to 7.5 and is indifferent to the presence in the assay of EDTA, MgSO4, or CaCl2 up to 5 mm (not shown). The methyltransferase was partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and anion exchange chromatography to eliminate background incorporation, and its kinetic properties were investigated (see “Materials and Methods”). Double reciprocal plots were linear. The preferred substrate is dichloro-THPH (Km 1.1 μm), although monochloro-THPH and the 2-methoxy isomer of DIF-1 show some activity (Table I, Fig. 5). However, there is no detectable incorporation with the bare polyketide, THPH, nor with DIF-1 or DIF-3, both of which have two hydroxyls available. the Km for AdoMet is about 4 × 10−7m, which is in the physiological range (47Guitton M.C. Keller B.T. Part D. De Gunzburg R.T. Borchardt R.T. Veron M. Cell Differ. 1988; 22: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and activity can be inhibited by the reaction product, S-adenosyl homocysteine (Ki about 2 × 10−6m with 10−6m AdoMet and 10−4m dichloro-THPH; not shown).Table ISubstrate specificity of dichloro-THPH methyltransferaseSubstrateMethyltransferase activityKmRelative Vmax(μm)THPHNDNDChloro-THPH14.61.25Dichloro-THPH1.11DIF-3NDNDDIF-1NDND2-methoxydichloro-THPH17.70.191-a ND, no activity detected.

https://openalex.org/W2162823330,"This is the first report on peptidic inhibitors of heme oxygenase. Such peptides were originally developed from the immunomodulatory peptide 2702.75–84 which corresponds to amino acid residues 75 to 84 of the α1-helix of HLA-B2702 (2702.75–84) and has been shown to be immunosuppressive in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, 2702.75–84 inhibited cytotoxic T- and natural killer cell- mediated target cell lysis, and in vivo peptide therapy resulted in prolongation of heart and skin allograft survival in mice. The peptide was also shown to bind to heat shock protein 70. However, d-enantiomers of 2702.75–84 and derivatives thereof, while still being immunosuppressive, did not bind to heat shock protein 70. This study was designed to identify proteins binding to peptide D2702.75–84(E → V) (rvnlrialry) consisting of d-amino acids. Compared with 2702.75–84 (RENLRIALRY), glutamic acid residue 76 (E) was replaced with valine (V). Affinity chromatography using immobilized D2702.75–84(E → V) and mouse and human cell extracts, resulted in the isolation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Peptide D2702.75–84 inhibited HO activity in vitro in a dose dependent manner. Similar to what has been observed with other inhibitors of HO, administration of peptide into mice resulted in an up-regulation of HO-1 mRNA and protein, as well as enzyme activity in liver, spleen and kidney. Other peptides derived from 2702.75–84 with similar immunomodulatory activity displayed similar effects. In contrast, inactive derivatives of 2702.75–84 had no effect on HO activity. Therefore, the immunosuppressive effects of the described immunomodulatory peptides are similar to those of cobalt-protoporphyrin, a known up-regulator of HO-1. Our results suggest that HO-1 modulation may be a novel mechanism of immunomodulation. This is the first report on peptidic inhibitors of heme oxygenase.

Our results suggest that HO-1 modulation may be a novel mechanism of immunomodulation. Peptides derived from various regions of the HLA class I heavy chain have been shown to exert immunomodulatory effects by influencing T cell responses (1Clayberger C. Parham P. Rothbard J.

Peptides corresponding to this region of the HLA-B7 (07.75–84) or HLA-B2702 (2702.75–84) molecule blocked the differentiation of human CTL precursors in vitro in a non-allele-restricted manner (5Clayberger C.

Woo et al.(7Woo J. Gao L. Cornejo M.-C. Buelow R. Transplantation. 1995; 60: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) subsequently demonstrated a more powerful effect when the peptides were used in a dimeric form (2702.84–75-75–84). These peptides have also been studied in vivo in transplantation models. In rats, 07.75–84 induced permanent acceptance of LEW heart allografts in ACI recipients when combined with subtherapeutic doses of cyclosporine A (6Nisco S. Vriens P. Hoyt G. Lyu S.C. Farfan F. Pouletty P. Krensky A.M. Clayberger C. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3786-3792PubMed Google Scholar). In congeneic LEW.1W donors and LEW.1A recipients, 07.75–84 induced long term graft survival without additional cyclosporine A treatment (8Cuturi M.C. Josien R. Douillard P. Pannetier C.

In a mouse heart transplant model, where C57Bl/6 mice were used as donors and CBA mice as recipients, treatment with both 2702.75–84 and 2702.84–75-75–84 prolonged graft survival significantly, with B2702.84–75-75–84 showing a more powerful effect (7Woo J.

Administration of 2702.75–84 has been shown to prolong the survival of skin allografts significantly when the tail skin of C57Bl/6 mice was grafted on CBA mice (9Buelow R. Veyron P. Clayberger C. Pouletty P. Touraine J.L. Transplantation. 1995; 59: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Despite the peptide's effectiveness, its mechanism of action is not fully understood. For reasons discussed elsewhere (7Woo J. Gao L. Cornejo M.-C. Buelow R. Transplantation. 1995; 60: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 9Buelow R. Veyron P. Clayberger C. Pouletty P.

Heart Lung Transplant. 1996; 15: 78-87PubMed Google Scholar) a direct interaction with T cell receptors or NK cell inhibitory receptors can be excluded. The recent observation that both l- andd-enantiomers of peptide 2702.75–84 prolong heart allograft survival in vivo indicated that the peptides' immunomodulatory activity is probably not based on indirect presentation by major histocompatibility class molecules (10Gao L. Woo J. Buelow R. J. Heart Lung Transplant. 1996; 15: 78-87PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the recent hypothesis that peptide 2702.75–84 modulates immune responses by binding to HSP/HSC70 can be excluded because thed-isomer of 2702.75–84 did not bind such proteins (11Noessner E. Goldberg J.E. Naftzger C. Lyu S.C. Clayberger C. Krensky A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,12Woo J. Iyer S. Cornejo M.-C. Gao L. Cuturi C. Soulillou J.P. Buelow R. Transplantation. 1997; 64: 1460-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we looked for additional proteins that may interact with these immunomodulatory peptides. For these studies, we used a 2702.75–84-derived peptide (D2702.75–84(E → V)) with two modifications: (i) synthesis with d-amino acids and (ii) substitution of glutamic acid residue at position 76 in 2702.75–84 with valine. Compared with peptide 2702.75–84, this peptide displayed enhanced immunomodulatory activity in vitro and in vivo (12Woo J. Iyer S. Cornejo M.-C. Gao L. Cuturi C. Soulillou J.P. Buelow R. Transplantation. 1997; 64: 1460-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Affinity purification using this peptide resulted in the isolation of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1, HSP32). Effects of peptide binding to this enzyme were analyzed in vitro and in vivo. Male, 7–8-week-old CBA/J (H-2k) and C57BL/6/J (H-2b) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were housed according to the Animal Welfare Guidelines, Department of Health, California. Peptides were synthesized using Fmoc chemistry, purified by HPLC and shown to be >90% homogenous by analytical reverse phase HPLC (SynPep, Dublin, CA). Peptides CSGSGrvnlrialry and CSGSGrvnlrtalry (5 mg) were dissolved in Me2SO (60%) and coupled to 2 ml of SulfoLink coupling gel according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Pierce). An additional column was coupled with cysteine-HCl alone. Affinity chromatography using all three gels was performed simultaneously. Human T cell leukemia cell line Jurkat (clone E6-1) and a mouse lymphoma cell line Yac-1 were obtained from ATCC and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For purification of 2702.75–84(E → V)-binding proteins, 1 × 109 cells were washed in cold PBS and lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 300 mm NaCl, 1% CHAPS, and 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin, chymostatin, antipain and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were lysed at 4 °C for 30 min. Insoluble material was discarded after centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 10 min, and protein content was estimated by the BCA assay (Pierce). SulfoLink gel was washed several times with 10 mmphosphate buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, and protease inhibitors (wash buffer) and incubated with cell lysate for 60 min at 4 °C with continuous rocking. The gel was packed in a column and unbound cell lysate was recovered. The column was washed with 20 column volumes of wash buffer, followed by wash buffer containing 500 mm NaCl. The latter fraction was termed high salt eluate. Bound proteins were eluted with 100 mm glycine-HCl, pH 3.0, containing 0.1% CHAPS and protease inhibitors in 1-ml fractions that were immediately neutralized to pH 7.0 using 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.2. Protein concentration was estimated by the BCA assay (Pierce), and fractions containing protein were pooled, concentrated in a microconcentrator, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting. All fractions were stored at −80 °C. Approximately 1 μg of pH 3.0 eluate, 5 μg of the high salt eluate, and 20 μg of cell lysate were boiled in SDS sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol and separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were visualized by silver staining (13Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray V.P. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2502) Google Scholar). Western transfer was carried out using the blot module from Novex (San Diego, CA) on nitrocellulose (Hybond-N, Amersham Corp.) in transfer buffer (12 mm Tris, 96 mm glycine, pH 8.3) at 30 V for 45 min. Efficiency of transfer was monitored by including prestained molecular weight markers (Amersham Corp.) on the gel. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by immersing the membrane in PBS (pH 7.5) containing 1% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. After a short wash in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST), the membrane was incubated in primary antibody at the specified dilution in PBST for 1 h at room temperature with continuous rocking. The primary antibodies tested were rat anti-human HSC/HSP70 (Stressgen, Victoria, BC, Canada) at a 1:10,000 dilution, rabbit anti-rat HSP32 (also called HO-1), rabbit anti-rat heme oxygenase-2 (HO-2), rabbit anti-mouse HSP27 (all from Stressgen), all diluted at 1:5000. Following extensive washing in PBST, the membrane was incubated in the appropriate secondary antibody solution at the specified dilution for 1 h at room temperature with continuous rocking. The secondary antibodies used were rabbit anti-rat at 1:10,000 or donkey anti-rabbit at 1:5000, respectively (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). All secondary antibodies were conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. After extensive washing, bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence western blotting reagents (Pierce). Exposure to film (Hyperfilm ECL, Amersham Corp.) was performed for 10–30 s. Amino acid sequencing of the ∼30-kDa band was performed by Edman chemistry using an automated ABI 470 A system sequencer with an on-line ABI 128 HPLC and analyzed on ABI 610 system software at the Protein structure laboratory, University of California, Davis, CA. The sequence was compared with known sequences in the University of Wisconsin GCG data base. A first strand HO-1 cDNA was generated with 1 μg of testis poly(A) RNA using the cDNA cycle kit (Invitrogen), priming with oligo(dT), and used as a template for polymerase chain reaction using the primers 5′-GGGAAGCTTGGAGCGCCCACAGCTCG-3′ (representing nucleotides 2 to 18 of HO-1 (17Rotenberg M.O. Maines M.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 290: 336-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and a HindIII restriction site (italics) and 5′-AAGCTTATGATGATGATGATGATGCTTATCGTCATCGTCCATGGCATAAATTCCCACTG-3′ which contains the reverse complements of nucleotides 848–867, an enterokinase cleavage site (underlined), histidine tag (bold), stop codon (double underline), and HindIII site (italics). The fragment was cloned into the HindIII site of the pBS+ vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and the resultant plasmid was transformed into Inv F′ Escherichia coli cells. Orientation of the insert was determined by restriction analysis and confirmed by sequencing. Fusion proteins were purified from overnight cultures utilizing ProBondTM (Invitrogen) columns in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Pooled peak fractions from the ProBondTM column elution were buffer-exchanged into 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10% glycerol, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% Tween-20 and concentrated to approximately 1 mg/ml for storage at −80 °C. Preparations were judged to be >90% homogenous as assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by staining with Coomasie Brilliant Blue. To determine HO activity in tissues, mouse spleen samples were homogenized on ice in a Tris-HCl lysis buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors. Samples were frozen in small aliquots until use. Spleen microsomes were prepared and used as the source of HO for activity measurements, assessed by bilirubin formation. Spleen homogenate (100 μl) was mixed with 0.8 mm NADPH, 0.8 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 1.0 unit of Glu-6-P dehydrogenase, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 μl of purified rat liver biliverdin reductase at 4 °C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of hemin (final concentration 0.25 mm). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C in the dark for 60 min. At the end of the incubation period, any insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and supernatants were analyzed for bilirubin concentration by a modified procedure of Hillman and Beyer (Sigma Diagnostics, kit no. 552). Controls included spleen samples in the absence of the NADPH-generating system and all components of the reaction mixture in the absence of spleen homogenates. Biliverdin reductase was purified from rat liver by the method described by Kutty and Maines (14Kutty R.K. Maines M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3956-3962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine HO activity in purified preparations of HO-1, the procedure described previously was used and the activity was determined in the presence of purified preparations of biliverdin reductase and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (15Maines M.D. Trakshel G.M. Kutty R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 411-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biliverdin reductase activity was determined by measuring the rate of bilirubin formation (14Kutty R.K. Maines M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3956-3962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To a reaction mixture consisting of 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.7), 0.1 mm NADPH, 5 μl (approximately 200 ng of purified enzyme protein), 5.0 μm biliverdin, and peptides at a final concentration of 100 μm were added. The control reaction mixture did not contain peptides. The reaction was carried out in the dark at 37 °C for 30 min, and the bilirubin formed was measured as described above. Lactate dehydrogenase enzyme activity was determined using whole cells (E6-1) as the source as described previously (16Sigal L.J. Berens S. Dwane W.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 177: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase enzyme activity was measured by addition of o-phenylenediamine. Following incubation at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by the addition of HCl, and the optical density was measured at 490 nm. A full-length (1300 base pairs) HO-2 cDNA isolated from a rat testis library (17Rotenberg M.O. Maines M.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 290: 336-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) was used as a HO-2 hybridization probe. The HO-1 hybridization probe was a 569-base pair HO-1 fragment corresponding to nucleotides 86–654 of HO-1 cDNA (18Shibahara S Müller R. Taguchi H. Yoshida T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7865-7869Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Mouse α-actin, HO-1, and HO-2 cDNA probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP according to the manufacture's instructions, using the Rediprime primer DNA labeling system (Amersham Corp.), and further purified by spin column chromatography (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared from tissues by the method of Chirgwin et al. (20Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.K. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). Poly(A+) RNA was isolated by oligonucleotide(dT) cellulose chromatography, fractionated on a 1.2% agarose gel, and transferred to Nytran (Schleicher & Schuell). Prehybridization, hybridization to the appropriate32P-labeled cDNA, and post-hybridization treatment of the blots were preformed as described elsewhere (21Sun Y. Rotenberg M.O. Maines M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8212-8217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The signals on autoradiograms were quantitated using an LKB UltroScan densitometer. Normal CBA mice were treated with a single injection (intraperitoneal) of peptide D2702.75–84(E → V) at 80 mg/kg dissolved in PBS + 10% Me2SO. Control animals were treated with an equal volume of PBS + 10% Me2SO. At 6, 24, and 48 h post-treatment, animals were killed, and liver, spleen, kidney, heart, and blood (serum) were collected and rapidly frozen. Tissue samples were used for northern blotting to detect HO-1 mRNA and western blotting to detect HO-1 protein levels. Microsomes were prepared from spleen samples and used for HO activity measurements and western blotting. Recently, peptide 2702.75–84 (RENLRIALRY) and 2702.75–84(E → V) (RVNLRIALRY) were shown to bind to HSC70 and HSP70 (11Noessner E. Goldberg J.E. Naftzger C. Lyu S.C. Clayberger C. Krensky A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 12Woo J. Iyer S. Cornejo M.-C. Gao L. Cuturi C. Soulillou J.P. Buelow R. Transplantation. 1997; 64: 1460-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In contrast, d-enantiomers of these peptides did not bind to HSC70, although these peptides inhibited cytotoxicity and prolonged murine heart allograft survival to a similar extent as the l-enantiomers. These findings prompted us to explore additional peptide binding proteins that may mediate the peptide's immunosuppressive effects. Whole cell lysates from Jurkat cells (Fig. 1 A), a human T cell lymphoma, and YAC-1 cells (Fig. 1 B), a mouse lymphoma, were incubated with an affinity matrix consisting of peptides coupled to agarose via an N-terminal cysteine residue. Proteins eluted from the affinity gel at low pH were analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis. Using peptide D2702.75–84(E → V) (rvnlrialry) the pH 3.0 eluate contained a major band of approximately 30 kDa (Fig. 1, lane 4). This protein was purified from both human Jurkat and murine YAC-1 cells. Control runs using SulfoLink-agarose gel containing cysteine or peptide rvnlrtalry (negative control) did not result in the purification of the 30-kDa protein (data not shown). Proteins in cell lysates and various fractions eluted from the affinity matrix were analyzed with various antibodies following transfer to nitrocellulose. Incubation of western blots with anti-HSC/HSP70 antibody revealed the presence of these proteins in the whole cell lysate and the high salt wash, but not in the low pH eluate of E6-1 (Fig. 2 A, lane 4) or YAC-1 cell lysate (Fig. 2 B, lane 4). Probing the western blots with anti-HSP25 and anti-HSP27 did not reveal the presence of these proteins in any of the fractions (data not shown). In contrast, analysis of the blots with anti-HSP32 resulted in a positive signal in the protein fraction eluted at pH 3.0. This result was obtained with proteins purified from both E6-1 (Fig. 3 A) and YAC-1 (Fig. 3 B) cell extracts. The positive band on the western blot corresponded to the single band observed in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel. No detectable signal was seen with whole cell lysate or the high salt fractions of either cell extract.Figure 3Identification of HSP32 in protein fractions separated by affinity chromatography using E6-1 (A) and YAC-1 (B) cell homogenates.

Complete homology was observed with human and mouse HSP32 and 97% homology with rat HSP32 (Table I), thus confirming that the eluted protein was HSP32 or HO-1.Table IN-terminal amino acid sequence of HO-1SampleN-terminal amino acid sequence30-kDa bandMERPQPDSM-QDLMouse HSP32MERPQPDSMPQDLHuman HSP32MERPQPDSMPQDLRat HSP32MERPQLDSMSQDL Open table in a new tab Heme oxygenase catalyzes the degradation of heme into biliverdin which is subsequently reduced to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase. When the activity of purified recombinant HO-1 was assessed in the presence of peptide D2702.75–84(E → V), a significant dose dependent reduction of enzyme activity was observed (Fig. 4): half-maximal inhibition of HO-1 activity occurred at about 20 μm. The inhibition of bilirubin formation was not due to the inhibition of biliverdin reductase by the peptide because addition of peptide to purified biliverdin reductase had no effect (data not shown). The specificity of the effect was also evaluated using lactate dehydrogenase and horse radish peroxidase. Addition of D2702.75–84(E → V) to these enzymes had no effect on their activity (data not shown). The specificity of peptide-mediated inhibition of HO was studied using various different peptides. Due to the availability of limited amounts of purified recombinant HO-1, the effect of peptides on mouse and rat HO activity was assessed using spleen cell extracts (Table II). HO-1 is by far the most prevalent form of the HO system in the spleen. All of the tested peptides had been evaluated in vitro and in vivo for immunomodulatory activity (5Clayberger C. Lyu S.C.

As controls, peptides 2705.75–84 and D2702.75–84(E → V, R79P) with no immunomodulatory activity were used. Both of these peptides did not inhibit HO activity at concentrations of up to 1 mm. Peptide D2702.75–84(E → V) inhibited both mouse and rat HO activity. Half-maximal inhibition of HO activity was observed at 20 μm. Peptide 2702.75–84(E → V) with the identical amino acid sequence as peptide D2702.75–84(E → V) but consisting ofl- instead of d-amino acids inhibited splenic mouse and rat HO activity to a similar extent as peptide D2702.75–84(E → V). Similarly, the rationally designed peptide RDP1258 which prolonged heart and kidney allograft survival in both mouse and rats displayed an IC50 of 20 μm with both enzymes. Peptide 2702.75–84 inhibited mouse HO but not rat HO. Half-maximal inhibition of mouse HO was observed at about 1 mm. At this peptide concentration (the highest concentration tested), rat HO activity was not affected at all. Compared with D2702.75–84 and RDP1258, this corresponded to a 50 times lower inhibitory activity with mouse HO. Similarly, this peptide has been shown to be less potent in prolonging mouse heart allograft survival and to be ineffective in prolonging rat allograft survival (12Woo J. Iyer S. Cornejo M.-C. Gao L.

The best studied ones are the strictly respiringPseudomonas denitrificans, the facultative anaerobeSalmonella typhimurium LT2, the aerotolerant anaerobePropionibacterium freundenreichii (shermanii), and the strict anaerobe Eubacterium limosum. There are, however, key differences between the pathways leading to the synthesis of the corrin ring in these organisms. Most notable is the time of cobalt insertion into the macrocycle (6Blanche F.

While cobalt insertion inP. denitrificans occurs late in the pathway (12Debussche L. Couder M. Thibaut D. Cameron B. Crouzet J. Blanche F. J.

The majority of the reactions of the corrin ring biosynthetic pathway in P. denitrificans has been firmly established (2Blanche F. Cameron B. Crouzet J. Debussche L. Thibaut D. Vuilhorgne M. Leeper F.J. Battersby A.R. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1995; 34: 383-411Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar), whereas the identities of most of the intermediates of this pathway inS. typhimurium and P. freundenreichii have not been elucidated. One important unanswered question about the synthesis of the corrin ring regards the metabolic origin of the (R)-1-amino-2-propanol moiety linking the macrocycle to the nucleotide (Fig. 1). Early studies performed on Streptomyces griseus demonstrated that in this bacterium, label from [15N]l-Thr was incorporated into the (R)-AP 1The abbreviations used are: (R)-AP, (R)-1-amino-2-propanol; Cbl, cobalamin; AdoCbi-P, 5′-deoxyadenosylcobinamide phosphate; AdoCbi, 5′-deoxyadenosylcobinamide; (CN)2Cby, dicyanocobyric acid; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; PLP, pyridoxal phosphate; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; oPA, o-phthaldialdehyde; Thr-P, threonineO-3-phosphate. moiety of Cbl. However, evidence for direct decarboxylation of l-Thr was not obtained (14Krasna A.I. Rosenblum C. Sprinson D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 225: 745-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later, a series of studies by Ford and Friedmann (15Ford S.H. Friedmann H.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 175: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 16Ford S.H. Friedmann H.C. Biochem.

Acta. 1977; 500: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) investigated the nonenzymatic decarboxylation ofl-Thr. These authors showed that l-Thr decarboxylation occurred optimally at pH 8 when diaquocobyric acid was present in a reaction mixture containing Tris-Cl buffer and a reductant (e.g. glutathione, β-mercaptoethanol, or borohydride) (15Ford S.H. Friedmann H.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 175: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar,16Ford S.H. Friedmann H.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 72: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This work led to a model for interactions between diaquocobyric acid and l-Thr. Although the nature of the interaction between these two compounds was not established, it was demonstrated that for the interaction to occur, the cobalt ion in the ring had to be in its Co(II) oxidation state (17Ford S.H. Friedmann H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 500: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). While these studies presented a thought-provoking mechanism for the synthesis of (R)-AP and its incorporation into cobinamide, they failed to demonstrate that direct decarboxylation of l-Thr leads to (R)-AP synthesis. An alternative pathway for the synthesis of (R)-AP is via the enzymatic oxidation of l-Thr to α-amino-β-ketobutyrate by l-threonine 3-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.103) (18Neuberger A. Tait G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 41: 164-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 19Boylan S.A. Dekker E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1809-1815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This compound spontaneously decarboxylates to yield aminoacetone, which is reduced to (R)-AP by (R)-1-aminopropan-2-ol:NAD+ oxidoreductase (EC1.1.1.75) (20Kelley J.J. Dekker E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2124-2129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro studies by Ford and Friedmann (15Ford S.H. Friedmann H.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 175: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) on the incorporation of l-Thr into cobinamide ruled out this pathway for the synthesis of (R)-AP in P. freundenreichii. Recent work in S. typhimurium identified the cobDgene as one whose gene product was required for the synthesis of (R)-AP in this bacterium (21Grabau C. Roth J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2138-2144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of cobDmutants argued against the hypothesis that the threonine dehydrogenase pathway was the one responsible for the synthesis of (R)-AP in this bacterium. In this paper, we present the cloning, sequencing, and overexpression of the cobD gene of S. typhimurium and presentin vitro evidence showing that the CobD protein directly decarboxylates l-threonine O-3-phosphate to yield (R)-1-amino-2-propanol O-2-phosphate in the absence of corrinoid; the enzyme showed stereospecificity for thel-isomer. On the basis of this finding, we propose that the end product of the corrin ring biosynthetic pathway in this bacterium, and probably others, is AdoCbi-P, not AdoCbi as previously thought. To our knowledge, this is the first report of anl-threonine-O-3-phosphate decarboxylase enzyme.

Difco Nutrient Broth™ (8 g/liter) with NaCl (5 g/liter) added was used as the rich medium. LB broth was used for experiments involving plasmid manipulation and for protein overexpression. Difco Granulated Agar™ (15 g/liter) was added for solid support. When present in the medium, (CN)2Cby and dicyanocobinamide were at 45 nm, and (R)-AP was at 1.3 mm. Concentrations of antibiotics were as described elsewhere (24O'Toole G.A. Rondon M.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3317-3326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All chemicals were purchased from Sigma, except (CN)2Cby, which was a gift from F. Blanche (Rhône-Poulenc Rorer S. A., Vitry-sur-Seine Cedex, France); l- andd-lactaldehydes were synthesized as described (25Huff E. Rudey H. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 1060-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell density of cultures was monitored with a Klett photoelectric colorimeter (Manostat Corp., New York, NY) or with a Spectronic 20D spectrophotometer (Milton Roy Co., Rochester, NY). Cbl biosynthesis was assessed in vivo by demanding synthesis of methionine via the Cbl-dependent methionine synthase, MetH (5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase, EC 2.1.1.13) (26Taylor R.T. Weissbach H. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 9. Academic Press, New York1973: 121-165Google Scholar, 27Jeter R.M. Olivera B.M. Roth J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 206-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). cobD mutant JE2216 carried a mutation in metE encoding the Cbl-independent methionine synthase, MetE (5-methyltetrahydropteroyltriglutamate-homocysteine methyltransferase, EC 2.1.1.14); hence, growth of the strain depended on the availability of either methionine or Cbl. As described elsewhere (21Grabau C. Roth J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2138-2144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Cbl biosynthesis in cobD mutants was restored when the medium was supplemented with (CN)2Cby and (R)-AP under aerobic growth conditions or by (R)-AP alone under anaerobic growth conditions. The need for (CN)2Cby under anaerobic conditions is bypassed because S. typhimurium synthesizes the corrin ring de novo when its environment is devoid of oxygen (27Jeter R.M. Olivera B.M. Roth J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 206-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Escalante-Semerena J.C. Roth J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2251-2258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All transductional crosses were performed using the high frequency transducing bacteriophage P22 mutant HT 105/1int-201 (29Schmieger H. Mol. Gen.

Transductants were purified and identified as phage-free as described (31Chan R.K. Botstein D. Watanabe T. Ogata Y. Virology. 1972; 50: 883-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Both plasmids pCOBD2 and pCOBD6 and the corresponding vector-only controls pSU38 and pT7-7 were transformed into cobD mutant strain JE2216 and its recombination-deficient derivative JE4097. Transformants were tested for their ability to grow aerobically on minimal medium supplemented with glucose, (CN)2Cby, and ampicillin (pT7-7 derivatives) or kanamycin (pSU38 derivatives). Strains that grew under these conditions were assessed as positive for complementation of the cobD phenotype and therefore carried a plasmid with a functional cobD gene. Plasmid DNA was isolated from cultures using a QIAprep Spin Plasmid™ kit (QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth, CA) and transformed into strains made competent using a standard calcium chloride treatment (32Seidman C.E.

Sci. 1994; 19: 258-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Two oligonucleotide primers were used to amplify the −125 to +1148 region of cobD of pCOBC4 using PCR methodology. Each primer contained a 3′-region complementary to pCOBC4 followed by a 5′-noncomplementary end that generated either anEcoRI (primer 1) or a BamHI (primer 2) restriction endonuclease site. Amplification between the two primers was performed using VentR® polymerase (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) in a Temp-Tronic Thermocycler (Barnstead Thermolyne, Dubuque, IA). Reaction conditions were as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, annealing at 50 °C for 1.5 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. The primers used were as follows: primer 1 (5′-CCCGAATTCCGCCATGACGCACCAGCCACAATCGC-3′), which hybridized to the −125 to −100 region upstream of cobD and generated an EcoRI restriction endonuclease site; and primer 2 (5′-CCCGGATCCTGGAAAAAGGCGAATCCTGCGACGAT-3′), which hybridized to the +1123 to +1148 region downstream of cobD and generated aBamHI restriction endonuclease site. These primers were used to generate a 1291-bp fragment, which was gel-purified, digested withEcoRI and BamHI, and ligated into the intermediate copy number vector pSU38 (35Bartolomé B. Jubete Y. Martı́nez E. de la Cruz F. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 102: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) to generate plasmid pCOBD2. Two oligonucleotide primers were used to amplify the −16 to +1148 region of cobD of plasmid pCOBC4 by PCR. One primer (primer 2) contained a 3′-region complementary to plasmid pCOBC4 followed by a 5′-noncomplementary end that generated a BamHI restriction endonuclease site. The second primer (primer 3) was designed to introduce an NdeI restriction endonuclease site immediately 5′ to the translation initiation site of cobD. Amplification between the two primers was performed using VentR®(exo−) polymerase (New England Biolabs Inc.). Reaction conditions were as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, annealing at 50 °C for 1.5 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. The primers used were as follows: primer 2 and primer 3 (5′-TTTTGGCTGGAGGCATATGGCTTTATTCAACACCG-3′), which hybridized to the −16 to +19 region of cobD and generated an NdeI restriction endonuclease site. These primers generated a 1173-bp fragment, which was purified, digested withNdeI and BamHI, and ligated into the T7 overexpression vector pT7-7 (36Tabor S. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. Wiley-Interscience, New York1990: 16.2.1-16.2.11Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid (pCOBD6) and pT7-7 were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21/λDE3, generating strains JE4094 and JE4096, respectively. These strains contained the T7 RNA polymerase in a λ-lysogen under control of an IPTG-inducible promoter. CobD overexpression was performed as follows. A 0.1% (v/v) inoculum was added to LB broth containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and grown at 30 °C with shaking to ∼70 Klett units. IPTG was added to 400 μm, and incubation was continued for ∼12 h. A 100-μl sample of culture was pelleted, and 100 μl of 2 × sample buffer (37Gallagher S.R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. Wiley-Interscience, New York1996: 10.2.1-10.2.35Google Scholar) was added and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. Cell-free extracts were cleared after spinning at 12,000 × g for 5 min in a Sorvall® SS34 rotor RC5B low speed ultracentrifuge (DuPont). Cell-free extracts used in the in vitro activity assays were obtained from 1-liter cultures grown in LB broth containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Cultures were shaken at 30 °C in 2-liter Erlenmeyer flasks. After induction, cells were pelleted, resuspended in 20 ml of 50 mm PIPES (pH 6.8), and broken by passing twice through a French pressure cell at 8958 kilopascals. Membrane and soluble fractions were separated by centrifugation at 40,000 ×g for 1.5 h. The supernatant was dialyzed at 4 °C against 50 mm PIPES and 10 mm dithiothreitol (pH 6.8) and kept under N2 with 10 mmdithiothreitol and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride added. All reactions were performed in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes (Fisher). Aminotransferase assay mixtures (100-μl final volume) contained 50 nmol of l- ord-lactaldehyde, 50 nmol of one of the 20l-amino acids, 50 nmol of PLP, and 5 μmol of PIPES (pH 6.8). Decarboxylase assay mixtures (100-μl final volume) contained 50 nmol of substrate (l- or d-threonine or dl- orl-threonine O-3-phosphate), 50 nmol of PLP, and 5 μmol of PIPES (pH 6.8). Both aminotransferase and decarboxylase assays were started by the addition of ∼100 μg of protein. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for either 30 or 90 min as indicated. The reactions were terminated, and proteins were precipitated by incubation at 100 °C for 10 min. Precipitated proteins were removed by a 1-min centrifugation using a Marathon™ 13K/M microcentrifuge (Fisher). Samples were filtered with a Spin-X® filter (Corning Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) to remove any debris prior to HPLC analysis. A 5-μl sample was derivatized with oPA in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol to generate highly fluorescent thio-substituted isoindole derivatives of primary amines as described previously (38Jones B.N. Paabo S. Stein S. J. Liq. Chromatogr. 1981; 4: 565-586Crossref Scopus (537) Google Scholar). A 10-μl sample of this mixture (∼1 nmol of substrate) was analyzed via HPLC as described below. Thio-substituted isoindoles were separated utilizing reverse-phase HPLC with a Prodigy™ 5 ODS-2 column (250 × 4.60 mm, 5 μm; Phenomenex Inc., Torrance, CA). oPA derivatives were resolved with a gradient from solvent A (1:19:80 tetrahydrofuran, methanol, and 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.9)) to solvent B (8:2 methanol and 50 mmsodium acetate (pH 5.9)) at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min as follows: 100% solvent A for 5 min, a 5-min linear gradient to 50% solvent A and 50% solvent B, and a 25-min linear gradient to 100% solvent B, followed by a 5-min linear gradient to 100% solvent A. Under these conditions, derivatized standards of l-Thr-P, l-Thr, and (R)-AP eluted with retention times of 23, 28, and 35 min, respectively. Elution was monitored with a Waters 470 scanning fluorescence detector set at 330 nm (excitation), 418 nm (emission), 1.5 s (filter), 16 (attenuation), and ×100 (gain). Alkaline phosphatase treatments of cobD reaction mixtures were performed as follows. A 20-μl sample of the reaction mixture was diluted to 28 μl with alkaline phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.3), 1 mm MgCl2, 100 μmZnCl2, and 1 mm spermidine) containing 2 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated, and proteins were precipitated by incubation at 100 °C for 10 min and removed by centrifugation. The sample was then filtered with a Spin-X® filter to remove debris. Primary amines in the mixture (5-μl sample) were derivatized, and 15 μl of this mixture (∼1 nmol of substrate) was analyzed by HPLC as described above.dl-Thr-P was used as a standard for this procedure, which, after treatment and derivatization, eluted with a retention time of 28 min (same as l-Thr). Proteins present in soluble cell-free extracts were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels using the Laemmli system (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Protein concentration was estimated by the method of Kunitz (40Kunitz M.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1952; 35: 423-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Previously reported work from our laboratory identified 211 bp of the 5′-end of the cobD gene (41O'Toole G.A. Trzebiatowski J.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26503-26511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We determined the remaining sequence of cobD using plasmid pCOBC4 (cobC+ cobD+). Analysis of the sequence revealed an open reading frame of 1095 bp with an OPAL (TGA) stop codon (Fig. 2). The sequence predicted a polypeptide of 364 amino acids with a molecular mass of 40,810 Da. A putative promoter was identified using the MacTargsearch program. The −10 region of the cobD promoter was identified 23 bp 5′ to the putative translation start site. The −10 hexamer (TAAAAT) had a five out of six match with the consensus sequence, whereas the −35 hexamer (TTGCGC) had only a three out of six match. A putative ribosome-binding site sequence (Shine-Dalgarno sequence; GGAGG) was located 4 bp upstream of the initiation codon. This sequence analysis suggested thatcobD and cobC were divergently transcribed and that only 1 bp separated the translation initiation codons of the two genes (Fig. 2). If the putative promoter and Shine-Dalgarno sequences of cobD were correct, they reside within the open reading frame of cobC. The predicted CobD polypeptide contained a consensus PLP-binding motif (SLTKFYAIPGLRLG) and showed striking homology to the histidinol-phosphate transaminases (EC 2.6.1.9) and, to a lesser extent, to the aspartate transaminases (EC 2.6.1.1) and tyrosine transaminases (EC 2.6.1.5) of many organisms. CobD was most similar to HisH, the histidinol-phosphate transaminase from Bacillus subtilis (GenBank™ accession number M15409), sharing 28% identity and 68% similarity at the amino acid level. Additionally, CobD is ∼28% identical and 67% similar to the CobC protein of P. denitrificans (GenBank™ accession number M32223), thought to be involved in (R)-AP synthesis (11Raux E. Thermes C. Heathcote P. Rambach A. Warren M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3202-3212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two oligonucleotide primers were used to amplify the cobD region of pCOBC4 using PCR methodology. Primers 1 and 2 contained a 3′-region complementary to pCOBC4 and a 5′-noncomplementary end that generated either an EcoRI or aBamHI restriction enzyme site. These primers were used to amplify the −125 to +1148 region of pCOBC4. This fragment contained the entire cobD gene plus some flanking sequences. The 1291-bp fragment was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and ligated into the intermediate copy number vector pSU38 to generate pCOBD2. This plasmid complemented CobD function, i.e. restored cobalamin biosynthesis from (CN)2Cby without the addition of (R)-AP incobD mutants. cobD was resequenced from pCOBD2 to ensure that no mutations were introduced during amplification. Two oligonucleotide primers (primers 2 and 3) were used to amplify the cobD region of pCOBC4 using PCR. Primer 2 contained a 3′-region complementary to pCOBC4 and a 5′-noncomplementary end that generated a BamHI restriction enzyme site. Primer 3 was designed to introduce an NdeI restriction site immediately 5′ to the translation start site of cobD. The NdeI restriction site was required to align cobD with the efficient ribosome-binding site of the T7 overexpression vector pT7-7. Primers 2 and 3 were used to amplify the −16 to +1148 region of cobD. The 1173-bp fragment generated was digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into pT7-7 digested with the same enzymes to generate plasmid pCOBD6. cobD was resequenced from pCOBD6 to ensure that no mutations were introduced during amplification. Plasmid pCOBD6 and the control overexpression vector (pT7-7) were transformed into E. coli strain BL21/λDE3 to generate strains JE4094 (pCOBD6) and JE4096 (pT7-7), which were used in overexpression experiments. Following induction, proteins in the crude cell-free extracts were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. As shown in Fig. 3, cell-free extracts of strain JE4094 grown in the presence of IPTG (lane B) contained an extra protein band of ∼40 kDa compared with the strain containing the expression vector (pT7-7) lacking cobD (lane D). Cell-free extracts of strain JE4094 grown without IPTG (lane A) contained drastically reduced amounts of the ∼40-kDa protein. The molecular mass of the overexpressed protein correlated well with the predicted molecular mass of 40.8 kDa for CobD. Computer analysis of cobD sequence data suggested CobD was a PLP-dependent aminotransferase that catalyzed the reaction responsible for the synthesis of (R)-AP. We investigated this possibility and hypothesized that lactaldehyde was one of the substrates for CobD. To investigate whether cobD encoded lactaldehyde aminotransferase, activity assays were performed with crude cell-free extracts of JE4094 (pCOBD6) and JE4096 (pT7-7) after induction of T7 RNA polymerase. The assays were performed by providing either d- orl-lactaldehyde as the acceptor molecule and onel-amino acid as the amino donor. All 20 commonl-amino acids were tested as possible donors. After incubation with CobD-enriched cell-free extract, primary amine-containing compounds were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC after derivatization with oPA. The derivatized compounds were dete"

Antisense molecules targeted to the point mutation in codon 12 of Harvey Ras (Ha-Ras) mRNA resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in Ha-Ras RNA. Reduction in Ha-Ras RNA was dependent on the oligoribonucleotide gap size with the minimum gap size being four nucleotides. An antisense oligonucleotide of the same composition, but containing four mismatches, was inactive.When chimeric antisense oligonucleotides were prehybridized with 17-mer oligoribonucleotides, extracts prepared from T24 cells, cytosol, and nuclei resulted in cleavage in the oligoribonucleotide gap. Both strands were cleaved. Neither mammalian nor Escherichia coli RNase HI cleaved the duplex, nor did single strand nucleases. The dsRNase activity resulted in cleavage products with 5′-phosphate and 3′-hydroxyl termini.Partial purification of dsRNase from rat liver cytosolic and nuclear fractions was effected. The cytosolic enzyme was purified approximately 165-fold. It has an approximate molecular weight of 50,000–65,000, a pH optimum of approximately 7.0, requires divalent cations, and is inactivated by approximately 300 mm NaCl.

It is inactivated by heat, proteinase K, and also by a number of detergents and several organic solvents. Antisense oligonucleotides have been shown to inhibit gene expression for a number of cellular targets (1Crooke S.T. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1992; 32: 329-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). These compounds have proven to be effective research tools and are of interest as therapeutic agents. To date most antisense oligonucleotides studied have been oligodeoxynucleotides. Oligodeoxynucleotides are believed to cause a reduction in target RNA levels through the action of RNase H (2Neckers L. Whitesell L. Rosolen A. Geselowitz D.A. Crit. Rev. Oncol. 1992; 3: 175-231Google Scholar), an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of RNA:DNA duplexes (3Crouch R.J. Dirksen M.L. Linn S.M. Roberts R.J. Nucleases. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 21-241Google Scholar). This enzyme, thought to play a role in DNA replication, has been shown to be capable of cleaving the RNA component of oligodeoxynucleotide:RNA duplexes in cell-free systems as well as inXenopus oocytes (4Sankar S Cheah K.C. Porter A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 34-39Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 5Dash P. Lotan I. Knapp M. Kandel E.R. Goelet P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

RNase H is very sensitive to structural alterations in antisense oligonucleotides (7Crooke S.T. Bennett C.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. 1996; 36: 107-129Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar), and thus attempts to increase the potency of oligonucleotides by increasing affinity, stability, lipophilicity, and other characteristics by chemical modifications of the oligonucleotide have often resulted in oligonucleotides that no longer generate substrates for RNase H when bound to their target RNA (8Crooke S.T. Therapeutics Application of Oligonucleotides. R. G. Landes Publishers, Austin, TX1995: 1-25Google Scholar). RNase H activity is also somewhat variable (8Crooke S.T. Therapeutics Application of Oligonucleotides. R. G. Landes Publishers, Austin, TX1995: 1-25Google Scholar), thus a given disease state may not be a candidate for antisense therapy simply because the target tissue has insufficient RNase H activity. Therefore it is clear that terminating mechanisms in addition to RNase H are of potential value to the development of antisense therapeutics. In addition to the pharmacological inhibition of gene expression described above, it is becoming clear that organisms from bacteria to humans use endogenous antisense RNA transcripts to alter the stability of some target mRNAs and regulate gene expression (9Nellen W. Lichtenstein C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 419-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 10Nellen W. Hildebrandt M. Mahal B. Mohrle A. Kroger P. Maniak M. Oberhauser R. Sadiq M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1992; 20: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The best characterized cases of antisense-mediated gene regulation are derived from studies on bacteria; for example an endogenous antisense RNA transcript regulates the expression of mok mRNA in certain bacteria. As the antisense RNA level drops, mokmRNA levels rise, which leads to the induction of a cytotoxic protein (hok), resulting in cell death (11Gerdes K. Nielsen A. Thorsted P. Wagner E.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 637-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Other systems regulated by such mechanisms in bacteria include the RNA I-RNA II hybrid of the ColE1 plasmid (12Cesareni G. Helmer-Citterich M. Castagnoli L. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 230-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), OOP-cII RNA regulation in bacteriophage λ (13Krinke L. Wulff D.L. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2223-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and the copA-copT hybrids in Escherichia coli (14Blomberg P. Wagner E.G. Nordstrom K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2331-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In E. coli the RNA:RNA duplexes formed have been shown to be substrates for regulated degradation by the endoribonuclease RNase III. Duplex-dependent degradation has also been observed in the archaebacterium, Halobacterium salinarium, where an antisense transcript reduces expression of the early (T1) transcript of the phage gene phiH (15Stolt P. Zillig W. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 875-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In bacteria, RNase III is the double strand endoribonuclease responsible for the degradation of some antisense:sense RNA duplexes. RNase III carries out site-specific cleavage of double strand RNA (dsRNA) 1The abbreviations used are: ds, double strand; Ha-Ras, Harvey RAS; pCp, cytidine biophosphate. -containing structures and also plays an important role in mRNA processing and in the processing of rRNA precursors into 16, 23, and 5 S ribosomal RNA (16Dunn J.J Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 99: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, a yeast gene (RNT1) has recently been cloned that codes for a protein that has striking homology to E. coli RNase III and shows dsRNase activity as well as a role in ribosomal RNA processing (17Elela S.A. Igel H. Ares M. Cell. 1996; 85: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Avian cells treated with interferon produce and secrete a soluble nuclease capable of degrading dsRNA (18Meegan J. Marcus P.I. Science. 1989; 244: 1089-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); however, such a secreted dsRNase activity is not a likely candidate to be involved in the intracellular degradation of antisense:sense RNA duplexes. Despite these findings, little is known about human or mammalian dsRNase activities. In this work we have designed chimeric antisense oligonucleotides that contain 2′-methoxy-modified nucleotides in the “wings” and ribonucleotides in the “gap.” These compounds bind to their cellular targets with high affinity to form an oligonucleotide:mRNA duplex in cells. Designing a series of oligonucleotides with varying ribonucleotide content enabled us to identify, and partially purify, an activity in human cells and rat liver that requires the formation of a dsRNA region (oligoribonucleotide:mRNA) to degrade target RNA in cells. The finding that human cells and rat liver contain an activity capable of recognizing and cleaving dsRNA suggests that human cells may have conserved mechanisms for regulation of gene expression by antisense RNA present in prokaryotes. Further, this activity presents a novel terminating mechanism for antisense drugs. Strategies aiming to exploit this activity to its fullest may have important implications for antisense therapeutics. RNA gap mer 2′-methoxyphosphorothioate oligonucleotides were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems 380 B automated DNA synthesizer as described previously (19Chiang M.-Y. Chan H. Zounes M.A. Freier S.M. Lima W.F. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18162-18171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized using the automated synthesizer and 5′-dimethoxytrityl 2′-tert-butyldimethylsilyl 3′-O-phosphoramidite for the RNA portion and 5′-dimethoxytrityl 2′-O-methyl 3′-O-phosphroamidite for 5′ and 3′ wings. The protecting groups on the exocyclic amines were phenoxyacetyl for riboadenosine and riboguanosine, benzoyl for ribocytosine and 2′-O-methyl A and C, and isobutyl for 2′-O-methyl G. The standard synthesis cycle was modified by increasing the wait step after the delivery of tetrazole and base to 600 s repeated four times for RNA and twice for 2′-methoxy. The fully protected oligonucleotide was cleaved from the support, and the phosphate group was deprotected in 3:1 ammonia/ethanol at room temperature overnight, then lyophilized to dryness. Treatment in methanolic ammonia for 24 h at room temperature was then done to deprotect all bases, and the sample was again lyophilized to dryness. The pellet was resuspended in 1m tetrabutylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran for 24 h at room temperature to deprotect the 2′ positions. The reaction was then quenched with 1 m triethylaminoacetate, and the sample was then reduced to 0.5 volume by rotovac before being desalted on a G25 size exclusion column (Boehringer Mannheim). The oligonucleotide recovered was then analyzed spectrophotometrically at 260 nm for yield. Purity was characterized by capillary electrophoresis and by mass spectrometry. In all cases the purity was in excess of 90%. The sense oligonucleotide was 5′-end-labeled with 32P using [γ-32P]ATP, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and standard procedures (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1988Google Scholar). The labeled oligonucleotide was purified by electrophoresis on 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1988Google Scholar). The specific activity of the labeled oligonucleotide was approximately 5000 cpm/fmol. T24 human bladder carcinoma cells were maintained as monolayers in McCoys medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin. After treatment with oligonucleotide (see below for details) for 24 h, cells were trypsinized and centrifuged, and total cellular RNA was isolated according to standard protocols (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1988Google Scholar). To quantitate the relative abundance of Ha-Ras mRNA, total RNA (10 μg) was transferred by Northern blotting onto a Bio-Rad Zeta probe membrane (Bio-Rad) and UV cross-linked (Stratalinker, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Membrane-bound RNA was hybridized to a32P-labeled 0.9-kilobase pair Ha-Ras cDNA probe (Oncogene Science, Pasadena, CA) and exposed to XAR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The relative amount of Ha-Ras mRNA was determined by normalizing the Ha-Ras signal to that obtained when the same membrane was stripped and hybridized with a probe for human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Signals from Northern blots were quantified using a PhosphorImager and Imagequant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Cells growing as a monolayer were washed once with warm phosphate-buffered saline, then Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) medium containing Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at a concentration of 5 μg/ml per 200 nm of oligonucleotide up to a maximum concentration of 15 mg/ml was added. Oligonucleotides were added and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h, after which the medium was replaced with full serum medium. After 24 h in the presence of oligonucleotide, the cells were harvested, and RNA was prepared for further analysis. RNase H analysis was performed using a chemically synthesized 17-base oligoribonucleotide complementary to bases +23 to +40 of activated (codon 12 mutation) Ha-Ras mRNA. 20 nm of the 5′-end-labeled RNA was incubated with a 100-fold molar excess of the various antisense oligonucleotides in a reaction containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 4 units of RNase inhibitor (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in a final volume of 10 μl. Secondary structures in the oligonucleotides were melted out by heating to 95 °C for 5 min, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. Duplex formation was confirmed by the shift in mobility between the single strand end-labeled sense RNA and the annealed duplex on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. The resulting duplexes were tested as substrates for digestion by either E. coli RNase HI (U. S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH) or mammalian RNase HI (partially purified from calf thymus). 1 μl of a 1 × 10−4 mg/ml solution of either E. coliRNase HI or mammalian RNase HI was added to 10 μl of the duplex reaction and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, after which the reaction was terminated by the addition of denaturing loading buffer. Reaction products were resolved on a 12% polyacrylamide gel containing 7m urea and exposed to XAR film (Kodak). Duplexes used in the cell-free T24 extract experiments were annealed as described above. After formation of the duplex the reaction was treated with 1 μl of a mixture of RNase T and A (RPAII kit, Ambion, Austin, TX) and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, to remove any nonduplexed single strand oligonucleotides. The duplex was then gel-purified from a nondenaturing 12% polyacrylamide gel. T24 cell nuclear and cytosolic fractions were isolated as described previously (21Szyf M. Bozovic V. Tanigawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10027-10030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 10 μl of the annealed duplexes were incubated with 20 μg of the T24 nuclear or cytosolic extract at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol-precipitated with the addition of 10 μg of tRNA as a carrier. Pellets were resuspended in 10 μl of denaturing loading dye, and products were resolved on 12% denaturing acrylamide gels as described above. 32P-Labeled 17-base RNA was base-hydrolyzed by heating to 95 °C for 10 min in the presence of 50 mm NaCO2, pH 9.0, to generate a molecular weight ladder. Duplexes for the rat liver extracts were prepared in 30 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mmKCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol) containing 10 nm antisense oligonucleotide and 105 cpm of 32P-labeled sense oligonucleotide. Reactions were heated at 90 °C for 5 min and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The oligonucleotide duplexes were incubated with either unpurified and semipurified extracts at a total protein concentration of 25 μg of unpurified cytosolic extract, 20 μg of unpurified nuclear extract, 1–4 μl (1–4 μg) ion-exchange-purified cytosolic fraction, or 1–4 μl (100–400 ng) ion-exchange and gel filtration-purified cytosolic fractions or ion-exchange-purified nuclear fraction. Digestion reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 0–240 min. Following incubation, 10 μl of each reaction were removed and quenched by addition of denaturing gel loading buffer (5 μl of 8 m urea, 0.25% xylene cyanol FF, 0.25% bromphenol blue). The reactions were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and resolved in a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. To perform nondenaturing gel analysis, 20 μl of the reaction mixture were quenched by adding 2 μl of the native gel loading buffer (50% glycerol, 0.25% bromphenol blue FF). The reactions were resolved in a 12% native polyacrylamide gel containing 44 mm Tris borate and 1 mm MgCl2. Gels were analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Nonlabeled duplex was treated with T24 extracts as described previously. Half of this reaction was then treated with calf intestinal phosphatase (Stratagene) while the other half was left untreated. The phosphatase was inactivated by heating to 95 °C, and the reactions were extracted with phenol/chloroform and then precipitated in ethanol with glycogen as a carrier. The precipitates were then treated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Stratagene) and [γ- 32P]ATP (ICN, Irvine, CA). The samples were again extracted by phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. The products of the reaction were then resolved on a 12% acrylamide gel and visualized by exposure to Kodak XAR film. The 3′ terminus of the cleaved duplex was evaluated by the reaction of duplex digestion products with T4 RNA ligase (Stratagene) and [32P]pCp (ICN). 0.5 kg of rat liver was blended (Waring Commercial Blender, Dynamics Co. of America, New Hartford, CT) and homogenized (Polytron homogenizer, Brinkmann) in 5 ml of buffer X (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 1 mm EDTA, 2 m sucrose, 10% glycerol)/g tissue and centrifuged (Beckman centrifuge J2-21M) at 10,000 rpm for 40 min. The supernatant was precipitated with 40% ammonium sulfate (Sigma). All the activity was recovered in the 40% ammonium sulfate precipitate. The pellet was resuspended in buffer A (20 mmHepes, pH 6.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mKCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and Triton X-100) and dialyzed to remove ammonium sulfate. Approximately 40 g of cytosolic extract were obtained from 0.5 kg of liver. The crude nuclear pellet was resuspended and homogenized in a glass Dounce homogenizer (Tenbroeck Tissue Grinders, Willard, OH) in buffer Y (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25% glycerol). The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 1.5 h. The supernatant was precipitated with 70% ammonium sulfate. The pellet was resuspended and dialyzed in buffer A. Approximately 5 g of nuclear extract were obtained. Nuclear and cytosolic extracts in buffer A were centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were loaded onto Hi-Trap SP ion-exchange (Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden) columns in fast protein liquid chromotography. They were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl, and samples were collected, directly analyzed for activity, and measured for protein concentration (Bio-Rad). Active samples from the ion-exchange chromatography were pooled, concentrated by a centrifugal filter device (Millipore Co., Bedford, MA), applied to a TSK G-3000 column (Toso Haas, Montgomeryville, PA) with running buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl. Samples were collected and UV absorption at 280 nm was determined; then they were directly analyzed for activity and measured for protein concentration. Concentrated fractions from the gel filtration chromatography were subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1988Google Scholar). In two previous publications, structure-activity analyses of antisense oligonucleotides specific for codon 12 of the Ha-ras oncogene containing various 2′-sugar modifications were reported (22Monia B.P. Johnston J.F. Ecker D.J. Zounes M.A Lima W.F. Freier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19954-19962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Monia B.P. Lesnik E.A. Gonzalez C. Lima W.F. McGee D. Guinosso C.J. Kawasaki A.M. Cook P.D. Freier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14514-14522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the 2′-modified oligonucleotides hybridized with greater affinity to RNA than did unmodified oligodeoxynucleotides, they were completely ineffective in inhibiting Ha-ras gene expression (23Monia B.P. Lesnik E.A. Gonzalez C. Lima W.F. McGee D. Guinosso C.J. Kawasaki A.M. Cook P.D. Freier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14514-14522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lack of activity observed with these 2′-modified oligonucleotides was attributed to their inability to create duplexes that could serve as substrates for degradation by RNase H when bound to their target RNAs (22Monia B.P. Johnston J.F. Ecker D.J. Zounes M.A Lima W.F. Freier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19954-19962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because 2′-modified, and more specifically, 2′-methoxy oligonucleotides do not result in the nucleolytic degradation of their target mRNA, they provide a unique tool for the identification of novel nucleolytic activities that become activated when structural changes are introduced to fully modified 2′-methoxy antisense oligonucleotides. In this study we have introduced ribonucleotide stretches of various lengths into the center of 17-base 2′-methoxy oligonucleotides targeting Ha-Ras mRNA, to form 2′-methoxy-ribonucleotide 2′-methoxyphosphorothioate oligonucleotides (RNA gap mers) (see Fig. 1, A and B, for structures). When hybridized to the cellular mRNA target, the resulting duplex consists of two regions that are not targets for nucleolytic degradation (the 2′-methoxy “wings”) and one oligoribonucleotide:RNA duplex region that is potentially a target for a ribonuclease activity that recognizes RNA:RNA duplexes. T24 human bladder carcinoma cells contain an activating G213T transversion mutation in the Ha-ras gene at the codon 12 position (24Weinberg R.A. Cancer. 1988; 61: 1963-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Chimeric RNA gap mer antisense oligonucleotides specific for this mutation were transfected into T24 cells growing in culture. After incubation with oligonucleotides for 24 h, cells were harvested, total cytosolic RNA was isolated, and Northern blot analysis for Ha-Ras mRNA levels was performed. As previously observed, fully modified 2′-methoxy oligonucleotides did not support nucleolytic cleavage of target mRNA and therefore did not lead to a reduction in steady state levels of Ha-Ras mRNA, even at the highest concentration tested (Fig. 2 A, top panel, full 2′-methoxy). An RNA gap mer oligonucleotide with only 3 ribonucleotides in the gap was also incapable of inducing nucleolytic cleavage of the target RNA (Fig. 2 A, bottom panel, 3 GAP RNA). However, T24 cells treated with RNA gap mer oligonucleotides containing 5, 7, and 9 ribonucleotides in the gap as well as a full phosphorothioate oligoribonucleotide molecule displayed dose-dependent reductions in Ha-Ras steady state mRNA levels (Fig. 2 B, top four panels, respectively). T24 cells treated with a control 9-base RNA gap mer oligonucleotide that contained four mismatched bases in its sequence did not show dose-dependent reduction in Ha-Ras mRNA suggesting that hybridization to the target RNA was essential for activity (Fig. 2 B, bottom panel). The ability of the RNA gap mer oligonucleotides to reduce Ha-Ras mRNA was dependent on the number of ribonucleotides incorporated into the RNA gap and thus the size of the RNA:RNA duplex formed in cells. The fact that the RNA gap mer oligonucleotide containing three ribonucleotides in the gap was unable to induce reduction in target mRNA suggests that the activity involved requires an RNA:RNA duplex region of at least four ribonucleotides for cleavage of the target. T24 cells treated with 600 nm of the various RNA gap mer oligonucleotides demonstrated a reduction in Ha-Ras mRNA levels of 51 ± 8% for the 5 RNA gap mer, 49 ± 4% for the 7 RNA gap mer, 77 ± 1% for the 9-base RNA gap mer, and 38 ± 5% for the full oligoribonucleotide, respectively, when compared with nontreated controls. The full phosphorothioate oligoribonucleotide molecule was slightly less active than the RNA gap mer oligonucleotides. This is probably due to the relative decrease in stability of the full oligoribonucleotide in cells resulting from inactivation by single stranded ribonucleases, as phosphorothioate 2′-methoxy modified oligonucleotides are considerably more stable than phosphorothioate oligoribonucleotides (25Crooke S.T. Graham M.J. Zuckerman J.E. Brooks D. Conklin B.S. Cummins M.J. Greig M.J. Guinosso Kornburst D. Monoharan M. Sasmor H.M. Schleich T. Tivel K.L. Griffey R.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 277: 923-937PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that for therapeutic purposes RNA gap mer phosphorothioate oligonucleotides protected by 2′-methoxy wings (or other even more stable 2′ modifications) would be more potent molecules. These experiments demonstrate that an endoribonuclease activity in T24 human bladder carcinoma cells recognizes the internal oligoribonucleotide:RNA portion of a chimeric duplex and reduces target mRNA levels. To further characterize the dsRNA cleavage activity in T24 cells, we prepared T24 cellular extracts and tested these for the ability to cleave a 17-base pair duplex consisting of the 9-base RNA gap mer oligonucleotide annealed to its complementary32P-end-labeled oligoribonucleotide. The 32P- labeled duplex was incubated with 20 μg of cytosolic extract at 37 °C for the indicated times (Fig. 3 A), followed by phenol chloroform extraction, ethanol precipitation, and separation of the products on a denaturing gel. This duplex was a substrate for digestion by an activity present in T24 extracts as can be seen by the loss of full-length end-labeled RNA and the appearance of lower molecular weight digestion products (indicated by arrows, Fig. 3 A). In addition, the activity responsible for the cleavage of the duplex displayed specificity for the RNA:RNA portion of the duplex molecule, as indicated by the sizes of the cleavage products it produced (see the physical map of the 32P-end-labeled 9-base RNA gap mer:RNA duplex, Fig. 3 A, far right). To evaluate the cellular distribution of this dsRNase activity, nuclear extracts were prepared from T24 cells and tested for the ability to digest the 9-base RNA gap mer oligonucleotide:RNA duplex. Nuclear extracts prepared from T24 cells were able to degrade the target duplex, and the activity was present in the nuclear fraction at comparable levels to that in the cytoplasmic fractions (data not shown). Cellular extracts prepared from human umbilical vein epithelial cells, human lung carcinoma (A549), and HeLa cell lines all contained an activity able to induce cleavage of the 9-base RNA gap mer:RNA target duplex in vitro. This activity was abolished by pretreatment of the extracts with proteinase K for 15 min at 65 °C (data not shown). The initial RNA gap mer antisense oligonucleotides were synthesized to contain phosphorothioate linkages throughout the entire length of the molecule. As this results in increased stability to single strand nucleases, we reasoned that it would inhibit cleavage of the antisense strand by the dsRNase as well. Therefore, to determine if the activity we have described can cleave both strands in a RNA duplex molecule, we synthesized a 9-base RNA gap mer antisense oligonucleotide that contained phosphorothioate linkages in the wings between the 2′-methoxy nucleotides but had phosphodiester linkages between the nine ribonucleotides in the gap. A duplex comprised of the32P-labeled 9-base RNA gap mer phosphodiester/phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotide described above and its complementary oligoribonucleotide was tested as a substrate for the dsRNase activity in T24 extracts. The activity was capable of cleaving the antisense strand of this duplex as well as the sense strand and the pattern of the digestion products indicated that cleavage was again restricted to the RNA:RNA phosphodiester portion of the duplex (data not shown). To exclude the possibility that the cleavage seen might be due to an RNase H type activity, we tested the ability of E. coli RNase H to cleave a 17-base pair duplex composed of the 9-base RNA gap mer oligonucleotide and its complementary 5′-32P-labeled oligoribonucleotide in vitro. As can be seen in Fig. 3 B (far right panel), the 9-base RNA gap mer oligonucleotide:RNA duplex was not a substrate for RNase H cleavage as n"

P-selectin is a type I membrane protein receptor for leukocytes, acting during the inflammation response. Heterologous expression experiments have demonstrated that its 35-residue cytoplasmic tail contains signals for targeting to synaptic-like microvesicles, dense-cored granules, and lysosomes. We have examined the lysosomal targeting information present within the cytoplasmic tail by site-directed mutagenesis of horseradish peroxidase-P-selectin chimeras followed by transient transfection in H.Ep.2 cells. Assaying lysosomal targeting by subcellular fractionation as well as intracellular proteolysis, we have discovered a novel lysosomal targeting signal, KCPL, located within the C1 domain of the cytoplasmic tail. Alanine substitution of this tetrapeptide reduced lysosomal targeting to the level of a tailless horseradish peroxidase-P-selectin chimera, which was previously found to be deficient in both internalization and delivery to lysosomes. A proline residue within this lysosomal targeting signal makes a major contribution to the efficiency of lysosomal targeting. A diaminobenzidine density shift procedure established that chimeras with an inactivated KCPL sequence are present within transferrin-positive compartments. Such a mutant also displays an increased level of expression at the plasma membrane. Our results indicate that the sequence KCPL within the cytoplasmic tail of P-selectin is a structural element that mediates sorting from endosomes to lysosomes.

This information is usually found in short stretches of amino acids, “sorting signals,” which serve to direct proteins to a variety of intracellular destinations. The most common signals can be classified into two groups: Tyr-based and di-Leu signals. Conformational modeling and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) of peptides encoding these motifs have revealed that the first group, typically conforming to Asn-Pro-X-Tyr or Tyr-X-X-Ø sequences (where X is any amino acid and Ø is a bulky hydrophobic amino acid), form a “tight turn” (5Bansal A.

One interesting exception is the EGFR, in which mutations inactivating lysosomal targeting were found not to affect internalization (27Felder S. Miller K. Moehren G. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J.

Setiadi H. McEver R.P. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 435-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar,25Subramaniam M. Koedam J.A. Wagner D.D. Mol. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1229-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), distinguishing different signals from each other is a complex problem. We therefore chose to study targeting in a system that lacks some of the possible destinations. We have begun by analyzing P-selectin targeting to late endocytic compartments in cells in which the endocytic pathway has been extensively characterized (30van Deurs B. Holm P.K. Kayser L. Sandvig K. Hansen S.H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 61: 208-224PubMed Google Scholar, 31Ghosh R.N. Gelman D.L. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2177-2189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Futter C.E.

In this study, we examined the effects of mutations within the cytoplasmic tail on lysosomal targeting of P-selectin in H.Ep.2 cells, which lack regulated secretory organelles. We have uncovered a novel short LTS, KCPL, which is located within the C1 domain and which has no obvious homology to LTSs identified in other proteins. The proline residue within this LTS significantly contributes to the efficiency of lysosomal sorting. Rabbit polyclonal anti-HRP was from DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark. Fab fragments of this antibody were generated using a commercial ImmunoPure® Fab preparation kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mouse receptor-grade epidermal growth factor (EGF) and human, iron-saturated transferrin (Trn) were purchased from Sigma. Iodination of Fab fragments, EGF, and Trn has been performed according to the modified IODO-GEN method as described elsewhere (35Wiley H.S. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4222-4229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity of preparations were: 3 × 104, 1 × 105, and 2 × 104 cpm/ng, respectively. Protein concentration was determined using Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Other chemicals were from Sigma and Pharmacia Biotech Inc. A chimeric cDNA containing the human growth hormone signal sequence, followed by HRP, and finally the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of P-selectin (Fig. 1) was generated as described previously (26Norcott J.P. Solari R. Cutler D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1229-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding the deletion mutants, ssHRPP-selectin776, ssHRPP-selectin763, and ssHRPP-selectinΔC1, were constructed as detailed in this report. Both the point mutation of proline 767 and the tetra-alanine changes were made using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. Briefly, cesium chloride-purified pRK34 plasmid containing the ssHRPP-selectin was added to two complementary synthetic oligonucleotide primers which contained the change of interest. After temperature cycling with Pfu DNA polymerase, a mutated plasmid containing a staggered nick was generated. The parental DNA was then digested away with DpnI restriction endonuclease, which is active only on methylated and hemimethylated DNA. The nicked mutated vector was transformed into supercompetent Escherichia coli. The sequences generated were confirmed by sequencing. The sequences of the oligonucleotide primers used to generate the mutants are listed below. Only the sense primer is shown; the antisense primer used is the exact complement. The primers used are as follows: P-selectinP767A, GATGGGAAATGCgCCTTGAATCCTCAC; P-selectinKDDG, CGTTTCAGACAGGCAGCTGCTGCGAAATGCCCCTTG; P-selectinKCPL, AAAGATGATGGGGCAGCCGCCGCGAATCCTCACAGC; and P-selectinNPHS, AAATGCCCCTTGGCTGCTGCCGCCCACCTAGGAACA. The human cell line H.Ep.2 was cultured and transiently transfected as described elsewhere (36Connolly C.N. Futter C.E. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. Cutler D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 641-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Cells were plated on 150- and 35-mm dishes and in some experiments were grown for 24 h in presence of 100 μm each of pepstatin A and leupeptin prior to use. Cells on 35-mm dishes were placed on ice, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and subjected to Triton X-114 partitioning as described (37Masterson W.J. Magee A.I. Magee A.I. Wileman T. Protein Targeting: a Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1992: 242Google Scholar) followed by a standard HRP assay (see below) performed with two phases. Amounts of HRP activity present in the upper, hydrophilic and lower, hydrophobic phases were used to determine the percentage of clipped chimera as a ratio of HRP activity in the upper phase to the total activity in the lysate. To normalize for inter-experimental variations, we subtracted the fraction of HRP proteolysis of tailless ssHRPP-selectin763 chimera (typically about 25%) as background from each data set, since this chimera has been demonstrated previously to be incapable of internalization and, consequently, of delivery to lysosomes instead accumulating on the plasma membrane (26Norcott J.P. Solari R. Cutler D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1229-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Cells on 35-mm dishes were washed with growth medium, placed on ice, and incubated with 2 μg/ml125I-Fab fragments in growth medium at 4 °C for 1 h. Unbound ligand was removed by three rinses with growth medium. Cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 1 ml of HRP assaying buffer (100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 0.1% Triton X-100) at 4 °C for 10 min. Lysates were counted in a γ-counter (Hewlett Packard) and then spun at 13,000 × g for 5 min in a refrigerated centrifuge to pellet cell debris. Supernatants were used for measurement of HRP activity (see below). Cell surface expression levels were determined as a ratio of the amount of 125I-Fab fragments to the level of HRP activity for each chimera, to normalize for variation of expression level. The ratio for ssHRPP-selectin was set at 1 for all experiments, and the data from all other chimeras have been normalized accordingly. Cells on 150-mm dishes were washed with binding medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 20 mmHEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and incubated with either 5 ng/ml125I-EGF at 4 °C for 1 h or 100 ng/ml125I-Trn at 37 °C for 1 h. Excess ligand was removed by three rinses with cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The cells loaded with 125I-Trn were placed on ice and subsequently treated with MES buffer I (25 mm MES, pH 4.0, 150 mm NaCl) and MES buffer II (25 mm MES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) at 4 °C for 10 min each to remove any cell surface-bound ligand. The cells labeled with 125I-EGF were allowed to internalize ligand for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by a 2.5-min mild acid wash (100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 500 mm NaCl) at 4 °C to extract 125I-EGF present on the plasma membrane. In both cases, the cells were then thoroughly washed with ice-cold binding medium, washed twice with HB (320 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3), and subjected to subcellular fractionation as detailed below. Following two rinses with ice-cold HB, cells were scraped into 1.5 ml of HB with a rubber policeman and passed 10 times through a ball bearing homogenizer with a 0.009-mm clearance (made at EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany). The cell homogenate was spun at 8,500 × g for 5 min and 1.3 ml of postnuclear supernatant (PNS) was layered on an 11-ml 1–16% preformed linear Ficoll gradient made in HB. The gradients were centrifuged for 45 min at 35 ,00 rpm in a SW40Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) and then fractionated in 0.5-ml fractions from the top of the tube using an Autodensi-Flow IIC (Buchler Instruments, Kansas City, MO), and radioactivity of fractions was counted. Positions of lysosomes and late endosomes were identified by measurement of activity of the lysosomal marker enzyme, N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase (NAGA), as described previously (38Kornilova E.S. Taverna D. Hoeck W. Hynes N.E. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 511-519PubMed Google Scholar). The fractions containing most NAGA activity were further purified using a second centrifugation. Fractions 17–23 from the 1–16% Ficoll gradient were pooled together; 2.5 ml of this material was diluted with HB to make 4 ml and layered on a 9-ml 7–25% Ficoll gradient. Centrifugation, fractionation, and measurement of NAGA activity were then carried out as described for initial Ficoll gradients. Targeting data were described as a lysosomal targeting index (LTI), i.e. the amount of HRP activity present in LE/Lys fractions for each mutant normalized to that for ssHRPP-selectin. Accordingly, in all the experiments, the LTI for ssHRPP-selectin was set at 1. To take into account variations of expression level, number of cells, and lysosomal yield, the amount of HRP activity present in the LE/Lys peak (HRP peak) has been corrected for the amount of NAGA activity or 125I-EGF radioactivity (NAGA(EGF) peak) within the LE/Lys fractions and for total HRP activity in the homogenate (HRP hmg). After simplifying the original equation, the LTI was defined as follows. LTI=mutant HRP peak/mutant NAGA(EGF)peak×mutant HRP hmgWT HRP peak/WT NAGA(EGF)peak×WT HRP hmgEquation 1 Typically, the LTI for tailless ssHRPP-selectin763was about 20% of that for ssHRPP-selectin and was subtracted from those for the other chimeras in each experiment to provide a base-line value. Thus, the LTI for ssHRPP-selectin763 was considered as 0. The LTIs of the mutants were therefore described on a scale within a range set by ssHRPP-selectin (LTI = 1) and ssHRPP-selectin763 (LTI = 0). A modification of the procedure, originally developed by Courtoy et al. (39Courtoy P.J. Quintart J. Baudhuin P. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) was used. A 4.5 mm solution of DAB in HB was prepared, adjusted to pH 7.3 with 1 n NaOH, and filtered through an 0.22-μm filter (Millipore Corp.). PNS or gradient fractions (700 μl) were mixed with 800 μl of DAB solution and 8 μl of 6% H2O2and incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. A 700-μl control sample from the same PNS or Ficoll fraction was incubated in parallel with 800 μl of HB alone. Subsequently, the mixtures (1.5 ml) were layered on Ficoll gradients made with HB supplemented with 1 mm imidazole. When the DAB reaction was performed with PNS, the samples were centrifuged on 1–16% Ficoll gradients. Ficoll fractions subjected to DAB reaction were recentrifuged on secondary Ficoll gradients; 7–25% Ficoll gradients were used to analyze the LE/Lys fractions, and 3–16% Ficoll gradients were used for analysis of plasma-membrane vesicles labeled by 125I-EGF. To quantitate the degree of the density shift of each ligand, the amount of radioactivity remaining within the peak of ligand distribution as a consequence of DAB cytochemistry was divided by the radioactivity in the endosomal peak in the samples not incubated with DAB, expressed in percentages and subtracted from 100%. HRP activity was assayed in triplicate as described previously (26Norcott J.P. Solari R. Cutler D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1229-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated previously that the C1 domain of the cytoplasmic tail of P-selectin is involved in the targeting of this protein to lysosomes (21Green S.A. Setiadi H. McEver R.P. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 435-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To further characterize the signal(s) involved in lysosomal targeting, a series of chimeras between P-selectin and the enzymatic reporter HRP (Fig. 1) were constructed, and their lysosomal trafficking in H.Ep.2 cells following transient expression was analyzed. These chimeras contain the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of human P-selectin with the lumenal portion replaced by HRP and can be followed through the cell by their enzymatic activity. We began by determining the efficiency of targeting of wild-type and mutant P-selectin chimeras to late endosomes (multivesicular bodies (MVB) in H.Ep.2 cells; see “Discussion”) and lysosomes (LE/Lys) by subcellular fractionation. A mixed population of LE/Lys was deliberately analyzed since the ultimate destination of chimeras within the late endocytic system was unknown. To develop the fractionation protocol, two different markers were used: NAGA as a lysosomal marker enzyme, and 125I-EGF as a tracer, which is internalized from the plasma membrane through endosomal compartments en route to lysosomes. To establish conditions for the internalization of125I-EGF so that it is within late endocytic compartments, the kinetics of degradation and the dynamics of compartmentalization of internalized ligand were followed by centrifugation of PNS on linear 1–16% Ficoll gradients. 125I-EGF was bound to the cells at 4 °C for 60 min and internalized at 37 °C for various times, and the cells were treated with acidic buffer to remove the plasma membrane-bound ligand. Kinetic experiments showed that after 30 min of internalization, 90% of the cell-associated radioactivity was acid-resistant, i.e. intracellular, but no significant degradation had occurred, as judged by a trichloroacetic acid precipitation of the chase medium (data not shown). When PNS obtained from these cells was centrifuged on a 1–16% Ficoll gradient, most of the NAGA and 125I-EGF sedimented in the same highest buoyant density fractions (fractions 16–20 and 21–23) (Fig. 2). In contrast, at earlier internalization times, 125I-EGF was found exclusively in the low density fractions (fractions 4–10), in which internalized125I-Trn, a marker for early/recycling endosomes (40Hopkins C.R. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 508-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), was detected (Fig. 8, −DAB traces). Together, these observations stro"
https://openalex.org/W2090763433,"TSG101 has been identified as a candidate tumor suppressor gene and abnormal transcripts have been identified in a substantial fraction of breast cancers. To determine whether TSG101 expression is commonly altered in other tumors, a series of 15 primary and metastatic prostate cancers were analysed by reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification. Abnormal transcripts with extensive deletions in the coding region were found in nine of these tumors, while only the normal transcript was found in control and benign prostatic hypertrophy tissues. More than one abnormal transcript was found in four of these nine cases and distinct abnormal TSG101 transcripts were found in separate biopsies taken from one tumor. Importantly, the normal TSG101 transcript was undetectable in two metastatic prostate cancers, indicating the absence of TSG101 protein. Sequence analysis demonstrated that there were at least six distinct deletions, with four of these deletions found in more than one tumor sample. The most commonly identified deletion, from bp 153 to 1055, was identical to a deletion reported previously in breast cancer. These results demonstrate that TSG101 transcripts are frequently abnormal in prostate cancer and suggest that loss of TSG101 protein contributes to disease development or progression."
https://openalex.org/W1990950884,"The recent finding that S100A11 is a component of the keratinocyte cornified envelope (CE) (Robinson, N. A., Lapic, S., Welter, J. F., and Eckert, R. L. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 12035–12046) suggests that S100A11 is a transglutaminase (TG) substrate. In the present study we show that S100A11 forms multimers when cultured keratinocytes are challenged by increased levels of intracellular calcium and that multimer formation is inhibited by the TG inhibitor, cystamine. These S100A11 multimers appear to be incorporated into the CE, as immunoreactive S100A11 is detected in purified envelopes prepared from cultured cells and from foreskin epidermis. To study S100A11 as a transglutaminase substrate, recombinant human S100A11 (rhS100A11) was used in a cell-free cross-linking system. [14C]Putrescine, a primary amine, labels rhS100A11 in a TG-dependent manner. Trypsin digestion of [14C]putrescine-labeled rhS100A11 releases one radiolabeled peptide, Ala98-Lys103. The glutamine residue in this segment, Gln102, is the site of radiolabel incorporation indicating that Gln102 functions as an amine acceptor. The ability of S100A11 to form multimers indicates that it also has a reactive lysine residue that functions as an amine donor. To identify the reactive residue, we compared the high pressure liquid chromatography profile of trypsin-digested rhS100A11 monomer to that of cross-linked rhS100A11. A unique cross-linked peptide was purified and identified as Met-Ala-Lys3-Ilu-Ser-Ser-Pro-Thr-Glu-Thr-Glu-Arg cross-linked via an Lys3-Gln102 isopeptide bond to Ala-Val-Pro-Ser-Gln102-Lys. These studies show that S100A11 is post-translationally modified by transglutaminase, that it can be cross-linked to form multimers, that it is present in CEs from cultured keratinocytes and in vivo epidermis, and that Lys3 and Gln102 are specific sites of cross-link formation. The recent finding that S100A11 is a component of the keratinocyte cornified envelope (CE) (Robinson, N. A., Lapic, S., Welter, J. F., and Eckert, R. L. (1997) J. Biol.

Because of the importance of this structure, identifying the proteins that compose the envelope is an area of intense interest. We recently identified two S100 proteins, S100A11 (S100C, calgizzarin) and S100A10 (calpactin light chain, p11), as components of cornified envelopes prepared from cultured keratinocytes (7Robinson N.A.

They comprise a family of 10–12-kilodalton acidic proteins that form homo- and heterodimers and bind calcium via two “EF hand motifs.” When intracellular calcium levels increase, calcium binding to the EF hand motifs triggers a conformational change that exposes hydrophobic domains promoting S100 complex formation with target proteins. As S100 proteins have no known enzymatic activity, they are thought to regulate the activity of specific target proteins in a calmodulin-like manner (8Schafer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem.

In the present study we provide direct evidence that transglutaminase covalently modifies S100A11, and we also identify the residues that are modified. Our results suggest that one physiological role of S100A11 in keratinocytes is as a component of the keratinocyte-cornified envelope. Transglutaminases are calcium-dependent enzymes that catalyze the formation of interprotein ε-(γ-glutamyl)lysine bonds (i.e. covalent cross-links between the side groups of peptide-bound Gln and Lys residues) (1Folk J.E.

Because of the importance of this structure, identifying the proteins that compose the envelope is an area of intense interest. We recently identified two S100 proteins, S100A11 (S100C, calgizzarin) and S100A10 (calpactin light chain, p11), as components of cornified envelopes prepared from cultured keratinocytes (7Robinson N.A.

They comprise a family of 10–12-kilodalton acidic proteins that form homo- and heterodimers and bind calcium via two “EF hand motifs.” When intracellular calcium levels increase, calcium binding to the EF hand motifs triggers a conformational change that exposes hydrophobic domains promoting S100 complex formation with target proteins. As S100 proteins have no known enzymatic activity, they are thought to regulate the activity of specific target proteins in a calmodulin-like manner (8Schafer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem.

It forms an essential complex with its cognate single-strand DNA-binding protein, ICP8. The DNA helicase activity of the UL9 protein is greatly stimulated as a consequence of this interaction. A complex of these two proteins is thought to be responsible for unwinding the viral origins of DNA replication. The aim of this study was to identify the mechanism by which ICP8 stimulates the translocation of the UL9 protein along DNA.

ICP8 caused maximal stimulation of DNA unwinding activity at equimolar UL9 protein concentrations, indicating that the active species is a complex that contains UL9 protein and ICP8 in 1:1 ratio. ICP8 prevented dissociation of UL9 protein from the DNA substrate, suggesting that it increases its processivity. ICP8 specifically stimulated the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of the UL9 protein with DNA cofactors that allow translocation of UL9 protein and those with secondary structure. These data suggest that UL9 protein and ICP8 form a specific complex that translocates along DNA.

Lehman I.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 347-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Replication of origin-containing plasmids requires the action of seven viral gene products (2Wu C.A.

Virol. 1988; 62: 444-453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These seven gene products comprise a highly processive heterodimeric DNA polymerase (UL30/UL42 genes), a heterotrimeric DNA helicase-primase (UL5/UL8/UL52genes), a single-strand DNA-binding protein (SSB) (UL29gene), and an origin-binding protein (UL9 gene) (reviewed in Ref. 1Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 347-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar).The origin-binding protein (UL9 protein) is a 94-kDa protein that recognizes specific elements in the HSV-1 origins of DNA replication (4Elias P.

A. 1988; 85: 5414-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The UL9 protein also possesses intrinsic DNA helicase activity, and associated nucleoside triphosphatase (ATPase) activity, that is presumably required for unwinding the origins of DNA replication (6Bruckner R.C.

The HSV-1 SSB, henceforth referred to as ICP8 (infected cell polypeptide8), is a 128-kDa protein, capable of binding single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) cooperatively and with high affinity (10Ruyechan W.T. J. Virol. 1983; 46: 661-666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ICP8 forms a specific complex with the UL9 protein by interacting with its extreme C terminus (11Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

In addition, ICP8 has been shown to interact with the HSV-1 DNA polymerase and helicase-primase (14Littler D. Purifoy D. Minson A. Powell K.L. J. Gen.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22766-22770Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The ability of ICP8 to participate in multiple protein-protein interactions suggests that it fulfills several roles during viral DNA replication.The interaction between ICP8 and UL9 protein greatly stimulates the rate and extent of DNA unwinding catalyzed by the UL9 protein, enabling it to unwind long stretches of DNA (9Boehmer P.E. Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1220-1225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Makhov A.M. Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 789-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It has been shown that disruption of the ICP8-UL9 protein complex by deletion of the 27 C-terminal amino acid of the UL9 protein greatly reduces origin-specific DNA replication (12Boehmer P.E. Craigie M.C. Stow N.D. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29329-29334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Presumably, the ICP8-UL9 protein complex promotes efficient unwinding of the HSV-1 origins of DNA replication (20Makhov A.M. Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1742-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21Lee S.S.-K. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2838-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).This study examines the mechanism by which ICP8 stimulates the DNA helicase and ATPase activities of the UL9 protein. The results show that ICP8 increases the processivity of the UL9 protein, facilitating its translocation along DNA and through regions of secondary structure.DISCUSSIONThe aim of this study was to identify the mechanism by which the HSV-1 SSB, ICP8, stimulates the DNA helicase and DNA-dependent ATPase activities of the HSV-1 origin-binding protein (UL9 protein).The results show that subsaturating concentrations of ICP8 were sufficient to stimulate the DNA helicase activity of the UL9 protein, and that maximal stimulation occurred at an ICP8 to UL9 protein ratio of 1:1. This observation is consistent with the existence of a specific ICP8-UL9 protein complex that translocates along the DNA and is active during DNA unwinding. In addition, the stoichiometry of 1:1 inferred from the functional interaction between ICP8 and UL9 protein is identical to that observed for the physical complex (13Gustafsson C.M. Falkenberg M. Simonsson S. Valadi H. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19028-19034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).ICP8 also stimulated the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of the UL9 protein in a species-specific manner. A heterologous SSB, E-SSB, led to inhibition of activity, presumably by preventing access of the UL9 protein to the DNA substrate. Furthermore, ICP8 partially reversed the inhibitory effect of E-SSB. These observations are indicative of a specific tertiary complex that consists of UL9 protein, ICP8, and ssDNA.Interestingly, the stimulatory effect of ICP8 on the DNA helicase and DNA-dependent ATPase activities of the UL9 protein was dependent on the ICP8/nucleotide ratio. Maximal stimulation was observed at subsaturating concentrations of ICP8, whereas coating concentrations produced less of an effect. Assuming that the level of stimulation correlates with the physical association of ICP8 and UL9 protein, these results suggest that the ICP8-UL9 protein complex is less stable at high ICP8/nucleotide ratios. This finding may explain why Gustafsson et al. (13Gustafsson C.M. Falkenberg M. Simonsson S. Valadi H. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19028-19034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) failed to detect a physical complex of UL9 protein, ICP8, and ssDNA at high ICP8/nucleotide ratios. It is possible that, when ICP8 is in excess and all ssDNA sites are occupied, ICP8 undergoes a conformational change and loses its affinity for UL9 protein.The existence of a lag in the initial phase of the DNA unwinding reaction catalyzed by the UL9 protein suggests that the rate-limiting step is its association with the DNA substrate. This conclusion is substantiated by the observation that the lag was eliminated by preincubating the UL9 protein and DNA substrate. Moreover, rapid and maximal stimulation of DNA unwinding by ICP8 was only observed when UL9 protein was preincubated with DNA substrate or with ongoing DNA helicase reactions. Consequently, ICP8 exerts its maximal effect on a preassembled UL9 protein-DNA complex.The observation that ICP8 had no effect on the DNA-independent ATPase activity of the UL9 protein suggests that it does not directly affect the catalytic site of the UL9 protein. Therefore, experiments were designed to examine how ICP8 influences the interaction of the UL9 protein with its DNA substrate during DNA unwinding and DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis. Both activities entail translocation of the UL9 protein along ssDNA and through regions of duplex DNA. Consequently, these experiments addressed how ICP8 affects the translocation of UL9 protein along DNA.Addition of excess challenger DNA to ongoing DNA unwinding reactions showed that UL9 protein was effectively competed from the DNA substrate, implying that it dissociates rapidly from the DNA substrate and that it is nonprocessive. The inhibitory effect of the competitor DNA was eliminated by ICP8. Specifically, equimolar, subsaturating concentrations of ICP8 added immediately prior to competitor DNA prevented the effect of the challenger DNA. These results suggest that ICP8 prevents the dissociation of UL9 protein from the DNA substrate and therefore increases its processivity. Further evidence for the processivity enhancing function of ICP8 is provided by previous experiments in which ICP8 enabled the UL9 protein to unwind long regions of DNA (up to ∼3 kilobase pairs) (9Boehmer P.E. Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1220-1225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Makhov A.M. Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 789-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).(dT)15 is sufficient to elicit the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of the UL9 protein (8Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1213-1219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Presumably, this cofactor is sufficiently long to allow the UL9 protein to bind but is too short to allow translocation of the UL9 protein along the DNA. The extent of ATP hydrolysis seen with this cofactor should therefore be representative of UL9 protein binding only. Consistent with the assumption that ICP8 increases the processivity of the UL9 protein, there was no effect of ICP8 on the rate of ATP hydrolysis with (dT)15. In contrast, ATP hydrolysis with longer DNA cofactors, which allow both binding and translocation of the UL9 protein, was greatly stimulated by ICP8. Furthermore, ICP8 had an even greater stimulatory effect on ATP hydrolysis with DNA cofactors that contain secondary structure.In conclusion, the ability of ICP8 to prevent competition with challenger DNA during DNA unwinding, and to stimulate ATP hydrolysis with DNA cofactors that allow translocation, implies that it prevents dissociation of the UL9 protein from the DNA substrate and increases its processivity. In addition, ICP8 appears to facilitate translocation of the UL9 protein through regions of duplex DNA. This is probably a manifestation of the helix-destabilizing activity of ICP8 (24Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 711-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 9 shows a model of how ICP8 stimulates the translocation of the UL9 protein along ssDNA and through regions of duplex DNA.

One molecule of ICP8 is bound to the C terminus of each UL9 protein molecule (11Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 29329-29334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), allowing one ICP8 molecule to bind the template strand, tethering the UL9 protein to the DNA substrate, while the second molecule of ICP8 assimilates and stabilizes the unwound primer strand, thereby facilitating the translocation of the UL9 protein through regions of duplex DNA.Previous studies have shown that a site-specific cisplatin lesion impairs the DNA helicase activity of the UL9 protein (22Villani G. Pillaire M.J. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21676-21681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was shown that ICP8 relieved the inhibitory effect imposed by the lesion. Based on the findings in this study, it is likely that ICP8 enables the UL9 protein to bypass the lesion by tethering it to the DNA substrate, thereby preventing its dissociation.The effects of cognate and noncognate SSBs have been documented for numerous DNA helicases (reviewed in Refs. 26Kornberg A.

In most cases, SSBs have been shown to enhance DNA unwinding by preventing nonproductive binding of the DNA helicase to the DNA substrate. Specific protein-protein interactions between DNA helicases and cognate SSBs have also been shown to increase the length of DNA unwound. However, no previous studies have addressed the exact mechanism by which an SSB stimulates DNA unwinding.Previous studies have indicated the importance of the ICP8-UL9 protein interaction for HSV-1 origin-specific DNA replication (12Boehmer P.E.

Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) 1The abbreviations used are: HSV-1, herpes simplex virus type-1; SSB, single-strand DNA-binding protein; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; E-SSB, E. coli SSB; EPPS, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-(3-propanesulfonic acid). 1The abbreviations used are: HSV-1, herpes simplex virus type-1; SSB, single-strand DNA-binding protein; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; E-SSB, E. coli SSB; EPPS, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-(3-propanesulfonic acid). is a double-stranded DNA virus with a genome of ∼152 kilobase pairs that contains three origins of DNA replication (1Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 347-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Replication of origin-containing plasmids requires the action of seven viral gene products (2Wu C.A. Nelson N.J. McGeoch D.J. Challberg M.D. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 435-443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3McGeoch D.J. Dalrymple M.A. Dolan A. McNab D. Perry L.J. Taylor P. Challberg M.D. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 444-453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These seven gene products comprise a highly processive heterodimeric DNA polymerase (UL30/UL42 genes), a heterotrimeric DNA helicase-primase (UL5/UL8/UL52genes), a single-strand DNA-binding protein (SSB) (UL29gene), and an origin-binding protein (UL9 gene) (reviewed in Ref. 1Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 347-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The origin-binding protein (UL9 protein) is a 94-kDa protein that recognizes specific elements in the HSV-1 origins of DNA replication (4Elias P. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2959-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 5Olivo P.D. Nelson N.J. Challberg M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5414-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The UL9 protein also possesses intrinsic DNA helicase activity, and associated nucleoside triphosphatase (ATPase) activity, that is presumably required for unwinding the origins of DNA replication (6Bruckner R.C. Crute J.J. Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2669-2674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Fierer D.S. Challberg M.D. J.

Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1220-1225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HSV-1 SSB, henceforth referred to as ICP8 (infected cell polypeptide8), is a 128-kDa protein, capable of binding single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) cooperatively and with high affinity (10Ruyechan W.T. J. Virol. 1983; 46: 661-666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ICP8 forms a specific complex with the UL9 protein by interacting with its extreme C terminus (11Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8444-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Boehmer P.E. Craigie M.C. Stow N.D. Lehman I.R. J. Biol.

In addition, ICP8 has been shown to interact with the HSV-1 DNA polymerase and helicase-primase (14Littler D. Purifoy D. Minson A. Powell K.L. J. Gen.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22766-22770Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The ability of ICP8 to participate in multiple protein-protein interactions suggests that it fulfills several roles during viral DNA replication. The interaction between ICP8 and UL9 protein greatly stimulates the rate and extent of DNA unwinding catalyzed by the UL9 protein, enabling it to unwind long stretches of DNA (9Boehmer P.E. Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1220-1225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Makhov A.M. Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 789-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It has been shown that disruption of the ICP8-UL9 protein complex by deletion of the 27 C-terminal amino acid of the UL9 protein greatly reduces origin-specific DNA replication (12Boehmer P.E. Craigie M.C. Stow N.D. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29329-29334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Presumably, the ICP8-UL9 protein complex promotes efficient unwinding of the HSV-1 origins of DNA replication (20Makhov A.M. Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1742-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21Lee S.S.-K. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2838-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This study examines the mechanism by which ICP8 stimulates the DNA helicase and ATPase activities of the UL9 protein. The results show that ICP8 increases the processivity of the UL9 protein, facilitating its translocation along DNA and through regions of secondary structure. DISCUSSIONThe aim of this study was to identify the mechanism by which the HSV-1 SSB, ICP8, stimulates the DNA helicase and DNA-dependent ATPase activities of the HSV-1 origin-binding protein (UL9 protein).The results show that subsaturating concentrations of ICP8 were sufficient to stimulate the DNA helicase activity of the UL9 protein, and that maximal stimulation occurred at an ICP8 to UL9 protein ratio of 1:1. This observation is consistent with the existence of a specific ICP8-UL9 protein complex that translocates along the DNA and is active during DNA unwinding. In addition, the stoichiometry of 1:1 inferred from the functional interaction between ICP8 and UL9 protein is identical to that observed for the physical complex (13Gustafsson C.M. Falkenberg M. Simonsson S. Valadi H. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19028-19034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).ICP8 also stimulated the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of the UL9 protein in a species-specific manner. A heterologous SSB, E-SSB, led to inhibition of activity, presumably by preventing access of the UL9 protein to the DNA substrate. Furthermore, ICP8 partially reversed the inhibitory effect of E-SSB. These observations are indicative of a specific tertiary complex that consists of UL9 protein, ICP8, and ssDNA.Interestingly, the stimulatory effect of ICP8 on the DNA helicase and DNA-dependent ATPase activities of the UL9 protein was dependent on the ICP8/nucleotide ratio. Maximal stimulation was observed at subsaturating concentrations of ICP8, whereas coating concentrations produced less of an effect. Assuming that the level of stimulation correlates with the physical association of ICP8 and UL9 protein, these results suggest that the ICP8-UL9 protein complex is less stable at high ICP8/nucleotide ratios. This finding may explain why Gustafsson et al. (13Gustafsson C.M. Falkenberg M. Simonsson S. Valadi H. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19028-19034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) failed to detect a physical complex of UL9 protein, ICP8, and ssDNA at high ICP8/nucleotide ratios. It is possible that, when ICP8 is in excess and all ssDNA sites are occupied, ICP8 undergoes a conformational change and loses its affinity for UL9 protein.The existence of a lag in the initial phase of the DNA unwinding reaction catalyzed by the UL9 protein suggests that the rate-limiting step is its association with the DNA substrate. This conclusion is substantiated by the observation that the lag was eliminated by preincubating the UL9 protein and DNA substrate. Moreover, rapid and maximal stimulation of DNA unwinding by ICP8 was only observed when UL9 protein was preincubated with DNA substrate or with ongoing DNA helicase reactions. Consequently, ICP8 exerts its maximal effect on a preassembled UL9 protein-DNA complex.The observation that ICP8 had no effect on the DNA-independent ATPase activity of the UL9 protein suggests that it does not directly affect the catalytic site of the UL9 protein. Therefore, experiments were designed to examine how ICP8 influences the interaction of the UL9 protein with its DNA substrate during DNA unwinding and DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis. Both activities entail translocation of the UL9 protein along ssDNA and through regions of duplex DNA. Consequently, these experiments addressed how ICP8 affects the translocation of UL9 protein along DNA.Addition of excess challenger DNA to ongoing DNA unwinding reactions showed that UL9 protein was effectively competed from the DNA substrate, implying that it dissociates rapidly from the DNA substrate and that it is nonprocessive. The inhibitory effect of the competitor DNA was eliminated by ICP8. Specifically, equimolar, subsaturating concentrations of ICP8 added immediately prior to competitor DNA prevented the effect of the challenger DNA. These results suggest that ICP8 prevents the dissociation of UL9 protein from the DNA substrate and therefore increases its processivity. Further evidence for the processivity enhancing function of ICP8 is provided by previous experiments in which ICP8 enabled the UL9 protein to unwind long regions of DNA (up to ∼3 kilobase pairs) (9Boehmer P.E. Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1220-1225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Makhov A.M. Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 789-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).(dT)15 is sufficient to elicit the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of the UL9 protein (8Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1213-1219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Presumably, this cofactor is sufficiently long to allow the UL9 protein to bind but is too short to allow translocation of the UL9 protein along the DNA. The extent of ATP hydrolysis seen with this cofactor should therefore be representative of UL9 protein binding only. Consistent with the assumption that ICP8 increases the processivity of the UL9 protein, there was no effect of ICP8 on the rate of ATP hydrolysis with (dT)15. In contrast, ATP hydrolysis with longer DNA cofactors, which allow both binding and translocation of the UL9 protein, was greatly stimulated by ICP8. Furthermore, ICP8 had an even greater stimulatory effect on ATP hydrolysis with DNA cofactors that contain secondary structure.In conclusion, the ability of ICP8 to prevent competition with challenger DNA during DNA unwinding, and to stimulate ATP hydrolysis with DNA cofactors that allow translocation, implies that it prevents dissociation of the UL9 protein from the DNA substrate and increases its processivity. In addition, ICP8 appears to facilitate translocation of the UL9 protein through regions of duplex DNA. This is probably a manifestation of the helix-destabilizing activity of ICP8 (24Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 711-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 9 shows a model of how ICP8 stimulates the translocation of the UL9 protein along ssDNA and through regions of duplex DNA.

One molecule of ICP8 is bound to the C terminus of each UL9 protein molecule (11Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8444-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar,12Boehmer P.E. Craigie M.C. Stow N.D. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29329-29334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), allowing one ICP8 molecule to bind the template strand, tethering the UL9 protein to the DNA substrate, while the second molecule of ICP8 assimilates and stabilizes the unwound primer strand, thereby facilitating the translocation of the UL9 protein through regions of duplex DNA.Previous studies have shown that a site-specific cisplatin lesion impairs the DNA helicase activity of the UL9 protein (22Villani G. Pillaire M.J. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21676-21681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was shown that ICP8 relieved the inhibitory effect imposed by the lesion. Based on the findings in this study, it is likely that ICP8 enables the UL9 protein to bypass the lesion by tethering it to the DNA substrate, thereby preventing its dissociation.The effects of cognate and noncognate SSBs have been documented for numerous DNA helicases (reviewed in Refs. 26Kornberg A.

Further evidence for the processivity enhancing function of ICP8 is provided by previous experiments in which ICP8 enabled the UL9 protein to unwind long regions of DNA (up to ∼3 kilobase pairs) (9Boehmer P.E. Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1220-1225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Makhov A.M. Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 789-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). (dT)15 is sufficient to elicit the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of the UL9 protein (8Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1213-1219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Presumably, this cofactor is sufficiently long to allow the UL9 protein to bind but is too short to allow translocation of the UL9 protein along the DNA. The extent of ATP hydrolysis seen with this cofactor should therefore be representative of UL9 protein binding only. Consistent with the assumption that ICP8 increases the processivity of the UL9 protein, there was no effect of ICP8 on the rate of ATP hydrolysis with (dT)15. In contrast, ATP hydrolysis with longer DNA cofactors, which allow both binding and translocation of the UL9 protein, was greatly stimulated by ICP8. Furthermore, ICP8 had an even greater stimulatory effect on ATP hydrolysis with DNA cofactors that contain secondary structure. In conclusion, the ability of ICP8 to prevent competition with challenger DNA during DNA unwinding, and to stimulate ATP hydrolysis with DNA cofactors that allow translocation, implies that it prevents dissociation of the UL9 protein from the DNA substrate and increases its processivity. In addition, ICP8 appears to facilitate translocation of the UL9 protein through regions of duplex DNA. This is probably a manifestation of the helix-destabilizing activity of ICP8 (24Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 711-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 9 shows a model of how ICP8 stimulates the translocation of the UL9 protein along ssDNA and through regions of duplex DNA.

Chem. 1994; 269: 29329-29334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), allowing one ICP8 molecule to bind the template strand, tethering the UL9 protein to the DNA substrate, while the second molecule of ICP8 assimilates and stabilizes the unwound primer strand, thereby facilitating the translocation of the UL9 protein through regions of duplex DNA. Previous studies have shown that a site-specific cisplatin lesion impairs the DNA helicase activity of the UL9 protein (22Villani G. Pillaire M.J. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21676-21681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was shown that ICP8 relieved the inhibitory effect imposed by the lesion. Based on the findings in this study, it is likely that ICP8 enables the UL9 protein to bypass the lesion by tethering it to the DNA substrate, thereby preventing its dissociation. The effects of cognate and noncognate SSBs have been documented for numerous DNA helicases (reviewed in Refs. 26Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. W. H.

In most cases, SSBs have been shown to enhance DNA unwinding by preventing nonproductive binding of the DNA helicase to the DNA substrate. Specific protein-protein interactions between DNA helicases and cognate SSBs have also been shown to increase the length of DNA unwound. However, no previous studies have addressed the exact mechanism by which an SSB stimulates DNA unwinding. Previous studies have indicated the importance of the ICP8-UL9 protein interaction for HSV-1 origin-specific DNA replication (12Boehmer P.E. Craigie M.C. Stow N.D. Lehman I.R. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2078733277,"Interaction of high-power laser light with materials often causes irreversible damage of the near-surface region. It is shown that copper single-crystal surfaces can be patterned by laser light. Irradiation with green light produced adatoms and vacancies, which self-organized into nanoscale pyramids. This restructuring can be removed by annealing. In contrast to green light, infrared laser irradiation at equivalent absorbed energy density did not produce any structural change. This, for metallic systems, unforeseen spectral difference in laser light action points to a concerted process as the source for structural modification, which involves long-lived primary excitation of localized d-electrons through interband transition together with phonon excitation."
https://openalex.org/W2084374535,"ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are ∼20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins recognized as critical components in intracellular vesicular transport and phospholipase D activation. Both guanine nucleotide-exchange proteins and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for ARFs have been cloned recently. A zinc finger motif near the amino terminus of the ARF1 GAP was required for stimulation of GTP hydrolysis. ARD1 is an ARF family member that differs from other ARFs by the presence of a 46-kDa amino-terminal extension. We had reported that the ARF domain of ARD1 binds specifically GDP and GTP and that the amino-terminal extension acts as a GAP for the ARF domain of ARD1 but not for ARF proteins. The GAP domain of ARD1, synthesized inEscherichia coli, stimulated hydrolysis of GTP bound to the ARF domain of ARD1. Using ARD1 truncations, it appears that amino acids 101–190 are critical for GAP activity, whereas residues 190–333 are involved in physical interaction between the two domains of ARD1 and are required for GTP hydrolysis. The GAP function of the amino-terminal extension of ARD1 required two arginines, an intact zinc finger motif, and a group of residues which resembles a sequence present in Rho/Rac GAPs. Interaction between the two domains of ARD1 required two negatively charged residues (Asp427 and Glu428) located in the effector region of the ARF domain and two basic amino acids (Arg249 and Lys250) found in the amino-terminal extension.

ARFs are ∼20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins), initially identified by their ability to stimulate cholera toxin ADP-ribosyltransferase activity (CTA) and later recognized as critical components in vesicular trafficking involving endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, endosomes, and nuclear envelope (for review, see Ref. 2Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12327-12330Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). ARF1 acts as a key regulator of the interactions of non-clathrin coat protein (coatomer) with Golgi stacks (3Donaldson J.G. Cassel D. Kahn R.A. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The deduced amino acid sequence of ARF1 GAP from rat liver has a zinc finger motif near the amino terminus, which was required for GAP activity (11Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The GAP appeared to be recruited to the Golgi by an ARF1-dependent mechanism (11Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Although the roles of G proteins are extremely diverse, they all operate by a fundamentally similar mechanism (13Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar). When GTP occupies the guanine nucleotide-binding site, the G protein can interact with and modify the activity of a downstream target protein. Hydrolysis of GTP causes dissociation of the G protein-target complex and terminates the “active state” of the G protein. Cells regulate the ratio of active and inactive G proteins by modulating the rates of GDP release and GTP hydrolysis (GTPase activity). It was reported that dissociation of GDP from the ARF domain of ARD1 was faster than from ARD1 itself (14Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1941-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Using ARD1 truncations, the 15 amino acids immediately preceding the ARF domain were shown to be responsible for decreasing the rate of GDP, but not GTP, dissociation (15Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25077-25082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). By site-specific mutagenesis it was shown that hydrophobic residues in this region were particularly important in stabilizing the GDP-bound form of ARD1. Therefore, it was suggested that, like the amino-terminal segment of ARF, the equivalent region of ARD1 may act as a GDP dissociation inhibitor. Until recently, it was believed that GTP hydrolysis by monomeric G proteins was stimulated by separate GAPs, whereas the presence of an intrinsic GAP-like domain in Gα was responsible for GTPase activity in the heterotrimeric G proteins (16Markby D.W. Onrust R. Bourne H.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1895-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Some effector proteins that are regulated by heterotrimeric G proteins also act as GAPs for their G protein regulators. The GAP activities of the effectors, such as phospholipase C-β (17Berstein G. Blank J.L. Jhon D.-H. Exton J.H. Rhee S.G. Ross E.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 411-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) and the cGMP phosphodiesterase γ subunit (18Arshavsky V.Y. Bownds M.D. Nature. 1992; 357: 416-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), may allow effector-specific modulation of responses. A relatively new class of GAPs for heterotrimeric G proteins includes the RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) family (19Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). They can contribute to desensitization induced by a prolonged signal or act as long term attenuators of signal amplitude, presumably by stimulating GTP hydrolysis (for review, see Ref. 20Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3871-3874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). ARFs are ∼20-kDa proteins that exhibit no detectable GTPase activity (21Kahn R.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7906-7911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like ARFs, the 18-kDa ARF domain (p3) of the 64-kDa ARD1 binds specifically GDP and GTP and lacks detectable GTPase activity (22Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3897-3904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Using recombinant proteins, it was shown that the 46-kDa amino-terminal domain of ARD1 (p5) stimulates hydrolysis of GTP bound to p3, and consequently it appears to be the GAP component of this bifunctional protein (14Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1941-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The stimulatory effect of the p5 domain on the GTPase activity of p3 was specific, as GTP hydrolysis by other members of the ARF family was not increased (12Ding M. Vitale N. Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24005-24009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Based on these and prior data on ARD1 (14Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25077-25082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), it appeared that p5 may control GTP hydrolysis as well as GDP dissociation. We reported that functional and physical interactions between p3 and p5 required two negatively charged amino acids in the “effector” region of p3 (22Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3897-3904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We report here that these residues probably interact with two positively charged amino acids in the amino-terminal extension (p5). Using affinity-purified antibodies and truncated mutants of ARD1, we show here that the amino terminus of ARD1 is not required for these interactions. By site-specific mutagenesis, we demonstrate further that in p5 an intact zinc finger motif, two arginines, and a sequence that resembles a consensus motif present in Rho/Rac GAPs are required for GAP activity.

Proteins were purified further by gel filtration through Ultrogel AcA 54 and then Ultrogel AcA 34 before storage in small portions at −20 °C. Purity, estimated by silver staining after SDS-PAGE, was >98%. Amounts of purified proteins were estimated by a dye-binding assay (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) and by SDS-PAGE using bovine serum albumin as standard. ARF1(39–45p3) was synthesized as published (22Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3897-3904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Fragments of ARD1 with deletions at the 5′-end (EMBL Data Bank 1993, Accession Number L04510) from pGEX5G/LIC (1Mishima K. Tsuchiya M. Nightingale M.S. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8801-8807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the forward primers 5′-GATTCAGGTGTCCCGCGGATGAAA-3′, 5′-TGTCAAACTAGCCCGCGGATGTCG-3′, 5′-GAAACTCTGTGTCGTCAACCGCGGATGGCT-3′, 5′-AATCAGTTGGATGCCCCGCGGATGGTCACTTTTACAAAG-3′ (differences from the original clones are underlined), and the reverse primer 5′-GAATTCCCGGGGATCCAACTGCG-3′ (italicized sequence is a BamHI restriction site). The forward primers introduced a SacII restriction site (italicized sequences) and/or an initiation codon in-frame (bold sequences) in the deleted fragments yielding, respectively, NΔ88p8, NΔ200p8, NΔ304p8, and NΔ387p8. The polymerase chain reaction fragments were digested with SacII and BamHI for 1 h at 37 °C, extracted from LM-agarose gels, and purified by phenol/chloroform precipitation. The resulting fragments were then ligated in-frame to the SacII- and BamHI-digested pGEX5G/LIC expression vector. Ultra competent cells (Stratagene) were transformed with the plasmids pGEX5G/LIC/NΔ88p8, pGEX5G/LIC/NΔ200p8, pGEX5G/LIC/NΔ304p8, and pGEX5G/LIC/NΔ387p8. Entire sequences of the ARD1 deletion constructs were confirmed by automated sequencing (Applied Biosystems, 373 DNA Sequencer) using the primers 5′-TTATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′, 5′-AGCTGCAGAAGAATCCATT-3′, 5′-ATCAATTTTAGATATGGCT-3′, 5′-ATGATTGTAGAGTTGTCTT-3′, 5′-TTATTACCTCAATACTCAA-3′, and 5′-GCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGG-3′. Mutant ARD1 fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described for the non-mutant ARD1 proteins. For site-directed mutagenesis of p5, a modification of the unique site-elimination mutagenesis procedure of Deng and Nickoloff (26Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) was used. 25 pmol of a 5′-phosphorylated selection primer and 25 pmol of a 5′-phosphorylated mutagenic primer were annealed simultaneously to 750 ng of p5-pGEX5G/LIC in 20 ml of 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm potassium acetate by heating for 5 min at 100 °C and cooling 5 min on ice, followed by incubation at room temperature for 30 min. The selection primer 5′-CTGTGACTGGTGACGCGTCAACCAAGTC-3′ changed aScaI restriction site in the Ampr gene of pT7 into a MluI restriction site (underlined). Mutagenic primers (see Fig. 6 and Tables Table I, Table II, Table III) introduced the desired mutations. Primers were extended with T7 DNA polymerase, and the new strands were ligated with T4 DNA ligase for 1 h at 37 °C (final volume 30 μl). Plasmids were then digested for 2 h at 37 °C with 20 units of ScaI (final volume 60 μl). 4-μl samples were used to transform 90 ml of Epicurian Coli XL1-Bluecompetent cells (Stratagene). Plasmids were purified with Miniprep Wizard (Promega) from bacteria grown overnight in 2 ml of 2 × YT broth with ampicillin, 100 mg/ml. Samples (500 ng) of the plasmids were digested with 20 units of ScaI for 3 h at 37 °C. 4-μl samples were used to transform 40 μl of XLmutS-competent cells (Stratagene). Colonies were screened selectively by digestion withMluI, and the presence of the mutations was confirmed by automated sequencing (Applied Biosystems, 373 DNA Sequencer) using the primers 5′-TTATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′, 5′-ATGATTGTAGAGTTGTCTT-3′, and 5′-GCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGG-3′. Large scale production of mutated p5 proteins was carried out as described for ARD1. High performance liquid chromatography-purified (>95% pure) synthetic peptides (rARF1p, KLKLGEIVTTIPT; p3p, KLKQDEFMQPIPT; p5p, SDYSRKLVGIVQ; p5 random (p5Rp), LSKIGVRDVYSQ; Nt-ARD1, ATLVVNKLGAG; Ct-ARD1, QLVAAGVLDVA) were purchased from Bio-Synthesis, Inc. (Lewisville, TX). Mass spectral analysis, amino acid analysis, and peptide sequencing were performed on each peptide. Peptides were dissolved in water at a final concentration of 10 mg/ml. Antibodies against the NH2-terminal and the COOH-terminal sequence of ARD1 were prepared by injecting into rabbits either ATLVVNKLGAG (Nt-ARD1) or QLVAAGVLDVA (Ct-ARD1) coupled to hemocyanin (27Vitale N. Mukai H. Rouot B. Thiersé D. Aunis D. Bader M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14715-14723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After (NH4)2SO4precipitation, dialyzed IgG from serum of rabbits immunized with the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ARD1 peptides was purified on protein A-Sepharose G (Pierce) and then affinity purified on Affi-Gel 15 or Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) coupled to Nt-ARD1 and Ct-ARD1, respectively (28Vitale N. Gensse M. Chasserot-Golaz S. Aunis D. Bader M.-F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 1275-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Specific antibodies were eluted in 12 ml of 0.2 mglycine, pH 2.7, 10% ethylene glycol, and the pH was adjusted immediately to 7.5 with 1 n NaOH. After dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline, antibodies were concentrated (Centricon 50) and stored at −80 °C in 30% glycerol. Antibodies against p3 and p5 were prepared by injecting purified recombinant fusion proteins (GST-p3 or GST-p5) into rabbits. After (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, dialyzed IgG was purified on protein A-Sepharose G, and antibodies against GST were removed on a GST-glutathione-Sepharose column. The p3 and p5 antibodies were affinity purified on GST-p3- and GST-p5-glutathione-Sepharose columns, respectively, and stored as described above. Preimmune sera (diluted at 1/1,000) did not react detectably with 1 μg of ARD1 by Western blotting. Typically, the affinity-purified Nt-ARD1, Ct-ARD1, p3, and p5 polyclonal antibodies, at dilutions of 1/200,000 (∼3.3 ng), 1/200,000 (2.4 ng), 1/5,000 (82 ng), and 1/10,000 (78 ng), respectively, detected ∼0.2 μg of ARD1 after transfer to nitrocellulose membrane. Nt-ARD1 and Ct-ARD1 antibodies did not react with any of the recombinant ARF proteins tested (rARF1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), and cross-reactivity between the amino- or carboxyl-terminal ARD1 and p3 or p5 antibodies was not detected. Samples were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 2.5 mm EDTA with bovine serum albumin, 0.3 mg/ml, and cardiolipin, 1 mg/ml, then for 40 min at 30 °C in the same medium with 0.5 μm [α-32P]GTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) and 10 mm MgCl2 (total volume 120 μl). After addition of p5 or mutant proteins (40 μl), incubation at room temperature was continued for 1 h (final volume 160 μl) before proteins with bound nucleotides were collected on nitrocellulose (23Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Haun R.S. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10820-10825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bound nucleotides were eluted in 250 μl of 2 mformic acid, of which 3–4-μl samples were analyzed by TLC on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates (14Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1941-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and 240 μl was used for radioassay to quantify total 32P-nucleotide. TLC plates were subjected to autoradiography at −80 °C for 18–28 h. Total amounts of labeled nucleotides (GTP + GDP) bound to p3, p8, or p3 after incubation with p5, whether quantified by radioassay of the formic acid solution, by counting total radioactivity on the filter, or by PhosphorImaging (Molecular Dynamics) after TLC, were not significantly different under any condition (14Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1941-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), except as mentioned. An increase in bound GDP was always correlated with a decrease in bound GTP (22Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3897-3904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). p3 or ARD1 was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 40 μl of 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 2.5 mm EDTA with bovine serum albumin, 0.3 mg/ml, and cardiolipin, 1 mg/ml, before addition of 20 μl of solution to yield final concentrations of 100 μm GTPγS or GTP and 10 mm MgCl2. Where indicated, p5 or mutant protein was then added for 30 min. Components needed to quantify ARD stimulation of cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylagmatine formation were then added in 70 μl to yield final concentrations of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 6 mmMgCl2, 20 mm dithiothreitol, ovalbumin, 0.3 mg/ml, 0.2 mm [adenine-14C]NAD (0.05 μCi), 20 mm agmatine, cardiolipin, 1 mg/ml, and 100 μm GTPγS or GTP with 0.5 μg of cholera toxin (29Tsai S.-C. Noda M. Adamik R. Chang P.P. Chen H.-C. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1768-1772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation at 30 °C for 1 h, samples (70 μl) were transferred to columns of AG 1-X2 equilibrated with water and eluted with five 1-ml volumes of water (29Tsai S.-C. Noda M. Adamik R. Chang P.P. Chen H.-C. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1768-1772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The eluate, containing [14C]ADP-ribosylagmatine, was collected for radioassay. Incubation of p3 or p5 with affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant p3 or p5, respectively, markedly reduced, in a concentration-dependent manner, the ability of p5 to stimulate hydrolysis of GTP bound to p3 (Fig. 1), whereas the antibodies did not affect GTP binding (data not shown). 30 μg of either antibody completely blocked p5-stimulated GTPase activity (Fig. 1), whereas up to 50 μg of an anti-GST antibody had no effect (data not shown). On the other hand, 30 μg of anti-p3 or anti-p5 antibodies reduced the intrinsic GTPase activity of ARD1 only 8.8 ± 1.2% and 9.6 ± 0.9%, respectively (data not shown). 30 μg of anti-p3 or anti-p5 antibodies reduced hydrolysis of GTP bound to p3 by only 26.5 ± 2.3% and 32.3 ± 1.9%, respectively, when added to p3 simultaneously with p5 (data not shown). These results indicated that anti-p3 or anti-p5 antibodies inhibited GTP hydrolysis more effectively when the two domains of ARD1 were present in separate proteins than when covalently linked in recombinant ARD1. Based on these data, the two antibodies may decrease GTP hydrolysis by decreasing the ability of the two domains to interact. To characterize more precisely the GAP and interaction sites on p3 and p5, we prepared two polyclonal antibodies against undecapeptides corresponding to the amino- and carboxyl-terminal sequences. The affinity-purified carboxyl-terminal antibody only slightly reduced (∼20%) the amount of GTP bound to p3 (data not shown), perhaps by affecting the structure of the GTP binding pocket of the ARF domain. 30 μg of carboxyl-terminal antibody reduced GTP hydrolysis by about 25% (Fig. 1), suggesting that when antibody was bound to p3, the affinity between the two domains of ARD1 was reduced, or the rate of GTP hydrolysis was decreased directly. 30 μg of the affinity-purified amino-terminal antibody affected neither GTP binding (data not shown) nor GTP hydrolysis (Fig. 1), suggesting that the amino terminus of p5 might not be involved in the GAP activity. We synthesized four mutants of ARD1 with amino-terminal deletion (Fig. 2 A) and used functional assays to monitor their conformational integrity. Binding of GTPγS to ARF requires a strict positioning of residues involved in the nucleotide binding pocket and is responsible for the conformational switch that activates ARF proteins. No significant differences in GTPγS binding among ARD1 and amino-terminal deleted mutants were observed (15Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25077-25082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The ARF domain of ARD1 (p3) exhibited no detectable GTPase activity (14Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1941-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), whereas 35–40% of GTP bound to ARD1 (p8) was hydrolyzed in 1 h at room temperature (Fig. 2 B). The ARD1 mutant lacking 88 amino acids at the amino terminus (NΔ88p8) retained GTPase activity (Fig. 2 B). Deletion of 200, 304, or 387 residues from the amino terminus completely prevented GTP hydrolysis (Fig. 2 B), whereas binding of [α-32P]GTP (Fig. 2 B) or [35S]GTPγS (15Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25077-25082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) was not affected. All members of the ARF family, in the presence of GTP or a nonhydrolyzable analog, serve as allosteric activators of CTA (2Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12327-12330Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 29Tsai S.-C. Noda M. Adamik R. Chang P.P. Chen H.-C. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1768-1772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The site of interaction with the toxin has been localized to the carboxyl-terminal region of ARF (30Hong J.-X. Haun R.S. Tsai S.-C. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9743-9745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hong J.-X. Zhang X. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Removal of up to 304 amino-terminal residues from ARD1 did not affect CTA activation, whereas removal of 387 amino acids reduced it by about 28% (15 and Fig. 2 C), suggesting that the sequence preceding the ARF domain contributes to its native conformation. Activation of CTA by p3 was similar to GTP and GTPγS, although, as we have reported (15Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25077-25082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), it was less than that by ARD1. As expected, stimulation of CTA by ARD1 (p8) was less with GTP than with GTPγS (Fig. 2 C), presumably because of its ability to hydrolyze GTP but not GTPγS. Similarly, the ability of NΔ88p8 to activate CTA in presence of GTP was much less than in presence of GTPγS (Fig. 2 C). Mutant proteins with larger deletions of the amino terminus activated CTA with the same potency in the presence of GTP and GTPγS (Fig. 2 C), consistent with an absence of significant GTPase activity. Four additional amino-terminal deletion mutants of ARD1 (p8) were synthesized to identify more precisely the GAP site in p5. In GTPγS binding and CTA activation, NΔ101p8, NΔ124p8, NΔ146p8, and NΔ161p8 did not differ significantly from p8 (data not shown). Removal of 101 amino acids from the amino-terminal end reduced GAP activity only 8.5 ± 2.6%, whereas removal of"

At low oxygen concentrations (<5 μm), a dramatic change in the regiospecificity of the enzyme was observed with the hydroperoxy-octadecadienoic acid (HPOD) 13:9 ratio closer to 50:50 instead of the generally reported 95:5. This alteration of regiospecificity is not an isolated phenomenon, since it occurs during a reaction carried out under “classical” conditions, i.e. in a buffer saturated with air before the reaction. β-carotene bleaching and electronic paramagnetic resonance findings provided evidence that substrate-derived free radical species are released from the enzyme. The kinetic scheme proposed by Schilstraet al. (Schilstra, M. J., Veldink, G. A. & Vliegenthart, J. F. G. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 3974–3979) was thus expanded to account for the observed variations in specificity. The equations describing the branched scheme show two different kinetic pathways: a fully enzymatic one leading to a regio-isomeric composition of 13-HPOD:9-HPOD = 95:5, and a semienzymatic one leading to a regio-isomeric composition of 13-HPOD:9-HPOD = 50:50. The ratio between the two different pathways depends on oxygen concentration, which thus determines the overall specificity of the reaction.

The ratio between the two different pathways depends on oxygen concentration, which thus determines the overall specificity of the reaction. Lipoxygenases (EC 1.13.11.12) are widely distributed in both the animal and plant kingdoms. They catalyze the dioxygenation of unsaturated fatty acids containing one or more (1Z,4Z)-pentadiene systems into the corresponding conjugated hydroperoxides. In animal tissues, the most frequently encountered substrate is arachidonic acid (C20:4), which is dioxygenated by lipoxygenases into precursors of products involved in inflammatory processes (2Samuelsson B. Science. 1987; 237: 1171-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1984) Google Scholar), cell membrane maturation (3Schewe T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 369-373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), or cancer metastasis (4Honn K.V. Tang D.G. Gao X. Butovitch I.A. Liu B. Timar J. Hagmann W. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 365-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The role of plant lipoxygenases, whose main substrates are linoleic (C18:2) and linolenic (C18:3) acids, is not yet fully elucidated, although they are implied in processes such as senescence or plant response to wounding (5Gardner H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1084: 221-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). A single non-heme iron is present in each enzyme and can exist in two oxidation states: Fe(II) and Fe(III) (6De Groot J. Veldink G. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Boldingh J. Wever R. Van Gelder B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 377: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). According to the current working mechanism (1Schilstra M.J. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3974-3979Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 6De Groot J. Veldink G. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Boldingh J. Wever R. Van Gelder B. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochem. 1987; 61: 93-100Google Scholar), the native enzyme, as obtained when purified, is inactive and in the Fe(II) form. When treated with an equimolar amount of product, the iron is oxidized to the Fe(III) form, resulting in an active enzyme. This ferric form can then catalyze the abstraction of a hydrogen from the bis-allylic carbon atom of the substrate (S) in a stereo-specific manner, yielding a pentadienyl radical (S⋅) complexed with the ferrous enzyme. Bimolecular oxygen is then added to the pentadienyl radical, either at the C-1 or the C-5 of the pentadiene system, which leads to the formation of the hydroperoxide product (P) and the reoxidation of the cofactor to the ferric form (see Scheme FS1, upper part). This cycling between the ferric and ferrous forms thus plays a crucial role in catalysis. The existence of product activation of the enzyme explains the lag time observed in kinetics occurring under certain conditions, especially with a high initial [Substrate]/[Product] ratio (1Schilstra M.J. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3974-3979Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). During the reaction, a small fraction of the complex formed by the ferrous enzyme and the pentadienyl radical can also dissociate, regenerating the inactive ferrous enzyme form. A steady-state level of Fe(II) enzyme is gradually approached. Moreover, the position at which dioxygen is inserted defines the regiospecificity of the enzyme. Under most conditions, soybean lipoxygenase-1 is highly specific for the insertion of dioxygen on the C-13 atom of linoleic acid (yielding 13-HPOD 1The abbreviations used are: HPOD, hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid; 13:9 ratio, ratio between the two regio-isomer products 13-HPOD and 9-HPOD, calculated with 9-HPOD(%) = [9-HPOD] × 100/([13-HPOD] + [9-HPOD]); LA, linoleic acid; OC, oxygen consumption phase; SP, pseudo-stationary phase; DP, headspace oxygen dissolution phase; P, fully enzymatically formed hydroperoxide product; Q, semienzymatically formed hydroperoxide product; S⋅, pentadienyl radical; SO·̄2, peroxyl radical; k1, k2, k4, monomolecular rate constants;k3, k5, k6, k7, bimolecular rate constants; KmS, KiS, KmP, KiP, equilibrium (dissociation) constants. ) or on the C-15 atom of arachidonic acid yielding 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (10Kühn H.

Commun. 1990; 170: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, this marked specificity can be modulated by certain factors especially pH (12Christopher J.P. Pistorius E.K. Regnier F.E. Axelrod B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 289: 81-87Google Scholar, 13Gardner H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1001: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) or substrate structure in the reaction medium (14Arai H. Nagao A. Terao J. Suzuki T. Takama K. Lipids. 1995; 30: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 15Schnurr K. Kühn H. Rapoport S.M. Schewe T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1254: 109-114Google Scholar). Almost every attempt to explain the observed variations in specificity has been based on modifications of the substrate (charge of the carboxylate group, for example) or of the enzyme. A kinetic model in which the position of dioxygen insertion proceeds through two different enzymatic pathways, the overall specificity being a function of the KM(O2) for each of the two pathways, has been proposed (16Nelson M.J. Cowling R.A. Seitz S.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4966-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, this model fails to explain the specificity modifications observed with varying pH. In the present study, we tried to determine and explain the influence of oxygen concentration on soybean lipoxygenase-1 specificity, in keeping with the current kinetic model. The oxygen concentration in a reaction medium at any given time is a function of two parameters: the initial oxygen concentration and the rate of oxygen consumption by the reaction itself. Thus we varied initial and continuous oxygenation conditions (N2, O2 or air bubbling). We also used sorbitol, a polyol which acts as soluble cosolvent. In previous studies, we have shown that such a cosolvent enhances the dioxygenation rate of soybean lipoxygenase-1 (17Pourplanche C. Lambert C. Berjot M. Marx J. Chopard C. Alix A. Larreta-Garde V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31585-31591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it also decreases oxygen concentration by altering its solubility. The dramatic specificity modifications observed here are discussed in terms of an expanded kinetic model. Soybean lipoxygenase-1 was purified according to the procedure of Axelrod et al.

From a nonlinear least squares fit at [LA] = 50–400 μmof v = (Vm × [LA])/(KM + [LA]), KM and Vm values of 39 and 144 μmmin−1, respectively, were determined with 9 nmenzyme, corresponding to akcat/KM value of 6.8 × 106m−1 s−1. Linoleic acid (Sigma, 99%) was stored at −20 °C as a 100 mm solution in 9 × 10−3nNaOH + 0.7% (v/v) Tween 20 (Sigma) and prepared at 4 °C under anaerobic conditions. The concentration of hydroperoxides in this solution was estimated to be less than 0.6% of the linoleic acid concentration, as obtained by measurement of absorbance at 234 nm (see below). 13-HPOD was prepared as described by Gibian et al. (20Gibian M.J. Gallaway R.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4209-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) but purified with a 0.7-ml C18 Sep-Pak® Cartridge (Waters Associates, Millipore) and eluted with methanol. The product was stored at −20 °C as a 10 mm solution in methanol. 3-(2-bromoacetamido)-PROXYL, free radical, was from Aldrich. β-Carotene (Sigma) was prepared as described in Ref. 21Zamora R. Macias P. Mesias J.L. Nahrung. 1988; 32: 965-969Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar and stored at −20 °C as a 0.23 mm stock solution, assuming ε460 nm = 1.39 × 105m−1 s−1 (22Ramadoss C.S. Pistorius E.K. Axelrod B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 190: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Dioxygenation reactions were performed at 25 °C in 0.1 mNa4P2O7, pH 9.0, buffer containing 3.2 × 10−3 % (v/v) Tween 20 and the desired substrate concentration. The buffer was saturated by bubbling with either air, O2, or N2. Oxygen concentration in the buffer was respectively 228, 1140, and <5 μm (Clark electrode detection limit). The reaction was followed either by a polarographic method suitable for measuring pO2variations even in buffers containing 2 m sorbitol (23Pourplanche C. Larreta-Garde V. Thomas D. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) or by a spectrophotometric method. pO2 measurements were made with a Clark electrode covered with a propylene membrane (Radiometer, Denmark) in a hermetic glass reaction vessel purchased from Tacussel. Reaction buffer volume was 20 ml. Spectrophotometric measurements were performed by following A234 nm, using an ε of 25,000m−1 cm−1. In both cases, the final soybean lipoxygenase-1 concentration was 9.3 nmunless otherwise specified. EPR spectra were obtained at room temperature using a Bruker EMX spectrometer with a Bruker ER041 XG Microwave Bridge (X-Band). Spectra were collected and analyzed on a personal computer using WinEPR software (Bruker). The conditions were as follows: microwave frequency, 9.79 GHz; microwave power, 10.06 milliwatts; modulation amplitude, 0.40 G; receiver gain, 6.32 × 103. 100 ml of 0.1 mNa4P2O7, pH 9.0, buffer containing 3.2 × 10−3 % (v/v) Tween 20; 29 μmspin label (3-(2-bromoacetamido)-PROXYL) and 625 μmlinoleic acid were saturated by bubbling with N2 for 30 min. The reaction was initiated by adding soybean lipoxygenase-1 (20 nm final concentration) and carried out under N2 bubbling. 100 ml of 0.1 mNa4P2O7, pH 9.0, buffer containing 3.2 × 10−3 % (v/v) Tween 20, the chosen substrate concentration, and 7.5 nm soybean lipoxygenase-1 were loaded with a Masterflex® pump (Cole-Parmer) at minimum flow on a tangential ultrafiltration device (Amicon H1P10–43). Retentate (>10 kDa, i.e. enzyme) was recycled into the substrate and buffer reactor, and filtrate (<10 kDa, i.e.substrate, product, and derived species) was directly flowed into a β-carotene solution circulating as a closed circuit into a spectrophotometer with a Gilson Minipuls 2 pump at maximal flow. Absorbance variations caused by β-carotene cooxidation or dilution were thus recorded continuously at 460 nm without contact between enzyme and β-carotene. Absorbance variations caused by dilution by the filtrate of the β-carotene solution were calculated asAdilution = (A0 ×V0)/(V0 + (X × t)) with A0, initial absorbance; V0, initial β-carotene volume (ml); and X, filtrate flow into the β-carotene tank (ml/min). Variations caused by β-carotene cooxidation were calculated as ΔAβ−car = Ameasured+ (A0 − Adilution). An isocratic, normal-phase high performance liquid chromatography method was applied using a μPorasil column (Waters, 3.9 × 300 mm). Elution solvent consisted of hexane/diethylether/acetic acid (980/20/1) (v/v). The injection volume was 20 μl with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Detection was performed at 234 nm with a Waters 481 Lambda-Max spectrophotometer. Numerical simulations and parameter estimations were performed with Matlab® software (Math Works Inc.) on a 670 MP Sun server (Division Mathematiques Appliquées, Université de Compiègne, France). The set of differential equations describing the time-dependent variations of the various species was integrated using a Gear algorithm, suitable for integrating stiff equations. Optimization of the parameter values was achieved by minimizing (spline method) a “cost” function, defined as the sum of the squared differences between experimental observations and model predictions. Both O2 and hydroperoxide time-dependent concentrations were recorded for each experiment (and simultaneously taken into account for the cost function calculation), except for experiments carried out under high hydroperoxide initial concentrations, where initial A234 nm values were too high to allow spectrophotometric assays. Nine experimental conditions differing in terms of initial product and substrate concentration were chosen. Soybean lipoxygenase-1 concentrations ranged from 7.7 to 8.0 nm, and the first minute of reaction was recorded. Each experiment was performed in triplicate.

The complete mathematical treatment of parameter estimations and numerical simulations is also available upon request to the authors. When initial oxygen concentrations are smaller than substrate concentrations, the reaction of soybean lipoxygenase-1 shows three distinct phases (Fig. 1): an oxygen consumption phase (OC) due to the enzymatic reaction, followed by a pseudo-stationary phase (SP) where apparent [O2] ≈ 0, and a headspace oxygen dissolution phase (DP). The last phase starts when the enzymatic reaction is finished and is due to the dissolution in the reaction medium of oxygen present in the headspace of the reaction vessel. At the end of the first phase OC (Table I, panel A), specificity is quite similar to that usually described (13-HPOD:9-HPOD = 95:5), but at the end of the pseudo-stationary phase (SP), the 9-HPOD percentage relative to ([9-HPOD] + [13-HPOD]) slightly increases (13-HPOD:9-HPOD = 89:11). This variation in specificity is more pronounced when 2m sorbitol is added to the buffer (13-HPOD:9-HPOD = 82:18 at the end of the SP, Table I, panel A).Table ISoybean lipoxygenase-1 specificity with air (panels A and B, [O2]initial = 228 μm) or oxygen (panel C, [O2]initial = 1140 μm) bubbling before the beginning of the reaction[O2][LA][Sorbitol]Reaction phase13:9 RatioμmmPanel A2283000OC95:50SP89:112OC94:62SP82:18Panel B2281902SP95:5Panel C11408000OC95:50SP95:52OC95:52SP96:4 Open table in a new tab When oxygen concentrations are not limiting relative to substrate concentrations (i.e. [O2]initial> [S]initial), this specificity variation is not observed (Table I, panels B and C). Under these conditions, specificity is independent of the reaction phase or the presence of sorbitol. Fig. 2 shows that the higher the [S]/[O2] ratio, the greater the change in specificity toward 9-HPOD formation at the end of the SP; under high oxygen concentrations (continuous oxygen bubbling throughout the reaction), the specificity is not altered (Fig. 2, □). Moreover, the specificity varies with substrate concentration; the 9-HPOD percentage increases with increasing linoleic acid concentrations (Fig. 2). Incubation of a 13-HPOD:9-HPOD mixture in an initial 95:5 ratio, without substrate and with or without enzyme, does not change the isomeric composition of the product (data not shown). Thus the regiospecificity modification is not caused by an enzyme-dependent or -independent isomerization of the product. Neither can it be due to linoleic acid autoxidation, since a 2-h incubation of buffer containing substrate but no enzyme failed to give rise to HPOD amounts comparable to those observed here (data not shown). Hence, the observed variation of specificity occurs when oxygen concentration is limiting relative to substrate. Assuming a stoichiometry of 1:1 during the OC phase between oxygen and substrate enzymatic consumption, some untransformed substrate remains at the beginning of the SP when [O2]initial < [S]initial. Thus, the specificity variation is related to the presence of residual substrate at the beginning of the second phase (SP). Furthermore, when N2 is flushed in the reactor headspace at the beginning of SP, this specificity variation is not observed (Fig. 3). This implies that the specificity alteration occurs when the conditions are not completely anaerobic during SP. During this phase, the apparent oxygen concentration represents the difference between the oxygen dissolution rate and the enzyme activity rate. As shown in Table II, except for pure oxygen bubbling in buffer, oxygen dissolution from the reactor headspace into the buffer is always slower than its consumption by the reaction, resulting in apparently null oxygen concentrations (Fig. 1). This implies that the oxygen concentration during the SP allows some dioxygenation to occur. In fact, oxygen concentration during the SP is actually stationary as the enzymatic reaction is not really over before the beginning of the DP. For this reason, the duration of the SP increases with substrate concentration (data not shown).Table IIInitial rates of oxygen dissolution and enzyme reaction in air- or oxygen-saturated buffer with or without 2 m sorbitol as determined by pO2 measurements (Clark electrode)Pure O2bubblingAir bubblingEnzyme reaction rateOxygen dissolution rateEnzyme reaction rateOxygen dissolution rateμmmin−10.1 m Pyrophosphate buffer2357051411300.1 m Pyrophosphate buffer + 2 m sorbitol2807716514 Open table in a new tab Table II also shows that oxygen dissolution rates are approximately 10 times lower when 2 m sorbitol is added to the buffer. As the enzymatic reaction rate with added sorbitol is higher (17Pourplanche C. Lambert C. Berjot M. Marx J. Chopard C. Alix A. Larreta-Garde V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31585-31591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the available oxygen concentration during the pseudo-stationary phase is decreased in the presence of this polyol. This would account for the greater specificity variation at the end of SP, when 2 msorbitol is added in the buffer. When the reaction buffer is bubbled with N2 before the reaction (i.e. [O2]initial < 5 μm), soybean lipoxygenase-1 catalyzes the oxygenation reaction with a specificity dramatically different from that observed with higher oxygen concentrations (Fig. 4); the enzyme produces almost equal amounts of 13- and 9-HPOD throughout the reaction course (13:9 ratio ≈ 55:45). This ratio is similar to that observed in the auto-oxidation reaction (24Frankel E.N. Prog. Lipid Res. 1980; 19: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Assuming that all the substrate has been transformed at the beginning of the headspace oxygen dissolution phase (DP) and that the substrate is transformed during the first phase (OC) with a 13:9 ratio = 95:5, the specificity occurring during the SP phase of a reaction initiated at oxygen concentrations limiting relative to substrate, has been estimated at (%9−HPOD)SP100={([S]i×((%9−HPOD)DP/100))−([O2]i×0.05)[S]i−[O2]i}Equation 1a where (%9-HPOD)SP is the calculated 9-HPOD percentage relative to ([13-HPOD] + [9-HPOD]) occurring during the pseudo-stationary phase SP; [S]i is the initial linoleic acid concentration; (%9-HPOD)DP is the 9-HPOD percentage relative to ([13-HPOD] + [9-HPOD]) observed at the beginning of the headspace oxygen dissolution phase DP (end of the reaction) [O2]i is the initial oxygen concentration. Fig. 5 shows that the calculated (%9-HPOD)SP, i.e. the calculated specificity occurring during the SP phase of a reaction initiated at limiting oxygen concentrations relative to substrate, is approximately the same as the 9-HPOD percentage observed during a reaction carried out under low initial oxygen concentration (Fig. 4). During SP, soybean lipoxygenase-1 would catalyze the dioxygenation reaction with a ratio ≈ 50:50. According to the most widely accepted mechanism (1Schilstra M.J. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3974-3979Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar,6De Groot J. Veldink G. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Boldingh J. Wever R. Van Gelder B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 377: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 7Ludwig P. Holzhütter H.G. Colosimo A. Silvestrini M.C. Schewe T. Rapoport S.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 61: 93-100Google Scholar), presented in the upper part of Scheme FS1, it has been hypothesized that the ES⋅ complex could dissociate instead of associating with O2, leading to regeneration of the ferrous enzyme (E). Together with this regeneration, a pentadienyl radical (S⋅) would be released in the reaction medium (1Schilstra M.J. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3974-3979Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 7Ludwig P. Holzhütter H.G. Colosimo A. Silvestrini M.C. Schewe T. Rapoport S.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 61: 93-100Google Scholar). This hypothesis has recently been strengthened by the demonstration that hydrogen abstraction from the substrate at the enzyme catalytic site occurs before molecular oxygen enters the reaction (25Glickman M.H. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12882-12892Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We thus sought the presence of a substrate-based free radical species, released from the enzyme at low oxygen concentration. The production of a free radical under low oxygen concentration has been demonstrated by EPR spectroscopy. The EPR spectrum of 29 μm spin label in the presence of linoleic acid in a buffer saturated by bubbling with N2 for 30 min is shown in Fig. 6 A. The reaction was initiated by adding soybean lipoxygenase-1 and carried out under N2 bubbling. After a 3 min reaction time, the spin label EPR signal has totally disappeared, as shown in Fig. 6 B. The EPR signal of the spin label is stable for more than 6 h in the same environment in the absence of enzyme (data not shown). The disappearance of the EPR signal can thus only be attributed to spin label silencing by an enzyme-produced free radical. This data shows that even at low oxygen concentrations (<5 μm), a radical species is formed by the enzyme. It also shows that during the soybean lipoxygenase-1 reaction, substrate deprotonation occurs before oxygen enters the reaction, in agreement with recently published data (25Glickman M.H. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12882-12892Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We also used β-carotene bleaching to detect the presence of a free radical dissociated from the enzyme. Soybean lipoxygenase-1 is known to catalyze cooxidation (bleaching) of β-carotene in the presence of linoleic acid (21Zamora R. Macias P. Mesias J.L. Nahrung. 1988; 32: 965-969Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar) resulting in a decrease in β-carotene absorbance at 460 nm. This bleaching is caused by soybean lipoxygenase-1-produced free radicals derived from substrate. To separate the enzyme from β-carotene and thus detect the release of free radical species by the enzyme, the reaction medium containing substrate and enzyme was pumped into a tangential ultrafiltration device. The retentate (enzyme) was recycled into the reaction vessel, and the filtrate (substrate, product, and derived species) was directly flowed into a β-carotene solution circulating as a closed circuit into a spectrophotometer. Thus lipoxygenase is never in contact with the pigment, the bleaching of which can only be ascribed to the presence of free radicals not bound to the enzyme (see “Experimental Procedures”). Under these conditions, Fig. 7 shows that at low oxygen concentrations (N2 bubbling), the absorbance variation is lower than that caused by β-carotene dilution, indicating the release by the enzyme of free radical species not detectable under higher oxygen concentrations (air bubbling) nor in the absence of enzyme at low oxygen concentrations (data not shown). According to the current working kinetic scheme proposed by Schilstra et al. (1Schilstra M.J. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3974-3979Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and presented in the upper part of Scheme FS1, soybean lipoxygenase-1 is obtained when purified as a ferrous form (E). This form is catalytically inactive but can bind substrate (S;e.g. linoleic acid), thus leading to the observed substrate inhibition. Upon binding a molecule of product (hydroperoxide), this ferrous form is activated to the ferric, catalytically active form (E*). This form is assumed to bind either product (leading to product inhibition) or substrate leading to an E*S complex. The enzyme-catalyzed substrate deprotonation then leads to a complex formed by ferrous enzyme and substrate free radical (probably pentadienyl), ES⋅. The position of this deprotonation is tightly regulated by the enzyme; with substrates presenting several pentadiene systems (e.g. arachidonic acid), one system is preferentially deprotonated depending on the enzyme isoform. The ES⋅ complex then binds O2, which is specifically added by the enzyme to either the C-1 or C-5 carbon of the pentadiene system. This regio- (and stereo-) specificity of enzyme-catalyzed O2 insertion is the basis of the enzyme specificity. In the case of soybean lipoxygenase-1, the specificity observed under nonlimiting oxygen concentrations relative to substrate (13:9 ratio = 95:5), reflects the specificity with which the enzyme catalyzes specifically the insertion of O2 on the C-13 carbon. In this case, both the position of substrate deprotonation and O2 insertion are enzyme controlled. This pathway will thus be referred to as “fully enzymatically” controlled. To explain the observed change in specificity at low oxygen concentrations, the current working kinetic model was expanded (Scheme FS1). This model is based on the model presented by (1Schilstra M.J. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3974-3979Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) but assumes that the ES⋅ complex can dissociate (as a function of the kinetic constant k4), leading to the release of a pentadienyl free radical S⋅ in the buffer (Scheme FS1, lower part). Our contribution to the model is to hypothesize that this highly reactive radical, once released, could combine with oxygen to form SO2·. This free radical, as in the classical pentadienyl system auto-oxidation scheme (26Gardner H.W. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1989; 7: 65-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 27Roginskii V.A. Mol. Biol. 1990; 24: 1262-1269Google Scholar), would then associate with either itself leading to termination products (e.g.linoleic acid dimers), or with a substrate molecule leading to S⋅ (which contributes to SO2· regeneration) and a hydroperoxide product, here designated as Q. During the formation of the hydroperoxide Q, only substrate deprotonation is enzyme controlled but not the O2 insertion step. Oxygen thus is added in a nonspecific manner, and the 13-HPOD:9-HPOD composition of Q is close to 50:50. This pathway to hydroperoxide production is therefore only “semienzymatically” controlled. P and Q are both linoleic acid hydroperoxides but show dif"

Recently in vivogalactose incorporation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been demonstrated through the expression of human β-1,4-galactosyltransferase in an alg1 mutant, suggesting the presence of a UDP-galactose transporter in S. cerevisiae (Schwientek, T., Narimatsu, H., and Ernst, J.

The complexN-linked oligosaccharides have a wide variety of structure in animal cells, while they are relatively simpler in lower eukaryotes, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, in both cases the initial steps are nearly identical and involve the synthesis of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-PP-dol, transfer of oligosaccharide from lipid to protein, and subsequent trimming to Man8GlcNAc2 in the endoplasmic reticulum. In the latter stage S. cerevisiae elongates it to polymannose-type structure without adding anyN-acetylglucosamine, galactose, and sialic acid residues that are characteristics of complex oligosaccharides in mammalian cells. Recently, interest in glycosyltransferases arose by their potential usefulness as tools for the synthesis of oligosaccharidesin vitro (5Ichikawa Y. Look G.C. Wong C.H. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 215-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and for the remodeling of glycan chains of natural or recombinant glycoproteins. Yeast offers an attractive host for the production of heterologous proteins (6Eckart M. Bussineau C.M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1996; 7: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and a number of recombinant glycoproteins were successfully produced in S. cerevisiae, although the sugars attached to proteins were confined to high mannose type. In this regard, the Δoch1mnn1 double mutant cells (7Nakayama K. Nagasu T. Shimma Y. Kuromitsu J. Jigami Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2511-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 8Nakanishi-Shindo Y.

Jigami Y. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) are novel to produce glycoproteins containingN-linked core oligosaccharide Man8GlcNAc2 and to reduce a yeast specific acidic oligosaccharide (mannosylphosphorylated Man8GlcNAc2) content, respectively. In addition, the MNN6 gene encoding mannosylphosphate transferase is useful to produce mannosylphosphorylated Man8GlcNAc2 (10Wang X.H. Nakayama K. Shimma Y. Tanaka A. Jigami Y. J. Biol.

However, we are interested in further attempts to make an in vivo sugar structure remodeling toward the mammalian type structure in S. cerevisiae. To achieve this goal we need to express a number of cDNA encoding mammalian glycosyltransferases and specific sugar nucleotide transporters with an authentic localization having correct topology in the lumen of the Golgi in appropriate yeast mutant cells that provide specific endogenous acceptors for the expressed gene product (glycosyltransferase). As an essential step for the above goal, it is necessary to clone UDP-Gal transporter gene in S. cerevisiae. However, recently, the in vivo galactose addition was demonstrated by expressing the genes of mammalian β-1,4-galactosyltransferase (GalT) 1The abbreviations used are: GalT, galactosyltransferase; GS I-B4, G. simplicifolia I lectin B4; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting. 1The abbreviations used are: GalT, galactosyltransferase; GS I-B4, G. simplicifolia I lectin B4; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting. in S. cerevisiae (alg1 mutant), which suggests the presence of unexpected UDP-Gal transporter, allowing β-1,4-GalT to act inside the lumen of the Golgi to add galactose onto endogenous acceptors under nonpermissive growth conditions (11Schwientek T. Narimatsu H. Ernst J.F. J. Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 3398-3405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). According to the hypothesis of a sugar nucleotide transport system in the Golgi apparatus, an antiporter for the corresponding sugar nucleotide must be present in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus, and in the case of UDP-Gal transport, UMP must be present to act as an antiporter (12Hirschberg C.B. Clapham D.E. Ehrlich B.E. Organeller Ion Channels and Transporters. Rockefeller University Press, New York1996: 105-120Google Scholar). A galactosyltransferase inside the lumen is necessary to transfer galactose from UDP-Gal to endogenous acceptors to produce UDP, which can be subsequently hydrolyzed to UMP by a UDPase. Since the presence of a UDPase is also demonstrated inS. cerevisiae without any apparent function (13Yanagisawa K. Resnick D. Abeijon C. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19351-19355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we are interested in checking the presence of the UDP-Gal transport system inS. cerevisiae by a direct transport assay. In this report we describe in vivo galactose addition to the endogenous mannoproteins under growing conditions in S. cerevisiae(mnn1 mutant) through the expression of the gene encodingS. pombe α-1,2-GalT, and provide direct evidence for the presence of a UDP-Gal transport system in S. cerevisiae byin vitro transport assay. It is quite surprising to us thatS. cerevisiae has UDP-Gal transport activity without any physiological need. At present it remains unsolved without further evidence that this transport activity is from a specific UDP-Gal transporter or other sugar nucleotide transporter having a broader substrate specificity. However, this finding is promising for the achievement of our goal for the incorporation of galactose residues into sugar chain of the glycoproteins in S. cerevisiae, when the appropriate acceptor glycans are provided. Materials were obtained as follows. UDP-Gal, GDP-GDP-Man, Hepes, concanavalin A-agarose, and Dowex 1X8-400 (Cl−) were from Sigma. Griffonia simplicifoliaI lectin B4 (GS I-B4) and GS I-B4-FITC were from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). CNBr-Sepharose 4B was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. GDP-[14C]mannose (251 mCi/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products. UDP-[3H]galactose (7.9 Ci/mmol) and carrier-free Na125I were obtained from Amersham Corp. Zymolyase-100T (Kirin Brewery Co.) was obtained from Seikagaku Kogyo Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) and “complete” (protease inhibitor mixture tablets) from Boehringer Mannheim (GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). IODO-BEADs and a BCA protein assay kit were obtained from Pierce. Filters and filtration apparatus were from Millipore Corp. (Bedford, MA). UDP, UMP, GDP, and GMP were from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Clear-sol scintillation mixture was from Nacalai Tesque, Inc. (Kyoto, Japan). All other reagents were of the highest purity commercially available. The S. cerevisiae strains used in this work are RA1-1B (MATαleu2 ura3 trp1 ade8 his3) (9Odani T. Shimma Y. Tanaka A. Jigami Y. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), LB1–3B(MAT a mnn2 SUC2 mal gal2 CUP1) (14Raschke W.C. Kern K.A. Antalis C. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4660-4666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and R16B (MAT a mnn1 leu2 ura3 trp1 ade8 his1 and/or his3 lys2). The last strain was a segregant of diploid between RA1-1B and YNS3-7A (MAT a och1::LEU2 mnn1 leu2 ura3 his1 and/or his3). 2Y. Shimma, unpublished results. the S. pombe strain used in this work is JY741 (h− ura4 leu1 ade6-M216) (15Iino Y. Yamamoto M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1985; 198: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The media for culture of yeast cells were essentially the same as described by Sherman et al. (16Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Laboratory Course Mannual for Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). YPD contains 1% Bacto-yeast extract (Difco), 2% Bacto-peptone (Difco), and 2% glucose. SC contains 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco), 2% glucose, 20 μg each of adenine sulfate, uracil, l-histidine hydrochloride, and l-tryptophan, and 30 μg each of l-leucine and l-lysine hydrochloride per ml. YPGal and SCGal were prepared by replacing 2% glucose of YPD and SC, respectively, with 5% galactose. SC-Ura and SCGal-Ura contain no uracil. Yeast transformation was performed by the lithium acetate method of Ito et al. (17Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Standard techniques for molecular cloning were adopted from those of Sambrook et al. (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Mannual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). PCR was carried out essentially as described by Saikiet al. (19Saiki, R. K., Gelfand, D. H., Stoffel, S. J., Higuchi, R., Horn, G. T., Mullis, K. B., and Erlich, H. A.Science, 239, 487–491.Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primers used for PCR were as follows: 5′-cccccctgcaggaattcATGCGGTTCGCTCCTTATTTA-3′ and 5′-cccccctcgagCTAGGATGATGGTTTCAAAAGA-3′, where capital letters indicate the region of gma12+ open reading frame (20Chappell T.G. Nasser Hajibagheri M.A. Ayscough K. Pierce M. Warren G Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). PCR was carried out using 0.1 μm of these primers and 10 ng of genomic DNA of S. pombe strain 972h− (kindly provided by Dr. Y. Yamamoto, University of Tokyo) as a template in the 20 μl reaction mixture. LATaq polymerase (Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan) was used for reactions. The reactions were performed in 30 cycles as follows. The samples were heated at 98 °C for 20 s, cooled at 54 °C for 1 min, and heated at 72 °C for 2 min. Plasmid pSK++gma12 carries a 1.1-kb EcoRI-XhoI fragment containinggma12+ open reading frame amplified by PCR. Plasmid YEpUGAP-gma12+ was constructed as follows. The 0.7-kb EcoRI-XhoI fragment of pSK++gma12 was inserted into plasmid pKT10 (21Tanaka K. Nakafuku M. Tamanoi F. Kaziro Y. Matsumoto K. Toh-e A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4303-4313Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) to make a plasmid pKT10+gma12C. Subsequently, the 0.4-kb EcoRI fragment of pSK++gma12 was inserted into the plasmid pKT10+gma12C to make YEpUGAP-gma12+. This plasmid carries the entire open reading frame of the gma12+ gene in pKT10, which contains URA3, the origin of the 2-μm plasmid and the TDH3 promoter of S. cerevisiae. This construction placed the gma12+ under the control of TDH3 promoter. Ten grams of freshly grown cells were washed with ice-cold water, resuspended in 10 ml of TMS buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.25 m sucrose). Cells were broken with 0.5-mm glass beads in a bead beater (B. Braun Biotech International, Melsungen, Germany). Glass beads, unbroken cells and large cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. The resultant supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was resuspended in TMS buffer to a protein concentration of 25 μg/ml and microsomes were disrupted and solubilized by the addition of Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 2% (v/v). After incubating on ice for 30 min, the mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 60 min in 70.1Ti Beckman ultracentrifuge rotor (Beckman ultracentrifuge, L-80 Optima). The supernatant was used as the source of solubilized enzyme for galactosyltransferase assay. The standard transferase assays were carried out according to Chappell and Warren (22Chappell T.G. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2693-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture in a total volume of 50 μl contained 100 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.0), 1 mm MnCl2with 25 nmol of UDP-[3H]Gal (specific activity, 40 nCi/nmol, after dilution of commercially available UDP-[3H]Gal with unlabeled UDP-Gal) and 5 μmol of given sugar acceptor. Reaction mixture contained 0.1–0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, depending on the detergent concentration in the enzyme fraction. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by adding 200 μl of ice-cold water and loaded onto a 1.0 ml of Dowex-1 (Cl− form, 200–400 dry mesh) anion exchange column packed in a 3-ml syringe. The column was washed twice with 1.0 ml of water and the combined eluents were mixed with 2.5 volumes of scintillation mixture. The Dowex columns were regenerated by washing 2.5 ml of 5m NaCl, 2.5 ml of 0.1 m HCl, and then 8.0 ml of water. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of 1.0 nmol of galactose from UDP-Gal/min under the standard assay conditions. The assay was done essentially as described by Abeijon et al. (23Abeijon C. Orlean P. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6935-6939Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Briefly, incubation mixture in a final volume of 0.1 ml contained enzyme (20 μg of Triton X-100 solubilized P3 fraction) (see “Subcellular Fractionations”), CaCl2 (1 μmol), Triton X-100 (100 μg), GDP (0.2 μmol), and immidazole buffer, pH 7.6 (20 μmol). Incubation was for 5 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of 10% (w/v) SDS. Released inorganic phosphate was determined by the Ames (24Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 115-118Crossref Scopus (3000) Google Scholar) method. The absorbance was measured at 820 nm and the amount of inorganic phosphate released was calculated from a calibration curve prepared by using KH2PO4 as a standard. One unit of activity was defined as 1 μmol of inorganic phosphate released per min under standard assay conditions. Specific activity is calculated as units/mg of protein. Latency of GDPase was calculated according to Abeijon et al. (23Abeijon C. Orlean P. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6935-6939Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The endoplasmic reticulum marker enzyme NADPH-dependent cytochrome c reductase was measured as described previously (25Kubota S. Yoshida Y. Kumaoka H. Furumichi A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1977; 81: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and cytochrome coxidase (mitochondrial marker enzyme) (26Mason T.L. Poyton R.O. Wharton D.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1346-1354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and α-mannosidase (vacuolar marker enzyme) (27Roberts, C. J., Raymond, C. K., Yamashiro, C. T., and Stevens T. H. Methods Enzymol., 194, 644–661.Google Scholar) were assayed as described. The protein concentration was measured by BCA reagent (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. GS I-B4 was coupled with CNBr activated Sepharose 4B according to Roy et al. (28Roy S.K. Raha S.K. Dey S.K. Chakrabarty S.L. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1989; 11: 431-435Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Five hundred milligrams of CNBr-Sepharose 4B were swollen for 1 h and washed on a sintered glass (G3) with 1 mm HCl. Five hundred milligrams of pure lectin (GS I-B4) were used in NaHCO3 buffer (10 mm, pH 8.3) containing NaCl (0.5 m), mixed with the gel, and kept overnight at 4 °C. For blocking the remaining active groups, the gel suspension was transferred to blocking agent, 0.2 m glycine (pH 8.0). To wash away excess unbound adsorbed proteins, the gel was alternatively washed three or four times with high pH coupling buffer (pH 8.3) and then low pH Na-acetate buffer (pH 4.2), each containing 0.5 m NaCl. This ensured that no free ligand remained ionically bound to the immobilized ligand. The Golgi-rich fractions were isolated as described by Walworth and Novick (29Walworth N.C. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, cells were grown at 30 °C in an appropriate medium to an A600 3.0–3.5. The cells were washed with 10 mm NaN3 and resuspended in the spheroplast buffer (1.4 m Sorbitol, 50 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaN3, 40 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and zymolyase 100T, 1 mg/g of wet cells). The cell suspension in spheroplast buffer was incubated at 37 °C for 45 min with occasional gentle mixing. The spheroplasts were pelleted in a table top centrifuge (Beckman, GS 6KR), and washed twice with 1.0 m ice-cold sorbitol to remove zymolyase. The cells were then suspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.8 mSorbitol in 10 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.2, and anti-protease mixture). The spheroplasts were transferred to a 50-ml Dounce homogenizer (Wheaton Scientific, Millville, NJ) on ice and lysed with 20 strokes of a Teflon pastel. Low speed centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min yielded a large pellet containing unlysed cells and cell wall debris. The post 1,000 × gsupernatant (S1) was carefully collected and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C (Hitachi, Himac SCR20B, Japan), which yielded a pellet (P2) of nuclear and mitochondrial fraction. The post mitochondrial supernatant (S2) was then centrifuged at 100,000 ×g (Beckman ultracentrifuge L-80 Optima, in 70.1Ti rotor) yielded a pellet (P3) of Golgi-enriched fraction and the cytosolic supernatant (S3). Yeast cells were grown in an appropriate medium and harvested at 3,000 rpm and washed with 10 mm NaN3 and 10 mm dithiothreitol, suspended in LIP buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA). Cells were disrupted by glass beads by vortexing (at full power 4 × 1 min) and centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and the clear supernatant were isolated. The total cellular proteins were precipitated by adding an equal volume of 7% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid to the supernatant and kept on ice for at least 1 h. The precipitated proteins were isolated by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 45 min at 4 °C, washed twice with cold acetone, and reisolated by centrifugation. Isolated proteins were dissolved in iodination buffer (100 mm Na-phosphate buffer, pH 7.0). Proteins were iodinated by IODO-BEADs according to the manufacturer's instructions. The iodination reaction was started by adding Na125I (200 μCi) and two IODO-BEADs to 500 μg of protein, dialyzed, and dissolved in 0.1 m Na-phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The iodination reaction was terminated by removal of IODO-BEADs, and the iodinated proteins were dialyzed extensively against water and then PBS to remove free iodine. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was conducted under reducing conditions as described previously (30Mudgapalli A. Roy S.K. Holmes E.H. Vijay I.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11327-11336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gels were run in the presence of prestained SDS-PAGE standards (Bio-Rad): myosin (Mr199,000), β-galactosidase (Mr 120,000), bovine serum albumin (Mr 87,000), and ovalbumin (Mr 48,000). Lectin precipitation was performed according to Schwientek et al. (11Schwientek T. Narimatsu H. Ernst J.F. J. Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 3398-3405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In short, 25 μl of 30% (w/v) concanavalin A-agarose 4B and 35 μl of 50% (w/v) of GS I-B4-agarose was added to 100 μg of iodinated whole cell proteins in PBS to precipitate mannoproteins and galactomannoproteins, respectively. The precipitated pellet was washed twice with PBS, solubilized with Laemmili (31Laemmili U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) solubilization buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. The gels were fixed, dried, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film at −70 °C for 12 h. Yeast cells were stained with FITC-conjugated GS I-B4 as follows. Freshly grown cells (2 × 106) of various strains were washed in PBS and taken in 50 μl of PBS. GS I-B4-FITC (2.5 μl, 1.0 mg/ml) was added and incubated on ice for 30 min in dark. After incubation the cells were washed three times with 200 μl of PBS, resuspended in 10–15 μl of PBS, and observed under fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX50, Japan). The samples were prepared same as described above using same lectin. The cells were sorted in a fluorescent cell sorter (Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur). The positive cells were isolated and concentrated in a “built-in” cell concentrater. Mannans were isolated according to Peat et al. (32Peat S. Whelan W.J. Edwards T.E. J. Chem. Soc. 1961; : 29-34Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar) with modifications. Freshly grown yeast cells were isolated by centrifugation, washed with 1% (w/v) KCl, and resuspended in 20 mm citrate buffer (pH 7.0). The cell suspension was then heated in an autoclave at 120 °C for 1 h. Supernatant was isolated by centrifugation, and 2 volumes of ethanol were added. The crude mannan was precipitated by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 20 min). The precipitated mannan was then dissolved and dialyzed against distilled water with two changes. Protein concentrations were estimated and used as acceptor substrates for galactosyltransferase assay. Sugar nucleotide transport was assayed according to Ma et al. (33Ma D. Russell D.G. Beverley S.M. Turco S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3799-3805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Golgi-enriched vesicles (500 μg of protein) were incubated in a reaction mixture (20 mm Tris-Cl, 0.25 msucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmMnCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) with radiolabeled sugar nucleotides (as indicated in the figure legends). After incubation at 30 °C for 5 min, the samples were diluted with 3.0 ml of ice-cold stop buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, 0.25m sucrose, 150 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2) and placed on ice. Diluted samples were then applied onto filtration apparatus containing HA filters (24-mm diameter, 0.45-μm pore size). The filters were washed with another 10 ml of wash buffer. The filters were air-dried and placed in 15-ml counting vials, and 2 ml of ethylene glycol methyl ether were added. The vials were allowed to stand at room temperature with occasional shaking until the filters were dissolved (about 30 min). Ten milliliters of scintillation mixture (Clear-sol) were added, and the samples were counted in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS1701). The amount of radioactivity that was bound nonspecifically to the outside of the vesicles was determined by zero time assay. gma12+ gene encoding α-1,2-GalT of S. pombe was expressed in S. cerevisiae cells. Plasmid YEpUGAP-gma12+ carriesgma12+ gene under the control of the S. cerevisiae TDH3 promoter. YEpUGAP-gma12+ and control plasmid pKT10 were introduced into S. cerevisiae R16Bmnn1 mutant cells (the choice of this mutant is further described under “Discussion”). GalT activity in solubilized microsomal fractions from these transformant cells was assayed using α-methyl d-mannoside as an acceptor substrate (Table I). The enzyme preparation from transformed cells expressing gma12+ gene showed a higher specific activity toward galactose transfer than the control counterpart cells. This GalT activity in transformed cells is acceptor dependent (Table I).Table IExpression of S. pombe α-1,2-galactosyltransferase gene in S. cerevisiaeEnzyme source1-aEnzyme source: Triton X-100-solubilized microsomal fraction prepared from different cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Galactosyltransferase activitynmol/min/mg proteinWith acceptor1-bSugar acceptor: α-methyl d-mannoside (5 μmol/50 μl of reaction mixture).

Warren G Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the expressed enzyme is expected to be localized in the Golgi vesicles with the same topography as in S. pombe. As shown in Table IIA, a considerable amount of GalT activity is associated with the low speed pellet (P2) and about 34% of total enzyme activity is associated with the 100,000 × g pellet (P3), where as about 52% of GDPase activity (Golgi marker), 16% of α-mannosidase (vacuolar marker), 18% of NADPH-dependent cytochrome c reductase (endoplasmic reticulum marker) and 24% of cytochrome coxidase (mitochondrial marker) are associated with vesicle fraction (P3). However, the relative distribution of above proteins on the basis of specific activity indicated that the enzyme (α-1,2-GalT) was highly abundant in the vesicle fraction (P3) with an overall increase in specific activity of 4.9-fold (Table IIB, 5.43 in P3 versus 1.1 in S1). In this study the specific activity of GDPase has increased about 5.3-fold, whereas the specific activities of marker enzymes of other organelles such as NADPH-dependent cytochrome c reductase, cytochrome c oxidase, and α-mannosidase has reduced by 2.4-, 9.8-, and 5.5-fold, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2073783244,"Accurate prediction of charge interactions in macromolecules presents a significant challenge for computational biology. A model for the low Cys30pKa and oxidizing power of DsbA (Gane, P. J., Freedman, R. B., and Warwicker, J. (1995) J. Mol. Biol. 249, 376–387) has been investigated experimentally (Hennecke, J., Spleiss, C., and Glockshuber, R. (1997) J. Biol.

Measured changes in Cys30 pKaand redox potential were relatively small and reported to be in contrast to model predictions. It is now shown, particularly with calculations of wild-type:mutant differences for a range of salt concentrations, that the data are consistent with the model and support the key finding that a number of different factors contribute to the oxidizing power of DsbA, so that any particular one need not necessarily be large. A feature of the model is a low protein dielectric, and higher values (which are becoming popular in predictions of pH dependence) are inconsistent with both the difference data and the wild-type Cys30 pKa.

A feature of the model is a low protein dielectric, and higher values (which are becoming popular in predictions of pH dependence) are inconsistent with both the difference data and the wild-type Cys30 pKa. DsbA from Escherichia coli is a periplasmic protein of 189 amino acids that catalyzes the introduction of disulfide bonds (1Bardwell J.C.A. Beckwith J. Cell. 1993; 74: 769-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar,2Bardwell J.C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The oxidizing power of DsbA derives from the low Cys30pKa of about 3.5 (3Nelson J.W. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 4Grauschopf U. Winther J.R. Korber P. Zander T. Dallinger P. Bardwell J.C.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 947-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), exhibiting a ΔpKa with respect to normal of around −5. DsbA is a valuable link to theory because models must account for the low Cys30 pKa and thereby provide a molecular basis for oxidizing power and physiological function. Continuum electrostatics has become the most common method for calculating macromolecular pKas (5Honig B. Nicholls A. Science. 1995; 268: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar), but it is not yet consistently accurate, with discussion revolving around the choice of macromolecular relative dielectric, εp (6Antosiewicz J. McCammon J.A. Gilson M.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 415-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 7Demchuk E. Wade R.C. J. Phys.

Variation in εp reflects the difficulty of reproducing microscopic solvation effects in a continuum model, particularly where an ionizable group is buried in the macromolecule, so that part of the high relative dielectric (εs) solvation shell is swapped for the lower εp environment (see Fig. 1). A continuum electrostatic model has been presented for the redox potential difference between E. coli DsbA and E. coli thioredoxin (9Gane P.J. Freedman R.B. Warwicker J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 376-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), using structural homology and differencing to circumvent changes in charge burial (see Fig. 1). The low thiolate pKa and oxidizing power of DsbA were suggested to arise from several sources including His32 and Gln97 side chains and summed peptide dipole contributions. Residues Glu37 and Glu38 were each predicted, if deprotonated, to move the Cys30 pKaby about 0.4 in the more reducing direction. The P34H mutation in thioredoxin supports the model implication for DsbA His32(10Lundstrom J. Krause G. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9047-9052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Redox potential and Cys30 pKameasurements have been reported for DsbA mutations Glu37and Glu38 and for the deletion mutant Δ38–40, which relates to assessment of the peptide dipoles contribution (11Hennecke J.

In contrast to the reported disparity with the predictions (11Hennecke J. Spleiss C. Glockshuber R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 189-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the current article will demonstrate that data for Δ38–40 are in line with the model. The deleted region is just one part of an implicated section of backbone, and its individual effect, although visible, is not large. The effects of Glu37 and Glu38depend on their protonation states, and it will be shown that mutant measurements (11Hennecke J. Spleiss C. Glockshuber R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 189-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and the atomic structure (12Martin J.L. Bardwell J.C.A. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1993; 365: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) are consistent with an elevated pKa for one of these residues. Whereas lower εp gives a reasonable match to experiment in the Cys30 thiolate difference calculations, it generates large discrepancies in unmodified full pKacalculations. A recently introduced modification (8Warwicker J. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), empirically accounting for changes in water entropy upon charge burial, is shown to perform qualitatively well when applied across the ionizable groups of DsbA. Reduced DsbA has been modeled previously (9Gane P.J. Freedman R.B. Warwicker J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 376-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) from the crystallographic structure of the oxidized molecule at 2-Å resolution (12Martin J.L. Bardwell J.C.A. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1993; 365: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) by breaking the Cys30–Cys33 disulfide bond and torsioning Cys30 to maintain van der Waals contact with Cys33. The modeled reduced configuration is similar to that of the homologous Cys32 in the nmr structures of reduced E. coli and human thioredoxins (13Qin J. Clore M. Gronenborn A.M. Structure. 1994; 2: 503-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 14Jeng M.-F. Campbell A.P. Begley T. Holmgren A. Case D.A. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Structure. 1994; 2: 853-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In the absence of experimentally determined atomic structures for the DsbA mutants, E37Q and E38Q were assumed to be isosteric with WT, 1The abbreviations used are: WT, wild type; FD, finite difference. and the deletion mutant Δ38–40 could be made with a Cα–Cα link between WT residues 37 and 41, accompanied by only minor conformational rearrangement upon regularization of this region in the program QUANTA, with the CHARMm force field (Molecular Simulations Inc., Waltham, MA). Neither the WT nor Δ38–40 proteins were subjected to extensive energy minimization, so that the structures would remain close to experiment and also match each other away from the deletion site. Calculated differences between WT and the mutants are based on the assumption of minimal structural alteration, which is consistent with stereochemical and hydrogen bonding considerations. The efficacy of such conformational modeling can be assessed when the mutant and reduced WT structures are determined experimentally. Charge interactions were calculated with FD solutions to the Poisson-Boltzmann equation (15Warwicker J. Watson H.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 671-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar, 16Warwicker J. J. Theor. Biol. 1986; 121: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), implemented in the program FDCALC, using εs = 80 and εp ranging from 4 to 80. Calculations of pKa differences between DsbA WT and mutants (see Fig. 1) used reported ionizable charge assignment (9Gane P.J. Freedman R.B. Warwicker J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 376-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) for groups other than Cys30. In addition, calculations of the electrostatic free energy, differenced between reduced and oxidized forms and between WT and Δ38–40 mutant, ΔΔΔG = (ΔGWT,RED − ΔGWT,OX) − (ΔGMUT,RED − ΔGMUT,OX), are compared with ratios of redox equilibrium measurements (11Hennecke J. Spleiss C. Glockshuber R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 189-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), −RTln( KeqWT/ KeqMUT), from 0 to 1 m added NaCl, with T = 298.15 K. It is assumed that the structural changes associated with both disulfide bond (Cys30–Cys33) breakage and mutation are confined to separate localized regions and that these localized effects will cancel between WT and mutant (for disulfide bond breakage) and between oxidized and reduced (for the mutation). The calculated ΔΔΔG value is therefore the remaining long range (electrostatic) interaction between the mutation and the Cys30 thiolate. Ratios of Keq at each added NaCl concentration will remove any ionic strength dependence of the glutathione redox potential. Ionic strength dependence was incorporated into the FD computations without a Stern layer. Full pKa calculations (Fig. 1) used a statistical treatment of interacting ionizable groups (17Bashford D. Karplus M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10219-10225Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar), extended with a Monte Carlo method for computations with large numbers of such groups (18Beroza P. Fredkin D.R. Okamura M.Y. Feher G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5804-5808Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). This method used 10,000 Monte Carlo steps and a modification that allows for multiple site transitions for pairs that are are coupled by an interaction equivalent to more than 2 pKa units (18Beroza P. Fredkin D.R. Okamura M.Y. Feher G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5804-5808Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Partial charges (24van Gunsteren W.F. Berendsen H.J.C. GROMOS Manual. University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands1987Google Scholar) and ionizable group (free amino acid) pKas (6Antosiewicz J. McCammon J.A. Gilson M.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 415-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar) were allocated. Ionizable residues included were Asp, Glu, His, Arg, Lys, Cys, and the amino-terminal group, whereas the carboxyl-terminal residue (189) is missing from the coordinates, and tyrosines have been omitted from the pKa calculations. Modification to account empirically for solvent entropic change upon amino acid transfer to protein is ΔEt = ΔVs Es, where ΔVs is the fractional change in first hydration shell volume (calculated from the FD grids) and Esis a free energy contribution associated with water ordering for a complete first hydration shell (8Warwicker J. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Fitting to a range of experimental pKas, with εp = 4, gives values of Es that correspond to about 6 ordered water molecules in the hydration shell of a single charge center group and about 2 for a double charge center group (8Warwicker J. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although there may be further detailed variation between ionizable group types within the charge center groupings, these values are starting points for overall estimates of pH titration curves. Some calculations were made using a Debye-Hückel model with a uniform dielectric, εeff= 50, in place of the FD procedure. The higher dielectric and the neglect of counterion exclusion from the protein interior in this method (19Warwicker J. Engelman B.P. Steitz T.A. Proteins. 1987; 2: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) reduces the size of electrostatic interactions. The pKas of these residues in WT DsbA are currently unknown, and full pKacalculations are not sufficiently reliable to provide detailed estimates, largely due to the charge burial term. The more reliable charge-charge estimates yield interactions of about 2 kJ/mol between a deprotonated Glu37 or Glu38 and the Cys30 thiolate. In the WT structure at pH 6.5 (12Martin J.L. Bardwell J.C.A. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1993; 365: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), Glu37 and Glu38 carboxylates approach within 3 Å (Fig. 2), strongly suggesting that they share a proton and that one of the pKas will be elevated above neutral pH, so that just one carboxylate to thiolate interaction should be counted for comparison to redox equilibrium measurements at pH 7. The calculated WT to double mutant difference would be this single interaction, approximating no conformational change and limited glutamine side chain charge effects. With regard to the single mutants, Glu38 lies toward the protein exterior and Glu37 facing the protein interior (Fig. 2), so that Glu37 is likely to be buried within the E38Q mutant whereas Glu38 will be solvent-exposed in the E37Q mutant. These considerations would be consistent with deprotonation of Glu38 in the E37Q mutant but neutralization of Glu37 in the E38Q mutant. The calculated ΔΔGs, WT to (E37Q, E38Q, E37Q/E38Q) mutants, for this hypothesis with the εp = 4 model are (0, −2, −2) kJ/mol compared with measured values of (0.6, −2.0, −1.5) in 10 mm sodium phosphate (11Hennecke J. Spleiss C. Glockshuber R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 189-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This reasonable agreement, constructed upon a plausible hypothesis for Glu37 and Glu38 pKas, demonstrates both the requirement for more accurate full pKa calculations and the success of the published model (9Gane P.J. Freedman R.B. Warwicker J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 376-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) in suggesting a route toward engineering more oxidizing DsbA molecules at neutral pH. Comparisons at the acidic pH of the Cys30 pKa are omitted for this set of mutants because it is likely that both Glu37 and Glu38 will be protonated in this pH region. The deleted residues 38–40 are within a larger polypeptide region (Fig. 2), which in total is predicted to contribute to thiolate stabilization in the low εp model. It is possible to make the Glu37–His41 link without substantial disruption to the rest of the protein. Following the discussion in the previous section, Glu37 becomes solvent-exposed in the modeled deletion mutant so that, by analogy with WT Glu38, it is likely to be deprotonated at the neutral pH of Keq measurements. In difference calculations between WT and Δ38–40 it is assumed that the thiolate interactions to the modeled single negative charge of WT Glu37/Glu38 and the modeled single negative charge of Glu37 in Δ38–40 cancel out. Other ionizable groups are set at normal neutral pH values except for His32and Glu24, which are in the vicinity of the active site and may have pKas around neutral pH (9Gane P.J. Freedman R.B. Warwicker J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 376-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These ionizations were set to +0.5 and −0.5, respectively. For the WTversus Δ38–40 mutant calculations, both His32and Glu24 contributions almost cancel on differencing. Calculated Cys30 thiolate contributions to ΔΔΔG are compared with experimental values derived from Keq ratios (11Hennecke J. Spleiss C. Glockshuber R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 189-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) for WT versusΔ38–40 over a range of added NaCl concentrations (Table I). The approximations in the calculations (modeled Δ38–40 conformation, ionizable charge assignment, and Keq contribution from Cys30 thiolate alone included) combined with the small ΔΔΔG values (thermal energy or less) suggest that qualitative rather than quantitative comparisons should be made. It can be seen that the εp = 4 model is by far the closest to experiment, indicating that charge-charge interactions through a low protein dielectric are important in DsbA and that higher εpvalues underestimate these interactions. Within the εp = 4 model, the listing of total and non-ionizable interactions shows the importance of partial charge stabilization of the Cys30thiolate. With the modeled Δ38–40 mutant structurally homologous to WT DsbA, these partial charge interactions can be attributed to WT residues 38–40. The measured effects (11Hennecke J. Spleiss C. Glockshuber R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 189-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) are therefore consistent with earlier predictions, which estimated interaction energy between the Cys30 thiolate and cumulative peptide dipoles over residues 25–43 at about −20 kJ/mol (9Gane P.J. Freedman R.B. Warwicker J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 376-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The measured upward Cys30 pKa shift of 0.5 for the WT to Δ38–40 mutation (11Hennecke J. Spleiss C. Glockshuber R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 189-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) compares with a value of 0.3 by εp = 4 calculation, demonstrating that these relatively small shifts are roughly in line with the prediction that extensive charge interactions in DsbA play a significant role in generating the low Cys30pKa and oxidizing power. Residues 38–40 of E. coli DsbA are missing in Vibrio cholerae DsbA, but a proline causes the same overall kink in the protein backbone (20Hu S.-H. Peek J.A. Rattigan E. Taylor R.K. Martin J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The higher thiolate pKa for V. choleraecompared with E. coli DsbA (21Ruddock L.W. Hirst T.R. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) is consistent with the results for the E. coli DsbA Δ38–40 mutant, but more detailed assessment must await full difference calculations between the two WT proteins.Table ISalt dependence of calculated and measured (using Keq) ΔΔΔGs for DsbA WT and Δ38–40Experimental/calculated0 m NaCl0.2m NaCl0.5 m NaCl1.0 m NaClExperimental1.982.162.642.53(4,80)1.21 (1.46)1.13 (1.40)1.12 (1.40)1.09 (1.43)(20,80)0.47 (0.51)0.41 (0.45)0.39 (0.43)0.37 (0.43)(80,80)0.21 (0.21)0.21 (0.21)0.19 (0.19)0.17 (0.17)ɛeff = 500.32 (0.32)0.10 (0.10)0.05 (0.05)0.00 (0.00) Open table in a new tab Measurements of folding stabilities for oxidized and reduced E. coli DsbA WT and mutants in guanidinium chloride (11Hennecke J. Spleiss C. Glockshuber R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 189-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) have not been used for comparison because the key determinant of stability in these experiments is the folding transition cooperativity (rather than the transition midpoint) from 1.5–2.5 m guanidinium chloride. Matching computations would therefore be required to account for relatively small differences in ionic strength variation at these high denaturing salt concentrations, which is beyond the scope of current methods. In regard to discussions of the link between redox potential, Cys30 pKa, and reduced/oxidized protein stability, the current calculations are consistent with such a link, with qualitative agreement between the low εp model for Cys30 interactions and Keq measurements. The remaining discrepancy, such as underestimation of experimental values with εp = 4, could signal the breakdown of the various assumptions and/or modeling insufficiency. For example, choice of εp within the lower range (typically 2–4) remains an open question, and εp < 4 would yield higher calculated values. The large difference in scale between calculated values of ΔΔΔG (Table I) for εp = 4 and higher εp models is due to the largely through-protein nature of the (38–40)/thiolate interactions, suggesting that measurements with Δ38–40 provide a sensitive test of protein dielectric modeling. Single-site mutations that are predicted to yield >0.5 pKa shift relative to WT Cys30 while preserving active site stereochemistry are removal of the His32 ionizable group or removal of the Gln97 side chain amide (9Gane P.J. Freedman R.B. Warwicker J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 376-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The various εp models are now employed in full pKa calculations for DsbA WT, thereby introducing the charge burial term (Fig. 1). Extensive studies of computed versus measured pKas in a range of proteins have revealed two important factors. There exists a subset of amino acids with large pKa shifts (often linked to function) and a much larger set with small pKashifts tending toward protein stabilization (6Antosiewicz J. McCammon J.A. Gilson M.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 415-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). When εp is varied to give the best match to experiment, the result tends toward a higher value (e.g. εp = 20), which yields the larger set of small pKa shifts (6Antosiewicz J. McCammon J.A. Gilson M.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 415-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). The Cys30 thiolate of DsbA is an excellent example of the subset of large pKa shifts. Although pH titrations of the remaining ionizable groups of DsbA have not been measured, it is appropriate to make a qualitative study of the effect of εpvariation on the overall form of the pH dependence and to ask whether any of the available models are capable of generating a large and stabilizing ΔpKa for Cys30 together with an overall set of small ΔpKas that tend toward protein stabilization. Also included is the εp = 4 model with the suggested empirical modification to account for hydration entropy change upon charge burial in full pKa calculations (8Warwicker J. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Distributions of ΔpKa are shown for the various computational models (Fig. 3). the Es parameter in the modification for single charge center groups has been adjusted to match experimental pKa values for the DsbA Cys30 and thioredoxin Cys32 thiolates (8Warwicker J. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), so that reproduction of this match for the DsbA Cys30 pKa in the modified εp = 4 model is expected. However, application of the Es modification is much more than a device for fit to experiment, because it represents a key part of solvation energetics (solvation entropy), and the derived values fall within the range of measured ionic hydration numbers. It is important to ask whether other models can generate the same agreement for Cys30 and also to analyze the overall distribution of ΔpKas. Modification of the higher εpmodels, with a term accounting for the favorable hydration entropy contribution on charge burial, would have a much smaller effect than with a lower εp model, because the magnitude of the modification must not exceed that of the unfavorable Born term to avoid a model that favors general charge group burial. In other words, the higher εp models cannot escape from a general underestimation of electrostatic interactions that leaves the Cys30ΔpKa close to zero and in contrast with experiment. With regard to the overall distribution of ΔpKas, the unmodified εp = 4 model shows a large spread, with the extension toward significant destabilization that is characteristic of charge burial in such a model. Application of the modification gives a range of ΔpKas tending toward the moderate overall stabilization that is the basis of success in the higher εpand εeff = 50 models (Fig. 3). One of the largest ΔpKa shifts upon modification of the εp= 4 model is for Cys30, arising from the significant thiolate burial within DsbA. Whereas the modified εp = 4 model can target both the overall ΔpKadistribution and specific large values, such as that of Cys30, the cost of reducing all charge interactions in the higher εp and εeff = 50 models is likely to be the omission of those larger ΔpKas that may be of functional interest. The presence of large calculated ΔpKas other than that of Cys30 in this qualitative application of the modified εp = 4 model does not necessarily indicate model breakdown, because they include residues which by various indications may have significantly altered pKas, such as Glu24, Cys33(3Nelson J.W. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and Glu37/Glu38. This article shows that a low εp continuum electrostatic model is consistent with pKa shifts and redox equilibrium measurements for DsbA WT versus mutants (11Hennecke J. Spleiss C. Glockshuber R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 189-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), reinforcing its value in understanding oxidizing power in this protein family. In the discussion of methods for full pKacalculations, DsbA provides a valuable diversion. It is not well characterized in terms of general pKa measurements, but the large and functionally significant Cys30ΔpKa provides a crucial test that higher εp models fail. Because the modified εp = 4 model recovers a reasonable (moderately stabilizing) ΔpKa profile as well as the Cys30ΔpKa, potential clearly exists for detailed model development against proteins with well characterized pH-dependent properties."
