https://openalex.org/W1784155883,"It has been known for more than a century that bone tissue adapts to functional stress by changes in structure and mass. However, the mechanism by which stress is translated into cellular activities of bone formation and resorption is unknown. We studied the response of isolated osteocytes derived from embryonic chicken calvariae to intermittent hydrostatic compression as well as pulsating fluid flow, and compared their response to osteoblasts and periosteal fibroblasts. Osteocytes, but not osteoblasts or periosteal fibroblasts, reacted to 1 h pulsating fluid flow with a sustained release of prostaglandin E2. Intermittent hydrostatic compression stimulated prostaglandin production to a lesser extent: after 6 and 24 h in osteocytes and after 6 h in osteoblasts. These data provide evidence that osteocytes are the most mechanosensitive cells in bone involved in the transduction of mechanical stress into a biological response. The results support the hypothesis that stress on bone causes fluid flow in the lacunar-canalicular system, which stimulates the osteocytes to produce factors that regulate bone metabolism.—Klein-Nulend, J., van der Plas, A., Semeins, C. M., Ajubi, N. E., Frangos, J. A., Nijweide, P. J., Burger, E. H. Sensitivity of osteocytes to biomechanical stress in vitro. FASEB J. 9, 441–445 (1995)"

However, the putative protein mediator of this nongenomic action has not been described. Using antibodies directed against a peptide representing the hinge region of the intracellular estrogen receptor (iER), we have demonstrated that these cells contain a membrane ER (mER). We now report that confocal scanning laser microscopy of cells labeled live with the anti-peptide antibody further supports a membrane localization of ER. The monoclonal antibodies H226 and H222 and a polyclonal antibody, ER21, each recognizing a unique epitope on iER (NH2 terminal to the DNA-binding region, within the steroid binding region, and the NH2-terminal end, respectively), also immunohistochemically label membrane proteins of immuno-selected GH3/B6 cells. These cells also specifically bind a fluorescent estrogen-BSA conjugate. Coincubation of cells with anti-ER antibody and the fluorescent estrogen-BSA conjugate reveals that these labels colocalize on cells. These results suggest that mER may be structurally similar to iER."
https://openalex.org/W1504507024,"In mammalian small intestine, a H+-coupled peptide transporter is responsible for the absorption of small peptides arising from digestion of dietary proteins. Recently a cDNA clone encoding a H+/peptide cotransporter has been isolated from a rabbit intestinal cDNA library (Fei, Y. J., Kanai, Y., Nussberger, S., Ganapathy, V., Leibach, F. H., Romero, M. F., Singh, S. K., Boron, W. F., and Hediger, M. A.(1994) Nature 368, 563-566). Screening of a human intestinal cDNA library with a probe derived from the rabbit H+/peptide cotransporter cDNA resulted in the identification of a cDNA which when expressed in HeLa cells or in Xenopus laevis oocytes induced H+-dependent peptide transport activity. The predicted protein consists of 708 amino acids with 12 membrane-spanning domains and two putative sites for protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation. The cDNA-induced transport process accepts dipeptides, tripeptides, and amino β-lactam antibiotics but not free amino acids as substrates. The human H+/peptide cotransporter exhibits a high degree of homology (81% identity and 92% similarity) to the rabbit H+/peptide cotransporter. But surprisingly these transporters show only a weak homology to the H+-coupled peptide transport proteins present in bacteria and yeast. Chromosomal assignment studies with somatic cell hybrid analysis and in situ hybridization have located the gene encoding the cloned human H+/peptide cotransporter to chromosome 13 q33→q34. In mammalian small intestine, a H+-coupled peptide transporter is responsible for the absorption of small peptides arising from digestion of dietary proteins. Recently a cDNA clone encoding a H+/peptide cotransporter has been isolated from a rabbit intestinal cDNA library (Fei, Y. J., Kanai, Y., Nussberger, S., Ganapathy, V., Leibach, F. H., Romero, M.

Chromosomal assignment studies with somatic cell hybrid analysis and in situ hybridization have located the gene encoding the cloned human H+/peptide cotransporter to chromosome 13 q33→q34. Mammalian small intestine expresses a transport system that is specific for small peptides consisting of 2-4 amino acids(1Ganapathy V. Brandsch M. Leibach F.H. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Raven Press, New York1994: 1773-1794Google Scholar). Free amino acids do not serve as substrates for this system. The physiological role of the intestinal peptide transporter is to absorb small peptides arising from digestion of dietary proteins. The pharmacological relevance of this transporter has become evident in recent years because intestinal absorption of orally active amino β-lactam antibiotics and other peptide-like drugs is mediated by this transporter(1Ganapathy V. Brandsch M. Leibach F.H. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Raven Press, New York1994: 1773-1794Google Scholar, 2Tsuji A. Adv.

It has been proposed that the transporter has the potential to become an important drug delivery system(3Amidon G.L. Lee H.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 34: 321-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Studies on the energetic aspects of the transport system have demonstrated that the driving force for the transporter is an electrochemical H+ gradient rather than an electrochemical Na+ gradient(1Ganapathy V. Brandsch M. Leibach F.H. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Raven Press, New York1994: 1773-1794Google Scholar, 4Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Am. J.

Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A H+-dependent peptide transport system is also expressed in the mammalian kidney(7Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Life Sci. 1982; 30: 2137-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 8Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 251: F945-F953Google Scholar, 9Ganapathy V. Miyamoto Y. Leibach F.H. Adv. Biosci. 1987; 65: 91-98Google Scholar), but it is not known whether the renal transporter is identical to or distinct from the intestinal transporter. Microinjection of rabbit intestinal mRNA into Xenopus laevis oocytes leads to functional expression of a H+-dependent peptide transport system with characteristics similar to those of the transporter in the native tissue(10Miyamoto Y. Thompson Y.G. Howard E.F. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4742-4745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently we have isolated a cDNA encoding a H+-dependent peptide transporter from a rabbit small intestinal cDNA library using this Xenopus oocyte expression system as the screening procedure(11Fei Y.J. Kanai Y. Nussberger S. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Romero M.F. Singh S.K. Boron W.F. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). We report in this paper the cloning of a human intestinal H+/peptide cotransporter. The cloned transporter has been characterized by functionally expressing the transporter in HeLa cells as well as in X. laevis oocytes. Chromosomal localization studies have revealed that the gene for the transporter is present on chromosome 13 q33→q34. The human intestinal cDNA library (λgt10) used here was prepared with mRNA from the ileum(12Hediger M.A. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5748-5752Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The library was screened by plaque hybridization using VCS 257 cells. The probe was a 0.6-kb 1R. Liang, Y.-J. Fei, P. D. Prasad, S. Ramamoorthy, H. Han, T. L. Yang-Feng, M. A. Hediger, V. Ganapathy, and F. H. Leibach, unpublished data. fragment arising from the 5′ end of the rabbit intestinal H+/peptide cotransporter cDNA(11Fei Y.J. Kanai Y. Nussberger S. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Romero M.F. Singh S.K. Boron W.F. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). The fragment was released from the full-length cDNA by EcoRI digestion and radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the oligolabeling kit from Pharmacia LKB Biotechnol. Hybridization was carried out at 42°C in a solution containing 50% formamide, 6 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml of salmon sperm DNA. Washing was done under medium stringency conditions, two times in 3 × SSC, 0.5% SDS at 55°C for 30 min and one time in 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60°C for 30 min. Positive clones were identified and plaque purified by secondary and tertiary screening. On the tertiary autoradiographs, 100% of the plaques showed positive hybridization signal, confirming the purity of the clones. Phage DNA was prepared using the WizardTM Lambda Prep DNA Purification System (Promega). Digestion of the DNA with EcoRI yielded three DNA fragments, 1.2, 0.6 and 0.4 kb in size, in addition to the two fragments (11 and 40 kb in size) arising from the vector. All three fragments of the cDNA insert hybridized to the full-length (2.7 kb) rabbit intestinal H+/peptide cotransporter cDNA probe. The digestion pattern indicated that there are two internal sites for EcoRI in the insert and that the size of the full-length insert is approximately 2.2 kb. In order to obtain the full-length cDNA for functional expression, partial digestion with EcoRI was used. The phage DNA was digested with increasing concentrations of EcoRI, and the digestion fragments were analyzed by Southern hybridization. Partial digestion yielded three new fragments (2.2, 1.8, and 1.6 kb) in addition to the above described three and all six fragments hybridized to the full-length rabbit intestinal H+/peptide cotransporter cDNA probe. The concentration of EcoRI which generated the maximal amount of the 2.2-kb fragment was chosen for digestion in a large scale. The full-length cDNA was isolated, gene cleaned, and subcloned. The 2.2-kb full-length cDNA fragment was subcloned into pBluescript SKII. The clones were selected in which the insert was oriented in such a way that its transcription was under the control of the T7 promotor in the vector. The three fragments arising from the complete digestion were also subcloned into pBluescript SKII. These three clones as well as the full-length clone were used for nucleotide sequencing, and the full-length clone was used for functional expression. Sequencing was done by the dideoxy chain termination method(13Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5468Crossref PubMed Scopus (52107) Google Scholar). Synthetic oligonucleotide primers were used whenever necessary to complete the sequencing of both the sense and the antisense strands. Sequence analysis was performed by the software package GCG version 7.B (Genetics Computer Groups, Inc. Madison, WI). Multiple sequence alignment was done using the Genbank Program PILEUP. This was done using the vaccinia virus expression system (14Blakely R.D. Clark J.A. Rudnick G. Amara S.G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) as described previously(15Ramamoorthy S. Bauman A.L. Moore K.R. Han H. Yang-Feng T.L. Chang A.S. Ganapathy V. Blakely R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2542-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 16Ramamoorthy S. Leibach F.H. Mahesh V.B. Han H. Yang-Feng T.L. Blakely R.D. Ganapathy V. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 893-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Subconfluent HeLa cells were first infected with a recombinant (VTF7-3) vaccinia virus encoding T7 RNA polymerase and then transfected with the plasmid carrying the full-length cDNA. The strategy behind this approach is that the virus-encoded T7 RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of the cDNA under the control of the T7 promotor allowing transient expression of the cDNA-encoded protein in the HeLa cell plasma membrane. After 8-10 h post-transfection, transport measurements were made at room temperature with [2-14C]glycyl-[1-14C]sarcosine (specific radioactivity 109 mCi/mmol; Cambridge Research Biochemicals, United Kingdom). The uptake medium was 25 mM Mes/Tris (pH 6.0) or 25 mM Hepes/Tris (pH 7.5), containing 140 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 0.8 mM MgSO4, and 5 mM glucose. In most experiments, the time of incubation for transport measurements was 2 min. Nonspecific transport was determined in parallel experiments with the plasmid vector. This transport was negligible and represented only 3-5% of the transport measured in cells which were transfected with the vector carrying the cDNA insert. Moreover, this value was not due to carrier-mediated transport as concluded from the lack of inhibition by excess unlabeled glycylsarcosine. Thus there was no detectable endogenous glycylsarcosine transport activity in HeLa cells. Therefore, the transport values measured in cells transfected with the vector-cDNA construct were analyzed directly without correcting for the values obtained in cells which were transfected with the vector alone. This was done as described previously (11Fei Y.J. Kanai Y. Nussberger S. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Romero M.F. Singh S.K. Boron W.F. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar) by microinjecting cRNA (25 ng) derived from the clone. The plasmid DNA was linearized with NotI and transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase. Capping was done with the cap analog m7G(5′)PPP(5′)G (Pharmacia). Water-injected oocytes served as controls. Transport measurements were made with individual oocytes 4 days after injection. The concentration of [2-14C]glycyl-[1-14C]sarcosine was 30 μM, and the uptake medium was 3 mM Hepes/Mes/Tris (pH 5.5) or 3 mM Hepes/Tris (pH 7.5), containing 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM CaCl2. The incubation time for transport measurements with oocytes was 1 h. Tissue distribution of mRNA transcripts coding for the H+/peptide cotransporter was determined by Northern blot. Poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated from human ileum and two cell lines of human intestinal origin (Caco-2 and HT-29) using the FastTrack mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen). Poly(A)+ mRNA samples (2.5-4 μg) from these sources were denatured and size-fractionated on an agarose gel. The fractionated RNA was transferred onto a nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Corp.) and probed with the full-length human intestinal H+/peptide cotransporter (hPEPT 1) cDNA under high stringency conditions (hybridization: overnight incubation at 42°C in 50% formamide and 10% dextran sulfate; washing: once with 3 × SSC-0.5% SDS at room temperature for 30 min, twice with 3 × SSC, 0.5% SDS at 55°C for 30 min and once with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55°C for 30 min). Following stripping of the blot, similar hybridization was conducted with human β-actin cDNA (Clontech) to assess RNA loading and transfer efficiency. Northern analysis with hPEPT 1 cDNA was also done using a commercially available membrane blot containing size-fractionated poly(A)+ mRNA from several tissues of human origin (Clontech). This blot was also reprobed with human β-actin cDNA for assessment of RNA loading and transfer efficiency. The 2.2-kb full-length hPEPT 1 cDNA was used for chromosomal localization of the gene coding for the human intestinal H+/peptide cotransporter. This was done by somatic cell hybrid analysis and by in situ hybridization to human metaphase chromosomes. A mapping panel (panel no. 1) consisting of 17 mouse-human and one Chinese hamster-human hybrids was obtained from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences' Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository and used in somatic cell hybrid analysis. DNA samples obtained from these cells were digested with EcoRI, separated by electrophoresis on agarose gels, transferred onto a nylon membrane, and hybridized to [32P]hPEPT 1 cDNA as described previously(17Yang-Feng T.L. Floyd-Smith G. Nemer M. Drouin J. Francke U. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1985; 37: 1117-1128PubMed Google Scholar). In situ hybridization of [3H]hPEPT 1 cDNA to human chromosomes and emulsion autoradiography were carried out by the method of Harper and Saunders (18Harper M.E. Saunders G.F. Chromosoma. 1981; 83: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Chromosomes were G-banded using Wright's stain, and G-banded chromosomes were analyzed for silver grain localization. The hPEPT 1 cDNA was labeled by nick translation either in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (Southern blot hybridization) or in the presence of [3H]dCTP and [3H]dTTP (in situ hybridization) and used in these experiments. Screening of approximately 3 × 105 plaques from a human intestinal cDNA library with a 5′ end fragment (0.6 kb) of the rabbit intestinal H+/peptide cotransporter cDNA as a probe yielded four positive clones. All of these clones were related as judged from EcoRI digestion pattern. One of them was characterized in detail in terms of its structure and function. Digestion of the phage DNA with EcoRI gave three fragments indicating the presence of two internal EcoRI sites in the insert. The full-length cDNA was prepared from the phage DNA by partial digestion with EcoRI. A pilot experiment was run to determine the optimal concentration of the enzyme which would give the maximal amount of the full-length cDNA insert. After digesting the phage DNA with increasing concentrations of EcoRI, the digestion products were size-fractionated and then probed with the full-length rabbit intestinal H+/peptide cotransporter cDNA by Southern blot (Fig. 1). Complete digestion with the maximal amount of the enzyme used generated three hybridizing signals (1.2, 0.6, and 0.4 kb in size). With lesser concentrations of the enzyme, the amounts of these three fragments decreased while larger size fragments appeared. The size of the largest fragment was 2.2 kb. Two other partial digestion products (1.8 and 1.6 kb) were also generated. This digestion pattern indicated that the 2.2-kb full-length insert consisted of the 1.2-kb fragment flanked on one side by the 0.6-kb fragment and on the other side by the 0.4-kb fragment. The concentration of EcoRI giving the maximal amount of the 2.2-kb fragment was chosen for a large scale preparation. The full-length fragment was then isolated and subcloned into pBluescript SK II. The cDNA is 2,263 bp long with an open reading frame of 2,127 bp (including termination codon) encoding a protein of 708 amino acids (Fig. 2). The open reading frame is flanked by a 56-bp long sequence on the 5′ end and by a 80-bp long sequence on the 3′ end. The predicted initiation codon is preceded by a Kozak consensus sequence (GCC GCC)(19Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3537) Google Scholar). The encoded protein is predicted to have a core molecular size of 78,810 Da and an isoelectric point of 8.6. Hydropathy analysis of the primary amino acid sequence of the predicted protein shows the presence of 12 putative transmembrane domains with a long ( ~200 amino acids) hydrophilic segment between the transmembrane domains 9 and 10. This hydrophilic segment contains seven putative N-linked glycosylation sites. When modeled to accommodate all the transmembrane domains and to allow the long hydrophilic loop on the extracellular side, the model places both the amino terminus and the carboxyl terminus on the cytoplasmic side. There are two potential sites for protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation (Ser-357 and Ser-704) but no site for protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation. Comparison of the amino acid sequence between this clone and the rabbit intestinal H+/peptide cotransporter reveals a high degree of homology (81% identity and 92% similarity). Most of the conserved sequences occur within the putative transmembrane domains. The human homolog is 1 amino acid residue longer than the rabbit counterpart. An important difference between these two proteins is that the rabbit intestinal H+/peptide cotransporter possesses a site for protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation (Thr-362) whereas the human homolog does not. The threonine residue present at this site in the rabbit transporter is replaced by alanine in the human homolog. To assess the transport function of the cloned human cDNA, it was expressed in HeLa cells and in X. laevis oocytes, and its function was monitored by the transport of the dipeptide glycylsarcosine. The construct used in these expression studies contains the H+/peptide cotransporter cDNA (hPEPT 1) insert cloned into pBluescript SK II in such a way that its transcription is under the control of the T7 promotor. When this plasmid was transfected into HeLa cells expressing a recombinant vaccinia virus T7 RNA polymerase, the cells were able to transport glycylsarcosine in a H+-dependent manner (Fig. 3). The H+ dependence was evident from the 4- to 5-fold greater transport when measured at an extracellular pH of 6.0 instead of 7.5. Control cells transfected with the empty vector showed negligible transport when measured at pH 6.0. An incubation period of 2 min and an extracellular pH of 6.0 were used in subsequent experiments with hPEPT 1-transfected cells to approximate the initial transport rate. Table 1 describes the results of competition experiments performed to determine the substrate specificity of the hPEPT 1. In these experiments, the ability of unlabeled amino acids, dipeptides, tripeptides, and amino β-lactam antibiotics to compete with [14C]glycylsarcosine (20 μM) for the transport process induced by hPEPT 1 was studied. At a concentration of 10 mM, free amino acids had no effect on the transport. On the other hand, dipeptides, tripeptides, as well as the three amino β-lactam antibiotics (cyclacillin, cefadroxil, and cephalexin) were found to be potent inhibitors of the transport. The hPEPT 1-induced transport system thus appears to be specific for small peptides and peptide-like compounds with no affinity toward free amino acids. The induced transport process is saturable as evident from transport measurements done at varying concentrations of glycylsarcosine in the range of 0.05-5 mM (Fig. 4). Under these conditions, the transport of radiolabel from 20 μM [14C]glycylsarcosine in hPEPT 1-transfected cells was reduced in the presence of 25 mM unlabeled glycylsarcosine to a level observed in vector-transfected cells in the absence of unlabeled glycylsarcosine, indicting that the transport induced by hPEPT 1 was almost completely carrier-mediated. The experimental data were found to fit best for a model describing the uptake as the result of a single carrier plus a diffusional component. The diffusional coefficient was 0.35 ± 0.06. The Eadie-Hofstee transformation of the data for the carrier-mediated uptake yielded a linear plot (r = −0.98) (Fig. 4). The kinetic parameters for the carrier-mediated uptake, Kt (Michaelis-Menten constant) and Vmax (maximal velocity), were 0.29 ± 0.04 mM and 4.7 ± 0.3 nmol/2 min/106 cells. The diffusional component represented 2 and 28% of total uptake measured at 0.05 and 5 mM glycylsarcosine, respectively. The transport function of hPEPT 1 was also assessed by expressing the protein in X. laevis oocytes (Fig. 5). The oocytes injected with cRNA derived from the hPEPT 1 cDNA showed 8-fold greater activity for glycylsarcosine transport than water-injected oocytes. The expressed transporter was H+ dependent because the dipeptide transport was significantly higher when measured at pH 5.5 than at pH 7.5. In addition, unlabeled glycylsarcosine was able to compete with [14C]glycylsarcosine for the transport process induced by hPEPT 1. The magnitude of stimulation of glycylsarcosine transport induced in X. laevis oocytes by hPEPT 1 is five to six times smaller than the corresponding value observed with the rabbit H+/peptide cotransporter cDNA, although the amino acid sequences in the coding region of these two clones exhibit 81% identity and 92% similarity. This difference is most likely due to the fact that the rabbit clone was complete with its poly(A) tail whereas the human clone has a truncated 3′-noncoding region comprising of only 80 bp with no poly(A) sequence. The poly(A) tail is known to stabilize mRNA. Therefore, it is likely that the cRNA derived from the rabbit clone is more stable in X. laevis oocytes than the cRNA derived from the human clone. Distribution of PEPT 1 mRNA in human tissues was studied using a commercially available membrane blot containing size-fractionated poly(A)+ mRNA from eight tissues: heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas (Fig. 6). Among these tissues, a 3.3-kb hybridizing signal was present in placenta, liver, kidney, and pancreas. The transcript was absent in other tissues. The functional characteristics of the H+/peptide cotransporter have been investigated in detail only in intestine and kidney. Human placenta possesses peptide transport activity (20Ganapathy M.E. Mahesh V.B. Devoe L.D. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1985; 153: 83-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) but whether this activity is mediated by the H+-coupled peptide transporter is not known. Therefore, it is interesting that the placenta expresses the PEPT 1 mRNA though at very low levels. The presence of 3.3-kb mRNA transcript in kidney is not unexpected, but the observation that the levels of the transcript in this tissue are manyfold lower than the levels in intestine is surprising. Brush border membrane vesicles prepared from kidney exhibit robust H+/peptide cotransport activity(21Takuwa N. Shimada T. Matsumoto H. Hoshi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 814: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 22Tiruppathi C. Kulanthaivel P. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 23Tiruppathi C. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14870-14874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that a major portion of the H+/peptide cotransport activity expressed in kidney is not due to PEPT 1. The existence of multiple forms of H+/peptide cotransporter in mammalian tissues thus seems very likely. The levels of the 3.3-kb mRNA transcript in liver and pancreas are significantly higher than in kidney. Interestingly, it has been reported that liver does not have the ability to take up peptides from the circulation(24Lombardo Y.B. Morse E.L. Adibi S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12920-12926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Liver contains heterogeneous population of cells, and therefore the possibility that the peptide transport activity is expressed in cells other than hepatocytes cannot be excluded. Whether pancreas expresses H+/peptide cotransport activity is not known. Northern analysis of poly(A)+ mRNA isolated from human ileum revealed the presence of a major RNA species, 3.3 kb in size, which hybridized to the hPEPT 1 cDNA (Fig. 6). There are several minor hybridizing RNA species in the human intestine. We also analyzed poly(A)+ mRNA from two cell lines of human intestinal origin for the presence of PEPT 1 mRNA. Caco-2 cells which are known to possess H+/peptide cotransporter activity (25Brandsch M. Miyamoto Y. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) contains the primary 3.3-kb transcript as well as the other minor transcripts. Thus, the distribution of the different PEPT 1 mRNA transcripts in this cell line is similar to that in the human intestine. In contrast, HT-29 cells which are also commonly used as a model for intestinal transport studies do not contain any detectable hybridizing signal (data not shown). There was a report by Dantzig and Bergin (26Dantzig A.H. Bergin L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 155: 1082-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) describing expression of peptide transport activity in HT-29 cells. We investigated the transport of glycylsarcosine in HT-29 cells in our laboratory and found no evidence for the expression of the H+/peptide cotransporter in these cells. 1R. Liang, Y.-J. Fei, P. D. Prasad, S. Ramamoorthy, H. Han, T. L. Yang-Feng, M. A. Hediger, V. Ganapathy, and F. H. Leibach, unpublished data.It is not known at this time whether this discrepancy is due to the possibility that different clones of the HT-29 cell line might have been used in these two studies or due to the possibility that the transport activity measured in the study by Dantzig and Bergin (26Dantzig A.H. Bergin L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 155: 1082-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) is catalyzed by a carrier other than the H+/peptide cotransporter. We have mapped the chromosomal location of the gene encoding the cloned intestinal H+/peptide cotransporter. Southern blot hybridization with the hPEPT 1 cDNA probe detected six human-specific fragments of 24, 17, 5.4, 3.8 and 2.6 kb, two mouse-specific fragments of 20.5 and 5.6 kb, and three Chinese hamster-specific fragments of 26, 23, and 17 kb. All human-specific fragments showed concordant segregation with chromosome 13 (Table 2). Regional localization of the hPEPT 1 gene was carried out by in situ hybridization with 3H-labeled hPEPT 1 cDNA. Of 133 grains over 50 metaphases analyzed, 25 (18.8%) were located at chromosome 13 q33→q24 (Fig. 7). No other chromosomal site was labeled above background. The hPEPT 1 is highly homologous to the rabbit intestinal H+/peptide cotransporter(11Fei Y.J. Kanai Y. Nussberger S. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Romero M.F. Singh S.K. Boron W.F. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the protein sequences of these transporters do not show strong homology with other known classes of transport proteins. However, they do show weak but definite homology with certain transport proteins from nonmammalian sources (Fig. 8). These proteins are the peptide transporter from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Yeast Ptr 2)(27Perry J.R. Basrai M.A. Steiner H.Y. Naider F. Becker J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 104-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), a protein encoded by S. cerevisiae chromosome X1 DNA (Yeast X1 DNA), the chlorate/nitrate transporter from Arabidopsis thaliana (CHL 1) (28Tsay Y.F. Schroeder J.I. Feldmann K.A. Crawford N.M. Cell. 1993; 72: 705-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) and the di- and tripeptide transporter from Lactococcus Lactis (L. Lact. Ptr)(29Hagting A. Kunji E.R.S. Leenhouts K.J. Poolman B. Konings W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11391-11399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast Ptr 2 and the L. lactis Ptr catalyze transport of small peptides via a mechanism energized by an electrochemical H+ gradient(27Perry J.R. Basrai M.A. Steiner H.Y. Naider F. Becker J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 104-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 29Hagting A. Kunji E.R.S. Leenhouts K.J. Poolman B. Konings W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11391-11399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that even though there is a high degree of similarity in the nature of the driving force and the transported substrates among the yeast Ptr 2, L. lactis Ptr, and hPEPT 1, the homology of the primary amino acid sequence of hPEPT 1 to the other two proteins is not very high. Transport of nitrate in A. thaliana catalyzed by CHL 1 occurs via a H+-dependent mechanism(28Tsay Y.F. Schroeder J.I. Feldmann K.A. Crawford N.M. Cell. 1993; 72: 705-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 30McClure P.R. Kochian L.V. Spanswick R.M. Shaff J.E. Plant Physiol. 1990; 93: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The significant, even though weak, homology in the amino acid sequence among these transport systems is indicative of the similarity in the nature of the substrate and/or driving force involved in transport processes mediated by these systems. There are other known transport systems which either utilize an electrochemical H+ gradient as the energy source or mediate the transport of peptides, but there is no significant homology between these proteins and the hPEPT 1. Examples of these transport systems include the prokaryotic H+-coupled lactose permease (31Kaback H.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 137A: 97-125Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and the peptide transport systems described in several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (32Higgins C.F. Gibson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 125: 365-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 33Alloing G. Trombe M.C. Claverys J.P. Mol.

With the exception of L. lactis Ptr, the peptide transport systems described thus far in bacteria belong to the super family of ABC transporters or traffic ATPases. This class of transport systems directly utilizes the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to energize active transport of solutes. Another transport system which surprisingly shows no structural similarity to hPEPT 1 is the transporter associated with antigen processing(37Monaco J.J. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 173-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). This transporter is a heterodimer consisting of two proteins TAP 1 and TAP 2 and is involved in the transport of peptide antigens, normally consisting of about 9 amino acids, across the membrane of endoplasmic reticulum to be subsequently presented to the major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. This system, sometimes referred to as a peptide transporter, is not found in the plasma membrane and is not coupled to an electrochemical H+ gradient. It is a member of the ABC transporter family. Recently, Dantzig et al.(38Dantzig A.H. Hoskins J. Tabas L.B. Bright S. Shepard R.L. Jenkins I.L. Duckworth D.C. Sportsman J.R. Mackensen D. Rosteck Jr., P.R. Skatrud P.L. Science. 1994; 264: 430-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) reported on the isolation of a cDNA encoding a protein associated with intestinal peptide transport. There is no significant structural similarity between hPEPT 1 and this protein designated as hpt-1 (16% identity; 41% similarity). This protein contains a single putative transmembrane domain in contrast to hPEPT 1 which contains 12 putative transmembrane domains. Tissue distribution of hpt-1 and hPEPT 1 is also different. hpt-1 is expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas but is absent in kidney and liver whereas hPEPT 1 is expressed in all of these tissues. Similarly, hpt-1 is present in Caco-2 as well as HT-29 cells whereas hPEPT 1 is present in Caco-2 cells but not in HT-29 cells. Transfection of hpt-1 cDNA into mammalian cells leads to induction of H+-dependent transport of aminocephalosporins. The induced transport is inhibitable by glycyl-D-proline. Whether there is a functional relationship between hpt-1 and hPEPT 1 remains to be determined. The observation that hPEPT 1 contains two putative sites for protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation may be relevant to our recent studies (25Brandsch M. Miyamoto Y. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) which showed that the activity of the H+/peptide cotransporter expressed in the human intestinal cell line Caco-2 is regulated by protein kinase C. Site-directed mutagenesis studies are required to determine the role of these two sites in this regulation. The findings that hPEPT 1 does not possess any site for potential phosphorylation by protein kinase A are interesting and may have physiological relevance. cAMP is an important modulator of intestinal function and its role in clinical disorders caused by pathogens such as vibrio cholerae and enterotoxigenic strains of Escherichia coli is well known. The importance, if any, of the absence of potential sites in hPEPT 1 for protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation in physiological and pathological conditions remains to be determined. In summary, we have isolated a cDNA (hPEPT 1) from a human intestinal cDNA library which when expressed in X. laevis oocytes and in HeLa cells induces H+ gradient-dependent peptide transport activity. The functional characteristics of the induced activity are similar to those of the peptide transport activity described in mammalian small intestine. The deduced primary amino acid sequence of hPEPT 1 is highly homologous to the rabbit intestinal peptide transporter but is only distantly related to the peptide transporters present in yeast and L. lactis. It has no significant homology to hpt-1, a recently reported protein apparently associated with intestinal peptide transport. The gene which codes for hPEPT 1 has been localized to human chromosome 13 q33→q34. We thank J. C. Liu for nucleotide sequencing and Joyce Hobson for secretarial assistance."

This region of the murine SP-A gene contained nucleotide sequences consistent with thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) binding motifs. An SP-A-CAT plasmid containing the TTF-1 binding sites was transcriptionally active in mouse lung epithelial (MLE-15) cells but not in HeLa, 3T3, or H441 cells. However, transcription of the SP-A-CAT construct was activated after cotransfection of HeLa cells with a vector expressing recombinant TTF-1, pCMV-TTF-1. Recombinant TTF-1 homeodomain protein bound to four distinct binding sites located between nucleotides −231 to −168. Proteins in nuclear extracts of MLE-15 cells bound TTF-1 binding sites and were supershifted by TTF-1 antibody. Mutations of three of the TTF-1 binding sites in this region reduced expression of the SP-A-CAT construct in transfected MLE-15 cells and reduced transactivation in HeLa cells. TTF-1 interacts with complex protein/DNA binding sites located in the 5′-flanking region of the murine SP-A gene enhancing lung epithelial cell-specific expression in vitro."

INTRODUCTIONPolypeptide hormones exert their biological effects through interactions with specific cell surface receptors(1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4583) Google Scholar). Growth factors such as insulin, epidermal growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor stimulate a tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to their cognate receptors (for reviews, see (2Rosen O.M. Science. 1987; 237: 1452-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 3Yarden Y. Ullrich A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 443-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar, 4Williams L.T. Science. 1989; 243: 1564-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar)). The ensuing tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins is necessary to elicit the characteristic effects of each hormone on cell growth and metabolism. Protein hormones belonging to the cytokine family also stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of various cellular proteins(5Nakajima K. Wall R. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1994; 269: 11648-11655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because cytokine receptors do not possess intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, they must instead rely on interactions with nonreceptor tyrosine kinases for signal transduction. An emerging model of cytokine receptor signaling suggests that ligand-induced multimerization of receptor molecules promotes the phosphorylation and activation of specific receptor-associated tyrosine kinases, which, in turn, phosphorylate target proteins within the cell(8Kishimoto T. Taga T. Akira S. Cell. 1994; 76: 253-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar).Genetic complementation studies with the interferon receptors were the first to implicate the involvement of the JAK family of tyrosine kinases, tyk2, JAK1, and JAK2 (10Firmbach K.I.

Recently, a membrane-proximal region of the GH receptor was shown to be necessary for association with JAK2(26VanderKuur J.A. Wang X. Zhang L. Campbell G.S. Allevato G. Billestrup N. Norstedt G. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21709-21717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Several key issues regarding the role of the JAK kinases in cytokine receptor signaling need to be addressed. First, it is unclear whether JAK kinase isoforms differentially associate with cytokine receptors. For example, it has been demonstrated that cytokines whose receptors form complexes with gp130 (27Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Stahl N. Pan L. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Ip N.Y. Yancopoulos G.D.

Farruggella T. Ip N.Y. Davis S. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Silvennoinen O. Barbieri G. Pellegrini S. Ihle J.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1994; 263: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). In transfected cell lines, gp130 can physically associate with either JAK1 or JAK2(22Stahl N. Boulton T.G. Farruggella T. Ip N.Y. Davis S. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Silvennoinen O. Barbieri G. Pellegrini S. Ihle J.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1994; 263: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Although the receptors for GH and EPO have been shown to interact only with JAK2(17Argetsinger L.S. Campbell G.S. Yang X. Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Carter S.C. Cell. 1993; 74: 237-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 18Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Silvennoinen O. Yi T. Tang B. Miura O. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1993; 74: 227-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar), it is possible that these receptors can interact with other JAK family members in other cell lines. Second, it is not known what structural features of the JAK kinases and the cytokine receptors are necessary for their interaction. Identifying regions of the cytokine receptors required for JAK kinase association may provide clues to the specificity of the association as well as the functional role of these kinases in cytokine receptor signal transduction.Here, we describe a system to assess the ability of the JAK kinases to interact with the cytoplasmic domain of the receptors for GH and EPO and with gp130. We also define structural features of the receptors and the JAK kinases necessary for their interaction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Constructs and MutagenesisCreation of the cDNAs for the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV G) cytokine receptor chimeras was accomplished by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (29Mullis K. Faloona F. Scharf S. Saiki R. Horn G. Erlich H. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1986; 1: 263-273Crossref Google Scholar). Overlapping primers were synthesized which contain the DNA sequences encoding the carboxyl-terminal six amino acid residues of the transmembrane domain of the VSV G protein and the first six amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain of the cytokine receptor proteins. The sequences of the primers (in both orientations) used were; GGACTATTCTTGGTTCTCAAGCAGCAAAGGATTAAG (GH-R); GGACTATTCTTGGTTCTCTCCCACCGCCGGACTCTG (EPO-R); GGACTATTCTTGGTTCTCAATAAGCGAGACCTAATT (gp130). cDNAs for the mouse GH receptor (provided by Dr. F. Talamantes, University of California, Santa Cruz), human gp130 (provided by T. Kishimoto, Osaka University), and mouse erythropoietin receptor were used as templates for generating specific receptor cytoplasmic domain cDNA fragments. Site-overlap extension of the hybrid DNA products was used to create the cDNAs encoding the chimeric receptor proteins with the primers listed above and the T7 or RSP primers(30Higuchi R. PCR Technology: Principles and Applications for DNA Amplification. Stockton Press, New York1989Google Scholar). Chimeric cDNA products were subcloned into the plasmid vector pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene). The GZeta chimeric protein is comprised of the extracellular domain of the VSV G protein and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the murine ζ chain of the T cell receptor(31Timson Gauen L.K.

Introduction of a BamHI restriction site (italics) facilitated screening recombinants for desired mutation. The G/GH-130 chimeric receptor consisted of the membrane-proximal and box 1 amino acid sequences of the mouse GH receptor fused to amino acid sequences of human gp130 which are carboxyl-terminal to the box 1 region of gp130. The oligonucleotide primers which were used to create the G/GH-130 cDNA by site overlap extension was CCCCCAGTCCCAGTTCCATCAAAGAGTCATATTGCC (in both orientations).The mouse JAK1 and JAK2 cDNAs (kindly provided by S.

Kong A.N. Samelson L.E. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5438-5446Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). These modified JAK kinases, contained the carboxyl-terminal 257 amino acid residues of the mouse p59fyn protein fused to the JH2 domain (nomenclature of Harpur et al.(13Harpur A.G. Andres A.C.

Stockton Press, New York1989Google Scholar).The JAK1/JAK2fyn (J1/J2) and JAK2/JAK1fyn (J2/J1) chimeras were made by replacing complementary sequences between JAK1 and JAK2. An EcoRI site (underlined) was added to the 3′ end of the first 963 bases of JAK1 by PCR using the oligonucleotide primer CCACTGAATTCCCCCGAGATTTCCAGTCACCAT for creation of the J1/J2 chimera. The DNA fragment was digested with EcoRI and ligated with a cDNA fragment of JAK2fyn which had also been digested with EcoRI to provide a junction site at amino acid residue 296 of the JAK2fyn molecule. The J2/J1 chimera was made in a similar fashion by using the following pairs of primers ATAATAACTGGAAACGGTGGGATCCAGTGGCGGCAG, CTGCCGCCACTGGATCCCACCGTTTCCAGTTATTAT which created BamHI restriction sites (underlined) at the 3′ end of the 5′ 885 bases of JAK2 and at the 5′ end of the JAK1fyn cDNA encoding amino acid 296. The DNA fragments were digested with BamHI and ligated together.DNA Transfections and in Vitro Kinase AssaysThe protocol for DNA transfection and expression of proteins in HeLa cells has been previously described(31Timson Gauen L.K. Kong A.N. Samelson L.E. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5438-5446Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Eight to 10 h after DNA transfection, HeLa cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 1% Brij 96 (Sigma), 25 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaF, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml Pepstatin-A, and aprotinin (15-30 trypsin inhibitory unit/ml). The lysates were incubated for 10 min on ice and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4°C. Supernatants were divided and immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody against VSV G (I1) (33Lefrancois L. Lyles D.S. Virology. 1982; 121: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) or a monoclonal anti-myc antibody (9E10) (34Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2157) Google Scholar) and protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer, and in vitro kinase assays were performed in a volume of 40 μl containing 30 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mM MnCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, and 10 μCi of [ γ-32P]ATP. Phosphorylated proteins were subjected to electrophoresis on a 7.5% acrylamide SDS gel and analyzed by autoradiography.ImmunoblottingA portion of post-nuclear lysates from transfected cells was mixed with Laemmli reducing sample buffer, separated on a 7.5% acrylamide SDS gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with polyclonal antisera against VSV or mouse JAK2 (Santa Cruz). Proteins were detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) and a chemiluminescence detection system (DuPont-NEN).RESULTSWe were interested in identifying structural features required for the interaction of cytokine receptors with the JAK family of tyrosine kinases. Our approach was to compare and contrast the interaction of three cytokine receptors, the GH-R, the EPO-R, and the IL-6 receptor signal-transducing protein gp130, with the JAK1 and JAK2 kinases. This approach would allow us to determine what common features of these receptors are required for interaction with JAK kinases.Chimeric receptor proteins were generated that contained the cytoplasmic domains of the GH and EPO receptors or gp130 fused to the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the VSV G protein (Fig. 1A). This allowed us to utilize a single monoclonal antibody (I1) (33Lefrancois L. Lyles D.S. Virology. 1982; 121: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) for assessing JAK kinase association with the receptor cytoplasmic tails. Although replacement of the ligand binding domain of the GH and EPO receptors with regions of the VSV G protein prevented us from activating the chimeric cytokine receptors with their cognate ligands, we reasoned that the ability of VSV G to form stable trimers via interactions involving its extracellular domain (35Kreis T.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1986; 46: 929-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) might mimic ligand-induced cytokine receptor dimerization(1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4583) Google Scholar).The chimeric receptors were transiently expressed in HeLa cells using the vaccinia-T7 expression system(36Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1864) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting studies demonstrated that the VSV G/growth hormone receptor (G/GH-R), the VSV G/erythropoietin receptor (G/EPO-R), and the VSV G/gp130 (G/gp130) fusion proteins migrated with mobilities by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis consistent with their predicted relative molecular masses of 130, 100, and 105 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1B, lanes 11, 13, and 15).The ability of chimeric GH-R, EPO-R, and gp130 proteins to form complexes with JAK2 was then tested. Anti-VSV G immunoprecipitates prepared from HeLa cells expressing the chimeric receptor proteins alone did not contain detectable JAK2 autokinase activity (Fig. 1B, lanes 3, 5, and 7). However, anti-VSV G immunoprecipitates of HeLa cells co-expressing JAK2 and either of the chimeric receptors contained an abundant kinase activity that resulted in the phosphorylation of a 130-kDa protein (arrow), consistent with the predicted relative molecular mass of JAK2 (Fig. 1B, lanes 4, 6, and 8). The interaction was specific for G/GH-R, G/EPO-R, and G/gp130 since JAK2 failed to coprecipitate with a control VSV G chimeric protein, GZeta (31Timson Gauen L.K. Kong A.N. Samelson L.E. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5438-5446Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B, lane 2). Immunoblotting with JAK2 antibodies confirmed that the 130-kDa phosphoprotein immunoprecipitated with the chimeric receptors was JAK2 (data not shown). We also noted an additional phosphorylated substrate that migrated with a mobility consistent with the predicted relative molecular mass of the G/EPO-R and G/gp130 chimeric receptors. In vitro kinase reactions of G/EPO-R and G/gp130 immunoprecipitates contained phosphorylated bands of relative molecular mass 100 and 105 kDa, respectively. No additional phosphorylated substrates were observed from in vitro kinase reactions of G/GH-R immunoprecipitates. We suspect that the 130-kDa band in these immunoprecipitates represents phosphorylated, co-migrating JAK2 and G/GH-R proteins. These data demonstrate that the interaction between JAK2 and the GH and EPO receptors and gp130 can be reconstituted by co-expression in HeLa cells and occurs via the cytoplasmic domains of these receptors.JAK2 Sequences Required for Association with Cytokine ReceptorsWilks and co-workers have proposed that the JAK kinases be divided into seven domains designated JAK homology (JH) domains 1 through 7(13Harpur A.G. Andres A.C. Ziemiecki A. Aston R.R. Wilks A.F. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1347-1353PubMed Google Scholar). JH1 corresponds to the tyrosine kinase domain and JH2 corresponds to the putative serine-threonine kinase domain. The domains, JH3 through JH7, are noncatalytic domains and have no known function. To test whether the ability of JAK2 to associate with cytokine receptors was mediated by sequences contained within the tyrosine kinase (JH1) domain, the JH1 domain of JAK2 was replaced with an epitope tagged (myc) tyrosine kinase domain from p59fyn(31Timson Gauen L.K. Kong A.N. Samelson L.E. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5438-5446Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This modification permitted us to use the kinase activity of the modified JAK2 to detect its presence in vitro and also allowed us to use a monoclonal antibody specific for the myc epitope (9E10) for immunoprecipitation of JAK2fyn (34Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2157) Google Scholar). This was necessary as our deletional analysis would result, in some cases, in the removal of the epitope recognized by the JAK2 antibody. We first tested the ability of JAK2fyn to associate with the G/GH-R. JAK2fyn autokinase activity was easily detected in VSV G immunoprecipitates from cells co-expressing G/GH-R and JAK2fyn (Fig. 2B, lane 12). Specific sequences in the JH1 domain, therefore, are not required for JAK2 association with the GH receptor.Figure 2:The noncatalytic domains JH3-JH7 of JAK2 mediate association with the growth hormone receptor. A, schematic diagram of JAK2fyn mutants. Open boxes represent mouse JAK2 segments. Closed boxes represent mouse p59fyn tyrosine kinase domain. Dashed lines designate deleted regions of mouse JAK2. Numbers at left refer to amino acid residues of mouse JAK2 protein at which internal deletions were made. Numbers at the bottom indicate relative positions of JAK homology domains (nomenclature of Harpur et al.(13Harpur A.G. Andres A.C. Ziemiecki A. Aston R.R. Wilks A.F. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1347-1353PubMed Google Scholar)). B, in vitro kinase reactions of anti-myc immunoprecipitates (lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11) or anti-VSV G immunoprecipitates (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12). HeLa cells were transfected with cDNAs for G/GH-R and for JAK2fyn mutants Δ552-828 (lanes 1 and 2), Δ3-295 (lanes 3 and 4), Δ77-295 (lanes 5 and 6), Δ296-828 (lanes 7 and 8), Δ371-828 (lanes 9 and 10) or JAK2fyn (lanes 11 and 12). Cells were lysed in 1% Brij 96, and the detergent-soluble extract was immunoprecipitated with anti-VSV G or anti-myc antibodies. In vitro kinase reactions were separated on a 7.5% acrylamide-SDS gel and analyzed by autoradiography. Migration of prestained molecular mass markers (kilodaltons) is indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine which domain(s) of JAK2 mediates its interaction with the cytoplasmic region of the GH receptor, we generated the panel of JAK2 deletion mutants depicted schematically in Fig. 2A. HeLa cells were co-transfected with the G/GH-R chimera and cDNAs corresponding to the various JAK2 mutants. Complex formation was assessed by measuring GH receptor-associated JAK2fyn autokinase activity. The first deletion mutant generated, Δ552-828, lacked residues encoding the JH2 domain in addition to the JH1 domain. Deletion of this domain, however, had no effect on the ability of JAK2 to bind the GH receptor (Fig. 2B, lane 2). Association of JAK2 with the GH receptor, therefore, does not require either the JH1 or JH2 domains and must therefore be mediated by the noncatalytic domains, JH3 through JH7.Amino-terminal sequences of the src family kinases are not conserved and have been shown to be critical for association with receptor proteins(31Timson Gauen L.K. Kong A.N. Samelson L.E. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5438-5446Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 37Shaw A.S. Amrein K.E. Hammond C. Stern D.F. Sefton B.M. Rose J.K. Cell. 1989; 59: 627-636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Because the amino-terminal sequences of members of the JAK kinase family are also not conserved, we next tested whether the amino terminus of JAK2 was required for interaction with cytokine receptors. A construct that lacks the JH6 and JH7 domains (Δ3-295) did not co-precipitate with the G/GH-R protein (Fig. 2B, lane 4), suggesting that sequences within the JH6 and JH7 domains were critical for association with the GH receptor and also demonstrated that the p59fyn tyrosine kinase domain was not able to mediate the interaction by itself. The JH6 and JH7 domains were not, however, sufficient by themselves to facilitate the interaction of JAK2 with the G/GH-R protein. A JAK2fyn mutant, Δ296-828, which contains only the JH6 and JH7 domains, and another JAK2fyn mutant, Δ371-828, which contains the JH5 domain and half of the JH4 domain in addition to the JH6 and JH7 were unable to co-precipitate with the chimeric GH receptor (Fig. 2B, lanes 8 and 10, respectively). These data indicate that the interaction between JAK2 and the GH receptor is not mediated by any individual JAK homology domain but suggest instead that multiple JH domains must interact together to allow association with cytokine receptors.Chimeric JAK Kinases Do Not Associate with Cytokine ReceptorsIt is possible that the failure of some of the JAK2fyn deletion mutants to interact with the G/GH-R protein may have been due to perturbations in the tertiary structure of JAK2fyn caused by the removal of internal protein sequences. To identify JAK protein domains involved in cytokine receptor interaction and to minimize potential problems created by the deletional analyses, we chose to generate chimeric JAK kinases. First, however, we needed to identify a JAK kinase that could not interact with the GH receptor. Studies of Argetsinger et al.(17Argetsinger L.S. Campbell G.S. Yang X. Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Carter S.C. Cell. 1993; 74: 237-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar) and Witthuhn et al.(18Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Silvennoinen O. Yi T. Tang B. Miura O. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1993; 74: 227-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that receptors for GH and EPO interact specifically with JAK2. We directly tested whether JAK1, a kinase closely related to JAK2, could associate with the GH and EPO receptors by generating a JAK1fyn molecule, in a manner similar to JAK2fyn, and co-expressing it with the G/GH-R or G/EPO-R receptor chimeras in HeLa cells. Although abundant JAK2fyn kinase activity was detected in G/GH-R and G/EPO-R immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3B, lane 2, and data not shown), no detectable JAK1fyn kinase activity was observed co-precipitating with the G/GH-R or G/EPO-R proteins (Fig. 3B, lane 1, and data not shown). The JAK1fyn protein, however, was"

This study examines the possible organizing role of perinatal gonadal steroids in the manifestation of known, albeit unexplained, male-female differences in basal and stress-related adrenocortical secretion. We document here the existence of gender-specific differences in the gene expression of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), and hippocampal and hypothalamic glucocorticoid receptors (GR), diurnal corticosterone secretion, as well as in the responsiveness of CRH and GR mRNA levels to exogenous estradiol. In addition, we report that neonatal estrogenization of female rats profoundly affects several regulatory substrates of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, namely, the gene expression of CRH, arginine-vasopressin (AVP) and GR in the brain, and the responsiveness of these parameters to estrogen. The neonatal treatment appeared to ""defeminize"" a number of neuroendocrine mechanisms related to HPA function; these changes were reminiscent of those observed in earlier studies on sexual differentiation of reproductive behavior and hormonal secretion. The results indicate a pivotal role for estrogens during early development for the determination of gender-specific differences in HPA function in the mature animal and demonstrate for the first time that the brain-organizing actions of gonadal steroids may extend to nonreproductive neuroendocrine axes."
https://openalex.org/W2012641207,"Fertilization of mature mouse oocytes triggered highly repetitive Ca2+ oscillations lasting 2-3 h. However, immature oocytes generated only two or three oscillations, which ceased within 1 h. Development of repetitive Ca2+ transients to sperm occurred late in oocyte maturation and was dependent on cytoplasmic modifications that were independent of cell cycle progression from metaphase I to metaphase II. Immature oocytes released significantly less Ca2+ from stores than mature oocytes in response to ionomycin and thapsigargin. Ryanodine had no effect on intracellular Ca2+ in maturing oocytes but stimulated an increase in Ca2+ in mature oocytes. The ability of ryanodine to increase Ca2+ levels was, however, strain-dependent. Preincubation of oocytes with thapsigargin or ryanodine significantly attenuated the normal fertilization Ca2+ response, causing a decrease in the number and the rate of rise of the transients. The inhibition of sperm-induced Ca2+ transients by ryanodine was independent of its ability to cause an immediate Ca2+ increase. Low concentrations of ryanodine had no effect on resting Ca2+ levels but inhibited Ca2+ oscillations at fertilization. Similarly Ca2+ oscillations were blocked in oocytes from a strain of mouse that showed no immediate Ca2+ increase with ryanodine. These results suggest that modifications in Ca2+ stores and ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release mechanisms during oocyte maturation play an important role in Ca2+ oscillations at fertilization."

Here we demonstrate that micromolar levels of arachidonic acid inhibit glutamate uptake mediated by EAAT1, a human excitatory amino acid transporter widely expressed in brain and cerebellum, by reducing the maximal transport rate approximately 30%. In contrast, arachidonic acid increased transport mediated by EAAT2, a subtype abundantly expressed in forebrain and midbrain, by causing the apparent affinity for glutamate to increase more than 2-fold. The results demonstrate that the response of different glutamate transporter subtypes to arachidonic acid could influence synaptic transmission and modulate excitotoxicity via positive or negative feedback according to the transporter(s) present in a particular region.

Reuptake of L-glutamate in brain is mediated by a recently isolated family of membrane proteins(1Storck T. Schulte S. Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Because of its role as an excitatory neurotransmitter, regulation of the L-glutamate concentration in the synaptic space is critical for normal neurotransmission (for review see (4Nicholls D. Attwell D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 462-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar)). Another important aspect of glutamate transport relates to its role in limiting neurotoxicity, which results from elevated levels of this transmitter during ischemia(5Choi D.W.

However, previous studies of arachidonic acid actions on glutamate transport have relied upon experimental systems, which are likely to reflect the activity of multiple subtypes of transporters such as brain slice and synaptosomal preparations (13Chan H.P.

The present study characterizes the actions of arachidonic acid on three cloned human brain glutamate transporter subtypes (6Arriza J.L. Fairman W. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) expressed in Xenopus oocytes and reveals a heretofore unknown heterogeneity in the transporter response to arachidonic acid. Capped RNA was transcribed from linearized pOTV plasmids containing the coding region of EAAT1-3 (6Arriza J.L. Fairman W. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using T7 polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). 50 ng of RNA was injected into stage V oocytes, and experiments were performed 2-6 days later. Stably transformed HEK-293 cells expressing various EAATs were obtained by transfection with pCEP4ΔE constructs that confer hygromycin resistance and utilize the cytomegalovirus promoter to drive transporter expression. pCEP4ΔE was derived from pCEP4 (Invitrogen) by restriction digest with EcoRV and StuI and religation to delete the EBNA-1 gene and OriP. EAAT coding sequences were isolated as KpnI/BamHI fragments and subcloned into pCEP4ΔE. HEK-293 cells stably transformed with the pCEP4ΔE-EAAT plasmids were selected using hygromycin (Sigma) at a concentration of 250 μg/ml. Uptake was measured in control (uninjected) oocytes and in oocytes expressing EAAT1-3 during a 10-min incubation in ND-96 buffer (96 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM HEPES pH 7.4) containing 10 μML-[3H]glutamate. Radiolabeled L-glutamate (Amersham) was diluted with an appropriate concentration of unlabeled L-glutamate to give a final specific activity of 100 μCi/μmol. Uptake was terminated by three rapid washes in ice-cold buffer followed by lysis in 0.1% SDS and scintillation counting. Uptake assays were performed in transfected HEK-293 cells grown to a density of approximately 105 cells/well by incubation with 10 μML-[3H]glutamate in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 10 min followed by three washes in ice-cold buffer. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were made with an Axon Instruments Geneclamp interfaced to a Macintosh computer with a MacLab 2E analog/digital converter (ADInstruments, Milford, MA). Oocytes were voltage-clamped at −60 mV and continuously superfused with ND-96 recording solution or solution containing test compounds at various concentrations. The normalized mean concentration response of currents induced by L-glutamate was fitted by least squares to the equation, I = Imax([Glu]/([Glu] + Km). Km values are expressed as mean ± S.E from fits to individual oocytes. The effects of arachidonic acid on glutamate-induced currents were determined by co-application as indicated by bars above current traces. The percentage decrease (EAAT1) or increase (EAAT2) in the transport current was calculated by comparing the current amplitudes induced by 30 μML-glutamate co-applied with varying concentrations of arachidonic acid to the control transport current amplitudes in the same oocytes. Data were fitted to the expression, % change = % changemax([arachidonic acid]n/([arachidonic acid]n+ K0.5n). K0.5 values are expressed as mean ± S.E. from fits to individual oocytes. Experiments were repeated in batches of oocytes from five different frogs. Arachidonic acid (Calbiochem) was stored in 100 mM stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide and dissolved in recording solution by sonication immediately prior to use. All other compounds were from Sigma. Xenopus oocytes were injected with cRNAs encoding the human excitatory transporters EAAT1, EAAT2, and EAAT3(6Arriza J.L. Fairman W. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inward transport current resulting from superfusion of 30 μML-glutamate in voltage-clamped oocytes expressing EAAT1 was decreased 20-30% by co-application of 100 μM arachidonate (Fig. 1). In contrast, the transport current mediated by EAAT2 was increased approximately 2-fold by arachidonate, while the EAAT3 current was increased only slightly (Fig. 1). Both the inhibition and the increase in transport currents had a rapid onset and reversed slowly upon washout of arachidonate (Fig. 1). These effects were due to specific interaction with the transporters, as application of arachidonate alone or with glutamate did not induce a current in uninjected oocytes (Fig. 1). In addition, arachidonate alone did not induce any current in oocytes expressing the transporters nor were the glutamate transport currents altered by co-application of vehicle (0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide) with glutamate (not shown). In order to determine whether the arachidonate-induced changes in transport currents mediated by EAAT1 and EAAT2 resulted from changes in glutamate uptake, measurements were made of radiolabeled L-glutamate transport mediated by these subtypes. Uptake of 10 μML-[3H]glutamate into oocytes expressing the transporters was linear for at least 20 min and was increased 10-100-fold over control (uninjected or water-injected) oocytes. In agreement with voltage clamp measurements, addition of arachidonic acid (100 μM) resulted in differential effects on the transporters (Fig. 2). Specific uptake in oocytes expressing EAAT1 was decreased from 275 ± 9 to 210 ± 10 fmol/oocyte/s (mean ± S.E. n = 6). In contrast, uptake in oocytes expressing EAAT2 was increased from 75 ± 6 to 143 ± 11 fmol/oocyte/s (n = 6; Fig. 2). Similar effects were seen in measurements of 10 μML-[3H]glutamate into the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK-293 stably transfected with EAAT1 or EAAT2. Co-application of 100 μM arachidonate reduced EAAT1-mediated uptake from 158 ± 8 to 123 ± 9 pmol/105 cells (n = 6), while uptake of L-[3H]glutamate mediated by EAAT2 was increased from 120 ± 6 to 175 ± 6 pmol/105 cells (n = 6). The background in control (non-transfected) cells was not significantly changed by addition of arachidonate (10.9 ± 1.0 control versus 9.9 ± 1.0 pmol/105 cells; n = 6).Figure 2:Arachidonic acid inhibits uptake of L-[3H]glutamate into oocytes expressing EAAT1 and stimulates uptake mediated by EAAT2. Uptake in control (uninjected) oocytes was unaffected by arachidonic acid.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The effects of arachidonate on transport in oocytes expressing EAAT1 and EAAT2 were dose-dependent and saturable. The K0.5 for the maximal inhibition of the EAAT1 current was 16 ± 6 μM, while the K0.5 for maximal increase of the EAAT2 current was 59 ± 6 μM (n = 5; Fig. 3, A and B). The kinetic mechanism underlying the modulation of transport was investigated by analyzing the effect of arachidonic acid on the glutamate concentration response. Co-application of 100 μM arachidonic acid with varying doses of glutamate to oocytes expressing EAAT1 resulted in a 29 ± 1% decrease in the maximal current relative to control, while the apparent affinity for glutamate was not significantly altered (Km = 42 ± 3 versus 37 ± 1 μM, n = 5; Fig. 4A). In contrast, the EAAT2 transport currents were enhanced via a decrease in the transport affinity constant for glutamate from 36 ± 7 to 14 ± 1 μM (n = 5; Fig. 4B).Figure 4:Differential effects of arachidonic acid on transport kinetic parameters for EAAT1 (A) and EAAT2 (B). Data points representing normalized mean ± S.E. for 5 oocytes were fit to I = Imax([Glu]/([Glu] + Km). A, co-application of 100 μM arachidonic acid reduced the maximal EAAT1 current 29 ± 1% without significantly changing the apparent affinity for glutamate. B, glutamate concentration dependence of EAAT2 transport currents was shifted by 100 μM arachidonic acid from 36 ± 7 to 14 ± 1 μM without significantly affecting the Imax.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The pharmacological mechanism of action of arachidonic acid was investigated by testing structural analogues and inhibitors of its metabolism. The increase in EAAT2-mediated transport of 10 μML-glutamate caused by 100 μM arachidonic acid was compared with equal concentrations of linolenic, linoleic, or arachidic acid. The order of efficacy relative to arachidonic acid was linolenic acid (91 ± 21%) > linoleic acid (49 ± 9%) » arachidic acid (1 ± 5%; n = 3). The same rank order of efficacy relative to arachidonic acid was observed for inhibition of EAAT1: linolenic (109 ± 19%) > linoleic (43 ± 14%) » arachidic (5 ± 5%; n = 3). Neither the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (100 μM) nor the lipoxygenase inhibitor nordihydroguaritic acid (50 μM) affected arachidonate inhibition of EAAT1 (n = 3) or stimulation of EAAT2 (n = 6). These results, together with the rapid onset of modulation (Fig. 1), suggest that both effects on glutamate transport are mediated directly by arachidonic acid itself, rather than via a metabolite. Arachidonic acid has been proposed to be a messenger molecule that influences synaptic transmission released by synaptic activation of ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors(8Dumuis A.

In one well defined system, the salamander retinal Mueller cell, arachidonic acid directly inhibits glutamate transport currents(16Barbour B. Szakowski M. Ingledew N. Attwell D.

In accord with this result, a transcript encoding a glutamate transporter homologous to EAAT1 is highly abundant in these cells, and expression of this salamander transporter in Xenopus oocytes confirms that it is negatively modulated by arachidonate. 2N.

The present results suggest the possibility that arachidonic acid could differentially influence the rate of clearance of synaptically released glutamate, which can in turn influence the kinetics of glutamatergic transmission at some synapses(21Mennerick S.

The transfer activity is found within the lumen of microsomes isolated from the liver and intestinal mucosa. MTP has a unique structure compared with other characterized lipid transfer proteins. It is a heterodimer containing subunits of molecular mass 58 and 97 kDa (Wetterau et al., 1991a). Other intracellular mammalian lipid transfer proteins characterized to date are single polypeptides with molecular masses ranging from 11 to 36 kDa (Wirtz, 1991). The 58-kDa component of MTP has been identified as the multifunctional protein, protein disulfide isomerase (Wetterau et al., 1990). The large 97-kDa subunit possesses the lipid transfer activity or confers lipid transfer activity on the complex. The large subunit of MTP was not detectable in four subjects with the disease abetalipoproteinemia (Wetterau et al., 1992), a rare human genetic disease characterized by a defect in very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicron assembly (reviewed in Gregg and Wetterau(1994)). The discovery of mutations in the gene encoding the large subunit of MTP of subjects with abetalipoproteinemia, which would result in an absence of functional MTP, demonstrates that an absence of MTP causes abetalipoproteinemia and that MTP is required for lipoprotein assembly or secretion (Sharp et al., 1993; Shoulders et al., 1993). microsomal triglyceride transfer protein cholesteryl ester transfer protein triglyceride cholesteryl ester diglyceride monoglyceride phosphatidylcholine phosphatidic acid lysophosphatidylcholine phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylserine phosphatidylinositol R-(Z,Z)-2-[[[2,3-bis[1-oxo-9-octadecenyl-1-oxy] propoxy]ethoxyphosphinyl]oxy]-N,N,N-trimethylethanaminium trifluoromethanesulfonate very low density lipoproteins endoplasmic reticulum small unilamellar vesicles apolipoprotein B. The general scheme for lipoprotein assembly and secretion is well accepted (reviewed in Vance and Vance(1990), Gibbons(1990), Boren et al.(1991), Davis(1993), and Yao and McLeod(1994)). Initial assembly occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where apolipoproteins, cholesterol, phospholipid, and triacylglyceride are synthesized and incorporated into lipoprotein particles. The particles are subsequently transported to Golgi and secreted. However, the sequence of events leading to formation of mature lipoprotein particles in ER lumen is still under investigation. Several reports have suggested that plasma VLDL is assembled by sequential addition of lipids to nascent apolipoproteins (Jenero and Lane, 1983; Higgins and Hutson, 1984; Boström et al., 1988). Although MTP is required for lipoprotein assembly, its exact role in the assembly process is not known. Because MTP transports lipid by a shuttle mechanism (Ping Pong Bi Bi kinetics) (Atzel and Wetterau, 1993a), it has been hypothesized that MTP acts as carrier of lipids from their site of synthesis to nascent lipoproteins within the ER. To further our understanding of the lipid transport properties of MTP and the relationship between lipid structure and MTP-mediated lipid transport, the initial rates of transfer of different classes of neutral lipid and phospholipid from donor to acceptor small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) were measured and compared with the binding of these lipid molecules to MTP. The experiments were performed under conditions where the physiochemical properties of the donor membranes were minimally affected. Therefore, the rate of lipid transfer should reflect the interaction of the lipid molecules with MTP at the membrane surface. In this study, we demonstrated that MTP has a preference for transporting neutral lipids and that the size of the hydrophobic moiety, regardless of the lipid class investigated, plays an important role in the MTP-mediated transfer. In contrast, MTP did not discriminate between different phospholipids. These results were used to further refine our model for the lipid molecule binding and transport site on MTP and provide additional insight into the role of MTP in lipoprotein assembly. 1,2-Dioleoyl-L-3-phosphatidyl-L-[3-14C]serine, 1,2-di[1-14C]oleoyl-L-3-phosphatidylcholine, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-L-3-phosphatidyl[N-methyl-3H] choline, 1,2-dioleoyl-L-3-phosphatidyl[2-14C]ethanolamine, [4-14C]cholesterol, cholesteryl [1-14C]oleate, and L-3-phosphatidyl[U-14C]inositol were obtained from Amersham Corp., and [3H]squalene was obtained from DuPont NEN. All lipids and lipolytic enzymes were obtained from Sigma. Lipids were stored under N2 gas in chloroform at −20°C. MTP was purified from bovine liver by a modification of an earlier published method (Wetterau et al., 1991b) which will be published elsewhere. The purified protein had an activity of 3.0% TG transfer/min/μg of protein in our assay and showed only two bands of apparent molecular masses 88 and 58 kDa on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Laemmli and Favre, 1973). Radiolabeled phosphatidic acid (PA), diglyceride (DG), and lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC) were synthesized enzymatically from 1,2-di[1-14C]oleoyl-L-3-phosphatidylcholine by the action of 25 units of phospholipase D (from Streptomyces chromofuscus, type VI), 2 units of phospholipase C (from Clostridium perfringens, type IX) (Wood and Snyder, 1969), or 2 units of phospholipase A2(from Naja mocambique mocambique), respectively. 1,2-Di(1-[14C]oleoyl)PC (107 mCi/mmol) was dried under a stream of nitrogen gas and dissolved in 1 ml of diethyl ether, 4.3 ml of 17.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 ml of 8 mM CaCl2. All enzymatic reactions were at 30°C for 3 h with vigorous shaking. The lipids were extracted according to the method of Bligh and Dyer(1959). The products were fractionated by thin-layer chromatography on silica gel plates using a petroleum ether/diethyl ether/acetic acid (140:40:8) solvent (solvent A) for DG, or chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/formic acid/water (140:60:24:8:4) solvent (solvent B) for PA or lyso-PC. Radioactivity was scanned on a Betascope 603 blot analyzer (Betagen Corp., Waltham, MA), and bands were identified using unlabeled standards run on the same plate. Radioactive lipid was extracted from the silica gel plate as described by Arvidson(1968). To prepare monoglyceride (MG), 14C-labeled PC was incubated with both phospholipase A2 and phospholipase C (2 units each) and extracted as described above. MG was separated from DG, lyso-PC, and PC on silica gel plates initially developed in solvent B until the solvent front ascended half way up the plate and then in solvent A to the top of the plate. Radioactive MG was identified and extracted as described above. The identity of labeled substrates was confirmed by thin-layer chromatography. 1,2-Di[1-14C]oleoyl-L-3-phosphatidylcholine (100 μCi, 105 mCi/mmol, 0.75 mg, 0.95 μmol) was dissolved in anhydrous chloroform (50 μl). Powdered potassium carbonate (1.31 mg, 9.5 μmol) and ethyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (0.85 mg, 0.62 μl, 4.75 μmol) were added, and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature under argon. Progress of the reaction was followed by radioactive thin-layer chromatography using a chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (75:17.5:5:2.5) solvent system. Radioactivity was scanned on a Berthold Tracemaster 20 automatic TLC linear analyzer (Berthold, Wildbad, Germany). After 2 h, thin-layer chromatography showed there was still a small amount of starting PC remaining, so additional ethyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (0.85 mg, 4.75 μmol) was added. The reaction was complete after stirring for an additional 2 h. The reaction mixture was purified by silica gel column chromatography (J. T. Baker, 60-200 mesh, 0.6 × 30 mm). The column was eluted with 15 ml of 10% methanol in dichloromethane and 15 ml of 20% methanol in dichloromethane. The product fractions were combined and concentrated to give 46 μCi of ethyl [14C]PC (46% radiochemical yield). The radiochemical purity of the product was 97.5% by thin-layer chromatography, and the identity was confirmed by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (thioglycerol/glycerol (1:1)) m/z 818 (M+). Lipid transfer from donor to acceptor membranes was measured in an assay similar to that previously described by Wetterau et al.(1992). Donor and acceptor SUV were prepared by bath sonication in 15 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM (assay buffer). Following sonication, SUV were isolated from larger vesicles by ultracentrifugation at 159,000 × g for 2 h in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge using a modification of the procedure described by Barenholz et al.(1977). The lipid transfer assay mixture contained donor membranes (40 nmol of egg PC, 7.5 mol % cardiolipin, and 0.25 mol % radiolabeled substrate), acceptor membranes (240 nmol of egg PC), and 5.0 mg of bovine serum albumin in a total volume of 0.68 ml of assay buffer. The reaction was started by the addition of MTP (100-3000 ng for different substrates) in 20 μl. The transfer reaction was carried out at two different concentrations of MTP for each substrate. After 60 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of DE52-cellulose (Whatman, Maidstone, United Kingdom) preequilibrated in 15 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1.0 mM EDTA and 0.02% sodium azide (1:1, v/v). The mixture was agitated for 5 min and centrifuged at maximum speed in a Biofuge B centrifuge (Baxter Scientific, McGaw Park, IL) for 3 min to pellet the DE52 containing bound donor vesicles. The recovery of acceptor vesicles after the sedimentation of donor membranes with DE52-cellulose was determined by measuring the concentration of phospholipid using a phosphate assay (Rouser et al., 1966). The recovery of acceptor vesicles from the reaction mixture ranged from 92 to 105%, with a mean of 98 ± 6%. To quantitate lipid transfer, radioactivity in 0.5 ml of supernatant was measured. First order kinetics were used to calculate the lipid transfer rate using the equation [S] = [S]0e-ht (Wetterau and Zilversmit, 1985), where [S]0 and [S] are the fraction of the available labeled lipid in the donor membrane at times 0 and t, respectively, and k is the fraction of the available labeled lipid transferred per unit time. This calculation corrects for the depletion of labeled lipid in donor vesicles which occurs with time. Background transfer of neutral or phospholipid in the absence of MTP were 1-2% or 5-7%/h, respectively. Background transfer in the absence of MTP was subtracted from total transfer to calculate MTP-mediated transfer. To calculate phospholipid transfer, we only used total transfer values which were at least twice that of background. The transfer rates with all substrates were linear up to 20-30% transfer. Four different concentrations of MTP (between 65 and 320 pmol) were incubated with donor vesicles (40 nmol of egg PC, 7.5 mol % cardiolipin, 0.25 mol % [14C]labeled substrate, and a trace of [3H]dipalmitoyl PC) for 2 h at 37°C in assay buffer. At the end of the incubation, the reaction mixture was layered on the top of 3.0 ml of 35% sucrose (prepared in assay buffer) and centrifuged at 412,000 × g for 24 h in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge. Donor membranes floated on the top of the sucrose solution, and MTP sedimented to the bottom of the tube. The bottom 0.5-ml fraction was collected utilizing a tube slicer, and the amount of lipid substrate bound to MTP was quantitated by measuring radioactivity and protein concentrations according to Bradford(1976). Counts in the bottom 0.5-ml fraction in the absence of MTP (background) were 5-15% of the total radioactivity found in the presence of MTP. In the presence of MTP, the counts ranged from 100 to 2000 for the different concentrations of MTP and various lipids investigated. Protein was not detectable in the top fraction. To validate the lipid binding assay, MTP (320 pmol) was incubated with donor vesicles containing 0.25 mol % [14C]TG as described above and then the MTP was isolated from vesicles on a Superose 12 HR (10/30) column using an fast protein liquid chromatography system (Pharmacia, Upsala, Sweden). On this column, vesicles elute in the void volume (7.5 ml), whereas MTP elutes with a elution buffer of 11 ml. The amount of TG bound to MTP was quantitated by measuring radioactivity and protein in each eluted fractions. The amount of TG bound to MTP obtained by this method agreed with the results obtained from the ultracentrifugation method (see results). Donor membranes in the transfer reactions contained small quantities of radioactive substrate (0.25 mol %) in egg PC vesicles. To determine the size of the lipid pool available for transfer, the transfer of [14C]TG or [14C]PC (0.25 mol %) in egg PC vesicles was measured at various concentrations of MTP for 1 h at 37°C (Fig. 1). Assuming that all the neutral lipid is accessible to MTP, the value calculated for the maximum transfer of TG is 86%, since donor vesicles were one-seventh of the total lipid in the assay. In the case of phospholipid substrates, if it is assumed that only the outer monolayer of the bilayer is accessible to MTP and that two-thirds of the phospholipid of an SUV is on the outside monolayer (Huang and Mason, 1978), the estimated value for maximum transfer would be 57% of the total. The values obtained for the maximum transfer of PC and TG were 68 and 95%, respectively, which are comparable with that of the calculated values. This indicates that all the TG and approximately two-thirds of the PC were available for MTP-mediated transfer. The conditions established for TG and PC were used for estimating the available pool sizes of other substrates in the donor membranes. Lipid transfer was measured in the presence of a large excess of MTP (50 μg) at 37°C for 1 h. The results summarized in Table 1 show that with the exception to MG, which was not transferred by MTP, 77-95% of all neutral lipid examined (TG, DG, CE, or squalene) was available for MTP-catalyzed lipid transfer, whereas 54-68% of the phospholipids tested was available for transfer. These results show that most if not all of the neutral lipid in the donor membranes was accessible for transfer by MTP, whereas it appears that phospholipid was evenly distributed between the monolayers of the bilayer and that only the phospholipid distributed on the vesicle surface was available for MTP-mediated transfer. Thus, when measuring the initial transfer rates, the available labeled lipid used for calculating lipid transfer rates (see “Materials and Methods”) was 66% of the total amount present for phospholipid and 100% for neutral lipid.Tabled 1 The ability of MTP to transfer different types of lipids was investigated to determine how changes in the lipid structure affect their transfer by MTP. Donor membranes contained a small amount of substrate (0.25 mol %) so the physical properties of the membranes were minimally affected by different lipid substrates. The initial rates of TG transfer were highest among all neutral and phospholipids examined, suggesting TG is the preferred substrate for MTP. The initial rates of transfer of other lipid substrates were measured and compared with the transfer rate of TG (Fig. 2). The transfer of CE was 66% as fast as TG transfer. The transfer activity of other neutral lipid substrates, DG, cholesterol, or squalene were 10.2 ± 2.0%, 8.5 ± 6.4%, or 6.9 ± 0.2% that of TG, respectively. The transfer activity of PC was lowest and had a rate only 4.1 ± 1.1% that of TG transfer. The relative rates of TG, CE, and PC were consistent with what has been reported previously for a different SUV based assay (Wetterau and Zilversmit, 1985). The effect of adding a polar head group to DG on MTP-mediated lipid transfer was examined (Table 2). As discussed above, the addition of a phosphocholine group to DG (resulting in PC) decreased the transfer rate 60%. This demonstrates that MTP discriminates between neutral lipids and phospholipids. Additional modifications to the head group resulting in zwitterionic PE, or negatively charged PS, PA, and PI, did not change the transfer rate significantly from that of PC (Table 2). These results suggest that there are no specific structural or charge-charge interactions between MTP and the polar head group of the transported phospholipid molecule.Tabled 1 To further test for specific charge-charge interactions between MTP and a transported phospholipid molecule, MTP-mediated transport of a positively charged phospholipid molecule was investigated. A PC analog containing a net positive charge (ethyl-PC) was synthesized by alkylating the phosphate of zwitterionic PC with an ethyl group (Table 2). This addition neutralizes the negative charge on the phosphate. Similar to the results with other phospholipid species tested, the rate of transfer was not affected significantly by a net positive charge in the phospholipid head group (Table 2). These findings indicate that the lipid transport is insensitive to the changes in the structure or charge of the polar moiety of a phospholipid substrate. The ability of MTP to transport lipid molecules containing a different number of hydrocarbon chains was examined. The initial rate of MTP-mediated transfer of TG, DG, and MG (Fig. 3, left panel), PC and lyso-PC (Fig. 3, middle panel), or CE and cholesterol (Fig. 3, right panel) were determined and then expressed as a percent of the transfer rate of the lipid with the highest number of fatty acyl chains in its class. The initial rate of transfer was decreased by 90, 89, or 87% with loss of one acyl chain from TG to DG (Fig. 3A), from PC to lyso-PC (Fig. 3B), or from CE to cholesterol (Fig. 3C), respectively. Lipid transfer by MTP was not detectable when an acyl chain was removed from DG to form MG (Table 1). These results indicate that the number of acyl chains in a lipid molecule plays an important role in the lipid transfer reaction and that an increase in the size of hydrophobic moiety of the lipid substrate by the addition of fatty acyl chains increases its transport by MTP. It has been previously shown that an increase in TG concentration in donor membranes increases both TG binding to MTP and TG mass transfer, whereas the fractional TG transfer rate remains unchanged. This suggests that there is a relationship between the ability of MTP to bind and transport TG (Atzel and Wetterau, 1993b). In this study, the binding of different classes of lipid substrates to MTP was investigated using conditions similar to those used for measuring the initial rates of lipid transport. MTP at various concentrations (between 65 and 320 pmol) was incubated with donor membranes containing 0.25 mol % radiolabeled lipid substrate at 37°C for 2 h. MTP was reisolated by ultracentrifugation, and the amount of radiolabeled lipid bound to MTP was quantitated as described under “Materials and Methods.” TG was bound to MTP at 0.044 mol/mol of MTP (Table 3). The amount of TG bound, as determined by ultracentrifugation, was similar to that obtained when MTP was reisolated by column chromatography (0.039 mol/mol of MTP) (see “Materials and Methods”). This value is also comparable, although somewhat higher than that reported by Atzel and Wetterau (1993b) for similar TG binding experiments performed at 23°C. The amount of lipid bound to MTP decreased in the order of TG > CE > DG > squalene > PC which correlated well with their decreasing rates of transfer. The amount of MG bound to MTP did not correlate with its transfer. A small amount of MG was bound to MTP (that of TG), but MTP did not transfer this lipid from donor to acceptor membranes. Using the data from Fig. 2 and Table 3, the ratio of lipid bound per MTP molecule was plotted against the relative transfer rates of the different lipid substrates (Fig. 4). A linear relationship between substrate binding to MTP and relative transfer rates was observed with a correlation coefficient of 0.99. This indicates that the ability of MTP to bind different classes of lipid molecules at the membrane surface governs the relative rates at which these lipids are transported between the membranes.Tabled 1Figure 4:A linear correlation between the binding of different lipid substrates to MTP and their transfer rates. The lipid transfer activity from Fig. 2 was plotted against amounts of lipid bound to MTP from Table 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The binding of different phospholipids to MTP was also investigated by incubating donor vesicles containing 0.25 mol % [14C]phospholipid substrate and a trace of [3H]dipalmitoyl PC. [3H]dipalmitoyl PC binding to MTP was measured as a control. The values for the amount of lipid bound to MTP obtained for the different phospholipid species (see Table 4) were all very similar, analogous to what was found for their transfer rates (Table 2). These results indicate that changes in the structure or charge of the headgroup of a phospholipid molecule do not affect the binding of the phospholipid to MTP.Tabled 1 Using lipid binding assays and kinetic analysis, it has been demonstrated previously that MTP binds and shuttles lipid molecules between membranes (Atzel and Wetterau, 1993a). To further understand the nature of the site or sites on MTP which bind and transport lipid molecules, the rates of MTP-mediated transport of lipid molecules of varying structure were compared. For the transfer reactions used in this study, donor membranes contained PC, 7.5 mol % cardiolipin, and a trace (0.25 mol %) of the lipid studied. Acceptor membranes contained PC. Trace quantities of the lipid studied were used so that the effect of the lipid on the physical properties of the membranes was minimal. Thus, the transport rates should reflect the interaction between MTP and the lipid molecules in the membrane once MTP is bound to the membrane surface. For our analysis, it was assumed that the radiolabeled lipid molecules were equally distributed between the monolayers of the bilayer membrane of the donor vesicles and that only the phospholipid molecules on the surface of the monolayer were available to MTP, whereas all of the nonpolar lipid molecules were available to MTP. This was confirmed for both broad classes of lipid investigated. The maximum transfer observed in the presence of excess MTP was 54-68% for all phospholipid species investigated, comparable with the calculated maximum transfer of 57%. In contrast to the polar lipids, all of the neutral lipids were accessible to MTP as the maximum transfer (range 77-95%) was similar to the maximum calculated transfer (86%), assuming all the lipid was available. This is consistent with the previous findings that uncharged lipid molecules rapidly diffuse between the two monolayers of a phospholipid bilayer, whereas charged lipids slowly diffuse (for review see Zachowski(1993)). Thus, to calculate transfer, the available pool size for phospholipid was reduced to 66% of the total for phospholipid and assumed to be 100% for neutral lipid. This may underestimate the transfer rates for neutral lipid in that at any given time, only two-thirds of the neutral lipid would be found on the vesicle surface. With the exception of MG, MTP catalyzed the transfer of every lipid species investigated. Under the experimental conditions utilized in these studies, MTP had clear preferences for the lipid molecules it transferred. These trends undoubtedly reflect the structure of the site on MTP which binds and transports the lipid molecules, and thus these results provide insights into the nature of the lipid binding pocket on MTP. MTP displayed a distinct preference for transporting neutral lipids when compared with polar lipid. For all classes of lipid molecules studied, transfer was directly related to the hydrophobicity of the molecules. For example, the addition of a fatty acyl chain or chains to MG, cholesterol, or lyso-PC dramatically increased their transfer rates (Fig. 3). MTP binds and transports both neutral lipids and phospholipids. Although MTP may accommodate a polar head group, it slows the rate of MTP-mediated transport when compared with a more hydrophobic molecule without the charged head group. However, neither the nature nor the charge of the head group of the phospholipid molecules investigated had any effect on MTP mediated lipid transport. Although MTP binds and transports lipid molecules containing polar head groups, there does not appear to be any specific interactions between the head groups and MTP. Thus, the lipid binding pocket on MTP which binds and transports lipid appears to be hydrophobic in nature; however, it is able to accommodate the polar head groups of phospholipid molecules. It is quite flexible in the nature of the molecules it can bind, suggesting there are minimal specific interactions between the lipid molecules and MTP. In addition, the rate of transport of different lipid classes parallels the binding of these lipids to MTP (Fig. 4). This suggests that the binding of lipid to MTP is the rate-determining step in the MTP-mediated lipid transport process. Phospholipid binding to MTP was investigated by incubating donor vesicles containing 0.25 mol % [14C]phospholipid substrate and a trace of [3H]dipalmitoyl PC. If one assumes [3H]dipalmitoyl PC or [14C]dioleoyl PC are representative of all the PC in the donor vesicles, the binding of PC to MTP was 1.4-1.6 mol/mol of MTP, comparable with the values reported for binding experiments performed at 23°C (Atzel and Wetterau, 1993b). This suggests that MTP has at least two phospholipid binding sites. Numerous other proteins bind lipid molecules. These proteins can be divided into two classes, those that bind multiple lipid molecules without defined binding sites (for example plasma apolipoproteins or vitellogenin) and those that have specific sites that bind individual lipid molecules. The latter category includes fatty acid-binding proteins and serum albumin which bind fatty acid and lipid transfer proteins which bind a variety of lipid molecules. These proteins display varying preferences for the lipid molecules they bind. Shoulders et al.(1994) proposed that MTP is a member of the vitellogenin family. However, vitellogenin is more hydrophobic in nature than MTP and unlike MTP, it forms a large lipid binding cavity which simultaneously binds multiple lipid molecules. There is no apparent sequence homology between MTP and other known proteins, including triglyceride lipase, cholesteryl esterase, and cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP), whose functions involve binding nonpolar lipids. CETP is functionally related to MTP in its ability to catalyze the transport of neutral lipids between lipoproteins (Swenson et al., 1988). However, similar to vitellogenin, CETP is more hydrophobic in nature than MTP and binds multiple PC molecules (up to 11 mol of PC/mol of CETP) (Swenson et al., 1988). Thus, it appears that CETP does not have defined binding sites for PC. The lipid specificity of MTP suggests it may have properties in common with lipases. Among these, fungal lipase (reviewed in Derewenda and Sharp(1993)) and pancreatic lipase (Verger, 1984) are 1,3-sn-specific triacylglyceride hydrolases. Lipoprotein lipase, although relatively specific for TG, is capable of hydrolyzing phospholipid in TG-rich lipoproteins (Deckelbaum et al., 1992; Shirai et al., 1983), whereas mammalian hepatic lipase shows a very broad substrate spectrum which includes phospholipids and neutral lipids (reviewed in Derewenda and Sharp(1993)). Thus, the character of the lipid binding site on MTP may resemble more the catalytic site of a lipase which has a broad specificity of lipid binding than the more selective lipid transfer proteins. The lipases characterized to date share common structural features. Brzonzowski et al.(1991) have demonstrated using crystallographic data that the neutral lipid binding site of fungal Rhizomucor miehei triacylglycerol lipase is buried within the protein. A helical flap structure (lid) which covers the binding site is displaced during the conformation change associated with lipid binding. The conformational change exposes the hydrophobic side of the lid and expands the nonpolar surface around the catalytic site. The opening of a lid-like structure is a common feature of fungal lipases, pancreatic lipases, hepatic lipases, and lipoprotein lipases (reviewed in Hide et al.(1992)). Whether MTP contains a buried site covered by a lid-like structure remains to be determined. MTP is required for the assembly of plasma VLDL and chylomicrons (Sharp et al., 1993; Shoulders et al., 1994)). Presumably it transports newly synthesized lipid from the ER membrane to apolipoprotein B containing particles in the lumen of the ER. MTP transports TG, CE, and phospholipid, all of which are components of VLDL and chylomicrons. Whether all lipid in the mature lipoprotein particle, or only a portion, is complexed to apoB through MTP-mediated transport is not known. If MTP-mediated transport plays a major role in coupling phospholipid to apoB, then the phospholipid composition of newly synthesized VLDL and chylomicrons should reflect the phospholipid composition of the lumenal surface of the ER membrane, because MTP does not discriminate between the various phospholipid species it transports. Of the total phospholipid content of the newly synthesized VLDL isolated from rat liver, 75.5% is PC and 2.6% is PE (Vance and Vance, 1985). In contrast, PE in the rough or smooth microsomes is approximately 25% of the total phospholipid (Bollen and Higgins, 1980), and two-thirds of that is located on the lumenal surface of the membrane (Hutson and Higgins, 1982). Characterization of rat MTP indicated that like bovine MTP, it transports PC and PE at similar rates (data not shown). Thus, the phospholipid composition of newly synthesized VLDL does not appear to be controlled by the ER membrane composition and the transport properties of MTP, suggesting that other factors must play a role in controlling the phospholipid composition of newly synthesized VLDL. In conclusion, MTP appears to be a unique lipid binding protein. MTP has distinct sites for the molecules it binds in that it has a finite number of lipid molecule binding sites (about two per MTP); however, it binds a very wide variety of molecules and binding does not appear to be controlled by specific protein-lipid interactions, but rather the general hydrophobic nature of the lipid molecule. Our results strongly suggest that the hydrophobic core of the lipid molecule plays the dominant role in promoting its interaction with the transport pocket on MTP. Thus, the lipid binding site on MTP is rather unusual in its properties when compared with previously characterized lipid-binding proteins in that there is a finite number of distinct binding sites, but these binding sites display no strict structural requirements for the lipid molecule they bind and transport.

This work demonstrates that the phage selection techniques enable the rapid identification of highly active and selective protease substrates without making any a priori assumptions about the specificity or the “physiological substrate” of the protease under study. The selectivity of a protease is dictated, in part, by the sequence of amino acids it recognizes in its active site before cleaving the substrate. From a kinetic point of view, the higher the value of the specificity constant kcat/KM(1Fersht A.R. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. Freeman, New York1985: 105-106Google Scholar), the better a peptide is as a substrate for that protease. Highly selective proteases will have high kcat/KM values for only a small number of peptides, whereas a larger number of peptides will have similar kcat/KM values for broad specificity proteases. The identification of the optimized peptide substrates is thus an important part of protease characterization. A time consuming step in protease characterization, however, is finding an optimal substrate.

To overcome these problems, we have made use of filamentous bacteriophage-based peptide display libraries to find optimal substrates. Phage display libraries have been used with great success to find epitopes for monoclonal antibodies and to improve the affinity of peptides for receptors(11Hoess R.H. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Recently Matthews and Wells (13Matthews D.J. Wells J.A. Science. 1993; 260: 1113-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) have presented a method for the use of monovalent “substrate phage” libraries for discovering peptide substrates for proteases. These investigators screened a random pentamer library and isolated clones carrying substrates for Factor X and a mutant form of subtilisin. However, these sequences were not tested as solution phase peptide substrates, and hence the predictive nature of the method was not evaluated. We have been developing an analogous method using polyvalent phage. The approaches presented here have enabled us to screen a greater number of phage (and thus larger libraries), characterize putative substrate clones more quickly, and to generate consensus sequences from these hits. The peptides prepared based on our screen are as good or better substrates than literature standards for the protease being examined. To critically assess the method, we have chosen the MMPs stromelysin and matrilysin as the focus of our studies. The MMPs represent a family of enzymes that recognize at least 6 amino acids in their subsites, as shown by the sensitivity of kcat/KM to the substitution of amino acids in positions P3 to P′3(2Fields G.B.

Using recombinant forms of these enzymes, we have screened a random hexamer library and have used the sequence information from positive clones to prepare new, highly active peptide substrates. The best of these peptides are the most active stromelysin and matrilysin substrates reported to date. In addition, previous investigators have always used peptides no smaller than heptamers in the concern that shorter compounds would not be sufficiently active. With the availability of optimized amino acids at each position, we have demonstrated the opposite: that hexapeptides are superior MMP substrates, a finding not expected at the outset of this study. Finally, the phage data successfully predicted ways in which these substrates could be made selective toward matrilysin or stromelysin. Most importantly, we have demonstrated that we can identify protease substrates without making any a priori assumptions about the specificity or the “physiological substrate” of the enzyme.

The fAFF-TC-LIB-N6 library was constructed by cloning degenerate oligonucleotides (5′-CAGMNNMNNMNNMNNMNNMNNACCACTACCACCGC-3′, where N is A, C, G, T (equimolar) and M is C or A (equimolar)) annealed with an 18 inosine-containing complementary oligonucleotide (ON1439/1440; see Fig. 2C) into KpnI/XhoI-cut fAFF-TC-LIB at a 5:1 oligo/vector molar ratio and electroporating into E. coli MC1061 (F-). 2 × 1010 phage (20 μl of the fTC-LIB-N6 library) in TCB (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM CaCl2, 0.05% Brij-35) in a 250-μl reaction were digested with an empirically determined amount of enzyme for 1 h at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by adding EDTA to 5 mM and then followed by the addition of bovine serum albumin to 0.1%, 100 μg of mAb 179 and 10 μg of mAb3-E7. After 30 min on ice, 100 μl of Pansorbin cells were added, and the reaction was rotated at 4°C for 1 h. The mixture was microfuged for 2 min and the supernatant recovered to repeat the Pansorbin adsorption. The final supernatant was amplified overnight in E. coli K91 cells. A small aliquot of the final supernatant solution was also used for titering on K91. Clones were selected from the titer plates and grown in 2-ml cultures for dot-blot analysis. To precipitate phage, 20 μl of 20% polyethylene glycol, 2.5 M NaCl was added to 100 μl of phage supernatant. After incubating on ice for 30 min, the precipitated phage were microfuged for 5 min. The supernatant was aspirated and the phage resuspended in 10 μl of TBS (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl). The phage were then distributed to wells of a flexible microtiter plate (Falcon). 90 μl of protease/buffer mix (90 μl 1.1 × TCB, 0.3 μl of enzyme) were added and the plate incubated for the appropriate time period at 37°C. At various time points, 30-μl samples were removed and added to 70 μl of TBS + EDTA (to 5 mM final concentration) to stop the reaction. The samples were spotted onto a nitrocellulose filter with a dot-blotter (Bio-Rad) and the filter blocked with 5% non-fat milk in TBS-T (TBS + 0.05% Tween 20) for 30 min to 1 h. The filters were washed three times with TBS-T and then incubated for 1 h with a mAb 179 at 1.9 μg/ml. The washes are repeated and the filters probed with a 1:5000 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugate. After 1 h, the washes were repeated and the filter stained as directed using the Amersham Western Enhanced Chemiluminescence Kit. Synthetic substrates were prepared as peptides blocked at their amino termini by an acetyl group. Peptide 12 (2,4-dinitrophenyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Trp-Ala-D-Arg-NH2) (14Stack M.S. Gray R.D. J. Biol.

Peptides at various concentrations were treated with 20-50 nM protease at 37°C for various times. The initial rates of hydrolysis were determined by measuring the rate of formation of free amino groups using fluorescamine(2Fields G.B. Netzel-Arnett S.J. Windsor L.J. Engler J.A. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6670-6677Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Kinetic parameters were derived by fitting the data to the equation v = (Vmax • {S}/(KM+ {S}) by non-linear regression analysis (Enzfitter), and kcat was determined by dividing Vmax by the concentration of enzyme used. The sites of hydrolysis of selected substrates were determined by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry of the high performance liquid chromatography purified cleavage products. Phage peptide display vectors have been used successfully to identify peptides that bind to proteins such as antibodies. In contrast, the goal of this work is to use this methodology to identify peptides that are efficiently cleaved by a specific protease. In the most commonly used phage display format, the random peptide sequence is placed at or near the NH2 terminus of the display protein, generally pIII(19Cwirla S.E. Peters E.A. Barrett R.W.

In the method described here, we have added an additional functional group to the NH2 terminus of pIII, a peptide “tether.” The tether is a peptide sequence that enables attachment of the phage through binding of the tether sequence to an immobile phase: the simplest example being a peptide epitope tether bound to a monoclonal antibody on an agarose bead. The strategy of the selection is to subject a population of tether phage to the protease in solution, and then separate the cleaved (substrate) from the uncleaved (non-substrate) phage by capturing the undigested phage with a tether-binding resin. A schematic of a variation of this approach, used in this work, is shown in Fig. 1. We have designed and prepared the vector fAFF-tether C (fTC; see “Materials and Methods”) from the fd-derived plasmid fAFF-1(19Cwirla S.E. Peters E.A. Barrett R.W. Dower W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6378-6382Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). The salient features of this phage, shown in Fig. 1 and 2 include the (i) target region, which can consist of random amino acids, or predetermined sequences (i.e. GOOD and BAD, Fig. 2, B and C) for use as positive or negative controls. The design of the control sequences is described below; (ii) the tether region. We have employed a dual tether design, in which the tether consists of the epitopes for the anti-dynorphin mAb 3-E7 (YGGFL) (19Cwirla S.E. Peters E.A. Barrett R.W. Dower W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6378-6382Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar, 20Gramsch C. Meo T. Riethmüller G. Herz A. J. Neurochemistry. 1983; 40: 1220-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and the mAb 179 epitope ACLEPYTACD (see Fig. 2, A and C). A requirement of this approach is that the phage molecule be cleaved only in the “target” random peptide region. Although this is anticipated, as filamentous phage are generally viewed as being protease resistant(26Model P. Russel M. Calendar R. The Bacteriophages. Plenum Press, New York1988: 375-456Crossref Google Scholar), we chose to test this proposal. We prepared two phage clones in fTC, one carrying a good substrate (fTC-Good) sequence for the MMP stromelysin, and one carrying a poor substrate (fTC-Bad) (see “Materials and Methods” and Fig. 1). We were faced with two choices of known substrate sequences for stromelysin: those based on substance P (8Teahan J. Harrison R. Izquierdo M. Stein R.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8497-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 17Niedzwiecki L. Teahan J. Harrison R.K. Stein R.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12618-12623Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) or a sequence based on collagenase cleavage sites(18Netzel-Arnett S. Mallya S.K. Nagase H. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 195: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We chose to build a generic MMP good substrate, Pro-Leu-Ala-Leu-Trp-Ala, based on the results of Netzel-Arnett et al.(16Netzel-Arnett S. Sang Q.X. Moore W.G.I. Navre M. Birkedalhansen H. Van Wart H.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6427-6432Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) that was suitable not only for stromelysin, but matrilysin as well. As shown later, this peptide has a kcat/KM value for sfSTR comparable with substance P (8Teahan J. Harrison R. Izquierdo M. Stein R.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8497-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and a 2,4-dinitrophenyloctapeptide fluorogenic substrate(18Netzel-Arnett S. Mallya S.K. Nagase H. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 195: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The control phage were incubated with sfSTR at various times for up to 1 h. The digests were then analyzed by immunoblot analysis using the anti-tether mAb 179. As shown in Fig. 3A, after exposure to sfSTR, the pIII protein of fTC-Bad was essentially undisturbed, whereas the pIII of fTC-Good lost its tether. This indicates that only the target sequence of the pIII protein was specifically cleaved by sfSTR, and other regions of the protein were untouched. Similar results were observed for the matrilysin (Fig. 3B), tissue plasminogen activator, and HIV protease (using appropriate positive controls; data not shown). In addition, titering of phage (fTC-Good and fTC-Bad) before and after digest showed no effect of proteolysis (with any of the proteases tested) on infectivity (data not shown). To allow us to easily distinguish fTC-Good and fTC-Bad, the tetracycline resistance gene in fTC-Good was replaced with a kanamycin resistance marker (KanR; see “Materials and Methods”). A mock library for testing our selection procedure was prepared by spiking 109 fTC-Bad phage (in 100 μl) with 105 fTC-Good-KanR phage. The mock library was then treated with 1 μg/ml sfSTR for 1 h at 37°C. The reaction was quenched with EDTA and subjected to one round of the selection procedure described under “Materials and Methods.” Various dilutions of the final supernatant solution were titered on both tetracycline (fTC-Bad) and kanamycin (fTC-Good-KanR). In many repetitions of this experiment, the recovery of fTC-Good was always nearly quantitative, whereas there was generally a 100-1000-fold loss of fTC-Bad, depending on experimental conditions. This result suggests that a single round of selection could enrich a rare good substrate over a large background of poor substrate. Of note is the fact that we use two antibodies simultaneously in our selections. Although the method does work if we use either antibody alone, we have found that the combination of mAbs yields consistently lower backgrounds and reduces the number of clones that are unreactive to Ab179 in our screening assays (see below). An important concept in phage display is affinity selection. This involves using limiting levels of receptor or phage proteins in order to isolate phage carrying peptides of high affinity(27Lowman H.B. Bass S.H. Simpson N. Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10832-10838Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 28Barrett R.W. Cwirla S.E. Ackerman M.S. Olson A.M. Peters E.A. Dower W.J. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The analogous approach for a protease selection would be the use of less protease in order to drive the selection toward those clones carrying better substrates (practically speaking, those cleaved at a lower or limiting protease concentrations). As a first test of this proposal, we examined recovery of good phage from the mock library at decreasing protease concentration. As shown in Fig. 4, when the mock library was treated with less sfSTR, the amount of good phage recovered decreased, and in an essentially linear fashion. This result indicates that the use of lower concentrations of proteases could be employed to gain more selectivity (that is, selection of clones that require lower protease concentrations to be cleaved). This is also a useful test for determining starting protease concentrations. By working with protease levels above that which gives ~100% recovery, more protease is being used than is needed. In contrast, use of too low a protease concentration could result in the recovery of too few clones. One purpose of the peptide display approach is to obtain as much information as possible from the peptides while they are on phage, before turning to the use of synthetically prepared substrates. We thus developed a simple and rapid method for determining whether the peptide sequence carried by an fTC clone is a good or bad substrate. We had previously determined that while phage would bind to nitrocellulose, the cleaved tether peptide would not (data not shown). Thus, by simply spotting reaction time points onto a nitrocellulose filter and probing with the anti-tether antibody, we could observe the time-dependent loss of the tether from the phage. As shown for the controls fTC-Good and fTC-Bad in Fig. 5, similar signal intensities are observed for the two phage clones when they were not treated with sfSTR. After 10 or 60 min of protease treatment, however, the intensity of the fTC-Good spots decrease, while no such loss is seen for fTC-Bad. This dot-blot assay is thus useful as a way of monitoring the proportion of positive sequences generated during each round of screening. A library of random hexamers, generated using the DNA sequence (NNK)6(19Cwirla S.E. Peters E.A. Barrett R.W. Dower W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6378-6382Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar) was prepared in fTC-LIB as described under “Materials and Methods.” The library contained 2 × 108 independent recombinants. In the first round, 2 × 1010 tu (about 1000 equivalents of each clone) were treated with sfSTR, subjected to the selection protocol, and the recovered phage were amplified. After each round, 12 clones were analyzed using the phage proteolysis assay. The results of the screening are shown in Table 1. In the first series of screening (rounds A1-A7), the output was not titered before the next round of screening, thus variable amounts of phage were used as input for the succeeding round. In contrast, for series C, the output phage were titered before the next round, and a constant input was used (Table 1). Fig. 5 shows such an analysis for 12 clones chosen randomly from the library and after three rounds of screening in series A. There are no positive phage among the randomly chosen clones (although one is missing or unreactive with the antibody). A number of the clones isolated in round 3, however, appear to be substrates for the enzyme. In later rounds of screening at reduced protease concentrations, a number of clones were found that appeared to be non-reactive with mAb179 prior to sfSTR treatment (see Table 1). Sequence analysis of four of these clones indicated that the epitope encoding sequence has not been altered, and blot analysis showed that the phage were still recognized by mAb 3-E7, indicating that"

Active transport systems are enzymes that convert chemical or physical energy to transmembrane movement rather than to the production of a chemical product. Like other enzymes, transport systems have sites where the transported substrate is recognized and bound. The substrate site is accessible to the side from which uptake occurs. Upon binding of substrate, transport systems undergo a conformation change which seals off the substrate from the presenting side. The substrate enters a path across the membrane and is ultimately released into the compartment on the other side. The conformational changes associated with transport are coupled to both energy and substrate binding; uncoupled movement does not occur(1Jencks W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18855-18858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Active transport systems, like enzymes generally, are inherently reversible. Transport in the reverse direction from that normally observed has been demonstrated for several transport systems when substrate gradients and energy parameters are suitably adjusted(1Jencks W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18855-18858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kepes A. Gunsalus I.C. Stanier R.Y. The Bacteria. Vol. 4.

Therefore, transport systems must have a substrate binding site accessible from each side of the membrane. The two binding sites implied by reversibility of transport may be separate and distinct, with one on each side of the membrane. Kinetic models of active transport systems suggest dual substrate binding sites(1Jencks W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18855-18858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kepes A. Gunsalus I.C. Stanier R.Y. The Bacteria. Vol. 4. Academic Press, New York1962: 179-221Google Scholar). Alternatively, reversible transport could be produced by a single binding site that, like the two-faced Janus, is exposed to either the outside or the inside as determined by the conformation of the transport system. This single site would have two functionally different states even though formed by the same part of the protein, because the conformation of the protein differs depending on which way the site “faces.” Few studies have addressed the question of binding sites in transport systems directly. The three-dimensional structure of no transport system is known. There is only limited evidence as to the regions of a transport system that bind substrate.

Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). These results have been interpreted in terms of the one-site Janus model(5MacLennan D.H. Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Skerjanc I.S. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1992; 146: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We here report a study of substrate binding by the Kdp system, a P-type transport ATPase of Escherichia coli that accumulates K+ in the cell and has high affinity and specificity for K+. P-type transport ATPases are found in all biological kingdoms and mediate transport of a variety of cations(6Pederson P.L. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 146-150Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (822) Google Scholar). All P-type ATPases have a homologous, large membrane-bound subunit, ranging in size from about 70 to 130 kDa, and form an aspartyl-phosphate derivative of the large subunit. The aspartyl-phosphorylated derivative is an energetic intermediate in transport. P-type ATPases differ in their substrates, in their directions of transport and in their subunit composition. Substrates include the monovalent cations H+, Na+, and K+ and the divalent cations Ca2+, Mg2+, Cd2+, and Cu2+. Some of these enzymes export ions from the cytosol, others mediate transport into the cytosol, and several mediate both processes in a concerted reaction. Examples of the latter include the electrically neutral gastric K+,H+-ATPase and the electrogenic Na+,K+-ATPase. Some of these enzymes have only a single large subunit, and others have two, while Kdp is unique as the only P-type ATPase with three protein subunits. Small peptides associated with many of these ATPases may modulate these enzymes, although they do not seem to be necessary for their activity(7Hardwicke P.M.D. Freytag J.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 102: 250-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 8James P.M. Inui M. Tada M. Chiesi M. Carafoli E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21262-21268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The largest subunit of Kdp (for review, see (11Altendorf K. Siebers A. Epstein W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 671: 228-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)), the 72-kDa KdpB protein, is the homolog of the large subunit of other P-type ATPases. Neither of the other subunits, the 59-kDa KdpA protein or the 20.5-kDa KdpC protein, has homologs in other P-type ATPases. KdpA is very hydrophobic with many predicted membrane-spanning segments. KdpC is predicted to have only a single membrane-spanning segment. All three subunits are required for activity, and associate in a structure that is stable to solubilization with non-ionic detergents. KdpF, a hydrophobic 29-residue peptide, may also be a part of Kdp. This peptide is encoded in the same operon as are the three large subunits, and it is known to be expressed(11Altendorf K. Siebers A. Epstein W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 671: 228-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The Kdp complex has been purified to near homogeneity(12Siebers A. Kollmann R. Dirkes G. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12717-12721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and ATP-driven K+ transport has been observed when the Kdp complex is reconstituted in vesicles(13Kollmann R. Altendorf K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Kdp is one of three separate and saturable K+ uptake systems found in E. coli. The other two systems, Trk and Kup (for review see (14Bakker, E. P., (ed) (1992) Alkali Cation Transport Systems in Prokaryotes, pp. 205–224, CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL.Google Scholar)), have affinities for K+ in the vicinity of 1 mM. In wild-type strains, loss of Kdp activity results in only a modest increase in the concentration of K+ needed to achieve rapid growth. When all three systems are lost, a medium concentration of about 25 mM is required to achieve half-maximal growth rate, and growth below about 15 mM is so slow as to be negligible. When only Kdp is present, growth is rapid even in medium containing only μM concentrations of K+ because Kdp has very high affinity for K+. We have exploited the large effects of Kdp on growth in strains lacking Trk and Kup to isolate Kdp mutants that are competent for transport but have markedly reduced affinity for K+. After mutagenesis, penicillin selection killed cells with parental wild-type Kdp activity that grow at 0.1 mM K+. Recovery from the penicillin treatment was in medium containing 5 or 10 mM K+, a medium in which strains lacking Kdp activity do not grow. The selection yielded 37 independent mutants that fit the growth properties of the selection. All of the mutants harbor a Kdp system with markedly reduced affinity for K+. 33 of the mutants alter the KdpA subunit. The amino acid residues altered by the mutations are clustered in four regions of KdpA. Topological analysis indicates that three of the clusters are in periplasmic loops and one of the clusters is in a relatively hydrophobic but cytoplasmic loop of KdpA. From these results we infer that Kdp has two binding sites for K+, both formed by the KdpA protein: an initial binding site in the periplasm and a site in the cytoplasm where K+ is subsequently bound and which may represent the site of K+ occlusion. Mutants were isolated after ultraviolet mutagenesis of strain TK2240 (F-thi lacZ rha nagA trkA405 trkD1) followed by penicillin selection for kdp mutants with reduced affinity for K+ as described(15Polarek J.W. Walderhaug M.O. Epstein W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Only a single mutant with a given phenotype from each of 18 separately mutagenized lots of cells was retained for further study. The mutations were transferred to strain TK2247 (a nadA derivative of TK2240) by P1-mediated transduction with selection for nad+. In most cases the mutant phenotype was expressed by about 15% of the transductants, as expected from the linkage of kdp to nadA. A few mutants seemed to harbor kdp null alleles plus a mutation that partially corrected the Trk defect; these were discarded. A few mutations were cloned into derivatives of pBR322 by shotgun cloning of EcoRI-cut chromosomal DNA; most were cloned with Mini-Mu plasmid pEG5005(16Groisman E.A. Casadaban M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 357-364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clones carrying the kdp region were selected by complementation of strain TK2205 (a Δ(kdpABC)5 derivative of TK2240) to growth at 5 mM K+, or in a few cases of strain TK2230 (a kdpB30 derivative of TK2240) to growth at 0.1 mM K+, which required only expression of a wild-type kdpB gene. The 4.9-kb 1The abbreviation used is: kbkilobase(s). EcoRI fragment that carries kdpABC was cut from the Mini-Mu plasmids and inserted into the EcoRI site of pJD100, a EcoRV-PvuII deletion derivative of pBR322. kilobase(s). Mutations were assigned to genes by complementation and/or recombination with kdp deletions(15Polarek J.W. Walderhaug M.O. Epstein W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Finer mapping was done by recombination with plasmids that divided kdpA into five segments and in a few cases by recombination with M13 clones used in the initial sequence analysis of the region(17Hesse J.E. Wieczorek L. Altendorf K. Reicin A.S. Dorus E. Epstein W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4746-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Five of the mutations were sequenced by the dideoxy method (18Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52748) Google Scholar) with Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) after cloning a 100-400-base pair segment into M13mp7 or M13mp8. The rest were sequenced after cloning into pJD101 by double-stranded sequencing (19Mierendorf R.C. Pfeffer D. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) with Sequenase and primers that hybridize within 200 base pairs of the mutations. Four primers that direct sequencing toward the C terminus were used: Af, bases 284-297; Bf, 589-603; Cf, 967-979; Df, 1311-1325. Two primers that direct sequencing toward the N terminus were used: Ab, 403-417; Cb, 1228-1242 (numbering of bases is that of (17Hesse J.E. Wieczorek L. Altendorf K. Reicin A.S. Dorus E. Epstein W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4746-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar)). The dependence of growth rate at 37°C on medium K+ and initial rates of uptake of K+ and of Rb+ by K+-depleted cells at 30°C were measured as described (15Polarek J.W. Walderhaug M.O. Epstein W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 20Rhoads D.B. Waters F.B. Epstein W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1976; 67: 325-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). All data for Rb+ and a few for K+ are from a single experiment; most of the data for K+ represent the average of at least duplicate experiments. Transport kinetics are based on uptake rates at three or more cation concentrations. For the transport assays, mutants were grown at a K+ concentration that resulted in a growth rate between 50 and 60% of that at high K+, since this results in a nearly full induction of Kdp in the mutants(21Epstein W. Whitelaw V. Hesse J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6666-6668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Laimins L.A. Rhoads D.B. Epstein W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In a few mutants, the ability of Cs+ to inhibit uptake of K+ was also tested, with a K+ concentration at or near the Km and Cs+ concentrations of 10 or 50 mM. Transport rates are expressed per gram (dry weight), determined from turbidity measurements and a calibration curve. The plasmids used to construct fusions are shown in Fig. 1. Protein fusions were constructed in the low copy number plasmids pPAB203, pPAB307, or pPAB404 where expression is under tac promoter control to minimize possible problems due to high level expression of the fusions. pPAB203 was constructed by inserting the PstI fragment from plasmid pCH2 (23Hoffman C.S. Wright A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5107-5111Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) containing the phoA gene without its promoter, signal sequence or first few amino acids, into the PstI site of pJFK118EH (identical to pJF118EH, (24Fürste J.P. Pansegrau W. Frank R. Blocker H. Scholtz P. Bagdasarian M. Lanka E. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 48: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar), but with the multicloning site of pUC19). The resulting plasmid was cut with HindIII, treated briefly with BAL31 nuclease to remove the distal PstI site, and then religated to generate pPAB203. Plasmids pPAB307 and pPAB404 are similar but used the PstI fragment from plasmids pCH39 and pCH40, respectively, to place the PstI site in different reading frames relative to phoA. pKAB101 served as template for the polymerase chain reaction to construct kdpA fragments with a distal in-frame PstI site. The 2.29-kb BclI-HpaI fragment of pWE1001 (17Hesse J.E. Wieczorek L. Altendorf K. Reicin A.S. Dorus E. Epstein W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4746-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) was inserted into pUC19 cut with BamHI and HincII to make pKAB101. The desired fragments were made by using linearized plasmid, a primer just upstream of the EcoRI site and a primer with a PstI site in the proper reading frame just past the desired fusion point with the Gen Amp kit and following the manufacturer's recommended conditions for the polymerase chain reaction (Perkin-Elmer Cetus). The fragments obtained were cut with KpnI and PstI and ligated into pPAB203 that had been cut with the same enzymes. pJLZ104 was used to convert phoA to lacZ fusions. The 4.85-kb SmaI-NruI fragment of pRS414 (25Simons R.W. Houman F. Kleckner N. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 53: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar) was cloned into M13mp18 (26Yanisch-Perron C. Vierra J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar) that had been digested with SmaI and HindII. The resulting construct was digested with EcoRI and HindIII and cloned into similarly digested pJFK118EH to make pJLZ104. lacZ fusions were constructed by digesting a phoA fusion cloned in pPAB203 (or pPAB307, or pPAB404) with EcoRI and DraI (which cuts early in phoA) and ligating the fusion fragment into pJLZ104 cut with EcoRI and SmaI. The lacZ fusions carry residues 14-73 of mature PhoA (residues 6-73 in the case of the fusion at residue 100) prior to joining LacZ at residue 9. The phoA fusion at residue 100 was made by inserting the KpnI-XhoII fragment of pKAB101 into pPAB307 that had been digested with KpnI and BamHI. The phoA fusion at residue 350 was made by cloning the KpnI-NsiI fragment of pKAB101 into pPAB404 digested with KpnI and PstI. All fusions to phoA were confirmed by sequencing over the fusion joint in the backward direction, using as primer a 19-mer oligonucleotide that hybridized to the region of phoA corresponding to amino acid residues 35-41 of mature PhoA. The phoA and lacZ fusions were maintained and studied in strains BW14892 (27Lee K.S. Metcalf W.W. Wanner B. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2501-2510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and XL-1-Blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), respectively. Cells were grown in KML medium (per liter: tryptone, 10 g; yeast extract, 5 g; KCl, 10 g) containing ticarcillin (100 μg ml-1) in the presence of 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. When the cultures reached an OD610 of 0.3-0.4, cells were harvested and alkaline phosphatase and β-galactosidase activities were determined according to Brickman and Beckwith (28Brickman E. Beckwith J. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 96: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and Miller (29Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar), respectively. We prepared filters with bacteria proteins essentially as described by Siebers and Altendorf(30Siebers A. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 178: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 37°C in KML medium containing 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside, harvested by low speed centrifugation, washed in 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), and disrupted by boiling for 5 min in the presence of 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Total proteins were separated electrophoretically on 7.5% polyacrylamide-sodium dodecyl sulfate gels and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes. phoA fusions were detected as described by Mierendorf et al.(31Mierendorf R.C. Percy C. Young R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 458-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) using a polyclonal anti-E. coli alkaline phosphatase antibody (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA) and the Protoblot system (Promega, Madison, WI); blocking and washing were done with a solution containing 0.67 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 0.5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk. A total of 37 independent mutants were isolated as described above. The growth, genetic characteristics, and transport kinetics of the mutants are summarized in Table 1. We refer to these mutants as having a reduced affinity for K+, meaning the apparent affinity as measured by the Km of transport, the concentration of K+ at which uptake is half-maximal. The selection, based on the growth properties, resulted in a series of strains in which the Km for K+ in transport increased to the range from 200 μM to over 50 mM, much higher than the value of 2 μM for wild-type Kdp.Tabled 1 A total of 19 different mutations was obtained; several were obtained more than once. Fifteen of the mutations, representing 33 independent mutants, altered the KdpA subunit, three altered KdpB, and one altered KdpC. The effect of a mutation on the maximum rate of transport depended on the subunit altered by the mutation. All mutations altering KdpA resulted in a Vmax that was at least 30% of the normal rate, while only mutant 57 of the four mutations that altered other subunits had this high a rate. The fact that most mutants selected to have lower affinity for K+ change the KdpA subunit implies that KdpA has a major role in determining affinity for K+. Furthermore, mutations can markedly reduce affinity without much effect on Vmax. The lower number of mutations affecting KdpB or KdpC suggests that there are fewer changes in those subunits that can markedly reduce affinity for K+. Therefore, these two subunits probably have a lesser role in determining affinity for K+ than does the KdpA subunit. Most of the mutations reduced affinity for Rb+ as well, but in a few cases the affinity increased (Table 1). Discrimination between K+ and Rb+ was retained but at a reduced level. The ratio of the Km values for these two ions fell from the 4000-fold difference seen in the wild-type to a ratio of 25 or less. In mutant 13 the ratio of the affinities was 1, indicating that this mutant had lost the ability to discriminate between these ions. The even larger Cs+ ion was able to inhibit K+ uptake in a few of the mutants so tested, suggesting Cs+ is a substrate of Kdp in those mutants. Uptake of Cs+ by wild-type Kdp is not detectable(32Bossemeyer D. Schlösser A. Bakker E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2219-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The sequence analysis showed that the mutations in the kdpA gene were in four regions of the gene that encode residues 114-116, 223-232, 345-369, and 461-469 (Table 1). There is no simple correlation between the change in affinity and either the location or the nature of the change in amino acid residue. All of the residues altered, except for Gly-345, are in extramembraneous regions of the protein (Fig. 2). There are three changes from a neutral to an acidic residue, two changes of neutral to basic, and one from acidic to basic. In the other mutations, where one neutral residue replaces another neutral residue, there is a tendency for the new residue to be less polar. Transition and transversion mutations are almost equally represented among the sequenced mutations, similar to the distribution of ultraviolet light induced mutations in lacI(33Miller J.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 182: 45-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Two examples of a double mutation were obtained. Mutants 78 and 86, whose primary lesion and kinetics are like those of 15, also had a change of C to A at base 682 to replace Leu-228 with Ile. We believe this is a functionally silent change because the growth and transport properties of these two mutants do not seem to differ from those of mutant 15, which retains the wild-type Leu-228. We examined the topology of KdpA in order to determine the locations of the four clusters identified by the mutants. Most protein structure analysis programs based on hydrophobicity predict that KdpA will have 12 membrane spans with 11 extramembraneous regions(34Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17279) Google Scholar, 35Siebers, A., 1988, Potassium Transport in Escherichia coli: Functional, Immunological and Topological Analysis of the Kdp ATPase. Ph.D. thesis, University of Osnabrück, Germany.Google Scholar). To test this model we made protein fusions to phoA, the structural gene for alkaline phosphatase. Alkaline phosphatase is active only when placed in the periplasm, and its location in a fusion appears to be dictated by the site of fusion(23Hoffman C.S. Wright A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5107-5111Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 36Manoil C. Boyd D. Beckwith J. Trends Genet. 1988; 4: 223-226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Fusions were created in each of the predicted extramembrane segments, with two fusions made in each of three of the segments, using the plasmids diagrammed in Fig. 1. The analysis of the fusions suggests the topologic model of KdpA presented in Fig. 2. That figure also shows the residues altered by the mutations of Table 1, and the locations and activities of the protein fusions. The fusions to alkaline phosphatase had either very low activity, often not different from the control, or relatively high activity. Low activity is consistent with fusions to cytoplasmic regions, while high activity suggests fusion to externally exposed regions(36Manoil C. Boyd D. Beckwith J. Trends Genet. 1988; 4: 223-226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These results imply that KdpA has only 9 extramembraneous regions and 10 membrane spans as shown in Fig. 2. The one intermediate level of alkaline phosphatase activity is to residue 336 in a membrane span. Fusions to residues in membrane spans have intermediate levels of activity(37Calamia J. Manoil C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The topologic model predicted by programs based on hydrophobicity includes two additional membrane spans encompassing residues 345-376 and 379-399. The low alkaline phosphatase activity of fusions at residues 375 and 378, which are cytoplasmic in Fig. 2 but would form a small periplasmic loop in the 12-membrane span model, are not consistent with the 12-span model. We considered the possibility that the Glu residue at 370 might have prevented proper insertion of the fusions at residues 375 and 378. Glu-370 is in the middle of membrane span VIII of the 12-membrane span model. Aberrant localization of fusions has been observed in analogous situations in studies of other membrane proteins(37Calamia J. Manoil C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 38Allard J.D. Bertrand K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17809-17819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When Glu-370 was changed to Ala in the fusions, there was no increase in the low levels of alkaline phosphatase activity of fusions at these sites (Fig. 2, legend). Thus, misplacement of the region due to Glu-370 can be excluded. Low activity of some of the fusions could be due to poor expression of the fused protein. Therefore fusions to lacZ (see “Experimental Procedures”) were constructed at all sites with low alkaline phosphatase activity. At all of these sites, the lacZ reporter gene was expressed at a relatively high level, consistent with good expression at sites where alkaline phosphatase activity was low (Fig. 2). The expression of β-galactosidase from fusions at 375 and 378 remained relatively high when Glu-370 was replaced by Ala. The fusion at residue 336, predicted to be in the membrane, had the lowest activity of any of the lacZ fusions, consistent with the predicted location(37Calamia J. Manoil C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Since the stability and expression of fusions to phoA might differ from those to lacZ at the same sites, we examined expression of the phoA fusions directly by immunoblot analysis. The results indicate that very low levels of alkaline phosphatase activity cannot be attributed to low stability or low expression of the fusions. When cells were harvested in the logarithmic phase of growth, a band of the expected size was detected for all phoA fusions except the one to residue 162 (Fig. 3A). The level of expression varied somewhat, as can be seen in the figure. In other immunoblots in which variable amounts of extracts were compared, the fusions with the lowest level of expression were present at over 25% of the level of highly expressed fusions (data not shown). All of these fusions proved to be unstable. In samples from cells grown into the stationary phase, the majority of the fusions showed few if any PhoA-specific bands, while a minority showed good reactivity. The most intense PhoA-specific bands had a higher electrophoretic mobility, showing that they represent degradation products (Fig. 3B). We noted a correlation between location of a fusion and its stability; fusions to periplasmic regions of KdpA were relatively stable and were expressed at a higher level than were any of the fusions to internal regions. The only exceptions were the fusions at residues 61 and 162; the former has only the first membrane domain of KdpA and was quite stable, while the fusion at residue"
https://openalex.org/W2067393120,"Stimulation of platelets by thrombin leads to an increased association of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-K) with a membrane cytoskeletal fraction (CSK). Activation of PI 3-K is dependent upon GTP-binding protein(s), since PI 3-K in permeabilized platelets is stimulated by GTPγS (guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate), and stimulation of platelet cytosolic PI 3-K by GTPγS requires a functional small G-protein, Rho. Recent reports indicate that cytosolic PI 3-Ks can also be activated by the βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins (Gβγ). We now report that the activated PI 3-K that is associated with CSK can be inhibited by a recombinant protein containing the Gβγ-binding pleckstrin homology domain of β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (βARK-PH). Inhibition is blocked by Gβγ. PI 3-K in nonactivated platelet CSK is activated by GTPγS but unaffected by βARK-PH or Gβγ. Western blots indicate that activated platelet CSK contains a novel 110-kDa PI 3-K(γ) that has been shown to be stimulated by Gβγ and to lack binding sites for the 85-kDa subunit of conventional PI 3-K. PI 3-K in immunoprecipitates obtained via p85 subunit-directed antibodies can be activated by GTPγS but not by Gβγ. PI 3-K that is stimulatable by Gβγ remains soluble, as does PI 3-K(γ), and is unaffected by Rho. In contrast, ADP-ribosylation of Rho present in p85 immunoprecipitates is inhibitory. Further, activation of PI 3-K in permeabilized platelets exposed to thrombin or GTPγS is inhibited by βARK-PH and/or Rho-specific ADP-ribosylating enzymes. We conclude that Rho and Gβγ each, respectively, contributes to the activation of different PI 3-Ks (p85-containing heterodimer and PI 3-K (γ)) in thrombin-stimulated platelets. Stimulation of platelets by thrombin leads to an increased association of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-K) with a membrane cytoskeletal fraction (CSK). Activation of PI 3-K is dependent upon GTP-binding protein(s), since PI 3-K in permeabilized platelets is stimulated by GTPγS (guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate), and stimulation of platelet cytosolic PI 3-K by GTPγS requires a functional small G-protein, Rho.

Western blots indicate that activated platelet CSK contains a novel 110-kDa PI 3-K(γ) that has been shown to be stimulated by Gβγ and to lack binding sites for the 85-kDa subunit of conventional PI 3-K. PI 3-K in immunoprecipitates obtained via p85 subunit-directed antibodies can be activated by GTPγS but not by Gβγ. PI 3-K that is stimulatable by Gβγ remains soluble, as does PI 3-K(γ), and is unaffected by Rho. In contrast, ADP-ribosylation of Rho present in p85 immunoprecipitates is inhibitory. Further, activation of PI 3-K in permeabilized platelets exposed to thrombin or GTPγS is inhibited by βARK-PH and/or Rho-specific ADP-ribosylating enzymes. We conclude that Rho and Gβγ each, respectively, contributes to the activation of different PI 3-Ks (p85-containing heterodimer and PI 3-K (γ)) in thrombin-stimulated platelets."

The resulting polyclonal antibodies were used in Western blots to determine the compartmentation and tissue distribution of selenoprotein W, and to determine the influence of selenium on the levels of this selenoprotein in rat muscle. Selenoprotein W exists mainly in cytosol, but very small amounts were associated with membranes. Western blots revealed selenoprotein W in muscle, spleen, testis, and brain of rats. Rats were fed diets of either no addition of selenium (0 ppm Se) or additions of 0.1 and 4.0 mg selenium/g (0.1 ppm Se and 4.0 ppm Se) diet for 6 wk. Selenoprotein W was undetectable in skeletal muscle of rats fed the basal diet, detectable in those fed 0.1 ppm selenium in the diet, and much higher in muscle from rats fed 4 ppm selenium diet. In a species comparison, Western blots indicated the presence of selenoprotein W in muscle of rabbits, sheep, and cattle.—Yeh, J-Y., Beilstein, M. A., Andrews, J. S., Whanger, P. D.

https://openalex.org/W1584322138,"We have recently identified a novel element (EFE 5/6) in the human elastin gene promoter that modulates the ability of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) to up-regulate elastin gene transcription in aortic smooth muscle cells. In the present study, we have pursued the identification of those nuclear proteins binding to the EFE 5/6 element and affected by IGF-I treatment. Chelation inactivation and metal reactivation experiments together with supershift gel analyses demonstrated that Sp1 was one of the proteins affected by IGF-I. Southwestern and Western analyses showed that Sp1 was present in IGF-I nuclear extracts and capable of binding DNA after fractionation. Addition of retinoblastoma gene product (Rb) antibody mimicked the effect of IGF-I in gel shift analysis, suggesting that Sp1 binding may be regulated by an inhibitor normally associated with Rb. The fact that the phosphorylation state of Rb was affected by IGF-I was shown by Western blot analysis. The control smooth muscle cells transcribed the elastin gene at a high level without addition of IGF-I, so it is likely that disruption of Sp1 binding is the first step in allowing the binding of a more potent activating factor.

Elastin is an extracellular protein whose biological function is to provide elasticity to various connective tissues. The elastic properties imparted by elastin are essential to the structure of the aorta and large arteries of the cardiovascular system, where the proper maintenance of pressure gradients is critical to the continued functioning of the entire system. Reported studies suggest that elastogenesis is high during the development and growth of the aortic and arterial walls (Burnett et al., 1980; Shibahara et al., 1981; Foster et al., 1987, 1989), but very low in the mature animal (Lefevre and Rucker, 1983; Foster et al., 1990). Because the lack of renewed elastin repair has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (Davidson and Giro, 1986), much interest has centered on questions relating to how elastin gene expression is regulated. Recent publications detailing the complete nucleotide sequence of the human elastin gene and 5′-flanking regions (Bashir et al., 1989; Yeh et al., 1989) have provided a framework for investigating DNA-protein interactions involved in modulating elastin gene transcription. Putative cis-acting elements in the 5′-flanking region of the gene have been found by computer homology search (Kahari et al., 1990), and broadly defined functional areas of the gene have been identified through transient transfections of various cell types with a series of deletion reporter constructs (Fazio et al., 1990; Kahari et al., 1990). Very little is currently known of specific sequences within the elastin gene promoter that regulate transcription during any phase of elastin expression.

We have further shown by DNase footprint analysis that deprotection of the EFE 5/6 element temporally coincides with the major developmental burst of aortic elastogenesis within the chick embryo (Rich et al., 1993).

Human recombinant Sp1 and a double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide corresponding to the Sp1 consensus sequence ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGACC were purchased from Promega. Rabbit polyclonal IgG preparations directed against amino acid residues 520-538 of human Sp1, the carboxyl-terminal 15 amino acids of the human Rb p110 sequence (Rb C-15), the carboxyl-terminal 14 amino acids of human egr-1 (egr-1 588 X), and the carboxyl-terminal 24 amino acids of human egr-3 (egr-3 C-24) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The peptide antigen used to elicit antiserum to Sp1 was also purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. A mouse monclonal antibody directed against Rb was obtained from Transduction Laboratories. Three single-stranded DNA oligomers and their complementary strands were purchased from Oligos Etc. These included CGTAATTGTCCCCTCCCCGCGGCCCCCT (EFE 5/6, −165 to −137 bp), TCTCGCACGCTCGCACGCTCCTCCGCCT (a scrambled sequence of EFE 5/6 designated NS 28MER), and TCTCCCGCCCTCCCGCCCGCCCT (EFE 3, −119 to −97 bp). Neonatal rat smooth muscle cells were isolated from the aortae of 2-3 day Sprague-Dawley rats, cultured, rendered quiescent, and treated with IGF-I at 50 ng/ml medium (6.5 nM) as previously described (Wolfe et al., 1993). Nuclei from control and IGF-I-treated cell cultures were isolated by the procedure of Dean et al. (1986), and nuclear proteins were extracted essentially according to the method of Dignam et al.(1983) with the modifications introduced by Ritzenthaler et al.(1991). Total protein within each sample was determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). The extracts were stored at −80°C in extraction buffer consisting of 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.35 M NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 25% glycerol, 1.0 μM diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.0 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin. Duplex oligomers were prepared by heating complementary strands in 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 10 mM MgCl2 to 95°C for 5 min and then slowly cooling to room temperature over a 2-h period. The homogeneity of annealed oligomers was examined by gel electrophoresis. Deoxyribonucleic acid fragments were radiolabeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and separated from free [32P]dATP by the Sephadex G-50 spun-column procedure (Sambrook et al., 1989). The 32P-labeled DNA fragments (0.1-2.5 ng, 40-200 fmol, 20,000-100,000 cpm), nuclear extract (5-30 μg of protein), and 1.0-10 μg of poly(dI-dC) were brought to a volume of 35 μl with 7 μl of 5 × binding buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton, and 2.5% glycerol), 7 μl of extraction buffer (counting the volume of nuclear extract), and the appropriate volume of H2O. The final concentration of the binding mixture was 6 mM HEPES, 70 mM NaCl, 0.3 mM MgCl2, 0.04 mM EDTA, 1.2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton, and 5.5% glycerol. Reactions were incubated at 25°C for 30 min, and the products were resolved by electrophoresis through a 4% native polyacrylamide gel in 90 mM Tris borate, 2.0 mM EDTA buffer, pH 8.3. Electrophoresis was performed at 25°C at 100 V (10 V/cm). The gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography. In competition experiments, 50-100-fold molar excess of unlabeled, competitor DNA was pre-incubated with nuclear extracts for 30 min at 25°C before the addition of 32P-labeled DNA. The supershift gel mobility assays were performed with these minor changes. The nuclear extract was preincubated with specified antibody preparations for 1 h at room temperature before incubation with labeled oligonucleotide as described above, followed by loading onto the gel. For chelation inactivation experiments, specified amounts of EDTA or 1,10-phenanthroline were added to nuclear extracts with binding buffer and 1.0 μg of poly(dI-dC) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Radiolabeled DNA was then added, and the mixture was incubated for another 30 min at the same temperature. For metal ion reactivation, specified amounts of either MgCl2 or ZnCl2 were added to the nuclear extract after the incubation with 1,10-phenanthroline, and the mixture was allowed to sit at room temperature for an additional 20 min before final incubation with radiolabeled DNA. Triplicate 50-μg samples of control or IGF-I-treated SMC nuclear protein were analyzed by 8.0% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Laemmli(1970). One lane of the gel included molecular weight standards. The gel was electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose as described by Towbin et al.(1979). The nitrocellulose was cut to allow each set of samples to be probed with either antibody or radiolabeled probe. For Western analysis, the blot was washed twice (10 min each, room temperature) in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween-20 (referred to as TTBS buffer) and then blocked for 60 min at room temperature in TTBS containing 5% milk. The blot was incubated with Sp1 or Rb antibody (1 μg/ml) in TTBS, 5% milk for 2 h at room temperature followed by incubation for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase conjugated with protein A or goat anti-mouse IgG diluted 1:3000 in TTBS containing 5% milk. The blot was washed twice with TTBS (10 min each, room temperature) followed by an additional 10-min wash with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 150 mM NaCl and then incubated with Amersham ECL reagents according to the manufacturer's directions for 1 min and then exposed to x-ray film. For Southwestern analysis, the blot was first washed twice (10 min each, room temperature) in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 3 mM MgCl2, 40 mM KCL, and 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, blocked for 60 min in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9) containing 4% milk, and then washed once in binding buffer consisting of 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 70 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.3 mM MgCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Hybridization of the blot with 2.5 ng/ml radiolabeled EFE 5/6 (2 × 105 cpm) was performed for 3 h at room temperature in binding buffer containing BSA (60 μg/ml) and poly(dI-dC) (37.5 μg/ml). Prior to exposure of the gel to x-ray film, it was washed twice (5 min at room temperature) in binding buffer containing 0.01% Triton X-100. For competition of binding, a 2-fold excess of Sp1 consensus oligomer (5 ng/ml) was incubated with the blot for 1 h prior to the addition of radiolabeled probe. Since we have already shown that IGF-I addition to SMC results in a disruption of DNA-protein complexes footprinted to −165 to −137 bp of the human elastin gene (Wolfe et al., 1993), the first experiment was designed to test whether this sequence alone would mimic the results obtained on larger fragments of the promoter. Fig. 1 provides gel shift analysis of the EFE 5/6 sequence incubated with nuclear proteins isolated from control and IGF-I-treated SMC (leftpanel) and competitive gel shift analysis reactions to establish specificity (rightpanel). The incubation of the radiolabeled probe with control SMC nuclear extract resulted in the formation of three major complexes denoted as I, II, and III. The largest complex, i.e. complex I, is sometimes visible as a doublet and most likely consists of two discrete complexes (Ia and Ib) whose distinctiveness will be obvious in other figures. Pertinent to the objectives of the present study was the finding that incubation of radiolabeled EFE 5/6 with nuclear proteins isolated from IGF-I-treated SMC resulted in a significant loss of complexes I and II, whereas complex III remained unchanged. This disruption of binding complexes found with nuclear proteins isolated from IGF-I-treated SMC agrees with our previous studies and verifies our use of this synthetic oligomer to examine proteins associated with the IGF-I-sensitive complexes. The specificity of binding is shown in DNA competition assays where the binding to nuclear proteins was competed with either unlabeled EFE 5/6 or a nonspecific 28-bp sequence. The 28-bp nonspecific sequence has the same base composition as the EFE 5/6 sequence, but in a scrambled sequence, and does not form any complexes with proteins extracted from control SMC (Fig. 1). The binding of proteins found in complexes I and II is competed in the presence of a 50-fold molar excess EFE 5/6, whereas the binding of proteins in complex III are not completely competed until a 100-fold excess. The nonspecific DNA oligomer, at 100-fold molar excess, does not compete for binding of any of the complexes. In an independent study, we have determined that the formation of complexes I and II is preferentially favored when the amount of poly(dI-dC) was decreased from 10 to 1 μg (Terpstra, 1994), which suggested that the proteins contained in these complexes may recognize a more GC-enriched region on the DNA. To begin characterization of those proteins associated with the EFE 5/6 sequence, their dependence on metal for DNA binding was examined. Fig. 2 provides a composite result in which radiolabeled EFE 5/6 was incubated with nuclear proteins isolated from control SMC with the addition of either EDTA or the divalent chelator 1,10-phenanthroline. The results demonstrated that formation of complexes I and II is sensitive to both EDTA (Fig. 2A) and 1,10-phenanthroline (Fig. 2B) chelation, whereas complex III formation is unaffected. Furthermore, restoration of complex I and II binding after 1,10-phenanthroline treatment was fully achieved by the addition of Zn2+, whereas Mg2+ only partially restored binding (Fig. 2B). These results showed that the proteins comprising complexes I and II are dependent upon Zn(II) for binding and suggest that they are members of a class of transcription factors possessing zinc finger domains. Since the EFE 5/6 sequence possesses a sequence enriched in GC, we first investigated whether the transcription factor Sp1, which is a ubiquitous, zinc finger protein, was a component of complex I and/or II. Although the EFE 5/6 element does not contain the classic Sp1 consensus sequence, i.e. GGGCGG, Sp1 is capable of recognizing many GC-rich divergent sequences including NGGNGN, GT boxes, and CACC motifs (Gloss and Bernard, 1990; Li et al., 1991; Briggs et al., 1986; Yu et al., 1991). The identification of Sp1 was approached directly through an immunological technique (Fig. 3) and indirectly through a comparative biochemical analysis (Fig. 4). Incubation of control SMC nuclear extract and radiolabeled EFE 5/6 with rabbit antibody directed toward human Sp1 resulted in a new low mobility complex with a concomitant diminishment of complex Ia. Further competition of antibody binding with the cognate peptide antigen, i.e. amino acid residues 520-538 of human Sp1, specifically blocked the supershifted complex. As other controls, Sp1 antibody was incubated directly with the labeled probe, and a rabbit antibody directed against rat elastin fragments (Rich et al., 1992) was substituted for Sp1 antibody. These results demonstrated that Sp1 or a Sp1-like protein containing a peptide sequence very similar if not identical to amino acid residues 520-538 of human Sp1 is present in complex I. The fact that only one band associated with complexes I and II is supershifted does not necessarily mean that Sp1 is not associated with complex Ib or II. It may be that these latter complexes contain subpopulations of Sp1 that are conformationally inaccessible to the antibodies due to a post-transcriptional modification (Jackson and Tjian, 1988; Jackson et al., 1990). It is interesting to note in this regard that other studies aimed at identification of Sp1 binding to putative binding sites have noted a similar multiplicity of bands, which are apparently not supershifted with antibody prepared to human recombinant Sp1 (Sykes and Kaufman, 1990; Gloss and Bernard, 1990; Chen et al., 1994). On the other hand, it is possible that the proteins present in complexes Ib and II may be other members of a multigene Sp1 family, including Sp2 and Sp3 (Kingsley and Winoto, 1992).Figure 4:Binding of purified Sp1 to the EFE 5/6 probe. Human recombinant Sp1 (0.4 footprinting units) was incubated with 1 ng of 32P-labeled EFE 5/6 probe independently or together with either 5 μg of nuclear extract isolated from control SMC or 5 μg of BSA in the presence of 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). Gel shift analysis was performed as described in the text. As controls, the radiolabeled probe was incubated separately with 5 μg of nuclear extract or 5 μg of BSA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further explore the role of Sp1 in complex formation, a human recombinant form of Sp1 was used in gel shift assays to compare its binding properties to that of the endogenous rat nuclear protein(s). Fig. 4 shows a gel shift assay where Sp1 was incubated with labeled EFE 5/6 alone, in the presence of subsaturating amounts of nuclear extract, or a general protein carrier, i.e. BSA. The results showed that Sp1 by itself did not form a detectable complex, however, when Sp1 was added in the presence of nuclear extract or BSA, a low mobility complex formed that was comparable in electrophoretic mobility to complex I. It is interesting to note that other studies involving the binding of purified Sp1 to putative Sp1 elements have found that Sp1 does not bind unless cell nuclear extract is present (Alemany et al., 1992; Kutoh and Schwander, 1993). The proposed explanation for this phenomenon is that the nuclear proteins added modify or participate in specific protein-protein interactions that allow Sp1 to bind. In our system, there is clearly no specific interaction between nuclear proteins and the exogenous Sp1 since the addition of a carrier protein (BSA) results in the same degree of Sp1 complex formation as does the nuclear extract. Also evident in Fig. 4 is that the addition of Sp1 together with nuclear extract results in the elimination of complex II. Although this result showed that the purified Sp1 preparation can effectively compete with the protein(s) involved in complex II, it does not differentiate whether the competed protein is a unique zinc-dependent protein or a modified form of Sp1. In experiments not shown, titration of the DNA probe with increasing amounts of recombinant Sp1 resulted in the formation of only one complex even at the lowest amount of protein. Competition gel shift assays were performed to further confirm the presence of Sp1. Radiolabeled EFE 5/6 binding to protein in the control nuclear extract was competed with a consensus Sp1 site and a putative Sp1 site (EFE 3) located downstream from EFE 5/6 at −119 to −97 bp. As shown in Fig. 5A, the Sp1 consensus sequence competed as effectively as the EFE 5/6 element for proteins involved in complexes I and II as well as complex III, whereas the EFE 3 sequence caused some diminution of complexes I and II and had no effect on complex III formation. Since the Sp1 consensus sequence and to some extent the EFE 3 sequence competed with proteins involved in binding the EFE 5/6 element, these oligomers were radiolabeled and subjected to gel shift analysis using either nuclear extract isolated from control SMC or purified Sp1 in the presence of BSA (Fig. 5B). The consensus Sp1 oligomer formed two major complexes with the nuclear proteins that possessed electrophoretic mobilities comparable with complexes I and II. The EFE 3 oligomer formed a minor complex that comigrated with complex I. Both the EFE 5/6 and consensus Sp1 oligomers bound recombinant Sp1 very strongly, whereas the EFE 3 oligomer formed a weak complex, illustrating that its affinity was much lower. In a seminal study of the functional DNA binding domain of Sp1, Kadonaga et al.(1987) found that purified human Sp1 was insensitive to 1,10-phenanthroline chelation at concentrations as high as 1.0 mM. In the present study, we have shown that complexes I and II are eliminated by as little as 80 μM 1,10-phenanthroline (see Fig. 2B). Since the experimental conditions that we used were different than those reported by Kadonaga et al.(1987), we tested whether under our experimental protocol Sp1 binding is susceptible to chelation by 1,10-phenanthroline. Human recombinant Sp1 was incubated with radiolabeled EFE 5/6 and Sp1 consensus oligomers in the presence of increasing amounts of 1,10-phenanthroline (Fig. 6). A dose-dependent loss of Sp1 binding was noted with complete abrogation of binding achieved at 40 μM for the consensus sequence and 20 μM for the EFE 5/6 sequence. Further, Sp1 binding was restored to both sequences by the addition of 80 μM ZnCl2. Since the above data pointed to the fact that the binding of Sp1 and other Zn(II) requiring proteins to the EFE 5/6 sequence was lost upon IGF-I treatment, we examined whether this loss of binding was specific to the EFE 5/6 sequence. The Sp1 consensus and the EFE 3 oligomers were subjected to gel shift analysis with nuclear proteins isolated from control and IGF-I-treated SMC (Fig. 7). Significantly, both oligomers exhibited a loss of Sp1 binding when incubated with nuclear extracts obtained from IGF-I-treated SMC, demonstrating that the addition of IGF-I resulted in a general inactivation of Sp1 binding within the SMC. To gain some insight into the mechanism by which IGF-I abrogates Sp1 binding in the SMC, Western and Southwestern analyses were performed to determine 1) if Sp1 were present in nuclear extracts isolated from IGF-I-treated SMC and 2) if immunologically detectable forms of Sp1 were capable of binding the EFE 5/6 element. The Western blot given in Fig. 8A showed that nuclear extracts isolated from both control and IGF-I-treated SMC contained Sp1 and further demonstrated that the ratio of the two major species detected, i.e. 106 and 95 kDa, did not differ between the two samples. The human recombinant Sp1 sample used for this study is reported by the supplier (Promega) to be comprised of two major species representing a phosphorylated/glycosylated form (106 kDa) and an unmodified form (95 kDa). Although our analysis of the human recombinant Sp1 and rat SMC nuclear protein samples showed that both animal species possessed immunologically reactive polypeptides of similar size, we have not determined the phosphorylation or glycosylation states of either polypeptide. Southwestern analysis of the nuclear extracts run on the same gel using radiolabeled EFE 5/6 as a probe showed that the binding of Sp1 within extracts isolated from control and IGF-I-treated SMC is comparable (Fig. 8B). Interestingly, both extracts exhibited binding with only the 106-kDa species. The specificity of the reaction is illustrated in the rightpanel where binding of the radiolabeled EFE 5/6 oligomer to the 106-kDa band was lost when competed with the unlabeled Sp1 consensus oligomer. These data show that Sp1 is present in the nuclear extracts of IGF-I-treated cells and is capable of binding its cognate sequence after fractionation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The results also suggest that IGF-I is not causing a major post-translational modification in the Sp1 protein since the migration patterns of the control and IGF-I samples are virtually identical. The two other proteins visualized by hybridization with the EFE 5/6 probe possessed apparent molecular masses of 60 and 42 kDa. The possible role of these proteins in contributing to complex III formation will be presented elsewhere. 2A. J. Terpstra and J. A. Foster, manuscript in preparation. One possible explanation for the lack of Sp1 binding in the total extract of IGF-I-treated cells is that Sp1 binding is negated by association with another protein. Evidence for this mechanism of controlling Sp1 binding was recently reported by Chen et al.(1994). These investigators demonstrated that Sp1-mediated transcription of c-Jun is regulated indirectly by Rb through sequestration or release of an Sp1 inhibitor protein. We investigated the possibility that Rb was playing a similar role in the regulation of Sp1 binding in the SMC. A gel shift analysis was performed (Fig. 9) where radiolabeled EFE 5/6 and nuclear proteins isolated from control SMC were incubated individually with antibody against egr-1, egr-3 (both zinc finger transcriptional factors), Rb, or Sp1. As a reference point, EFE 5/6 was incubated with nuclear extract isolated from IGF-I-treated SMC. Most significant was the finding that Rb antibody specifically abrogated formation of complexes I and II, thereby mimicking the pattern found in the IGF-I-treated cells, whereas neither egr antibody preparation had any effect and the Sp1 antibody supershifted a portion of complex I as previously shown. This result suggests the possibility that Rb may be mediating the effects of IGF-I on Sp1 binding in the SMC in some indirect manner through protein-protein interactions. Since these results suggested that Rb may be mediating the effect of IGF-I on Sp1 binding, we examined whether IGF-I had any direct effect on the steady-state levels or phosphorylation state of Rb. The Southwestern blot shown in Fig. 8B was washed and probed with antibody to Rb. The results given in Fig. 10 showed that within the control nuclear extract, Rb exists primarily in the underphosphorylated form, whereas after IGF-I treatment the hyperphosphorylated form predominated. This result establishes a link between IGF-I treatment of SMC and the phosphorylation state of Rb, which is particularly interesting since Chen et al.(1994) have postulated that the nonphosphorylated form of Rb binds the Sp1 inhibitor. The fact that the phosphorylated form of Rb is increased by IGF-I would be consistent with the loss of Sp1 binding. The overall goal of this study was to gain insight into the mechanism by which IGF-I increases the transcriptional level of the elastin gene in aortic SMC. The data presented do provide insight into at least one component of IGF-I action on the elastin gene and additionally supply important information relative to a general effect of IGF-I on SMC gene expression and on a specific factor potentially controlling the SMC cell cycle. The finding that Rb may regulate Sp1 binding in the SMC is significant and has implications independent of IGF-I action. Other investigators have shown that elastin synthesis in rat SMC is inversely related to cell proliferation, and the major burst of elastogenesis occurs after confluency (Toselli et al., 1992). These observations, together with the data reported here, suggest that Rb plays a key role in transcriptional regulation of the elastin gene and perhaps other matrix genes by allowing Sp1 binding when the cells are prohibited from entering S phase, thereby establishing a boundary between cell growth and matrix formation. The addition of IGF-I to cultures of quiescent, neonatal SMC does not induce elastin gene transcription but rather increases the transcriptional level above an already existent high level. It is therefore possible that the EFE 5/6 sequence may be a positive element within a specified time frame of SMC elastogenesis by complexing with Sp1 to allow increased frequency of Pol II initiation in confluent, non-proliferating SMC. In this light, our initial reference to the IGF-I effect on elastin gene transcription as one of derepression should be reconsidered. Our previous study had shown that the removal of the EFE 5/6 binding site by deletion of sequences spanning −195 to −137 bp from the −195 to +1-bp chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct resulted in an increased activity of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene driven by −136 to +1 of the elastin promoter (Wolfe et al., 1993). Although the term derepression adequately describes the results obtained, the terminology used may be inappropriate since it implies that EFE 5/6 sequence is a repressor element within the elastin gene proximal promoter. It may be that the removal of this sequence allows the binding of Sp1 to a lower binding site in the truncated promoter, i.e. the EFE 3 sequence, whose position is closer to the CAAT box. It is interesting to note that Alemany et al.(1990) have shown that IGF-I and insulin induce Sp1 binding to an Sp1-binding sequence adjacent to the CAAT box in the proximal promoter of the δ-crystallin gene. These investigators have also found that the binding of Sp1 to this sequence is developmentally regulated in embryonic chick lens (Alemany et al., 1992). Similar to these studies, we report here that Sp1 is involved in the IGF-I up-regulation of elastin gene transcription, and we have previously shown that the proteins interacting with the EFE 5/6 sequence are developmentally regulated in embryonic chick aorta (Rich et al., 1993). However, the major difference in the role of Sp1 as dictated by IGF-I treatment is activation of transcription by binding in the case of the δ-crystallin gene and up-regulation of transcription by disruption of binding within the elastin gene. It thus appears as if IGF-I can activate or increase transcription by at least two separate pathways involving Sp1 as a focal point. The cells used for these studies differed significantly in that the cells used to examine the δ-crystallin gene involved chick embryonic lens epithelial cells that are stimulated to differentiate by IGF-I and insulin. The cells we have used in this study are differentiated aortic SMC that are already transcribing the elastin gene. A key to the differences in IGF-I responses may be related to events controlled by the cell cycle. Our initial goal was to investigate the mechanism by which IGF-I up-regulates the elastin gene. Our studies have shown that Sp1 binding to the elastin promoter is lost as a consequence of IGF-I treatment; however, this does not explain why elastin gene transcription is increased. In fact, one would predict that the loss of Sp1 binding would decrease transcription. It is interesting to note that Terpstra (1994) found that in vivo competition experiments involving cotransfection of the EFE 5/6 sequence with a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct containing −195 to +2 bp of the human elastin promoter resulted in decreased chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity, whereas a nonspecific oligomer possessing the same base composition had no effect. These results confirm the hypothesis that the loss of Sp1 from the EFE 5/6 sequence in itself does not result in increased transcriptional activity. Since the up-regulation of the elastin gene transcription by IGF-I requires protein synthesis (Wolfe et al., 1993), it is possible that IGF-I induces the synthesis of another activating protein that may bind to a sequence overlapping a portion of the EFE 5/6 sequence. Alternatively, the protein synthesis required by the IGF-I may involve a target protein controlling Rb either transcriptionally and/or post-transcriptionally. We previously have shown that when the −195 to +2-bp region of the elastin promoter was incubated with nuclear extracts obtained from control and IGF-I-treated SMC and analyzed by gel shift analysis, two complexes were lost by IGF-I treatment, and a third complex was increased. Although this was not a consistent finding in all of the primary cultures examined at that time, we have performed a number of other experiments that suggest that removal of Sp1 by IGF-I treatment results in the binding of an AP-2-like protein to a sequence overlapping the 3′-end of EFE 5/6. 3C. B. Rich, H. D. Goud, and J. A. Foster, unpublished data. In conclusion, based primarily on the data obtained within this study and preliminary data obtained from parallel studies, our current working hypothesis is that IGF-I up-regulates elastin gene transcription through two steps. One of these involves the disruption of Sp1 binding, perhaps through alteration of the level or phosphorylation state of Rb, and the second involves binding of an activator that is capable of bringing the trans-activation complex to a higher level of activity. We are currently pursuing which of the steps require protein synthesis and are also expanding our investigations of the role of Rb in controlling elastogenesis within SMC.

https://openalex.org/W1517557846,"The R2 protein of ribonucleotide reductase contains at the side chain of tyrosine 122 a stable free radical, which is essential for enzyme catalysis. The tyrosyl radical is buried in the protein matrix close to a dinuclear iron center and a cluster of three hydrophobic residues (Phe-208, Phe-212, and Ile-234) conserved throughout the R2 family. A key step in the generation of the tyrosyl radical is the activation of molecular oxygen at the iron center. It has been suggested that the hydrophobic cluster provides an inert binding pocket for molecular oxygen bound to the iron center and that it may play a role in directing the oxidative power of a highly reactive intermediate toward tyrosine 122. We have tested these hypotheses by constructing the following mutant R2 proteins: F208Y, F212Y, F212W, and I234N. The resulting mutant proteins all have the ability to form a tyrosine radical, which indicates that binding of molecular oxygen can occur. In the case of F208Y, the yield of tyrosyl radical is substantially lower than in the wild-type case. A competing reaction resulting in hydroxylation of Tyr-208 implies that the phenylalanine at position 208 may influence the choice of target for electron abstraction. The most prominent result is that all mutant proteins show impaired radical half-life; in three of the four mutants, the half-lives are several orders of magnitude shorter than that of the wild-type radical. This suggests that the major role of the hydrophobic pocket is to stabilize the tyrosyl radical. This hypothesis is corroborated by comparative studies of the environment of other naturally occurring tyrosyl radicals.

In Con8 cell monolayers cultured on permeable filter supports, the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, coordinately suppressed [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine incorporation, stimulated monolayer transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), and decreased the paracellular leakage of [<sup>3</sup>H]inulin or [<sup>14</sup>C]mannitol across the monolayer. These processes dose dependently correlated with glucocorticoid receptor occupancy and function. Constitutive production of TGF-α in transfected cells or exogenous treatment with TGF-α prevented the glucocorticoid growth suppression response and disrupted tight junction formation without affecting glucocorticoid responsiveness. Treatment with hydroxyurea or araC demonstrated that <i>de novo</i> DNA synthesis is not a requirement for the growth factor disruption of tight junctions. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the ZO-1 tight junction protein is localized exclusively at the cell periphery in dexamethasone-treated cells and that TGF-α caused ZO-1 to relocalize from the cell periphery back to a cytoplasmic compartment. Taken together, our results demonstrate that glucocorticoids can coordinately regulate growth inhibition and cell-cell contact of mammary tumor cells and that TGF-α, can override both effects of glucocorticoids. These results have uncovered a novel functional ""cross-talk"" between glucocorticoids and TGF-α which potentially regulates the proliferation and differentiation of mammary epithelial cells."

To study further the mechanism of the regulation of GAD activity by protein phosphorylation, we conducted experiments to determine the extent of GAD phosphorylation and GAD activity in crude as well as purified preparations using various protein kinases, phosphatase, and their specific inhibitors. In addition, the effect of neuronal stimulation on GAD activity in cultured neurons is also included. Based on the results presented in this paper and those reported in the literature, a model is proposed to link neuronal excitation to activation of GAD through Ca2+-dependent dephosphorylation. Fresh porcine brains were obtained from a local slaughter house. Triton X-100, 1,2-diolein, L-α-phosphatidyl-L-serine, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A; PKA), PKA inhibitory peptide (PKI), PKA catalytic subunit, calmodulin, and calcineurin were from Sigma. Protein kinase C (PKC) and PKC inhibitory peptide were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Okadaic acid was from Moana Bioproducts. Radioisotopes were purchased from Dupont NEN. Preparation of crude synaptosome was performed as described before(17Bao J. Nathan B. Hsu C.-C. Zhang Y. Wu R. Wu J.-Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 1994; 1: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, fresh porcine brains were homogenized in 0.32 M sucrose (w/v, 15 g/100 ml), and the homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant solution was collected and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant liquid was discarded, and the pellet was gently suspended in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (123 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 0.4 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM NaH2PO4, 0.25 mM Na2HPO4, and 1 mg/ml glucose, pH 7.2). The suspension was divided into aliquots for the subsequent experiments. Aliquots of synaptosomal suspension were subjected to osmotic shock by dilution in water and sonicated. The suspension was adjusted to give a final concentration of 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.3, containing 1 mM 2-aminoethylisothiouronium bromide (AET), 25 mg/ml pepstatin A, 0.1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mM benzamidine. The mixture was preincubated at 30°C for 5 min under following conditions: (A) and (D), buffer only; (B), plus 50 μg/ml PKA inhibitory peptide (C), plus 50 μg/ml PKC inhibitory peptide; (E), plus 30 nM okadaic acid; (F), plus 10 μM okadaic acid. The mixtures were incubated further at 37°C for 1 h in the phosphorylation solution, which included 0.1 mM theophylline, 4 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM cAMP, and 0.1 mM ATP (125 μCi/ml [ γ-32P]ATP). In (D)-(F), 4 mM EGTA was replaced by 0.1 mM CaCl2. The incubation was terminated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min, and the supernatants obtained were applied to immunoaffinity anti-GAD IgG columns. After washing with 500 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 4 mM EGTA, 5 mM NaF, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 5 mM benzamidine, GAD was eluted out with 0.2 M acetate buffer, pH 2.0, containing 4 M urea. The eluates were dialyzed against 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 1 mM AET, 1 mM aminooxyacetic acid, 4 mM EGTA, 5 mM NaF, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mM benzamidine overnight prior to the separation on a 10% SDS-PAGE. The SDS-PAGE was stained, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. The anti-GAD IgG columns were prepared as described previously(17Bao J. Nathan B. Hsu C.-C. Zhang Y. Wu R. Wu J.-Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 1994; 1: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For GAD assay, the synaptosomes were prepared, lysed, and incubated under various conditions as described above except that no [32P]ATP was included. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate was added to the supernatants to give a final concentration of 0.2 mM. Aliquots of the supernatants were used for GAD assays and protein determinations as described previously(17Bao J. Nathan B. Hsu C.-C. Zhang Y. Wu R. Wu J.-Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 1994; 1: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). No ATP and cAMP were included in the control condition. A porcine brain was homogenized in 5 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.2 (w/v, = 1 g/10 ml), as described previously(17Bao J. Nathan B. Hsu C.-C. Zhang Y. Wu R. Wu J.-Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 1994; 1: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min, the supernatant was applied to an anti-GAD IgG column. The column was washed extensively with 50 and then 500 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, to remove nonspecifically absorbed proteins. Then the GAD•anti-GAD IgG complex, which was still attached to the resin, was suspended in 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, and divided evenly. Each aliquot containing GAD•anti-GAD IgG resin was packed into a small column for subsequent experiments. For PKA treatment, the column was first equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.1 mM cAMP. After equilibration, the column was stopped, and the resin was suspended inside the column with 150 μl of equilibration buffer containing 0.4 mM ATP (300 μCi/ml [ γ-32P]ATP) and 125 units of catalytic subunit of PKA. After gently mixing, the columns were then kept at 30°C for 1 h. For PKC treatment, the same procedure was used except that the catalytic subunit of PKA was replaced by 200 ng of PKC, and the equilibration buffer was changed to PKC buffer, which consisted of 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.03% Triton X-100, 0.31 mg/ml L-α-phosphatidyl-L-serine, and 0.06 mg/ml 1,2-diolein. After phosphorylation, the columns were washed with 500 mM potassium phosphate to remove kinases and ATP. In case additional treatment with phosphatase was desirable, the columns were further equilibrated with calcineurin buffer, which included 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM ZnCl2, and 1 mM CaCl2. For phosphatase treatment, the column was stopped, and the resin was suspended inside the column with 150 μl of the above equilibration buffer containing 50 μg of calcineurin and 100 μg of calmodulin or 150 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase. After gentle mixing, columns were kept at 30°C for 1.5 h, followed by extensive wash with 50 mM and then 500 mM potassium phosphate, containing a mixture of phosphatase inhibitors (2 mM NaF, 200 μM vanadate, 200 μM sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mM EDTA, and 2 mM EGTA). Elution and detection of phosphorylated GAD were performed as described previously(17Bao J. Nathan B. Hsu C.-C. Zhang Y. Wu R. Wu J.-Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 1994; 1: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For the GAD assay, the procedure was the same as described above except that no [32P]ATP was included, and GAD was not eluted from the resin. Instead, the resin was suspended in 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, containing a mixture of phosphatase inhibitors, 1 mM AET, and 0.2 mM pyridoxal 5′-phosphate. The suspension was used for the GAD assay as described previously(17Bao J. Nathan B. Hsu C.-C. Zhang Y. Wu R. Wu J.-Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 1994; 1: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Neither kinases nor phosphatases were added in the control condition. Primary neuronal cultures were prepared from brain of 16-day-old rat embryos as described previously(18Lee Y.-H. Deupree D. Chen S.C. Kao L.-S. Wu J.-Y. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 2325-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures of 14-16 days in vitro were divided into six groups with 15 plates/group and subjected to the following treatments. Control, cultures were grown in Ca2+-free EBSS medium (116 mM NaCl, 5.3 mM KCl, 0.8 mM MgSO4, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 26.3 mM NaHCO3, 5.5 mM glucose). This group was the same as group I except that 2 mM Ca2+ was included. This group was the same as group I except that cultures were stimulated by high K+ stimulation (the same EBSS medium plus 55 mM K+) for 5 min. This group was the same as group II except that cultures were stimulated as in group III. This group was the same as group IV except that 30 nM okadaic acid was included. This group was the same as group V except that okadaic acid concentration used increased from 30 nM to 10 μM. Cultures were harvested, sonicated in GAD buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate, 1 mM AET, and 0.2 mM pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, pH 7.2) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors, centrifuged, and assayed for GAD activity. In the synaptosomal preparations, GAD was phosphorylated by endogenous kinases with [ γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 1, lane A). PKI blocks GAD phosphorylation (Fig. 1, lane B), whereas the inhibitor of PKC had no effect (Fig. 1, lane C). Furthermore, GAD phosphorylation was greatly reduced by replacing EGTA with 0.1 mM Ca2+ (Fig. 1, lane D), presumably through activation of a Ca2+-dependent phosphatase. This dephosphorylation of GAD was inhibited by okadaic acid at 10 μM but not at 30 nM (Fig. 1, lanes E and F). The state of phosphorylation of GAD was found to be inversely correlated with its activity (Table 1). GAD activity decreased when the GAD was in the phosphorylated state. Inhibition of GAD phosphorylation or activation of GAD dephosphorylation markedly increased GAD activity.Tabled 1 To ascertain that the above observations are not due to interference from substances present in the crude extract, similar studies were conducted using a purified GAD preparation. Previously we reported one-step purification of GAD using immunoaffinity column chromatography(19Wu J.-Y. Liu J.-Y. Lin C.T. Evans D. Tsai W.H. Neurochem. Int. 1990; 17: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). We used the GAD associated with anti-GAD IgG resin instead of the GAD eluted from the resin as the GAD sample for studies reported here. There are two advantages of using GAD•anti-GAD IgG resin for studies of GAD activity under various conditions. First, 85% of the GAD was inactivated by elution under acidic condition to dissociate the GAD•anti-GAD IgG complex(19Wu J.-Y. Liu J.-Y. Lin C.T. Evans D. Tsai W.H. Neurochem. Int. 1990; 17: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), whereas no loss of GAD activity was observed using the resin-bound GAD directly for GAD assays. Second, it was more efficient to remove interfering substances from immobilized GAD•anti-GAD IgG complex than from GAD in solution. For instance, during the phosphatase experiment, the kinase can be easily removed simply by washing the kinase from the resin. It was found that the purified GAD was phosphorylated by PKA (Fig. 2lane A) but not PKC (Fig. 2, lane D). Phosphorylated GAD could be dephosphorylated by treatment with calcineurin (Fig. 2, lane B). Similarly, phosphorylated GAD could be dephosphorylated by calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, but to a lesser degree (Fig. 2, lane C). It was estimated that there is 0.47 Pi/subunit of GAD protein from PKA-mediated phosphorylation. Again, the activity of GAD was found to be inversely correlated with its state of phosphorylation. Inhibition of GAD activity was observed by treatment with PKA, but not PKC. Furthermore, PKA-mediated inhibition of GAD activity was restored by calcineurin or calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase treatment (Table 2).Tabled 1 As shown in Table 3, a marked increase of GAD activity was observed in high K+ stimulation in the presence of 2 mM Ca2+. No activation of GAD was observed by high K+ stimulation in the absence of Ca2+. Furthermore, okadaic acid at 30 nM, which is high enough to inhibit protein phosphatase type 1 (IC50 = 20 nM) and type 2A (IC50 = 0.2 nM) (20Harris K.A. Oyler G.A. Doolittle G.M. Vincent I. Lehman R.A.W. Kincaid R.L. Billingsley M.L. Ann. Neurol. 1993; 33: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), had no effect on high K+-induced activation of GAD. However, at a high concentration (10 μM) okadaic acid did inhibit high K+-induced activation of GAD presumably because of inhibition of protein phosphatase 2B (also called calcineurin; IC50 = 5 μM(20Harris K.A. Oyler G.A. Doolittle G.M. Vincent I. Lehman R.A.W. Kincaid R.L. Billingsley M.L. Ann.

Nathan B. Hsu C.-C. Zhang Y. Wu R. Wu J.-Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 1994; 1: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Furthermore, direct phosphorylation of GAD has also been demonstrated in lysed synaptosomal preparations in the presence of [ γ-32P]ATP but not [α-32P]ATP, suggesting that inhibition of GAD activity by ATP is through phosphorylation of the GAD molecule and not by competing with pyridoxal 5′-phosphate for the binding to GAD apoprotein as proposed(21Miller L.P. Martin D.L. Walters J.R. Nature. 1977; 266: 847-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 22Miller L.P. Walters J.R. J. Neurochem. 1979; 33: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this paper, we have presented evidence to suggest that PKA and calcineurin might be the protein kinase and protein phosphatase responsible for phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of GAD, respectively. Moreover, the activity of GAD appears to be inversely correlated with the extent of GAD phosphorylation; namely, GAD is inhibited when it is phosphorylated and is activated when it is dephosphorylated. Several lines of evidence support our hypothesis that PKA is involved in GAD phosphorylation and regulation of GAD activity. First, phosphorylation of GAD could be demonstrated in both crude as well as purified GAD preparations by catalytic subunit of PKA. Second, GAD phosphorylation by PKA is completely blocked by PKI, a specific inhibitor of PKA. Third, GAD activity is reduced by PKA-mediated phosphorylation, and this inhibition can be blocked by PKI. It seemed unlikely that Ca2+-dependent kinases, such as PKC and calcium calmodulin-dependent kinase, might play a significant role in GAD phosphorylation and regulation of GAD activity. This notion is based on the following observations. First, the conditions used for phosphorylation contained 4 mM EGTA, and hence it is unlikely that Ca2+-dependent enzymes, e.g. PKC or calmodulin-dependent kinase, are still active under such conditions. However, it must be pointed out that in the presence of activator, e.g. phorbol ester, PKC activity can be increased greatly even in the presence of a very low concentration of Ca2+(23Ogita K. Ono Y. Kilmkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Also, it is known that calmodulin-dependent kinase II can undergo pseudo-irreversible activation by autophosphorylation, which renders calmodulin-dependent kinase II independent of Ca2+ and calmodulin(24Hubbard M. Klee C.B. Chad J. Wheal H. Molecular Neurobiology: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1991: 135-157Google Scholar). Hence it is conceivable that even in the presence of EGTA, PKC and calmodulin-dependent kinase II could be still active and participate in GAD phosphorylation. Second, PKC fails to catalyze incorporation of 32P into GAD protein either in a crude synaptosomal preparation or in a highly purified GAD preparation. Furthermore, PKC or PKC inhibitory peptide has little effect on GAD activity. Third, it has been shown from immunocytochemical and in situ hybridization studies that calmodulin-dependent kinase II and GAD protein or GAD mRNA have different regional and cellular distributions in the brain(25Benson D.L. Isackson P.J. Hendry S.H.C. Jones E.G. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 1540-1573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Jones E.G. Huntley G.W. Benson D.L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 611-634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that calmodulin-dependent kinase II is unlikely to be localized in GABA-ergic neurons and thus involved with phosphorylation and regulation of GAD activity. There are four major types of serine/threonine protein phosphatases: type 1 (protein phosphatase-1) and type 2, which includes three subtypes A, B, and C (protein phosphatases 2A, 2B, and 2C)(27Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar). These protein phosphatases can be distinguished by their sensitivity to a protein phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid(20Harris K.A. Oyler G.A. Doolittle G.M. Vincent I. Lehman R.A.W. Kincaid R.L. Billingsley M.L. Ann. Neurol. 1993; 33: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 28Hardie D.G. Haystead T.A.J. Sim A.T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Okadaic acid is a potent inhibitor for protein phosphatases 1 (IC50 = 20 nM) and 2A (IC50 = 0.2 nM). Protein phosphatase 2B is inhibited by okadaic acid at a higher concentration (IC50 = 5 μM), whereas 2C is unaffected by okadaic acid at a concentration as high as 10 μM(20Harris K.A. Oyler G.A. Doolittle G.M. Vincent I. Lehman R.A.W. Kincaid R.L. Billingsley M.L. Ann. Neurol. 1993; 33: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 28Hardie D.G. Haystead T.A.J. Sim A.T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Since dephosphorylation of GAD is inhibited by okadaic acid at 10 μM but not at 30 nM (Fig. 1, lanes E and F), it is likely that protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin) is the phosphatase responsible for GAD dephosphorylation. This is consistent with our previous observation that EGTA or a calcineurin-specific inhibitor, deltamethrin, prevented GAD activation in the crude extract(17Bao J. Nathan B. Hsu C.-C. Zhang Y. Wu R. Wu J.-Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 1994; 1: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, it has also been shown that activation of GAD is Ca2+-facilitated(22Miller L.P. Walters J.R. J. Neurochem. 1979; 33: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The fact that calcineurin can dephosphorylate and activate purified GAD in vitro further supports the above notion. Since calcineurin is the major Ca2+-dependent phosphatase in the brain (29Shenolikar S. Nairn A.C. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 1-121PubMed Google Scholar) and has been suggested to be localized in GABA-ergic neurons(30Goto S. Matsukado Y. Mihara Y. Inoue N. Miyamoto E. Brain Res. 1986; 397: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), it seems reasonable to suggest that calcineurin plays an important role in the GABA synthesis through its activation of GAD activity by dephosphorylation. In addition to in vitro studies, evidence obtained from in vivo studies as reported in this paper showing that GAD activity in cultured neurons is enhanced by high K+ stimulation in the presence of Ca2+, but not in Ca2+-free media, is also compatible with the above notion. All of the observations discussed above are consistent with our working hypothesis that when GABA-ergic neurons are stimulated, Ca2+ ions enter the nerve terminals through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, followed by the release of GABA. The influx of Ca2+ then triggers activation of Ca2+-dependent phosphatase (one of the candidates is calcineurin) which in turn activates GAD by dephosphorylation, resulting in an increase in GABA synthesis to replenish GABA depletion due to the release. In summary, phosphorylation by PKA inhibits GAD activity, and dephosphorylation by calcineurin activates it. However, more investigations are required to identify definitely the endogenous kinase and phosphatase responsible for GAD regulation in the brain. We thank Drs. D. Deupree and M. Yarom for a critical review of the manuscript and Jan Elder and Judy Wiglesworth for typing the manuscript."

https://openalex.org/W1879451582,"Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are a cornerstone of treatment of hypertension and heart failure yet their mechanism of action is still debated. This study was designed to test whether the ACEI captopril increases skin microvascular blood flow by a bradykinin-dependent mechanism. Local changes in microvascular blood flow were measured in the skin of rabbits and of human volunteers using a laser Doppler flow probe. Captopril injected intradermally increased skin blood flow over the dose range of 10–12–10–8 mol site in rabbits and humans. In both species the response was abolished by coinjecting either a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor or a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. Intradermal bradykinin also increased rabbit skin microvascular blood flow; at 10–11 mol site it increased mean ± SE basal blood flow by 88 ± 12%. The responses to bradykinin or captopril were abolished by coinjecting a bradykinin antagonist, a specific bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, or inhibitors of NOS or cyclooxygenase. Injecting a specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist at a dose that antagonized the constrictor effects of exogenous angiotensin II did not cause a significant increase in rabbit skin blood flow. This suggests that endogenous angiotensin II does not influence microvascular blood flow in this model. The results indicate that captopril increases skin microvascular blood flow in rabbits and humans secondary to an increase in endogenous tissue bradykinin; this stimulates B2 receptors with subsequent release of prostaglandins and nitric oxide. ACEIs may increase microvascular perfusion by a bradykinin-dependent mechanism.—Warren, J. B., Loi, R. K.

H4 did not, but instead slowed the H+ return-flow in the dark after illumination. Halocin H6 adsorbs firmly to both whole cells and membrane vesicles. The conclusion is that the primary target of halocin H6 is the Na+/H+ antiporter.

This is important not only insofar as it outlines the mechanism by which a halocin works, but also for the fact that it is the first specific physiological inhibitor of the halobacterial Na+/H+ antiporter to be described. Halobacterium halobium is an extremely halophilic archaebacterium. Halobacteria grow in the presence of NaCl levels as high as 4 M while maintaining intracellular Na+ concentrations between 0.3 and 2 M (Christian and Waltho, 1962; Ginzburg et al., 1970). Under such conditions the problems of Na+ exclusion and maintenance of ΔμNa+ Recently, halobacteria were shown to cause antagonistic interactions due to the production of bacteriocin-like substances named halocins (Rodríguez-Valera et al., 1982; Meseguer et al., 1986). Halocins H4 and H6 are produced by the archaebacteria Haloferax mediterranei and Haloferax gibbonsii, respectively. The effect of both is similar (Meseguer and Rodríguez-Valera, 1985; Torreblanca et al., 1989): the halocins adsorb to sensitive cells, producing deformation and lysis, leaving empty “ghosts” in which the cell envelopes seem to be intact (Meseguer and Rodríguez-Valera, 1986; Torreblanca et al., 1990). To specify the mechanism of action of the bacteriocins, it is important to identify the sequence of effects after addition of them. Previous work with these halocins has shown that several functions are affected in sensitive cells, but only those related to the cytoplasmic membrane take place shortly after adding the halocin (Meseguer and Rodríguez-Valera, 1986; Torreblanca et al., 1990; Meseguer et al., 1991). These are inhibition of uptake and enhancement of release of α-aminoisobutyric acid (a non-metabolizable amino acid) and alteration of light/induced pH changes mediated by bacteriorhodopsin. We have already observed that the halocins' effects were quite similar to those of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), 1The abbreviations used are: DCCDdicyclohexylcarbodiimideAUarbitrary unit(s)MES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidTPMPtriphenylmethylphosphonium bromidePIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. an ATPase inhibitor, recently shown to also inhibit the Na+/H+ antiporter (Murakami and Konishi, 1988). Under illumination, protons are pumped out of the cell and re-enter fundamentally through ATPase and Na+/H+ antiporter; like halocins, DCCD intensifies the light-dependent acidification of the medium. We showed in a previous study that halocin H4 did not affect intracellular ATP levels (Meseguer and Rodríguez-Valera, 1986; Torreblanca et al., 1990). Further, we attempted to detect any effect of H6 and H4 on the enzyme in a specific assay with reconstituted/ATPase vesicles and found that the activity was totally unaffected by either halocin. These findings suggested that the Na+/H+ antiporter could be the target for H4 and H6. Due to the significance of this hypothesis and future applications we have studied the effects of H6 and H4 on H. halobium at two levels: (i) indirectly on whole cells by analyzing parameters related to Na+/H+ antiporter activity: (ii) directly on Na+/H+ exchange in membrane vesicles. dicyclohexylcarbodiimide arbitrary unit(s) 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid triphenylmethylphosphonium bromide 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. H. gibbonsii strain Ma 2.39 (Torreblanca et al., 1986) and H. mediterranei ATCC 33500 were used as sources of halocins H6 and H4, respectively. H. halobium NRC 817 was used as sensitive strain. Membrane vesicles were obtained from H. halobium R1M1. These were as described previously (Meseguer and Rodríguez-Valera, 1985; Torreblanca et al., 1989). Except when indicated, media and salt solutions contained a mixture of marine salts referred to as SW (Rodríguez-Valera et al., 1983). An arbitrary unit (AU) is a measure of halocin activity evaluated in a 2-fold dilution method previously described (Meseguer and Rodríguez-Valera., 1986). AU/P = arbitrary units of halocin per milligram of sensitive cell protein. Protein was determined by Lowry's method with bovine serum albumin as standard. It was important to use adequate doses of halocins to ensure that after 30 min the treated cells remained whole and not lysed. We used L-[methyl-14C]methionine (New England Nuclear) an amino acid essential for the growth of H. halobium (Dundas et al., 1963). H. halobium was grown in a medium containing 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract and 25 μCi/ml [14C]methionine in 25% SW, pH 7.2. At the end of the exponential growth phase the culture was centrifuged, washed twice in 25% SW, and suspended in the same solution at a final concentration of 1 mg protein/ml. This suspension was divided into five 1-ml parts, one without halocin as control, and the other four with 410, 820, 1640, and 3280 AU/ml halocin, respectively, and incubated at 37°C, shaking. Samples (0.1 ml) were taken at 3-min intervals, filtered through 0.7-μm pore size Whatman filters, and washed twice with 1 ml of 25% SW. The filters were then placed in vials with 6 ml of Ready Microliquid scintillation mixture (Beckman) and counted in a Beckman LS-2800 counter. This assay was done at two different metabolic states of sensitive cells, fresh cells in the exponential growth phase and starved cells. In the first case an exponential growth phase culture was centrifuged, suspended at 1 mg of protein/ml in 25% SW solution, and immediately assayed. In the second, the cells were suspended in the same way and then kept at 37°C for 48 h. Both suspensions were diluted to give an approximate content of 104 cells/ml. Dilutions were made in two different buffers, 0.1 M MES in 25% SW, pH 6.0, and 0.05 M HEPES in 25% SW, pH 7.2. Similarly, 2-fold dilutions of the concentrated halocins were made in the same buffers, then 50 μl volumes of each dilution were mixed with 950 μl of each cell suspension. As a control, 950 μl of the cell suspensions were mixed with 50 μl of each buffer. After 18 h of incubation at 37°C, 0.1 ml of each mixture was plated on solid medium. Colonies were counted after 1 week of incubation at 37°C. 1-ml fractions of H. halobium cell suspension in 25% SW at 1 mg protein/ml were placed into microtubes with halocins (H4 or H6) or 25% SW as controls. All the tubes were incubated for 20 min at 37°C, then 3H2O at 5 μCi/mg of cell protein and [14C]dextran at 2.5 μCi/mg of cell protein were added to each tube, incubated for an additional 10 min and centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 revolutions/min. Aliquots (10 μl) of the supernatant fluid were added to 4 ml of scintillation liquid and counted. The remaining supernatant fluid was eliminated and the pellet, dried with filter paper, was suspended in 100 μl of 1 M NaOH and gently shaken overnight at 37°C. Aliquots (10 μl) were added to scintillation liquid and counted as above. To avoid differences in quenching, 10 μl of 1 M NaOH were added to the samples of supernatant fluid, and 10 μl of 25% SW were added to the samples of the pellets before counting the samples. Each sample was examined in triplicate and the experiment was separately reproduced twice. The internal water space (α) was calculated as a percentage of total water content of the pellet and is given by α=[( 14C 3H)pellet( 14C 3H)supernatant]×100%(Eq. 1) Intracellular pH was studied at two external pH values using buffers as in cellular lysis assay. Cell suspensions at 1 mg protein/ml were incubated for 30 min in presence of halocins and 8 μM [14C]dimethyloxazoline dione. From this point onward the methodology was the same as in the Vi study. Intracellular pH can be calculated using the Mitchell equation: ΔpH=pHin-pHout= log[[DMO]in[DMO]out(1+10pK-pHout)-10pK-pHout](Eq. 2) where pK = the dissociation constant of dimethyloxazoline dione (DMO) = 6.32 at 37°C. The membrane potential difference across the membrane was studied at two external pH values using the buffers referred to in the cellular lysis assay. 1 ml of cell suspension at 1 mg protein/ml was placed in a 37°C bath and magnetically stirred throughout the assay. After addition of halocins and 10 μCi/ml [3H]triphenylmethylphosphonium bromide (TPMP) at 2 mM final concentration, 100-μl samples were taken at 3-min intervals for 21 min and filtered through Whatman GF/F (0.7-μm pore size) filters which were previously wetted with a 20 μM TPMP solution to avoid unspecific absorbtion. The filters were then washed with 1 ml of 25% SW three times and counted as above. Each experiment was carried out six separate times. [3H]TPMP unspecific binding to the cells was measured in the same way, but the cell suspension was heated for 10 min at 80°C before starting the assay. The average of the values thus obtained were subtracted from the counts obtained for each assay. The membrane potential (Δϕ) was calculated after the appropriate correction for nonspecific absorption using the Nernst equation: Δϕ=Z×log[TPMP]in[TPMP]out(Eq. 3) where Z = 2.3 RT/F = 61.5 mV at 37°C. The proton motive force (Δp) consisting of a proton concentration gradient (ΔpH) and a membrane electrical potential (Δϕ) can be expressed as: Δp=Δϕ-ZΔpH(Eq. 4) Membrane vesicles were prepared by a freeze-thawing method (Murakami and Konishi, 1989) and suspended in 2.9 M KCl, 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM PIPES (pH 6.8) at a protein concentration of 1 mg vesicle protein/ml. The vesicle suspension was stored in a refrigerator for at least 3 days to attain equilibration of ion distribution before use. Protein was determined using BCA protein assay kit (Pierce Chemical Co. Ltd.) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Halocins H4 or H6 were added to 2 ml of the vesicle suspension and stored at 4°C in a refrigerator overnight. For the control, the same volume of the solvent was added instead of halocin solution. Light-induced pH changes of the vesicle suspension were measured by a glass microelectrode as described previously (Murakami and Konishi, 1985, 1988). The Na+-dependent fraction of the pH change was determined by repeating illumination again at 5 min after measurement of the first light-dependent pH change trace of the suspension, and the difference between the first and second pH traces was evaluated as the Na+-dependent H+ influx activity of the vesicles. The vesicles treated with halocins and also the control vesicles were washed by repeating centrifuging and resuspension in the fresh buffered salt medium, then the light-dependent pH changes were measured as above. Na+-free control experiments were done using 3 M KCl loaded vesicles. The vesicle suspension prepared above was illuminated under the same conditions used for the pH change measurement. At the defined time period of illumination, 100 μl of the suspension was taken and diluted into 1.2 ml of 6 M glycerol containing 20 mM MgSO4 in a centrifuge tube and subjected to centrifuging at 15,000 revolutions/min for 5 min at 4°C using Hitachi model CRI5B centrifuge apparatus. The pellet thus obtained was rinsed with the same dilution solution and suspended in 1 ml of distilled water. After a brief sonication, an aliquot was injected into a Dionex 4500 l model ion chromatographic apparatus equipped with CSg-12 and CS-12 columns for determining Na+, K+, and Mg2+. The elution solution and the suppressor solution used were 20 mM methane sulfonate (1 ml/min) and 40 mM tetramethylammonium hydroxide (5 ml/min), respectively. The Na+ retained in the vesicles was calculated after subtracting the external contribution of each ion obtained from the Mg2+ peak height and then compared as protein base. Each data point is the average of two independent experiments, and the determinations were duplicated for each experiment. Untreated cells retained 14C-labeled methionine, which indicates their integrity. The results obtained in treated cells after 30 min of exposure to halocins demonstrated that while those treated at or below 1640 AU/P of H4 or 820 AU/P of H6 retained 14C-labeled methionine, treatment at higher doses gave erratic values. Fig. 1 shows first that H6 kills sensitive cells more effectively than H4, as the doses needed to kill all the cells are appreciably smaller in all cases. It was evident that both halocins are more effective on energized cells, since four to six times the quantity of either halocin was required to exterminate starved ones. The halocins were most efficient at pH 7.2, which is also optimal for H. halobium growth. The Vi (internal water space in cell pellets), was calculated from the differential distribution of 3H2O and [14C]dextran. Using the modified microcentrifuging technique, we obtained appreciably smaller standard deviations than those previously reported (Bakker et al., 1976; Helgerson et al., 1983), although the average Vi value was quite similar. The percentage of internal space of the pellet (α) was 48%± 2 on the basis of 24 determinations. Intracellular volume did not change between 6.0 and 7.2 external pH. After the addition of halocins, the intracellular volume increases, and the rise was dose-dependent. At the same dosage, 820 AU/P, with H6 the intracellular volume increased by up to 40%, while halocin H4 only produced a 5% increase (Table 1).Tabled 1 As with intracellular volume our data on untreated cells are similar to that obtained by Bakker et al.(1976) for H. halobium cells. As expected ΔpH increases as the external pH decreases, and pHi between 6.0 and 7.2 external pH was almost constant, only a slight variation being discernable. The response to halocin treatment was generally a drop in pHi, except with halocin H4 at external pH 7.2, where pHi rose, indicating an essential difference between the mechanisms of action of H4 and H6 (Table 1). Table 2 presents mean values obtained for ΔpH, Δϕ, and Δp. The halocins produced a dose-dependent drop in Δϕ, which reached the lowest level after 12-15 min of treatment. This decrease was more apparent at 7.2 external pH than at 6.0, and again halocin H6 was more effective than H4. When the values were compared as a percentage with respect to the controls, at 6.0 external pH halocin H4 (1640 AU/P) induced a Δϕ drop of 11%, and H6 (820 AU/P) a drop of 22%. At 7.2 external pH, the Δϕ dropped 14% with halocin H4 (1640 AU/P) and 35% with H6 (820 AU/P).Tabled 1 Δp was dependent on external pH in all cases with treated and untreated cells, both being higher at pH 6.0 than at 7.2. Our results show that both halocins cause the Δp to decrease. The effect of halocin H6 on Δp was appreciably greater than that of H4. When the membrane vesicle of H. halobium loaded with a small amount of Na+ is illuminated with a 570 nm light, a stepwise pH change occurs in the external medium as shown in Fig. 2. Medium acidification is slightly reduced in the initial stage of illumination and then gradually enhanced. Halocin H4 did not change the pH profile significantly, but H6 considerably enhanced the initial acidification phase and the diphasic pH change disappeared. In K+-loaded vesicles, the acidification occurred in a single saturation profile without the Na+-dependent lag. When the Na+-dependent H-influx activity was determined in vesicles, the process was found to be markedly inhibited in H6-treated vesicles (Fig. 3, upper panel). The inhibitory effect of H4 was appreciably less. After washing treated membrane vesicles with fresh salt by repeated centrifuging and resuspension (Fig. 3, lower panel), the effect of H4 was completely eradicated, as shown by the fact that both the light-dependent pH change profile and the dark-decay kinetics of ΔH+ recovered to the control level. However, the washing treatment could not remove the effect of H6 (Fig. 3, lower panel). Inhibition was dependent on H6 concentration as shown in Fig. 4, and the Na+/H+ exchange process was completely suppressed at approximately 1500 AU of H6. At less than 2000 AU, H4 only slightly restricted but did not quell the process.Figure 4:Concentration dependence of halocin effect. The membrane vesicles were treated with elevated concentrations of halocins. The sample volume for measurement was adjusted to that of halocin-added samples with the solution for each halocin preparation. ○, vesicles treated with H4; •, vesicles treated with H6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The dark-decay kinetics of light-induced external ΔH+ were found to be significantly enhanced in H6-treated vesicles. On the other hand H4 significantly slowed the H+ back-flux (Table 3).Tabled 1 Fig. 5 shows that under illumination intravesicular Na+ was quickly removed from vesicles. After 6 min only 20% was retained within the vesicles. When H6-treated vesicles were illuminated only a slight reduction of less than 10% occurred. In a general sense, it is not easy to specify the mechanism of action or the primary target of a bacteriocin because of the difficulty in distinguishing primary lesions from secondary effects. In fact we show here an example of two substances whose effects on living cells are quite similar but whose mechanisms of action are different. In previous reports (Meseguer and Rodríguez-Valera, 1986; Torreblanca et al., 1990), we showed that halocins H4 and H6 induce morphological changes and lysis in sensitive cells. However, here we detected a significant difference since lysis induction is twice as effective with H6 as with H4. H6 also showed greater effectiveness in killing sensitive cells. It was also clear from our results that both halocins are more lethal on energized cells, and most potent at an external pH of 7.2, which is optimal for growth. This indicates that the halocins' primary targets are more susceptible when the membrane is energetically more active or its mechanisms are actively functioning. The determination of intracellular volume of halocin-treated cells was essential for ΔpH and Δϕ calculation. The observed increase of Vi as a consequence of halocin treatment was not surprising on the basis of the effects of H4 and H6 on the morphology of sensitive cells; after halocin addition the cells are progressively transformed into spheroplasts and ghosts. Although these changes affect final calculations of ΔpH and Δϕ, this is not the reason for the data obtained. In fact, dimethyloxazoline dione and TPMP distribution across the membrane is not dependent on Vi, and radioactivity counting with these tracers showed significant differences between treated and untreated samples. The variation of Δϕ and ΔpH consequently affects Δp calculations. It is important to note that our results in Vi, ΔpH, Δϕ, and Δp for untreated control cells are essentially the same as those obtained by Bakker (Bakker et al. 1976; Helgerson et al., 1983) for H. halobium and equivalent to those for other neutrophilic bacteria (Padan et al., 1981). Several bacteriocins and killer toxins which act on the membrane of sensitive cells have been shown to affect Δϕ. Such is the case of colicin K (Weiss and Luria, 1978), staphylococcin Pep5 (Sahl, 1985), colicin V (Yang and Konisky, 1984), and the killer toxin from Pichia kluyveri (Kagan, 1983), all of which form ion-permeable channels in sensitive cell membranes and immediately destroy the transmembrane potential difference. Halocins, conversely, did not immediately destroy the Δϕ of sensitive cells, but induced a weaker decrease. Moreover, the observed light-induced pH changes in halocin-treated cells do not corroborate the formation of ion-permeable pores. As far as we know, no bacteriocins or killer toxins have been reported which behave in the same way as halocins H4 and H6. It is widely reported and accepted that the Na+/H+ antiporter is closely involved in the regulation of intracellular pH and the control of cell volume (Padan et al., 1981; Krulwich, 1983; Booth, 1985; Grinstein et al. 1989). Further, as we mentioned above, some of the observed effects of the halocins were similar to those of DCCD which inhibits halobacterial Na+/H+ antiporter. Therefore, the effects of halocins on whole cells strongly suggest their inhibitory effects on the Na+/H+ antiporter and/or other ion transporters. Since H4 shows appreciable differences, the site of action is different from that of H6. This fact was further corroborated in membrane vesicles. The Na+/H+ antiporter activity is clearly demonstrable when a membrane vesicle suspension of H. halobium loaded with a small amount of Na+ is illuminated. It has been shown that the initial suppression of the pH change is intravesicular Na+ dependent and is caused by the Na+/H+ antiporter activity (Murakami and Konishi, 1987, 1988). As intravesicular Na+ decreases, the Na+-coupled H+ influx becomes inhibited, and thus the acidification of the medium is enhanced. Since the passive Na+ influx is quite slow, the intravesicular Na+ concentration remains low for 30-60 min in the dark, so that a marked enhancement of the external pH change occurs when illumination is repeated (upper traces in Fig. 2). Therefore, the ΔH+ between the initial and second illumination is attributed to the Na+-dependent H+ influx process and is the direct indicator of the Na+/H+ antiporter activity. The increase of the initial acidification induced by H6 shows a significant effect of this halocin on Na+/H+ antiporter activity, indeed, the Na+-dependent H+ influx activity was strongly inhibited by H6. Since DCCD produces the same pH change profile as H6, and H6 did not further affect the pH profile in DCCD-treated vesicles, H6 seems to inhibit the same Na+/H+ antiporter we previously reported (Murakami and Konishi, 1989). The dark decay kinetics of light-induced external ΔH+ were found to be significantly enhanced in H6-treated vesicles (Table 3). This is logical because in the control vesicle the electrochemical potential generated by the primary light driven pumps are accumulated in the forms of ΔpH, ΔpNa+, and Δϕ as a result of antipoter functioning (Konishi and Murakami, 1992). Furthermore, in H6-treated vesicle, ΔpNa+ is not created because of an inhibition of Na+/H+ antiporter. Thus, ΔpH which could be the major driving force for the inward flux of proton after turning off the light will be greater in H6-treated vesicle than in control. In addition, the passive proton influx through the antiporter does not occur, since our previous study showed that neither ΔpNa+ nor ΔpH activates the Na+/H+ antiporter even if the antiporter is intact (Murakami and Konishi, 1989, 1990). On the other hand, H4 rather slowed the ΔH+ dissipation rate. This is another indication that the site of action of H4 is different from H6. The H6-dependent inhibition of the halobacterial Na+/H+ antiporter was further demonstrated by measuring the intravesicular Na+ after illumination. As previously shown by 22Na+ tracer (Murakami and Konishi, 1988), intravesicular Na+ was depleted within 10 min of illumination in untreated vesicles. However, Na+ is retained in the H6-treated vesicles. This is in accordance with the inhibition of uptake of α-aminoisobutyric acid produced by halocin H6 (Meseguer et al., 1991). The amino acid transport in these microorganisms has been described as a Na+ gradient-dependent symport system (McDonald et al., 1977), which is itself generated by the Na+/H+ antiporter. Moreover, some authors have theorized that this exchanger, and the AIB transport system may have a common subunit (Krulwich, 1983). The specific target of halocin H4 is still not known. Results indicate a possible effect on passive H+ permeability of the membrane, but more experiments will be necessary to pinpoint its mechanism of action. In contrast, in the case of halocin H6, the evidence was clear. The strong binding of H6 to vesicles shown here, and to whole cells shown previously (Torreblanca et al., 1989), suggests that H6 inhibits the Na+/H+ antiporter by specifically binding to it. So far DCCD is the only inhibitor for the halobacterial antiporter, but DCCD (a carboxyl modifying reagent) also reacts with other membrane components such as H+-ATPase. The lack of any specific inhibitor for the halobacterial antiporter hinders analyses of physiological reaction or mechanism of action of Na+/H+ exchange in halophiles. The marked inhibitory effect on the Na+/H+ antiporter observed here with H6 is quite gratifying, since it not only proves the exemplary mode of the bacteriocin's action in hitting the central device utilized by halobacteria to adapt to highly saline environments, but also provides a new tool for analyzing the molecular mechanisms of halobacterial Na+/H+ antiporter.

We adapted a standard lymphocyte stimulation test to detect evidence of cellular immunity in patients with silicone gel implants. Initially, lymphocytes were harvested from 70 implant patients, 76 normal controls without implants or symptoms, and 18 patients with classic rheumatic disorders and without a history of silicone implants. The harvested lymphocytes were stimulated with PWM, PHA, Con A, and pharmaceutical grade colloidal silicon dioxide (silica). Implant patients showed increased SI compared to controls and those with rheumatic disorders. The mean SI of implant patients was 195.0 ± 19.3, 18-fold that of normal controls (< 0.0001). Patients with rheumatic disease showed the same SI as controls (P = 0.3577). A follow-up study included 220 normal controls without implants, 942 silicone gel implant patients with demonstrable rheumatic symptoms, and 34 implant patients without symptoms at the time of the study. The average SI for the 220 normal controls was 10.0 ± 0.41. Among the symptomatic implant women, 860 (91.3%) had SI significantly above those of the normal controls. Of these, 171 (18.2%) had SI between 25 and 50, 316 (33.5%) had SI between 50 and 100, and 373 (39.6%) had SI over 100.

The process of methylphosphotriester repair by the N terminus of Ada, which triggers the protein's ability to function as a transcriptional activator, has been elucidated through a combination of structural and biochemical studies on the protein. The N-terminal domain of Ada possesses a tightly bound Zn(II) ion that is necessary for proper folding in vitro and in vivo(8Myers L.C. Terranova M.P. Nash H.M. Markus M.A. Verdine G.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4541-4547Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). 113Cd nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies on the N terminus of Ada (9Myers L.C. Terranova M.P. Ferentz A.E.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14089-14094Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), a 10-kDa fragment of the N terminus of Ada that retains zinc binding and DNA MeP repair functionality (Fig. 1), reveal an unusual Cys-X3-Cys-X26-Cys-X2-Cys ligand arrangement about the metal. These structural studies identify the N terminus active site cysteine, Cys69, as one of the four metal ligand residues in Ada, thereby implicating the metal ion not only in stabilization of the protein structure, but also in direct metalloactivation of the methyl acceptor residue. In the present study, kinetics measurements and DNA binding assays on various forms of Ada were pursued to further study the effect of the bound metal on methylphosphotriester repair and sequence-specific DNA binding by the methylated N terminus of Ada (S-Me-Cys69N-Ada). The execution of these studies as well as future structural studies of the methylated form of the protein required the development of a method for specific methylation of Ada, which was accomplished by means of a singly methylated oligonucleotide. Using this synthetic substrate, it was found that although the type of metal bound by Ada altered the kinetics of DNA methylphosphotriester repair, it had little effect on the sequence-specific DNA binding properties of the S-Me-Cys69N-Ada. Quantitative electrophoretic mobility shift assays reveal that the difference in free energy of specific DNA binding by N-Ada and S-Me-Cys69N-Ada is ≈ 4.2 kcal/mol at 25°C. The synthesis of T11(OMe) was performed on an Applied Biosystems 380A DNA synthesizer using a standard coupling cycle. To a CPG-thymidine resin (Milligen), 4 units of 4,4′-dimethoxytrityl-thymidine β-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite, 1 unit of 4,4′-dimethoxytrityl-thymidine methylphosphoramidite (Sigma), then 5 more units of 4,4′-dimethoxytrityl chloride-thymidine β-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite were coupled followed by a final detritylation step. Deprotection of T11(OEtCN)9(OMe) (Fig. 2) followed the procedure of Kuijpers et al.(11Kuijpers W.H.A. Huskens J. Koole L.H. van Boeckel C.A.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5197-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), with some modifications. For a 0.2-μmol synthesis, deprotection was performed with 150 μl of 0.05 M K2CO3 in anhydrous methanol at room temperature for 7 h. The solution was neutralized by adding Dowex H+ resin (prewashed with anhydrous methanol) a few beads at a time, then checking the pH using indicator paper. H2O (200 μl) was added, the suspension was centrifuged, and the supernatant was removed. The resin was then washed with another 200 μl of H2O. The combined supernatants were evaporated and resuspended in 200 μl of TE (10 mM Tris (pH 7.0), 1 mM EDTA). These values were scaled five times for a 1.0 μmol synthesis. Control oligonucleotides were synthesized by the following procedures: (i) treatment of T11(OEtCN)9(OMe) with concentrated NH4OH, 55°C, 16 h; (ii) synthesis of an 11-mer using only 4,4′-dimethoxytrityl-thymidine β-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite (T11(OEtCN)10), followed by deprotection using (a) K2CO3/MeOH as described above or (b) concentrated NH4OH, 55°C, 16 h. Oligonucleotides were quantified by UV and used without further purification. Oligonucleotides (100-1000 pmol) were dissolved in buffer A (20 mM Tris, pH 8.1), passed through a 0.22-μm microcentrifugal filtration unit (Vanguard, Neptune, NJ), and loaded on a Pharmacia Mono Q HR 5/5 column equilibrated with 87% buffer A, 13% buffer B (buffer A plus 1.5 mM NaCl), at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. After eluting 4 ml at 13% buffer B, a 14-ml gradient was run to 28% buffer B, followed by a 1-ml gradient to 100% buffer B, a 4-ml isocratic elution at 100% B, and then a 4-ml gradient to 13% buffer B. In this system, T11(OMe) eluted at ~300 mM NaCl and T11 at ~330 mM (see below). The 17-kDa N-terminal domain of Ada (N-Ada17) was overproduced by a polymerase chain reaction-based approach using the 5′-primer for the promoter region of the vector pN-Ada20, in combination with a 3′-primer that encoded a stop codon and a HindIII restriction site following Ser153. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with EcoRI and HindIII, ligated into pKEN1(12Ezaz-Nickpay K. Uchino K. Lerner R.E. Verdine G.L. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and transformed into XA 90 to yield the overproducing phagemid pN-Ada17. The N-Ada17 protein was purified according to the same procedure used for N-Ada20(8Myers L.C. Terranova M.P. Nash H.M. Markus M.A. Verdine G.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4541-4547Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The other zinc-bound forms of Ada and its N-terminal fragments were purified as described(8Myers L.C. Terranova M.P. Nash H.M. Markus M.A. Verdine G.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4541-4547Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Cadmium-bound forms of these proteins were generated by growth in metal-supplemented minimal media as described previously(9Myers L.C. Terranova M.P. Ferentz A.E. Wagner G. Verdine G.L. Science. 1993; 261: 1164-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford assay, using as calibration standards Ada samples that had been independently quantified by amino acid analysis. Typically, between 200 and 600 pmol of protein was incubated with T11(OMe) in 6-50 μl of assay buffer (50 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.8), 10 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 50 μM spermidine hydrochloride) at different temperatures for various amounts of time. Control reactions in which the protein was omitted were also performed. The stoichiometry of the reaction was determined by either incubating varying amounts of protein (0.1, 0.5, 0.8, 1, 2, 4, and 10 eq) with a constant amount of DNA (200 pmol of total DNA) or by incubating a constant amount of protein ( ~150 pmol) with varying amounts of T11(OMe) (200, 330, 550, and 720 pmol of total DNA), at 4°C or 25°C for greater than 1 h. Overnight incubations were also carried out to ensure that the reactions had proceeded to completion. Reactions were worked up by the addition of Buffer A to 200 μl, filtration, and FPLC analyses as described above. Values were corrected for the percentage of Sp-T11(OMe) in the starting DNA (typically ~40% of total DNA) as determined by 31P NMR (13Hamblin M.R. Potter B.V.L. FEBS Lett. 1985; 189: 315-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In order to determine bimolecular rate constants (k2) for phosphotriester repair by different fragments of the protein, repair reactions were performed so that the initial concentrations of active protein and Sp-T11(OMe) were equal. Under these conditions, a plot of the reciprocal of the Sp-T11(OMe) concentration versus time is linear with slope equal to k2. Typically, 120 pmol of active protein and Sp-T11(OMe) were incubated in 21 μl of assay buffer at 4°C. The reactions were quenched at different times by addition of 180 μl of a 7 M urea solution at 4°C and immediately followed by FPLC analysis. Oligonucleotide samples (20 nmol) were digested with 0.1 unit of snake venom phosphodiesterase and 75 units of Benzonase in 10 mM MgCl2, 70 mM NaCl, 70 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) at room temperature for 45 min, and 2 units of alkaline phosphatase in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mM ZnCl2, 40 mM NaCl, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol at 37°C for 15 min. Samples were passed through a Millex 22-μm filter, then analyzed by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography on a Hewlett-Packard 1090 diode array system; solvent A: 0.02 M KH2PO4, pH 5.6; solvent B: 60:40 MeOH/H20; 1.5 ml/min; elution program: isocratic A for 1 min, 0-25% B in 10 min, 25-100% B in 5 min, isocratic B for 10 min. Authentic standards were used for comparison of UV spectrum and retention time. Nucleosides were identified by comparison with authentic standards. Blank runs in which no oligonucleotide was added to the digest served as a control for peaks that were introduced along with the protein preparations. Oligonucleotides bearing the Ada binding site “Ada box” (Fig. 1) were produced using an Applied Biosystems 380A DNA synthesizer. A synthetic 33-mer, 5′-(d-CAGCGAAAAAAATTAAAGCGCAAGATTGTTGG)-3′ (Ada box in bold), and its complement were purified by gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions (7 M urea, 20% polyacrylamide), eluted in 1 M triethylammonium bicarbonate, and concentrated using a Sep-Pak cartridge according to the manufacturer's protocols (Waters). Equimolar amounts of the complementary purified oligonucleotides were annealed and end-labeled by the polynucleotide kinase reaction following protocols provided by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). For analyzing the DNA binding properties of the unmethylated protein, Ada preparations were incubated with 32P-labeled duplex oligonucleotides containing the Ada box for 15 min in binding buffer (50 mM Tris•HCl (pH 7.8), 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 25°C. For analysis of the S-Me-Cys69Ada protein fragments with zinc incorporated, the unmethylated protein was added to a mixture of the 32P-labeled duplex 33-mer fragments and the T11(OMe) substrate (≈104 molar excess over protein concentration) and incubated for 40 min at 25°C in binding buffer. The reactions for the cadmium-containing S-Me-Cys69Ada fragments were conducted in a similar manner except that the incubation times were extended to 90 min. For binding studies in which CH3I was the methyl donor, neat CH3I (Sigma) was diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide to a concentration of 1.6 mM, added in a 1:50 ratio to a mixture of the Ada fragments plus the 32P-labeled 33-mer in binding buffer, and incubated for 30 min. The total reaction volume used in each case was 50 μl. Poly(dI•dC) was added to some binding experiments, where indicated, to test for specificity of binding. For all proteins tested, a total volume of 50 μl of reaction mixture was loaded on to a 4% polyacrylamide gel prepared in 40 mM Tris•AcOH (pH 8.2), 1 mM EDTA, and 5% glycerol. The running buffer was 40 mM Tris•AcOH (pH 8.2), 1 mM EDTA. After electrophoresis for about 2 h at 140 V/40 mA, the gels were dried under vacuum, exposed to a Fuji phosphoimaging plate, and analyzed using a Fuji Bio-Image analyzer. Binding constants were determined by the Scatchard plot method of analysis as described by Meisterernst et al.(14Meisterernst M. Gander I. Rogge L. Winnacker E.-L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 4419-4435Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Using this method, the concentration of the protein was kept constant and the dissociation constant (Kd) was derived from the following equation: [P•D]/[D] = (1/Kd) × [P]0 - (1/Kd) × [P•D], where [D] is the concentration of unbound DNA, [P]0 is the total protein concentration, and [P•D] is the concentration of the protein•DNA complex. Thus, a value for Kd can be derived from the slope of the line described above when [P•D]/[D] is plotted against [P•D]. To circumvent several problems with previous methods of substrate preparation and use (see “Discussion”), we decided to synthesize a homogenous methylphosphotriester-containing DNA substrate. For reasons of synthetic simplicity, we focused our initial efforts on synthesis of a single-stranded thymidine homopolymer containing a single, centrally located methyl phosphotriester; this molecule is designated T11(OMe) (Fig. 2). Among the objectives of the present study was to determine whether this single-stranded molecule would function as an efficient Ada substrate. T11(OMe) was synthesized according to the method described by Kuijpers et al.(11Kuijpers W.H.A. Huskens J. Koole L.H. van Boeckel C.A.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5197-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), as illustrated in Fig. 2. A resin-bound 11-mer with nine internucleotide β-cyanoethyl phosphotriester linkages and one methyl phosphotriester linkage, T11(OEtCN)9(OMe), was treated with K2CO3 in MeOH, which was expected to cleave the β-cyanoethyl protecting groups and the 3′-linkage to the support, yet leave the methyl phosphotriester largely intact. The reaction products were then analyzed by anion exchange FPLC. As shown in Fig. 3A, two products were obtained from the reaction, a major component eluting at ~10 ml and a minor one at ~12 ml. The 12-ml product was identified as the fully deprotected 11-mer, T11, since it co-eluted on FPLC with an authentic standard synthesized by conventional methods (Fig. 3C). The 10-ml peak was identified as T11(OMe) by nucleoside composition analysis, which yielded dT and T2(OMe) (data not shown). Treatment of T11(OEtCN)9(OMe) with concentrated aqueous ammonia yielded only the 12-ml peak (data not shown), consistent with the known hydrolytic lability of methyl phosphotriesters(15Westheimer F.H. Science. 1987; 235: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). The ability of anion exchange FPLC to distinguish between T11(OMe) and T11 provided a convenient means to determine both the amount of phosphotriester hydrolysis that accompanies deprotection of T11(OEtCN)9(OMe), as well as the rate and extent of methyl transfer to Ada (see below). In the several syntheses we have carried out, the ratios of T11(OMe) to T11 typically range from 75%:25% (10 μmol scale) to 90%:10% (0.2 μmol scale). By this route, it is regularly possible to synthesize milligram quantities of Ada substrate. Although for the present studies there was no need to separate T11(OMe) from T11, these should be easily separable by anion exchange chromatography, as suggested by the trace in Fig. 3A. In our hands, however, we have not been able to separate chromatographically the two diastereomeric components of T11(OMe), namely Sp-T11(OMe) and Rp-T11(OMe) (refer to Fig. 2). Incubation of T11(OMe) with the 20-kDa N-terminal fragment of Ada (N-Ada20) was found to decrease the ratio of T11 to T11(OMe) relative to the starting DNA (compare Fig. 3B with 3A). When limiting amounts of protein were added, the conversion from T11(OMe) was proportional to the protein concentration (1:1 ratio). Changing neither the incubation time from 5 min to 12 h nor the reaction temperature from 22° to 37°C had a significant effect in the product conversion, indicating that the reaction goes to completion within 5 min. Thus, even a single-stranded 11-mer is an efficient substrate for the phosphotriester repair domain of Ada. Methyl transfer reactions using excess protein over T11(OMe) invariably reached a plateau when ≈55% of the starting T11(OMe) had been converted to T11. This observation is consistent with the known stereospecificity of the methyl transfer reaction(16McCarthy T.V. Lindahl T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2683-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar); namely, Ada repairs only the Sp diastereomer and leaves the Rp diastereomer unrepaired(13Hamblin M.R. Potter B.V.L. FEBS Lett. 1985; 189: 315-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Since no specific measures were taken to impose stereoselectivity upon the synthesis of the methylphosphotriester in T11(OMe), it is to be expected that the two isomers are formed in roughly equal proportions. In contrast to the efficient repair of T11(OMe), Ada was found not to demethylate a phosphotriester-containing dimer, T2(OMe). Although no attempt was made to analyze the protein product of the reactions with T11(OMe), data discussed below reveals that methylation of Ada by T11(OMe) potentiates sequence-specific binding, consistent with the notion that T11(OMe) transfers its methyl group to Cys69 in much the same fashion as in vitro-methylated duplex DNA. To determine the relationship of Ada domain organization and the rate of phosphotriester repair, we examined a series of Ada protein species: full-length (39-kDa) Ada, the entire N-terminal domain as defined by proteolytic processing (N-Ada20)(4Sedgwick B. Robins P. Totty N. Lindahl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4430-4433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Myers L.C. Terranova M.P. Nash H.M. Markus M.A. Verdine G.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4541-4547Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and an N-terminal fragment containing the intact zinc-binding module of Ada (residues 1-92, N-Ada10), but lacking residues that are necessary for sequence-specific DNA binding(17Sakashita H. Sakuma T. Ohkubo T. Kainosho M. Sakumi K. Sekiguchi M. Morikawa K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These various forms of Ada have been expressed at high levels in E. coli and purified to apparent homogeneity; the solution structure of N-Ada10 has been reported(10Myers L.C. Verdine G.L. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14089-14094Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Furthermore, by an appropriate choice of growth conditions it is possible biosynthetically to charge the Ada fragments with either Zn2+ or Cd2+(9Myers L.C. Terranova M.P. Ferentz A.E. Wagner G. Verdine G.L. Science. 1993; 261: 1164-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, demethylation of T11(OMe) by the zinc-bound form of N-Ada20 (N-Ada20[Zn]) is complete within 5 min at 25°C; under these conditions, the reaction is too fast to obtain kinetics measurements without employing stopped flow techniques. However, by lowering the reaction temperature to 4°C, it was possible to slow the reaction sufficiently that kinetics measurements could be obtained in a straightforward manner. Through titration of the Ada fragments with T11(OMe), the activity of each protein is first determined, then used to adjust the protein concentration in kinetics measurements such that the T11(OMe) and active protein were present at unit stoichiometry. As controls, we tested for product inhibition of the methyl transfer by T11 and for DNA demethylation by thiols present in the protein preparation. End product inhibition was not observed, even when T11 was present at 1000-fold excess over T11(OMe); furthermore, concentrations of glutathione 105 times above that of Ada led to no detectable loss of T11(OMe) (data not shown). The kinetics of phosphotriester repair by the various Ada forms was determined by mixing together the protein and T11(OMe), periodically removing aliquots and quenching with urea, then analyzing the extent of conversion of T11(OMe) to T11 using the FPLC assay. The bimolecular rate constant, k2, is derived from plots of time versus the reciprocal of the T11(OMe) concentration (Fig. 4, Table 1). Not only were N-Ada20[Zn] and N-Ada10[Zn] fully active in phosphotriester repair, but they repair the lesion more rapidly than Ada itself (Table 1).Tabled 1 Structural and biochemical studies have shown that the methyl acceptor residue, Cys69, is coordinated to the metal ion in Ada. Although the zinc- and cadmium-bound forms of the N-terminal domain are very similar in structure, the two forms are likely to differ in the electronic properties of Cys69, which may manifest itself in rate differences. Indeed, the cadmium-bound forms of N-Ada10 and N-Ada20 repair methylphosphotriesters roughly 4-fold more slowly than the corresponding zinc-bound counterparts. These findings are consistent with the notion that the metal is involved in the rate-determining step for methyl transfer(9Myers L.C. Terranova M.P. Ferentz A.E. Wagner G. Verdine G.L. Science. 1993; 261: 1164-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Following methylation of Cys69, the N-terminal domain of Ada acquires the ability to bind specifically to DNA sequences in the ada and alkA promoters(7Akimaru H. Sakumi K. Yoshikai T. Anai M. Sekiguchi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To quantify the magnitude of the methylation-dependent effect on the DNA-affinity of Ada, and the effects of truncation and metal binding, we carried out a series of electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments (Fig. 5). In preliminary experiments, the ability to obtain accurate binding data was found to be dramatically affected by the conditions under which the methylation, protein-DNA incubation, and electrophoresis took place. In particular, high ionic strength buffers for the methyl transfer reaction and subsequent electrophoresis were necessary to obtain sharp bands for the protein-DNA co-complexes found with both forms of the proteins. Several additional measures were necessary to generate and maintain full activity of the methylated protein. Methylation of the N terminus is accompanied by a substantial increase in the lability of the protein toward denaturation; this can be corrected by methylating the protein in the presence of a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a specific recognition site, the so-called Ada box. The presence of the Ada box oligonucleotide, however, was observed to impede the methyl transfer reaction, presumably due to preferential binding of the unmethylated N-terminal domain to the duplex DNA. Titrations of the protein with increasing amounts of T11OMe (data not shown) revealed that methylation was most efficient when an ≈104 molar excess of T11OMe over protein was used over a 30-min incubation. On the other hand, only when the single-stranded DNA was present in 107-fold excess over duplex was competition against sequence-specific recognition observed. Lastly, to achieve full activity of the oxidation-sensitive Ada protein, it was found that it is crucial to use freshly prepared solutions of dithiothreitol in the reaction buffer. With these conditions worked out, we were able to obtain quantitative data on the sequence-specific interaction of Ada with the Ada box. To facilitate future structural studies of the protein, we have attempted to truncate Ada to the minimal fragment capable of methylation-dependent DNA recognition. The smallest Ada fragment known to retain phosphotriester repair activity, N-Ada10, lacks sequence-specific DNA binding(17Sakashita H. Sakuma T. Ohkubo T. Kainosho M. Sakumi K. Sekiguchi M. Morikawa K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Taking into account sequence homology among Ada proteins(18Hakura A. Morimoto K. Sofuni T. Nohmi T. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3663-3672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), secondary structure predictions, and limited proteolysis data(4Sedgwick B. Robins P. Totty N. Lindahl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4430-4433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we had reason to believe that an Ada fragment comprising residues 1-153 (N-Ada 17) would possess both phosphotriester repair and sequence-specific DNA binding affinities. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis of S-Me-Cys69N-Ada17[Zn] alongside S-Me-Cys69Ada[Zn] reveals that the truncated protein binds DNA with an affinity indistinguishable from that of its full-length parent (Table 2). Binding of unmethylated N-Ada17 also exhibited excellent selectivity, being unaffected by 1000-fold excess of nonspecific competitor DNA (poly(dI•dC)) (data not shown). The picomolar DNA affinity of S-Me-Cys69Ada[Zn] and S-Me-Cys69N-Ada17[Zn] rivals that of any known protein that, like Ada, binds DNA as a monomer (see (19Dubey A.K. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3167-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) for summary of DNA-protein binding constants).Tabled 1 Footprinting studies (7Akimaru H. Sakumi K. Yoshikai T. Anai M. Sekiguchi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and in vitro transcription assays (6Sakumi K. Sekiguchi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that methylation of Cys69 in Ada enables the protein to activate transcription by enhancing its specific affinity for Ada box sequences in the ada and alkA promoters. The magnitude of this enhancement, however, has not been reported. Overexpression of Ada results in activation of the ada promoters, suggesting that even the unmethylated protein possesses some specific affinity for DNA. To address this issue, we measured the specific affinities of N-Ada17[Zn] for the Ada box. Indeed, N-Ada17[Zn] was found to bind the Ada box specifically, with a Kd of 1.2 ± 0.4 × 10-8M. Thus, methylation of Cys69 in Ada stimulates binding to the Ada box ≈103-fold. Interestingly, the residual DNA affinity of N-Ada17 shows pronounced metal-ion dependence: N-Ada17[Cd] was found not to bind the Ada box"
https://openalex.org/W1551747958,"The present study in isolated rat lungs demonstrates that nitric oxide gas (.NO, 70 nM) added to the perfusate containing a small amount of hemolysate [175 microliters of lysed red blood cells (RBC) per 50 ml of Earle's balanced salt solution (EBSS)] triggered profound and sustained vasoconstriction. Vasoconstriction was not observed when .NO was added to lungs perfused with washed intact rat or human RBC or with oxyhemoglobin (Hgb 20 microM). The presence of hemolysate in the perfusate also caused vasoconstriction in response to n-acetylcysteine (50 microM), glutathione (10(-4) M), or ascorbic acid (10(-4) M) and potentiated greatly the vasoconstrictor response to 5 mM KCl. Not only .NO, but also nitroprusside (SNP) or L-arginine and paradoxically three .NO synthesis inhibitors, including N-monomethyl L-arginine, L-NAME, and nitroblue tetrazolium, which have different mechanisms of action, each caused in the presence of hemolysate large vasoconstrictive responses. Hemolysate itself enhanced O2 consumption by slices of lung; no effects of this dose of .NO on lung slice respiration were seen in the absence of hemolysate. Both Hgb and hemolysate lowered perfusate cGMP levels to the same degree suggesting that the vasoconstrictive response was not due to unique effects of hemolysate on guanylyl cyclase. Addition of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) to the hemolysate containing perfusate, or addition of a cyclooxygenase or 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, virtually abolished the .NO induced vasoconstriction. The latter data are consistent with the concept that exposure of the vasculature to hemolysate may result in the formation of peroxynitrite. However, SOD and CAT did not abolish the pulmonary vasoconstriction induced by L-arginine or by NAC. Our data indicate that hemolysate has profound effects on lung vessel tone regulation and on lung tissue mitochondrial function, yet the precise molecular mechanisms responsible for the action of hemolysate are likely to be very complex."

It has long been recognized that there are multiple classes of opioid receptors. Martin et al.(1976) initially proposed the existence of three major types of opioid receptors, termed μ, δ, and κ. These receptors exhibit distinct physiological actions and show different distributions within the central nervous system (Mack et al., 1984; Spain etal., 1985). Isoreceptors for these receptors have also been suggested (Cheng et al., 1992; Zukin et al., 1988). During the past 2 years, μ, δ, and κ opioid receptors have been cloned and sequenced (Reisine and Bell, 1993). They belong to the superfamily bearing seven transmembrane-spanning regions. These receptors are negatively coupled to adenylyl cyclase, inhibiting the formation of cyclic AMP (Chen et al., 1993; Simon, 1991); these inhibitory actions are mediated by pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding regulatory (G) proteins (Reisine and Bell, 1993). κ opioid receptors show selective affinity for the endogenous opioid dynorphin (Chavkin et al., 1982) and appear to serve a number of physiological roles including cardiovascular regulation, feeding behavior, fluid balance, modulation of anti-nociception, and temperature control, among others (Bloom, 1983). They have also been implicated in certain pathophysiological states including shock, stroke, and central nervous system trauma (Faden, 1993). Based upon selective interaction with various ligands these receptors have been divided into at least three subtypes: κ1, κ2, and κ3 (Cheng et al., 1992; Zukin et al., 1988). Rat κ opioid receptor cDNAs for the κ1 subtype have been cloned in various laboratories using different sources of tissue for RNA isolation (Chen et al., 1993; Li et al., 1993; Meng et al., 1993; Minami et al., 1993; Nishi et al., 1993).

However, the cDNA clone isolated by Minami et al.(1993) from a rat thalamus cDNA library differs from others by the break of homology at its 5′-end. Structural analysis of this 5′-portion of rat thalamus KOR cDNA clone revealed a possible extension of the open reading frame upstream from the “first” ATG codon. This observation suggests either the presence of alternative splicing in the KOR gene, recombination, or existence of different promoter regions.

The probe for κ1 OR was obtained using the RT-PCR technique. Total cellular RNA was isolated from rat brain by acidic phenol extraction (Chomczynski and Sacchi, 1987). First strand cDNA was synthesized using 5 μg of total RNA in a mixture of 5 μM oligo(dT), 5 μM of random hexamer primers, and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommended reaction conditions in 20 μl of final reaction volume. Three μl of cDNA were added to the PCR mixture containing 0.5 unit of Hot Tub DNA polymerase and reaction buffer (1 ×, Amersham Corp.), 250 μM each of dNTPs, and 1 μM of each of two amplification primers. Primers used in this PCR (sense primer: 5′-GCAACCAACATCTACAT-3′; antisense primer: 5′-AAACACCGCTTGAAGTT-3′) correspond to the most conservative OR mRNA regions. After 30 cycles (consisting of denaturing for 45 s at 94°C; annealing for 45 s at 48°C; and primer extension for 45 s at 72°C), PCR products of 746 bp were cloned into pCRII vector (Invitrogen) and analyzed by restriction mapping with Sau3AI. Six clones corresponding to κ1 OR cDNA according to restriction mapping were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using Sequenase II (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). A Wistar rat genomic DNA library made in λ DASH vector (Stratagene) was screened using a 746-bp fragment of κ1 OR cDNA labeled with [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.) by random priming (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The first screening hybridization was performed at low stringency (30% formamide, 6 × SSPE at 42°C). Individual clones were isolated after two additional rounds of plaque purification at higher stringency (50% formamide, 5 × SSPE at 42°C). Isolated clones were then analyzed by restriction mapping with numerous restriction endonucleases followed by hybridization with the same probe used for library screening. Multiple subtypes of KOR have been described according to their abilities to bind different ligands (Cheng et al., 1992; Zukin et al., 1988). The molecular origin of such variability is not clearly understood, although data suggest the possibility of either alternative splicing of the KOR mRNA precursor (Yasuda et al., 1993) or the existence of multiple genes encoding different receptors. To characterize the structure of the KOR gene and begin to determine whether multiple KOR genes exist, a rat genomic library was screened with a cDNA probe of 746 bp derived from RT-PCR of rat brain mRNA. High stringency hybridization conditions led to the isolation of 15 separate clones from 106 plaques. None of these clones spanned the entire length of the primary transcript sequence. Two sets of overlapping clones, which together covered this entire region plus over 7 kilobase pairs of sequence flanking both ends, were partially sequenced. Sequence determination of all exons and flanking regions revealed that three introns are present within this gene (Fig. 1). The exonic sequence is essentially identical to that described by other groups with the exception of several single base substitutions, most of which are in the 3′-noncoding sequence. As all KOR sequences previously reported show several substitutions when compared with one another, the genomic sequence we have determined matches that reported by Chen et al.(1993). The predicted open reading frame begins in exon 2 and is completed in exon 4. All other clones we isolated were found to overlap this same sequence, indicating no evidence of heterogeneity of KOR genes in this library screening. Southern blot analysis of rat genomic DNA was performed based on restriction mapping of the sequenced clones, which permitted us to choose specific restriction enzymes that would give a defined fragmentary pattern. With the exception of XhoI and BamHI, restriction sites for all of the enzymes were found within intron 3. Southern blots of digested rat genomic DNA hybridized with a probe spanning the coding sequence of the third and fourth exons revealed fragments of the expected sizes (Fig. 2). The absence of other hybridizing fragments fails to provide support for the existence of other genes highly homologous to KOR. We used RT-PCR to examine the possibility that different subtypes of KORs might be derived as a result of alternative splicing. Sets of primers specifying neighboring exons were used to amplify KOR sequence from total RNA of a number of rat tissues. In all cases only one KOR amplification product was observed (see Fig. 4). Recently, a murine μ opioid receptor gene was cloned and described as having three introns (Min et al., 1994). Alignments of the κ and μ opioid receptor sequences indicate that introns 2 and 3 for KOR are at identical positions with respect to introns 1 and 2 of the μ opioid receptor gene. Although one could hypothesize that intron 2 (or intron 1 of the μ opioid receptor gene) may permit alternative splicing to insert additional amino acids into the first intracellular loop, as demonstrated for the D2 dopamine receptor (Eidne et al., 1989), our results with RT-PCR did not reveal the existence of such variants for KOR. Despite the apparent lack of gene heterogeneity or alternative splicing, we discovered a mechanism that may potentially give rise to different KOR species. The 5′-sequence provided by Minami et al.(1993) appeared to differ from that described by other investigators, and we noted that the difference in this 5′-sequence corresponds to intron 1. Based on the cDNA and genomic KOR sequences, we then hypothesized that different mechanisms may give rise to KOR mRNA that would either include or lack the intron 1 sequence. To better characterize the 5′-end of KOR mRNA we used 5′-RACE to identify additional upstream sequences. When amplification was performed using an antisense primer to exon 1, an additional 176 nt were observed to match the sequence determined from the genomic clone. When 5′-RACE was performed with an antisense primer to the 3′-end of intron 1, amplification products were obtained that extended upstream into the first intron. This result further supports the possibility that at least two KOR transcripts are produced. Based on the informative sequence obtained by 5′-RACE, predictions on the approximate locations of the transcription start points can be made. Appropriate antisense primers for exon 1 and intron 1 were then designed for primer extension analysis. The primer to exon 1 gave rise to two pairs of extension products (Fig. 3) that corresponded to a sequence extending nearly 300 nt upstream of that reported previously for the cDNA (Meng et al., 1993). Within 26 base pairs upstream of both tsps are two potential TATA boxes, supporting the likelihood that the tsps have been accurately mapped. Furthermore, the spacing of these TATA boxes may help to explain why 2 pairs of tsps with equivalent spacing are observed. The primer to intron 1 also yielded two major extension products that were found close to the 5′-end of intron 1 (Fig. 3). These results are consistent with the sequence obtained earlier by 5′-RACE. It therefore appears that at least two types of transcripts are produced from the KOR gene. The first starts just downstream from one of two TATA boxes ultimately requiring excision of intron 1. This transcript corresponds to a type 1 KOR cDNA sequence reported previously (Chen et al., 1993; Li et al., 1993; Meng et al., 1993; Nishi et al., 1993), referred to here as KOR1. The second transcript begins within intron 1 and thus retains this intronic sequence in the mature mRNA. We have designated this second transcript as KORx. The sequence of intron 1 in the KORx transcript carries two additional ATG triplets followed by a peptide-encoding sequence, which is in-frame with the expected open reading frame for KOR that starts in exon 2 (Fig. 1). This implies that KORx mRNA may encode a variant of the receptor that contains additional amino acids at its NH2-terminal end. Both translation start sites contain purines located three nucleotides upstream that are known to be essential for efficient translation of eucaryotic mRNA (Kozak, 1989). However, the deduced peptide sequence of this putative amino-terminal extension shows no significant homology with any other known protein in the GenBank/EMBL data base at this date. The finding of two distinct KOR mRNA species is indicative that alternative promoters are operational in the transcriptional regulation of this gene. To examine the possibility that different promoters are active in different tissues we used nested RT-PCR on total RNA from rat brain, lungs, spleen, spinal cord, kidney, testes, and heart. To identify the KOR1 mRNA sequence, sense primers within exon 1 were used, whereas to identify KORx mRNA, sense primers within intron 1 were used. Both sets of amplifications were performed with the same antisense primers used for exon 4, thus covering nearly the entire length of the open reading frame (for details, see Fig. 4). The KOR1 species was observed in all tissues examined except kidney and testes. In contrast, KORx was found only in kidney and brain. The transcriptional mechanisms giving rise to alternate KOR mRNAs remain to be determined. The sequence upstream of exon 1 for KOR1 contains two potential TATA boxes at positions −38 and −12 nt. The mechanism for transcribing KORx likely involves the binding of an RNA polymerase II initiation complex near the junction between exon 1 and intron 1. This region is comprised primarily of exon 1 sequence, which for the KORx transcript may constitute a significant portion of its promoter. There is no TATA box within this region, but it is noteworthy that there is an NF-κB consensus recognition site and a CAAT box within 40 bp upstream of the proposed tsps for KORx. Our results demonstrate that two transcripts are derived from a single gene encoding KOR. The existence of two KOR transcripts indicates that two different promoters may regulate the expression of the KOR gene in different tissues or under different conditions and/or that different translation products may be produced. Studies are in progress to determine the functional significance of these two KOR transcripts. The potential open reading frame initiating in intron 1 may lead to the translation of a variant KOR protein having an additional peptide sequence at its amino terminus. This possibility is supported by two important observations: 1) the reading frame present in intron 1 is in-frame with the normal KOR encoding sequence and 2) expression of this novel transcript shows a discrete pattern of expression, implying that different cell types may utilize this variant KOR protein. Although up to three KOR subtypes have been hypothesized based on pharmacological data, the failure to detect other genes that encode a KOR protein and the apparent lack of alternatively spliced KOR messages do not help to clarify the molecular basis for these pharmacological KOR subtypes. Expression of KORx in brain and kidney, but not in the other tissues examined, does not correlate with the expected localization of any of the known KOR subtypes. This suggests that either KORx represents a previously undetected KOR subtype or that the pharmacological properties of KORx are not readily distinguishable from those of KOR1."

The long form of the avian β1-adrenergic receptor, which contains a carboxyl-terminal 59-amino acid extension, does not undergo agonist-promoted endocytosis. We constructed and expressed turkey β1-adrenergic receptor cDNAs with regularly spaced carboxyl-terminal truncations and studied their agonist-promoted endocytosis. Removal of 34-86 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of the turkey receptor allowed its efficient endocytosis, with optimal endocytosis observed upon removal of 59 residues. Removal of only 18 residues allowed some endocytosis. A receptor that lacks the entire carboxyl-terminal region (124 residues) was not endocytosed. We also constructed a chimeric hamster β2-adrenergic receptor with the added 59-residue carboxyl-terminal domain of the turkey receptor. The chimera was not significantly endocytosed. These data indicate that residues 450-465 in the carboxyl-terminal region of the β1-adrenergic receptor can act independently to block agonist-promoted endocytosis and that other carboxyl-terminal structures nearer to the seventh membrane span are required for endocytosis.

Upon activation by agonists, G protein-coupled receptors regulate the activity of membrane-bound enzymes, ion channels, and transport proteins by catalyzing the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins ((1Ross E.M. Neuron. 1989; 3: 141-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) for review). Prolonged agonist binding also leads to desensitization, a decrease in the magnitude of the response despite the continued presence of agonist. At least three mechanistically and temporally distinct processes contribute to the overall phenomenon of desensitization (see (2Perkins J.P. Hausdorff W.P. Lefkowitz R.J. Perkins J.P. The β-Adrenergic Receptors. The Humana Press, Inc., Clifton, NJ1990: 73-124Google Scholar) and (3Lohse M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) for review). First, agonist binding induces a rapid uncoupling of receptor from its G protein target. This process involves receptor phosphorylation by one or more protein kinases followed by binding of an inhibitory protein of the arrestin family. Second, agonist binding causes translocation of receptors from the cell surface to an intracellular vesicular compartment, probably endosomes(4Harden T.K. Cotton C.U. Waldo G.L. Lutton J.K. Perkins J.P. Science. 1980; 210: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 5Von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such agonist-promoted endocytosis, also referred to in the literature as internalization or sequestration, requires somewhat longer exposure of the receptor to agonist than does the initial uncoupling reaction. Endocytosis has been proposed to play a primary role in the resensitization of receptors(6Yu S.S. Lefkowitz R.J. Hausdorff W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 337-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, long term exposure of a receptor to agonist leads to down-regulation, the net loss of receptors from the cell. The mechanism of down-regulation is unclear but probably involves both degradation of endocytosed receptors and decreased receptor synthesis caused in part by destabilization of receptor mRNA(5Von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Waldo G.L. Doss R.C. Perkins J.P. Harden T.K. Mol.

Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19928-19933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The β-adrenergic receptors are the most thoroughly studied members of the G protein-coupled receptor family and have been prototypes in studies of desensitization. There are three distinct subtypes of the β-adrenergic receptor (designated β1, β2, and β3(10Kobilka B.K. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1992; 15: 87-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar)). 1The avian β1-adrenergic receptor differs slightly from mammalian β1-adrenergic receptors in its selectivity among some synthetic ligands(39Minneman K.P. Weiland G.A. Molinoff P.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1980; 17: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar), but it is clearly of the β1 subtype according to its sequence, the organization of its gene(34Wang J. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6488-6495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and its overall pharmacologic specificity. Although these isoforms are quite similar in primary structures, specificities for ligands and selectivities among G proteins, they display markedly different desensitization phenotypes. Upon exposure to agonist, the β2-adrenergic receptor is uncoupled, internalized, and down-regulated(2Perkins J.P. Hausdorff W.P. Lefkowitz R.J. Perkins J.P. The β-Adrenergic Receptors. The Humana Press, Inc., Clifton, NJ1990: 73-124Google Scholar, 3Lohse M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In contrast, the β3-adrenergic receptor does not undergo any of these modes of desensitization when exposed to agonists(11Nantel F. Bonin H. Emorine L.J. Zilberfarb V. Strosberg A.D. Bouvier M. Marullo S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 548-555PubMed Google Scholar). The desensitization behavior of the β1-adrenergic receptor remains unclear. Although there is general agreement that β1-adrenergic receptors undergo uncoupling in response to agonist, their endocytosis and down-regulation remain controversial. In tissues, some investigators have observed down-regulation of β1-adrenergic receptors and others have not, but results have generally not been confirmed for identical tissues and species in multiple laboratories (see (12Muntz K.H. Zhao M. Miller J.C. Circulation Res. 1994; 74: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) for review). Studies of cultured mammalian cells that express endogenous β1-adrenergic receptors indicate that these receptors undergo all three desensitization reactions(13Frederich Jr., R.C. Waldo G.L. Harden T.K. Perkins J.P. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Protein Phosphorylation Res. 1983; 9: 103-118PubMed Google Scholar, 14Neve K.A. Barrett D.A. Molinoff P.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1985; 235: 657-664PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent studies of recombinant human β1-adrenergic receptors expressed in CHW cells found desensitization but no endocytosis or degradation of receptors(15Suzuki T. Nguyen C.T. Nantel F. Bonin H. Valiquette M. Frielle T. Bouvier M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 542-548PubMed Google Scholar). The turkey erythrocyte β1-adrenergic receptor also does not display either endocytosis or down-regulation in erythrocytes, reticulocytes, or stably transfected L cells(16Simpson I. Pfeuffer T. FEBS Lett. 1980; 115: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 17Hanski E. Levitzki A. Life Sci. 1978; 22: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 18Hertel C. Nunnally M.H.

Several lines of evidence indicate that the cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal domain of the β-adrenergic receptors at least partially determines their different desensitization phenotypes(6Yu S.S.

In this study, we have examined the role of the carboxyl-terminal domain of the avian β-adrenergic receptor in modulating its endocytosis and defined separate sequences that permit and block endocytosis and shown that the endocytosis-blocking region can function when attached to other receptors.

Smith M. DNA (NY). 1984; 3: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The product was digested with XhoI and BamHI, and an XhoI-BamHI fragment of the turkey receptor cDNA was inserted. The construction of the other truncated β1-adrenergic receptor cDNAs used in this study was described previously(28Parker E.M. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9987-9996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All receptor cDNAs were inserted into the expression vector pCMV5, and the integrity of the constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing and restriction mapping. All manipulations of recombinant DNA followed standard procedures(29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Murine L cells (obtained from Dr. Neil Birnberg, Yale University) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum in an atmosphere of 92% air, 8% CO2 at 37°C. Twenty-four h prior to transfection, 5 × 105 cells were plated in 100-mm dishes. Cells were co-transfected with receptor expression plasmids (20 μg/dish) and the selection marker pRSVneo (1 μg/dish) by the calcium phosphate precipitation method(30Parker B.A. Stark G.R. J. Virol. 1979; 31: 360-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). G418-resistant cells were selected by growing the transfected cells in media supplemented with 500 μg/ml G418. Individual drug-resistant colonies were isolated after about 2 weeks and maintained in medium supplemented with 150 μg/ml G418. The binding of [125I]ICYP to β-adrenergic receptors in L cell lysates was measured as described previously(18Hertel C. Nunnally M.H. Wong S.K.-F. Murphy E.A. Ross E.M. Perkins J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17988-17994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Photoaffinity labeling of receptors with [125I]ICYP-diazirine was performed as described previously(28Parker E.M. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9987-9996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For all internalization experiments, cells were seeded at approximately 20,000 cells/cm2 and grown for 4 days. Cells were fed with fresh medium 24 h before each experiment. Agonist-induced internalization was then measured in two ways (see (18Hertel C. Nunnally M.H. Wong S.K.-F. Murphy E.A. Ross E.M. Perkins J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17988-17994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for further details). Cells were treated with 1 μM(-)-isoproterenol or vehicle (0.1 mM ascorbic acid) for 20 min at 37°C. Lysates from control or isoproterenol-treated cells were assayed for CGP12177 binding according to competition with a fixed concentration of [125I]ICYP. Internalized receptors are relatively insensitive to CGP12177(31Hertel C. Staehelin M. Perkins J.P. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Protein Phosphorylation Res. 1983; 9: 119-128PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hertel C. Müller P. Portenier M. Staehelin M. Biochem. J. 1983; 216: 669-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and, therefore, an increase in [125I]ICYP binding in the presence of CGP12177 provides an estimate of internalized receptors (33Hertel C. Affolter H. Portenier M. Staehelin M. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1984; 328: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Hypotonic lysates from control or isoproterenol-treated cells were prepared and layered on sucrose step gradients (15%, 30%, 33%, 60% sucrose, w/v, in 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4). Gradients were centrifuged for 60 min at 28,000 rpm in a Beckman SW40Ti rotor. Fractions (0.8 ml) were collected and diluted with an equal volume of 154 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4. Receptor was measured by [125I]ICYP binding as described previously, using 10 μM propranolol to define nonspecific binding(18Hertel C. Nunnally M.H. Wong S.K.-F. Murphy E.A. Ross E.M. Perkins J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17988-17994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Internalized receptors migrated preferentially at the 15-30% interface (low density peak) and plasma membrane-associated receptors migrated at the 33-60% interface (high density peak). The number of receptors in endocytic vesicles was assayed as specific [125I]ICYP binding in the low density peak that was not inhibited by 1 μM CGP12177, and the number of the receptors in the plasma membrane fraction was assayed as specific [125I]ICYP binding in the high density peak that was inhibited by CGP12177. A series of mutant turkey β1-adrenergic receptor cDNAs was constructed in which stop codons were inserted at evenly spaced intervals throughout the region that encodes the carboxyl-terminal domain (28Parker E.M. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9987-9996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). These receptors are referred to as T359, T397, T424, T449, and T465 according to the numbering of their carboxyl-terminal residues. Each truncated receptor was expressed stably in L cells, which do not have endogenous β-adrenergic receptors. We also expressed a chimeric receptor (HTCR) in which the carboxyl-terminal 59 amino acid residues of the turkey β1-adrenergic receptor were appended to the end of the hamster β2-adrenergic receptor. Several clonal cell lines expressing each receptor were isolated and used in these experiments. The level of expression of the receptors in the L cell clones ranged from 90 to 850 fmol/mg of membrane protein. In general, truncated receptors and the hamster β2-adrenergic receptor were expressed at higher levels than were the wild-type turkey β1-adrenergic receptor or the HTCR chimera. Each mutant receptor displayed the expected size according to photoaffinity labeling with [125]ICYP-diazirine followed by dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (not shown; see (28Parker E.M. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9987-9996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). When expressed in L cells, each of the receptors used here mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase by isoproterenol, as described previously for these and other constructs (see Table 2, below, and (18Hertel C. Nunnally M.H. Wong S.K.-F. Murphy E.A. Ross E.M. Perkins J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17988-17994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)).Tabled 1 The ability of the various receptors to undergo agonist-induced internalization was initially examined by determining the potency with which the hydrophilic ligand CGP12177 competes with [125I]ICYP for binding to receptors in lysates prepared either from untreated cells or from cells incubated with isoproterenol for 20 min. Sequestration in endosomes, which are relatively inaccessible to hydrophilic ligands, decreases the potency of inhibition of binding by CGP12177(31Hertel C. Staehelin M. Perkins J.P. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Protein Phosphorylation Res. 1983; 9: 119-128PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hertel C. Müller P. Portenier M. Staehelin M. Biochem. J. 1983; 216: 669-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 33Hertel C. Affolter H. Portenier M. Staehelin M. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1984; 328: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). As shown previously and in Fig. 2, treatment with isoproterenol increases the IC50 for CGP12177 binding to β2-adrenergic receptors by about 15-fold. Exposure to isoproterenol does not alter the IC50 for the turkey β1-adrenergic receptor, which is not endocytosed or down-regulated(16Simpson I. Pfeuffer T. FEBS Lett. 1980; 115: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 28Parker E.M. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9987-9996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the wild-type avian β1-adrenergic receptor, most of the truncation mutants were significantly endocytosed, as monitored by increases in the IC50 for CGP12177 (Fig. 2 and Table 1). For T424, whose carboxyl-terminal region is equivalent in length to that of the β2-adrenergic receptor, isoproterenol was as effective in promoting endocytosis as in the β2 isoform. Major shifts in the IC50 for CGP12177 were also observed for T398 and T449. Even the removal of only 18 amino acid residues (T465) permitted a small but reproducible decrease in CGP12177 potency in response to agonist, between 1.2- and 1.8-fold in 6 separate experiments. However, some carboxyl-terminal structure is apparently required for endocytosis because complete removal of the carboxyl-terminal domain beyond the palmitoylated cysteine residue (T359) produced a receptor that was not endocytosed. Although the truncation mutants and the hamster β2-adrenergic receptor were usually expressed at higher levels than the wild-type turkey β1-adrenergic receptor, endocytosis behavior did not vary notably among L cell clones that expressed the same receptor at different levels. Endocytosis therefore does not reflect only the amount of receptor present or the relative stimulation of adenylate cyclase upon exposure to agonist.Tabled 1 Addition of the extreme carboxyl-terminal domain of the turkey β1-adrenergic receptor to the body of the β2 receptor markedly diminished the effect of exposure to agonist. Exposure decreased the IC50 for CGP12177 by about 3-fold, much less than observed with the wild-type β2-adrenergic receptor but still clearly altered. Unlike the other wild-type and mutant receptors, competition by CGP12177 for ICYP binding to the chimera was usually multiphasic after exposure of cells to agonist (see Fig. 2, for example), and at least one L cell clone displayed anomalously high affinity for CGP12177 with or without prior exposure to isoproterenol (not shown). Thus, addition of the carboxyl-terminal extension of the turkey β1-adrenergic receptor to the β2 receptor significantly blocked its endocytosis, but other anomalies in its behavior made the effect less clear cut than was the case with the truncations. An alternative assessment of agonist-promoted endocytosis comes from analysis of the distribution of receptors among cellular membrane fractions after their separation by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. As shown in Fig. 3, the endocytosis of β2-adrenergic receptors is reflected by movement of receptors from a high-density peak, characteristic of plasma membrane fragments, to a low-density peak that is characteristic of endosomes (4Harden T.K. Cotton C.U. Waldo G.L. Lutton J.K. Perkins J.P. Science. 1980; 210: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 38Liao J.-F. Perkins J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 364-379PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the change in sedimentation, receptors in the endosome fraction are relatively insensitive to the hydrophilic β-adrenergic antagonist CGP12177, presumably because their ligand-binding sites face the lumen of the endosomes. Thus, β2-adrenergic receptors from cells that were not exposed to agonist fractionated primarily at high density, and ICYP binding in this fraction was blocked 90% by 1 μM CGP12177. In contrast, 55% of the β2-adrenergic receptors from cells that were exposed to isoproterenol were found in the endosome fraction. For these receptors in the low-density peak, CGP12177 blocked ICYP binding by only 18%. As shown previously (18, confirmed in Fig. 3), the turkey β1-adrenergic receptor did not undergo agonist-promoted endocytosis according to this assay. The turkey β1-adrenergic receptors remained in the high-density peak after treatment of cells with isoproterenol, and those receptors remained sensitive to CGP12177. According to this assay, T424 receptors behaved like mammalian β2-adrenergic receptors: they moved to the endosome fraction and were protected from CGP12177. In contrast, the chimeric receptors behaved like turkey β1-adrenergic receptors and remained in the plasma membrane fraction. As summarized in Fig. 4 for all mutant and wild-type receptors, the distal carboxyl-terminal domain of the turkey β1-adrenergic receptor predominantly determined the migration of receptors from the plasma membrane fraction to the endosome fraction when cells were exposed to isoproterenol. Fig. 4 shows the ratios of receptors found in endosomes and plasma membranes with and without exposure of the cells to isoproterenol. For every construct tested, fewer than 15% of the receptors were endosomal unless the cells were exposed to isoproterenol. After exposure to isoproterenol, both the hamster β2-adrenergic receptor and three truncated turkey β1-adrenergic receptors (T397, T424, and T449) were largely endocytosed. The wild-type β1-adrenergic receptor and the chimera were not detectably endocytosed. Only a minority of the T359 and T465 receptors were found in endosomes, but a low level of endocytosis was noted reproducibly. Thus, the intact carboxyl terminus of the turkey β1-adrenergic receptor can block endocytosis even of a β2-adrenergic receptor, and the behavior of the truncation mutants indicates that 18 amino acid residues is the minimum amount necessary for this function. Note that the calculations used to generate the data shown in Fig. 4 underestimate the sizes of both pools of receptors. However, calculating the ratios without reference to sensitivity to CGP12177 did not alter the overall pattern depicted in the figure. Although the turkey β1-adrenergic receptor is not endocytosed or down-regulated in response to agonist, it does undergo homologous desensitization in the form of uncoupling from G protein (16Simpson I. Pfeuffer T. FEBS Lett. 1980; 115: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The data in Table 2 indicate that truncating even the entire carboxyl-terminal region, in the T359 mutant, did not markedly diminish uncoupling. Although desensitization varied among experiments, its extent was generally 25-50% for both wild-type and mutant receptors. Likewise, attachment of the carboxyl-terminal region of the turkey receptor to the hamster β2-adrenergic receptor did not markedly influence its desensitization. Agonist-promoted internalization is a common property in the G protein-coupled receptor family, but the precise sequence motifs within these receptors that control internalization are not well defined. Diverse sequences in the cytoplasmic end of the seventh helix, the carboxyl-terminal domain, and the third cytoplasmic loop have all been implicated in initiating, inhibiting, or allowing endocytosis of receptors(2Perkins J.P. Hausdorff W.P. Lefkowitz R.J. Perkins J.P. The β-Adrenergic Receptors. The Humana Press, Inc., Clifton, NJ1990: 73-124Google Scholar, 3Lohse M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The present study defines two regions in the carboxyl-terminal domain of the avian β1-adrenergic receptors that are involved with its endocytosis. First, the endocytosis-incompetent phenotype of the T359 receptor confirms previous indications that the region just beyond the palmitoylated cysteine residue is required for endocytosis in response to agonist(6Yu S.S. Lefkowitz R.J. Hausdorff W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 337-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hausdorff W.P. Campbell P.T. Ostrowski J. Yu S.S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl.

A. 1990; 87: 5089-5093Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Second, the region between residues 450 and 465 blocks endocytosis in a receptor that is otherwise endocytosis-competent. The existence of a discrete endocytosis-blocking domain has been defined only in the avian β1-adrenergic receptor(18Hertel C. Nunnally M.H. Wong S.K.-F. Murphy E.A. Ross E.M. Perkins J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17988-17994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Parker E.M. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9987-9996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this domain accounts for the inability of this receptor to be endocytosed(16Simpson I. Pfeuffer T. FEBS Lett. 1980; 115: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 17Hanski E. Levitzki A. Life Sci. 1978; 22: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 18Hertel C. Nunnally M.H. Wong S.K.-F. Murphy E.A. Ross E.M. Perkins J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17988-17994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism whereby the carboxyl-terminal region prevents endocytosis remains unclear. When these same truncation mutants are expressed in Sf9 cells, we found that several other phenotypes coincided with restoration of endocytosis(28Parker E.M. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9987-9996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although their intrinsic affinities for β-adrenergic ligands are unaltered, the truncation mutants are more active stimulators of adenylyl cyclase in Sf9 cell membranes than are wild-type receptors. They stimulate somewhat in the absence of agonist, produce greater maximal activities in the presence of agonists, and are strikingly more sensitive to weak partial agonists. Their affinities for agonists are also more sensitive to guanine nucleotides. Last, the truncated receptors are expressed at higher levels and are more easily solubilized by mild detergents than are the wild-type receptors, which predominantly remain in the pellet after extraction with digitonin, dodecyl maltoside, or several other detergents(28Parker E.M. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9987-9996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These diverse effects led us to suggest that the carboxyl-terminal region may anchor the receptors either to cytoskeleton or to some other detergent-insensitive structure, such as caveolae. Such anchorage would both prevent their movement to coated pits, the site of endocytosis, and limit their access to G proteins. Several G proteins are found in caveolae, and the behavior of several G protein-coupled receptors is strongly influenced by drugs that interact with the cytoskeleton(35Insel P.A. Koachman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9717-9723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Rudolph S.A. Greengard P. Malawista S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3404-3408Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 37Simantov R. Sachs L. FEBS Lett. 1978; 90: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The putative anchoring region at the carboxyl terminus of the turkey β1-adrenergic receptor evidently constitutes an independent structural and functional domain within the protein. Its removal from the turkey receptor does not damage receptor function, and its addition to the hamster β2-adrenergic receptor confers the phenotypes characteristic of the turkey receptor. According to analysis by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, the HTCR was not endocytosed at all in response to agonist (Figure 3:, Figure 4:). Its behavior in the CGP12177 competition experiments also indicated marked blockade of endocytosis, although interpretation of the data was not straightforward (Fig. 2, Table 1). From the biphasic shape of the competition curve shown in Fig. 2 and observed in other experiments, it appears that endocytosis of most of the receptors was totally blocked, but that a minority of HTCRs were protected from CGP12177. This might indicate that a few HTCRs are mis-sorted in the cell or that some undergo intracellular proteolysis to lose the anchorage domain. The functional independence of the carboxyl-terminal anchorage domain is particularly striking because it is encoded by a 3′ exon separate from the exon that encodes the rest of the receptor. The receptor RNA is alternatively spliced to yield either the long (full-length) receptor or a short receptor that is equivalent to T424(34Wang J. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6488-6495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, a cell can use a single gene to express β1-adrenergic receptors that either are or are not endocytosed in response to continued exposure to agonist. The experiments reported here specify a small region of the turkey β1-adrenergic receptor that inhibits agonist-promoted endocytosis. Removal of only 18 carboxyl-terminal amino acids permitted some endocytosis, as measured either by increased protection of the receptors from inhibition by the hydrophilic antagonist CGP12177 (Fig. 2, Table 1) or by movement of receptors to small, sealed vesicles (Fig. 4). Complete restoration of endocytosis was observed in the T449 mutant, in which 34 amino acid residues were removed, and little further effect was observed in T424 or T397. The region between 450 and 470 is therefore primarily responsible for anchoring the receptor in the plasma membrane. The small amount of endocytosis of the T465 mutant might reflect partial loss of the relevant structure, but it seems more likely that the important region lies between residues 449 and 465 and that the T465 phenotype reflects improper folding of that region. This conjecture is intuitively supported by the finding that residues 449-467 are conserved in the 3′ open reading frames of the monkey and rat β1-adrenergic receptor genes(34Wang J. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6488-6495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The sequence of this region is unremarkable and has only slight homology to other known proteins(34Wang J. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6488-6495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Regardless, the mapping of the anchorage domain in the present study is now fine enough to allow site-directed mutagenesis to determine its important structures. In addition to their failure to endocytose, turkey β1-adrenergic receptors are not down-regulated in response to agonist(16Simpson I. Pfeuffer T. FEBS Lett. 1980; 115: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 17Hanski E. Levitzki A. Life Sci. 1978; 22: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 18Hertel C. Nunnally M.H. Wong S.K.-F. Murphy E.A. Ross E.M. Perkins J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17988-17994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, a spontaneous mutant that has lost the carboxyl-terminal domain is both efficiently endocytosed and down-regulated(18Hertel C. Nunnally M.H. Wong S.K.-F. Murphy E.A. Ross E.M. Perkins J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17988-17994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the anchorage domain blocks down-regulation because it blocks endocytosis, a likely precursor to receptor degradation(2Perkins J.P. Hausdorff W.P. Lefkowitz R.J. Perkins J.P. The β-Adrenergic Receptors. The Humana Press, Inc., Clifton, NJ1990: 73-124Google Scholar). In many cells, however, down-regulation reflects both synthesis and degradation of receptors. Because the synthesis of recombinant receptors under the control of plasmid-born regulatory elements may not provide a valid image of physiological regulation, we have not studied down-regulation of the truncation mutants. On the other hand, the retention of agonist-promoted desensitization by all of the mutants (Table 2), which is characteristic of avian β1-adrenergic receptors, argues that the carboxyl terminus of the β1-adrenergic receptor is not required for receptor-G protein uncoupling. The carboxyl-terminal domain thus restricts long term removal of receptors by endocytosis and degradation while allowing desensitization mediated by uncoupling from G protein."

Group I (control) received neither PG-APS nor inhibitor. Group II (disease-treated) received PG-APS intraperitoneally (IP) and P8720 orally. Group III (disease-untreated) received PG-APS IP. Anemia was evident at 49 h in group III but was not present (P < 0.01) in groups I and II. Spleen weight was significantly decreased in group II compared to group III. Acute arthritis progressively developed in group III from 27 to 49 h, but P8720 decreased the joint swelling in group II by 61% (P < 0.0005). We observed a significant fall in prekallikrein and factor XI (P < 0.01) in groups II and III but not in group I. The decrease in the functional levels of high molecular weight kininogen (P < 0.05) observed in group III were prevented by P8720 in group II. The changes in T-kininogen and alpha 1-inhibitor 3 acute-phase proteins were partially prevented by P8720. We conclude that the inflammatory reactions leading to arthritis and anemia, as well as the acute-phase reaction, are due in part to contact activation, and that specific kallikrein inhibitors may have therapeutic potential."

Digital transfer of the data was selected to preserve the integrity of each image, circumventing the need for the user to scan the images back into a digital format for use with their software. These images should be useful to physiologists, neuroscientists, veterinarians, anatomists, and teachers. Reconstructing these 2-dimensional images into 3-dimensional structures is an effective media for conveying spatial anatomical information in a quick and comprehensive manner."
https://openalex.org/W2112939526,"Aspartylglycosaminuria (AGU) is the most common disorder of glycoprotein degradation. AGU patients are deficient in glycosylasparaginase (GA), which results in accumulation of aspartylglucosamine in body fluids and tissues. Human glycosylasparaginase was stably overexpressed in NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts, in which the unusual posttranslational processing and maturation of the enzyme occurred in a high degree. The recombinant enzyme was isolated as two isoforms, which were both phosphorylated, and actively transported into AGU fibroblasts and lymphoblasts through mannose-6-phosphate receptor-mediated endocytosis. The rate of uptake into fibroblasts was half-maximal when the concentration of GA in the medium was 5 x 10(-8) M. Immunofluorescence microscopy suggested compartmentalization of the recombinant enzyme in the lysosomes. Supplementation of culture medium with either isoform cleared AGU lymphoblasts of stored aspartylglucosamine when glycosylasparaginase activity in the cells reached 3-4% of that in normal lymphoblasts. A relatively small amount of recombinant GA in the culture medium was sufficient to reverse pathology in the target cells, indicating high corrective quality of the enzyme preparations. The combined evidence indicates that enzyme replacement therapy with the present recombinant glycosylasparaginase might reverse pathology at least in somatic cells of AGU patients."

Thus, the presence of all four kinases as obligatory activities in L. acidophilus may well be unique among the bacteria. Its thymidine kinase closely resembles the E. coli enzyme (8Okazaki R.

Ikeda, personal communication. whereas the other three deoxynucleoside kinase activities are uniquely organized into heterodimeric proteins containing subunits highly specific for the phosphorylation of dCK/dAK or dGK/dAK, respectively. The subunits of each pair have very recently been separated, identified functionally, and partially sequenced(9Ikeda S. Ma G.T. Ives D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5328-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar); the N-terminal sequences of all of these subunits appear to be very similar but not identical. While it is unclear what advantage is conferred by the separate expression of two subunits specific for deoxyadenosine, it is known that the total activities toward deoxyadenosine, deoxycytidine, and deoxyguanosine are about equal when both of the deoxyadenosine kinases are allosterically activated by half-saturation of the opposing subunit with deoxycytidine and deoxyguanosine, respectively(10Deibel Jr., M.R.

Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6235-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In addition, each activity is controlled by means of end product inhibition by its respective deoxynucleoside triphosphate, which apparently binds to both the nucleoside and triphosphate sites in the manner of a bisubstrate analog, thereby achieving feedback control in a nonallosteric fashion(9Ikeda S. Ma G.T. Ives D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5328-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), as has also been proposed for human deoxycytidine kinase(12Kim M.-Y. Ives D.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9043-9047Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). So that the mechanisms of these effects on the enzyme proteins can be studied by chemical and physical means, it is clearly desirable to clone their genes and to express greater quantities of these proteins. It is also of great interest to learn how these genes are organized for expression by the bacterial genome. Molecular cloning of the deoxyguanosine/deoxyadenosine kinase has now been achieved and the DNA sequences determined. Development of a cloning probe was complicated by the presence of the highly conserved glycine-rich ATP-binding site very near the N terminus (9Ikeda S. Ma G.T. Ives D.H.

A DNA probe representing the coding sequences of the N-terminal 26 amino acids was amplified by PCR with thermostable Taq polymerase(16Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (13279) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA (1 μg) was subjected to PCR for 30 cycles in a total volume of 50 μl containing 3 and 5 μM degenerate sense and antisense primers, respectively, and 200 μM each of dNTPs (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP), 1 × buffer (50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.4, and 2.5 mM MgCl2), and 1.25 units of Taq polymerase. The DNA samples were denatured at 94°C for 1 min, annealed at 37°C for the first five cycles and at 50°C for the subsequent 25 cycles for 1 min, and extended at 72°C for 30 s. The desired 93-bp product was extracted from agarose electrophoresis gel and reamplified by PCR under the conditions described above, except for annealing at 50°C throughout all 30 cycles. Finally, using the reamplified PCR 93-bp product (1 ng) as a template, PCR was repeated using 150 μM dATP and 50 μM biotin-7-dATP, for 20-30 cycles of amplification. Colony hybridization was performed by established procedures(17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), but signals were detected nonisotopically by the Photogene nucleic acid detection system (Life Technologies, Inc.), as described in the manual. Colonies grown to 2-3-mm diameter on LB plates containing ampicillin were resuspended in 50 μl of TTE buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and 2 mM EDTA). Pooled suspensions of 10-20 colonies were screened by the PCR reaction. After boiling for 5 min to lyse the cells and centrifuging, 5 μl of the supernatant fraction were used directly to provide templates for PCR, amplifying for 35 cycles (see “Results” for primers used). In this manner, about 200 colonies could easily be screened in 10 reactions. Each colony of the 20-clone pool giving a positive PCR reaction was screened individually by PCR and a clone selected. Plasmid DNA templates used for double-stranded sequencing were purified on a Qiagen tip-20 column. Restriction fragments of the positive clones were subcloned into pBluescript, and DNA sequences were determined using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method of Sanger et al.(18Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (51941) Google Scholar), labeling the fragments with [32P]dATP or dATP-α-[35S]thiophosphate. Asymmetrical PCR was employed to generate single-stranded enriched DNA (19Mihovilovic M. Lee J.E. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 14-16PubMed Google Scholar, 20Gyllensten U.B. Erlich H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7652-7656Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar, 21McCabe P.C. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Application. Academic Press, New York1990: 76-83Google Scholar) so that the probe could be sequenced directly. Sense and antisense primers were at a 1 to 20 molar ratio, or vice versa. The lower concentration primer was set at 10 nM so it would be depleted after 10-15 cycles, and 1-10 ng of template DNA were used. Other reaction components and concentrations were the same as for the regular PCR described above. In the last cycle, the reaction was extended at 72°C for 7 min. Single-strand enriched PCR products were purified on a Qiagen tip-5 column, and DNA sequencing was performed, with the lower concentration PCR primer as the sequencing primer. Extraction and Purification of Enzymes from E. coli Clones-Transformed E. coli XL1-Blue cells were grown at 37°C in LB broth containing 75 μg/ml ampicillin to an A600 of about 1.0, harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in extraction buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 3 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol) containing 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and opened by sonication, on ice. Crude extracts were further purified by streptomycin fractionation, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and dATP-Sepharose affinity chromatography(15Deibel Jr., M.R. Ives D.H. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 22Ikeda S. Ives D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13373-13381Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). At the outset of this work, the only amino acid sequence information available on the Lactobacillus deoxynucleoside kinases was that of the N-terminal 28 residues of the the combined dCK/dAK subunits (13Ikeda S. Swenson R.P. Ives D.H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8648-8652Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) from enzyme purified to homogeneity, in very small quantities, by dCTP-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Several factors prevented the successful application of mixed oligonucleotide probes, including highly degenerate codons, a conserved ATP-binding site near the N terminus, and finding two different amino acids at several residue positions in the sequence. By employing the PCR, a cloning probe with most of the sequence degeneracy eliminated (and therefore one with a higher degree of specificity) has been constructed on the basis of that sequence. The sense primer for the PCR reaction, 5′-tgctctagATGATXGTN(CT)TN(AT)(GC)NGG-3′ (a 17-mer, degeneracy of 1536), comprised the coding sequence of amino acids 1-6 plus an XbaI restriction site added to the 5′ end (N denotes T+C+A+G, X denotes T+C+A). The antisense primer 5′-cggaattcT(TG)NGTNCCNA(GA)(GA)TA-(TC)TT-3′ (a 17-mer, degeneracy of 1024), contained the complementary coding sequence of amino acids 26 to 21, with an EcoRI site added to its 5′ end. Thus, the putative template sequence in the genomic DNA should be 77 bp, and the amplified PCR product, including the added restriction sites, should be 93 bp. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the PCR product showed that the sequence between the primers correlated precisely with the amino acid sequences of dCK/dAK and was nondegenerate. Within the primer regions, however, the sequence was occasionally unclear, indicating utilization of multiple oligonucleotides from the mixture by the PCR reaction. More recent results, in which N-terminal peptide sequences of the separate subunits have been determined and functional identities assigned, make it clear that this probe could hybridize with the genes of any of the four subunits of dCK/dAK or dGK/dAK since their N-terminal amino acid sequences are nearly identical(9Ikeda S. Ma G.T. Ives D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5328-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The 93-bp PCR product was then labeled nonisotopically with biotin by incorporating biotin-dATP during PCR amplification, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The biotinylated 93-mer PCR product was used as a probe in the identification and isolation of one or more of the Lactobacillus deoxynucleoside genes. A 3.4-kb XbaI-digested genomic fragment hybridized strongly to the probe. Colony hybridization revealed two positive clones out of more than a thousand recombinants from an XbaI library, which was constructed in the pBluescript vector in E. coli XL1-Blue cells. Both clones were found to contain a 3.4-kb XbaI insert that hybridized to the probe, and the nucleotide sequences revealed apparently tandem genes, but with one-third of the 3′ end of the putative second gene missing from the XbaI fragment. No activity could be detected toward any deoxynucleoside substrate, so we could not determine which enzymes were represented by these partial clones. Because the 3′ end of one of the paired genes was missing, a new library had to be constructed. To be certain of cloning the same genes, a more specific probe was prepared by PCR. A new sense primer, 5′-ACTAGTTAACGAATAGAAGG-3′, a 20-mer reflecting the short noncoding sequence between the tandem genes, was used, keeping the original antisense primer. This new probe was therefore a 117-mer specific for the beginning of the fragmentary gene. Knowing that the 5′ to 3′ orientation of the genes was from the KpnI to XbaI, the 2.5-kb KpnI genomic fragment that hybridized to the probe on the Southern blot could be expected to include all of the downstream gene. Therefore, a partial genomic library was constructed from the 2-4-kb region of a KpnI digest, also in pBluescript, and transformed into the E. coli XL1-Blue cells. After initially screening more than a thousand recombinants by colony hybridization with the new probe, a secondary PCR screening of groups of 20 colonies was carried out, using the primers employed in constructing the probe. Then, each colony of the pooled group which gave rise to the expected 117-bp fragment was screened individually by PCR. A positive clone, GTM-K48, was identified and was found to contain nucleotide sequences encoding the N-terminal amino acids of dAK and dCK (or dGK). The coding and the complementary strands of the entire 2.5-kb KpnI insert have been sequenced. Sequencing strategies involved subcloning and “gene-walking,” using additional sequence-specific primers. The nucleotide sequence revealed two open reading frames (ORF). The nucleotide and derived amino acid sequences of the two genes are shown in Fig. 1. The first ORF is 648 bp in length, with the 215 codons encoding a peptide with a predicted size of 25 kDa. The N-terminal sequence encoded in this gene exactly matches the known amino acid sequence of residues 2-28 of wild-type dAK(9Ikeda S. Ma G.T. Ives D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5328-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This gene is terminated by a single translation stop codon (TAG) and is separated from the next ORF by a 21-bp spacer. The next 675-bp ORF encodes a peptide of 224 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 26 kDa. The N-terminal sequence inferred from the DNA of this gene is identical to that determined for the purified peptide of dGK, except for the initial methionine, but it also matches the sequence of the dCK subunit residues 2-28(9Ikeda S. Ma G.T. Ives D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5328-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 13Ikeda S. Swenson R.P. Ives D.H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8648-8652Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, from a determination of the activities expressed (see below) we find that we have cloned the genes for the dGK/dAK pair. Weak “-10” and “-35” promoter elements precede the dAK gene, with the sequences TACACT and TTGTTT beginning at nucleotide positions −39 and −63, respectively. Additional promoter elements known to be conserved among Gram-positive bacteria (23Graves M.C. Rabinowitz J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11409-11415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are also found. The first is the “-45” A cluster (AAAAA) beginning at nucleotide −72; the second is the T sequence at nucleotide −75; and finally the TG sequence at nucleotides −44. The sequence GAAAGA, 6 bases upstream from the translation start codon of the dAK gene, is a variant of the consensus ribosome-binding site. Preceding the second gene (the dGK gene), sequences homologous to the “-10” and “-35” promoter elements are positioned at 141, 259, 331, and 355 bases upstream from the initiation codon of the second gene and overlap the coding region of the first gene. However, since none of the conserved Gram-positive promoter elements precedes the second ORF and also since possible promoter elements are not close to the gene, it is likely that only one promoter functions in the transcription of both genes. There is also a putative ribosome-binding site 6 bases upstream from the initiation codon of the second gene, with the sequence GAAGGA. Just 4 bases downstream from the translational termination codon (TAA) of the second gene, a sequence having the characteristics of a transcription terminator (24Platt T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 339-372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is seen. A GC-rich region of dyad symmetry, AAAACTGCGGTCCA and TGGATCGCAGTTTT (marked by arrows in Fig. 1), which in the transcript may form a stem and loop hairpin structure, is followed by a stretch of thymidines (positions 1531-1536), another feature of transcription terminators. No such characteristic sequence is observed near the stop codon of the dAdo kinase gene, so it seems likely that the two subunits are transcribed as a polycistronic mRNA. Lysates of E. coli XL1-Blue cells containing the pBluescript vector with or without insert (control) were assayed for all three deoxynucleoside kinase activities: dCK, dGK, and dAK. Enzyme activities of dGK and dAK, but not dCK, were observed in the crude extract of the KpnI clone. Addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside to activate the lac promoter of the vector did not further increase the kinase activities, indicating that the dAK/dGK was expressed by means of its endogenous promoter. Specific activities for both dAdo phosphorylation and dGuo phosphorylation in the crude extract of the KpnI clone were more than 10-fold higher than in protein extracted from wild-type Lactobacillus. To verify that this cloned dGK/dAK is similar to the wild-type Lactobacillus dGK/dAK, the enzyme activities were tested for allosteric interactions and end product inhibition. Like the wild-type enzyme, the cloned dAK in crude extract was activated about 5-fold by 0.1 mM dGuo, and also was inhibited 90% by 0.5 mM dATP; dGK was also potently inhibited by 0.5 mM dGTP, with only 5% activity remaining. However, dCyd has no stimulating effect on dAdo phosphorylation, again indicating that the dAK cloned is the one associated with the dGK, not with the dCK subunit. The cloned dGK/dAK could be purified to apparent homogeneity by dATP-Sepharose affinity chromatography in exactly the same fashion as the wild-type enzyme(22Ikeda S. Ives D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13373-13381Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The specific activities of the pure enzyme were 1000 and 65 units/mg for dGK and dAK, respectively, compared with 2000 and 250 units/mg for the wild-type enzyme. We suspected that these differences might be due to differences in the processing mechanisms in Lactobacillus versus the E. coli host. Comparing the inferred N-terminal amino acid sequences with sequences of wild-type dGK and dAK subunits, obtained previously(9Ikeda S. Ma G.T. Ives D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5328-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), reveals two discrepancies (Fig. 2). The cloned dAK gene has codons for two additional amino acids (Thr-Val) immediately following the initial methionine, and the initiating methionine encoded in the cloned dGK gene is missing from the wild-type dGK protein sequence. While it is not uncommon to have the initial methionine processed off, the Lactobacillus strain seems to possess some sort of a mechanism to remove the Thr and Val residues, while leaving the initial Met. Preliminary N-terminal sequence analysis was performed on the purified dimeric expressed protein, anticipating two residues per cycle if the cloned enzyme were identical to wild type. However, each cycle yielded only one amino acid residue, in order: Thr, Val, Ile, Val, Leu, and Ser, exactly as found in the wild-type dGK subunit. The absence of N-terminal Met may have one of two interpretations. It could have been processed off of both subunits identically, or these results could mean that the dAK subunit is blocked when expressed in E. coli, and that only dGK could be sequenced. The latter seems more likely, since only about 25% of the total protein appeared to be sequenceable. The purified cloned dGK/dAK migrated at the same rate on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as the wild-type dGK/dAK, both at pH 9.5 (the pH in the running gel of the Laemmli system) and at pH 6.8 in the multiphasic zone electrophoresis 3328.IV buffer system(25Jovin T.M. Biochemstry. 1973; 12: 891-898Google Scholar), consisting of BisTris/TES and BisTris/Cl buffers, employed by Moos et al.(26Moos Jr., M. Nguyen N.Y. Liu T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6005-6008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the latter buffer system, the subunits were resolved into two bands, just as they were with wild-type enzyme (9Ikeda S. Ma G.T. Ives D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5328-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) (results not shown). Sequences of the dAK and dGK genes cloned from Lactobacillus were analyzed by the computer software DNAStar, revealing a 65% identity overall in the two DNA sequences. Furthermore, alignment of amino acid sequences inferred from the dAK and dGK genes reveals 61% identity between the two subunits in the 215 amino acids which overlap (Fig. 3). Regions that are highly conserved in other groups of proteins are marked in boldface type. Three regions in each of the two peptide sequences seem to be highly conserved in other phosphotransferase enzymes: (i) glycine-rich sequences, characteristic of ATP-binding sites(13Ikeda S. Swenson R.P. Ives D.H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8648-8652Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), located very near the N terminus of each peptide; (ii) sequences containing the Asp-Arg-Ser motif, 78-80 amino acid residues from the N termini, and which by analogy with many viral thymidine kinases (27Balasubramaniam N.K. Veerisetty V. Gentry G.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 2979-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) might be related to the nucleoside binding sites; and (iii) arginine-rich regions, located about two-thirds of the way along the length of each peptide, thought to participate in the binding of ATP phosphate groups. Recent reports of sequences inferred from several mammalian deoxycytidine kinase clones prompted us to attempt multiple alignment with human(28Chottiner E.G. Shewach D.S. Datta N.S. Ashcraft E. Gribbin D. Ginsburg D. Fox I.H. Mitchell B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1531-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), mouse(29Karlsson A. Johansson M. Eriksson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24374-24378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and rat (GenBankTM accession no. L33894) dCKs (which are nearly identical to one another). These results are shown in Fig. 4. Groups of residues in common are found over the entire sequence, especially for dGK, and fairly close homology with the glycine- and arginine-rich regions is seen, as with the viral TKs. Moreover, the DRS motifs of the Lactobacillus dGK and dAK both align with a considerably longer dCK sequence (beginning with a glutamate rather than an aspartate, yielding the consensus sequence D/E-R-S-I/V-Y-X-D). These similarities suggest that the Lactobacillus dAK and dGK, in particular, bear a closer relationship with mammalian deoxycytidine kinases than with various thymidine kinases for which the homology lies mainly in the ATP-binding motifs and the very limited DRS/H triad. Evidence for the functional significance of the DRS motif in Lactobacillus dGK/dAK is the subject of a companion study(30Hong Y.S. Ma G.T. Ives D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6602-6606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Finally, it is interesting to note that one other region, residues 153-161 of the dGK subunit (site iv), is homologous to the highly conserved region G-2 of p21ras and other Ras-like proteins(31Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2644) Google Scholar, 32Markby D. Onrust R. Bourne H.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1895-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), as seen in Fig. 5. There is nearly a perfect match between this dGK motif and that of the Ras consensus, whereas only 4 of 9 dAK residues are identical with those of the Ras motif. Perhaps the most significant observation to be made now is the fact that the dGK sequence includes the threonine, which, in the p21ras sequence, is critical for GTP hydrolysis. While the closely related structure, dGTP, is bound by dGK, there is no evidence that it is hydrolyzed there. Thus, it would appear that this sequence has been adapted to a somewhat different function in the Lactobacillus dGK. dGK/dAK plays an essential role in generating the deoxyribonucleotide precursors, dGTP and dATP, for DNA metabolism in L. acidophilus R-26. Recently, workers in this laboratory have purified the paired wild-type dGK/dAK to homogeneity by the successive application of dCTP-Sepharose and dATP-Sepharose affinity chromatography and have demonstrated that the enzyme is composed of two nonidentical subunits of similar molecular mass ( ~26 KDa)(9Ikeda S. Ma G.T. Ives D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5328-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 22Ikeda S. Ives D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13373-13381Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). N-terminal amino acid sequences of each subunit of dGK/dAK, as well as of dCK/dAK, have also been determined. The technique of differential tryptic digestion of one subunit (with the other subunit under the protection of its respective triphosphate end product) has pinpointed the dGuo phosphorylation site to one subunit, whereas the dAdo phosphorylation site is on the other(9Ikeda S. Ma G.T. Ives D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5328-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Clone GTM-K48 contains two intact genes, separated by a 21-bp spacer and a single translation termination codon. This tandem arrangement, with a functional promoter upstream and a transcription terminator loop downstream, suggests that a polycistronic message for the two subunits is transcribed from a new operon of Lactobacillus. The amino acid sequence inferred from the upstream gene matches the known N-terminal sequences of dAK, and the downstream gene corresponds to those of either dGK or dCK (after processing). However, the gene products that are readily expressed in active form in the E. coli host are specific for dGuo and dAdo only, not for dCyd. Identities of the two genes as those of dGK/dAK are further supported by the allosteric interaction and product inhibition patterns characteristic of dGK/dAK(30Hong Y.S. Ma G.T. Ives D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6602-6606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The cloned enzyme appears to be identical to the wild-type Lactobacillus enzyme in virtually every respect. It was purified to homogeneity by dATP-Sepharose affinity chromatography exactly like the wild-type enzyme(22Ikeda S. Ives D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13373-13381Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Also like wild-type enzyme, the pure cloned enzyme exhibits an apparent subunit mass of ~26 kDa upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Laemmli system, pH 9.5), and it is resolved into nonidentical subunits of 25 and 26 kDa by the multiphasic zone electrophoresis 3328.IV buffer system at pH 6.8. These results, taken together with the genetic and kinetic data from our companion study(30Hong Y.S. Ma G.T. Ives D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6602-6606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), clearly demonstrate that the first of the tandem cloned genes encodes dAK and the second gene encodes dGK. This tandem arrangement of the genes on the Lactobacillus chromosome, the presence of a functional promoter sequence preceding the dAK gene, and the apparent transcription terminator loop following the dGK gene strongly suggest that a polycistronic message is encoded in the transcription step, and this is a subject for further investigation. Further study is needed also to learn whether the apparent deletion of the N-terminal threonine and valine (codons 2 and 3) from wild-type dAK subunits, but with retention of the initiating methionine, represents some new type of post-transcriptional or -translational modification occurring in lactobacilli. Given the fact that the first 19 codons of dAK are identical with those of dGK, it is difficult to see how such a mechanism could be applied selectively to dAK. Another surprising observation to be drawn from the inferred amino acid sequences, is that, unlike mammalian dCKs which require thiols for activity(33Durham J.P. Ives D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 2276-2284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Datta N.S. Shewach D.S. Hurley M.C. Mitchell B.S. Fox I.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), neither subunit of the cloned dGK/dAK contains a cysteine (nor is thiol required for activity). The absence of cysteine from wild-type enzyme has been confirmed by amino acid analysis of carboxymethylated protein. 3S. Ikeda, personal communication. The dAK subunit has but one tryptophan, while dGK has two. Codon usages of the dGK/dAK genes are similar to other L. acidophilus genes in that they appear to have a preference for U and A in the third base of synonymous codons. This bias against codons ending in G or C also appears in Lactobacillus helveticus and Lactobacillus lactis, but is less pronounced in other Lactobacillus species(35Pouwels P.H. Leunissen J.A.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A search of GenBankTM has yielded both some predictable comparisons and some surprising new relationships. Multiple alignment of the dAK and dGK amino acid sequences with those of the thymidine kinases (not shown) has revealed two sequences common to most purine nucleotide-binding proteins (sites i and iii highlighted in Fig. 3), plus the very short DRS/H motif (site ii), which appears to be required for TK activity and maps close to residues which, when mutagenized, affect the Km for thymidine in herpesviral thymidine kinases(36Dube D.K. Parker J.D. French D.C. Cahill D.S. Dube S. Horwitz M.S.Z. Munir K.M. Loeb L.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11760-11767Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 37Gentry G.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1992; 54: 319-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 38Munir K.M. French D.C. Dube D.K. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6584-6589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, except for these conserved motifs, the bacterial dGK/dAK bears little homology with the thymidine kinases from various sources. The highly conserved arginine-rich region with the consensus sequence, R-X-X-X-R-X-R, and found at amino acid residue positions 140-146 (site iii) of dGK and dAK, is a common element of all the deoxynucleoside kinases sequenced so far and is also a conserved site in adenylate kinases (27Balasubramaniam N.K. Veerisetty V. Gentry G.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 2979-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 39Schulz G.E. Schiltz E. Tomasselli A.G. Frank R. Brune M. Wittinghofer A. Schirmer R.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) The corresponding third Arg residue (Arg-118) of chicken adenylate kinase has been shown to be essential for activity in chicken adenylate kinase by the site-directed mutagenesis and NMR studies of Yan et al.(40Yan H. Shi Z. Tsai M.-D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6385-6392Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Replacement of Arg-138 by methionine, or even lysine, while causing no apparent structural perturbation compared with wild-type enzyme, resulted in inactivation of the enzyme. Kinetic and structural results suggested that Arg-138 stabilizes the transition state, and to a small extent, the ground state ternary complex, thus implicating this Arg as a candidate involved in transferring the phosphoryl group. Based on refined crystallographic data, Dreusicke et al.(41Dreusicke D. Karplus P.A. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 199: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) also find that the arginines in this region of porcine adenylate kinase bind substrate phosphoryl groups. The arginines in this conserved site of Lactobacillus dGK/dAK may therefore have a similar function. The considerably higher sequence homology with mammalian dCKs, contrasted with TKs, is interesting in the light of their functional and regulatory similarities. Mammalian dCKs phosphorylate dAdo and dGuo in addition to dCyd, albeit at a common catalytic site. Also, there are similarities in the apparent mode of end product inhibition of dGK/dAK and mammalian dCKs. Whereas thymidine kinase appears to behave like a classical allosterically inhibited enzyme having cooperative kinetics and an inhibitor site(8Okazaki R. Kornberg A. J. Biol.

Ives D.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9043-9047Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The longer consensus sequence accompanying the D/ERS motifs suggests functional importance, which by analogy with TKs may somehow contribute to deoxynucleoside binding. However, it seems unlikely to be a specificity determinant, since these larger sites are nearly identical in the two subunits of dGK/dAK. The presence of a highly conserved sequence, -YDPTLEDYY- (Fig. 3, site iv) characteristic of Ras-like proteins, is certainly unexpected in the deoxynucleoside kinases. The threonine of this motif, found in the dGK but not dAK of our sequences, is critical in p21ras for the hydrolysis of GTP, and that hydrolysis is accompanied by a large conformational change affecting the entire loop. In the realm of pure speculation, it is tempting to postulate that the large one-directional effects on conformation and activity induced in the dAK subunit upon binding dGTP or dGuo might be mediated through contact with just such a site."
https://openalex.org/W2036019800,"Factor IX and factor X have sialic acid in O-linked and N-linked oligosaccharides on their activation peptides, and a terminal sialic acid is found on a recently described O-linked tetrasaccharide at Ser-61 in the light chain of human factor IXa. In studies presented here, the potential role of sialic acid residues in mediating activity of human coagulation factors IX and X was tested after enzymatic removal of sialic acid residues. In contrast to previous reports, treatment of factor IX or factor IXa with recombinant sialidase did not decrease the rate of factor IX activation or proteolytic properties of human factor IXa. The activation rates of factor IX and desialated factor IX were indistinguishable when treated with factor XIa, with factor VIIa/tissue factor complex, and with the factor X activating enzyme from Russell's viper venom. Desialated human factor IXa showed full activity in the non-activated partial thromboplastin time assay and retained full “tenase” activity in a coupled amidolytic assay. Similar experiments with human factor X showed no detectable loss of clotting activity in the prothrombin time assay after desialation. Additionally, desialated human factor X was cleaved by the factor X activating enzyme from Russell's viper venom and intrinsic tenase at the same rate as untreated factor X when analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These studies have shown that factor IX and factor X clotting activity are not dependent on sialic acid content. Further studies are needed to determine whether desialated factor IX binds to endothelial cells, and whether factors IX and X are more rapidly cleared from circulation or have altered susceptibility to proteolysis after enzymatic removal of sialic acid.

Human coagulation factor IX is a vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor which is essential for normal hemostasis(1Thompson A. Blood. 1986; 67: 565-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This glycoprotein undergoes several post-translational modifications including γ-carboxylation of 12 N-terminal glutamic acid residues, β-hydroxylation of aspartic acid at residue 64, and incorporation of both N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharides. Four sites for attachment of O-linked oligosaccharides are present in factor IX, including Ser-53 and Ser-61 within the first epidermal growth factor (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are: EGFepidermal growth factorAT-IIIantithrombin IIINAPTTnon-activated partial thromboplastin timePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPTTpartial thromboplastin timeRVV-Xfactor X activating emzyme from Russell's viper venomTBSTris-buffered salinet-PAtissue plasminogen activator. domain, which are uniformly glycosylated(2Harris R.J. van Halbeck H.

Kawabata S. Takao T. Murata H. Shimonishi Y. Nishimura H. Iwanaga S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5167-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Threonine residues at positions 159 and 169 in the activation peptide of factor IX (residues 145-180) are partially modified with O-linked oligosaccharides(3Agarwala K.L. Kawabata S. Takao T. Murata H. Shimonishi Y. Nishimura H. Iwanaga S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5167-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). There are also two sites for attachment of N-linked oligosaccharides in the activation peptide of factor IX at asparagine residues 157 and 167(4Kurachi K. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6461-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The trisaccharide linked to Ser-53 does not contain sialic acid, while the O-linked oligosaccharide at the other three sites could contain as many as 3 sialic acids. The two N-linked oligosaccharides on the activation peptide region of the molecule probably have the remainder of the 8-10 sialic acid residues found on factor IX(5DiScipio R.G. Kurachi K. Davie E.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 61: 1528-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar).

The structure of the fucose-linked tetrasaccharide with a terminal sialic acid at Ser-61 in the first EGF domain of human factor IX has been recently described(2Harris R.J. van Halbeck H. Glushka J.

(Tokyo). 1993; 114: 763-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The proposed consensus sequence (Cys-X-X-Gly-Gly-Thr/Ser-Cys) for incorporation of fucosyl modifications in EGF domains is found in human factor IX, t-PA, urokinase, factor VII, and factor XII but not in factor X or bovine factor IX(7Harris R.J. Spellman M.W. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Enzymatic removal of sialic acid has been reported to result in the loss of factor IX clotting activity without affecting the rate at which factor IX is cleaved by the factor X activating enzyme from Russell's viper venom (RVV-X)(8Chavin S.I. Weidner S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3387-3390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Loss of factor IXaα activity (a partially activated factor IX species with Arg-180/Val-181 cleavage only) following sialidase treatment suggests that sialic acids in either the EGF or activation peptide regions of factor IX are important for enzymatic activity. In contrast, factor X, which lacks the consensus site for a fucose-linked oligosaccharide in its light chain, did not lose clotting activity following enzymatic removal of sialic acid(8Chavin S.I. Weidner S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3387-3390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Others, however, have shown that sialidase treatment of human or bovine factor X (9Sinha U. Wolf D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3048-3051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and combined sialidase and O-glycanase treatment of bovine factor X reduces the Kcat/Km for RVV-X or intrinsic “tenase” (10Inoue K. Morita T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) without any apparent effect on factor Xa clotting activity. Since there are conflicting reports on the effects of enzymatic removal of sialic acid from factor X and no experiments with factor IXa, purified preparations of human factor IX, factor IXa, and factor X were each treated with either recombinant sialidase expressed in Escherichia coli or sialidase from Clostridium perfringens in the present study. Desialated factor IX, IXa, and X were found to retain full enzymatic activity in plasma and purified systems. Factor IX and factor X were purified from plasma using metal ion-dependent immunoaffinity chromatography(11Smith K.J. Blood. 1988; 72: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hamamoto T.

Recombinant C. perfringens sialidase (specific activity 140 units/mg), expressed in E. coli, was from New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA. Agarose-linked sialidase (Type X-A) from C. perfringens (150-400 units/mg of protein, 20-30 units/g of agarose), rabbit brain cephalin, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylserine were from Sigma. Human α-thrombin was prepared as described previously(13Lundblad R.L. Uhteg L.C. Vogel C.N. Kingdon H.S. Mann K.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Factor XIa was purified from celite eluant (14Link R.P. Castellino F.J.

Komiyama, Kansai Medical School, Osaka, Japan. RVV-X was purified as described previously(15Kisiel W. Hermodson M.A. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4901-4905Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Sephadex G-25 and molecular weight standards for SDS-PAGE were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin was from Boehringer Mannheim. Recombinant human factor VIIa was generously provided by Dr. Ulla Hedner (Novo Nordisk, Copenhagen, Denmark). Full-length recombinant human tissue factor apoprotein was a gift from Dr. Gordon Vehar (Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA) and was relipidated as described previously(16Broze Jr., G.J. Leykam J.E. Schwartz B.J. Miletich J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10917-10920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Centricon 30 filters were from Amicon, Danvers, MA. Heparin was from SoloPak Laboratories, Franklin Park, IL. S-2765 was from Pharmacia Hepar Inc., Franklin, OH. Factor IX-deficient plasma was from an individual with congenital deficiency of factor IX. Factor X-deficient plasma was purchased from George King Biomedical, Overland Park, KS. Recombinant tissue factor-calcium mixture (Innovin®) for prothrombin time assays was purchased from Dade (Miami, FL). Human factor IX (52 μM) was incubated with recombinant sialidase (8.62 μM) at a 8:1 weight ratio in 0.09 M sodium citrate (pH 6.0) for 4 h at 37°C. The buffer was changed to 0.1 M NaCl, 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (TBS), by gel filtration over Sephadex G-25. Desialated factor IX was repurified by immunoaffinity chromatography over an A-7 monoclonal antibody column. An identical system was used to isolate treated and control human factor X using a calcium-dependent monoclonal antibody (CaFX40) coupled to Affi-Gel 10. To control for potential degradation of factor IX activity that may have occurred after extended incubation and re-isolation, factor IX and factor X were subjected to the same incubation and re-isolation steps without recombinant sialidase. In these experiments, agarose-immobilized sialidase was incubated with factor IXa in TBS, at a ratio of 0.2 units of sialidase (23 pmol)/mg of factor IXa (17 nmol) for up to 8 h at 37°C. Aliquots were removed for sialic acid analysis and SDS-PAGE at 0, 0.33, 0.66, 1, 2.25, and 8 h of incubation and centrifuged to remove sialidase. Control preparations of factor IXa were incubated without sialidase and treated in an identical manner. Samples of various proteins for sialic acid analysis were initially dialyzed in 0.1 M NH4HCO3, lyophilized, and subsequently hydrolyzed with 0.1 M trifluoroacetic acid at 80°C for 1 h. For amino acid analysis, the proteins were treated for 24 h at 110°C in 6 N HCl invacuo. Sialic acid content was determined on high pH anion exchange chromatography on a Dionex BioLC apparatus(3Agarwala K.L. Kawabata S. Takao T. Murata H. Shimonishi Y. Nishimura H. Iwanaga S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5167-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), while protein mass was determined using a Beckman 6300 amino acid analyzer. Nanomoles of protein were determined by comparison to a standard using the average of the observed amounts (nmol) of Asx, Ala, Leu, Phe, His, Lys, and Arg. Factor IX and desialated factor IX were incubated at 37°C with purified human factor XIa in TBS with 10 mM CaCl2 at a 1:300 enzyme:substrate weight ratio. The concentration of factor IX was 3.23 μM, and that of factor XIa was 3.8 nM. Aliquots (50 μl) were removed from the reaction mixture at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 h and adjusted to 20 mM EDTA to stop the reaction prior to assessing clotting activity and SDS-PAGE analysis. Factor IX and desialated factor IX (17.54 μM) were incubated at 37°C with a complex of recombinant human factor VIIa (34 nM) and relipidated recombinant human tissue factor apoprotein (34 nM) at a 1:588 enzyme:substrate weight ratio in TBS with 10 mM CaCl2. Samples were removed at 0, 0.5, 1, 5, and 30 min and adjusted to 0.03 M EDTA prior to clotting assay and SDS-PAGE. Soluble RVV-X (362 nM) was incubated at 37°C with either factor IX or desialated factor IX (25.4 μM) in TBS, pH 8.0, with 10 mM CaCl2 at a 1:50 enzyme:substrate weight ratio in presence of 1 mM benzamidine. Aliquots (50 μl) were taken at 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 h and adjusted to 30 mM EDTA prior to SDS-PAGE and coagulation assays. Control human factor X and desialated human factor X (18.64 μM) were incubated with soluble RVV-X (45.75 nM) at a 1:300 enzyme:substrate weight ratio at 37°C in TBS with 10 mM CaCl2. Aliquots were removed at 0, 5, 15, and 30 min. and adjusted to 30 mM EDTA prior to SDS-PAGE and coagulation assays. Control human factor X and desialated human factor X (16.14 μM) were incubated with 55.6 nM factor IXa, 93 μM phospholipid vesicles (30/70, phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylcholine) (17Barenholz Y. Gibbes D. Litman B.J. Goll J. Thompson T.E. Carlson F.D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2806-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar) 0.007 NIH units/ml thrombin, 15 nM factor VIIIa at 37°C in TBS, pH 8.0, with 10 mM CaCl2 (1:300 enzyme:substrate weight ratio). Aliquots were removed at 0, 1, 5, 15, and 30 min and adjusted to 30 mM EDTA prior to SDS-PAGE analysis. Factor IX clotting activity was assessed using a single stage PTT system (8Chavin S.I. Weidner S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3387-3390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) after dilution of factor IX or factor IXa in TBS containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. This assay was modified to detect factor IXa activity when the ellagic acid/cephalin mixture was replaced with rabbit brain cephalin diluted 1:10 in TBS. The clotting time was recorded after sequential addition of 0.1 ml of factor IX-deficient plasma, 0.1 ml of diluted factor IX or factor IXa, 0.1 ml of diluted cephalin, and 0.1 ml of 25 mM CaCl2. Formation of the factor IXa-AT-III complex was tested with both proteins at 0.19 mg/ml in TBS with 1 units/ml heparin. After 1 min at 37°C, samples were prepared for SDS-PAGE analysis without β-mercaptoethanol. Activity of sialidase-treated factor X and control factor X was determined in an prothrombin time system using congenital factor X-deficient plasma as substrate. The clotting time was recorded after the sequential addition of 50 μl of factor X-deficient plasma, 50 μl of diluted factor X (desialated and control), and 200 μl of Innovin. The activity of the complex of factor IXa, factor VIIIa, phospholipid, and calcium was monitored by conversion of factor X to factor Xa in a purified system. Factor IXa and desialated factor IXa (0.1-1.0 nM final concentration) were added to a solution consisting of 300 nM factor X, 15 nM factor VIIIa, 0.007 NIH units/ml thrombin, 93 μM phospholipid vesicles (30/70, phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylcholine)(17Barenholz Y. Gibbes D. Litman B.J. Goll J. Thompson T.E. Carlson F.D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2806-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar), in 0.15 M NaCl, 0.02 M HEPES, 5 mM CaCl2 (pH 7.2) with 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The reaction mixture (150 μl) was incubated at 37°C for 5 min prior to stopping the reaction by addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 15 mM and placing the sample on ice. The amount of factor Xa generated was determined using the chromogenic substrate S-2765 from a standard curve relating factor Xa and A7 in this system. Aliquots (10 μl) of the reaction mixture were transferred to 40 μl of 5 μM S-2765 in 9 mM HEPES (pH 7.2). The reaction was incubated at 37°C for 5 min, and the reaction was then stopped by the addition of 0.05 ml of 30% acetic acid. Absorbance was read at 405 nm in microtiter tray wells. The sialic acid content of factor IX (mol/mol) was 9.1 (range 8.7-9.4) in four experiments, while factor IXa averaged 8.0 (range 6.7-10.20) in five experiments. In contrast, the factor IX and IXa preparations treated with sialidase had a sialic acid content of less than 1 mol of residual sialic acid/mol of factor IX or factor IXa. In initial experiments, factor IXa was dialyzed in 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 5.5), which is close to the pH optimum for sialidase isolated from C. perfringens. When factor IXa was concentrated by centrifugation over an Centricon 30 filter in this buffer, it was found that there was a visible precipitate. This problem was not observed when the higher pH levels (pH 6) were used for enzymatic removal of factor IX sialic acid. IEF analysis of sialidase-treated factor IX preparations showed loss of the heterogeneity associated with variable sialic acid content (data not shown). Fig. 1 shows the SDS-PAGE analysis of factor IX treated with recombinant C. perfringens sialidase. There is an apparent loss of ~4000 daltons when 97% of the sialic acid had been removed. The PTT assay on factor IX re-isolated after recombinant sialidase treatment yielded a mean specific activity of 356 units/mg (n = 3, range 326-367), while the re-isolated control factor IX specific activity was 237 units/mg (n = 4, range 180-280). The mean difference between specific activity assays of treated and untreated factor IX was 126 units/mg (95% confidence interval of 55-198 units/mg). The p value for the two sample t test was p = 0.006. Experiments with factor IX treated with sialidase isolated from C. perfringens revealed that the factor IX specific activity also appeared to increase after treatment as assessed in the PTT assay. This change in specific activity was probably due to activation since the non-activated PTT showed that there was factor IXa activity after incubation (non-activated PTT of 100 s at 40 ng/ml desialated factor IX and 190 s of the untreated factor IX preparation at the same concentration). Although the specific activity in the clotting assay increased after incubation with recombinant sialidase, less activation of factor IX was observed in the non-activated PTT. The NAPTT assay could detect as little as 9 pM of factor IXa in these experiments. As can be seen in Fig. 1, there was no apparent activation of factor IX on SDS-PAGE when purified factor IX was treated with recombinant sialidase. However, some preparations of factor IX treated with C. perfringens-derived sialidase had several lower molecular weight bands when analyzed by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Factor IX preparations after desialation were assayed for factor IXa in the factor X activation assay. After treatment by C. perfringens-derived sialidase, factor IX samples assayed at 10 nM contained 0.5 nM factor IXa. There was no detectable factor IXa after treatment with recombinant sialidase. The limit of detection was 0.1-0.2 nM. Although preservation of clotting activity in the PTT assay depends on factor XIa-mediated activation of factor IX, the ability of factor IX to be activated in three systems was tested. In these experiments, factor IX and desialated factor IX could be activated by factor XIa in a fashion identical to that seen with untreated factor IX as judged by activation-like cleavages on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). In other experiments, factor IX and desialated factor IX were activated at the same rate by RVV-X (Fig. 3) and by the complex of tissue factor/VIIa (Fig. 4).Figure 3:Activation of factor IX and desialated factor IX by RVV-X.

Inset, each lane contains 7-8 μg of protein. Samples are not reduced. Lanes 1-5 contain control factor IX, and lanes 6-10 contain desialated factor IX. Incubation times of factor IX samples are as follows; lanes 5 and 6 are at 0 min, lanes4 and 7 are at 0.5 min, lanes3 and 8 are at 1 min; lanes2 and 9 are at 5 min; lanes1 and 10 are at 30 min. The factor IX cleavage site that gives a band at the apparent kDa of 55 is not known. Graph shows factor IX clotting activity; the + symbol is control factor IX activity in the NAPTT assay, and the ▵ symbol is desialated factor IX activity in the same assay. Samples were diluted 1:10,000 prior to assay after activation by tissue factor and factor VIIa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Although factor X activity measured in the PTT depends on expression of factor IXa activity in activating factor X and thus would be thought to be normal on the basis of the preservation of activity in the PTT, formal experiments were performed to demonstrate the retention of factor IXa enzymatic activity with progressive loss of sialic acid. As can be seen in Fig. 5(A and B), there was no change in the factor IXa clotting activity or factor IXa tenase activity in 135 min, despite the rapid desialation. Rapid desialation of factor IXa with preservation of factor IXa activity was shown in two separate experiments using immobilized sialidase. In addition, no more than 5-10% degradation of factor IXa occurred after extensive incubation with sialidase as judged by SDS-PAGE. Furthermore, desialated factor IXa reacted with antithrombin III with the same efficiency of control factor IXa preparations (Fig. 6).Figure 6:Binding of antithrombin III with factor IXa and desialated factor IXa. Each lane contains 7-8 μg of protein. Samples were not reduced. Lanes1 and 7 are molecular weight markers; lane2 is AT-III; lane3 is control factor IXa-AT-III complex; lane4 is control factor IXa; lane5 is desialated factor IXa; lane6 is AT-III-desialated factor IXa complex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Two experiments tested the coagulation activity of factor X treated with recombinant sialidase sufficient to reduce the sialic acid content to 19% and 29% of initial levels. After desialation there was no detectable loss of factor X clotting activity in the PTT assay. Desialated factor X could hydrolyze a small peptide substrate (S-2765) after activation similar to results seen with the control preparation. As seen with factor IX, the specific activity of factor X increased after sialidase treatment probably reflecting minor activation with extended incubation (data not shown). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 7, desialated and control preparations of human factor X were cleaved at an indistinguishable rate by soluble RVV-X. Rates of activation of both desialated and control preparations of human factor X were also similar when activated by the intrinsic pathway (complex of factor IXa, factor VIIIa, phospholipid vesicles, and CaCl2) as shown in Fig. 8.Figure 8:Activation of factor X and desialated factor X by factor IXa/factor VIIIa/phospholipid vesicles/CaCl2. Each lane contains 7-8 μg of protein. Samples were not reduced. Lanes1-5 contain desialated factor X, and lanes6-10 contain control factor X. Incubation time of factor X samples are as follows; lanes1 and 10 are at 30 min, lanes2 and 9 are at 15 min, lanes3 and 8 are at 5 min, lanes4 and 7 are at 1 min, and lanes5 and 6 are at 0 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These experiments have shown that enzymatic removal of sialic acid from human factor IX did not affect its activation or its proteolytic activity against factor X. Additionally, treatment of factor X with recombinant C. perfringens sialidase did not affect activation of factor X or its enzymatic activity. The specific activity of desialated factor IX was preserved in the PTT assay, which depends on activation of the proenzyme and its ability to activate factor X in the presence of cofactors. High values of specific activity were probably due to minor activation of the factor IX samples after incubation with sialidase. By SDS-PAGE analysis, factor XIa, the complex of factor VIIa and tissue factor, and RVV-X cleaved desialated factor IX and native factor IX at the same rate. Desialated factor IXa retained full activity on the NAPTT assay and tenase activity measured in a coupled amidolytic assay. Experiments with human factor X showed no detectable loss of clotting activity of desialated factor X in the PT assay, reflecting both activation and enzymatic activity. Factor X and desialated factor X were cleaved by RVV-X, and by the complex of factor IXa, factor VIIIa, phospholipid vesicles, and CaCl2 at the same rate when analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Additionally, desialated factor Xa hydrolyzed a small peptide substrate (S-2765) at the same rate as control factor Xa. Others have reported decreased enzymatic activity of partially activated human factor IX and either no effect on human factor X activity or slowed activation of the proenzyme after treatment with commercial sialidase(8Chavin S.I.

Chavin and Weidner (8Chavin S.I. Weidner S.M. J. Biol.

In experiments with human factor X, Chavin and Weidner demonstrated that even 6 h of treatment of human factor X with sialidase did not change PTT activity despite removal of 54% of its sialic acid(8Chavin S.I. Weidner S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3387-3390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two reports, however, have demonstrated slow activation of factor X after removal of sialic acid(9Sinha U. Wolf D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3048-3051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Inoue K. Morita T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Sinha and Wolf (9Sinha U. Wolf D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3048-3051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that both bovine and human factor X were slowly activated by either intrinsic tenase or by the tissue factor-VIIa complex after short treatment (3-4 h) with Vibrio cholerae sialidase. The clotting activity of the desialated factor X was 2-12% of the untreated factor X in PT or PTT assays. Similar results were obtained using a chromogenic substrate to measure factor Xa generation. Activation of both human and bovine factor X was less affected after N-glycosidase treatment but residual sialic acid was not measured after treatment with either sialidase or N-glycosidase. Inoue and Morita (10Inoue K. Morita T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) also showed that the rate of activation of bovine factor X was decreased after treatment with Arthrobacter ureafaciens sialidase and O-glycanase from Streptococcus pneumoniae, but not after removal of N-linked carbohydrate. Sialidase alone was not used in these experiments, and residual sialic acid was not quantitated in this report. The activation peptide regions of human and bovine factor X contain different numbers of sites for N- and O-linked oligosaccharides, so that results with bovine factor X may not predict results with human factor X. Preservation of clotting activity after sialidase treatment may be explained by differences in experimental approach. Use of recombinant sialidase instead of sialidase from bacterial lysates may have minimized proteolytic degradation of clotting factor preparations in the current report. In most experiments, sialidase-treated and control factor IX and X were reisolated using monoclonal antibody immunoaffinity chromatography prior to studies of enzymatic activity, further minimizing chances for protein degradation by trace amounts of proteolytic enzymes in the sialidase preparations. Although sialic acid residues are concentrated in the activation peptide regions, they do not appear to be critical for activation of factors IX and X and their function remains speculative. The one sialic acid residue on the light chain of factor IXa is found in factor IX's EGF1 domain on an O-linked tetrasaccharide at Ser-61. This tetrasaccharide is not found on bovine factor IX or human factor X. Desialated factor IXa has full clotting activity in agreement with other observations, suggesting that the sialic acid on the EGF1 domain of factor IX is not essential for factor IXa interaction with its cofactor. Hybrid factor IX containing factor X EGF1 in place of the factor IX EGF1 domain lacks the fucosyl modification consensus sequence (hence it must lack the Ser-61 tetrasaccharide), yet retains full clotting activity(18Lin S.-W. Smith K.J. Welsch D. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 144-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since no hemophilia B mutations have been found at Ser-61 or another site for glycosylation, Ser-53, the codons for these residues may either be relatively stable to mutations, or perhaps missense mutations affecting sites for O-linked oligosaccharide attachment within EGF1 do not affect clotting activity and are not detected(19Gianelli F. Green P.M. High K.A. Sommer S. Poon M.-C. Ludwig M. Schwaab R. Reitsma P.H. Goosens M. Yoshioka A. Brownlee G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3075-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The O-linked oligosaccharides within the EGF1 domain may have a role in receptor-ligand interaction(20Nishimura H. Takao T. Hase S. Shimonishi Y. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17520-17525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). O-Linked oligosaccharides are important for C type lectin interaction in the binding of t-PA to HepG2 cells since this calcium-dependent reaction is not seen with α-fucosidase treated t-PA(21Hajjar K.A. Reynolds C.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). O-Linked oligosaccharides are also important in other receptor-ligand interactions such as binding of transferrin and its receptor(22Do S.-I. Enns C. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 114-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although sialic acids are not required for coagulant activity of factor IX and X in vitro, they may be important for survival of factor IX and X in circulation or for binding to cellular surfaces. Clearance of ceruloplasmin has been shown to be accelerated after treatment with sialidase for example(23Morell A.G. Irvine R.A. Sternlieb I. Scheinberg I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 155-162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies are in progress to see if sialic acids are involved in factor IX binding to endothelial cells.

Development of small molecular mimics of larger, polypeptide ligands is one approach to pharmacophore design. Several strategies are available for the development of such mimics, including the use of small oligopeptide analogs derived from native sequence(1Miele L. Cordella-Miele E. Facchiano A.

Alternative ligands that bind to the same site as the native ligand provide the opportunity to investigate structural and chemical constraints for binding in the setting of diverse backbone geometries.

The advantages of recombinant approaches to antibody development include the ability to rapidly screen thousands of clones simultaneously, the potential to detect binding moities poorly represented in the initial repertoire, and the potential to express isolated variable regions. While intact mAbs contain both light and heavy chain variable regions (VL and VH, respectively), recombinant antibodies can be developed which express both VL and VH, or VL or VH alone. This limits the potential interaction sites of the recombinant antibody, allowing more precise delineation of critical interaction regions. Here we describe the development of a recombinant light chain library in Escherichia coli derived from mice immunized with polyclonal anti-GM-CSF. This library was screened with a previously described neutralizing anti-GM-CSF mAb 126.213 (24Brown C.B. Hart C.E. Curtis D.M. Bailey M.C. Kaushansky K. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2184-2189PubMed Google Scholar) which inhibits GM-CSF binding to HL-60 cells, neutralizes GM-CSF induced colony formation, and competes with the α chain of the GM-CSF receptor for GM-CSF binding(25Williams W.V. VonFeldt J.M. Rosenbaum H. Ugen K.E. Weiner D.B. Arthritis Rheum. 1994; 37: 1468-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Screening with radioiodinated 126.213 yielded several binding clones, including one that inhibited immunoprecipitation of GM-CSF by 126.213. Comparison of the recombinant VL sequence with the human GM-CSF sequence revealed only weak similarity with GM-CSF, but structural analysis suggested mimicry of residues on the B and C helices of GM-CSF by a site chiefly made up of the CDR I region of 23.2. A synthetic peptide corresponding to the CDR I was bound by the neutralizing anti-GM-CSF mAb and specifically inhibited GM-CSF binding and the growth of GM-CSF-dependent cells. These studies suggest a structural basis for recombinant antibody mimicry of a predominately helical molecule (human GM-CSF), demonstrate a bioactive peptide analog of a GM-CSF site implicated in receptor binding, and indicate the feasibility of using recombinant antibody libraries as sources of interaction site analogs. E. coli DH5α competent cells (Life Technologies, Inc.) were used for transformation. Bacteria were grown in Luria broth containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin (LB/amp)(26Ausubel, F., Brent, R., Kingston, R., Moore, D., Seidman, J., Smith, J., Struhl, K., (eds) (1989) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, New York.Google Scholar, 27Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Solid media contained 1.5% agar (Difco Inc.). Restriction endonucleases and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Enzyme reaction conditions were according to those of the supplier. Oligonucleotides for PCR primers and for Southern blotting were synthesized by the DNA Synthesis Facility of the Wistar Institute. The primers were selected by analysis of immunoglobulin sequences as published by Kabat et al.(28Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Foeller C. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, MD1991Google Scholar). The specific primers are listed in Table 1. PCR amplification employed primers 3315 (relatively specific for the murine Vκ III family) and 5591 (near the 3′ end of the Cκ coding region). Note that primer 5591 introduces a stop codon at codon 207, resulting in a truncated light chain lacking the carboxyl-terminal 8 amino acids including the cysteine at position 214. This should result in production of light chains which are predicted to remain monomers. Primers were tested on various hybridoma cell lines in the laboratory prior to their use in library construction. In these studies amplified sequences were isolated from the gels cloned and sequenced to verify the utility of the primers and their specificity for amplification of Ig variable regions (data not shown).Tabled 1 CTLL cells and the proliferation assay in response to IL-2 or rat spleen concanavalin A was described previously(29Borofsky M.A. Weiner D.B. Zurier R.B. Williams W.V. Immunol. Res. 1992; 11: 154-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). AML 193 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), and MO7E cells were from R. Zollner, Genetics Institute (Cambridge MA). AML 193 was grown serum free in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with insulin (10 μg/ml), transferrin (5-10 units/ml), 1% OPI media additive (oxalate, pyruvate, and insulin), and GM-CSF (0.5 ng/ml). MO7E was grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, Pen/strep, L-glutamine, and GM-CSF 0.5 ng/ml. For proliferation assays, 2 × 104 AML 193 or MO7E cells were cultured per well in 96-well round bottomed plates in the above medium along with test antisera in a final volume of 200 μl. Following a 3-5 day incubation, tritiated thymidine (1 μCi/well) was added for an additional 18 h, the cells harvested onto glass fiber filters utilizing a PhD cell harvester, and counts/minute incorporated determined in a standard liquid scintillation system. Recombinant human GM-CSF (obtained from Bachem Biosciences, Philadelphia, PA) was used to immunize BALB/c mice as described previously(30Romano C. Williams W.V. Fischberg D.J. Cocero N. Weiner D.B. Greene M.I. Molinoff P.B. J. Neurochem. 1989; 53: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Serum was obtained 1 week following each boost with antigen. Antisera from three to five animals were pooled for the assays performed. Following the third boost, significant neutralizing titers against human GM-CSF-dependent cellular proliferation were demonstrated (Fig. 1). The mice were bled after five boosts and IgG purified from serum by affinity chromatography with Sepharose-protein A. This was used to immunize syngeneic BALB/c mice (50 μg of purified IgG/immunization) and serum obtained following each boost. The sera were assayed for inhibition of GM-CSF-dependent proliferation (see below), and significant (>50%) inhibition was seen following the eighth boost against both MO7E and AML193 cells (Fig. 1 and data not shown). Mice that exhibited neutralizing activity on this assay served as spleen cell donors. Spleenocytes were isolated from four anti-GM-CSF immunized mice who displayed neutralizing activity against GM-CSF-dependent proliferation. A cell suspension was prepared and lymphocytes isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation. RNA was extracted with the RNAzol kit (Biotecx Laboratories Inc., Houston, TX), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following isolation, the RNA was precipitated with isopropyl alcohol, pellets washed in 70% ethanol, and rotary evaporated. The dried pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of diethylpyrocarbonate-water and RNA quantified spectrophotometrically. For reverse transcription, 10-20 μg of RNA in 10 μl was utilized to synthesize cDNA primed with random hexamers in the following reaction mixture: 3 μl of Maloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase with 6 μl of 5 × reverse transcriptase buffer, 1.5 μl of RNase inhibitor, and 3 μl of 0.1 M dithiothreitol (all from Life Technologies, Inc.), 3 μl (100 pmol) of random hexamers (from Pharmacia LKB Biotechnol), and 1 μl of 40 mM dNTPs (10 mM in each dNTP, from Boehringer Mannheim, GmbH W., Germany). Following a 10-min preincubation at 25°C, the reaction was carried out for 1 h at 42°C, then 95°C for 5 min followed by storage at −20°C until use. For PCR amplification, the oligonucleotide primers 3315 and 5591 listed in Table 1 were employed at 0.5 nM/ml final concentrations. The relative position of these primers on Igκ cDNA is shown in Fig. 2. The PCR mixture (100 μl) consisted of 10 μl of PCR primers, 16 μl of dNTPs (final concentration 200 μM in each dNTP), 10 μl of PCR buffer (10 ×; Perkin-Elmer Cetus), 61.5 μl of dH2O, 2 μl cDNA, and 1.2 units of Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Cetus). Amplification was carried out in a Programmable Thermal Cycler (MJ Research, Watertown, MA). The amplification program was 94°C for 3 min followed by five cycles of 94°C for 60 s, 52°C for 60 s, 72°C for 60 s; followed by 25 cycles of 94°C for 60 s, 52°C for 90 s, and 72°C for 120 s. Following 30 cycles, the temperature was held at 72°C for 7 min. Positive amplification was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis. The PCR products were cloned into the pDABL plasmid, which is of utility for protein expression as has been published previously (31McCallus D.E. Ugen K.E. Sato A.I. Williams W.V. Weiner D.B. Viral Immunol. 1992; 5: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 32Williams W.V. McCallus D.E. Satre M. Eldridge D. Frank I. O'Donnell E.A. Weiner D.B. Transgene. 1993; 1: 113-124Google Scholar). PCR products and plasmid DNA were cut with the appropriate endonucleases and plasmid DNA was treated with calf intestinal phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim), followed by ligation using 1 unit of T4 DNA ligase overnight at 16°C. Ligation mixtures were transformed into E. coli DH5α competent cells as described by the manufacturer. Competent Epicurian coli cells (the Cell Center, University of Pennsylvania) transformed with the amplified Vκ/pDABL library was plated on LB/amp plates. Control ligated pDABL vector produced four to five colonies/plate, while the appropriately ligated Vκ/pDABL transformants produced 175-465 colonies/plate. Inserts were confirmed by plasmid miniprep analysis(26Ausubel, F., Brent, R., Kingston, R., Moore, D., Seidman, J., Smith, J., Struhl, K., (eds) (1989) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, New York.Google Scholar, 27Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), which revealed appropriately sized inserts in 75% of colonies. Approximately 2,000 colonies on 10 plates were screened in this study. Bacterial clones possessing the Vκ genes inserted into pDABL were plated onto LB/amp plates. Control plates contained E. coli transformed with either pDABL alone, pUC19, or pUC18. Following overnight growth, replica plating, and additional overnight growth, 0.45-m nitrocellulose filters were placed on the bacterial plate. Filters were lifted to other LB/amp plates on which 50 μl of isopropyl-β-thio-galactopyranoside (IPTG) (25 mg/ml; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) had been spread and were then incubated for 4 h at 37°C. ilters were then exposed to chloroform vapor for 15 min and incubated overnight (with shaking) in lysis buffer (100 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.8,150 mM NaCl,5 mM MgCl2,1.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA),1 μg/ml pancreatic DNase I, and 40 μg/ml lysozyme). Filters were then blocked for 4 h with blocking buffer (5% non-fat dry milk and 0.05% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4; pH .4)). Following blocking, filters were screened for specific variable region expression as noted below. For some experiments, lysates were prepared of bacteria expressing the recombinant antibody fragments. Lysates of E. coli XL1 Blue cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were prepared either from unmanipulated bacteria or E. coli transformed with pDABL alone, or the various VL regions ligated into pDABL. Colonies were grown overnight in LB/Amp, and 500 μl used to seed 5-l cultures grown to ~0.6 A450 units in Superbroth (Cell Center, University of Pennsylvania), then induced with 1 mM IPTG for for 4-12 h. The cells were centrifuged (10,000 revolutions/min for 30 min) and the pellets dissolved in 2 ml of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and aprotinin diluted 1:100 from a concentration of 2.1 mg/ml, all from Sigma). These cells were sonicated for 45 s on ice and clarified by centrifugation (11,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C) and the supernatant (lysate) used as sources of VL fragments. For binding of 125I-labeled 126.213 or control mAb ID6 (33Ugen K.E. Refaeli Y. Ziegner U. Agadjanyan M. Satre M.A. Srikatan V. Wang B. Sato A. Williams W.V. Weiner D.B. Vaccines. 1993; 1993: 215-221Google Scholar) blocked filters were incubated for 2 h at 37°C with 125I-labeled mAb (purified by staphylococcal protein A affinity chromatography), 500,000-1,000,000 cpm/ml, labeled by the chloramine T method (9Williams W.

Filters were washed extensively with PBS-BSA and autoradiographed (Kodak XRP film) for 2-24 h. Double-stranded DNA sequencing employed the primers listed in Table 1 and followed previously published protocols (34Wang B. Fang Q. Williams W. Weiner D.B. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 527-530PubMed Google Scholar). Sequencing proceeded in both the 5′ and 3′ orientations to confirm all sequence information. Bacterial lystaes (prepared as above) or recombinant human GM-CSF were run on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel in reducing sample buffer (2% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 0.001% bromphenol blue) with 500 μg of bacterial protein (as determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay) loaded in each well. Following electrophoresis, the gel was transferred to Immobilon P transfer membranes (Millipore) as described(35Weiner D. Kokai Y. Wada T. Cohen J. Williams W. Greene M. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 1175-1183PubMed Google Scholar), and the blot blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin, 5% non-fat dry milk, 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS (blocking buffer) for >1 h at 37°C or overnight at 4°C. The blots were then incubated with 5 ml of purified mAb 126.213 diluted to 2 μg/ml in blocking buffer for 2 h at 37°C, and washed four times in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 (wash buffer). Polyclonal goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) (radioiodinated as described(9Williams W. Guy H. Rubin D. Robey F. Myers J. Kieber-Emmons T. Weiner D. Greene M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The tubes were centrifuged and the liquid aspirated. The beads were then washed three time with lysis buffer (1% Triton, 0.05% SDS, 10 mM Na2HPO4-NaH2PO4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 100 μM Na3VO4, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin all from Sigma) to remove unbound antibody. The beads were resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer, and 125I-GM-CSF was added to the tubes in the presence or absence of inhibitors (100 μl of total volume) and rotated at 4°C for 1 h. The tubes were then centrifuged, the liquid discarded, and the beads washed three times. The beads were then resuspended in 2 × sample buffer (0.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 16% glycerol, 3.2% SDS, 8% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.04% bromphenol blue (all from Sigma) in distilled H20) and heated at 95°C for 5 min to dissociate bonds. Samples were then loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and analyzed by autoradiography as described(35Weiner D. Kokai Y. Wada T. Cohen J. Williams W. Greene M.

Briefly, HL-60 cells (from ATCC) were grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum and added L-glutamine. 1-2 × 106 HL-60 cells were washed twice in RPMI 1640 with 1% BSA and 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 (binding buffer), centrifuged, and incubated with inhibitors as noted in figure legends in a 25-μl volume for 1 h at room temperature. 0.5 nM of 125I-GM-CSF (118 μCi/μg, from DuPont NEN) was then added for 30 min at room temperature, the cells layered over 500 μl of chilled fetal calf serum, centrifuged, and the pellets counted. All peptides were synthesized by solid-phase methods as described previously (9Williams W. Guy H. Rubin D. Robey F. Myers J. Kieber-Emmons T. Weiner D. Greene M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

ELISA was performed with polystyrene plates (Dynatech Laboratories Inc.) coated with peptide by evaporation of peptides (at the concentrations noted) in distilled water overnight at 37°C. The wells were washed with PBS, blocked with 0.05% Tween, 2% BSA in PBS, and washed with PBS. Primary antibodies were added at varying dilutions for >1 h at 37°C. After washing, secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) was added per well in 1% BSA in PBS for 1-2 h at 37°C. The substrate used for color development was 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl-benzidine dihydrochloride (Sigma). The wells were decanted, washed extensively, and absorbance of samples was measured in a plate reader (MR 5000; Dynatech Laboratories) and expressed as A450 nm. Specific values were determined by subtracting the absorbance measured from uncoated wells from the absorbance to peptide coated wells(39Ugen K.E. Goedert J.J. Boyer J. Refaeli Y. Frank I.

Polyclonal neutralizing antibodies against human GM-CSF raised in BALB/c mice were used to develop syngeneic anti-anti-GM-CSF with neutralizing activity (Fig. 1). The PCR was used to amplify immunoglobulin Vκ genes from these mice. Oligonucleotide primers for amplification of immunoglobulin genes were chosen based on conserved DNA sequences found in VL variable framework regions and from the κ constant region domain. The 5′ primer used in these experiments was relatively specific for the murine VκIII family. The 3′ primer introduced a stop codon at position 207, eliminating 8 amino acids including the carboxyl-terminal cysteine residue, thereby eliminating the tendency for the produced light chains to dimerize. Spleen cells were isolated, RNA extracted, and cDNA synthesized. This served as a template for PCR amplification of the VLCk regi"

The enzyme requires magnesium for catalysis; however, equilibrium binding assays revealed that the enzyme binds specifically to DNA in the absence of magnesium. A specific association constant of 0.9 × 108M-1 was determined for SmaI binding to a 22-base duplex oligonucleotide. Furthermore, the KA was a function of the length of the DNA substrate and the enzyme exhibited an affinity of 1.2 × 109M-1 for a 195-base pair fragment and which represented a 104-fold increase in affinity over binding to nonspecific sequences. A Km of 17.5 nM was estimated from kinetic assays based on cleavage of the 22-base oligonucleotide and is not significantly different from the KD estimated from the thermodynamic analyses. Footprinting (dimethyl sulfate and missing nucleoside) analyses revealed that SmaI interacts with each of the base pairs within the recognition sequence. Ethylation interference assays suggested that the protein contacts three adjacent phosphates on each strand of the recognition sequence.

The molecular mechanisms of sequence-specific recognition by DNA binding proteins is a complex phenomena of which the details are still emerging. In recent years, resolution of the structures of a number of DNA-binding proteins and of protein•DNA cocomplexes has provided insight into the variety of structures of the DNA-binding domains, the network of bonding between the macromolecules, and also the significance of both protein and DNA conformational changes in the specific recognition process(1Steitz T.A.

The endonucleases of the bacterial type II restriction-modification systems provide excellent models by which to study mechanisms of sequence specificity of DNA-binding proteins(5Aiken C.R. Fisher E.W. Gumport R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19063-19069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Anderson J. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Two of the endonucleases, EcoRI and EcoRV, have been extensively studied by both biochemical and x-ray crystal structural analyses and have revealed distinct mechanisms by which they achieve their high degree of sequence specificity: the cleavage selectivity of EcoRI is derived from both binding and catalytic specificity (8Heitman J. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 9Rosenberg J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 104-113Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar) whereas the EcoRV endonuclease exhibits the same intrinsic affinity for all DNA sequences but achieves catalytic specificity in the presence of magnesium(10Winkler F. Banner D.W. Oefner C. Tsernoglou D. Brown R.S. Heathman S.P. Bryan R.K. Martin P.D. Petraros K.K. Wilson K.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1781-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 11Thielking V.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6082-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The crystal structures also revealed that the enzymes utilize novel protein structures for DNA recognition and that there are significant differences in the topology of the respective protein•DNA complexes. In the EcoRI•DNA complex, the protein approaches the DNA predominantly from the major groove and makes specific interactions in the major groove with each of the purines and pyrimidines of the recognition site. In contrast, the EcoRV endonuclease approaches the DNA predominantly from the minor groove although the sequence specific contacts are made in the major groove. Protein-induced unwinding and bending of the DNA, including unstacking of the central base pairs, are features that characterize both endonucleases. However, whereas the net effect in the EcoRI•DNA complex is widening of the major groove(9Rosenberg J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 104-113Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar), the DNA in the EcoRV•DNA complex is reminiscent of A-form DNA with a more narrow and deeper major groove(10Winkler F. Banner D.W. Oefner C. Tsernoglou D. Brown R.S. Heathman S.P. Bryan R.K. Martin P.D. Petraros K.K. Wilson K.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1781-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the overall kink and curvature appears to preclude the formation of hydrogen bonds between EcoRV and the central base pairs of the recognition sequence such that direct interactions only occur at the outer 2 base pairs of each half site of the recognition palindrome (10Winkler F. Banner D.W. Oefner C. Tsernoglou D. Brown R.S. Heathman S.P. Bryan R.K. Martin P.D. Petraros K.K. Wilson K.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1781-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The general lack of sequence similarity between the type II endonucleases (13Wilson G.G. Murray N.E. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 585-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) has restricted the use of sequence comparisons to probe the structure-function relationship of these enzymes. Furthermore, detailed biochemical and structural analyses of endonucleases has in the past been limited. Nonetheless, recent reports suggest that EcoRI and EcoRV may be paradigms for other endonucleases. 1) It has now been shown (14Zebala J.A. Choi J. Trainor G.L. Barany F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8106-8116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that TaqI is similar to EcoRV in that it achieves specificity only in the presence of magnesium. 2) The recent determination of the structure of the BamHI endonuclease (15Newman M. Strzelecka T. Dorner L. Schildkraut I. Aggarwal A. Nature. 1994; 368: 660-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) has revealed an overall conformation very similar to that of EcoRI. The structural similarity occurs in the absence of any obvious sequence similarity between these enzymes. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the structure of the “common core motif” which, in EcoRI and BamHI, provides an ideal scaffold for positioning the active sites of the enzyme near the scissile bond, may also be conserved in other enzymes that similarly cleave their hexanucleotide recognition sequences to yield a 5′, 4 bp 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s)DMSdimethyl sulfate. stagger (15Newman M. Strzelecka T. Dorner L. Schildkraut I. Aggarwal A. Nature. 1994; 368: 660-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). 3) Similarities have been detected in the architecture of the active site of all four endonucleases (EcoRI(9Rosenberg J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 104-113Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar), EcoRV(10Winkler F. Banner D.W. Oefner C. Tsernoglou D. Brown R.S. Heathman S.P. Bryan R.K. Martin P.D. Petraros K.K.

Analyses of additional endonucleases should therefore enable potential trends to be discerned in the mechanism of recognition by these DNA-binding proteins. Furthermore, the existence of endonuclease isoschizomers makes it possible to analyze and compare the mechanism by which different enzymes interact with the same DNA sequence and how the requirements for recognition and catalysis are satisfied. We have initiated a comparative study of the SmaI and XmaI endonucleases. The enzymes recognize the sequence CCCGGG but cleave at different positions within the sequence such that SmaI cleaves at the internal CpG to yield a blunt-end scission whereas XmaI cleaves between the external cytosines to yield a 4 bp stagger. In the present study, an initial examination has been undertaken of the mechanism of sequence-specific recognition by the SmaI endonuclease and compared to that of EcoRV and PvuII which also produce blunt-end scissions. Synthetic oligonucleotides were prepared by solid-phase phosphoramidate synthesis at the Macromolecular Structure Facility, Michigan State University. T4 polynucleotide kinase was from New England Biolabs. [32P]ATP (>3,000 Ci/mmol) for end-labeling was obtained from Amersham Corp. NA-45-DEAE membranes were from Schliecher and Schuell and used according to manufacturer's instructions. Bio-Gel P6 was obtained from Bio-Rad. Formic acid, dimethyl sulfate, and piperidine were obtained from Aldrich. Ethylnitrosurea was purchased from Sigma and hydrazine was supplied by Kodak. Duracryl, high tensile strength acrylamide, was obtained from Millipore Corp. In the studies reported, the endonuclease used was a commercial preparation obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. However, enzyme obtained from New England Biolabs or SmaI purified to homogeneity 2J. C. Dunbar, unpublished results. yielded similar results in all assays. The concentration of the endonuclease ([E]t) was estimated from the x axis intercept in Scatchard plots of equilibrium data binding data(18Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. Wiley, New York1975Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were 5′-endlabeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified by electrophoresis on 18% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The full-length oligomers were recovered by electroelution onto NA-45 membranes and desalted by gel filtration on a Bio-Gel P6 column from which the fragments were eluted with 20% ethanol. Equimolar concentrations of the complementary strands were resuspended in 66 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 7 mM MgCl2, 3 mM dithiothreitol and annealed by heating at 90° for 5 min and then cooling slowly to room temperature. The sample was desalted by gel filtration as described above and the ethanol removed by evaporation. The samples were resuspended in H2O immediately before use. The concentration of DNA was estimated from the absorbance at 260 nm. SmaI•DNA complexes were formed by incubation of the enzyme with 32P-labeled DNA in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mM potassium glutamate, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mM dithiothreitol in a 20-μl reaction volume. Samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature after which 5 μl of loading buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, containing 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 30% glycerol and 0.01% bromphenol blue) was added to the binding reaction. The samples electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 50 mM HEPES, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.8. Electrophoresis was carried out at room temperature at a constant voltage of 200 V in an electrophoresis buffer of 50 mM HEPES and 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.8. The protein•DNA complexes were detected by autoradiography. The equilibrium association constant was determined for the binding of SmaI to a specific recognition oligonucleotide as shown: CATGACTGGCCCGGGATCCAGT, CTGACCGGGCCCTAGGTCAGTA, and also to a 195-bp fragment. The latter fragment was obtained from amplification of the sequences surrounding the SmaI site in M13mp18 using the reaction conditions and primer set C as described previously(19Withers B.E. Dunbar J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2571-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The DNA substrates were 5′-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase, and binding reactions were carried out as described above in a 20-μl reaction volume. The concentration of endonuclease was 1 nM for binding to the 195-bp fragment (0.01-5 nM DNA) and 4.0 nM for incubation with the oligonucleotide substrate (0.2-40 nM DNA). Reactions were incubated for 1 h at room temperature after which the free DNA and protein•DNA complexes were separated by electrophoresis on either a 7.5% (195-bp fragment) or 10% (oligonucleotide substrate) non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel as described above. The distribution of radioactivity between protein-bound and free DNA was quantitated on an AMBIS Radioanalytical Imaging System (AMBIS, San Diego, CA). The amount of single-stranded DNA in the oligonucleotide-containing samples was less than 10% of the total DNA concentration. The association constant was determined from the reciprocal of the dissociation constant which was estimated from non-linear regression analysis of the binding data. The nonspecific association constant was estimated from equilibrium competition assays as described by Terry et al.(20Terry B. Jack W. Rubin R. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9820-9825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide fragment in the competition assays was a GC-rich 22-bp duplex oligonucleotide (ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC) lacking the SmaI recognition site. The competitor DNA for the 195-bp substrate was obtained from polymerase chain reaction amplification of M13mp19 using the forward primer of primer set E and the reverse primer from primer set F, as described previously(19Withers B.E. Dunbar J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2571-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The 229-bp product was digested with BamHI to remove the SmaI site. The cleaved sample was electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel, and the resulting 185-bp fragment was subsequently purified using Magic PCR Preps DNA Purification System (Promega). Steady-state cleavage assays were carried out at room temperature in 50 mM potassium acetate, 20 mM Tris- acetate, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.4. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the endonuclease to a final concentration of 70 pM, and 3-μl samples were withdrawn at various intervals and quenched by the addition of an equal volume of cold “stop” solution (50 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 30% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue). Samples were kept on ice until all time points were taken and then diluted with an equal volume of H2O prior to loading on a 20% polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was carried out in TBE buffer in 8-cm gels at a constant voltage of 17 V/cm. The percent radioactivity in substrate and product was quantitated on an AMBIS Radioanalytical Imaging System. The initial velocities at each substrate concentration were obtained from the linear plots of product formed versus time over a period in which less than 10% of substrate was utilized. Substrate concentrations ranged from 5 to 100 nM which corresponds to approximately 0.3-6.0 times the calculated Km. The kinetic constants were calculated from the initial velocity data using Enzfitter (Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom) software. Chemical modification of the oligonucleotides with dimethyl sulfate was carried out essentially as described by Siebenlist and Gilbert(21Siebenlist U. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 121-126Crossref Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Approximately 10 μg of the duplex oligonucleotide, in which only one of the strands was 5′-end-labeled, was resuspended in 200 μl of 50 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 8.0, and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0. 1 μl of DMS was added, and the samples were incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 40 μl of DMS stop solution (1.5 M sodium acetate, pH 7.0, containing 1 M 2-mercaptoethanol). The methylated DNA was ethanol precipitated (in the presence of 5 μg of tRNA), washed with 80% ethanol, and dried under vacuum. The DNA was resuspended in dH2O and subsequently used as a substrate for endonuclease binding and gel retardation assays as described above. The DNA in the protein•DNA complexes and the free DNA was electrotransferred onto NA45 membranes, eluted with 1 M NaCl, extracted with phenol-chloroform, and recovered by ethanol precipitation. Strand cleavage at the sites of modification was carried out by incubation of the sample in 100 μl of 10% piperidine at 90°C for 30 min. Samples were three times lyophilized to remove the piperidine and subsequently analyzed on denaturing (20%) polyacrylamide gels. The depurination and depyrimidination modification reactions were carried out on the single-stranded oligonucleotides which were subsequently annealed to the complementary, unmodified strand. Pyrimidine modification of the 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotides (10 μg) was carried out essentially as described by Brunelle and Schlief (22Brunelle A. Schlief R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6673-6676Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 200 μl of hydrazine stop buffer (0.3 M sodium acetate, pH 7.0, containing 1 mM EDTA). The DNA was ethanol precipitated in the presence of 5 μg of tRNA, washed with 80% ethanol, and dried under vacuum. Depurination reactions were carried out using formic acid as described previously(22Brunelle A. Schlief R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6673-6676Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). 10 μg of 5′-end-labeled single-stranded DNA was suspended in 100 μl of 50 mM sodium cacodylate. 100 μl of ethanol saturated with ethylnitrosurea was added, and the reaction was incubated for 1 h at 50°C after which the DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. Modified oligonucleotides were annealed to the unmodified complementary strand and the duplex oligonucleotides used as substrates for protein binding. Binding reactions, retardation assays, and DNA isolation were performed as described above. The DNA was resuspended in 15 μl of 10 mM NaPO4, pH 7.0, containing 1 mM EDTA, and strand scission was carried by the addition of 2.5 μl of 1 M NaOH and incubation of the reaction at 90°C for 30 min. The DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation and analyzed on 18% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. A ladder of sized DNA fragments was generated by phosphodiesterase digestion of the unmodified DNA. The oligonucleotide was resuspended in 25 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.4, containing 5 mm of MgCl2 and incubated at 37°C with 3 × 10-3 units of phosphodiesterase. Aliquots were withdrawn at 2-min intervals over a period of 15-20 min. The reaction was stopped at each time point by the addition of chloroform. The samples were pooled and subsequently electrophoresed in an 18% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Band intensities on the sequencing gels used in the interference assays were quantitated after scanning of the autoradiograms with a Bio Image (Kodak) laser scanning densitometer. The data were analyzed with Visage system software (Milligen). Peak areas were used as a measure of image density. Incubation of the SmaI endonuclease with a 22-base duplex oligonucleotide containing the recognition sequence resulted in the appearance of a single protein•DNA complex in gel retardation assays (Fig. 1A). In contrast, no retardation of the DNA was detected when a GC-rich fragment lacking the recognition site was used as a substrate (Fig. 1B) or when the recognition oligonucleotide was modified with the SmaI methylase (data not shown). The inclusion of magnesium in the binding reaction with the specific substrate or the addition of magnesium to preformed complexes resulted in the loss of the complex and the appearance of the cleavage products (Fig. 1C). The SmaI endonuclease therefore appears to form stable specific complexes with DNA in the absence of magnesium. Binding of the endonuclease to the recognition fragment occurs over a narrow range of KCl concentrations with maximum binding occurring at approximately 25 mM KCl. The apparent salt dependence of the protein-DNA interaction was anion-specific. At higher (>30 mM) salt concentrations, the inhibition by potassium glutamate was considerably less than that of potassium chloride at an equivalent concentration (Fig. 2). A similar effect of glutamate has been observed with RsrI (5Aiken C.R. Fisher E.W. Gumport R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19063-19069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as other DNA-binding proteins including DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (23Griep M.A. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11294-11301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the lac repressor(24Ha J-H. Capp M.W. Hohenwalter M.D. Baskerville M. Record T. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 252-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In the latter study, glutamate was concluded to be an inert anion in the relative competition between anions and DNA phosphate groups for binding to the protein. It is significant that, as also shown in Fig. 2, binding of SmaI to the specific substrate also occurred in the absence of KCl or potassium glutamate. SmaI has an absolute requirement for potassium, as well as magnesium, for catalytic activity. This requirement, therefore, appears to reflect a property of the cleavage reaction rather than a role for potassium in substrate recognition. Preliminary studies revealed that the SmaI•DNA complexes are not efficiently retained on nitrocellulose filters under standard binding reaction conditions. Quantitation of the protein•DNA complexes in gel retardation assays was therefore used to estimate the equilibrium association constant for the protein-DNA interaction. The binding isotherm for the interaction of SmaI with the 22-bp oligonucleotide is shown in Fig. 3A. Incubation of a fixed concentration of the enzyme with an increasing concentration of the recognition fragment resulted in a saturatable and hyperbolic binding curve. The site-specific association constant was calculated from the derived Scatchard plot (Fig. 3B) and yielded a KA of 0.91 (±0.32) × 108M-1. Competition assays, similar to those described by Terry et al.(20Terry B. Jack W. Rubin R. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9820-9825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Aiken and Gumport (5Aiken C.R. Fisher E.W. Gumport R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19063-19069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used to determine the relative affinity of SmaI for specific and nonspecific DNA sequences. The Ki for a 22-bp GC-rich fragment, lacking the recognition site, was estimated to be 1.09 × 106M-1. It can be estimated from the minimum size of the oligonucleotide required for maximum activity of the enzyme that the stable interaction of SmaI with DNA appears to require at least 12 bp. The competitor oligonucleotide therefore contains at least 10 possible binding sites for the endonuclease. Consequently, a Ki of approximately 1 × 105M-1/site can be estimated. This value suggests that there is at least a 1,000-fold difference in the affinity of the enzyme for its recognition sequence over that for non-cognate sequences. The specificity of the endonuclease was further examined using a 195-bp recognition fragment. Titration of the DNA substrate with increasing concentrations of the enzyme again resulted in the appearance of a single retarded complex (Fig. 4A). There was no evidence of multiple protein•DNA complexes indicative of nonspecific binding of the endonuclease to the DNA fragment. At the higher concentrations of enzyme there was smearing of the band corresponding to the protein•DNA complex. This effect arises from adding a larger volume of the enzyme (and hence increasing the percentage of glycerol (in which the enzyme is stored)) in the samples. Decreasing the concentration of glycerol in the reactions eliminated the smearing. Titration of the enzyme with the 195-bp fragment and the resulting binding isotherm is shown in Fig. 4, B and C. The corresponding specific association constant was calculated to be 1.23 (± 0.1) × 109M-1 and represents an affinity which is an order of magnitude greater than that observed for the short oligonucleotide substrate. Binding assays carried out in the presence of the 185-bp competitor fragment yielded a value of 3.7 × 107M-1 for the Ki as determined directly from the Dixon plot (Fig. 4D). The site-specific association constant for non-cognate sites (Ki/number of potential binding sites(25Taylor J.D. Badcoe I.G. Clarke A.R. Halford S.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8743-8753Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar)) is approximately 2.08 × 105M-1. The SmaI endonuclease therefore exhibited an affinity for its recognition site approximately 104 times greater than that of random DNA sequences and which is indicative of sequence-specific binding by the enzyme in the absence of magnesium. Steady-state kinetic analysis of SmaI cleavage of the specific oligonucleotide substrate is shown in Fig. 5. The reactions were carried out at room temperature, and no dissociation of the double-stranded substrate during the course of the reaction was evident in the gel electrophoresis assays. The endonuclease obeys Michealis-Menten kinetics and can be saturated with substrate. The kinetic analyses yielded a Km of 17.3 nM and a kcat of 23.8 min-1 (average of three determinations). The results of the methylation interference assays in which the DNA was partially alkylated with dimethyl sulfate at the N-7 position of guanine are shown in Fig. 6A. The same 22-bp duplex oligonucleotide, as used in the binding assays, was also used as a substrate for DNA binding in these experiments. The protein-bound and free DNA probes were isolated and cleaved at the phosphodiester bond at each of the methylated bases. Comparison of the cleavage patterns of the free DNA and the DNA present in the protein•DNA complex suggested that N7 methylation of any of the purines within the recognition site significantly decreased the protein-DNA interaction. Modification of guanines beyond the recognition site did not appear to interfere with complex formation. SmaI therefore appears to make sequence specific contacts with each of the guanines in the major groove of the DNA. The importance of the guanine bases in sequence specific binding was further indicated by missing nucleoside analyses(22Brunelle A. Schlief R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6673-6676Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This latter approach, in which the purine or pyrimidine bases can be selectivley removed from the DNA, provides a method for analyzing the contribution of both purines and pyrimidines to the specific recognition of the DNA by the protein. Furthermore, while methylation effects may arise from steric hindrance, the effect of base removal, as used in these experiments, more accurately reflects potential H-bond interactions. The oligonucleotide substrate used in the missing base analysis was a 30-bp oligomer GCATGCACATGACTGGCCCGGGATCCAGT, ACGTGTACTGACCGGGCCCTAGGTCATCGT. The internal sequence of the oligonucleotide was identical to that of the 22-mer, used in the methylation interference assays, but the fragment contained additional bases at the 5′-end to facilitate the recovery of more fragments flanking the recognition site after cleavage of the DNA. Maxam-Gilbert sequencing of each strand of the control oligonucleotide revealed that the upper strand was heterogeneous in that it contained a dG in addition to the correct dC at the third position of the recognition site, i.e. CC(C/G)GGG (and is apparent in the control T+C lane in Fig. 6B). The presence of the mixed bases is presumed not to interfere with the footprinting experiments since the fragments with the incorrect recognition sequence will not be specifically bound by the endonuclease. Fig. 6B is representative of the autoradiograms obtained for the missing base analyses of the SmaI-DNA interaction. An autoradiogram corresponding to the top strand only is shown for illustrative purposes and the results for both top and bottom strands are summarized in Fig. 6C and are representative of three different experiments. Comparison of the band intensities in the lanes corresponding to the protein-bound and free DNA revealed that depurination of the guanines within the recognition site significantly reduced protein binding. The absence of guanines in the lanes corresponding to the protein•DNA complex was evident for both the top and bottom strands of the recognition fragment. Similarly, in the protein-bound lanes there was a marked reduction in intensity of the fragments corresponding"

Anesthetized instrumented beagles of either sex weighing 10.2 ± 0.4 kg (n = 25) were exposed to dual periods of hypoxia (4 min each, PO2 ~ 15 ± 3 mmHg). Dogs were divided into four groups according to the duration of reoxygenation and propranolol treatment: group 1 (n = 7), 20 min of reoxygenation; group 2 (n = 7), 40 min of reoxygenation; group 3 (n = 6), 60 min of reoxygenation; group 4 (n = 5), 50 min of reoxygenation plus propranolol. Dogs in groups 1 and 4 experienced a significant reduction in percent ectopy during their second exposure to hypoxia [group 1; 47 ± 9% vs. 11 ± 6%, group 4; 50 ± 1% vs. 1 ± 2%, (P < 0.05)]. There were no significant differences in percent ectopy between the two periods of hypoxia in either group 2 or group 3 dogs (e.g., group 2; 50 ± 1% vs. 51 ± 11%). The results show that a first exposure to hypoxia can precondition the myocardium against arrhythmogenic effects of a second period of hypoxia.—O'Connor, P. J., Merrill, G. F.

https://openalex.org/W1995882057,"The binding of chicken gizzard caldesmon to actin was studied both in the presence and the absence of caltropin using Airfuge centrifugation experiments, disulfide cross-linking studies, and the fluorescent probe acrylodan (6-acryloyl-2-(dimethylamino)napththalene). In co-sedimentation studies most of the caldesmon pelleted along with actin. However, when caldesmon in the presence of caltropin was mixed with actin, caldesmon did not pellet along with actin following high speed centrifugation, suggesting that caltropin has significantly weakened its binding to actin. The caltropin effect was noticed even when tropomyosin was included in the reaction mixture. Acrylodan-labeled caldesmon, when excited at 375 nm, had an emission maximum at 515 ± 2 nm. The addition of actin produced a nearly 70% increase in fluorescent intensity, accompanied by a blue shift in the emission maximum (i.e. λem(max) = 505 ± 2 nm), suggesting that the probe now occupies a more nonpolar environment. Titration of labeled caldesmon with actin indicated a strong affinity (Ka = ~6 × 107M-1). When actin was titrated with labeled caldesmon in the presence of caltropin in a 0.2 mM Ca2+ medium, its affinity for caldesmon was lowered (Ka = ~2 × 107M-1). Caltropin, which is very effective in reversing caldesmon's inhibition of the actin-activated myosin ATPase (Mani, R. S., McCubbin, W. D., and Kay, C.

Caltropin, which is very effective in reversing caldesmon's inhibition of the actin-activated myosin ATPase (Mani, R. S., McCubbin, W. D., and Kay, C. M.(1992) Biochemistry 31, 11896-11901), is shown in the present study to have a pronounced effect on its binding to actin, suggesting a major role for caltropin in regulating caldesmon in smooth muscle. In smooth muscle, calcium exerts its control via mechanisms based on both the thick (myosin) filaments (Sobieszek and Bremel, 1975) and the thin (actin-based) filaments (Chalovich, 1993; Sobue and Sellers, 1991). The thin filament-linked pathway involves actin-mediated regulation by caldesmon, a protein that is found bound to the thin filaments (Furst et al., 1986; Lehman et al., 1987; Walsh and Sutherland, 1989). When purified caldesmon binds to actin-tropomyosin, it inhibits the superprecipitation of actomyosin (Sobue et al., 1981) and the actin-activated ATPase activity of both myosin (Dabrowska et al., 1985; Moody et al., 1985; Sobue et al., 1985) and its subfragments (Lash et al., 1986; Chalovich et al., 1987). Recent studies with caldesmon fragments and smooth muscle fibers (Pfitzer et al., 1994; Katsuyama et al., 1992) demonstrate the physiological feasibility of the regulation of smooth muscle contraction by caldesmon. However, defining the precise role of caldesmon in cells requires an understanding of its interactions with several key proteins, namely actin, myosin, calmodulin, and caltropin. Caldesmon binds to actin and myosin with strong affinity (Velaz et al., 1989; Hemric and Chalovich, 1990). Recent studies suggest that caldesmon inhibits the binding of myosin-ATP to actin, thereby inhibiting ATP hydrolysis (Velaz et al., 1989). In an earlier study (Mani and Kay, 1993), we have shown that caldesmon binds to smooth muscle heavy meromyosin with high affinity and that this interaction was weakened in the presence of caltropin (Ca2+), a high affinity smooth muscle calcium-binding protein. Caltropin, which is very potent in reversing the inhibitory effect of caldesmon in the presence of calcium (Mani et al., 1992), modulates the interaction between caldesmon and heavy meromyosin in a calcium-dependent manner. The caltropin effect on caldesmon may be summarized as follows. Caldesmon, by virtue of its ability to interact with both myosin and actin, is able to inhibit the actin-activated myosin ATPase activity by interfering in the actin-myosin interaction. In the presence of Ca2+ caltropin, the affinity of caldesmon for myosin is lowered; as a consequence myosin is able to interact effectively with actin, resulting in restoring the actin-activated myosin ATPase activity. However, any proposed mechanism to account for the effect of caltropin on caldesmon should include not only the caldesmon-myosin interaction but also the caldesmon-actin interaction. For this reason, in the present study the effect of caltropin on the interaction between caldesmon and actin was investigated by the co-sedimentation method and fluorescence measurements using the fluorescent probe acrylodan 1The abbreviation used is: acrylodan6-acryloyl-2-(dimethylamino) napththalene. to label both the sulfhydryl groups in caldesmon. Using these techniques we have shown that caltropin in the presence of calcium was effective in weakening the interaction between caldesmon and actin. 6-acryloyl-2-(dimethylamino) napththalene. Caltropin and caldesmon were isolated from chicken gizzard using the procedure described in our earlier papers (Mani and Kay, 1990; Mani et al., 1992). F-actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle according to Pardee and Spudich(1982). Rabbit skeletal muscle actin (10 μM) was polymerized using a solvent system consisting of 2 mM MgCl2, 42 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mM CaCl2. Subsequent to polymerization, F-actin was incubated with caldesmon (1.0-3.0 μM) resulting in a range of caldesmon to actin ratios of 0.1-0.3. Following incubation for 20 min, the protein mixtures were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min in an air-driven ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments). Under these conditions caldesmon was not pelleted when centrifuged in the absence of actin. The pelleted samples were solubilized in SDS-gel running buffers and were analyzed using 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Fluorescence spectra were obtained with a Perkin-Elmer model MPF-44 spectrofluorometer, and all measurements were made at 20°C. Caldesmon was labeled with acrylodan following the procedure of Prendergast et al. (1983) as described in our earlier paper (Mani et al., 1992). The ratio of label to protein was determined to be 1.9, suggesting that both of the sulfhydryl groups in caldesmon were labeled under these conditions. Labeled caldesmon was titrated with F-actin by following the changes in fluorescence intensity at 470 nm. The excitation wavelength used was 375 nm, at which the probe acrylodan has maximum absorption. The initial A375 of the labeled caldesmon was ≤0.05. The fluorescence quenching was measured at the emission maximum (505 nm) for the labeled caldesmon-actin complex following the addition of 8 M acrylamide in small aliquots. The theory of acrylamide quenching and the mathematical treatment of the data are described by Lehrer and Leavis(1978). The binding of caldesmon to actin was studied by a co-sedimentation method. When caldesmon/actin mixtures of varying ratios (see “Materials and Methods”) were subjected to high speed centrifugation, most of the caldesmon co-sedimented with F-actin whether Ca2+ was present or not (Fig. 1, lane b). The addition of Ca2+/caltropin to actin prior to the addition of caldesmon had a pronounced effect on the ability of caldesmon to interact with actin. Under these conditions most of the caldesmon did not co-sediment with actin (Fig. 1, lane a), i.e. caldesmon was now present in the supernatant along with caltropin. However, when this experiment was repeated in the presence of 1 mM EGTA (i.e. in the absence of calcium) most of the caldesmon could be pelleted along with actin (Fig. 1, lane d), suggesting that caltropin has no significant effect on caldesmon-actin interaction in the absence of calcium. This finding is consistent with our earlier studies involving bioassays (Mani et al., 1992) where caltropin was shown to be effective in releasing the inhibition of caldesmon only in the presence of calcium. Caltropin was also effective in releasing caldesmon from actin filaments even in the presence of tropomyosin. Control experiments indicated that neither caldesmon nor caltropin sedimented by itself, and we also found no interaction between caltropin and actin. Acrylodan, a sulfhydryl-specific fluorescent probe, is very useful for studying protein-protein interactions. Because sulfhydryl groups in chicken gizzard caldesmon can be modified without the protein losing its activity (Hemric and Chalovich, 1990), we decided to label both the sulfhydryl groups in caldesmon with acrylodan. When the labeled caldesmon was excited at 375 nm, the emission maximum occurred at 515 ± 2 nm in both the presence and the absence of calcium. The addition of actin resulted in a blue shift in the emission maximum, which was then centered at 505 ± 2 nm. Even though there was no significant change in fluorescence intensity around the emission maximum, a significant increase in relative fluorescence intensity (nearly 70%) was observed at 470 nm (Fig. 2). For this reason, during the titration of labeled caldesmon with actin, the fluorescence intensity at 470 nm was monitored. Analysis of the titration curve indicated that the maximum increase in fluorescence intensity was achieved by the time 7 mol of actin were added per mol of caldesmon (Fig. 3). Also shown in the figure is the titration of actin with the caldesmon-caltropin complex. Addition of caltropin to labeled caldesmon in the presence of calcium produced an increase in fluorescence intensity. The observed fluorescence intensity in the presence of caltropin was taken as the starting value for the titration with actin. In this instance also the maximum change was reached when 7 mol of actin were added. However, as can be seen from Fig. 3, actin binds to the caldesmon-caltropin complex with lower affinity. For example, for a 50% increase in fluorescence intensity, the amount of actin required for caldesmon and the caldesmon-caltropin complex corresponded to 0.15 and 0.25 μM, respectively. The shape of the titration curve suggests the existence of more than one class of binding site. If all seven actins were to bind with the same affinity, then the observed increase in fluorescence intensity would be linear until 7 mol of actin were added, at which stage the observed increase in fluorescence intensity would correspond to the maximum level (i.e. it will level off). If one were to draw tangents to the initial slope of the titration curve and to the asymptotic part of the curve (i.e. where the curve levels off), then the point of intersection should correspond to the number of high affinity binding sites. The stoichiometry obtained using this approach corresponds to a value of 2.8 and 3.5 mol of actin for the caldesmon and the caldesmon-caltropin complex, respectively. In other words, out of seven actins that are required for saturation, only three are binding with high affinity. If one assumes that the observed fluorescence change is the result of actin binding to caldesmon, then one can calculate the amount of actin bound at any given point in the titration curve. Knowing the amount of actin added, one can deduce the amount of free actin that is present. When Scatchard analysis was carried out, with the amounts of the bound and free actin and the caldesmon concentration used for the titration known, a best fit was also obtained when the ratio of actin to caldesmon was 3:1 (Fig. 4). From the slope term of the Scatchard plot, a Ka value of (6.0 ± 0.5) × 107M-1 was calculated from three sets of titration data, suggesting that caldesmon binds to actin with high affinity. Also shown in Fig. 3 is the titration of actin with the caldesmon-caltropin complex. Actin binds to this binary complex with lower affinity, because the Ka value obtained was only (2.5 ± 0.5) × 107M-1. The presence of caltropin has lowered the affinity of caldesmon for actin more than 2-fold.Figure 3:Influence of actin on acrylodan-caldesmon (•) and acrylodan caldesmon-caltropin fluorescence (○). The initial caldesmon concentration was 1.0 × 107M-1. Measurements were carried out in 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 42 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM CaCl2, and 1 mM dithiothreitol at 20°C. Relative changes in fluorescence intensities (ΔF/ΔFmax) at 470 nm are plotted as functions of actin concentration. The excitation wavelength was 375 nm. The data points shown on the titration curves are based on the results obtained from three sets of titrations. The size of the symbols on these curves takes into account the observed experimental errors.

Bound actin was determined from the change in fluorescence intensity, which is directly proportional to binding. γ is the number of moles of ligand bound to 1 mol of macromolecules; it is defined as γ = [A]bound/[P]total. The conditions were the same as described in the legend of Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The change in fluorescence intensity as a function of added actin was also analyzed using double-inverse plots. The affinities of actin for caldesmon and the caldesmon-caltropin complex determined from the abscissa intercepts of the double inverse plots were 1 × 106 and 5 × 105M-1, respectively (data not shown), and this probably represents the average Ka values for the high and the low affinity binding sites. In earlier studies involving the interaction of caldesmon and actin, several other investigators have also suggested the existence of high and low affinity binding sites (Moody et al., 1985; Lash et al., 1986; Horiuchi et al., 1986; Smith et al., 1987). We also wanted to see if caltropin could influence caldesmon-actin interaction in the presence of tropomyosin. For this reason we carried out fluorescence titration experiments with labeled caldesmon containing tropomyosin with actin in the presence and the absence of caltropin. In this instance the affinity of caldesmon for actin was also lowered by more than 2-fold when caltropin was present, suggesting that caltropin could function even in the presence of tropomyosin. The observed increase in fluorescence intensity accompanied by a blue shift in the emission maximum upon actin binding could be due to a decrease in the exposure of the probe to solvent quenchers. Fig. 5 shows the effect of the acrylamide quencher on the fluorescence intensity of caldesmon, the caldesmon-actin complex, the caldesmon-caltropin (Ca2+)-actin ternary complex, the caldesmon-tropomyosin-actin complex, and the caldesmon-tropomyosin-caltropin (Ca2+)-actin complex. The linear portion of the plots at low acrylamide concentration gave Stern-Volmer constants (KSV) of 2.1, 1.7, 1.2, 1.1, and 0.6 for the caldesmon, caldesmon-actin, caldesmon-caltropin-actin, caldesmon-tropomyosin-actin, and caldesmon-tropomyosin-caltropin-actin complexes, respectively. The value of the Stern-Volmer quenching constant obtained is higher for caldesmon than for the caldesmon-actin complex. Thus actin does shield the label on caldesmon from the solvent quencher. The addition of Ca2+ caltropin to the caldesmon-actin complex results in further lowering of the quenching constant, suggesting that the label now moves to a more hydrophobic environment (i.e. the label is now more protected from the quencher). This effect of caltropin was also noticed for the caldesmon-tropomyosin-actin complex. In other words, caltropin was effective in shielding the label even when tropomyosin was present in the caldesmon-actin complex. Even though both the sulfhydryl groups in caldesmon (Cys-153 and Cys-580) are labeled, we believe the observed effect of caltropin and actin on acrylamide quenching is due to the binding of these proteins at or near the label Cys-580, because actin and caltropin are known to bind at the COOH-terminal end of caldesmon (Szpacenko and Dabrowska, 1986; Zhuang et al., 1994) and thus shield the label from collisions with quenchers in the medium. Caldesmon binds tightly to myosin (Ka = ~106M-1), actin (Ka = ~106-107M-1), and tropomyosin (Ka = ~106M-1) and inhibits the actin-activated ATPase of smooth and skeletal myosins and their subfragments (Lash et al., 1986; Hemric and Chalovich, 1988; Velaz et al., 1989; Horiuchi and Chacko, 1988). These characteristics of caldesmon make it a potential candidate for the regulation of actomyosin interaction. Simultaneous binding of caldesmon to actin and myosin may provide an additional role for caldesmon in stabilizing the structure of the contractile apparatus or may even maintain tension in the latch state of smooth muscle. The interaction between caldesmon and actin is important for several reasons. First, the binding of caldesmon to the NH2-terminal end of actin results in the inhibition of ATP hydrolysis by actomyosin (Crosbie et al., 1994), suggesting a regulatory role for caldesmon in the filament-linked regulation of smooth muscle contraction. Even though we know that the COOH-terminal region of caldesmon binds to the NH2-terminal end of actin, many questions regarding the interaction remain unanswered. Caldesmon appears to bind along the actin filament (Lehman et al., 1989) with each caldesmon monomer covering several actin monomers (Velaz et al., 1989). Unlike tropomyosin, caldesmon does not have repeating actin-binding structural units, and for this reason it is unclear how the binding of the COOH-terminal region of caldesmon stabilizes its binding along several actin monomers. In the presence of calcium, calcium-binding proteins such as caltropin and calmodulin can release caldesmon's inhibition of the actin-activated myosin ATPase. In order to get an insight into the mechanism by which these calcium-binding proteins release the inhibition of caldesmon, we studied the influence of caltropin on the caldesmon-actin interaction using co-sedimentation and fluorescence measurements using labeled caldesmon. Caltropin in the presence of Ca2+ was very effective in weakening the interaction between caldesmon and actin. The addition of actin to labeled caldesmon produced an increase in fluorescence intensity that leveled off when the mole ratio of actin to caldesmon was nearly 7. There is uncertainty in the in vivo and in vitro stoichiometric ratio of caldesmon to actin, raising questions as to the assembly and arrangement of caldesmon on the actin filament. According to Marston et al.(1992), the in vivo ratio is about one caldesmon molecule/14 actin monomers, whereas the in vitro values reported range from 3 to 7 actin monomers/caldesmon molecule for maximum inhibition of ATPase activity. The length of caldesmon has been estimated to be 740 Å. If caldesmon binds to both sides of an actin filament like tropomyosin, then a maximum of 14 actin monomers could be covered by a single caldesmon molecule, consistent with the in vivo determinations. Graceffa and Jancso(1991) studied cross-linking of caldesmon to actin as a function of caldesmon concentration and demonstrated that only 3-4 actin monomers could be cross-linked to one caldesmon molecule, hence reinforcing the difference in the in vivo and in vitro determinations. Native thin filaments also contain calponin (Nishida et al., 1990), which also binds actin. The presence of calponin might limit the amount of caldesmon bound to actin, and this could explain the observed difference between the in vivo and the in vitro estimations. From this study we conclude that caltropin in the presence of Ca2+ is effective in weakening the interaction between caldesmon and actin. Caldesmon has been implicated to act as a competitive inhibitor of myosin binding to actin. Caldesmon can bind to actin with strong affinity at or near the myosin binding region (i.e. at the NH2-terminal end of actin), thus blocking myosin from binding to actin and resulting in lowered ATPase activity (Chalovich et al., 1987). Caldesmon, which binds caltropin in the presence of Ca2+ with high affinity (Mani et al., 1992), undergoes a conformational change; as a consequence we believe it binds to actin with lower affinity and is no longer able to compete with myosin for binding to actin, resulting in the recovery of the ATPase activity. In this context Graceffa and Jansco(1991) have also evoked a similar mechanism to explain the effect of Ca2+/calmodulin on caldesmon-actin interaction. A possible fine tuning mechanism for cooperative caldesmon regulation of the thin filament is shown in Fig. 6. The regulatory properties of caldesmon are similar to troponin in most details as indicated by Marston and Redwood(1993). The COOH-terminal region of caldesmon named domain 4b comprising amino acid residues 658-756 is closely analogous to the inhibitory peptide of troponin (troponin-I). Domain 3 of caldesmon (i.e. residues 508-565) is homologous to the CB2 region of troponin-T (i.e. residues 71-151, which are implicated in tropomyosin binding). For this reason we have indicated in our model that region 4b and domain 3 of caldesmon bind to actin and tropomyosin, respectively. Tropronin-C (the Ca2+-binding subunit) is part of the troponin complex, whereas in smooth muscle the Ca2+ factor caltropin is not a part of caldesmon. Caldesmon can bind tightly to myosin as well as to actin, and caltropin has no effect on these interactions in the absence of calcium as shown in our model (Fig. 6). Caldesmon is known to compete with myosin and myosin fragments for the binding to actin in rigor (Hemric and Chalovich, 1988), and this indicates the existence of at least a partial overlap in their actin-binding sites and could form the basis of the regulatory function of caldesmon. According to Chalovich et al.(1987), caldesmon acts as a competitive inhibitor of the binding of myosin to actin, because the COOH-terminal end of caldesmon that does not bind to myosin is able to inhibit ATP hydrolysis. Calmodulin and caltropin in the presence of Ca2+ can release the inhibition of caldesmon without displacing caldesmon from the actin filament (Smith et al., 1987; Marston and Smith, 1985; Mani et al., 1992). According to our proposed model, in the presence of Ca2+, caltropin binds to caldesmon with high affinity (Mani et al., 1992) and induces a conformational change in caldesmon with the result that caldesmon binds to actin with lower affinity ( ~3-fold) and is no longer able to compete with myosin for binding to actin resulting in the release of the inhibition. Current studies have clearly demonstrated the importance of this cooperative unit consisting of caldesmon-tropomyosinactin in regulating the smooth muscle thin filament. Even though in vitro studies involving the interaction of caldesmon with individual proteins, namely tropomyosin, actin, and myosin, and the calcium-binding proteins have been studied in detail, caution should be exercised in interpreting these results, because most of these studies involve interaction of caldesmon with either thick or thin filament proteins. It is necessary to relate these findings with the individual proteins to the integrated system consisting of both the thick and thin filament assembly, namely the actomyosin system. We thank A. Keri, K. Oikawa, and L. Hicks for excellent technical assistance."

Expression of the peptide-MHC complex on APC surface is preceded by several steps that include the generation of peptide fragments in the cytoplasm and their assembly with MHC molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum. It is now clear that MHC binding to optimally processed peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum is obligatory for their stable expression on the cell surface. However, whether a similar obligatory relationship exists between generation of processed peptides and their expression as peptide-MHC on APC surface is not known. Here, we addressed this question by analyzing the processing of ovalbumin (aa257-264, SL8) or influenza nucleoprotein (aa366-374, AM9) analogs. We examined the generation of naturally processed peptides using precursors that did, or did not, contain residues flanking the optimal MHC-binding peptides. By characterizing the peptides generated from these precursors by T-cell stimulation assays and by high performance liquid chromatography analysis, we established that intracellular assembly of peptide-MHC complexes and their expression on the cell surface can occur with peptides that lack flanking residues. The presentation of these endogenously synthesized perfect fit peptides demonstrates that the cleavage of precursor polypeptides is an independent step in the antigen presentation pathway.

At least four distinct events are necessary for generating peptide-MHC complexes on the APC surface. (a) Intracellular proteins are fragmented, and their peptide products are (b) transported into the ER wherein (c) they are assembled into peptide-MHC complexes that (d) travel to their final destination on the cell surface(8Monaco J.J.

Indeed, the last three steps (b-d) of this pathway are concerted. Loss of either one or both subunits of the TAP1/2 transporter prevents assembly and surface expression of peptide-MHC complexes(16Townsend A. Ohlen C. Bastin J. Ljunggren H.-G. Foster L. Karre K.

Likewise, empty MHC class I molecules are physically associated with the TAP heterodimer as well as with calnexin and are retained in the ER until they bind peptides(21Ortmann B. Androlewicz M.J. Cresswell P. Nature. 1994; 368: 864-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 22Suh W.-K. Cohen-Doyle M. Fruh K. Wang K. Peterson P. Williams D.B.

Thus, peptide transport, assembly of peptide-MHC complexes, and their expression on the cell surface are sequential and concerted steps. Because all known naturally processed peptides represent proteolytic products of cellular proteins, existence of a similar obligatory relationship, if any, between the requirements for proteolysis and display of their products on the cell surface is not known. For example, it is conceivable that, under physiological conditions, TAP may transport only those endogenous peptides that were produced by the proteasome. Current evidence favors the 26S proteasome, containing the MHC-encoded (24Brown G.M. Driscoll J. Monaco J.J. Nature. 1991; 353: 355-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 25Martinez C.K.

Whether this is the only mechanism for generating processed peptides has been questioned first by the intact antigen presenting ability of cell lines lacking both LMP-2 and LMP-7(30Arnold D.

Ashton-Rickardt P.G. Ploegh H.L. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1992; 71: 1205-1214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) and LMP-7 (33Fehling H.J. Swat W. Laplace C. Kuhn R. Rajewsky K.

Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. Doherty P. Tonegawa S. Immunity. 1994; 1: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). TAP1 mutant mice are virtually devoid of MHC molecules on the cell surface, fail to present endogenous peptide-MHC class I complexes, and as a consequence are severely depleted in their CD8+ T-cell subset in the thymus and periphery(20van Kaer L.

Tonegawa S. Cell. 1993; 74: 577-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). By contrast, LMP-7 or LMP-2 mutant mice express significant to normal levels of MHC and CD8+ T-cells and show only selective defects in antigen presentation to T-cells(33Fehling H.J. Swat W. Laplace C. Kuhn R. Rajewsky K. Muller U. von Boehmer H. Science. 1994; 265: 1234-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 34Van Kaer L. Ashton-Rickardt P.G. Eichelberger M. Gaczynska M. Nagashima K. Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. Doherty P. Tonegawa S. Immunity. 1994; 1: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Whether the incomplete defects in peptide-MHC expression in LMP-2 and LMP-7 mutant mice can be attributed to a reduced or abnormal supply of naturally processed peptides and/or to inefficient peptide transport by disruption of LMP-2 and/or LMP-7-dependent link between the proteasome and the TAP complex is presently unclear. Thus, while it is established that efficient supply of cytoplasmic peptides to the MHC in the ER depends upon proteolysis (37Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2194) Google Scholar), as well as TAP-mediated transport(20van Kaer L. Ashton-Rickardt P.G. Ploegh H.L. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1992; 71: 1205-1214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar), the mechanism(s) that generate naturally processed peptides and deliver them to TAP remain poorly understood. A different approach to addressing the role of proteolysis in antigen presentation is to focus on the antigen rather than the protease(s). By examining the processed products of antigen precursors that do or do not contain residues flanking the optimal MHC-binding (“perfect-fit”) peptides, we can determine whether peptide cleavage had occurred and whether it was an obligatory step in the expression of peptide-MHC complexes on the cell surface. Although conceptually straightforward, this approach has been difficult to implement. First, only vanishingly small amounts of processed peptides are present in the APC, and individual peptides are detectable in complex cell extracts only because of highly sensitive T-cell activation assays(3Van Bleek G.M. Nathenson S.G. Nature. 1990; 348: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 4Rotzschke O. Falk K. Deres K. Schild H. Norda M. Metzger J. Jung G. Rammensee H.-G.

Science. 1994; 264: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Second, a more profound problem is the fact that efficient synthesis of precursor polypeptide requires presence of the translational initiation (“ATG,” methionine) codon(15Shastri N. Nguyen V. Gonzalez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1088-1091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 39Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, endogenously synthesized perfect-fit precursors must contain methionine as the first residue of the processed peptide. Recently, we showed that cells expressing minimal analogs of the ovalbumin octapeptide, aa257-264 (SIINFEKL, SL8), serve as efficient APCs for SL8/Kb-specific T-cells as well as allow analysis of the processed peptides in HPLC-fractionated cell extracts(14Shastri N. Gonzalez F. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2724-2736PubMed Google Scholar, 40Malarkannan S. Goth S. Buchholz D.R. Shastri N. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 585-598PubMed Google Scholar). By comparing extracts of cells expressing different MHC molecules, we showed that appropriate MHC molecules are essential for stabilizing otherwise rapidly degraded processed peptides. This extreme instability of processed peptides ruled out their direct analysis in cells lacking MHC. However, we noticed one instance where the Met-SL8 (MSL8) peptide was actually present in Db cells expressing the minigene encoding the MSL8 precursor. The fortuitous discovery of the perfect-fit MSL8 peptide that could be endogenously translated as well as be detected as such in cell extracts prompted us to use this model system to address the question of whether cleavage of flanking residues from endogenously synthesized polypeptides is an obligatory step in the antigen presentation pathway. We compared the naturally processed peptides that were generated from N terminally extended precursors or from perfect fit peptides. DNA constructs encoding ovalbumin (OVA257-264, SL8) or influenza nucleoprotein (NP366-374, AM9) analogs were used as model antigens for generating peptide/Kb or Db MHC complexes. MHC-bound peptides were extracted from transfected cells and were characterized by their HPLC elution profiles. Here we show that sequences flanking the optimal MHC-binding peptides were unfailingly cleaved from endogenously synthesized precursors indicating that they were processed. However, perfect fit precursors that exactly matched the optimal MHC-binding peptides were presented on the cell surface as such with comparable efficiency. These results show that cleavage of flanking residues is not obligatory for the intracellular assembly or for cell surface expression of peptide-MHC complexes and establish that proteolytic cleavage of antigenic precursors can be segregated from other steps in the antigen presentation pathway.

G418r transfectants were cloned by limiting dilution and screened for expression of peptide-MHC complexes by T-cell stimulation assay. Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 1 mM pyruvate, 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol, 200 units/ml penicillin, 200 μg/ml streptomycin at 37°C in 5% CO2/humidified air. Kb- or Db-COS cells were transiently transfected with plasmids using the DEAE-dextran method. DNA titrations in 96-well plates for assaying APC function have been described(14Shastri N. Gonzalez F.

For large scale transfections, 1 μg/ml plasmid DNA in 100 μg/ml DEAE-dextran and 100 μM chloroquin phosphate in RPMI 1640 with 10% NU-serum (Collaborative Research) was added to 1-3 × 106 adherent cells in a T25 or T75 flask. After 2 h, the cells were incubated with 10% Me2SO in PBS for 2 min and returned to complete medium. After 2-3 days, cells were either assayed directly for expression of peptide-MHC on the surface (endogenous peptide assay) or used for extracting the naturally processed peptides. The antigen/MHC-specific T cell response was measured as the β-galactosidase activity induced in the T cells following T-cell receptor occupancy(14Shastri N. Gonzalez F. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2724-2736PubMed Google Scholar, 42Sanderson S. Shastri N. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 43Karttunen J. Shastri N. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The β-galactosidase activity induced in the T cells was then measured by addition of the substrate chlorophenol red β-galactoside. After 4 h, the absorbance of the cleaved chlorophenol red in the wells was measured at 595 nm with 635 nm as the reference wavelength. To detect endogenously synthesized peptide-MHC complexes (endogenous peptide assay), cells transfected with DNAs encoding the antigen were used as APCs. To quantitate synthetic peptides or antigenic peptides present in peptide extracts (exogenous peptide assay), T-cells were co-cultured with either Kb- or Db-expressing L-cells in the presence of synthetic or extracted peptides. Endogenous and exogenous peptide assay experiments were repeated at least three times, and typically the sensitivity of the assays was about 1 pM with synthetic standards. Total cellular peptide extractions were achieved by lysing cells in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water as described(40Malarkannan S. Goth S. Buchholz D.R. Shastri N. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 585-598PubMed Google Scholar, 44Falk K. Rötzschke O. Rammensee H.-G. Nature. 1990; 348: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). For extraction of total MHC-bound peptides, 1.2 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet-40, 10 mM EDTA, 0.01% NaN3, 5 mg/ml bestatin, 200 mM puromycin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, 10 mM 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 500 mM iodoacetamide, 0.1 M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added to 1-2 × 106 washed cells. The lysate was incubated on ice for 5 min and centrifuged to pellet cell debris. 10-20 μl of anti-MHC antibody ascites and protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) were added to supernatant fluid and rocked for 1.5 h at 4°C. Peptides were eluted from washed beads with 0.5 ml 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and filtered through a 10-kDa cutoff filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The filtrate was dried in a vacuum centrifuge (Savant Instruments, Inc., Farmingdale, NY). Samples were resuspended in PBS or medium and used for HPLC analysis. For separation of peptides associated with intracellular and cell surface MHC molecules, cells were first incubated with B22.249 (anti-Db) ascites and thoroughly washed before lysis. The supernatant fluid of the centrifuged lysate was added to protein A-Sepharose beads to isolate cell surface MHC molecules. The supernatant fluid of the lysate containing intracellular MHC molecules was then subject to another round of anti-Db immunoprecipitation. Peptides from these MHC immunoprecipitates were eluted and assayed as described above. Data shown are representative of three independent experiments. Samples of peptide extracts were redissolved in PBS and fractionated on an Hewlett Packard 1050 quaternary pump HPLC using a 4.6 × 250-mm Vydac C18 column with 5-μm particle size and 300 Å pores. For the SL8 family of peptides, the gradient began at 77% of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and 23% of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile and increased to 38% of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile at the rate of 0.5%/min. The same gradient was used to separate NP peptide analogs but began at 95% of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and 5% of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. One-ml fractions were collected, dried in a vacuum centrifuge, resuspended in PBS, and used in the exogenous peptide assay. Mock runs of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water were performed and assayed between each sample run to demonstrate absence of peptide carry over from previous runs. These experiments were repeated 2-10 times, and the HPLC profiles were extremely reproducible with less than 0.5 min variation between runs. In Kb APC, processing of the 386 aa ovalbumin protein yields the processed octapeptide OVA257-264 (SL8)(14Shastri N. Gonzalez F. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2724-2736PubMed Google Scholar, 45Rotzschke O.

Rammensee H.-G. Cell Immunol. 1993; 150: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We have recently established that naturally processed SL8 can be detected in HPLC-fractionated trifluoroacetic acid extracts of cells transfected with minimal SL8 precursors such as Met-SL8 (MSL8) or Met-Lys-SL8 (MKSL8) (Fig. 1A; (40Malarkannan S. Goth S. Buchholz D.R. Shastri N. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 585-598PubMed Google Scholar)). This study showed that sequences (Met or Met-Lys) flanking the Kb motif-bearing octapeptide SL8 were removed by a proteolytic step of the antigen processing mechanism. Interestingly, we also found that in cells expressing the Db MHC molecules, the processing of the same precursors yielded nonapeptides (KSL8 or MSL8) that contained an additional residue flanking the SL8 peptide in the trifluoroacetic acid extracts (Fig. 1A in (40Malarkannan S. Goth S. Buchholz D.R. Shastri N. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 585-598PubMed Google Scholar)). Thus, as judged by analysis of trifluoroacetic acid extracts, residues flanking the optimal peptides in each of the precursors tested were consistently and reproducibly removed. Peptide-MHC complexes expressed on the cell surface are first assembled in the ER(47Lapham C.K. Bacik I. Yewdell J.W. Kane K.P. Bennink J.R. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1633-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and the possibility remained that processed peptides in the trifluoroacetic acid extracts represented only a subset of processed peptides (e.g. only those peptides present on the cell surface). To establish that all extra- and intracellular MHC-bound peptides had been cleaved to the optimal SL8 peptide, we looked for possible SL8 analogs that could be bound to Kb MHC in cells lysed with detergents. First, synthetic SL8, KSL8, or MSL8 peptides were all capable of stimulating SL8/Kb-specific B3Z T-cells (Fig. 2A). The dose-response curves, consistently within 2-fold of each other, show that picomolar concentrations of these peptides could be readily detected, and in addition, each of these peptides could also be readily distinguished by their characteristic HPLC elution profiles (Fig. 2B). Second, both MSL8 and MKSL8 DNA constructs allowed generation of T-cell-stimulating peptide/Kb complexes on the cell surface (Fig. 2C). Nevertheless, with both precursors only the cleaved SL8 octapeptide was bound by Kb MHC (Fig. 2D). The HPLC elution profiles of T-cell stimulating activity of naturally processed peptides in anti-Kb (Y3 monoclonal) immunoprecipitates from either MSL8- or MKSL8-transfected cell extracts corresponded exactly to that of synthetic SL8. Other possible candidates such as MSL8 or KSL8 peptides were clearly undetectable and were estimated to represent less than 0.1% of the amount of SL8 recovered. In other experiments (data not shown), the same profiles were obtained when Kb MHC were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antiserum specific for the cytoplasmic tail of Kb(48Jackson M.R. Song E.S. Yang Y. Peterson P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12117-12121Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), ruling out a possible peptide-specific bias in the subset of Kb MHC immunoprecipitated by the Y3 mAb(49Bluestone J.A. Jameson S. Miller S. Dick II, R. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1757-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 50Catipovic B. Porto J.D. Mage M. Johanson T.E. Schneck J.P. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1611-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We conclude that in living cells, similar to the native ovalbumin, the same SL8 octapeptide was processed from these 9-10 aa precursors for presentation by Kb MHC. However, SL8 itself cannot be synthesized within cells without the addition of the methionine residue for initiating translation(15Shastri N. Nguyen V. Gonzalez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1088-1091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, to test whether this proteolytic removal of N-terminal-flanking residues, regardless of the specific mechanism involved, was obligatory for generation of peptide-MHC complexes, we analyzed model precursors that exactly matched the MHC-bound, naturally processed peptides and could be translated within cells. We had observed earlier that the MSL8 nonapeptide was present in total trifluoroacetic acid extracts of Db cells transfected with the MSL8 construct(40Malarkannan S. Goth S. Buchholz D.R. Shastri N. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 585-598PubMed Google Scholar). However, because T-cells specific for MSL8/Db complexes are not available, it remained unclear whether the MSL8 peptide was physically bound to Db and whether it was present on the cell surface as a MSL8-Db complex. To resolve these possibilities, Db-COS cells were transfected with MSL8 or MMSL8 constructs to provide precursors that were either a perfect-fit (MSL8) or contained an additional Met residue (MMSL8) flanking the D"

With isolated F1-ATPases studied so far, azide is a strong inhibitor of multisite, but not of unisite ATPase(6Harris D.A. Biochim. Biophys.

FEBS Lett. 1987; 213: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and is therefore considered to be a specific inhibitor of cooperative interactions between the catalytic sites. Lack of a major anion effect on unisite activity appears to be another common property of MF1 and EF1(11Kasho V.N. Boyer P.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1984; 16: 407-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 12Roveri O.A. Calcaterra N.B. FEBS Lett. 1985; 192: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 13Wong S-Y.

For instance, millimolar free inorganic phosphate activated MF1 unisite ATPase 3-fold(14Penefsky H.S. Grubmeyer C. Papa S. Altendorf K. Ernster L. Packer L.

Gräber P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1016: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 16Fromme P. Gräber P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 187-194Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We were interested in exploring further biochemical parameters of thylakoid unisite ATPase, to compare with unisite ATPase in other types of F1, and with chloroplast multisite ATPase. This has included the effects of different ions, uncouplers, trypsin treatment, pH, energy transfer inhibitors, light, azide, and modification by MalNEt. Our results indicate that chloroplast ATPase shares some properties with other F-type ATPases, but it has some unique characteristics at the unisite level. Also the characteristics of the unisite catalysis differ significantly from those of multisite activity of the same enzyme. All reagent grade chemicals, biochemicals, and enzymes were purchased from Sigma, except for [ γ-32P]ATP (from NEN-DuPont), Elon (from Eastman Kodak Co.), and ammonium molybdate (from Fluka Chemie AG). Both CF1 and thylakoids were prepared from spinach leaves bought from local supermarkets. Thylakoids were prepared as described previously(17Zhang S. Jagendorf A.T. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), with choline chloride in the grinding buffer (25 mM Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 300 mM sorbitol, 200 mM choline chloride, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5 mM ascorbate). Thylakoids were washed once and resuspended in the same grinding buffer at a Chl concentration of 1.0 mg/ml. The Chl concentration was determined as described by Wintermans and DeMots (18Wintermans J.F.G.M. De Mots A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 109: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Thylakoids reduced by DTT in the light were prepared as described elsewhere(17Zhang S. Jagendorf A.T. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In some experiments, reduction was accomplished in the dark by resuspending thylakoids in a buffer containing 20 mM Tricine-NaOH (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, and 20 mM DTT, at a Chl concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. These thylakoids were kept on ice for about 2 h before use. Latent thylakoids were isolated as described above. After washing once with the same grinding buffer, the thylakoids were washed twice in a buffer containing 2 mM Tricine-NaOH (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl, and 1 mM MgCl2 and then resuspended in the same buffer at 0.5 mg Chl/ml. After dilution to 0.2 mg of Chl/ml into light-activating buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 50 μM PMS, and 20 mM DTT), the suspension was illuminated in white light (1.1 mE/m2•s) for 3 min at 25°C. Before turning the light off, 10 volumes of dilution buffer (120 mM KCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 5 mM Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, and 5 mM DTT) were added. The thylakoids were spun down and resuspended in a small volume with the same dilution buffer. After another cycle of illumination-dilution-centrifugation, the thylakoids were resuspended in 20 mM Tricine-NaOH (pH 8.0), 2 mM MgCl2, 50 mM NaCl, and 10 mM DTT. This protocol is modified from the method of Du and Boyer(19Du Z. Boyer P.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Residual nucleotides were measured in control and treated thylakoids by denaturing with perchloric acid, extraction of the perchloric acid with 0.5 M tri-octylamine dissolved in chloroform(20Khym J.X. Clin. Chem. 1975; 21: 1245-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), then measuring ATP with luciferin and purified luciferase (Sigma). Total adenylates in the samples were measured following conversion of ADP to ATP by incubation with phosphocreatine and creatine phosphokinase. Reduced thylakoids were washed once with 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM DTT, 10 mM Tricine-NaOH at pH 7.8, then resuspended to 0.1 mg of Chl/ml in 0.75 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT, 0.5 mM Tricine-NaOH, pH 7.8, for 15 min on ice, with mixing two to three times during the incubation. After centrifugation, the thylakoids were resuspended in a small volume of 20 mM Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 10 mM DTT, and 50 mM NaCl with the Chl concentration at about 0.5 mg/ml. Reduced thylakoids were incubated on ice, at a final concentration of 500 μg of Chl/ml, with trypsin between 25 and 100 μg/ml (weight ratio of 1/5 to 1/20). The digestion was run for 10 min and stopped by addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor to 10 times the concentration of trypsin. The treated thylakoids were spun down in a microcentrifuge at 4°C for 5 min and resuspended in 10 mM Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM DTT. Thylakoids were washed with a buffer containing 20 mM Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, and 2 mM MgCl2. Before being irradiated, the thylakoids were resuspended in the same buffer plus 50 μM PMS, at a Chl concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. After illumination (1.1 mE/m2•s) for 2 min at 25°C, MalNEt was added to a final concentration of 5 mM. The alkylation was allowed to run under continuing illumination for 2 min. After the light was turned off, 20 mM DTT was added to remove residual free MalNEt. The thylakoids were then spun down, resuspended in the original buffer with 10 mM DTT, and stored on ice in the dark for more than 1 h to reduce the CF1 completely. The control sample was treated with deionized water instead of MalNEt. The CF0CF1 content of thylakoids was assumed to be 1.4 nmol/mg of chlorophyll(16Fromme P. Gräber P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 187-194Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The assay conditions were established through numerous trial experiments. All reactions were carried out in Eppendorf tubes, at room temperature (22°C), and either in room light (10-25 μE/m2•s) or in dim light (<2 μE/m2•s). The reaction mixture (60 μl) contained 20 mM Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 10 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl2, and thylakoids at 30 μg of Chl/ml. Other additions are as indicated under “Results.” Thylakoids were first added to the reaction mixture without ATP, then 51 μl of this mixture were added to another Eppendorf tube containing 9 μl of [ γ-32P]ATP (100 nM, with specific activity ~108 cpm/nmol of ATP) to start the reaction, with quick mixing by pipetting. For general activity assays, the reaction was usually run for 60 s before addition of 25 μl of the stop solution, 30 mM Hg(NO3)2 in 5 M acetic acid. After centrifuging, 50 μl of the supernatant were assayed for 32Pi (see below) released by unisite ATPase. For kinetic assays, 90-μl timed aliquots were removed from a larger volume of reaction medium and placed in an Eppendorf tube containing 40 μl of stop solution. To determine pH profiles, a solution containing the buffers MES (pKa 6.0), MOPS (pKa 7.1), Tricine (pKa 7.9), and CHES (pKa 9.0) was mixed with Mg2+ and DTT prior to adjusting the pH. The final concentration of each buffer was 20 mM, 5 mM Mg2+, and 10 mM DTT. Soluble CF1 was purified according to previous descriptions (21Jagendorf A.T. Edelman M. Hallick R.B. Chua N.-H. Methods in Chloroplast Molecular Biology. Elsevier/North Holland Press, Amsterdam1982: 881-898Google Scholar) and stored in 50% saturated ammonium sulfate, 50 mM Tris-Tricine, pH 8.0, 1 mM NaN3, 1 mM ATP. Before each assay, the precipitate was pelleted and redissolved, then desalted twice through Sephadex G-50 (22Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) equilibrated with 50 mM Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 0.1 mM EDTA, 20 mM DTT, and 20% glycerol. After addition of 20 mM DTT and 50 mM Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, the enzyme solution was incubated at room temperature for 2-3 h, and then 15 min at 37°C, allowing the enzyme to be completely reduced. For unisite ATPase, the reaction medium (50 μl) contained 50 mM Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 10 mM DTT, with either 5 mM MgCl2, or 8 mM CaCl2. The ratio of ATP to CF1 was 1:8 with 0.1 μM [ γ-32P]ATP and 0.8 μM CF1 (0.33 mg protein/ml). The reaction was conducted at room temperature for 60 s. The procedure for determination of 32Pi released from labeled [ γ-32P]ATP was modified from the method of Fromme and Gräber(16Fromme P. Gräber P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 187-194Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To each tube containing 50 μl of sample, 200 μl of 4% (w/v) ammonium molybdate in 2.5 M H2SO4, containing 1% (v/v) saturated bromine water were added. Water-saturated butyl acetate (150 μl) was added, and the sample was vortexed to separate complexed Pi from remaining [ γ-32P]ATP. From the organic phase 60 μl were taken to count in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. Background counts, measured in samples prekilled before adding [ γ-32P]ATP, were subtracted from each experimental sample. The total counts of [ γ-32P]ATP in the samples were measured every day and were used to calculate the specific activity of the labeled ATP. Since extremely low ATPase activities are found under unisite conditions, we needed to be sure that they were due to CF1CF0 and not to some contaminating enzyme. Three kinds of evidence supported the CF1 origin of observed ATPase. First, the formation of Pi by membrane-bound enzyme was found to be dependent on prior reduction of the thylakoids (Fig. 1). ATP hydrolysis by the reduced enzyme was almost linear up to 40 s at a turnover rate of 0.003 s-1. By comparison, enzyme activity of the nonreduced thylakoids was insignificant, at most 5% of the rate and that for only the first 20 s. Second, treating thylakoids with EDTA at low ionic strength removes CF1 and causes uncoupling reduced unisite activity more than 90% (data not shown). Third, preliminary experiments showed up to 50% inhibition was found by addition of an antiserum against CF1 (data not shown), but ≤10% inhibition was seen with the preimmune serum. In these experiments the reduced thylakoids and antiserum were incubated at 0°C for 30 min and centrifuged, and the thylakoids were resuspended and used for unisite ATPase assay. Other conditions would have to be tested to see if greater inhibition might be possible. We were surprised to find that unisite ATPase of thylakoids was inhibited strongly by uncouplers, including gramicidin (Fig. 2), nigericin, and NH4Cl (Table 1). The highest inhibition (87%) was exerted by the combination of 0.5 μM gramicidin and 2 mM NH4Cl. Valinomycin, an ionophore for K+ or ammonium ions, also inhibited the thylakoid unisite ATPase, but less effectively than others (Table 1). These results indicated a major part of unisite ATPase thylakoids requires a proton-motive force. A smaller proportion (about 20%) is active without that help. As expected, soluble CF1 unisite activity was not affected by uncouplers (data not shown).Tabled 1 Since it is known that CF1 activation occurs with a relatively low pmf(23Quick W.P. Mills J.D.

Accordingly the same experiments were carried out in very dim light (<2 μE/m2•s); and indeed, control rates were much lower, and the uncoupler effect disappeared (Fig. 2). Azide inhibits multisite ATPase of mitochondrial F1, but not unisite ATPase(6Harris D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 974: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, azide inhibits thylakoid unisite ATPase, 50% at 1 mM (Fig. 3). Since azide has no effect on photophosphorylation, we cannot ascribe this inhibition to any uncoupling effect. The effective concentration is in the same range, 0.2-2 mM, as reported by others (6Harris D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 974: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 8Harris D.A. Boork J. Baltscheffsky M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3876-3883Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 25Wei J-M. Howlett B. Jagendorf A.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 934: 72-79Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) for multisite ATPase and is not another manifestation of the ionic strength effect (see below). Unlike the case for thylakoid multisite ATPase (25Wei J-M. Howlett B. Jagendorf A.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 934: 72-79Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) this azide inhibition was not reversed by sulfite (data not shown). It was shown previously that azide inhibits by enhancing the binding of inhibitory MgADP (26Murataliev M.B. Milgrom Y.M. Boyer P.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8305-8310Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 27Minkov I.B. Strotmann H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 973: 7-12Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) to one of the three catalytic sites in isolated thylakoids. To obtain ADP-depleted membrane-bound ATPase, thylakoids were diluted in the light and washed extensively with EDTA at high ionic strength right after illumination, as described by others (4Fromme P. Gräber P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1016: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18Wintermans J.F.G.M. De Mots A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 109: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Measurements of bound adenylates showed a drop from 1.70 down to 0.76 nmol of bound ADP per nmol of CF1; and a drop of ATP from 1.77 to 0.95 nmol/nmol of CF1. The depleted thylakoids showed almost no azide inhibition of unisite ATPase (Fig. 3). In our previous studies, we found that venturicidin can specifically inhibit thylakoid ATPase by blocking proton pumping through CF0(17Zhang S. Jagendorf A.T. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Under unisite conditions, a maximum of 30-40% inhibition was observed in a number of experiments. Much to our surprise, sulfite, which greatly stimulates steady state ATP hydrolysis by reduced thylakoids(29Larson E.M. Jagendorf A.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 973: 67-77Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar), inhibited unisite ATP hydrolysis by thylakoids (Fig. 4A), up to 84% at 50 mM. To determine whether the inhibition was a side effect, due perhaps to high salt or osmotic strength, we titrated sulfite and sorbitol side by side, along with some other salts (Fig. 4A). It is evident that sulfite inhibition of the unisite hydrolytic activity is shared by other salts and is not unique. Since anions with higher negative charges (sulfite, sulfate) have a stronger effect than those with a single charge (chloride), the inhibition is due to the anions rather than to a general ionic strength effect. For instance, 50% inhibition was obtained with 5 mM sodium sulfite, but 40 mMNaCl was required (Fig. 4A). Unlike multisite ATPase, the unisite ATPase responses to sulfite and sulfate are indistinguishable. As these were all salts with Na+ as the cation, it strengthens the idea that the anions are inhibitory. The failure of sorbitol to inhibit even at high concentrations shows that this is not an osmotic strength effect. We conducted similar experiments with purified soluble CF1 (Fig. 4B). Only sulfite had an effect on the soluble enzyme activity, all other salts had no effect. As expected sulfite stimulated the soluble unisite activity, opposite to its effect on the thylakoid bound enzyme. The inhibitory effect of anions on thylakoid unisite ATPase can be observed only when the reaction medium contains mM levels of free Mg2+ (Fig. 5) and the assays are conducted in room light. Without Mg2+ in the assay medium, or if the assay is performed in very dim light (<2 μE/m2•s), the rates are much lower (see below), and added NaCl or Na2SO3 have either no effect or are slightly stimulatory. Inorganic phosphate stimulates soluble MF1(14Penefsky H.S. Grubmeyer C. Papa S. Altendorf K. Ernster L. Packer L. H+-ATPase (ATP Synthase): Structure, Function, Bioenergenesis of the F F Complex of Coupling Membranes. ISCU Press, 1984: 195-204Google Scholar), but inhibits EF1 unisite ATPase(6Harris D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 974: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Bullough D.A. Allison W.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1058: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). With thylakoid unisite ATPase, less than 1 mM phosphate enhanced the unisite ATPase activity, but inhibited at concentrations above 1 mM (not shown). However, the stimulatory effect of phosphate was found to be due to the formation of ATP under room light (10-20 μE/m2•s), presumably from the tightly bound ADP, thereby raising the net ATP concentration. The inhibitory effect of phosphate is probably due to the same anion inhibition found with other salts. With soluble CF1, a slight stimulatory effect was also observed under unisite conditions, but much less than that of sulfite (data not shown). When inhibition by added salts was found, as in Fig. 4 and other experiments, 5 mM MgCl2 was already present. Because of the unexpected anion inhibition of unisite catalysis of thylakoid ATPase, it was of interest to test for effects of cations. In a medium virtually lacking salts, the unisite activity was very low. Increasing concentrations of Mg2+, Ca2+, and Na+ salts up to 5 mM stimulated the low hydrolytic activity to some extent (Fig. 6A). The extent of stimulation varied depending on the cation used, with Mg2+ being the most effective. For instance, 5 mM Mg2+ stimulated the enzyme activity more than 4-fold, whereas only about 3- and 2-fold stimulations were observed with Ca2+ or Na+ at the same concentrations (NaCl stimulation was observed only when there was no MgCl2 in the reaction medium). At higher concentrations, however, all the salts showed some inhibitory effect, probably due to the anion inhibition becoming dominant. More surprisingly, a similar cation effect was also found with soluble CF1 unisite ATPase (Fig. 6B), except that here Ca2+ was more effective than Mg2+, in contrast to the thylakoid-bound enzyme. For instance, Mg2+ was optimal at 5 mM, giving a 2-fold stimulation; but with Ca2+, a 7-fold stimulation was observed at 10 mM. Treating thylakoid membranes with trypsin led to higher multisite ATPase activity(30Moroney J.V. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5915-5920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but nothing was known about the effect of this treatment on unisite ATPase. We found that trypsin only inhibits unisite ATPase, ranging from 24% inhibition with a ratio of trypsin to chlorophyll of 1:20, to 76% inhibition at a ratio of 1:5 (data not shown). We could think of two possibilities to explain this result. The first is that trypsin digestion might destroy the high affinity site, as the result of cleaving the α and/or β subunits(30Moroney J.V. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5915-5920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Moroney J.V. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5910-5914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If so, soluble CF1 should also have been inhibited. However, trypsin digestion increased soluble unisite activity only to some extent (data not shown). Thus it is not likely that inhibition of thylakoid unisite ATPase by trypsin is due to a loss of one or the other of the large subunits. The second possibility, which is accordingly more likely, is that the slight uncoupling effect of trypsin treatment (30Moroney J.V. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5915-5920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) might cause the inhibition. For MF1(6Harris D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 974: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and E. coli F1(7Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 878-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the pH profiles of unisite catalysis were found to be completely different from that of multisite. However, the pH response of thylakoid unisite ATPase (Fig. 7) was very close to that of multisite, showing sensitivity to both high (pH >9.0) and low pH (pH <7.5). But some differences still exist. These include the optimal pH, which is 8.0 for unisite and 8.5 for multisite; and inhibitions at a high pH, where unisite is more sensitive than multisite. Interestingly, very similar pH profiles were also observed with soluble CF1 ATPase (data not shown). Thus the differences between thylakoid unisite ATPase and other F-type ATPases in the pH profiles are probably not due to the thylakoid membranes, but rather to the reactivity of CF1 itself. In dim light (<2 μE/m2•s) sulfite actually stimulated unisite ATPase about 2-fold at 10 mM (Fig. 8), unlike its effect in room light. This was the same with or without uncoupler present (data not shown). However, at higher concentrations (>10 mM), sulfite does not stimulate dim light ATPase, rather slightly inhibits it. Similar results were also obtained with trypsin-treated thylakoids. In dim light, sulfite stimulated the trypsin-cleaved thylakoid unisite ATPase activity (Fig. 8), with an optimal concentration at 20 mM, increasing the rate 3-fold. However, further increasing sulfite concentrations again resulted in some inhibition. Cys-89 is not accessible in the inactive form of thylakoid ATPase, but becomes accessible upon membrane energization (32Nalin C.M. Beliveau R. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3376-3381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both Nalin et al.(32Nalin C.M. Beliveau R. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3376-3381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Cohen (33Cohen W.S. Plant Physiol. 1989; 91: 1107-1111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that modification of this cysteine residue by MalNEt inhibits both ATP synthase and ATPase activities (multisite). More recently, however, it was found that alkylation of Cys-89 stimulates the rates of nucleotide exchange. 2R. E. McCarty, personal communication. To test the effect of this modification on unisite activity, we treated thylakoids with MalNEt in the light without DTT reduction (to ensure the modification did not occur on the SH groups of the reduced disulfide bond). ATPase of the treated thylakoids was assayed under both unisite and multisite conditions (Table 2). Alkylation of Cys-89 by MalNEt inhibited the unisite ATPase only 10%, but inhibited the multisite activity 90%. This suggests a function of Cys-89 in modulating the interactions between different catalytic sites.Tabled 1 Data presented in this report demonstrate differences between the unisite and multisite activities of thylakoid ATPase and between chloroplast F1 and mitochondrial or E. coli F1- ATPases. These results could be useful for further understanding the molecular mechanism of the enzyme. First, we wanted to make sure that the very low levels of ATP hydrolysis are due to CF0CF1. The dependence of unisite activity on prior reduction of the thylakoids by DTT in the light, loss of activity when thylakoids are depleted of CF1 by EDTA treatment at low ionic strength, and partial inhibition due to an antiserum against CF1 are all characteristics shared by normal thylakoid multisite ATPase. It is highly improbable that another enzyme could be responsive to these same inputs. The rates of unisite ATPase we observed in room light were comparable to those obtained in a similar study by Fromme and Gräber(16Fromme P. Gräber P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 187-194Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar), despite the differences in experimental conditions. They used either light or an acid/base jump to reactivate the reduced thylakoid enzyme before each assay, without comment on any activity in the absence of this activation. They also used a high concentration of uncoupler (3-6 mM NH4Cl) in the assay medium after reactivating the enzyme(16Fromme P. Gräber P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 187-194Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 34Labahn A. Graber P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1141: 288-296Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Our finding of inhibition of unisite catalysis by uncouplers in room light but not in dim light indicates a requirement for a small proton-motive force for all but a small fraction of the unisite activity (Fig. 2, Table 1). This could not have been due to carryover of some pmf from the previous reductive activation, especially because uncoupler inhibition was found to the same extent when the thylakoids had been reduced by incubating with DTT in the dark, without PMS. Generation of a pmf under room light (<25 μE/m2•s) and with no added electron-carrying dye initially seemed unlikely. However, a very low pH gradient, perhaps only 2.0 units, is sufficient to activate CF1(23Quick W.P. Mills J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 851: 166-172Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 24Kramer D.M. Wise R.R. Frederick J.R. Alm D.M. Hesketh J.D. Ort D.R. Crofts A.R. Photosynth. Res. 1990; 26: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). With either 9-aminoacridine or neutral red as indicators, we did observe a thylakoid pmf forming due to these low light intensities and without added redox dyes. 3W. R. Zipfel and S. Zhang, unpublished results. The pattern of electron flow, in the absence of added redox dyes, that can operate at this low light level has not been defined. Preliminary experiments with inhibitors (dichlorophenyl dimethylurea for PSII; high levels of KCN for plastocyanin and PSI) seem to indicate involvement of only PSI; but further work is needed for a better definition. It was surprising to see that thylakoid unisite ATPase (Fig. 3) and that of soluble CF1 are partially inhibited by azide (Fig. 3). Both MF1 and EF1 unisite activities, and even that of soluble CF1 Ca2+-dependent ATPase (9Androlajc P.J. Harris D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1016: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), are not inhibited by azide(6Harris D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 974: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 10Noumi T. Maeda M. Futai M. FEBS Lett. 1987; 213: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The azide inhibition of thylakoids (26Murataliev M.B. Milgrom Y.M. Boyer P.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8305-8310Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 35Murataliev M.B. Boyer P.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) as with other systems, is considered to be due to tightening the binding of inhibitory MgADP to one of the adenylate binding sites. Thereby it interferes with site-site interactions and causes inhibition of steady state ATP hydrolysis. This is likely to be the case with thylakoid unisite activity also, since azide did not inhibit thylakoids which had been partially depleted of bound ADP. Either the unisite binding and hydrolysis occurs at the site of tight ADP binding, or ATP hydrolysis at only one site is still subject to allosteric control by the tightly bound ADP. Either way, any means of loosening or releasing the bound ADP would stimulate unisite activity. As observed with MF1(28Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1539-1545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), venturicidin only partially inhibits thylakoid unisite ATPase. Matsuno-Yagi and Hatefi (28Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1539-1545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that venturicidin binding to the F0 sector freezes its structure, but does not block the proton channel. Since under unisite conditions only one set of protons is expected to move through any one channel, a slow translocation rate would be sufficient to support the very slow ATP hydrolysis. The effects of salts on thylakoid unisite catalysis include stimulation at low concentrations (0-5 mM) and inhibition at higher levels. The inhibition is a nonspecific anion effect (Fig. 4A) and is not found with either unisite activity of soluble CF1 (Fig. 4B) or thylakoid multsite ATPase. Since it does not occur in dim light, the salts may be interfering with either the unknown electron flow path or in some other way with generation of a pmf. While the cause is not known, the phenomenon explains why the usually strong potentiation by sulfite cannot be observed at these substrate levels. Part of the stimulation by low levels of salts may represent a modification of thylakoid structure. While the divalent cations Ca2+ and Mg2+ are most effective, even Na+ (Fig. 6A) and Tricine (data not shown) have some effect. It was found much earlier (36Izawa S. Good N. Plant Physiol. 1966; 41: 533-543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Izawa S. Good N. Plant Physiol. 1966; 41: 544-552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that at very low salt concentrations the grana structure of thylakoids disappears; but it can be restored by adding salts, especially of divalent cations. However, the greater effectiveness of Mg2+, and especially the strong stimulation of soluble CF1 unisite ATPase by divalent cations, indicates a specific role in either catalysis or enzyme structure. This was quite unexpected; the usual concept is that the role of divalent cations is only to complex with the adenylate, forming the true substrate. In the present case the required Mg2+ concentration of 4 to 5 mM is over 5 orders of magnitude higher than the substrate concentration (0.015 μM). It is even more strange in that free Mg2+ is a mild inhibitor of thylakoid multisite ATPase, but a severe inhibitor for soluble CF1, with a Ki of 10 μM(38Vambutas V.K. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 2660-2667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Hochman Y. Lanir A. Carmeli C. FEBS Lett. 1976; 61: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 40Posorske L. Jagendorf A.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 177: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Guerrero et al.(41Guerrero K.J. Xue Z. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16280-16287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that free Mg2+ inhibits ADP release from the tight binding site, thereby stabilizing an inactive form of CF1. However, its failure to inhibit the unisite activity seems at odds with that interpretation. It seems likely that, on binding to CF1, Mg2+ induces a conformational change in favor of unisite binding and hydrolysis of the substrate. A similar result was seen in MF1(42Milgrom Y.M. Murataliev M.B. FEBS Lett. 1987; 222: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) where Mg2+ stimulated both unisite catalysis and the rates of ADP and Pi release from the soluble enzyme. Alkylation of Cys-89 in the light had little effect on unisite, but knocked out most of the multisite activity (Table 2), suggesting another difference between the two types of catalysis. Alkylation of Cys-89 may abolish site-site interactions(43Soteropoulos P. Ong A.M. McCarty R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19810-19816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The minor component of unisite activity found in very dim light was not inhibited by salts and (probably for that technical reason) could show some stimulation by sulfite. Sulfite also stimulates rather strongly the unisite activity of soluble CF1. In both cases, its action presumably has to do with permitting release of the tightly bound, inhibitory MgADP, as in multisite ATPase(41Guerrero K.J. Xue Z. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16280-16287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Larson E.M. Umbach A. Jagendorf A.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 973: 78-85Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus once again, with CF1 some site-site interactions, or at the least an allosteric effect of ADP at an alternative site, are found under unisite catalytic conditions. Trypsin inhibition of thylakoid unisite ATPase contrasts with the known stimulation of multisite ATPase and also with its stimulation of the unisite activity by soluble CF1 (data not shown). This inhibition is therefore most probably attributed to its weak uncoupling of thylakoids(30Moroney J.V. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5915-5920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Moroney J.V. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5910-5914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), since unisite catalysis cannot renew the pmf during the reaction. In conclusion, thylakoid unisite ATPase can be assayed under room light. Based on so many differences from multisite ATPase, it seems that the high affinity site is either a unique catalytic site or is one of the usual ones with very different characteristics, because of the very low ATP levels. We are grateful for helpful discussions with W. R. Zipfel, R. E. McCarty, and P. Hinkle."
https://openalex.org/W2156019387,"Cytotoxic anti-cancer drugs are meant to interact with tumor cells to impair the replicative and/or transcriptional functions of DNA in order to reduce proliferative rate and cause cell death. These drugs also affect rapidly proliferating healthy tissues such as the bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract, thereby resulting in toxicity-related dose reductions and/or delays in treatment. We previously demonstrated a circadian rhythm in DNA synthesis (S-phase) of total bone marrow (BM) nucleated cells in 16 healthy, diurnally active men sampled every 4 h for 24 h (19 series). Highest values determined by flow cytometry were found near midday. We also reported a circadian rhythm in DNA synthesis of the rectal mucosa (RM) in 16 healthy men sampled every 2-3 h for 24 h under fed and fasting conditions (24 series). Highest proliferative activity as reflected by in vitro [3H]Tdr uptake, was found near the time of awakening. Circannual (about yearly) rhythmicity in cell division rates may also influence treatment effects. Our BM and RM DNA data, which were collected over several years, were reanalyzed for seasonality by ANOVA and for circannual rhythm by the least-squares fit of a 1 year cosine. Characteristics of circadian amplitudes and acrophases were also compared between seasons. In addition to a significant circadian rhythm, a significant circannual rhythm in cell proliferation in healthy BM (P = 0.008) and RM (P < 0.001) could be established on the basis of these serially independent data. The range between the lowest and highest points of the fitted 1 year cosine (circannual double amplitude) was comparable to the circadian range for BM (25%); it was at least doubled for RM (70%). Highest values occurred in the late summer for BM and mid-fall for RM. Based on limited data in some seasons, the circadian patterns were more prominent in the fall and winter, with larger amplitudes and later acrophases, when compared with summer for BM and spring and summer for RM. Thus, in addition to time of day, time of year may influence chemo- and immunotherapeutic strategies and should be considered in the design of preclinical and clinical treatment regimens and other procedures."

The other remarkable regulatory aspect of these enzyme is the unidirectional activation of dAK, which in its unactivated state has only about one-fifth the activity of its associated dCK or dGK. However, when dCyd or dGuo, or their triphosphate homologs, occupy the respective dCK or dGK subunits, the turnover on dAK is increased up to 6-fold. (Curiously, dAdo or dATP exert very little stimulatory effect on dCK or dGK, in the opposite direction.) This effect is purely a turnover phenomenon; the Km values for dAdo are unchanged by dCyd or dGuo(6Deibel Jr., M.R. Reznik R.B. Ives D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8240-8244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Chakravarty R. Ikeda S. Ives D.H. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6235-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that this heterotropic activation of dAK is due to conformational changes, analogous to the classical taut-to-relaxed inter-conversion, induced upon the respective binding of dCyd or dGuo (or their triphosphates) to the dCK or dGK active site (4Ikeda S. Ma G.T. Ives D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5328-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 8Ikeda S. Ives D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13373-13381Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Under these circumstances, the dAK of either dimer becomes more susceptible to limited protolysis, presumably by toggling into an open or relaxed state, whereas selective proteolytic inactivation of dGK abolished this effect(4Ikeda S. Ma G.T. Ives D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5328-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In a related experiment, photoaffinity labeling of the dGK active site with 8-azidoadenine permanently locks dAK into an activated configuration, again revealing conformational communication between the two subunits of the heterodimer(8Ikeda S. Ives D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13373-13381Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). It is of great interest to identify the structural basis for these unusual regulatory phenomena as well as the sequences contributing to the enzymes' active sites. Scanning for homology with structural elements shown to be related to function in other kinases reveals that dGK/dAK contains the glycine- and arginine-rich motifs associated with the ATP- or GTP-binding sites of many nucleotide-binding proteins (9Ikeda S. Swenson R.P. Ives D.H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8648-8652Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 10Fry D.C. Kuby S.A. Mildvan A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 907-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) and which are also highly conserved in the adenylate kinases (11Tsai M.-D. Yan H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6806-6818Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and herpesviral thymidine kinases (HSV sites 1 and 5)(12Balasubramaniam N.K. Veerisetty V. Gentry G.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 2979-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 13Gentry G.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1992; 54: 319-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Another small conserved motif, -DRH- (HSV-TK site 3), found between the G-loops and the arginine-rich regions of herpesviral thymidine kinases(12Balasubramaniam N.K. Veerisetty V. Gentry G.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 2979-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), may be analogous to the similarly located DRS motif of dGK/dAK. Mutations 4-12 residues further on the HSV-1 TK map (around HSV-TK site 4) produced increased Km values for thymidine, leading Darby et al.(14Darby G. Larder B.A. Inglis M.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1986; 67: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) to suggest the region may be part of a thymidine-binding site. Random oligonucleotide mutagenesis leading to the replacement of a number of residues in the intervening region between sites 3 and 4 has also produced mutants with both increased and decreased Km and kcat values for thymidine(15Munir K.M. French D.C. Dube D.K. Loeb L.A. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), whereas a double amino acid substitution within this region of varicella-zoster TK (which is partially conserved relative to HSV TKs) resulted in reduced thymidine and thymidylate kinase activities and larger dissociation constants for these and analogous substrates(16Suzutani T. Davies L.C. Honess R.W. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 1011-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Significantly, random mutagenesis of HSV-1 TK produced no active enzymes with modifications within the DRH motif, an indication of its possible importance, and site-directed mutagenesis of the corresponding Asp-162 completely inactivated the enzyme(17Black M.E. Loeb L.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11618-11626Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), making it difficult to say whether the mutation affected substrate binding or turnover, or if it produced global disruption of structure. But, the essential character of Asp-162 and its proximity to site 4 would make it seem likely that sites 3 and 4 are both part of a larger nucleoside-binding or recognition domain for HSV-TKs. The homology between the DRS motif of dGK/dAK and the DRH of HSV-TKs, although very limited in size, suggested the possible importance of these residues in some aspect of nucleoside binding and/or catalysis in Lactobacillus dGK/dAK. Furthermore, since the regulatory events described appear to be mediated through deoxynucleoside sites, it seemed more desirable to probe potential deoxynucleoside sites initially, rather than the recognizable ATP-binding elements. 2′-Deoxyadenosine and 2′-deoxyguanosine were purchased from Sigma; 2′-[2,8-3H]deoxyadenosine and 2′-[8-3H]deoxyguanosine were from Moravek Biochemicals, Inc. Deoxyadenosine 5′-[α-35S]thiotriphosphate was provided by Amersham Corp. Bradford reagent and reagents for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were obtained from Bio-Rad. Escherichia coli XL1-Blue was from Stratagene. The Sequenase version 2 kit was purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp., and all other materials, including protocols, cell lines, and enzymes for the site-directed mutagenesis, were from a Muta-GeneΓ phagemid in vitro mutagenesis version 2 kit, which was purchased from Bio-Rad. Electroporation was done in a Gene Pulser from Bio-Rad, using 0.4-cm cuvettes. Deoxynucleoside kinase activities were assayed using DE-81 ion exchange paper by the method of Ives (18Ives D.H. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 416-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) with minor modifications as follows. In the standard assay, the final concentration of each reagent in the reaction mixture (in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube) was: ATP, 10 mM; MgCl2, 12 mM; Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 M; [3H]dAdo (for dAK), [3H]dGuo (for dGK), 0.2 mM (0.5 μCi/assay), respectively. The reactions were started by adding 20 μl of enzyme diluted in 15 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 20% (v/v) glycerol to the warmed reaction mixture tube (final volume, 80 μl). After 30 min of incubation at 20°C, 0.2 ml of 0.1 M formic acid was added to stop the reaction. Aliquots (20 μl) of the mixture were spotted on Whatman DE-81 anion exchange papers for the measurement of radioactivity(18Ives D.H. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 416-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of enzyme solutions was determined by the method of Bradford(19Cretton E.M. Xie M.-Y. Goudgaon N.M. Schinazi R.F. Chu C.K. Sommadossi J.-P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Specific enzyme activity is defined as the nanomoles of product per min per mg of protein. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was as described by Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206999) Google Scholar). E. coli XL1-Blue cells containing mutants of the recombinant pBlueScript KS(+) clone GTM-K48 were cultured in LB liquid medium, containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, for expression of enzyme. Since the cloned genes are activated by an endogenous promotor, it was not necessary to add isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside for the stimulation of protein expression. The cell pellets were washed in ice-cold cell suspension buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol) and used immediately or stored at −20°C for later use. The washed cell pellets were suspended in cell suspension buffer, broken by ultrasonication, and centrifuged at 13,500 × g for 1 h at 4°C. Fraction IV enzyme(21Deibel Jr., M.R. Ives D.H. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), prepared with only minor modifications yielded reproducible linear kinetics. The materials and protocols of the Muta-Gene phagemid in vitro site-directed mutagenesis kit (version 2) from Bio-Rad was used. Mutagenic oligodeoxynucleotides synthesized in the Biochemical Instrument Center of The Ohio State University were unblocked at 58°C for 24 h, dried completely under N2 gas, and purified with a Qiagen column (tip-20) by the manufacturer's protocol. Pure oligomers were dried in air, dissolved in 1 ml of 10 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.0, and stored at −20°C until use. The quality of each oligomer was checked by 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 5′ end of each mutagenic oligomer was phosphorylated with polynucleotide kinase to improve the frequencies of mutagenesis. After the polymerization/ligation reaction was continued for 90 min at 37°C, the reaction was stopped by adding Tris-EDTA buffer. Closed-circular heteroduplex recombinant pBlueScript KS(+) was extracted from agarose electrophoresis gel and used in the transformation of E. coli XL1-Blue by electroporation in a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transformants were grown on LB plates containing ampicillin, and each instance of mutagenesis was confirmed by DNA sequencing, using the dideoxynucleotide termination method(22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52605) Google Scholar). Limiting Km values for deoxynucleoside substrates and MgATP were determined by steady state kinetics, varying both nucleoside and ATP concentrations. Slope and intercept replots yielded the limiting Km and Vmax values(23Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975: 273-329Google Scholar). When ATP concentrations were varied, the concentrations of Mg2+ in the reaction mixtures were kept at 120% of the corresponding ATP concentrations. Dissociation constants for the dNTP end product inhibitors were estimated by means of Dixon plots that were constructed by replotting reciprocal velocities, measured at several substrate concentrations in the presence of several concentrations of inhibitor, versus inhibitor concentration. The -DRS- motif or its conservatively substituted analog has been implicated as part of the deoxynucleoside site in the HSV TKs. Its presence in Lactobacillus dGK/dAK and its location at the N-terminal boundary of a consensus sequence (D/E-R-S-I/V-X-D) shared with mammalian deoxycytidine kinases (24Ma G.T. Hong Y.S. Ives D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 270: 6595-6601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 25Chottiner E.G. Shewach D.S. Datta N.S. Ashcraft E. Gribbin D. Ginsburg D. Fox I.H. Mitchell B.S.

Chem. 1990; 265: 20172-20178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) makes it an attractive initial target in the search for the deoxynucleoside active site. We began by examining the functional significance of the first two charged residues, Asp-78 and Arg-79, on both the dAK and dGK peptides, by means of site-directed mutagenesis using the Kunkel (27Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4897) Google Scholar) method. Eight different mutagenic oligomers were synthesized and are shown in Table 1. Aspartate 78 of both subunits was replaced with glutamate, a supposedly conservative replacement except for the longer side chain, with asparagine to eliminate the negative charge and with alanine to minimize the volume occupied by the side chain. Since the target amino acids may be located in the inner pocket, bulky substituents more likely to cause global disruption of the tertiary structure were avoided. At the Arg-79 residue substitution with lysine only was performed, providing a single positively charged center with a smaller side chain. However, two types of mutants were constructed; one bears the R79K mutation on both the dAK and dGK subunits, while the other has the R79K mutation on the dGK subunit only (R79K:dGK). As it is not yet clear whether the dAK subunit is processed in E. coli host like the wild-type Lactobacillus enzyme(24Ma G.T. Hong Y.S. Ives D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 270: 6595-6601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the product of the unmutated parental gene will be referred to as UMCE (unmodified cloned enzyme) in this report.Tabled 1 Both UMCE and mutant Lactobacillus enzymes were expressed in E. coli at levels amounting to at least 3% of the total soluble protein in crude cell extracts, judging from the intensities of the 27-kDa bands resolved by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1). The quantities of dAK/dGK peptides expressed by UMCE and mutants apparently are identical, and they remain unchanged after 16 h of incubation with good aeration at 37°C, which suggests that there is no specific or selective degradation of the expressed foreign proteins by E. coli proteases. The sizes of all of the expressed dAK and dGK peptides appear to be identical at about 27 kDa, in close agreement with the wild-type L. acidophilus R26 dAK/dGK peptides(4Ikeda S. Ma G.T. Ives D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5328-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Crude extracts of all mutants were screened for activity by the standard assay. After partial purification of the expressed cloned enzyme activities, the relative quantities and molecular sizes were unchanged. All three types of Asp-78 mutations (D78A, D78E, and D78N, involving both subunits) virtually eliminated both dAK and dGK activities, being less than 0.2% of the activities found in comparable UMCE fractions. As the activities of these mutants were deemed to be too low for reliable kinetics, further analysis was not attempted. While it is quite likely that Asp-78 is directly essential for the activities of each subunits, indirect effects such as disruption of folding cannot yet be ruled out as an explanation for the loss of activities. Charge-conservative mutations at Arg-79, on the other hand, had a much more remarkable effect. While preliminary assays (not shown) revealed a reduction in the dGK activities of both the R79K and R79K:dGK mutants, the dAK activities were increased dramatically, whether or not the dAK subunit was altered. However, there was no apparent increase in the amount of peptide expressed. Preliminary enzyme activation and inhibition studies were carried out to determine whether these regulatory mechanisms might have been altered by R79K mutations. While both mutant enzymes remain susceptible to inhibition by end products dGTP or dATP, activation of dAK by dGuo is nearly eliminated in the case of the R79K:dGK mutant, while for the tandemly mutated R79K, there was even a 30% inhibition of the dAK activity upon addition of dGuo. In the opposite direction, dAdo produces, at most, a 10% stimulation of UMCE dGK, and this small stimulation is replaced by a comparable inhibition of the R79K:dGK mutant. Effects of Arg-79 Mutations on Steady State Kinetics-Because mutations at or near the active site of an enzyme may alter its Km values, or even its kinetic mechanism, it is necessary to compare limiting Km and Vmax values (i.e. extrapolating to saturation by both substrates rather than the apparent values obtained by varying only one substrate) lest variable second-substrate saturation produces apparent differences in reaction velocities. Therefore, these parameters were determined for UMCE and each of the Arg-79 mutants by steady-state kinetics in which both deoxynucleoside and MgATP concentrations were varied (Table 2). The limiting Km for dAdo was increased severalfold in the tandem mutant (7.5 μM in R79K) but was unchanged by the dGK-only mutation. A greater effect is seen upon the binding of dGuo, with the Km for dGuo increasing about an order of magnitude on both the single and tandem mutants.Tabled 1 An interesting contrast in the effect of mutation on the Km values for MgATP occurs between the two subunits. Whereas both the single and tandem mutations resulted in decreased Km values for MgATP on the dAK subunit, i.e. whether or not the dAK subunit was altered, the Km for MgATP on dGK was doubled for both mutants. No change was produced in the Km for MgATP on dAK upon the binding of dGuo to dGK of UMCE (data not shown). The other striking effect of mutations at Arg-79 is seen upon comparison of true maximum velocities which are proportional to the turnover number (Table 2). The turnover of dAK was increased 8-fold by the tandem R79K mutation and nearly 30-fold above that of UMCE by the R79K:dGK mutation, respectively. Under Vmax conditions these stimulatory affects cannot be explained in terms of any alteration of substrate binding at the dAK active site, whereas the relatively large changes in the Km values of both substrates for the dGK signal significant conformational changes at the dGK active site which may be capable of altering the “tautness” of the dAK subunit, like the positive heterotropic effector dGuo, but greater in magnitude. This is believed to be analogous to the somewhat smaller stimulatory effects on dAK activity which were detected following chemical modifications of the dGK active site(8Ikeda S. Ives D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13373-13381Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The accompanying loss of stimulation by dGuo is certainly consistent with the notion that the dAK subunit was already locked into a much more active conformation by the mutation on the dGK subunit. The other conclusion which can be inferred from these data is that, in terms of the Vmax/Km“efficiency ratios,” the R29K mutations can be said to have had opposite effects on the activities of the two subunits. Whereas the efficiency of dAdo binding and turnover combined increased from 3- to 29-fold, that of dGuo was decreased 90% or more. Since limiting values, i.e. real Vmax values and Km values, make up these ratios, it is even more apparent that asymmetry exists between the two subunits, despite their identical sequences within the motif which was mutagenized. One other possibility remains to be examined: whether or not these mutations alter the kinetic mechanism of either subunit, which are known to differ in the wild-type dGK/dAK(5Ikeda S. Chakravarty R. Ives D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15836-15843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, might the ordered kinetic path followed by wild-type dAK be shifted to a random mechanism, e.g. possibly allowing for a faster off-rate? This does not appear to be the case, judging from the following observations. The first, possibly trivial, observation is that the mutations produced no qualitative changes in the steady-state kinetics patterns. For example, with the dAK of UMCE, plots of 1/V versus 1/MgATP at various fixed concentrations of dAdo, or of 1/V versus 1/[dAdo] at various fixed concentrations of MgATP, gave a family of straight-line plots converging at one point on the horizontal axis (results not shown). However, for the dGK component of UMCE, the plots of 1/V versus the reciprocal concentration of MgATP or dGuo, at various fixed concentrations of the other substrate, gave a family of straight lines intersecting in the upper left-hand quadrant. The Arg-79 replacement mutants yielded patterns qualitatively identical to those just described. Neither pattern, by itself, defines whether the sequential kinetics is ordered or random, of course, but the absence of any mutationally induced shift in the point of intersection of either pattern of lines, at least suggests that the mechanism is unchanged. Far more compelling evidence for unchanged kinetic mechanisms is provided by end product inhibition studies. Earlier work from this laboratory has established that with these enzymes, as well as with the dCyd kinase/dAdo kinase pair from L. acidophilus R26, the respective dNTP end products mimic the effects of multisubstrate analogs(5Ikeda S. Chakravarty R. Ives D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15836-15843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in the case of random substrate binding, the multisubstrate analog or the homologous dNTP should compete with either substrate for the free enzyme, while for an ordered kinetic path these compounds will compete only with the leading substrate. For the wild-type dGK, dGTP competes with both dGuo and MgATP, consistent with a random mechanism, while for dAK dATP competes only with MgATP, the leading substrate in an ordered path, but is noncompetitive toward dAdo (5Ikeda S. Chakravarty R. Ives D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15836-15843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Identical conclusions as to differing kinetic mechanisms for the two activities were drawn earlier from classical product-inhibition analyses. However, the end product inhibition experiments used in the present work are practically simpler than the classical product-inhibition experiments used to establish the kinetic mechanisms of the wild-type enzymes, but provide clear-cut results. Dixon plots (1/V versus [dNTP] at several substrate concentrations) were used in obtaining numerical values for the inhibitor dissociation constants(23Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975: 273-329Google Scholar). The Ki values for end product inhibition against each substrate were decreased up to 75% in dAK, but were increased about 2-fold in dGK by both the R79K and R79K:dGK mutations (Table 3). However, neither the dNTP inhibition pattern nor, therefore, the kinetic mechanism of either enzyme was affected by mutations at Arg-79; the kinetic path for dAK remains ordered, while that for dGK remains random. Therefore, mutation at Arg-79 affects only the substrate binding and turnover of the paired enzymes, not their kinetic mechanisms.Tabled 1 The heterodimeric deoxynucleoside kinases of Lactobacillus present an array of important fundamental questions relating to the control of DNA precursor biosynthesis. These include the mechanism of end product inhibition of each activity, the structural basis of the exquisite deoxynucleoside specificity exhibited by each catalytic subunit and the positive heterotropic stimulation of dAdo turnover by dCyd or dGuo, respectively. We elected to probe first the dGK/dAK DRS motifs, the conserved elements which by analogy with HSV TKs seemed likely to be associated with the deoxynucleoside sites. While we have no details yet of the dGK/dAK heterodimer's tertiary structure, a very preliminary prediction of the protein's secondary structure by the method of Chu and Fasman (28Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 251-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2336) Google Scholar) or Garnier, et al.(29Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3414) Google Scholar) suggests that the -DRS- motif may be at the turn of a loop. Therefore, if this local structure is involved in the binding of substrates or the stabilization of intermediates in the enzyme reaction, most substitutions should cause dramatic effects on enzyme activities. Accordingly, site-specific replacement of Asp-78 of both subunits with Glu, Asn, or Ala virtually abolished both the dGK and dAK activities of the mutants. From the standpoint of uncovering the subtleties of enzyme regulation by subunit interaction, a much more interesting site of mutagenesis is found at Arg-79 of the Lactobacillus enzyme upon charge-conservative replacements with Lys. Whereas the dGK activities of R79K and R79K:dGK were reduced substantially, the dAK activities of those mutant enzymes were elevated dramatically above that of UMCE. This phenomenon is thought to be analogous to the opposite-substrate activation effect reported previously with wild-type dCK/dAK and dGK/dAK (6Deibel Jr., M.R. Reznik R.B. Ives D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8240-8244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Chakravarty R. Ikeda S. Ives D.H. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6235-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) in which up to 6-fold stimulation of dAK activity occurs upon adding the opposite substrate, dCyd or dGuo, respectively, to the dAK reaction mixture. Arg-79-Lys mutations of the dGK subunit, either singly or in tandem with modification of the dAK subunit, essentially abolish this stimulation by dGuo, but, at the same time, produce an 8-28-fold increase in the Vmax of dAK. Affinity-labeling of the dGK active site with 8-azidoadenine produced a comparable, if smaller, effect(8Ikeda S. Ives D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13373-13381Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We may presume that these modifications at or near what appears to be part of the dGK active site induce a conformational change in the dGK subunit similar to that produced by dGuo binding, and which, in turn, toggles the dAK subunit into its activated conformation. The smaller 8-fold stimulation in the case of the tandem mutant is probably due to some offsetting reduction of efficiency of the dAK subunit upon its mutation. It is important to note, however, that for R79K:dGK the Km for dAdo is unchanged, whereas it increases severalfold in the R79K mutant where both subunits are altered. Stimulation by dGuo has been shown to be purely a Vmax effect, producing no change in the Km for dAdo(7Chakravarty R. Ikeda S. Ives D.H. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6235-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and the R79K:dGK mutation seems to have had an identical effect. Recent work on the wild-type dGK/dAK in this laboratory suggests that selective modification of the dGK subunit by photoaffinity labeling may also lock dAK into its activated configuration(8Ikeda S. Ives D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13373-13381Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), an effect which is mediated therefore through the dGK subunit. The R79K mutation has opposite effects on the Km values for MgATP at the two active sites, but lower Km values on dAK would not account for the stimulation as the assay is carried out under near-saturating conditions with respect to MgATP. Since these mutations are not within either of the putative ATP-binding domains of the protein, we tentatively assume that global folding or interactions between domains are affected. On dGK the Km for MgATP is already much larger than on dAK, and is doubled again by the Arg-79 mutation. It should be noted that, even for the wild-type enzyme, the Km for MgATP on the dGK subunit (1.7 mM) is an order larger than on dAK (0.11 mM). Although the conserved ATP-binding sites at the N termini are genetically identical, they do not appear to be processed alike after translation in either Lactobacillus or the E. coli host(24Ma G.T. Hong Y.S. Ives D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 270: 6595-6601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The evidence pointing to asymmetry between the tertiary and/or quaternary structures of the two subunits can be summarized as follows. (i) We note that they follow different kinetic pathways, one ordered and one random, and the activation of dAK by dGuo or by the R79K:dGK mutation does not alter this. However, the Ki for dATP is decreased by about the same extent as the Km for MgATP, the leading substrate in the ordered mechanism. This is consistent with the understanding that dATP behaves as a multisubstrate analog bridging the deoxynucleoside and ATP-phosphate sites. (ii) The one-way stimulation of the dAK activity by dGuo or dGTP, by affinity labeling of the dGK subunit (8Ikeda S. Ives D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13373-13381Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and by R79K mutagenesis also supports this notion. (iii) The opposite effects of R79K replacement on the binding of MgATP to the two subunits, despite similar sequences, also suggests differences in folding or contact points of the heterodimer. For example, the subunits could be arranged in a head-to-tail fashion, effectively burying one of the N termini. The detailed mechanism of the enhancement of dAK activity by R79K replacement is still unknown, but it seems most likely that Arg-79 is located near the contact area, possibly in a loop, between the dAK and dGK subunit, and the amino acid residues involved in the substrate binding site of one subunit might effect on the overall rate-limiting reaction steps of the paired subunit. Since the Km for dAdo is not changed by the mutation on dGK, turnover of dAK rather than substrate-binding is affected, and we may regard dGuo as a positive heterotropic effector of a rate-limiting step in dAK catalysis."
