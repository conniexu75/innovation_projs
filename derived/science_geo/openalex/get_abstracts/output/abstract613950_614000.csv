Essentially, dense-phase liquid droplets act like cellular compartments. Du and Chen show that DNA binding to its cytoplasmic sensor, cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS), results in liquid droplets containing activated cGAS (see the Perspective by Ablasser). This phenomenon occurs through multivalent interactions, augmented by zinc, between DNA binding domains on cGAS and DNA in a length-dependent manner. Binding triggers a switchlike reaction that concentrates the enzyme and reactants to enhance STING-dependent interferon responses. Science , this issue p. 704 ; see also p. 646"

Neurotransmitters are stored in small vesicles that are organized in clusters within nerve terminals. On stimulation, the vesicles fuse with the presynaptic plasma membrane, but despite their tight packing, replacement synaptic vesicles are rapidly recruited. Vesicles newly reformed by membrane recycling randomly intermix with the clusters. Milovanovic et al. show that synapsin, an abundant synaptic vesicle–associated protein, organizes these vesicle clusters by liquid-liquid phase separation—like oil in water (see the Perspective by Boczek and Alberti).

The YTH domain family proteins (YTHDF1–3 or Y1–3) bind to m6A-modified cellular mRNAs and modulate their metabolism and processing, thereby affecting cellular protein translation. We previously reported that HIV-1 RNA contains the m6A modification and that Y1–3 proteins inhibit HIV-1 infection by decreasing HIV-1 reverse transcription activity. Here, we investigated the mechanisms of Y1–3–mediated inhibition of HIV-1 infection in target cells and the effect of Y1–3 on viral production levels in virus-producing cells. We found that Y1–3 protein overexpression in HIV-1 target cells decreases viral genomic RNA (gRNA) levels and inhibits both early and late reverse transcription. Purified recombinant Y1–3 proteins preferentially bound to the m6A-modified 5′ leader sequence of gRNA compared with its unmodified RNA counterpart, consistent with the strong binding of Y1–3 proteins to HIV-1 gRNA in infected cells. HIV-1 mutants with two altered m6A modification sites in the 5′ leader sequence of gRNA exhibited significantly lower infectivity than WT, replication-competent HIV-1, confirming that these sites alter viral infection. HIV-1 produced from cells in which endogenous Y1, Y3, or Y1–3 proteins were knocked down singly or together had increased viral infectivity compared with HIV-1 produced in control cells. Interestingly, we found that Y1–3 proteins and HIV-1 Gag protein formed a complex with RNA in HIV-1–producing cells. Overall, these results indicate that Y1–3 proteins inhibit HIV-1 infection and provide new insights into the mechanisms by which the m6A modification of HIV-1 RNA affects viral replication.

Zhao B.S. Lu W. Lu Z. He C. Wu L. N(6)-Methyladenosine of HIV-1 RNA regulates viral infection and HIV-1 Gag protein expression.Elife. 2016; 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Our published study identified m6A modifications in the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs), as well as in the rev and gag genes of the HIV-1 genome (15Tirumuru N. Zhao B.S. Lu W. Lu Z. He C. Wu L. N(6)-Methyladenosine of HIV-1 RNA regulates viral infection and HIV-1 Gag protein expression.Elife. 2016; 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We previously reported that overexpression of Y1–3 proteins in cells inhibits HIV-1 infection by primarily decreasing HIV-1 reverse transcription, whereas knockdown of endogenous Y1–3 in Jurkat CD4+ T-cell line or primary CD4+ T-cells increases HIV-1 infection (15Tirumuru N. Zhao B.S. Lu W. Lu Z. He C. Wu L. N(6)-Methyladenosine of HIV-1 RNA regulates viral infection and HIV-1 Gag protein expression.Elife. 2016; 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanisms of Y1–3–mediated inhibition of HIV-1 infection remain unclear. Here, we report that Y1–3 inhibited HIV-1 infection in target cells by lowering incoming viral genome RNA (gRNA) levels and reverse transcription products. We demonstrate that the m6A-modified HIV-1 RNA fragment preferentially bound to Y1–3 proteins compared with an unmodified RNA counterpart, and mutations of two m6A sites in the 5′ UTR significantly decreased viral infectivity. Knockdown of endogenous Y1, Y3, or Y1–3 proteins together in virus-producing cells positively modulated HIV-1 infectivity. Furthermore, we found that endogenous Y1–3 proteins and HIV-1 Gag protein formed a complex with RNAs in HIV-1–producing cells. Together, these findings suggest new mechanisms by which Y1–3 proteins mediate HIV-1 inhibition during early steps of the viral life cycle. Our previous study showed that Y1–3 proteins negatively regulate HIV-1 post-entry infection in target cells, including primary CD4+ T-cells (15Tirumuru N. Zhao B.S. Lu W. Lu Z. He C. Wu L. N(6)-Methyladenosine of HIV-1 RNA regulates viral infection and HIV-1 Gag protein expression.Elife. 2016; 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To better understand the underlying mechanisms, we compared incoming HIV-1 gRNA levels and early and late reverse transcription (RT) products in stable HeLa cell lines overexpressing individual Y1–3 proteins or vector control after infection with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G)–pseudotyped single-cycle HIV-1 expressing firefly luciferase. Consistent with our previous results (15Tirumuru N. Zhao B.S. Lu W. Lu Z. He C. Wu L. N(6)-Methyladenosine of HIV-1 RNA regulates viral infection and HIV-1 Gag protein expression.Elife. 2016; 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), Y1–3 overexpression (Fig. 1A) resulted in significantly lower levels of HIV-1 post-entry infection (26, 8.6, and 23% in HeLa/Y1, HeLa/Y2, and HeLa/Y3 cells, respectively) compared with HeLa/vector control cells (set as 100%, Fig. 1B). To delineate at which stage of HIV-1 replication, post-entry, the YTHDF proteins might be acting on inhibition, we next examined whether Y1–3 proteins alter the levels of incoming HIV-1 gRNA at 1, 3, and 6 h post-infection (hpi). The levels of HIV-1 incoming gRNA were quantified using RT-qPCR (16Antonucci J.M. St Gelais C. de Silva S. Yount J.S. Tang C. Ji X. Shepard C. Xiong Y. Kim B. Wu L. SAMHD1-mediated HIV-1 restriction in cells does not involve ribonuclease activity.Nat. Med. 2016; 22 (27711056): 1072-107410.1038/nm.4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and were lower in HeLa/Y1–3 cells relative to those in HeLa/vector control cells. Incoming HIV-1 gRNA levels gradually declined after infection as expected (Fig. 1C). These results demonstrate that overexpression of Y1–3 proteins leads to reduced levels of incoming HIV-1 gRNA. After HIV-1 infection, the capsid core disassembles in the cytoplasm, and viral reverse transcriptase generates early and late RT products. Late RT products translocate into the nucleus and integrate into the host genome (17Dong C. Kwas C. Wu L. Transcriptional restriction of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gene expression in undifferentiated primary monocytes.J. Virol. 2009; 83 (19211771): 3518-352710.1128/JVI.02665-08Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our previous study showed that Y1–3 proteins inhibit accumulation of HIV-1 late RT products in infected cells (15Tirumuru N. Zhao B.S. Lu W. Lu Z. He C. Wu L. N(6)-Methyladenosine of HIV-1 RNA regulates viral infection and HIV-1 Gag protein expression.Elife. 2016; 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar); however, it is unclear whether Y1–3 proteins affect HIV-1 early RT efficiency. To address this question, HeLa/Y1–3 cells or HeLa/vector control cells infected by HIV-1–Luc/VSV-G were collected at 6, 12, and 24 hpi for quantification of HIV-1 early and late RT products by quantitative PCR (qPCR), as reported previously (18St Gelais C. Roger J. Wu L. Non-POU domain-containing octamer-binding protein negatively regulates HIV-1 infection in CD4(+) T cells.AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2015; 31 (25769457): 806-81610.1089/aid.2014.0313Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). At each time point, the levels of both early and late RT products were significantly lower in HeLa/Y1–3 cells compared with vector control cells (Fig. 1, D and E). At 24 hpi, the levels of early and late RT products in HeLa/Y1–3 cells decreased to 37–54%, whereas HIV-1 infection decreased to 8.6–26%, compared with vector control cells (set to 100% in Fig. 1, B, D, and E). Given that Y1–3 overexpression decreased incoming HIV-1 gRNA levels, and further decreased early and late RT products (Fig. 1, C–E), this suggests that Y1–3 proteins expressed in target cells act predominantly by decreasing incoming viral gRNA stability but also concomitantly decreasing downstream early and late RT product synthesis. Because the firefly luciferase mRNA contains consensus sequences for m6A modifications and our previous study used HIV-1–Luc/VSV-G virus containing a luciferase reporter gene (15Tirumuru N. Zhao B.S. Lu W. Lu Z. He C. Wu L. N(6)-Methyladenosine of HIV-1 RNA regulates viral infection and HIV-1 Gag protein expression.Elife. 2016; 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), it was possible that the HIV-1 inhibition we observed could be attributed to luciferase m6A modifications, as well as the inhibitory effects of Y1–3. Furthermore, the entry mechanisms of VSV-G–pseudotyped HIV-1 differ from fusion entry mediated by replication-competent WT HIV-1 through its CD4 receptor (19Wang J.H. Janas A.M. Olson W.J. KewalRamani V.N. Wu L. CD4 coexpression regulates DC-SIGN-mediated transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1.J.

Productive infection of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in dendritic cells requires fusion-mediated viral entry.Virology. 2008; 375 (18329684): 442-45110.1016/j.virol.2008.01.044Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and could impact the effect of Y1–3 proteins on downstream HIV-1 replication. To demonstrate the importance of Y1–3 proteins in inhibition of HIV-1 infection mediated through its natural fusion entry, we used WT, replication-competent HIV-1NL4-3 to infect HeLa cells overexpressing CD4 and individual Y1–3 proteins (HeLa/CD4/Y1–3) or vector control. Using flow cytometry, we confirmed that the majority of these cells were double-positive for the HIV-1 primary receptor CD4 and co-receptor CXCR4 (71–81%), which would allow efficient fusion-mediated viral entry (Fig. 2A). We further demonstrated that stable overexpression of individual Y1–3 proteins in HeLa/CD4 cells did not significantly affect cell proliferation during 72 h in culture (Fig. 2B). Immunoblotting also confirmed that HeLa/CD4/Y1–3 cells stably expressed FLAG-tagged individual Y1–3 proteins (Fig. 2C). To examine the effects of Y1–3 overexpression on WT HIV-1 replication, we measured cellular Gag protein and p24 release at 72 hpi. Consistent with the results from single-cycle HIV-1–Luc/VSV-G (Fig. 1B) (15Tirumuru N. Zhao B.S. Lu W. Lu Z. He C. Wu L. N(6)-Methyladenosine of HIV-1 RNA regulates viral infection and HIV-1 Gag protein expression.Elife. 2016; 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), Y1–3 overexpression efficiently inhibited infection of WT HIV-1NL4-3 as Gag (Pr55) protein levels in cells and p24 (capsid) levels in supernatants were significantly lower in HeLa/CD4/Y1–3 cells compared with vector control cells (Fig. 2, C and D). These results confirmed the inhibitory effects of Y1–3 proteins on HIV-1 infection and also suggested that potential m6A modification of the inserted luciferase gene in HIV-1–Luc/VSV-G does not contribute to Y1–3–mediated inhibition of HIV-1. Furthermore, infection of HeLa cells overexpressing Y1–3 proteins with WT HIV-1 also resulted in significantly lower early and late HIV-1 RT products (Fig. 2, E and F) and consequently reduced gag mRNA levels compared with vector control cells (Fig. 2G). These data suggest that Y1–3 proteins inhibit WT HIV-1NL4-3 infection before or during the RT stage. Our previous study showed that incoming gRNA from HIV-1–Luc/VSV-G binds to YTHDF proteins during early infection (15Tirumuru N. Zhao B.S. Lu W. Lu Z. He C. Wu L. N(6)-Methyladenosine of HIV-1 RNA regulates viral infection and HIV-1 Gag protein expression.Elife. 2016; 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To confirm that Y1–3 proteins bind to incoming HIV-1 gRNA in infected cells where entry was mediated through viral envelope and cellular receptor fusion, we performed immunoprecipitation (IP) of Y1–3 in HeLa/CD4/Y1–3 cell lines and vector control cells infected with WT HIV-1NL4-3 (Fig. 3A). To validate the specificity of Y1–3 binding to HIV-1 RNA, we also included an unrelated cellular protein MAL (MyD88 adapter-like, also known as Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adapter protein, or TIRAP) (21Fitzgerald K.A.

We then quantified the amounts of Y1–3–bound HIV-1 gRNA using RT-qPCR assays as reported previously (15Tirumuru N. Zhao B.S. Lu W. Lu Z. He C. Wu L. N(6)-Methyladenosine of HIV-1 RNA regulates viral infection and HIV-1 Gag protein expression.Elife. 2016; 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We observed that Y1–3 efficiently bound to incoming WT HIV-1 gRNA in HIV-1NL4-3–infected HeLa/CD4/Y1–3 cells compared with vector control or MAL-expressing cells (Fig. 3B). The levels of incoming HIV-1 gRNA bound to Y1 appeared higher than those bound to Y2 and Y3 (Fig. 3B), which could be due to the higher expression of Y1 in HeLa/CD4 cells relative to Y2 and Y3 proteins (Fig. 3A) and consequently a higher level of IP products (Fig. 3B). These data confirm that Y1–3 proteins bind to incoming WT HIV-1NL4-3 gRNA in infected cells.

N(6)-Methyladenosine of HIV-1 RNA regulates viral infection and HIV-1 Gag protein expression.Elife. 2016; 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Given the critical role of the 5′ UTR in initiation of HIV-1 reverse transcription (23Telesnitsky A. Wolin S.L. The host RNAs in retroviral particles.Viruses. 2016; 8 (27548206): E235Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), as well as additional roles in TAR-dependent transcriptional activation, dimerization, and packaging of the RNA genome (24Berkhout B. Multiple biological roles associated with the repeat (R) region of the HIV-1 RNA genome.Adv.

The GGACU motif is the most predominant sequence that undergoes m6A modification (25Wei C.M. Moss B. Nucleotide sequences at the N6-methyladenosine sites of HeLa cell messenger ribonucleic acid.Biochemistry. 1977; 16 (856255): 1672-167610.1021/bi00627a023Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 26Dominissini D.

The m6A peak detected by high-throughput RNA-sequencing in the 5′ UTR of HIV-1 gRNA harbors two GGACU motifs (15Tirumuru N. Zhao B.S. Lu W. Lu Z. He C. Wu L. N(6)-Methyladenosine of HIV-1 RNA regulates viral infection and HIV-1 Gag protein expression.Elife. 2016; 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The first motif is located in the primer-binding site (PBS), and the second is in a region upstream of the dimer initiation sequence (DIS) (Fig. 4A), and both are located proximal to the Y1–3 protein–binding peaks identified in the 5′ UTR of HIV-1 gRNA (15Tirumuru N. Zhao B.S. Lu W. Lu Z. He C. Wu L. N(6)-Methyladenosine of HIV-1 RNA regulates viral infection and HIV-1 Gag protein expression.Elife. 2016; 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To study the binding properties of Y1–3 proteins to HIV-1 RNA containing m6A modifications, we synthesized two RNA fragments corresponding to nucleotides 235–281 of HIV-1NL4-3 gRNA containing either m6A modification in the second GGACU motif located in the 5′ UTR or a control RNA without m6A modification (Fig. 4A). To eliminate RNA dimerization in our binding assays, the underlined DIS sequence (AAGCGCGC) was replaced with the nucleotides GAG (Fig. 4, A and B). We first used the AlphaScreen assay (27Kessl J.J. Kutluay S.B. Townsend D. Rebensburg S. Slaughter A. Larue R.C. Shkriabai N. Bakouche N. Fuchs J.R. Bieniasz P.D. Kvaratskhelia M.

Each Y1–3 protein exhibited clear preference for binding to m6A-modified HIV-1 RNA compared with the control RNA (Fig. 4C). We further investigated in vitro binding of the RNA fragments to Y1–3 protein using affinity pulldown experiments. Streptavidin-conjugated beads were used to pulldown biotin-modified control or m6A RNA fragments. Consistently, at lower Y1–3 concentrations (5 and 25 nm), clear preferences were observed for binding to m6A-modified HIV-1 RNA relative to control RNA, although both RNA fragments had detectable binding to Y1–3 proteins at 125 and 625 nm (Fig. 4D). The immunoblotting results of two independent pulldown experiments were quantified and normalized to 1, based on protein pulldown levels by m6A RNA fragment at 625 nm protein input (Fig. 4E). To compare affinity of RNA fragments to Y1–3 proteins, we calculated the concentrations of each Y1–3 protein (ranging from 1 to 625 nm) required for 50% pulldown levels based on the regression curves (Fig. 4, E and F). The 50% pulldown efficiencies indicated that Y1–3 proteins bound to m6A RNA fragment 7-, 13-, and >20-fold higher than control RNA, respectively (Fig. 4F). These results demonstrate that Y1–3 proteins exhibit substantially higher affinity for m6A-modified HIV-1 RNA in vitro, which may contribute to Y1–3–mediated inhibition of HIV-1 infection in cells. We previously identified enriched m6A modifications in the 5′ and 3′ UTRs of the HIV-1 genomic RNA. The 5′ UTR is critical for HIV-1 reverse transcription, genome packaging, and viral infectivity (23Telesnitsky A. Wolin S.L. The host RNAs in retroviral particles.Viruses. 2016; 8 (27548206): E235Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28Eckwahl M.J. Telesnitsky A. Wolin S.L. Host RNA packaging by retroviruses: a newly synthesized story.MBio. 2016; 7 (26861021): e02025-e02115Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and we demonstrated that m6A modifications in this region were important for Y1–3 binding to HIV-1 RNA and that overexpression of Y1–3 proteins reduces HIV-1 infection by inhibition of reverse transcription (15Tirumuru N. Zhao B.S. Lu W. Lu Z. He C. Wu L. N(6)-Methyladenosine of HIV-1 RNA regulates viral infection and HIV-1 Gag protein expression.Elife. 2016; 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We sought to focus on these m6A-modified regions on the HIV-1 genomic RNA. Thus, we next investigated the importance of these GGACU m6A sites for generation of HIV-1–infectious particles and infection of target cells. To eliminate m6A modification of the GGACU motifs in 5′ UTR of HIV-1 gRNA, A to G mutations were introduced in the first (Mut1), second (Mut2), or both GGACT motifs (Mut3) in the HIV-1 proviral DNA plasmid pNL4-3 (Fig. 5A). WT pNL4-3 and derived mutants (Mut1–3) were separately transfected into HEK293T cells to measure HIV-1 Gag expression, p24 release, and infectivity. Compared with WT HIV-1, these mutants expressed comparable levels of precursor Gag protein, but the levels of cleaved p24 and intermediate Gag products in cell lysates were 1.4–1.8-fold higher (Fig. 5, B and C). Consistent with this result, supernatant p24 levels of mutant viruses were 1.2–1.4-fold higher than that of WT HIV-1 (Fig. 5D), suggesting a potential effect of these mutations on Gag proteolytic processing or viral release. To compare the infectivity of the mutants with WT HIV-1, equal amounts of p24 equivalent viruses generated in HEK293T cells were used to infect TZM-bl indicator cells (29Derdeyn C.A. Decker J.M.

Interestingly, the infectivity of the mutant viruses was significantly lower (53–74%) relative to WT HIV-1 (Fig. 5E), suggesting an additional important role of these two GGACU motifs in regulating HIV-1 infectivity in target cells. Previously published m6A mapping results indicate that there are multiple m6A sites in different regions of HIV-1 gRNA, in addition to the 5′ UTR (13Lichinchi G. Gao S. Saletore Y. Gonzalez G.M.

https://openalex.org/W2881929770,"Serum amyloid A (SAA) is a high-density apolipoprotein whose plasma levels can increase more than 1000-fold during a severe acute-phase inflammatory response and are more modestly elevated in chronic inflammation. SAA is thought to play important roles in innate immunity, but its biological activities have not been completely delineated. We previously reported that SAA deficiency protects mice from developing abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) induced by chronic angiotensin II (AngII) infusion. Here, we report that SAA is required for AngII-induced increases in interleukin-1β (IL-1β), a potent proinflammatory cytokine that is tightly controlled by the Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and caspase-1 and has been implicated in both human and mouse AAAs. We determined that purified SAA stimulates IL-1β secretion in murine J774 and bone marrow-derived macrophages through a mechanism that depends on NLRP3 expression and caspase-1 activity, but is independent of P2X7 nucleotide receptor (P2X7R) activation. Inhibiting reactive oxygen species (ROS) by N-acetyl-l-cysteine or mito-TEMPO and inhibiting activation of cathepsin B by CA-074 blocked SAA-mediated inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion. Moreover, inhibiting cellular potassium efflux with glyburide or increasing extracellular potassium also significantly reduced SAA-mediated IL-1β secretion. Of note, incorporating SAA into high-density lipoprotein (HDL) prior to its use in cell treatments completely abolished its ability to stimulate ROS generation and inflammasome activation. These results provide detailed insights into SAA-mediated IL-1β production and highlight HDL's role in regulating SAA's proinflammatory effects."

https://openalex.org/W2865782570,"Background The central sensitization inventory (CSI) comprises 25 items and is commonly used to measure somatic and emotional symptoms related to central sensitization symptoms. CSI was developed as an easy-to-administer screening instrument for patients at high risk of developing central sensitization in whom it was essential to quickly evaluate the condition. The purpose of the present study was to develop a short form of CSI and evaluate its psychometric properties using a contemporary approach called Rasch analysis. Methods A total of 505 patients with musculoskeletal disorders were recruited in this study. The CSI, pain intensity, pain interference, and the health-related quality of life (QOL) were evaluated for each participant. The original CSI items were consecutively analyzed using the Rasch model. Successive Rasch analyses were performed until a final set of items satisfied the model fit requirements. We also analyzed the psychometric properties of the original and short forms of CSI. Results Four consecutive Rasch analyses identified the removable items. Finally, the shortest questionnaire obtained that maintained the correct psychometric properties based on the Rasch model contained only 9 items (CSI-9). Rasch analysis showed that the CSI-9 had acceptable internal consistency, exhibited unidimensionality, had no notable differential item functioning, and was functional on the category rating scale. Conclusions The nine-item short form of CSI has acceptable psychometric properties and is suitable for use for patients with musculoskeletal pain. Thus, the CSI-9 can be used as a brief instrument to evaluate central sensitization."

https://openalex.org/W2861829921,"This paper addresses the problem of makespan minimization on unrelated parallel machines with sequence dependent setup times. The symbiotic organisms search (SOS) algorithm is a new and popular global optimization technique that has received wide acceptance in recent years from researchers in continuous and discrete optimization domains. An improved SOS algorithm is developed to solve the parallel machine scheduling problem. Since the standard SOS algorithm was originally developed to solve continuous optimization problems, a new solution representation and decoding procedure is designed to make the SOS algorithm suitable for the unrelated parallel machine scheduling problem (UPMSP). Similarly, to enhance the solution quality of the SOS algorithm, an iterated local search strategy based on combining variable numbers of insertion and swap moves is incorporated into the SOS algorithm. More so, to further improve the SOS optimization speed and performance, the longest processing time first (LPT) rule is used to design a machine assignment heuristic that assigns processing machines to jobs based on the machine dynamic load-balancing mechanism. Subsequently, the machine assignment scheme is incorporated into SOS algorithms and used to solve the UPMSP. The performances of the proposed methods are evaluated by comparing their solutions with other existing techniques from the literature. A number of statistical tests were also conducted to determine the variations in performance for each of the techniques. The experimental results showed that the SOS with LPT (SOS-LPT) heuristic has the best performance compared to other tested method, which is closely followed by SOS algorithm, indicating that the two proposed algorithms' solution approaches are reasonable and effective for solving large-scale UPMSPs."
https://openalex.org/W2876540176,"Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is commonly used as a protein fusion domain to facilitate expression and purification of recombinant proteins, and a SUMO-specific protease is then used to remove SUMO from these proteins. Although this protease is highly specific, its limited solubility and stability hamper its utility as an in vitro reagent. Here, we report improved SUMO protease enzymes obtained via two approaches. First, we developed a computational method and used it to re-engineer WT Ulp1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to improve protein solubility. Second, we discovered an improved SUMO protease via genomic mining of the thermophilic fungus Chaetomium thermophilum, as proteins from thermophilic organisms are commonly employed as reagent enzymes. Following expression in Escherichia coli, we found that these re-engineered enzymes can be more thermostable and up to 12 times more soluble, all while retaining WT-or-better levels of SUMO protease activity. The computational method we developed to design solubility-enhancing substitutions is based on the RosettaScripts application for the macromolecular modeling suite Rosetta, and it is broadly applicable for the improvement of solution properties of other proteins. Moreover, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of a SUMO protease from C. thermophilum to 1.44 A resolution. This structure revealed that this enzyme exhibits structural and functional conservation with the S. cerevisiae SUMO protease, despite exhibiting only 28% sequence identity. In summary, by re-engineering the Ulp1 protease and discovering a SUMO protease from C. thermophilum, we have obtained proteases that are more soluble, more thermostable, and more efficient than the current commercially available Ulp1 enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2867543217,"Understanding the fundamental laws that govern complex food web networks over large ecosystems presents high costs and oftentimes unsurmountable logistical challenges. This way, it is crucial to find smaller systems that can be used as proxy food webs. Intertidal rock pool environments harbour particularly high biodiversity over small areas. This study aimed to analyse their food web networks to investigate their potential as proxies of larger ecosystems for food web networks research. Highly resolved food webs were compiled for 116 intertidal rock pools from cold, temperate, subtropical and tropical regions, to ensure a wide representation of environmental variability. The network properties of these food webs were compared to that of estuaries, lakes and rivers, as well as marine and terrestrial ecosystems (46 previously published complex food webs). The intertidal rock pool food webs analysed presented properties that were in the same range as the previously published food webs. The niche model predictive success was remarkably high (73–88%) and similar to that previously found for much larger marine and terrestrial food webs. By using a large-scale sampling effort covering 116 intertidal rock pools in several biogeographic regions, this study showed, for the first time, that intertidal rock pools encompass food webs that share fundamental organizational characteristics with food webs from markedly different, larger, open and abiotically stable ecosystems. As small, self-contained habitats, intertidal rock pools are particularly tractable systems and therefore a large number of food webs can be examined with relatively low sampling effort. This study shows, for the first time that they can be useful models for the understanding of universal processes that regulate the complex network organization of food webs, which are harder or impossible to investigate in larger, open ecosystems, due to high costs and logistical difficulties."
https://openalex.org/W2860509139,"The expression of fucosyltransferase 8, an enzyme responsible for core fucosylation encoded by FUT8, influences tumor biology and correlates with patient prognosis in several solid cancers. We hypothesized that p53 alteration modifies prognostic associations of FUT8 expression in colorectal cancer (CRC), since FUT8 has recently been identified as a direct transcriptional target of wild-type p53. Utilizing multiple datasets of microarray and RNA sequence of CRC, FUT8 mRNA was found to be highly expressed in wild-type p53 tumors (n = 382) compared to those of mutant p53 (n = 437). Prognostic values of FUT8 expression in conjunction with the p53 status for disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed using two independent cohorts of stage II and III CRC after curative surgery, including the immunohistochemistry (IHC) cohort (n = 123) and the microarray cohort (n = 357). In both cohorts, neither FUT8 expression nor the p53 status was associated with DFS. Strikingly, positive expression of FUT8 protein was significantly associated with better DFS only in tumors with negative p53, while it had no prognostic impact in tumors with positive p53 in the IHC cohort. Although not statistically significant, a similar prognostic trend was observed in the microarray cohort when patients were stratified by the p53 status. Our results suggest that the prognostic values of FUT8 expression on DFS may be modified by the p53 status, and the expression of FUT8 protein can be a prognostic biomarker for patients with stage II and III CRC."
https://openalex.org/W2811943604,"Cryopreservation of biological materials is predominantly done using liquid nitrogen, and its application involves high maintenance costs and the need for periodical refilling of liquid nitrogen. Stable storage in mechanical freezers at −80°C would eliminate these issues and allow for shipment of frozen specimens using dry ice. In this work, the possibility of increasing the storage temperature of cryopreserved samples to −80°C by using combinations of DMSO and sucrose has been studied. Preservation efficacy was studied by measuring stability of liposomes encapsulated with carboxyfluorescein during storage at −150, −80 and −25°C for up to three months. Thermal and molecular mobility properties of the different DMSO-sucrose formulations were measured using differential scanning calorimetry, whereas hydrogen bonding interactions of the formulations were probed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. It was found that addition of sucrose to DMSO solutions increases the Tg, and decreases molecular mobility in the glassy state at a particular temperature. Although it was expected that storage above or close to Tg at −80°C would affect liposome stability, stability was found to be similar compared to that of samples stored at −150°C. Higher molecular mobility in the glassy state could not be associated with faster CF-leakage rates. Distinct differences in storage stability at −25°C, far above Tg, were found among the sucrose/DMSO formulations, which were explained by the differences in permeability of sucrose and DMSO resulting in different levels of osmotic stress in the formulations."

The difference between retaining at least one well fixed stem and a complete removal of the megaprosthesis during a two stage revision was also analysed. Methods 627 patients who experienced a replacement of a musculoskeletal tumour by megaprostheses were recorded. An infection occurred in 83 of 621 patients available for follow-up. 61 patients underwent one stage revision, and 16 patients two stage revision for the first revision surgery. In the entire study period, two stage revision was performed 32 times (first, second, and third revision). Results The cumulative incidence analysis showed a reinfection probability after one stage revision of 18% at one year, 30% at two years, 39% at five years, 46% at ten years, and 56% at 15 years. After two stage revision, a reinfection probability of 28% at two years, and 48% at five years was calculated. Cumulative incidence curves did not differ significantly (Gray’s test; p = 0.51) between one and two stage revision (with and without complete removal of the stems). In two stage revision (n = 32), a statistically significant difference in infection rates between patients treated with complete removal of the megaprosthesis (n = 18) including anchorage stems and patients with at least one retained stem (n = 14) was shown (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.029). Conclusion Two stage revisions with complete removal of the megaprosthesis showed the best results among limb salvage procedures for the treatment of infected megaprosthesis."

In vivo, concomitant with epimerization, dermatan 4-O-sulfotransferase 1 (D4ST1) sulfates the GalNAc adjacent to iduronic acid. This sulfation facilitates DS-epi1 activity and enables the formation of long blocks of sulfated iduronic acid–containing domains, which can be major components of CS/DS. In this report, we used recombinant enzymes to confirm the concerted action of DS-epi1 and D4ST1. Confocal microscopy revealed that these two enzymes colocalize to the Golgi, and FRET experiments indicated that they physically interact. Furthermore, FRET, immunoprecipitation, and cross-linking experiments also revealed that DS-epi1, DS-epi2, and D4ST1 form homomers and are all part of a hetero-oligomeric complex where D4ST1 directly interacts with DS-epi1, but not with DS-epi2. The cooperation of DS-epi1 with D4ST1 may therefore explain the processive mode of the formation of iduronic acid blocks.

The danger during pregnancy is further compounded by the capacity of the bacteria to cross the placental barrier, which can result in termination of the developing fetus (4Janakiraman V. Listeriosis in pregnancy: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.Rev. Obstet. Gynecol. 2008; 1 (19173022): 179-185PubMed Google Scholar). The pathogenesis of L. monocytogenes infection and invasion is well characterized (5Radoshevich L. Cossart P.

The invasion of nonphagocytic cells by L. monocytogenes occurs through the action of a complex set of virulence factors that allow the bacteria to enter host cells, escape the vacuole, and hijack the actin network to spread from cell to cell (5Radoshevich L. Cossart P. Listeria monocytogenes: towards a complete picture of its physiology and pathogenesis.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2018; 16 (29176582): 32-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Listeria host cell entry is the initial step in pathogenesis, and it is mediated by two members of the internalin family of virulence factors (InlA 2The abbreviations used are: InlAinternalin AInlBinternalin BLRRleucine-rich repeatVHHvariable region of camelid heavy-chain antibodyIRinterrepeatCDRcomplementarity-determining regionNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidMOImultiplicity of infectionHGF/SFhepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor. and InlB) (6Cossart P.

On the other hand, InlB binds the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met (9Shen Y. Naujokas M. Park M. Ireton K.

Indeed, synergistic action of InlA and InlB is required for L. monocytogenes to cross and penetrate the placental barrier (14Disson O. Grayo S. Huillet E. Nikitas G. Langa-Vives F. Dussurget O. Ragon M. Le Monnier A. Babinet C. Cossart P. Lecuit M. Conjugated action of two species-specific invasion proteins for fetoplacental listeriosis.Nature. 2008; 455 (18806773): 1114-111810.1038/nature07303Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Given the importance of InlB receptor interaction in fetal listeriosis, disruption of this interaction may represent a target for therapeutic intervention. The mature, cell surface form of InlB consists of an N-terminal internalin domain (residues 31–321), a B repeat (residues 322–397), and three GW domains (residues 398–630). The N-terminal internalin domain is primarily responsible for c-Met receptor binding and activation. The domain is composed of an α-helical cap (residues 31–85), seven leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) (residues 86–239), and an interrepeat (IR) (residues 240–321) (15Schubert W.D. Heinz D.W. Structural aspects of adhesion to and invasion of host cells by the human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes.Chembiochem. 2003; 4 (14661268): 1285-129110.1002/cbic.200300624Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A fragment consisting of the cap and the LRR (residues 31–241, InlB241) is the minimum unit that binds the c-Met receptor (9Shen Y. Naujokas M. Park M. Ireton K. InIB-dependent internalization of Listeria is mediated by the Met receptor tyrosine kinase.Cell. 2000; 103 (11081636): 501-51010.1016/S0092-8674(00)00141-0Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). However, c-Met activation and endocytosis also requires the entire N-terminal internalin domain (residues 31–321, InlB321), including the IR region (16Banerjee M. Copp J. Vuga D. Marino M. Chapman T. van der Geer P. Ghosh P. GW domains of the Listeria monocytogenes invasion protein InlB are required for potentiation of Met activation.Mol.

Although interruption of the InlB–c-Met interaction is an intriguing approach for preventing Listeria cellular invasion, one potential pitfall is that the protein is buried in the peptidoglycan layer. One innovative solution is to use single-domain antibodies (VHH), derived from the antigen-binding fragment of the heavy-chain antibodies found in camelids (17Muyldermans S. Nanobodies: natural single-domain antibodies.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2013; 82 (23495938): 775-79710.1146/annurev-biochem-063011-092449Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar). VHH are 10 times smaller (12–15 kDa) than conventional IgG antibodies (150 kDa) and may be able to penetrate the Listeria cell wall to bind InlB. Previously, four VHH (R303, R326, R330, and R419) that bind the LRR domain of InlB with nanomolar affinity were isolated from a nonimmune phage display library (18Gene R.W. Kumaran J. Aroche C. van Faassen H. Hall J.C. MacKenzie C.R. Arbabi-Ghahroudi M. High affinity anti-Internalin B VHH antibody fragments isolated from naturally and artificially immunized repertoires.J. Immunol.

Semiautomated panning of naive camelidae libraries and selection of single-domain antibodies against peptide antigens.Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 911 (22886248): 105-124PubMed Google Scholar). As the InlB-LRR domain is crucial for interaction with c-Met, we hypothesized that these VHH could inhibit bacterial endocytosis and protect the cells from Listeria invasion. We demonstrate that InlB-specific VHH effectively neutralize Listeria invasion in vitro. Furthermore, high-resolution X-ray structures reveal that the mechanism behind VHH-mediated Listeria inhibition is competitive inhibition of the InlB–c-Met interaction. Previous work had identified several VHH (R303, R330, R419, and R326) from a preimmune (naive) phage display library that bound the LRR domain of InlB (residues 36–249; InlB249) (18Gene R.W. Kumaran J. Aroche C. van Faassen H. Hall J.C. MacKenzie C.R. Arbabi-Ghahroudi M. High affinity anti-Internalin B VHH antibody fragments isolated from naturally and artificially immunized repertoires.J. Immunol. Methods. 2015; 416 (25450000): 29-3910.1016/j.jim.2014.10.009Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Using an indirect ELISA the relative affinity of the VHH for the LRR domain of InlB was compared (Fig. 1A). A variable concentration of immobilized InlB249 was detected using a fixed concentration of biotinylated VHH. Consistent with previously reported surface plasmon resonance results (18Gene R.W. Kumaran J. Aroche C. van Faassen H. Hall J.C. MacKenzie C.R. Arbabi-Ghahroudi M. High affinity anti-Internalin B VHH antibody fragments isolated from naturally and artificially immunized repertoires.J. Immunol. Methods. 2015; 416 (25450000): 29-3910.1016/j.jim.2014.10.009Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), VHH R303, R326, and R330 bound to immobilized InlB249 with a similar apparent affinity (Fig. 1A). However, no binding of VHH R419 to InlB249 was observed. Because the VHH were originally generated by screening a phage display library against a truncated version of InlB with only the cap and the LRR domain (InlB249), we next investigated whether the VHH would also bind InlB if the IR domain was also present (InlB321) (Fig. 1B). R303 and R330 both bound to InlB321 with similar affinity; however, R326 bound with ∼2-fold lower affinity to InlB321 when compared with R303 and R330 (Fig. 1B). The VHH R303, R330, and R326 displayed variability in their CDR sequences and canonical CDR cluster classification (Table 1). Furthermore, based on nucleotide sequence alignments with antibody germ line segments, the VHH may be derived from different species of Camelid. This was expected, as the phage display library used to isolate these VHH is originated from the immune repertoire of three species of Camelid (18Gene R.W. Kumaran J. Aroche C. van Faassen H. Hall J.C. MacKenzie C.R. Arbabi-Ghahroudi M. High affinity anti-Internalin B VHH antibody fragments isolated from naturally and artificially immunized repertoires.J. Immunol.

R303 is unquestionably from Camelus dromedaries, whereas R330, R326, and R419 are derived from either Llama glama or Vicugna pacos. Given this diversity, we next investigated the epitope specificity of the VHH.Table 1CDR amino acid sequences and canonical clusters of InlB-specific VHHVHHCDR-1CDR-2CDR-3SequenceClusteraCDR definitions and structural clusters defined in North et al.

Open table in a new tab The possibility that the VHH bound distinct InlB epitopes was investigated using a competitive ELISA. A single fixed concentration of InlB249 or InlB321 was immobilized, and a mixture of biotinylated R303, R326, or R330 was added along with an 80-fold higher concentration of unlabeled R303 to act as an inhibitor (Fig. 1C). Assuming the VHH bound to spatially distinct epitopes, the expectation was that R303 would not act as an inhibitor for the other VHH. On the other hand, if the VHH bound to overlapping epitopes, R303 should inhibit binding. In all cases, R303 acted as an inhibitor to binding, suggesting that all three VHH (R303, R330, and R326) bound overlapping epitopes (Fig. 1C). Interaction of InlB with the host cell c-Met receptor is essential for Listeria invasion of epithelial cells (11Braun L. Ohayon H. Cossart P. The InIB protein of Listeria monocytogenes is sufficient to promote entry into mammalian cells.Mol.

Gentamicin protection assays were employed to determine whether InlB-specific VHH could inhibit Listeria invasion in vitro. L. monocytogenes were treated with the four VHH (R303, R330, R326, and R419) and allowed to invade HeLa cells in vitro. InlB249 was used as a positive control, as it has been previously shown to inhibit Listeria invasion of HeLa cells (10Braun L. Nato F. Payrastre B. Mazié J.C. Cossart P.

Structural and thermodynamic analysis of the GFP:GFP-nanobody complex.Protein Sci. 2010; 19 (20945358): 2389-240110.1002/pro.519Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) was used as a negative control. Following protein treatment, gentamicin was added to eradicate noninternalized Listeria. HeLa cells were lysed, the internalized bacteria were counted, and the efficiency of Listeria invasion was calculated (Fig. 2). As R303, R326, and R330 bound overlapping epitopes on InlB249 and InlB321 (Fig. 1), it was hypothesized that these three VHH would perform similarly in the invasion assay. However, there were some differences in the ability of VHH to inhibit Listeria invasion. R303 and R330 were both highly effective at inhibiting Listeria internalization of HeLa cells (94 ± 1.4 and 75 ± 1.9%, respectively; Fig. 2). However, R326 exhibited a reduced ability to inhibit Listeria invasion of HeLa cells (36 ± 5.5%). Given that R419 did not bind InlB (Fig. 1), it was not surprising that the VHH resulted in a level of invasion inhibition similar to that of the irrelevant VHH control (Fig. 2). As a second line of evidence to evaluate VHH neutralization of Listeria, a fluorescence microscopy–based invasion assay was conducted (21Agerer F. Waeckerle S. Hauck C.R. Microscopic quantification of bacterial invasion by a novel antibody-independent staining method.J. Microbiol. Methods. 2004; 59 (15325750): 23-3210.1016/j.mimet.2004.05.008Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A strain of constitutively expressing GFP Listeria was constructed, followed by biotinylation and subsequent invasion of the strain into HeLa cells. Listeria cells were treated with PBS (negative control), an irrelevant GFP-specific VHH (negative control), InlB249 (positive control), and each of the InlB-specific VHH. Following invasion, the cells were treated with streptavidin conjugated to DyLight550. If the GFP-expressing Listeria invaded the HeLa cells, they would not be detected by the red-labeled streptavidin; however, if the Listeria were impeded from cell invasion, they would be available for detection by the labeled streptavidin and would thus be stained red. The negative controls, PBS and irrelevant VHH, resulted in minimal red staining of the GFP-expressing Listeria, indicating that the strain had invaded the HeLa cells (Fig. 3). When treated with the InlB249-positive control and with R303, R330, and R326, the majority of the Listeria cells were stained red, indicating that they remained extracellular to the HeLa cells and had been inhibited from invasion (Fig. 3). R419 did not inhibit Listeria invasion, consistent with the results of the ELISA and gentamicin protection assays (Figure 1., Figure 2., Figure 3.). X-ray structures of VHH R303, R326, and R330 were determined at resolutions ranging from 1.3 to 1.8 Å (Table 2). Consistent with the divergent amino acid sequences of the VHH CDRs (Table 1), the X-ray structures revealed variability in the antigen-binding sites. The CDRs were assigned using the definitions reported by North et al. (22North B. Lehmann A. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. A new clustering of antibody CDR loop conformations.J. Mol.

R303 had the longest CDR-3 of the three VHH with a length of 16 amino acids (Table 1 and Fig. 4A). A noncanonical disulfide bond was formed between CDR-1 and CDR-3 (residues 33–102) that linked the long 16-residue CDR-3 loop against the framework region of the antibody (Fig. 4A). CDR-3 formed a short helical segment (residues 102–107) in proximity to the noncanonical disulfide bond. The fixing of CDR-3 against the framework region resulted in a large solvent-accessible surface area (1970 Å2) available for antigen recognition. The CDR-1 loop bisects the antibody paratope, creating two relatively flat interaction surfaces on either side of the loop. The paratope region between CDR-1 and CDR-3 showed a positively charged electrostatic surface, with a wide pocket-like structure forming (Fig. 4A). The structure of VHH R326 was solved to a resolution of 1.8 Å and contained a tetramer in the asymmetric unit. Unlike R303, R326 had no disulfide bond connecting CDR-3 to CDR-1. Structurally, R326 was distinct from the other two VHH with the three CDR loops protruding from the framework region, forming a convex paratope structure (Fig. 4B). The paratope was a large solvent-accessible surface area (1650 Å2) with a positively charged electrostatic surface (Fig. 4B). The structure of VHH R330 was solved to a resolution of 1.6 Å and contained a dimer in the asymmetric unit. Similar to R326, the paratope of R330 was a wide, roughly convex shape with a positively charged solvent-accessible surface area of 2050 Å2 (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, the structure of CDR-1 of R330 did not fall into one of the previously characterized structural clusters identified by North et al. (22North B. Lehmann A. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. A new clustering of antibody CDR loop conformations.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 406 (21035459): 228-25610.1016/j.jmb.2010.10.030Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) (Table 1). CDR-1 also was disordered at the apex of the loop (residue 28 in chain A; residues 29 and 30 in chain B). To determine the molecular mechanism behind VHH neutralization of Listeria invasion, the structures of VHH R303 in complex with the LRR domain of InlB (InlB249) and the longer InlB fragment of the LRR domain linked to the IR region (InlB321) were both determined to a resolution of ∼1.5 Å. The two complex structures crystallized in different space groups (Table 2). R303 in complex with InlB249 crystallized as a monomer, whereas R303 with InlB321 was a dimer in the asymmetric unit. The overall binding interactions between R303 and InlB249 and InlB321 were identical (Fig. 5A), indicating that the IR domain of InlB321 played no role in binding. This finding is consistent with the observation that R303 binds to both proteins (InlB249 and InlB321) with similar affinity (Fig. 1, A and B). The entire interaction between R303 and InlB occurs on an electronegative cavity on the concave face of the InlB-LRR domain, resulting an approximate buried surface area of 1400 Å2. The bulk of the binding interactions are mediated by CDR-3 and CDR-2, with CDR-1 displaying only limited contact with InlB (Fig. 5B). Consistent with the picomolar affinity of R303 for the InlB-LRR domain (18Gene R.W. Kumaran J. Aroche C. van Faassen H. Hall J.C. MacKenzie C.R. Arbabi-Ghahroudi M. High affinity anti-Internalin B VHH antibody fragments isolated from naturally and artificially immunized repertoires.J. Immunol.

Interactions originating from CDR-3 on R303 are of central importance and form the majority of the binding interactions (Fig. 5). There were a series of salt bridges that likely contribute significantly to the high-affinity binding of the VHH. The salt bridges are formed between Arg-100vhh on CDR-3 of R303 and Glu-194inl and Glu-236inl on InlB (where the superscript “vhh” denotes residues on VHH R303 and the superscript “inl” denotes residues on InlB) (Fig. 5B). This central arginine residue on R303 also forms a hydrogen bond to Tyr-214inl. Additional polar interactions include 12 hydrogen bonds between the antibody and InlB. On CDR-3, Asn-103vhh hydrogen-bonds to Ser-168inl, Asp-189inl, and Thr-190inl. The adjacent residue on CDR-3, Thr-104vhh, hydrogen-bonds to the hydroxyl side chain of Tyr-170inl (Fig. 5B). On CDR-2, Ser-56vhh and Ser-57vhh form hydrogen bonds to Asp-233inl (Fig. 5B). In addition to the polar contacts, there are aromatic stacking interactions, with the side chain of Phe-104vhh on CDR-3 inserting between Tyr-214inl and Tyr-170inl (Fig. 5B). Th"
https://openalex.org/W2809896829,"Sporozoite forms of the malaria parasite Plasmodium are transmitted by mosquitoes and first infect the liver for an initial round of replication before parasite proliferation in the blood. The molecular mechanisms involved during sporozoite invasion of hepatocytes remain poorly understood. In previous studies, two receptors of the Hepatitis C virus (HCV), the tetraspanin CD81 and the Scavenger Receptor BI (SR-BI), were shown to play an important role during entry of Plasmodium sporozoites into hepatocytic cells. In contrast to HCV entry, which requires both CD81 and SR-BI together with additional host factors, CD81 and SR-BI operate independently during malaria liver infection, as sporozoites can use CD81 and/or SR-BI, depending on the Plasmodium species, to invade hepatocytes. However, the molecular function of CD81 and SR-BI during parasite entry remains unknown. Another HCV entry factor, the Ephrin receptor A2 (EphA2), was recently reported to play a key role as a host cell entry factor during malaria liver infection. Here, we investigated the contribution of EphA2 during CD81-dependent and SR-BI-dependent sporozoite infection. Using small interfering RNA (siRNA) and antibodies against EphA2, combined with direct detection of parasites by flow cytometry or microscopy, we show that blocking EphA2 has no significant impact on P. yoelii or P. berghei host cell infection, irrespective of the entry route. Thus, our findings argue against an important role of EphA2 during malaria liver infection."
https://openalex.org/W2853662294,"Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a fatal neurodegenerative genetic disease that is characterized by pronounced neuronal loss and gliosis in the cerebellum. We have previously demonstrated microglial activation, measured as an increase in microglial density in cerebellar cortex and an increase in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), in the cerebellum of the ATXN1[82Q] transgenic mouse model of SCA1. To examine the role of activated state of microglia in SCA1, we used a Cre-Lox approach with IKKβF/F;LysM Cre mice intended to reduce inflammatory NF-κB signaling, selectively in microglia. ATXN1[82Q];IKKβF/F;LysM Cre mice showed reduced cerebellar microglial density and production of TNFα compared to ATXN1[82Q] mice, yet reducing NF-κB did not ameliorate motor impairments and cerebellar cellular pathologies. Unexpectedly, at 12 weeks of age, control IKKβF/F;LysM Cre mice showed motor deficits equal to ATXN1[82Q] mice that were dissociated from any obvious neurodegenerative changes in the cerebellum, but were rather associated with a developmental impairment that presented as a retention of climbing fiber synaptic terminals on the soma of Purkinje neurons. These results indicate that NF-κB signaling is required for increase in microglial numbers and TNF-α production in the cerebella of ATXN1[82Q] mouse model of SCA1. Furthermore, these results elucidate a novel role of canonical NF-κB signaling in pruning of surplus synapses on Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum during development."
https://openalex.org/W2868623410,"Background Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common adult primary brain tumor. Multimodal treatment is empiric and prognosis remains poor. Recurrent PIK3CA missense mutations (PIK3CAmut) in GBM are restricted to three functional domains: adaptor binding (ABD), helical, and kinase. Defining how these mutations influence gliomagenesis and response to kinase inhibitors may aid in the clinical development of novel targeted therapies in biomarker-stratified patients. Methods We used normal human astrocytes immortalized via expression of hTERT, E6, and E7 (NHA). We selected two PIK3CAmut from each of 3 mutated domains and induced their expression in NHA with (NHARAS) and without mutant RAS using lentiviral vectors. We then examined the role of PIK3CAmut in gliomagenesis in vitro and in mice, as well as response to targeted PI3K (PI3Ki) and MEK (MEKi) inhibitors in vitro. Results PIK3CAmut, particularly helical and kinase domain mutations, potentiated proximal PI3K signaling and migration of NHA and NHARAS in vitro. Only kinase domain mutations promoted NHA colony formation, but both helical and kinase domain mutations promoted NHARAS tumorigenesis in vivo. PIK3CAmut status had minimal effects on PI3Ki and MEKi efficacy. However, PI3Ki/MEKi synergism was pronounced in NHA and NHARAS harboring ABD or helical mutations. Conclusion PIK3CAmut promoted differential gliomagenesis based on the mutated domain. While PIK3CAmut did not influence sensitivity to single agent PI3Ki, they did alter PI3Ki/MEKi synergism. Taken together, our results demonstrate that a subset of PIK3CAmut promote tumorigenesis and suggest that patients with helical domain mutations may be most sensitive to dual PI3Ki/MEKi treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2863247673,"The use of remote sensing techniques to identify (geo)archaeological features is wide spread. For archaeological prospection and geomorphological mapping, Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) on based LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) are mainly used to detect surface and subsurface features. LiDAR is a remote sensing tool that scans the surface with high spatial resolution and allows for the removal of vegetation cover with special data filters. Archaeological publications with LiDAR data in issues have been rising exponentially since the mid-2000s. The methodology of DTM analyses within geoarchaeological contexts is usually based on “bare-earth” LiDAR data, although the terrain is often significantly affected by human activities. However, “bare-earth” LiDAR data analyses are very restricted in the case of historic hydro-engineering such as irrigation systems, mills, or canals because modern roads, railway tracks, buildings, and earth lynchets influence surface water flows and may dissect the terrain. Consequently, a ""natural"" pre-modern DTM with high depth accuracy is required for palaeohydrological analyses. In this study, we present a GIS-based modelling approach to generate a pre-modern and topographically purged DTM. The case study focuses on the landscape around the Early Medieval Fossa Carolina, a canal constructed by Charlemagne and one of the major medieval engineering projects in Europe. Our aim is to reconstruct the pre-modern relief around the Fossa Carolina for a better understanding and interpretation of the alignment of the Carolingian canal. Our input data are LiDAR-derived DTMs and a comprehensive vector layer of anthropogenic structures that affect the modern relief. We interpolated the residual points with a spline algorithm and smoothed the result with a low pass filter. The purged DTM reflects the pre-modern shape of the landscape. To validate and ground-truth the model, we used the levels of recovered pre-modern soils and surfaces that have been buried by floodplain deposits, colluvial layers, or dam material of the Carolingian canal. We compared pre-modern soil and surface levels with the modelled pre-modern terrain levels and calculated the overall error. The modelled pre-modern surface fits with the levels of the buried soils and surfaces. Furthermore, the pre-modern DTM allows us to model the most favourable course of the canal with minimal earth volume to dig out. This modelled pathway corresponds significantly with the alignment of the Carolingian canal. Our method offers various new opportunities for geoarchaeological terrain analysis, for which an undisturbed high-precision pre-modern surface is crucial."
https://openalex.org/W2871584636,"For promoting the successful aging of elderly residents of Chang Gung Silver Village in Taiwan, five interactive exergames were developed to promote the well-being of the elderly. The exergames included both physical games and cognitive games, and were implemented using various computer-based technologies in the Chang Gung Silver Village. The exergames were trialed by 39 elderly residents (15 male, 24 female; mean age 79.5 ± 17.5 years) of Chang Gung Silver Village. Following the trials, the participants were requested to complete a Technology Acceptance Model 2 (TAM2) questionnaire. The results showed that the perceived playfulness and perceived usefulness of the exergames were significantly related to the users’ usage behavior and intention to use for both the physical games and the cognitive games. However, a relationship between the output quality of the game and the usage behavior was apparent only in the case of the cognitive exergames. Finally, the impact of social influence on the intention to use and the usage behavior was more pronounced for the physical exergames. Overall, the results revealed that the acceptance of exergames by the elderly depends not so much on the awareness of fun in using the game, but the perceived usefulness of the related physical and cognitive abilities."

In this context accurate assessment of risk factors at the individual level play a decisive role in cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, the frequency of their coexistence in individuals, and identify possible determinants associated with this coexistence in Brazilian adolescents. A cross-sectional study with 1170 students (12–17 years) from public and private schools of a large city was conducted. In addition to family history, modifiable cardiovascular risk factors were assessed including: tobacco use, alcohol consumption, sedentary lifestyle, overweight/obesity, increased waist circumference, and high blood pressure (office and home). We built a linear regression model to identify determinants associated with increasing number of modifiable risk factors. Mean study population age was 14.7±1.6 years, 67% were enrolled in public schools and 33% in private ones. The majority of the adolescents had at least two risk factors (68.9%), more than 10% had more than 4 risk factors, and in only 6.7% of the sample no risk factor was identified. Family history of CVD (β-coefficient = 1.20; 95%CI 1.07–1.34; p<0.001), increasing age (β-coefficient = 0.08; 95%CI 0.04–0.11; p<0.001), and being enrolled in private schools (β-coefficient = 0.16; 95%CI 0.02–0.30; p = 0.023) were directly associated with the modifiable CV risk factors. In conclusion, the prevalence of multiple cardiovascular risk factors was high in the population of adolescents studied. School based interventions should be addressed to change this scenario."
https://openalex.org/W2848583990,"Sequencing of primary colorectal tumors has identified a gene fusion in approximately 3% of colorectal cancer patients of the VTI1A and TCF7L2 genes, encoding a VTI1A-TCF4 fusion protein containing a truncated TCF4. As dysregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway is associated with colorectal cancer development and progression, the functional properties and transcriptional regulation of the VTI1A-TCF4 fusion protein may also play a role in these processes. Functional characteristics of the VTI1A-TCF4 fusion protein in Wnt signaling were analyzed in NCI-H508 and LS174T colon cancer cell lines. The NCI-H508 cell line, containing the VTI1A-TCF7L2 fusion gene, showed no active Wnt signaling, and overexpression of the VTI1A-TCF4 fusion protein in LS174T cells along with a Wnt signaling luciferase reporter plasmid showed inhibition of activity. The transcriptional regulation of the VTI1A-TCF4 fusion gene was investigated in LS174T cells where the activity of the VTI1A promoter was compared to that of the TCF7L2 promoter, and the transcription factor CDX2 was analyzed for gene regulatory activity of the VTI1A promoter through luciferase reporter gene assay using colon cancer cell lines as a model. Transfection of LS174T cells showed that the VTI1A promoter is highly active compared to the TCF7L2 promoter, and that CDX2 activates transcription of VTI1A. These results suggest that the VTI1A-TCF4 fusion protein is a dominant negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway, and that transcription of VTI1A is activated by CDX2."
https://openalex.org/W2830299777,"The aim is to investigate the relationship between a positive outcome on rehabilitation after hip fracture and behavioral psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) transition during rehabilitation. This study is a retrospective cohort study based on the Japan Rehabilitation Database. We recruited 756 subjects 65 years of age or older from 31 hospitals in the database. All subjects were in the hospital as patients undergoing rehabilitation for hip fracture. Functional independence measure (FIM), walking ability, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and BPSD were measured both at the beginning and at the end of rehabilitation. MMSE for 23 or under was defined as the cognitive-impaired group. MMSE for 24 or over was used as the cognitively intact group. Cognitive impaired participants were divided into four groups: participants presented no BPSD both at the beginning of rehabilitation and at the end of rehabilitation (Group (-/-)), participants presented BPSD at the beginning of rehabilitation but resolved at the end of rehabilitation (Group (+/-)), participants had no BPSD at the beginning of rehabilitation but appeared at the end of rehabilitation (Group (-/+)) and participants had sign of BPSD both at the beginning of rehabilitation and at the end of rehabilitation (Group (+/+)). The endpoints were waking ability, FIM gain. As results, one hundred thirty-seven cognitive-impaired older people patients out of 471 (29.1%) suffered from BPSD at the beginning of rehabilitation. FIM gains in cognitively intact group, Group (-/-), Group (+/-), Group (-/+) and Group (+/+) were 24.8 ± 18.7, 17.5 ± 16.9, 27.3 ± 19.7, 17.8 ± 12.2 and 12.2 ± 17.2, respectively. The Group (+/-) was significantly connected to a positive outcome for rehabilitation. The present study suggested that the management of BPSD can lead to better functional recovery during rehabilitation."
https://openalex.org/W2856492201,"Several antimicrobials are routinely used by the poultry farming industry on their daily operations, however, researchers have found for some antimicrobials that their residues persist for longer periods in feathers than they do in edible tissues, and at higher concentrations, as well. But this information is not known for other classes of antimicrobials, such as the sulfonamides. Therefore, this work presents an accurate and reliable analytical method for the detection of sulfachloropyridazine (SCP) in feathers and edible tissues from broiler chickens. This method was also validated in-house and then used to study the depletion of sulfachloropyridazine in those matrices. The experimental group comprised 54 broiler chickens, who were raised under controlled conditions and then treated with a commercial formulation of 10% sulfachloropyridazine for 5 days. Samples were analyzed via LC-MS/MS, using 13C6-sulfamethazine (SMZ-13C6) as an internal standard. Aromatic sulfonic acid solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges were used to clean up the samples. The Limit of Detection (LOD) for this method was set at 10 μg kg-1 on feathers and liver; and at 5 μg kg-1 on muscle. Within the range of 10–100 μg kg-1, the calibration curves for all matrices presented a determination coefficient greater than 0.96. Our results show, with a 95% confidence level, that sulfachloropyridazine persisted in feathers for up to 55 days after ceasing treatment, and its concentrations were higher than in edible tissues. In consequence, to avoid re-entry of antimicrobial residues into the food-chain, we recommend monitoring and inspecting animal diets that contain feather derivatives, such as feathers meals, because they could be sourced from birds that might have been medicated with sulfachloropyridazine."

It establishes a replicative niche called Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) that allows bacteria to survive and replicate inside pulmonary macrophages. To hijack host cell defense systems, L. pneumophila injects over 300 effector proteins into the host cell cytosol. The Lem4 effector (lpg1101) consists of two domains: an N-terminal haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) domain with unknown function and a C-terminal phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate–binding domain that anchors Lem4 to the membrane of early LCVs. Herein, we demonstrate that the HAD domain (Lem4-N) is structurally similar to mouse MDP-1 phosphatase and displays phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity. Substrate specificity of Lem4 was probed using a tyrosine phosphatase substrate set, which contained a selection of 360 phosphopeptides derived from human phosphorylation sites. This assay allowed us to identify a consensus pTyr-containing motif. Based on the localization of Lem4 to lysosomes and to some extent to plasma membrane when expressed in human cells, we hypothesize that this protein is involved in protein–protein interactions with an LCV or plasma membrane–associated tyrosine-phosphorylated host target.

https://openalex.org/W2838446377,"The global increase in vector borne diseases has been linked to climate change. Seasonal vegetation changes are known to influence disease vector population. However, the relationship is more theoretical than quantitatively defined. There is a growing demand for understanding and prediction of climate sensitive vector borne disease risks especially in regions where meteorological data are lacking. This study aimed at analyzing and quantitatively assessing the seasonal and year-to-year association between climatic factors (rainfall and temperature) and vegetation cover, and its implications for malaria risks in Baringo County, Kenya. Remotely sensed temperature, rainfall, and vegetation data for the period 2004–2015 were used. Poisson regression was used to model the association between malaria cases and climatic and environmental factors for the period 2009–2012, this being the period for which all datasets overlapped. A strong positive relationship was observed between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and monthly total precipitation. There was a strong negative relationship between NDVI and minimum temperature. The total monthly rainfall (between 94 -181mm), average monthly minimum temperatures (between 16–21°C) and mean monthly NDVI values lower than 0.35 were significantly associated with malaria incidence rates. Results suggests that a combination of climatic and vegetation greenness thresholds need to be met for malaria incidence to be significantly increased in the county. Planning for malaria control can therefore be enhanced by incorporating these factors in malaria risk mapping."
https://openalex.org/W2811813823,"Many bacterial pathogens employ multicomponent protein complexes such as type IV secretion systems (T4SSs) to transfer virulence factors into host cells. Here we studied the interaction between two essential T4SS components: the very hydrophobic inner membrane protein VirB6, which may be a component of the translocation channel, and VirB10, which links the inner and outer bacterial membranes. To map the interaction site between these two T4SS components, we conducted alanine scanning and deleted six-amino acid stretches from the N-terminal periplasmic domain of VirB6 from Brucella suis. Using the bacterial two-hybrid system to analyze the effects of these alterations on the VirB6–VirB10 interaction, we identified the amino acid regions 16–21 and 28–33 and Leu-18 in VirB6 as being required for this interaction. SDS-PAGE coupled with Western blotting of cell lysates and native PAGE of detergent-extracted membrane proteins revealed that the corresponding VirB6 residues in Agrobacterium tumefaciens (Phe-20 and amino acids 18–23 and 30–35) modulate the stability of both VirB6 and VirB5. However, the results from immuno-EM and super-resolution microscopy suggested that these regions and residues are not required for membrane association or for polar localization of VirB6. The six-amino acid deletions in the N terminus of VirB6 abolished pilus formation and virulence of A. tumefaciens, and the corresponding deletions in the VirB6 homolog TraD from the plasmid pKM101-T4SS abrogated plasmid transfer. Our results indicate that specific residues of the VirB6 N-terminal domain are required for VirB6 stabilization, its interaction with VirB10, and the incorporation of VirB2 and VirB5 into T-pili."

In this work, we developed a prototype open-architecture, automated nucleic acid workstation that includes a mechanical homogenization and lysis function integrated with heating and TruTip purification; optimized an extraction protocol for raw sputum; and evaluated system performance on primary clinical specimens. Eight samples could be processed within 70 min. The system efficiently homogenized primary sputa and doubled nucleic acid recovery relative to an automated protocol that did not incorporate sample homogenization. Nucleic acid recovery was at least five times higher from raw sputum as compared to that of matched sediments regardless of smear or culture grade, and the automated workstation reproducibly recovered PCR-detectable DNA to at least 80 CFU mL-1 raw sputum. M. tuberculosis DNA was recovered and detected from 122/123 (99.2%) and 124/124 (100%) primary sputum and sediment extracts, respectively. There was no detectable cross-contamination across 53 automated system runs and amplification or fluorescent inhibitors (if present) were not detectable. The open fluidic architecture of the prototype automated workstation yields purified sputum DNA that can be used for any molecular diagnostic test. The ability to transfer TruTip protocols between personalized, on-demand pipetting tools and the fully automated workstation also affords public health agencies an opportunity to standardize sputum nucleic acid sample preparation procedures, reagents, and quality control across multiple levels of the health care system."
https://openalex.org/W2842511214,"Introduction Preterm birth is associated with increased risk of respiratory symptoms in childhood, often treated with asthma medication. We designed a follow-up study to previous research and investigated whether the association of gestational age with purchasing asthma medication diminishes in adulthood. Methods We conducted a register-based study of a national cohort of all infants born in Denmark in 1980–2009 evaluating longitudinal data on individually prescribed asthma medication (both inhaled ß-2 receptor agonist and different controller treatment over 2-year periods) available from 1995–2011. We analyzed the effect of gestational age considering age, birth year, and perinatal variables using logistic regression with a Generalized Estimating Equations model. All data were unambiguously linked through the Civil Registration System. Results We included 1,819,743 individuals in our study population. We found an inverse dose-response relationship between gestational age and asthma medication in earlier age-groups with a gradual decrease in odds ratios with increasing age and loss of statistical significance in early adulthood (18–31 years). For our oldest generations, there was a significant effect of gestational age (p-value = 0.04), which became insignificant when adjusting for confounding and mediating factors (p = 0.44). There were significant interactions between gestational age and age (p<0.0001) and gestational age and birth year, but these were most important during childhood (0–11 years) and for our youngest generations (born after 1995). Conclusion The strong association between gestational age and purchase of prescription asthma medication weakens with age into early adulthood, in consistence with the results from our previous study. The risk for purchasing medication to treat asthma-like symptoms was higher in more recent birth years, but the effect of gestational age was small beyond 11 years of age. Gestational age per se did not seem to be significant for the development of asthma-like symptoms: most of its effect could be explained by other perinatal factors."
https://openalex.org/W2843604787,"Hltf is regulated by intron retention, and global Hltf-deletion causes perinatal lethality from hypoglycemia. In heart, full-length Hltf is a transcriptional regulator of Hif-1α that controls transport systems. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that Hltf deletion from placenta caused or exacerbated neonatal hypoglycemia via Hif-1α regulation of nutrient transporters. RNA-seq data analyses identified significant changes in transcript expression and alternative splicing (AS) in E18.5 placentome. iPathwayGuide was used for gene ontology (GO) analysis of biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components. Elim pruning algorithm identified hierarchical relationships. The methylome was interrogated by Methyl-MiniSeq Epiquest analysis. GO analysis identified gene enrichment within biological processes. Protein expression was visualized with immunohistochemistry. Although two Hltf mRNA isoforms are quantifiable in most murine tissues, only the truncated Hltf isoform is expressed in placenta. The responsible intron retention event occurs in the absence of DNA methylation. iPathwayGuide analysis identified 157 target genes of 11,538 total genes with measured expression. These were obtained using a threshold of 0.05 for statistical significance (p-value) and a long fold change of expression with absolute value of at least 0.6. Hltf deletion altered transcription of trophoblast lineage-specific genes, and increased transcription of the Cxcr7 (p = 0.004) gene whose protein product is a co-receptor for human and simian immunodeficiency viruses. Concomitant increased Cxcr7 protein was identified with immunolabeling. Hltf deletion had no effect on transcription or site-specific methylation patterns of Hif-1α, the major glucose transporters, or System A amino acid transporters. There was no measureable evidence of uteroplacental dysfunction or fetal compromise. iPathGuide analysis revealed Hltf suppresses cytolysis (10/21 genes; p-value 1.900e-12; p-value correction: Elim pruning; GO:019835) including the perforin-granzyme pathway in uterine natural killer cells. Our findings 1) prove the truncated Hltf protein isoform is a transcription factor, 2) establish a functional link between AS of Hltf and immunosuppression at the feto-maternal interface, 3) correlate intron retention with the absence of DNA methylation, and 4) underscore the importance of differential splicing analysis to identify Hltf’s functional diversity."

Biochemical analysis uncovered the contents of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophyll and carotenoid were notably decreased in YL. Using RNA-Seq technology, more than 38 million clean reads were generated in each pool, and 116,422 unigenes were assembled de novo. 6,660 unigenes with differential expression patterns (FDR≤0.01 and |log2 ratio|≥1) were totally identified between the two cultivars. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis of differentially expressed unigenes (DEGs) suggested 33 KEGG pathways were notably enriched, including biological processes such as “phenylpropanoid biosynthesis”, “phagosome”, “starch and sucrose metabolism”, “drug metabolism—cytochrome P450”, “fatty acid elongation”, and “flavone and flavonol biosynthesis”. Further analysis revealed that chlorophyll degeneration related unigene (c48794_g1) and flavonoid biosynthesis related unigenes (c16388_g1, c48963_g1, c63571_g1, c4492_g1, c52282_g1, c78740_g1, c4645_g1) were up-regulated while carotenoid biosynthesis related unigene (c7212_g1) were down-regulated in YL.

We used three-month-old male Wistar rats, weighing 300–350 g. In the first experiment, the animals were divided into four groups (n = 5 each): one sham surgery group and three ischemic lesion groups having thermocoagulation induction (TCI) temperatures of 200°C, 300°C, and 400°C, respectively, with blood perfusion (basal and 30 min after TCI) and 2,3,5-Triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride (TTC) evaluation at 2 h after TCI. In the second experiment, five groups (n = 5 each) were analyzed by MRI (basal and 24 h after TCI) and behavioral tests (basal and seven days after TCI) with the control group added for the surgical effects. The MRI and TTC analyses revealed that ischemic brain lesions expressively evolved, especially at TCI temperatures of 300°C and 400°C, and significant motor deficits were observed as the animals showed a decrease frequency of movement and an asymmetric pattern. We conclude that a TCI temperature of 400°C causes permanent ischemic stroke and motor deficit."

The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of toasting time of rapeseed meal (RSM) and the processing method of the diets (pelleting and extrusion) that included RSM on the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of total lysine, fructosyl-lysine (FL), carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), carboxyethyl-lysine (CEL), lanthionine (LAN) and lysinoalanine (LAL) in growing pigs. The study consisted of a 2×3 factorial design with toasting time of RSM (60, 120 min) and diet processing method (mash, pelleted, extruded) as factors. Fifty growing pigs were individually fed one of the experimental diets for 4.5 consecutive days. Following euthanasia, samples of digesta were collected from the terminal 1.5 m of the small intestine. Increasing the toasting time of RSM increased the contents of FL, CML and CEL, whereas the additional effects of the diet processing methods were relatively small. Lysinoalanine and lanthionine were not detected in the diets; therefore, digestibility of these compounds could not be determined. The contents of FL, CML and CEL in the ileal chyme were positively correlated to their contents in the diets. The AID of the MRP from thermally-treated RSM were overall low and were not related to their contents in the diets. The AID of FL ranged between -8.5 and 19.1%, whilst AID of CML and CEL ranged from -0.2 to 18.3 and 3.6 to 30%, respectively. In conclusion, thermal treatments have clear effects on the contents of MRP in the diets. These compounds have relatively low digestibility in growing pigs."
https://openalex.org/W2847990796,"Fibromyalgia (FM) patients frequently complain of cognitive problems, but it remains unclear whether these cognitive complaints can be attributed to a dysfunction of the central nervous system or if they can be explained by other factors associated with the disease, such as depression, anxiety and sleep dysfunction.One hundred and ten patients with FM were compared with thirty-three patients diagnosed with a depressive disorder (DD) and fifty healthy controls (HC). Several measures of attention and executive functions were used to make these comparisons and the patients were also asked to complete questionnaires on depression, anxiety and sleep quality. Univariate analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were performed to identify and control confounders and multiple linear models were used to examine the effects of fibromyalgia and depression on cognitive measures.FM and HC differed significantly with respect to depression, anxiety and sleep dysfunction, whereas FM and DD did not differ in terms of symptoms of depression and anxiety. However, FM was associated with a worse quality of sleep than DD. Comparisons of cognitive performance between groups showed that short-term and working memory and inattention measures were only associated with symptoms of depression, whereas selective attention was associated with both depression and fibromyalgia, and processing speed, cognitive flexibility and inhibitory control showed a significant interaction between depression and fibromyalgia. Moreover, cognitive flexibility and inhibition abilities were specifically associated with FM.FM patients show a cluster of cognitive impairment in the attentional and executive domains, although some of the symptoms observed could be explained by the severity of the symptoms of depression, while others seem to depend on the effects of fibromyalgia. Implications of the findings for the understanding and management of cognitive impairment of FM patients are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2869030335,"Physiological processes and gross energy budget of the longline-cultured Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas were investigated in Geoje-Hansan Bay, Korea during two entire culturing periods. Based on physiological measurements of food consumption, feces production, ammonium excretion, and respiration from July 2008 to February 2009 and from July 2013 to February 2014, scope for growth appeared to be positive during most of the culturing period, except for one period with extremely high temperatures (up to 25°C). Estimates of physiological energy production matched well with tissue energy increment measured by gross biochemical composition during the culturing period, suggesting that the oysters might adjust their physiological performance to relatively low concentrations of suspended particulate matter in the bay to optimize energy acquisition. Such an adaptive adjustment includes an increased absorption of energy and a reduced loss of metabolic and excretory energy, resulting in positive production under high culturing density. Using physiological measurements, we further assessed the feedback effects of the longline aquaculture of oysters on the bay system. Ecological efficiency, estimated by a series of energetic efficiencies at the whole bay level, was low compared with Lindeman's law of trophic efficiency. Biodeposition and ammonia excretion rates in this study were relatively low compared with other intertidal plastic bag cultures. These results indicate that the cultured oysters might have only minor effects on benthic and pelagic environments of the bay. Overall, our results suggest that the adaptive physiological performance of oysters and consequently weak feedback effects on ambient habitats should facilitate sustainable longline aquaculture in the bay for a prolonged period without severe habitat deterioration."
https://openalex.org/W2821853620,"Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) can be efficiently transmitted to pigs via intracerebral inoculation. A clear link has been established between the consumption of products of bovine origin contaminated with the BSE agent and the development of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. Small ruminants can also naturally develop BSE, and sheep-adapted BSE (Sh-BSE) propagates more efficiently than cattle BSE in pigs and in mouse models expressing porcine prion protein. In addition, Sh-BSE shows greater efficiency of transmission to human models than original cow BSE. While infectivity and/or abnormal PrP accumulation have been reported in the central nervous system in BSE-infected pigs, the ability of the agent to replicate in peripheral tissues has not been fully investigated. We previously characterized the presence of prions in a panel of tissues collected at the clinical stage of disease from pigs experimentally infected with Sh-BSE. Western blot revealed low levels of PrPres accumulation in lymphoid tissues, nerves, and skeletal muscles from 4 of the 5 animals analysed. Using protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA), which we found to be 6 log fold more sensitive than direct WB for the detection of pig BSE, we confirmed the presence of the Sh-BSE agent in lymphoid organs, nerves, ileum, and striated muscles from all 5 inoculated pigs. Surprisingly, PrPres positivity was also detected in white blood cells from one pig using this method. The presence of infectivity in lymphoid tissues, striated muscles, and peripheral nerves was confirmed by bioassay in bovine PrP transgenic mice. These results demonstrate the ability of BSE-derived agents to replicate efficiently in various peripheral tissues in pigs. Although no prion transmission has been reported in pigs following oral BSE challenge, our data support the continuation of the Feed Ban measure implemented to prevent entry of the BSE agent into the feed chain."
https://openalex.org/W2825870794,"The southern region of Brazil is characterized by high species diversity and endemism of freshwater fishes distributed across geographically isolated river basins. Microglanis cottoides has a widespread range across these river basins and occurs in sympatry with other endemic species of the genus (e.g. M. cibelae, M. eurystoma, and M. malabarbai). Herein we tested the monophyly of M. cottoides and presented for the first time information about the molecular phylogeny of species in the genus. The results suggest that M. cottoides currently forms a non-monophyletic group which includes populations endemic to the Uruguay River basin that are more closely related to M. malabarbai, and excludes M. cibelae, found to be nested within M. cottoides. Based on an integrative approach using morphological and molecular data, we propose M. cibelae as a junior synonym of M. cottoides, and the populations of the Uruguay River basin previously assigned to M. cottoides in fact belong to M. malabarbai. Our molecular phylogeny shows that M. cottoides is sister to M. parahybae, which is also a coastal species, and M. malabarbai is sister of M. garavelloi, both endemic to inland river basins. The time-calibrated phylogeny indicates that the separation between inland and the coastal clades occurred in the Tertiary period, and that the species within the coastal basins diverged in the Pliocene, which overlaps with the diversification times estimated for the two inland species as well. This pattern of diversification corroborates some previous studies with other fishes from the same region."
https://openalex.org/W2844793865,"Using patient-reported experiences, this study: 1) quantitatively evaluated TTTS screening trends, 2) examined screening and diagnostic experiences using a mixed methods approach, and 3) determined gaps in clinical care experiences.This was a cross-sectional study. Data was collected using a self-report, retrospective survey. A triangulation design was used to validate quantitative survey data with thematically analyzed qualitative data.Participants were recruited through social media and national foundations and completed the survey online.Participants were 312 women who completed a TTTS pregnancy in the United States, representing the largest survey of participants who have experienced TTTS.Descriptive statistics and bivariate analyses were conducted. Multivariate logistic regression examined predictors of ultrasound frequency. Qualitative data were initially coded by hand and checked using qualitative software.The percentages of participants reporting guideline recommended screening, including identification of pregnancy type by gestational week 13 and timely receipt of ultrasounds, increased over time. However, 44.6% of participants diagnosed in recent years (2014 and later), reported that prior to TTTS diagnosis, they did not receive biweekly or more frequent ultrasounds. Three patient-reported provider practices were related to receiving ultrasounds at the recommended frequency: (1) determining MCDA status prior to gestational week 14, (2) providing participants with early warnings about the risk of TTTS to their pregnancies after MCDA status had been determined, and (3) referring participants to a Maternal-Fetal Medicine Specialist after MCDA identification, as validated by qualitative data. Our qualitative data revealed gaps in effective clinical care experiences among OB/GYN and specialist providers.These findings indicate screening and diagnosis for TTTS, as reported by patients, is improving in the United States; however, further efforts are required to ensure all patients receive appropriate screening, education and a team-based approach to comprehensive and supportive clinical care."
https://openalex.org/W2868872922,"We evaluated apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) histogram parameters for predicting the outcomes of patients with salivary gland carcinoma. Diffusion-weighted MR imaging was performed in 20 patients with salivary gland carcinoma, and ADCs were determined using b-values of 500 and 1000 s/mm2. ADC histogram parameters (mean, median, percentage tumor area with distinctive ADC values [pADC], skewness, and kurtosis) were analyzed. The patients were followed for 5–136 months after primary surgery. The ADC histogram parameters and T (pT), N(pN), and M categories of the primary tumors were assessed for the prognostic importance using Cox proportional hazards models, logistic regression analysis, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Cohen’s d was determined for evaluating the importance of differences in the parameters between two patient groups with different outcomes. Six patients died of cancer (DOC) within 3 years after the primary surgery. Cox proportional hazards models indicated that ADC mean (95% CI = 0.494–0.977, p = 0.034), ADC median (95% CI = 0.511–0.997, p = 0.048), pADC with extremely low (<0.6 mm2/s) ADC (95% CI = 1.013–1.082, p = 0.007), kurtosis (95% CI = 1.166–7.420, p = 0.023), and pN classification (95% CI = 1.196–4.836, p = 0.012) were important factors of cancer death risk. ROC analyses indicated that the pADC <0.6 ×10−3 mm2/s was the best prognostic predictor (p <0.001; AUC = 0.929) among the ADC and TNM classification parameters that were significant in a univariate logistic regression analysis. Cohen’s d values between the DOC and survived patients for the ADC mean, ADC median, pADC with extremely low ADC, and kurtosis were 1.06, 1.04, 2.12, and 1.13, respectively. These results suggest that ADC histogram analysis may be helpful for predicting the outcomes of patients with salivary gland carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2873818401,"A prominent theory of cell death in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) posits that the primary and pivotal step of irreversible cell injury is the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore. However, the predominantly positive evidence of protection against infarct afforded by the MPT inhibitor, Cyclosporine A (CsA), in experimental studies is in stark contrast with the overall lack of benefit found in clinical trials of CsA. One reason for the discrepancy might be the fact that relatively short experimental ischemic episodes (<1 hour) do not represent clinically-realistic durations, usually exceeding one hour. Here we tested the hypothesis that MPT is not the primary event of cell death after prolonged (60-80 min) episodes of global ischemia. We used confocal microcopy in Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts treated with the electromechanical uncoupler, 2,3-Butanedione monoxime (BDM, 20 mM) to allow tracking of MPT and sarcolemmal permeabilization (SP) in individual ventricular myocytes. The time of the steepest drop in fluorescence of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm)-sensitive dye, TMRM, was used as the time of MPT (TMPT). The time of 20% uptake of the normally cell-impermeable dye, YO-PRO1, was used as the time of SP (TSP). We found that during reperfusion MPT and SP were tightly coupled, with MPT trending slightly ahead of SP (TSP-TMPT = 0.76±1.31 min; p = 0.07). These coupled MPT/SP events occurred in discrete myocytes without crossing cell boundaries. CsA (0.2 μM) did not reduce the infarct size, but separated SP and MPT events, such that detectable SP was significantly ahead of MPT (TSP -TMPT = -1.75±1.28 min, p = 0.006). Mild permeabilization of cells with digitonin (2.5-20 μM) caused coupled MPT/SP events which occurred in discrete myocytes similar to those observed in Control and CsA groups. In contrast, deliberate induction of MPT by titration with H2O2 (200-800 μM), caused propagating waves of MPT which crossed cell boundaries and were uncoupled from SP. Taken together, these findings suggest that after prolonged episodes of ischemia, SP is the primary step in myocyte death, of which MPT is an immediate and unavoidable consequence."

https://openalex.org/W2861637145,"A key congressional spending panel has fired a shot across bow of two federally chartered medical foundations, warning them that way they disclose information about donors may not pass muster. It9s latest controversy involving traditionally low-profile foundations, which over past quarter-century have funneled nearly $2 billion to National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for research, clinical trials, training, and educational programs. When Congress created Foundation for National Institutes of Health and CDC Foundation in early 1990s to raise private funds to support federal biomedical and health research, it ordered them to report the source and amount of all gifts they receive, as well as any restrictions on how donations could be used. But legislators on House of Representatives appropriations subcommittee that oversees NIH and CDC are worried foundations may not be following those rules."

But by combining light from the spreadout telescopes, it is expected to make out small structures on stellar surfaces, image dust around newborn stars, and peer at supermassive black holes in active galaxies.

https://openalex.org/W2868940794,"The United States Veterans Health Administration (VHA) serves more than 9 million enrolled Veterans each year. Although most of the care that the VHA sponsors is delivered within its own facilities, there has been a call for ""privatizing"" some or all of these services. Under such an arrangement, the Department of Veterans Affairs would pay non-VHA providers to deliver care in facilities open to the general public. Privatization is hotly contested on political grounds and is not resolved. Yet the question whether the VHA should be privatized cannot be resolved without first establishing that this policy change is even feasible. One potential obstacle to privatization would be the lack of nearby alternative facilities to deliver care. To assess for the presence of this impediment, we used Google Maps to measure the travel time between 167 VA hospitals and the teaching hospital nearest to each of them. We determined that the mean travel time between VA hospitals and their nearest teaching hospital was approximately 18 minutes with a median of 10 minutes. All but nine VA facilities were within two hours' travel, and these nine within ten minutes' travel to a tertiary care, nonteaching hospital. These data do not definitively resolve the privatization debate, of course, but do refute the assertion that inpatient VA services cannot be privatized because replacement hospitals are too far away. As shown, that is simply not the case."
