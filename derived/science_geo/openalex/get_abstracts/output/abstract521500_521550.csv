Despite the adverse clinical impact of cancer-induced muscle wasting, pathways causing cachexia are controversial, and clinically reliable therapies are not available. A trigger of muscle protein loss is the Jak/Stat pathway, and indeed, we found that conditioned medium from C26 colon carcinoma (C26) or Lewis lung carcinoma cells activates Stat3 (p-Stat3) in C2C12 myotubes. We identified two proteolytic pathways that are activated in muscle by p-Stat3; one is activation of caspase-3, and the other is p-Stat3 to myostatin, MAFbx/Atrogin-1, and MuRF-1 via CAAT/enhancer-binding protein δ (C/EBPδ). Using sequential deletions of the caspase-3 promoter and CHIP assays, we determined that Stat3 activation increases caspase-3 expression in C2C12 cells. Caspase-3 expression and proteolytic activity were stimulated by p-Stat3 in muscles of tumor-bearing mice. In mice with cachexia caused by Lewis lung carcinoma or C26 tumors, knock-out of p-Stat3 in muscle or with a small chemical inhibitor of p-Stat3 suppressed muscle mass losses, improved protein synthesis and degradation in muscle, and increased body weight and grip strength. Activation of p-Stat3 stimulates a pathway from C/EBPδ to myostatin and expression of MAFbx/Atrogin-1 and increases the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Indeed, C/EBPδ KO decreases the expression of MAFbx/Atrogin-1 and myostatin, while increasing muscle mass and grip strength. In conclusion, cancer stimulates p-Stat3 in muscle, activating protein loss by stimulating caspase-3, myostatin, and the ubiquitin-proteasome system. These results could lead to novel strategies for preventing cancer-induced muscle wasting."
https://openalex.org/W2094936374,"Recent studies have indicated the potential clinical use of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) as a tool in assisting the diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD); however, it is still unclear whether NIRS signal changes during cognitive task are state- or trait-dependent, and whether NIRS could be a neural predictor of treatment response. Therefore, we conducted a longitudinal study to explore frontal haemodynamic changes following antidepressant treatment in medication-naïve MDD using 52-channel NIRS. This study included 25 medication-naïve individuals with MDD and 62 healthy controls (HC). We performed NIRS scans before and after antidepressant treatment and measured changes of [oxy-Hb] activation during a verbal fluency task (VFT) following treatment. Individuals with MDD showed significantly decreased [oxy-Hb] values during a VFT compared with HC in the bilateral frontal and temporal cortices at baseline. There were no [oxy-Hb] changes between pre- and post-antidepressant treatment time points in the MDD cohort despite significant improvement in depressive symptoms. There was a significant association between mean [oxy-Hb] values during a VFT at baseline and improvement in depressive symptoms following treatment in the bilateral inferior frontal and middle temporal gyri in MDD. These findings suggest that hypofrontality response to a VFT may represent a potential trait marker for depression rather than a state marker. Moreover, the correlation analysis indicates that the NIRS signals before the initiation of treatment may be a biological marker to predict patient's clinical response to antidepressant treatment. The present study provides further evidence to support a potential application of NIRS for the diagnosis and treatment of depression."

Herein, we investigate the actions of macrophages and T cells through glucocorticoid-induced tumor neurosis factor receptor ligand (GITRL) and its receptor (GITR) in neuropathic pain. After partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSL) in enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) chimeric mice generated by the transplantation of eGFP+ bone marrow cells, eGFP+ macrophages, and T cells markedly migrated to the injured site after PSL. Administration of agents to deplete macrophages (liposome-clodronate and Clophosome-ATM) or T cells (anti-CD4 antibody and FTY720) could suppress PSL-induced thermal hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia. The expression levels of co-stimulatory molecules GITRL and GITR were increased on infiltrating macrophages and T cells, respectively. The perineural injection of a GITRL neutralizing antibody that could inhibit the function of the GITRL-GITR pathway attenuated PSL-induced neuropathic pain. Additionally, the induction of inflammatory cytokines and the accumulation of GITR+ T cells in the injured SCN were abrogated after macrophage depletion by Clophosome-ATM. In conclusion, GITRL expressed on macrophages drives cytokine release and T cell activation, resulting in neuropathic pain via GITR-dependent actions. The GITRL-GITR pathway might represent a novel target for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Peripheral neuroinflammation caused by activated immune cells can provoke neuropathic pain.

The GITRL-GITR pathway might represent a novel target for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Neuronal damage to the central and peripheral nervous systems often leads to neuropathic pain, which is characterized by tactile allodynia, hyperalgesia, and spontaneous pain. The underlying mechanism of neuropathic pain is highly complex and current analgesic drugs, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioid analgesics, are not effective (1Baron R. Mechanisms of disease: neuropathic pain, a clinical perspective.Nat. Clin. Pract. Neurol. 2006; 2: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 2Campbell J.N. Meyer R.A. Mechanisms of neuropathic pain.Neuron. 2006; 52: 77-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). To develop novel therapeutic strategies, an improved understanding of the mechanisms that drive neuropathic pain is required. Growing evidence indicates that several types of immune cells play crucial roles in chronic neuroinflammation associated with neuropathic pain (3Marchand F. Perretti M. McMahon S.B. Role of the immune system in chronic pain.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar, 4Calvo M. Dawes J.M. Bennett D.L.

The neuropathic pain triad: neurons, immune cells and glia.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1361-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). Neuronal damage induces the migration of immune cells, such as macrophages, neutrophils, and T-lymphocytes (T cells), and these cells release inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α) and chemokines (e.g. monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), triggering chronic neuroinflammation (6Thacker M.A. Clark A.K. Marchand F. McMahon S.B. Pathophysiology of peripheral neuropathic pain: immune cells and molecules.Anesth. Analg. 2007; 105: 838-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that macrophage inflammatory proteins, which are types of chemokines, are released by activated macrophages and neutrophils following peripheral nerve injury and contribute to the development of neuropathic pain (7Kiguchi N. Maeda T. Kobayashi Y. Fukazawa Y. Kishioka S.

Pain. 2012; 16: 1271-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Because chemokines can stimulate various types of immune cells, we hypothesized that communication among immune cells promotes neuroinflammation through cytokine and chemokine networks and amplifies pain sensitivity under conditions of neuropathic pain. It is well known that transmembrane immunomodulatory molecules expressed by immune cells can co-stimulate or co-inhibit cell interactions. Glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor ligand (GITRL) 2The abbreviations used are:GITRLglucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor ligandGITRglucocorticoid-induced TNF receptorPSLpartial sciatic nerve ligationBMTbone marrow transplantationTgtransgeniceGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinSCNsciatic nervePMperitoneal macrophageTregregulatory T cell. is a membrane-associated protein, which is mainly expressed on membrane surfaces of antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells. GITRL acts on its receptor (glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor, GITR; also known as TNFRSF18) (10Nocentini G. Giunchi L. Ronchetti S. Krausz L.T. Bartoli A. Moraca R. Migliorati G. Riccardi C.

Biol. 1999; 9: 215-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Activation of the GITRL-GITR pathway enhances T cell proliferation and cytokine production via the T cell receptor (12Shevach E.M. Stephens G.L. The GITR-GITRL interaction: co-stimulation or contrasuppression of regulatory activity?.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The expression of GITR is constitutively low in naive T cells, but becomes increased in activated T cells. Notably, GITR is widely expressed in CD4+ T cells and its function varies among T cell subsets (12Shevach E.M. Stephens G.L. The GITR-GITRL interaction: co-stimulation or contrasuppression of regulatory activity?.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Stimulation of GITR in CD4+ effector T cells can enhance cytokine production (e.g. interferon-γ and IL-2), whereas GITR stimulation in regulatory T (Treg) cells can suppress excessive immune responses. Hence, the GITRL-GITR pathway has been considered to be important for regulating both innate and adaptive immune responses. Inhibition of the GITRL-GITR pathway prevented the development of autoimmune diabetes and carrageenan-induced acute lung inflammation in mice (13Cuzzocrea S. Nocentini G. Di Paola R. Agostini M.

However, no studies have yet reported the involvement of the GITRL-GITR pathway in peripheral neuroinflammation induced by nerve injury.

This study complied with the Ethical Guidelines of the International Association for the Study of Pain. All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Research Committee of Wakayama Medical University (approval no. 567, Wakayama, Japan). Male mice of the Institute of Cancer Research strain that were 4 or 5 weeks old and weighed 18–25 g were purchased from Nihon SLC (Hamamatsu, Japan) and used for all experiments, except for analyses using bone marrow transplantation (BMT). For BMT, male C57BL/6-Tg (CAG-EGFP) C14-Y01-FM131Osb transgenic (Tg) mice carrying an eGFP allele were obtained from the RIKEN Bioresource Center (Tsukuba, Japan). Wild-type (WT; C57BL/6J) mice were purchased from Nihon SLC. All mice were housed under controlled ambient temperature (23–24 °C, 60–70% relative humidity) and light (lights were on from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.) conditions at our institutional vivarium, and had ad libitum access to water and food. To induce neuropathic pain, mice were subjected to a PSL operation, as described previously (15Seltzer Z. Dubner R. Shir Y.

Briefly, under sodium pentobarbital (70 mg/kg) anesthesia, ∼1/2 of the sciatic nerve (SCN) thickness was tightly ligated with a silk suture (No. 1, Natsume Seisakusho Co., Tokyo, Japan). In the sham control operations, the SCN was first exposed and then closed without ligation. Clodronate disodium salt (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA), Clophosome-ATM (FormuMax Scientific, Palo Alto, CA), FTY720 (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI), anti-CD4 antibody (anti-CD4 Ab; CEDARLANE Laboratories, Burlington, Ontario, Canada), and anti-GITR ligand/TNFSF18 antibody (anti-GITRL Ab; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were used. Clodronate disodium salt was dissolved in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and encapsulated by mixing with COATSOME EL-01-C (NOF Co., Tokyo, Japan) at room temperature to prepare liposome-clodronate. Clophosome-ATM is a commercially available liposome-clodronate reagent and was used without dilution. FTY720 was dissolved in PBS containing 20% dimethyl sulfoxide. Liposome-clodronate, Clophosome-ATM, anti-CD4 antibody, and FTY720 were systemically injected. Liposome-clodronate (1 mg in 0.2 ml) was intravenously injected twice (1 day before PSL and 4 days after PSL), and Clophosome-ATM (0.1 ml) was intravenously injected once (1 day before PSL). Anti-CD4 Ab (diluted 1:5) with PBS or control IgG (as a control) was intravenously injected twice (12 and 17 days before PSL) according to a standard protocol described by the manufacturer. FTY720 (0.1 mg/kg) or PBS (containing 20% dimethyl sulfoxide) was intraperitoneally injected once per day for 8 days (days 0–7) after PSL. The administration schedule and dose of FTY720 were similar to those of previous reports (17Coste O. Pierre S. Marian C. Brenneis C. Angioni C. Schmidt H. Popp L. Geisslinger G. Scholich K.

Clophosome-ATM or anti-GITRL Ab was perineurally injected, as described in our previous report (7Kiguchi N. Maeda T. Kobayashi Y. Fukazawa Y. Kishioka S.

A total of 10 μl of Clophosome-ATM was injected four times early (just after PSL and days 2, 4, and 6 after PSL) or late (days 7, 9, 11, and 13 after PSL) in the disease model. A total of 10 μl of anti-GITRL Ab or control IgG was injected five times at 3-day intervals (just after PSL and on days 3, 6, 9, and 12 after PSL). We generated eGFP-chimeric mice using BMT as described previously (19Okada Y. Reinach P.S. Shirai K. Kitano A. Kao W.W. Flanders K.C. Miyajima M. Liu H. Zhang J. Saika S.

After euthanasia by decapitation, femurs isolated from donor eGFP-transgenic mice were centrifuged in microtubes, and the obtained pellet was suspended in sterile PBS. Recipient WT mice received whole body irradiation with 10 gray for 25 min. A total of 2 × 105 BM cells derived from eGFP-transgenic mice were transplanted into recipient mice by tail vein injection. Then, 3 weeks later, the success of BMT was confirmed by phenotyping peripheral leukocytes collected from tail vein blood. PSL-induced thermal hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia were evaluated by the Hargreaves test and the von Frey test, respectively, as described previously (7Kiguchi N. Maeda T. Kobayashi Y.

A new and sensitive method for measuring thermal nociception in cutaneous hyperalgesia.Pain. 1988; 32: 77-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4308) Google Scholar). In the Hargreaves test, paw withdrawal latency from radiant heat was measured. Withdrawal latencies were measured three times for each hind paw, and the mean latency time was calculated to evaluate thermal hyperalgesia. In the von Frey test, withdrawal responses were measured using two von Frey filaments (0.07 or 0.16 g). The von Frey filament was applied to the middle of the planter surface of the hind paw and withdrawal responses were measured 10 times for each hind paw. The number of withdrawal responses to mechanical stimulation was calculated. The 50% withdrawal threshold was measured using von Frey filaments of 0.04, 0.07, 0.16, 0.4, and 0.6 g. The percent response to five mechanical stimulations with each filament was converted to a probit value, and the 50% value was evaluated on a linear probit curve using GraphPad Prism 3 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Behavioral pain assessments were confirmed by several experimenters to avoid bias. In all behavioral tests, mice received both PSL (left hind paw) and sham (right hind paw) treatment regimens. The PSL-operated hind paw was defined as the ipsilateral side, and the sham-operated hind paw was defined as the contralateral side. The both hind paws were tested using the Hargreaves and von Frey tests. Perineurally injected test and control drugs were administered bilaterally (ipsilateral side and contralateral side), and then each pain threshold was assessed. SCN sections were prepared as we described previously (7Kiguchi N. Maeda T. Kobayashi Y. Fukazawa Y. Kishioka S.

Sections were incubated with specific primary antibodies against F4/80 (a macrophage marker, 1:200; CEDARLANE), CD4 (a T cell marker, 1:50; BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA), GITRL (1:50; Abcam Inc., Cambridge, UK), or GITR (1:100; R&D Systems) at 4 °C overnight. Antibodies were diluted in reaction buffer (1% bovine serum albumin and 0.025% PBS-Tween (PBS-T)). Sections were washed with 0.1% PBS-T and incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescent markers (Alexa Fluor-488 or Alexa Fluor-594, 1:200; Invitrogen) for 2 h at room temperature, followed by nuclear staining using Hoechst 33342 solution (1:1000; Invitrogen). A coverslip with Perma Fluor (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was placed over the sections and immunoreactivity was detected using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Mice were euthanized and SCNs, and peritoneal macrophages (PMs) were freshly isolated. The isolated SCN was cut into 10-mm long sections. To collect PMs from naive mice, an incision was made in the peritoneal membrane and 5 ml of ice-cold sterile PBS containing 1% penicillin-streptomycin was slowly injected into the peritoneal cavity through the incision site. After flushing the peritoneal cavity, PMs were collected and centrifuged (1000 rpm for 2 min). To seed PMs, the cell density was adjusted to 3–5 × 106 cells/ml, and cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Total RNA was purified from the isolated SCN and PMs using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and then 1 μg of total RNA was converted to complementary DNA (10 ng/ml) by room temperature. The resulting complementary DNA was used as a template for quantitative real-time PCR with the KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR kit (KAPA Biosystems, Boston, MA) using the ECOTM Real-Time PCR System (ASONE, Osaka, Japan). For semiquantitative PCR, GoTaq DNA polymerase (Promega) and a mixture of deoxynucleoside 5′-triphosphates (Promega) were used. PCR products were visualized by ethidium bromide staining after electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel. The fluorescence intensities of PCR products were analyzed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and were normalized based on Gapdh expression levels. Data are presented as expression ratios compared with those of Gapdh.

After intravenous injection of liposome-clodronate or Clophosome-ATM according to administration schedule described under the “Drug Administration,” PMs were isolated from PSL-operated mice on days 4 or 7 after PSL. To stain macrophages, a single-cell suspension (1 × 106 cells) was incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-CD11b Ab, FITC-conjugated anti-CD14 Ab or phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-F4/80 Ab (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) in reaction buffer (1% fetal bovine serum and 0.05% NaN3 in DMEM) for 30 min at 4 °C. FTY720 or PBS (containing 20% dimethyl sulfoxide) was administered according to the administration schedule described under the “Drug Administration.” For isolation of T cells, peripheral blood was collected from the ophthalmic venous plexus on day 7 after PSL. Then, T cells were separated from peripheral blood cells using Lympholyte®-mammal (CEDARLANE). To stain T cells, a single-cell suspension (1 × 106 cells) was incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-CD4 Ab and phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD25 Ab (eBioscience) in reaction buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. After staining, cells were washed and resuspended in PBS containing 1% fetal bovine serum and 0.05% NaN3. Data were acquired using a FACS Aria flow cytometer and analyzed using BD FACS Diva software (all from BD Bioscience). Appropriately sized samples for each experiment were based on our previous report (7Kiguchi N. Maeda T. Kobayashi Y. Fukazawa Y. Kishioka S.

We used all data obtained from each experiment, and performed randomization methods in all experiments. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. in all graphs. Data for gene expression generated using RT-PCR (Figs. 1, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 8) and behavioral data from day 7 after nerve injury (Fig. 9) were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance, followed by post hoc Tukey's test. Time course data for behavioral experiments (Figs. 3, 5, 7, and 9) were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance with repeated measurements to detect interactions between drug treatments and different time points. After confirming statistical significance, Bonferroni multiple comparison tests were performed for intergroup comparisons and time point comparisons. The results of cell measurements (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 10) were analyzed using an unpaired Student's t test (two-tailed).

https://openalex.org/W2061658657,"Objectives This paper discusses patterns of daily smokeless tobacco (SLT) use and correlates of poly SLT use among married women aged 18–40 years in a Mumbai slum community with implications for tobacco control. Methods Using a mixed methods approach, the study included a structured survey with 409 daily SLT users and in-depth interviews with 42 women. Participants for the survey were selected using a systematic sampling procedure (one woman in every fourth eligible household). Univariate and bivariate analysis, and multiple logistic regressions were conducted to identify demographic and social factors associated with women’s use of poly SLT products. To illustrate survey results, in-depth interviews were analyzed using Atlas ti software. Results Sixty-four percent of the women surveyed used only one type of SLT; of these, 30% used mishri, 32% used pan with tobacco and the rest used chewed tobacco (11%), gul (17%) or gutkha (10%). Thirty-six percent used more than one type of SLT. Poly SLT users chewed or rubbed 50% more tobacco as compared to single users (mean consumption of tobacco per day: 9.54 vs. 6.49 grams; p<0.001). Women were more likely to be poly SLT users if they were illiterate as compared to literate (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=1.67; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.07-2.71), if they had lived in Mumbai for 10 years or more, versus less than ten years (AOR=1.67, 95% CI=1.03-2.71); and if their husband was a poly SLT user as compared to a non SLT user (AOR=2.78, 95% CI=1.63-4.76). No differences were noted between pregnant and non-pregnant women in SLT consumption patterns. Conclusions Tobacco control policies and programs must focus specifically on both social context and use patterns to address SLT use among women of reproductive age with special attention to poly SLT users, an understudied and vulnerable population."
https://openalex.org/W2059598508,"Biosorption is a promising alternative method to replace the existing conventional technique for Cr(VI) removal from the industrial effluent. In the present experimental design, the removal of Cr(VI) from the aqueous solution was studied by Aspergillus niger MSR4 under different environmental conditions in the batch systems. The optimum conditions of biosorption were determined by investigating pH (2.0) and temperature (27°C). The effects of parameters such as biomass dosage (g/L), initial Cr(VI) concentration (mg/L) and contact time (min) on Cr(VI) biosorption were analyzed using a three parameter Box–Behnken design (BBD). The experimental data well fitted to the Langmuir isotherm, in comparison to the other isotherm models tested. The results of the D-R isotherm model suggested that a chemical ion-exchange mechanism was involved in the biosorption process. The biosorption process followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, which indicates that the rate limiting step is chemisorption process. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic studies revealed the possible involvement of functional groups, such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino and carbonyl group in the biosorption process. The thermodynamic parameters for Cr(VI) biosorption were also calculated, and the negative ∆Gº values indicated the spontaneous nature of biosorption process."
https://openalex.org/W1964623171,"Phthalates are ubiquitous industrial chemicals that have been associated with altered reproductive function in rodents. Several human studies have reported an inverse association between male testosterone and phthalate levels. Our aim was to investigate time to pregnancy (TTP) according to serum levels of diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) and diisononyl phthalate (DiNP) metabolites in both partners. In 2002-2004 we enrolled 938 pregnant women and 401 male spouses from Greenland, Poland and Ukraine. Six oxidized metabolites of DEHP and DiNP were summarized for each of the two parent compounds to provide proxies of the internal exposure. We used Cox discrete-time models to estimate fecundability ratios (FR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for men and women according to their proxy-DEHP or -DiNP serum levels adjusted for a fixed set of covariates. The FR was slightly elevated among women with high levels of DEHP (FR=1.14, 95% CI 1.00;1.30) suggesting a shorter TTP in these women. The FR was unrelated to DiNP in women, whereas the results for men were inconsistent pointing in opposite directions. First-time pregnant women from Greenland with high serum DiNP levels had a longer TTP. This study spanning large contrast in environmental exposure does not indicate adverse effects of phthalates on couple fecundity. The shorter TTP in women with high levels of DEHP metabolites is unexplained and needs further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2044128335,"Science education is progressively more focused on employing inquiry-based learning methods in the classroom and increasing scientific literacy among students. However, due to time and resource constraints, many classroom science activities and laboratory experiments focus on simple inquiry, with a step-by-step approach to reach predetermined outcomes. The science classroom inquiry (SCI) simulations were designed to give students real life, authentic science experiences within the confines of a typical classroom. The SCI simulations allow students to engage with a science problem in a meaningful, inquiry-based manner. Three discrete SCI simulations were created as website applications for use with middle school and high school students. For each simulation, students were tasked with solving a scientific problem through investigation and hypothesis testing. After completion of the simulation, 67% of students reported a change in how they perceived authentic science practices, specifically related to the complex and dynamic nature of scientific research and how scientists approach problems. Moreover, 80% of the students who did not report a change in how they viewed the practice of science indicated that the simulation confirmed or strengthened their prior understanding. Additionally, we found a statistically significant positive correlation between students' self-reported changes in understanding of authentic science practices and the degree to which each simulation benefitted learning. Since SCI simulations were effective in promoting both student learning and student understanding of authentic science practices with both middle and high school students, we propose that SCI simulations are a valuable and versatile technology that can be used to educate and inspire a wide range of science students on the real-world complexities inherent in scientific study."
https://openalex.org/W2045911618,"The membrane-proximal external region (MPER) C-terminal segment and the transmembrane domain (TMD) of gp41 are involved in HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein-mediated fusion and modulation of immune responses during viral infection. However, the atomic structure of this functional region remains unsolved. Here, based on the high resolution NMR data obtained for peptides spanning the C-terminal segment of MPER and the TMD, we report two main findings: (i) the conformational variability of the TMD helix at a membrane-buried position; and (ii) the existence of an uninterrupted α-helix spanning MPER and the N-terminal region of the TMD. Thus, our structural data provide evidence for the bipartite organization of TMD predicted by previous molecular dynamics simulations and functional studies, but they do not support the breaking of the helix at Lys-683, as was suggested by some models to mark the initiation of the TMD anchor. Antibody binding energetics examined with isothermal titration calorimetry and humoral responses elicited in rabbits by peptide-based vaccines further support the relevance of a continuous MPER-TMD helix for immune recognition. We conclude that the transmembrane anchor of HIV-1 envelope is composed of two distinct subdomains: 1) an immunogenic helix at the N terminus also involved in promoting membrane fusion; and 2) an immunosuppressive helix at the C terminus, which might also contribute to the late stages of the fusion process. The unprecedented high resolution structural data reported here may guide future vaccine and inhibitor developments."
https://openalex.org/W1991995202,"Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is an important modulator of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) through its role to degrade angiotensin (Ang) II. Depletion of kidney ACE2 occurs following kidney injury due to renal mass reduction and may contribute to progressive kidney disease. This study assessed the effect of diminazine aceturate (DIZE), which has been described as an ACE2 activator, on kidney ACE2 mRNA and activity in rats with kidney injury due to subtotal nephrectomy (STNx). Sprague Dawley rats were divided into Control groups or underwent STNx; rats then received vehicle or the DIZE (s.c. 15 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks. STNx led to hypertension (P<0.01), kidney hypertrophy (P<0.001) and impaired kidney function (P<0.001) compared to Control rats. STNx was associated with increased kidney cortical ACE activity, and reduced ACE2 mRNA in the cortex (P<0.01), with reduced cortical and medullary ACE2 activity (P<0.05), and increased urinary ACE2 excretion (P<0.05) compared to Control rats. Urinary ACE2 activity correlated positively with urinary protein excretion (P<0.001), and negatively with creatinine clearance (P=0.04). In STNx rats, DIZE had no effect on blood pressure or kidney function, but was associated with reduced cortical ACE activity (P<0.01), increased cortical ACE2 mRNA (P<0.05) and increased cortical and medullary ACE2 activity (P<0.05). The precise in vivo mechanism of action of DIZE is not clear, and its effects to increase ACE2 activity may be secondary to an increase in ACE2 mRNA abundance. In ex vivo studies, DIZE did not increase ACE2 activity in either Control or STNx kidney cortical membranes. It is not yet known if chronic administration of DIZE has long-term benefits to slow the progression of kidney disease."
https://openalex.org/W2025028739,"Background A subgroup of meningioma demonstrates clinical aggressive behavior. We set out to determine if the radiological parameters can predict histopathological aggressive meningioma, and propose a classification to predict survival and aggressive meningioma behavior. Methods A retrospective review of medical records was conducted for patients who underwent surgical resection of their convexity meningioma. WHO-2007 grading was used for histopathological diagnosis. Preoperative radiologic parameters were analyzed, each parameter was scored 0 or 1. Signal intensity on diffusion weighted MRI (DWI) (hyperintensity=1), heterogeneity on T1-weighted gadolinium enhanced MRI (heterogeneity=1), disruption of arachnoid at brain-tumor interface=1and peritumoral edema (PTE) on T2-weighted MRI (presence of PTE=1) and tumor shape (irregular shape=1). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine association of radiological parameters to histopathological grading. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models were used to determine the association of scoring system to overall survival and progression free survival (PFS). Reliability of the classification was tested using Kappa co-efficient analysis. Results Hyperintensity on DWI, disruption of arachnoid at brain-tumor interface, PTE, heterogenicitiy on T1-weighted enhanced MRI and irregular tumor shape were independent predictors of non-grade I meningioma. Mean follow-up period was 94.6 months (range, 12-117 months). Median survival and PFS in groups-I, II and III was 114.1±1.2 and 115.7± 0.8, 88± 3.3 and 58.5±3.9, 43.2± 5.1 and 18.2±1.7 months respectively. In cox regression analysis model, age (P<0.0001, OR–1.039, CI-1.017-0.062), WHO non-grade-I meningioma (P=0.017, OR–3.014, CI-1.217-7.465), radiological classification groups II (P=0.002, OR–6.194, CI–1.956-19.610) and III (P<0.0001, OR–21.658, CI–5.701-82.273) were independent predictors of unfavorable survival outcomes. Conclusions Preoperative radiological classification can be used as a supplement to the histopathological grading. Group-I meningiomas demonstrate benign radiological, histopathological and clinical features; group-III demonstrates aggressive features. Group-II meningiomas demonstrate intermediate features; the need for more aggressive follow-up and/or treatment should be further investigated."
https://openalex.org/W2099838297,"Populations of the once common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) in Argentina have precipitously declined throughout the country in the past decades. Unfortunately, local declines of common species are easily overlooked when establishing priorities for conservation. In this study, demographics of what may well be the last remaining resident population in the country were assessed using mark-recapture analysis (Pollock's Robust Design) of a photo-identification dataset collected during 2006-2011 in Bahía San Antonio (Patagonia, Argentina). Total abundance, corrected for unmarked individuals, ranged from 40 (95%CI: 16.1-98.8) to 83 (95%CI = 45.8-151.8) individuals and showed a decrease over the years. Adult survival rates varied between 0.97 (± 0.037 SE) and 0.99 (± 0.010 SE). Average calving interval equalled 3.5 ± 1.03 years, with 3.5 births/year in the entire population and a minimum annual birth rate of 4.2%. However, data suggest that calves may have been born and lost before being documented, underestimating birth rate, calf mortality, and possibly the number of reproductive females. Either way, the recruitment rate of calves appears to be insufficient to support the size of the population. This population is relatively small and declining. Considering the disappearance of populations north and south of the study area, an incessant decline will have severe consequences for the continuous existence of this species in Argentina, indicating an urgent need for serious conservation efforts. This study provides insight into how the failure to recognize local population declines can threaten the national (and eventually the international) status of a common species like the bottlenose dolphin."
https://openalex.org/W2055440944,"This study aimed to investigate the topological organization of intrinsic functional brain networks in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).Resting-state functional MRI data were collected from 22 patients with ESRD (16 men, 18-61 years) and 29 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs, 19 men, 32-61 years). Whole-brain functional networks were obtained by calculating the interregional correlation of low-frequency fluctuations in spontaneous brain activity among 1,024 parcels that cover the entire cerebrum. Weighted graph-based models were then employed to topologically characterize these networks at different global, modular and nodal levels.Compared to HCs, the patients exhibited significant disruption in parallel information processing over the whole networks (P < 0.05). The disruption was present in all the functional modules (default mode, executive control, sensorimotor and visual networks) although decreased functional connectivity was observed only within the default mode network. Regional analysis showed that the disease disproportionately weakened nodal efficiency of the default mode components and tended to preferentially affect central or hub-like regions. Intriguingly, the network abnormalities correlated with biochemical hemoglobin and serum calcium levels in the patients. Finally, the functional changes were substantively unchanged after correcting for gray matter atrophy in the patients.Our findings provide evidence for the disconnection nature of ESRD's brain and therefore have important implications for understanding the neuropathologic substrate of the disease from disrupted network organization perspective."
https://openalex.org/W2079309554,"Seabirds are often studied at individual colonies, but the confounding effects of emigration and mortality processes in open populations may lead to inappropriate conclusions on the mechanisms underlying population changes. Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) colonies of variable population sizes are distributed along the Argentine coastline. In recent decades, several population and distributional changes have occurred, with some colonies declining and others newly established or increasing. We integrated data of eight colonies scattered along ∼600 km in Northern Patagonia (from 41°26´S, 65°01´W to 45°11´S, 66°30´W, Rio Negro and Chubut provinces) and conducted analysis in terms of their growth rates, production of young and of the dependence of those vital rates on colony age, size, and location. We contrasted population trends estimated from abundance data with those derived from population modeling to understand if observed growth rates were attainable under closed population scenarios. Population trends were inversely related to colony size, suggesting a density dependent growth pattern. All colonies located in the north--which were established during the last decades--increased at high rates, with the smallest, recently established colonies growing at the fastest rate. In central-southern Chubut, where colonies are the oldest, the largest breeding aggregations declined, but smaller colonies remained relatively stable. Results provided strong evidence that dispersal played a major role in driving local trends. Breeding success was higher in northern colonies, likely mediated by favorable oceanographic conditions. However, mean foraging distance and body condition of chicks at fledging were influenced by colony size. Recruitment of penguins in the northern area may have been triggered by a combination of density dependence, likely exacerbated by less favorable oceanographic conditions in the southern sector. Our results reaffirm the idea that individual colony trends do not provide confident indicators of population health, highlighting the need to redefine the scale for the study of population changes."

Don. has been used conventionally by many communities in the Himalayan region for the management of gastrointestinal, respiratory, and vascular complications. Set against this background, this study was carried out to justify the scientific basis to validate folkloric uses of fruits of Pyrus pashia Buch.-Ham. ex D. Don. (Pp.Cr) in traditional systems of medicine. Methods The crude ethanol extract of fruits of Pyrus pashia Buch.-Ham. ex D. Don. (Pp.Cr) was tested in vitro on isolated rabbit jejunum, tracheal, and aorta preparations. The responses of tissues were recorded using isotonic transducers coupled with a PowerLab data acquisition system. Results The Pp.Cr on application (0.01–5.0 mg/ml) to isolated rabbit jejunum preparation exhibited relaxation through decrease in magnitude and frequency of spontaneous contractions. The Pp.Cr also exerted a relaxant (0.01–5.0 mg/ml) effect on K+(80 mM) induced contractions in isolated rabbit jejunum preparations and caused shifting of the Ca2+ curves (1.0–3.0 mg/ml) toward right in a manner similar to that of verapamil (3μM), possibly suggesting presence of Ca2+ channel blocking activity. Subsequently, Pp.Cr in a concentration-dependent fashion (0.01–10.0 mg/ml) caused relaxation of CCh (1μM) and K+ (80 mM) induced contractions in isolated rabbit tracheal preparations in a manner comparable to that of dicyclomine, suggesting that the observed relaxant effect is likely to be mediated through antimuscarinic and/or Ca2+ channel blocking activities. Moreover, when evaluated against isolated rabbit aortic preparations, the Pp.Cr in concentrations up to 10 mg/ml exhibited a contractile response that was found to be abolished subsequent to pretreatment of isolated tissue preparation with cyproheptadine (1μM), phentolamine (1μM), and losartan (1μM), suggesting that Pp.Cr may have some α-adrenergic, muscarinic, serotonergic, and angiotensin II activities. Conclusions The aqueous ethanolic extract of Pyrus pashia (Pp.Cr) exhibited spasmolytic, bronchodilator, and vaso-constrictive activities possibly through different mechanisms. The spasmolytic and bronchodilator activities are likely to be mediated through blockade of Ca2+ channels, while vasoconstrictive activity may be due to presence of a α-adrenergic, muscarinic, serotonergic, and angiotensin II agonistic component."
https://openalex.org/W1974298740,"The epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) functions as a pathway for Na+ absorption in the kidney and lung, where it is crucial for Na+ homeostasis and blood pressure regulation. ENaC is regulated in part through signaling pathways that control the ubiquitination state of ENaC lysines. A defect in ubiquitination causes Liddle syndrome, an inherited form of hypertension. Here we determined that α-, β-, and γENaC are also substrates for lysine acetylation. Trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, enhanced ENaC acetylation and increased ENaC abundance in the total cell lysate and at the cell surface. Moreover, TSA increased ENaC current in Fischer rat thyroid and kidney collecting duct epithelia. We found that HDAC7 is expressed in the kidney collecting duct, supporting a potential role for this histone deacetylase in ENaC regulation. HDAC7 overexpression reduced ENaC abundance and ENaC current, whereas ENaC abundance and current were increased by silencing of HDAC7. ENaC and HDAC7 form a complex, as detected by coimmunoprecipitation. We observed a reciprocal relationship between acetylation and ubiquitination; TSA reduced ENaC ubiquitination, whereas HDAC7 increased ubiquitination. By reducing ENaC ubiquitination, TSA decreased the rate of ENaC degradation. Thus, acetylation increases epithelial Na+ absorption by antagonizing ENaC ubiquitination. This stabilizes ENaC, and hence, increases its abundance at the cell surface."

Data collected from 3,408 men and 3,361 women aged ≥ 40 years were obtained from the 2010 and 2011 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Based on the World Health Organization guidelines, the participants were categorized into zones I (0–7), II (8–15), III (16–19), or IV (20–40) according to their Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) scores, with a higher zone indicating a higher level of alcohol consumption. Data collected from the AUDIT and EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D) test were subjected to multiple regression analysis in order to examine the relationship between alcohol consumption patterns and health-related quality of life, and to identify intersex and interzone differences. Significant intersex differences were found for the mean total AUDIT and EQ-5D scores and the proportion of participants rating their pain/discomfort and impairment in mobility and usual activities as “moderate” or “severe” (p < 0.001). The analysis of the EQ-5D scores by alcohol consumption pattern and sex suggested the existence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between the total AUDIT and EQ-5D scores. The HRQOL of moderate alcohol drinkers was higher than that of non-drinkers and heavy drinkers. The results of this study will be valuable in designing appropriate interventions to increase the HRQOL impaired by the harmful use of alcohol, in comparing HRQOL among different countries, and in implementing alcohol-related health projects."
https://openalex.org/W2060619274,"Contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) is a mode of inter-bacterial competition mediated by the CdiB/CdiA family of two-partner secretion systems. CdiA binds to receptors on susceptible target bacteria, then delivers a toxin domain derived from its C-terminus. Studies with Escherichia coli suggest the existence of multiple CDI growth-inhibition pathways, whereby different systems exploit distinct target-cell proteins to deliver and activate toxins. Here, we explore the CDI pathway in Burkholderia using the CDIIIBp1026b system encoded on chromosome II of Burkholderia pseudomallei 1026b as a model. We took a genetic approach and selected Burkholderia thailandensis E264 mutants that are resistant to growth inhibition by CDIIIBp1026b. We identified mutations in three genes, BTH_I0359, BTH_II0599, and BTH_I0986, each of which confers resistance to CDIIIBp1026b. BTH_I0359 encodes a small peptide of unknown function, whereas BTH_II0599 encodes a predicted inner membrane transport protein of the major facilitator superfamily. The inner membrane localization of BTH_II0599 suggests that it may facilitate translocation of CdiA-CTIIBp1026b toxin from the periplasm into the cytoplasm of target cells. BTH_I0986 encodes a putative transglycosylase involved in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis. ∆BTH_I0986 mutants have altered LPS structure and do not interact with CDI+ inhibitor cells to the same extent as BTH_I0986+ cells, suggesting that LPS could function as a receptor for CdiAIIBp1026b. Although ∆BTH_I0359, ∆BTH_II0599, and ∆BTH_I0986 mutations confer resistance to CDIIIBp1026b, they provide no protection against the CDIE264 system deployed by B. thailandensis E264. Together, these findings demonstrate that CDI growth-inhibition pathways are distinct and can differ significantly even between closely related species."
https://openalex.org/W1967547967,"Background The hormone auxin plays an important role not only in the growth and development of rice, but also in its defense responses. We’ve previously shown that the P450 gene CYP71Z2 enhances disease resistance to pathogens through regulation of phytoalexin biosynthesis in rice, though it remains unclear if auxin is involved in this process or not. Methodology and Principal Findings The expression of CYP71Z2 was induced by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) inoculation was analyzed by qRT-PCR, with GUS histochemical staining showing that CYP71Z2 expression was limited to roots, blades and nodes. Overexpression of CYP71Z2 in rice durably and stably increased resistance to Xoo, though no significant difference in disease resistance was detected between CYP71Z2-RNA interference (RNAi) rice and wild-type. Moreover, IAA concentration was determined using the HPLC/electrospray ionization/tandem mass spectrometry system. The accumulation of IAA was significantly reduced in CYP71Z2-overexpressing rice regardless of whether plants were inoculated or not, whereas it was unaffected in CYP71Z2-RNAi rice. Furthermore, the expression of genes related to IAA, expansin and SA/JA signaling pathways was suppressed in CYP71Z2-overexpressing rice with or without inoculation. Conclusions and Significance These results suggest that CYP71Z2-mediated resistance to Xoo may be via suppression of IAA signaling in rice. Our studies also provide comprehensive insight into molecular mechanism of resistance to Xoo mediated by IAA in rice. Moreover, an available approach for understanding the P450 gene functions in interaction between rice and pathogens has been provided."
https://openalex.org/W2028132950,"ADAMTSs are a family of secreted proteinases that share the metalloproteinase domain with matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). By acting on a large panel of extracellular substrates, they control several cell functions such as fusion, adhesion, proliferation and migration. Through their thrombospondin motifs they also possess anti-angiogenic properties. We investigated whether ADAMTSs participate in colorectal cancer progression and invasion. Their expression was investigated at both mRNA and protein levels. Using RT-PCR, the expression of ADAMTS-1, -4, -5 and ADAMTS-20 was estimated in colorectal tumors of different cancer stage and anatomic site and 3 cell lines of different aggressiveness. An overexpression of ADAMTS-4 and -5 was observed, especially in tissue samples, whereas ADAMTS-1 and -20 were found to be down-regulated. Western blot analysis further supported the RT-PCR findings, revealing in addition the degradation of ADAMTS-1 and -20 in cancer. In situ expression and localization of ADAMTS-1, -4, -5 and -20 was also investigated by immunohistochemical analysis. Our data suggest a positive correlation between ADAMTS-4 and -5 expression and cancer progression, in contrast with the anti-angiogenic members of the family, ADAMTS-1 and -20, which were found to be down-regulated. Our findings support the notion that overexpression of ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 in colorectal cancer might be a possible invasive mechanism of cancer cells in order to degrade proteoglycans of ECM."

Methods Data from the 2011 Mozambican Demographic and Health Survey on women who are married or living together are analyzed for the entire country and also for the rural and urban areas separately. We used single level and multilevel probit regression models. Findings A single level probit regression reveals that region, religion, age, previous fertility, education, and wealth impact contraceptive behavior. The multilevel analysis shows that average community wealth and the women’s relative socioeconomic position within the community have significant positive effects on the use of modern contraceptives. The multilevel framework proved to be necessary in rural settings but not relevant in urban areas. Moreover, the contextual effects due to community wealth are greater in rural than in urban areas and this feature is associated with the higher socioeconomic heterogeneity within the richest communities. Conclusion This analysis highlights the need for the studies on contraceptive behavior to specifically address the individual and contextual effects arising from the poverty-wealth dimension in rural and urban areas separately. The inclusion in a particular community of residence is not relevant in urban areas, but it is an important feature in rural areas. Although the women's individual position within the community of residence has a similar effect on contraceptive adoption in rural and urban settings, the impact of community wealth is greater in rural areas and smaller in urban areas."
https://openalex.org/W2073201595,"Psycholinguistic studies of sign language processing provide valuable opportunities to assess whether language phenomena, which are primarily studied in spoken language, are fundamentally shaped by peripheral biology. For example, we know that when given a choice between two syntactically permissible ways to express the same proposition, speakers tend to choose structures that were recently used, a phenomenon known as syntactic priming. Here, we report two experiments testing syntactic priming of a noun phrase construction in American Sign Language (ASL). Experiment 1 shows that second language (L2) signers with normal hearing exhibit syntactic priming in ASL and that priming is stronger when the head noun is repeated between prime and target (the lexical boost effect). Experiment 2 shows that syntactic priming is equally strong among deaf native L1 signers, deaf late L1 learners, and hearing L2 signers. Experiment 2 also tested for, but did not find evidence of, phonological or semantic boosts to syntactic priming in ASL. These results show that despite the profound differences between spoken and signed languages in terms of how they are produced and perceived, the psychological representation of sentence structure (as assessed by syntactic priming) operates similarly in sign and speech."

IGFBP-2 binds to receptor tyrosine phosphatase β (RPTPβ), and this binding in conjunction with IGF-I receptor stimulation induces RPTPβ polymerization leading to phosphatase and tensin homolog inactivation, AKT stimulation, and enhanced cell proliferation. To determine the mechanism by which RPTPβ polymerization is regulated, we analyzed the protein(s) that associated with RPTPβ in response to IGF-I and IGFBP-2 in vascular smooth muscle cells.

Significance: This study demonstrates how these two receptor systems collaborate to obtain optimal IGF-I signal transduction.

Our recent studies demonstrated that IGFBP-2 significantly enhanced the ability of IGF-I to stimulate vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and preosteoblast differentiation (8.DeMambro V.E.

Biol. 2012; 32: 4116-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We further determined that IGFBP-2 binding to the specific cell surface receptor RPTPβ was required to mediate these effects (9.Shen X. Xi G. Maile L.A. Wai C. Rosen C.J. Clemmons D.R. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein 2 functions coordinately with receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase β and the IGF-I receptor to regulate IGF-I-stimulated signaling.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2012; 32: 4116-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Knockdown of RPTPβ resulted in an inability of IGFBP-2 to stimulate these responses. Following RPTPβ polymerization, its phosphatase activity is inhibited. Utilization of a substrate-trapping mutant showed that the primary target of RPTPβ was PTEN and that RPTPβ polymerization was associated with enhanced PTEN tyrosine phosphorylation (9.Shen X. Xi G. Maile L.A. Wai C. Rosen C.J. Clemmons D.R.

Therefore stimulation of RPTPβ polymerization following exposure to IGFBP-2 and IGF-I resulted in enhanced VSMC migration. IGFBP-2 binding to RPTPβ is also required for IGF-I to stimulate preosteoblast differentiation (10.Xi G. Wai C. DeMambro V. Rosen C.J. Clemmons D.R.

Those studies showed that in addition to IGFBP-2 binding to RPTPβ, IGF-I receptor activation was required, and inhibition of the IGF-I receptor tyrosine kinase inhibited RPTPβ polymerization. Because activation of the IGF-I receptor as well as IGFBP-2 binding to RPTPβ was required to induce RPTPβ polymerization, we wished to determine the mechanism by which IGF-I functioned to stimulate this interaction. These studies were undertaken to determine post-receptor signaling events that led RPTPβ polymerization. insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-2 receptor tyrosine phosphatase β integrin- linked kinase vascular smooth muscle cell phosphatase and tensin homolog.

The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit, goat anti-mouse, and mouse anti-rabbit light chain-specific antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. A synthetic peptide containing the cell permeability sequence of the protein transduction domain and the head domain sequence (underlined) from vimentin (YARAAARQARAR-SVSSSSYRRMF), hereafter referred as a disrupting peptide, and a peptide containing YARAAARQARAR-SVASAAYRRMF, wherein three serines were substituted with alanine (underlined), serving as a control peptide, were synthesized by the Protein Chemistry Core Facility at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Purity and the sequence were confirmed by mass spectrometry. The VSMC were isolated from the aortic explants obtained from 3-week-old pigs and were maintained as described previously (14.Gockerman A. Clemmons D.R. Porcine aortic smooth muscle cells secrete a protease for insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2.Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in DMEM high glucose (25 mm) or DMEM with normal glucose (5 mm) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. In some experiments, 20 mm glucose was added to cells that had been exposed to normal glucose for different times prior to IGF addition. The cultures were used between passages 5 and 14. VSMCs with or without IGF-I (50 ng/ml) treatment were lysed in the modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer. Cell lysates (3 mg) were precleared with protein A/G-agarose for 30 min to eliminate nonspecific protein interactions and then incubated with an anti-RPTPβ antibody (6 μg) and protein A/G-agarose at 4 °C with gentle agitation for 3 h. The immunocomplexes were separated on a 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with colloidal Blue G-250 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL). The protein band that was increased in response to IGF-I was excised from the stained gel, destained with 200 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0), 40% acetonitrile, twice at 37 °C for 30 min. The gel was exposed for 10 min to 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, cut into small pieces, then dehydrated with 100% acetonitrile, and vacuum-dried. In-gel digestion was performed by adding 30 μl of modified porcine trypsin solution (Promega, Madison, WI) at 20 ng/μl in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate following by a 14-h incubation at room temperature. Peptides were extracted with 50% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid twice at 37 °C for 30 min, and the solution was completely dried in speed vacuum prior to MALDI-MS analysis conducted by the Proteomics Core Facility at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Wild type mouse IGFBP-2 and heparin binding domain mutated IGFBP-2 (MT1) were generated and purified following the procedure described previously (9.Shen X. Xi G. Maile L.A. Wai C. Rosen C.J.

Based on Invitrogen website design tools, sequences containing 21 oligonucleotides (GG AGT TCT GAC ATG CGT ATT T) were used to construct a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) template plasmid in order to knock down IGFBP-2. Two-nucleotide substitutions (underlined GGAGTTCTGTGATGCGTATT) were inserted as a control shRNA. VSMCs expressing shRNA targeting IGFBP-2 and control shRNA were established following the procedure described previously (9.Shen X. Xi G. Maile L.A. Wai C. Rosen C.J. Clemmons D.R. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein 2 functions coordinately with receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase β and the IGF-I receptor to regulate IGF-I-stimulated signaling.Mol. Cell.

VSMCs were transfected using a concentration of 40 nm and the PepMute Plus reagent (SignaGen Laboratories) following the manufacturer's instructions. The experiments were initiated 72 h after transfection. The immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting procedures were performed as described previously (9.Shen X. Xi G. Maile L.A. Wai C. Rosen C.J. Clemmons D.R. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein 2 functions coordinately with receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase β and the IGF-I receptor to regulate IGF-I-stimulated signaling.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2012; 32: 4116-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating 0.5 mg of cell lysate protein with 1 μg of each of the following antibodies: anti-vimentin, ILK, pY99, and Ser(P) at 4 °C overnight. Immunoblotting was performed using a dilution of 1:1000 for anti-pAKT(S473), PTEN, vimentin, and β-actin antibodies, a dilution of 1:500 for anti-RPTPβ antibody, and a dilution of 1:2000 for anti-IGFBP-2 antibody. The proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL). The chemical cross-linking procedures were performed as described previously (9.Shen X. Xi G.

Briefly, cells were washed three times with PBS and then incubated with 2 mg/ml bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate, BS3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL) in PBS for 1 h on ice. Cross-linking was terminated by adding 50 mm Tris for 15 min. The cells were lysed, and the lysate was separated onto a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. All mouse experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Hyperglycemia was induced in C57/B6 mice (Taconic, Hudson, NY) using the low dose streptozotocin (16.Maile L.A. Capps B.E. Miller E.C. Aday A.W. Clemmons D.R. Integrin-associated protein association with SRC homology 2 domain containing tyrosine phosphatase substrate 1 regulates igf-I-signaling in vivo.Diabetes. 2008; 57: 2637-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The mean weight and serum glucose concentration was 27.1 ± 0.6 g and 120.6 ± 22.6 mg/dl before streptozotocin injection. One week after injection, mean serum glucose concentration was 311.6 ± 21.4 mg/dl. The mice were maintained for another 2 weeks before any treatment. The mean weight and serum glucose concentration was 26.0 ± 0.9 g and 430.3 ± 59.2 mg/dl before sacrifice. There were 12 mice per treatment group. The disrupting peptide (4 mg/kg) or control peptide (4 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally twice (24 and 1 h before sacrifice) and IGF-I (1 mg/kg) or PBS was administered intraperitoneally 15 min before sacrifice. The aortic extracts were prepared following the procedure described previously (17.Xi G. Shen X. Maile L.A. Wai C. Gollahon K. Clemmons D.R. Hyperglycemia enhances IGF-I-stimulated Src activation via increasing Nox4-derived reactive oxygen species in PKCζ-dependent manner in vascular smooth muscle cells.Diabetes. 2012; 61: 104-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of aortic extracts was measured using a BCA assay (Thermo Scientific). Equal amounts of protein were used for each analysis. The results that are shown in all experiments are representative of at least three independent experiments and expressed as the mean ± S.D. The Student's t test was used to compare differences between two treatments for in vitro experiments. The Bonferroni correction was used when multiple variables were compared. One-way analysis of variance was applied for all data obtained from in vivo studies. In addition, repeated measures-analysis of variance was used where appropriate. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To determine whether a specific protein(s) associated with RPTPβ in response to IGF-I stimulation, we exposed VSMCs to IGF-I for 10 min in the presence of IGFBP-2 and then immunoprecipitated RPTPβ. The proteins that coimmunoprecipitated were separated by SDS-PAGE, and Colloidal Blue staining showed a major increase in a 58,000-kDa band in response IGF-I stimulation (Fig. 1A). Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that the band was the intermediate filament protein vimentin. That vimentin bound to RPTPβ in response to IGF-I was confirmed using immunoprecipitation (3.2 ± 0.6-fold increase) (Fig. 1B). To determine whether vimentin binding to RPTPβ mediated RPTPβ polymerization, siRNA was utilized to knock down vimentin, which resulted in 86 ± 5% inhibition of vimentin synthesis (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2A). Transient knockdown of vimentin did not result in a change in cell morphology, cytoskeletal structure, or increased cell death (data not shown). Exposure of cells expressing a control siRNA to IGF-I plus IGFBP-2 resulted in a 7.0 ± 0.4-fold greater stimulation of vimentin binding to RPTPβ compared with cells expressing the vimentin siRNA (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2B). To assess the functional significance of loss of RPTPβ/vimentin association, we determined the effect of IGF-I plus IGFBP-2 on RPTPβ polymerization. As shown in Fig. 2C, cells expressing vimentin siRNA had complete attenuation of RPTPβ polymerization indicating that vimentin binding to RPTPβ was absolutely required. To assess the functional significance of loss of RPTPβ polymerization, we analyzed PTEN tyrosine phosphorylation because RPTPβ specifically dephosphorylates this substrate (9.Shen X. Xi G. Maile L.A. Wai C. Rosen C.J. Clemmons D.R. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein 2 functions coordinately with receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase β and the IGF-I receptor to regulate IGF-I-stimulated signaling.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2012; 32: 4116-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2D, IGF-I stimulated a 4.3 ± 0.3-fold increase in PTEN tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas vimentin knockdown resulted in near complete loss of the IGF-I/IGFBP-2-stimulated response (e.g. 1.4 ± 0.2-fold increase) (p < 0.01 compared with control). IGF-I-stimulated a 7.2 ± 1.4-fold increase (p < 0.001) in AKT phosphorylation in control cells, and this response was significantly attenuated in cells treated with vimentin siRNA (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2E). Therefore, vimentin association with RPTPβ is required for IGF-I-stimulated RPTPβ polymerization and optimum enhancement of AKT activation.FIGURE 2Vimentin is required for IGF-I-stimulated RPTPβ polymerization, PTEN tyrosine phosphorylation, and AKT activation. VSMCs treated with the siRNA targeting vimentin (vimentin Si) and a control siRNA (Ctrl Si) were serum-deprived for 16 h and then incubated without (−) or with (+) IGF-I (50 ng/ml) for 10 min. A, cell lysates were immunoblotted (IB) with an anti-vimentin antibody. To control for loading, the blot was stripped and reprobed with an anti-β-actin antibody. B, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with an anti-vimentin antibody and immunoblotted with an anti-RPTPβ antibody. To control for loading, the same amount of lysate was immunoblotted with an anti-RPTPβ antibody. Each bar is the ratio of the mean value of the scanning units for vimentin-associated RPTPβ divided by total RPTPβ.

Xi G. Maile L.A. Wai C. Rosen C.J. Clemmons D.R. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein 2 functions coordinately with receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase β and the IGF-I receptor to regulate IGF-I-stimulated signaling.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2012; 32: 4116-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Cells expressing the IGFBP-2 shRNA had a 93 ± 8% decrease in IGFBP-2 secretion and showed no vimentin/RPTPβ binding (Fig. 3A). Exposure of the knockdown cells to IGFBP-2 and IGF-I rescued vimentin/RPTPβ association (5.4 ± 0.7-fold increase compared with 6.8 ± 0.2-fold in control cells). IGF-I receptor activation was also required for vimentin to bind to RPTPβ, because in the presence of an IGF-IR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PQ401, there was a 72 ± 10% (p < 0.01) reduction in stimulation of vimentin/RPTPβ association (Fig. 3B). To determine the region of IGFBP-2 that was interacting with RPTPβ to facilitate vimentin binding, we utilized cells expressing an IGFBP-2 mutant (MT-1), which had been shown previously to have attenuated RPTPβ binding. This mutant has no reduction in its affinity for IGF-I. Stimulation of the cultures with IGF-I and the mutant form of IGFBP-2 resulted in significant attenuation of stimulation RPTPβ/vimentin association (79 ± 6% reduction, p < 0.001) (Fig. 3C). To determine the mechanism by which IGF-I receptor activation stimulated vimentin/RPTPβ association, we analyzed the role of vimentin serine phosphorylation because serine phosphorylation of the vimentin head domain has been shown to mediate protein/protein interactions (18.Eriksson J.E. He T. Trejo-Skalli A.V. Härmälä-Braskén A.S. Hellman J. Chou Y.H. Goldman R.D. Specific in vivo phosphorylation sites determine the assembly dynamics of vimentin intermediate filaments.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 919-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Following IGF-I stimulation, there was a 5.1 ± 0.4-fold increase in serine phosphorylation of vimentin (Fig. 4A). The IGF-IR tyrosine kinase inhibitor significantly inhibited IGF-I-stimulated vimentin serine phosphorylation (1.7 ± 0.3-fold increase) (82 ± 12% reduction compared with control, p < 0.001) (Fig. 4A). In contrast, when cells expressing IGFBP-2 shRNA were analyzed, there was no inhibition of IGF-I-stimulated vimentin phosphorylation (e.g. an 3.6 ± 0.6-fold increase in control cells and an 3.3 ± 0.9-fold increase in IGFBP-2 knockdown cells) (Fig. 4B). The vimentin head domain sequence contains 16 known serine phosphorylation sites (18.Eriksson J.E. He T. Trejo-Skalli A.V. Härmälä-Braskén A.S. Hellman J. Chou Y.H. Goldman R.D. Specific in vivo phosphorylation sites determine the assembly dynamics of vimentin intermediate filaments.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 919-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). To identify the kinase that phosphorylated vimentin, we prepared cell-permeable peptides that contained sequence motifs that had been shown to be phosphorylated by specific kinases that were known to phosphorylate vimentin, and we then screened them for their ability to disrupt RPTPβ/vimentin association. The response to a cell-permeable peptide that contained the consensus sequence of a known PKCζ phosphorylation site located between residues 2 and 11 in the vimentin N terminus wa"

https://openalex.org/W2003976853,"Calotropis procera R. Br., a traditional medicinal plant in India, is a promising source of commercial proteases, because the cysteine proteases from the plant exhibit high thermo-stability, broad pH optima, and plasma-clotting activity. Though several proteases such as Procerain, Procerain B, CpCp-1, CpCp-2, and CpCp-3 have been isolated and characterized, the information of their transcripts is limited to cDNAs encoding their mature peptides. Due to this limitation, in this study, to determine the cDNA sequences encoding full open reading frame of these cysteine proteases, transcripts were sequenced with an Illumina Hiseq2000 sequencer. A total of 171,253,393 clean reads were assembled into 106,093 contigs with an average length of 1,614 bp and an N50 of 2,703 bp, and 70,797 contigs with an average length of 1,565 bp and N50 of 2,082 bp using Trinity and Velvet-Oases software, respectively. Among these contigs, we found 20 unigenes related to papain-like cysteine proteases by BLASTX analysis against a non-redundant NCBI protein database. Our expression analysis revealed that the cysteine protease contains an N-terminal pro-peptide domain (inhibitor region), which is necessary for correct folding and proteolytic activity. It was evident that expression yields using an inducible T7 expression system in Escherichia coli were considerably higher with the pro-peptide domain than without the domain, which could contribute to molecular cloning of the Calotropis procera protease as an active form with correct folding."
https://openalex.org/W2034383425,"In order to assess the effects of climate change in temperate rainforest plants in southern South America in terms of habitat size, representation in protected areas, considering also if the expected impacts are similar for dominant trees and understory plant species, we used niche modeling constrained by species migration on 118 plant species, considering two groups of dominant trees and two groups of understory ferns. Representation in protected areas included Chilean national protected areas, private protected areas, and priority areas planned for future reserves, with two thresholds for minimum representation at the country level: 10% and 17%. With a 10% representation threshold, national protected areas currently represent only 50% of the assessed species. Private reserves are important since they increase up to 66% the species representation level. Besides, 97% of the evaluated species may achieve the minimum representation target only if the proposed priority areas were included. With the climate change scenario representation levels slightly increase to 53%, 69%, and 99%, respectively, to the categories previously mentioned. Thus, the current location of all the representation categories is useful for overcoming climate change by 2050. Climate change impacts on habitat size and representation of dominant trees in protected areas are not applicable to understory plants, highlighting the importance of assessing these effects with a larger number of species. Although climate change will modify the habitat size of plant species in South American temperate rainforests, it will have no significant impact in terms of the number of species adequately represented in Chile, where the implementation of the proposed reserves is vital to accomplish the present and future minimum representation. Our results also show the importance of using migration dispersal constraints to develop more realistic future habitat maps from climate change predictions."

However, the specific mechanisms through which MTDH is involved in these processes remain unclear. To uncover these mechanisms, we generated Mtdh knock-out mice via a targeted disruption of exon 3. Homozygous Mtdh knock-out mice are viable, but males are infertile. The homozygous male mice present with massive loss of spermatozoa as a consequence of meiotic failure. Accumulation of γ-H2AX in spermatocytes of homozygous Mtdh knock-out mice confirms an increase in unrepaired DNA breaks. We also examined expression of the DNA repair protein Rad18, which is regulated by MTDH at the post-transcriptional level. In testes from Mtdh exon 3-deficient mice, Rad18 foci were increased in the lumina of the seminiferous tubules. The Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA)-interacting protein Mili was expressed at high levels in testes from Mtdh knock-out mice. Accordingly, genome-wide small RNA deep sequencing demonstrated altered expression of piRNAs in the testes of Mtdh knock-out mice as compared with wild type mice. In addition, we observed significantly reduced expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) including miR-16 and miR-19b, which are known to be significantly reduced in the semen of infertile men.

https://openalex.org/W2074534712,"The type 2 transmembrane serine protease matriptase is under tight control primarily by the actions of the integral membrane Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor HAI-1. Growing evidence indicates that HAI-2 might also be involved in matriptase inhibition in some contexts. Here we showed that matriptase inhibition by HAI-2 depends on the subcellular localizations of HAI-2, and is observed in breast cancer cells but not in mammary epithelial cells. HAI-2 is co-expressed with matriptase in 21 out of 26 human epithelial and carcinoma cells examined. HAI-2 is also a potent matriptase inhibitor in solution, but in spite of this, HAI-2 inhibition of matriptase is not observed in all contexts where HAI-2 is expressed, unlike what is seen for HAI-1. Induction of matriptase zymogen activation in mammary epithelial cells results in the formation of matriptase-HAI-1 complexes, but matriptase-HAI-2 complexes are not observed. In breast cancer cells, however, in addition to the appearance of matriptase-HAI-1 complex, three different matriptase-HAI-2 complexes, are formed following the induction of matriptase activation. Immunofluorescent staining reveals that activated matriptase is focused at the cell-cell junctions upon the induction of matriptase zymogen activation in both mammary epithelial cells and breast cancer cells. HAI-2, in contrast, remains localized in vesicle/granule-like structures during matriptase zymogen activation in human mammary epithelial cells. In breast cancer cells, however, a proportion of the HAI-2 reaches the cell surface where it can gain access to and inhibit active matriptase. Collectively, these data suggest that matriptase inhibition by HAI-2 requires the translocation of HAI-2 to the cell surface, a process which is observed in some breast cancer cells but not in mammary epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2113935417,"Transport infrastructure elements are widespread and increasing in size and length in many countries, with the subsequent alteration of landscapes and wildlife communities. Nonetheless, their effects on habitat selection by raptors are still poorly understood. In this paper, we analyzed raptors’ foraging habitat selection in response to conventional roads and high capacity motorways at the landscape scale, and compared their effects with those of other variables, such as habitat structure, food availability, and presence of potential interspecific competitors. We also analyzed whether the raptors’ response towards infrastructure depends on the spatial scale of observation, comparing the attraction or avoidance behavior of the species at the landscape scale with the response of individuals observed in the proximity of the infrastructure. Based on ecological hypotheses for foraging habitat selection, we built generalized linear mixed models, selected the best models according to Akaike Information Criterion and assessed variable importance by Akaike weights. At the community level, the traffic volume was the most relevant variable in the landscape for foraging habitat selection. Abundance, richness, and diversity values reached their maximum at medium traffic volumes and decreased at highest traffic volumes. Individual species showed different degrees of tolerance toward traffic, from higher abundance in areas with high traffic values to avoidance of it. Medium-sized opportunistic raptors increased their abundance near the traffic infrastructures, large scavenger raptors avoided areas with higher traffic values, and other species showed no direct response to traffic but to the presence of prey. Finally, our cross-scale analysis revealed that the effect of transport infrastructures on the behavior of some species might be detectable only at a broad scale. Also, food availability may attract raptor species to risky areas such as motorways."
https://openalex.org/W1972701708,"Objectives To utilize phosphorescence to monitor hypoxic microenvironment in solid-tumors and investigate cancer chemotherapeutic effects in vivo. Methods A hypoxia-sensitive probe named BTP was used to monitor hypoxic microenvironment in solid-tumors. The low-dose metronomic treatment with cisplatin was used in anti-angiogenetic chemotherapeutic programs. The phosphorescence properties of BTP were detected by a spectrofluorometer. BTP cytotoxicity utilized cell necrosis and apoptosis, which were evaluated by trypan blue dye exclusion and Hoechst33342 plus propidium iodide assays. Tumor-bearing mouse models of colon adenocarcinoma were used for tumor imaging in vivo. Monitoring of the hypoxic microenvironment in tumors was performed with a Maestro 2 fluorescence imaging system. Tumor tissues in each group were harvested regularly and treated with pathological hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemical staining to confirm imaging results. Results BTP did not feature obvious cytotoxicity for cells, and tumor growth in low-dose metronomic cisplatin treated mice was significantly inhibited by chemotherapy. Hypoxic levels significantly increased due to cisplatin, as proven by the expression level of related proteins. Phosphorescence intensity in the tumors of mice in the cisplatin group was stronger and showed higher contrast than that in tumors of saline treated mice. We develop a useful phosphorescence method to evaluate the chemotherapeutic effects of cisplatin. The proposed method shows potential as a phosphorescence imaging approach for evaluating chemotherapeutic effects in vivo, especially anti-angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2082830863,"Manure from animal farms and sewage sludge contain pathogens and opportunistic organisms in various concentrations depending on the health of the herds and human sources. Other than for the presence of pathogens, these waste substances are excellent nutrient sources and constitute a preferred organic fertilizer. However, because of the pathogens, the risks of infection of animals or humans increase with the indiscriminate use of manure, especially liquid manure or sludge, for agriculture. This potential problem can increase with the global connectedness of animal herds fed imported feed grown on fields fertilized with local manures. This paper describes a simple, easy-to-use, low-tech hygienization method which conserves nutrients and does not require large investments in infrastructure. The proposed method uses the microbiotic shift during mesophilic fermentation of cow manure or sewage sludge during which gram-negative bacteria, enterococci and yeasts were inactivated below the detection limit of 3 log10 cfu/g while lactobacilli increased up to a thousand fold. Pathogens like Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli EHEC O:157 and vegetative Clostridium perfringens were inactivated within 3 days of fermentation. In addition, ECBO-viruses and eggs of Ascaris suum were inactivated within 7 and 56 days, respectively. Compared to the mass lost through composting (15–57%), the loss of mass during fermentation (< 2.45%) is very low and provides strong economic and ecological benefits for this process. This method might be an acceptable hygienization method for developed as well as undeveloped countries, and could play a key role in public and animal health while safely closing the nutrient cycle by reducing the necessity of using energy-inefficient inorganic fertilizer for crop production."
https://openalex.org/W2040007913,"Background Cardiovascular disease is the major cause of death in renal transplant recipients (RTRs) and linked to arterial calcification. The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), a G-protein coupled receptor, plays a pivotal role in extracellular calcium homeostasis and is expressed in the intimal and medial layers of the arterial wall. We investigated whether common CASR gene variants are predictors for aortic and coronary artery calcification or influence risk factors such as serum calcium, phosphate and glucose concentrations in RTRs. Methods Two hundred and eighty four RTRs were investigated for associations between three CASR promoter region single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs115759455, rs7652589, rs1501899), three non-synonymous CASR coding region SNPs (A986S, R990G, Q1011E), and aortic and coronary artery calcium mass scores, cardiovascular outcomes and calcification risk factors that included serum phosphate, calcium, total cholesterol and glucose concentrations. Results Multivariate analysis revealed that RTRs homozygous for the minor allele (SS) of the A986S SNP, when compared to those homozygous for the major allele (AA), had raised serum glucose concentrations (8.7±5.4 vs. 5.7±2.1 mmol/L, P<0.05). In addition, RTRs who were heterozygous (CT) at the rs115759455 SNP, when compared to those homozygous for the major allele (CC), had higher serum phosphate concentrations (1.1±0.3 vs. 1.0±0.2 mmol/L, P<0.05). CASR SNPs were not significant determinants for aortic or coronary artery calcification, and were not associated with cardiovascular outcomes or mortality in this RTR cohort. Conclusions Common CASR SNPs may be independent predictors of serum glucose and phosphate concentrations, but are not determinants of vascular calcification or cardiovascular outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2040442859,"Zinc is an essential trace element with wide-ranging biological functions, whereas the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays crucial roles in both development and disease. Here we show that there is a mechanistic link between zinc and Hh signaling. The upstream activator of Hh signaling, the Hh ligand, originates from Hh autoprocessing, which converts the Hh precursor protein to the Hh ligand. In an in vitro Hh autoprocessing assay we show that zinc inhibits Hh autoprocessing with a Ki of 2 μm. We then demonstrate that zinc inhibits Hh autoprocessing in a cellular environment with experiments in primary rat astrocyte culture. Solution NMR reveals that zinc binds the active site residues of the Hh autoprocessing domain to inhibit autoprocessing, and isothermal titration calorimetry provided the thermodynamics of the binding. In normal physiology, zinc likely acts as a negative regulator of Hh autoprocessing and inhibits the generation of Hh ligand and Hh signaling. In many diseases, zinc deficiency and elevated level of Hh ligand co-exist, including prostate cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and autism. Our data suggest a causal relationship between zinc deficiency and the overproduction of Hh ligand."
https://openalex.org/W2084145236,"A successful HIV vaccine in addition to induction of antibody responses should elicit effective T cell responses. Here we described possible strategies for rational design of T-cell vaccine capable to induce high levels of both CD4+ and CD8+ T- cell responses. We developed artificial HIV-1 polyepitope T-cell immunogens based on the conserved natural CD8+ and CD4+ T cell epitopes from different HIV-1 strains and restricted by the most frequent major human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. Designed immunogens contain optimized core polyepitope sequence and additional “signal” sequences which increase epitope processing and presentation to CD8+ and CD4+ T-lymphocytes: N-terminal ubiquitin, N-terminal signal peptide and C-terminal tyrosine motif of LAMP-1 protein. As a result we engineered three T cell immunogens – TCI-N, TCI-N2, and TCI-N3, with different combinations of signal sequences. All designed immunogens were able to elicit HIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses following immunization. Attachment of either ubiquitin or ER-signal/LAMP-1 sequences increased both CD4+ and CD8+ mediated HIV-specific T cell responses in comparison with polyepitope immunogen without any additional signal sequences. Moreover, TCI-N3 polyepitope immunogen with ubiquitin generated highest magnitude of HIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in our study. Obtained data suggests that attachment of signal sequences targeting polyepitope immunogens to either MHC class I or MHC class II presentation pathways may improve immunogenicity of T-cell vaccines. These results support the strategy of the rational T cell immunogen design and contribute to the development of effective HIV-1 vaccine."

High IGF1R gene expression was significantly associated with IGHV unmutated (IGHV-UM) status (p<0.0001), high CD38 expression (p<0.0001), trisomy 12 (p<0.0001), and del(11)(q23) (p=0.014). Interestingly, higher IGF1R expression (p=0.002) characterized patients with NOTCH1 mutation (c.7541_7542delCT), identified in 15.5% of cases of our series by next generation sequencing and ARMS-PCR. Furthermore, IGF1R expression has been proven as an independent prognostic factor associated with time to first treatment in our CLL prospective cohort. These data suggest that IGF1R may play an important role in CLL biology, in particular in aggressive CLL clones characterized by IGHV-UM, trisomy 12 and NOTCH1 mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2034870362,"This work is about assessing model adequacy for negative binomial (NB) regression, particularly (1) assessing the adequacy of the NB assumption, and (2) assessing the appropriateness of models for NB dispersion parameters. Tools for the first are appropriate for NB regression generally; those for the second are primarily intended for RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data analysis. The typically small number of biological samples and large number of genes in RNA-Seq analysis motivate us to address the trade-offs between robustness and statistical power using NB regression models. One widely-used power-saving strategy, for example, is to assume some commonalities of NB dispersion parameters across genes via simple models relating them to mean expression rates, and many such models have been proposed. As RNA-Seq analysis is becoming ever more popular, it is appropriate to make more thorough investigations into power and robustness of the resulting methods, and into practical tools for model assessment. In this article, we propose simulation-based statistical tests and diagnostic graphics to address model adequacy. We provide simulated and real data examples to illustrate that our proposed methods are effective for detecting the misspecification of the NB mean-variance relationship as well as judging the adequacy of fit of several NB dispersion models."
https://openalex.org/W1986078105,"Objective The aim of the study was to evaluate whether the clinical assessment of the pelvic-hip complex muscle and trunk flexibility is sufficient for diagnosing generalized joint hypermobility (GJH). Design A cross-sectional study. Setting Center of Body Posture in Olsztyn, North East Poland. Participants The study included 136 females and 113 males aged 10–13 years. Main outcome measures In order to assess muscle flexibility, the straight leg raise (SLR) test (for hamstring) and modified Thomas test for one- (O-JHF) and two-joint (T-JHF) hip flexors were performed. To evaluate trunk flexibility the fingertip-to-floor (FTF) and lateral trunk flexion (LTF) tests were used. The GJH occurrence was assessed with the use of nine-point Beighton scale (threshold value ≥5 points for females, ≥4 for males). The analysis was carried out separately for females and males. Results There were no significant differences between females with versus without GJH, and males with versus without GJH regarding SLR (p = 0.86, p = 0.19 for females and males, respectively), O-JHF (p = 0.89, p = 0.35 for females and males, respectively), T-JHF (p = 0.77, p = 0.4 for females and males, respectively), FTF (p = 0.19, p = 0.84 for females and males, respectively) and LTF (p = 0.58, p = 0.35 for females and males, respectively) tests results. Conclusions Clinical examination of the pelvic-hip complex muscles and trunk flexibility by use of SLR, O-JHF, T-JHF, FTF and LTF revealed to be insufficient in diagnosing GJH in children aged 10–13 years. Thus, the Beighton scale should be considered a standard element of physiotherapeutic examination of the musculoskeletal system in children and youth."
https://openalex.org/W1973062275,"Aging occurs over time with gradual and progressive loss of physiological function. Strategies to reduce the rate of functional loss and mitigate the subsequent onset of deadly age-related diseases are being sought. We demonstrated previously that a combination of rapamycin and myriocin reduces age-related functional loss in the Baker’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and produces a synergistic increase in lifespan. Here we show that the same drug combination also produces a synergistic increase in the lifespan of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and does so by controlling signal transduction pathways conserved across a wide evolutionary time span ranging from yeasts to mammals. Pathways include the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) protein kinase, the protein kinase A (PKA) and a stress response pathway, which in fission yeasts contains the Sty1 protein kinase, an ortholog of the mammalian p38 MAP kinase, a type of Stress Activated Protein Kinase (SAPK). These results along with previous studies in S. cerevisiae support the premise that the combination of rapamycin and myriocin enhances lifespan by regulating signaling pathways that couple nutrient and environmental conditions to cellular processes that fine-tune growth and stress protection in ways that foster long term survival. The molecular mechanisms for fine-tuning are probably species-specific, but since they are driven by conserved nutrient and stress sensing pathways, the drug combination may enhance survival in other organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2079864274,"This work intends to assess circumpapillary retinal vessel density (RVD) at a 3.46 mm diameter circle and correlate it with circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness measured with Fourier-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography. Furthermore, it aims to evaluate the reduction of intersubject variability of RNFL when considering RVD as a source of information for RNFL distribution. For that, 106 healthy subjects underwent circumpapillary RNFL measurement. Using the scanning laser ophthalmoscope fundus image, thickness and position of retinal vessels were assessed and integrated in a 256-sector RVD profile. The relationship between local RVD value and local RNFL thickness was modeled by linear regression. RNFL was then compensated for RVD variation by regression formulas. A strong statistically significant intrasubject correlation was found for all subjects between RVD and RNFL profiles (mean R = 0.769). In the intersubject regression analysis, 247 of 256 RNFL sectors showed a statistically significant positive correlation with RVD (mean R = 0.423). RVD compensation of RNFL resulted in a relative reduction of up to 20% of the intersubject variance. In conclusion, RVD in a 3.46mm circle has a clinically relevant influence on the RNFL distribution. RVD may be used to develop more individualized normative values for RNFL measurement, which might improve early diagnosis of glaucoma."
https://openalex.org/W2006166884,"Increasing evidence suggests that cirrhosis may affect the connectivity among different brain regions in patients before overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) occurs. However, there has been no study investigating the structural reorganization of these altered connections at the network level. The primary focus of this study was to investigate the abnormal topological organization of the structural network in patients with hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis (HBV-RC) without OHE using structural MRI.Using graph theoretical analysis, we compared the global and regional topological properties of gray matter structural networks between 28 patients with HBV-RC without OHE and 30 age-, sex- and education-matched healthy controls. The structural correlation networks were constructed for the two groups based on measures of gray matter volume.The brain network of the HBV-RC group exhibited a significant decrease in the clustering coefficient and reduced small-worldness at the global level across a range of network densities. Regionally, brain areas with altered nodal degree/betweenness centrality were observed predominantly in association cortices (frontal and temporal regions) (p < 0.05, uncorrected), including a significantly decreased nodal degree in the inferior temporal gyrus (p < 0.001, uncorrected). Furthermore, the HBV-RC group exhibited a loss of association hubs and the emergence of an increased number of non-association hubs compared with the healthy controls.The results of this large-scale gray matter structural network study suggest reduced topological organization efficiency in patients with HBV-RC without OHE. Our findings provide new insight concerning the mechanisms of neurobiological reorganization in the HBV-RC brain from a network perspective."
https://openalex.org/W2031198548,"In face-to-face bargaining tasks human adults almost always agree on an equal split of resources. This is due to mutually recognized fairness and equality norms. Early developmental studies on sharing and equality norms found that egalitarian allocations of resources are not common before children are 5 or 6 years old. However, recent studies have shown that in some face-to face collaborative situations, or when recipients express their desires, children at much younger ages choose equal allocations. We investigated the ability of 3.5 and 5-year-olds to negotiate face-to-face, whether to collaborate to obtain an equal or an unequal distribution of rewards. We hypothesized that the face-to-face interaction and interdependency between partners would facilitate egalitarian outcomes at both ages. In the first experiment we found that 5-year-olds were more egalitarian than 3.5-year-olds, but neither of the age classes shared equally. In the second experiment, in which we increased the magnitude of the inequality, we found that children at both ages mostly agreed on the unequal distribution. These results show that communication and face-to-face interactions are not sufficient to guarantee equal allocations at 3-5 years of age. These results add to previous findings suggesting that in the context of non-collaboratively produced resources it is only after 5 years of age that children use equality norms to allocate resources."
https://openalex.org/W2148392487,"Spatial variation in resources is a fundamental driver of habitat quality but the realized value of resources at any point in space may depend on the effects of conspecifics and stochastic factors, such as weather, which vary through time. We evaluated the relative and combined effects of habitat resources, weather, and conspecifics on habitat quality for ferruginous pygmy-owls (Glaucidium brasilianum) in the Sonoran Desert of northwest Mexico by monitoring reproductive output and conspecific abundance over 10 years in and around 107 territory patches. Variation in reproductive output was much greater across space than time, and although habitat resources explained a much greater proportion of that variation (0.70) than weather (0.17) or conspecifics (0.13), evidence for interactions among each of these components of the environment was strong. Relative to habitat that was persistently low in quality, high-quality habitat buffered the negative effects of conspecifics and amplified the benefits of favorable weather, but did not buffer the disadvantages of harsh weather. Moreover, the positive effects of favorable weather at low conspecific densities were offset by intraspecific competition at high densities. Although realized habitat quality declined with increasing conspecific density suggesting interference mechanisms associated with an Ideal Free Distribution, broad spatial heterogeneity in habitat quality persisted. Factors linked to food resources had positive effects on reproductive output but only where nest cavities were sufficiently abundant to mitigate the negative effects of heterospecific enemies. Annual precipitation and brooding-season temperature had strong multiplicative effects on reproductive output, which declined at increasing rates as drought and temperature increased, reflecting conditions predicted to become more frequent with climate change. Because the collective environment influences habitat quality in complex ways, integrated approaches that consider habitat resources, stochastic factors, and conspecifics are necessary to accurately assess habitat quality."
https://openalex.org/W1998678282,"The compartment model analysis using medical imaging data is the well-established but extremely time consuming technique for quantifying the changes in microvascular physiology of targeted organs in clinical patients after antivascular therapies. In this paper, we present a first graphics processing unit-accelerated method for compartmental modeling of medical imaging data. Using this approach, we performed the analysis of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging data from bevacizumab-treated glioblastoma patients in less than one minute per slice without losing accuracy. This approach reduced the computation time by more than 120-fold comparing to a central processing unit-based method that performed the analogous analysis steps in serial and more than 17-fold comparing to the algorithm that optimized for central processing unit computation. The method developed in this study could be of significant utility in reducing the computational times required to assess tumor physiology from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging data in preclinical and clinical development of antivascular therapies and related fields."
https://openalex.org/W2075476922,"It has recently been observed in numerical simulations that the phases of two coupled nonlinear oscillators can become locked into an irrational ratio, exhibiting the phenomenon of irrational phase synchronization (IPS) [Phys. Rev. E 69, 056228 (2004)]. Here, using two coupled nonidentical periodic mechanical metronomes, we revisit this interesting phenomenon through experimental studies. It is demonstrated that under suitable couplings, the phases of the metronomes indeed can become locked into irrational ratios. Numerical simulations confirm the experimental observations and also reveal that in the IPS state, the system dynamics are chaotic. Our studies provide a solid step toward further studies of IPS."
https://openalex.org/W2015461484,"Aims To determine the differential effects of genetic polymorphism in CFH and ARMS2 on risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) between phakic vs. pseudophakic/aphakic eyes. Methods 9,529 eyes of 4,918 participants from the Singapore Malay Eye Study and Singapore Indian Eye Study were analyzed. Participants had detailed eye examinations, including slit-lamp examinations and dilated fundus photography. AMD grading was performed according to the Wisconsin age-related maculopathy grading system. Lens status was defined. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs10801555 (Y402H) within CFH and rs3750847 in ARMS2 were assessed. The main outcome measure was early AMD or any AMD. Results No significant associations between the CFH Y402H genotypes and early AMD were found in phakic individuals. In contrast, among pseudophakic/aphakic individuals, the CFH Y402H risk genotypes were significantly associated with higher odds of early AMD, with an OR of 1.57 (95% CI: 1.07–2.29) for GA genotype and 2.40 (95% CI: 1.25–4.61) for AA genotype, compared to those with GG genotype. There was significant interaction between pseudophakic/aphakic status and CFH Y402H variant on risk of early AMD (p = 0.037), adjusting for age, gender, and the first 5 genetic principal components. No significant interaction was found between lens status and ARMS2 rs3750847. Conclusions CFH genetic polymorphism and pseudophakic/aphakic status may have a potential synergistic effect on early AMD, suggesting roles for the complement system and related pathways in the pathogenesis of AMD in eyes after cataract surgery."

https://openalex.org/W2028499589,"Temporal changes of gene expression are a well-known regulatory feature of all cells, which is commonly perceived as a strategy to adapt the proteome to varying external conditions. However, temporal (rhythmic and non-rhythmic) changes of gene expression are also observed under virtually constant external conditions. Here we hypothesize that such changes are a means to render the synthesis of the metabolic output more efficient than under conditions of constant gene activities. In order to substantiate this hypothesis, we used a flux-balance model of the cellular metabolism. The total time span spent on the production of a given set of target metabolites was split into a series of shorter time intervals (metabolic phases) during which only selected groups of metabolic genes are active. The related flux distributions were calculated under the constraint that genes can be either active or inactive whereby the amount of protein related to an active gene is only controlled by the number of active genes: the lower the number of active genes the more protein can be allocated to the enzymes carrying non-zero fluxes. This concept of a predominantly protein-limited efficiency of gene expression clearly differs from other concepts resting on the assumption of an optimal gene regulation capable of allocating to all enzymes and transporters just that fraction of protein necessary to prevent rate limitation. Applying this concept to a simplified metabolic network of the central carbon metabolism with glucose or lactate as alternative substrates, we demonstrate that switching between optimally chosen stationary flux modes comprising different sets of active genes allows producing a demanded amount of target metabolites in a significantly shorter time than by a single optimal flux mode at fixed gene activities. Our model-based findings suggest that temporal expression of metabolic genes can be advantageous even under conditions of constant external substrate supply."
https://openalex.org/W2145841230,"Polls for majoritarian voting systems usually show estimates of the percentage of votes for each candidate. However, proportional vote systems do not necessarily guarantee the candidate with the most percentage of votes will be elected. Thus, traditional methods used in majoritarian elections cannot be applied on proportional elections. In this context, the purpose of this paper was to perform a Bayesian inference on proportional elections considering the Brazilian system of seats distribution. More specifically, a methodology to answer the probability that a given party will have representation on the chamber of deputies was developed. Inferences were made on a Bayesian scenario using the Monte Carlo simulation technique, and the developed methodology was applied on data from the Brazilian elections for Members of the Legislative Assembly and Federal Chamber of Deputies in 2010. A performance rate was also presented to evaluate the efficiency of the methodology. Calculations and simulations were carried out using the free R statistical software."
