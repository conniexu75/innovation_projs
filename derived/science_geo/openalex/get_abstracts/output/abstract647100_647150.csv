https://openalex.org/W3005442344,"Nutrient sensing by cells is crucial, and when this sensing mechanism is disturbed, human disease can occur. mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) senses amino acids to control cell growth, metabolism, and autophagy. Leucine, arginine, and methionine signal to mTORC1 through the well-characterized Rag GTPase signaling pathway. In contrast, glutamine activates mTORC1 through a Rag GTPase–independent mechanism that requires ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1). Here, using several biochemical and genetic approaches, we show that eight amino acids filter through the Rag GTPase pathway. Like glutamine, asparagine signals to mTORC1 through Arf1 in the absence of the Rag GTPases. Both the Rag-dependent and Rag-independent pathways required the lysosome and lysosomal function for mTORC1 activation. Our results show that mTORC1 is differentially regulated by amino acids through two distinct pathways."
https://openalex.org/W3005496444,"Strategies to mitigate climate change often center on clean technologies, such as electric vehicles and solar panels, while the mitigation potential of a quality educational experience is rarely discussed. In this paper, we investigate the long-term impact that an intensive one-year university course had on individual carbon emissions by surveying students at least five years after having taken the course. A majority of course graduates reported pro-environmental decisions (i.e., type of car to buy, food choices) that they attributed at least in part to experiences gained in the course. Furthermore, our carbon footprint analysis suggests that for the average course graduate, these decisions reduced their individual carbon emissions by 2.86 tons of CO2 per year. Surveys and focus group interviews identify that course graduates have developed a strong personal connection to climate change solutions, and this is realized in their daily behaviors and through their professional careers. The paper discusses in more detail the specific components of the course that are believed to be most impactful, and the uncertainties associated with this type of research design. Our analysis also demonstrates that if similar education programs were applied at scale, the potential reductions in carbon emissions would be of similar magnitude to other large-scale mitigation strategies, such as rooftop solar or electric vehicles."
https://openalex.org/W3004487875,"How to achieve the sustainable and coordinated development of the ecological environment, the economy and tourism has already received much attention. In this paper, a comprehensive evaluation index system of the ecological environment, the economy and tourism is established, and the coupling degrees and coordination degrees of the three subsystems of 31 provinces in China from 2003 to 2017 are calculated. The results show that the average coupling degree and average coordination degree have fluctuating upward trends during the period of 2003–2017. According to the spatial distribution of the coupling degrees and coordination degrees, the coastal provinces and Chongqing, with their high ecological environment pressure and good economic development, have low coupling and extremely high coordination levels. The vast central and western provinces with good ecological environment protection and economic backwardness have high coupling and low coordination development level. From the perspective of coordinated development, only seven of the western provinces and three middle-eastern provinces possess basic coordinated development of the ecological environment, the economy and tourism. The remaining 21 provinces are over-utilizing or sacrificing their ecological environments, among which eleven eastern provinces have an advanced economy or advanced tourism and five southwestern provinces with high tourism resource endowments have an advanced tourism."
https://openalex.org/W3005426886,"Viral reactivation occurs frequently in the context of immunodeficiency and immunosuppression after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) and can cause severe complications. The aim of this single-center retrospective analysis was to characterize viral infections in the first year after HSCT, to investigate risk factors and to study the impact of viral infections on transplantation outcome. This will facilitate the identification of at-risk patients and the development of new preventive strategies. 107 pediatric allo-HSCT from January 2005 through December 2015 were analyzed for infections with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), adenovirus (ADV), herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV). Viral infections were detected after 68.2% of transplantations. The viruses most commonly encountered were HHV-6 (36/107) and EBV (30/107). Severe viral disease was rare (7/107) and none of the patients died as result of viral reactivation. Important risk factors for viral infections were higher age at HSCT, donor type and occurrence of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD). Especially for EBV, transplant from an unrelated donor and in-vivo T-cell depletion (TCD) had a significant effect on infection rates, whereas for CMV the strongest effect was seen by donor and recipient serostatus with recipient seropositivity most predictive for reactivation. The occurrence of severe aGvHD was associated with EBV and ADV infections. For HSV, the recipient serostatus was identified as prognostic factor for HSV infections, while we found higher age at time of HSCT as risk factor for VZV infections. The overall survival of patients with or without viral infections did not differ significantly. Interestingly, when looking at the 85 patients in our cohort who had received an HSCT for a malignant disease, a tendency towards lower relapse rates was seen in patients affected by viral infections (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.25 – 1.06, p = 0.072). Viral reactivations are common after pediatric allo-HSCT, though severe complications were rare in our collective. Determining risk factors for viral reactivations may help to identify patients in need of intensified monitoring and to individualize preventive strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3005323124,"Soil extracellular enzyme activities and associated enzymatic stoichiometry are considered sensitive indicators of nutrient availability and microbial substrate limitation. However, many of previous studies have been focusing on uppermost soil layer with a single enzyme as representative of the whole nutrient acquisition, leading to critical uncertainties in understanding soil nutrient availability and its relationship with microbial activities in deeper soils. In the current study, we investigated C-, N- and P-acquiring enzyme activities across a range of soil layers (0–10, 10–20, 20–40 and 40–60 cm), and examined the microbial C, N and P limitation in natural secondary forests (NSF) and Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) plantation forests (CPF) in subtropical China. The results showed that microbial C and P co-limitation was detected in the two typical subtropical forests at all soil depths, rather than microbial N limitation. Microbial C and P limitation fluctuated along soil depth, but higher N was demanded by microbes in soil under 20 cm in both forests. The present results highlight the asymmetrical patterns of microbial nutrient limitation along the whole soil profile, and provide essential information in understanding nutrient limitations in deeper soils. These vertical and asymmetrical nutrient limitation patterns should be incorporated into future research studies priority."
https://openalex.org/W3005188331,"Ocean warming and acidification are among the greatest threats to coral reefs. Massive coral bleaching events are becoming increasingly common and are predicted to be more severe and frequent in the near future, putting corals reefs in danger of ecological collapse. This study quantified the abundance, size, and survival of the coral Pocillopora acuta under future projections of ocean warming and acidification. Flow-through mesocosms were exposed to current and future projections of ocean warming and acidification in a factorial design for 22 months. Neither ocean warming or acidification, nor their combination, influenced the size or abundance of P. acuta recruits, but heating impacted subsequent health and survival of the recruits. During annual maximum temperatures, coral recruits in heated tanks experienced higher levels of bleaching and subsequent mortality. Results of this study indicate that P. acuta is able to recruit under projected levels of ocean warming and acidification but are susceptible to bleaching and mortality during the warmest months."
https://openalex.org/W3005434318,"Postganglionic sympathetic neurons and satellite glial cells are the two major cell types of the peripheral sympathetic ganglia. Sympathetic neurons project to and provide neural control of peripheral organs and have been implicated in human disorders ranging from cardiovascular disease to peripheral neuropathies. Here we show that satellite glia regulate synaptic activity of cultured postnatal sympathetic neurons, providing evidence for local ganglionic control of sympathetic drive. In addition to modulating neuron-to-neuron cholinergic neurotransmission, satellite glia promote synapse formation and contribute to neuronal survival. Examination of the cellular architecture of the rat sympathetic ganglia in vivo shows this regulation of neuronal properties takes place during a developmental period in which neuronal morphology and density are actively changing and satellite glia enwrap sympathetic neuronal somata. Cultured satellite glia make and release factors that promote neuronal activity and that can partially rescue the neurons from cell death following nerve growth factor deprivation. Thus, satellite glia play an early and ongoing role within the postnatal sympathetic ganglia, expanding our understanding of the contributions of local and target-derived factors in the regulation of sympathetic neuron function."
https://openalex.org/W3004449773,"Purpose Ray propagation visualization and optical performance analysis of four different intraocular lenses (IOLs) Methods In this laboratory study, four IOLs with different optical designs were assessed: a monofocal AcrySof IQ SN60WF [Alcon], a diffractive-refractive bifocal AcrySof IQ Restor SN6AD1 [Alcon], a diffractive trifocal AcrySof IQ PanOptix TFNT00 [Alcon], and a diffractive extended-depth-of-focus (EDOF) Symfony ZXR00 [Johnson&Johnson]. An experimental set-up with a water bath containing 0.01% fluorescein solution and monochromatic green laser light (532 nm) was used to visualize the propagation of light rays. Also, the optical performance of the IOLs was evaluated by measuring the modulation transfer function (MTF) values at a pupil sizes of 3.0 and 4.5 mm on the optical bench OptiSpheric® IOL PRO II (Trioptics GmbH, Germany). Results Both the diffractive-refractive bifocal IOL and the EDOF IOL showed two defined foci for distance and near vision. In the diffractive trifocal IOL, three distinct foci for distance, intermediate, and near vision could be visualized. Conclusions The ray propagation visualization technique allows a qualitative assessment and comparison of light energy distribution between different IOL models. The measured Through-Focus Response (TFR) quantitatively confirmed the evaluated ray propagation behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3005263298,"Sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2) is known to phosphorylate the nuclear sphingolipid metabolite to generate sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). Nuclear S1P is involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression; however, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. In this work, we have identified the role of nuclear S1P and SphK2 in regulating hypoxia-responsive master transcription factors hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α/2α, and their functions in breast cancer, with a focus on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We have shown SphK2 is associated with HIF-1α in protein complexes, and is enriched at the promoters of HIF target genes, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), where it enhances local histone H3 acetylation and transcription. S1P specifically binds to the PAS domains of HIF-1α. SphK2, and HIF-1α expression levels are elevated in metastatic estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and TNBC clinical tissue specimens compared to healthy breast tissue samples. To determine if S1P formation in the nucleus by SphK2 is a key regulator of HIF functions, we found using a preclinical TNBC xenograft mouse model, and an existing selective SphK2 inhibitor K-145, that nuclear S1P, histone acetylation, HIF-1α expression, and TNBC tumor growth were all reduced in vivo. Our results suggest that S1P and SphK2 in the nucleus are linked to the regulation of HIF-1α/2α functions associated with breast cancer progression, and may provide potential therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W3004006925,"Background More than 50% of patients with infective endocarditis (IE) develop an indication for surgery. Despite its benefit, surgery is associated with a high incidence of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and mortality, which may be linked to increased release of inflammatory mediators during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). We therefore assessed plasma cytokine profiles in patients undergoing valve surgery with or without IE. Methods We performed a prospective case-control pilot study comparing patients undergoing cardiac valve surgery with or without IE. Plasma profiles of inflammatory mediators were measured at 7 defined time points and reported as median (interquartile). The degree of MODS was measured using sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score. Results Between May and December 2016 we included 40 patients (20 in each group). Both groups showed similar distribution of age and gender. Patients with IE had higher preoperative SOFA (6.9± 2.6 vs 3.8 ± 1.1, p<0.001) and operative risk scores (EuroSCORE II 18.6±17.4 vs. 1.8±1.3, p<0.001). In-hospital mortality was higher in IE patients (35% vs. 5%; p<0.001). Multiple organ failure was the cause of death in all non-survivors. At the end of CPB, median levels of following inflammatory mediators were higher in IE compared to control group: IL-6 (119.73 (226.49) vs. 24.48 (40.09) pg/ml, p = 0.001); IL-18 (104.82 (105.99) vs. 57.30 (49.53) pg/ml, p<0.001); Mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM) (2.06 (1.58) vs. 1.11 (0.53) nmol/L, p = 0.003); MR- pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP) (479.49 (224.74) vs. 266.55 (308.26) pmol/l, p = 0.028). IL-1β and TNF- α were only detectable in IE patients and first after starting CPB. Plasma levels of IL-6, IL-18, MRproADM, and MRproANP during CPB were significantly lower in survivors than in those who died. Conclusion The presence of infective endocarditis during cardiac valve surgery is associated with increased inflammatory response as evident by higher plasma cytokine levels and other inflammatory mediators. Actively reducing inflammatory response appears to be a plausible therapeutic concept. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: NCT02727413."
https://openalex.org/W3005161615,"Background Oral cancer is one of the most common diseases globally. Conventional oral examination and histopathological examination are the two main clinical methods for diagnosing oral cancer early. VELscope is an oral cancer-screening device that exploited autofluorescence. It yields inconsistent results when used to differentiate between normal, premalignant and malignant lesions. We develop a new method to increase the accuracy of differentiation. Materials and methods Five samples (images) of each of 21 normal mucosae, as well as 31 premalignant and 16 malignant lesions of the tongue and buccal mucosa were collected under both white light and autofluorescence (VELscope, 400-460 nm wavelength). The images were developed using an iPod (Apple, Atlanta Georgia, USA). Results The normalized intensity and standard deviation of intensity were calculated to classify image pixels from the region of interest (ROI). Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) classifiers were used. The performance of both of the classifiers was evaluated with respect to accuracy, precision, and recall. These parameters were used for multiclass classification. The accuracy rate of LDA with un-normalized data was increased by 2% and 14% and that of QDA was increased by 16% and 25% for the tongue and buccal mucosa, respectively. Conclusion The QDA algorithm outperforms the LDA classifier in the analysis of autofluorescence images with respect to all of the standard evaluation parameters."
https://openalex.org/W3005051824,"Filamentous fungi reproduce asexually or sexually, and the processes of asexual and sexual development are tightly regulated by a variety of transcription factors. In this study, we characterized a Zn2Cys6 transcription factor in two Aspergillus species, A. nidulans (AN5859) and A. flavus (AFLA_046870). AN5859 encodes a Zn2Cys6 transcription factor, called ZcfA. In A. nidulans, ΔzcfA mutants exhibit decreased fungal growth, a reduction in cleistothecia production, and increased asexual reproduction. Overexpression of zcfA results in increased conidial production, suggesting that ZcfA is required for proper asexual and sexual development in A. nidulans. In conidia, deletion of zcfA causes decreased trehalose levels and decreased spore viability but increased thermal sensitivity. In A. flavus, the deletion of the zcfA homolog AFLA_046870 causes increased conidial production but decreased sclerotia production; these effects are similar to those of zcfA deletion in A. nidulans development. Overall, these results demonstrate that ZcfA is essential for maintaining a balance between asexual and sexual development and that some roles of ZcfA are conserved in Aspergillus spp."

https://openalex.org/W3004702247,"Antipsychotic medication, stress, gender, and age are factors that influence prolactin levels in patients with psychosis. The aim of the study was to investigate the level of prolactin response to antipsychotic treatment in acute patients, taking into account the total duration of psychosis.The study was conducted on 170 acute patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and bipolar disorder. Subjects were divided into three subgroups according to the duration of the psychosis (less than 5 years, between 5 and 10 years and more than 10 years of disorder duration). The initial prolactin response under antipsychotic treatment was measured, while the severity of the psychiatric symptoms was assessed with the BPRS (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale). Hyperprolactinemia was found in 120 (70.6%) patients, amongst which 80 (66.7%) were females and 40 (33.3%) were males. The average increase in prolactinemia was 2.46 times the maximum value in women, and 1.59 times in men. Gender (β = 0.27, p<0.0001), type of antipsychotic medication according to potency of inducing hyperprolactinemia (β = -0.23, p<0.003), and the duration of psychosis over 10 years (β = -0.15, p = 0.04) significantly predicted prolactin levels, when age, diagnosis, antipsychotic category (conventional/atypical/combinations of antipsychotics), and BPRS total scores were controlled for.Prolactin levels in patients treated with antipsychotic medication appeared to depend on patients' gender, on the type of antipsychotic medication according to potency of inducing hyperprolactinemia, and on the duration of the psychosis. An increase in prolactin levels was associated with female gender, while the use of prolactin sparing antipsychotics and a duration of psychosis over 10 years were associated with lower prolactin levels."
https://openalex.org/W3005119316,"Plumbagin derived from the plant Plumbago indica, known as Chitrak in India, is an example of a medicinal compound used traditionally to cure a variety of ailments. Previous reports have indicated that it can inhibit the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of the deadly disease TB. In this investigation, we provide an insight into its mode of action. We show here that a significant mycobacterial target that is inhibited by plumbagin is the enzyme ThyX, a form of thymidylate synthase, that is responsible for the synthesis of dTMP from dUMP in various bacterial pathogens, including Mtb. Using a purified preparation of the recombinant version of Mtb ThyX, we demonstrate that plumbagin, a 2,4 napthoquinone, but not lawsone, a structurally related medicinal compound, inhibits its activity in vitro. We also show that the intracellular [dTTP]/[dATP] ratio in Mycobacterium smegmatis (Msm) cells decrease upon treatment with plumbagin, and this, in turn, leads to cell death. Such a conclusion is supported by the observation that over-expression of thyx in the plumbagin treated Msm cells leads to the restoration of viability. The results of our investigation indicate that plumbagin kills mycobacterial cells primarily by targeting ThyX, a vital enzyme required for their survival."
https://openalex.org/W3005446640,"The effect of culture on strategic interaction has been widely explored. However, the effect of the cultural background on focal point selection in tacit coordination games has not yet been examined. To accomplish this goal, in this study we have focused on the individual level of analysis. That is, we constructed a strategic profile to model the behavior of each individual player and then used unsupervised learning methods on the individual data points. We have chosen to examine two groups of participants, Israelis (ICB) and Chinese (CCB), each belonging to a different cultural background representing individualist and collectivist societies, respectively. Clustering the individual strategic profiles has allowed us to gain further insights regarding the differences between the behavioral strategies of each cultural group. The results of this study demonstrate that the cultural background has a profound effect on the strategic profile and on the ability to succeed in tacit coordination games. Moreover, the current study emphasizes the importance of relying on the individual level of analysis and not only on the group level of analysis. The implications of these results and potential future studies are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3004531728,"Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a swine enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes significant economic losses in swine industry. Current studies on TGEV internalization mainly focus on viral receptors, but the internalization mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we used single-virus tracking to obtain the detailed insights into the dynamic events of the TGEV internalization and depict the whole sequential process. We observed that TGEVs could be internalized through clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis, and the internalization of TGEVs was almost completed within ~2 minutes after TGEVs attached to the cell membrane. Furthermore, the interactions of TGEVs with actin and dynamin 2 in real time during the TGEV internalization were visualized. To our knowledge, this is the first report that single-virus tracking technique is used to visualize the entire dynamic process of the TGEV internalization: before the TGEV internalization, with the assistance of actin, clathrin, and caveolin 1 would gather around the virus to form the vesicle containing the TGEV, and after ~60 seconds, dynamin 2 would be recruited to promote membrane fission. These results demonstrate that TGEVs enter ST cells via clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytic, actin-dependent, and dynamin 2-dependent pathways."
https://openalex.org/W3005240173,"Background 
In Bangladesh, pneumonia has a higher mortality among malnourished children aged <5 years. Evaluating pneumonia etiology among malnourished children may help improve empiric treatment guidelines.


Methods 
During April 2015—December 2017, we conducted a case-control study among severe acute malnourished (SAM) children aged <5 years admitted to the Dhaka hospital of International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b). We enrolled hospital admitted SAM children with clinical or radiological pneumonia as cases (during April 2015 to March 2017) and hospital admitted SAM children without any respiratory symptom in the past 10 days before admission as controls (during February 2016 to December 2017). We tested nasopharyngeal wash from both case and control for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), influenza viruses, human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV), rhinovirus and adenovirus by singleplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. To identify the independent association of pneumonia with viral pathogens during February 2016 to March 2017, we used multivariable logistic regression for calculating adjusted odds ratios.


Results 
We enrolled 360 cases and 334 controls. For case and control the median age was 8 months (IQR: 5–13) and 11 months (IQR: 6–18) (p = 0.001) respectively. Weight/age Z-score was -4.3 (SD ±0.7) for cases and -4.1 (SD ±1.1) for controls (p = 0.01). Among cases 68% had both clinical and radiological pneumonia, 1% had clinical pneumonia and 31% had only radiological pneumonia. Respiratory virus detection was high in cases compared to controls [69.9% (251) vs. 44.8% (148), p = 0.0001]. The most frequently detected viruses among cases were rhinoviruses (79, 22.0%) followed by RSV (32, 8.9%), adenovirus (23, 6.4%), HPIV (22, 6.1%), influenza virus (16, 4.5%), and HMPV (16, 4.5%). Among the controls, rhinoviruses (82, 24.8%) were most commonly detected one followed by adenovirus (26,7.9%), HMPV (5, 1.5%), HPIV (4, 1.2%), RSV (3, 0.9%), and influenza virus (2, 0.6%). RSV (OR 13.1; 95% CI: 1.6, 106.1), influenza virus (OR 8.7; 95% CI: 1.0, 78.9), HPIV (3.8; 95% CI: 1.0, 14.8), and HMPV (2.7; 95% CI: 1.3, 5.5) were independently associated with pneumonia while compared between 178 cases and 174 controls.


Conclusion 
Viral etiology of pneumonia in SAM children were mainly attributable to RSV, influenza, HPIV and HMPV. Our study findings may help in planning further studies targeting vaccines or drugs against common respiratory viruses responsible for pneumonia among SAM children."
https://openalex.org/W3004837376,"Injury of renal tubular epithelial cells is a key feature of the pathogenicity associated with tubulointerstitial fibrosis and other kidney diseases. HUWE1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, acts by participating in ubiquitination and degradation of its target proteins. However, the detailed mechanisms by which HUWE1 might regulate fibrosis in renal tubular epithelial cells have not been established. Here, the possible regulation of renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis by HUWE1 was investigated by examining the expression of HUWE1 and EGFR in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) mice. Markedly consistent reciprocal changes in HUWE1 and EGFR expression were observed at the protein and mRNA levels in the kidney after UUO injury. Expression of HUWE1 inhibited TGF-β-induced injury to HK-2 cells, while HUWE1 overexpression decreased the expression of EGFR. Further analysis indicated that HUWE1 physically interacted with EGFR and promoted its ubiquitination and degradation. HUWE1 expression also showed clinical relevance in renal disease, as it notably decreased in multiple types of clinical nephropathy, while EGFR expression significantly increased when compared to the normal kidney. Therefore, this study demonstrated that HUWE1, which serves as an E3 ubiquitin ligase specific for EGFR, promotes EGFR ubiquitination and degradation, thereby regulating EGFR expression and providing protection against kidney injury."
https://openalex.org/W3004958728,"An increased prevalence of allergies and an increased incidence of breast cancer have been observed. The hypothesis that atopy may have a protective effect against the risk of different types of breast cancer was evaluated.In this study, 11,101 patients (11,101 women with a mean age of 55.2±14.7 years) with different types of breast cancer were tested for allergies. Allergies were confirmed based on the retrospective analysis of allergy diagnostic procedures in patients who had been previously diagnosed with breast cancer. The retrospective prevalence rates of active allergic diseases, including allergic rhinitis, bronchial asthma and atopic dermatitis, were assessed. All patients were also analyzed for bronchial asthma and allergic rhinitis according to the relevant guidelines. A group of healthy control patients was used for the comparisons.The women with breast cancer had a significantly lower incidence of IgE-mediated allergic diseases than the controls. The odds ratios (ORs) for allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and bronchial asthma were 0.61 (95% CI: 0.57-0.73), 0.17 (95% CI: 0.11-0.44), and 0.73 (95% CI: 0.65-0.83), respectively. The mean serum concentrations of total IgE were significantly lower in the study population of women with breast cancer than in the patients of the control group (39.2 ± 26.2 kU/L vs. 108.5 ± 38.5 kU/L; p = 0.002).Our results suggest that the overall incidence of allergies, especially allergic rhinitis, is lower in patients with certain types of cancer than in individuals who did not have cancer. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings."
https://openalex.org/W3005525993,"To accurately evaluate expression levels of target genes, stable internal reference genes is required for normalization of quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) data. However, there have been no systematical investigation on the stability of reference genes used in the bedstraw weed, Galium aparine L. (BGA). In this study, the expression profiles of seven traditionally used reference genes, namely 18S, 28S, ACT, GAPDH, EF1α, RPL7 and TBP in BGA were assessed under both biotic (developmental time and tissue), and abiotic (temperature, regions and herbicide) conditions. Four analytical algorithms (geNorm, Normfinder, BestKeeper and the ΔCt method) were used to analyze the suitability of these genes as internal reference genes. RefFinder, a comprehensive analytical software, was used to rank the overall stability of the candidate genes. The optimal normalization internal control genes were ranked as: 28S and RPL7 were best for all the different experimental conditions (developmental stages, tissues, temperature, regions and herbicide treatment); 28S and RPL7 for developmental stages; TBP and GAPDH for different tissues; 28S and GAPDH were relatively stable for different temperature; 28S and TBP were suitable for herbicide treatment. A specific set of reference genes were recommended for each experimental condition in BGA."
https://openalex.org/W3004629413,"Background Urinary incontinence (UI) is a common geriatric syndrome associated with physical and cognitive impairments. The association between type of UI and sedentary behaviour (SB) has not been explored. Aim To determine association between moderate-severe UI, or any stress UI (SUI) or any urgency UI (UUI) and SB in community-dwelling older women. Methods Women aged 60 and over from the 2005–2006 cycle of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) with objectively measured (accelerometer) and self-reported SB and UI data were selected. Multivariate models exploring association between moderate-severe UI and SB, or SUI and SB, or UUI and SB were analysed using logistic regression adjusted for factors associated with UI. Results In the overall sample of 459 older women, 23.5% reported moderate-severe UI, 50.5% reported any SUI and 41.4% reported any UUI. In bivariate analysis objectively measured proportion of time in SB was associated with moderate-severe UI and UUI (p = 0.014 and p = 0.047) but not SUI. Average duration of SB bouts in those with moderate-severe UI or any SUI was no longer than older women reporting no continence issues, but it was significantly (19%) longer in older women with any UUI (mean difference 3.2 minutes; p = 0.001). Self-reported SB variables were not associated with any type of UI. Multivariate analysis showed an association between UUI and a longer average duration of SB bouts (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.01–1.09, p = 0.006) but no association with moderate-severe UI or SUI. Conclusion UUI was significantly associated with increased average duration of SB bouts in community-dwelling older women. The importance of objective measurement of SB is highlighted and suggests that decreasing time in prolonged sitting may be a target intervention to reduce UUI. Future studies are required to further explore the association between SB and incontinence."
https://openalex.org/W3004795351,"In this study we assess the impact of corporate governance on the risk investment behavior of firms and its implications on firms’ growth rate. Using a sample of non-financial companies from 10 countries over a period leading to the recent global financial crisis, we documented that the corporate governance has a nonlinear (inverted U-shape) impact on the companies’ investment risk, meaning that the investment risk is increasing up to a level of corporate governance of 0.61 (as measured by our comprehensive index), while at higher levels of corporate governance the investment risk is decreasing. For the models of sales growth and assets growth it is shown that predicted investment risk has a positive effect on firms’ growth measures. Moreover, the two growth models are not moving independently and a shock to one of the growth measures (sales or assets) affects the other growth measure in the same direction. Additionally, we evaluated the effect of financial crisis on both the growth measures and the risk measure. The effect of financial crisis was captured in both measures in 2009, with higher impact on the growth of sales."
https://openalex.org/W3005153837,"Remote limb ischemic conditioning (RLIC) is a clinically feasible method in which brief, sub-lethal bouts of ischemia protects remote organs or tissues from subsequent ischemic injury. A single session of RLIC can improve exercise performance and increase muscle activation. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to assess the effects of a brief, two-week protocol of repeated RLIC combined with strength training on strength gain and neural adaptation in healthy young adults. Participants age 18–40 years were randomized to receive either RLIC plus strength training (n = 15) or sham conditioning plus strength training (n = 15). Participants received RLIC or sham conditioning over 8 visits using a blood pressure cuff on the dominant arm with 5 cycles of 5 minutes each alternating inflation and deflation. Visits 3–8 paired conditioning with wrist extensors strength training on the non-dominant (non-conditioned) arm using standard guidelines. Changes in one repetition maximum (1 RM) and electromyography (EMG) amplitude were compared between groups. Both groups were trained at a similar workload. While both groups gained strength over time (P = 0.001), the RLIC group had greater strength gains (9.38 ± 1.01 lbs) than the sham group (6.3 ± 1.08 lbs, P = 0.035). There was not a significant group x time interaction in EMG amplitude (P = 0.231). The RLIC group had larger percent changes in 1 RM (43.8% vs. 26.1%, P = 0.003) and EMG amplitudes (31.0% vs. 8.6%, P = 0.023) compared to sham conditioning. RLIC holds promise for enhancing muscle strength in healthy young and older adults, as well as clinical populations that could benefit from strength training."
https://openalex.org/W3005197962,"Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a devastating disease occurring in small grain cereals worldwide. The disease results in the reduction of grain yield, and mycotoxins accumulated in grain are also harmful to both humans and animals. It has been reported that response to pathogen infection may be associated with the morphological and developmental traits of the host plant, e.g. earliness and plant height. Despite many studies, effective markers for selection of barley genotypes with increased resistance to FHB have not been developed. In the present study, we investigated 100 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) of spring barley. Plants were examined in field conditions (three locations) in a completely randomized design with three replications. Barley genotypes were artificially infected with spores of Fusarium culmorum before heading. Apart from the main phenotypic traits (plant height, spike characteristic, grain yield), infected kernels were visually scored and the content of deoxynivalenol (DON) mycotoxin was investigated. A set of 70 Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) were detected through phenotyping of the mapping population in field conditions and genotyping using a barley Ilumina 9K iSelect platform. Six loci were detected for the FHB index on chromosomes 2H, 3H, 5H, and 7H. A region on the short arm of chromosome 2H was detected in which many QTLs associated with FHB- and yield-related traits were found. This study confirms that agromorphological traits are tightly related to FHB and should be taken into consideration when breeding barley plants for FHB resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3004451076,"The first year after birth is an ideal time to offer contraception services, as many women have many opportunities to be in contact with the health care system. Nevertheless, a large number of postpartum women in developing countries do not use the service owing to the interplay of factors operating at various stages. Therefore, this study aimed to assess predictors of modern contraceptive use in the extended postpartum period.A community based retrospective cross-sectional study was done among 1281 women who gave birth within 12 months preceding the survey. Kaplan-Meier plots and log rank tests were used to explore the rate of modern contraceptive use. The Weibull regression survival model with multivariate frailty was employed to identify the predictors of time to contraception.Of the respondents, 59.1% (95% CI: 56.8%-62.2%) had started using modern contraceptive methods within 12 months after birth. By the second month after birth, only 11.1 percent of the women surveyed started to use a contraceptive method, which increased steadily to 25.9%, 37.7%, and 59.5% at 6, 9, and 12 months, respectively. The most preferred contraceptive method was injectable (71.5%), followed by implants (21.5%). Women's education (aHR = 1.29; 95%CI: 1.02, 1.66), four or more antenatal care (aHR = 1.59; 95% CI: 1.22, 2.06), early initiation of antenatal care (aHR = 2.03; 95% CI: 1.28, 3.21), and early postnatal checkup (aHR = 1.39; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.73) were statistically significant predictors of earlier initiation of modern contraceptive methods.A substantial proportion of women did not use modern contraceptive methods in the first year after birth. Maternal services were found to be the sole predictors in postpartum contraceptive use. Findings suggest the importance of linking postpartum family planning along the continuum of care. The observed heterogeneity at cluster level also urges the need of disaggregating data for decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W3004587493,"Several studies suggest that 63% of primate species are currently threatened due to deforestation, pet-trade, and bushmeat hunting. Successful primate conservation strategies require effective educational programs capable of enhancing critical system-thinking and responsible behavior towards these species. Arts-based conservation education can simultaneously foster cognitive and emotional processes. In this paper, we evaluate an arts-based educational program focused on the conservation of black howler monkeys (Alouatta pigra). Our goals were to determine (1) whether children’s knowledge changed with our educational techniques, (2) if there was a particular educational technique that better improved the children’s learning, and (3) the children’s emotional feedback regarding the whole program. A total of 229 children from communities located in primate-habitat areas, both inside and outside protected areas, participated in the study. Different educational techniques were tested (storytelling, theater and shadow puppets), contrasted with a control group, and evaluated through an analysis of drawings. Our results showed that children’s knowledge increase with each art-based technique, with storytelling being the most effective for children’s learning. Specific drawings indicators also revealed the increase of children’s knowledge and a decrease of misconceptions between pre and post evaluations. Finally, a satisfaction survey about the program showed a high positive feedback. The study highlights the value of designing multidisciplinary projects, where arts-based education program (grounded in scientific information) has shown to be a successful way to communicate animal knowledge and promote conservation."
https://openalex.org/W3004728976,"Upwelling is an important source of inorganic nutrients in marine systems, yet little is known about how gradients in upwelling affect primary producers on coral reefs. The Southern Line Islands span a natural gradient of inorganic nutrient concentrations across the equatorial upwelling region in the central Pacific. We used this gradient to test the hypothesis that benthic autotroph ecophysiology is enhanced on nutrient-enriched reefs. We measured metabolism and photophysiology of common benthic taxa, including the algae Porolithon, Avrainvillea, and Halimeda, and the corals Pocillopora and Montipora. We found that temperature (27.2–28.7°C) was inversely related to dissolved inorganic nitrogen (0.46–4.63 μM) and surface chlorophyll a concentrations (0.108–0.147 mg m-3), which increased near the equator. Contrary to our prediction, ecophysiology did not consistently track these patterns in all taxa. Though metabolic rates were generally variable, Porolithon and Avrainvillea photosynthesis was highest at the most productive and equatorial island (northernmost). Porolithon photosynthetic rates also generally increased with proximity to the equator. Photophysiology (maximum quantum yield) increased near the equator and was highest at northern islands in all taxa. Photosynthetic pigments also were variable, but chlorophyll a and carotenoids in Avrainvillea and Montipora were highest at the northern islands. Phycobilin pigments of Porolithon responded most consistently across the upwelling gradient, with higher phycoerythrin concentrations closer to the equator. Our findings demonstrate that the effects of in situ nutrient enrichment on benthic autotrophs may be more complex than laboratory experiments indicate. While upwelling is an important feature in some reef ecosystems, ancillary factors may regulate the associated consequences of nutrient enrichment on benthic reef organisms."
https://openalex.org/W3005162800,"Mindful individuals are able to acknowledge mind wandering and live in the present moment in a nonjudgmental way. Previous studies have found that both mind wandering and mindfulness are associated with subjective well-being. However, the main predictor of happiness is personality; more specifically, happier people are emotionally stable and extraverted. The present study aimed to explore the contribution of the five factors of personality, dispositional mindfulness facets and a mindfulness intervention to happiness. A sample of 372 university students was assessed with the NEO-Five Factor Inventory, and another sample of 217 community adults answered the Big Five Personality Trait Short Questionnaire. Both samples, 589 participants in all, completed the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire and the Subjective Happiness Scale. Furthermore, 55 participants from the general population sample took a 6-week training course in meditation and developing mindfulness. The regression analyses showed that emotional stability and extraversion traits were the strongest predictors of subjective well-being. Nonetheless, the nonjudging facet, which is nonevaluative/acceptance awareness of thoughts and feelings, still remained a significant predictor of happiness when personality was accounted for. Finally, mindfulness training did not increase subjective well-being. Being nonjudgmental of one's inner thoughts, feelings and sensations contributes to happiness even when personality is taken into account. Accordingly, it seems reasonable that mindfulness training that intends to improve subjective well-being should focus on noticing thoughts without judging them."
https://openalex.org/W3004816611,"As part of its response to a perturbation, an animal often needs to reposition its body. Inertia acts to oppose the corrective motion, delaying the completion of the movement-we refer to this elapsed time as inertial delay. As animal size increases, muscle moment arms also increase, but muscles are proportionally weaker, and limb inertia is proportionally larger. Consequently, the scaling of inertial delays is complex. Our intent is to determine how quickly different sized animals can produce corrective movements when their muscles act at their force capacity, relative to the time within which those movements need to be performed. Here, we quantify inertial delay using two biomechanical models representing common scenarios in animal locomotion: a distributed mass pendulum approximating swing limb repositioning (swing task), and an inverted pendulum approximating whole body posture recovery (posture task). We parameterized the anatomical, muscular, and inertial properties of these models using literature scaling relationships, then determined inertial delay for each task across a large range of movement magnitudes and the full range of terrestrial mammal sizes. We found that inertial delays scaled with an average of M0.28 in the swing task and M0.35 in the posture task across movement magnitudes-larger animals require more absolute time to perform the same movement as small animals. The time available to complete a movement also increases with animal size, but less steeply. Consequently, inertial delays comprise a greater fraction of swing duration and other characteristic movement times in larger animals. We also compared inertial delays to the other component delays within the stimulus-response pathway. As movement magnitude increased, inertial delays exceeded these sensorimotor delays, and this occurred for smaller movements in larger animals. Inertial delays appear to be a challenge for motor control, particularly for bigger movements in larger animals."

The mapping of the 45S gene in the Coreidae family demonstrated that the species presented markings on the autosomes, with the exception of Acanthocephala parensis and Leptoglossus gonagra that showed markers on m-chromosomes. Most species of the Pentatomidae family showed marking in the autosomes, except for two species that had 45S rDNA on X sex chromosome (Odmalea sp. and Graphosoma lineatum) and two that showed marking on the X and Y sex chromosomes. Species of the Pyrrhocoridae family showed 18S rDNA markers in autosomes, X chromosome as well as in Neo X. The Largidae and Scutelleridae families were represented by only one species that showed marking on the X sex chromosome and on a pair of autosomes, respectively. Based on this, we characterized the arrangement of 45S DNAr in the chromosomes of 12 new species of Heteroptera and discussed the main evolutionary events related to the genomic reorganization of these species during the events of chromosome and karyotype evolution in Pentatomomorpha infraorder."
https://openalex.org/W3005327465,"To solve the problem of low accuracy in traditional fault diagnosis methods, a novel method of combining generalized frequency response function(GFRF) and convolutional neural network(CNN) is proposed. In order to accurately characterize system state information, this paper proposed a variable step size least mean square (VSSLMS) adaptive algorithm to calculate the second-order GFRF spectrum values under normal and fault states; In order to improve the ability of fault feature extraction, a convolution neural network (CNN) with gradient descent learning rate and alternate convolution layer and pooling layer is designed to extract the fault features from GFRF spectrum. In the proposed method, the second-order GFRF spectrum of each state of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) is obtained by VSSLMS; Then, the two-dimension GFRF spectrum, which is regarded as the gray value of the image,will be further transformed into image. Finally, the CNN is trained with learning rate by gradient descent way to realize the fault diagnosis of PMSM. Experimental results indicate that the accuracy of proposed method is 98.75%, which verifies the reliability of the proposed method in application of PMSM fault diagnosis."

There are over 1,500 cases reported globally in which majority of cases are from Thailand followed by Vietnam. The disease leads to meningitis in human with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) as the most common complication suffered by the patients. Early diagnosis and treatment is important to prevent severe neurological complication. In this study, we aim to develop an easy-to-use risk score to promote early diagnosis and detection of S.suis in patients who potentially develop hearing loss.Data from a retrospective review of 13-year S.suis patient records in a tertiary hospital in Chiang Mai, Northern, Thailand was obtained. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were employed to develop a predictive model. The clinical risk score was constructed from the coefficients of significant predictors. Area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AuROC) was identified to verify the model discriminative performance. Bootstrap technique with 1000-fold bootstrapping was used for internal validation.Among 133 patients, the incidence of hearing loss was 31.6% (n = 42). Significant predictors for S. suis hearing loss were meningitis, raw pork consumption, and vertigo. The predictive score ranged from 0-4 and correctly classified 81.95% patients as being at risk of S.suis hearing loss. The model showed good power of prediction (AuROC: 0.859; 95%CI 0.785-0.933) and calibration (AuROC: 0.860; 95%CI 0.716-0.953).To our best knowledge, this is the first risk scoring system development for S.suis hearing loss. We identified meningitis, raw pork consumption and vertigo as the main risk factors of S.suis hearing loss. Future studies are needed to optimize the developed scoring system and investigate its external validity before recommendation for use in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2930186488,"N-of-1 trials allow inference between two treatments given to a single individual. Most often, clinical investigators analyze an individual's N-of-1 trial data with usual t-tests or simple nonparametric methods. These simple methods do not account for serial correlation in repeated observations coming from the individual. Existing methods accounting for serial correlation require simulation, multiple N-of-1 trials, or both. Here, we develop t-tests that account for serial correlation in a single individual. The development includes effect size and precision calculations, both of which are useful for study planning. We then use Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate statistical properties of these serial t-tests, namely, Type I and II errors, and confidence interval widths, and compare these statistical properties to those of analogous usual t-test. The serial t-tests clearly outperform the usual t-tests commonly used in reporting N-of-1 results. Examples from N-of-1 clinical trials in fibromyalgia patients and from a behavioral health setting exhibit how accounting for serial correlation can change inferences. These t-tests are easily implemented and more appropriate than simple methods commonly used; however, caution is needed when analyzing only a few observations."
https://openalex.org/W3004440577,"Between 2007 and 2010 a Q fever epidemic in Dutch dairy goat farms caused a large Q fever outbreak in human residents in the southern part of the Netherlands. Here we characterize the transmission of Coxiella burnetii, the aetiological agent of Q fever, between infected and susceptible dairy goat farms by estimating a spatial transmission kernel. In addition, we characterize the zoonotic transmission of C. burnetii by estimating the spatial kernel for transmission from infected farms to neighbouring residents. Whereas the range of between-farm transmission is comparable to the scale of the Netherlands, likely due to long-range between-farm contacts such as animal transport, the transmission risk from farms to humans is more localized, although still extending to 10 km and beyond. Within a range of about 10 km, the transmission risk from an infected goat farm to a single resident is of the same order of magnitude as the farm-to-farm transmission risk per animal in a receiving farm. We illustrate how, based on the estimated kernels, spatial patterns of transmission risks between farms and from farms to residents can be calculated and visualized by means of risk maps, offering further insight relevant to policy making in a one-health context."
https://openalex.org/W3004623245,"There are growing demands to ensure animal health and, from a broader perspective, animal welfare, especially for farmed animals. In addition to the newly developed welfare assessment protocols, which provide a harmonised method to measure animal health during farm visits, the question has been raised whether data from existing data collections can be used for an assessment without a prior farm visit. Here, we explore the possibilities of developing animal health scores for fattening pig herds using a) official meat inspection results, b) data on antibiotic usage and c) data from the QS (QS Qualität und Sicherheit GmbH) Salmonella monitoring programme in Germany. The objective is to aggregate and combine these register-like data into animal health scores that allow the comparison and benchmark of participating pig farms according to their health status. As the data combined in the scores have different units of measure and are collected in different abattoirs with possibly varying recording practices, we chose a relative scoring approach using z-transformations of different entrance variables. The final results are aggregated scores in which indicators are combined and weighted based on expert opinion according to their biological significance for animal health. Six scores have been developed to describe different focus areas, such as ""Respiratory Health"", ""External Injuries/ Alterations"", ""Animal Management"", ""Antibiotic Usage"", ""Salmonella Status"" and ""Mortality"". These ""focus"" area scores are finally combined into an ""Overall Score"". To test the scoring method, existing routine data from 1,747 pig farm units in Germany are used; these farm units are members of the QS Qualität und Sicherheit GmbH (QS) quality system. In addition, the scores are directly validated for 38 farm units. For these farm units, the farmers and their veterinarians provided their perceptions concerning the actual health status and existing health problems. This process allowed a comparison of the scoring results with actual health information using kappa coefficients as a measure of similarity. The score testing of the focus area scores using real information resulted in normalised data. The results of the validation showed satisfactory agreement between the calculated scores for the project farm units and the actual health information provided by the related farmers and veterinarians. In conclusion, the developed scoring method could become a viable benchmark and risk assessment instrument for animal health on a larger scale under the conditions of the German system."

Hair cortisol concentration (HCC) is an increasingly used measure of systemic cortisol concentration. However, determinants of HCC in children and adolescents are unclear because few prospective studies have been conducted to date.


Study design 
We followed 725 children in Project Viva, a pre-birth cohort study of mothers and children, who provided hair samples at mid-childhood (median age: 7.7 years) or early adolescence (median age: 12.9 years). We examined associations of various factors measured from pregnancy to mid-childhood with HCC in mid-childhood and early adolescence, as well as change in HCC between these time points (ΔHCC).


Results 
There were 426 children with HCC measurements in both mid-childhood and early adolescence, 173 children with measures only in mid-childhood, and 126 with measures only in early adolescence. HCC was lower in mid-childhood (median 1.0pg/mg [interquartile range, IQR: 0.5, 2.4]) than early adolescence (2.2pg/mg [1.1, 4.4]). In multivariable-adjusted regression models, female sex (β = -0.41, 95% CI: -0.67, -0.15) and birth weight-for-gestational age z-score (β = -0.19, 95% CI: -0.33, -0.04) were associated with lower mid-childhood HCC, while prenatal smoking was associated with higher mid-childhood HCC (β = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.04, 1.01). In early adolescence, child age (β = 0.34 per year, 95% CI: 0.21, 0.46) female sex (β = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.10, 0.57), and maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (β = 0.15 per 5-kg/m2, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.29) were positively associated with HCC. Child anthropometric measures and biomarker concentrations were not associated with HCC.


Conclusion 
Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, maternal prenatal smoking, and low birth weight were associated with higher mid-childhood and adolescent HCC. However, few postnatal characteristics were associated with HCC."
https://openalex.org/W3004618483,"Calcium binding proteins are expressed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system and disruption of their activity has major consequences in a wide array of cellular processes, including transmission of nociceptive signals that are processed at the level of the spinal cord. We previously reported that the calcium binding protein, hippocalcin-like 4 (Hpcal4), is heavily expressed in interneurons of the superficial dorsal horn, and that its expression is significantly downregulated in a TR4 mutant mouse model that exhibits major pain and itch deficits due to loss of a subpopulation of excitatory interneurons. That finding suggested that Hpcal4 may be a contributor to the behavioral phenotype of the TR4 mutant mouse. To address this question, here we investigated the behavioral consequences of global deletion of Hpcal4 in a battery of acute and persistent pain and itch tests. Unexpectedly, with the exception of a mild reduction in acute baseline thermal responses, Hpcal4-deficient mice exhibit no major deficits in pain or itch responses, under normal conditions or in the setting of tissue or nerve injury. Taken together, our results indicate that the neural calcium sensor Hpcal4 likely makes a limited contribution to pain and itch processing."
https://openalex.org/W3004657891,"Background Chronic autoimmune demyelinating polyneuropathies (CADP) result in impaired sensorimotor function. However, anecdotal clinical observations suggest the development of cognitive deficits during the course of disease. Methods We tested 16 patients with CADP (11 patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, 4 patients with multifocal motor neuropathy and 1 patient with multifocal acquired demyelinating sensory and motor neuropathy) and 40 healthy controls (HC) with a neuropsychological test battery. Blood-brain-barrier dysfunction (BBBd) in patients was assessed retrospectively by analysing the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) status at the time the diagnosis of CAPD was established. Results CADP patients failed on average in 1.7 out of 9 neuropsychological tests (SD ± 1.25, min. 0, max. 5). 50% of the CADP patients failed in at least two neuropsychological tests and 44.3% of the patients failed in at least two different cognitive domains. CADP patients exhibiting BBBd at the time of first diagnosis failed in more neuropsychological tests than patients with intact integrity of the BBB (p < 0.05). When compared directly with the HC group, CADP patients performed worse than HC in tests measuring information processing ability and speed as well as phonemic verbal fluency after adjusting for confounding covariates. Conclusions Our results suggest that mild to moderate cognitive deficits might be present in patients with CAPD. One possible tentative explanation, albeit strong evidence is still lacking for this pathophysiological mechanism, refers to the effect of autoimmune antibodies entering the CNS via the dysfunctional blood-brain barrier typically seen in some of the CADP patients."

Herpes zoster is a common viral disease, in which the most debilitating complication is post-herpetic neuralgia, which can have a very large negative impact on quality of life. The aim of this study was to investigate whether stroke increases the risk of herpes zoster.This cohort study compared patients who had herpes zoster with and without a first incident of stroke. The Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database was utilized to identify 20,551 stroke patients and 20,551 controls matched for age, gender, age categories and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score categories at a one-to-one ratio. Cox proportional-hazards regression models were employed to estimate herpes zoster risk in the stroke group relative to general population.Compared to the control group, the stroke group had a greater risk for herpes zoster, especially within 1 year after stroke (adjust HR = 25.27). Both hemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke were significantly associated with herpes zoster (hemorrhagic type (IRR = 2.31, 95% CI, 1.67-3.20); ischemic type (IRR = 2.51, 95% CI 2.09-3.02)). However, the hemorrhagic stroke patients had a higher risk of herpes zoster ophthalmicus (IRR = 12.46, 95% CI 4.00-38.76) whereas the ischemic stroke patients had a higher risk of post-herpetic neuralgia (IRR = 2.24, 95% CI 1.56-3.20).Physicians should know about that adults with stroke have a higher than normal risk of herpes zoster. Thus, physicians must be acquainted with proper antiviral therapy and pain control to bring down the morbidity that ensues from herpes zoster. Use of herpes zoster vaccine may be considered in stroke patients."

In the emerging field of histone demethylase inhibitors, JMJD1C therefore became a potential target. Depletion of Jmjd1c expression significantly reduced cytokine-independent growth in an MPN cell line, indicating a role for JMJD1C in MPN disease maintenance. Here, we investigated a potential role for the demethylase in MPN disease initiation. We introduced a Cre-inducible JAK2V617F mutation into Jmjd1c knockout mice. We show that Jmjd1c is dispensable, both for healthy hematopoiesis as well as for JAK2V617F-driven MPN disease initiation. Jmjd1c knockout mice did not show any significant changes in peripheral blood composition. Likewise, introduction of JAK2V617F into Jmjd1c-/- mice led to a similar MPN phenotype as JAK2V617F in a Jmjd1c wt background. This indicates that there is a difference between the role of JMJD1C in leukemic stem cells and in MPN. In the latter, JMJC domain-containing family members may serve redundant roles, compensating for the loss of individual proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3004422281,"Objectives Tinnitus is a common symptom among patients with hearing loss, and many studies have reported successful tinnitus suppression with hearing devices. Active middle ear implantation of the Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB) is a good alternative to existing hearing devices. This study evaluated the effects of VSB implantation on tinnitus and sought to identify the main audiological factor that affects tinnitus suppression. Methods The study participants were 16 adults who had tinnitus with sensorineural hearing loss, and who underwent VSB implantations. Pure-tone audiometry; word recognition test; tinnitus handicap inventory (THI); and visual analog scale (VAS) assessment of loudness, awareness, and annoyance were performed before and 12 months after surgery. Changes in hearing threshold, word recognition scores (WRS), THI scores, and VAS scores were analyzed. Results VAS scores for loudness (mean difference: 1.9, 95% CI: 0.6, 3.1), awareness (mean difference: 1.6, 95% CI: 0.4, 2.8), and annoyance (mean difference: 1.7, 95% CI: 0.7, 2.8) showed significant improvements from baseline to 12 months after surgery. In addition, THI scores showed a significant decrease (mean difference: 13.8, 95% CI: 2.9, 24.9). The average hearing threshold level, WRS, and most comfortable level (MCL) also showed significant improvements at 12 months after surgery (mean difference: 17.3, 95% CI: 13.3, 21.3; mean difference: −7.6, 95% CI: −15.1, −0.1; mean difference: 26.3, 95% CI: 22.9, 29.6, respectively). Among the aforementioned factors, changes in MCL were best correlated with those in THI scores (mean difference: 2.55, 95% CI: 0.90, 4.21). Conclusion A VSB implant is beneficial to subjects with tinnitus accompanied by sensorineural hearing loss. The changes in THI scores best correlated with those in MCL. This improvement may represent a masking effect that contributes to tinnitus suppression in patients with VSB implants."

Based on phylogenetic analysis, 12 assemblage B MLGs formed two main clades, MLG-SW (10-12, 18) and MLG-SW (13, 14, 16, 17), the other four MLG-SW (15, 19, 20, 21) were scattered throughout the phylogenetic tree in this study. Using multilocus genotyping, this study expands our understanding of the occurrence of Giardia infection and genetic variation in Giardia in captive non-human primates from zoos in China."
https://openalex.org/W3005165450,"Rhesus macaque (RM) rhadinovirus (RRV) is a simian gamma-2 herpesvirus closely related to human Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). RRV is associated with the development of diseases in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) co-infected RM that resemble KSHV-associated pathologies observed in HIV-infected humans, including B cell lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD) and lymphoma. Importantly, how de novo KSHV infection affects the expression of host genes in humans, and how these alterations in gene expression affect viral replication, latency, and disease is unknown. The utility of the RRV/RM infection model provides a novel approach to address these questions in vivo, and utilizing the RRV bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) system, the effects of specific viral genes on host gene expression patterns can also be explored. To gain insight into the effects of RRV infection on global host gene expression patterns in vivo, and to simultaneously assess the contributions of the immune inhibitory viral CD200 (vCD200) molecule to host gene regulation, RNA-seq was performed on pre- and post-infection lymph node (LN) biopsy samples from RM infected with either BAC-derived WT (n = 4) or vCD200 mutant RRV (n = 4). A variety of genes were identified as being altered in LN tissue samples due to RRV infection, including cancer-associated genes activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AICDA), glypican-1 (GPC1), CX3C chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1), and Ras dexamethasone-induced 1 (RasD1). Further analyses also indicate that GPC1 may be associated with lymphomagenesis. Finally, comparison of infection groups identified the differential expression of host gene thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP), suggesting a possible mechanism by which vCD200 negatively affects RRV viral loads in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3005347924,"In order to intercept moving objects, we need to predict the spatiotemporal features of the motion of both the object and our hand. Our errors can result in updates of these predictions to benefit interceptions in the future (adaptation). Recent studies claim that task-relevant variability in baseline performance can help adapt to perturbations, because initial variability helps explore the spatial demands of the task. In this study, we examined whether this relationship is also found in interception (temporal domain) by looking at the link between the variability of hand-movement speed during baseline trials, and the adaptation to a temporal perturbation. 17 subjects performed an interception task on a graphic tablet with a stylus. A target moved from left to right or vice versa, with varying speed across trials. Participants were instructed to intercept this target with a straight forward movement of their hand. Their movements were represented by a cursor that was displayed on a screen above the tablet. To prevent online corrections we blocked the hand from view, and a part of the cursor’s trajectory was occluded. After a baseline phase of 80 trials, a temporal delay of 100 ms was introduced to the cursor representing the hand (adaptation phase: 80 trials). This delay initially caused participants to miss the target, but they quickly accounted for these errors by adapting to most of the delay of the cursor. We found that variability in baseline movement velocity is a good predictor of temporal adaptation (defined as a combination of the rate of change and the asymptotic level of change after a perturbation), with higher variability during baseline being associated with better adaptation. However, cross-correlation results suggest that the increased variability is the result of increased error correction, rather than exploration."
https://openalex.org/W3005446105,"Objective Several studies have shown an association between intracranial pressure and the diameter of the optic nerve sheath measured by transbulbar ultrasonography. To understand the pathophysiology of this phenomenon, we aimed to measure the changes of the optic nerve, optic nerve sheath and perineural space separately with increasing intracranial pressure in a porcine model. Methods An external ventricular drain was placed into the third ventricle through a right paramedian burrhole in eight anesthesized pigs. The diameters of the optic nerve and the optic nerve sheath were measured while the intracranial pressure (ICP) was increased in steps of 10mmHg from baseline up to 60 mmHg. Results The median diameters of the optic nerve (ON) increased from 0.36 cm (baseline– 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 cm to 0.45 cm) to 0.68 cm (95% CI 0.57 cm to 0.82 cm) at ICP of 60 mmHg (p<0.0001) and optic nerve sheath (ONS) from 0.88 cm (95% CI 0.79 cm to 0.98 cm) to 1.24 cm (95% CI 1.02 cm to 1.38 cm) (p< 0.002) while the median diameter of the perineural space (PNS) (baseline diameter 95% CI 0.40 cm to 0.59 cm to diameters at ICP 60 95% CI 0.38 cm to 0.62 cm) did not change significantly (p = 0.399). Multiple comparisons allowed differentiation between baseline and values ≥40 mmHg for ON (p = 0.017) and between baseline and values ≥ 50mmHg for ONS (p = 0.006). A linear correlation between ON (R2 = 0.513, p<0.0001) and ONS (R2 = 0.364, p<0.0001) with ICP was found. The median coefficient of variation for intra- and inter-investigator variability was 8% respectively 2.3%. Conclusion Unexpectedly, the increase in ONS diameter with increasing ICP is exclusively related to the increase of the diameter of the ON. Further studies should explore the reasons for this behaviour."

https://openalex.org/W3004621155,"Atomic Force Microscopy was utilized to study the morphology of Gag, ΨRNA, and their binding complexes with lipids in a solution environment with 0.1Å vertical and 1nm lateral resolution. TARpolyA RNA was used as a RNA control. The lipid used was phospha-tidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). The morphology of specific complexes Gag-ΨRNA, Gag-TARpolyA RNA, Gag-PI(4,5)P2 and PI(4,5)P2-ΨRNA-Gag were studied. They were imaged on either positively or negatively charged mica substrates depending on the net charges carried. Gag and its complexes consist of monomers, dimers and tetramers, which was confirmed by gel electrophoresis. The addition of specific ΨRNA to Gag is found to increase Gag multimerization. Non-specific TARpolyA RNA was found not to lead to an increase in Gag multimerization. The addition PI(4,5)P2 to Gag increases Gag multimerization, but to a lesser extent than ΨRNA. When both ΨRNA and PI(4,5)P2 are present Gag undergoes comformational changes and an even higher degree of multimerization."
https://openalex.org/W3004992346,"Bioethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass has received increasing attention over the past decade. Many attempts have been made to reduce the cost of bioethanol production by combining the separate steps of the process into a single-step process known as consolidated bioprocessing. This requires identification of organisms that can efficiently decompose lignocellulose to simple sugars and ferment the pentose and hexose sugars liberated to ethanol. There have been many attempts in engineering laboratory strains by adding new genes or modifying genes to expand the capacity of an industrial microorganism. There has been less attention in improving bioethanol-related processes utilizing natural variation existing in the natural ecotypes. In this study, we sought to identify genomic loci contributing to variation in saccharification of cellulose and fermentation of glucose in the fermenting cellulolytic fungus Neurospora crassa through quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis. We identified one major QTL contributing to fermentation of glucose and multiple putative QTL’s underlying saccharification. Understanding the natural variation of the major QTL gene would provide new insights in developing industrial microbes for bioethanol production."
