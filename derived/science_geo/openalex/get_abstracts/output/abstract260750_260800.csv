https://openalex.org/W2057467676,"Heme is an ancient and ubiquitous molecule present in organisms of all kingdoms, composed of an atom of iron linked to four ligand groups of porphyrin. A high amount of free heme, a potential amplifier of the inflammatory response, is a characteristic feature of diseases with increased hemolysis or extensive cell damage. Here we demonstrate that heme, but not its analogs/precursors, induced tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) secretion by macrophages dependently on MyD88, TLR4, and CD14. The activation of TLR4 by heme is exquisitely strict, requiring its coordinated iron and the vinyl groups of the porphyrin ring. Signaling of heme through TLR4 depended on an interaction distinct from the one established between TLR4 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) since anti-TLR4/MD2 antibody or a lipid A antagonist inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α secretion but not heme activity. Conversely, protoporphyrin IX antagonized heme without affecting LPS-induced activation. Moreover, heme induced TNF-α and keratinocyte chemokine but was ineffective to induce interleukin-6, interleukin-12, and interferon-inducible protein-10 secretion or co-stimulatory molecule expression. These findings support the concept that the broad ligand specificity of TLR4 and the different activation profiles might in part reside in its ability to recognize different ligands in different binding sites. Finally, heme induced oxidative burst, neutrophil recruitment, and heme oxygenase-1 expression independently of TLR4. Thus, our results presented here reveal a previous unrecognized role of heme as an extracellular signaling molecule that affects the innate immune response through a receptor-mediated mechanism. Heme is an ancient and ubiquitous molecule present in organisms of all kingdoms, composed of an atom of iron linked to four ligand groups of porphyrin.

Identification of pathogens by cells of the innate immune system is performed by evolutionarily conserved receptors that recognize microorganisms and viral molecules, the so-called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (1Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6152) Google Scholar, 2Akira S. Takeda K. Nature Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6669) Google Scholar). This initial event has a critical role in the inflammatory response against infection and is a prerequisite to the subsequent activation of the adaptative immune response. In the past years, an extended concept of the functions of the innate immune system has emerged, including not only the defense against pathogens but also causing sterile inflammation and tissue remodeling after cell damage. The absence of microorganisms in several inflammatory pathologies indicates that endogenous molecules from damaged cells must be responsible for the triggering, amplification, or perpetuation of the immune/inflammatory response (3Matzinger P. Annu Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 991-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (3986) Google Scholar, 4Beutler B. Nature. 2004; 430: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). Inflammation is observed in diseases of increased hemolysis or extensive cell damage, associated or not with the presence of an infectious agent. Some of the most threatening human diseases, because of the severity and/or the global distribution, have intraor extravascular hemolysis as one of the central phenomena in the pathophysiology. The accumulation of large amounts of hemoproteins or free heme, such as in a blood clot or after vascular deposition, overwhelms the capacity of heme scavengers (5Muller-Eberhard U. Javid J.

Blood. 2002; 100: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Heme has several pro-inflammatory activities including leukocyte activation and migration, up-regulation of adhesion molecules, and induction of cytokines and acute phase proteins (7Graça-Souza A.V.

It has been assumed and widely accepted that the mechanism by which heme exerts its damaging effects relies on its amphipathic nature, allowing heme to intercalate in the cell or organelle membranes, and on its prooxidant effects (8Wagener F.A.

The feline leukemia virus subgroup C receptor, a member of the major facilitator superfamily of transporter proteins, is involved in heme export across the cell membrane affecting erythroid maturation and cell survival (14Quigley J.G.

A heme importer, named heme carrier protein 1 (HCP1), was recently characterized in duodenal cells (15Shayeghi M. Latunde-Dada G.O. Oakhill J.S. Laftah A.H. Takeuchi K. Halliday N. Khan Y. Warley A.

These pigments consist of heme molecules crystallized into dimers through reciprocal iron-carboxylate bonds to one of the propionic side chains of the porphyrin, and the dimers form chains linked by hydrogen bonds in the crystal (18Pagola S.

We hypothesized whether heme would activate cells of the innate immune system through binding to a pattern recognition receptor, such as a TLR. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism whereby heme activates macrophages and observed that heme induces the secretion of TNF-α by macrophages dependently of MyD88, TLR4, and CD14.

Shizuo Akira (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan), Douglas Golenbock (University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA), and Ricardo Gazzinelli (Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil). C3H/HePas and C3H/HeJ mice were provided by Dr. Fernando Cunha (Universidade de São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, Brazil). The animals were kept at a constant temperature (25 °C) with free access to chow and water in a room with a 12-h light/dark cycle. The experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Welfare Committee. Reagents—Polymixin B was obtained from New Bedford Laboratories. Limulus amebocyte assay was obtained from Cambrex. LPS O111:B4 was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. FeCl3 and FeSO4 were obtained from Reagen. MTS510 was a generous gift from Dr. Kensuke Miyake. E5564 was a generous gift from Eisai Research Institute of Boston, Inc. Heme and its analogs were obtained from Porphyrin Products. Porphyrins were dissolved in NaOH 0.1 n, diluted in RPMI, and filtered. Stock solutions of porphyrins were prepared in the dark to avoid free radical generation immediately before use. Heme used contained <0.01 endotoxin units (<1 pg) in 200 μm heme. 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester (CM-H2DCFDA) was obtained from Molecular Probes. Cell Culture and Stimulation—Peritoneal macrophages were obtained 4 days after intraperitoneal instillation of 2 ml of thioglycollate 3% by peritoneal washing with chilled RPMI. Cells were seeded at 2 × 105/well in 96-well plates in RPMI. Nonadherent cells were removed by washing, and adherent cells were stimulated in the absence of serum, and after the indicated periods, the supernatant was collected and frozen until cytokine determination. Dendritic cells (DCs) were generated as described previously (23Inaba K. Inaba M. Romani N. Aya H. Deguchi M. Ikehara S. Muramatsu S. Steinman R.M. J. Exp.

Briefly, bone marrow was harvested from the tibia and femur of C57/Bl6. The cells were resuspended at 106/ml in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) supplemented with vitamins, amino acids, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, recombinant murine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and recombinant murine IL-4 at 10 ng/ml. After 5 days, fresh medium was added to culture, and with 7 days of culture, the cells were collected, and DCs were separated by Optiprep gradient (Sigma) by centrifugation at 600 × g for 30 min at 24 °C. This protocol generated more than 75% of CD11c+ cells. DCs were plated in 96-well at a density of 2 × 105/well and incubated for 16 h with the stimuli in supplemented RPMI in the absence of serum, after which the supernatant was recovered for the determination of cytokines by ELISA. Human monocyte-derived macrophages from healthy donors were isolated by plastic adherence of peripheral blood mononuclear cells previously obtained by density gradient centrifugation (Hystopaque, Sigma). In summary, 2 × 106 peripheral blood mononuclear cells were plated in 48-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum for 1 h, 5% CO2, 37 °C. Non-adherent cells were washed out, and adherent cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% human serum (Sigma), during 7 days, for differentiation in macrophages. Macrophage purity was above 90%, as checked by flow cytometry (FACScan, BD Biosciences) analysis using anti-CD3 and anti-CD16 antibodies (BD Biosciences). Cytokine Measurements—The concentrations of TNF-α, KC, IL-6, IP-10, and IL-12 were determined using ELISA. All the measurements were performed in duplicate following the manufacturer's instructions (Peprotec and R&D). Western Blot Analysis for MAPK Phosphorylation and IκB Degradation—To evaluate ERK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation, elicited peritoneal macrophages were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells/well, non-adherent cells were removed by washing with medium, and adherent cells were stimulated with LPS or heme, as indicated in the figure legend. After 1 h, cells were lysed in a buffer consisting of Tris-HCl (50 mm), NaCl (150 mm), Nonidet P-40 1%, sodium deoxycholate 0.25%, EDTA (1 mm), aprotinin (5 μg/ml), leupeptin (5 μg/ml), pepstatin (5 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), sodium orthovanadate (1 mm), and NaF (1 mm); pH 7.5. Cell lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatants were boiled and subjected to electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gel (12%) in reducing conditions. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane at 4 °C for 2 h. After this, the membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline solution with 0.05% of Tween 20 (TBS-T) and 5% of fat-free milk. The membranes were incubated for 2 h with anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (1/2500), diluted in blocking solution, washed in TBS-T, and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG polyclonal antibody (1/10,000), and the bands were revealed by chemiluminescence using the ECL substrate. The normalization of MAPK phosphorylation was performed by stripping membranes during 30 min at 50 °C in stripping buffer (100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7). After stripping, membranes were washed with TBS-T, blocked with 5% fat-free milk TBS-T, and incubated with rabbit anti-ERK1/2 (1/6000) for 2 h, and detection was performed as described above. The degradation of IκB protein was analyzed by Western blot with polyclonal rabbit anti-IκB (Sigma) diluted (1/1000) in block solution. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Costimulatory Molecule Expression—DCs were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or phycoeritrin-conjugated monoclonal antibody in the presence of anti-CD16 antibody for 30 min at 4 °C. For control, nonbinding isotype-matched fluorescein isothiocyanate- and phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated rat anti-mouse IgGs were employed (anti-CD40, anti-CD80, anti-CD82). The expression of costimulatory molecules at the surface of DCs was analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Assay of Reactive Oxygen Species Generation—Macrophages (106 cells/tube) were incubated with 2 μm CM-H2DCFDA in Hanks' balanced salt solution for 45 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2 atmosphere. Macrophages were stimulated with 30 μm heme for 1 h. ROS production was analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Acute Peritonitis in Mice—Acute peritonitis was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of heme (60 μg/cavity) in a volume of 200 μl. Control groups received an intraperitoneal injection of endotoxin-free saline solution or LPS (200 ng/cavity) in the same volume. After 4 h of injection, the animals were killed under ether anesthesia, and their peritoneal cavities were rinsed with 3 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline. Total leukocytes in the peritoneal fluid were determined on Neubauer chambers after dilution in Turk's solution. Differential counting of leukocytes was carried out on Diff-Quik (Baxter Travenol Laboratories)-stained slices. HO-1 Expression—Macrophages (5 × 106/well) were stimulated with heme (3–30 μm) in the presence of 1% fetal calf serum for 5 h. Cells were disrupted with radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. HO-1 expression detection was performed by Western blotting using a goat anti-HO-1 antibody and a peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The detection was performed using the ECL system. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Results were analyzed using a statistical software package (GraphPad Prism 4). Statistical differences among the experimental groups were evaluated by analysis of variance with Newman-Keuls correction or with the Student's t test. Values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. Heme Induces TNF-α Secretion by Mouse and Human Macrophages—To determine the effect of heme on macrophages, we used the secretion of TNF-α as readout. Heme induced TNF-α production by mouse peritoneal macrophages in a dose- and time-dependent fashion (Fig. 1, A and B). The secretion of TNF-α was induced by concentrations of heme as low as 10 μm, in the absence of serum. The presence of serum (10% fetal calf serum) blocked the heme-induced TNF-α secretion (Fig. 1A). The effect of heme on TNF-α production occurred as early as 4 h after stimulation (Fig. 1B). A major concern when characterizing any putative ligand of TLR, especially endogenous, is the possible presence of microbial derived contaminants. Determination of the content of endotoxin by the limulus assay demonstrated that heme preparations used along the study were free of any detectable LPS. Furthermore, heme induced TNF-α in the presence of polymyxin B in a concentration that fully abolished the LPS effect (Fig. 1C). Heme also induced the secretion of TNF-α by human macrophages in the presence of polymixin B (Fig. 1D). Heme but Not Heme Analogs/Precursors Induced TNF-α Secretion by Macrophages—To characterize the molecular determinants on heme required to causing macrophage activation, we tested the ability of porphyrin rings without iron or with metal substitutions to induce TNF-α secretion. Fig. 2A shows the molecular structure of the utilized porphyrins. Protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) is the immediate precursor of heme, differing from it by one atom of iron. PPIX, in a wide range of concentrations tested, was unable to induce the secretion of TNF-α by macrophages (Fig. 2B). Similarly, neither the heme analogs with metal substitutions nor iron alone, in the Fe+2 or Fe+3 states, were able to induce TNF-α (Fig. 2C). We also tested the effect of iron-mesoporphyrin IX, a heme analog that has the atom of iron but has two ethyl groups substituting its vinyl groups (Fig. 2A). All mesoporphyrins, including this analog, were also unable to induce TNF-α secretion by macrophages (Fig. 2D). Thus, both the coordinated iron and the vinyl groups in the porphyrin ring are necessary for the effect of heme on TNF-α secretion. Heme-induced TNF-α Secretion Is Dependent of MyD88, TLR4, and CD14—The adaptor molecule MyD88 is essential for the induction of TNF-α secretion initiated by activation of several TLRs (2Akira S. Takeda K. Nature Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6669) Google Scholar). The lack of MyD88 completely abrogated the induction of TNF-α secretion induced by heme, suggesting that heme is an agonist of a TLR (Fig. 3A). Previous studies have shown that endogenous molecules are able to activate TLRs, especially TLR2 and TLR4 (2Akira S. Takeda K. Nature Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6669) Google Scholar). To determine which TLR is involved in sensing heme, we used macrophages deficient in these TLRs. Macrophages obtained from wild-type or Tlr2-deficient mice (Tlr2–/–) released similar amounts of TNF-α in response to heme or LPS stimulation but not to Pam3Cys, a TLR2 ligand (Fig. 3B). In contrast, macrophages obtained from C3H/HeJ mice (Tlr4d/d), a strain that caries a natural point mutation of the Tlr4 gene (25Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6422) Google Scholar), were still responsive to Pam3Cys but failed to release TNF-α following heme or LPS stimulation (Fig. 3C). Signaling through TLR4 requires the coreceptor CD14 such that in the absence of CD14, the concentrations of LPS required to achieve the same activation become several times higher (21Haziot A. Ferrero E. Kontgen F. Hijiya N. Yamamoto S. Silver J. Stewart C.L. Goyert S.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 407-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Accordingly, Cd14–/– macrophages did not respond to heme and showed a low response to LPS (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that MyD88, TLR4, and CD14 are essential to heme-induced TNF-α secretion. It has been recently shown that hemozoin and β-hematin activate the innate immune system dependently of TLR9 (17Coban C. Ishii K.J. Kawai T. Hemmi H. Sato S. Uematsu S. Yamamoto M. Takeuchi O. Itagaki S. Kumar N. Horii T. Akira S. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested whether heme-induced TNF-α secretion would also require TLR9. Treatment of wild-type and Tlr9–/– macrophages with heme caused a similar induction of TNF-α, thus indicating that the effect of heme on TNF-α secretion was independent of TLR9 (data not shown). Moreover, in our experimental conditions, β-hematin was unable to induce TNF-α by macrophages, whereas β-hematin dissociation into heme by alkali incubation caused the induction of TNF-α, and this activity was dependent of TLR4 (data not shown). TLR4 Recognizes LPS and Heme Independently—The antibody MTS510 recognizes TLR4/MD2 in the absence of LPS, and preincubation of macrophages with this antibody partially blocks the secretion of TNF-α induced by LPS (26Akashi S. Shimazu R. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Takeda K. Kimoto M. Miyake K. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3471-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In fact, MTS510 reduced the TNF-α secretion induced by LPS but did not influence the effect of heme (Fig. 4A). Several natural or synthetic lipid A analogs are potent antagonists of LPS (27Rossignol D.P. Lynn M. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2005; 6: 496-502PubMed Google Scholar). Here we used E5564, a lipid A analog that inhibits the binding of LPS to TLR4/MD2 (28Mullarkev M. Rose J.R. Bristol J. Kawata T. Kimura A. Kobayashi S. Przetak M. Chow J. Gusovsky F. Christ W.J. Rossignol D.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 304: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 29Visintin A. Halmen K.A. Latz E. Monks B.G. Golenbock D.T. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 6465-6472Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Pretreatment with E5564 abolished the secretion of TNF-α induced by LPS but not by heme (Fig. 4A). We postulated that an analog of heme such as PPIX could act as antagonist, competing for the same receptor site used by heme. PPIX dose-dependently inhibited the TNF-α secretion induced by heme but did not interfere with the effect of LPS (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that LPS and heme, despite using TLR4 as a receptor, likely use different binding sites. Moreover, our results unequivocally demonstrate that the effect of heme on TNF-α secretion is not due to contamination with microbial products. Heme Induces IκBα Degradation and MAPKs Phosphorylation—Activation of NFκB is essential for TNF-α production induced by LPS (2Akira S. Takeda K. Nature Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6669) Google Scholar). To determine the involvement of this pathway on heme-induced macrophage activation, we characterized the content of IκBα by Western blot. Degradation of IκBα by heme and LPS indicated the activation of the NFκB signaling pathway (Fig. 5A). Activation of macrophages and DC by LPS causes TLR4-dependent phosphorylation of selected tyrosine kinases such as p38 and ERK1/2 (2Akira S. Takeda K. Nature Rev.

The stimulation of macrophages by heme caused the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 but only modestly affected p38 (Fig. 5, B and C). The kinetics of phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by heme was different when compared with LPS. Within 20 min of stimulation, both heme and LPS caused the phosphorylation of ERK1/2; however, at 60 min, only the cells treated with heme still had a sustained ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Similar to LPS, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by heme was abrogated in macrophages from TLR4 mutant mice (Fig. 5D). Heme Induced TNF-α and KC but Is Unable to Induce IL-6, IL-12, and IP-10 or Costimulatory Molecule Expression—Activation of TLR4 by LPS triggers the MyD88-dependent and the TRIF-dependent pathways (2Akira S. Takeda K. Nature Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6669) Google Scholar). The MyD88 pathway leads to the activation of NFκB and MAPKs and the induction of cytokines such as TNF-α, KC, IL-6, and IL-12. The TRIF pathway signals through IRF-3 and is required for the induction of IFN-β, IP-10, and co-stimulatory molecule expression. The simultaneous analysis of TNF-α, KC, IL-6, and IP-10 concentrations in the supernatants of macrophages stimulated with heme or LPS demonstrated that heme induced TNF-α and KC but was unable to induce IL-6 or IP-10 secretion (Fig. 6, A–D). The effect of heme on KC also depended on a functional TLR4 (data not shown). Heme, although inducing TNF-α on bone marrow-derived DC, did not induce IL-12 secretion or increase the expression of co-stimulatory molecules, including CD40, CD80, and CD82, or presented adjuvant properties upon immunization of mice with ovalbumin (Fig. 6, E–G; data not shown). Similarly, heme induced the expression of TNF-α mRNA but not of IL-6 or IFN-β by macrophages (data not shown). The in"

This process of angiogenesis is regulated through hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-mediated transcription of angiogenic factors. It is recognized that inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin can diminish the process of angiogenesis. Our work shows that activation of mTOR by Ras homologue enriched in brain (Rheb) overexpression potently enhances the activity of HIF1alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A secretion during hypoxia, which is reversed with rapamycin. Mutants of Rheb, which do not bind guanine nucleotide (D60K, D60V, N119I, and D122N) and are unable to activate mTOR, inhibit the activity of HIF when overexpressed. We show that regulatory associated protein of mTOR (Raptor) interacts with HIF1alpha and requires an mTOR signaling (TOS) motif located in the N terminus of HIF1alpha. Furthermore, a mutant of HIF1alpha lacking this TOS motif dominantly impaired HIF activity during hypoxia and was unable to bind to the co-activator CBP/p300. Rapamycin treatments do not affect the stability of HIF1alpha and modulate HIF activity via a Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-independent mechanism. We demonstrate that the high levels of HIF activity in cells devoid of TSC2 can be reversed by treatments with rapamycin or the readdition of TSC2. Our work explains why human cancers with aberrant mTOR signaling are prone to angiogenesis and suggests that inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin might be a suitable therapeutic strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2032013289,"Hypertrophic scars occur following cutaneous wounding and result in severe functional and esthetic defects. The pathophysiology of this process remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that mechanical stress applied to a healing wound is sufficient to produce hypertrophic scars in mice. The resulting scars are histopathologically identical to human hypertrophic scars and persist for more than six months following a brief (one-week) period of augmented mechanical stress during the proliferative phase of wound healing. Resulting scars are structurally identical to human hypertrophic scars and showed dramatic increases in volume (20-fold) and cellular density (20-fold). The increased cellularity is accompanied by a four-fold decrease in cellular apoptosis and increased activation of the prosurvival marker Akt. To clarify the importance of apoptosis in hypertrophic scar formation, we examine the effects of mechanical loading on cutaneous wounds of animals with altered pathways of cellular apoptosis. In p53-null mice, with down-regulated cellular apoptosis, we observe significantly greater scar hypertrophy and cellular density. Conversely, scar hypertrophy and cellular density are significantly reduced in proapoptotic BclII-null mice. We conclude that mechanical loading early in the proliferative phase of wound healing produces hypertrophic scars by inhibiting cellular apoptosis through an Akt-dependent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2092652991,"Most neuronal networks, even in the absence of external stimuli, produce spontaneous bursts of spikes separated by periods of reduced activity. The origin and functional role of these neuronal events are still unclear. The present work shows that the spontaneous activity of two very different networks, intact leech ganglia and dissociated cultures of rat hippocampal neurons, share several features. Indeed, in both networks: i) the inter-spike intervals distribution of the spontaneous firing of single neurons is either regular or periodic or bursting, with the fraction of bursting neurons depending on the network activity; ii) bursts of spontaneous spikes have the same broad distributions of size and duration; iii) the degree of correlated activity increases with the bin width, and the power spectrum of the network firing rate has a 1/f behavior at low frequencies, indicating the existence of long-range temporal correlations; iv) the activity of excitatory synaptic pathways mediated by NMDA receptors is necessary for the onset of the long-range correlations and for the presence of large bursts; v) blockage of inhibitory synaptic pathways mediated by GABAA receptors causes instead an increase in the correlation among neurons and leads to a burst distribution composed only of very small and very large bursts. These results suggest that the spontaneous electrical activity in neuronal networks with different architectures and functions can have very similar properties and common dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2137348639,"Brains are usually described as input/output systems: they transform sensory input into motor output. However, the motor output of brains (behavior) is notoriously variable, even under identical sensory conditions. The question of whether this behavioral variability merely reflects residual deviations due to extrinsic random noise in such otherwise deterministic systems or an intrinsic, adaptive indeterminacy trait is central for the basic understanding of brain function. Instead of random noise, we find a fractal order (resembling Lévy flights) in the temporal structure of spontaneous flight maneuvers in tethered Drosophila fruit flies. Lévy-like probabilistic behavior patterns are evolutionarily conserved, suggesting a general neural mechanism underlying spontaneous behavior. Drosophila can produce these patterns endogenously, without any external cues. The fly's behavior is controlled by brain circuits which operate as a nonlinear system with unstable dynamics far from equilibrium. These findings suggest that both general models of brain function and autonomous agents ought to include biologically relevant nonlinear, endogenous behavior-initiating mechanisms if they strive to realistically simulate biological brains or out-compete other agents."
https://openalex.org/W1977832158,"Epithelial Na+ absorption is regulated by Nedd4-2, an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that reduces expression of the epithelial Na+ channel ENaC at the cell surface. Defects in this regulation cause Liddle syndrome, an inherited form of hypertension. Previous work found that Nedd4-2 binds to ENaC via PY motifs located in the C termini of α-, β-, and γENaC. However, little is known about the mechanism by which Nedd4-2 regulates ENaC surface expression. Here we found that Nedd4-2 catalyzes ubiquitination of α-, β-, and γENaC; Nedd4-2 overexpression increased ubiquitination, whereas Nedd4-2 silencing decreased ubiquitination. Although Nedd4-2 increased both mono/oligoubiquitinated and multiubiquitinated forms of ENaC, monoubiquitination was sufficient for Nedd4-2 to reduce ENaC surface expression and reduce ENaC current. Ubiquitination was disrupted by Liddle syndrome-associated mutations in ENaC or mutation of the catalytic HECT domain in Nedd4-2. Several findings suggest that the interaction between Nedd4-2 and ENaC is localized to the cell surface. First, Nedd4-2 bound to a population of ENaC at the cell surface. Second, Nedd4-2 catalyzed ubiquitination of cell surface ENaC. Third, Nedd4-2 selectively reduced ENaC expression at the cell surface but did not alter the quantity of immature ENaC in the biosynthetic pathway. Finally, Nedd4-2 induced degradation of the cell surface pool of ENaC.

The epithelial Na+ channel ENaC functions in Na+ transport across epithelia in the kidney collecting duct and connecting tubule, lung, and distal colon, where it plays a critical role in Na+ homeostasis. The channel is composed of three homologous subunits (α-, β-, and γENaC) (reviewed in Refs. 1Schild L. Rev. Physiol. Biochem.

Mutations in β- and γENaC cause Liddle syndrome, an inherited form of hypertension (3Lifton R.P. Science. 1996; 272: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Moreover, most of the known genetic causes of hypertension are caused by defects in ENaC regulation. Defective ENaC regulation may also contribute to lung disease in cystic fibrosis (4Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Knowles M.R. Cantley L. Gatzy J.T. J. Clin. Investig. 1986; 78: 1245-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Thus, understanding the mechanisms that regulate ENaC may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of hypertension, cystic fibrosis, and other diseases of Na+ homeostasis. ENaC is regulated in large part by mechanisms that control its expression at the apical membrane of epithelia. Several findings have implicated an important role for Nedd4-2, an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. First, Nedd4-2 and ENaC interact through the binding of PY motifs (PPPXYXXL) located in the C termini of α-, β-, and γENaC to multiple WW domains in Nedd4-2 (5Kamynina E. Debonneville C. Bens M. Vandewalle A. Staub O. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 204-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Importantly, ENaC mutations that disrupt this interaction cause Liddle syndrome by increasing ENaC surface expression (6Snyder P.M. Price M.P. McDonald F.J. Adams C.M. Volk K.A. Zeiher B.G.

Finally, aldosterone and vasopressin regulate ENaC in part by inducing phosphorylation of Nedd4-2 (via serum- and glucocorticoid-induced kinase and cAMP-dependent protein kinase, respectively), which decreases Nedd4-2 binding to ENaC (9Debonneville C.

First, it is not known whether Nedd4-2 regulates ENaC directly, by catalyzing ubiquitination of one or more ENaC subunits, or indirectly, by catalyzing ubiquitination of an accessory protein. Staub et al. (13Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) reported that α- and γENaC are substrates for ubiquitination and that mutation of lysines at the N termini of these subunits increased ENaC surface expression. More recent work suggests that βENaC might also be a substrate for ubiquitination (14Malik B. Yue Q. Yue G. Chen X. Price S.R. Mitch W.E. Eaton D.C. Am. J.

However, it is not known whether Nedd4-2 or other ubiquitin ligases catalyze ENaC ubiquitination. Second, the cellular location at which Nedd4-2 binds to and regulates ENaC has not been identified. Nedd4-2 could interact with ENaC in the biosynthetic pathway and block its trafficking to the cell surface. Alternatively, Nedd4-2 could interact with ENaC at the cell surface and increase its endocytosis and/or degradation. In this work, our goal was to test the hypothesis that Nedd4-2 binds to ENaC and catalyzes its ubiquitination at the cell surface, which targets this pool of channels for degradation. cDNA Constructs—Human α-, β-, and γENaC (16McDonald F.J.

Nedd4-2WW1–4 was generated by mutating two residues in each of the four WW domains (WW1, V210W and H212G; WW2, V367W and H369G; WW3, I440W and H442G; WW4, I492W and H494G). These mutations abolish Nedd4-2 binding to ENaC, similar to previous work with Nedd4 (19Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. McDonald F.J. Bucher D.B. J. Biol.

Ubiquitination Assay—To detect ENaC ubiquitination, HEK 293T cells were transfected with or without cDNAs encoding ubiquitin-HA and α-, β-, and γENaC (one subunit contained FLAG epitope) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). In some studies, cells were cotransfected with Nedd4-2 (wild type or C821A) or green fluorescent protein (GFP, control) cDNA, or with siRNA against Nedd4-2 (10Snyder P.M. Steines J.C. Olson D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5042-5046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) or GFP (control). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 μm amiloride. To inhibit proteasomal degradation, 10 μm N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN) was added to some cells 2 h before lysis. 24 h after transfection, cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)), and 800 μg of protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody (1:300, Sigma) and immobilized protein A (Pierce). After extensive washing, immunoprecipitated (ubiquitinated) proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, detected by immunoblot with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody-peroxidase conjugate (1:5000, Sigma), and quantitated by densitometry. Cell Surface Biotinylation and Protein Interactions—HEK 293T cells were transfected with α-, β-, and γENaC (1 μg each) and Nedd4-2-HA (0.04 μg). 24 h later, the cells were washed with PBS-CM (PBS with 1 mm MgCl2 and CaCl2), cell surface proteins were labeled with 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) in PBS-CM for 30 min on ice, and then cells were quenched with 100 mm glycine in PBS-CM for 10 min on ice. After washing three times with PBS-CM, cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (0.4% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 63 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), and protease inhibitor mixture). Biotinylated (cell surface) and interacting proteins were isolated by incubating cell lysate with immobilized NeutrAvidin beads (Pierce) for 12 h at 4 °C. Following separation by SDS-PAGE, biotinylated αENaC and coprecipitated Nedd4-2 were detected by immunoblot. In some experiments, unbiotinylated ENaC subunits were immunoprecipitated from either the NeutrAvidin supernatant or the total cellular lysate. Cell Surface Ubiquitination—HEK 293T cells transfected with or without αENaC, β-FLAG, and γENaC, Nedd4-2, and ubiquitin-HA were biotinylated at 4 °C (to prevent protein trafficking) as above or not biotinylated as control. Following solubilization in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer, βENaC was immunoprecipitated (anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel) from 800 μg of cell lysate. βENaC was eluted from the gel by incubating with SDS-PAGE sample buffer (100 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, and 4% SDS) at 95 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was diluted with 11 volumes of lysis buffer, and biotinylated βENaC was isolated by incubation with immobilized NeutrAvidin beads and separated by SDS-PAGE. Ubiquitinated βENaC at the cell surface was detected by immunoblot (anti-HA antibody, 1:2000). Degradation of Cell Surface ENaC—HEK 293T cells were transfected with αENaC, β-FLAG, and γENaC (wild type or αY644A, βY620A, γY627A) with Nedd4-2 or GFP. 24 h after transfection, cells were biotinylated on ice for 30 min and then incubated at 37 °C for 0, 40, 80, or 120 min. Cell surface βENaC was isolated by incubation with immobilized NeutrAvidin beads, detected by immunoblot with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody-peroxidase conjugate, and quantitated by densitometry. Short-Circuit Current—Fischer rat thyroid cells on permeable filter supports were cotransfected with α-, β-, and γENaC (0.17 μg each) with or without Nedd4-2 (0.4 μg) and Ub-0K (0.5 μg) using TFX50 (Promega), as described previously (11Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. Thomas B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar); total cDNA was held constant with GFP cDNA. Short-circuit Na+ current was measured using modified Ussing chambers (Warner Instrument Corp.). The apical and basolateral surfaces were bathed in 135 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2.4 mm K2HPO4, 0.6 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) at 37 °C. Amiloride-sensitive short-circuit current was determined as the current difference with and without amiloride (10 μm) in the apical bathing solution. Nedd4-2 Catalyzes ENaC Ubiquitination—To determine which ENaC subunits are substrates for ubiquitination, we cotransfected HEK 293T cells with α-, β-, and γENaC (one of the subunits contained a FLAG epitope at its C terminus) with or without ubiquitin containing an HA epitope (Ub-HA). To observe ubiquitinated ENaC subunits, the cells were treated with ALLN to prevent proteasomal degradation. Total α-, β-, and γENaC were detected by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot (Fig. 1, bottom). Ubiquitinated ENaC subunits were isolated by immunoprecipitation of ubiquitin (anti-HA) and detected by immunoblot (anti-FLAG). We detected ubiquitinated α-, β-, and γENaC in cells cotransfected with Ub-HA but not in cells transfected separately with either ENaC or Ub-HA (Fig. 1, top). Interestingly, we detected at least two different ubiquitinated forms of each subunit. Faster migrating bands likely represent ENaC subunits with one or a few ubiquitins attached (monoubiquitinated or oligoubiquitinated), whereas slower migrating bands are multiubiquitinated (polyubiquitinated or poly-monoubiquitinated) ENaC. To test whether Nedd4-2 catalyzes ubiquitination of one or more ENaC subunits, we used two strategies. First, we overexpressed Nedd4-2. In these experiments, ALLN was omitted to reduce basal levels of ubiquitination. Fig. 2, A–C, shows representative immunoblots and Fig. 2, D–F, shows quantitation of multiubiquitinated (left panel) and mono/oligoubiquitinated (right panel) ENaC subunits. Nedd4-2 significantly increased ubiquitination of α-, β-, and γENaC (Fig. 2, A–C, compare lanes 1 and 2). Moreover, Nedd4-2 increased both the faster and the slower migrating forms. As controls for specificity, we did not detect ubiquitinated proteins in cells lacking ENaC (Fig. 2, A and C, lanes 5 and 7, and Fig. 2B, lane 7) or in cells expressing ENaC without Ub-HA and Nedd4-2 (lane 6). As a second strategy, we silenced expression of endogenous Nedd4-2 with Nedd4-2 siRNA. We characterized this siRNA in previous work; it selectively decreased Nedd4-2 protein levels (but not the related E3 ligase Nedd4), and it increased ENaC current in epithelia (10Snyder P.M. Steines J.C. Olson D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5042-5046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Here we found that Nedd4-2 siRNA decreased ubiquitination of αENaC (Fig. 3, A and B). Nedd4-2 HECT Domain and ENaC PY Motifs Are Required for ENaC Ubiquitination—The C terminus of Nedd4-2 contains a HECT domain. Through the binding of ubiquitin to Cys-821, this domain catalyzes ubiquitination of target proteins. Previous work indicates that the HECT domain is required for Nedd4-2 to inhibit ENaC (5Kamynina E. Debonneville C. Bens M. Vandewalle A. Staub O. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 204-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 20Goulet C.C. Volk K.A. Adams C.M. Prince L.S. Stokes J.B. Snyder P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30012-30017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Mutation of Cys-821 to Ala abolished Nedd4-2-mediated ubiquitination of α- and βENaC, as well as the slower migrating form of γENaC (Fig. 2, A–C, compare lanes 2 and 3, quantified in Fig. 2, D–F). Interestingly, the mutant Nedd4-2 increased the faster migrating mono- or oligoubiquitinated form of γENaC (when compared with the group without Nedd4-2), although much less than wild-type Nedd4-2 (Fig. 2, C and F). Thus, the catalytic activity of the HECT domain is required for Nedd4-2 to induce ubiquitination of αENaC, βENaC, and the slower migrating form of γENaC but not mono/oligoubiquitinated γENaC. Nedd4-2 binds to ENaC via PY motifs located in the cytoplasmic C terminus of each ENaC subunit. Mutation of these motifs prevents Nedd4-2 from inhibiting ENaC (5Kamynina E. Debonneville C. Bens M. Vandewalle A. Staub O. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 204-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). To test whether binding is required for ubiquitination, we disrupted the PY motifs. Deletion of this motif in βENaC by a Liddle syndrome mutation (R566X, indicated in Fig. 2 by βL) reduced Nedd4-2-induced ubiquitination of α- and γENaC (Fig. 2, A and C, compare lanes 2 and 4, quantitated in Fig. 2, D and F). Mutation of the PY motif (Y620A, indicated in Fig. 2 by βY-A) produced a minimal decrease in the faster migrating form of ubiquitinated βENaC (which did not reach statistical significance) but not the slower migrating form (Fig. 2B, lane 4, and Fig. 2E). However, simultaneous mutation of the PY motifs in α-, β-, and γENaC abolished ubiquitination of βENaC (Fig. 2, B and E). Taken together, these data suggest that Nedd4-2 binds to the PY motifs of ENaC subunits and then catalyzes ubiquitination via the HECT domain. Nedd4-2 and ENaC Interact at the Cell Surface—Although it is clear from previous work that Nedd4-2 binds to ENaC, the cellular location where this interaction occurs has not been identified. We hypothesized that Nedd4-2 interacts with ENaC at the cell surface. To test this hypothesis, we transfected HEK 293T cells with ENaC and Nedd4-2 (containing an HA epitope). Cell surface proteins were then biotinylated and isolated with NeutrAvidin beads. In this fraction of cell surface biotinylated proteins, we detected (by immunoblot) full-length (90-kDa) and proteolytically cleaved (65-kDa) forms of αENaC (Fig. 4A, bottom panel). Nedd4-2 was also present in this cell surface fraction in cells expressing ENaC but not in cells lacking ENaC (Fig. 4A, top panel). These results indicate that Nedd4-2 binds to ENaC at the cell surface. Moreover, they show that Nedd4-2 is not itself a substrate for biotinylation, consistent with its intracellular location. To test whether Nedd4-2 ubiquitinates ENaC at the cell surface, we subjected cells to cell surface biotinylation followed by sequential precipitation with anti-FLAG beads (to isolate ENaC) and then NeutrAvidin beads (to isolate cell surface ENaC). We then analyzed the ubiquitination state of cell surface ENaC by immunoblot for Ub-HA. Fig. 4B shows that βENaC was highly ubiquitinated in the presence but not in the absence of Nedd4-2. Together, the data suggest that Nedd4-2 binds to and ubiquitinates ENaC at the cell surface. Nedd4-2 Selectively Decreases Steady-state Levels of ENaC at the Cell Surface—If Nedd4-2 regulates ENaC at the cell surface, we predict that it should decrease steady-state levels of ENaC at the cell surface but have little effect on intracellular ENaC (which primarily reflects immature ENaC in the biosynthetic pathway). To test this prediction, we biotinylated cell surface proteins in cells transfected with ENaC (αENaC, β-FLAG, γENaC) and Nedd4-2 (0–0.5 μg). We separated biotinylated (surface) proteins from non-biotinylated (intracellular) proteins by binding to NeutrAvidin beads and then detected βENaC in each fraction by immunoblotting; Fig. 5A shows representative immunoblots, and Fig. 5B shows quantitation of the Nedd4-2 dose-response relationship. Nedd4-2 did not alter levels of intracellular βENaC (Fig. 5, A and B, top panels). In contrast, Nedd4-2 produced a dose-dependent decrease in βENaC at the cell surface (Fig. 5, A and B, bottom panels). Thus, Nedd4-2 selectively regulates ENaC at the cell surface. To test whether binding is required for Nedd4-2 to reduce ENaC surface expression, we used two strategies. First, we mutated the PY motif in βENaC (βY620A). In the absence of Nedd4-2, this mutation increased ENaC surface expression (Fig. 5A, bottom panel), consistent with previous work (6Snyder P.M. Price M.P. McDonald F.J. Adams C.M. Volk K.A. Zeiher B.G. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 969-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 8Knight K.K. Olson D.R. Zhou R. Snyder P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2805-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Moreover, it reduced the effect of Nedd4-2 on ENaC surface expression (Fig. 5, A and B, bottom panels). In contrast, this mutation had little effect on levels of intracellular ENaC (Fig. 5, A and B, top panels). As a second strategy, we mutated the four Nedd4-2 WW domains (WW domains 2–4 mediate binding to ENaC). The mutant Nedd4-2 failed to decrease ENaC surface expression (Fig. 5C). The ubiquitin ligase activity of Nedd4-2 was also required; mutation of the HECT domain (C821A) prevented Nedd4-2 from decreasing ENaC surface expression (Fig. 5D). Nedd4-2 Induces Degradation of the Cell Surface Pool of ENaC—To further test the hypothesis that Nedd4-2 selectively regulates ENaC at the cell surface, we asked whether Nedd4-2 induces degradation of channels that have reached the cell surface. We selectively measured the rate of degradation of the cell surface pool of ENaC. This pool was labeled by biotinylation (at 4 °C to prevent trafficking), and then cells were warmed to 37 °C for 0–120 min to allow endocytosis and degradation of biotinylated ENaC. In the absence of Nedd4-2, there was a time-dependent loss of biotinylated βENaC (Fig. 6, A and B); the half-life of degradation was approximately 1 h. Nedd4-2 dramatically increased the rate of degradation of cell surface ENaC, shortening the half-life to <20 min (Fig. 6, A and B). Mutation of the PY motifs in α-, β-, and γENaC abolished the effect of Nedd4-2 (Fig. 6, A and C). Thus, once ENaC reaches the cell surface, Nedd4-2 induces its degradation. This negative regulation is disrupted in Liddle syndrome. ENaC Monoubiquitination Is Sufficient for Nedd4-2-induced Degradation—The data in Fig. 2 suggest that Nedd4-2 catalyzes both monoubiquitination and polyubiquitination of α-, β-, and γENaC. To assess the relative functional importance of these two species, we used a mutant ubiquitin; mutation of each lysine (Ub-0K) prevents the formation of polyubiquitin chains (21Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 2005; 123: 1107-1120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 22Hampe C. Ardila-Osorio H. Fournier M. Brice A. Corti O. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 2059-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Expression of Ub-0K increased levels of βENaC at the cell surface (Fig. 7A, compare lanes 1 and 5). This suggests that ENaC surface expression is in part controlled by polyubiquitination. However, Ub-0K did not prevent Nedd4-2 from decreasing ENaC surface expression; the Nedd4-2 dose-response relationship was identical in the presence or absence of Ub-0K (when each group was normalized to surface expression in the absence of Nedd4-2) (Fig. 7, A and B). In Fischer rat thyroid epithelia transfected with α-, β-, and γENaC, Ub-0K did not prevent Nedd4-2 from decreasing ENaC current (Fig. 7C). Together, the data suggest that monoubiquitination is sufficient for Nedd4-2 to regulate ENaC. From previous work, it is clear that Nedd4-2 plays a key role in regulating epithelial Na+ transport. By decreasing the expression of ENaC at the cell surface, Nedd4-2 reduces renal Na+ absorption, which is critical in the maintenance of Na+ homeostasis. Defects in this regulation cause Liddle syndrome and may contribute to more common forms of hypertension. Does Nedd4-2 regulate ENaC surface expression by ubiquitinating one or more ENaC subunit(s)? Nedd4-2 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. Moreover, its catalytic HECT domain is required for ENaC regulation. Thus, it seems likely that Nedd4-2 regulates ENaC by catalyzing ubiquitination of one or more substrates. These substrates could be either ENaC subunit(s) themselves or a trans-acting protein that modulates ENaC surface expression. In support of the first possibility, we found that Nedd4-2 catalyzes ubiquitination of α-, β-, and γENaC. We cannot exclude the possibility that ubiquitination of a trans-acting protein by Nedd4-2 also contributes to regulation of ENaC surface expression. For example, we previously found that Nedd4-2 ubiquitinates and induces degradation of serum- and glucocorticoid-induced kinase (SGK), a Ser/Thr kinase that stimulates ENaC (18Zhou R. Snyder P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4518-4523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In this regard, it is also intriguing that a yeast homologue of Nedd4-2 (Rsp5) induces endocytosis of Ste2p by catalyzing ubiquitination of a component of the endocytosis machinery (23Dunn R. Hicke L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25974-25981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Does Nedd4-2 catalyze monoubiquitination or polyubiquitination of ENaC? Our data suggest that Nedd4-2 does both. Nedd4-2 increased the quantity of faster migrating ubiquitinated forms of α-, β-, and γENaC. Based on the relative molecular mass, this form is consistent with subunits containing one or a small number of ubiquitins (mono- or oligoubiquitinated). Nedd4-2 also increased a high molecular mass smear, consistent with polyubiquitin chains. However, because the N terminus of each ENaC subunit contains multiple lysines, attachment of a single ubiquitin to multiple residues (polymonoubiquitination) could also contribute to the higher molecular mass forms. In addition to ENaC ubiquitination induced by overexpression of Nedd4-2, we also observed ubiquitinated α-, β-, and γENaC in cells not transfected with Nedd4-2. This is consistent with previous work from other laboratories (although there was disagreement about whether βENaC was a substrate for ubiquitination) (13Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T.

Our data suggest that endogenous Nedd4-2 contributes to this basal level of ubiquitination; silencing of Nedd4-2 reduced ENaC ubiquitination. Importantly, ENaC regulation by Nedd4-2 was intact under conditions that prevented polyubiquitination (Ub-0K). Thus, although Nedd4-2 catalyzes both monoubiquitination and polyubiquitination of ENaC, monoubiquitination is sufficient for Nedd4-2 to induce ENaC degradation (conversely, polyubiquitination is not necessary). E3 ligases function at a variety of cellular locations. For example, gp78 and CHIP participate in quality control in the biosynthetic pathway, targeting misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum for degradation in the proteasome (24Fang S. Ferrone M. Yang C. Jensen J.P. Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14422-14427Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 25Jiang J. Ballinger C.A. Wu Y. Dai Q. Cyr D.M. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42938-42944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Other E3 ligases (e.g. Rsp5, Mdm2) target membrane proteins for endocytosis and degradation (23Dunn R. Hicke L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25974-25981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 26Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Previous work localized Nedd4-2 both in the cytoplasm and at the cell surface (27Itani O.A. Stokes J.B. Thomas C.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: F334-F346Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Moreover, the C2 domain (required for Ca2+-induced localization to the cell surface (27Itani O.A. Stokes J.B. Thomas C.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: F334-F346Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar)) is not required for Nedd4-2 or the related E3 ligase Nedd4 to reduce ENaC surface expression (11Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. Thomas B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 19Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. McDonald F.J. Bucher D.B. J. Biol.

These observations raised the possibility that Nedd4-2 and ENaC interact at an intracellular location (27Itani O.A. Stokes J.B. Thomas C.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: F334-F346Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Our current data suggest an alternative model in which Nedd4-2 binds to ENaC and catalyzes its ubiquitination at the cell surface. First, we found that Nedd4-2 bound to ENaC at the cell surface. Second, Nedd4-2 catalyzed ubiquitination of cell surface ENaC. Third, Nedd4-2 decreased ENaC expression at the cell surface but had no effect on intracellular ENaC, which principally reflects immature channels in the biosynthetic pathway. Finally, following ENaC trafficking to the cell surface, Nedd4-2 induced its degradation. However, we cannot exclude an additional role for Nedd4-2 at a cytoplasmic location, in either the biosynthetic or the endosomal sorting pathways. Moreover, it seems likely that additional E3 ligases might also regulate ENaC in these locations. Consistent with this notion, silencing of Nedd4-2 did not abolish ENaC ubiquitination. Moreover, disruption of polyubiquitination (Ub-0K) increased ENaC surface expression despite is lack of effect on ENaC regulation by Nedd4-2. One caveat is that our studies were carried out in heterologous cell systems; additional work will be required to determine whether the same mechanisms are operative in native epithelia. We found that Liddle syndrome mutations disrupted Nedd4-2-mediated ubiquitination of ENaC. Because these mutations delete or alter PY motifs that mediate ENaC binding to Nedd4-2, this suggests that binding facilitates ubiquitination. Moreover, it provides a mechanistic link between the disease-causing mutations and the excessive Na+ reabsorption that leads to hypertension in patients with Liddle syndrome. By disrupting ubiquitination, Liddle syndrome mutations increase ENaC surface expression, causing excessive renal Na+ absorption. Nedd4-2 is regulated by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway. Moreover, defects in this pathway are responsible for nearly all of the known inherited forms of hypertension. Thus, understanding the mechanisms that mediate ENaC ubiquitination may help unravel the pathogenesis of more common forms of hypertension.

https://openalex.org/W2002232188,"Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), the principal cause of urinary tract infection in women, colonizes the gut as well as the genitourinary tract. Studies of mice inoculated with UTI89, a sequenced isolate, have revealed a complex life cycle that includes formation of intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) in bladder urothelial cells. To understand how UPEC adapts to life in IBCs, we have used GeneChips and/or quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR to study UTI89 recovered from the distal gut of gnotobiotic mice and from IBCs harvested by laser capture microdissection from the bladder urothelium of infected C3H/HeJ female mice. Host responses were characterized in laser capture microdissected urothelial cells that do or do not contain IBCs. The results reveal components of ferric iron acquisition systems in UTI89 that are expressed at significantly higher levels in IBCs compared with the intestine, including the hemin receptor chuA (1,390 ± 188-fold). Localized urothelial responses to IBCs help oppose bacterial salvage of host cell iron (e.g. up-regulation of Tfrc (transferrin receptor) and Lcn2 (lipocalin 2)), facilitate glucose import (e.g. Hk2 (hexokinase 2)), and maintain epithelial structural integrity (e.g. Ivl (involucrin) and Sbsn (suprabasin)). ΔchuA mutants produce significantly smaller IBCs compared with wild type UTI89. This difference was not observed in strains lacking sitA (ABC-type iron/manganese transporter subunit), iroN (salmochelin receptor), hlyA (α-hemolysin), or entF (enterobactin synthetase subunit). Together, these studies indicate that heme- and siderophore-associated iron play key roles in IBC development and provide a series of microbial and host biomarkers for comparing UPEC strains isolated from humans.

In the United States, more than one third of females require antibiotic therapy for this illness by the time they are 24 years old (1Foxman B. Dis. Mon. 2003; 49: 53-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Over 80% of community-acquired UTIs are caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) (2Hooton T.M. Stamm W.E. Infect. Dis. Clin. North Am. 1997; 11: 551-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). A member of the Proteobacteria division of bacteria, UPEC may evolve within, and adapt to, a number of host habitats. It exists as a member of the human colonic microbiota, a community dominated by two other bacterial divisions, the Firmicutes and the Bacteroidetes, where the density of colonization can exceed 1012 organisms/ml of luminal contents (3Eckburg P.B. Bik E.M. Bernstein C.N. Purdom E. Dethlefsen L. Sargent M. Gill S.R. Nelson K.E. Relman D.A. Science. 2005; 308: 1635-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (5278) Google Scholar, 4Ley R.E. Peterson D.A. Gordon J.I. Cell. 2006; 124: 837-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2190) Google Scholar). UPEC can emerge from the colon and become incorporated into the vaginal and periurethral microbiota before entering the urethra and bladder (reviewed in Ref. 5Hooton T.M. Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents. 2001; 17: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Once in the bladder, UPEC attaches to the surface of umbrella cells that form the superficial (lumen-facing) layer of the urothelium; attachment is followed by rapid invasion (6Mulvey M.A. Lopez-Boado Y.S. Wilson C.L. Roth R. Parks W.C. Heuser J. Hultgren S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1494-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Attachment and invasion trigger innate immune responses that lead to exfoliation of superficial umbrella cells, thereby ridding the host of bacteria-laden epithelium (6Mulvey M.A. Lopez-Boado Y.S. Wilson C.L. Roth R. Parks W.C. Heuser J. Hultgren S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1494-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). UPEC can form intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) in residual umbrella cells. Umbrella cells typically host a single IBC that expands to contain a population that can exceed 105 UPEC. 4S. J. Hultgren, unpublished data. 4S. J. Hultgren, unpublished data. The IBC eventually deconstructs, releasing UPEC into the bladder lumen where they can attach to and invade other urothelial cells (7Justice S.S. Hung C. Theriot J.A. Fletcher D.A. Anderson G.G. Footer M.J. Hultgren S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1333-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). If untreated, quiescent intraepithelial reservoirs of UPEC are established that can lead to recurrent infections (8Mysorekar I.U. Hultgren S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 14170-14175Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Because UPEC must adapt to life in two distinct host habitats (colon and urothelial cell) where there may be intense competition for nutrients, identifying nutrient acquisition strategies that are important for bacterial survival during or following IBC formation may lead to new approaches for the prevention, diagnosis, and/or treatment of acute and recurrent UTI. In the current study, we have examined this issue using the following approach. Gene expression was compared in a recently sequenced cystitis isolate (UTI89) (9Chen S.L. Hung C.S. Xu J. Reigstad C.S. Magrini V. Sabo A. Blasiar D. Bieri T. Meyer R.R. Ozersky P. Armstrong J.R. Fulton R.S. Latreille J.P. Spieth J. Hooton T.M. Mardis E.R. Hultgren S.J. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5977-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) during its growth in vitro under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, in the distal intestines of gnotobiotic mice, and in IBCs harvested from urothelial cells using laser capture microdissection (LCM). Host responses to IBC formation in laser-captured urothelial cells were then defined using (i) GeneChips and real-time quantitative RT-PCR, (ii) microanalytic biochemical assays of cellular metabolism, and (iii) multilabel immunohistochemistry. The importance of one prominent aspect of the nutrient acquisition strategy used by this organism that emerged from our analysis was tested through genetic manipulations; comparison of wild type (WT) UTI89 and isogenic mutants strains containing null alleles of five genes that are markedly up-regulated in IBCs compared with the distal intestine established that the ability to acquire ferric iron plays a key role in formation of IBCs. Bacterial Strains—Two strains of E. coli, MG1655 and UTI89, plus five isogenic deletion mutant strains of UTI89 with null alleles of chuA, entF, iroN, hlyA, or sitA were used in this study. The mutants were constructed according to the method of Datsenko and Wanner (10Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10838) Google Scholar) using primers described in supplemental Table S1, and pKD4 (10Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10838) Google Scholar). Amplicons were electroporated into UTI89 harboring pKM208 (11Murphy K.C. Campellone K.G. BMC Mol. Biol. 2003; 4: 11Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) to remove genes of interest and replace them with the Flp recombinase target-flanked kanamycin-resistance cassette from pKD4. Recombination was confirmed by selection on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates supplemented with 25 μg/ml kanamycin and by bacterial colony PCR (see supplemental Table S1 for primers). The Flp recombinase target-flanked cassette was then removed using the ara-inducible Flp recombinase expression plasmid pCP20 (10Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10838) Google Scholar). Growth of E. coli UTI89 and MG1655 in Batch Fermentors—E. coli strains UTI89 or MG1655 were grown separately in the two 1.3-liter vessels of a BioFlo 110 batch fermentor (New Brunswick Scientific) to generate biological duplicate samples. For each strain, anaerobic growth was initiated by inoculating 5 ml of an anaerobic overnight culture into 500 ml of LB medium. Bacteria were then incubated at 37 °C with agitation (100 rpm) and continuous sparging (mixture of 80% N2 and 20% CO2 at 0.2 liters/min). Aerobic cultures were also started with a 5-ml aerobic inoculum and incubated in LB at 37 °C at 100 rpm but were sparged with sterile house air at 0.2 liters/min. Aliquots (4 ml) were removed from each vessel at specified time points (see supplemental Fig. S1A) and placed into two volumes of RNAprotect (Qiagen). Bacterial RNA was isolated using the RNeasy midi kit (Qiagen), and contaminating genomic DNA was removed by treatment with RNase-free DNase I (Qiagen) and DNAfree (Ambion). Experiments Involving Specified Pathogen-free, Conventionally Raised, and Germ-free Mice—All manipulations involving mice were performed using protocols approved by the Washington University Animal Studies Committee. C57Bl6/J and C3H/HeJ mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. C3H/HeN mice were obtained from Harlan Sprague-Dawley. Conventionally raised C3H/HeJ and C3H/HeN mice were maintained under a strict 12-h light cycle (lights on at 0600 h) in microisolator cages, in a barrier facility, in a specified pathogen-free state and fed a standard chow diet (Pico Rodent Chow 20; Purina) ad libitum. Germ-free C57Bl/6J mice were maintained in gnotobiotic isolators (12Hooper L.V. Midtvedt T. Gordon J.I. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2002; 22: 283-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar) under a strict 12-h light cycle (lights on at 0600 h) and given a standard autoclaved chow diet (B&K Universal) ad libitum. Eight- to 10-week-old germ-free female animals were colonized with a single gavage of UTI89 or MG1655 (108 colony-forming units (CFU) in 100 μl of LB medium/animal). Animals were euthanized 14 days after inoculation, between 1400 and 1600 h. The proximal 90% of the cecum was separated from the rest of the intestine, and bacteria were recovered by extruding cecal contents and by gentle scraping of the mucosa. Recovered cecal contents from each animal were placed immediately into 3 volumes of RNAprotect (Qiagen), and RNA was isolated (RNeasy midi kit; Qiagen). The distal portions of the ceca of UTI89-colonized mice were fixed for 1 h at room temperature in 1% osmium tetroxide (prepared in 0.1 m PBS), followed by 1% uranyl acetate (in water) for 1 h. Samples were dehydrated in graded ethanol baths followed by immersion in 100% EtOH (3 cycles of 10 min each) and propylene oxide (3 cycles of 10 min). Tissues were then infiltrated overnight in propylene oxide:EMBed 812 (3:1 mixture; Electron Microscopy Sciences), followed by additional washes in 2:1, 1:1, and 1:3 mixtures, and finally in 100% EMBed 812. Sections (75-nm-thick) were prepared and viewed with a JEOL 100C transmission electron microscope. Transcriptional Profiling of UTI89 and MG1655 in Vitro and in Vivo—Biotinylated cDNA targets were prepared from bacterial RNA samples and hybridized to GeneChip E. coli Antisense Genome Arrays (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

After masking, overall fluorescence across all remaining probes was scaled to a target intensity of 500 (MAS 5.0), and a flat-file data base containing expression data from each GeneChip was imported into DNA-CHIP ANALYZER v1.3 (dChip) (16Li C. Wong W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (2691) Google Scholar) for normalization, filtering, and sample comparisons. GeneChip Analysis of Urothelial Responses to IBC Formation—Cultures of WT or mutant UTI89 strains were grown statically in LB for 48 h at 37 °C, recovered by centrifugation, washed once, and adjusted to 2×109 CFU/ml with sterile PBS. Female 8- to 10-week-old conventionally raised C3H/HeJ mice were inoculated by transurethral catheterization with 50 μl of this bacterial suspension (6Mulvey M.A. Lopez-Boado Y.S. Wilson C.L. Roth R. Parks W.C. Heuser J. Hultgren S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1494-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Animals were euthanized 24 h later and their bladders were immediately embedded in optimal cutting temperature (O.C.T.) compound (Sakura Finetek) and frozen in Cytocool II (Richard-Allen Scientific). 7-μm-thick cryosections were cut, placed on Superfrost/Plus slides (Fisher Scientific), and stained with eosin Y in preparation for LCM (17Stappenbeck T.S. Hooper L.V. Manchester J.K. Wong M.H. Gordon J.I. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 356: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Four distinct populations of urothelial cells were harvested using a PixCell IIe system (laser spot diameter, 7.5 μm) and CapSure HS LCM caps (Arcturus): (i) from uninfected animals; (ii) from mock-infected mice (24 h after “inoculation” with sterile PBS), (iii) IBC-distal urothelium from infected hosts (n = 5 animals/pool) (located >10 cell diameters from any IBCs in the section plane), and (iv) IBC-proximal (<10 cell diameters from any IBCs in the section plane). RNA was isolated from populations (i) to (iv) using the PicoPure kit (Arcturus) with on-column DNase-I treatment (Qiagen). RNA integrity was evaluated using RNA 6000 Pico LabChips with a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Biological duplicate 1-ng aliquots of pooled intact RNA from each of the four populations of laser-captured urothelial cells were each amplified and labeled with the RiboAmp HS RNA Amplification kit (Arcturus) and the BioArray High Yield RNA Transcript Labeling kit (ENZO Biochem). The eight resulting biotinylated cRNA targets were each used to probe MOE430A mouse GeneChips (Affymetrix). Following hybridization, overall fluorescence across each GeneChip was scaled to a target intensity of 1500 and analyzed using MAS 5.0 (Affymetrix) and dChip (16Li C. Wong W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (2691) Google Scholar). Real-time Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR—RNA was isolated from LCM IBCs using a protocol developed by the manufacturer of the RNA amplification kit (Arcturus) with on-column DNase I (Qiagen). qRT-PCR assays of RNAs isolated from UTI89 IBCs or LCM urothelial cells were performed in 25-μl reactions containing random hexamer-primed cDNA (synthesized from DNase-treated RNA samples), 1× SYBR Green Master Mix buffer (Applied Biosystems), 900 nm gene-specific primers (supplemental Table S3), and 0.25 units of uracil DNA glycosylase (Invitrogen). A melting curve was performed for each primer pair to identify a temperature where only amplicon, and not primer dimers, accounted for SYBR Green-bound fluorescence. Assays were performed in triplicate using an Mx3000P qPCR apparatus (Stratagene). Bacterial qRT-PCR assays were normalized to 16 S rRNA and urothelial qRT-PCR assays to 18 S rRNA using the ΔΔCT analysis method (18Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (116613) Google Scholar). Comparing IBC Sizes Obtained with WT UTI89 versus Isogenic ΔchuA, ΔentF, ΔhlyA, ΔiroN, and ΔsitA Mutants—A single, freshly picked bacterial colony (from LB-agar plates) was introduced into LB medium, and the culture was grown to an A600 of 0.4 units/ml. Each culture was then diluted 1:100 in 25 ml of fresh LB and grown statically for 16 h. Bacteria were recovered by centrifugation and adjusted to ∼2 × 108 CFU/ml of PBS. Groups of five C3H/HeN mice were inoculated (transurethrally) with 107 CFU of either WT, ΔchuA, ΔentF, ΔhlyA, ΔiroN, or ΔsitA UTI89. Six hours after inoculation, animals were killed, and bladders were removed, embedded in O.C.T. compound, frozen in blocks, and sectioned. Every tenth 4-μm section was stained with either 1% aqueous toluidine blue (Carolina Biological) or hematoxylin and eosin and viewed under a Zeiss Axiovert 200M inverted microscope. 100-400 bladder sections were examined for each of the bacterial strains assayed. Cross-sectional areas of all IBCs were calculated using AxioVision software (Zeiss). IBC sizes obtained from each isogenic mutant were compared with those obtained from WT UTI89 by using a two-tailed, heteroscedastic Student’s t test. Average IBC cross-sectional area for each strain is plotted with S.E. (n = the number of IBC cross-sectional areas measured for a given strain). Multilabel Immunohistochemistry—Cryosections (7-μm-thick) prepared from bladders embedded in O.C.T. compound were post-fixed in methanol for 5 min at -20 °C and rinsed in deionized water (5 min), followed by incubation in PBS (three cycles, 5 min each at 25 °C) and blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin/0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, 1 h at 25 °C). One of the following primary antibodies was then added (overnight at 4 °C): (i) goat anti-E. coli (diluted 1:500 in blocking buffer; United States Biological, Inc.), (ii) rabbit anti-mouse involucrin (1:200; Covance), or (iii) fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rat monoclonal antibody to mouse transferrin receptor (1:200; U.S. Biological). Following three washes in PBS, antigen-antibody complexes were visualized directly (in the case of the fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled monoclonal antibody) or with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies to rabbit or goat Ig (1:500; Molecular Probes). Nuclei were stained with bis-benzimide (Hoechst 33258). Sections were examined and photographed using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M inverted microscope. Hexokinase Assays—C3H/HeJ mouse bladders were inoculated with UTI89 as described above or mock-infected with sterile PBS (n = 3 animals/group). Animals were killed 24 h later. Bladders were immediately embedded in a 10:1 mixture of O.C.T. compound and gum tragacanth (Sigma-Aldrich) and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cryosections (7-μm-thick) were prepared from each bladder, placed on Superfrost Plus microscope slides, and freeze-dried (17Stappenbeck T.S. Hooper L.V. Manchester J.K. Wong M.H. Gordon J.I. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 356: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were generated from bladder epithelial and mucosal cells harvested from freeze-dried sections (250-500 ng of protein as determined by Quantigold; Diversified Biotech) by adding 1 μl of a solution containing 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 25% glycerol plus 0.5% Triton and incubating the mixture for 1 h at 20 °C. Hexokinase activity was then assayed using the “oil well” method (19Passonneau J.V. Lowry O.H. Enzymatic Analysis: a Practical Guide. 1993; (, The Humana Press, Totowa, NJ)Crossref Google Scholar). Specifically, 0.2 μl of the lysate (50-100 ng of protein) was added to 1 μl of enzyme reagent containing 100 mm Trizma HCl, pH 8.1, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm glucose, 5 mm ATP, 0.1 mm NADP+, 0.02% bovine serum albumin, and 0.3 units/ml Leuconostoc mesenteroides glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (specific activity, 250 units/mg protein; Calbiochem). The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 20 °C, and the reaction was terminated by adding 1 μl of 0.15 m NaOH (80 °C, 20 min). A 1-μl aliquot was then transferred to 100 μl of NADP cycling reagent and subjected to 2000 cycles of amplification (19Passonneau J.V. Lowry O.H. Enzymatic Analysis: a Practical Guide. 1993; (, The Humana Press, Totowa, NJ)Crossref Google Scholar). Glucose 6-phosphate standards (20-40 μm) were included throughout all steps. Comparison of UPEC Transcription during Growth in Vitro under Aerobic versus Anaerobic Conditions and in the Distal Intestines of Gnotobiotic Mice—We recently determined the complete DNA sequence of UTI89 (9Chen S.L. Hung C.S. Xu J. Reigstad C.S. Magrini V. Sabo A. Blasiar D. Bieri T. Meyer R.R. Ozersky P. Armstrong J.R. Fulton R.S. Latreille J.P. Spieth J. Hooton T.M. Mardis E.R. Hultgren S.J. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5977-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar): its 5,065,741-bp genome contains 5,066 predicted protein-coding genes, 3,481 of which are shared with MG1655, the prototypic laboratory strain of E. coli originally isolated from human feces whose metabolic networks and signaling pathways have been extensively characterized (ecocyc.org) (20Keseler I.M. Collado-Vides J. Gama-Castro S. Ingraham J. Paley S. Paulsen I.T. Peralta-Gil M. Karp P.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33 (-D337): D334Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). We identified 32,216 oligonucleotide probes on the MG1655-based Affymetrix E. coli Antisense Genome Array whose sequences perfectly matched those in 3,481 UTI89 genes. Using these GeneChips, we performed genome-wide transcriptional profiling of both strains during aerobic and anaerobic growth, from early log to stationary phase, in batch fermentors containing LB medium (n = 2 independent experiments/strain; see supplemental Fig. S1A for time points sampled). Following hybridization, all signals from oligonucleotide probes that did not perfectly match sequences in both genomes were masked electronically. 5To access the source code used to generate this mask, contact J. Gordon. The resulting data sets were highly congruent for both strains: differences in the responses of UTI89 and MG1655 to aerobic versus anaerobic environments were comparable at similar points in their growth curves (see supplemental Fig. S1B for an example of hierarchical clustering of the data sets using dChip). We then used these GeneChips to profile the transcriptome of UTI89 in the gut as prelude to comparing expression of selected genes in IBCs versus the distal intestine. To do so, we colonized germ-free adult female C57Bl/6J mice with a single gavage of 108 CFU of UTI89 or the reference control MG1655 strain (see “Experimental Procedures”). Animals (n = 5/group) were maintained on an autoclaved, standard polysaccharide-rich chow diet where glucose, arabinose, xylose, and galactose are the principal neutral sugars (mole ratio 10:8:5:1) (21Sonnenburg J.L. Xu J. Leip D.D. Chen C.H. Westover B.P. Weatherford J. Buhler J.D. Gordon J.I. Science. 2005; 307: 1955-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). All animals were killed 14 days after inoculation with bacteria, a period that encompasses several cycles of turnover of the underlying, perpetually renewing intestinal epithelium. Both strains efficiently colonized all mice. Both strains reached peak densities in the cecum (supplemental Fig. S2A). This sac-like structure separates the distal small intestine from the proximal colon and is normally home to a diverse population of bacteria in conventionally raised mice, including members of Proteobacteria (22Ley R.E. Baöckhed F. Turnbaugh P. Lozupone C.A. Knight R.D. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 11070-11075Crossref PubMed Scopus (4137) Google Scholar). Transmission electron microscopy of ceca obtained from mice colonized with UTI89 alone revealed a mixture of coccoid and rod-shaped bacteria in the lumen and associated with mucus (supplemental Fig. S2B), a known source of nutrients (glycans) for E. coli as well as other members of the microbiota (23Chang D.E. Smalley D.J. Tucker D.L. Leatham M.P. Norris W.E. Stevenson S.J. Anderson A.B. Grissom J.E. Laux D.C. Cohen P.S. Conway T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7427-7432Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). IBCs were not observed in the intestinal epithelium of any of these gnotobiotic mice. GeneChip profiling of RNA prepared from the cecal contents of each mouse identified a total of 162 transcripts that were differentially expressed by UTI89 compared with MG1655 (see “Experimental Procedures” for selection criteria, supplemental Figs. S3 and S4 for gene lists, plus supplemental Fig. S5, A and B, for clusters of orthologous genes (COG)-based functional classification of these genes). qRT-PCR was used to verify the augmented cecal expression of a selected subset of the 67 genes defined as having higher expression in UTI89: they include genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, stress responses, and various aspects of iron metabolism (supplemental Fig. S5C). The latter group contained feoA, which participates in ferrous iron transport (24Kammler M. Schon C. Hantke K. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6212-6219Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), plus tonB and exbB, which encode components of the TonB energy transduction complex that couples transport of iron-siderophore complexes across the outer membrane with the proton motive force across the cytoplasmic membrane. Recovery of IBCs by Laser Capture Microdissection—We next determined how UTI89 gene expression in IBCs compared with that in its cecal habitat. C3H/HeJ mice, deficient in Toll-like receptor 4 signaling, were chosen for this analysis for several reasons: (i) they have been used extensively to characterize the temporal and cellular features of the UTI89 IBC life cycle (7Justice S.S. Hung C. Theriot J.A. Fletcher D.A. Anderson G.G. Footer M.J. Hultgren S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1333-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 25Anderson G.G.

LCM of bladder cryosections was an attractive method because it offered a way of retrieving IBCs directly from their intracellular environment while still preserving their transcriptional profile. Bladders were isolated from mice killed 24 h after transurethral inoculation with 108 CFU of UTI89, frozen immediately in O.C.T. compound, and subjected to cryosectioning. Careful microdissection, using a laser spot diameter of 7.5 μm, allowed us to excise the IBC from its host urothelial cell, as shown in Fig. 1, A-D. Each bladde"
https://openalex.org/W2151784208,"Phenotype of biological systems needs to be robust against mutation in order to sustain themselves between generations. On the other hand, phenotype of an individual also needs to be robust against fluctuations of both internal and external origins that are encountered during growth and development. Is there a relationship between these two types of robustness, one during a single generation and the other during evolution? Could stochasticity in gene expression have any relevance to the evolution of these types of robustness? Robustness can be defined by the sharpness of the distribution of phenotype; the variance of phenotype distribution due to genetic variation gives a measure of ‘genetic robustness’, while that of isogenic individuals gives a measure of ‘developmental robustness’. Through simulations of a simple stochastic gene expression network that undergoes mutation and selection, we show that in order for the network to acquire both types of robustness, the phenotypic variance induced by mutations must be smaller than that observed in an isogenic population. As the latter originates from noise in gene expression, this signifies that the genetic robustness evolves only when the noise strength in gene expression is larger than some threshold. In such a case, the two variances decrease throughout the evolutionary time course, indicating increase in robustness. The results reveal how noise that cells encounter during growth and development shapes networks' robustness to stochasticity in gene expression, which in turn shapes networks' robustness to mutation. The necessary condition for evolution of robustness, as well as the relationship between genetic and developmental robustness, is derived quantitatively through the variance of phenotypic fluctuations, which are directly measurable experimentally."
https://openalex.org/W2004286784,"The persistence of infectious biomolecules in soil constitutes a substantial challenge. This holds particularly true with respect to prions, the causative agents of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) such as scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or chronic wasting disease (CWD). Various studies have indicated that prions are able to persist in soil for years without losing their pathogenic activity. Dissemination of prions into the environment can occur from several sources, e.g., infectious placenta or amniotic fluid of sheep. Furthermore, environmental contamination by saliva, excrements or non-sterilized agricultural organic fertilizer is conceivable. Natural transmission of scrapie in the field seems to occur via the alimentary tract in the majority of cases, and scrapie-free sheep flocks can become infected on pastures where outbreaks of scrapie had been observed before. These findings point to a sustained contagion in the environment, and notably the soil. By using outdoor lysimeters, we simulated a contamination of standard soil with hamster-adapted 263K scrapie prions, and analyzed the presence and biological activity of the soil-associated PrP(Sc) and infectivity by Western blotting and hamster bioassay, respectively. Our results showed that 263K scrapie agent can persist in soil at least over 29 months. Strikingly, not only the contaminated soil itself retained high levels of infectivity, as evidenced by oral administration to Syrian hamsters, but also feeding of aqueous soil extracts was able to induce disease in the reporter animals. We could also demonstrate that PrP(Sc) in soil, extracted after 21 months, provides a catalytically active seed in the protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) reaction. PMCA opens therefore a perspective for considerably improving the detectability of prions in soil samples from the field."
https://openalex.org/W1964016916,"Human activity is causing high rates of biodiversity loss. Yet, surprisingly little is known about the extent to which socioeconomic factors exacerbate or ameliorate our impacts on biological diversity. One such factor, economic inequality, has been shown to affect public health, and has been linked to environmental problems in general. We tested how strongly economic inequality is related to biodiversity loss in particular. We found that among countries, and among US states, the number of species that are threatened or declining increases substantially with the Gini ratio of income inequality. At both levels of analysis, the connection between income inequality and biodiversity loss persists after controlling for biophysical conditions, human population size, and per capita GDP or income. Future research should explore potential mechanisms behind this equality-biodiversity relationship. Our results suggest that economic reforms would go hand in hand with, if not serving as a prerequisite for, effective conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2126544797,"The multifunctional receptor LRP1 controls expression, activity and trafficking of the PDGF receptor-beta in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). LRP1 is also a receptor for TGFbeta1 and is required for TGFbeta mediated inhibition of cell proliferation.We show that loss of LRP1 in VSMC (smLRP(-)) in vivo results in a Marfan-like syndrome with nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated Smad2/3, disruption of elastic layers, tortuous aorta, and increased expression of the TGFbeta target genes thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) and PDGFRbeta in the vascular wall. Treatment of smLRP1(-) animals with the PPARgamma agonist rosiglitazone abolished nuclear pSmad accumulation, reversed the Marfan-like phenotype, and markedly reduced smooth muscle proliferation, fibrosis and atherosclerosis independent of plasma cholesterol levels.Our findings are consistent with an activation of TGFbeta signals in the LRP1-deficient vascular wall. LRP1 may function as an integrator of proliferative and anti-proliferative signals that control physiological mechanisms common to the pathogenesis of Marfan syndrome and atherosclerosis, and this is essential for maintaining vascular wall integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2078892596,"Low molecular weight carbonyl compounds, such as the alpha-ketoaldehydes methylglyoxal (MGO) and glyoxal (GO), are formed under hyperglycemic conditions and behave as advanced glycation end product (AGE) precursors. They form adducts on proteins, thereby inducing cellular dysfunctions involved in chronic complications of diabetes.Nontoxic concentrations of GO or MGO altered the PDGF-induced PDGFRbeta-phosphorylation, ERK1/2-activation, and nuclear translocation, and the subsequent proliferation of mesenchymal cells (smooth muscle cells and skin fibroblasts). This resulted mainly from inhibition of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase of PDGFRbeta and in part from altered PDGF-BB binding to PDGFRbeta. Concomitantly, the formation of AGE adducts (N(epsilon)carboxymethyl-lysine and N(epsilon)carboxyethyl-lysine) was observed on immunoprecipitated PDGFRbeta. Arginine and aminoguanidine, used as carbonyl scavengers, reversed the inhibitory effect and the formation of AGE adducts on PDGFRbeta. AGE-PDGFRbeta adducts were also detected by anti-AGE antibodies in PDGFRbeta immunopurified from aortas of diabetic (streptozotocin-treated) compared to nondiabetic apolipoprotein E-null mice. Mass spectrometry analysis of aortas demonstrated increased AGE formation in diabetic specimens.These data indicate that MGO and GO induce desensitization of PDGFRbeta that helps to reduce mesenchymal cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1966821227,"A critical role for Tie1, an orphan endothelial receptor, in blood vessel morphogenesis has emerged from mutant mouse studies. Moreover, it was recently demonstrated that certain angiopoietin (Ang) family members can activate Tie1. We report here that Ang1 induces Tie1 phosphorylation in endothelial cells. Tie1 phosphorylation was, however, Tie2 dependent because 1) Ang1 failed to induce Tie1 phosphorylation when Tie2 was down-regulated in endothelial cells; 2) Tie1 phosphorylation was induced in the absence of Ang1 by either a constitutively active form of Tie2 or a Tie2 agonistic antibody; 3) in HEK 293 cells Ang1 phosphorylated a form of Tie1 without kinase activity when coexpressed with Tie2, and Ang1 failed to phosphorylate Tie1 when coexpressed with kinase-defective Tie2. Ang1-mediated AKT and 42/44MAPK phosphorylation is predominantly Tie2 mediated, and Tie1 down-regulates this pathway. Finally, based on a battery of in vitro and in vivo data, we show that a main role for Tie1 is to modulate blood vessel morphogenesis by virtue of its ability to down-regulate Tie2-driven signaling and endothelial survival. Our new observations help to explain why Tie1 null embryos have increased capillary densities in several organ systems. The experiments also constitute a paradigm for how endothelial integrity is fine-tuned by the interplay between closely related receptors by a single growth factor."

Cell. 2006; 126: 361-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Quite a lot is known about how ERAD substrates are polyubiquitinated and transferred to the proteasome. Studies in yeast suggest that ER luminal substrates and membrane substrates with aberrant luminal or membrane domains are polyubiquitinated by an ER membrane protein complex containing the ubiquitin ligase (E3) Hrd1p, whereas membrane substrates with aberrant cytosolic domains are targeted by a complex containing the E3 Doa10p (4Carvalho P. Goder V. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2006; 126: 361-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Hrd3p binds to and regulates Hrd1p (5Gardner R.G. Swarbrick G.M. Bays N.W. Cronin S.R. Wilhovsky S. Seelig L. Kim C. Hampton R.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), and together with the ER luminal lectin Yos9p, may use its large luminal domain to recruit ERAD substrates to a putative “retrotranslocation” channel in the ER membrane (6Denic V. Quan E.M. Weissman J.S. Cell. 2006; 126: 349-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 7Gauss R. Jarosch E. Sommer T. Hirsch C. Nat.

Retrotranslocation is facilitated by the cytosolic Cdc48p-Ufd1p-Npl4p complex, which associates with Hrd1p and Doa10p via membrane-bound Ubx2p (4Carvalho P. Goder V. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2006; 126: 361-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 8Gauss R. Sommer T. Jarosch E.

Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 999-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), and likely uses ATP hydrolysis to both unfold ERAD substrates and extract them from the ER membrane (11Elkabetz Y. Shapira I. Rabinovich E. Bar-Nun S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3980-3989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 12Jarosch E. Taxis C. Volkwein C. Bordallo J. Finley D. Wolf D.H.

Biol. 2002; 22: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Polyubiquitination then occurs either simultaneously with or immediately after retrotranslocation (14Shamu C.E. Story C.M. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 15Shamu C.E. Flierman D. Ploegh H.L. Rapoport T.A. Chau V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2546-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Further, the mammalian homologs of many of these proteins have been identified and appear to be organized similarly (4Carvalho P. Goder V. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2006; 126: 361-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The mammalian E3s Hrd1 and gp78 are homologous to yeast Hrd1p, and each polyubiquitinates several ERAD substrates (16Chen B. Mariano J. Tsai Y.C. Chan A.H. Cohen M. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 17Kikkert M. Doolman R. Dai M. Avner R. Hassink G. van Voorden S. Thanedar S. Roitelman J. Chau V. Wiertz E. J. Biol.

Cell. 2005; 19: 829-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The mammalian homolog of Hrd3p, SEL1L, complexes with Hrd1 and may also contribute to ERAD substrate processing (19Lilley B.N. Ploegh H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14296-14301Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 20Mueller B. Lilley B.N. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The mammalian p97-Ufd1-Npl4 complex has properties similar to its yeast counterpart (11Elkabetz Y. Shapira I. Rabinovich E. Bar-Nun S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3980-3989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 21Meyer H.H. Wang Y. Warren G.

Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), and the mammalian homolog of Ubx2p helps anchor it to the ER membrane (23Liang J. Yin C. Doong H. Fang S. Peterhoff C. Nixon R.A. Monteiro M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4011-4024Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Finally, Derlin-1, -2, and -3, homologs of yeast Der1p, have been suggested to form the retrotranslocation channel in the ER membrane (19Lilley B.N. Ploegh H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14296-14301Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 24Oda Y. Okada T. Yoshida H. Kaufman R.J. Nagata K. Mori K. J.

A. 2005; 102: 14132-14138Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In contrast, how proteins are initially recognized for ERAD is poorly understood, and emerging evidence points to the existence of multiple recognition factors and mechanisms rather than a single unified scheme (26Ahner A. Brodsky J.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 474-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). For example, in yeast, Yos9p, together with Kar2p and Hrd3p, selectively binds to and targets a range of terminally misfolded luminal glycoproteins to the Hrd1p complex (4Carvalho P. Goder V. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2006; 126: 361-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 6Denic V. Quan E.M. Weissman J.S. Cell. 2006; 126: 349-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 7Gauss R. Jarosch E. Sommer T. Hirsch C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Likewise, the mammalian homologs of Kar2p (11Elkabetz Y. Shapira I. Rabinovich E. Bar-Nun S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3980-3989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and Hrd3p (20Mueller B. Lilley B.N. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), as well as the mammalian EDEM proteins (27Ruddock L.W. Molinari M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4373-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), appear to interact directly with glycoproteins destined for ERAD. Alternatively, substrate recognition can be mediated by factors that select specific or highly restricted groups of proteins for degradation. For example, the mammalian INSIGs bind directly to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR), and this interaction recruits factors, including the E3 gp78, that are required for the cholesterol-induced ERAD of HMGR (18Song B.L. Sever N. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 829-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 28Sever N. Song B.L. Yabe D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. DeBose-Boyd R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52479-52490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Given the diversity of proteins that are targeted for ERAD, it is likely that additional substrate recognition factors will emerge. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors (IP3Rs) form tetrameric, IP3- and Ca2+-gated Ca2+ channels in ER membranes and play a key role in cell signaling (29Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4392) Google Scholar, 30Bezprozvanny I. Cell Calcium. 2005; 38: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Stimulation of certain cell surface receptors triggers IP3 formation at the plasma membrane, which then diffuses through the cytosol and binds to IP3Rs (29Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4392) Google Scholar). This, in concert with Ca2+ binding, induces conformational changes in the tetrameric channel that permit Ca2+ to flow from stores within the ER lumen into the cytosol (31Bosanac I. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Ikura M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1742: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 32Taylor C.W. da Fonseca P.C.A. Morris E.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 210-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). There are three IP3R types in mammals, IP3R1, IP3R2, and IP3R3, and although they differ considerably in their tissue distribution, they have similar properties, are often co-expressed, and can form homo- or heterotetramers (30Bezprozvanny I. Cell Calcium. 2005; 38: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 33Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Remarkably, activation of endogenous IP3Rs leads to their rapid polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26 S proteasome (34Bokkala S. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12454-12461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 35Oberdorf J. Webster J.M. Zhu C.C. Luo S.G. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Biochem.

Sci. 2004; 25: 35-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), a phenomenon that has been demonstrated in many mammalian cell types, including cholecystokinin-stimulated pancreatic acinar cells (37Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Ernst S.A. Yule D.I. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 1194-1201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-stimulated αT3-1 mouse pituitary gonadotropes (38Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Xu Q. Webster J.M. Alzayady K. Gao C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 940-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and endothelin 1 (ET1)-stimulated Rat-1 primary fibroblasts (39Alzayady K.J. Panning M.M. Kelley G.G. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34530-34537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The ERAD pathway seems to be responsible for this process, because the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that ubiquitinates IP3Rs is mamUbc7 (3Webster J.M. Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38238-38246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), an enzyme widely implicated in ERAD (2Hampton R.Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 40Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16193-16200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and the p97-Ufd1-Npl4 complex mediates the degradation of polyubiquitinated IP3Rs (39Alzayady K.J. Panning M.M. Kelley G.G. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34530-34537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Importantly, endogenous IP3Rs represent a unique tool for studying ERAD, because activation almost instantaneously converts them from their native form into ERAD substrates (36Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Trends Pharm. Sci. 2004; 25: 35-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 39Alzayady K.J. Panning M.M. Kelley G.G. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34530-34537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This contrasts with the substrates typically used to study ERAD in mammalian cells, for example, the T-cell receptor subunits TCRα and CD3δ, which are constitutively degraded and usually overexpressed by transfection (40Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16193-16200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Here, we studied endogenous IP3Rs in stimulated mammalian cells in an effort to identify novel proteins that might be involved in the ERAD of IP3Rs and perhaps other substrates. We discovered that an uncharacterized protein, known as SPFH domain-containing protein, member 2 (SPFH2), associates very rapidly with activated IP3Rs in a variety of cell types, that a proportion of cellular SPFH2 is associated with several established ERAD pathway components, and that RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated depletion of SPFH2 inhibits IP3R1 polyubiquitination and degradation and the turnover of model ERAD substrates. SPFH2 shares homology with a diverse family of proteins that contain an SPFH domain, an ∼200 amino acid motif of unknown function, named for the original family members: Stomatin, Prohibitin, Flotillin, and HflC/HflK (41Morrow I.C. Parton R.G. Traffic. 2005; 6: 725-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 42Rivera-Milla E. Stuermer C.A.O. Málaga-Trillo E. Cell. Mol.

Sci. 1999; 24: 425-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Overall, these studies identify SPFH2 as a key ERAD pathway component in mammalian cells and suggest that it may act as a substrate recognition factor. Materials—αT3-1 and Rat-1 cells were routinely cultured as described (39Alzayady K.J. Panning M.M. Kelley G.G. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34530-34537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Already-available antibodies used were: rabbit polyclonal anti-IP3R1, anti-IP3R2, and anti-IP3R3 (33Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), anti-α-transaldolase (a kind gift from Dr. Andras Perl, State University of New York Upstate Medical University), anti-Derlin-1 and anti-Sec61β (kind gifts from Dr. T. Rapoport, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), rat monoclonal anti-grp94 (StressGen), mouse monoclonal anti-mono and -polyubiquitinated conjugates, clone FK2 (Bio-Mol International), anti-β-actin (Sigma), anti-p97 (Research Diagnostics, Inc.), anti-Ufd1, anti-Ufd2, anti-hsp90, anti-IP3R3, and anti-IκBα (BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-hemagglutinin (HA) epitope, clone HA11 (Covance), and horseradish peroxidase- and fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma). Rabbit polyclonal anti-gp78, anti-Hrd1, and anti-SPFH2 were generated against peptides corresponding to the C terminus of each protein (DPVTLRRRMLAAAAERRLQ, RLQKLESPVAH, and DKLGFGLEDEPLETATKDN, respectively) and were affinity-purified as described (33Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). SDS, Triton X-100, protease inhibitors, N-ethylmaleimide, GnRH, cholecystokinin, digitonin, Polybrene (hexamethrine bromide), puromycin, cycloheximide, and TNFα were purchased from Sigma; ET1 was from Calbiochem; T4 DNA ligase, calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, all restriction enzymes, and endoglycosidase H (Endo H) were from New England Biolabs; Precision Plus™ Protein Standards, DTT, and bisacrylamide were from Bio-Rad; G418 was from Cellgro; doxycycline was from Clontech; Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B was from Amersham Biosciences; Lipofectamine 2000 was from Invitrogen; and bortezomib (PS-341) was a gift from Millennium Pharmaceuticals. Cell Lysis and Immunoprecipitation—For αT3-1 cells, near-confluent monolayers in 15-cm dishes were incubated without or with GnRH, and cells were harvested by adding lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin, 0.2 μm soybean trypsin inhibitor) and 1 mm DTT, pipetting the cells off the dish, and incubating at 4 °C for 30 min. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation (16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and either samples were removed and mixed with gel loading buffer (35Oberdorf J. Webster J.M. Zhu C.C. Luo S.G. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) for subsequent immunoblotting or selected proteins were immunoprecipitated by incubating with antisera and Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B for 4–16 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed thoroughly with lysis buffer, resuspended in gel loading buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and either transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting or silver stained with the Proteosilver™ Plus Silver Stain Kit (Sigma). For Rat-1 cells, near-confluent monolayers in 15-cm dishes or 6-well plates were serum-starved for 16 h, and then incubated with or without ET1. Lysates were harvested by adding lysis buffer plus protease inhibitor mixture, followed by vigorous scraping. Cells were then treated with 2.5 mm N-ethylmaleimide for 1 min to inhibit de-ubiquitinating enzymes, followed by 5 mm DTT. After 30 min at 4 °C, lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and IP3R1 was either analyzed in immunoblots or immunoprecipitated and analyzed as described forαT3-1 cells. For pancreas, pancreata were removed from female rats and cross-chopped into 0.5-mm3 cubes with a McIlwain chopper, and the cubes were washed several times with O2-gassed 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 127 mm NaCl, 0.57 mm MgCl2, 4.7 mm KCl, 0.55 mm Na2PO4, 6 mm NaOH, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 11.1 mm glucose, 0.05 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Samples were then incubated at 37 °C in the same buffer without or with cholecystokinin. The cubes were then homogenized in lysis buffer plus protease inhibitor mixture as described (37Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Ernst S.A. Yule D.I. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 1194-1201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and incubated with a mixture of anti-IP3R1, anti-IP3R2, and anti-IP3R3 to immunoprecipitate all receptor types, which were then analyzed as for αT3-1 cells. For TNFα experiments in HeLa cells, near-confluent monolayers were incubated without or with TNFα, and cells were harvested by adding lysis buffer plus protease inhibitor mixture and pipetting the cells off the dish. Lysates were then treated with 2.5 mm N-ethylmaleimide for 1 min, followed by 5 mm DTT. After 30 min at 4 °C, lysates were clarified by centrifugation and either samples were taken for immunoblotting or IκBα was immunoprecipitated as described for αT3-1 cells. Electrophoresis, Immunoblotting, and Mass Spectroscopy—Samples in gel loading buffer (35Oberdorf J. Webster J.M. Zhu C.C. Luo S.G. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) were routinely heated to 100 °C for 3 min prior to loading onto gels, but when HMGR350-3HA and CD3δ-HA were analyzed, samples were heated at 37 °C for 30 min to avoid protein aggregation. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and immunoblotted, and immunoreactivity was detected with Pierce chemiluminescence reagents (Fisher Scientific) and quantitated using a Genegnome Imager (Syngene Bio Imaging). Alternatively, silver-stained protein bands were cut from SDS-PAGE gels, destained, and sent for in-gel trypsinization and mass spectral analysis at the Molecular Biology Core Facilities at Dana Farber Cancer Institute (Boston, MA). The MS-Fit data base (University of California San Francisco Mass Spectrometry Facility) was used to provide possible identities for the peptides generated from each gel band. Resulting identities were confirmed by immunoblotting. Plasmids and siRNA Constructs—An expressed sequence tag clone containing the full-length mouse SPFH2 sequence in pCMV-Sport6 was purchased from ATCC and verified by sequencing, and the open reading frame was cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). SPFH2 was tagged with an HA epitope at its C terminus by using PCR to insert the HA epitope sequence in-frame with the 3′-end of SPFH2 cDNA, and SPFH2-HA-N106Q was generated using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. HA-ubiquitin cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. R. Rottapel (Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada), CD3δ-HA cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. A. Weissman (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD), and HMGR350-3HA cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. J. Roitelman (Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel). Five short interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences (SPFH2si1–5) were designed to correspond to different regions of rat, mouse, and human SPFH2 mRNA, and two of these, SPFH2si1, encoded by ttgaagtggtgaacttcct, and SPFH2si5, encoded by ctgcagctgatgaagtaca, were found to be effective. In addition, a control siRNA (Random), encoded by actgtcacaagtacctaca, was designed to have no homology to any rat, mouse, or human mRNA sequences. Sense (5′gatcccc(SPFH2si1–5)ttcaagaga(reverse complement)tttttggaaa) and antisense (5′agcttttccaaaaa(SPFH2si1–5)tctcttgaa(reverse complement)ggg) oligonucleotides were synthesized (Sigma-Genosys), annealed, and ligated into the retroviral vectors, pSUPER.retro.puro (44Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 243-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 45Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3949) Google Scholar), or, for doxycycline-inducible expression, 6OH1O-pSUPER.retro.puro. Correct ligation of these siRNA-encoding vectors was confirmed by restriction digestion and DNA sequencing. 6OH1O-pSUPER.retro.puro was generated by replacing the H1 promoter and siRNA-encoding region of pSUPER.retro.puro with the H1 promoter-tetracycline operator (TO)-siRNA-encoding sequence region of pTER (a kind gift from Dr. H. Clevers, Center for Biomedical Genetics, Utrecht, The Netherlands) (46van de Wetering M. Oving I. Muncan V. Pon Fong M.T. Brantjes H. van Leenen D. Holstege F.C.P. Brummelkamp T.R. Agami R. Clevers H. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). To further decrease transcription in the absence of doxycycline, six TOs were also introduced upstream of the H1 promoter. Upon introduction into cells, transcription from the H1 RNA polymerase III promoter in each of these vectors generates short hairpin RNAs that are further processed into siRNAs by the cell's endogenous RNAi machinery (45Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3949) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HeLa cells plated on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips were transiently co-transfected with pDsRed2-ER (Clontech) and SPFH2 cDNAs using Lipofectamine 2000. 24 h post-transfection, the cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 1 h, washed in PBS for 5 min, incubated in –20 °C methanol for 10 min, rinsed in –20 °C acetone, washed in PBS for 5 min, incubated in goat blocking solution (10% goat serum, 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 45 min at room temperature, incubated with anti-SPFH2 (1:200 in goat blocking solution) for 16 h at 4 °C, washed thrice in PBS for 5 min, and then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-rabbit (1:200 in goat blocking solution) for 1 h. After three 5-min washes in PBS, the cells were mounted on glass slides using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) to preserve the fluorescent signals. Images were acquired on a Zeiss AxioPlan 2 microscope equipped with a 63× oil immersion objective (Appochromat from Zeiss). Cell Fractionation and Proteinase K Incubation—For cell fractionation, Rat-1 cells were harvested in 1.5 ml of hypotonic homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris-base, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitor mixture and 1 mm DTT, and sonicated for 1 min. The homogenates were first centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the pellets were resuspended in 1.5 ml of either hypotonic buffer or hypotonic buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% SDS, or 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11.2, incubated for 1 h at 4°C with frequent vortexing, and then re-centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to obtain soluble and pellet fractions. Pellets were resuspended in 1.5 ml of the appropriate buffer, and equal volumes of each fraction were loaded onto gels. α-Transaldolase was used as a cytosolic marker (3Webster J.M. Tiwari S.

In this report, we show that the tick salivary gland transcriptome and proteome is dynamic and changes during the process of engorgement. We demonstrate, using a guinea pig model of I. scapularis feeding and B. burgdorferi transmission, that immunity directed against salivary proteins expressed in the first 24 h of tick attachment — and not later — is sufficient to evoke all the hallmarks of acquired tick-immunity, to thwart tick feeding and also to impair Borrelia transmission. Defining this subset of proteins will promote a mechanistic understanding of novel I. scapularis proteins critical for the initiation of tick feeding and for Borrelia transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2050264932,"SOX2 plays an important role in early embryogenesis by cooperating with OCT4 in regulating gene expression in fertilized eggs, yet the precise mechanism through which SOX2 accomplishes this important function remains poorly understood. Here, we describe the identification of two nuclear localization signals (NLS) in SOX2 and the generation of a dominant-negative mutant (Dmu-mSox2) by mutating these two NLS in its high mobility group domain. Characterization of this mutant demonstrated that SOX2 shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus using these two NLS. The mutant has lost its ability to interact with OCT4, but remains competent to interact with wild-type SOX2. Functionally, Dmu-mSox2 is inactive and unable to cooperate with OCT4 in transactivating target promoters bearing its binding sites. However, Dmu-mSox2 is able to inhibit the activity of wild-type SOX2 and subsequently suppress the activity of downstream genes such as Oct4 and Nanog. When stably expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells, Dmu-mSox2 triggered progressive doublings of cell ploidy (>8N), leading to differentiation into the trophectoderm lineage. Knockdown of Sox2 by small interfering RNA also induced trophectoderm differentiation and polyploid formation in mouse ES cells. These results suggest that SOX2 maintains stem cell pluripotency by shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm in cooperation with OCT4 to prevent trophectoderm differentiation and polyploid formation in ES cells.

Stem cell-based therapies are promising solutions to many current unmet medical needs such as diabetes and Parkinson disease. Given their potential to differentiate into virtually all types of cells in the human body, human embryonic stem (ES) 2The abbreviations used are: ES, embryonic stem; HMG, high mobility group; NLS, nuclear localization signal(s); RT, reverse transcription; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; m, mouse; GFP, green fluorescent protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA. 2The abbreviations used are: ES, embryonic stem; HMG, high mobility group; NLS, nuclear localization signal(s); RT, reverse transcription; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; m, mouse; GFP, green fluorescent protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA. cells may be used to replace any aged or damaged cells under various pathological conditions (1Thomson J.A.

To accomplish these therapeutic goals, formidable obstacles must be overcome in such areas as the procurement and maintenance of ES cells in pluripotent states and efficient methods to differentiate the ES cells to a specific cell type suitable for transplantation. Although progress has been made in the derivation of human ES cells, the lack of understanding of stem cell pluripotency and differentiation may hamper any serious attempt to harness the potential of stem cell-based therapies (2Boiani M. Schöler H.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 872-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Thus, investigations into the molecular and cellular mechanisms of stem cell biology such as self-renewal and pluripotency are essential steps in developing the necessary tools for utilizing ES cells in future therapeutic interventions (2Boiani M. Schöler H.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 872-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 3Pan G.J. Chang Z.Y. Schöler H.R. Pei D.

One of the key properties of ES cells is their ability to undergo self-renewal indefinitely (2Boiani M. Schöler H.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 872-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). This property appears to be regulated by a network of transcription factors (2Boiani M. Schöler H.R. Nat. Rev. Mol.

The first such factor recognized to play a critical role in stem cell pluripotency is the homeodomain transcription factor OCT4, a deficiency in which fails to support the development of pluripotent inner cell mass in early embryogenesis (2Boiani M. Schöler H.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 872-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 3Pan G.J. Chang Z.Y. Schöler H.R. Pei D. Cell Res. 2002; 12: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Most recently, another homeodomain protein, NANOG, has also been shown to be involved in maintaining the inner cell mass in early embryogenesis and the self-renewal of ES cells in culture (6Mitsui K. Tokuzawa Y. Itoh H. Segawa K. Murakami M. Takahashi K. Maruyama M. Maeda M. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2003; 113: 631-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2522) Google Scholar, 7Chambers I.

Given the common pathway these factors appear to regulate, recent studies have revealed that both factors indeed regulate similar sets of genes by co-occupying adjacent sites within their regulatory regions (5Boyer L.A. Lee T.I. Cole M.F. Johnstone S.E. Levine S.S. Zucker J.P. Guenther M.G. Kumar R.M. Murray H.L. Jenner R.G. Gifford D.K. Melton D.A. Jaenisch R. Young R.A.

Furthermore, our work suggests that these factors may form a negative feedback loop that limits the activity of OCT4 and ensures the proper expression of these factors in a dynamic fashion in ES cells. 3J. Li, G. Pan, K. Cui, Y. Liu, S. Xu, and D. Pei, submitted for publication. 3J. Li, G. Pan, K. Cui, Y. Liu, S. Xu, and D. Pei, submitted for publication. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that transcription factors play a critical role in controlling stem cell self-renewal in a cooperative fashion (2Boiani M. Schöler H.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 872-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 3Pan G.J. Chang Z.Y. Schöler H.R. Pei D. Cell Res. 2002; 12: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). SOX2 is a transcription factor with a high mobility group (HMG) domain and has also been implicated in the regulation of stem cell pluripotency by maintaining the expression of Fgf4 in the inner cell mass (9Ambrosetti D.C. Basilico C. Dailey L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Gene targeting experiments revealed a cell-autonomous requirement for SOX2 in both the epiblast and extraembryonic ectoderm (10Avilion A.A. Nicolis S.K. Pevny L.H. Perez L. Vivian N. Lovell-Badge R. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 126-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, SOX2 functions to regulate downstream genes through cooperation with OCT4 by binding to adjacent sites (8Rodda D.J. Chew J.-L. Lim L.-H. Loh Y.-H. Wang B. Ng H.-H. Robson P. J. Biol.

In addition to its role in early embryogenesis, when SOX2 and OCT4 coexpress in pluripotent cells, SOX2 appears to play an additional role in later developmental stages such as neural differentiation by consolidating the neural identity of early neuroectoderm cells in Xenopus and the proliferation and/or maintenance of neural stem cells in mice (15Kishi M. Mizuseki K. Sasai N. Yamazaki H. Shiota K. Nakanishi S. Sasai Y. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 791-800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Episkopou V. Trends Neurosci. 2005; 28: 219-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Indeed, mutations in SOX2 have been identified in individuals with anophthalmia (17Fantes J. Ragge N.K. Lynch S.A. McGill N.I. Collin J.R. Howard-Peebles P.N. Hayward C. Vivian A.J. Williamson K. van Heyningen V. Fitzpatrick D.R. Nat.

SOX2 is also expressed in pluripotent cells in the extraembryonic ectoderm (10Avilion A.A. Nicolis S.K. Pevny L.H. Perez L. Vivian N. Lovell-Badge R. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 126-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that SOX2 may be able to mediate gene expression independently of its known partner, OCT4, yet the mechanism through which SOX2 can regulate gene expression and cell differentiation remains poorly understood. Unlike OCT4, SOX2 appears to be localized in both the nuclei and cytoplasm in pre-implantation embryos (10Avilion A.A. Nicolis S.K. Pevny L.H. Perez L. Vivian N. Lovell-Badge R. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 126-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar). This unique subcellular localization pattern suggests that SOX2 shuttles between these two subcellular compartments and that its nuclear localization regulates its transcription activity. Here, we demonstrate that SOX2 contains two nuclear localization signals (NLS). The ablation of these two NLS resulted in a dominant-negative form of SOX2 that we named Dmu-mSox2. When stably expressed in ES cells, this mutant protein triggered a dramatic differentiation of ES cells into the trophectoderm lineage and the formation of polyploid (>8N) cells. Our results not only suggest that SOX2 functions to prevent the differentiation of ES cells into the trophectoderm lineage, but also demonstrate that Dmu-mSox2 may be a potentially useful tool in controlling stem cell differentiation. Plasmid Construction and Reporter Assays—The mouse Sox2 cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using high fidelity Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen) from mRNA isolated from CGR8 ES cells. The following primers were used: 5′-accatgtataacatgatggagacggagc-3′ (forward) and 5′-catgtgcgacaggggcagtgtgccg-3′ (reverse). The SOX2 cDNAs were inserted into the EcoRV site of modified pCR3.1 for the mammalian expression vector. SOX2 NLS mutants was generated by site-directed mutagenesis with the following primers: SOX2 NLS1 mu, 5′-gtcccgggggcagctgggtaagatggcccaggagaa-3′ (forward) and 5′-ttctcctgggccatcttacccagctgcccccgggac-3′ (reverse); SOX2 NLS1 KR mu, 5′-agcccggaccgcgtcacggggcccatgaacgccttc-3′ (forward) and 5′-gaaggcgttcatgggccccgtgacgcggtccgggct-3′ (reverse); SOX2 NLS2, 5′-tataaataccggccgctggggaaaaaccaagacgctc-3′ (forward) and 5′-gagcgtcttggttttccccagcggccggtatttata-3′ (reverse). For mutant SOX2 expression without any tag, primers 5′-tcgcacatgatcgactgaaaggacgacgatgac-3′ (forward) and 5′-gtcatcgtcgtcctttcagtcgatcatgtgcga-3′ (reverse) were used. Oct4 and Nanog promoter fragments were amplified by PCR from mouse liver genomic DNA and inserted into the SmaI site of the promoterless luciferase reporter vector pGL-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI). Primers 5′-acagacaggactgctgggctgcagg-3′ (forward) and 5′-tggaaagacggctcacctaggg-3′ (reverse) for the Oct4 promoter (2170 bp) and primers 5′-ttgggcatggtggtagacaa-3′ (forward) and 5′-gtcagtgtgatggcgagggaagggat-3′ (reverse) for the Nanog promoter (926 bp) were used. The Oct4 reporter plasmid 6w-Luc and the control vector p37TK-Luc were kindly provided by Dr. Hans Schöler. 6×O/S was provided by Dr. Lisa Dailey. For reporter assays, transfection efficiencies were normalized with a Renilla plasmid as internal references, and DNA concentrations were kept constant with an empty expression vector. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and luciferase activity was measured using Dual-Luciferase (Promega). Cell Culture, Transfection, and Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter (FACS) Analysis—NIH3T3, HeLa, and 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and 100 μg/ml antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin; Invitrogen). CGR8 ES cells were cultured on 0.1% gelatin-coated substrates in ES medium consisting of Glasgow minimal essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 20% ES-qualified fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 100 mm nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), 0.55 mm β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), 0.224 μg/ml l-glutamine (Invitrogen), and 1000 units/ml human recombinant leukemia inhibitor factor (Chemicon). 293T cells were transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation methods. NIH3T3, HeLa, and CGR8 ES cells were transfected by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For cell cycle analysis, cells were stained with propidium iodide and analyzed by FACS with a MoFlo high performance cell sorter using a 488-nm argon laser excitation source and a 580/30-nm band-pass red filter. For Troma-1-positive cell analysis, cells were dissociated with 0.25% trypsin and 1 mm EDTA; resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline; and incubated with anti-TROMA-1 primary antibody (1:100; Institut Pasteur), followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), using the MoFlo high performance cell sorter (excitation at 488 nm and measured at 530/40 nm with a band-pass green filter). Cell Lysate Preparation and Western Blot Analysis—After 48 h of transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% Triton X-100) for 10 min and cleared of debris by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. After boiling with an equal volume of 2× SDS loading buffer for 5 min, cell lysates were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The membranes were then blotted with 5% nonfat milk and incubated with anti-FLAG antibody (1:2500), followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:2500). The membranes were washed extensively and developed by incubation in solution containing nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Co-immunoprecipitation—For co-immunoprecipitation, expression plasmids were transfected into 293T cells using calcium phosphate. After 24 h of transfection, cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 600 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm EDTA plus 10 μlof protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Cleared cell lysates (40 μl) were saved for direct Western blot analysis to determine protein expression levels, and the remaining samples were transferred to a new tube containing 30 μl of anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma) and washed twice with Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and 137 mm NaCl) before incubation for 6 h at 4 °C. The anti-FLAG antibody-bound beads were then washed three times with Tris-buffered saline. The beads were eluted by boiling for 5 min in 2× SDS loading buffer with 5% β-mercaptoethanol. After centrifugation, supernatants were loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for detection. Microscopy and Cell Staining—The morphologies of cells and embryonic bodies were captured using a Nikon digital camera and then imported into Adobe Photoshop Version 6.0. For immunostaining, cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline; washed; blocked in 10% normal goat serum; and then stained with primary antibodies, including anti-SOX2 (catalog no. sc-20088) and anti-OCT4 (catalog no. sc-5279) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-SSEA-1 antibody (Chemicon), and anti-TROMA-1 antibody. Secondary antibodies, including TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (SouthernBiotech) and TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), were used for detection. The images were captured using an Olympus FV500 confocal system. RT-PCR—Cytoplasmic RNAs were extracted from lysates of cells treated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and quantified by spectrophotometry. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCRs were then performed to amplify the intended genes under the following conditions: 95 °C for 3 min, 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 45 s for 25–32 cycles.

The PCR products were electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gels in the presence of ethidium bromide and then photographed in a UV light box. Real-time RT-PCR Analysis—2 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed in a final volume of 20 μlas described previously. PCRs were undertaken using a Real-Time PCR Master Mix (SYBR green) reagent kit (Toyobo) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR was performed in a 15-μl total volume for 45 cycles.

Mouse (m) SOX2 Contains Two NLS Required for Nuclear Localization and Transcription Activity—SOX2, a member of the HMG transcription factor family previously shown to be expressed early in embryogenesis and in neural stem cells, interacts with the POU transcription factor OCT4 through the HMG/POU domains to regulate the expression of many downstream genes, including Fgf4, Utf1, Nanog, and pouf5, for maintaining the pluri- or multipotent states both in vivo and in vitro (8Rodda D.J.

As a nuclear protein, SOX2 must enter the nucleus to regulate the expression of its downstream genes, yet little is known about how SOX2 is localized in the nucleus. Interestingly, it has been observed that SOX2 appears to be present in the cytoplasm and to shuttle between the cytoplasm and nuclei during early embryogenesis (10Avilion A.A. Nicolis S.K. Pevny L.H. Perez L. Vivian N. Lovell-Badge R. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 126-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may have a function outside the nucleus. To characterize the cellular distribution of SOX2 further, we fused a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-FLAG tag to its C terminus (Fig. 1A) and expressed the chimera in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 1C, although GFP alone diffused randomly in the whole cell (panels d–f), SOX2-GFP localized exclusively to the nuclei (panels g–i), confirming the fact that SOX2 is indeed a nuclear protein. This appears to agree with SOX9, a close relative of SOX2, which was reported to localize in the nuclei by two functional NLS within the HMG domain: a traditional basic amino acid clusters and a bipartite motif (20Sudbeck P. Scherer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27848-27852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Apparently, these two NLS are well conserved in the HMG transcription factor family, as shown in Fig. 1A. To test the role of these two NLS in SOX2, we performed single or double mutagenesis on these sites (Fig. 1A). Upon transfection into HeLa cells, these mutants were expressed as stable proteins, like the wild-type protein (Fig. 1B). On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 1C, mutations of NLS1 (panels s–u), NLS2 (panels v–x), or both mutations (panels j–l) caused the diffusion of SOX2 into the whole cells, suggesting that each NLS is partially effective in localizing SOX2 to the nuclei. Indeed, when fused to GFP, either NLS could drive GFP to the nuclei only partially (Fig. 1C, panels m–r), further demonstrating the requirement of both NLS for the nuclear localization of SOX2. Because the GFP tag may influence the subcellular localization of its fusion partners, we repeated the localization experiments with FLAG-tagged SOX2 as shown in Fig. 2. As expected, the mutant proteins were expressed at identical sizes compared with wild-type SOX2 as detected by Western blotting (Fig. 2B). The subcellular localizations of these proteins were then analyzed by immunofluorescent staining using anti-SOX2 antibody. Consistent with the data in Fig. 1, wild-type SOX2 localized exclusively in the nuclei (Fig. 2C, panels d–f), whereas SOX2 proteins with either single mutation (NLS1 or NLS2; panels j–o) or the double mutation (panels g–i) diffused to the whole cells. Together, these data demonstrate that both NLS are required for the nuclear localization of SOX2.FIGURE 2Mutation of the mSOX2 NLS blocks its nuclear localization and destroys its transcription activity. A, schematic presentation of wild-type (WT) and NLS mutant mSOX2-FLAG (F) in expression vector pCR3.1-FLAG. B, Western blot analysis of wild-type and NLS mutant mSOX2. After transfection, HeLa cells were lysed and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-SOX2 antibody CK, blank. C, cell localization of wild-type and NLS mutant mSOX2. After transfection, HeLa cells were stained without a primary antibody (panels a–c) and with anti-SOX2 antibody (panels d–o), followed by TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (panels a–o). The cells were then scanned by confocal microscopy in fluorescent fields (panels a, d, g, j, and m), bright fields (panels b, e, h, k, and n), and combined fields (panels c, f, i, l, and o). D, the mutation of NLS destroys its transcription activity. The reporter 6× O/S (bars 4–8) was cotransfected with the indicated plasmids into HeLa cells cultured in a 12-well plate. p37TK was cotransfected with the control vector (bar 2) or mSOX2-FLAG (bar 3). Each transfection was carried out in duplicate, and the luciferase activity was assayed 36 h after transfection using the Dual-Luciferase assay system as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our previous work on OCT4 demonstrated that the NLS is essential not only to its nuclear localization, but also to its transcription activity (22Pan G. Qin B. Liu N. Schöler H.R. Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37013-37020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To test whether the same applies to SOX2, we analyzed the transcription activity of wild-type SOX2 or its mutants in HeLa cells with the reporter construct 6× O/S, which harbors six copies of the OCT4/SOX2-binding site from the Fgf4 promoter (21Fraidenraich D. Lang R. Basilico C. Dev. Biol. 1998; 204: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2D, SOX2 activated the 6× O/S reporter strongly but had no effect on the control reporter p37TK (bar 5 versus bar 3). However, SOX2 mutants with either a single or NLS double mutation lost some or most of the transcription activity (Fig. 2D, bars 6–8). These data demonstrate that the two NLS of SOX2 play dual roles in SOX2 function: nuclear localization and transcription activity, as observed in OCT4 (22Pan G. Qin B. Liu N. Schöler H.R. Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37013-37020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Ablation of the NLS in SOX2 Also Impairs Its Interaction with OCT4—It is well established that SOX2 interacts with OCT4 to regulate downstream genes. To investigate whether the NLS in SOX2 also play a role in its interaction with OCT4, FLAG-tagged wild-type or NLS double mutant SOX2 was expressed either alone or with untagged OCT4 in 293T cells. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG antibody and probed with anti-FLAG (Fig. 3A, panel a) or anti-OCT4 (panel b) antibody, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3A, wild-type SOX2 interacted with OCT4 as expected in this co-immunoprecipitation experiment (panel b, lane 5 versus lane 11), whereas double mutant SOX2 did not (lane 6 versus lane 12). These data demonstrate that SOX2 interacts with OCT4 in an NLS-dependent fashion. We then performed rep"

In an attempt to tackle these issues, we have developed a process of virtual screening based on the observation that conformational rearrangements of the dengue virus envelope protein are essential for the mediation of viral entry into host cells via membrane fusion. Screening was based solely on the structural information of the Dengue virus envelope protein and was focused on a target site that is presumably important for the conformational rearrangements necessary for viral entry. To circumvent the issue of lead compound toxicity, we performed screening based on molecular docking using structural databases of medical compounds. To enhance the identification of hits, we further categorized and selected candidates according to their novel structural characteristics. Finally, the selected candidates were subjected to a biological validation assay to assess inhibition of Dengue virus propagation in mammalian host cells using a plaque formation assay. Among the 10 compounds examined, rolitetracycline and doxycycline significantly inhibited plaque formation, demonstrating their inhibitory effect on dengue virus propagation. Both compounds were tetracycline derivatives with IC50s estimated to be 67.1 µM and 55.6 µM, respectively. Their docked conformations displayed common hydrophobic interactions with critical residues that affected membrane fusion during viral entry. These interactions will therefore position the tetracyclic ring moieties of both inhibitors to bind firmly to the target and, subsequently, disrupt conformational rearrangement and block viral entry. This process can be applied to other drug targets in which conformational rearrangement is critical to function."
https://openalex.org/W2077528807,"Core histones H3 and H4 are rapidly imported into the nucleus by members of the karyopherin (Kap)/importin family. We showed that H3 and H4 interact with Kap123p, histone acetyltransferase-B complex (HAT-B), and Asf1p in cytosol. In vivo analysis indicated that Kap123p is required for H3-mediated import, whereas H4 utilizes multiple Kaps including Kap123p. The evolutionary conservation of H3 and H4 cytoplasmic acetylation led us to analyze the role of acetylation in nuclear transport. We determined that lysine 14 is critical for H3 NLS function in vivo and demonstrated that mutation of H3 lysine 14 to the acetylation-mimic glutamine decreased association with Kap123p in vitro. Several lysines in the H4 NLS are important for its function. We showed that mutation of key lysines to glutamine resulted in a greater import defect than mutation to arginine, suggesting that positive charge promotes NLS function. Lastly we determined that six of ten N-terminal acetylation sites in H3 and H4 can be mutated to arginine, indicating that deposition acetylation is not absolutely necessary in vivo. However, the growth defect of these mutants suggests that acetylation does play an important role in import. These findings suggest a model where cytosolic histones bind import karyopherins prior to acetylation. Other factors are recruited to this complex such as HAT-B and Asf1p; these factors in turn promote acetylation. Acetylation may be important for modulating the interaction with transport factors and may play a role in the release of histones from karyopherins in the nucleus.

Eukaryotic chromatin consists of ∼146 base pairs of DNA wrapped around a nucleosomal core composed primarily of the four core histones, H3, H4, H2A, and H2B (1Kornberg R.D. Lorch Y.

Two copies of each core histone are assembled onto DNA to form a histone octamer. Each core histone has an unstructured N terminus that extends out from the nucleosome and is the target of numerous enzymes, which post-translationally modify specific residues located within the N-terminal tail, altering histone and nucleosomal function (2Luger K.

Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6679) Google Scholar). Histone acetylation has been well studied and regulates such processes as gene transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair (4Strahl B.D. Allis C.D.

A longstanding mystery has been the role of what has been called deposition acetylation on histones H3 and H4. Histone H4 Lys5,12 diacetylation occurs soon after histone translation and is conserved through evolution (7Sobel R.E. Cook R.G. Perry C.A. Annunziato A.T. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recent data suggest that the histone chaperone Asf1p is necessary for acetylation of H3 Lys9 and Lys56, which may occur prior to histone incorporation into nucleosomes (9Adkins M.W. Carson J.J.

Some acetyl groups are removed soon after nucleosome assembly occurs in the nucleus, suggesting a role of early acetylation in either the nuclear import of histones or in nucleosome assembly (11Annunziato A.T.

Nuclear import of the core histones is important for the efficient progression through the S-phase of the cell cycle, when a ready supply of newly synthesized histones is needed for the assembly of the newly replicated DNA. New histones are likely also required for the chromatin remodeling that takes place during transcription and DNA repair in other phases of the cell cycle. Nuclear import of the core histones is facilitated by a family of proteins known as karyopherins (Kaps) or importins, which are able to bind to nuclear localization signals (NLS) located within nuclear cargo proteins and target the protein for import into the nucleus (19Mosammaparast N. Pemberton L.F. Trend Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 547-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 20Pemberton L.F. Paschal B.M.

Each core histone contains an NLS in the positively charged N-terminal domain, and indeed many NLSs from diverse proteins have been shown to contain positively charged residues (19Mosammaparast N. Pemberton L.F. Trend Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 547-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 20Pemberton L.F. Paschal B.M.

As discussed above, the N-terminal domains of histones are the substrates for many modifications that can alter the overall charge status of the N-terminal tail. In budding yeast, the core histones are imported by distinct pathways, with histones H2A and H2B being imported primarily by Kap114p and histones H3 and H4 being imported primarily by Kap123p and Kap121p (16Mosammaparast N.

Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Pemberton L.F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We set out to determine which proteins interact with histones H3 and H4 prior to nucleosome assembly, to analyze which amino acids in the histone N terminus were important for import and to determine whether charged or noncharged NLSs made better import signals. Here we show that the histone chaperone Asf1p and the HAT-B complex proteins (Hat1p, Hat2p, and Hif1p) interact with histones prior to nucleosome assembly. We demonstrate that HAT-B and Asf1p form co-complexes with histones and the transport factor Kap123p, indicating a role for these factors in histone import. We demonstrate that specific lysines in the H3 and H4 N termini, which are known to be acetylated, play critical roles in nuclear import. Using mutants we show that loss of positive charge, by mutation of lysines to glutamine, decreases nuclear import of both H3 and H4 NLS reporters, and in the case of H3 Lys14 decreases Kap123p association. This suggests that acetylation may occur after transport factor binding, or may modulate the interaction of the N-terminal tail with transport factors by preventing transport factors from binding to specific tails in the tetramer. Yeast Strains—S. cerevisiae strains used in this study were derived from DF5 and W303 (22Mosammaparast N. Jackson K.R. Guo Y. Brame C.J. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Pemberton L.F. J.

JHY200 kap123::HIS3 was created by genomic integration of HIS3 into the KAP123 open reading frame and verified by PCR analysis. Plasmids—H3 NLS (residues 1–28) and H4 NLS (residues 1–34) constructs were based on the pGFP2-C-FUS plasmid described previously (16Mosammaparast N. Guo Y. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Pemberton L.F. J.

N-terminal deletions and specific amino acid substitutions were created by oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis. Combination of H3 and H4 mutations was achieved by subcloning the relevant fragments. pMAL-Kap123 and pGEX-H31–28zz were previously described (16Mosammaparast N. Guo Y. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Pemberton L.F. J. Biol.

Histone mutations and plasmid constructs were verified by restriction digest and DNA sequencing. Microscopy and Quantitation—DF5 yeast transformed with the pGFP2-C-FUS plasmids were grown in SC-MET-URA media for 2 h to induce GFP expression and microscopy was performed as described (16Mosammaparast N.

For each figure, GFP images were captured using the same exposure settings and manipulated identically using Adobe Photoshop 6.0. Quantitation of the nuclear to cytoplasmic (N/C) ratios of mean fluorescent intensity of the histone NLS GFP reporters were performed as described with the following modifications (22Mosammaparast N. Jackson K.R. Guo Y. Brame C.J. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Pemberton L.F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Images were taken at a 500-ms exposure with coincident Hoechst staining to aid in detection of the cell nucleus. The mean N/C ratio was determined for 80–100 cells of each reporter quantified. Quantitation of GFP Reporters—Whole cell lysates were prepared from equal amounts of induced yeast cultures. Lysates were Western blotted using an anti-GFP antibody, and an anti-Pgk1 antibody as a loading control. GFP and Pgk1p were quantified using a LI-COR Odyssey Infrared Imaging System. Histone Mutant Strain Construction and Growth Assays—JHY200 yeast strains transformed with plasmid pQQ18 containing mutant alleles of HHT2 and HHF2 were plated onto SC-URA-LEU double selection media to select for both the wild-type plasmid pJH33 and the mutant plasmid pQQ18. Multiple colonies from each transformation were grown sequentially on two selection plates of SC media containing 5-fluorootic acid (5-FOA) to select against the URA3 positive pJH33 covering plasmid. Yeast were struck onto SC-LEU to ensure the yeast contained the LEU2-positive pQQ18 plasmid. After the 5-FOA shuffle, plasmids were recovered and analyzed by restriction digest to verify the yeast retained the correct histone mutations. Cultures of yeast dependent on mutant histone alleles were equalized to an optical density of 1. 10-fold serial dilutions of each strain were spotted onto YPD plates and grown at 30 °C for 2–3 days. Purification of Recombinant Proteins and in Vitro Binding Assays—GST-tagged Hat1p, Asf1-Np, H31–28zz, H31–28K14Qzz, and MBP-tagged Kap123p were purified according to the manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare, NEB). H31–28zz and H31–28K14Qzz were cleaved with thrombin as previously described (16Mosammaparast N. Guo Y. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Pemberton L.F. J. Biol.

GST-Hat1p and GST-Asf1-Np binding assays were performed in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Tween-20) with 15% glycerol. Glutathione-Sepharose was preblocked in TB with 10% bovine serum albumin prior to use in binding assays. Glutathione-Sepharose was preincubated with 500 nm GST-Hat1p and 6 μg chicken erythrocyte histones, or 1 μm GST-Asf1-Np and 2 μg of purified chicken erythrocyte histones, respectively at 4 °C for 1 h. The Sepharose was then washed with binding buffer containing 2 m KCl. 1 μm MBP-Kap123p was then added and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing, bound protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. H31–28zz and H31–28K14Qzz binding assays were performed in TB with 15% glycerol as previously described (16Mosammaparast N. Guo Y. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Pemberton L.F. J. Biol.

Bound H31–28zz and H31–28K14Qzz was detected by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Bound MBP-Kap123p was detected with anti MBP antibody.

We have also determined that Hif1p and Asf1p were present in this cytosolic data set (Hif1p; 14 unique peptides, Asf1; 8 unique peptides). Kap123p and Pse1p were shown to be the major import Kaps for H3 and H4 (16Mosammaparast N. Guo Y. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Pemberton L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 862-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The isolation of HAT-B and Asf1p with H4 from cytosolic extracts suggested that they interact with H3 and H4 prior to their nuclear import. However, these immunoprecipitations did not exclude the possibility that multiple complexes existed in yeast cytosol; separate histone-HAT-B or histone-Asf1p complexes, and a histone-karyopherin complex. To confirm that HAT-B and Asf1p existed in import complexes with the karyopherin, we performed in vitro binding assays to determine if a co-complex of Hat1p, histones, and Kap123p can be formed. GST-Hat1p did not interact directly with MBP-Kap123p suggesting it was not a direct cargo of Kap123p (Fig. 1A). We then tested if a co-complex of Hat1p, Kap123p, H3, and H4 could be formed. GST-Hat1p was preincubated with chicken erythrocyte histones prior to the addition of MBP-Kap123p. MBP-Kap123p was able to form a complex with GST-Hat1p in the presence of histones, demonstrating that histones can bridge an interaction between Hat1p and Kap123p in vitro (Fig. 1A). We also demonstrated that histones bridge an interaction between Hat2p and Kap123p (data not shown). As above we next performed in vitro binding assays with recombinant GST-Asf1p. For these experiments, we used a GST fusion expressing the conserved core region of Asf1, residues 1–155 (GST-Asf1-Np). This region of Asf1p has been demonstrated to interact directly with histones and can rescue defects seen in Δasf1 strains (25Daganzo S.M. Erzberger J.P. Lam W.M. Skordalakes E. Zhang R. Franco A.A.

Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 59-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Also, GST-Asf1-Np was expressed more efficiently in vitro than full-length GST-Asf1p. MBP-Kap123p did not associate with GST-Asf1-Np, whereas, incubation of this fusion with core histones resulted in the association of H3 and H4 with GST-Asf1-Np. MBP-Kap123p associated with GST-Asf1-Np in the presence of histones, suggesting that histones are bridging an interaction between Asf1-Np and Kap123p (Fig. 1B). A similar co-complex could be formed using full length Asf1p (data not shown). These results suggest that cytosolic Kap123p exists in co-complexes with HAT-B and Asf1p, and in these complexes the interaction of Kap123p with the assembly factor or HAT is bridged by histones. HAT-B acetylates newly synthesized H4, and Asf1p interacts with histones containing early acetylation marks (14Parthun M.R. Widom J. Gottschling D.E.

Chem. 2006; 281: 37270-37274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). A synthetic lethal interaction between Δasf1 and the N terminus of H4 (residues 1–27) has been observed, suggesting that loss of early acetylation marks is deleterious for yeast growth (9Adkins M.W. Carson J.J. English C.M. Ramey C.J. Tyler J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1334-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These published results suggested that the acetylated lysines play a crucial role in H3 and H4 import. However it was possible Asf1p and Hat1p were initially recruited to import complexes containing unacetylated histones, and were important to then bring about subsequent histone acetylation. We therefore decided to investigate the role of acetylated amino acids in H3 and H4 in import. Histone NLSs Are Redundant—Both H3 and H4 contain an NLS in their N terminus (16Mosammaparast N. Guo Y. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Pemberton L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 862-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We therefore wanted to determine whether both NLS signals were necessary in vivo and determine which amino acids played critical roles. It has previously been shown that strains that are dependent for growth on a single copy of H3 and H4 only require one of these histones to have an intact N terminus. These regions were defined as H3 residues 1–28 and H4 residues 2–26 (32Ling X. Harkness T.A. Schultz M.C. Fisher-Adams G. Grunstein M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 686-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and H3 residues 4–30 and H4 residues 4–28 (33Morgan B.A. Mittman B.A. Smith M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4111-4420Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Histones are thought to be imported as heterodimers or heterotetramers, suggesting that the NLS signals are redundant as each complex will have two or four N-terminal tails. To test this we used the yeast strain JHY200 which bears deletions of both copies of each of the four core histones. The strain is supported by a plasmid pQQ18 that encodes one of each of the core histones. JHY200 grew similarly to its parental wild-type strain, W303, and will from hereon be referred to as wild type. To introduce mutations to the genes encoding histones H3 and H4 (HHT2 and HHF2, respectively) mutations were created in HHT2 and HHF2 in the context of pQQ18 and introduced into the wild type strain by plasmid shuffle. Loss of the H3 NLS (residues 4–30) had a very minor effect on cell growth compared with wild type (Fig. 2). Loss of the H4 NLS (residues 4–28) resulted in viable yeast; however, this strain had a strong growth defect compared with wild type (Fig. 2). These results demonstrated that neither the H3 nor the H4 NLS domains are essential for viability. They also suggested that either the H4 NLS domain had additional important functions in chromatin, or that the H3 N terminus was not a very efficient NLS. However our previous experiments suggest that H3 NLS has robust import activity in reporter assays (16Mosammaparast N. Guo Y. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Pemberton L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 862-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that an H3-NLS-GFP reporter is completely mislocalized in Δkap123 strain, suggesting that Kap123p plays a unique role in H3 import (16Mosammaparast N. Guo Y. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Pemberton L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 862-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We used the strain developed above to test whether Kap123p was necessary to support growth in strains that were reliant solely on the H3 NLS for H3/H4 import. Deletion of KAP123 alone resulted in a minor growth defect in the JHY200 strain background (Fig. 2). Deletion of KAP123 did not affect growth in strains dependent on the H4 NLS, suggesting that Kap123p was redundant with other Kaps for H4 import. However, deletion of KAP123 in cells dependent on the H3 NLS for H3-H4 import resulted in virtually no yeast recovered after 3 days of growth on 5-FOA containing plates at 30 °C, and only a small number of colonies were visible after longer incubation (Fig. 2 and data not shown). This suggests that H3 import is mediated by Kap123p alone. We also examined strains lacking Δkap119 and Δkap108 or with the kap121-34ts, in combination with either an H3 or H4 tail deletion, but saw no striking growth differences (data not shown). This suggests that in contrast to H3, H4 uses several import pathways into the nucleus. Amino Acid Residues within the NLS That Are Subject to Acetylation Are Essential in Vivo—We wanted to determine whether the specific lysines in the H3 and H4 NLS that can be acetylated were essential for viability. We therefore began by creating mutants in which lysines were altered to a charged non-acetylated residue (arginine) or an uncharged residue (glutamine; acetylation mimic). So that we could examine their individual contribution, we mutated the relevant lysines in the context of the one NLS, with the other NLS deleted. We first focused on the H3 NLS as less is known about this NLS, and mutated lysines 9, 14, and 18 to either glutamine or arginine in the context of a strain dependent on the H3 NLS for import. These lysines can all be acetylated prior to nucleosome incorporation, with Lys9 representing the residue most often acetylated (8Kuo M.H. Brownell J.E. Sobel R.E. Ranalli T.A. Cook R.G. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 1996; 383: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). We did not recover viable yeast after plasmid shuffle on 5-FOA plates suggesting that these lysines play an essential function in the absence of an H4 N terminus (Table 1). To determine which amino acids were important we also made the lysines 9, 14, or 18 single mutations, and in each case again recovered no viable yeast (Table 1). This suggests that in the absence of the H4 tail, these amino acids are necessary for viability, raising the possibility that one or more is involved in nuclear import.TABLE 1Viability of histone NLS mutantsHHT2HHF2ViabilitywtwtViablewtΔ4-28Reduced viabilityΔ4-30wtViableK9R/K14R/K18RΔ4-28Not recoverableaNot recoverable refers to the lack of growth on 5-FOA because of the inability to successfully shuffle in the LEU2 mutant plasmid.K9R/K14R/K18RwtViableK9Q/K14Q/K18QΔ4-28Not recoverableK9Q/K14Q/K18QwtViableK9RΔ4-28Not recoverableK9RwtViableK9QΔ4-28Not recoverableK9QwtViableK14RΔ4-28Not recoverableK14RwtViableK14QΔ4-28Not recoverableK14QwtViableK18RΔ4-28Not recoverableK18RwtViableK18"

It is also implicated in higher functions and diseases of human brain. However, whether or not secretion of Reelin is regulated and how Reelin transmits signals remain largely unknown. Reelin protein is composed of an N-terminal F-spondin-like domain, Reelin repeats, and a short and highly basic C-terminal region (CTR). The primary sequence of CTR is almost completely conserved among vertebrates except fishes, indicating its importance. A prevailing idea regarding the function of CTR is that it is required for the secretion of Reelin, although this remains unproven. Here we aimed to clarify the function of Reelin CTR. Neither deleting most of CTR nor replacing CTR with unrelated amino acids affected secretion efficiency, indicating that CTR is not absolutely required for the secretion of Reelin. We also found that Reelin mutants without CTR were less potent in activating the downstream signaling in cortical neurons. Although these mutants were able to bind to the Reelin receptor ectodomain as efficiently as wild-type Reelin, quite interestingly, their ability to bind to the isolated cell membrane bearing Reelin receptors or receptor-expressing cells (including cortical neurons) was much weaker than that of wild-type Reelin. Therefore, it is concluded that the CTR of Reelin is not essential for its secretion but is required for efficient activation of downstream signaling events, presumably via binding to an unidentified “co-receptor” molecule(s) on the cell membrane.

Nakajima K. Goldowitz D. Curran T. Development. 1998; 125: 3719-3729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the developing forebrain, Reelin is abundantly expressed in a special type of neuron called Cajal-Retzius cells in the marginal zone (10Ogawa M. Miyata T. Nakajima K. Yagyu K. Seike M. Ikenaka K.

It is widely believed that this particular localization is essential for proper function of Reelin, although this remains unproven and has been challenged by some recent studies (12Magdaleno S.

Development. 2006; 133: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Whether Reelin is a positional cue or a permissive factor (or something else) remains controversial (15Soriano E. Del Rio J.A. Neuron. 2005; 46: 389-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 16Luque J.M. Brain Res. 2007; 1140: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), partly because the molecular mechanism regulating the secretion and diffusion of Reelin is unknown. Reelin protein is divided into three subdomains: the N-terminal F-spondin-like domain that is necessary for oligomerization (17Utsunomiya-Tate N. Kubo K. Tate S. Kainosho M. Katayama E. Nakajima K. Mikoshiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9729-9734Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the eight tandems of Reelin repeats (RR), 2The abbreviations used are: RR, Reelin repeat; ApoER2, apolipoprotein E receptor 2; CTR, C-terminal region; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GH, growth hormone; VLDLR, very low density lipoprotein receptor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; WT, wild type; HEK, human embryonic kidney. and the short and highly basic C-terminal region (CTR) (1D'Arcangelo G. Miao G.G. Chen S.C. Soares H.D. Morgan J.I. Curran T. Nature. 1995; 374: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). The region between the third and sixth RR (RR3 and RR6, respectively) binds to Reelin receptors, very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and apolipoprotein receptor 2 (ApoER2) (18Jossin Y. Ignatova N. Hiesberger T. Herz J. Lambert de Rouvroit C. Goffinet A.M. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). CTR is 32 amino acids long, comprising less than 1% of the entire Reelin protein. Interestingly, in one of the murine Reelin mutants called Orleans, aberrant Reelin protein (ReelinOrl) lacking a part of the eighth RR (RR8) and CTR is produced, but it is not secreted and accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (19de Bergeyck V. Nakajima K. Lambert de Rouvroit C. Naerhuyzen B. Goffinet A.M. Miyata T. Ogawa M. Mikoshiba K. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 50: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 20Derer P. Derer M. Goffinet A. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 440: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition, an artificial Reelin mutant that terminates in the middle of RR8 was not secreted from transfected COS cells (21D'Arcangelo G. Nakajima K. Miyata T. Ogawa M. Mikoshiba K. Curran T. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 23-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations led to the widely accepted idea that CTR is required for Reelin secretion (22Rice D.S. Curran T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1005-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 23Fatemi S.H. Mol. Psychiatry. 2005; 10: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). On the contrary, an alternative polyadenylation can give rise to a truncated Reelin protein without the last 33 amino acids (24Lambert de Rouvroit C. Bernier B. Royaux I. de Bergeyck V. Goffinet A.M. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 156: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and this short form Reelin is secreted when overexpressed in COS cells, although its secretion efficacy is apparently much lower than that of the wild-type (full-length) Reelin (ReelinWT) (24Lambert de Rouvroit C. Bernier B. Royaux I. de Bergeyck V. Goffinet A.M. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 156: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The mRNA encoding the short form is expressed in similar (i.e. not exactly the same) cell types in developing mouse brain, suggesting it has a role distinct from that of ReelinWT (24Lambert de Rouvroit C. Bernier B. Royaux I. de Bergeyck V. Goffinet A.M. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 156: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, there is no evidence that the short form (CTR-less) Reelin is actually produced and secreted in vivo, and its specific function remains unexplored. Thus, three questions regarding Reelin CTR remain. First, is it really required for secretion? Second, is it required for any other physiological function? Third, if CTR plays any functional role, what is the molecular mechanism? Herein, we show that the CTR is not necessary for secretion but is required for efficient activation of downstream events. Animal Care—All of the experimental protocols used here were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Nagoya City University and were performed according to the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health of Japan. Expression Vectors—The definition and alignment of RR and CTR are determined according to the computerized matching reported by Ichihara et al. (25Ichihara H. Jingami H. Toh H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 97: 190-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The Reelin cDNA construct, pCrl (21D'Arcangelo G. Nakajima K. Miyata T. Ogawa M. Mikoshiba K. Curran T. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 23-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was used to express ReelinWT and as a template for PCR amplification. Expression vectors for ReelinOrl, ReelinΔC-mcs, ReelinFLAG+C, ReelinΔC-FLAG, ReelinΔC-Arg8, ReelinΔC-Glu8, ReelinΔC-Ala8, ReelinΔC-His8, and ReelinΔC-Venus were constructed in pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) (Invitrogen). ReelinΔC, ReelinRR4, ReelinRR5, ReelinRR6, ReelinRR7, ReelinRR8A, ReelinRR8E, and Reelin3441 were constructed on pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). ER-red fluorescent protein (DsRed2-KDEL) was described previously (26Bannai H. Inoue T. Nakayama T. Hattori M. Mikoshiba K. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Addition of green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the C-terminal region of ApoER2 (with the ligand-binding repeats 1–7) was performed using pEGFP-N1 (BD Biosciences). The expression vector for Golgi-targeted GFP was purchased from BD Biosciences. Detailed methods and maps of the expression vectors will be supplied on request. Antibodies—The mouse monoclonal anti-Reelin antibody G10 and rabbit polyclonal antibody anti-Dab1 were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). The mouse monoclonal anti-human growth hormone (GH) was a generous gift from Dr. J. Takagi (Institute of Protein Research, Osaka University). Biotinylated cholera toxin B was purchased from Sigma. Alexa 488- or Alexa 594-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Invitrogen. The mouse monoclonal anti-Reelin antibody CR-50 was described previously (10Ogawa M. Miyata T. Nakajima K. Yagyu K. Seike M. Ikenaka K. Yamamoto H. Mikoshiba K. Neuron. 1995; 14: 899-912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T, COS-7, and NIH-3T3 cells were plated onto 35-mm dishes in the presence of 1.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To collect Reelin-containing conditioned media, the culture medium was replaced with Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with antibiotics after 5 h of transfection and cultured for another 40 h. For immunocytochemistry, the culture medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum after 5 h of transfection and cultured for another 24–40 h. Primary Culture of Mouse Cortical Neurons—Primary cortical neurons were prepared from embryonic day 15 mice as described previously (27Morimura T. Hattori M. Ogawa M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16901-16908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In brief, cortical lobes were trypsinized for 5 min at 37 °C and dissociated using 0.1% DNase I (Roche). Neurons were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated 35-mm dishes or 12-well plates and maintained in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) containing B27 supplement (Invitrogen), penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Dab1 Phosphorylation Assay—Induced phosphorylation of Dab1 in mouse cortical neurons was measured essentially as previously described (27Morimura T. Hattori M. Ogawa M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16901-16908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, cortical neuronal cells were incubated with Reelin-containing media for 20 min at 37 °C, lysed, and immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-Dab1 antibody. Samples were analyzed by Western blotting using 4G10 first, and then reprobed with anti-Dab1 antibody. Western Blotting—Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (5 and 7.5% acrylamide gel for Reelin and Dab1, respectively) or native PAGE without SDS (17Utsunomiya-Tate N. Kubo K. Tate S. Kainosho M. Katayama E. Nakajima K. Mikoshiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9729-9734Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and transferred to a polyvinyldene difluoride membrane. Blotted filters were incubated with the first antibody, washed with Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20, incubated with the peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, washed, and then visualized with an ECL system (GE Healthcare). Images were captured using a LAS3000 system (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). Images were analyzed with Image J software (version 1.34s, National Institutes of Health). The area of each blot was enclosed, and the total intensity of chemical luminosity was calculated using the following formula: area × (mean intensity - background near the band). The intensity from results using 4G10 was divided by that of anti-Dab1, and normalized with control intensity. The significance of differences between means was determined by one-way analysis of variance and Tukey's test for multiple pairwise comparisons. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Unless otherwise specified, all data are given as mean ± S.E. from six independent experiments. Immunocytochemistry—Primary cortical neurons or COS-7 cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were incubated with the indicated primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature, washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with the fluorescent secondary antibody for 2 h, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline four times and with water twice. Samples were examined with an LSM510 confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss Japan, Tokyo, Japan). Binding of Reelin to the Ligand Binding Domain of ApoER2—Reelin-containing supernatants were incubated with GH-ApoER2LBD (GH fusion of ligand binding repeats 1–3 and 7 of ApoER2, a generous gift from Prof. J. Takagi, Osaka University), anti-GH antibody and protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at 4°C, washed with HBAH buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% (w/v) NaN3, and 20 mm HEPES) four times, and suspended in SDS-PAGE sampling buffer, followed by Western blotting analysis. Binding of Reelin to Cell Membrane—ApoER2-GFP-expressing HEK293T cells were collected with 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA and triturated with a 27-gauge needle. The lysates were centrifuged at 700 × g for 3 min to remove debris, and the supernatant was then collected, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min to obtain the membrane fraction. The membrane fraction was then incubated with Reelin-containing conditioned media for 1 h at 4 °C, washed with HBAH buffer 4 times, dissolved with SDS-PAGE sampling buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting. To block nonspecific binding, the assay tubes and the membrane fraction were incubated with 10% bovine serum albumin prior to addition of Reelin-containing media. CTR of Reelin Is Highly Conserved at Both the Nucleotide and Amino Acid Levels—Among 32 amino acid residues of CTR, 12 (38%) are basic (circled in Fig. 1A), whereas none are acidic (Fig. 1A). The primary sequence of CTR is extraordinarily conserved: it is completely (100%) conserved among all mammals whose Reelin sequence can be found in the available databases: namely, human, chimpanzee, macaque, dog, mouse, rat, cow, and gray short-tailed opossum. It is also perfectly conserved in chickens and turtles (Fig. 1A). In the crocodile, all but the first one is conserved (Fig. 1A). This prominent conservation is also observed in the DNA sequence encoding CTR: 91 of 99 (92%) nucleotide residues are conserved among all of the species listed in Fig. 1A, for example. From the evolutionary point of view, this observation strongly suggests that CTR has an essential physiological function(s) in the land vertebrates. As it is a prevailing idea that CTR is required for Reelin secretion, we first compared the secretion efficiency of ReelinWT, ReelinOrl, and mutant Reelin lacking only CTR (ReelinΔC) in HEK293T cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, ReelinWT was efficiently secreted, whereas no ReelinOrl was secreted in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1B, left panel, lanes 1 and 2, respectively). These results were consistent with the previous report (19de Bergeyck V. Nakajima K. Lambert de Rouvroit C. Naerhuyzen B. Goffinet A.M. Miyata T. Ogawa M. Mikoshiba K. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 50: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ReelinΔC was secreted (Fig. 1B, left panel, lane 3), although its amount was less abundant than that of ReelinWT. It was also observed that ReelinΔC accumulates to a greater extent in the cell fraction than ReelinWT or ReelinOrl (Fig. 1B, right panel). These results were also observed in COS-7 cells (Fig. 1C), suggesting that it is not a cell type-specific event. We also expressed a truncated Reelin mutant that terminated just after RR7 (ReelinRR7) and found that it was secreted (Fig. 1D, lane 1). In fact, other Reelin-truncated mutants with complete Reelin repeats (ReelinRR4, ReelinRR5, and ReelinRR6) were also secreted (Fig. 1E, lanes 2–4, respectively). On the other hand, truncated mutants that terminated after subrepeats RR8A or RR8E (ReelinRR8A and ReelinRR8E, respectively (25Ichihara H. Jingami H. Toh H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 97: 190-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)) were not secreted (Fig. 1D, lanes 2 and 3, respectively). The same phenomenon was observed when NIH-3T3 cells were used (Fig. 1F), indicating its universality. These results suggested that truncation in the middle of RR leads to total failure of secretion and that CTR is not absolutely required for secretion. However, as ReelinΔC is less efficiently secreted than ReelinWT, it remains possible that CTR plays some role in facilitating secretion. We next compared intracellular localization of ReelinWT, ReelinOrl, and ReelinΔC. For this analysis, COS-7 cells were chosen as its flat and spreading shape makes it easier for us to observe intracellular organelles, especially ER. ReelinWT was found mainly in the ER and presumably in secretory vesicles (Fig. 2, A–C). ReelinOrl was also localized in the ER but, in comparison to ReelinWT, it tended to accumulate more around the nucleus (Fig. 2, D–F). This was consistent with a previous report that ReelinOrl accumulates in the rough ER in Cajal-Retzius cells (20Derer P. Derer M. Goffinet A. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 440: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was strongly suggested that ReelinOrl (and possibly other truncated mutants that terminate in the middle of RR) is unable to go beyond the ER in its secretory pathway. Unexpectedly, ReelinΔC showed quite different localization from ReelinWT or ReelinOrl. It accumulated in cells as characteristic tubular structures (Fig. 2G). These structures were observed only when ReelinΔC was expressed, and were positive for ER markers (Fig. 2H). Their appearance and amount was unaffected by brefeldin A treatment (Fig. 2, J–M), indicating that they are dilated ER (-like structures) induced by ReelinΔC accumulation. These results were also obtained in 293T and NIH-3T3 cells (supplementary Fig. S1). It was thus indicated that ReelinOrl and ReelinΔC have distinct intracellular fates in the secretory pathway, and thus support the idea that lack of CTR is not directly responsible for the secretion failure of ReelinOrl. The Highly Conserved Structure of CTR Is Not Required for Reelin Secretion—To further investigate the role of CTR in Reelin secretion, we expressed a series of mutant Reelin proteins having either a truncated or an unrelated sequence in place of CTR (Fig. 3A). The secretion efficiency was measured by Western blotting using the culture supernatant and cell fraction from HEK293T cells. Reelin3441 lacking the last 20 amino acids (i.e. without 10 of the 12 basic residues) of CTR was secreted as efficiently as ReelinWT (Fig. 3, B and C, lanes 1 and 3), indicating that the first 12 amino acids is sufficient for secretion facilitation, whereas the region of highly positive charges is not necessary. We next added FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK), which is rather acidic, in place of CTR (ReelinΔC-FLAG). Quite unexpectedly, ReelinΔC-FLAG was secreted as efficiently as ReelinWT (Fig. 3, B and C, lane 4). We also measured the secretion efficiency of Reelin mutants that have a tandem of the same amino acids (ReelinΔC-Glu8, ReelinΔC-Arg8, ReelinΔC-Ala8, and ReelinΔC-His8). Among them, ReelinΔC-Glu8 and ReelinΔC-Arg8 were efficiently secreted (Fig. 3, B and C, lanes 5 and 6, respectively) but the other two were not (Fig. 3, B and C, lanes 8 and 9). Interestingly, the secretion efficiency of ReelinΔC-Venus (Venus is a variant of yellow fluorescent protein with 239 amino acids (28Nagai T. Ibata K. Park E.S. Kubota M. Mikoshiba K. Miyawaki A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (2197) Google Scholar)) was no less than that of ReelinWT (Fig. 3, B and C, lane 7). ReelinΔC-mcs, which had five amino acids derived from multicloning sites, was not efficiently secreted (Fig. 3, B and C, lane 10). Insertion of FLAG tag between RR8 and CTR (ReelinFLAG+C) had little effect on secretion efficiency (Fig. 3, B and C, lane 11). Similarly, in NIH3T3 cells, ReelinΔC and ReelinΔC-Ala8 were barely secreted (Fig. 3D, lanes 2 and 5, respectively), whereas ReelinΔC-FLAG and ReelinΔC-Glu8 were quite effectively secreted (Fig. 3D, lanes 3 and 4, respectively). These results clearly indicate that the highly conserved CTR primary sequence is not attributable to it playing a role in Reelin secretion. Most notably, the highly basic nature of CTR was not required for secretion. The CTR Is Necessary for Efficient Induction of Dab1 Phosphorylation in Cortical Neurons—The fact that most of the CTR is necessary for secretion prompted us to investigate the physiological function of the CTR. The phosphorylation of intracellular adaptor protein Dab1 is a widely accepted indication of Reelin signaling activation (2Tissir F. Goffinet A.M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 496-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 3Herz J. Chen Y. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 850-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The primary cortical neurons from embryonic mice were stimulated either with conditioned media containing ReelinWT or mutant Reelin protein, and the Dab1 phosphorylation level was measured by Western blotting. ReelinWT induced robust Dab1 phosphorylation (Fig. 4A, lane 2), whereas ReelinΔC-FLAG, ReelinΔC-Glu8, and ReelinΔC-Venus were much less potent (Fig. 4A, lanes 4–6, respectively). Interestingly, ReelinFLAG+C induced Dab1 phosphorylation only weakly, whereas ReelinΔC-Arg8 was moderately active (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 7, respectively). These results highlight three important points. First, CTR is necessary for efficient activation of downstream signaling. Second, CTR must be located just after RR8 to have full activity. Third, the highly basic nature of CTR contributes to its facilitating effect on downstream activation. As oligomerization of Reelin is prerequisite for Dab1 phosphorylation (17Utsunomiya-Tate N. Kubo K. Tate S. Kainosho M. Katayama E. Nakajima K. Mikoshiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9729-9734Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 29Kubo K. Mikoshiba K. Nakajima K. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 43: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we investigated whether CTR affects dimer formation and oligomerization of Reelin. SDS-PAGE without a reducing reagent, which is able to evaluate dimer formation of Reelin (29Kubo K. Mikoshiba K. Nakajima K. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 43: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), revealed that ReelinWT, ReelinFLAG+C, and ReelinΔC-FLAG form dimers to the same extent (Fig. 4C). We also performed native PAGE analysis (17Utsunomiya-Tate N. Kubo K. Tate S. Kainosho M. Katayama E. Nakajima K. Mikoshiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9729-9734Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) to evaluate the oligomerization state and found no clear difference between ReelinWT and ReelinΔC-FLAG (Fig. 4D). These results suggested that CTR is not involved in oligomerization of Reelin. Reelin CTR Augments Binding Affinity between Reelin and Its Receptor on the Cell Membrane—Binding of Reelin to either ApoER2 or VLDLR is essential for induction of Dab1 phosphorylation (30D'Arcangelo G. Homayouni R. Keshvara L. Rice D.S. Sheldon M. Curran T. Neuron. 1999; 24: 471-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 31Hiesberger T. Trommsdorff M. Howell B.W. Goffinet A. Mumby M.C. Cooper J.A. Herz J. Neuron. 1999; 24: 481-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). We thus investigated whether deletion of CTR affects Reelin binding to these receptors. First, we employed the recombinant ligand-binding domain of ApoER2 fused to human GH (GH-ApoER2LBD) to pull down Reelin (Fig. 5A). Conditioned media containing either ReelinWT or ReelinΔC-FLAG were mixed with GH-ApoER2LBD, anti-GH, and protein G-Sepharose, and the precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting. Control experiments were performed without GH-ApoER2LBD. As shown in Fig. 5C, no difference was observed between ReelinWT and ReelinΔC-FLAG, indicating that CTR is not directly involved in the interaction between Reelin and its receptors. This was consistent with previous reports (18Jossin Y. Ignatova N. Hiesberger T. Herz J. Lambert de Rouvroit C. Goffinet A.M. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) that the region from RR3 to RR6 was sufficient for the ectodomain of ApoER2 or VLDLR. We next performed similar experiments using membrane fractions isolated from HEK293T cells expressing full-length ApoER2-GFP (Fig. 5B). The results were quite surprising: ReelinWT bound much more strongly (or more stably) to the receptor-bearing cell membrane than ReelinΔC-FLAG (Fig. 5D, lanes 9 and 10, respectively). ReelinFLAG+C and ReelinΔC-Arg8 bound to the receptor-bearing cell membrane more weakly than ReelinWT but slightly more strongly than ReelinΔC-FLAG (Fig. 5D, lanes 11 and 12, respectively). Thus, CTR apparently augments or stabilizes the interaction between Reelin and Reelin receptors on the cell membrane, and this effect is partly, but not solely, mediated by the positive charge of CTR. We next investigated binding of Reelin to COS-7 cells expressing ApoER2-GFP. Cells were incubated either with ReelinWT or ReelinΔC-FLAG, fixed, and immunostained with anti-Reelin antibody without permeabilization (to detect cell surface but not internalized Reelin). ReelinWT bound to the surface of ApoER2-GFP-expressing COS-7 cells in a rather punctate fashion (Fig. 6, A–C). This binding was dependent on ApoER2-GFP because virtually no staining was observed in control GFP-expressing COS-7 cells (Fig. 6, G and H), COS-7 cells express no Reelin receptors (27Morimura T. Hattori M. Ogawa M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16901-16908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar)). On the other hand, binding of ReelinΔC-FLAG to ApoER2-GFP-expressing COS-7 cells was barely detectable (Fig. 6, D–F). Consistent with the pull-down experiments using isolated cell membrane (Fig"
https://openalex.org/W1994132314,"A challenging goal in biology is to understand how the principal cellular functions are integrated so that cells achieve viability and optimal fitness in a wide range of nutritional conditions.We report here a tight link between glycolysis and DNA synthesis. The link, discovered during an analysis of suppressors of thermosensitive replication mutants in bacterium Bacillus subtilis, is very strong as some metabolic alterations fully restore viability to replication mutants in which a lethal arrest of DNA synthesis otherwise occurs at a high, restrictive, temperature. Full restoration of viability by such alterations was limited to cells with mutations in three elongation factors (the lagging strand DnaE polymerase, the primase and the helicase) out of a large set of thermosensitive mutants affected in most of the replication proteins. Restoration of viability resulted, at least in part, from maintenance of replication protein activity at high temperature. Physiological studies suggested that this restoration depended on the activity of the three-carbon part of the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway and occurred in both glycolytic and gluconeogenic regimens. Restoration took place abruptly over a narrow range of expression of genes in the three-carbon part of glycolysis. However, the absolute value of this range varied greatly with the allele in question. Finally, restoration of cell viability did not appear to be the result of a decrease in growth rate or an induction of major stress responses.Our findings provide the first evidence for a genetic system that connects DNA chain elongation to glycolysis. Its role may be to modulate some aspect of DNA synthesis in response to the energy provided by the environment and the underlying mechanism is discussed. It is proposed that related systems are ubiquitous."
https://openalex.org/W1966464508,"Serotonin (5-HT) stimulates smooth muscle cell growth through 5-HT receptors and the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT), and has been associated with pulmonary hypertension (PH). Platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR) have also been associated with PH. We present evidence for the first time that 5-HT transactivates PDGFRbeta through the 5-HTT in pulmonary artery (PA) SMCs. Inhibition of PDGFR kinase with imatinib or AG1296 blocks 5-HT-stimulated PDGFRbeta phosphorylation. 5-HTT inhibitors and the Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitor ouabain, but not 5-HT2 and 5-HT1B/1D receptor inhibitors, block PDGFRbeta activation by 5-HT. Notably, 5-HTT binds the PDGFRbeta upon 5-HT stimulation and the 5-HTT inhibitor fluoxetine blocks both the binding and PDGDRbeta activation. Activation of PDGFRbeta may occur through oxidation of a catalytic cysteine of tyrosine phosphatase. 5-HT-activated PDGFRbeta phosphorylation is blocked by the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine and the NADPH oxidase inhibitor, DPI. Inhibition of PDGFR kinase with imatinib or AG1296 significantly inhibits SMC proliferation and migration induced by 5-HT in vitro. Infusion of 5-HT by miniosmotic pumps enhances PDGFRbeta activation in mouse lung in vivo. In summary, these results demonstrate that 5-HT transactivates PDGFRbeta in PASMCs leading to SMC proliferation and migration, and may be an important signaling pathway in the production of PH in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2008468263,"Matrilins are oligomeric extracellular matrix adaptor proteins mediating interactions between collagen fibrils and other matrix constituents. All four matrilins are expressed in cartilage and mutations in the human gene encoding matrilin-3 (MATN3) are associated with different forms of chondrodysplasia. Surprisingly, however, Matn3-null as well as Matn1- and Matn2-null mice do not show an overt skeletal phenotype, suggesting a dominant negative pathomechanism for the human disorders and redundancy/compensation among the family members in the knock-out situation. Here, we show that mice lacking both matrilin-1 and matrilin-3 develop an apparently normal skeleton, but exhibit biochemical and ultrastructural abnormalities of the knee joint cartilage. At the protein level, an altered SDS-PAGE band pattern and a clear up-regulation of the homotrimeric form of matrilin-4 were evident in newborn Matn1/Matn3 and Matn1 knock-out mice, but not in Matn3-null mice. The ultrastructure of the cartilage matrix after conventional chemical fixation was grossly normal; however, electron microscopy of high pressure frozen and freeze-substituted samples, revealed two consistent observations: 1) moderately increased collagen fibril diameters throughout the epiphysis and the growth plate in both single and double mutants; and 2) increased collagen volume density in Matn1-/-/Matn3-/- and Matn3-/- mice. Taken together, our results demonstrate that matrilin-1 and matrilin-3 modulate collagen fibrillogenesis in cartilage and provide evidence that biochemical compensation might exist between matrilins."
https://openalex.org/W2088461960,"We describe two RING finger proteins in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Rfp1 and Rfp2. We show that these proteins function redundantly in DNA repair. Rfp1 was isolated as a Chk1-interacting protein in a two-hybrid screen and has high amino acid sequence similarity to Rfp2. Deletion of either gene does not cause a phenotype, but a double deletion (rfp1Δrfp2Δ) showed poor viability and defects in cell cycle progression. These cells are also sensitive to DNA-damaging agents, although they maintained normal checkpoint signaling to Chk1. Rfp1 and Rfp2 are most closely related to human Rnf4, and we showed that Rnf4 can substitute functionally for Rfp1 and/or Rfp2. The double mutants also showed significantly increased levels of protein SUMOylation, and we identified an S. pombe Ulp2/Smt4 homolog that, when overexpressed, reduced SUMO levels and suppressed the DNA damage sensitivity of rfp1Δ rfp2Δ cells.

The fidelity of cell cycle progression is paramount for tissue homeostasis and development and avoidance of disease. A major contributor to this fidelity are the plethora of responses that detect damage to DNA, ensure its repair, and activate checkpoints that modify the cell cycle to allow time for these events to occur. These responses are rapid, highly conserved, and frequently regulated by cascades of post-translational modifications that control the activities of repair proteins and signal transducers of the checkpoints. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is an important model system for the dissection of the molecular controls over DNA damage responses (1O'Connell M.J. Walworth N.C. Carr A.M.

Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 227-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The DNA damage checkpoint functioning during this period signals to activate the Chk1 protein kinase, which in turn prevents entry into mitosis through modulating the Cdc2 regulators Wee1 and Cdc25 (4Raleigh J.M.

Among these are the covalent modification of proteins by ubiquitin and its related protein, SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier). In addition to directing the proteolysis of its targets, ubiquitination can directly influence responses to DNA damage. A well documented example of this is through the post-replication repair proteins that control the mono- and polyubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, which in turn enables the bypass of lesions during DNA replication (11Friedberg E.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 12Frampton J. Irmisch A. Green C.M. Neiss A. Trickey M. Ulrich H.D. Furuya K. Watts F.Z. Carr A.M. Lehmann A.R.

Control over protein SUMOylation is achieved by a balance of the activity of several E3-SUMO ligases and the deconjugating activity of SUMO peptidases such as Ulp2/Smt4 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. SUMO is not essential in S. pombe, although cells deleted for the SUMO gene (pmt3) (15Tanaka K. Nishide J. Okazaki K. Kato H. Niwa O. Nakagawa T. Matsuda H. Kawamukai M. Murakami Y. Mol. Cell.

Two-hybrid Screening—Chk1 was cloned onto the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (pAS2) and transformed into the PJ69A strain of S. cerevisiae (26James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An S. pombe cDNA Gal4 activation domain fusion library in pACT (a kind gift of Steve Elledge) was transformed into these cells, and putative interactors were screened for on SC medium lacking adenine. Plasmids were recovered into Escherichia coli, sequenced, and retested for bait dependence. Fission Yeast Methods—All strains are derivates of 972h– and 975h+. Standard methods and media for the propagation, transformation, mating, and culturing of S. pombe were as described (27Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3143) Google Scholar). Null alleles were constructed by Start-Stop codon replacement by ura4 by homologous recombination. Gene targeting was confirmed by Southern blotting, and strains were back-crossed to wild type before analysis. Microscopy was performed on cells fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde or 70% ethanol, and images were captured on a Nikon Eclipse 800 microscope with a Spot RT/SE camera. Immunodetection of proteins in fixed cells was performed as previously described (28Krien M.J. Bugg S.J. Palatsides M. Asouline G. Morimyo M. O'Connell M.J. J.

The methods used for UV-C and methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) 2The abbreviations used are: MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; HA, hemagglutinin; HR, homologous recombination; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. survival assays were as described previously (30Verkade H.M.

Genet. 1998; 260: 426-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, for UV-C, exponential cultures were plated in triplicate at densities of 100–10,000 cells/plate and irradiated with UV-C using a Stratalinker (Stratagene). Colonies were allowed to form over a 4-day span at 30 °C and were normalized to unirradiated controls. For MMS sensitivity, 10-fold serial dilutions were spotted onto plates containing a range of MMS concentrations, and colonies were allowed to form over a 4-day span at 30 °C. Plasmid curing was achieved by selection of relief for auxotrophic markers on YES medium (yeast extract plus supplements) followed by reselection of minimal medium. To avoid selection for extragenic, slow growth suppressors, all experiments with rfp1Δ rfp2Δ double mutants were performed with freshly made strains derived from nonparental ditypes. Protein Extraction and Western Blotting—Proteins were extracted from cell pellets disrupted with glass beads and a mini-bead beater. Native extracts for immunoprecipitations were performed as described (9den Elzen N.R. O'Connell M.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 908-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Denatured extracts for SUMO conjugates were made using 8 m urea buffer (5O'Connell M.J. Raleigh J.M. Verkade H.M. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Pmt3 (SUMO) was detected using an HA-tagged pmt3 allele (15Tanaka K. Nishide J. Okazaki K. Kato H. Niwa O. Nakagawa T. Matsuda H. Kawamukai M. Murakami Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8660-8672Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Anti-α-tubulin antibody B-5 (Sigma) was used as a loading control. Western transfer of SDS-polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose was performed with 10 mm CAPS, 10% methanol. Immune complexes were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were detected with ECL reagent (GE Biosciences). Chk1 activity assays were performed in triplicate as described (32Harvey S.H. Sheedy D.M. Cuddihy A.R. O'Connell M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 662-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 33Latif C. Elzen N.R. O'Connell M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3489-3498Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recombinant Proteins and Chk1 Kinase Assays—Recombinant glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were expressed in BL-21 E. coli and purified on GSH-Sepharose as described (34Calonge T.M. O'Connell M.J. Genetics. 2006; 174: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of these proteins by Chk1 purified from S. pombe extracts was performed as described (8Capasso H. Palermo C. Wan S. Rao H. John U.P. O'Connell M.J. Walworth N.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4555-4564Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 32Harvey S.H. Sheedy D.M. Cuddihy A.R. O'Connell M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 662-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Identification of Chk1-interacting Proteins—To search for Chk1-interacting proteins we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using full-length Chk1 fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain as bait. Among several positive clones (Table 1) were rad24 and ded1, which have been described previously as Chk1 interactors by this assay (35Chen L. Liu T.H. Walworth N.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 36Liu H.Y. Nefsky B.S. Walworth N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2637-2643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Among the unique clones was a novel 254-amino acid protein (SPAC19A8.10) with a C-terminal RING finger domain, which we called Rfp1. Using N- and C-terminal Chk1 baits, Rfp1 was shown to interact with the C-terminal regulatory domain of Chk1 (Fig. 1A). The interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of Chk1 and Rfp1 expressed from the medium-strength attenuated nmt1 promoter (37Maundrell K. Gene. 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). However, under endogenous expression conditions, no such interaction could be observed (data not shown). Thus, the interaction in the yeast two-hybrid assay may not be physiological, although we could not rule out a transient interaction, which would be difficult to detect.TABLE 1Proteins identified by yeast two-hybrid interaction with S. pombe Chk1GeneNo. of isolatesNull phenotype/Commentrad243Null is defective in DNA damage checkpoint; 14-3-3 proteinSPCC613.033Null has no phenotype; contains EF-hand domainDed12Essential general translation factorrfp11See text; RING finger domainCek11Not essential, suppressor of cut8; protein kinaseSPAC19A8.121Null is lethal; Nudix protein similar to S. cerevisiae DCP2 Open table in a new tab Rfp1 Acts Redundantly with Rfp2 in DNA Repair—As we could not detect interaction between endogenous Chk1 and Rfp1, we sought to uncover function for Rfp1 to gauge the physiological relevance of the yeast two-hybrid interaction. The chromosomal rfp1 locus was deleted and replaced by ura4. These cells grew normally, were fertile, and showed wild-type sensitivities to DNA-damaging agents. We concluded that rfp1 is, by itself, not essential for cell viability. A BLAST search revealed that Rfp1 was most similar to mammalian Rnf4 proteins and to a 205-amino acid fission yeast RING finger-containing protein (SPAC343.18), which we denoted as Rfp2 (Fig. 2A). The rfp2 locus was also deleted and replaced by ura4. These cells also grew normally, were fertile, and showed wild-type sensitivities to DNA-damaging agents. We made rfp1Δrfp2Δ double mutants by tetrad dissection and found that double mutant colonies were severely growth-inhibited (Fig. 2B), forming small colonies that were prone to selection for slow growth suppressors. S. pombe grows by apical extension of cell tips, and a delay to cell cycle progression manifests as cells dividing at an increased cell length. Microscopic analysis showed that the rfp1Δrfp2Δ double mutants were delayed in cell cycle progression, dividing at 23.2 ± 6.5 μm compared with wild type, which divided at 13.8 ± 0.2 μm (Fig. 2D). By immunofluorescence, HA-tagged Rfp1 was localized to the nucleus (Fig. 2C). We have not been able to detect Rfp2 by Western blotting or immunofluorescence, even when expressed from the strongest nmt1 promoter, and we could not detect an interaction between Chk1 and Rfp2 by two-hybrid assays (data not shown). The poor growth and cell cycle delay of the rfp1Δrfp2Δ double mutants is reminiscent of strains deleted for genes involved in homologous recombination (HR). We therefore assayed DNA damage sensitivities of rfp1Δrfp2Δ double mutants and controls (Fig. 3). rfp1Δrfp2Δ double mutants were indeed sensitive to UV-C irradiation (Fig. 3A) and chronic exposure to the alkylating agent MMS (Fig. 3B). Both of these agents induce a Chk1-dependent DNA damage checkpoint and, at the doses tested, require HR for their repair in S. pombe. Inappropriate entry into mitosis with damaged DNA due to a Chk1-dependent checkpoint defect in S. pombe results in the bisection of the nucleus by the medial septum, known as the “cut” phenotype. Conversely, imposition of a Chk1-dependent check-point delay in response to DNA damage results in elongated cells, and even though the nuclear cell cycle is delayed by thus check-point, cell growth continues. UV-C-irradiated or MMS-treated rfp1Δrfp2Δ double mutants elongated further compared with untreated cells (Fig. 3C), showing an intact checkpoint response emanating from signaling downstream of Chk1. This was confirmed biochemically via the phosphorylation and activation of Chk1 (Fig. 3D), showing that signaling upstream of Chk1 to activate Chk1 activity was also intact. These data suggest that the rfp1Δrfp2Δ double mutants are defective in DNA repair, which is most likely because of an HR defect. However, the poor viability of the rfp1Δrfp2Δ double mutants and of HR mutants such as rhp51Δ and rad22Δ (encoding homologs of Rad51 and Rad52), together with the high rate of spontaneous slow growth suppressors, precluded epistasis to confirm a role in HR. We concluded that Rfp1 and Rfp2 act redundantly in DNA repair and that the poor viability of the rfp1Δrfp2Δ double mutant is due to the inability to process spontaneous lesions as seen in S. pombe HR mutants. We did not see a defect in Chk1 activation, nor did we see a checkpoint defect downstream of Chk1 signaling, as the rfp1Δrfp2Δ double mutant was proficient in a DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest. We cannot rule out the possibility that Chk1 acts upstream of Rfp1 and/or Rfp2 to affect DNA repair, but several observations are not consistent with this option. Firstly, the radiation sensitivity of S. pombe cells lacking Chk1 is restored by an imposed cell cycle delay using a conditional mutation in the Cdc25 phosphatase required for Cdc2 activation (38Walworth N. Davey S. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 363: 368-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 39Al-Khodairy F. Fotou E. Sheldrick K.S. Griffiths D.J.F. Lehman A.R. Carr A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar); that is, given the time to repair, chk1Δ cells are fully capable of doing so. This protocol does not rescue the radiation sensitivity of mutants defective in DNA repair (30Verkade H.M. Bugg S.J. Lindsay H.D. Carr A.M. O'Connell M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2905-2918Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 40Al-Khodairy F. Carr A.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1343-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Moreover, HR mutants, such as the rfp1Δrfp2Δ double mutant, show poor cell viability, chromosome instability, and poor spore viability, and none of these phenotypes are seen in chk1Δ cells. In S. cerevisiae, direct assays of DNA gap repair, which is via HR, have shown wild-type repair efficiencies in chk1Δ cells (41Haghnazari E. Heyer W.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4257-4268Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This is in keeping with their lack of radiation sensitivity (42Sanchez Y. Bachant J. Wang H. Hu F. Liu D. Tetzlaff M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), although these cells do show a higher frequency of crossovers for unknown reasons (41Haghnazari E. Heyer W.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4257-4268Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, Chk1 function following DNA damage is primarily to delay the cell cycle to allow time for DNA repair rather than being required directly for DNA repair itself. We also tested whether Rfp1 was a substrate for Chk1 phosphorylation (Rfp2 protein expression could not be detected). When Chk1 is overexpressed, the phosphorylation of Wee1 results in a mobility shift assayed by Western blotting (5O'Connell M.J. Raleigh J.M. Verkade H.M. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), but this was not the case for Rfp1 (Fig. 3E). A consensus site for Chk1-mediated phosphorylation has been determine as ϕ-X-β-X-X-(S/T)*, where an asterisk indicates the phosphorylated residue, ϕ is a hydrophobic residue (M > I > L > V), β is a basic residue (R > K), and X is any amino acid (43Hutchins J.R. Hughes M. Clarke P.R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Rfp2 has no sequences related to this motif, but Rfp1 has one potential site (LTRSPS-22). We assayed the phosphorylation of recombinant Rfp1 in vitro and of a mutant protein where Ser-22 was substituted for alanine. Neither protein was significantly phosphorylated, whereas a fragment of Wee1 containing phosphorylation sites at Ser-104 and Ser-117 (43Hutchins J.R. Hughes M. Clarke P.R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) was efficiently phosphorylated (Fig. 3F). It is possible that the recombinant Rfp1 is improperly folded, but the lack of in vitro phosphorylation is consistent with the lack of mobility shift in cells overexpressing Chk1. Thus, if Chk1 is regulating Rfp1, this effect is likely to be indirect. Human Rnf4 Functionally Rescues rfp1Δrfp2Δ—A BLAST search identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase Rnf4 as the most related human sequence to Rfp1 and Rfp2. To test conservation of function, we cloned human Rnf4 onto the S. pombe nmt1 promoter and expressed Rnf4 in wild type and rfp1Δrfp2Δ double mutants. Fig. 4 shows that RNf4 expression rescued the UV-C sensitivity (Fig. 4A), MMS sensitivity (Fig. 4B), and cell cycle delay phenotypes (Fig. 4C) of rfp1Δrfp2Δ double mutants. To ensure that this was indeed functional rescue and not the selection of suppressors (which are common with the rfp1Δrfp2Δ double mutant), we cured rfp1Δrfp2Δ double mutants of the nmt1-Rnf4 plasmid and indeed recovered each phenotype (data not shown). We conclude that Rnf4 functionally rescued the defects caused by deletion of either rfp1 and/or rfp2. Together with the sequence similarity, these data show that these proteins are therefore homologs, although no DNA repair function has been ascribed to Rnf4. rfp1Δrfp2Δ Cells Accumulate SUMOylated Proteins—Ring finger domains are characteristic of E3 ubiquitin ligases, and related domains are involved in the ligation of ubiquitin-like proteins such as SUMO. We assayed for ubiquitin- and SUMO-conjugated proteins in denatured extracts in rfp1Δ, rfp2Δ, and rfp1Δrfp2Δ double mutants by Western blotting. We found that the rfp1Δrfp2Δ double mutants had vastly increased levels of SUMOylated proteins (Fig. 5, compare lanes 2 (wild type) and 5 (rfp1Δrfp2Δ)), although ubiqutination was unaffected (data not shown). This was not evident in either of the single mutants or in UV-C-irradiated or G2-arrested wild-type cells, which we tested given the cell cycle delay and DNA repair defects in these cells. Rfp1 and Rfp2 are therefore negative regulators of protein SUMOylation. DNA Repair Defects in rfp1Δrfp2Δ Cells Is Due to Deregulated SUMOylation—We next wished to address whether the increase in SUMO conjugates in rfp1Δrfp2Δ double mutants was the cause of the DNA repair defects. Although SUMO is not essential in S. pombe, cells deleted for the SUMO gene (pmt3) are extremely sick, and it was not feasible to construct pmt3Δrfp1Δrfp2Δ triple mutants. As an alternative approach to dampening SUMOylation in rfp1Δrfp2Δ double mutants, we overproduced Ulp2 (SPAC17A5.07), which encodes a putative homolog of the S. cerevisiae SUMO-deconjugating peptidase Ulp2/Smt4. Expression of Ulp2 from the nmt1 promoter did not affect wild-type cell viability, although it did decrease the levels of SUMO conjugates in both wild-type and rfp1Δrfp2Δ cells (Fig. 6A). For the latter, the reduction in SUMO conjugates also suppressed the sensitivity to UV-C irradiation (Fig. 6B). We conclude that the DNA repair defects that manifested in the absence of Rfp1 and Rfp2 were due to the increased protein SUMOylation. The coordination of DNA repair with cell cycle progression is essential to maintaining genome integrity. Here we have described two new components of the DNA damage response in S. pombe, Rfp1 and Rfp2. Cells tolerate the deletion of either gene without consequence, but the double deletion shows defects in cell cycle progression and is sensitive to DNA-damaging agents. The synthetic nature of these phenotypes suggests that Rfp1 and Rfp2 have cellular functions that are redundant or at least overlapping. Based on the normal activation of the DNA damage checkpoint in these cells, we concluded that the sensitivity is due to a DNA repair defect. Expression of human Rnf4 fully rescued the phenotypes of the rfp1Δ rfp2Δ cells. Given that these phenotypes require the deletion of both genes, we cannot formally determine whether Rnf4 is functioning as Rfp1, Rfp2, or a combination of the two. Rnf4 contains both DNA binding and E3 ubiquitin ligase activities (21Hakli M. Karvonen U. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23653-23660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 25Hakli M. Lorick K.L. Weissman A.M. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. FEBS Lett. 2004; 560: 56-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and has been shown to interact with several transcription factors that are not conserved in S. pombe, including the androgen (24Pero R. Lembo F. Palmieri E.A. Vitiello C. Fedele M. Fusco A. Bruni C.B. Chiariotti L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; PubMed Google Scholar) and estrogen receptors (44Saville B. Poukka H. Wormke M. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Stoner M. Samudio I. Safe S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2485-2497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It is not known whether Rnf4 is required for DNA repair in human cells. The DNA repair defects of rfp1Δrfp2Δ double mutants were associated with a large increase in protein SUMOylation and were rescued by the reduction of SUMO conjugates by Ulp2 overexpression. SUMO is known to modify a number of proteins involved in DNA repair (14Lee K.M. O'Connell M.J. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2006; 5: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and it is likely that dysregulation of some if not all of these proteins contributes to the DNA damage sensitivity and repair defects of the rfp1Δrfp2Δ double mutants. We note that the poor growth, nuclear abnormalities, and DNA damage sensitivity of rfp1Δrfp2Δ double mutants are similar to that of rad22Δ cells (45Osman F. Dixon J. Barr A.R. Whitby M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8084-8096Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 46Morishita T. Furukawa F. Sakaguchi C. Toda T. Carr A.M. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8074-8083Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). rad22 encodes the S. pombe Rad52 homolog, which is required for all recombinational repair in S. pombe (47Doe C.L. Osman F. Dixon J. Whitby M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 5570-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and is a target for SUMOylation (48Ho J.C. Warr N.J. Shimizu H. Watts F.Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4179-4186Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As Rnf4 is known to be an E3 ubiquitin ligase (25Hakli M. Lorick K.L. Weissman A.M. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. FEBS Lett. 2004; 560: 56-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and Rfp1 and Rfp2 have conserved RING finger domains, it is reasonable to conclude that these proteins are similarly E3 ubiquitin ligases. In this context, it is possible that Rfp1 and Rfp2 are regulating the levels of proteins involved in SUMOylation, or perhaps Rfp1 and Rfp2 are involved in directing the ubiquitination and degradation of SUMOylated proteins, and hence these accumulate in the rfp1Δrfp2Δ double mutants. However, spontaneous slow growth suppressors of the rfp1Δrfp2Δ double mutants arise at high frequency, and intercrosses between such suppressors indicated that many different loci are mutated in these suppressors. This observation suggests that the accumulation of SUMOylated proteins in rfp1Δrfp2Δ double mutants is due to pleiotrophic effects, and although it is clear that this is the cause of the DNA repair defect, its mechanistic basis remains to be elucidated.

https://openalex.org/W2037519944,"Expression of angiogenic cytokines like vascular endothelial growth factor is enhanced by hypoxia. We tested the hypothesis that decreased oxygen levels up-regulate the angiogenic factor secretoneurin. In vivo, muscle cells of mouse ischemic hind limbs showed increased secretoneurin expression, and inhibition of secretoneurin by a neutralizing antibody impaired the angiogenic response in this ischemia model. In a mouse soft tissue model of hypoxia, secretoneurin was increased in subcutaneous muscle fibers. In vitro, secretoneurin mRNA and protein were up-regulated in L6 myoblast cells after exposure to low oxygen levels. The hypoxia-dependent regulation of secretoneurin was tissue specific and was not observed in endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, or AtT20 pituitary tumor cells. The hypoxia-dependent induction of secretoneurin in L6 myoblasts is regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha, since inhibition of this factor using si-RNA inhibited up-regulation of secretoneurin. Induction of secretoneurin by hypoxia was dependent on basic fibroblast growth factor in vivo and in vitro, and inhibition of this regulation by heparinase suggests an involvement of low-affinity basic fibroblast growth factor binding sites. In summary, our data show that the angiogenic cytokine secretoneurin is up-regulated by hypoxia in muscle cells by hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha- and basic fibroblast growth factor-dependent mechanisms."

Because of the low solubility of free Fe3+, many bacteria produce siderophores that bind to iron. The iron-siderophore complex is then actively transported into the cell. Although some small molecules like citrate or salicylate are able to function as lower affinity siderophores, many specialized peptides with extremely high affinity for iron are produced nonribosomally by bacteria. These compounds are produced by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) 2The abbreviations used are: NRPS, nonribosomal peptide synthetase; EDDHA, ethylenediamine-di-(o-hydroxyphenyl)acetic acid; TEV, tobacco etch virus; SeMet, selenomethionine; LC, liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry. that exist as modular proteins with multiple catalytic domains joined in a single protein.

Holder I.A. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 518-523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pyoverdine contains a cyclic peptide chain as well as a chemically modified dihydroxyquinoline-based chromophore that is responsible for iron binding. The peptide backbone of pyoverdine is synthesized by four large, multi-module NRPS proteins. The pyoverdine molecule contains proteinogenic amino acids as well as the unusual amino acids 2,4-diaminobutyrate and formyl-N-hydroxyornithine. P. aeruginosa produces multiple isoforms of pyoverdine that have been identified by mass spectrometry (8Fuchs R. Budzikiewicz H. Curr. Org. Chem. 2001; 5: 265-288Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Kilz S. Lenz C. Fuchs R. Budzikiewicz H. J. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 34: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The peptide backbone, as dictated by the NRPS enzymes, remains constant, but variations in the chromophore and the N-terminal side chain have been observed. Alternate side chains include succinate, succinamide, malate, and γ-glutamate; the latter is believed to be the original amino acid incorporated into the peptide. Although the C-7 position of the chromophore is most commonly a hydride, sulfonyl and chloride groups have also been observed experimentally (8Fuchs R. Budzikiewicz H. Curr. Org. Chem. 2001; 5: 265-288Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Finally, pyoverdines isolated from P. aeruginosa have been observed to contain a single or double bond between the C-5 and C-6 position of the chromophore (9Kilz S. Lenz C. Fuchs R. Budzikiewicz H. J. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 34: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition to the NRPS proteins, 11 other proteins have been identified that are essential for proper pyoverdine production (10Ochsner U.A. Wilderman P.J. Vasil A.I. Vasil M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Genetic deletion of any of these proteins prevents pyoverdine production and growth in the presence of the iron chelator EDDHA. Finally there are four proteins, PvcABCD, that have been implicated in chromophore maturation (11Stintzi A. Johnson Z. Stonehouse M. Ochsner U. Meyer J.M. Vasil M.L. Poole K. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4118-4124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although the essential role of these proteins has been questioned (3Visca P. Imperi F. Lamont I.L. Trends Microbiol. 2007; 15: 22-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Because the enzymes that catalyze siderophore synthesis have been targeted recently for antibiotic development (12Somu R.V. Boshoff H. Qiao C. Bennett E.M. Barry III, C.E. Aldrich C.C. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), insights into the pyoverdine synthetic pathway may identify new antibiotic targets. Many NRPS clusters contain a small ∼80-amino acid protein belonging to the MbtH family, named after the MbtH protein from the mycobactin cluster of Mycobacteria tuberculosis (4Quadri L.E. Sello J. Keating T.A. Weinreb P.H. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 631-645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). These proteins are ∼8–9 kDa in size, generally have calculated pI values ranging from 4.0 to 5.5, and exhibit no homology to proteins of known structure. Escherichia coli contains a member of this family with the cluster of genes regulated for synthesis and import of the siderophore enterobactin (2Raymond K.N. Dertz E.A. Kim S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3584-3588Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 13Yeats C. Bentley S. Bateman A. BMC Microbiol. 2003; 3: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This protein, encoded by the ybdZ gene, is located on a polycistronic operon that contains the fes and entF genes. The fes gene encodes an enterobactin esterase that is responsible for release of iron from the imported enterobactin (14Lin H. Fischbach M.A. Liu D.R. Walsh C.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 11075-11084Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), whereas entF encodes the multidomain EntF NRPS protein that catalyzes the final steps in the synthesis of enterobactin (15Gehring A.M. Mori I. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2648-2659Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 16Rusnak F. Sakaitani M. Drueckhammer D. Reichert J. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2916-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). E. coli proteins have been identified for all steps of enterobactin synthesis, and the necessary proteins for import, export, and cleavage of the enterobactin molecule have also been identified (1Fischbach M.A. Lin H. Liu D.R. Walsh C.T. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 5Crosa J.H. Walsh C.T. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 223-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). The functional roles of the YbdZ protein and all of the members of the MbtH family therefore remain unknown. We have initiated a structural study of the proteins involved in siderophore production in E. coli and P. aeruginosa. We have recently determined the structures of the E. coli EntA (17Sundlov J.A. Garringer J.A. Carney J.M. Reger A.S. Drake E.J. Duax W.L. Gulick A.M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 734-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and EntB proteins (18Drake E.J. Nicolai D.A. Gulick A.M. Chem. Biol. 2006; 13: 409-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Here we present the 1.8 Å crystal structure of PA2412, the P. aeruginosa MbtH-like protein that is coregulated with other pyoverdine producing proteins (10Ochsner U.A. Wilderman P.J. Vasil A.I. Vasil M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Additionally, growth experiments in the presence and absence of an iron chelator demonstrate that PA2412 is necessary for growth under iron-depleted conditions. The addition of pyoverdine extracted from culture supernatants of wild-type cells was able to support the growth of the PA2412 mutant cell line, demonstrating that the defect caused by PA2412 deletion is in production, stabilization, or export of the mature pyoverdine molecule and not in the import and utilization of the iron-siderophore complex. Protein Production and Purification—The gene encoding PA2412 was obtained commercially from a distributor (Open-Biosystems, Huntsville, AL) for the cDNA library of P. aeruginosa genes (19Labaer J. Qiu Q. Anumanthan A. Mar W. Zuo D. Murthy T.V. Taycher H. Halleck A. Hainsworth E. Lory S. Brizuela L. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 2190-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The gene was amplified with PCR to incorporate restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends and subcloned into a modified pET15b plasmid that contains a 5×His affinity tag and a TEV protease recognition site in place of the thrombin site (20Kapust R.B. Tozser J. Fox J.D. Anderson D.E. Cherry S. Copeland T.D. Waugh D.S. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). The final plasmid (pED235) was transformed into BL21(DE3) for protein production. Protein expression was induced by addition of 0.75 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to the growth medium. The cells were grown at 16 °C, and induction was continued overnight. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and all of the remaining purification steps were performed at 4 °C. The cells were lysed by sonication in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.2 mm tris-carboxyethylphosphine, and clarified by centrifugation at 45,000 rpm for 45 min. The cell lysate was passed over a His-trap (GE-Healthcare) immobilized metal ion affinity column and washed with lysis buffer containing 50 mm imidazole, and bound proteins were eluted with the same buffer containing 300 mm imidazole. The protein was dialyzed against TEV cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm tris-carboxyethylphosphine, and 0.5 mm EDTA). After 24 h, TEV protease was added to the dialysis at a ratio of ∼1:100. The cleavage continued for 18 h; the clarified protein was passed over the His-Trap column a second time to remove uncleaved protein, the TEV protease, and contaminating proteins. The protein in the column flow-through was dialyzed against final crystallization buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm tris-carboxyethylphosphine) and concentrated to ∼6 mg/ml using an extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 20940 m-1 cm-1. Selenomethionine (SeMet) labeled protein was produced by the metabolic inhibition method (21Doubliè S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar) and purified in the same manner as wild-type protein. Both wild type and SeMet were subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Roswell Park Proteomics Facility, Buffalo, NY). The experimentally determined molecular mass of the native protein was 8646 Da (the calculated molecular mass was 8638 Da), confirming no chemical modifications to the recombinant protein and that the selenium incorporation occurred at all three Met residues with greater than 80% occupancy. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystallization conditions were identified by sparse matrix screening using an in-house crystallization screen. Crystals of the native protein were grown by the microbatch method (22Rayment I. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 147-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) at 4 °C using a 1:1 mixture of protein and precipitant containing 33–37% pentaerythritol propoxylate 426 (23Gulick A.M. Horswill A.R. Thoden J.B. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Rayment I. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 306-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), 50 mm succinate (pH 5.0). Crystals of the SeMet protein of the same morphology were grown using 38–42% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 50 mm succinate (pH 5.0) as the precipitant. The crystals were transferred to a nylon loop and cryo-cooled directly in the stream of N2 gas at -160 °C.

Initial phases were determined by BnP (24Weeks C.M. Blessing R.H. Miller R. Mungee R. Potter S.A. Rappleye J. Smith G.D. Xu H. Furey W. Z.

The final solvent flattened phases from BnP were submitted to RESOLVE (25Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The model was completed through iterative refinement with REFMAC5 (27Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar) and manual model building with COOT (28Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23387) Google Scholar). The final model contains residues 8–68 and 76 molecules of solvent. Residues 1–7 and 69–72, as well as the side chain of residue Asp8, were disordered. The final refinement statistics for PA2412 are shown in Table 2. The atomic coordinates and structure factors for PA2412 have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession code 2PST).TABLE 2Refinement statisticsPA2412 nativeResolution range50.0–1.8 ÅRcryst19.2%Rcryst (highest resolution shell)25.3%Rfree23.2%Rfree (highest resolution shell)28.8%Wilson B factor19.6 Å2Average B factor, protein (all, main chain, side chain)19.3 Å2, 18.5 Å2, 20.1 Å2Average B factor, solventaThe total number of atoms used in calculation are in parentheses34.6 Å2 (76)Root mean square deviation bond lengths, angles0.011 Å, 1.3°a The total number of atoms used in calculation are in parentheses Open table in a new tab Extraction of Pyoverdine from Wild-type PA01 Culture Supernatants—Pyoverdine was obtained from culture medium using the method of Budzikiewicz and colleagues (29Meyer J.M. Stintzi A. De Vos D. Cornelis P. Tappe R. Taraz K. Budzikiewicz H. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were grown in SM9 medium (29Meyer J.M. Stintzi A. De Vos D. Cornelis P. Tappe R. Taraz K. Budzikiewicz H. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) to saturation. The cells were removed from solution by centrifugation, and 10–30 ml of medium was passed through a 1-ml octyl Amprep minicolumn (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). The bound material was washed with 2 ml of H2O and eluted with 50% methanol. The eluate was dried by evaporation and resuspended in H2O. An estimate of the pyoverdine concentration in this resuspended material was determined by absorbance at 405 nm using an extinction coefficient of 19000 m-1 cm-1 (30Wilderman P.J. Vasil A.I. Johnson Z. Wilson M.J. Cunliffe H.E. Lamont I.L. Vasil M.L. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 5385-5394Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Growth of wild-type cells in the presence of FeCl3 yields a very slight change in absorbance at 405 nm (data not shown), demonstrating the production of pyoverdine, or additional compounds that absorb at 405 nm, in iron-replete conditions. Structural Characterization of Pyoverdine in the Growth Medium of Wild-type Cells—The pyoverdine samples eluted from the mini-column were subjected to nano-LC/MS/MS analysis to confirm the presence of pyoverdines in the isolated material and to identify which pyoverdine isoforms were present. A multiple-dimensional nano-LC system (GE Healthcare), coupled with a linear ion trap instrument (Thermo) equipped with a lab-made nanospray probe was used for pyoverdine identification. Isolated material from reversed-phase cartridges was loaded on a reversed-phase peptide trap (5 mm × 300 μm I.D.) and washed with 3% acetonitrile; the separation was carried out on a C18 reversed-phase nano-column (15 cm × 75 μm I.D.). A shallow multi-step gradient was used to resolve the samples, and the on-column flow rates ranged from 180 to 260 nl/min. The linear ion trap instrument was programmed to perform the following scan cycle repetitively throughout the nano-LC run; a MS1 scan within the range of m/z 300–1500 was followed by a zoom MS1 scan under high resolution to identify the charge states of ions. Seven data-dependent scan events (MS2) followed to fragment, respectively, the top seven most intensive precursors observed in the initial MS1 event. Wide band in-trap activation was used to fragment further any MS2 fragments that resulted from a neutral loss mass smaller than 20 (e.g. loss of water). In this way, extensive structure-informative fragments were obtained for the major components in the isolated fraction. After careful ion chemistry interpretation of the acquired MS2 spectra and consideration of compound polarities, two doubly charged peaks at m/z 695 and 707, having retention times of 35.26 and 20.93 min, respectively, were identified as pyoverdines. Analysis confirmed the presence of the pyoverdines in the medium used for the supplementation experiments described above. Growth Experiments of Wild-type and a Deletion Mutants of PA2411 and PA2412—Growth experiments were performed with knock-out mutants (10Ochsner U.A. Wilderman P.J. Vasil A.I. Vasil M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) of both PA2411 and PA2412 (generously provided by Dr. Michael Vasil, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center). For growth experiments, the cells were grown in SM9 medium (29Meyer J.M. Stintzi A. De Vos D. Cornelis P. Tappe R. Taraz K. Budzikiewicz H. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) containing EDDHA (Wallace Laboratories, El Segundo, CA) or FeCl3 (Sigma). In the experiments shown, EDDHA was used at 600 μm to allow some cell growth to occur; at a concentration of 1 mm, all growth of the mutant strain was inhibited. Cell growth was monitored at A595. To measure pyoverdine production, the cells were clarified from solution by centrifugation, and the culture supernatant was analyzed for absorbance at 405 nm. Structure Determination and Description—The gene encoding PA2412 was obtained commercially and amplified with PCR to incorporate appropriate restriction sites for subcloning. The fragment was subcloned into a modified pET15b plasmid that contains a substituted TEV protease cleavage site in place of the standard thrombin cleavage site. The recombinant PA2412 was purified by two affinity chromatography steps with an intervening TEV cleavage step to remove the histidine tag. The final protein contains the 72 amino acids with two residues, a glycine and a histidine, remaining on the N terminus after protease cleavage. Native and SeMet-labeled protein were crystallized by microbatch methods. The three-dimensional structure was determined by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion diffraction experiments. Two of the three selenium positions were identified, and the experimental phases were used for automated and manual model building. Iterative refinement and model building of the structure continued to completion. The final structural model (Fig. 2) of PA2412 contains residues 9–68 with the N-terminal 8 residues and the C-terminal 4 residues disordered. The protein is shaped like a thin arrowhead with dimensions of ∼25 × 43 × 13 Å. The protein contains a central three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, organized in a β2-β1-β3 topology, followed by two α-helices. One helix, located at residues 44–54, packs against the sheet, whereas the final two-turn helix at residues 61–67 forms the point of the arrowhead. A structural comparison with proteins in the Protein Data Bank was performed with DALI (31Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). The search identified two potential homologs, the catalytic domain of the TevI intron endonuclease (32Van Roey P. Meehan L. Kowalksi J.C. Belfort M. Derbyshire V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 806-811PubMed Google Scholar) and the N-terminal domain of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNase H1 (33Evans S.P. Bycroft M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Both are larger proteins in which the structural match with PA2412 is based on the central three-stranded sheet and the larger helix. Over the core aligned sequences between the two hits, the proteins exhibit very weak structural and sequence conservation. The TevI endonuclease aligns over 47 residues with an root mean square deviation for Cα positions of 2.2 Å and sequence identity of 2%. The RNase HI protein aligns over 39 residues with an root mean square deviation of 3.2 Å and a sequence identity of 10%. Both proteins have larger domains that are not included in PA2412, and none of the conserved sequence motifs of PA2412 (see below) is present in the structural homologs. Locations of Conserved Sequences—As noted above, PA2412 is part of a larger family (13Yeats C. Bentley S. Bateman A. BMC Microbiol. 2003; 3: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) of MbtH-like proteins belonging to COG3251 (cluster of orthologous genes). These proteins have been identified in a number of NRPS clusters that are involved in the synthesis of peptide antibiotics and siderophores. PA2412 exhibits >80% sequence identity with the other members from the Pseudomonas genus and ∼25–60% identity with most other members of the MbtH-like family. It has been noted (34Stegmann E. Rausch C. Stockert S. Burkert D. Wohlleben W. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2006; 262: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) that the family members from enterobacteria such as Salmonella enterica and E. coli are less well conserved than most proteins. An examination of an alignment of the sequences of all 155 members of the family identifies several well conserved regions of the protein; representative sequences are shown in Fig. 3A. Perhaps most interesting are three tryptophan residues that are present throughout the family. Trp25 and Trp35 are universally conserved in all family members; Trp55 is present in all sequences except for two shorter proteins that appear to terminate before this residue. The residues surrounding these tryptophan residues are also very highly conserved. The sequence surrounding Trp25 is SϕWP where the ϕ is an aliphatic residue like Ile, Leu, or Val. This region lies on strand β2 of the central sheet (Fig. 3). The consensus sequence around Trp35 is PXGW and falls on the turn that precedes strand β3. The side chain indole rings of Trp25 and Trp35 are nearly parallel and form a small pocket about 7 Å across. This pocket is bordered on one side by Pro32 and on the other by Ser23. The base of the pocket is formed in PA2412 by Val15, a residue from strand β1 that is always present as a Leu or Val residue. Interestingly, Fo - Fc difference electron density exists in this pocket for both the native protein crystallized with pentaerythritol propoxylate 426 as the precipitant and SeMet protein, which crystallized in 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. Attempts to build a molecule of 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol or succinate into this density did not fit satisfactorily, and the exact chemical nature of this group remains to be determined. Also positioned on the first strand is Asn17, a residue that is conserved in >97% of the MbtH-like family members. The third conserved region occurs between the two helices of the protein and appears to orient properly the C-terminal helix. Although less well conserved than the other two regions, the most common region around Trp55 is WTDXRP. In this motif, the mostly buried Trp55 is followed by Asp57, which forms an ionic interaction with Arg59. Following Arg59 is a proline residue that initiates the C-terminal helix. In PA2412, the side chain of Asp68 from this helix"
https://openalex.org/W2016105721,"Gene expression profiles of malignant tumors surgically removed from ovarian cancer patients pre-treated with chemotherapy (neo-adjuvant) prior to surgery group into two distinct clusters. One group clusters with carcinomas from patients not pre-treated with chemotherapy prior to surgery (C-L), while the other clusters with non-malignant adenomas (A-L). We show here that although the C-L cluster is preferentially associated with p53 loss-of-function (LOF) mutations, the C-L cluster cancer patients display a more favorable clinical response to chemotherapy as evidenced by enhanced long-term survivorships. Our results support a model whereby p53 mediated cell-cycle-arrest/DNA repair serves as a barrier to optimal chemotherapeutic treatment of ovarian and perhaps other carcinomas and suggest that inhibition of p53 during chemotherapy may enhance clinical outcome."
https://openalex.org/W1967990661,"Cripto is a membrane-bound co-receptor for Nodal, a member of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily. Mouse embryos lacking either Cripto or Nodal have the same lethal phenotype at embryonic day 7.5. Previous studies suggest that O-fucosylation of the epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeat in Cripto is essential for the facilitation of Nodal signaling. Substitution of Ala for the Thr to which O-fucose is attached led to functional inactivation of both human and mouse Cripto. However, embryos null for protein O-fucosyltransferase 1, the enzyme that adds O-fucose to EGF repeats, do not exhibit a Cripto null phenotype and die at about embryonic day 9.5. This suggested that the loss of O-fucose from the EGF repeat may not have led to the inactivation of Cripto in previous studies. Here we investigate this hypothesis and show the following: 1) protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 is indeed the enzyme that adds O-fucose to Cripto; 2) Pofut1–/– embryonic stem cells behave the same as Pofut1+/+ embryonic stem cells in a Nodal signaling assay; 3) Pofut1–/– and Pofut1+/+ embryoid bodies are indistinguishable in their ability to differentiate into cardiomyocytes; and 4) none of 10 amino acid substitutions at Thr72, including Ser which acquires O-fucose, rescues the activity of mouse Cripto in Nodal signaling assays. Therefore, the Thr to which O-fucose is linked in Cripto plays a key functional role, but O-fucose at Thr72 is not required for Cripto to function in cell-based signaling assays or in vivo. By contrast, we show that O-fucose, and not the Thr to which it is attached, is required in the ligand-binding domain of Notch1 for Notch1 signaling. Cripto is a membrane-bound co-receptor for Nodal, a member of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily.

Here we investigate this hypothesis and show the following: 1) protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 is indeed the enzyme that adds O-fucose to Cripto; 2) Pofut1–/– embryonic stem cells behave the same as Pofut1+/+ embryonic stem cells in a Nodal signaling assay; 3) Pofut1–/– and Pofut1+/+ embryoid bodies are indistinguishable in their ability to differentiate into cardiomyocytes; and 4) none of 10 amino acid substitutions at Thr72, including Ser which acquires O-fucose, rescues the activity of mouse Cripto in Nodal signaling assays. Therefore, the Thr to which O-fucose is linked in Cripto plays a key functional role, but O-fucose at Thr72 is not required for Cripto to function in cell-based signaling assays or in vivo. By contrast, we show that O-fucose, and not the Thr to which it is attached, is required in the ligand-binding domain of Notch1 for Notch1 signaling.

Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 589-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The major components of the Nodal-signaling pathway are the soluble ligand Nodal, activin membrane receptors (ActRIIB and ALK4) to which Nodal binds, Smad2 and Smad4 signal-transducing molecules, and the transcription factor Fast1 (FoxH1). In addition, Cripto, a membrane glycoprotein with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, is an essential co-receptor for Nodal and is required for Nodal signaling. Cripto contains the following two functional domains that play distinct roles in Nodal signaling: a truncated epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeat and the CFC domain (2Shen M.M. Schier A.F. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 303-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar).

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In addition, mouse Gdf3 (growth-differentiation factor 3) is similar to Nodal in requiring Cripto for its signaling activity (7Chen C. Ware S.M. Sato A. Houston-Hawkins D.E. Habas R. Matzuk M.M.

More recently, other factors were found to regulate Nodal signaling via interaction with Cripto, including activin (8Gray P.C. Harrison C.A. Vale W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In fact, these signaling events appear to be triggered by the direct interaction of Cripto with Glypican-1. Finally, Cripto has been implicated in the formation of multiple tumors, including breast, pancreatic, and colorectal cancer (reviewed in Ref. 20Bianco C. Strizzi L. Normanno N. Khan N. Salomon D.S.

In the case of Cripto, Thr to Ala substitution in the EGF repeat of human or mouse Cripto leads to an inactive Cripto unable to facilitate Nodal signaling in cell-based assays (25Schiffer S.G.

Lec13, a CHO mutant cell line, which is defective in GDP-fucose synthesis and thereby has insufficient O-fucosylation on Notch receptors, has impaired Jagged1-induced Notch signaling (28Chen J. Moloney D.J. Stanley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13716-13721Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 29Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y.

In addition, inactivation of Pofut1 (protein O-fucosyltransferase 1), the glycosyltransferase that catalyzes the addition of fucose to EGF-containing proteins, results in severe Notch signaling defects in both Drosophila and mouse (30Shi S.

Finally, mutation of O-fucose glycosylation sites (Thr to Ala mutations) within either EGF repeat 12 or 27 of mouse Notch1 causes a significant reduction in Notch signaling activity in cell-based assays (32Rampal R.

O-Fucosylation also occurs in thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs) (35Hofsteenge J. Huwiler K.G. Macek B. Hess D. Lawler J. Mosher D.F. Peter-Katalinic J. J. Biol.

Because O-fucose appeared to be essential for Cripto/Nodal signaling, we had expected that targeted mutation of Pofut1 would give rise to a Cripto–/– phenotype. Cripto null embryos are described as “trunkless” and die at about E7.5 (2Shen M.M. Schier A.F. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 303-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 3Ding J.X.Y. Yan Y.T. Chen A. Desai N. Wynshaw-Boris A. Shen M.M.

However, Pofut1–/– embryos die later at about E9.5 with a phenotype consistent with a global deficiency in the canonical Notch signaling pathway (30Shi S. Stanley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5234-5239Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Therefore, an important question is why the ablation of Pofut1 in mouse embryos did not inactivate Cripto and give rise to a Cripto null phenotype? It has been shown that there are no wild type Pofut1 gene transcripts in E6.5 Pofut1–/– embryos that could rescue a Cripto phenotype (43Shi S. Stahl M. Lu L. Stanley P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9503-9508Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Possible alternative explanations are that Pofut1 is not the enzyme that transfers fucose to Cripto, that another enzyme is also capable of adding fucose to Cripto, or that the Thr in the EGF domain to which fucose is attached is critical, rather than the fucose. Here we show the following: Cripto is O-fucosylated in Pofut1+/+ but not Pofut1–/– ES cell extracts; Nodal signaling based on activation of a FAST2 reporter construct occurs equivalently in Pofut1+/+ and Pofut1–/– ES cells; Pofut1–/– and Pofut1+/+ embryoid bodies differentiate into cardiomyocytes equivalently in culture, a process that requires functional Cripto/Nodal signaling (44Xu C. Liguori G. Adamson E.D. Persico M.G. Dev. Biol. 1998; 196: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 45Parisi S. D'Andrea D. Lago C.T. Adamson E.D. Persico M.G. Minchiotti G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar); Ser instead of Thr at amino acid 72 in mouse Cripto acquires O-fucose but is not functional in Cripto/Nodal signaling; and eight other amino acids in place of Thr72 in mouse Cripto gave Cripto with greatly impaired activity in Nodal signaling assays. Therefore, Thr72 and not fucose is required for Cripto function. ES Cell Lines—ES cell lines were isolated from outgrowths of blastocysts obtained from mating Pofut1+/– heterozygotes and genotyped as described previously (43Shi S. Stahl M. Lu L. Stanley P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9503-9508Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Independent cell lines with the Pofut1+/+, Pofut1+/– or Pofut1–/– genotype were obtained. Expression Constructs—The constructs for Nodal signaling assays (all derived from mouse) were kindly provided by Dr. Michael Shen (Rutgers University) (26Yan Y.T. Liu J.J. Luo Y.E.C. Haltiwanger R.S.

Renilla luciferase, pRL-TK (Promega), was used for normalization. pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) was used to maintain the same DNA concentration in transfection experiments. The mouse Notch1 fragment containing the N terminus and EGF repeats 1–18 with a Myc-His6 C-terminal tag was described previously (46Shao L. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R. J. Biol.

Preparation of Cell Extracts—Pofut1+/+ and Pofut1–/– ES cells grown in the absence of feeder cells were genotyped with the primers PS644 and PS645 as described previously (43Shi S. Stahl M. Lu L. Stanley P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9503-9508Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Cells were grown on 10-cm gelatin-coated dishes with ES cell culture medium. When the cells became confluent, they were scraped off the plate and washed three times with TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl). The cell pellet was placed on ice, and 2 ml of lysis buffer (TBS with 1% Nonidet P-40) and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) was added. The cells were resuspended by pipetting and incubated on ice for 15 min with repeated vortexing. The cell lysate was spun at ∼12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was snap-frozen using liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Protein O-Fucosyltransferase 1 Assays—Assays for Pofut1 activity were performed essentially as described previously (39Luo Y. Koles K. Vorndam W. Haltiwanger R.S. Panin V.M. J. Biol.

Substrates for the assays were produced as follows. 1) ES cells cultured in a 10-cm gelatinized plate to 50% confluency were transfected with 24 μg of Notch1 EGF1–18 DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. After 24 h, the medium was collected and centrifuged, and the supernatant was incubated on a rotator with 50 μl of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4 °C. The agarose beads were washed five times in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) mixture. 2) Production of bacterially expressed EGF repeat 1 from human factor VII was described previously (39Luo Y.

Products of the assay were separated and counted or analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Site-directed Mutagenesis of Cripto and Notch1—pcDNA3-FLAG-Cripto was used as a template in the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to manufacturer's instructions. All mutants except those provided by Michael Shen (Rutgers University) were generated in the Stony Brook University Molecular Cloning Service Core. All constructs were sequenced to confirm mutagenesis. A full-length construct of mouse Notch1, in which the C-terminal PEST domain is replaced by six tandem MYC epitopes in pCS2+, was a kind gift of Raphael Kopan (Washington University School of Medicine). The primers to generate N1/T12S and N1/EGF11–15/T12S were 5′-CCATGTCAGAATGATGCCTCGTGCCTGGACCAGATTG-3′ and 5′-CAATCTGGTCCAGGCACGAGGCATCATTCTGACATGG-3′; the primers to generate N1/T12A were 5′-CCATGTCAGAATGACGCCGCATGCCTGGACCAGATTG-3′ and 5′-CAATCTGGTCCAGGCACGTGGCGTCATTCTGACATGG-3′; the primers to generate the N1/T12A revertant were 5′-CCATGTCAGAATGATGCCACTTGCCTGGACCAGATTG-3′ and 5′-CAATCTGGTCCAGGCAAGTGGCATCATTCTGACATGG-3′; and the primers for N1/EGF11–15 and EGF11–15T12A were described previously (46Shao L. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7775-7782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol from Stratagene was used for site-directed mutagenesis. All constructs were sequenced to confirm nucleotide changes. Analysis of O-Fucosylation—O-Fucosylation of wild type and mutant forms of mouse Cripto was evaluated as described (26Yan Y.T. Liu J.J. Luo Y.E.C. Haltiwanger R.S. Abate-Shen C. Shen M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4439-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and O-fucosylation of Notch fragments N1/EGF11–15 (with C-terminal Myc-His6 tags) and mutants T466A and T466S was determined essentially as described (46Shao L.

In brief, expression constructs were transiently expressed in Pro–Lec1.3C Chinese hamster ovary (Lec1 CHO) cells (50Chen W. Stanley P. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) or GenePorter (Genlantis). After 24 h the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 20 μCi/ml [6-3H]fucose (American Radiochemical Corp., St. Louis). After 48 h, medium and lysates were collected, and Notch1 fragments were purified by rotating with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) overnight at 4 °C. After washing five times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS, fragments were eluted with 100 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. After electrophoresis on a 10% SDS gel, the dried gel was treated with EN3HANCER (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed for 1 week at –80 °C to a BioMax MS film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Nodal Signaling Assay with ES Cells and 293T Cells—A method to assay Nodal signaling was developed in ES cells based on Yan et al. (26Yan Y.T. Liu J.J. Luo Y.E.C. Haltiwanger R.S. Abate-Shen C. Shen M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4439-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Briefly, ES cells (5 × 105) were plated in 24-well plates. Transfection was performed after 24 h (∼50% confluency) with 50 ng of Renilla luciferase DNA, 300 ng of A3-luc reporter, 300 ng of pcDNA3-Fast, 400 ng of pcDNA3-HA-Cripto, 400 ng of pcDNA3-Nodal, and various amounts of pcDNA3 to bring the DNA concentration to 1.45 μg. The DNA was mixed with 4 μl of Lipofectamine-2000 (Invitrogen) and added to each well with 1 ml of Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) containing an additional 3% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gemini). After 24 h at 37 °C, the cells were lysed by overlaying 300 μl of lysis buffer from the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (E1910, Promega), and rocked at room temperature for 15 min. The cell lysate was transferred to an Eppendorf tube and frozen at –80 °C. After thawing and vortexing, luciferase activity assays were conducted according to the manufacturer's instruction using a luminometer. Renilla luciferase activity was used to normalize for differences in transfection efficiency. Each signaling assay was performed in duplicate and was repeated at least twice. The Nodal signaling assay in HEK-293T cells was the same except that the cell density at transfection was ∼80%. Differentiation of Embryoid Bodies into Cardiomyocytes—Independently derived Pofut1–/– and Pofut1+/+ ES cell lines were differentiated into embryoid bodies (EB) as described with minor modification (51Wobus A.M. Guan K. Yang H.T. Boheler K.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 185: 127-156PubMed Google Scholar).

Despite the existence of an alternative acyltransferase (DGAT1), mice lacking DGAT2 have a severe deficiency of TG in adipose tissue, indicating a nonredundant role for this enzyme in adipocyte TG synthesis. We have studied the regulation of DGAT2 expression during adipogenesis. In both isolated murine preadipocytes and 3T3-L1 cells the temporal pattern of DGAT2 expression closely mimicked that of genes whose expression is regulated by CAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ). Inhibition of C/EBPβ expression in differentiating preadipocytes reduced DGAT2 expression, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments identified a promoter element in the DGAT2 gene that is likely to mediate this effect. The importance of C/EBPβ in adipocyte expression of DGAT2 was confirmed by the finding of reduced DGAT2 expression in the adipose tissue of C/EBPβ-null animals. However, DGAT2 expression is maintained at high levels during the later stages of adipogenesis, when C/EBPβ levels decline. We show that, at these later stages of differentiation, C/EBPα is capable of substituting for C/EBPβ at the same promoter element. These observations provide novel insight into the transcriptional regulation of DGAT2 expression. Moreover, they further refine the complex and serial roles of the C/EBP family of transcription factors in inducing and maintaining the metabolic properties of mature adipocytes.

The increased adipose tissue mass of obesity results from a combination of increased lipid storage in existing adipocytes and the generation of new adipocytes from precursors residing within the adipose tissue (1Camp H.S. Ren D. Leff T. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 442-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The induction of genes responsible for the formation of triacylglycerol (TG) 3The abbreviations used are: TG, triacylglycerol; DGAT, diacylglycerol acyltransferase; C/EBP, CAAT/enhancer-binding protein; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; LIP, liver inhibitory protein; ETO, eight-twenty one/MTG8; siRNA, small interference RNA; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation. 3The abbreviations used are: TG, triacylglycerol; DGAT, diacylglycerol acyltransferase; C/EBP, CAAT/enhancer-binding protein; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; LIP, liver inhibitory protein; ETO, eight-twenty one/MTG8; siRNA, small interference RNA; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation. within developing or pre-existing adipocytes is therefore likely to make an important contribution to the enlargement of adipose mass. In contrast, pathologically decreased lipid accumulation or impaired adipogenesis in lipodystrophic subjects has deleterious metabolic consequences superficially like those seen in obesity, including insulin resistance and dyslipidemia, with attendant increases in cardiovascular disease. Thus good metabolic control is likely to require the body to restrain adipose tissue mass while still maintaining the capacity to respond accurately to substrate availability. In this way, when necessary, lipids can be partitioned appropriately into adipose tissue and away from other insulin-sensitive tissues where they may have detrimental effects. That mutations of AGPAT2, a key enzyme in TG synthesis, can cause near total lipodystrophy demonstrates the importance of this pathway in such diseases of adipose development and function (2Agarwal A.K.

Rational therapeutic strategies for both obesity and lipodystrophy will require a detailed knowledge of the regulatory pathways required for the formation of an appropriate mass of metabolically active adipocytes, capable of tightly controlling lipid synthesis and storage. The enzyme diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) catalyzes the final step of mammalian TG synthesis, and two isoforms, DGAT1 and DGAT2, exist, encoded by different genes. DGAT1 knock-out mice have been shown to be resistant to high fat diet-induced obesity due to increased metabolic rate with increased physical activity (4Smith S.J. Cases S. Jensen D.R. Chen H.C.

Mice lacking DGAT2, however, show a more dramatic phenotype, with severe lipopenia and early postnatal death due to a lack of substrates for energy metabolism and defects of skin permeability (7Stone S.J. Myers H.M. Watkins S.M. Brown B.E. Feingold K.R. Elias P.M. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11767-11776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Thus, DGAT2 has a key role in TG synthesis and, in addition, is highly expressed in adipocytes. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling its expression in adipose tissue have not been defined to date. The transcriptional control of gene expression during adipogenesis involves the complex interplay of a multitude of transcription factors whose temporal expression must be precisely coordinated (8Rangwala S.M. Lazar M.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 535-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 9Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M.

Several factors have been shown to play central roles in this transcriptional cascade. The induction of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ occurs rapidly following the initiation of adipogenesis, and these factors, modulated by a plethora of cofactors, induce the expression of a second wave of genes, including the so-called “master regulators” of adipogenesis, C/EBPα and PPARγ. The targets of these transcription factors include the genes encoding many genes of the mature lipogenic and insulin-sensitive adipocyte such as aP2, PEPCK, aquaporin 7, lipoprotein lipase, adiponectin, and Glut4 (8Rangwala S.M. Lazar M.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 535-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 11Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Thus the C/EBP family of transcription factors has a critical role in adipogenesis, and studies of both the loss and gain of function in vitro and in vivo have demonstrated the importance of their activity in adipocyte development and lipid accumulation. Ablation of C/EBPα in mice leads to a loss of white adipose tissue and impaired adipogenesis in culture, whereas the expression of C/EBPα in fibroblasts and preadipocytes facilitates adipogenesis (13Lin F.T.

Studies examining the effects of the rapidly induced C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ have demonstrated that loss of function of one or both of these factors can lead to decreased adipose mass in mice and decreased adipogenesis in cellular models (19Tanaka T.

Although C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ appear to have some compensatory, synergistic, and overlapping functions, C/EBPβ appears to have the greater effect on adipocyte development and lipid accumulation (13Lin F.T.

Here we examine the control of DGAT2 expression during adipogenesis and, for the first time, define a transcriptional mechanism for the regulation of its expression, demonstrating a key role for the C/EBP family of transcription factors. Preadipocyte Isolation and Culture—Murine preadipocyte isolation, culture, and differentiation were performed as described previously (23Jitrapakdee S. Slawik M. Medina-Gomez G. Campbell M.

Human preadipocytes were grown from the stromovascular fraction of collagenase-digested abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue as previously described (24Laudes M. Christodoulides C. Sewter C.

At various times following induction of differentiation, cells were harvested, and RNA was extracted. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were maintained and differentiated as described in a previous study (25Rochford J.J. Semple R.K. Laudes M. Boyle K.B. Christodoulides C. Mulligan C. Lelliott C.J. Schinner S. Hadaschik D. Mahadevan M. Sethi J.K. Vidal-Puig A. O'Rahilly S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 9863-9872Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 preadipocytes constitutively expressing the liver inhibitory protein (LIP) isoform of C/EBPβ were generated as follows: LIP cDNA was amplified by PCR using a forward primer immediately upstream of the LIP initiating ATG and using the pMT2-C/EBPβ expression vector (generously provided by Drs. Q.-Q. Tang and M. D. Lane). This was subcloned into pBabe retroviral vector, which was then used to generate retrovirus in HEK293-BOSC cells and to subsequently infect 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Mock transfected 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were generated with the same protocol using empty pBabe vector. Cells stably expressing eight-twenty one/MTG8 (ETO) were as previously described (25Rochford J.J. Semple R.K. Laudes M. Boyle K.B. Christodoulides C. Mulligan C. Lelliott C.J. Schinner S. Hadaschik D. Mahadevan M. Sethi J.K. Vidal-Puig A. O'Rahilly S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 9863-9872Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Differentiating 3T3-L1 cells were assessed for lipid content by staining with oil-red O as in a previous study (25Rochford J.J. Semple R.K. Laudes M. Boyle K.B. Christodoulides C. Mulligan C. Lelliott C.J. Schinner S. Hadaschik D. Mahadevan M. Sethi J.K. Vidal-Puig A. O'Rahilly S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 9863-9872Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). siRNA Knockdown—Synthetic double-stranded siRNA against C/EBPβ or C/EBPα mRNAs were purchased from Ambion. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were plated at a density 1 × 105 cells per well in 12-well plates the day before siRNA transfection. siRNA/liposome mixes containing 2 μg of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and 100 nm of siRNA/well were incubated with cells for 6 h in the absence of serum. Medium was replaced with serum containing 3T3-L1 growth medium for 18 h before the induction of differentiation. RNA Isolation, cDNA Synthesis, and Real-time PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cell cultures using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Adipose tissue was isolated from C/EBPβ-null mice or their wild-type littermates as previously described (26Liu S. Croniger C. Arizmendi C. Harada-Shiba M. Ren J. Poli V. Hanson R.W. Friedman J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). All procedures were approved by the University Colorado Health Sciences Center Animal Care and Use Committee. Frozen adipose tissue samples were first minced finely with scissors, then RNA was isolated according to the RNeasy kit protocol (Qiagen). Samples were eluted in 50 μl of RNase free H2O, and RNA concentration was determined by GeneQuant (Amersham Biosciences). The quality of extracted RNA was assessed by formaldehyde gel electrophoresis. Primer Express, version 1.0 software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Applied Biosystems) was used to design the probes and primers for real-time quantitative PCR to determine DGAT2, DGAT1, C/EBPβ, and 11βHSD1 mRNA expression. The primer/probe mix to assay C/EBPα was obtained from Applied Biosystems. RNA was reverse-transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primers (Promega, Madison, WI). The resulting cDNA was used in 12-μl PCR reactions, in which 300 nm of forward and reverse primers and, where applicable, 150 nm of fluorogenic probe were used in combination with ABI TaqMan or SYBR green master mix (Applied Biosystems). Reactions were carried out in duplicate for each sample on an ABI 7900 sequence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The relative quantities of amplified cDNAs were analyzed by using SDS software (Applied Biosystems), and target values were normalized to 18 S rRNA (tissue samples) or cyclophilin A mRNA (cell culture samples). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Post-confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes differentiated for various times were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride before being scraped and centrifuged at 1200 rpm at 4 °C. The cell pellet was subjected to crude nuclear protein preparation using a cytosolic and nuclear protein extraction kit (Pierce). An electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed using a LightShift chemiluminescence electrophoretic mobility shift assay kit (Pierce). The probes were prepared by annealing complementary oligonucleotides with their 3′-end labeled with biotin. The oligonucleotides sequences were as follows: C/EBPα promoter C/EBP binding site, 5′-CAGTGGGCGTTGCGCCACGATCTCTCT; DGAT2 putative site 1 C/EBP site, 5′-ACACGTCTATTGGCCAATCTACCGT. The DNA-protein binding was performed at room temperature for 20 min in a final volume of 20 μl containing 1× binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol), 2.5% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 8 pmol of double-stranded biotinylated probe, and 10 μg of nuclear extract. The DNA-protein complexes were separated by 5% PAGE in 0.5× TBE (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA) at 200 V at 4 °C for 2 h. DNA-protein complexes in gel were transferred to Hybond N nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by electroblotting with 0.5× TBE at 350 mA for 1.5 h. DNA-protein complexes were fixed to the membrane by UV cross-linker and detected by a nonradioactive nucleic acid detection kit (Pierce). For the competition assay, 20× more concentrated double-stranded DNAs were included in the binding reaction. Where appropriate, 2 μl of anti-C/EBPβ (C-19) or anti-C/EBPα antibody (14AA) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were preincubated in the binding reaction for 10 min before the probe was added. ChIP Assay—3T3-L1 preadipocytes in 35-mm wells were differentiated for various times as indicated. The DNA and protein were cross-linked in situ with 0.5% (v/v) formaldehyde at 37 °C for 5 min. Soluble chromatin was prepared using a ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). The lysate was sonicated four times for 10 s at 4 °C. The lysates were precipitated with either 5 μl of anti-C/EBPβ (C-19) or anti-C/EBPα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight before protein A-agarose beads were added. The proteins were removed from DNA by digesting with 10 μg/ml proteinase K at 45 °C for 30 min. The DNA was further purified by using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The DNA was eluted in 50 μl of sterile water. Two microliters of eluted DNA was used to assay the presence of DNA sequences associated with the immunoprecipitated proteins using specific primers amplifying DNA sequences, including the binding sites being assayed and SYBR green master mix according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Values obtained from immunoprecipitated samples were normalized to those from input samples. Western Blotting—Protein samples were extracted by scraping in lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, followed by sonication as described previously (25Rochford J.J. Semple R.K. Laudes M. Boyle K.B. Christodoulides C. Mulligan C. Lelliott C.J. Schinner S. Hadaschik D. Mahadevan M. Sethi J.K. Vidal-Puig A. O'Rahilly S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 9863-9872Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). After centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 × g, samples of supernatant containing 30 μgof protein were denatured and analyzed by Western blotting. All antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. To determine the expression of DGAT1 and DGAT2 during adipogenesis, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were induced to differentiate, and DGAT1 and DGAT2 expression was assayed by real-time PCR. Both DGAT1 and DGAT2 mRNA were induced with a similar time course, with a minor increase in expression in the first few hours following induction, and strong and sustained increase of mRNA occurring within 3 days. Of the two isoforms, DGAT2 showed a much greater increase, with an ∼200-fold induction within 3 days, whereas DGAT1 expression increased by <10-fold (Fig. 1A). To determine whether the induction of DGAT2 also occurred when isolated mouse preadipocytes undergo differentiation, we next examined DGAT2 expression in cells isolated from the stromovascular fraction of mouse white adipose tissue, induced to differentiate in culture. In a manner similar to differentiating 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, DGAT2 expression increased significantly 2 days following induction of differentiation with maximal induction apparent after 4–6 days (Fig. 1B). To extend these observations we next determined DGAT2 expression in differentiating human preadipocytes. Cultures of cells isolated from the stromovascular fraction of abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue were induced to differentiate for various times, and the expression of DGAT2 mRNA was determined (Fig. 1C). Again, a strong and significant up-regulation of DGAT2 expression was observed within 3 days of the induction of differentiation. This demonstrates that the induction of DGAT2 expression in the 3T3-L1 model recapitulates not only murine, but also human adipogenesis, and that DGAT2 may be an important enzyme of adipocyte triglyceride synthesis in humans as well as mice. Given the physiological importance of DGAT2, apparent from the phenotype of DGAT2-null mice, the strong induction of this isoform during adipogenesis and yet the lack of knowledge about the regulation of its expression, we decided to investigate its regulation in developing adipocytes further. To identify potential transcriptional mechanisms by which DGAT2 is regulated during adipogenesis we first examined published microarray data of gene expression over an extended time course of 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation. This revealed that the temporal regulation of DGAT2 very closely mimicked that of C/EBPα and 11βHSD1 (27Soukas A. Socci N.D. Saatkamp B.D. Novelli S. Friedman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34167-34174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), both well characterized targets of C/EBPβ (28Tang Q.Q. Jiang M.S. Lane M.D. Mol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 30232-30239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Despite the rapid induction of C/EBPβ during adipogenesis, the appearance of C/EBPα is characteristically delayed. Initially C/EBPβ is unable to bind the C/EBPα promoter due, at least in part, to the inhibitory actions of CHOP10 and/or ETO (25Rochford J.J. Semple R.K. Laudes M. Boyle K.B. Christodoulides C. Mulligan C. Lelliott C.J. Schinner S. Hadaschik D. Mahadevan M. Sethi J.K. Vidal-Puig A. O'Rahilly S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 9863-9872Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 30Tang Q.Q. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12446-12450Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Subsequently C/EBPβ binds promoter sequences in a repressed complex containing HDAC1 and Sin3a, before finally becoming an active complex 48–72 h following induction (31Tang Q.Q. Lane M.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2231-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 32Wiper-Bergeron N. Wu D. Pope L. Schild-Poulter C. Hache R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2135-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Because the characteristically delayed time course of C/EBPα expression was shared by DGAT2 mRNA, this led us to speculate that C/EBPβ may also have a key role in the regulation of its expression. This is also consistent with the observation that inhibition of C/EBPβ in 3T3-L1 adipogenesis significantly inhibits lipid accumulation in these cells. To test this hypothesis we generated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes constitutively expressing the naturally occurring inhibitory form of C/EBPβ, LIP. LIP lacks the transactivating domain of the transcriptionally active LAP (liver activating protein) forms of C/EBPβ but contains the leucine zipper and DNA binding motifs, allowing it to bind to C/EBPβ target sites and prevent binding by active forms of C/EBPβ (Fig. 2A) (33Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Expression of C/EBPβ was assessed in mock or LIP-transfected 3T3-L1 preadipocytes during differentiation by Western blotting. In the LIP-transfected cells, LIP expression was increased prior to the induction of differentiation to levels similar to the maximum level observed in mock transfected cells once differentiation had been induced (Fig. 2B). Consistent with this, following induction of differentiation, LIP expression in LIP-overexpressing cells rose to levels approximately twice those in mock transfected cells. We next assessed the effect of LIP expression on lipid accumulation by staining cells with oil-red O 8 days following induction of differentiation in the presence or absence of the PPARγ agonist BRL49653 (Invitrogen). Consistent with previous studies, LIP expression almost completely inhibited the accumulation of lipid (Fig. 2C). Indeed, even BRL49653-treatment, which enhanced lipid accumulation in mock transfected cells, was only able to induce very slight lipid accumulation in LIP cells. The expression of PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 was reduced by 57 and 60%, respectively, on day 3 of differentiation in these cells (Fig. 2, D and E). Thus even pharmacological activation of the significant residual PPARγ expressed was unable to overcome the inhibitory effects of LIP expression. We next assessed the expression of C/EBPα and 11βHSD1 in LIP cells. The induction of both these genes was significantly impaired in the LIP cells when compared with the mock transfected cells (Fig. 2, F and G). Subsequent analysis of DGAT2 expression in these cells demonstrated that this was particularly strongly inhibited by LIP expression, which caused a reduction in DGAT2 mRNA of 87% at day 3 and 77% at day 6 (Fig. 2F) (compared with reductions of 52 and 63% in C/EBPα expression at these time points). We also determined the expression levels of several other genes regulated during adipogenesis. At day 3 of differentiation, LIP expression led to reductions of 56% in aP2, and 56% in fatty acid synthase, only 14% in carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2, and no inhibition of the induction of the adiponectin receptor 2 (data not shown). The differences in the magnitude of inhibition observed for each of these genes probably reflects the complex cross-regulated nature of the adipogenic transcription cascade. However, the data also strongly suggest that C/EBPβ has an important role in the regulation of DGAT2 in addition to its more general effects on adipogenesis per se. We have previously demonstrated that the transcriptional corepressor ETO functions as an inhibitor of C/EBPβ (25Rochford J.J. Semple R.K. Laudes M. Boyle K.B. Christodoulides C. Mulligan C. Lelliott C.J. Schinner S. Hadaschik D. Mahadevan M. Sethi J.K. Vidal-Puig A. O'Rahilly S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 9863-9872Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, we next examined the effect of ETO expression on DGAT2 expression. As with the inhibition of C/EBPβ activity by LIP expression, constitutive ETO expression significantly inhibits lipid accumulation during 3T3-L1 adipogenesis (Fig. 3A). However, the expression of ETO does not affect the expression of C/EBPβ in these cells (Fig. 3B). Predictably, due to its inhibition of C/EBPβ activity, ETO expression inhibited both C/EBPα (Fig. 3C) and 11βHSD1 (Fig. 3D) mRNA expression. Moreover, the induction of DGAT2 mRNA was significantly impaired by ETO expression, again suggesting a role for C/EBPβ in DGAT2 expression (Fig. 3E). The LIP isoform of C/EBPβ is known to affect the expression of genes regulated by other C/EBP isoforms by binding to DNA sequences that are also capable of binding C/EBPβ. In addition, although we have demonstrated that ETO affects C/EBPβ activity, the specificity of ETO is not yet completely defined. Thus we next sought to specifically interfere with C/EBPβ by using siRNA to inhibit its expression. Transfection of preadipocytes with C/EBPβ siRNA resulted in a significant and sustained inhibition of C/EBPβ, reducing expression levels at day 1 post-induction by >60% and at day 3 by >50% (Fig. 4A). Analysis of C/EBPβ protein showed that this translated to a dramatic reduction of C/EBPβ protein in cells transfected with C/EBPβ siRNA (Fig. 4B). We next assessed the effect of C/EBPβ knockdown on lipid accumulation. Oil-red O staining demonstrated that specific loss of C/EBPβ significantly impairs the accumulation of lipid in a similar manner to LIP or ETO expression (Fig. 4C). Analysis of C/EBPα (Fig. 4D), 11βHSD1 (Fig. 4E), and DGAT2 (Fig. 4F) mRNA demonstrated that all showed significantly reduced induction in cells tr"

At pause sites, a fraction of the elongating complex (EC) is temporarily halted (delayed in the addition of the next nucleotide). At the his pause site, which occurs in the leader region of the histidine biosynthetic operon of Escherichia coli, RNAP pauses until a translating ribosome is able to direct transcription readthrough or termination in response to the level of charged histidyl-tRNA (1Yanofsky C.

This pause signal is multipartite and involves several nucleic acid segments that contact RNAP in the paused transcription complex (PTC): (i) a pause RNA hairpin, (ii) spacer RNA between the hairpin and the hybrid, (iii) the RNA:DNA hybrid, and (iv) duplex DNA downstream of the pause site (3Lee D.N.

Cell. 2003; 12: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The pause mechanism remains incompletely understood, in part due to the difficulty of assembling pure populations of PTCs in vitro using DNA, RNA, and RNAP. During active transcription, PTCs form from an intermediate in the nucleotide addition cycle, which begins by translocation to shift the RNA 3′ nt from the substrate site (called the A or i + 1 site) in a pretranslocated EC to the product site (P or i site) in a posttranslocated EC with concomitant forward translocation of RNAP along the DNA chains. The rest of the cycle consists of NTP binding, catalysis, and pyrophosphate release to generate a new pretranslocated EC. PTCs appear to form when interactions of RNAP with the pause signal components in the pretranslocated EC create a change in the active site that transiently delays nucleotide addition without affecting the translocation register (8Toulokhonov I. Landick R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Three classes of pause signals have been recognized based on different mechanisms of prolonging the pause. Class I pauses are stabilized by the interaction of a nascent RNA hairpin with the RNAP flap and clamp domains (9Artsimovitch I. Landick R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7090-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Class II pauses are stabilized by RNAP backtracking along the RNA and DNA chains (9Artsimovitch I. Landick R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7090-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 10Artsimovitch I. Landick R.

Cell. 1998; 1: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Class III pauses are stabilized by the interaction of dissociable factors with RNAP (e.g. σ70 with RNAP shortly after promoter escape) (12Ring B.Z. Yarnell W.S. Roberts J.W. Cell. 1996; 86: 485-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The his pause (Class I) is stabilized by the interaction of a 5-bp stem, 8-nt loop pause RNA hairpin that forms 11 nt from the paused transcript 3′ end and contributes a factor of ∼10 of an overall 100–1000-fold decrease in the nucleotide addition rate. In addition, the duration of the his pause can be increased ∼2–4-fold by the elongation factor NusA, which interacts with the pause hairpin and with RNAP (7Toulokhonov I. Artsimovitch I. Landick R. Science. 2001; 292: 730-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 9Artsimovitch I. Landick R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7090-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The his PTC remains pretranslocated but is resistant to pyrophosphorolysis, which ordinarily occurs rapidly in pretranslocated complexes (8Toulokhonov I. Landick R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This suggests that the active site of the his PTC is altered such that catalysis is blocked. Methods that allow direct reconstitution of PTCs without nucleotide addition or with a limited number of nucleotide addition steps would avoid the heterogeneity in ECs that occurs when transcription is initiated from a promoter and instead allow formation of homogeneous populations of PTCs. Daube and von Hippel (13Daube S.S. von Hippel P.H. Science. 1992; 258: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) first demonstrated reconstitution of active ECs in vitro by incubating RNAP with a preformed RNA/DNA scaffold that forms a synthetic transcription bubble. ECs have been reconstituted in vitro to study active, nonpaused ECs with many of the same characteristics as elongation complexes initiated from a promoter (14Sidorenkov I. Komissarova N. Kashlev M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 55-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 15Wilson K.S. Conant C.R. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1179-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the kinetic properties of reconstituted ECs have not been characterized. It is not known if reconstituted ECs are kinetically homogeneous and if PTCs can be reconstituted directly without prior nucleotide addition. In this report, we describe two methods to reconstitute PTCs: direct reconstitution and limited step reconstitution assay (LSRA). We characterized the kinetic species present in the population of reconstituted complexes by assaying nucleotide addition rates and the properties of reconstituted PTCs (rPTCs) compared with promoter-initiated his PTCs. We use rPTCs to address several fundamental questions about contributions of nucleic acid architecture to pausing, the ability of rPTCs to respond to protein elongation factors, and the possible role of PPi in pausing.

PTC Reconstitution and Gel Shift Assay—The nucleic acid scaffolds for reconstituting PTCs were assembled in reconstitution buffer (RB; 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.9, 40 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2) by heating 5′-32P-labeled RNA 29 (Table 1, 4865, 5.0 μm), tDNA (Table 1, 4891, 2.5 μm), and ntDNA (Table 1, 5051, 12.5 μm) containing an 11-nt noncomplementary region (bubble) to 75 °C for 2 min, rapidly cooling to 45 °C, and then cooling to room temperature in 2 °C/2-min steps as described previously (14Sidorenkov I. Komissarova N. Kashlev M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 55-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of paused and nonpaused ECs was performed by incubating core E. coli RNAP (2.5 μm) with the nucleic acid scaffold in RB for 10 min at 37 °C as described (13Daube S.S. von Hippel P.H. Science. 1992; 258: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). When fully complementary DNA strands were used, RNA and tDNA were preannealed and incubated with RNAP at room temperature for 10 min followed by incubation with ntDNA for an additional 10 min at 37 °C. PTC reconstitution was monitored by gel shift assay by electrophoresing an aliquot of rPTCs on a 4–15% native polyacrylamide Phast gel (GE Healthcare). The gel was exposed to a PhosphorImager screen and quantitated using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). In Vitro Nucleotide Addition Assays—Pause assays using promoter initiated ECs (template DNA from pIA171) were performed as described previously (6Artsimovitch I. Landick R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3110-3122Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The nucleotide addition assay was performed using rPTCs with 5′-32P-labeled RNA oligonucleotide. The rPTCs were diluted in RB to contain 25–50 nm rPTCs and elongated with GTP (10 μm) and ATP (100 μm) at 37 °C. Samples were removed at predetermined times, quenched with an equal volume of 2× loading dye (8 m urea, 50 mm EDTA, 90 mm Tris-borate buffer, pH 8.3, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 0.02% xylene cyanol), and analyzed by denaturing 15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For experiments in Fig. 2, ECs were formed using 5′-32P-labeled RNA27 or RNA28 and elongating them in the presence of CTP and UTP to make U29 rPTCs in a limited-step transcription assay (5Wang D. Meier T.I. Chan C.L. Feng G. Lee D.N. Landick R. Cell. 1995; 81: 341-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). When NusA was added, rPTCs were preincubated with NusA for 5 min at 37 °C followed by the addition of NTPs. Aliquots were removed at predetermined time intervals, and samples were processed as described above. LSRA—C28 ECs were formed using LSRA by first reconstituting G27 complexes as above using unlabeled RNA27, tDNA, and ntDNA (4867, 4891, and 5069, respectively; Table 1) and 3′-labeling the transcript by including [α-32P]CTP (specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol; 2 μm) in the reconstitution reaction (Figs. 3, 5, and 6). The labeled C28 ECs were then diluted in transcription buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 130 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.15 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 25 μg of acetylated bovine serum albumin/ml) to 25–50 nm and elongated in the presence of GTP (10 μm) and UTP (100 μm). LSRA offers many advantages for characterization of pausing. Only active ECs are visualized, and the rates of pause formation, pause escape, and pause bypass all can be measured at a wide range of substrate concentrations.FIGURE 5NusA enhanced pausing by rPTCs.

Pause half-life was measured as in Fig. 3 and plotted relative to rPTCs using the DNA scaffold (ntDNA, 5069; tDNA, 4891; and RNA27, 4867; t½ = 74 ± 6 s).

ECs were reconstituted using DNA oligonucleotides with different lengths of DNA downstream of the pause site (DS; 15 bp tDNA/ntDNA, 4891/5069; DS 25 bp, 4897/5072; DS 35 bp, 4901/5073; DS 50 bp, 5040/5075; Table 1) and RNA that can form a 9-bp hybrid at the pause (RNA27, 4867). C, effect of RNA:DNA hybrid length on pause escape. ECs were reconstituted with scaffolds containing 15 bp of downstream DNA and RNA that can form an 8-bp (ntDNA/tDNA/RNA, 5051/4891/4870), 9-bp (5069/4891/4867), 9*-bp (5069/5420/5422), 10-bp (5069/5420/4867), 10*-bp (5069/4891/5422), or 11-bp (5051/5421/4867) RNA:DNA hybrid.

Reactions were performed for predetermined times at 37 °C, and samples were quenched with 2 m HCl and immediately neutralized to pH 8.0 with 3 m Tris. The RNA was phenol-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, suspended in 1× loading dye, and fractionated on a denaturing 17.5% polyacrylamide gel. Each time point represents a separate reaction on the quenched-flow apparatus. Pyrophosphorolysis and GreB Cleavage Assay—Pyrophosphorolysis was performed on rPTC29 and rEC14 by incubating rPTCs/rECs (∼100 nm) with PPi (1 mm) in RB at 37 °C. Aliquots were removed at the indicated times and quenched with an equal volume of 2× loading dye and analyzed by denaturing 15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. GreB-mediated transcript cleavage of rPTC29 was performed by incubating rPTC29 (∼100 nm) with GreB (4 μm) in RB at 37 °C. At the indicated times, aliquots were removed, and samples were processed as for the pyrophosphorolysis assay. Data Quantitation and Analysis—Gels were exposed to storage phosphor screens and quantitated using a Typhoon PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). The 29-mer pause RNA (U29) present in each lane was quantitated as a fraction of the total RNA in each lane (U29-A37 for direct reconstitution (Fig. 1); C28-G31 for LSRA (all other figures)) and corrected for the fraction remaining in the chase lane. The rate of pause escape was determined by nonlinear regression of [U29] versus time with either single or double exponential decay (see “Results”). PTCs Can Be Directly Reconstituted in Vitro Using Hairpin-containing RNA—To reconstitute the his PTC, we first tested a minimal scaffold patterned after the known pause signal components (pause hairpin, 2-nt spacer, 9-bp RNA:DNA hybrid, ∼15-bp of downstream DNA; Fig. 1A) (3Lee D.N. Phung L. Stewart J. Landick R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15145-15153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Chan C.L. Landick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 25-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 7Toulokhonov I. Artsimovitch I. Landick R. Science. 2001; 292: 730-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 17Lee D.N. Landick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 759-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The 29-mer RNA contained the 18-nt his pause RNA hairpin but lacked RNA upstream of the hairpin. EC reconstitution was performed by incubating RNAP with a preformed RNA/DNA scaffold containing an 11-nt bubble (Fig. 1A; see “Experimental Procedures”) (13Daube S.S. von Hippel P.H. Science. 1992; 258: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The resulting ECs were tested by electrophoretic shift of the 32P-labeled nucleic acid scaffold on a native polyacrylamide gel and also for ability to elongate the RNA in the presence of GTP and ATP to yield an RNA product 8 nt longer (Fig. 1, A and B). Under these conditions, ∼40% of the labeled DNA/RNA scaffold reconstituted with RNAP to form an EC that migrated slowly on a native polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 1 and 2). The RNA not shifted was either not incorporated into an EC or failed to anneal to the DNA strands. A fully complementary nontemplate strand yielded slightly lower efficiency (30%) (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 2 and 3). The amount of rPTCs able to extend the labeled RNA in the presence of GTP and ATP was similar to the amount that shifted in the gel shift assay when either noncomplementary or fully complementary nontemplate strands were used (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 2 and 5 with lanes 3 and 6). Since the amount of RNA that does not reconstitute into PTCs can be corrected for mathematically, we avoided perturbing the PTCs with techniques to remove the unbound scaffold. The synthetic transcription bubble present in the nucleic acid scaffold introduces energetic barriers to transcription downstream of the site of reconstitution that become manifested as RNA products shorter than the expected 37-mer RNA (Fig. 1B, lane 5). These shorter products only arose when scaf-folds containing an artificial transcription bubble were used (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 5 and 6) and probably were caused by the inability of the upstream edge of the bubble to reanneal at these positions. Similar barriers to transcription have been observed on templates with synthetic bubbles created using noncomplementary nontemplate strands (18Ryder A.M. Roberts J.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Since we needed to measure the rate of the addition of only the first nucleotide, these barriers did not pose a problem for our experiments (see below), since their effects were manifest only after RNAP had added 5 nt to the RNA. In Vitro Reconstituted his PTCs Were Kinetically Similar to PTCs Initiated at a Promoter—The reconstituted his PTCs exhibited kinetic properties similar to PTCs initiated from a promoter. Incubation of the rPTCs with GTP (10 μm) and ATP (100 μm) resulted in RNA extension (Fig. 1C). The amount of unextended RNA expressed as a fraction of the total in each lane after correcting for RNA not incorporated into ECs (Fig. 1C, lane C) was plotted as a function of time (Fig. 1C). A large fraction (∼0.9) of the hairpin-containing PTCs elongated with a slow rate (kobs, 0.011 ± 0.003 s-1; t½, 63 ± 17 s), similar to prior observations for escape from the his pause (range of t½, 50–85 s) (6Artsimovitch I. Landick R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3110-3122Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 9Artsimovitch I. Landick R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7090-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). We confirmed this finding by measuring the pause half-lives of rPTCs and promoter-initiated PTCs in reaction mixtures containing both complexes together (t½ for both complexes = 72 ± 4 s; data not shown). Further, there was no significant difference in the kinetics of pause escape whether the PTCs were reconstituted on the partially noncomplementary (bubble) or fully complementary scaffolds (Fig. 1C). PTCs Reconstituted Directly at the Pause Site or Upstream of the Pause Site Behaved Similarly—Because all previously studied PTCs were formed by synthesis of RNA preceding the pause site, we wanted to confirm that PTCs formed directly at the pause site in the absence of NTPs mimicked natural PTCs. To that end, we compared pause escape in ECs reconstituted at the pause site using RNA29 with ECs reconstituted with the 3′ nt one or two positions before the pause site (RNA28 and RNA27, respectively) (Fig. 2), using a limited step transcription assay. The RNA27- and RNA28-containing complexes were assembled in the absence of NTPs and then advanced to the pause site at position U29 by incubating with UTP (RNA28) or with CTP and UTP (RNA27). Comparison of the kinetics of pause escape by these complexes revealed no significant differences in the rate of escape from the pause (Fig. 2; kobs, ∼0.01 s-1), indicating that the behavior of these complexes at the pause is the same regardless of how they reached the pause site. We note that this may not be true of backtracked pause sites. This is important, because PTCs formed by direct reconstitution cannot contain PPi, whereas those formed upstream of the pause site could contain PPi, which conceivably could be important in PTC formation. LSRA Revealed the Effect of the Pause Hairpin—Since disruption of the hairpin in promoter-initiated PTCs reduces pausing by a factor of ∼10 (6Artsimovitch I. Landick R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3110-3122Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we wanted to test if the same is true for rPTCs that lack the RNA upstream of the hairpin ordinarily present in PTCs initiated from a promoter. To accomplish this, we adapted the limited-step transcription assay (5Wang D. Meier T.I. Chan C.L. Feng G. Lee D.N. Landick R. Cell. 1995; 81: 341-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) to allow labeling of only active ECs (see “Experimental Procedures”), thereby allowing more accurate quantitation and measurement of both PTC formation and pause escape. We call this method LSRA. LSRA also allows ECs to be reconstituted upstream of the pause site, thus avoiding the complication of backtracking when PTCs lacking a hairpin are reconstituted directly at the pause. We could then use LSRA to test the contribution of the hairpin to pausing at the his pause site. A 27-mer RNA that forms the pause RNA hairpin with a 3′-end located 2 nt upstream of the pause site (RNA27, Fig. 3A) was labeled by incorporating [α-32P]CMP during reconstitution (Fig. 3B; LSRA step 1) and then elongated through the pause site in the presence of UTP and GTP to make the 31-mer RNA product (Fig. 3B; LSRA step 2). rPTCs formed in step 2 of LSRA escaped from the pause at a single rate (kobs, 0.01 ± 0.002 s-1; t½, 78 ± 8 s), similar to rPTCs formed by direct reconstitution (Fig. 1). This result rules out a transient contribution of PPi to pause lifetime, such as might occur if slow PPi release were rate-limiting for pause escape in the LSRA but absent in the direct reconstitution assay (Fig. 1). To determine the contribution of the hairpin, we measured the rate of pause escape using ECs containing a 12-mer RNA that lacked the pause hairpin (RNA 12, Fig. 3A). Based on previous results (5Wang D. Meier T.I. Chan C.L. Feng G. Lee D.N. Landick R. Cell. 1995; 81: 341-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), we expected the no-hairpin RNA to generate PTCs but to escape ∼10-fold faster than hairpin-containing PTCs. We also expected some fraction of the PTCs to bypass the pause site. Indeed, a significant fraction of the no-hairpin PTCs escaped from the pause site at a rapid rate that could only be measured using a quenched-flow apparatus (see “Experimental Procedures”). ECs containing the 12-mer RNA escaped from the pause site with at least three different rates (Fig. 3C), suggesting the presence of at least three kinetically distinguishable populations. The species that escaped with the slowest rate (kobs, 0.09 s-1) constituted 60% of the population and was still ∼10-fold faster than the rate of escape from the pause site in the presence of the hairpin. Thus, the rPTCs exhibit a pause hairpin effect comparable with our previous estimate of the hairpin effect in promoter-initiated PTCs (4Chan C.L. Landick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 2"
https://openalex.org/W1967560850,"O-Mannosyl glycans are important in muscle and brain development. Protein O-mannosyltransferase (POMT) catalyzes the initial step of O-mannosyl glycan biosynthesis. To understand which serine (Ser) and threonine (Thr) residues POMT recognizes for mannosylation, we prepared a series of synthetic peptides based on a mucin-like domain in α-dystroglycan (α-DG), one of the best known O-mannosylated proteins in mammals. In α-DG, the mucin-like domain spans amino acid residues 316 to 489. Two similar peptide sequences, corresponding to residues 401–420 and 336–355, respectively, were strongly mannosylated by POMT, whereas other peptides from α-DG and peptides of various mucin tandem repeat regions were poorly mannosylated. Peptides 401–420 and 336–355 contained four and six Ser and Thr residues, respectively. Substitution of Ala residues for the Ser or Thr residues showed that Thr-414 of peptide 401–420 and Thr-351 of peptide 336–355 were prominently modified by O-mannosylation. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and Edman degradation analysis of the mannosylated peptide 401–420 indicated that Thr-414 was the Thr residue that was most prominently modified by O-mannosylation and that O-mannosylation occurred sequentially rather than at random. Based on these results, we propose a preferred amino acid sequence for mammalian O-mannose modification. O-Mannosyl glycans are important in muscle and brain development.

Thus, O-mannosylation is indispensable for normal structure and function of α-DG in muscle and brain in human. We recently demonstrated that formation of a POMT1-POMT2 complex was required for POMT activity (10Akasaka-Manya K. Manya H. Nakajima A. Kawakita M. Endo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19339-19345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). POMT1 and POMT2 are homologous to members of the family of protein O-mannosyltransferases (PMTs) in yeast. PMTs were shown to catalyze the transfer of a mannosyl residue from dolichyl phosphate mannose to Ser/Thr residues of certain proteins (11Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gentzsch M. Tanner W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Individual PMTs have different specificities for protein substrates (12Gentzsch M. Tanner W. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 13Lehle L. Strahl S. Tanner W. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2006; 45: 6802-6818Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), suggesting the presence of some sequence for recognition by PMTs, but the sequence was not identified. On the other hand, in mammals, O-mannosylated proteins are rare and O-mannosylation may require a specific sequence because we detected POMT activity when a glutathione S-transferase-fused mucin-like domain of α-DG (amino acid residues 316–489) was used as an acceptor (6Manya H.

Previous studies suggested that the mucin-like domain is highly glycosylated and that certain glycans of α-DG play an important role in its binding to ligand proteins such as laminin, neurexin, and agrin (2Chiba A.

To address the biological function and regulation of O-mannosylation, it is important to determine whether there is a preferential amino acid sequence. In this study we synthesized a series of peptides that fully covered the mucin-like domain of α-DG (Fig. 1). Then we examined whether these peptides worked as acceptors for protein O-mannosylation. Further, the enzymatic products were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and Edman degradation to determine the number of mannose residues transferred and the sites to which they were transferred. Based on the results of these studies, we proposed a preferred sequence for mammalian O-mannosylation. Chemicals—Synthetic peptides were purchased by made-to-order system on the web site of Sigma-Aldrich (www.genosys.jp, Tokyo, Japan), and the quality of the synthesis was ascertained by HPLC analysis and mass spectrometry. A series of peptides, whose average length is ∼20 amino acids, fully covered the mucin-like domain of α-DG (Table 1). Triton X-100 was purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). n-Octyl-β-d-thioglucoside was from Dojindo Laboratories (Kumamoto, Japan).

The filtrate and washings were combined and concentrated to solid, which was chromatographed on Sephadex G-50 (eluent: water) to give O-(α-d-mannopyranosyl)-l-threonine (170 mg, quantitative). The structure was identified by 1H-NMR and MALDI-TOF MS. Mannosyl peptide 401–420(T414Man) (IRPTMTIPGYVEPT(Man)AVATPP) was synthesized essentially as described in our previous report (18Takahashi S.

The structure was identified by 1H-NMR and MALDI-TOF MS. POMT Enzyme Source—The microsomal membrane fraction of human embryonic kidney 293T cells co-transfected by POMT1 and POMT2 was used for POMT enzyme source. A cDNA containing the most common splicing variant of human POMT1 (which lacks bases 700–765, corresponding to amino acids 234–255) and human POMT2 cDNA were cloned into pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen) as described previously (6Manya H.

Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Expression plasmids were transfected into human embryonic kidney 293T cells using Lipofectamine plus regent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were incubated for 3 days at 37 °C to produce POMT1 and POMT2 proteins. The cells were homogenized in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol with a protease inhibitor mixture (3 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine-HCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After centrifugation at 900 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The precipitate was used as the microsomal membrane fraction. Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay. Assay for POMT Activity—POMT activity was based on the amount of [3H]mannose transferred from mannosylphosphoryldolichol to synthetic peptides.

After boiling for 3 min, the mixture was analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC with a Wakopak 5C18–200 column (4.6 × 250 mm; Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) or a Mightysil RP-18GP Aqua column (4.6 × 250 mm; Kanto Chemical Co., Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Solvent A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in distilled water, and solvent B was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. The peptide was eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a linear gradient of 1–50% solvent B. The peptide separation was monitored continuously at 215 nm, and the radioactivity of each fraction was measured using a liquid scintillation counter. Peptide Sequencing and Mass Spectrometry—A mannosylated peptide 401–420 was prepared using concanavalin A (Con A)-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) as follows. The reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 μm unlabeled mannosylphosphoryldolichol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% n-octyl-β-d-thioglucoside, 1 mm peptide 401–420; 120 μg of microsomal membrane fraction in 30 μl of total volume was incubated for 15–120 min at 25 °C. The reaction mixture was mixed with 400 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2 and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was loaded onto the Con A-Sepharose column (100 μl of bed volume) and washed with 2 ml of the same buffer. The bound fraction was obtained by eluting with 250 μl of 200 mm α-methylmannoside in 20 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2 and separated by reversed-phase HPLC as described above. Con A-purified mannosyl peptide preparation was fractionated by reversed-phase HPLC on an Inertsil ODS-3 column (1 × 100 mm; GL Sciences Inc., Tokyo) with a model 1100 series liquid chromatography system (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). Mannosyl peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 20 μl/min using a linear gradient of 0–50% solvent B, where solvents A and B were 0.085% (v/v) aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and 0.075% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 80% (v/v) acetonitrile, respectively. Three peptides thus obtained were subjected to Edman degradation using a Procise HT protein sequencing system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). “Cart pulsed liquid” and “Flask normal” were used for default programs of reaction and conversion cycle, respectively. At proline residues (3rd, 8th and 13th), the “Cart PL Proline” program was used for reaction cycles. Except for 8-mm peptide supports (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA), all sequence programs and reagents were supplied by Applied Biosystems. To reduce chemicals and background peaks, the chromatogram of the previous cycle was subtracted from one of the current cycle with the 610A data analysis system (Applied Biosystems) using the “Subtraction Mode”. To identify mannosyl-threonyl residue, 100 pmol of synthetic mannosyl-threonine was subject to protein sequencer. The peaks of 3-phenyl-2-thiohydantoin-mannosyl-threonine and related molecule were eluted on the first cycle of the sequencer. A MALDI-TOF mass spectrum was obtained on a Ultraflex mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) in a reflector mode using 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as a matrix. For MS/MS spectra, parent ion was selected ± 15 Da from the observed MH+ value using time gate and re-accelerated (LIFT mode). Detection of POMT Activity against Various Peptides—We previously detected POMT activity when POMT1 and POMT2 were co-expressed in human embryonic kidney 293T cells using glutathione S-transferase-α-DG as an acceptor (6Manya H. Chiba A. Yoshida A. Wang X. Chiba Y. Jigami Y. Margolis R.U. Endo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 500-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined whether or not synthetic peptides worked as an acceptor. We prepared nine ∼20-amino acid peptides that covered the mucin-like domain of α-DG (Fig. 1). When we measured the POMT activity using these peptides, these peptides were mannosylated to different degrees. The peptide sequence 401–420 worked as a prominent acceptor, followed by the peptide sequence 336–355 (Fig. 2). The POMT activity was 4.03 pmol/h/mg total protein against peptide 401–420 and 2.32 pmol/h/mg total protein against peptide 336–355. The POMT activities against the other peptides were less than peptide 401–420 and 336–355 (<0.63 pmol/h/mg total protein), suggesting the occurrence of α-DG peptide-specific O-mannosylation. Mucin type O-linked glycosylation is initiated by the action of a family of UDP-GalNAc, polypeptides N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (pp-GalNAc-T), which catalyze the transfer of GalNAc from the nucleotide sugar UDP-GalNAc to the hydroxyl group of either Ser or Thr. Peptides derived from the tandem repeat region of mucins, which have a high density of Ser/Thr, were utilized efficiently by all pp-GalNAc-Ts (19Ten Hagen K.G. Fritz T.A. Tabak L.A. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 1R-16RCrossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether or not several peptides of mucin tandem repeat regions worked as an acceptor of O-mannosylation (Fig. 1B). Among these peptides, MUC2 and MUC3 showed slight POMT activities (0.7 and 0.49 pmol/h/mg total protein, respectively). These results indicated that mucin peptides worked as poor acceptors for O-mannosylation, suggesting that there are preferred protein sequences for O-mannosylation. Kinetics Analysis of POMT Activity against Various Peptides—Among seven peptides (peptides 336–355, 364–383, 385–403, 401–420, 451–470, MUC2, and MUC3) examined, peptides 336–355 and 401–420 had the lowest Km values (0.63 and 0.73 mm, respectively) (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). The Km/Vmax values for peptides 336–355 and 401–420 were 0.16 and 0.10, respectively, and the Km/Vmax values for other peptides were 8 times higher than that of peptide 336–355. These results suggest that the affinities of POMT for peptides 336–355 and 401–420 are comparable and that peptides 336–355 and 401–420 are the most suitable acceptors for POMT reaction under these experimental conditions. Substrate Specificities and Effect of Change of Amino Acids of Peptides—Peptide 336–355 and peptide 401–420 have six and four potential O-mannosylated Ser and Thr residues, respectively (Fig. 1B). To elucidate which Ser or Thr was preferentially modified by O-mannosylation, each Ser or Thr of the peptides was changed to Ala one by one and then the O-mannosylation efficiencies of the mutated peptides were examined. Six mutated peptides were prepared from peptide 336–355 and four peptides were prepared from peptide 401–420 (Fig. 3A). For peptide 336–355, changing Ser-336 or Ser-344 to Ala did not affect the acceptor efficiency of the peptides, whereas changing Thr-341 or Thr-351 to Ala greatly reduced the acceptor efficiency (by 71.7 and 85.1%, respectively) and changing Thr-343 or Thr-353 to Ala moderately reduced the acceptor efficiency (by 48.5 and 39.8%, respectively) (Fig. 3B). For peptide 401–420, changing Thr-418 to Ala slightly affected the acceptor efficiency, whereas changing Thr-404, Thr-406, or Thr-414 to Ala greatly reduced the acceptor efficiency (by 82.3, 69.7, and 92.7%, respectively) (Fig. 3C). The results indicate that Thr-351 of peptide 336–355 and Thr-414 of peptide 401–420 were prominently modified by O-mannosylation. Next, to elucidate the preference of O-mannosylation of Ser and Thr residues, four Thr residues of peptide 401–420 were changed to Ser (Fig. 3A, peptide T-S) and then the O-mannosylation efficiency of peptide T-S was examined. Changing Thr to Ser reduced the acceptor efficiency by 62.2% (Fig. 3C). This result indicates that the POMT O-mannosylates both Thr and Ser but prefers Thr to Ser. Interestingly, peptides 336–355 and 401–420 have similar sequences. In an alignment analysis of these peptides and adjacent amino acid residues (Fig. 3D), the two sequences have nine identical amino acids (indicated by asterisks) and seven similar amino acids (indicated by dots). Taken together, these results indicate that the similar O-mannosylation efficiencies of the two peptides are due to the similarity of their sequences. Next, we tried to identify a consensus sequence for O-mannosylation. First, to examine the necessity of C-terminal Pro-Pro and N-terminal Ser-Arg, we prepared peptide 338–357 (Fig. 4A). The POMT activity against peptide 338–357 was almost the same as the activity against peptide 336–355 (by 97.8%) (Fig. 4B). This result indicates that the C-terminal Pro-Pro and N-terminal Ser-Arg have a negligible effect on O-mannosylation efficiency. Then we examined the contribution of nonidentical amino acids between peptides 336–355 and 401–420 on O-mannosylation. To address this question, we prepared peptide X-A in which Ala was substituted for all nonidentical amino acids (Fig. 4A). The mutated peptide X-A reduced the acceptor efficiency by 46.2% (Fig. 4B), suggesting that nonidentical amino acids also are important for efficient O-mannosylation. Then we prepared the peptide 338–355 XA in which Ala-342 was reverted to Pro and Ala-353 was reverted to Thr (indicated by asterisks). The reverted peptide 338–355 XA restored the acceptor efficiency to 89.3% of peptide 336–355. Taken together, these results suggest that the identical amino acid sequence between peptide 401–420 and peptide 336–355 is necessary for efficient O-mannosylation and that (IXPT(P/X)TXPXXXXPTX(T/X)XX) is a consensus sequence for O-mannosylation. MALDI-TOF MS Analysis and Edman Degradation Analysis—The enzymatic products of peptide 401–420 were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS and Edman degradation to determine the number of attached mannose residues and their sites of attachment. The mannosylated peptides from the POMT reaction using peptide 401–420 as an acceptor were purified by Con A-Sepharose column followed by reversed-phase HPLC. The POMT reaction mixture showed several peaks around 22∼23 min (supplemental Fig. S2A). A large peak at 23 min derived from the original peptide 401–420 was obtained from the unbound fraction of the Con A-Sepharose column (supplemental Fig. S2B, indicated by closed triangle). Three peaks around 22–23 min recovered from the bound fraction of the Con A-Sepharose column appear to be mannosyl peptides (supplemental Fig. S2C, indicated by open triangle). The purified mannosylated peptides were subjected to MS analysis (Fig. 5). The monoisotoic mass value calculated from the peptide 401–420 is 2111.1 for (M+H)+. On the other hand, the spectrum of the products showed three m/z values for (M+H)+ of 2597.3, 2435.2, and 2273.2, suggesting that three, two, and one mannosyl residues have been transferred to the peptide, respectively (Fig. 5A). Then each peak was subjected to MS/MS analysis to determine the sites of attachment by mannose. MS/MS with selection of the ion at m/z 2597 resulted in detection of a demannosylated ion m/z 2438 (peptide 401–420 + 2Man) and b-series ion m/z 1685 (b12, peptide 401–412 + 2Man). MS/MS with selection of the ion at m/z 2435 resulted in detection of ions m/z 2274 (peptide 401–420 + Man) and m/z 1522 (b12, peptide 401–412 + Man). MS/MS with selection of the ion at m/z 2273 resulted in detection of ions m/z 2113 (peptide 401–420) and m/z 1358 (b12, peptide 401–412) (Fig. 5B). These results indicated that the POMT enzymatic products of peptide 401–420 have three, two, and one Man residues. Analysis of the amino acid sequences of these mannosylated peptides to determine the mannosylated Thr residues (supplemental Fig. S3) showed that the mono-mannosylated peptide was mannosylated mainly at Thr-414 and slightly at Thr-404 and Thr-406, the di-mannosylated peptide was mannosylated at Thr-406 and Thr-414, and the tri-mannosylated peptide was mannosylated at Thr-404, Thr-406, and Thr-414. These results indicate that 1) Thr-414 was the residue that was most frequently modified by O-mannosylation, 2) Thr-404 and Thr-406 were sequentially mannosylated after Thr-414, and 3) Thr 418 was not mannosylated. To confirm the conclusions, we performed a time course study of O-mannosylation. As shown in supplemental Fig. S4, mono-mannosylated peptide appeared at the early stage of the reaction (∼15 min), and then the amount of di- and tri-mannosylated peptides increased at later stages. Taken together, these results indicate that O-mannosylation did not occur at random but occurred sequentially. Effect of Mannosylation of Thr-414 on Substrate Efficiency—To examine whether the presence of mannose on the peptide affects O-mannosylation efficiency, we synthesized a monomannosyl peptide (IRPTMTIPGYVEPT(Man)AVATPP, named as peptide 401–420(T414Man)) and compared kinetic parameters with peptide 401–420 (supplemental Fig. S5). The Km value for peptide 401–420(T414Man) (0.01 mm) was remarkably lower than that of peptide 401–420 (0.73 mm), and the Vmax value for peptide 401–420(T414Man) (9.63 pmol/h/mg) was higher than that of peptide 401–420 (7.11 pmol/h/mg). These results indicate that the mannosylation of Thr-414 in peptide 401–420 facilitates subsequent mannosylation. In this study, we identified a preferred amino acid sequence for mammalian O-mannosylation using a series of synthetic peptides whose sequences were derived from the mucin-like domain of human α-DG. Our data show that the peptide sequences 336–355 and 401–420 from α-DG are suitable acceptors for O-mannosylation, whereas other sequences including various mucin tandem repeat regions were poor acceptors. Interestingly, peptides 336–355 and 401–420 had very similar amino acid sequences and had comparable Km values. These findings suggest that these peptides have the same affinity for POMT and have what appears to be a consensus sequence (IXPT(P/X)TXPXXXXPTX(T/X)XX) for mammalian O-mannosylation. The positions of Pro and Thr residues in the two peptides are especially similar. A BLAST search for proteins with this sequence turned up only α-DG, suggesting that the primal O-mannosylated protein is α-DG. We found that Thr residues modified by O-mannosylation in the peptides 336–355 and 401–420 were mannosylated sequentially rather than at random. The substitution analysis showed that Thr-341, Thr-343, Thr-351, and Thr-353 of peptide 336–355 and Thr-404, Thr-406, and Thr-414 of peptide 401–420 are mannosylated (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the effectiveness of substituted Thr depended on the position; the third Thr residues from the N terminus of these peptides (Thr-351 and Thr-414) were most effective, followed by the first Thr residues (Thr-341 and Thr-404) and then the second Thr residues (Thr-343 and Thr-406). These results indicate that three Thr residues in the consensus sequence are necessary for O-mannosylation. Because the third and first Thr residues in the peptides 336–355 and 401–420 are located next to a Pro residue, POMT may prefer a PT motif as an acceptor. The result that the acceptor efficiency of peptide 338–355 XA is higher than that of peptide X-A (Fig. 4) also suggests the presence of a PT motif is necessary for preferential O-mannosylation. However, the PT motif by itself does not seem to be enough for effective O-mannosylation. Although several of the peptides shown in Fig. 1B have a PT motif, some of them did not work as an acceptor at all and others worked poorly as acceptors (Figs. 1B and 2, and Table 1). These results suggest that the preferential common sequence for effective O-mannosylation is present in peptides 336–355 and 401–420. Indeed, the presence of a Thr residue that is preferentially mannosylated was confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS analysis and amino acid sequence analysis of mannosylated peptides. We obtained mono-, di-, and tri-mannosyl peptides from peptide 401–420. Analysis of these products showed that a mono-mannosylated peptide was mannosylated mainly at Thr-414 and a di-mannosylated peptide was mannosylated at Thr-406 and Thr-414, and Thr-404 is the last of the Thr residues to be O-mannosylated. These results indicate that O-mannosylation of the Thr residues is highly ordered. Furthermore, peptide 401–420(T414Man) was a more effective acceptor than peptide 401–420, indicating that the mannosylation of Thr-414 leads to effective subsequent O-mannosylation. Therefore, α-DG appears to be a prominent acceptor of O-mannosylation because it has both the PT motif and the preferential sequences. O-GalNAc glycosylation is the most common protein modification and is initiated by the action of a family of pp-GalNAcTs. Rules are thought to exist that specify which Ser and Thr residues become decorated with O-GalNAc. However, despite intense investigation, no consensus sequence has emerged that is both necessary and sufficient for O-GalNAc glycosylation to occur. Many nuclear and cytosolic proteins are O-GlcNAc glycosylated at a variety of attachment sites, but a consensus sequence for O-GlcNAc transferase has not been reported (20Vosseller K. Wells L. Hart G.W. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 21Wells L. Vosseller K. Hart G.W. Science. 2001; 291: 2376-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). On the other hand, O-Fuc glycosylation exists in direct O-linkage to Ser or Thr residues in two different types of Cys knot motifs, epidermal growth factor-like repeats and thrombospondin type 1 repeats. The enzyme responsible for adding O-Fuc to epidermal growth factor repeats was identified as protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1), and the enzyme for adding to thrombospondin type 1 repeats was identified as POFUT2 (22Wang Y.

A consensus sequence for O-Fuc glycosylation in epidermal growth factor is proposed, CysX4–5(Ser/Thr)Cys between the second and third Cys residues, and a consensus sequence for O-Fuc in thrombospondin type 1 repeats is TrpX5CysX2/3Ser/ThrCysX2G between the first and second Cys residues, respectively (24Harris R.J.

Proteomics. 2002; 1: 11-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Both POFUT1 and POFUT2 require a specific sequence for O-Fuc glycosylation. Our results indicate that α-DG has preferred sequences for O-mannosylation. However, it may be that the efficiency of O-mannosylation depends not only on the sequence but also the secondary and tertiary structures. Protein O-mannosylation is an essential post-translational modification (5Endo T. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 21: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In yeast and fungi, protein O-mannosylation is indispensable for cell wall integrity and normal cellular morphogenesis (11Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gentzsch M. Tanner W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Protein O-mannosylation has also been suggested to be involved in the endoplasmic reticulum quality control system. In yeast, protein O-mannosylation is necessary for intracellular protein trafficking (11Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gentzsch M. Tanner W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 27Proszynski T.J. Simons K. Bagnat M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1533-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For example, it was found that nonnative proteins are O-mannosylated in the endoplasmic reticulum, which causes them to be excreted from the cell without aggregation and accumulation of aberrant proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (28Harty C. Strahl S. Romisch K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1093-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 29Nakatsukasa K. Okada S. Umebayashi K. Fukuda R. Nishikawa S. Endo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49762-49772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These results suggest that O-mannosyltransferases can recognize proteins that have undergone a conformational change. Thus, the conformation of a protein is another factor for O-mannosylation. O-Mannosylation is an uncommon type of protein modification in mammals, but it is important in muscle and brain development (5Endo T. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 21: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although highly glycosylated α-DG was found to be selectively deficient in the skeletal muscle of WWS (7Beltran-Valero De Bernabe D.

Genet. 2005; 42: 907-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), little is known about the molecular pathomechanism of WWS. Our results show that two peptides derived from the mucin domain of α-DG are highly O-mannosylated by POMT but that little or no O-mannosylation occurs in mucin tandem repeat peptides, suggesting that α-DG has multiple O-mannosylated glycans but other proteins have little, if any. The binding of ligands to glycans is known to depend on how the glycans are clustered. Binding of extracellular matrixes such as laminin, neurexin, and agrin may require a cluster of O-mannosyl glycan on α-DG. Therefore, a defect of O-mannosyl glycans in patients with WWS may severely affect α-DG functions but not other protein functions. Future studies may reveal how α-DG glycosylation contributes to muscular dystrophy and neuronal migration disorder and how normal glycosylation can restore functions of DG. Such studies may lead to the development of therapies for incomplete glycosylation-induced dystroglycanopathies. We thank Fumihiko Ito for assistance in synthesizing mannosyl-threonine.

https://openalex.org/W2141188924,"The early visual areas have a clear topographic organization, such that adjacent parts of the cortical surface represent distinct yet adjacent parts of the contralateral visual field. We examined whether cortical regions outside occipital cortex show a similar organization.The BOLD responses to discrete visual field locations that varied in both polar angle and eccentricity were measured using two different tasks. As described previously, numerous occipital regions are both selective for the contralateral visual field and show topographic organization within that field. Extra-occipital regions are also selective for the contralateral visual field, but possess little (or no) topographic organization. A regional analysis demonstrates that this weak topography is not due to increased receptive field size in extra-occipital areas.A number of extra-occipital areas are identified that are sensitive to visual field location. Neurons in these areas corresponding to different locations in the contralateral visual field do not demonstrate any regular or robust topographic organization, but appear instead to be intermixed on the cortical surface. This suggests a shift from processing that is predominately local in visual space, in occipital areas, to global, in extra-occipital areas. Global processing fits with a role for these extra-occipital areas in selecting a spatial locus for attention and/or eye-movements."
https://openalex.org/W1966235159,"Absorption of a photon by a vertebrate opsin pigment induces 11-cis to all-trans isomerization of its retinaldehyde chromophore. Restoration of light sensitivity to the bleached opsin requires chemical re-isomerization of the chromophore via an enzyme pathway called the visual cycle. The retinoid isomerase in this pathway is Rpe65, a membrane-associated protein in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) with no predicted membrane-spanning segments. It has been suggested that Rpe65 is S-palmitoylated by lecithin:retinol acyl transferase (LRAT) on Cys231, Cys329, and Cys330, and that this palmitoylation is required for isomerase activity and the association of Rpe65 with membranes. Here we show that the affinity of Rpe65 for membranes is similar in wild-type and lrat–/– mice. The isomerase activity of Rpe65 is also similar in both strains when all-trans-retinyl palmitate is used as substrate. With all-trans-retinol substrate, isomerase activity is present in wild-type but undetectable in RPE homogenates from lrat–/– mice. Substitution of Cys231, Cys329, and Cys330 with Ser or Ala did not affect the affinity of Rpe65 for membranes. Further, these Cys residues are not palmitoylated in Rpe65 by mass spectrometric analysis. Global inhibition of protein palmitoylation by 2-bromopalmitate did not affect the solubility or isomerase activity of Rpe65. Finally, we show that soluble and membrane-associated Rpe65 possesses similar isomerase specific activities. These results indicate that LRAT is not required for isomerase activity beyond synthesis of retinyl-ester substrate, and that the association of Rpe65 with membranes is neither dependent upon LRAT nor the result of S-palmitoylation. The affinity of Rpe65 for membranes is probably an intrinsic feature of this protein.

The light-absorbing chromophore in most vertebrate opsins is 11-cis-retinaldehyde (11-cis-RAL). 2The abbreviations used are: 11-cis-RAL, 11-cis-retinaldehyde; RPE, retinal pigment epithelium; LRAT, lecithin:retinol acyl transferase; WT, wild-type; 11-cis-ROL, 11-cis-retinol; all-trans-ROL, all-trans-retinol; all-trans-RP, all-trans-retinyl palmitate; all-trans-RE, all-trans-retinyl ester; all-trans-RAL, all-trans-retinaldehyde; LCA, Leber congenital amaurosis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DTT, dithiothreitol; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. Capture of a photon by an opsin pigment induces 11-cis to all-trans isomerization of the retinaldehyde chromophore. After a brief period of activation, the bleached pigment dissociates to yield apoopsin and free all-trans-retinaldehyde (all-trans-RAL). Restoration of light sensitivity to the apo-opsin requires chemical regeneration of 11-cis-RAL via an enzyme pathway called the visual cycle (Fig. 1). Most steps in this pathway take place within cells of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which directly overlay the photoreceptors. Following its release by photoreceptors, all-trans-retinol (all-trans-ROL) is taken up by RPE cells and esterified to a fatty acid from phosphatidylcholine in internal membranes by lecithin:retinol acyl transferase (LRAT) (1Saari J.C. Bredberg D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8636-8640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The retinoid isomerase uses an all-trans-retinyl ester (all-trans-RE), such as all-trans-retinyl palmitate (all-trans-RP) as substrate (2Gollapalli D.R. Rando R.R.

The final catalytic step in the visual cycle involves oxidizing the 11-cis-retinol (11-cis-ROL) product of the isomerase to 11-cis-RAL (6Driessen C.A. Janssen B.P.

Newly synthesized 11-cis-RAL is released by the RPE and taken up by photoreceptors where it combines with apo-opsin to form a new light sensitive pigment molecule. The retinoid isomerase was recently identified as an abundant 63-kDa protein in RPE cells called Rpe65 (8Jin M. Li S. Moghrabi W.N. Sun H. Travis G.H. Cell. 2005; 122: 449-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 9Moiseyev G. Chen Y. Takahashi Y. Wu B.X. Ma J.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Al-Babili S. Beyer P. Schulz G.E. Science. 2005; 308: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). By x-ray diffraction analysis, apo-carotene oxygenase is a seven-bladed β-propeller (12Kloer D.P. Ruch S. Al-Babili S. Beyer P. Schulz G.E. Science. 2005; 308: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). A similar structure is predicted for Rpe65 (13Guo H. Zheng C. Gaillard E.R. J. Theor. Biol. 2006; 242: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Rpe65 associates with membranes, although it contains no predicted transmembrane segments (14Tsilou E. Hamel C.P. Yu S. Redmond T.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 346: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This association was shown to result from S-palmitoylation of residues Cys231, Cys329, and Cys330 (15Xue L. Gollapalli D.R. Maiti P. Jahng W.J. Rando R.R. Cell. 2004; 117: 761-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), which are on or near the protein surface (13Guo H. Zheng C. Gaillard E.R. J. Theor. Biol. 2006; 242: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The acyl-transferase responsible for palmitoylation of Rpe65 is thought to be LRAT (15Xue L. Gollapalli D.R. Maiti P. Jahng W.J. Rando R.R. Cell. 2004; 117: 761-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A “palmitoylation switch” mechanism for the regulation of isomerase activity was proposed whereby binding of Rpe65 to its all-trans-RP substrate is mediated by reversible S-palmitoylation of these three Cys residues (15Xue L. Gollapalli D.R. Maiti P. Jahng W.J. Rando R.R. Cell. 2004; 117: 761-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Mice with a knock-out mutation in the gene for LRAT contained only trace levels of all-trans-RE in the eye (16Batten M.L. Imanishi Y. Maeda T. Tu D.C. Moise A.R. Bronson D. Possin D. Van Gelder R.N.

Chem. 2005; 280: 40226-40234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Although blood levels were nearly normal, all-trans-ROL was dramatically reduced in the eyes of lrat–/– mice, and the other visual retinoids, including 11-cis-ROL and 11-cis-RAL, were undetectable (16Batten M.L. Imanishi Y. Maeda T. Tu D.C. Moise A.R. Bronson D. Possin D. Van Gelder R.N. Baehr W. Palczewski K. J. Biol.

These results establish that LRAT is required for the uptake of all-trans-ROL from blood into ocular tissues. The absence of 11-cis-retinoids in these animals is also consistent with the hypothesis that isomerase activity is dependent on LRAT. In the current study we examined the role of LRAT on isomerase activity and the solubility of Rpe65. We show that isomerase activity is normal in lrat–/– mice. Further, we show that the association of Rpe65 with membranes is not dependent upon LRAT, and that the soluble and membrane-associated forms of Rpe65 possess similar isomerase activities. Finally, we show that the association of Rpe65 with membranes is not affected by amino acid substitutions that block palmitoylation at positions 231, 329, and/or 330. Mice and Bovine Eyes—Mice with a knock-out mutation in the gene for LRAT (16Batten M.L. Imanishi Y. Maeda T. Tu D.C. Moise A.R. Bronson D. Possin D. Van Gelder R.N. Baehr W. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10422-10432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) were generously provided by Krzysztof Palczewski. Wild-type (WT) mice (strain 129S2/Sv) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. We determined the rpe65 genotype at codon 450 by DNA sequencing. Only WT and lrat–/– mice homozygous for the normal (Leu450) allele of rpe65 were used in this study. All animal experiments followed procedures approved by the UCLA Animal Research Committee. Mice were maintained in 12-h cyclic light at ∼30 lux. Bovine eyes were from freshly slaughtered cattle (<4 h) and kept on ice until dissection. Preparation of Cell Homogenates, Membrane Pellets, and Membrane-free Supernatants from Mouse and Bovine RPE—After removal of the anterior section, vitreous, and neural retina, the RPE and choroid of mouse or bovine eyes were homogenized in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5 (60 μl per eye for mouse and 1.0 ml per eye for cow). Samples were centrifuged 10 min at 400 × g and 4 °C to remove cell debris. The resulting low speed supernatants represent RPE cell homogenates. The homogenates were diluted with buffer to yield protein concentrations of 1–3 mg/ml. A portion of each homogenate was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g, 4 °C to pellet the membranes. The resulting ultrasupernatants represent membrane-free supernatant fractions. The membrane pellets were resuspended in same volume of HEPES buffer containing 0.1% SDS. All samples were irradiated for 10 min on ice with 365-nm light from a Spectroline Model EN-140L ultraviolet light source to destroy endogenous retinoids. The protein contents in the preparations were determined using the Micro BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce). Proteins (50 ng to 5.0 μg) from the homogenate and the identical volume of membrane-free supernatant were analyzed by immunoblot analysis using an antibody against bovine Rpe65 (see below). Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK-293T (293T) cells stably expressing LRAT (293T-L) or LRAT plus CRALBP (293T-LC) (8Jin M. Li S. Moghrabi W.N. Sun H. Travis G.H. Cell. 2005; 122: 449-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 units per ml penicillin G and 100 μg per ml streptomycin) at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The 293T, 293T-L, and 293T-LC cells were transfected using PolyFect reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s procedure. Site-directed Mutagenesis of Bovine RPE65 cDNA—The complete coding region of the bovine RPE65 cDNA was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector, pRK5. Site-directed mutagenesis was done using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to yield cDNAs for Rpe65 with the indicated Cys-to-Ser or Cys-to-Ala substitutions. Following mutagenesis, all plasmid inserts were sequenced in both directions on an ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems/Hitachi) using DYEnamic ET Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kits (Amersham Biosciences). Plasmids for mammalian cell transfection were prepared using the PureLink Hipure plasmid miniprep or midiprep kit (Invitrogen). Assay for Membrane Association of Rpe65s in 293T and 293T-L Cells—Two days post-transfection with plasmids encoding normal or mutated Rpe65s, 293T and 293T-L cells from 100-mm culture dishes were washed twice in 10 ml of PBS, resuspended in 0.4 ml of ice-cold 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) containing 280 mm sucrose, 10 mm MgCl2 and protease-inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer. Protein concentration of each cell homogenate was adjusted to 1–3 mg/ml. A portion of each homogenate was centrifuged for 20 min at 1000 × g. The supernatants were collected and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The resulting ultra-supernatant represents the membrane-free fraction. The ultra-pellets were rinsed in the same buffer and suspended in the same volume of 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) containing 6 mm sodium cholate. 500 ng to 12 μg of proteins in the total cell homogenates and the identical volumes of the membrane-free supernatants were analyzed by immunoblotting with antisera against Rpe65. Extraction of Rpe65 Proteins from 293T Cell Membranes—The 293T cells grown in 100-mm dishes were transfected with expression plasmids for normal and Y368H-substituted Rpe65s. At 2-day post-transfection, the cells (from four dishes per plasmid construct) were washed twice in 40 ml of PBS by low speed centrifugation and frozen for 15 min at –85 °C. The cells were homogenized in 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) containing EDTA-free protease mixture (Roche Applied Science) and centrifuged for 30 min at 250,000 × g. After removing the supernatant, the pellets were washed three times in the same buffer by homogenization and repeat ultracentrifugation. Pellets from the final centrifugation were resuspended in 20 mm HEPES buffer containing 0.45 m NaCl and 0–10 mm sodium cholate (as indicated), and incubated on ice for 15 min to extract Rpe65 from the membranes. After centrifugation for 45 min at 250,000 × g, the supernatants were used for in vitro isomerase assays. Supernatants were also analyzed by immunoblotting (500 ng protein per lane) using antisera against Rpe65. Immunoblot Analysis—Proteins in Laemmli sample buffer were heated for 10 min at 75 °C, separated by SDS-PAGE in a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The membrane was incubated in blocking buffer (PBS pH 7.4, 5% nonfat milk) for 2 h at 37 °C, then overnight at 4 °C with rabbit polyclonal antiserum against the Rpe65 peptide, NFITKINPETLETIK (residues 150–163) (4Mata N.L. Moghrabi W.N. Lee J.S. Bui T.V. Radu R.A. Horwitz J. Travis G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 635-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In some experiments, polyclonal antiserum against human Fyn kinase (Abcam) was used. After washing three times in PBS for 10 min, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) or with IRDye 800CW-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (LI-COR Biosciences) for 1 h and washed again. Rpe65 that reacted with the antibodies was visualized with the enhanced ECL-Plus Western blot detection system (Amersham Biosciences), or by scanning the membrane in an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). The fluorescence intensity of each band was measured using Odyssey 2.1 software (LI-COR Biosciences). Preparation of Acrylamide-modified Bovine Rpe65—Microsomal proteins from bovine RPE, prepared as previously described (3Moiseyev G. Crouch R.K. Goletz P. Oatis Jr., J. Redmond T.M. Ma J.X. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2229-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) were dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.1% SDS (2.25 μg of protein/μl). To a 50-μl aliquot we added 20 μl of 50 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.4), and the solution was incubated at 70 °C for 3 h. To another 50-μl aliquot, we added 20 μl of 50 mm tributylphosphine (TBP) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.4), and the solution was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The DTT sample was then incubated with 20 μl of 250 mm acrylamide (AA-d0) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.4) at 25 °C for 3 h, while the TBP sample was incubated under the same conditions with 2,3,3-acrylamide-d3 (AA-d3) (Cambridge Isotope Lab) instead. These samples were pooled and separated by SDS-PAGE. We identified the prominent Rpe65 band (∼20 μg) in the lane by Rpe65-immunoblot analysis of a duplicate gel. In-gel Proteolytic Digestion of Rpe65—After dissecting the Rpe65-containing bands from the SDS gels, the gel slices were dehydrated in acetonitrile, following established procedures (18Jiménez C.R. Huang L. Qiu Y. Burlingame A.L. Current Protocols in Protein Science. 2002; 2 (Coligan, J. E., ed) Vol. , pp. .14.15, Wiley, New York: 16.14.11-16Google Scholar). An enzyme solution containing 200 ng modified trypsin (Promega) or 100 ng of endoproteinase Glu-C (Roche Applied Science) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) was added to the gel slices and the samples incubated at 37 °C for 15 h. Analysis of Peptides by Liquid Chromatography and Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry—Peptide samples following proteolytic digestion were separated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on an Agilent Zorbax 300SB-C18 column (250 H 0.5 mm, 5.0 μm) using an Agilent 1100 capillary liquid chromatograph. Eluent A was an aqueous solution of 0.1% formic acid and 0.005% heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA), and eluent B was an acetonitrile solution of 0.1% formic acid and 0.005% HFBA. The flow rate was 10 μl/min, and the gradient program was 5% B to 10% B for 7 min; 10% B to 40% B for 53 min; 40% B to 80% B for 30 min; 80% B for 10 min; 80% B to 5% B for 5 min. The injection volume was 20 μl. The elution profile was monitored by a Thermo Finnigan LCQ Deca XP ion trap mass spectrometer (MS) using electrospray ionization (ESI) in positive-ion mode with nitrogen as the sheath gas. The heated capillary temperature was 200 °C, the electrospray voltage was 5.20 KeV, and the capillary voltage was 44 V. Three scan events were used: (i) 500–2000 m/z full scan MS; (ii) data-dependent zoom scan on the most intensive ion from the MS full scan spectrum, and (iii) data-dependent full scan MS/MS on the most intensive ion from the MS full scan. The MS/MS collision energy was set to 35 V. When an m/z ratio for an ion was selected for data-dependent scan it was placed in a list and dynamically excluded for 1 min for further fragmentation. In Vivo Isomerase Assay in Cultured Cells—To analyze 11-cis-ROL synthesis in 293T-LC cells from all-trans-ROL substrate added to the medium, cells grown in 12-well culture plates (Corning) were transfected with expression plasmids for normal and mutated Rpe65 proteins using PolyFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). The amount of plasmid was adjusted to yield similar levels of the normal and substituted Rpe65 proteins (0.2–0.4 μg of DNA for normal and 0.8–1.6 μg for mutant plasmids). Thirty hours after transfection, cell media were replaced with fresh media containing 15% fetal bovine serum, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 25 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5). Under dim red light, all-trans-ROL in ethanol was added to the medium (5.0 μm final concentration), and the cells were incubated for an additional 18 h. After removing the medium, the cells were washed in 1.0 ml of PBS, pelleted by low speed centrifugation, and lysed in 0.4 ml of lysis buffer (0.2% SDS in 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5). Ten micrograms of protein from the cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti-Rpe65 antibody, as described above. For HPLC analysis, retinoids were extracted with hexane as previously described (8Jin M. Li S. Moghrabi W.N. Sun H. Travis G.H. Cell. 2005; 122: 449-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). In Vitro Isomerase Assay—The isomerase assay mixtures contained 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 6% bovine serum albumin, 10 μm all-trans-ROL, and 50–500 μg of protein. In some experiments, isomerase was assayed in the same buffer without added NaCl with no change in the observed activities. When all-trans-RP was used as a substrate, 6.0 mm sodium cholate was added to the reaction mixture. 50 μgof protein from bovine RPE homogenates and 150 μg of protein from mouse RPE homogenates were used in the isomerase assay with all-trans-ROL. 150 μg of protein from bovine RPE homogenates and 450 μg of protein from mouse RPE homogenates were used in assays with all-trans-RP substrate. 100–170 μg of protein solubilized from membranes of 293T cells expressing unsubstituted or Y368H-substituted Rpe65s were used for the isomerase assay. The final volume for each reaction was 400 μl. After incubation for 2 h in the dark at 37 °C, the reactions were quenched by adding 0.2% SDS and 2 volumes of methanol. Retinoids were extracted with hexane and analyzed by HPLC, as described below. Specific isomerase activities were calculated after subtracting endogenous 11-cis-ROL, determined by hexane extraction of representative reaction mixtures before addition of substrate. To determine the effect of LRAT on the substrate kinetics of Rpe65 isomerase, we performed the in vitro isomerase assay on RPE homogenates from WT and lrat–/– mice. The assay mixtures were as described above except that they contained 450 μg of mouse RPE protein, 9.0 mm sodium cholate, and 0–64 μm all-trans-RP substrate. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Inhibition of Protein Palmitoylation with 2-Bromopalmitate—After transfecting with the plasmid for bovine Rpe65, 293T-LC cells were incubated in medium containing 100 μm 2-bromopalmitate (2BP) for 8 h, as previously described (19Webb Y. Hermida-Matsumoto L. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 261-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 20Resh M.D. Methods. 2006; 40: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Control cells were treated similarly without addition of 2BP. The cells were washed in PBS, and homogenized in 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5). Aliquots of the homogenates containing 500 μg total protein were assayed for isomerase activity. To determine the effect of 2BP on Rpe65 and Fyn kinase solubility, total cell homogenates and membrane-free supernatants were prepared from Rpe65-expressing 293T-LC cells cultured in the presence or absence of 100 μm 2BP. Cell homogenates and membrane-free supernatants were prepared from these cells as described above, and identical fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting using antisera against bovine Rpe65 and human Fyn kinase, as described above. In Vitro LRAT Activity Assay—The activity of LRAT was determined by monitoring the formation of all-trans-RE from added all-trans-ROL. The 293T-L and 293T cells were homogenized in ice-cold 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5). The reaction mixture (volume 200 μl) contained 400 μg of protein, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 2.0 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm DTT, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 5.0 μm all-trans-ROL. The mixtures were incubated in the dark for 30 min at 37 °C. After quenching the reaction with addition of 4.0 μl of 10% SDS and 400 μl methanol, retinyl esters were extracted with 2.0 ml of hexane and analyzed by HPLC as described below. HPLC Analysis of Retinoids—Retinoids were analyzed by normal-phase HPLC as previously described (21Mata N.L. Radu R.A. Clemmons R. Travis G.H. Neuron. 2002; 36: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In brief, samples were dissolved in 200 μl of hexane, and retinoids were separated by chromatography on a silica column (Supelcosil LS-SI 5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm ID) by gradient elution of mobile phase (0.2–10% dioxane in hexane, 2.0 ml per min flow rate) in an Agilent 1100 liquid chromatograph equipped with a UV photodiode-array detector. Identified peaks were confirmed by spectral analysis and co-elution with authentic retinoid standards. Representative chromatograms and UV spectra acquired for 11-cis-ROL are shown in Fig. 2, D and E. Isomerase Activity Is Normal in Mice Lacking LRAT—It was previously shown that 11-cis-retinoids are undetectable in the eyes of lrat–/– mice (16Batten M.L. Imanishi Y. Maeda T. Tu D.C. Moise A.R. Bronson D. Possin D. Van Gelder R.N. Baehr W. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10422-10432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). This suggests that the isomerase, which synthesizes 11-cis-ROL (Fig. 1), requires LRAT for catalytic activity. To test this possibility, we measured isomerase kinetics in homogenates of WT and lrat–/– RPE using all-trans-RP as substrate. The maximum rate of 11-cis-ROL synthesis (Vmax) was 0.75 in WT and 0.61 pmol/min/mg-protein in lrat–/– RPE (Fig. 2, A and B). Thus, the presence of LRAT mildly stimulates isomerase activity. The measured Km of the isomerase was slightly higher in WT versus lrat–/– RPE (Fig. 2, A and B). This may reflect depletion of all-trans-RP substrate by LRAT through the reverse estersynthase reaction (22Saari J.C. Bredberg D.L. Farrell D.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We observed no synthesis of 11-cis-ROL from all-trans-ROL substrate by lrat–/– RPE homogenates, while WT RPE-homogenates synthesized 0.51 pmol/min/mg-protein (Fig. 2C). These results confirm that all-trans-RP is the substrate for the isomerase, and that LRAT is required to synthesize all-trans-RP from all-trans-ROL. In the absence of LRAT, however, isomerase activity is nearly normal. Affinity of Rpe65 for Membranes Is Not Dependent on LRAT—To determine the role of LRAT in the association of Rpe65 with membranes, we performed quantitative immunoblot analysis on 1.0-μl samples of total homogenates (1.0 μg/μl) from WT and lrat–/– mouse RPE. We compared the Rpe65 signals using a Licor Odyssey Infrared Fluorescent Imaging System (Table 1). The fraction of total Rpe65 associated with membranes was similar in WT and lrat–/– RPE (83.8% and 81.3%, respectively). Fig. 3, A and B show representative immunoblots from this experiment using ECL detection. To corroborate these results, we also did immunoblot analysis on membrane-free supernatants and total homogenates from WT and lrat–/– mouse RPE. The Rpe65 signals in lanes containing 5.0 μl of membrane-free supernatants were intermediate between the signals in lanes containing 0.5 and 4.0 μl of total RPE homogenates (1.0 μg/μl) from both WT and lrat–/– mice (Fig. 3, C and D). By this analysis, ∼15% of total Rpe65 was soluble in WT and lrat–/– mice. These results agree with the quantitative analysis of the membrane fractions, and show that the ratio of soluble to membrane-associated Rpe65 is similar in WT and lrat–/– mice.TABLE 1Quantitative immunoblot analysis of Rpe65 in mouse RPE fractionslrat-/- miceWild-type miceRPE total homogenate (1.0 μg)15.2 ± 4.411.3 ± 3.2RPE membranes (1.0 μg)12.4 ± 1.69.5 ± 1.6RPE membranes (1.5 μg)20.2 ± 2.115.3 ± 5.8 Open table in a new tab Palmitoylation of Residues Cys231, Cys329, or Cys330 Is Not Required for the Association of Rpe65 with Membranes—Rpe65 was suggested to undergo reversible, LRAT-mediated S-palmitoylation of residues Cys231, Cys329, and Cys330 (15Xue L.

https://openalex.org/W2010781201,"In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the nuclear-localized kinase, Lsk1p, promotes cytokinesis by positively regulating the Septation Initiation Network (SIN). Although a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) family, neither a cyclin partner nor a physiological target has been identified. In this report we identify a cyclin, Lsc1p, that physically interacts and co-localizes with Lsk1p. Furthermore, lsk1Δ, lsc1Δ, as well as kinase-dead lsk1-K306R mutants, display highly similar cytokinesis defects. Lsk1p is related to CDKs that phosphorylate the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest sub-unit of RNA polymerase II (Rpb1p). Interestingly, we find that Lsk1p and Lsc1p are required for phosphorylation of Ser-2 residues found in the heptad repeats of the CTD. To determine if Rpb1p could be a physiological target, we replaced the native rpb1 gene with a synthetic gene encoding a Rpb1p protein in which Ser-2 was substituted with the non-phosphorylatable amino-acid alanine in all heptads. Cells carrying this allele were similar to lsk1Δ mutants: They were viable, displayed genetic interactions with the SIN, and were unable to complete cytokinesis upon perturbation of the cell division machinery. We conclude that Ser-2 phosphorylation of the CTD heptads plays a novel physiological role in the regulation of cytokinesis."

In MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, the action of the PKC activator 4β-phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) evokes ceramide formation, which in turn prevents PKCα/βII translocation to the pericentrion. In this study we investigated the mechanisms by which ceramide negatively regulates this translocation of PKCα/βII. Upon PMA treatment, HEK-293 cells displayed dual phosphorylation of PKCα/βII at carboxyl-terminal sites (Thr-638/641 and Ser-657/660), whereas in MCF-7 cells PKCα/βII were phosphorylated at Ser-657/660 but not Thr-638/641. Inhibition of ceramide synthesis by fumonisin B1 overcame the defect in PKC phosphorylation and restored translocation of PKCα/βII to the pericentrion. To determine the involvement of ceramide-activated protein phosphatases in PKC regulation, we employed small interference RNA to silence individual Ser/Thr protein phosphatases. Knockdown of isoforms α or β of the catalytic subunits of protein phosphatase 1 not only increased phosphorylation of PKCα/βII at Thr-638/641 but also restored PKCβII translocation to the pericentrion. Mutagenesis approaches in HEK-293 cells revealed that mutation of either Thr-641 or Ser-660 to Ala in PKCβII abolished sequestration of PKC, implying the indispensable roles of phosphorylation of PKCα/βII at those sites for their translocation to the pericentrion. Reciprocally, a point mutation of Thr-641 to Glu, which mimics phosphorylation, in PKCβII overcame the inhibitory effects of ceramide on PKC translocation in PMA-stimulated MCF-7 cells. Therefore, the results demonstrate a novel role for carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation of PKCα/βII in the translocation of PKC to the pericentrion, and they disclose specific regulation of PKC autophosphorylation by ceramide through the activation of specific isoforms of protein phosphatase 1.

A major mechanism for activation of cPKCs and novel PKCs involves acute and reversible translocation to the plasma membrane of these isoenzymes in response to either diacylglycerol or its analog 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), and this occurs within 30 s to a few minutes after stimulation.

The formation of the pericentrion regulates endocytosis and results in sequestration of several recycling components, including membrane lipids (3Idkowiak-Baldys J. Becker K.P. Kitatani K.

Activation of this salvage pathway was implicated in preventing translocation of PKC to the pericentrion in response to PMA. The ability of ceramide to inhibit translocation of PKC to the pericentrion suggested that ceramide interfered with a key step involved in mediating the effects of PMA on PKC. Therefore, it became important to define the mechanism by which ceramide exerted its effects on PKC. Several enzymes have been shown to be activated in vitro by ceramide and have, thus, emerged as candidate transducers of ceramide action. These ceramide mediators include kinase suppressor of Ras (24Zhang Y. Yao B. Delikat S. Bayoumy S. Lin X.H. Basu S. McGinley M. Chan-Hui P.Y. Lichenstein H. Kolesnick R.

Given these considerations, it became important to determine the mechanisms by which PKCs translocate to the pericentrion and the mechanisms by which ceramide interferes with this process. In this study we employed HEK-293 and MCF-7 cells and investigated the mechanisms by which ceramide evokes a negative feedback pathway for cPKC translocation to the pericentrion. The results demonstrate a novel role for carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation sites (autophosphorylation sites) of cPKCs (43Flint A.J. Paladini R.D. Koshland Jr., D.E.

The culture media were removed, and the cells were washed rapidly three times with ice-cold PBS. Total cellular lipids were extracted by the modified method of Bligh and Dyer (65Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). Lipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography on a silica gel G plate with ethyl acetate/iso-octane/acetic acid (9:5:2, v/v/v) as the developing system (6Becker K.P. Kitatani K. Idkowiak-Baldys J. Bielawski J. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2606-2612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The plates were sprayed with EN3HANCE Spray (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to amplify the tritium signal and then exposed for autoradiography for 24 h. The area corresponding to phosphatidylbutanol was scraped off, and the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Western Blotting—Cells were washed three times with PBS supplemented with Halt™ phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Pierce) and then lysed using Laemmli buffer. The protein samples (20 μg) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 containing 5% nonfat dried milk, washed with PBS-Tween, and incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody for phospho-PKCα/βII (1:1000) or rabbit polyclonal antibody for PKCα (1:2000) in 0.1% Tween 20 containing 5% nonfat dried milk. The blots were washed with PBS-Tween and incubated with secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase in PBS-Tween containing 5% nonfat dried milk. Detection was performed using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent. Transfection with Small Interference RNA (siRNA)—Cells (2 × 105 cells/60-mm dish) were transfected with double-stranded siRNAs for individual isoforms of PP1 catalytic subunit (PP1c) or PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h transfection reagents were washed out, and cells were stimulated with PMA in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% FBS. Specific siRNAs for PP2Ac-β (sc-36301) and PP1c-β (sc-36295) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The other sequences of siRNAs for scrambled RNA, PP1c-α, and PP1c-γ were AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT, AAGCACGACTTGGACCTCATC, and AAGAGGCAGTTGGTCACTCTG, respectively. Effects of Ceramide on PLD Activation and GFP-PKCα Translocation in PMA-stimulated MCF-7 Cells—PLD activation has been shown to be required for the translocation of PKCα and/or PKCβII to the pericentrion in HEK-293 cells or COS-7 cells (5Becker K.P. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28251-28256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 7Hu T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35702-35708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In a previous study we showed that PKCβII failed to translocate to the pericentrion in MCF-7 (6Becker K.P. Kitatani K. Idkowiak-Baldys J. Bielawski J. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2606-2612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This inhibition was mediated by ceramide generated from the salvage pathway. Because ceramide was previously shown to inhibit PLD activation (39Venable M.E. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24800-24805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 40Nakamura Y. Nakashima S. Ojio K. Banno Y. Miyata H. Nozawa Y. J.

Blood. 1997; 89: 2139-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we wondered whether the effects of ceramide on PKC in MCF-7 cells are due to inhibition of PLD. MCF-7 cells labeled with [3H]palmitate were stimulated with PMA for 1 h in the presence of 0.4% 1-butanol, and then phosphatidylbutanol levels were determined as a measure of PLD activity. As shown in Fig. 1A, generation of phosphatidylbutanol was stimulated after PMA treatment. This stimulation was not affected by FB1. Under these conditions, FB1 inhibited ceramide formation and restored the translocation of GFP-PKCβII (6Becker K.P. Kitatani K. Idkowiak-Baldys J. Bielawski J. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2606-2612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). FB1 treatment also resulted in GFP-PKCα sequestration and colocalization with the Rab11-positive subset of the recycling compartment (Fig. 1B). These results show that 1) ceramide generated from the salvage pathway does not inhibit PLD and 2) the effects of ceramide on PKC translocation to the pericentrion are not due to inhibition of PLD. PKCα/βII Phosphorylation upon PMA Treatment in MCF-7 and HEK-293 Cells—Because activation of PLD by PMA appears to be a direct result of the action of PMA and the interaction of PKC with PLD, the above results suggested that the site of ceramide action is independent of PLD activation and may be at the level of PKC itself. The association of PKCα/βII with membranes has been shown to be modulated by specific phosphorylation of residues Thr-638/641 or Ser-657/660 that have been identified as autophosphorylation sites (Thr-641 in PKCβII corresponds to Thr-638 in PKCα, whereas Ser-660 in PKCβII corresponds to Ser-657 in PKCα) (44Keranen L.M.

The effects of PMA on the phosphorylation status of PKCα/βII were evaluated in both MCF-7 cells and HEK-293 cells, since PMA induces PKC translocation to the pericentrion in HEK-293 cells but not in MCF-7 cells (3Idkowiak-Baldys J.

Those two cell lines were treated with 100 nm PMA, and then acute phosphorylation of PKCα/βII at both Thr-638/641 and Ser-657/660 was assessed using two distinct antibodies targeting those sites; one antibody against Thr-638/641 is specific for PKCα/βII, whereas the second antibody against Ser-657/660 detects phosphorylation on both conventional and novel PKC. Using the last antibody, we were able to detect phosphorylation of overexpressed GFP-PKCα and GFP-PKCβII after PMA treatment in both cell lines (data not shown). This immunoreactivity does not negate phosphorylation of other PKC isoforms but clearly indicated phosphorylation of PKCα/βII at Ser-657/660 in those cell lines. PMA treatment of HEK-293 and MCF-7 over the indicated time course induced acute phosphorylation of PKCα/βII at both Thr-638/641 and Ser-657/660 in HEK-293 cells. By contrast, PKCα/βII phosphorylation at Thr-638/641 was not seen in PMA-stimulated MCF-7 cells (Fig. 2A). Because PKCβ was not detected in MCF-7 (49Ways D.K. Kukoly C.A. deVente J. Hooker J.L.

Within the cell, helicases process a range of nucleic acid sequences. It is not known whether this composite rate of moving and opening the strands of nucleic acids depends on the base sequence. Our presteady state kinetic studies of helicases from two classes, the ring-shaped T7 helicase and two forms of non-ring-shaped hepatitis C virus (HCV) helicase, show that both the unwinding rate and processivity depend on the sequence and decrease as the nucleic acid stability increases. The DNA unwinding activity of T7 helicase and the RNA unwinding activity of HCV helicases decrease steeply with increasing base pair stability. On the other hand, the DNA unwinding activity of HCV helicases is less sensitive to base pair stability. These results predict that helicases will fall into a spectrum of modest to high sensitivity to base pair stability depending on their biological role in the cell. Modeling of the dependence provided the degree of the active involvement of helicase in base pair destabilization during the unwinding process and distinguished between passive and active mechanisms of unwinding.

Helicases are proteins that translocate in one specific direction along the nucleic acid backbone to catalyze processes such as the separation of the complementary strands of a double helical nucleic acid, recombination of DNA molecules, or remodeling of proteins bound to nucleic acids (1Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 2Caruthers J.M. McKay D.B. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Helicases are referred to as motor enzymes, because they convert the chemical energy of NTP hydrolysis (a reaction with a negative ΔG) into mechanical force for motion and strand separation. It is not clear whether the force they generate is used predominantly to translocate on the nucleic acid or whether it is directed mainly at actively destabilizing and melting the double-stranded nucleic acid. It is also not known whether all helicases share a common mechanism or whether they act via different strategies to catalyze strand separation. Therefore, it is difficult to predict a priori whether and how the helicase activity would depend on nucleic acid base pair stability. Helicases encounter a range of nucleic acid sequences as they translocate on and unwind the strands of double-stranded DNA or RNA in the cell. It is well known that the base sequence dictates the stability of the double helical nucleic acid. The GC base pair in nucleic acids is more stable than the AT base pair. Similarly, the neighboring base sequences and the stacking energies between adjacent base pairs determine the overall stability of the double helical nucleic acid (6Felsenfeld G. Miles H.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1967; 36: 407-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). A strong dependence of helicase activity on base pair stability would adversely affect controlled biological processes, such as the coordination of leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis during genome replication or the repair and recombination of specific DNA sequences. On the other hand, the dependence of helicase activity on base pair stability provides specificity during processes such as replication initiation that is typically started by replicative helicases melting the AT-rich regions adjacent to replication initiation sites (7Cunningham E.L. Berger J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Helicases can be classified according to their quaternary structure as ring-shaped and non-ring-shaped. The ring-shaped helicases function as hexamers or dodecamers (8Li D. Zhao R. Lilyestrom W.

One of the two helicases that we have studied here, T7 helicase, is a ring-shaped hexameric helicase composed of noncovalently self-assembled identical subunits (21Egelman E.H. Yu X. Wild R.

The HCV NS3 protein contains helicase and protease domains and is an essential protein for viral replication (30Lam A.M. Frick D.N. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 31Kolykhalov A.A. Mihalik K. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2046-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). HCV NS3-4A recombinant protein contains an NS4A core peptide fused to the N terminus of the protease (32Howe A.Y. Chase R. Taremi S.S. Risano C. Beyer B. Malcolm B. Lau J.Y.

The helicase domain NS3h belongs to the superfamily 2 helicases, and helicase oligomers show functional cooperativity in nucleic acid unwinding (14Levin M.K. Wang Y.H. Patel S.S. J. Biol.

The HCV helicase uses ATP hydrolysis to unwind a variety of nucleic acids, including dsDNA, dsRNA, and RNA/DNA (33Tackett A.J. Wei L. Cameron C.E. Raney K.D.

Molecular Motors. 2003; (Schliwa, M., ed) pp. , Wiley-VCH-Verlag GmbH, Weinheim, Germany: 179-198Google Scholar). The major questions we address here are as follows. Does the unwinding rate and processivity of helicases depend on the nucleic acid sequence and base pair stability? If helicase-catalyzed unwinding activity is sensitive to sequence and base pair stability, do helicases from different structural classes, such as ring-shaped versus non-ring-shaped helicases, show different dependences? Does the degree of sensitivity of the helicase to base pair stability provide insights into passive versus active mechanism of helicase action? Single molecule unwinding studies of non-ring-shaped helicases like HCV NS3 and Escherichia coli UvrD have shown that the nucleic acid unwinding rates are not significantly influenced by a destabilizing force applied to the double-stranded nucleic acid (37Dumont S.

Croquette V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6439-6444Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). On the other hand, an ensemble study of the ring-shaped helicase (E. coli DnaB) indicated an almost 7-fold difference in the unwinding rate depending on the sequence of the dsDNA substrate (39Galletto R. Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Similarly, ensemble studies have shown that the non-ring-shaped UvrD helicase and ring-shaped T7 helicase, respectively, move 3–9-fold faster on ssDNA relative to their rates of dsDNA unwinding (29Jeong Y.J.

Rajagopal and S. S. Patel, manuscript in preparation. 4V. Rajagopal and S. S. Patel, manuscript in preparation. The latter observations imply that the unwinding rates of these helicases might depend on base pair stability. To compare and contrast the two structurally distinct types of helicases, we carried out transient state kinetic analysis of DNA and RNA unwinding with the HCV helicases and DNA unwinding by T7 helicase. We find that these helicases show characteristic dependencies on the sequence and base pair stabilities. This degree of helicase sensitivity to base pair stability can be analyzed to distinguish between active and passive mechanisms of unwinding. Reagents and Buffers—Reagents were purchased from Sigma. Assays with T7 helicase were in Buffer T (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 40 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) at 18 °C. Assays with HCV helicases were in Buffer H (50 mm MOPS-Na, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20) at 22 °C. Unwinding Substrate Design—The DNA substrates used for the unwinding rate measurements were 40 bp in length, whereas the dsRNA and RNA/DNA substrates were 30 bp in length (Table 1). The length of the dsNA region of the substrates was chosen carefully; it cannot be too short, because at room temperature 8–16 bp of dsNA of a particular sequence can have ΔG close to zero and can get spontaneously unwound (29Jeong Y.J. Levin M.K. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7264-7269Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 42Eoff R.L. Raney K.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The length of the dsNA region cannot be too long, otherwise the unwound strands may reanneal behind the helicase during the reaction (29Jeong Y.J. Levin M.K. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7264-7269Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The range of GC content in the dsNA provided us with unwinding substrates of increasing overall stability. However, because the same GC% would have unequal stabilities in different types of nucleic acids, we instead refer to ΔG values of the sequences as a comparable reference. The nearest neighbor approach (43Breslauer K.J. Frank R. Blocker H. Marky L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

RNA and DNA were obtained from IDT (Coralville, IA) and gel-purified. Duplex DNA forks were prepared by annealing DNA oligos (sequences 1–4) containing a stretch of 35 dTs at its 5′-end with the complementary DNA strands that contained a stretch of 15 dTs at its 3′-end. RNA/DNA forks were prepared by annealing DNA oligos (sequences 6–8) containing a stretch of 20 dTs at its 5′-end with the complementary RNA oligos containing a stretch of 20 rUs at its 3′-end. dsRNA forks were prepared by annealing RNA oligos (RNA equivalent of sequences 5–8) containing a stretch of 20 rUs at its 5′-end with the complementary RNA oligos containing a stretch of 20 rUs at its 3′-end. T7 helicase would functionally load onto the 5′-strand and translocate toward the 3′-end, whereas NS3h would load onto the 3′-strand and translocate toward the 5′-end.

Unwinding Assays—In T7 helicase assays, the reaction concentrations were as follows: 100 nm hexamer, 2 mm dTTP, 2.5 nm unwinding substrate, 2 mm free Mg2+, and 1 μm SSB. The protein, DNA, and the nucleotide cofactor were pre-assembled in one syringe, and Mg2+ and SSB were mixed from the other syringe. In HCV helicase assays, the reaction concentrations were as follows: 100 nm NS3h, 2.5 nm unwinding substrate, 5 mm Mg-ATP, and 1 μm SSB. The protein and DNA were pre-assembled in one syringe, and Mg-ATP and SSB were added from a second syringe. The SSB protein acts as a trap and ensures single turnover reaction conditions for both helicases (49Stano N.M. Jeong Y.J. Donmez I. Tummalapalli P. Levin M.K. Patel S.S.

T7 helicase reactions were quenched with a 1.5-fold volume of the solution containing 100 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) SDS, 20% glycerol, bromphenol blue, and 3 μm of ssDNA complementary to the unlabeled strand. The NS3h reactions were quenched with a 1.5-fold volume of the solution containing 100 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) SDS, 200 nm reannealing trap (ssDNA complementary to the unlabeled strand), and 500 nm poly(U). For dsRNA unwinding by NS3-4A, the reaction concentrations were as follows: 100 nm enzyme, 2.5 nm unwinding substrate, 5 mm Mg-ATP, 0.5 μm poly(U), and 100 nm reannealing trap. The protein and RNA were pre-assembled in one syringe, and Mg-ATP, poly(U), and reannealing trap were added from a second syringe. The reactions were quenched with a 1.5-fold volume of the solution containing 100 mm EDTA and 1% (w/v) SDS. The reactions were loaded on a 10% native polyacrylamide gel with 1× TBE buffer containing 0.2% SDS. Data Analysis—MATLAB was the platform for all nonlinear least squares fittings. Experimental data with only two states was fit to the Equation 1 (29Jeong Y.J. Levin M.K. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Processivity per step is equal to ku/(ku + kd). Processivity per bp is equal to (ku/ku + kd)n/(L-Lm), and the average unwinding rate is ku × step size. Hard Wall and Soft Wall Helicase Simulations—To quantify our observations in the light of passive/active mechanisms of unwinding, we used the equations derived by Betterton and Julicher (51Betterton M.D. Julicher F. Phys. Rev. E Stat. Nonlin. Soft Matter Phys. 2005; 71: 011904Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The dsNA stability is expressed as the probability of base pair opening that allows the helicase to translocate along ssNA. From the helicase’s maximal rate of translocation when there is no resistance from dsNA and the dsNA opening probabilities, the average rate of unwinding was calculated over a particular sequence. This simple scenario applies to the passive or the Hard Wall case, when the helicase waits for the dsNA to open. The approximate average rate of unwinding in this case, for a step size of 1, is given by Equations 5, <kp>k0≈e−ΔG/RT5 where 〈kp 〉 is the unwinding rate; k0 is the maximum helicase rate when ΔG, the average free energy of melting a single base pair (kcal/mol), is zero, and RT is gas constant times temperature. The y intercept values (ΔG/bp = 0) for T7 helicase (94 bp/s) and NS3h on DNA (6.4 bp/s) are close to the experimentally measured values of translocation along ssDNA and hence good estimates of k0 (40Kim D.E. Narayan M. Patel S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 807-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).4 In the active or the Soft Wall model, there is an interaction potential between the helicase and fork junction. This energy from helicase favorably modifies the dsNA opening probabilities. At the same time, the forward/backward movements of the helicase are compromised by the amount of energy favoring the dsNA. This enhanced option of distributing energy between DNA and helicase (as opposed to both of them acting independently of each other) provides a means of optimizing the rate of propagation of the helicase-NA junction, resulting in a higher unwinding rate. To get an approximate rate information for a helicase with a step size of 1 that invokes a Soft Wall potential at the DNA junction, we used Equation 6, <ka>k0≈e−ΔG/RTċ(e−ΔG/RT+(1−e−ΔG/RT)ċe−fċU0/RT)e−ΔG/RT+(1−e−ΔG/RT)ċe−U0/RT6 where 〈ka 〉 is the average unwinding rate; U0 is the strength of the single step interaction potential at the first base pair from junction, and f is a parameter that defines how much of the potential is felt by the helicase forward versus backward rates. As our purpose was mainly to get a relative comparison of different helicases, we fixed the f value at 0.05 and the step size at 1 bp (51Betterton M.D. Julicher F. Phys. Rev. E Stat. Nonlin. Soft Matter Phys. 2005; 71: 011904Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Unwinding Substrates—The DNA unwinding substrates contained a 40-bp duplex region and 3′-dT15 and 5′-dT35 overhangs for helicase loading. The sequence of the duplex region was pre-designed and contained varying numbers of GC base pair from 0 to 100%. The dsRNA and RNA/DNA substrates for HCV helicase unwinding contained a 3′-rU20 overhang for helicase loading and translocation along RNA. The sequence of the RNA duplex region was designed to contain varying numbers of GC base pairs from 13 to 80%. The different percentage of GC base pairs in the dsNA region provided us with unwinding substrates of varying stability. The average ΔG/bp for the substrates was calculated and ranged from 0.9 to 2.9 kcal/mol/bp under the assay conditions (Table 1). Unwinding of these substrates was measured by the all-or-none radiometric helicase assay (see “Experimental Procedures”) (52Ali J.A. Lohman T.M. Science. 1997; 275: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), which provided an accurate measurement of the average unwinding rate that could be correlated with the average ΔG/bp for the dsNA substrates. Unwinding Rate of T7 Helicase Is Highly Sensitive to the Average Base Pair Stability of the dsDNA—T7 helicase was preassembled on the DNA unwinding substrate prior to starting the unwinding reactions so that the slow steps of helicase binding to the DNA would not limit the observed rates (29Jeong Y.J. Levin M.K. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7264-7269Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the all-or-none radiometric assays, the progress of the reaction was monitored by quantifying the relative amounts of the single-stranded nucleic acid product and the initial double-stranded nucleic acid reactant as a function of reaction time. The kinetics showed that T7 helicase unwinds each of the DNA substrates of increasing stability with a presteady state kinetic lag (Fig. 1a). The duration of the lag in ssDNA generation increased as the average base pair stability of the unwinding substrate increased. Similarly, the fraction of ssDNA generated at the end of the reaction decreased as the average base pair stability of the substrates increased. To extract the unwinding rate and processivity from the observed kinetics, the data were fit to the stepping model of strand separation (see “Experimental Procedures”). A simple model with a uniform stepping rate and allowing helicase dissociation at each step accurately described the DNA unwinding data (shown by the solid lines in Fig. 1a). The average unwinding rate was calculated from the stepping rate and the number of steps needed to separate the length of the duplex. Because of the discontinuous nature of the helicase assay, the partially unwound dsNA substrates after the reaction is quenched either reanneal to form the initial duplex substrate or fall apart to produce single strands. When calculating the average unwinding rate (bp/s), we assumed that the helicase does not have to unwind the entire stretch of dsNA, but a short stretch of the duplex (Lm) at the end of the sequence spontaneously falls apart (29Jeong Y.J. Levin M.K. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7264-7269Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 39Galletto R. Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For each substrate used here, we calculated Lm based on the melting temperature (Table 1). Therefore, for each substrate Lm has a different length (8–16 bp) but an equal melting temperature. We believe that this approach is more accurate than the previously used “equal length” assumption (29Jeong Y.J. Levin M.K. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7264-7269Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 39Galletto R. Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The same model also provided the processivity of unwinding. Processivity is defined as the probability of carryi"

To examine the action of Wnts in skeleton formation, we developed a genetic system to conditionally express Wnt4 in chondrogenic tissues of the mouse. A mouse Wnt4 cDNA was introduced into the ubiquitously expressed Rosa26 (R26) locus by gene targeting in embryonic stem (ES) cells. The expression of Wnt4 from the R26 locus was blocked by a neomycin selection cassette flanked by loxP sites (floxneo) that was positioned between the Rosa26 promoter and the Wnt4 cDNA, creating the allele designated R26(floxneoWnt4). Wnt4 expression was activated during chondrogenesis using Col2a1-Cre transgenic mice that express Cre recombinase in differentiating chondrocytes. R26(floxneoWnt4); Col2a1-Cre double heterozygous mice exhibited a growth deficiency, beginning approximately 7 to 10 days after birth, that resulted in dwarfism. In addition, they also had craniofacial abnormalities, and delayed ossification of the lumbar vertebrae and pelvic bones. Histological analysis revealed a disruption in the organization of the growth plates and a delay in the onset of the primary and secondary ossification centers. Molecular studies showed that Wnt4 overexpression caused decreased proliferation and altered maturation of chondrocytes. In addition, R26(floxneoWnt4); Col2a1-Cre mice had decreased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These studies demonstrate that Wnt4 overexpression leads to dwarfism in mice. The data indicate that Wnt4 levels must be regulated in chondrocytes for normal growth plate development and skeletogenesis. Decreased VEGF expression suggests that defects in vascularization may contribute to the dwarf phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2022669948,"A broad spectrum detection platform that provides sequence level resolution of target regions would have a significant impact in public health, case management, and means of expanding our understanding of the etiology of diseases. A previously developed respiratory pathogen microarray (RPM v.1) demonstrated the capability of this platform for this purpose. This newly developed RPM v.1 was used to analyze 424 well-characterized nasal wash specimens from patients presenting with febrile respiratory illness in the Washington, D. C. metropolitan region. For each specimen, the RPM v.1 results were compared against composite reference assay (viral and bacterial culture and, where appropriate, RT-PCR/PCR) results. Across this panel, the RPM assay showed ≥98% overall agreement for all the organisms detected compared with reference methods. Additionally, the RPM v.1 results provide sequence information which allowed phylogenetic classification of circulating influenza A viruses in ∼250 clinical specimens, and allowed monitoring the genetic variation as well as antigenic variability prediction. Multiple pathogens (2–4) were detected in 58 specimens (13.7%) with notably increased abundances of respiratory colonizers (esp. S. pneumoniae) during viral infection. This first-ever comparison of a broad-spectrum viral and bacterial identification technology of this type against a large battery of conventional “gold standard” assays confirms the utility of the approach for both medical surveillance and investigations of complex etiologies of illness caused by respiratory co-infections."

The chitohexaose binds with all six saccharide residues in the active site groove, with an intact glycosidic bond at the bond cleavage center. Its binding induces a large reorientation of the two structural domains in MltA, narrowing the active site groove and allowing tight interactions of the oligosaccharide with residues from both domains. The structures identify residues in MltA with key roles in the binding and recognition of peptidoglycan and confirm that Asp-308 is the single catalytic residue, acting as a general acid/base.

Arch. Microbiol. 1995; 164: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 2Koraimann G. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 2371-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The lytic activity of these enzymes is directed toward the β-1,4-glycosidic bonds between N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) and GlcNAc residues, the two sugar units that make up the glycan strands of peptidoglycan. Concomitant to bond cleavage, they catalyze an intramolecular transglycosylation reaction resulting in the formation of muropeptides terminated with a non-reducing 1,6-anhydromuramic acid residue. LTs are found in a wide variety of bacteria, as well as in a few bacteriophages, and are often present as several distinct enzymes within the same species. For instance, in Escherichia coli, at least six different LTs have been identified: one soluble (Slt70) and five that are outer membrane-anchored (MltA-MltD, EmtA) (1Hoöltje J.V. Arch. Microbiol. 1995; 164: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 3Kraft A.R. Templin M.F. Hoöltje J.V. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3441-3447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Romeis T. Vollmer W. Holtje J.V. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 111: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A comparison of genes encoding LTs allowed their classification into four families based on the identification of different sets of consensus motifs (5Blackburn N.T. Clarke A.J. J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 52: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). LT family 1 includes proteins with amino acid sequence similarity to Slt70, MltC, MltD, and EmtA, whereas MltA and MltB are representatives of families 2 and 3, respectively. The fourth LT family comprises mostly enzymes encoded by λ bacteriophages. Studies of the LTs have focused on understanding their precise cellular roles, as well as on explaining their reaction mechanism. Concerning the latter interest, important insights have been obtained from the study of crystal structures of these enzymes, both in unliganded forms and in complex with various murein-derived compounds (6Thunnissen A.M.W.H.

Biol. 2005; 352: 1068-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These investigations showed that members from LT families 1, 3, and 4 have a catalytic domain that resembles the fold of goose-type lysozyme (12Thunnissen A.M.W.H. Isaacs N.W. Dijkstra B.W. Proteins. 1995; 22: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The reaction catalyzed by these enzymes most likely takes place via a general acid/base mechanism that requires participation of a single catalytic residue, i.e. an invariant glutamic acid residue located at the C-terminal end of an α-helix. The reaction mechanism of the LTs thus differs from that of hen egg white lysozyme and from those of most other glycoside hydrolases, which require the participation of two catalytic carboxylate groups in the active site (13Davies G. Henrissat B. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 853-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). Based on inhibition studies and crystallographic analysis, it has been proposed that the lysozyme-like LTs may utilize the N-acetyl group of the muramic acid residues in the peptidoglycan polymer to provide anchimeric assistance in catalysis (7Thunnissen A.M.W.H.

MltAs (LT family 2, also classified as glycoside hydrolase family 102 in the CAZy database) occupy a special place among the LTs. They are characterized by six conserved amino acid sequence motifs (5Blackburn N.T. Clarke A.J. J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 52: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), none of which bears any resemblance to those present in the other LTs. Moreover, their three-dimensional structure, as revealed by recent crystal structure determinations of the enzymes from E. coli and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (11van Straaten K.E. Dijkstra B.W. Vollmer W. Thunnissen A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 1068-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 19Powell A.J. Liu Z.J. Nicholas R.A. Davies C. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 122-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), is completely different from that of lysozyme. It comprises two main domains, one of which has a double-Ψ β-barrel fold resembling the catalytic domain of endoglucanase V, a cellulolytic enzyme from Humicola insolens (20Davies G.J. Dodson G.G. Hubbard R.E. Tolley S.P. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Hjort C. Mikkelsen J.M. Rasmussen G. Schuölein M. Nature. 1993; 365: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The two domains are separated by a long groove, which, in analogy to the catalytic domain of endoglucanase V, most likely serves to bind and cleave a glycan strand. An invariant aspartate residue in MltA, Asp-308 in the E. coli enzyme, has a position equivalent to that of the catalytic acid of endoglucanase V, Asp-121, whereas there is no second carboxylate group in MltA at a position equivalent to Asp-10, the catalytic base of endoglucanase V. Furthermore, mutation of Asp-308 to an alanine residue in E. coli MltA resulted in a completely inactive enzyme, whereas similar mutations of two other invariant aspartate residues (Asp-261 and Asp-297) had less dramatic or minor effects on the catalytic activity, strongly suggesting that Asp-308 in E. coli MltA functions as the single general acid/base catalyst in the lytic transglycosylase reaction mechanism of MltA (11van Straaten K.E. Dijkstra B.W. Vollmer W. Thunnissen A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 1068-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Previous proposals concerning the function of MltA were made on the basis of analysis of unliganded native structures and by studying the effects of site-directed mutagenesis. Important questions concerning the precise role of amino acid residues in substrate binding and cleavage and whether anchimeric assistance in catalysis by the N-acetyl group of the substrate plays a role in the catalytic mechanism of MltA could not be adequately addressed in the absence of structural information on sugar-bound enzyme complexes. Here we describe the structure of the inactive E. coli MltA-D308A mutant in two different apo-conformations, as well as in complex with the hexasaccharide chitohexaose ((GlcNAc)6). This ensemble of structures provides evidence for a remarkable conformational flexibility of MltA, allowing it to accommodate large differences in the relative spatial disposition of its two structural domains. Although in the apo-forms of the enzyme the two domains are positioned such that they form a similarly wide, although differently shaped, groove in the chitohexaose-bound form of MltA, the domains have reoriented such as to cause a substantial narrowing and reshaping of the groove, optimizing the fit to the oligosaccharide. The MltA-chitohexaose structure further provides detailed information on the oligosaccharide binding interactions and the likely mechanism of catalysis of MltA, possibly involving a novel mode of stabilization of the oxocarbenium ion intermediate state by the dipole moment of a nearby α-helix. Structure Determination of apo-sMltA-D308A—Expression and purification of sMltA-D308A were carried out as described previously (21van Straaten K.E. Dijkstra B.W. Thunnissen A.M.W.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 758-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Crystallization of apo-1 sMltA-D308A was performed at conditions similar to those used for native sMltA (15 mg/ml protein in 250-350 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.2), yielding isomorphous crystals (space group P3121). Prior to data collection, the apo-1 crystals were transferred to a stabilizing solution containing 8% polyethylene glycol 8000, 375 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.2, and 18% ethylene glycol as a cryoprotectant and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Soaking of the apo-1 crystals in solutions containing chitohexaose (Sigma) generally resulted in extensive crystal deformation and cracking. However, in one particular case, a short soak of 20 min in a solution containing 20 mm chitohexaose, 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 7.5% isopropyl alcohol, and 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.2, allowed a small, intact crystal fragment to be rescued and frozen for data collection using glycerol as cryoprotectant. Analysis of the x-ray data revealed a dramatic change in unit cell dimensions, without a change in space group, as compared with the apo-1 crystals (see Table 1). Subsequent structure determination, however, did not reveal any bound chitohexaose but allowed a large conformational change to be observed in the sMltA-D308A protein, explaining the change in crystal packing and identifying a second crystal form of apo-sMltA-D308A (apo-2). Data sets for the two apo-forms of sMltA-D308A were collected at beam line ID14-1 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France. All data were collected at 100 K, processed with DENZO, and merged with SCALEPACK (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar).

First, all solvent molecules were removed from the native sMltA model. Then, the model was refined against the apo-1 diffraction data using CNS (23Bruönger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar), first by employing rigid body refinement and followed by simulated annealing using torsion angle dynamics. Inspection of 2mFo - DFc and Fo - DFc electron density maps confirmed the presence of the D308A mutation in the model. The apo-1 model was refined to convergence through iterative cycles of positional refinement using CNS and manual rebuilding with XFIT (24McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar). Progress of the refinement was monitored by following Rfree. Water molecules were placed automatically by XFIT in peaks >3.0σ in Fo - DFc maps and within hydrogen-bonding distance of nitrogen or oxygen atoms; water molecules without electron density in 2mFo - DFc maps contoured at 1 σ and B factors above 60 Å2 were removed from the model. Phases for the apo-2 sMltA mutant were determined by molecular replacement with the program MOLREP (25Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar) using the two domains of the apo-1 model as independent search models. Refinement of the apo-2 model was carried out as for the apo-1 model, except that REF-MAC5 (26Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13853) Google Scholar) was used as the refinement program. The final apo-1 and apo-2 models (see Table 1 for refinement statistics) extend from residue 3 to 337 and contain 227 and 153 water molecules, respectively. Structure Determination of Chitohexaose-bound sMltA-D308A—Crystals of chitohexaose-bound sMltA-D308A were obtained by co-crystallization. A rare case of tetartohedral twinning prohibited a standard structure determination of the sugar-bound sMltA-D308A complex. Instead, it required the use of selenomethionine-substituted protein to allow multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data collection and the application of special twin-adapted refinement protocols. A detailed description of the procedure followed to determine the structure of this complex has been published elsewhere (27Barends T.R.M. de Jong R.M. van Straaten K.E. Thunnissen A.M.W.H. Dijkstra B.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The statistics of the final refined model are given in Table 1. The model displays good geometry. Terminal residues 1-2 and 338-345 were omitted due to unclear electron density. Electron density for the hexasaccharide GlcNAc residues is well defined, except for the reducing GlcNAc residue at subsite +2, which shows disordered binding (see the supplemental data). Structural Analysis—All models were validated using MOLPROBITY (28Davis I.W. Murray L.W. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 615-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar) and the ADIT validation server (at the Protein Data Bank). For structural analyses, the following programs were used: domain rotation by DYNDOM (29Hayward S. Berendsen H.J.C. Proteins: Struct. Funct. Genet. 1998; 30: 144-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), superpositions by LSQMAN (30Kleywegt G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1878-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and enzyme-ligand hydrogen bond analysis by CONTACT (25Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar). The figures were prepared with POVSCRIPT (31Fenn T.D. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 944-947Crossref Scopus (298) Google Scholar), POVRAY, and PYMOL. Construction of Glycan-bound sMltA Models—A (GlcNAc-MurNAc)3-bound sMltA model was constructed by manually replacing the C3-OH groups of the -3, -1, and +2 sugars in the chitohexaose-bound structure with d-lactyl groups. A short run with CNS was performed to remove bad contacts, restraining the positions of the sugar rings and restricting protein atom movement to side chains with atoms withina5Å cut-off distance from the glycan hexamer. To assess the possibility of induced substrate distortion at subsite -1, an extra run was performed with CNS, enforcing a sofa conformation for the -1 MurNAc residue by applying appropriate dihedral restraints. Structure Determination—E. coli MltA (hereafter referred to as sMltA) was expressed and purified as a soluble protein, having its N-terminal 20-residue lipoprotein signal sequence and following lipoyl-bearing cysteine residue replaced by a single methionine residue. Saccharide binding to sMltA was probed by co-crystallization of the inactive D308A mutant and chitohexaose ((GlcNAc)6). In addition, two crystal structures of D308A sMltA without sugars were obtained (apo-1 and apo-2; for details, see Table 1 and “Experimental Procedures”). In contrast to the two apo-forms, structure determination of the chitohexaose-bound form of sMltA-D308A was not straightforward due to a rare case of tetartohedral twinning, as described elsewhere (27Barends T.R.M. de Jong R.M. van Straaten K.E. Thunnissen A.M.W.H. Dijkstra B.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although in the apo-crystal forms, the proteins are packed as monomers, in the chitohexaose-bound sMltA-D308A crystal asymmetric unit, they are arranged as tetramers. Each of the four protein molecules in these tetramers has a chitohexaose bound, as based on analysis of Fo - DFc Fourier maps calculated early in the refinement. The four protein molecules are well superimposable (overall root mean square difference (r.m.s.d.) of 0.69 Å for 330 equivalent Cα atoms, see the supplemental data), with structural differences being largely the result of small rigid body-like reorientations of the two domains. Significant local differences in backbone conformation are observed only at the two termini of the polypeptide chains and at a number of flexible turns and loops (e.g. residues 12-20, 28-32, 70-75, 88-95, and 192-222). Overall Structures and Conformational Flexibility—The chitohexaose-bound structure of sMltA-D308A reveals large conformational differences with respect to the apo-1 and apo-2 structures (Fig. 1). As described previously (11van Straaten K.E. Dijkstra B.W. Vollmer W. Thunnissen A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 1068-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), E. coli sMltA comprises two structural domains (A and B (11van Straaten K.E. Dijkstra B.W. Vollmer W. Thunnissen A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 1068-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)). The larger domain A (residues 3-104 and 244-337) has a double-Ψβ-barrel fold. Domain B (residues 105-243) also has a β-barrel structure, but it is different from that of domain A. It is present as an insertion between the first (β3) and second (β10) strand of the double-Ψβ-barrel. A small helical subdomain, comprised of helices α6-α8, is inserted between the last two strands of the β-barrel of domain B. The overall structure of apo-1 sMltA-D308A is nearly identical to that of the native enzyme determined previously (overall r.m.s.d. for all Cα atoms is ∼0.2 Å). It shows a conformation in which the small α-helical subdomain (Bα) of domain B participates in interdomain contacts with the loop between helix α9 and strand β14 of domain A. A wide groove, blocked at one end by the Bα subdomain, runs at the interface between domains A and B. In the apo-2 structure, the domains have separated due to an ∼30° rigid body-like rotation of domain B away from domain A with the two interdomain linker segments, i.e. residues 104-107 and 238-242, functioning as flexible hinges. As a result, a very wide and open groove is formed at the domain interface. In contrast, the chitohexaose-bound structure of sMltA-D308A reveals that, upon binding of the hexasaccharide, domain B undergoes an ∼37° rotation (relative to the apo-1 structure) toward domain A, bringing the two domains closer together, and causes a relocation of the Bα-subdomain relative to the α9-β14 loop. As a consequence, the active site groove has become narrower and deeper, and the blockage by the Bα-subdomain has been released, allowing a tight embrace of the bound chitohexaose. Binding of Chitohexaose in sMltA-D308A—The chitohexaose binds in the active site groove from subsite -4 (nonreducing end) to subsite +2 (reducing end) (Fig. 1B; for subsite nomenclature, see Davies et al. (32Davies G.J. Wilson K.S. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). The hexasaccharide has an extended conformation, with all GlcNAc residues in full 4C1 chair conformations and with all N-acetyl groups pointing away from their corresponding sugar rings. Most significantly, it has an intact glycosidic bond at the site of bond cleavage between subsites -1 and +1, the first time this has been observed for a lytic transglycosylase. In contrast to various chitinase structures with bound chitin fragments (16Tews I. Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Perrakis A. Wilson K.S. Dijkstra B.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 7954-7959Crossref Scopus (272) Google Scholar), the sMltA-D308A-chitohexaose complex provides no evidence for distortion of the -1 sugar ring nor for a possible participation in catalysis of the N-acetyl group of the -1 GlcNAc residue. However, the -1 to +1 glycosidic linkage has rotated away from its energetically most favorable conformation (Fig. 2 and supplemental data), and the O3 hydroxyl group of the +1 GlcNAc has lost its stabilizing hydrogen-bonding interaction with the -1 O5 ring oxygen atom. Instead, the O3 hydroxyl group is positioned under the C1 carbon of the -1 GlcNAc at a close distance of ∼3Å. Binding of the chitohexaose involves a large number of van der Waals interactions as well as several sugar-protein hydrogen bonds (Fig. 2 and supplemental data). The tightest binding occurs at subsites -2, -1, and +1, where the sugar residues are cut off almost entirely from solvent. Almost all protein residues participating in sugar binding are part of the conserved amino acid sequence motifs of MltA (5Blackburn N.T. Clarke A.J. J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 52: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Binding of the -2 GlcNAc residue involves a strong aromatic stacking interaction between the sugar ring and the phenyl ring of Tyr-180, as well as several interactions with the N-acetyl group, which is completely buried in the protein-saccharide interface at the back of subsite -2. One of the interactions with the N-acetyl group involves a hydrogen bond between the side chain of Asp-297 and the N-acetyl amide, explaining the significant decrease in activity observed previously for a D297A sMltA mutant (11van Straaten K.E. Dijkstra B.W. Vollmer W. Thunnissen A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 1068-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Similar sugar binding interactions occur at subsite +1, with the side chain of Val-161 making stabilizing van der Waals contacts with the sugar ring, whereas at the back, the N-acetyl group of the +1 GlcNAc residue forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Gly-100. The GlcNAc residue bound at subsite -1 is tightly sandwiched between the Ψ-loop connecting strands β12 and β13 in domain A (residues 298-306) and the C terminus of α-helix 5 from domain B (residues 161-164). The Ψ-loop forms a lid covering the β-face of the -1 sugar ring, whereas the C-terminal end of helix α5 covers the α-face, and hydrogen bonds are formed both with the N-acetyl group as well as with the C5-methylhydroxyl group of the -1 sugar. The hydroxymethyl group of the sugar further makes stabilizing van der Waals contacts with the side chain of Tyr-101 at the back of subsite -1, whereas also having a close contact (∼3 Å) between its O6 hydroxyl oxygen and the side chain of Ala-259. The C1 atom of the -1 GlcNAc is right above the C terminus of α-helix 5, suggesting that the positively charged oxocarbenium ion-like transition state that occurs during the transglycosylation reaction can be stabilized by an electrostatic interaction with the α-helix dipole (33Hol W.G. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1985; 45: 149-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). A superposition with the native sMltA structure (Fig. 2D) shows that the Asp-308 side chain would be positioned at hydrogen-bonding distance (<3.3 Å) from the -1 to +1 glycosidic linkage, in a proper orientation to donate a proton to the glycosidic oxygen, in agreement with its proposed role as acid catalyst in the reaction mechanism of MltA. This superposition also reveals that the O6 hydroxyl of the -1 sugar would be positioned too far from Asp-308 for a hydrogen-bonding interaction with this catalytic residue. Moreover, the O6 atom is too far away from the anomeric C1 atom for nucleophilic attack on the latter atom, and a change in ring conformation, e.g. from chair to sofa, would be required to bring the O6 hydroxyl group in close proximity to Asp-308 and the C1 atom so that it can serve its role as catalytic nucleophile. Recognition of (Peptido)Glycan—The natural substrate of MltA is peptidoglycan, which differs from chitin in having every other GlcNAc residue replaced by a peptide-carrying MurNAc residue. The activity of MltA, however, does not depend on the presence of the peptides since the enzyme is able to cleave peptidoglycan chains from which the peptide moieties have been removed (11van Straaten K.E. Dijkstra B.W. Vollmer W. Thunnissen A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 1068-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 34Ursinus A. Hoöltje J.V. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 338-343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the enzyme cannot readily cleave chitin-based oligosaccharides such as chitohexaose, 5K. E. van Straaten, T. R. M. Barends, B. W. Dijkstra, and A.-M. W. H. Thunnissen, unpublished results. showing that the MurNAc C3-lactyl groups are essential for its activity. A model of a (GlcNAc-MurNAc)3 hexasaccharide, constructed on the basis of our chitohexaose-sMltA-D308A structure, shows that subsites -2 and +1 are specific for GlcNAc since there is not sufficient space at these subsites to accommodate the C3-lactyl group of a MurNAc residue. As a consequence, the MurNAc residues will bind in subsites -3, -1, and +2 with their lactyl groups poin"

Libby P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 4-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Various cytokine and co-stimulatory receptors provide the input to direct these processes. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying the regulation of cell/cell interactions is thus crucial for further understanding the immunological responses and improving therapeutic strategies aimed at treating cell/cell interaction-mediated human diseases. CD154 and CD40 molecules are pairs of ligand/receptor that belong to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF receptor (TNFR) superfamily and that play a pivotal role in cell/cell interactions (1Schonbeck U. Libby P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 4-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In B cells, the CD154/CD40 interaction is responsible for clonal expansion, germinal center formation, isotype switching, affinity maturation, and rescue from surface Ig-induced apoptosis. In nonhematopoietic cells, ligation of CD40 with CD154 enhances the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α. The absence or disruption of the CD154/CD40 pathway leads to a severe perturbation of the immune system, for example, in X-linked immunodeficiency with hyper-IgM (1Schonbeck U. Libby P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 4-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This observation has been confirmed using CD154 and CD40 knock-out mice (2Xu J. Foy T.M. Laman J.D. Elliott E.A. Dunn J.J. Waldschmidt T.J.

Like most ligand/receptor pairs, the CD154/CD40 interaction leads to a bidirectional signal that leads to proliferation and IL-2 production (3Kawabe T. Naka T. Yoshida K. Tanaka T. Fujiwara H.

Because CD40 has no kinase domain, the transmission of its intracellular signals passes via the recruitment of several adaptor proteins, such as Jak3 and TNFR-associated factor (TRAF) proteins, to specific domains in its cytoplasmic tail. This results in the activation of members of the Src kinase family (such as Lyn and Fyn) and other protein-tyrosine kinases (such as Syk and Btk), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phospholipase Cγ2, and the mitogen-activated protein kinases p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (4Grammer A.C. Lipsky P.E. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 76: 61-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have shown that ligated CD40, along with other signaling molecules, translocate and cluster into sphingolipid- and cholesterol-enriched microdomains and engage specific intracellular signaling pathways (5Grassme H.

Immunol. 2002; 168: 298-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). These discrete detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) microdomains are very dynamic areas of the cell membrane that serve as platforms for cell signaling (7Zeyda M. Stulnig T.M. Prog. Lipid Res. 2006; 45: 187-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although it is well established that CD154 is mainly present in a trimeric form at the cell surface and/or following release from the cell membrane (8van Kooten C. Banchereau J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 2-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar), little research has been conducted on CD40 homodimers (9Braesch-Andersen S. Paulie S. Koho H. Nika H. Aspenstrom P. Perlmann P. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 562-567PubMed Google Scholar) and their functional importance during T cell/APC interactions. We have previously reported that ligation of CD40 with soluble leucine zipper trimeric CD154 (stCD514) leads to the formation of the disulfide-linked CD40/CD40 (dl-CD40) homodimer (10Reyes-Moreno C.

Mourad W. Mol. Immunol. 2005; 42: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A high degree of CD40 clustering and subsequent dl-CD40 homodimer formation are selectively required for certain CD40-triggered responses such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent expression of B7-2 on human B cells and IL-8 production (10Reyes-Moreno C. Girouard J. Lapointe R. Darveau A. Mourad W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7799-7806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Girouard J. Reyes-Moreno C. Darveau A. Akoum A. Mourad W. Mol. Immunol. 2005; 42: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We show here that the translocation of CD40 to DRM microdomains is a prerequisite for dl-CD40 homodimer formation and that a cysteine residue at position 238 is involved in dl-CD40 homodimer formation. We also provide evidence showing that CD154/CD40 bidirectional signaling triggered during cognate T cell/APC interaction is critically dependent on CD40 homodimer formation. Cell Cultures, Antibodies, and Reagents—All of the cells used in this study were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). BJAB and Jurkat D1.1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 5% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin (Wisent, St-Bruno, Canada). HEK 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin (Wisent). The hybridomas producing the mouse mAbs directed against human CD40 (G28-5; IgG1) were obtained from ATCC. The IgG1 isotype controls were produced in our laboratory. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Trimeric CD154 was a generous gift from Immunex Corp. (Seattle, WA). Cell culture agents, electrophoresis grade chemicals, methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Induction of CD40/CD40 Homodimers—CD40 ligations were performed by incubating B cells (20 × 106 cells/ml) with medium alone or medium containing 5 μg/ml of soluble trimeric CD154 (stCD154; Immunex) at 37 °C for 30 min. Alternatively, B cells were stimulated with 10 μg/ml of anti-CD40 mAb G28-5 (ATCC) on ice for 15 min, washed twice, resuspended in RPMI containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 2 μg/ml of goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Cedarlane Laboratories Ltd., Burlington, Canada), and incubated for a further 10 min at 37 °C. Detergent-soluble and -insoluble Fractionation—CD40 stimulation and sucrose gradient density flotation were performed as previously described (10Reyes-Moreno C. Girouard J. Lapointe R. Darveau A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 7099-7107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were lysed in ice-cold TNE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA) containing 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm orthovanadate, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min on ice. The cell lysates were diluted in an equal volume of 85% sucrose, overlaid with 2.4 ml of 35% sucrose and 1 ml of 5% sucrose, and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 16 h at 4 °C. Eleven 380-μl fractions were harvested from the tube, starting at the top. The pellet was washed and resuspended in 380 μl of TNE buffer. Alternatively, the cells were lysed in ice-cold TNE buffer for 30 min on ice. The Triton-soluble fraction was separated from the Triton-insoluble fraction by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The Triton-insoluble pellets were washed, resuspended in 380 μl of TNE buffer, and homogenized by sonication. To disrupt sphingolipid- and cholesterol-enriched microdomains, BJAB cells were pretreated with 10 mm MβCD for 10 min at 37 °C. For thiol alkylation and the antioxidant treatments, the cells were treated with cell-permeable NEM thiol alkylating agent or NAC antioxidant for 60 min at 37 °C. The concentrations were maintained throughout the CD40 stimulation treatments. Immunoblotting—To study homodimer formation by intermolecular disulfide bond formation, the samples were diluted 1:5 in 5× Laemmli sample buffer under nonreducing conditions (without β-mercaptoethanol). The samples were boiled for 5 min and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). After blocking with 5% skim milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline, the CD40 molecules were probed with anti-CD40 (G28-5; 1:2,000) for 1 h at 37 °C followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG Ab (1:10,000) for 1 h at room temperature and were then visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (GEHealthcare Bioscience Inc.). Flow Cytometry Analyses—CD40 and HLA-DR expression were examined using anti-CD40 (G28-5) or anti-HLA-DR mAbs (L243), followed by Alexa fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. A total of 104 cells gated by light scatter on live cells were analyzed by FACScan (Becton Dickinson). Plasmid Constructs and Stable Transfection—The expression vectors CD40-C6Q, CD40-C17A, CD40-C238A, and CD40-ΔCyto were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the pCEP4-CD40 wild type (CD40-WT) as a template (10Reyes-Moreno C. Girouard J. Lapointe R. Darveau A. Mourad W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7799-7806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells were transfected by DNA-calcium phosphate precipitation (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) and selected using 400 μg/ml hygromycin (Roche Applied Science). HEK 293 cells co-expressing CD40 and HLA-DR were generated by transfecting cells expressing CD40-WT or CD40-C238A or cells mock transfected with the pBud-DR1-α/β expression vector (a generous gift from Dr. Jacques Thibodeau, Université de Montréal) and selected in 160 μg/ml and 200 μg/ml of Zeocin (InvivoGen, Cederlane Laboratories, Burlington, Canada) and hygromycin, respectively. Detection of IL-8 and IL-2—For the detection of IL-8 protein, HEK 293 transfectants (5 × 104/well; in triplicate) were allowed to adhere in 96-well plates for 24 h before being stimulated with 50 ng/ml of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or anti-CD40 mAbs plus secondary Abs as described above. IL-8 release was detected by ELISA as previously described (13Akoum A. Lawson C. McColl S. Villeneuve M. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2001; 7: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For IL-2, HEK 293 transfectants (5 × 104/well; in triplicate) were plated in 96-well plates and co-cultured with the same number of Jurkat D1.1 T cells expressing Vβ8, which is recognized by staphylococcal enterotoxin E (SEE) superantigen (a generous from Dr. Sekaly, Université de Montréal). The cells were incubated for 48 h in the absence or presence of 100 ng/ml of SEE, and IL-2 production was monitored using an ELISA kit (Mabtech Inc.). The ELISA results were analyzed using Statview 4.5 (Abacus Concept, Inc., Berkeley, CA). All of the values are expressed as the means of triplicates ± standard error of the mean. Induction of dl-CD40 Homodimers in DRM Microdomains—There is a growing body of evidence to indicate that oligomerization of CD40 leads to a rapid increase in dl-CD40 homodimer formation (10Reyes-Moreno C. Girouard J. Lapointe R. Darveau A. Mourad W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7799-7806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Girouard J. Reyes-Moreno C. Darveau A. Akoum A. Mourad W. Mol. Immunol. 2005; 42: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and that some CD40 signaling requires DRMs integrity (14Vidalain P.O. Azocar O. Servet-Delprat C. Rabourdin-Combe C. Gerlier D. Manie S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3304-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to investigate the role of DRM microdomains in dl-CD40 homodimer formation using cold 1% Triton X-100 solubilization over sucrose density gradient. To this end, BJAB B cells were left untreated or were treated with stCD154. They were then lysed, fractionated, and analyzed by Western blot under nonreducing conditions. As shown in Fig. 1A, we observed three major phenomena in stCD154-treated cells compared with untreated cells: (a) there was a significant translocation of CD40 to DRM microdomains, (b) CD40 homodimer formation was mainly detected in DRMs, and (c) there was no detectable CD40 in the pellets (fraction 12). Triton-insoluble fractions (DRMs) were found exclusively in the low density fractions (3 and 4), in which raft-associated molecule ganglioside GM1 was detected, whereas the Triton-soluble proteins were present in the high density fractions (9Braesch-Andersen S. Paulie S. Koho H. Nika H. Aspenstrom P. Perlmann P. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 562-567PubMed Google Scholar, 10Reyes-Moreno C. Girouard J. Lapointe R. Darveau A. Mourad W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7799-7806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Girouard J. Reyes-Moreno C. Darveau A. Akoum A. Mourad W. Mol. Immunol. 2005; 42: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), in which membrane phosphatase CD45 was detected (data not shown). We previously demonstrated that the ligation of CD40 with anti-CD40 Abs is not efficient in inducing significant dl-CD40 homodimer formation. However, efficient homodimer formation occurs when the anti-CD40 Abs are cross-linked with a secondary antibody (11Girouard J. Reyes-Moreno C. Darveau A. Akoum A. Mourad W. Mol. Immunol. 2005; 42: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We thus set out to assess the distribution of CD40 in cells treated with anti-CD40 Abs alone or with cross-linked anti-CD40 Abs. As can be seen in Fig. 1B, the anti-CD40 Abs treatment did not promote dl-CD40 homodimer formation. This failure to trigger dl-CD40 homodimer formation can be explained by the failure of anti-CD40 Abs to induce CD40 translocation to DRMs (Fig. 1B). In contrast, significant CD40 translocation to DRMs and homodimer formation in DRMs (Fig. 1B, fractions 3 and 4) were induced in cells incubated with cross-linked anti-CD40 Abs. CD40 translocation to and homodimer formation in DRM microdomains also occurred in Ramos, LG2, and primary human tonsillar B cells, indicating that these microdomains play a role in CD40 dimer formation (data not shown). Together these results showed that a high affinity multivalent ligand/receptor interaction is required for CD40 to translocate to DRMs and that the relocalization of CD40 within these microdomains may be necessary to form CD40/CD40 homodimers. Prerequisite Requirement of DRM Integrity for dl-CD40 Homodimer Formation—To assess the role of DRM integrity in dl-CD40 homodimer formation, we treated cells with MβCD, a drug that disrupts the integrity of these microdomains by extracting cholesterol, prior to CD40 oligomerization. Because fractionation of cell lysates on a sucrose density gradient revealed no monomeric or dimeric CD40 in the pellets (Fig. 1, A and B, fraction 12), we performed straightforward ice-cold Triton-soluble (cytosolic) and Triton-insoluble (DRM and cytoskeleton) fractionation. Using this method, we found that treating cells with cross-linked anti-CD40 antibody resulted in the translocation of CD40 monomer from the Triton-soluble fraction to the Triton-insoluble fraction (DRM) and dl-CD40 homodimer formation (Fig. 1C). Disrupting DRMs prior to CD40 stimulation totally impaired CD40 translocation to the Triton-insoluble fraction as well as dl-CD40 formation (Fig. 1C). This inhibition was not due to lower surface CD40 expression, because MβCD had no effect on CD40 expression (Fig. 1D) or cell viability (data not shown), indicating that the integrity of DRMs is critical for dl-CD40 homodimer formation. Involvement of Extracellular Cysteines 6 and 17 in CD40 Localization—While seeking to determine the potential residue(s) involved in CD40-mediated disulfide bound formation, we previously demonstrated that a point mutation (C6Q) in the extracellular domain of the CD40 abolishes dl-CD40 homodimer (11Girouard J. Reyes-Moreno C. Darveau A. Akoum A. Mourad W. Mol. Immunol. 2005; 42: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, the basis of this inhibition was not investigated. As shown in Fig. 2, treatment of HEK 293 cells stably expressing the CD40-C6Q mutant at levels comparable with that of CD40-WT with cross-linked anti-CD40 antibody resulted in impaired CD40 homodimer formation. However, this inhibition was also accompanied by an almost complete inhibition of CD40 translocation to DRMs (Fig. 2B). Because the integrity of these microdomains and CD40 translocation are required for inducing CD40 homodimer formation, these results suggest that it was the impairment of CD40 translocation to the DRMs that inhibited CD40-C6Q dimerization. Based on the disulfide structural model of members of the TNFR superfamily (15Jones M.D. Hunt J. Liu J.L. Patterson S.D. Kohno T. Lu H.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14914-14923Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and the CD40 structural model (16Bajorath J. Aruffo A. Proteins. 1997; 27: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), Cys6 forms a disulfide intraloop with Cys17 on the extracellular domain of CD40. We thus hypothesized that a Cys17 mutation should also destabilize the intramolecular disulfide bond and prevent CD40 translocation to DRM and CD40 dimerization. Indeed, similar to CD40-C6Q, treatment of CD40-C17A-expressing cells (Fig. 2A) resulted in total inhibition of CD40 translocation to and homodimer formation in DRMs (Fig. 2B). These results strongly suggest that the intramolecular disulfide bond between these two cysteines (Cys6 and Cys17) might play an important role in the localization of CD40 molecules in these microdomains following CD40 stimulation. Involvement of Cytoplasmic Cysteine 238 in dl-CD40 Homodimer Formation—Having demonstrated that DRM microdomains integrity was required for CD40 homodimer formation and the indirect involvement of Cys6 and Cys17,we then generated HEK 293 cells expressing truncated CD40 (CD40-ΔCyto) (Fig. 3A) to study the possible requirement of intracellular signaling to induce dl-CD40 homodimer and to determine which residues mediate this phenomenon. We found that deleting the cytoplasmic domain of CD40 did not alter the extraction of CD40 from the Triton-insoluble fraction, but it did completely inhibit dl-CD40 homodimer formation (Fig. 3B). These results strongly imply that the formation of the CD40 homodimer requires a specific cytoplasmic-mediated intramolecular disulfide bond. We thus investigated the role of the sole cytoplasmic cysteine (Cys238) in the induction of CD40 homodimer. To this end, we generated a CD40-C238A mutant in which Cys238 was replaced by alanine. Stimulating CD40-C238A-expressing cells (Fig. 3A) revealed that there was a significant translocation of CD40 from the Triton-soluble to the Triton-insoluble fraction in the absence of dl-CD40 homodimer formation (Fig. 3B), strongly suggesting the crucial role for Cys238 in the induction of CD40 homodimers. Role of Reactive Oxygen Species in dl-CD40 Homodimer Formation—It is well established that thiol disulfide exchange reactions are catalyzed by proteins with disulfide isomerase activity (17Turano C. Coppari S. Altieri F. Ferraro A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 193: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The evidence gathered from the above experiments suggested that an intracellular disulfide isomerase activity is involved in the induction of intramolecular disulfide bond formation with Cys238. To confirm this hypothesis, we utilized a chemical approach to further illustrate this phenomenon. To this end, BJAB cells were preincubated with cell-permeable NEM thiol alkylating agent. The NEM concentrations used were selected based on preliminary experiments in which the treatment had no effect on cell viability (less than 5%) or CD40 surface expression levels (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4A, cells preincubated with NEM showed a significant, dose-dependent reduction in dl-CD40 dimer formation compared with untreated BJAB cells. The cysteine residues of proteins are sensitive to oxidation by reactive oxygen species (ROS) (18Chevion M. Berenshtein E. Stadtman E.R. Free Radic. Res. 2000; 33: S99-S108PubMed Google Scholar). Thiols maintain the intracellular redox homeostasis, and the functioning of a number of proteins that contain free thiols can thus be reproducibly modified by the formation of disulfide bonds induced by ROS. ROS has been reported to be transiently increased in primary B cells and WEHI 231 B cell line by cross-linking the CD40 receptor, which may serve as second messengers linking CD40 engagement on B cells to improve downstream activation events (19Lee J.R. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2003; 252: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of ROS in the formation of the dl-CD40 homodimer formation after CD40 cross-linking, BJAB cells were pretreated with the NAC, which is a source of sulfhydryl groups and acts as an antioxidant-scavenging ROS. The NAC concentrations used were selected based on preliminary experiments in which the treatment had no effect on cell viability (less than 5%) or CD40 surface expression levels (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4B, dl-CD40 homodimer formation was significantly reduced in the presence of NAC (50%) in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 4B), suggesting for the first time that ROS play a role in the de novo oxidation of the thiol disulfide equilibrium required for the formation of these homodimers in DRM microdomains. Functional and Bidirectional Role of dl-CD40 Homodimer Signaling—Because the replacement of Cys238 in the cytoplasmic tail by alanine prevented CD40 dimer formation but not DRMs association, we next investigated the effect of the DRM/CD40 association and/or CD40 dimerization on CD40-induced IL-8 secretion. Cells expressing comparable levels of CD40-WT or CD40-C238A (Fig. 3A) were treated with cross-linked anti-CD40 antibody. As can be seen in Fig. 5A, CD40 cross-linking on CD40-WT-expressing cells induced IL-8 secretion significantly, whereas it had no effect on CD40-C238A-expressing cells. In contrast, stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate resulted in a significant increase in the secretion of IL-8 protein by all transfectants. These results point to the crucial role of dl-CD40 homodimer formation but not DRM association in CD40-mediated IL-8 secretion. Efficient T cell activation requires signals from T cell receptors (TCR) by nominal antigens presented in the context of self-MHC class II and other co-stimulatory molecules. The binding of CD154 to CD40 is also required for T cell activation, as indicated by the absence of germinal center formation in CD40 receptor knock-out mice (20van Essen D. Kikutani H. Gray D. Nature. 1995; 378: 620-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) and the triggering of cell signaling pathways in T cells by anti-CD154 mAbs (21Brenner B. Koppenhoefer U. Grassme H. Kun J. Lang F. Gulbins E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). During T cell/APC contact, the CD154/CD40 interaction leads to bidirectional signaling that mediates the responses of both cell types (21Brenner B. Koppenhoefer U. Grassme H. Kun J. Lang F. Gulbins E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We thus hypothesized that dl-CD40 homodimer formation might also be important for T cell activation. To test this hypothesis, we used an in vitro superantigen-mediated T cell activation model. Jurkat D1.1 T cells that bear Vβ8, which is recognized by SEE (22Yellin M.J. Lee J.J. Chess L. Lederman S. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3389-3395PubMed Google Scholar) and that express high levels of CD154 were co-cultured with HEK 293 mock transfected cells or stable transfectants expressing CD40-WT, HLA-DR, CD40-WT/HLA-DR, or CD40-C238A/HLA-DR in the presence or absence of SEE. All transfectants with comparable levels of surface HLA-DR or CD40 expression were sorted out (Fig. 5C). As shown in Fig. 5B, IL-2 production was induced when SEE was presented by cells expressing HLA-DR alone (150 ± 20 pg/ml). Co-expression of CD40-WT with HLA-DR resulted in a significant enhancement of IL-2 production by D1.1 Jurkat cells (600 ± 115 pg/ml). Conversely, when SEE was presented by cells co-expressing the CD40-C238A mutant with HLA-DR, the level of IL-2 production decreased to levels very similar to that detected in Jurkat cells co-cultured with cells expressing HLA-DR alone (195 ± 30 pg/ml) (Fig. 5B). Receptor oligomerization is vital for activating intracellular signaling, in part by initiating events that recruit effector and adaptor proteins to sites of active signaling. However, the mechanisms by which a cell uses its functional membrane to organize receptor oligomerization are poorly understood. Receptor clustering in DRM microdomains, where some signaling molecules reside and others are recruited where they may interact with the clustered receptors, has recently been identified as a central event in the initiation of signal transduction of many immune receptors, notably in signaling through B cell receptors (23Pierce S.K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 24Cheng P.C. Brown B.K. Song W. Pierce S.K. J.

Here we use computational methods and biological assays to investigate the relationship between DJ-1 missense mutations and the protein oligomeric state. Molecular dynamics calculations suggest that: (i) the structure of DJ-1 wild type (WT) in aqueous solution, in both oxidized and reduced forms, is similar to the crystal structure of the reduced form; (ii) the Parkinson disease-causing M26I variant is structurally similar to the WT, consistent with the experimental evidence showing the protein is a dimer as WT; (iii) R98Q is structurally similar to the WT, consistent with the fact that this is a physiological variant; and (iv) the L166P monomer rapidly evolves toward a conformation significantly different from WT, suggesting a change in its ability to oligomerize. Our combined computational and experimental approach is next used to identify a mutant (R28A) that, in contrast to L166P, destabilizes the dimer subunit-subunit interface without significantly changing secondary structure elements."
https://openalex.org/W2086195747,"The AP-1 transcription factor composed of fos and jun gene products mediates transcriptional responses to hormonal and metabolic stimulations of pancreatic beta cells. Here, we investigated the mechanisms that dynamically control expression of AP-1 subunit proteins. In MIN6 cells, glucose and GLP-1 raised c-FOS protein with biphasic kinetics, an initial peak being followed by a plateau that persisted as long as stimuli were maintained. ERK1/2 activation paralleled c-FOS expression. Whereas initial induction of c-FOS protein required ERK1/2-dependent activation of c-fos transcription and de novo protein synthesis, persistent accumulation of c-FOS under sustained stimulation did not. Indeed, dependent on ERK1/2 activation, c-FOS accumulated in its hyperphosphorylated form protected from degradation through the proteasome pathway. The implication of ERK1/2 in the accumulation of c-FOS protein was confirmed in rat primary beta cells, and the functional consequences of this mechanism were demonstrated with DNA-binding and reporter assays. Altogether these findings reveal a sequential regulation of AP-1 by ERK1/2, which initially increases transcription of c-fos and, if stimulation persists, stabilizes freshly synthesized c-FOS protein to efficiently activate the transcription of AP-1-regulated genes. This ERK1/2-AP-1 module can function as a temporal integrator converting metabolic stimuli of different durations into differential transcriptional outputs."
https://openalex.org/W2094571158,"Despite the increasing number of published protein structures, and the fact that each protein's function relies on its three-dimensional structure, there is limited access to automatic programs used for the identification of critical residues from the protein structure, compared with those based on protein sequence. Here we present a new algorithm based on network analysis applied exclusively on protein structures to identify critical residues. Our results show that this method identifies critical residues for protein function with high reliability and improves automatic sequence-based approaches and previous network-based approaches. The reliability of the method depends on the conformational diversity screened for the protein of interest. We have designed a web site to give access to this software at http://bis.ifc.unam.mx/jamming/. In summary, a new method is presented that relates critical residues for protein function with the most traversed residues in networks derived from protein structures. A unique feature of the method is the inclusion of the conformational diversity of proteins in the prediction, thus reproducing a basic feature of the structure/function relationship of proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2072217040,"Calculation of the free energy of protein folding and delineation of its pre-organization are of foremost importance for understanding, predicting and designing biological macromolecules. Here, we introduce an energy smoothing variant of parallel tempering replica exchange Monte Carlo (REMS) that allows for efficient configurational sampling of flexible solutes under the conditions of molecular hydration. Its usage to calculate the thermal stability of a model globular protein, Trp cage TC5b, achieves excellent agreement with experimental measurements. We find that the stability of TC5b is attained through the coupled formation of local and non-local interactions. Remarkably, many of these structures persist at high temperature, concomitant with the origin of native-like configurations and mesostates in an otherwise macroscopically disordered unfolded state. Graph manifold learning reveals that the conversion of these mesostates to the native state is structurally heterogeneous, and that the cooperativity of their formation is encoded largely by the unfolded state ensemble. In all, these studies establish the extent of thermodynamic and structural pre-organization of folding of this model globular protein, and achieve the calculation of macromolecular stability ab initio, as required for ab initio structure prediction, genome annotation, and drug design."

In some of the Ca2+-ATPase crystal structures, Arg678 and Glu439 seem to be involved in the binding of nucleotide or an associated Mg2+ ion. We have replaced Arg678, Glu439, and Gly438 with alanine to examine their importance for the enzyme cycle and the modulatory effects of ATP and MgATP. The results point to the key role of Arg678 in nucleotide binding and to the importance of interdomain bonds Glu439-Ser186 and Arg678-Asp203 in stabilizing the E2P and E2 intermediates, respectively. Mutation of Arg678 had conspicuous effects on ATP/MgATP binding to the E1 form and ADP binding to Ca2E1P, as well as ATP/MgATP binding in modulatory modes to E2P and E2, whereas the effects on ATP/MgATP acceleration of the Ca2E1P → E2P transition were small, suggesting that the nucleotide that accelerates Ca2E1P → E2P binds differently from that modulating the E2P → E2 and E2 → Ca2E1 reactions. Mutation of Glu439 hardly affected nucleotide binding to E1, Ca2E1P, and E2, but it led to disruption of the modulatory effect of ATP on E2P → E2 and acceleration of the latter reaction, indicating that ATP normally modulates E2P → E2 by interfering with the interaction between Glu439 and Ser186. Gly438 seems to be important for this interaction as well as for nucleotide binding, probably because of its role in formation of the helix containing Glu439 and Thr441. ATP binds to sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase both in a phosphorylating (catalytic) mode and in a nonphosphorylating (modulatory) mode, the latter leading to acceleration of phosphoenzyme turnover (Ca2E1P → E2P and E2P → E2 reactions) and Ca2+ binding (E2 → Ca2E1).

The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (1Hasselbach W. Makinose M. Biochem. Z. 1961; 333: 518-528PubMed Google Scholar) is a membrane-bound energy transducer (“nanomotor”) that couples ATP hydrolysis with Ca2+ translocation against a concentration gradient by means of a reaction cycle (Scheme 1) in which the ATPase enzyme is transiently phosphorylated at a conserved aspartic acid residue and undergoes major conformational transitions between Ca2E1/Ca2E1P and E2/E2P forms (2Shigekawa M.

The Ca2+-ATPase consists of a membrane-spanning domain of 10 mostly helical segments and a large cytoplasmic headpiece, comprising three distinct domains, named N (nucleotide binding), P (phosphorylation), and A (actuator) (4Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). In the Ca2E1 and Ca2E1P conformations, the catalytic ATP-binding site is made up by residues in the N- and P-domains, and during the Ca2E1P → E2P transition the departing ADP molecule is replaced by the TGES loop of the A-domain, which subsequently assists in catalysis of E2P dephosphorylation (8Toyoshima C.

In addition to being the phosphorylating substrate in the E1 state, ATP exerts modulatory effects on various steps of the Ca2+-ATPase cycle (boxed ATP in Scheme 1). Hence, the Ca2E1P → E2P, E2P → E2, and E2 → Ca2E1 transitions are all accelerated by the binding of ATP or MgATP in a nonphosphorylating mode (13Shigekawa M. Dougherty J.P. J. Biol.

The apparent affinity for the nucleotide is generally lower when it binds in the nonphosphorylating modulatory mode as compared with the phosphorylating mode, but it varies depending on the step being modulated. A subject of much controversy is the question whether the phosphorylating and modulatory ATP molecules are at the same locus, exhibiting variable affinity during the transport cycle depending on conformational state, or whether a separate low affinity allosteric site exists on the same Ca2+-ATPase polypeptide chain (18Cable M.B.

These results are consistent with the more recently published crystal structures of the Ca2+-ATPase with bound nucleotide. On the basis of the crystal structures in conjunction with the information from mutagenesis studies, it is concluded that the binding of ATP together with associated Mg2+ ions at the catalytic site of the Ca2E1 form closes the site by directly bridging the N- and P-domains and mediates the formation of an extensive network of hydrogen bonds (6Sørensen T.L.

One Mg2+ ion is coordinated by P-domain residues together with the γ-phosphoryl group of ATP (“canonical Mg2+ site” or “Mg2+ site 1”). Furthermore, an Mg2+ ion is also found associated with the α,β-phosphates of the nucleotide in some of the crystal structures (“Mg2+ site 2”) (6Sørensen T.L. Møller J.V. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 304: 1672-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 8Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; 432: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 10Jensen A-M. L.

The Mg2+ ion at site 1 remains bound together with the phosphoryl group in the E2P state after ADP has left and is released from E2 together with Pi later in the cycle (Scheme 1). In this study, we have addressed the functional roles of P-domain residue Arg678 and N-domain residues Gly438 and Glu439. Arg678 and Glu439 have both been suggested to be involved in the binding of nucleotide. The first indication associating Arg678 with nucleotide binding came from studies showing that chemical cross-linking of the side chains of Arg678 and Lys492 by glutaraldehyde is prevented by ATP or ADP (36Ross D.C. McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2042-2049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22328-22335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

(nonhydrolyzable ATP analog) or ADP, the side chain of Arg678 is sufficiently close to the nucleotide for bond formation with the ribose part (Fig. 1, upper and lower left panels, and Table 1) or even with the adenine ring (Fig. 1, lower right panel, and Table 1). The involvement of Arg678 in nucleotide binding and the binding mode may vary depending on conformational state. A role for Glu439 in nucleotide binding has been inferred from studies showing that mutation of Glu439 interferes with the protection by AMPPCP against proteolytic cleavage (35Ma H. Inesi G. Toyoshima C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28938-28943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15961-15969Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), these residues have been suggested to be part of the catalytic site and to be in contact with the nucleotide via the Mg2+ ion at site 2. Although an intervening water molecule seems to be needed to mediate interaction between this Mg2+ ion and Glu439 in the Ca2E1 crystal structures (the distance between Mg2+ and Glu439 being 4.9-5.3 Å; see Table 1 and Fig. 1, upper left panel), the crystal structure of the E2 form with bound AMPPCP suggests a closer interaction between the Mg2+ at site 2 and Glu439 (cf. Table 1 and Fig. 1, lower left panel), which might indicate that Glu439 is of importance for the binding of MgATP in the modulatory mode to the E2 form (10Jensen A-M. L. Sørensen T. L.-M. Olesen C. Møller J.V. Nissen P. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2305-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In Ref. 10Jensen A-M. L. Sørensen T. L.-M. Olesen C. Møller J.V. Nissen P. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2305-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar it was also speculated that the Mg2+ ion bound at site 2 by Glu439 might play an important role following phosphorylation, first by facilitating ADP dissociation, through attracting the Mg2+ and thereby the phosphoryl groups of ADP away from their binding in a catalytic configuration in Ca2E1P and acting as a flexible helping arm, and second through binding the modulatory ATP promoting the Ca2E1P → E2P transition (cf. Scheme 1). To clarify the roles of Arg678 and Glu439, we have determined the functional properties of Ca2+-ATPase mutants in which Arg678 or Glu439 is replaced by alanine. The function of the adjacent glycine residue Gly438, which appears too far away for direct interaction with the nucleotide or its associated Mg2+ (cf. Table 1 and Fig. 1), but is well conserved, was also examined by replacement with alanine. All the partial reactions of the Ca2+-ATPase reaction cycle indicated in Scheme 1 and their ATP dependences were analyzed in the mutants to address the effects of the mutations on the conformational changes of the enzyme as well as the interaction with ATP in catalytic as well as modulatory modes.TABLE 1Distances in published crystal structures between nucleotide/Mg and amino acid residues examined in the present studyCrystal structureDistance nucleotide/Mg-amino acid residue (closest distance and other relevant distances)Gly438Glu439Arg678Ca2·E1·CaaMg2+ or Ca2+ ion present at the “canonical” Mg2+ site 1. ·AMPPCP (PDB code 1T5S; see Ref. 6Sørensen T.L.

The data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using the SigmaPlot program (SPSS, Inc.) or by computation using the SimZyme program (48Sørensen T.L. Dupont Y. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5400-5408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Monoexponential functions were fitted to the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation time courses, except when the phosphorylation time course exhibited an overshoot. In the latter case the SimZyme program was used as described (48Sørensen T.L. Dupont Y. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5400-5408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A hyperbolic function plus a constant or linear component was fitted to the [γ-32P]TNP-8N3-ATP labeling data, and the “true” dissociation constant, KD, for ATP/MgATP binding was calculated from the measured K0.5 values using the validated equation for competitive inhibition (29McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25778-25789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For analysis of the modulatory effect of nucleotide (“N”) on the rates of the partial reaction steps, the nucleotide concentration dependence of the rate constant was fitted according to Equation 1. kobs=k0+(kmax-k0)[N]/(k0.5+[N])(Eq.1) Here, kobs is the rate constant observed at the indicated nucleotide concentration; k0 is the rate constant in the absence of nucleotide (“basic rate”), and kmax is the extrapolated value of the rate constant corresponding to infinite nucleotide concentration. The enhancement factor kmax/k0 describes the extent of the modulatory effect, and the K0.5 value describes the affinity for the modulatory nucleotide. Expression and Ca2+ Affinity—The expression levels of the three mutants, G438A, E439A, and R678A, were similar to that obtained with wild type Ca2+-ATPase, as evaluated by immunoreactivity in a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Like the wild type, all the mutants were able to form a phosphoenzyme in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and Ca2+, and the mutants showed an apparent Ca2+ affinity for activation similar to that of the wild type or slightly higher (supplemental Fig. S1). Phosphorylation Rate and Affinity for MgATP and ATP—The physiological substrate for phosphorylation of the enzyme in the Ca2E1 form is MgATP (cf. Scheme 1). Fig. 2 shows the time course of phosphorylation with 5 μm [γ-32P]MgATP of enzyme pre-equilibrated with Ca2+. The measured phosphorylation rate depends on the rate constant for transfer of the γ-phosphoryl group of the bound MgATP to Asp351 as well as the saturation of the catalytic site with MgATP. Because the MgATP concentration used is subsaturating in the wild type, any change of MgATP affinity induced by the mutations should be revealed in this experiment. Compared with the wild type, the phosphorylation rate was significantly reduced for G438A (to 80%) and R678A (to 50%), whereas it was wild type-like in E439A. The nucleotide binding properties of the mutants were examined in more detail by using a previously described and validated assay in which the ATPase is photolabeled with [γ-32P]TNP-8N3-ATP (29McIntosh D.B.

The [γ-32P]TNP-8N3-ATP concentration dependence of the photolabeling and the competitive inhibition with ATP/MgATP were studied. This assay was carried out with the enzyme being either in a Ca2+-free E1 state at pH 8.5 (50Forge V. Mintz E. Guillain F. J. Biol.

Besides allowing studies of nucleotide binding to an E2 form, the thapsigargin-bound state is pertinent as the E2 crystal structures have either thapsigargin or another inhibitor (CPA in Ref. 11Moncoq M.

https://openalex.org/W2117038992,"Late long-term potentiation (L-LTP) appears essential for the formation of long-term memory, with memories at least partly encoded by patterns of strengthened synapses. How memories are preserved for months or years, despite molecular turnover, is not well understood. Ongoing recurrent neuronal activity, during memory recall or during sleep, has been hypothesized to preferentially potentiate strong synapses, preserving memories. This hypothesis has not been evaluated in the context of a mathematical model representing biochemical pathways important for L-LTP. I incorporated ongoing activity into two such models: a reduced model that represents some of the essential biochemical processes, and a more detailed published model. The reduced model represents synaptic tagging and gene induction intuitively, and the detailed model adds activation of essential kinases by Ca. Ongoing activity was modeled as continual brief elevations of [Ca]. In each model, two stable states of synaptic weight resulted. Positive feedback between synaptic weight and the amplitude of ongoing Ca transients underlies this bistability. A tetanic or theta-burst stimulus switches a model synapse from a low weight to a high weight stabilized by ongoing activity. Bistability was robust to parameter variations. Simulations illustrated that prolonged decreased activity reset synapses to low weights, suggesting a plausible forgetting mechanism. However, episodic activity with shorter inactive intervals maintained strong synapses. Both models support experimental predictions. Tests of these predictions are expected to further understanding of how neuronal activity is coupled to maintenance of synaptic strength."

The present study focuses on transmembrane helix 3, which is highly conserved among the members of the SLC13 family. Fifteen amino acids in the extracellular half of transmembrane helix (amino acids 98–112) as well as Lys-84, previously shown to affect substrate affinity, were mutated individually to cysteine and expressed in the human retinal pigment epithelial cell line. Transport specificity ratio analysis shows that determinants for distinguishing succinate and citrate are found at amino acids Lys-84, Glu-101, Trp-103, His-106, and Leu-111. All of the mutants were tested for sensitivity to the membrane-impermeant cysteine-specific reagent (2-sulfonatoethyl) methanethiosulfonate (MTSES), but only K84C was sensitive to MTSES inhibition. The sensitivity of K84C to MTSES was greatest in the presence of sodium, and the inhibition could be prevented by addition of substrate or replacement of sodium, indicating that the accessibility of Lys-84 changes with conformational state. The substrate protection of MTSES inhibition of K84C appears to occur early in the transport cycle, before the large-scale conformational change associated with translocation of substrate. The results point to a new location for Lys-84 within the substrate access pore of the Na+/dicarboxylate cotransporter, either in a transmembrane helix or a reentrant loop facing a water-filled pore.

Physiol. 2006; 451: 597-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). NaDC1 plays a key role in the absorption of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates such as succinate and citrate across the apical membrane of the kidney proximal tubule and the small intestine (2Pajor A.M. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2006; 451: 597-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). NaDC1 participates in the renal secretion of organic anions, including drugs and xenobiotics, by contributing dicarboxylates to the organic anion/dicarboxylate exchangers (3Wright S.H. Dantzler W.H. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 987-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The activity of NaDC1 helps to regulate concentrations of citric acid cycle intermediates, which may affect such processes as the development of kidney stones (4Pak C.Y. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1991; 18: 624-637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) or blood pressure regulation via G-protein-coupled receptors for succinate and α-ketoglutarate in the proximal tubule (5He W. Miao F.J. Lin D.C. Schwandner R.T. Wang Z. Gao J. Chen J.L. Tian H. Ling L. Nature. 2004; 429: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Mutations in NaDC1 homologs from Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans lead to lifespan extension (6Rogina B. Reenan R.A. Nilsen S.P. Helfand S.L. Science. 2000; 290: 2137-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 7Fei Y.J. Inoue K. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6136-6144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), suggesting a potential role for NaDC1 in regulation of metabolism and aging. The current secondary structure model of NaDC1 contains 11 transmembrane helices (TM) with an extracellular carboxyl terminus containing a site for N-linked glycosylation and the amino terminus facing the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (8Zhang F.F. Pajor A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1511: 80-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Many of the functionally important residues for substrate and cation recognition are located in the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein (9Kahn E.S. Pajor A.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6151-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 10Pajor A.M. Sun N. Bai L. Markovich D. Sule P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1370: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, we have identified amino acids in TM9 and the connecting loop whose accessibility to extracellular reagents changes during the transport cycle (11Pajor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29961-29968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 12Pajor A.M. Randolph K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18728-18735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal half of the protein, in particular TM3, appears to be important in determining substrate specificity and affinity. For example, glutarate transport is determined primarily by residues found in TM3-TM4 (13Oshiro N. King S.C. Pajor A.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2302-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The sequence of TM3 and the connecting loops is highly conserved in the SLC13 family (Fig. 1). Lys-84, predicted to be in an intracellular loop at the base of TM3, was found to be important for succinate transport because replacement of Lys-84 with Ala produced a large decrease in succinate affinity (14Pajor A.M. Kahn E.S. Gangula R. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 677-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). His-106, at the extracellular part of TM3, is required for proper targeting of NaDC1 to the membrane (15Pajor A.M. Sun N. Valmonte H.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the present study we investigated the amino acids in the extracellular half of TM3 from Ile-98 to Arg-112, as well as Lys-84, using the substituted cysteine accessibility method used to study structure-function relationships in ion channels and transporters (16Javitch J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 296: 331-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 17Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). A total of sixteen residues in NaDC1 were mutated one at a time to cysteine, and the sensitivity of the substituted cysteines to the membrane-impermeant cysteine-specific reagents (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSES) and [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]-methane-thiosulfonate (MTSET) was then determined. TM3 in NaDC1 contains several residues involved in substrate recognition, Lys-84, Glu-101, Trp-103, His-106, and Leu-111, because their mutation to cysteine resulted in a change in transport specificity ratio (TSR). Of all the mutants, only K84C was sensitive to inhibition by MTSES, with differences in accessibility that parallel the exposure of the substrate binding site in NaDC1. The substrate protection of MTSES inhibition of K84C appears to occur early in the transport cycle, before the large-scale conformational change associated with translocation of substrate. The results indicate a new location for Lys-84, either in the transmembrane helix facing a water-filled pore or in a reentrant loop accessible to the outside. Construction of TM3 Cysteine Mutants—The cysteine mutants were made using the PCR-based QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The C476S mutant of rabbit (rb) NaDC1 in pcDNA3.1 vector was used as a template for mutagenesis. The rbNaDC1 contains an endogenous cysteine at position 476 that is sensitive to labeling by some cysteine-specific reagents such as p-chloromercuribenzesulfonate (18Pajor A.M. Krajewski S.J. Sun N. Gangula R. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 205-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although it is insensitive to hydrophilic methanethiosulfonate reagents such as MTSET (11Pajor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29961-29968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The cell surface expression of NaDC1 is related to the number of cysteines (18Pajor A.M. Krajewski S.J. Sun N. Gangula R. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 205-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the C476S mutant (containing ten of the eleven endogenous cysteines) was used to allow increased protein expression of the cysteine-substituted mutants, because the mutations can sometimes result in decreased activity. Our previous study showed that cysteine mutants made in the C476S background had the same results as constructs containing only three endogenous cysteines, but the protein expression and transport activity were higher in the C476S background (11Pajor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29961-29968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 12Pajor A.M. Randolph K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18728-18735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All mutants were verified by sequencing at the Protein Chemistry Laboratory of the University of Texas Medical Branch. Expression of TM3 Mutants in HRPE Cells—Human retinal pigment epithelial (HRPE) cells transformed with SV40 (AG 06096; Coriell Institute) were cultured in modified Eagle's medium containing Glutamax and 25 mm HEPES (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. HRPE cells were plated in 24-well plates for transport assays at a density of 1.2 × 105 cells/well or 6-well plates for biotinylation reactions at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well. Twenty-four hours after seeding, cells were transiently transfected with 1.8 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) and 0.6 μg of plasmid DNA (9:3 ratio) for 24-well plates or with 3 μl of FuGENE 6 and 1 μg of plasmid (3:1 ratio) for 6-well plates (12Pajor A.M. Randolph K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18728-18735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Transport Assays—Succinate and citrate transport assays were carried out 48 h after transfections as described previously (12Pajor A.M. Randolph K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18728-18735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For the standard assay, each well was washed twice with 1 ml of sodium buffer containing 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm d-glucose, 25 mm HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4 with 1 m Tris. Transport was measured by incubating the cells with 250 μl of sodium buffer containing 100 μm succinate (combination of [3H]succinate (ViTrax) and non-radioactive succinate). For citrate kinetic measurements, a combination of [14C]citrate (Amersham Biosciences GE Healthcare) and non-radioactive citrate was used. The surface radioactivity was removed with five washes of 1 ml of sodium buffer, lysed in 250 μl of 1% SDS for 60 min, and then transferred to scintillation vials for liquid scintillation counting. The uptake rates were corrected for background counts in control cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 vector alone. Kinetic constants were calculated by nonlinear regression to the Michaelis-Menten equation using SigmaPlot 2000 software (Jandel Scientific). Dual-label Competitive Transport Experiments—For dual-label transport assays, sodium buffer containing both 10 μm [3H]succinate and 20 μm [14C]citrate was added to the cells in 24-well plates and competitive transport of these substrates was measured as described previously (19Joshi A.D. Pajor A.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4231-4239Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The transport specificity ratio was calculated using TSR = (νsuccinate/νcitrate) × ([citrate]/[succinate]) where νsuccinate and νcitrate are the rates of transport of [3H]succinate and [14C]citrate, [citrate] and [succinate] are the concentrations of citrate and succinate (20King S.C. BMC Biochem. 2004; 5: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Chemical Labeling with MTSES—The NaDC1 mutants in HRPE cells were preincubated with 250 μl of 1 mm MTSES (Toronto Research Chemicals) in sodium buffer. For experiments with 1 mm MTSES, the reagent was weighed out fresh for each experiment, kept on ice, and diluted in buffer just before using. For experiments with 10 μm MTSES, a stock solution of 5 mm MTSES in water was kept dark and on ice and diluted in buffer just before using. Control groups were preincubated in sodium buffer without MTSES. After 20 min of incubation at room temperature (or ice, for temperature-dependence experiment), the cell monolayers were washed three times with sodium buffer and then assayed for succinate transport activity as described above. For cation replacement experiments, choline buffer was substituted for sodium buffer; for substrate protection experiments, the incubation with MTSES was done in the presence or absence of 10 mm succinate. Cell Surface Biotinylation and Total Protein Expression—Cell surface protein expression of NaDC1 was determined using a membrane-impermeant biotin reagent, Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce), and the biotinylated proteins were precipitated using ImmuoPure-immobilized streptavidin beads (Pierce) as described previously (15Pajor A.M. Sun N. Valmonte H.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The supernatants after centrifugation to separate the biotin-streptavidin-agarose bead complexes were transferred to new tubes for determination of intracellular protein abundance by immunoblotting in parallel with cell surface protein samples. The proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were probed with an anti-NaDC1 antibody applied at a dilution of 1:1000 at 4 °C overnight followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit Ig (Amersham Biosciences GE Healthcare) at a dilution of 1:5000 for 1 h. Antibody binding to NaDC1 was detected with the Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate kit (Pierce) as described (15Pajor A.M. Sun N. Valmonte H.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Images were acquired with an Image Station 440CF imager (Eastman Kodak Co.), and the intensity of protein bands was analyzed using Image 1D analysis software. MTSEA-Biotinylation—HRPE cells expressing NaDC1 mutants were pretreated with sodium buffer with or without 1 mm MTSES for 20 min at room temperature. The MTSES was removed with three washes of 3 ml of PBS/CM, pH 7.5 (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, with 1 mm Ca2+ and Mg2+). For each experiment, a 200-mm stock solution of N-biotinaminoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA-biotin; Toronto Research Chemicals) was prepared in Me2SO and kept cold and dark. The MTSEA-biotin was diluted to 2 mm with PBS/CM, pH 7.5, just before use and added to the cells for 30 min at room temperature with gentle rocking. The cells were rinsed with cold PBS/CM, pH 7.5. The remaining procedures were identical to those in the cell surface biotinylation protocol as described above. Cysteine-scanning Mutagenesis of Conserved Residues in TM3—The sequence alignment of amino acids in NaDC1 with other members of the SLC13 family shows the highly conserved region predicted to form TM3 and the connecting loops (Fig. 1). Fifteen amino acid residues from Ile-98 to Arg-112 as well as Lys-84, previously reported to affect substrate binding (14Pajor A.M. Kahn E.S. Gangula R. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 677-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were selected for cysteine-scanning mutagenesis in which the amino acids were replaced with cysteine one at a time. Protein Expression and Transport Activity of Cysteine-substituted Mutants—The cell surface expression of the mutants was monitored by biotinylation with the membrane-impermeant reagent Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin, followed by Western blotting. Total intracellular expression of the mutant proteins was also determined. Fig. 2 shows single representative blots of cell surface and total intracellular protein expression for each cysteine mutant compared with the parental transporter, the C476S mutant of rbNaDC1. The two bands on the Western blots represent differently glycosylated forms of the transporter (15Pajor A.M. Sun N. Valmonte H.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The blots were scanned to quantitate the protein expression, and each mutant was expressed as a percentage of the parental C476S protein abundance. The succinate transport activity and protein expression of the mutants are summarized in Fig. 3. Most of the cysteine substitutions were tolerated, as reflected in some measurable succinate transport activity in most of the cysteine mutants, ∼30–75% activity compared with the parental C476S. The majority of the mutants were expressed at the plasma membrane. Four of the mutants (V100C, L105C, R108C, and A110C) were either entirely inactive or had activity that was <5% of the parental transporter activity. L105C was absent from the plasma membrane and there was little intracellular protein. R108C was found to be absent from the plasma membrane although total intracellular expression was high, suggesting impairments in protein trafficking or stability. The other two mutants, V100C and A110C, were completely inactive despite a high level of cell surface expression, implying that these two residues have functionally important roles in succinate transport in NaDC1. TSR Analysis of Cysteine Mutants—TSR analysis was used to detect substrate-selective perturbations in catalytic specificity in the cysteine mutants. TSR is a method to compare the effects of site-directed mutagenesis on function by monitoring relative changes in catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of two substrates (20King S.C. BMC Biochem. 2004; 5: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). One great advantage to TSR analysis is that it is independent of protein expression, so that mutants with low expression can be analyzed even when the expression is too low for kinetic analysis. TSR is also valid over a wide range of substrate concentrations (20King S.C. BMC Biochem. 2004; 5: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To investigate whether substrate specificity determinants exist within TM3, cells expressing cysteine mutants with measurable transport activity were assessed by measuring competitive uptakes of [3H]succinate and [14C]citrate (Fig. 4A). The succinate:citrate TSR of most cysteine mutants and the C476S parental transporter were ∼3 (Fig. 4B), similar to wild-type rbNaDC1 (19Joshi A.D. Pajor A.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4231-4239Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Five mutants showed significant increases in TSR: K84C, E101C, W103C, H106C, and L111C (Fig. 4B). Consequently, these five residues might play an important role in distinguishing succinate from citrate in NaDC1. Functional Characteristics of Cysteine Mutants—The kinetics of succinate and citrate transport were measured in the cysteine mutants showing differences in TSR (K84C, E101C, W103C, H106C, and L111C). The time courses of uptake, measured between 1–15 min, were linear up to 6 min (data not shown); therefore, 6-min uptakes were chosen for subsequent kinetic study. As shown in Table 1, the mean apparent Km for succinate in K84C, W103C, H106C, and L111C was similar to that of the parental C476S transporter. The Km in E101C was significantly greater than the parental, by ∼2-fold. There were no significant differences between succinate Vmax values in any of the mutants compared with the parental C476S transporter. However, the decreased cell-surface protein abundance in E101C, W103C, H106C, and L111C (Fig. 3) indicates that the succinate kcat values of these mutants are likely to be increased relative to C476S.TABLE 1Succinate and citrate kinetics in cysteine-substituted mutantsNaDC1 mutantSuccinate kineticsCitrate kineticsKmVmaxNKmVmaxNμm% of C476Sμm% of C476SC476S25 ± 2100 ± 405203 ± 6100 ± 123K84C36 ± 863 ± 333617 ± 151*78 ± 53E101C50 ± 4*83 ± 314672 ± 126*16 ± 1*3W103C20 ± 3102 ± 443372 ± 52*111 ± 343H106C47 ± 842 ± 1631075 ± 91*36 ± 2*3L111C24 ± 0.350 ± 63487 ± 40*74 ± 83 Open table in a new tab There were differences in citrate kinetics between the substituted cysteine mutants and the C476S parental transporter (Table 1). All of the mutants had increased citrate Km values compared with C476S. Two of the mutants, E101C and H106C, also had much lower Vmax values, which were comparable with the abundance of these transporter proteins on the plasma membrane (Fig. 3). The increased TSR in the K84C, E101C, W103C, H106C, and L111C mutants indicates an increase in relative catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of succinate compared with citrate. Therefore, for many of the mutants, the TSR value reflects a combination of an increased catalytic efficiency for succinate and a decreased catalytic efficiency for citrate. It should be noted that the succinate Km value in C476S in the present study is ∼10-fold lower than we have previously reported. The succinate Km in wild-type rbNaDC1 is similar to that of C476S when expressed in HRPE cells (results not shown), and the succinate:citrate TSR values are also similar. Under two-electrode voltage clamp conditions, the Km for wild-type rbNaDC1 expressed in Xenopus oocytes is ∼180 μm at –50 mV (21Pajor A.M. Hirayama B.A. Loo D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18923-18929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In radiotracer uptake assays with Xenopus oocytes, not under voltage clamp, the Km for wild-type rbNaDC1 or the C476S mutant is between 0.2 and 0.5 mm (11Pajor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29961-29968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 22Griffith D.A. Pajor A.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7524-7531Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We have previously measured a Km of 0.5 mm for wild-type NaDC1 expressed in HRPE cells (19Joshi A.D. Pajor A.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4231-4239Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). At present we do not know why the Km values in this study are lower than in our previous studies. The cDNA has been resequenced to make sure there are no mutations, both authors of this report have done kinetic measurements of C476S and obtained similar results, and we have tested the effects of transport conditions (time points, preincubations) and cell passage number. The effect may be specific to the rbNaDC1 ortholog since the succinate Km for hNaDC1 expressed in HRPE cells is similar to that in oocytes, ∼0.7 mm (results not shown). All of the experiments reported in this study have compared mutant values with C476S in the same transfection experiment. MTSES Sensitivity of Cysteine Mutants—The twelve cysteine mutants with measurable transport activity were screened for their sensitivity to the membrane-impermeant thiol-reactive reagent MTSES. The mutant T482C, which is highly sensitive to MTSET, MTSEA, and MTSES (11Pajor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29961-29968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), was used as a positive control in each experiment. Of all the TM3 mutants, only K84C showed a decrease in transport activity after chemical labeling with MTSES (Fig. 5). None of the cysteine mutants between positions 98 and 112 was sensitive to inhibition by MTSES (1 mm (Fig. 5) or 10 mm (data not shown)). We also tested the cysteine mutants with MTSET (1 mm), which adds a positive charge, but it had no effect on any of the cysteine mutants, including K84C (data not shown). However, the MTSET does react with K84C, since pretreatment of cells expressing K84C with 1 mm MTSET prevented subsequent inhibition by MTSES (data not shown). Concentration Dependence of MTSES Inhibition—The concentration dependence of MTSES inhibition of K84C transport activity was next examined. As shown in Fig. 6, K84C was very sensitive to inhibition by MTSES, with an IC50 value of ∼6 μm. Therefore, a concentration of 10 μm MTSES was used in subsequent experiments. Effect of Substrate and Cations on the Accessibility of K84C Mutant—The transport process of NaDC1 follows an ordered binding mechanism in which three sodium ions bind first, followed by substrate (23Wright S.H. Hirayama B. Kaunitz J.D. Kippen I. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5456-5462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Yao X. Pajor A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F54-F64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether K84C is accessible to MTSES in different conformational states, the preincubation with MTSES was conducted in either sodium or choline buffer with or without succinate. The inhibition by MTSES in K84C was only seen when the preincubation was done in sodium buffer (Fig. 7A). When the sodium was replaced by choline, or when substrate was present, the effect of MTSES was prevented. Effect of Temperature on MTSES Inhibition—Substrate protection of MTSES labeling could be due to substrate binding preventing the access of MTSES to the cysteine or there could be a conformational change after substrate binding that occludes the substituted cysteine. At cold temperatures, large scale conformational changes of transporters are slowed down but substrate binding is not affected (25Parent L. Supplisson S. Loo D.D. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 125: 63-79PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wadiche J.I. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7650-7661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If the major effect of substrate protection is a conformational change due to translocation, then we would predict a reduction in substrate protection of MTSES inhibition at cold temperature. However, there was no change in substrate protection at cold temperatures in the K84C mutant (Fig. 7B). The K0.5 of substrate protection in K84C was ∼73 μm at room temperature compared with 79 μm at 4 °C. The K0.5 value agrees well with the Km value for succinate in this mutant (Table 1). At both temperatures, there was almost complete protection of transport activity with high concentrations of succinate. This result suggests that the effect of substrate protection in K84C is likely to be steric hindrance of chemical labeling by MTSES. Labeling of Substituted Cysteines with MTSEA-Biotin—Even though most of the TM3 cysteine mutants were insensitive to MTSES, it is possible that some residues might be accessible to MTSES labeling without any functional consequences. We therefore examined whether some of the substituted cysteines could be labeled directly with MTSEA-biotin. I98C and R112C were chosen because they are at both ends of the cysteine scan and exhibit relatively high protein expression (see Fig. 2). We have found in previous studies that proteins with low expression are difficult to detect after labeling with MTSEA-biotin; the sensitivity appears to be lower than that of sulfo-NHS-biotin labeling (12Pajor A.M. Randolph K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18728-18735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Additionally, we verified the accessibility of the cysteine substitution at position 84. The mutant T482C from our previous study was used as a positive control (12Pajor A.M. Randolph K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18728-18735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). There is some background binding of MTSEA-biotin to the C476S control, but this was not decreased by preincubation with MTSES (Fig. 8). The positive control, T482C, showed a large decrease in the MTSEA-biotin signal after incubation with MTSES. There was specific binding of MTSEA-biotin to the K84C and R112C mutants, verifying that they are accessible from the outside of the cell, but there was no specific binding to I98C (Fig. 8). Predicted TM 3 of the rabbit Na+/dicarboxylate cotransporter NaDC1 is highly conserved with other members of the SLC13 family. Our previous studies have shown that individual amino acids from TM3 and connecting loops in NaDC1 have important functions. For example, Ala replacement of Lys-84 decreases affinity for substrate (14Pajor A.M. Kahn E.S. Gangula R. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 677-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). His-106 at the extracellular part of the helix affects targeting of NaDC1 expressed in Xenopus oocytes (15Pajor A.M. Sun N. Valmonte H.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Differences in glutarate affinity between the rabbit and mouse NaDC1 are determined by residues in TM3 and 4 (13Oshiro N. King S.C. Pajor A.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2302-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that cysteine substitutions at the extracellular portion of TM3 (amino acids 98–112) do not produce transport inhibition by MTS reagents, although several of the amino acids in that region are involved in determining substrate selectivity. Lys-84, in contrast, was very sensitive to chemical labeling by MTSES and exhibited its greatest accessibility to the reagent in the presence of sodium. Lys-84 is likely to be located within the substrate binding pocket, and it undergoes conformational changes in accessibility to the outside during the transport cycle. The results indicate a new location for Lys-84 either in a membrane helix facing a water-filled pore or in a reentrant loop. TSR analysis is used to identify mutations in transporters that produce changes in relative catalytic efficiency or specificity (kcat/Km) of one substrate compared with another (20King S.C. BMC Biochem. 2004; 5: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The mutations at amino acids Glu-101, Trp-103, His-106, and Leu-111 resulted in increases in succinate:citrate TSR values. These amino acids are highly conserved among the members of the SLC13 family (Fig. 1). The increased TSR could be, at least in part, determined by an increased kcat for succinate because there was no change in Vmax but a decrease in cell surface protein expression. The changes in TSR could also be determined by decreased catalytic efficiency for citrate because all of the mutants with altered TSR had decreased citrate affinity. Because the mutations themselves did not alter succinate Km and treatment with MTSES or MTSET had no effect on the activity of the mutants, it is possible that the residues determine substrate selectivity indirectly by affecting transporter flexibility or by holding other key residues in position. Mutations far from the active site in proteins can perturb catalytic rate by altering conformational mobility of the entire protein (27Wong K.F. Selzer T. Benkovic S.J. Hammes-Schiffer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6807-6812Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Cysteine replacement of two residues in TM3, Val-100 and Ala-110, resulted in inactive proteins although the proteins were present on the plasma membrane, suggesting that these amino acids are critical for transport activity in NaDC1. The positions of these critical amino acids are adjacent to Glu-101 and Leu-111, both of which are involved in determining substrate selectivity, confirming that this region is important functionally. Cysteine replacement of Lys-84 had no effect on succinate kinetics, indicating that this residue is not likely to be directly involved in succinate binding, but the citrate Km was increased ∼2-fold. The increase in TSR, therefore, reflects changes in citrate transport by this mutant. In our previous study, alanine substitution at position 84 had no effect on sodium affinity but resulted in a large decrease in succinate affinity with a Km of 2.2 mm (14Pajor A.M. Kahn E.S. Gangula R. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 677-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is not clear why the cysteine substitution at position 84 would have no effect on succinate Km since it also represents a charge neutralization and replacement with a much smaller side chain. There was also no effect of chemical labeling of K84C with MTSET, which should restore the positive charge. However, charge reversal at position 84 by chemical modification with MTSES, which adds a negative charge, produced inhibition of transport. The substrate binding sites of all of the known structural models of ion-coupled transport proteins, including the H+-coupled lactose permease (28Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar), Na+-dependent leucine transporter LeuTAa (29Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar), and the Na+-dependent aspartate transporter GltPh (30Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), are located within aqueous cavities formed by multiple helices. In LeuTAa, the cation and substrate binding sites are located very close together and are formed, in part, by unwound regions of transmembrane helices (29Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). Several of the MTS derivatives, including MTSES and MTSET, are membrane-impermeant reagents that label cysteine residues in an aqueous environment (16Javitch J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 296: 331-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 17Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). The impermeant MTS reagents can be used to map cysteine residues located in extracellular loops or in water-filled pores, such as the substrate access and binding pores of membrane proteins. The cysteine-scanning approach, particularly when compared with protein crystal structures, is beginning to provide detailed information on conformational changes in ion-coupled transport proteins. The mammalian Na+/Cl–-serotonin transporter SERT exhibits changes in reactivity of substituted cysteines that relate well to the crystal structure of its bacterial homolog LeuTAa (31Rudnick G. J. Membr. Biol. 2006; 213: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For example, cysteine substitutions of residues in TM5 of SERT, predicted to form part of the cytoplasmic substrate permeation pathway, exhibit decreased accessibility with inhibitor binding, which locks the transporter in an outward-facing conformation. The same substituted cysteines in SERT have increased reactivity with MTS reagents in the presence of ions and substrate, reflecting conformational changes associated with transport (32Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36213-36220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The mammalian glutamate transporters EAAT1 and GLT-1 also exhibit changes in conformation that can be detected by accessibility of substituted cysteines. For example, the relative positions of the two opposing hairpin loops, thought to form substrate access gates in the crystal structure of the archeal homolog GltPh (30Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), change during the transport cycle in both EAAT1 and GLT-1 (33Leighton B.H. Seal R.P. Watts S.D. Skyba M.O. Amara S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29788-29796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 34Shlaifer I. Kanner B.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 1341-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The lactose permease also exhibits changes in substituted cysteine accessibility upon substrate binding (35Kaback H.R. Dunten R. Frillingos S. Venkatesan P. Kwaw I. Zhang W. Ermolova N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). When superimposed on the crystal structure of the inward-facing conformation of the lactose permease, residues that exhibited increased N-ethylmaleimide labeling in the presence of substrate were found to be located away from the substrate binding site and near the periplasmic surface of the protein. In contrast, decreased N-ethylmaleimide labeling in the presence of substrate (substrate protection) was seen in cysteines located near the inward-facing substrate binding cavity and at the cytoplasmic ends of helices, also an indication of conformational changes that occur with substrate binding. The transport cycle of NaDC1 involves ordered binding of three sodium ions followed by a divalent anion substrate (23Wright S.H. Hirayama B. Kaunitz J.D. Kippen I. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5456-5462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Yao X. Pajor A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F54-F64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The accessibility of K84C to MTSES seems to parallel the exposure of the substrate binding site. The inhibition by MTSES was seen in the presence, but not the absence, of sodium, and the addition of substrate produced substrate protection. The succinate K0.5 for substrate protection of MTSES inhibition was ∼79 μm, similar to the transport Km of 25 μm. In the absence of sodium the transporter is in a conformational state that prevents accessibility of MTSES to the substituted cysteine at position 84 by placing it in a lipid environment or between two helices that do not have an aqueous pore open to the outside of the cell. Sodium binding triggers a conformational change in NaDC1 in which the helices may tilt or rotate to allow exposure of the substrate binding site and subsequent increase in substrate affinity. This is also the conformation in which the cysteine at position 84 is most accessible to extracellularly applied MTS reagents. The fully loaded transporter containing the sodium and substrate undergoes a large conformational change to translocate all substrates to the opposite side of the membrane. Substrate protection could occur either by occlusion of the cysteine at position 84 as a result of the conformational change or by steric hindrance produced by substrate binding. The large scale conformational changes of transporters are inhibited in the cold, although substrate binding is not affected by temperature (25Parent L. Supplisson S. Loo D.D. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 125: 63-79PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wadiche J.I. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7650-7661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because cold temperature did not affect substrate protection in K84C, it is likely that substrate binding produces steric hindrance of MTSES binding and this occurs at an early state in the transport cycle prior to translocation. Therefore, the Lys-84 residue is most likely located in the water-filled cavity that contains the substrate binding site. Our previous model of TM3 was based on hydropathy analysis and placed Lys-84 in an intracellular loop between TM2 and 3 (8Zhang F.F. Pajor A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1511: 80-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 36Pajor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5779-5785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, the present study provides experimental evidence that Lys-84 is accessible to the outside of the cell, indicating that it is located either on the extracellular side of the membrane or in an aqueous pore or cavity. We also found that R112C is located extracellularly, since it can be labeled with MTSEA-biotin, and I98C is located either intracellularly or within the membrane in a transmembrane helix, since it was not labeled by MTSEA-biotin. Two alternative models of the TM3 region of NaDC1 are shown in Fig. 9. In one model, Lys-84 is located in the transmembrane helix, with part of the helix forming the substrate binding cavity or access pore. If this model is correct, the size of the substrate access pore would be large enough to accommodate MTSEA-biotin, at least as far as Lys-84. In the second model, Lys-84 is located in a reentrant loop that lines an aqueous pore forming the substrate binding pocket. Further experiments will be needed to distinguish between the two models. In conclusion, this study has shown that the conserved residue at Lys-84 and amino acids at the extracellular half of TM3 are functionally important in NaDC1. Residues in TM3 include Ala-100 and Val-110, which produced inactive proteins when mutated to cysteine, and Glu-101, Trp-103, His-106, and Leu-111, which contain determinants of substrate selectivity although these residues may participate indirectly in substrate binding and translocation. Lys-84 is probably located within the substrate binding cavity of NaDC1. The sensitivity of the K84C mutant to MTSES inhibition was greatest in the presence of sodium, and inhibition could be prevented by addition of substrate or replacement of sodium, indicating that the accessibility of Lys-84 changes with conformational state. The substrate protection of MTSES inhibition of K84C appears to occur early in the transport cycle, before the large scale conformational change associated with translocation of substrate. The results indicate a new location for Lys-84 in the substrate access pore formed in part by the transmembrane helix or a reentrant loop."

Thus, understanding the molecular details underlying nACh receptor expression will shed light on various aspects of neural development and function as well as contribute to our understanding of several neuropathological conditions.

For example, it is possible that they are coordinately expressed via a common regulatory mechanism. However, although the genes exhibit overlapping expression patterns, these patterns are not identical either temporally or spatially suggesting that in addition to a possible common regulatory mechanism, these genes are most likely subject to independent regulation as well. In this regard, it is important to note that a growing body of evidence suggests that the α3 and β4 subunit genes may be coordinately expressed, whereas the α5 gene may be independently regulated (47Winzer-Serhan U.H.

The majority of the regulatory elements thus far described are involved in activating transcription and are located upstream of the nACh receptor genes that they regulate. We report here the identification and initial characterization of a highly conserved sequence in the fifth intron of the α3 subunit gene (referred to hereafter as “α3 intron 5”). We show that this intronic sequence is capable of repressing the transcriptional activities of the α3 and β4 subunit gene promoters and does so in a cell type-specific manner. In addition, we demonstrate that this repressive activity occurs independently of its position relative to the promoter and is also orientation-independent. Finally, we show that the intronic sequence directly interacts with nuclear proteins. Amplification of α3 Intron 5 from Genomic DNA—The PCR was used to amplify α3 intron 5 from genomic DNA. Two primers were designed for this purpose. The sequence of the upper primer was 5′-CGCCTCGAGCACAGGGATAAGGGTCATTTC-3′, and the sequence for the lower primer was 5′-GGCGGTACCCACAGTTTAGGTAGGGCTCAA-3′. The underlined sequences indicate XhoI (upper) and KpnI (lower) restriction endonuclease sites added to the primers to facilitate cloning of the amplified product. The following PCR protocol was used: 5 min at 94 °C (1 cycle), 1 min at 94 °C, 45 s at 53 °C, and 70 s at 72 °C (1 cycle); then 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 58 °C, and 70 s at 72 °C (30 cycles); and finally, 7 min at 72 °C. The expected and observed size for the amplified product was 1,078 bp. Plasmids—The 1,078-bp α3 intron 5 PCR product was digested with XhoI and KpnI and cloned into XhoI/KpnI-digested pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) resulting in the construct pBSA3I5XK. The α3 and β4 promoter regions were subcloned into the pGL3-Basic luciferase vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The α3 promoter sequence (nucleotides -2,036 to +64, relative to the major α3 transcriptional start site) was isolated from pX1A3HS (74Liu Q. Melnikova I.N. Hu M. Gardner P.D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9747-9755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as follows: pX1A3HS was linearized with HindIII generating a 3′-overhang that was subsequently blunt-ended using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. The promoter sequence was liberated from the vector by digestion with XhoI and then subcloned into SmaI/XhoI-digested pGL3-Basic yielding the construct pG3A3HX. The β4 promoter sequence (nucleotides -89 to +137, relative to the major β4 transcriptional start site) was isolated from pXIB4FH (74Liu Q. Melnikova I.N. Hu M. Gardner P.D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9747-9755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by digestion with HindIII and XhoI. The resulting HindIII/XhoI fragment was subcloned into HindIII/XhoI-digested pGL3-Basic yielding the construct pG3B4FH. The following paragraphs describe how α3 intron 5 was subcloned upstream and downstream of the α3 and β4 promoters. To carry out the downstream subcloning, it was necessary to first subclone α3 intron 5 from pBSA3I5XK into BamHI/SalI-digested pGL3-Basic generating the intermediate construct pG3A3ID. This was followed by subcloning the α3 and β4 promoters into pG3A3ID as follows. pXIA3HS was linearized with HindIII generating a 3′-overhang that was subsequently blunt-ended using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. The α3 promoter sequence was liberated from the vector by digestion with XhoI and then subcloned into SmaI/XhoI-digested pG3A3ID generating the construct pG3A3A3ID. The β4 promoter sequence was isolated from pXIB4FH by digestion with KpnI and SalI and then subcloned into KpnI/XhoI-digested pG3A3ID generating the construct pG3B4A3ID. To subclone α3 intron 5 into pG3A3HX upstream with respect to the α3 promoter, the intronic sequence was isolated from pBSKA3IXK by first linearizing with KpnI and then using the exonuclease activity of T4 DNA polymerase to create a blunt end. The α3 intron 5 sequence was released from the vector by digestion with XbaI. This product was subcloned into pG3A3HX, which was first linearized with MluI, treated with Klenow to blunt-end the 3′-overhang, and then digested with NheI. The new construct was named pG3A3A3IU. To subclone the intronic sequence upstream with respect to the β4 promoter, α3 intron 5 was isolated from pBSKA3IXK by first linearizing with KpnI and then using the exonuclease activity of T4 DNA polymerase to create a blunt end. The α3 intron 5 sequence was released from the vector by digestion with XhoI. The blunt-end/XhoI intronic sequence was subcloned into SmaI/XhoI-digested pG3B4FH generating the construct pG3B4A3IU. The α3 intron 5 sequence was subcloned in both orientations upstream of the β4 promoter. Subcloning in the 5′ → 3′ orientation was described in the previous paragraph (construct pG3B4A3IU). To subclone the intronic sequence in the 3′ → 5′ orientation, α3 intron 5 was isolated from pBSKA3IXK by first linearizing with KpnI and then using the exonuclease activity of T4 DNA polymerase to create a blunt end. The intronic sequence was released from the vector by digestion with XbaI. The blunt-end/XbaI intronic sequence was subcloned into SmaI/NheI-digested pG3B4FH generating the construct pG3B4A3INM. PCR was used to generate a set of 5′ and 3′ deletions of α3 intron 5 using pBSA3I5XK as the parental construct. Six primers were designed for this purpose (see Fig. 7 for a schematic representation of the deletions). The primer sequences and combinations are shown in Table 1. To facilitate subcloning, a BamHI recognition sequence was added to the 5′-end of the primers along with three additional nucleotides. The following PCR protocol was performed using a MyCycler thermal cycler (Bio-Rad): 5 min at 94 °C (1 cycle), 30 s at 94 °C, 45 s at 60 °C, and 45 s at 72 °C (30 cycles), followed by 7 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were subcloned into BamHI-digested pG3B4FH yielding the constructs pG3B4Ad, pG3B4Bd, pG3B4Cd, and pG3B4Dd. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing (Nucleic Acid Facility, University of Massachusetts Medical School).TABLE 1Sequences of primers used for creating deletions of α3 intron 5 The BamHI recognition site added to each primer to facilitate subcloning is indicated by the underlining.Primer nameSequencePaired primer for PCRDeletion createdU10A3IB5′-CGCGGATCCCACAGGGATAAGGGTCA-3′L336A3IB5′-CGCGGATCCAGAATCCTAATGCCCTG-3′U10A3IBpG3B4AL725A3IB5′-CGCGGATCCCCCACCTTACCAAATGA-3′U10A3IBpG3B4BL1051A3IB5′-CGCGGATCCCAGTTTAGGTAGGGCTC-3′U894A3IB5′-CGCGGATCCTCTAACAAAGGCTCCAG-3′L1051A3IBpG3B4CU724A3IB5′-CGCGGATCCGTCATTTGGTAAGGTGG-3′L1051A3IBpG3B4D Open table in a new tab Cell Culture and Reporter Gene Assays—Cell lines were maintained and transfected as described previously (74Liu Q. Melnikova I.N. Hu M. Gardner P.D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9747-9755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, SN17 (78Hammond D.N. Lee H.J. Tonsgard J.H. Wainer B.H. Brain Res. 1990; 512: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and NIH3T3 cells (79Jainchill J.L. Aaronson S.A. Todaro G.J. J. Virol. 1969; 4: 549-553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were transfected using a calcium phosphate procedure (Invitrogen), whereas PC12 cells (80Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4803) Google Scholar) were transfected using a liposome-mediated approach (Lipofectamine, Invitrogen). Each cell line was transfected with the indicated test plasmid and a β-galactosidase expression vector, pRSVβGal. PC12 cells were differentiated with 100 ng/ml nerve growth factor (NGF; Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) for 7 days after transfection. Cells were harvested either 48 h (SN17 and NIH3T3) or 7 days (PC12) following transfection and were assayed for luciferase (Luciferase Assay System, Promega) and β-galactosidase (Galacto-Star, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) activities in a Lumimark microplate luminometer (Bio-Rad). To correct for differences in transfection efficiencies between dishes, the luciferase activity in each sample was normalized to β-galactosidase activity in that same sample. Statistical analysis was done using the Student's t test. Real Time Quantitative PCR—Real time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR was done using total RNA isolated from NGF-treated PC12, SN17, and NIH3T3 cells using a commercially available kit (RNeasy midi kit, Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA). cDNA was synthesized from equal amounts of RNA (Retroscript, Ambion, Austin, TX) using primers specific for either the rodent α3 or β4 nACh receptor subunit genes. In addition to the nACh receptor genes, PCR was done with primers specific for cyclophilin for use as an internal control. The primer pairs used were as follows: α3, 5′-CGCCTGTTCCAGTACCTGTT-3′ and 5′-CTTCAGCCACAGGTTGGTTT-3′; β4, 5′-GCCTGGAGCTATCACTGTCC-3′ and 5′-CAGGCGGTAGTCAGTCCATT-3′; cyclophilin, 5′-AGCATACAGGTCCTGGCATC-3′ and 5′-TTCACCTTCCCAAAGACCAC-3′. Relative quantification was determined using an ABI 7500 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems) measuring real time SybrGreen (Bio-Rad) fluorescence. Calculations were done using the ΔΔCt method. Overall efficiencies of PCR were calculated from the slopes of the standard curves and were >95% for each primer pair. NGF-treated PC12 cells were used as a calibrator, and cyclophilin was used as an internal control. A cDNA clone for each gene was used as a positive control. Statistical analysis was done using the Student's t test. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared from SN17 cells using commercially available reagents (NE-PER extraction reagents, Pierce). For protein-DNA binding reactions, 0.5, 1, and 2 μg of nuclear extract were combined with binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, 2 μg of bovine serum albumin). The binding reactions were incubated at room temperature for 5 min and then combined with a DNA mixture containing 20 fmol of γ-32P-labeled DNA probe and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). For competition experiments, specific competitors at 100-fold molar excess were added to the reaction. Following incubation at room temperature for 15 min, samples were loaded, without tracking dye, onto 4% nondenaturing acrylamide/bisacrylamide (40:1) gels in 1% TBE buffer. Electrophoresis was performed for 2-3 h at 185 V. Gels were dried under vacuum and subjected to autoradiography. In an attempt to identify potentially important regulatory sequences within the β4/α3/α5 gene cluster region (Fig. 1a), an alignment was done using the human and mouse genomic sequences. As shown in Fig. 1b, the expected high degree of conservation between exonic sequences was seen, particularly between the putative membrane-spanning regions. In addition, again as expected, there was relatively little conservation (<50%) between intronic sequences (Fig. 1b) with one notable exception: there was a striking degree of conservation (>50% identity) between an ∼1-kb region of the fifth intron of the human and mouse α3 subunit genes (Fig. 1b). As discussed below, this conservation extends to the rat genome. The high conservation between exonic sequences can be explained by conservation of protein function. Clearly, such an argument does not apply to conserved intronic sequences. However, there is a growing realization that conserved intronic sequences play a role in the regulation of gene expression and do so at the level of transcription (81Finkbeiner S. Sci. STKE 2001. 2001; : PE1Google Scholar, 82Fedorova L. Fedorov A. Genetica (The Hague). 2003; 118: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 83Hare M.P. Palumbi S.R. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2003; 20: 969-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the experiments that follow, we tested the hypothesis that α3 intron 5 functions as a transcriptional regulatory region involved in the expression of the nACh receptor α3 and β4 subunit genes. As an initial test of the potential role of α3 intron 5 in nACh receptor gene expression, the intronic sequence was subcloned downstream of the α3 and β4 subunit gene promoters in the context of a luciferase reporter vector (Fig. 2). Each reporter construct was transiently transfected into NIH3T3 fibroblasts and into PC12 cells that were subsequently differentiated with NGF. As shown in Fig. 2, the presence of the intronic sequence decreased α3 promoter activity ∼40% and β4 promoter activity ∼70% in NIH3T3 cells. In contrast, α3 intron 5 had no effect on either α3 or β4 promoter activity in differentiated PC12 cells (Fig. 2). These data suggest the presence of negative transcriptional regulatory sequences in α3 intron 5 and furthermore that the transcriptional effect of the sequences is cell type-specific. As described below, these studies were extended to another cell line, SN17, a line derived from mouse septal cholinergic neurons (78Hammond D.N. Lee H.J. Tonsgard J.H. Wainer B.H. Brain Res. 1990; 512: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). First, however, quantitative RT-PCR was carried out to determine the expression levels of the α3 and β4 subunit genes in each of the three cell lines. As expected, NGF-treated PC12 cells express relatively high levels of both genes, whereas no expression of either gene was detected in NIH3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 3). Interestingly, expression of the α3 and β4 genes in SN17 cells"

While it is thought that these fates dictate the direction of ommatidial rotation, the phenotype of mutants in the genes that set up this polarity led to the hypothesis that these two events could be uncoupled.To definitively demonstrate these events are genetically separable, we conducted a dominant modifier screen to determine if genes, when misexpressed, could selectively enhance subclasses of mutant ommatidia in which the direction of rotation does not follow the R3/R4 cell fates, yet not affect the number of ommatidia in which rotation follows the R3/R4 cell fates. We identified a subset of P element lines that exhibit this selective enhancement. We also identified lines that behave in the opposite manner: They enhance the number of ommatidia that rotate in the right direction, but do not alter the number of ommatidia that rotate incorrectly with respect to the R3/R4 fates.These results indicate that fate and direction of rotation can be genetically separated, and that there are genes that act between R3/R4 fate specification and direction of ommatidial rotation. These data affirm what has been a long-standing assumption about the genetic control of ommatidial polarity."
