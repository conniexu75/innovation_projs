https://openalex.org/W2006918309,"There is currently no effective therapy for human prion diseases. However, several polyanionic glycans, including pentosan sulfate and dextran sulfate, prolong the incubation time of scrapie in rodents, and inhibit the production of the scrapie isoform of the prion protein (PrPSc), the major component of infectious prions, in cultured neuroblastoma cells. We report here that pentosan sulfate and related compounds rapidly and dramatically reduce the amount of PrPC, the non-infectious precursor of PrPSc, present on the cell surface. This effect results primarily from the ability of these agents to stimulate endocytosis of PrPC, thereby causing a redistribution of the protein from the plasma membrane to the cell interior. Pentosan sulfate also causes a change in the ultrastructural localization of PrPC, such that a portion of the protein molecules are shifted into late endosomes and/or lysosomes. In addition, we demonstrate, using PrP-containing bacterial fusion proteins, that cultured cells express saturable and specific surface binding sites for PrP, many of which are glycosaminoglycan molecules. Our results raise the possibility that sulfated glycans inhibit prion production by altering the cellular localization of PrPC precursor, and they indicate that endogenous proteoglycans are likely to play an important role in the cellular metabolism of both PrPC and PrPSc.

Prion diseases are a group of transmissible, neurodegenerative disorders including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, kuru, Gerstmann-Sträussler syndrome, and fatal familial insomnia in human beings, as well as bovine spongiform encephalopathy and scrapie in animals (reviewed by Gajdusek(1990) and Prusiner and DeArmond (1994)). The major component of infectious prion particles is a protein called PrP 1The abbreviations used are: PrPScscrapie isoform of the prion proteinCHOChinese hamster ovarychPrPchicken prion proteinECLenhanced chemiluminescenceGAGglycosaminoglycanPBSphosphate-buffered salinePIPLCphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase CPrPprion proteinPrPCcellular isoform of the prion proteinPSpentosan sulfate. (Prusiner et al., 1984; Bolton et al., 1987). PrP is a posttranslationally modified isoform of PrPC, a glycolipid-anchored, plasma membrane protein of unknown function that is widely expressed on neurons and glia in the central nervous system (Oesch et al., 1985; Stahl et al., 1987; Harris et al., 1993a). Prion replication is thought to involve conversion of endogenous PrPC into infectious PrPSc, although the cellular and molecular details of this process are poorly understood (Prusiner et al., 1990; Büeler et al., 1993; Kocisko et al., 1994). Recent evidence suggests that the two isoforms differ in their three-dimensional conformation, and that transformation of α-helices into β-sheets plays a role in formation of PrPSc (Caughey et al., 1991a; Safar et al., 1993; Pan et al., 1993). scrapie isoform of the prion protein Chinese hamster ovary chicken prion protein enhanced chemiluminescence glycosaminoglycan phosphate-buffered saline phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C prion protein cellular isoform of the prion protein pentosan sulfate. There are currently no effective therapies for human prion diseases, although several chemotherapeutic agents have been tested in animal models (Pocchiari et al., 1991; Ingrosso et al., 1995). Polyanionic glycans such as pentosan sulfate (PS) and dextran sulfate have been among the most intensively studied (Ehlers and Diringer, 1984; Kimberlin and Walker, 1986; Farquhar and Dickinson, 1986; Diringer and Ehlers, 1991; Ladogana et al., 1992). These agents were initially tested because they were known to be active against conventional DNA and RNA viruses, but it was found that they were also effective in vivo against infection by scrapie prions, prolonging the incubation time, and in some cases, completely preventing the development of symptoms when administered prophylactically to mice and hamsters. Caughey and colleagues have recently investigated the mechanism of this effect at the cellular level. They showed that the disulfonated, amyloid-binding dye Congo red, as well as glycans such as pentosan sulfate and dextran sulfate inhibit prion replication and PrPSc accumulation in scrapie-infected neuroblastoma cells (Caughey and Race, 1992; Caughey et al., 1993; Caughey and Raymond, 1993); similar results have also been obtained by Gabizon et al.(1993) using low molecular weight heparin. These effects were proposed to result from a direct interaction between the inhibitors and PrP, based on the observation that PrPC binds in vitro to beads containing immobilized Congo red or heparin (Caughey et al., 1994). Because the agents tested are structurally related to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) synthesized by cells, these workers have further suggested that PrPC and/or PrPSc bind to endogenous GAG chains, and that competitive inhibition of this association is responsible for the negative effect of the compounds on prion synthesis (Priola and Caughey, 1994). The proposal that PrP interacts with cellular GAGs is consistent with the fact that amyloid plaques in scrapie-infected brain often contain sulfated proteoglycans (Snow et al., 1990; Gulroy et al., 1991). However, direct evidence for the existence of GAG-related binding sites on cells for either PrPC or PrPSc has been lacking. Also unknown is how sulfated glycans and Congo red affect the cellular trafficking of PrP. This is an important question, since alterations in the trafficking and localization of either PrPC or PrPSc might alter the efficiency of prion production. Recent studies of scrapie-infected neuroblastoma cells suggest that conversion of PrPC to PrPSc takes place either on the plasma membrane or along an endocytic pathway (Caughey et al., 1991b; Caughey and Raymond, 1991; Borchelt et al., 1992; Taraboulos et al., 1992). Our own studies strongly support this conclusion, since we have shown that PrPC constitutively cycles between the cell surface and an endocytic compartment, with a transit time of ∼60 min in cultured neuroblastoma cells (Shyng et al., 1993), and that internalization of PrPC is mediated by clathrin-coated pits (Shyng et al., 1994). These results identify early endosomes and clathrin-coated vesicles as potential sites for the generation of PrPSc. Conceivably, chemotherapeutic agents could act by redistributing PrPC or PrPSc away from these or other relevant cellular compartments. To understand how sulfated glycans act to prevent prion production in cultured cells, we have examined the effect of these compounds on the cellular trafficking of PrPC, the precursor of PrPSc, with particular emphasis on the endocytic pathway. We report here that PS, as well as several other polyanions, dramatically decrease the amount of PrPC on the surface of neuroblastoma cells by enhancing its rate of endocytosis. PS also redistributes a portion of the PrP molecules from early to late endocytic compartments. In addition, we demonstrate, using PrP-containing bacterial fusion proteins, that cultured cells express GAG-containing surface binding sites for PrP. Our results raise the possibility that sulfated anions inhibit prion synthesis by altering the cellular localization of the PrPC precursor, and they suggest that endogenous proteoglycans are likely to play an important role in the cellular metabolism of both PrPC and PrPSc. Rabbit antisera raised against bacterial fusion proteins encompassing amino acids 35-96 or 144-220 of chPrP (Harris et al., 1993b) were used to recognize wild-type and Δ25-91 chPrPs, respectively. A rabbit antiserum raised against a synthetic peptide encompassing amino acids 45-66 of mouse PrP was used to recognize mouse PrP (Shyng et al., 1995). A rat monoclonal antibody (Ig11) raised against the mouse lysosomal membrane protein lgp120 was obtained from Hugh Rosen (Merck). Cell culture reagents were from the Tissue Culture Support Center at Washington University. Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC) was prepared as described previously (Shyng et al., 1995). Amylose resin was obtained from New England Biolabs, and gold-conjugated secondary antibodies from Jackson Immunoresearch. Heparitinase (heparin lyase III) was purchased from Sigma or ICN, and N-glycosidase F from Boehringer Mannheim. All other reagents were from Sigma. This study employed untransfected mouse N2a neuroblastoma cells (ATCC CCL131), as well as stably transfected clones of N2a cells expressing either wild-type chPrP (line A26), or Δ25-91 chPrP (Harris et al., 1993b; Shyng et al., 1995). Cells were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, non-essential amino acids, and penicillin/streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells deficient in xylose transferase (clone 745), as well as wild-type CHO K1 cells, were kindly provided by Dr. Jeffrey Esko (Esko, 1991). To release cell surface PrP, cultures were treated with PIPLC (1 unit/ml) in Opti-MEM at 4°C for 2 h. Proteins were precipitated from the PIPLC incubation medium with at least four volumes of methanol at −20°C, collected by centrifugation, and immunoblotted with anti-PrP antibodies using ECL for visualization. Films were digitized using an HP ScanJet II scanner, and band intensities quantitated using SigmaScan/Image (Jandel Scientific). For metabolic labeling, confluent cultures were incubated for 30 min in serum-free Opti-MEM lacking methionine, and then for 30 min in the same medium containing ICN Tran 35S-Label (250 μCi/ml, 1,000 Ci/mmol). In some cases, cells were chased in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), and were treated with PIPLC as described above. Cell lysates were incubated with 0.01 units/ml N-glycosidase F at 37°C for 16 h to cleave N-linked oligosaccharides, and PrP immunoprecipitated as described previously (Harris et al., 1993b). Radiolabeled PrP was quantitated by imaging of SDS-PAGE gels using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Endocytosis of PrP was quantitated using either surface biotinylation or surface iodination, both as described previously (Shyng et al., 1995). Cells were incubated for 1 h at 4°C in PBS containing 125I-transferrin (2 μM), and after washing, they were transferred to Opti-MEM containing 100 nM unlabeled transferrin with or without PS for 30 min at 37°C. Prior to lysis, cells were treated with 0.25% Pronase to remove surface 125I-transferrin. The amount of internalized 125I-transferrin was determined by counting the radioactivity in the cell lysates. A26 cells were labeled with antibodies against chPrP 35-96 for 2 h at 4°C and were then warmed to 37°C for 1 h in the presence or absence of PS. Cells were then washed with PBS, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde for 2 h, and scraped off the dish using a rubber policeman. The suspended cells were then collected by centrifugation, washed in PBS, and pelleted through 10% gelatin. Cells were infused with 2.3 M sucrose for 48 h at 4°C, and after freezing in liquid nitrogen, 100-nm cryosections were cut at −90°C on a Reichert-Jung UltraCut equipped with an FC4E Cryosystem (Leica). Sections were incubated sequentially with goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to 6-nm gold particles, a rat monoclonal antibody against lgp120, and goat anti-rat antibodies coupled to 12-nm gold particles. For quantitating colocalization of PrP and lgp120, 6- and 12-nm gold particles in intracellular vesicles were counted in 40 cells; 700 particles of each kind were counted for each experimental treatment. Vesicles were grouped according to the number of 12-nm gold particles they contained, and the percentage of total PrP particles associated with each group was calculated. DNA fragments encoding chPrP residues 25-241, 25-116, and 117-241 were amplified by PCR from a full-length chPrP cDNA. The 5′ primers used for PCR included an EcoRI restriction site followed by nucleotides encoding a Factor Xa cleavage site (5′-GAATTCTAATCGAGGGAAGG-3′). The 3′ primers included a HindIII restriction site followed by a stop codon (5′-AAGCTTTCA-3′). The amplified DNA fragments were cut with EcoRI and HindIII and cloned first into the vector pGEX-KG (Guan and Dixon, 1991). The resulting plasmids were then cut with BamHI and HindIII to isolate a fragment that included the original PCR product plus a glycine linker region that is part of the pGEX-KG vector. This fragment was then cloned into the vector pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs), which fuses the protein of interest to the Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein. Fusion proteins were purified from ultrasonically disrupted bacteria to 95% homogeneity, using an amylose resin column according to the manufacturer's directions. Sodium deoxycholate (1% final concentration) was added to the purified fusion proteins to promote their solubilization, and the detergent was then removed by overnight dialysis at 4°C against 20 mM HEPES (pH 8). Fusion proteins were iodinated using lactoperoxidase to a specific activity of 1-10 Ci/mmol. Confluent N2a or CHO cells in 12- or 24-well plates were washed twice in cold PBS, once with PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with iodinated fusion proteins for 2 h at 4°C. Cells were then washed with PBS/bovine serum albumin, lysed in SDS buffer, and the amount of bound fusion protein determined by γcounting. Cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to confirm that the bound fusion protein was intact. Unlabeled fusion protein was used in the experiment shown in Fig. 10B, and the amount bound to cells was determined by immunoblotting cell lysates with anti-chPrP antibody, followed by quantitation of PrP bands on ECL films as described above.Figure 10:Binding of MBP-chPrP 25-241 to N2a cells is reduced by treatments that interfere with GAGs. Panel A, binding assays were performed with 20 nM iodinated fusion protein as described in Fig. 9. After incubation with the fusion protein, some cells were washed with PBS containing 2 M NaCl (bar labeled NaCl). Other cells were treated with heparitinase (5 mIU/ml) for 2 h at 37°C prior to incubation with fusion protein (bar labeled HSase). Data are expressed as a percentage of binding under control conditions. Nonspecific binding, measured in the presence of 4 μM unlabeled fusion protein, was first subtracted. Each bar shows the mean ± S.D. of values from 4 cultures. Panel B, binding assays were performed using 20 nM unlabeled fusion protein in the presence of PS, heparin (H), heparin sulfate (HS), or chondroitin sulfates (CS) (mixture of A, B, and C forms), all at 10 μg/ml. The amount of bound fusion protein was quantitated by immunoblotting cell lysates with anti-chPrP antibody. Data are expressed as a percentage of binding in the absence of drug.

Incubation of cells for 12 h with 100 μg/ml PS caused a dramatic reduction in the amount of cell surface staining for chPrP (Fig. 1). This reduction was confirmed biochemically by using immunoblotting to quantitate the amount of PrP released by incubation of intact cells with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC), an enzyme that releases glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored molecules from the cell surface (Fig. 2A). Treatment of cells with as little as 1 μg/ml PS for 12 h produced a detectable decrease in the amount of PIPLC-releasable chPrP, and a concentration of 100 μg/ml reduced the amount of chPrP by over 90%. The effect of PS was not restricted to chPrP, since the drug also reduced the amount of endogenous mouse PrP that could be labeled by surface iodination of N2a cells (Fig. 2B). Fig. 3 shows a dose-response curve for the effect of PS. The drug caused marked reduction of cell surface chPrP at concentrations of 10 μg/ml or greater. This effect was observable with as little as 1 h of treatment, although it was more pronounced after 24 or 48 h. When present in the culture medium for these longer periods, PS caused a small (15-20%) but reproducible decrease in the amount of surface PrP at concentrations as low as 1 ng/ml; a similar result was obtained after 4 days of treatment (not shown). The concentration range of PS tested does not have any obvious effect on the morphology or growth rate of the cells. We found that other polyanions also reduced the amount of chPrP on the surface of N2a cells (Fig. 4). Congo red and dextran sulfate of 500 kDa were about as effective as PS, dextran sulfate of 5 kDa was less potent, while chondroitin sulfate C was without effect. In additional experiments, heparin was about as potent as a 5-kDa dextran sulfate, and chondroitin sulfates A, B, and C were all ineffective at concentrations as high as 1 mg/ml (data not shown). Several mechanisms could account for the effect of PS on surface PrP in cultured N2a cells, including changes in synthesis or degradation of the protein, or alterations in its distribution between the inside and outside of the cell. Another potential mechanism, increased release of surface PrP into the extracellular medium, is unlikely to be involved, since we found that PS actually decreases the amount of PrP in the medium (data not shown). To assess an effect on synthetic rate, we measured the amount of chPrP that was metabolically labeled during a 30 min pulse with [ 35S]methionine in the presence or absence of 1 mg/ml PS. The 30 min labeling period was chosen because at this concentration of PS, an effect on cell surface PrP is seen as early as 15 min (data not shown). Fig. 5A shows that the amount of PrP synthesized in the presence or absence of PS is not significantly different. PS also has no significant effect on the kinetics of transport of PrP to the cell surface during a chase period (data not shown). To determine whether PS affected the degradation rate of PrP, we pulse-labeled PrP and chased for up to 8 h in the presence or absence of 1 mg/ml PS. The half-life of PrP in both control and PS treated cells was ∼6 h (Fig. 5B). To selectively monitor the degradation rate of PrP residing on the cell surface, we quantitated the decrement in the amount of surface-biotinylated PrP during incubation in the presence or absence of PS. Again, no significant difference was found between PS-treated and control cells (Fig. 5C). Since it affected neither the synthesis nor degradation of PrP, PS was likely to reduce the amount of PrP on the cell surface by redistributing the protein to the cell interior. We initially investigated this possibility using a metabolic pulse-chase protocol. N2a cells were labeled for 30 min, and then chased for 30 min to allow newly synthesized molecules to reach the cell surface. After an additional chase for 1 h in the presence or absence of PS, cells were treated with PIPLC to separate surface from internal PrP. We found that PS shifted the distribution of PrP from the cell surface to an intracellular location (Fig. 6). We have previously shown that PrPC constitutively cycles between the cell surface and an endocytic compartment in N2a cells (Shyng et al., 1993). To determine whether the observed shift in the localization of PrP resulted from an effect of PS on the rate of endocytosis, we directly measured internalization of surface-biotinylated PrP. We found that PS markedly enhanced the rate of PrP endocytosis after as little as 3 min (Fig. 7). PS does not affect the digestion efficiency of PIPLC, since >85% of surface-biotinylated chPrP was susceptible to digestion by the enzyme when cultures were maintained at 4°C in either the presence or absence of the drug (data not shown). A similar stimulation of PrP endocytosis was also observed using lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination rather than biotinylation to label cells, and using trypsin rather than PIPLC to score the number of molecules remaining on the cell surface (data not shown). To determine whether the effect of PS on endocytosis is selective for PrP, we examined the rate of internalization of two other plasma membrane proteins. We first measured uptake of iodinated transferrin bound to its receptor, and found that PS had no significant effect on the percentage of prebound ligand that was internalized in 30 min (69.5 ± 4.8% and 66.7 ± 4.3% for PS-treated and control cells, respectively). We have previously reported that an N-terminally truncated form of chPrP, Δ25-91, is poorly endocytosed compared to wild-type chPrP (Shyng et al., 1995). In contrast to its dramatic effect on internalization of the wild-type protein, PS does not alter the normally low endocytic rate of Δ25-91 chPrP (12.5 ± 2.8% internalized after 30 min in PS-treated cells, compared to 12.6 ± 4.3% in control cells). In addition, overnight treatment with 1 mg/ml PS does not alter the steady-state level of Δ25-91 chPrP on the cell surface, as assayed by iodination with lactoperoxidase (not shown). These results suggest that the effect of PS is unlikely to be caused by a nonselective increase in the overall endocytic activity of the cell. The lack of effect on the Δ25-91 mutant further suggests that the N-terminal half of the chPrP molecule is important in mediating the activity of PS. We performed electron microscopic immunogold labeling on ultrathin frozen sections to identify the intracellular compartments in which PrP accumulates after PS treatment. Cells were treated with anti-chPrP antibodies at 4°C, and then incubated at 37°C for 1 h in the presence or absence of PS to follow uptake of antibody-labeled molecules. After sectioning, samples were also labeled with antibodies to lgp120, a membrane protein that is a marker for late endosomes and lysosomes. Secondary antibodies coupled to gold particles of two different sizes were used to simultaneously visualize both antigens. In control cells, most of the chPrP molecules were found in vesicular structures that lacked lgp120, and are thus presumably early endosomes (Fig. 8A); this result is consistent with our previous immunofluorescence data (Shyng et al., 1993). In cells treated with PS, however, chPrP was also localized in some structures that were heavily labeled with anti-lgp120 antibodies (Fig. 8B). To quantitate the extent of co-localization of the two proteins, we categorized vesicles by the number of lgp120-associated gold particles they contained, and for each category counted the number of chPrP-associated gold particles (Fig. 8C). In control cells, 75% of the total PrP was found in compartments that were devoid of lgp120 staining, and only 7% in compartments that contained ≥5 lgp120-associated particles. In PS-treated cells, in contrast, only 65% of the chPrP was in lgp120-negative structures, and 20% was found in structures having ≥5 lgp-120 particles. The difference between the chPrP staining patterns in the presence and absence of PS was statistically significant (p < 0.005; χ2 test). These results indicate that PS causes a redistribution of some chPrP molecules to later compartments along the endocytic pathway, although the majority of the protein remains in early endosomal structures that do not contain lgp120. Caughey et al.(1994) have shown that PrPC binds in vitro to heparin and Congo red immobilized on beads, and they have postulated that the protein may also associate with GAG molecules synthesized by cells. To directly investigate the possible presence of PrP binding sites on cells, we used bacterially expressed fusion proteins that contain portions of the chPrP coding region fused to the E. coli maltose-binding protein (MBP). Binding to monolayers of N2a cells was assayed at 4°C using iodinated MBP-chPrP fusion proteins. A fusion protein encompassing the mature chPrP polypeptide chain (residues 25-241) binds saturably to N2a cells, and binding is greatly reduced in the presence of excess unlabeled fusion protein (Fig. 9A). Scatchard analysis gives a Kd of 230 nM and a capacity of 8.8 × 105 sites/cell (Fig. 9A, inset). A fusion protein encompassing the N-terminal half of the chPrP molecule (residues 25-116) binds to N2a cells with a similar affinity (240 nM), while a fusion protein encompassing the C-terminal half (residues 117-241) fails to bind (Fig. 9B). These results argue for the specificity of the binding reaction, and indicate that the N-terminal half of the polypeptide chain plays an essential role. There is a difference in the number of binding sites measured with the 25-241 and 25-116 fusion proteins (8.8 × 105/cell and 2.8 × 105/cell, respectively), suggesting that a subset of sites may require both the N- and C-terminal halves of the chPrP molecule for binding. We have also found that soluble chPrP released from brain membranes using PIPLC binds saturably and specifically to untransfected N2a cells, as determined using a chPrP-specific antibody (data not shown); this result indicates that native as well as bacterially produced protein binds to cultured cells. We performed several experiments (data not shown) to further characterize the binding parameters for the 25-241 fusion protein. We found that binding was unaffected by the presence of 2 mM EDTA, arguing that it was not dependent on calcium. Binding was also not altered by variations in pH from 4 to 8. Finally, mild trypsinization of cells (0.05% for 10 min at 4°C) reduced binding by almost 70%, arguing that a protein molecule is at least one component of the binding site. We next carried out a series of experiments to investigate whether any of the binding sites for the 25-241 fusion protein might contain GAG chains. First, we found that rinsing N2a cells in 2 M NaCl, a treatment known to disrupt protein binding to GAGs (Moscatelli, 1987), removed over 80% of the fusion protein that had previously bound (Fig. 10A). Pretreatment of N2a cells with heparitinase, which digests heparan sulfate chains, reduced the amount of binding by 90% (Fig. 10A). In addition, exogenous GAGs effectively competed with the fusion protein for binding to N2a cells, with a rank order of potency PS > heparin > heparan sulfate > chondroitin sulfate (Fig. 10B). Finally, we analyzed binding of the 25-241 fusion protein to mutant CHO cells that lack GAGs because they are deficient in xylose transferase, the first enzyme required for GAG synthesis (Esko, 1991); these cells incorporate only 10% of the 35SO4 label of wild-type cells (data not shown). The number of binding sites on the mutant CHO cells was 40% of the number on wild-type CHO cells, consistent with the idea that some, but not all of the sites are GAG molecules (Fig. 11). We noted that the Kd for binding to wild-type and mutant CHO cells was similar and was lower than the Kd for binding to N2a cells. To understand the therapeutic effects of sulfated glycans and Congo red on prion production, we have examined the influence of these agents on the metabolism and cellular trafficking of PrPC, the precursor of PrPSc. We report that PS, as well as Congo red and dextran sulfate, dramatically reduce the amount of PrPC present on the cell surface. This effect results primarily from the ability of PS, and presumably the other agents, to stimulate endocytosis of PrP, thereby causing a redistribution of the protein from the plasma membrane to the cell interior. The effect is extremely rapid, occurring within 3 min of drug application. PS also causes a change in the ultrastructural localization of PrP, such that a portion of the protein molecules are shifted from early endosomes into late endosomes and/or lysosomes. Under the conditions tested, PS has no effect on the synthesis or degradation of PrP and does not change the net amount of the protein in the cell. Our results do not exclude the possibility that sulfated glycans produce other effects on cells when applied for longer periods than those used here. In this regard, Gabizon et al.(1993) reported that growth of N2a cells for 6 days in the presence of heparan sulfate increased the total cellular content of PrP. The mechanism by which sulfated glycans induce such rapid and extensive alterations in the cellular distribution of PrP remains to be determined. These compounds appear to be relatively selective for PrP, since they affect both the chicken and mouse proteins but do not alter internalization of the transferrin receptor, or of a truncated form of chPrP. It therefore seems unlikely that the agents produce a general stimulation of endocytosis or of bulk membrane flow. However, an effect on other membrane trafficking events cannot be ruled out, since polyanions have been reported to influence processes such as phagosome-lysosomal fusion in macrophages (Hart and Young, 1975). We have demonstrated previously that PrPC constitutively cycles between the cell surface and an endocytic compartment, and that internalization of PrPC is mediated by clathrin-coated pits and vesicles (Shyng et al., 1993, 1994). The results reported here indicate that PS stimulates the endocytic arm of this cycle, although we do not yet know whether it is the clathrin pathway that is involved. The return arm of the cycle may also be affected, since PS inhibits iodinated PrP molecules from reappearing on the cell surface after they have been internalized (data not shown). Sulfated glycans might act by binding directly to PrP on the cell surface, or by interacting with other cellular components that influence PrP trafficking. Consistent with a direct action, the N-terminal domains of chicken and mammalian PrP are rich in basic amino acids, and each contains a consensus site for heparin binding (XBBXBX, where B = basic amino acid, and X = other amino acids; Cardin and Weintraub, 1989); presumably, the same sites could mediate binding to other sulfated glycans. Moreover, we have found that a truncated form of chPrP (Δ25-91) that lacks this region is resistant to the endocytosis-promoting effect of PS. Binding of sulfated glycans to PrP is also consistent with our observation that chPrP fusion proteins bind to GAG-containing sites on the surface of cultured cells, and with the finding of Caughey et al.(1994) that PrPC binds to heparin and Congo red immobilized on beads. How binding of sulfated glycans to cell surface PrPC might enhance its endocytosis is a matter of speculation. One possibility is that these compounds induce oligomerization of PrPC. It is well known that cross-linking of cell surface proteins by antibodies and other ligands rapidly stimulates their endocytosis (Marsh et al., 1995), and there are precedents for sulfated glycans causing oligomerization and aggregation of bound proteins (Jackson et al., 1991; Spivak-Kroizman et al., 1994). It is possible that stimulation of PrPC internalization by sulfated anions is related to the inhibitory effect of these agents on prion synthesis in cultured cells. Recent studies suggest that PrPC is converted into PrPSc either on the cell surface, or along an endocytic pathway (Caughey et al., 1991b; Caughey and Raymond, 1991; Borchelt et al., 1992; Taraboulos et al., 1992). Sulfated glycans might therefore inhibit PrPSc production by promoting removal of PrPC substrate from the plasma membrane, or by diverting PrPC to an endocytic compartment that is unfavorable for the conversion process. Perhaps the lgp120-positive vesicles in which some of the PrPC resides after PS treatment is such a compartment. We also note that the relative potencies of several different sulfated anions in reducing cell surface PrP are the same as their relative potencies in inhibiting PrPSc production (Fig. 4; Caughey and Raymond, 1993). On the other hand, the dose of PS required for half-maximal removal of PrPC from the cell surface (3-5 μg/ml; Fig. 3) is much higher than the dose required for half-maximal inhibition of PrPSc synthesis (∼1 ng/ml; Caughey and Raymond, 1993). This might imply that the two effects are unrelated. Indeed, Caughey et al.(1993) concluded that alterations in PrPC metabolism did not underlie the scrapie-inhibitory effects of PS, based on their observation that treatment of N2a cells with 100 ng/ml PS did not affect the metabolic labeling, half-life, or PIPLC releasability of PrPC during an 8.5 h chase. We have found, however, that even at 1 ng/ml, PS produced a 15-20% decrease of cell surface PrPC after 24 or 48 h (Fig. 3), and it is possible that this effect is sufficient for inhibition of PrPSc production. It is also conceivable that PrPSc, rather than PrPC, is the relevant target of PS action, and perhaps this isoform has a higher affinity for the drug. It will clearly be necessary to analyze the effects of sulfated glycans on the trafficking of PrPSc, as well as on other cellular processes relevant to prion synthesis, in order to fully understand the therapeutic action of these agents. The effect of exogenous glycans on membrane-bound PrP led us to search for structurally related GAG molecules on the cell surface that might bind to PrP. Using a radioiodinated fusion protein encompassing the mature chPrP sequence, we detected saturable and specific binding to monolayers of both N2a and CHO cells. Many of these binding sites are likely to be GAG molecules, as indicated by the measured dissociation constants, which are within the range seen for many GAG-protein interactions (Jackson et al., 1991), as well as by the inhibitory effects of 2 M NaCl, heparitinase, and exogenous GAGs, and by reduced binding to GAG-deficient CHO cells. In addition, a C-terminal PrP fragment that lacks consensus sites for heparin binding does not bind to cells. It is probable that the PrP binding sites on cultured cells comprise protein as well as GAG molecules, since treatment of cells with trypsin abolishes binding; a reasonable hypothesis is that the binding sites are proteoglycans. Caughey et al.(1994) have shown that a soluble form of PrPC binds to Congo red and heparin when these compounds are immobilized on beads, but the work reported here is the first demonstration that GAG-containing binding sites for PrP exist on cells. It is possible that membrane-associated molecules of PrPC bind to cellular GAGs in a manner similar to that of the soluble PrP fusion proteins we have tested. If this were the case, then GAGs may play an important role in the function and metabolism of PrPC. One potential function may involve endocytic trafficking of PrPC. We have previously hypothesized the existence of a transmembrane receptor that binds glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored molecules of PrPC and mediates their internalization via clathrin-coated pits (Shyng et al., 1994, 1995; Harris et al., 1996). It is conceivable that binding to this putative receptor is facilitated by GAG chains, either those located on the receptor molecule itself or those added exogenously. Precedents for this model include the role of proteoglycans in endocytic uptake of several soluble ligands, and the role of heparin as an essential cofactor for binding of fibroblast growth factor to its high affinity receptor (Saxena et al., 1990; Klagsbrun and Baird, 1991; Reiland and Rapraeger, 1993; Rusnati et al., 1993; Kounnas et al., 1995). Other possible roles for the GAG binding sites we have identified include protecting surface PrPC from extracellular proteases and trapping of soluble PrPC that has been released by cleavage of the glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor. GAG binding sites could potentially interact with PrPSc as well as PrPC (Caughey and Raymond, 1993; Caughey et al., 1994; Priola and Caughey, 1994). To test this hypothesis, it will be interesting to directly assay binding of PrPSc to cell-associated GAGs and to assess the effect on prion synthesis of treatments that reduce GAG content, such as incubation with heparitinase or chlorate (Gabizon et al., 1993). Although most of the binding sites for the PrP fusion proteins that we have detected appear to be GAGs, there is a suggestion that other chemically distinct sites may also exist. Even after extensive salt wash or heparitinase treatment, about 10-20% of the control binding always remains. In addition, xylose transferase-deficient CHO cells, which incorporate only 10% of the normal level of 35SO4, display about half the number of binding sites as wild-type cells. These results suggest that PrP may also bind to non-GAG sites on cultured cells. The nature of these sites remains to be investigated. We thank Marilyn Levy and Lori LaRose for technical assistance with immunogold labeling of cryostat sections, and Jeffrey Esko for the gift of GAG-deficient CHO cells."

In this study, we demonstrate that transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1, 1 ng/ml) induces the release of H2O2 from human lung fibroblasts within 8 h following exposure to this cytokine. Elevation in H2O2 release peaked at 16 h (∼22 pmol/min/106 cells) and gradually declined to undetectable levels at 48 h after TGF-β1 treatment. NADH consumption by these cells was stimulated by TGF-β1 while that of NADPH remained unchanged. NADH oxidase activity as measured by diphenyliodonium (DPI)-inhibitable NADH consumption in TGF-β1-treated cells followed a time course similar to that of H2O2 release. DPI, an inhibitor of the NADPH oxidase complex of neutrophils and other flavoproteins, also inhibited the TGF-β1-induced H2O2 production. Inhibitors of other enzymatic systems involving flavoproteins that may be responsible for the production of H2O2 in these cells, including xanthine oxidase, nitric oxide synthase, and both mitochondrial and microsomal electron transport systems, failed to inhibit TGF-β1-induced NADH oxidation and H2O2 production.

CD38 is a lymphocyte differentiation antigen which has recently been shown to be a bifunctional enzyme that can synthesize cADPR from NAD++ as well as hydrolyze cADPR to ADP-ribose. In this study, we show that both the cyclase and CD38 can also catalyze the exchange of the nicotinamide group of NADP++ with nicotinic acid (NA). The product is nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP++), a metabolite we have previously shown to be potent in Ca2+2+ mobilization (Lee, H. C., and Aarhus, R.(1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 2152-2157). The switch of the catalysis to the exchange reaction requires acidic pH and NA. The half-maximal effective concentration of NA is about 5 mM for both the cyclase and CD38. In the absence of NA or at neutral pH, the cyclase converts NADP++ to another metabolite, which is identified as cyclic ADP-ribose 2′-phosphate. Under the same conditions, CD38 converts NADP++ to ADP-ribose 2′-phosphate instead, which is the hydrolysis product of cyclic ADP-ribose 2′-phosphate. That two different products of ADP-ribosyl cyclase and CD38, cADPR and NAADP+, are both involved in Ca2+ mobilization suggests a crucial role of these enzymes in Ca2+ signaling.

(reviewed in (1.Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6165) Google Scholar)). Most cells, however, appear to contain Ca2+ stores insensitive to IP3, suggesting the existence of other Ca2+ signaling molecules. One possible candidate is cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR)(2.Lee H.C.

Biol. 1994; 1: 143-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It is a cyclic nucleotide derived from NAD+ by linking the N-1 position of the adenine ring to the anomeric carbon of the terminal ribose and displacing the nicotinamide moiety(3.Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Levitt D. Nature Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 143-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). cADPR is highly effective in mobilizing Ca2+ from internal stores of cells. This was first demonstrated in an invertebrate cell, the sea urchin egg, where cADPR was shown to be as effective as IP3(4.Clapper D.L. Walseth T.F. Dargie P.J. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9561-9568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, amphibian neurons(5.Hua S.Y. Tokimasa T. Takasawa S. Furuya Y. Nohmi M. Okamoto H. Kuba K. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1073-1079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), a variety of mammalian cells (reviewed in (6.Lee H.C. Galione A. Walseth T.F. Vitam.

Science. 1995; 268: 735-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence indicates the action of cADPR is to increase the Ca2+ sensitivity of the Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release mechanism(8.Galione A. Lee H.C. Busa W.B.

The synthesis of cADPR is catalyzed by ADP-ribosyl cyclase, which was first described in sea urchin egg extracts (4.Clapper D.L. Walseth T.F. Dargie P.J. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9561-9568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and later shown to be ubiquitous among animal tissues(11.Rusinko N. Lee H.C. J. Biol.

Metabolism of cADPR is also catalyzed by a novel bifunctional enzyme purified from spleen, which can both synthesize cADPR from NAD+ and hydrolyze cADPR to ADP-ribose(13.Kim H. Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. Science. 1993; 261: 1330-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). CD38 is a lymphocyte differentiation antigen which not only shares considerable sequence homology with ADP-ribosyl cyclase (14.States D.J. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) but also was found to be a bifunctional enzyme with catalytic properties similar to the spleen enzyme(15.Howard M. Grimaldi J.C. Bazan J.F. Lund F.E. Santos-Argumedo L. Parkhouse R.M.E. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Science. 1993; 262: 1056-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 16.Takasawa S. Tohgo A.

Recent mutagenesis studies show that CD38 can be converted to a monofunctional enzyme exhibiting only the ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity by altering two specific cysteine residues in its amino acid sequence(17.Tohgo A. Takasawa S. Noguchi N. Koguma T. Nata K. Sugimoto H. Okomoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28555-28557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two enzymes are therefore closely related enzymatically and structurally. In addition to cADPR, alkaline treatment of NADP+ generates a derivative which can also mobilize internal Ca2+ from live sea urchin eggs as well as egg homogenates(4.Clapper D.L. Walseth T.F. Dargie P.J. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9561-9568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Subsequent structural determination showed that the active derivative is nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP+)(18.Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Cross-desensitization and inhibitor studies indicate that the Ca2+ release mechanism activated by NAADP+ is totally independent from that activated by cADPR and IP3(4.Clapper D.L. Walseth T.F. Dargie P.J. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9561-9568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the NAADP+-sensitive Ca2+ stores can be separated from those sensitive to cADPR and IP3 by Percoll density centrifugation, indicating they are distinctive organelles(4.Clapper D.L. Walseth T.F. Dargie P.J. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9561-9568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). In addition to alkaline treatment, NAADP+ can also be enzymatically synthesized by exchanging the base, nicotinamide, of NADP+ with nicotinic acid, a reaction catalyzed by spleen extracts(19.Bernofsky C. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 66: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20.Chini E.N. Beers K.W. Dousa T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3216-3223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that ADP-ribosyl cyclase and CD38 both catalyze the synthesis of NAADP+ by the base-exchange reaction. The two catalytic pathways of ADP-ribosyl cyclase and CD38 are differentially regulated by pH and nicotinic acid. That two different products of ADP-ribosyl cyclase and CD38, cADPR, and NAADP+, are involved in Ca2+ mobilization suggests a crucial role of these enzymes in Ca2+ signaling. ADP-ribosyl cyclase was purified from Aplysia ovotestes according to procedures published previously(12.Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Frozen ovotestes (100 g) were purchased from Marinus (Long Beach, CA), thawed, and rinsed with the homogenization buffer containing 250 mM sucrose, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.2 ml/liter β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.3. The minced tissues were added to 300 ml of the homogenization buffer containing protease inhibitors (17 μg of soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.3 μg/ml aprotinin). The tissues were homogenized with 5-10-s pulses of an electrical tissue mincer, followed by 2-5 strokes with a Teflon pestle connected to an electric drill. The homogenate was diluted to about 400 ml with the homogenization buffer containing protease inhibitors and centrifuged for 30 min at 50,000 rpm in a Ti50.2 rotor (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA). About 330 ml of supernatant were recovered after centrifugation and stored at −80°C until used. The soluble extract (100 ml) was thawed and loaded at 1 ml/min onto a 2.5 × 20-cm Econo column (Bio-Rad) packed with the resin CM Hiflow (Sterogene, Arcadia, CA). The column was equilibrated with buffer A containing 1 mM EDTA, 0.2 ml/liter of β-mercaptoethanol, and 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.3. After loading, the column was washed with 250 ml of buffer A at 2 ml/min. The bound ADP-ribosyl cyclase was eluted with 200 ml of 0.5 M NaCl in buffer A. The enzyme activity was measured by either of the two following assays: a bioassay based on the Ca2+ release activity of cADPR as described below or by a recently developed fluorimetric assay based on measuring the synthesis of fluorescent cyclic GDP-ribose from nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide(21.Graeff R. Walseth T.F. Fryxell K. Branton D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30260-30267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide assay; 1 μl of each fraction was added to 0.2 ml of 0.1 mM nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.0, and the increase in cyclic GDP-ribose fluorescence was measured at 410 nm with excitation at 300 nm. All enzyme assays were done at room temperature. The final purification was conducted with a 300SW gel-filtration column (Waters, Milford, MA). The cyclase was eluted with 50 mM NaCl in buffer A listed above and the flow rate was 0.75 ml/min. A full-length cDNA clone of human CD38 (22.Jackson D.G. Bell J.I. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2811-2815PubMed Google Scholar) was generously provided by Dr. D. G. Jackson (John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK). The details of the expression of the extracellular domain of human CD38 in yeast is as described previously(23.Fryxell K.B. O'Donoghue K. Graeff R.M. Lee H.C. Branton W.D. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, the putative intracellular and transmembrane portions of human CD38 were deleted and the four potential N-linked glycosylation sites removed by conservative amino acid substitutions. The remaining DNA sequence was spliced into Pichia expression vector pHIL-S1 (Invitrogen Corporation, San Diego, CA) and expressed as a soluble, secreted protein in Pichia pastoris according to protocols provided by Invitrogen. The soluble CD38 in the concentrated and dialyzed media from the yeast expression experiments was further purified to homogeneity on a cationic ion exchange column (SP 5PW, Waters). The purified preparation appears as a single band on silver-stained gels in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In all respects it behaves the same as the preparation we have used and published previously(15.Howard M. Grimaldi J.C. Bazan J.F. Lund F.E. Santos-Argumedo L. Parkhouse R.M.E. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Science. 1993; 262: 1056-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Purified ADP-ribosyl cyclase (17-83 ng/ml) or CD38 (0.3-1.8 μg/ml) was incubated for 30 min at room temperature (20-23°C) with 1 mM substrate, NADP+ or NAD+, 0-100 mM nicotinic acid, pH 5.0, with Tris base. Bovine serum albumin (0.1 mg/ml) was included in the mixture to prevent inactivation of the cyclase due to nonspecific adsorption to tubes. Preliminary results indicate the reaction is linear for the first 30 min as long as at least 60% of the substrate is present. The reaction was terminated by 100-fold dilution with an ice-cold buffer containing 15 mM Tris, pH 10.5-11. The products were analyzed by HPLC and quantified by comparison with standards. The nucleotides of interest were separated on a 15 × 0.3-cm column packed with AG MP-1 (Bio-Rad) similar to that described previously(2.Lee H.C. Walseth T.F. Bratt G.T. Hayes R.N. Clapper D.L. J.

The flow rate was maintained at 1 ml/min, and the nucleotides were eluted with a gradient of trifluoroacetic acid starting at 0% solvent B (solvent B is 150 mM trifluoroacetic acid in water, solvent A is water) increased to 1% solvent B in 1 min, increased linearly to 2% from 1 to 2 min, increased linearly to 4% from 2 to 5 min, increased linearly to 8% from 5 to 9 min, increased linearly to 16% from 9 to 13 min, increased linearly to 32% from 13 to 17 min, increased linearly to 100% from 17 to 18 min, and held at 100% until 22 min. A different trifluoroacetic acid gradient was used to analyze metabolites of NAD+. The gradient started at 0% solvent B, increased linearly to 1% solvent B in 1 min, increased linearly to 2% from 1 to 6 min, increased linearly to 4% from 6 to 11 min, increased linearly to 8% from 11 to 16 min, increased linearly to 16% from 16 to 21 min, increased linearly to 32% from 21 to 26 min, stepped to 100% at 26.1 min, and maintained at 100% from 26.1 to 31 min. The column was calibrated with nicotinamide, NAD+, NADP+, cADPR, ADP-ribose (ADPR), ADP-ribose 2′-phosphate (ADPRP or ATP-ribose, Sigma) as standards. NAD+ and NADP+ were purchased from Sigma and further purified by using the same HPLC conditions described above. The HPLC analyses were done using a Gilson HPLC equipped with an autoinjector. The following millimolar extinction coefficients at 254 nm were used for standard calibration: 17.4 for NADP+ and NAD+ and 14.0 for cADPR and cADPRP. Homogenates of sea urchin egg (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) were prepared as described previously(9.Lee H.C. J. Biol.

Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows a HPLC chromatograph of the reaction products. NAD+, the remaining substrate, eluted at about 7.1 min. The product, cADPR, eluted at about 13.3 min. The nicotinamide group (Nic) of NAD+ was released during the cyclization and eluted as a broad peak at about 1.5 min. The Ca2+ releasing activity of the cADPR peak was verified using sea urchin egg homogenates (data not shown). The catalysis of ADP-ribosyl cyclase can be changed to base exchange by the addition of nicotinic acid as shown in Fig. 1B. Incubation of the cyclase with 1 mM NAD+ and 30 mM nicotinic acid resulted in the production of an additional product eluting at 16.33 ± 0.04 min (n = 6, ±S.D.). This product had no Ca2+ releasing activity and was identified as NAAD+ by its virtually identical retention time as that of authentic NAAD+ (16.23 ± 0.08 min, n = 6). These results show that, under the appropriate conditions, the enzyme can catalyze the exchange of the nicotinamide group of NAD+ with nicotinic acid leading to the formation of NAAD+. That ADP-ribosyl cyclase can catalyze the base exchange reaction suggests that it may also be able to produce NAADP+ from NADP+ in a manner similar to the spleen extracts reported previously(19.Bernofsky C. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 66: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A chromatograph of the reaction products after incubation of the cyclase with NADP+ and nicotinic acid is shown in the inset of Fig. 2. In addition to peaks corresponding to nicotinamide (Nic), nicotinic acid (NA) and NADP+, there are two additional peaks labeled 1 and 2. All peaks were collected and assayed for Ca2+ release activity. Only peak 1 was found to be active (Fig. 2) and the Ca2+ release was rapid, characteristic of that induced by NAADP+(4.Clapper D.L. Walseth T.F. Dargie P.J. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9561-9568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that prior exposure of sea urchin egg microsomes to NAADP+ can make them unresponsive to further challenge of NAADP+(4.Clapper D.L. Walseth T.F. Dargie P.J. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9561-9568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). To show that peak 1 was indeed NAADP+, the microsomes were tested subsequently for desensitization and, as shown in Fig. 2, were found to be refractory to authentic NAADP+ but remained responsive to cADPR. It is reasonable to expect that the unknown product (peak 2) shown in Fig. 2 may be the cyclic form of NADP+, or cADPRP, since the cyclase is known to cyclize NAD+ to produce cADPR (see also Fig. 1A). Indeed, the UV spectrum of peak 2 is indistinguishable from that of cADPR (data not shown). Various treatments were performed on the unknown product (peak 2/cADPRP) to convert it to known substances and the results are summarized in Table 1. We have previously shown that cADPR can be quantitatively hydrolyzed to ADP-ribose by boiling(21.Graeff R. Walseth T.F. Fryxell K. Branton D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30260-30267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar treatment of the unknown converted it to a product with a retention time 0.53 min later than the original unknown. The product was ADP-ribose 2′-phosphate (ADPRP) since it had a retention time of 20.35 ± 0.01 min, which is virtually identical to that of authentic ADPRP (20.31 ± 0.01 min). Also, when the product of the boiled unknown and ADPRP standard were subsequently treated with nucleotide pyrophosphatase, both were converted to products (2′,5′-ADP) having similar retention times of about 14.1 min.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab If the unknown were indeed the phosphorylated form of cADPR, one would expect the removal of the 2′-phosphate should covert it to cADPR. Treatment of cADPRP with alkaline phosphatase (Table 1) converted it to a product with a retention time of 8.44 ± 0.03 min, virtually identical to that of authentic cADPR (8.36 ± 0.03 min). The Ca2+ release assay was used to further demonstrate that the product was cADPR as shown in Fig. 3. A 10 μM aliquot of cADPRP was treated with alkaline phosphatase (APase). Immediately after starting the reaction (0′) no Ca2+ release activity was detected, consistent with the results in Fig. 2 showing that cADPRP has no Ca2+ release activity. The Ca2+ release activity developed maximally after 10 min of incubation (10′). The Ca2+ release activity of the mixture after 27 min (27′) of incubation was completely blocked by a specific antagonist of cADPR, 8-amino-cADPR(24.Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), indicating the Ca2+ release was mediated by cADPR. To quantify the conversion of the unknown compound to cADPR by the alkaline phosphatase, the Ca2+ release activity was converted to production of cADPR by comparison with a calibration curve constructed with authentic cADPR. As shown in the inset of Fig. 3, by 10 min of incubation, all of the starting cADPRP (10 μM) was converted to cADPR by the alkaline phosphatase. These results indicate that cADPRP is identical to cADPR except for the additional 2′-phosphate. The proposed structure of cADPRP is shown in Fig. 4.Fig. 4The proposed structures of cADPRP and ADPRP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Similar to the cyclase, CD38 can also catalyze the base-exchange reaction. The inset of Fig. 5 shows a chromatograph of the reaction products after incubation of CD38 with NADP+ and nicotinic acid. Peak 1 in the chromatograph was identified as NAADP+ by its Ca2+ release activity. Peak 2 was not cADPRP since they could be separated by HPLC (see Fig. 6A and inset of Fig. 8). Its elution time of 20.35 ± 0.01 min (n = 10, S.D.) was virtually identical to authentic ADPRP (Table 1). Treatment of the substance in peak 2 (Fig. 5) with nucleotide pyrophosphatase converted it to 2′,5′-ADP, which is similar to that observed with authentic ADPRP (Table 1). The product is thus identified as ADPRP and its structure is also shown in Fig. 4.Fig. 6Synthesis of cADPRP by ADP-ribosyl cyclase and ADPRP by CD38. A, NADP+ (1 mM) was incubated for 4 h with either the cyclase (20 ng/ml) at room temperature or with CD38 (200 ng/ml) at 37°C at pH 7.0 in a medium containing 30 mM nicotinic acid, 20 mM Tris, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Aliquots of 50 μl of the reaction mixture were analyzed by HPLC. The products from the cyclase reaction are shown in the upper chromatograph and those from the CD38 reaction are shown in the lower chromatograph. For the sake of clarity, only regions of interest of the chromatographs are shown. To avoid superposition, the chromatograph of the cyclase reaction is displaced along the vertical axis. B, The peaks (in A) corresponding to cADPRP and ADPRP were collected, lyophilized, and reconstituted with 1 ml of 20 mM Tris, pH 10.5. The samples were then treated with 1 unit of alkaline phosphatase for 30 min at 37°C. The resulting products were analyzed by HPLC. The two insets show Ca2+ release activity of the samples before and after the phosphatase treatment. Equal amounts of the samples before and after the treatment were added to sea urchin homogenates and the resulting Ca2+ release measured by the increase in Fluo 3 fluorescence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 8Dependence of the synthesis of NAADP+ and cADPRP on pH. NADP+ (1 mM) was incubated with A, ADP-ribosyl cyclase (25 ng/ml) or B, CD38 (0.3 μg/ml) at the various pH values indicated and in the presence of 30 mM nicotinic acid for 30 min at room temperature. The amounts of NAADP+, cADPRP, and ADPRP produced were measured by HPLC. Results shown are mean ± S.D., n = 3. The upper HPLC chromatograph in the inset is that of 6.9 nmol of cADPRP and the lower one is that of a mixture of 3.8 nmol each of cADPRP and ADPRP. To improve the separation of the two compounds, a shallow trifluoroacetic acid gradient was used. For the sake of clarity, only regions of interest of the chromatographs are shown. To avoid superposition, the chromatograph of the cADPRP is displaced along the vertical axis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 6 provides more evidence that ADPRP is different from cADPRP. Mixtures of NADP+ and nicotinic acid were incubated with either the cyclase (the upper chromatograph in Fig. 6A) or CD38 (the lower chromatograph in Fig. 6A) and analyzed by HPLC. Comparison of the two chromatographs in Fig. 6A indicates cADPRP elutes about 0.5 min earlier than ADPRP. The peak corresponding to cADPRP was collected and treated with alkaline phosphatase to convert it to cADPR (cf. Fig. 3). The upper inset of Fig. 6B shows that Ca2+ release activity was produced after the phosphatase treatment. The product was further analyzed by HPLC and 91% of the product was found to be cADPR, while 6.5% was ADP-ribose (upper chromatograph in Fig. 6B). Therefore, very little ADPRP is produced by the cyclase after incubation with NADP+ and nicotinic acid. The majority of the product is cADPRP. The peak corresponding to ADPRP produced by CD38 (lower chromatograph of Fig. 6A) was similarly analyzed. No Ca2+ release activity was generated after the alkaline phosphatase treatment (lower inset in Fig. 6B). 92% of the product was ADPR as shown in the lower chromatograph of Fig. 6B and only 0.7% was cADPR. It is thus clear that the enzymatic properties of the cyclase and CD38 are quite different. The cyclase cyclizes NADP+ to produce cADPRP, while CD38 hydolyzes it to ADPRP. However, both enzymes can also catalyze the base-exchange reaction, resulting in the formation of NAADP+. The shift of the catalysis of the ADP-ribosyl cyclase from cyclization of NAD+ to base exchange depends critically on the pH of the reaction as shown in Fig. 7. The cyclase was incubated with 1 mM NAD+ at pH 4 or 7, with or without 30 mM nicotinic acid. The production of cADPR and NAAD+ under each condition was determined by HPLC and the product identities are similar to that described in Fig. 1. In the absence of nicotinic acid, only the synthesis of cADPR was observed at both pH. In the presence of nicotinic acid and at acidic pH, the reaction catalyzed by the cyclase shifted from cyclization to base exchange and the product produced was mainly NAAD+. At neutral pH, even in the presence of nicotinic acid, only the production of cADPR was observed. Similar to the results obtained with NAD+ as a substrate, the cyclization of NADP+ and the base-exchange reaction catalyzed by the cyclase are also pH-dependent. This is expected since both reactions are catalyzed by the same enzyme. As shown in the inset of Fig. 2, when the reaction of the cyclase was performed at pH 5.5, the amount of NAADP+ produced was about equal to cADPRP. When the reaction was performed at pH 7.0 (upper chromatograph in Fig. 6A) the majority of the product was cADPRP. A more detailed pH dependence is shown in Fig. 8A. The amount of cADPRP produced was determined by HPLC. The validity of the HPLC assay is depicted in the inset in Fig. 8B which shows that cADPRP can easily be distinquished from ADPRP by HPLC. At acidic pH, the cyclase catalyzes mainly the base-exchange reaction resulting in production of NAADP+, while the cyclization reaction dominates at pH values above neutrality and produces cADPRP. NAADP+ production is maximal at pH 4 to 5, whereas cADPRP production displays a broad pH optimum from pH 6 to 9. Fig. 8B shows a similar dependence of the catalysis of CD38 on pH. The product was mainly NAADP+ in acidic pH but changed to exclusively ADPRP at or above neutrality. The pH optimum of NAADP+ production by CD38 was about 4 and ADPRP generation showed a broad optimum from pH 6 to 8. In addition to pH, nicotinic acid is also required for the switching between the two catalytic pathways of the cyclase. NADP+ (1 mM) was incubated with the cyclase at pH 5.0 in the presence of various concentrations of nicotinic acid for 30 min and the remaining NADP+ and the products formed were quantified by HPLC. The results are shown in Fig. 9A. In the absence of nicotinic acid, only the cyclization reaction can occur even at an acidic pH of 5.0, which, as shown in Fig. 8A, should switch the catalysis of the cyclase to the base-exchange reaction. With increasing concentrations of nicotinic acid, the amounts of cADPRP produced decreased. Inversely, the amounts of NAADP+ synthesized showed a corresponding increase. The amounts of the remaining substrate, NADP+, were constant. It thus appears that as the concentrations of nicotinic acid increase, the substrate utilization is unchanged, but the cyclase simply switches quantitatively from cyclization to base-exchange. The half-maximal effective concentration of nicotinic acid was about 5 mM. Similar results were obtained using CD38. The amounts of substrate and products present after 30 min incubation of CD38 with 1 mM NADP+ at pH 5 and various concentrations of nicotinic acid are shown in Fig. 9B. Unlike the amounts of cADPRP produced by the cyclase (Fig. 9A), the amounts of ADPRP produced were relatively independent of the concentration of nicotinic acid. In contrast, the amounts of NAADP+ synthesized by the base-exchange reaction were critically dependent on nicotinic acid concentration and its half-maximal effect was observed at about 5 mM. The extent of the decrease of the amounts of the remaining NADP+ appeared to be directly correlated with the increase in the synthesis of NAADP+. The production of ADPRP and NAADP+ by CD38 does not seem to be directly related, at least as far as their dependence on nicotinic acid is concerned. This behavior of CD38 is distinct from the cyclase and appears to be consistent with the bifunctional nature of CD38. In any case, these results show that the mode of catalysis of the cyclase and CD38 can be effectively regulated by pH and nicotinic acid. The presence of ADP-ribosyl cyclase in sea urchin egg homogenates and its ability to convert NAD+ to a Ca2+ mobilizing metabolite led to the discovery of cADPR(2.Lee H.C. Walseth T.F. Bratt G.T. Hayes R.N. Clapper D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1608-1615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Clapper D.L. Walseth T.F. Dargie P.J. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9561-9568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since NAD+ is known to be sensitive to base, alkaline treatments were used to produce derivatives of NAD+. Although the yield was low, alkaline treatments could, indeed, produce cADPR(4.Clapper D.L. Walseth T.F. Dargie P.J. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9561-9568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar treatment of NADP+ also produced a Ca+ mobilizing derivative(4.Clapper D.L. Walseth T.F. Dargie P.J. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9561-9568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the Ca2+ release mechanism activated by this derivative was shown to be independent of the cADPR-sensitive release2+(4.Clapper D.L. Walseth T.F. Dargie P.J. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9561-9568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The derivative was later identified as NAADP+(18.Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Although similar chemical treatments can produce cADPR and NAADP+, their structural differences and the independence of their Ca2+ mobilizing action suggest that different enzymatic pathways may be involved in their synthesis. This is shown not to be the case in this study. At acidic pH and in the presence of nicotinic acid, ADP-ribosyl cyclase can efficiently catalyze the exchange of the nicotinamide group of NADP+ with nicotinic acid and produce NAADP+. Furthermore, the cyclase can also cyclize NADP+ in the absence of nicotinic acid and at neutral pH. The product was identified as the phosphorylated form of cADPR, or cADPRP. Not only is this multifunctionality of ADP-ribosyl cyclase novel, but also that the two products of the cyclase, cADPR and NAADP+, produced under different conditions are intimately related to Ca2+ mobilization suggests that this enzyme may play a pivotal role in Ca2+ signaling. There are three different types of ADP-ribosyl cyclase known so far. In addition to the Aplysia enzyme, the CD38-like bifunctional enzymes and a cGMP-sensitive enzyme in sea urchin eggs are all members of the family (reviewed in (25.Lee H.C. Graeff R. Walseth T.F. Biochimie (Paris). 1995; 77: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar)). Here we show that CD38 can also catalyze the base-exchange reaction with dependence on pH and nicotinic acid similar to that observed with the cyclase, further strengthening the notion that the two enzymes are not only structurally but also enzymatically related. As for the possible role of nicotinic acid and pH as physiological regulators of the cyclase, the half-maximal concentration of nicotinic acid of about 5 mM and the acidic pH required for switching of the cyclase to the base-exchange reaction appear to be somewhat out of the physiological range. However, it should be pointed out that the half-maximal effective concentration of NAADP+ in mobilizing Ca2+ is about 30 nM(18.Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Therefore, the cyclase does not have to operate anywhere near its maximal rate to synthesize physiologically relevant amounts of NAADP+. Also, the Aplysia cyclase is believed to be present inside vesicular organelles in the oocytes(26.Hellmich M.R. Strumwasser F. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and its characteristics may reflect its in vivo location. This is particularly relevant for CD38. It has previously been proposed that internalization of CD38, a surface antigen, may be part of the signal transduction mechanism (reviewed in (25.Lee H.C. Graeff R. Walseth T.F. Biochimie (Paris). 1995; 77: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar)). This would bring CD38 into the acidic environment of the endosomes, an environment condusive for the base-exchange reaction. Whether this would result in synthesis of NAADP+ remains to be determined. The coincidence between the transit of CD38 through an acidic environment and the requirement of acidic pH for the base-exchange reaction is certainly very suggestive. The ability of the cyclase to catalyze the base exchange reaction strongly suggests the formation of an enzyme intermediate is part of the enzymatic mechanism. The first step of the catalysis is likely to be the release of the nicotinamide group and the formation of an intermediate involving ADP-ribose, or ADP-ribose phosphate if NADP+ is used as a substrate. The anomeric carbon of the ADP-ribosyl intermediate (or ADPRP) may well be in an activated state poised to react with various substances. If nicotinic acid is present, the reaction with the activated intermediate will lead to the formation of NAAD+ (or NAADP+). In the absence of nicotinic acid, the anomeric carbon can react intramolecularly with N1 of the adenine group resulting in the formation of cADPR (or cADPRP). Nicotinamide, if present, can also react with the intermediate and the result is the reformation of NAD+. This reversal of the reaction has been observed to be catalyzed by a bifunctional ADP-ribosyl cyclase purified from the spleen(13.Kim H. Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. Science. 1993; 261: 1330-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). That the formation of an intermediate is part of the catalysis of the cyclase is also consistent with the crystal structure of cADPR(3.Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Levitt D. Nature Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 143-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The cycle linkage between the anomeric carbon and the adenine in cADPR is in the β-conformation, the same as in NAD+ (see also Fig. 4). A double inversion at the anomeric carbon resulting from, first, the formation of the intermediate with the cyclase and, second, the subsequent cyclization with the N1 of the adenine, would be consistent with the observed conservation of the conformation of the linkage. The model can also accommodate the enzymatic properties of CD38. One needs only to postulate that, in the case of CD38, the enzyme intermediate is much more accessible to the attack by water. Reacting with water instead of the N-1 of the adenine would result in the formation of ADP-ribose (or ADPDP) instead of cADPR (or cADPRP). The mechanism described so far is similar to that proposed for the bifunctional ADP-ribosyl cyclase (13.Kim H. Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. Science. 1993; 261: 1330-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and the NAD+ glycohydrolase(27.Price, S. R., Pekala, P. H. (1987) Coenzymes and Cofactors (Dolphin, D., Poulson, R., Avramovic, O., eds) Vol. 2, Part B, pp. 513-548Google Scholar). Although the Aplysia ADP-ribosyl cyclase is not an NAD+ glycohydrolase since it does not synthesize ADP-ribose from NAD+, the similarity in the enzymatic mechanism suggests they may all belong to the same family of enzymes. NAD+ glycohydrolases have been known for more than 50 years but their functions have been an enigma(27.Price, S. R., Pekala, P. H. (1987) Coenzymes and Cofactors (Dolphin, D., Poulson, R., Avramovic, O., eds) Vol. 2, Part B, pp. 513-548Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence from this and previous studies on cADPR has pointed to the likelihood that this family of enzymes may be important players in Ca2+ signaling."

The roles of the “accessory” subunits are less certain, and much remains to be revealed about the roles of the accessory subunits in Ca2+ channel formation, processing, regulation, and function.

While channel-specific “β” subunits appear to play roles in certain Na+ and K+ channels, none of these channels are as complex as the Ca2+ channels. The β subunits are particularly intriguing since they are very hydrophilic and are not predicted to possess membrane-spanning domains. To begin to address how these proteins participate in channel function, we have analyzed the properties and interactions of the α1C subunit and β2a subunits of Ca2+ channels in transiently transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) ( 1The abbreviations used are: HEKhuman embryonic kidneyFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateTRITCtetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanateDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPCRpolymerase chain reactionDHPdihydropyridine.) cells. The particular α1C and β2a subunits chosen for analysis are expressed in the heart, brain and other tissues. Based on mRNA studies, they appear to be critical components of what has been traditionally referred to as the “cardiac” L-type channel, and variants of these subunits are likely to also comprise “brain” L-type channels. Our results reveal previously unknown characteristics of the proteins and their interactions, and suggest that the β subunit plays multiple roles in the formation, stabilization, targeting, and modulation of the channel complex. In addition, these are the first results to characterize the properties of these rare membrane proteins at the biochemical level and provide new insights into the poorly understood properties of these proteins. human embryonic kidney fluorescein isothiocyanate tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium polymerase chain reaction dihydropyridine. The α1C cDNA (12.Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 1792-1797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were generous gifts from Drs. Ed Perez-Reyes, Chris Wei, and Lutz Birnbaumer (formerly at Baylor College of Medicine). The human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and the pBRG4 vector were gifts of Dr. Ron Kopito (Stanford University). The large T-antigen-transformed HEK cells (tsA201 cells) were a gift from Dr. Richard Horn (Thomas Jefferson University). The peptide used to prepare the CardC antisera was synthesized by Multiple Peptide Systems (San Diego, CA). FITC- and TRITC-coupled secondary antibodies for immunocytofluorescence were obtained from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD). Protein A-agarose and protein G-agarose were purchased from Sigma. All other reagents were from standard sources. [35S]methionine and [3H]PN200-110 were purchased from Amersham Corp. The cDNA sequence for α1C was excised from pGEM3-α1C using HindIII and KpnI, subsequently blunt-ended and cloned into a blunt-ended EcoRI site of the pRBG4 polylinker. The cDNA sequence of β2a was excised from pKS-β2a using EcoRI and cloned into the EcoRI site of the pRBG4 polylinker and the EcoRI site of pMT21. The cDNA for the epitope-tagged β2a-KT3, which contains the epitope TPPPEPET immediately distal to the last amino acid residue in β2a (Q604), was made using the following primers (KT3 coding sequence in plus strand shown underlined): 5′-GTATACATCCGCCAAACTCCACCACCAGAACCAGAAACATGACCGTGCGTGTCTCTGC-3′ (plus strand) and 5′-TTGGACAAACCACAACTAGAATGC-3′ (minus strand). The fragment encoding the KT3 epitope was substituted into pRBG-β2a as an AccI-HindIII fragment. Cell lines were maintained in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C in 5% CO2. Transfections were done using the HEPES-buffered calcium phosphate method (13.Kingston R.E. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. J. Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1995: 9.1.1-9.1.3Google Scholar) in 100-mm polystyrene tissue culture plates. Cells were refed with fresh media 1-3 h prior to addition of DNA. Unless otherwise indicated in the text, transfections were performed with 30 μg of each expression plasmid, with all transfections normalized to 60 μg of total DNA using either pRBG4 vector or sheared salmon sperm DNA (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were incubated with DNA for 6-8 h, after which a 30% DMEM-Me2SO solution was added to a final concentration of 10% Me2SO, followed by a 6-min incubation. Subsequently, cells were refed with fresh media and incubated at 37°C until further evaluation. Post-transfection times reflect hours following Me2SO shock, which is considered as 0 h. In co-transfection experiments, similar results were seen when DNA amounts were normalized with either salmon sperm DNA or pRBG4 vector or when DNA amounts were not normalized (data not shown). Experiments using cycloheximide contained cycloheximide at a concentration of 100 μg/ml. The Card C antibody was prepared in rabbits against a peptide C (QSEEALADRRAGVS; residues 2156-2169) in the C-terminal portion of the predicted protein sequence (Fig. 1A). The antipeptide antibody was raised and characterized in our laboratory ( 2T. S. Puri and M. M. Hosey, manuscript in preparation.) using methods previously described(14.Brawley R.M. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18218-18223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The internal α1C antibody was generated against a fusion protein containing sequence from the II-III cytoplasmic linker (residues 812-929) of the predicted α1C sequence (Fig. 1A), which was amplified using PCR and cloned in-frame into an expression vector encoding a 6x-His tag on the N terminus (Qiagen Corp., Chatsworth, CA). The PCR primers used contained the sequence (forward primer) 5′-CCGGAGAAGAAACAAGAGGTGG-3′ and (reverse primer) 5′-ACGATACGGTGACACTGGAGGC-3′. The antibody against the β2a subunit was prepared against a fusion protein containing the C-terminal portion (residues 462-600) of the predicted β2a sequence (Fig. 1 C). The C terminus of β2a was amplified by PCR and cloned in-frame into an expression vector encoding a 6x-His tag on the N terminus. The PCR primers used contained the sequences 5′-GAAGAAGAACCTTGTCTGGAACC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-TACATCCCTGTTCCACTCGCCAGC-3′ (reverse primer). Fusion proteins were purified using a Ni-NTA agarose resin (Qiagen Corp). Following purification of the fusion proteins, they were injected into rabbits and polyclonal antisera were prepared (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX). Antibody production was monitored by either an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the α1 peptide as the antigen, or by using fusion proteins and baculovirus-expressed proteins2 in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/immunoblotting assays. The specificity of the β2a antibodies was assessed using the β2a fusion protein and membrane preparations containing different types of β-subunits (Fig. 1). In contrast to its reactivity toward the β2a subunit, the antibody showed no reactivity toward transverse-tubule membranes prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle (14.Brawley R.M. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18218-18223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) which contain the β1 subunit (Fig. 1). To visualize expressed proteins in preparations from transfected cells by immunoblotting, either whole cells or crude membranes were used. Cells were homogenized in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA and protease inhibitors (0.2 mM phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, 100 nM aprotinin, 1 μM leupeptin, 1 μM pepstatin A, 1 mM soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mM iodoacetamide) using a Tri-R homogenizer at setting 7. To prepare crude membranes, the homogenates were centrifuged at 2100 rpm for 5 min and the supernatants were subsequently centrifuged at 42,000 rpm for 60 min in a Type 65 rotor. Proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing the indicated concentrations of acrylamide, transferred to nitrocellulose, and processed for immunoblotting as described previously(14.Brawley R.M. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18218-18223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Detection was with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham), horseradish peroxidase, or alkaline phosphatase as described(15.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Cells for immunofluorescent studies were transfected in 100-mm plates as described above and subsequently split ~20 h post-transfection to coverslips coated with poly-L-lysine (Sigma). Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (EM Sciences) 40-60 h post-transfection and subsequently permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with normal goat serum (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with the primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature, and then incubation with an TRITC- or FITC-coupled secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted onto slides for viewing with confocal microscope. Cells were removed from tissue culture dishes using DMEM/F-12 (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) and gentle pipetting. Cells were resuspended at a concentration of 0.2-0.5 mg of protein/ml. The radioligand used was [3H]PN200-110. Nonspecific binding was assessed in the presence of 10−5M nitrendipine. Whole-cell protein assays were used to determine the amount of protein per assay (20-50 μg). More than 80% of the cells used for binding assays excluded trypan blue. Binding reactions were incubated for 3 h at 4°C and subsequently filtered through Whatman GF/A filters using a Brandel cell harvester. Scatchard analysis was performed to assess Bmax and Kd. Statistical calculations were performed using the GraphPad InStat program. Transfected cells were incubated with methionine-free media (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 30 min prior to labeling, and subsequently incubated with 2-3 ml of methionine-free DMEM containing [35S]methionine (0.1 mCi/ml) for 30 min at 37°C and chased using media containing an excess of unlabeled methionine (15 mg/ml). Cells were harvested at various time points following the removal of the radiolabeled media and subsequently frozen at −80°C. Cells were thawed at 4°C, and membranes were prepared as described above. Membrane particulate fractions were solubilized using 1% digitonin and 1% Nonidet P-40 in homogenization buffer containing protease inhibitors. Solubilized proteins were immunoprecipitated using either the Card C antibody coupled to protein A agarose, the Card I antibody coupled to protein G-agarose, or the β2 antibody coupled to protein A-agarose. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer for 2-5 min at 95°C. Radiolabeled proteins were visualized using FujiBAS imaging plates and a BAS2000 phosphorimager. Cells were split 8 h post-transfection onto poly-L-lysine-coated coverslips. Voltage clamping, pulse generation, and data acquisition were carried out with an Axopatch 200A or 1A series voltage clamp (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA) and a 16-bit A/D-D/A card operating at 120 kHz (HSDAS 16, Analogic Corp., Wakefield, MA), with a PC-compatible computer. The data acquisition and pulse generation routines were generated by Dr. Ivan Stavrovsky in the Rios laboratory. Asymmetric currents were obtained by subtraction of control currents elicited with pulses from −130 to −100 mV. The set of control and test pulses were separated by 20 s. The internal solution contained (in mM) 150 Cs+, 125 Asp−, 15 Cl−, 5 MgATP, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, pH 7.6, adjusted by CsOH. The external solution contained (in mM) 130 NaCl, 10 HEPES, and either 10 Ca2+ or 10 Ba2+. When necessary, we added 10−6M of TTX in the external solution in order to block endogenous Na+ inward current. The density of this current was relatively small (less than 1 A/F) and early passage cells did not have this Na+ current. Differences in current densities in different groups of cells were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney rank sum test and forward stepwise regression routines of the SigmaStat software package (Jandel Scientific, Corte Madera, CA). We first asked if the α1C subunit could be expressed in HEK cells using the pRBG4 mammalian cell expression vector which had previously been used to express the μI Na+ channel in HEK cells(16.Ukomadu C. Zhou J. Sigworth F.J. Agnew W.S. Neuron. 1992; 8: 663-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Cells were transiently transfected with either empty vector or the pRBG-α1C plasmid using the calcium phosphate method and isolated after 40-60 h as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Two different antibodies specific for the α1C subunit, Card I and Card C (Fig. 1A), were developed and used to visualize the expressed protein on immunoblots. The α1C subunit was detected as a single large molecular species of ~240 kDa, which migrated more slowly than the myosin (205 kDa) molecular mass marker (Fig. 1B). The observed size of the α1C subunit is close to the cDNA-predicted size of the full-length α1C subunit (242,771 daltons; (12.Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 340: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar)). The size of the expressed protein and its reactivity with the Card C antibody, which is directed at 14 of the last 16 amino acids in the C terminus, suggested that the expressed protein was a full-length protein with an intact C terminus. In addition, a single immunoreactive protein of the same electrophoretic mobility was detected by the Card I antibody (Fig. 1B), which reacts with the II-III cytoplasmic linker of the cardiac α1 subunit, thus providing further evidence that the expressed α1 subunit is an intact full-length protein. In agreement with this conclusion, we also observed expression of a similarly sized protein using recombinant baculovirus to direct the expression of the α1C subunit in insect Sf9 cells.2 The baculovirus-expressed protein additionally contained an epitope tag in its N terminus, which allowed us to confirm that the expressed protein was full-length. The size of the expressed α1C subunit was larger than that of the α1 subunit in L-type channel preparations previously purified from cardiac tissue(17.Chang F.C. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18929-18937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the purified cardiac protein may have been proteolyzed during the isolation procedure, or alternatively, that tissue-specific modification of the α1 subunits occurs. Previous observations have shown that C-terminal truncation of other α1 subunits occurs in native tissues such as skeletal muscle (14.Brawley R.M. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18218-18223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.DeJongh K.S. Warner C. Colvin A.A. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The expressed β2a subunit was visualized on immunoblots using an antibody specific for the C-terminal region of β2a (Fig. 1, C and D). The anti-β2a antibody detected a protein of ~68 and 72 kDa in transfected HEK cells (Fig. 1D, lane 1). The cDNA for β2a predicts a highly hydrophilic protein of 68,191 daltons, which is approximately 10 kDa larger than the β1 subunit expressed in skeletal muscle(5.Perez-Reyes E. Castellano A. Kim H.S.

Science. 1989; 245: 1115-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The specificity of the β2a antibody was demonstrated by the lack of detection of immunoreactive species in non-transfected cells or in purified transverse tubule membranes from skeletal muscle, which contain the β1 subunit (Fig. 1D, lanes 2 and 3). When higher resolution SDS gels were used, the expressed β2a subunit was detected in immunoblots as a series of three to four immunoreactive bands between 68 and 72 kDa (Fig. 2A). These multiple immunoreactive species were also detected when cells were labeled with [35S]methionine and the β2a subunit was immunoprecipitated with the anti-β2a antibody (Fig. 2A, lane 1). The fastest migrating species corresponded to the predicted 68-kDa size, while the slower migrating species were larger than predicted, possibly representing post-translationally modified proteins. Expression of β2a-KT3, which contains the entire coding sequence of β2a in addition to an 8-amino acid C-terminal KT3 epitope tag(23.Arthur H. Walter G. J. Virol. 1984; 52: 483-491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), also led to the appearance of multiple immunoreactive species that could be detected with either the anti-β2a antibody or with the monoclonal KT3 antibody (Fig. 2B). The comparative electrophoretic mobility of β2a-KT3, which has a predicted molecular mass of 69,183 daltons, suggested that the difference in size between the two fastest migrating species of untagged β2a was less than 1 kDa (Fig. 2A, lane 3). The reactivity of all the β2a isoforms with a monoclonal KT3 antibody (Fig. 2B) indicates that the multiple isoforms do not represent C-terminal truncations. Consequently, it is unlikely that modifications involving proteolytic processing of the C terminus, such as prenylations, are involved in the post-translational modification of the β2a subunit. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the protein product of the β2a cDNA. Pulse-chase experiments using [35S]methionine were performed using transfected β2a cells to determine whether the higher molecular mass isoforms were the result of post-translational modification. The results indicated that the β2a protein was initially synthesized as a 68-kDa protein (Fig. 2C), the size predicted from the cDNA sequence. As time elapsed, higher molecular mass bands of ~69 and 72 kDa appeared on the 35S image, suggesting that the higher molecular mass isoforms of the β2a subunit arose due to multiple post-translational modifications of the 68-kDa form. Similar results were observed in cells expressing either β2a alone (Fig. 2C, upper panel) or both α1 and β2a (Fig. 2C, lower panel). The modification was not due to phosphorylation of the protein ( 3X. Zhao, B. Gerhardstein, and M. M. Hosey, unpublished observations.) and the predicted primary structure lacks signature sequences, in the proper context, for myristoylation or isoprenylation. The modification took place on a relatively slow time scale; the change in distribution of isoforms was not observed until several hours after the initial synthesis of the protein. Co-expression with α1C did not appear to affect either the rate or extent of the post-translational modification. Further studies will be necessary to reveal the nature of these modifications. The β2a subunit isoforms, measured collectively, appeared to turn over relatively slowly with no discernible difference between β2a and α1C/β2a cells. When the total immunoreactive β2a subunit bands were analyzed collectively, the estimated half-life was >8 h (data not shown). However, this is a crude estimate, because the change in distribution of label between the multiple forms, as well as the possibility that the different isoforms may turnover at different rates, did not allow an accurate analysis of the half-life. Because the β subunits of Ca2+ channels are very hydrophilic and possess no predicted transmembrane domains, they might be expected to behave as soluble cytosolic proteins, particularly when expressed in the absence of other channel subunits. Against this expectation, when the amount of immunoreactive β2a protein was assessed in cytosolic and crude membrane fractions, all immunoreactive material was found in the particulate fractions (Fig. 3A). No immunoreactivity was detected in cytosolic fractions (Fig. 3A). Further characterization of the properties of the membrane localized β subunit were performed to assess the solubility of the β2a subunit in salt and in various detergents (Fig. 3B). All agents tested solubilized a portion of the protein. The highest degree of solubility was observed in 1% digitonin/0.4 M NaCl, which was comparable to that observed with 1% SDS (data not shown). Significantly less protein was solubilized with Nonidet P-40 or Triton X-100, which may suggest an association of one or more forms of β2a with cytoskeletal elements. NaCl also appeared to solubilize a portion of the protein. Interestingly, β2a protein from fractions that were salt-insoluble could be further solubilized with digitonin, and β2a protein from digitonin-insoluble fractions could be further solubilized with NaCl (data not shown), suggesting that salt and digitonin may solubilize two distinct populations of β2a. This explanation could account for the high solubility of β2a in digitonin/NaCl despite relatively poorer solubility in digitonin alone and NaCl alone. To further characterize the cellular location of the expressed β subunit, cells transiently expressing the β2a subunit were fixed, permeabilized, stained with the β2 antisera, and viewed using confocal microscopy (Fig. 4). In these experiments, staining of the β2a subunit clearly was present at the periphery of the cells, suggesting a membrane localization (Fig. 4A). In addition, diffuse staining was observed in intracellular compartments. No specific immunoreactivity was seen when preimmune antisera was used (data not shown). Based on the cellular fractionation data, the intracellular pools of the β subunit must reflect β in intracellular membranes associated with protein processing rather than “soluble” protein. Indeed, when cells were pretreated with cycloheximide 2 h prior to fixing and staining, almost all of the β-subunit immunofluorescence was seen in dense patches at the plasma membrane, with very little staining inside the cell (Fig. 4C). Presumably, cycloheximide treatment inhibited new synthesis of the β subunit and allowed the protein that was already made to be processed and transported to the plasma membrane. These results strongly suggest that the β subunit, which has been referred to as “the cytosolic subunit,” is actually localized to membranes. The β2a subunit was also membrane-localized when expressed in mammalian baby hamster kidney cell ( 4T. Y. Gao and M. M. Hosey, unpublished observations.) and in insect Sf9 cells from a recombinant baculovirus,2 indicating that this is not a cell-specific phenomenon. Previous studies have shown that the β subunit increases current density, but the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is not understood. Therefore, we next asked whether the β subunit might modulate the levels of the α1 subunit and/or its membrane localization. Upon cell fractionation, the α1C subunit was localized to particulate fractions (Fig. 5A, inset). Importantly, co-expression with the β subunit did not affect the total amount of detectable α1 subunit. This was ascertained by immunoblotting of membranes and/or cell lysates (Fig. 5A) in a large number of preparations. In addition, we observed that peak α1 expression occurred between 24 and 36 h post-transfection in both α1C (data not shown) and α1C/β2a cells (Fig. 8C). No significant differences in total α1C protein levels were seen at any time point between α1C and α1C/β2a cells within individual experiments.Figure 8:Effects of the β subunit on the appearance of Ca2+ currents as a function of time post-transfection.

Muc-1 is highly expressed and aberrantly glycosylated by most carcinomas and metastatic lesions. Numerous functions have been proposed for this molecule, including protection of the epithelial cell surface, an involvement in epithelial organogenesis, and a role in tumor progression. Mice deficient in Muc-1 were generated using homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. These mice appeared to develop normally and were healthy and fertile. However, the growth rate of primary breast tumors induced by polyoma middle T antigen was found to be significantly slower in Muc-1 deficient mice. This suggests that Muc-1 plays an important role in the progression of mammary carcinoma."

Phosphorylated/activated STATs then dimerize, translocate to the nucleus, and direct transcription of specific target genes. For example, the first member of the STAT family (designated Stat1α) undergoes tyrosine 701 and serine 727 phosphorylation in response to IFN-γ(5.Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar). This activation step is triggered by IFN-γ-323232dependent oligomerization of the IFN-γ receptor and consequent cross-phosphorylation of receptor-associated Jak1 and Jak2 kinases and the receptor α-chain(6.Greenlund A.C.

Receptor phosphorylation enables α-chain recruitment of Stat1 via its SH2 domain. Stat1 then undergoes phosphorylation and release from the receptor as a homodimer that can translocate to the nucleus and bind to a specific DNA element (7.Lew D.J. Decker T. Strehlow I.

Thus, distinct protein/protein interactions are critical for Stat1-dependent signal transduction events at the IFN-γ receptor, but the nature of Stat1 interactions with other proteins (especially other transcription factors) in the nucleus is less certain.

Our methods for isolation and culture of hTBEC monolayers, preparation of hTBEC cellular and nuclear proteins, and gel mobility-shift assays have been described previously(9.Look D.C. Keller B.T.

Gel mobility-shift assays were modified to include UV-induced DNA-protein cross-linking and analysis of cross-linked complexes by SDS-PAGE. To enhance UV-induced cross-linking, double-stranded BrdUrd-containing oligonucleotides were generated by using the first strand as a template for second strand synthesis with the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (Promega), an octamer primer, a dNTP mixture containing BrdUrd (Sigma) in place of thymidine, and [α-P]dCTP. Nuclear protein/oligonucleotide mixtures initially underwent standard gel mobility-shift assay, and the shifted bands containing 32P-labeled complexes were localized by overnight autoradiography at 4°C, excised, and subjected to UV-irradiation (λ = 254 nm). The gel slices were then equilibrated with sample buffer, boiled, and subjected to SDS-PAGE with 10% polyacrylamide. The resolved DNA-protein complexes were electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and subjected to autoradiography. To determine if the DNA-protein complexes contained Stat1α and/or Stat1β, PVDF membranes containing resolved complexes were treated with 15% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min, blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered 0.9% NaCl with 0.1% Tween 20, and then incubated with p91 and/or p91T antisera. Primary Ab binding was then detected using anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Boehringer Mannheim) and an enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham International). The luciferase-reporter plasmid with ICAM-1 gene sequence (−130 to −35) driving the Photinus pyralis luciferase gene (pBH-130-35ICAM-1-luc) was described previously(10.Look D.C. Pelletier M.R.

ICAM-1 (−130 to −35) with an inverted repeat mutation was generated by PCR using BamHI-digested pBH-1335ICAM-1/MUT1-luc (which contains the sequence GACCTCTTACA in place of wild-type inverted repeat TTTCCGGGAAA) as DNA template(10.Look D.C.

ICAM-1 (−130 to −35) with a GC box mutation was generated by PCR using BamHI-digested pBH-176ICAM-1-luc as template(13.Voraberger G. Schafer R. Stratowa C. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2777-2786PubMed Google Scholar), the same downstream primer as for the inverted repeat mutation, and an upstream primer containing a KpnI site and ICAM-1 sequence −130 to −76 with the sequence CCGAAC replacing the putative Sp1 sequence CCGCCC at −99 to −94. PCR products were digested with KpnI and HindIII, purified by electrophoresis, and ligated into KpnI/HindIII-digested pBH-luc(13.Voraberger G. Schafer R. Stratowa C. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2777-2786PubMed Google Scholar). The luciferase-reporter plasmid with ICAM-1 gene sequence (−130 to −94) and the minimal promoter sequence from the Herpes simplex thymidine kinase gene (pBH-130-94ICAM-1-TK-luc) was described previously(10.Look D.C.

Corresponding plasmids with mutations of the ICAM-1 gene inverted repeat or GC box were generated by synthesis of double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the wild-type or mutant ICAM-1 sequence, an upstream NotI, and a downstream XhoI site followed by ligation into NotI/XhoI-digested pBH-TK-luc. The ICAM-1-Gal4-luciferase-reporter plasmid (pBH-130-35ICAM-1/Gal4-luc) was generated by ligating a double-stranded oligonucleotide with two Gal4 sites (14.Giniger E. Varnum S. Ptashne M.

Cell transfection and reporter gene assays (for luciferase and CAT activities) were performed as described previously(10.Look D.C. Pelletier M.R. Holtzman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8952-8958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For cotransfection experiments, the levels of reporter and expression plasmids were titered to provide similar levels of basal promoter activity among experiments (7.5 μg of reporter plasmid and 0.1-2.5 μg of expression plasmid were used per 60-mm culture plate). Whole cell protein extracts were prepared by lysing hTBECs in 50 mM Tris, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 750 μM dithiothreitol, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mM sodium fluoride, 2 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. For co-immunoprecipitations, 200 μg of cell protein was incubated for 1 h at 4°C with 5 μg of primary Ab in 500 μl of lysis buffer. Control Ab was an immunoaffinity-purified antiserum against an irrelevant peptide. Immune complexes were precipitated with Protein A-Sepharose and then immunblotted and detected as described for DNA-protein cross-linking experiments. To investigate the basis for STAT-dependent transcription, we used a primary culture epithelial cell (hTBEC) model that exhibits IFN-γ-dependent ICAM-1 expression under the control of an IRE at nucleotides −130 to −94 of the ICAM-1 gene(10.Look D.C. Pelletier M.R. Holtzman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8952-8958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This IRE contains an inverted repeat (at −116 to −106) that is critical for forming an IRE-binding complex (IRE-BC) and for IFN-γ responsiveness of the ICAM-1 gene, and this inverted repeat is similar to a motif found in several other IFN-γ-responsive genes(7.Lew D.J. Decker T. Strehlow I. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 20.Sims S.H. Cha Y. Romine M.F. Gao P.-Q. Gottlieb K. Deisseroth A.B. Mol. Cell.

Darnell J.E. Science. 1992; 258: 1808-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 22.Perez C. Wietzerbin J. Benech P.D. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), and this capacity is also exhibited by the inverted repeat in the ICAM-1 gene in transformed cell lines (26.Yuan J. Wegenka U.M.

DNA-protein cross-linking experiments using the ICAM-1 gene inverted repeat and nuclear proteins from IFN-γ-stimulated hTBECs indicate that Stat1 directly contacts the DNA at this site (Fig. 1). Although a series of IFN-γ-responsive genes share a capacity to bind Stat1, it is not clear that Stat1 binding alone is sufficient for full responsiveness to IFN-γ. For example, deleting DNA elements surrounding the inverted repeat leads to a marked decrease in the maximal level of responsiveness to IFN-γ that is often linked to a concomitant decrease in (cytokine-independent) basal promoter activity (10.Look D.C. Pelletier M.R. Holtzman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8952-8958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Pearse R.N. Feinman R. Shuai K. Darnell J.E.J. Ravetch J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Cao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11641-11645Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Basal activity and IFN-γ responsiveness are restored when the Stat1-binding site is placed in front of a heterologous promoter(10.Look D.C. Pelletier M.R. Holtzman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8952-8958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but these systems may include other DNA elements that could synergize with the Stat1 site (as noted below). We were therefore interested in further analyzing the types of DNA/protein and protein/protein interactions in the ICAM-1 gene promoter region that serve to fully activate IFN-γ-driven transcription. A distinct feature of the ICAM-1 gene IRE is the presence of a putative binding site (a GC box at −99 to −94) for the Sp1 transcription factor (29.Courey A.J. Tjian R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 743-767Google Scholar) at the 3′-end of the element (Fig. 2A). Accordingly, we performed gel mobility-shift assays using the ICAM-1 gene inverted repeat and the adjacent GC box. When the GC box and adjoining sequence were included in the oligonucleotide probe, a second more slowly migrating complex (designated IRE-BC2) was observed (Fig. 2B). This behavior fits with observations that: (i) in general, the GC box alone is necessary but not sufficient for Sp1-binding so that some less specific adjoining sequence is also required(30.Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Nature. 1985; 316: 774-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar); and (ii) for the ICAM-1 gene, the footprint for Sp1 extends to nt −81 by DNase I protection mapping. 2D. C. Look, M. R. Pelletier, and M. J. Holtzman, unpublished results. Formation of IRE-BC2 was decreased by mutation of the GC box but not by mutation of the inverted repeat, whereas formation of the original, faster migrating complex (designated IRE-BC1) was decreased by inverted repeat but not by GC mutation (Fig. 2C). In addition, IRE-BC2 was present in unstimulated and IFN-γ-stimulated cells and was supershifted with anti-Sp1 Ab, whereas IRE-BC1 was present only in IFN-γ-stimulated cells and was reactive only with anti-Stat1 Abs (Fig. 2, C and D). Thus, two distinct sites in the ICAM-1 gene IRE (an inverted repeat at −116 to −106 and a GC box at −99 to −94) are responsible for formation of two DNA-protein complexes: IRE-BC1, which contains Stat1; and IRE-BC2, which contains Sp1. The functional significance of Sp1- and Stat1-binding sites for IFN-γ-responsiveness of the ICAM-1 gene was determined using a series of ICAM-1/luciferase-reporter gene constructs in transient transfection assays of unstimulated versus IFN-γ-stimulated epithelial cells. Reporter constructs contained either wild-type ICAM-1 gene 5′-flanking sequence or the same sequence with mutation of the Stat1-binding inverted repeat (−116 to −106) or the Sp1-binding GC box (−99 to −94). Mutations that blocked protein binding to either site also blocked IFN-γ responsiveness in transfection experiments using constructs containing ICAM-1 gene sequence from −130 to −35 (i.e. using the ICAM-1 gene endogenous promoter, Fig. 3A) or ICAM-1 sequence from −130 to −94 fused to a minimal promoter construct containing the Herpes simplex thymidine kinase gene promoter (i.e. using a heterologous promoter, Fig. 3B). Thus, a functional Sp1 site (located close to the transcription initiation site) was required for full IFN-γ responsiveness. To determine whether the effect of Sp1 was specific or could be conferred by any transcriptional activator, Sp1 and a series of activators were brought to the promoter as fusion proteins containing a Gal4 DNA-binding domain. Direct evidence that Sp1 is needed for full IFN-γ responsiveness was obtained when co-transfection of a Gal4/Sp1 fusion protein restored full responsiveness to a relatively inactive construct containing ICAM-1 5′-flanking sequence with a Gal4-binding site in place of the Sp1-binding site (Fig. 3C). Specificity for Sp1 was indicated when its capacity to restore full responsiveness was not shared with the transactivating domains of several other transcription factors (including p65/RelA, Fos, or E1a), even though each of these factors was capable of increasing basal promoter activity to a similar level (Fig. 3C). Taken together, the results indicate that both Stat1 and Sp1 binding are required for maximal IFN-γ activation of the ICAM-1 gene. The proximity of the two binding sites and the selective effect of Sp1 also suggested a specific interaction between the two transcription factors. Accordingly, we next examined the capacity of Sp1 and Stat1 for direct protein/protein interaction. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments using either nuclear or whole cell extracts from unstimulated or IFN-γ-stimulated cells indicated direct Sp1/Stat1 interaction (Fig. 4, A and B). This interaction was therefore not dependent on Stat1 phosphorylation state. Additional immunoblotting indicated that hTBECs also contain Stat2, −3, −5, and −6; however, only Stat3 appeared to directly interact with Sp1 (data not shown). This finding correlates with a higher degree of homology between Stat1 and Stat3 than among other STAT family members(31.Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.C. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L.

Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that Stat1 was localized to the cytosol in unstimulated cells and to the nucleus in IFN-γ-stimulated cells, whereas Sp1 was found in the nucleus under both conditions (data not shown). Predominant Sp1/Stat1 interaction must therefore occur in the nucleus and is limited by nuclear translocation of Stat1. In summary, we find that maximal IFN-γ-driven activation of the ICAM-1 gene depends on two critical DNA/protein interactions: 1) an inverted repeat motif that mediates direct binding of activated/phosphorylated Stat1, and 2) a GC box motif that recruits constitutively active Sp1. We also present evidence for Stat1/Sp1 interaction that may serve to confer an additional element of specificity for transcriptional activation (Fig. 4, C and D). In this model, Sp1 may help recruit Stat1 to the promoter and/or may serve to better link Stat1 action to the basal transcription complex. Interestingly, IFN-γ-dependent activation of a second immune response gene in airway epithelial cells, the interferon regulatory factor-1 gene, is also Stat1-dependent2 and also contains a GC box with a corresponding DNA footprint downstream of the inverted repeat motif(20.Sims S.H.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3033-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, IFN-γ-driven activation of an immune response subset may be linked by a signal transduction pathway that includes transcriptional synergy between Stat1 and Sp1. Single-cytokine activation of this subset in the epithelial barrier provides an efficient molecular basis for mediating mucosal immunity and inflammation. We gratefully acknowledge D. Dean and M.

All MMPs are secreted in proenzyme forms, and much research has been aimed at elucidating the proteolytic mechanisms required to elicit their full activities.

Gelatinase A (MMP-2, 72-kDa gelatinase, type IV collagenase) is of great current interest, not only because of its possible involvement in tumor invasion and metastasis (Stetler-Stevenson et al., 1993; Tsuchiya et al., 1994) but also because the proenzyme cannot be activated by any of the suggested physiological activators of other MMPs including serine proteinases (Okada et al., 1990; Nagase et al., 1991), although activation by other MMPs, especially matrilysin (Crabbe et al., 1994a) and collagenase (Crabbe et al., 1994b), has recently been described.

The importance of the C-terminal domain of the enzyme for the binding to cell membranes and subsequent activation was demonstrated (Murphy et al., 1991; Strongin et al., 1993; Ward et al., 1994). Cell membrane-mediated cleavage of progelatinase A to a 62-kDa active form (Tyr-81) occurs via a 64-kDa intermediate (Leu-38) (Strongin et al., 1993), and exogenous TIMP-2 specifically inhibits the activation process. Sato et al.(1994) recently reported the cloning of a novel transmembrane member of the matrix metalloproteinase family (MT-MMP) and showed that cells transfected with MT-MMP cDNA can effect the activation of progelatinase A. Questions therefore arise about the precise mechanism of activation of progelatinase A by stimulated fibroblasts, especially whether MT-MMP is an obligatory component, the relative roles of other metalloproteinases, and the involvement of self-cleavage. In this study we have made use of a previously described mutant form of gelatinase A (Crabbe et al., 1994c), in which the active site glutamate was replaced by alanine (E375A). The mutant can be proteolytically processed to remove the propeptide (Crabbe et al., 1994c) but yields a catalytically inactive enzyme that cannot self-process. We have investigated the hypothesis that cell membrane-mediated activation of progelatinase A is, by analogy with other matrix metalloproteinases (Murphy et al., 1987; Nagase et al., 1990), a complex activation cascade. We show that it is likely to involve MT-MMP, which can be induced in fibroblasts by ConA, and bimolecular autolysis. E375A mutant progelatinase A was constructed, expressed, and purified as described by Crabbe et al. (1994c). Recombinant wild type human progelatinase A, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 were purified from media conditioned by the relevant transfected mouse myeloma cells as described (Crabbe et al., 1993; Murphy et al., 1991, 1992; Willenbrock et al., 1993). Digoxigenin-11-UTP, nylon membrane, and a Nucleic Acid Detection Kit were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim, East Sussex, UK. Other transcription reagents and pBluescript KS(+) were obtained from Stratagene Ltd., Cambridge, UK. Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane, ECL Kit for Western blotting autoradiography, and luminescence detection film were all from Amersham Life Sciences, Amersham, Bucks, UK. Peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG was from Sigma, and the membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase (MT-MMP) monoclonal antibody (113-5B7) raised against the peptide CDGNFDTVAMLRGEM (residues 310-333) of MT-MMP was a kind gift from Dr. K. Iwata, Fuji Chemical Industries, Toyama, Japan. Human infant foreskin fibroblasts were prepared and subcultured as described (Ward et al., 1994; Heath et al., 1982). Cells from passages 4 to 7 were used for the monolayer experiments. The CHO-L761 h cell line was kindly donated by Celltech Ltd., Slough, Berks, UK. Confluent fibroblast monolayers were cultured for 24 h in the presence or absence of ConA, then total cellular RNA was isolated by the guanidinium thiocyanate method (Chomczynski and Sacchi, 1987). RNA samples (5 μg/lane) were separated through a 1% agarose, 2.2 M formaldehyde gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and cross-linked with uv light as described by Sambrook et al.(1989). Equivalent loading of RNA samples was assured by ethidium bromide staining of the gel before transfer. After prehybridization, the membrane was hybridized overnight at 68°C with 50 ng/ml digoxigenin-labeled riboprobe. Prehybridization, hybridization, and washing of the membrane were carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol (Boehringer Mannheim). Hybrids were revealed using an anti-digoxigenin antibody labeled with alkaline phosphatase, and nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate substrate. A 1.5-kilobase EcoRI-BamHI fragment containing the majority of the coding sequence of MT-MMP (Takino et al., 1995) was subcloned into pBluescript II KS(+), and a labeled antisense riboprobe was generated from the linearized template by transcribing in the presence of digoxigenin-11-UTP. Crude plasma membrane enriched preparations from unstimulated or ConA-stimulated fibroblasts (Ward et al., 1991) were electrophoresed on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions. The proteins were transferred by electroblotting overnight onto nitrocellulose membranes. Transferred proteins were then probed with human anti-MT-MMP monoclonal antibody (113-5B7), and proteins reacting with the antibody were detected using a peroxidase-labeled sheep anti-mouse IgG and revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence. The E375A mutant and wild type progelatinase A were first dialyzed into 10 mM sodium tetraborate, 10 mM CaCl2, pH 8.5, then immediately labeled using the method of Bolton and Hunter(1973) with 100 μCi of 125I reagent per 5 μg of protein. Unbound 125I was separated by centrifuging on Sephadex G-15 spin columns at 200 × g for 3 min at 4°C, and the integrity of the labeled proteins was checked by SDS-PAGE and silver stain followed by autoradiography. Comparison of unlabeled and 125I-labeled enzymes analyzed by gelatin zymography and silver-stained reducing SDS-PAGE demonstrated that although there was a small loss of protein after the labeling procedure there was no effect on specific activity. It had previously been established that treatment of wild type progelatinase A with cold Bolton-Hunter reagent had no deleterious effect on the enzyme activity as determined by [14C]gelatin degradation. Specific activity was determined for each enzyme and was in the order of 106 cpm/μg. Freshly subcultured CHO-L761 h cells (Cockett et al., 1990) were seeded at 5 × 105 cells per well into 24-well Linbro plates 1 day prior to transfection, and cultures were maintained at 37°C, with 5% CO2 in DMEM and 10% fetal calf serum. Transfection was performed essentially according to the method of Chen and Okayama(1987). An EcoRI fragment of the MT-MMP cDNA was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pEE12 (Murphy et al., 1991), and 10 μg/well of pEE12 MT-MMP or pEE12 vector alone were co-precipitated with calcium phosphate and incubated with the cells for 3-4 h at 37°C, 5% CO2. Media were removed, and the cells were exposed for 1 min to 15% glycerol in DMEM. The glycerol was thoroughly removed, and the cells were washed briefly in DMEM. The cultures were then incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 overnight in DMEM and 10% fetal calf serum containing 10 mM sodium butyrate. The following day screening for progelatinase A activation was performed by incubating the cells for 20 h in serum-free conditions with either 125I-labeled progelatinase A or with 125I-labeled E375A mutant. Equimolar, unlabeled catalytically active gelatinase A was included in some of the cultures together with the inactive 125I-labeled E375A enzyme. Culture supernatants were harvested, centrifuged, and analyzed by gelatin zymography followed by autoradiography so that gelatin degrading activity as well as enzyme processing could be assessed. 125I-Labeled E375A mutant or wild type progelatinase A (9 nM) was incubated with either unstimulated fibroblasts or cells that had been prestimulated for 20 h with ConA. Briefly, fibroblasts which had just reached confluence in 24-well Linbro culture dishes were washed free of serum and incubated for 20 h at 37°C in DMEM, with or without 50 μg/ml ConA. In some experiments, proteinase inhibitors were added. The washed cell monolayers were then incubated further for up to 24 h without ConA, but with inhibitors if appropriate. Exogenous 125I-labeled E375A mutant or wild type 125I-labeled progelatinase A was also added during the second incubation. Media from the final 24-h incubation period were analyzed by gelatin zymography followed by autoradiography. Aliquots of either 125I-labeled E375A mutant (14 nM) or wild type 125I-labeled progelatinase A (14 nM) were incubated at 37°C for varying times with or without crude plasma membrane preparation (40 μg) (Ward et al., 1991). At the end of the incubation period, the reactions were stopped by the addition of nonreducing sample buffer, and samples were analyzed by gelatin zymography followed by autoradiography. TIMP-1 or TIMP-2 was added at varying doses to unstimulated or ConA-stimulated fibroblast monolayers for up to 24 h together with the 125I-labeled enzymes. For the study of the inhibition of isolated membrane processing of 125I-labeled E375A mutant or wild type progelatinase A, TIMPs were included in the incubation mixture along with the 125I-labeled enzymes and incubated at 37°C overnight. Products of the reactions were analyzed by gelatin zymography followed by autoradiography. Various other classes of inhibitors were also studied including pepstatin (0.7 μg/ml), aprotinin (2 μg/ml), α2-antiplasmin (50 μg/ml), and L-trans-epoxysuccinic acid (E64, 2 μg/ml). Samples of either wild type or E375A progelatinase A (2 μM) were incubated at 37°C with three concentrations of APMA-activated gelatinase A subsequent to APMA removal by gel filtration. At specified times, aliquots were removed and analyzed by reduced SDS-PAGE. Completed gels were stained for protein with Coomassie Blue R-250, and the remaining proenzyme was quantitated using a Computing Densitometer model 300A (Molecular Dynamics). Gelatinase A, which had previously been activated by APMA (subsequently removed by spin column gel filtration), was added in varying amounts to incubations containing membrane preparation and 125I-labeled E375A progelatinase A for 20 h at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by adding nonreducing sample buffer, and the samples were analyzed by gelatin zymography followed by autoradiography. Similar experiments were performed using collagenase, preactivated with trypsin (10 μg/ml, 30 min, 37°C followed by a 10-fold excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor), instead of activated gelatinase. Apparent molecular masses for the three species of gelatinase A identified in these experiments differed according to the method used to assess them. In this report, molecular masses for the proenzyme, intermediate, and fully active forms, as assessed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE/gelatin zymography followed by autoradiography, were 66, 62, and 59 kDa, respectively. Where SDS-PAGE with reducing conditions was used, i.e. Coomassie-stained gel scanning (Fig. 6), the respective molecular masses were 72, 68, and 66 kDa. Molecular masses reported by other workers (Strongin et al., 1993) referred to in the introduction and under “Discussion” are those assessed by gelatin zymography performed under different conditions and are described as 66, 64, and 62 kDa, respectively. Northern blot analysis of human skin fibroblast RNA (Fig. 1A) showed a low level of MT-MMP mRNA in unstimulated cells. The amount of mRNA was shown to increase in cells that had been exposed to ConA for 24 h. In both cases, a single band of MT-MMP mRNA was detected, consistent with the 4.5-kilobase transcript reported by Sato et al.(1994). MT-MMP protein was detected by Western blot analysis of isolated membrane preparations from both unstimulated and ConA-stimulated cells (Fig. 1B). A strongly reactive band at 63 kDa seen in membranes from stimulated fibroblasts (+), which corresponded to that reported by Sato et al.(1994), was also identified more weakly in the membrane preparations from unstimulated cells(-). These data clearly demonstrate that, like MT-MMP mRNA, expression of the protein is increased in fibroblasts exposed to ConA. Other weaker bands indicate reactions between the antibody and other components of the isolated membranes, which did not conform to the predicted molecular mass of MT-MMP and are not further characterized at this stage. MT-MMP induces activation of progelatinase A (72 kDa) by two steps (via a 68-kDa intermediate to a 66-kDa activated form, Sato et al. (1994)). To analyze the contribution of MT-MMP and gelatinase A activities in this process, MT-MMP was expressed in CHO cells by transient transfection of the expression plasmid. When 125I-labeled progelatinase A or 125I-labeled E375A mutant were incubated with the CHO cells transiently expressing MT-MMP, wild type progelatinase A (66 kDa, nonreducing SDS-PAGE) was partially processed via a 62-kDa intermediate form to the fully active 59-kDa species (Fig. 2, lane 4). E375A mutant, however, was processed only to the 62-kDa intermediate form (lane 3). Neither enzyme was processed by CHO cells transfected with vector alone (lanes 1 and 2). Partial processing of 125I-labeled E375A mutant to the 59-kDa form as well as the 62-kDa intermediate was observed when equimolar unlabeled wild type progelatinase A was included in the MT-MMP-transfected CHO cultures together with the inactive mutant gelatinase (lane 5), but not if both enzymes were incubated with vector control CHO cells (lane 6). Both 125I-labeled wild type progelatinase A and 125I-labeled E375A mutant (66 kDa, nonreducing SDS-PAGE) were partially processed via a 62-kDa intermediate form to 59 kDa by incubation at 37°C for 24 h with fibroblasts prestimulated with ConA (Fig. 3A). Unstimulated cells were unable to process either progelatinase A or mutant during 24 h. Fig. 3B demonstrates that isolated membrane preparations from ConA-stimulated cells were also able to process the E375A mutant progelatinase in the same way as the cell monolayers and the wild type enzyme, although with less efficiency. Processing of the E375A mutant to the 59-kDa form by either cell monolayers or isolated cell membranes occurred more slowly than that of the wild type enzyme and, unlike the wild type progelatinase A, no gelatinolytic activity was observed by gelatin zymography corresponding to the processed form of the E375A mutant revealed by autoradiography. Processing of the wild type enzyme and E375A mutant by stimulated fibroblast monolayers was fully inhibited in a dose-responsive manner by the inclusion of human recombinant TIMP-2 in the cell cultures (Fig. 4, A and B). Processing of wild type 125I-labeled progelatinase A was more complete than that of 125I-labeled E375A in the absence of TIMP-2 (Fig. 4A, lane 6; Fig. 4B, lane 6), but the inhibitor was equally effective in blocking activation (Fig. 4A, lanes 9 and 10; Fig. 4B, lanes 9 and 10). TIMP-1 was a much less effective inhibitor, and, at the highest doses, the intermediate form (62 kDa) was more evident (Fig. 4C, lanes 10-12; Fig. 4D, lanes 10-12). A similar inhibitory pattern was seen when isolated cell membranes were incubated with either enzyme and TIMP-1 or TIMP-2 (data not shown). Other classes of inhibitors including pepstatin, aprotinin, E64, and α2-antiplasmin were unable to inhibit processing by cell monolayers or isolated membranes (data not shown). MMP inhibitors also inhibited processing of progelatinase A by MT-MMP-transfected CHO cells in a manner similar to the inhibition of membrane-induced activation (data not shown). TIMP-2 was again a more effective inhibitor than TIMP-1, with a similar build up of the intermediate species (62 kDa) at higher TIMP-1 concentrations, but never complete inhibition like that seen with TIMP-2. E375A progelatinase A and wild type progelatinase A (2 μM) were incubated with active gelatinase A at 37°C for up to 24 h at molar ratios of 1:0.01, 1:0.1, or 1:1, and the extent of proenzyme processing was assessed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5). At equimolar concentrations, the major product of processing of both the wild type enzyme and the E375A gelatinase was a 66-kDa form (reducing SDS-PAGE) identical with APMA-activated gelatinase A (results not shown). Lower molecular mass products also became visible with time, suggesting that the 66-kDa form is itself susceptible to further degradation (data not shown). At these high concentrations of progelatinase A, no propeptide intermediates (between 72 kDa and 66 kDa) were detectable, suggesting that the intermediate cleavage products of the propeptide seen with APMA and cell membrane processing are extremely transient. At higher concentrations of proenzyme compared to active enzyme, mutant processing became far less efficient and was negligible at a molar ratio of 1:0.01. The wild type enzyme, in comparison, was still slowly but efficiently processed, due to the production of active enzyme that was able to participate in the reaction. Active gelatinase A enhanced processing of 125I-labeled E375A (14 nM) by ConA-stimulated membrane preparations in a dose-responsive manner (Fig. 6). Enhancement was first observed at a molar ratio of 0.1 active enzyme (lane 3). At equimolar concentrations, approximately 50% of the proform of 125I-labeled E375A was completely converted to the 59-kDa form (lane 4). In the absence of any membrane preparation, equimolar active gelatinase A also brought about a low level of processing of 125I-labeled E375A (lane 2), although no processing was observed at lower concentrations (lane 1). Progelatinase A was also able to enhance processing in the presence of the membrane preparation (lane 5) but with progelatinase A alone, at equimolar concentrations, no processing of 125I-labeled E375A took place (lane 6). When the experiment was performed using trypsin-activated collagenase (MMP-1) instead of gelatinase A, no enhancement of processing was observed (data not shown). The activation of progelatinase A by a membrane-mediated process was studied using ConA-stimulated skin fibroblasts, a model system that we described previously in our attempts to elucidate the mechanism of activation of this pro-MMP (Ward et al., 1991, 1994; Murphy et al., 1992). The recent cloning of a putative membrane-bound metalloproteinase, MT-MMP, from a tumor library, and the demonstration of the ability of the recombinant protein to process progelatinase A (Takino et al., 1995; Sato et al., 1994), was of extreme relevance to the question of the number of potential gelatinase A activation mechanisms in our model system and in vivo. In this study we have shown that MT-MMP mRNA and protein are expressed at low levels in normal skin fibroblasts but that the levels are considerably up-regulated upon treatment with ConA. We chose gelatin zymography followed by autoradiography to study the fate of a 125I-labeled inactive mutant (E375A progelatinase A (Crabbe et al., 1994c)) or 125I-labeled wild type progelatinase A when incubated in cell cultures or with isolated membranes. Gelatin zymography was performed so that gelatin degrading activities could be identified, and autoradiography of the zymograms was chosen in preference to silver- or Coomassie-stained gels since it allowed us to detect the relatively low levels of enzyme remaining in the cell supernatants. For these reasons, the separation of the three species of gelatinase is less clear than it might have been using different techniques. Where there is rapid processing to the final (59-kDa) species, the intermediate (62-kDa) form is only very transiently present. The intermediate is, however, more evident in those situations where the processing is slowed either by lack of sufficient active gelatinase (membrane processing of E375A mutant) or where active gelatinase or MT-MMP activity is inhibited (TIMP-1). CHO cells transiently expressing MT-MMP were shown to process wild type progelatinase A to the fully active species, but could only process the inactive mutant to an intermediate form. Monolayers of ConA-stimulated fibroblasts, or membrane preparations derived from them, were, however, able to process not only wild type progelatinase A but also the E375A mutant to a 59-kDa (nonreducing gel) form, via a 62-kDa intermediate. We were unable to prepare sufficient processed material for N-terminal sequencing and to determine the precise cleavage sites, but the electrophoretic mobility of the intermediate and final forms of the wild type and mutant gelatinases appear identical. We have also shown that the E375A mutant, which cannot naturally self-process like the wild type proenzyme in the presence of an organomercurial, can be processed efficiently at high concentrations in the presence of a high molar ratio of active gelatinase A. This is in agreement with our previous data that a truncated mutant of gelatinase A could effect the same propeptide processing of the E375A mutant as can be seen for the wild type gelatinase (Crabbe et al., 1994c). Our studies of proenzyme processing by gelatinase A (Fig. 5) measured the amount of proenzyme remaining by scanning Coomassie-stained gels. This method provided a better estimate of progelatinase “activation” in this experimental system than attempts to quantitate the amount of fully processed (66-kDa reducing SDS-PAGE) enzyme for two reasons. Firstly, the experiment adds increasing amounts of previously activated 66-kDa gelatinase A to the system. This could be circumvented by using 125I-labeled gelatinase, but, for quantitation experiments, autoradiography is less accurate than scanning of Coomassie-stained protein bands. Secondly, the 66-kDa form is itself constantly subject to further degradation at 37°C at a rate that is in part determined by the concentration of 66-kDa gelatinase A (Crabbe et al., 1993). The experiments show that the rate of proenzyme loss is not only governed by the amount of active enzyme added to the incubation but by the potential for the generation of further active enzyme; thus, the processing of wild type proenzyme at low initial values of added active enzyme accelerates with time, while the mutant processing rate cannot be modified. These observations suggest that the processing is by intermolecular reactions. To investigate the role of endogenous membrane-associated gelatinase A in the processing of the E375A mutant by ConA-stimulated fibroblasts, we took a number of approaches. Initially, we confirmed that the processing was likely to be due to the action of an MMP by demonstrating that the TIMPs were effective inhibitors of processing. As previously noted (Ward et al., 1991), TIMP-2 was a more efficient inhibitor of processing than TIMP-1. This phenomenon was also observed in the inhibition of progelatinase A processing by CHO cells transfected with MT-MMP and has been reported by others (Strongin et al., 1993). It is thought to be due to tighter C-terminal domain interactions of the proenzyme with TIMP-2 (Willenbrock et al., 1993). We therefore proposed this also to be indicative of the necessity for progelatinase to bind to the cell membrane through the C-terminal domain for activation to occur. Such binding and activation can be blocked by TIMP-2, and the isolated C-terminal domain of gelatinase (Murphy et al., 1992; Strongin et al., 1993; Ward et al., 1994). We conclude that TIMP-2 is a more efficient inhibitor of E375A mutant membrane processing for the same reason. We had noted that the preparation of membrane fractions from ConA-stimulated fibroblasts reduced both the amount of endogenous gelatinase A associated with the system and the ability of the fibroblast membranes to process progelatinases. However, we were unable to reduce further the gelatinase A content of cell membranes using solvents, acid pH etc. (data not shown). The addition of small amounts of activated gelatinase A to the system caused a dose-responsive restoration of the ability to process both the wild type and mutant progelatinases. In processing studies in the absence of membranes, high concentrations of proenzymes and high molar ratios of the active form were shown to be required for this phenomenon to occur (this paper and Crabbe et al., 1993, 1994a). In the presence of membranes, processing can occur at relatively low concentrations (150-fold less) of the reactants. Crabbe et al.(1993) and Ward et al.(1994) have proposed that the binding of gelatinases to the cell membrane may increase its localized concentration such that an intermolecular processing reaction is promoted. We therefore conclude that membrane-associated gelatinase A is involved in the activation of its proform. The differences in the rates of wild type and mutant proenzyme processing by active gelatinase A observed in the absence of cell membranes can be extrapolated to the results obtained in their presence. Thus, because the rate of wild type processing using membranes is only slightly faster than that of the mutant, the amount of active gelatinase A endogenously present on the cell surface of ConA-stimulated fibroblasts is likely to be approximately equal to the amount of bound proenzyme. Until MT-MMP has been rigorously characterized, we are not able to assess its importance as a progelatinase processing enzyme relative to active gelatinase. By analogy with other MMP activation cascades, it is extremely likely that MT-MMP and active gelatinase A will act in concert in the cleavage of the propeptide of progelatinase A. There are numerous examples of this, such as the case of plasmin activation of stromelysin-1, where the final propeptide cleavage is autocatalytic (Nagase et al., 1990) and in the collagenase processing of gelatinase A (Crabbe et al., 1994b). Our results do not rule out the possibility that ConA induces another as yet unidentified membrane component to which progelatinase A can bind such that it becomes concentrated on the cell surface allowing intermolecular cleavage to take place. Thus, the up-regulation of MT-MMP in ConA-stimulated fibroblasts could be entirely coincidental. However, the recent availability of the isolated catalytic domain of MT-MMP has enabled us to demonstrate conclusively that the inactive mutant E375A progelatinase A is cleaved only to the intermediate species by MT-MMP in the absence of catalytically active enzyme, but can be fully processed by the inclusion of wild type progelatinase A in the incubation mixture. 2H. Will and G. Murphy, unpublished data. Preliminary immunohistochemical studies using specific antibodies to MT-MMP and gelatinase A show that CHO cells transfected with MT-MMP bind exogenous progelatinase A on the cell surface whereas vector control cells do not. Confocal microscopy and double labeling techniques have demonstrated that the bound gelatinase has the same distribution as MT-MMP. 3S. Atkinson and R. Hembry, unpublished data. The availability of the E375A mutant which cannot self-process should prove invaluable in the further unravelling of the question of the role of different MMPs in membrane processing of progelatinase A. While this manuscript was in preparation, Strongin et al. (1995) reported a role for TIMP-2 in the phorbol ester-induced activation of progelatinase A by HT1080 cells. These workers demonstrated that MT-MMP acts as a receptor for TIMP-2, forming a complex capable of binding progelatinase A on the cell surface that leads to its activation. Our studies using specific antisera to gelatinase A, TIMP-2, and MT-MMP and confocal microscopy indicate that in some activating cells, all three are located together on the cell surface.3 Levels of TIMP-2 are critical, therefore, in determining the activation status of gelatinase A in the extracellular environment, since we have clearly shown that excess TIMP-2 completely inhibits the activation of progelatinase A by ConA-stimulated fibroblasts. Further work will be required to understand the nature of the binding of the three components that leads to activation of progelatinase A without its inhibition. We thank Dr. K.

To this end, mice carrying a null mutation in the GK gene in pancreatic β-cells, but not in the liver, were generated by homologous recombination. Heterozygous mutant mice showed early-onset mild diabetes resembling the phenotype for human maturity-onset diabetes of the young. Homozygotes showed severe diabetes shortly after birth and died within a week. GK-deficient islets showed defective insulin secretion in response to glucose, while they responded to other secretagogues: almost normally to arginine and to some extent to sulfonylureas. These data provide the first direct proof that GK serves as a glucose sensor molecule for insulin secretion and plays a pivotal role in glucose homeostasis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning of the Mouse GK Gene, Construction of a Targeting Vector, and Homologous Recombinant ExperimentsA DNA fragment including the pancreatic β-cell-specific exon 1β of the GK gene was cloned from a BALB/c mouse genomic library (Clontech). A BamHI site was introduced 30 base pairs 3′ to the translation initiation codon of GK by the Kunkel method(10.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

A neomycin resistance gene (neor) with a pgk-1 promoter but without a poly(A)+ addition signal was substituted for the XbaI-BamHI fragment in the exon 1β. A diphtheria toxin A fragment gene (DTA) with a MC1 promoter was ligated on the 3′ terminus across the vector backbone, for negative selection(11.Yagi T. Aizawa S. Tokunaga T. Shigetani Y. Takeda N.

Maki T. Kiyoizumi T. Satomi S. Monaco A.P. Transplantation. 1985; 40: 437-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Glucose phosphorylating activities by hexokinase (HK) and GK were determined fluorometrically (18.Miwa, I., Mita, Y., Murata, T., Okuda, J., Sugiura, M., Hamada, Y., Chiba, T. (1995) Enzyme & Protein, in pressGoogle Scholar) except that GK activity was measured at 50 mM glucose.Glucose Tolerance TestMice (10 weeks old) were fasted for more than 16 h before the study. They were then loaded with 1.5 mg g−1−1 (body weight) glucose by intraperitoneal infusion. Blood samples were taken at different time points from the orbital sinus. Insulin levels were determined using an insulin radioimmunoassay kit (Shionogi) with rat insulin as standard.ImmunohistochemistryPancreata were immersion-fixed in 4.0% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer at 4°C overnight. Diluted guinea pig anti-porcine insulin (DAKO, A564) (1:200), or rabbit anti-porcine glucagon (DAKO, A565) (1:200), or rabbit anti-human somatostatin (DAKO, A566) (1:200) was applied to the sections for 45 min at room temperature. The sections were then rinsed with Tris-buffered saline, and then treated with a second antibody.Insulin Content AssayIsolated islets were suspended in 100 μl of acid ethanol, and cellular insulin was extracted, diluted (100 times), and assayed by radioimmunoassay.Determination of Intracellular Calcium ConcentrationIsolated islets were incubated overnight with RPMI 1640 medium and measurements of intracellular calcium concentration were carried out using fura-2 acetoxymethylester (Molecular Probes) (19.Grynkiewicz G.

Diabetes. 1995; 44: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Batch Incubation StudyBatches of 10 islets were preincubated for 60 min at 37°C in 5% CO2 in 1 ml of Hank's-buffered saline containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 (Hanks'-BSA buffer) plus 0.1 mM glucose. The medium was then replaced with 1 ml of Hanks'-BSA buffer supplemented with secretagogues. After a 60-min incubation at 37°C, the medium was removed for radioimmunoassay of insulin (Shionogi).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTargeted Disruption of Glucokinase Gene in Pancreatic β-CellsAlternative splicing of a single GK gene gives rise to two isoforms of GK, one expressed in the pancreatic β-cells and the other in liver, which have different first exons (exon 1β and exon 1L, respectively) (Fig. 1A)(9.Magnuson M.A. Shelton K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15936-15942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two isoforms are transcribed by two different promoters, and the downstream promoter, which lies between exon 1β and 1L, drives transcription of the liver GK isoform. We were therefore able to disrupt exon 1β expression and thereby selectively eliminate expression of the pancreatic β-cell isoform of GK without affecting expression of the liver isoform. Eight independent ES cell clones were identified as carrying the targeted mutant GK allele (Fig. 1B). Male chimeras originated from two homologous recombinant clones transmitted the mutant GK allele to their offspring. Heterozygous mutant mice were apparently normal and gave birth to mice homozygous for the mutant GK allele. The ratio of wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous mice was 80:170:85 in 335 offsprings at 3-4 days of age, which was consistent with Mendelian inheritance (Fig. 1B). Reverse-transcriptase PCR analysis revealed that GK expression in pancreatic β-islets was completely absent in homozygotes (data not shown). In islets from homozygous neonates, GK activity was completely absent, whereas HK activity was similar to that from wild-type neonates (Fig. 1C). In islets from adult heterozygotes, GK activity (Vmax) was 48% of that from the wild-type mice. In contrast to the β-cell, both GK and HK activities in the liver were unaltered in each genotype (data not shown).Mild Diabetes in Heterozygous GK Knock-out MiceAt birth, the blood glucose levels of heterozygous and wild-type mice were 2.5 ± 0.3 (n = 5), and 2.4 ± 0.1 (n = 4) mM, respectively. However, about 50% of the heterozygous mice showed mild glycosuria within a day, suggesting the development of early-onset diabetes mellitus. Heterozygous mice (10 weeks old) showed significantly higher blood glucose levels both before and after a glucose load and smaller increments in serum insulin levels than wild-type mice (Fig. 2). Insulin tolerance test revealed that the heterozygous mutant mice were as sensitive to insulin as the wild-type (data not shown). These results demonstrate that a heterozygous mutation of the GK gene in the pancreatic β-cells is sufficient to cause impaired insulin secretion to glucose and diabetes mellitus. In this respect, Efrat et al.(21.Efrat S. Leiser M. Wu Y. Fusco-DeMane D. Emran O. Surana M. Jetton T.L. Magnuson M.A. Weir G. Fleischer N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2051-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) have generated mice in which pancreatic GK expression was attenuated by a ribozyme-mediated method. Although GK activity of these mice was only 30% that of normal and they showed an impaired insulin response to glucose in perfused pancreas experiments, the fasting and postprandial glucose levels remained normal. It is possible that the different strategies used to attenuate GK expression or the different strains of mice used (Efrat et al. used C3H, whereas this report used ICR) may explain the apparent discrepancy between their and our results.Fig. 2Mild diabetes in heterozygous GK knock-out mice. Results of a glucose tolerance test are shown. Wild-type (open circles) and heterozygous mice (open triangles) were loaded with 1.5 mg g (body weight) glucose, and blood glucose (upper panel) and serum insulin (lower panel) levels were determined at the indicated time points. The data points indicate mean ± S.E.

Their blood glucose level was 2.7 ± 0.1 mM (n = 4), which was indistinguishable from that of wild-type mice (2.4 ± 0.1 mM, n = 4). Although they were able to suck as evidenced by the presence of milk in their stomachs, they showed no increase in body weight with age (Fig. 3A). They also showed marked glycosuria within a day, and almost all animals died within 7 days of birth apparently due to dehydration. At 3-4 days of age, their blood glucose levels were markedly higher than those of wild-type or heterozygous animals, while serum insulin levels were low relative to the elevated blood glucose concentrations, suggesting the presence of relative insulin deficiency (Fig. 3B). Only 20% of homozygotes showed ketosis in spite of marked hyperglycemia. These suggest that basal insulin secretion is preserved in homozygotes presumably due to activity of the β-cell HK. Thus, diabetes mellitus in the GK-deficient mice, although severe, is more similar to NIDDM rather than insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Post-mortem investigation revealed no gross abnormalities in any of the organs examined except for occasional fatty changes of the liver in homozygous mutants (data not shown).Fig. 3Characterization of homozygous GK knock-out mice. A, changes in body weight of neonates. The genotype of the neonates was determined by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1B).

Both of these treatments significantly lowered blood glucose levels (by 20-40%) and caused a gain in body weight (to approximately 80% of the wild-type littermate). Since GK is also expressed in rare neuroendocrine cells in the brain and gut(22.Jetton T.L. Liang Y. Pethepher C.C. Zimmerman E.C. Cox F.G. Horvath K. Matschinsky F.M. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3641-3654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that the absence of glucose sensing in the brain or gut by GK may have modulated the phenotype of homozygous mutant pups. Nevertheless, it seems likely that hyperglycemia due to a lack of β-cell GK is the major cause of severe metabolic failure and early death in several days, since insulin or sulfonylurea improved these features. Immunostaining for glucagon, insulin, and somatostatin revealed that differentiation into pancreatic α, β, and δ cells also appeared to be unaffected (Fig. 4). Although there may be subtle changes in the architecture of α, β, and δ cells in the islets, its gross appearance was normal. The insulin contents of the wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous GK-deficient islets were 1.7 ± 0.3 (n = 5), 2.2 ± 0.7 (n = 6), and 2.5 ± 0.2 (n = 10) ng of insulin/islet, respectively. These data indicate that β-cell GK is not essential for normal development, differentiation of endocrine pancreas, or insulin biosynthesis.Fig. 4Immunohistochemistry of GK-deficient islets. Islets were stained for insulin (a and d), glucagon (b and e), or somatostatin (c and f). a-c are the same section of an islet from a wild-type mouse, while d-f are the same section of an islet from a homozygous mutant mouse.

A rise in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in the β-cell ([Ca2+]i) is a key event in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion(19.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 20.Weinhaus A.J. Poronnik P. Cook D.I. Tuch B.E. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although all the GK-deficient islets looked alike under microscopy, they could be subdivided into two groups in terms of basal [Ca2+]i levels; those with normal calcium levels (110 ± 34 nM, n = 7; about 20% of the islets), and those with higher basal calcium levels (higher than 200 nM; about 80%) which might reflect some damage of the islets. In the former group, the increase in [Ca2+]i elicited by glucose was completely abolished, while the increase evoked by glibenclamide or arginine was essentially normal (Fig. 5A). However, in islets with higher basal calcium levels, the increase in [Ca2+]i elicited not only by glucose but also by glibenclamide was completely abolished and that by arginine modestly impaired (data not shown). The observed heterogeneity of GK-deficient islets may be due to a direct effect of the impaired glucose metabolism in GK-deficient islets or may be a consequence of the hyperglycemia and other metabolic defects. Even in wild-type or heterozygous GK-deficient islets, there were islets with higher basal calcium levels (more than 200 nM), but its proportion was less than 10%.Fig. 5Characterization of GK-deficient islets. A, increase in intracellular calcium concentration of islets elicited by 20 mM glucose, 10 μM glibenclamide, or 20 mM arginine. Basal calcium levels in the wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous islets are 78 ± 15, 116 ± 30, and 110 ± 34 nM, respectively. Values are expressed in nM, as mean ± S.E. (n = 4-7).

Insulin secretion in response to 3 or 10 mM glucose from null islets was not determined. ∗∗, p < 0.01; ∗, p < 0.05 compared with the wild-type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next examined insulin secretion using the batch incubation method (Fig. 5B). Insulin secretion from heterozygous GK-deficient islets in response to 0.1 mM or 3 mM glucose was normal, but that in response to 10 mM glucose was significantly impaired compared with wild-type islets. Impairment in insulin secretion in response to 20 mM glucose was less evident. On the other hand, insulin secretion in response to glibenclamide or arginine was unaffected. In homozygous GK-deficient islets, although there was some basal insulin secretion at 0.1 mM glucose, presumably due to the activity of HK, increase in insulin secretion in response to 20 mM glucose was completely abolished. In contrast, insulin secretion in response to arginine was essentially preserved. Regarding insulin secretion in response to glibenclamide, it was decreased by about 50-80% depending on the method of estimation (Fig. 5B). Nevertheless, since the islets used here were supposed to be a mixture of those with normal and those with higher basal calcium levels (expected to be 20% and 80% of the population, respectively), which were responsive and unresponsive to glibenclamide in calcium study, we interpreted these results as suggesting that islets with normal basal calcium levels may have responded to sulfonylurea in insulin secretion.The insulin secretory response to a physiological increment in glucose concentration was impaired in heterozygous GK-deficient islets and completely defective in homozygous GK-deficient islets despite the presence of HK, supporting the concept that GK serves as a glucose sensor molecule for insulin secretion. This is consistent with the smaller increments in serum insulin levels after a glucose load in heterozygous mice (Fig. 2), lack of increments in insulin levels in homozygous mice in spite of hyperglycemia (Fig. 3B), and the secretory abnormalities in human subjects with GK mutations(23.Byrne M.M. Sturis J. Clement K. Vionnet N. Pueyo M.E. Stoffel M. Takeda J. Passa P. Cohen D. Bell G.I. Velho G. Froguel P. Polonsky K.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1120-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). GK-deficient islets responded to non-glucose secretagogues in insulin secretion (almost normally to arginine and to some extent to sulfonylureas), indicating that GK is not absolutely required for insulin secretion in response to these secretagogues. It should also be noted that insulin secretion in response to glibenclamide was impaired, suggesting that GK may play an important role in insulin secretion in response to some of non-glucose secretagogues such as glibenclamide. This possibility would be examined in future. The heterozygous or insulin-treated homozygous mutant mice described here provide the first animal model of diabetes with a defined genetic defect in insulin secretion, and should give important insights into the pathogenesis and development of human NIDDM.

The exonuclease was later found to be much more active on a nicked compared with a gapped double-stranded DNA substrate (Murante et al., 1994). This suggests that stimulation of nuclease activity by DNA synthesis resulted from continuous generation of the favored substrate.The calf 5′ to 3′ exonuclease has been implicated in processing of Okazaki fragments (Turchi et al., 1994). A DNA template, primed with an oligoribonucleotide that had been extended at the 3′ end with DNA, was used as a model Okazaki fragment. Calf RNase H1 removed the initiator RNA with a single cut at the 5′ side of the ribonucleotide at the RNA-DNA junction. The 5′ to 3′ exonuclease then could remove the remaining ribonucleotide, creating a 5′ DNA. Extension of an upstream primer by polymerization in the presence of DNA ligase I allowed the two primers to be joined, as expected on the lagging replication fork strand in vivo.In addition to the above activities, the 5′ to 3′ exonuclease could also cleave endonucleolytically (Murante et al., 1994). The substrate for this reaction was a DNA primer-template, having a downstream primer with a noncomplementary, unannealed region at the 5′ end. Additionally, an upstream primer was annealed directly adjacent to the first annealed nucleotide of the downstream primer. Endonucleolytic cleavage removed the unannealed region as an intact segment. Cleavage occurred either at the point of annealing to make a nicked substrate or one nucleotide downstream to make a 1-nucleotide gap. The 5′ to 3′ exonuclease domains of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and Thermus aquaticus (Taq) DNA polymerase (Lyamichev et al., 1993) are functionally homologous to the calf nuclease. The homologous nuclease has also been purified from murine cells and designated cca nuclease (Goulian et al., 1990) and flap endonuclease (FEN-1) (Harrington and Lieber, 1994). The corresponding HeLa cell nuclease has been purified (Ishimi et al., 1988; Waga et al., 1994; Robins et al., 1994; Murray et al., 1994), and called maturation factor I (Waga et al., 1994) and DNase IV (Robins et al., 1994). The homolog of this mammalian protein has been identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and named the RTH-1 nuclease (Sommers et al., 1995; Johnson et al., 1995). Knockout mutants are temperature-sensitive for DNA replication and repair of methylmethane sulfonate lesions (Sommers et al., 1995). RTH-1 nuclease was also found to be necessary for the stability of DNA repeats in yeast, suggesting that mutation of the human counterpart could impair the mismatch repair pathway that protects from colorectal cancer (Johnson et al., 1995).In this report, we explore the substrate structure requirements for endonuclease activity of the calf nuclease. We show that the nuclease must slide over the 5′ end of the unannealed tail of the primer and then along the single-stranded tail to the point of cleavage. The sliding action is bidirectional. The presence of a primer or protein on the tail prevents entry of the nuclease or traps a nuclease that is already on the tail. Cleavage is observed on tails with covalent adducts on nucleotides either at the 5′ end or within the tail. A model is proposed that has implications for the biological role of this unusual nuclease.DISCUSSIONThe calf 5′ to 3′ exo/endonuclease is a member of the RTH-1 class of eukaryotic nucleases that perform structure-specific cleavage of DNA and have important roles in DNA replication and repair. The substrate for endonuclease activity is a primer-template in which the primer has a noncomplementary, unannealed 5′ end region. Here we show that in order to catalyze cleavage, the nuclease must slide over the 5′ end of the unannealed tail, move down the length of the tail to the point of annealing with the template, and then carry out cleavage. The sliding process is bidirectional, such that nucleases can also slide off of the tail at the 5′ end. Evidence is also presented that the nuclease binds with highest stability to the point of cleavage. The presence of biotin adducts on the tail do not affect either recognition of the 5′ end or the sliding process. However, protein bound to the tail, either SSB or streptavidin, has an inhibitory effect on cleavage, presumably by blocking the movement of the nuclease to the site of cleavage. The steps taken by the nuclease to carry out this process are depicted in Fig. 8.Biochemical and genetic evidence suggests that nucleases of this class are components of the DNA replication machinery. Studies of simian virus 40 DNA replication in vitro indicated the requirement of the human 5′ to 3′ exo/endonuclease in the removal of the RNA primer before joining of viral lagging strand DNA segments (Ishimi et al., 1988; Waga et al., 1994). The mouse nuclease was able to partially remove RNA from initiator RNA primers made and elongated with DNA by DNA polymerase α in vitro (Goulian et al., 1990). Using a model Okazaki fragment substrate consisting of an initiator RNA elongated by DNA and annealed to a template, we showed that two nucleases can effect complete RNA removal (Turchi et al., 1994). Mammalian RNase HI cleaves off the initiator RNA as an intact segment, leaving only a single ribonucleotide at the RNA-DNA junction (Turchi et al., 1994; Huang et al., 1994). The 5′ to 3′ exo/endonuclease can then remove the last ribonucleotide. Null mutants of the counterpart nuclease in S. cerevisiae, the RTH-1 nuclease, are temperature-sensitive for DNA replication (Sommers et al., 1995). The appearance of dumbbell-shaped cells with a nucleus at the isthmus as the terminal phenotype is characteristic of mutations in DNA polymerases δ and ε(reviewed in Bambara and Huang(1995)). The RTH-1 mutation causes hyper-recombination, symptomatic of the presence of long-lived breaks in the chromosome (Sommers et al., 1995). These would be expected if joining of Okazaki fragments was delayed by the mutation.The sensitivity of the RTH-1 mutants to damage by the agent methylmethane sulfonate (Sommers et al., 1995), which adducts to bases, suggests that the RTH-1 class of nucleases participate in repair of base damage. The demonstration that null mutants in RTH-1 increase the instability of simple repetitive DNA indicates a role for this nuclease in the mismatch repair pathway (Johnson et al., 1995). Our results show that biotinylation of nucleotides on a tail do not inhibit the movement of the nuclease to its site of cleavage. This suggests that in vivo the nuclease can traverse an unannealed, damaged segment of DNA and cut it away from the chromosome. Because the nuclease does not have to cut at the damaged nucleotide to accomplish this process, it should be able to remove even modified nucleotides that would not be substrates for cleavage attempted at the modified site.Our results show that the nuclease cannot enter the tail strand except at the 5′ end. Because the RTH-1 class nucleases are expected to be present at the replication fork, this property would be expected to protect the lagging strand template from unintentional cleavage. There is a risk of such cleavage because the extension of the leading strand primer continuously generates a structure with most of the characteristics of the substrate for RTH-1 endonuclease activity, at the point where the parental strands separate. In this structure, the lagging strand template would be the equivalent of the single-stranded tail in our model substrates, except that the lagging strand template does not have a nearby 5′ end. The absence of this single feature prevents endonucleolytic cleavage.Properties of the calf 5′ to 3′ exo/endonuclease suggest another means by which it can participate in the removal of the initiator RNA segments of Okazaki fragments. It could remove this RNA by endonucleolytic cleavage of the Okazaki fragment in the region of DNA just downstream of the initiator RNA. DNA polymerase εhas been proposed to be responsible for completion of the extension of Okazaki fragments in vivo (reviewed in Bambara and Huang(1995)). This polymerase partially copurifies with DNA helicase E (Siegal et al., 1992). The Ku autoantigen is also a helicase that copurifies with human DNA polymerase ε(Hwang et al., 1995), suggesting that helicase E is the calf Ku protein. Helicase E moves in a 3′ to 5′ direction on the template and so can displace primers ahead of the advancing polymerase. It is possible that the polymerase, helicase, and RTH-1 class nuclease collaborate in a pathway for removal of initiator RNAs of Okazaki fragments.In summary, the calf 5′ to 3′ exo/endonuclease can cleave off the 5′ unannealed tail of a primer annealed to a template by cutting near the point of complementarity and releasing the tail as an intact segment. Here we show that to catalyze this reaction, the nuclease must enter the tail at the 5′ end and slide to the point of cleavage. This unique mechanism of action is consistent with a proposed role for the nuclease in removal of the initiator primers from Okazaki fragments during DNA replication and in cleaving off segments of damaged DNA during DNA repair. The yeast counterpart nuclease RTH-1 has been shown to be necessary to maintain stability of repetitive DNA and apparently is involved in the MSH2-MLH1-PMS1 mismatch repair pathway (Johnson et al., 1995). Mutations in the mammalian mismatch repair pathway are associated with colorectal cancers (Reenan and Kolodner, 1992; Prolla et al., 1994). This suggests that the human RTH-1 counterpart applies its unique cleavage specificity for repair surveillance that prevents colorectal cancer.

Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2351-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). The switch I overlaps with the “effector domain” (Tyr32-Tyr40) identified by mutational studies as a region essential for effector activation but not for GTPase activity and membrane localization, and is thought to mediate GTP-dependent interaction with effectors(4.Sigal I.S.

However, residues (Asn26, Tyr40, Val45, and Gly48) flanking the switch I have also been shown to be critical for effector activation(6.Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Shirouzu M. Koide H. Nishimura S.

Sci. 1993; 18: 250-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar)). Additional residues (Lys42, Ile46, and Glu49) belonging to this domain have been identified recently by Fujita-Yoshigaki et al.(11.Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Shirouzu M. Ito Y. Hattori S. Furuyama S. Nishimura S. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4661-4667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The activator domain is also exposed on the surface of Ha-Ras but its conformation is not much altered by GDP/GTP exchange(10.Marshall M.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 250-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 11.Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Shirouzu M. Ito Y. Hattori S. Furuyama S. Nishimura S. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4661-4667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, post-translational modifications of Ha-Ras have also been shown to be crucial for its biological function (for a review, see (12.Marshall C.J. Science. 1993; 259: 1865-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar)). However, it is presently unclear how these individual structural features are involved in effector activation. Raf-1, a 74-kDa cytoplasmic serine/threonine protein kinase regulating the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, is one of the major effectors of Ha-Ras (for a review, see (13.Daum G. Eisenmann-Tappe I. Fries H.-W. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 474-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar)). Raf-1 shares three regions of conservation, termed CR1, 1The abbreviations used are: CRconserved regionRBDRas-binding domainCRRcysteine-rich regionMBPmaltose-binding proteinGTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)GSTglutathione S-transferaseMEKmitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/ERK kinaseERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseKNERKkinase-negative mutant of ERK2.

Sci. 1994; 19: 474-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). CR1 and CR2 are located in the N-terminal half of Raf-1, and CR3 corresponds to the C-terminal kinase domain. Activation of Raf-1 by N-terminal truncations indicates that the N-terminal portion plays an important regulatory role(14.Stanton Jr., V.P. Nichols D.W. Laudano A.P. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The minimal region of Raf-1 responsible for the interaction with Ha-Ras has been mapped into 81 amino acids in CR1, RBD (amino acids 51-131)(15.Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar), and mutational analyses have suggested that RBD interacts directly with the switch I of Ha-Ras(16.Chuang E.

However, a mutation (C168S) located in another region of CR1, CRR (amino acids 152-184), has been shown to impair physical interaction of Raf-1 with Ha-Ras and to render Raf-1 unresponsive to Ha-Ras(20.Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 21.Zhang X.-F. Settleman J. Kyriakis J.M. Takeuchi-Suzuki E. Elledge S.J. Marshall M.S. Bruder J.T.

These observations indicate that not only RBD but also CRR is critical for Ras-dependent activation of Raf-1. However, the exact mechanism of involvement of Raf-1 CRR in Ras-dependent activation remains to be determined. Here we report that CRR interacts with Ha-Ras independently of RBD and that the activator domain of Ha-Ras is critical not only for this interaction but also for the Ha-Ras-dependent activation of Raf-1. These results suggest that CRR participates in Raf-1 activation through interaction with the activator domain of Ha-Ras. Evidence is also presented that post-translational modifications of Ha-Ras C terminus are necessary for this interaction. conserved region Ras-binding domain cysteine-rich region maltose-binding protein guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) glutathione S-transferase mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/ERK kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase-negative mutant of ERK2.

They were cloned into pMal vectors for expression as fusions with MBP in Escherichia coli(24.Minato T. Wang J. Akasaka K. Okada T. Suzuki N Kataoka T J. Biol.

R89L and C168S substitution mutations were introduced into Raf-1(50-131) and Raf-1(132-206), respectively, by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (25.Kramer W. Fritz H.-J.

The resulting DNA fragments Raf-1(50-131, R89L) and Raf-1(132-206, C168S) were cloned into pMal for expression as MBP fusions in E. coli.

Amino acid substitution mutations were introduced into the synthetic human Ha-ras cDNA encoding the Ha-Ras protein bearing the oncogenic valine for glycine substitution mutation at position 12 (Ha-RasV12) as described previously(6.Fujita-Yoshigaki J.

Accuracy of the Ha-ras amplification was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. The post-translationally modified form of wild-type or mutant Ha-Ras proteins and unmodified form of wild-type Ha-Ras protein were purified from membrane and cytosolic fractions, respectively, of Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses expressing the respective proteins as described(24.Minato T.

The unmodified Ha-Ras is neither farnesylated nor further processed as shown previously(26.Horiuchi H. Kaibuchi K. Kawamura M. Matsuura Y. Suzuki N. Kuroda Y. Kataoka T. Takai Y. Mol. Cell.

MBP-Raf-1 fusion proteins in cell lysates were immobilized on amylose resin by incubation at 4°C for 2 h, followed by extensive washing with buffer A (20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 40 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.1% Lubrol PX). Binding reactions were carried out by incubating GTPγS- or GDP-bound Ha-Ras protein with 20 μl of the resin carrying immobilized MBP-Raf-1 proteins in a total volume of 100 μl of buffer A. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min and at 4°C for 2 h with continuous agitation, the resin was washed with 400 μl of buffer A. The bound proteins were subsequently eluted from the resin with 200 μl of buffer A containing 10 mM maltose and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by Western immunoblot detection with an anti-Ras monoclonal antibody Y13-259 (Oncogene Science Inc., New York). The assays were carried out similarly as described(28.Kikuchi A. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20054-20059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli expressing GST fusion protein of MEK1 (GST-MEK) or that of KNERK (GST-KNERK), and a recombinant baculovirus expressing the full-length human Raf-1 were obtained from Dr. A. Kikuchi (Hiroshima University School of Medicine, Hiroshima, Japan). Monolayers of Sf9 cells (2 × 107 cells) were coinfected with the recombinant baculovirus expressing the full-length Raf-1 and that expressing either Ha-RasV12V12 or one of its mutants (1 × 108 plaque-forming units each). After 72 h post-infection, the cells were lysed by sonication in 1 ml of buffer B (20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mM sodium vanadate) and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min. Raf-1 was immunoprecipitated from the supernatant (200 μl) with the anti-Raf-1 antibody C12 (2 μl) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) and protein A-agarose. The Raf-1 kinase activity was determined by incubating the immunoprecipitates in the absence or presence of GST-MEK (13 μg) and GST-KNERK (1 μg) in 30 μl of kinase reaction mixture (20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MnCl2, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate, and 50 μM [γ-32P]ATP (4000 cpm/pmol)) for 30 min at 25°C. After the incubation, proteins in the reaction mixture were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to autoradiography to detect phosphoproteins. First, we attempted to elucidate the role of CRR in the Ras-Raf interaction. We reasoned that if CRR is really important for the physical interaction between Ha-Ras and Raf-1, deletion of CRR should result in reduced Ras-Raf binding. To confirm this, we constructed serial C-terminal deletion mutants of Raf-1 CR1 (Fig. 1B), expressed them in E. coli as fusions with MBP, and performed an in vitro Ha-Ras-binding assay. Consistent with the idea, the amount of Ha-Ras bound to the immobilized MBP-Raf-1 mutants was considerably decreased with the deletion of CRR (Fig. 2A). Contribution of CRR to efficient Ras-Raf binding could be accounted for by either one of the two mechanisms: conformational stabilization of RBD by CRR or a physical interaction between CRR and Ha-Ras. Therefore, we examined the potential of CRR to interact with Ha-Ras independently of RBD. For this purpose, we prepared MBP-Raf-1(132-206), which included 20 amino acids each upstream and downstream of CRR for preservation of the functional CRR conformation, and MBP-Raf-1(50-131), which contained one extra amino acid at the N terminus of RBD. As shown in Fig. 2B, immobilized MBP-Raf-1(132-206) bound Ha-Ras•GTP, although the binding was weaker compared with MBP-Raf-1(50-131). However, with increasing concentration of Ha-Ras, the amount of Ha-Ras bound to MBP-Raf-1(132-206) increased and finally reached to a level comparable to that bound to MBP-Raf-1(50-131). This suggested that the observed weaker binding was ascribable to the lower affinity of CRR for Ha-Ras than that of RBD. Unexpectedly, MBP-Raf-1(132-206) also bound Ha-Ras•GDP almost equally. Parallel bindings of Ha-Ras•GTP and Ha-Ras•GDP were consistently observed with various amounts of Ha-Ras (Fig. 2B) or MBP-Raf-1(132-206) (data not shown). These results indicated that CRR could act as another Ras-binding domain in a GTP-independent manner. To test the specificity of the interactions of RBD and CRR with Ha-Ras, we introduced mutations R89L and C168S into RBD and CRR, respectively, since these mutations have been shown to cause impaired interaction of Raf-1 with Ha-Ras both in vitro and in vivo(17.Fabian J.R. Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5982-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 20.Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 21.Zhang X.-F. Settleman J. Kyriakis J.M. Takeuchi-Suzuki E. Elledge S.J. Marshall M.S. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1993; 364: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). We expressed these mutant proteins as fusions with MBP, and performed the in vitro binding assay (Fig. 2C). As expected, both MBP-Raf-1(50-131, R89L) and MBP-Raf-1(132-206, C168S) exhibited greatly reduced abilities to bind Ha-Ras. Based on these observations, we concluded that Raf-1 CR1 contains two distinct Ras-binding domains, RBD and CRR, and that both are required for efficient interaction with Ha-Ras. Next, we looked for the region in Ha-Ras that may interact with CRR. Based on the observation that CRR binds to Ha-Ras in a GTP-independent manner, we speculated that the activator domain of Ha-Ras might be a good candidate since this is the domain whose conformation is not altered upon GDP/GTP exchange but is implicated in effector activation(10.Marshall M.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 250-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 11.Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Shirouzu M. Ito Y. Hattori S. Furuyama S. Nishimura S. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4661-4667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, we first tested the interaction of two activator domain mutants of Ha-Ras with both RBD and CRR. As expected, Ha-Ras mutants N26G and V45E did not bind to MBP-Raf-1(132-206) at all, whereas their binding to MBP-Raf-1(50-131) was unaffected (Fig. 2D). To examine contribution of the switch I/effector domain to interaction of CRR with Ha-Ras, we tested the effect of mutations in this region. The switch I/effector domain mutants P34G and T35S retained normal binding to MBP-Raf-1(132-206), whereas, as expected, they showed severely impaired binding to MBP-Raf-1(50-131) (data not shown). Another switch I/effector domain mutant D38N, which had been used frequently as a negative control for Raf-1 binding(9.Shirouzu M. Koide H. Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Oshio H. Toyama Y. Yamasaki K. Fuhrman S.A. Villafranca E. Kaziro Y. Yokoyama S. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2153-2157PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Zhang X.-F. Settleman J. Kyriakis J.M. Takeuchi-Suzuki E. Elledge S.J. Marshall M.S. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1993; 364: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar), also retained the ability to bind to MBP-Raf-1(132-206) but did not bind to MBP-Raf-1(50-131) at all (Fig. 2D). We also tested interaction of the mutant A59E with RBD and CRR, since a mutation at the same position had been shown to impair interaction with Raf-1(9.Shirouzu M. Koide H. Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Oshio H. Toyama Y. Yamasaki K. Fuhrman S.A. Villafranca E. Kaziro Y. Yokoyama S. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2153-2157PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant A59E completely lost the binding ability to MBP-Raf-1(50-131) but retained normal binding to MBP-Raf-1(132-206) (Fig. 2D). These results strongly support the hypothesis that CRR interacts with the activator domain of Ha-Ras and agree well with previous reports that RBD interacts with the switch I(16.Chuang E. Barnard D. Hettich J. Zhang X.-F. Avruch J. Marshall M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5318-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 17.Fabian J.R. Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5982-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 18.Pumiglia K. Chow Y.-H. Fabian J. Morrison D. Decker S Jove R. Mol. Cell.

The mechanism by which A59E mutation affects interaction of Ha-Ras with RBD is currently unknown. To examine roles of RBD and CRR in Ras-dependent activation of Raf-1, we tested the abilities of mutants V45E and A59E to activate Raf-1 since these mutants retained normal binding to either RBD or CRR but completely lost the binding to the other. D38N mutant was included as a negative control. We expressed full-length Raf-1, either alone or in combination with Ha-RasV12 (wild-type) or one of its mutants in Sf9 cells by coinfection with the respective recombinant baculoviruses (Fig. 3, A and B). Raf-1 proteins in cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Raf-1 antibody and used in in vitro immune complex kinase reactions with or without added GST-MEK and GST-KNERK. All three Ha-Ras mutants exhibited severely impaired ability to induce autophosphorylation of Raf-1 (Fig. 3C) and phosphorylation of KNERK (Fig. 3D) compared with wild-type. These results strongly suggested that interactions of Ha-Ras with both RBD and CRR are required for Raf-1 activation. This finding prompted us to examine whether Ha-Ras without post-translational modifications also has an impairment in interacting with RBD or CRR since unmodified Ha-Ras lacks the ability to activate Raf-1 when coexpressed in Sf9 cells(28.Kikuchi A. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20054-20059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2E, unmodified Ha-Ras did not exhibit any binding to CRR in contrast to its normal binding to RBD. This is the first demonstration that post-translational modifications of Ha-Ras are involved in physical association of Ha-Ras with Raf-1. In the present study, we have shown that CRR interacts with Ha-Ras independently of RBD. During the preparation of this manuscript, Brtva et al. also reported that CRR (GST-Raf-1(139-186)) alone can interact with Ha-Ras in a GTP-dependent manner using an ELISA-based assay(29.Brtva T.R. Drugan J.K. Ghosh S. Terrell R.S. Campbell-Burk S. Bell R.M. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9809-9812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). However, this result is contradictory to our finding that CRR binds to Ha-Ras in a GTP-independent manner. Considering the GTP-dependent binding of all other Raf-1 mutants to Ha-Ras (Fig. 2, A and B), it seems that the condition of our assay is appropriate to detect GTP-dependent binding. Furthermore, the observations that CRR did not interact with Ha-Ras mutants N26G and V45E, and that the C168S mutation introduced into CRR could abolish its interaction with wild-type Ha-Ras, strongly support the specificity of the interaction between Ha-Ras and Raf-1 CRR. Finally, our results agree with the fact that the conformation of the activator domain is not affected by GDP/GTP exchange(10.Marshall M.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 250-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 11.Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Shirouzu M. Ito Y. Hattori S. Furuyama S. Nishimura S. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4661-4667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Although the reason for the discrepancy regarding GTP dependence is unknown, it must be pointed out that the source of Ha-Ras protein in our assay is different from that in their assay. We used post-translationally modified Ha-Ras protein purified from infected Sf9 cells, while they used bacterially expressed Ha-Ras protein which was not modified. In our hands, unmodified Ha-Ras protein purified from Sf9 cells did not bind CRR at all (Fig. 2E). Post-translational modifications of Ha-Ras at its C terminus have been shown to be necessary for its membrane-anchoring as well as for Raf-1 activation(12.Marshall C.J. Science. 1993; 259: 1865-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 28.Kikuchi A. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20054-20059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Modifications of Ha-Ras may have an indirect role in Raf-1 activation; modified and membrane-anchored Ha-Ras may simply recruit Raf-1 to the plasma membrane, where it is subsequently activated by an unknown membrane-bound factor(s)(30.Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 31.Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). However, it is possible that modifications may have a direct role in this process; they may be required for establishing a specific mode of interaction essential for Raf-1 activation. Previous in vivo studies using an Ha-Ras C-terminal mutant deficient in modifications could not examine the two possible roles of modifications in Raf-1 activation separately(28.Kikuchi A. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20054-20059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vitro binding studies using a Raf-1 fragment containing both RBD and CRR did not reveal any significant defect of unmodified Ha-Ras in interaction with Raf-1(21.Zhang X.-F. Settleman J. Kyriakis J.M. Takeuchi-Suzuki E. Elledge S.J. Marshall M.S. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1993; 364: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). In the present study, by separately examining RBD and CRR, we have shown that unmodified Ha-Ras lacks the ability to interact with CRR. This represents a novel molecular defect of unmodified Ha-Ras, which is unrelated to the membrane-anchoring defect. Recently, we have established an in vitro membrane-free system in which modified Ha-Ras can activate B-Raf but unmodified Ha-Ras cannot. 2T. Okada, T. Masuda, M. Shinkai, K. Kariya, and T. Kataoka, submitted for publication. In another membrane-free system, modifications are also required for yeast Ras2 to activate its effector, yeast adenylyl cyclase(32.Kuroda Y. Suzuki N. Kataoka T. Science. 1993; 259: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These observations employing the membrane-free systems also indicate that the defect of unmodified Ras proteins in activating the effectors is unrelated to membrane anchoring. Previous reports examined effects of mutations in RBD or CRR to study roles of these domains in Ras-dependent activation(17.Fabian J.R. Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5982-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 20.Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 21.Zhang X.-F.

However, these manipulations may either alter conformation of Raf-1 or modulate its basal activity(17.Fabian J.R. Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5982-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 20.Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Therefore, use of Ha-Ras mutants that possess the ability to interact differentially with the two Ras-binding domains may provide further insights. In the present study, we actually found these mutants and used them to provide evidence that CRR is involved in Ras-dependent activation of Raf-1. The analysis also showed that residues belonging to the activator domain of Ha-Ras are critical for interaction with CRR, providing a molecular basis for the role of this domain in activation of Raf-1. The binding affinity of CRR for the activator domain is lower than that of RBD for the switch I/effector domain and may not be sufficient for stable association of Raf-1 with GDP-bound Ha-Ras in vivo. However, after establishment of the interaction between RBD and switch I/effector domain of GTP-bound Ha-Ras, the interaction between CRR and the activator domain may take place efficiently and induce further conformational change of Raf-1 to be activated. Post-translational modifications of Ha-Ras C terminus are involved in the latter interaction, although the mechanism of their action remains to be clarified. Further understanding of these interactions will require x-ray crystallographic study of the complex between post-translationally modified Ha-Ras and Raf-1 including both RBD and CRR. We thank A. Kikuchi at Hiroshima University School of Medicine for providing GST-MEK and GST-KNERK, T. Okada for providing unmodified Ha-Ras protein, T. Masuda for advice in measuring Raf-1 kinase activity, and X.-H. Deng for skillful technical assistance. We also thank A. Seki and A. Kawabe for help in preparation of this manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1500525948,"YY1 is a multifunctional transcription factor capable of either activation or repression of transcription. Using a series of mutant proteins, we have characterized domains responsible for activation or repression. We found that the YY1 transcriptional activation domain lies near the amino terminus and requires amino acids 16-29 and 80-100 for maximal activity. The region between residues 16 and 29 has the potential to form an acidic amphipathic helix, whereas residues between 80 and 100 are rich in proline and glutamine. The YY1 repression domain lies near the carboxyl terminus and is embedded within the YY1 zinc finger region necessary for binding to DNA. Deletion of YY1 amino acids, which include zinc fingers 3 and 4, abolishes repression. However, site-directed mutagenesis, progressive deletion, and internal deletion mutant analyses indicate that the normal structures of zinc fingers 3 and 4 are not required for repression."
https://openalex.org/W1979317853,"We report here that the phosphorylation of tyrosine 537 on the human estrogen receptor (hER) controls the receptor's dimerization and DNA binding ability. The DNA-binding form of both the hER from human MCF-7 mammary carcinoma cells and the hER overexpressed in Sf9 insect cells was isolated using estrogen response element (ERE) affinity chromatography. Western blot analyses demonstrated that the DNA-binding form of the hER from MCF-7 or Sf9 cells was (i) phosphorylated at tyrosine 537, (ii) localized in the nucleus of estradiol-treated MCF-7 cells with an apparent molecular mass of 67 kDa, and (iii) hyperphosphorylated at serine residue(s). The non-DNA-binding form of the hER was (i) devoid of phosphorylation at tyrosine 537, (ii) cytosolic with an apparent molecular mass of 66 kDa, and (iii) hypophosphorylated at serine residue(s). The dephosphorylation of the purified hER at phosphotyrosine 537 with a tyrosine phosphatase eliminated binding to an ERE in a gel mobility shift assay. The binding of the tyrosine-dephosphorylated hER to an ERE was restored by the rephosphorylation of tyrosine 537 with Src family tyrosine kinases, p60c-arc or p56lck. Mutation of tyrosine 537 to phenylalanine confirmed that the phosphorylation of tyrosine 537 is necessary for the hER to bind an ERE. An anti-hER antibody restored the binding of the tyrosine-dephosphorylated hER to an ERE, indicating that the bivalent anti-hER antibody brought together the two inactive hER monomers. A far-Western blot confirmed that phosphotyrosine 537 is required for hER homodimerization.These experiments establish that dimerization of the hER and DNA binding are regulated by phosphorylation at tyrosine 537. This is the first demonstration of the regulation of dimerization of a steroid hormone receptor by phosphorylation. These results are significant since p60c-arc is overexpressed in estrogen-dependent breast cancers and may act to enhance the activity of the hER.

These results are significant since p60c-arc is overexpressed in estrogen-dependent breast cancers and may act to enhance the activity of the hER. The steroid/thyroid hormone receptors are ligand-dependent transcription factors that function by binding to hormone response elements on target genes and regulating transcription(1.Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6228) Google Scholar). The processes controlling steroid-specific gene transcription are poorly understood, although receptor-associated coactivators have been reported to be involved(2.Le Douarin B. Zechel C.

Nonetheless, it has been demonstrated that most steroid/thyroid hormone receptors, including the human estrogen receptor (hER), 1The abbreviations used are: hERhuman estrogen receptorEREestrogen response elementMAPmitogen-activated proteinPTP1Bprotein-tyrosine phosphatase 1BSHPTP1Src homology 2 protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1PVDFpolyvinylidene difluorideMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidAbantibody32P-Y537 hERpurified recombinant hER 32P-labeled at tyrosine 537 with p60c-arc32P-S167 hERpurified recombinant hER 32P-labeled at serine 167 with casein kinase II. bind to their hormone response elements as hetero- or homodimers(3.Kumar V.

It has been proposed that the dimerization of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptors is mediated through a leucine zipper motif, a series of hydrophobic heptad repeats in the carboxyl termini of the receptors(5.Forman B.M.

Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar) showed that the ligand-binding domain of human retinoid X receptor α has a dyad symmetry composed of packed helices at the receptor's interface, but not a leucine zipper structure. While the dimerization of most steroid hormone receptors is required for binding to DNA, accessory proteins and post-translational phosphorylation have also been suggested to contribute to DNA binding (8.Onate S.A.

Science. 1994; 265: 1701-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). For example, purification of the progesterone receptor decreases its DNA binding ability, suggesting that an accessory protein (e.g. high mobility group protein-1) is required for high affinity DNA binding(8.Onate S.A. Prendergast P. Wagner J.P. Nissen M. Reeves R. Pettijohn D.E. Edwards D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3376-3391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the phosphorylation of steroid/thyroid hormone receptors has been shown to modulate their DNA binding affinity(11.Arnold, S. F., Obourn, J. D., Jaffe, H. J., Notides, A. C. (1995) J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar). The phosphorylation of the retinoic acid and progesterone receptors increases, while the phosphorylation of thyroid hormone receptor-α2 and nerve growth factor-I-B decreases their affinity for their respective response elements (12.Rochetteegly C.

The hER, like other members of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily, undergoes a hyperphosphorylation at serine residues following hormone binding(16.Denton R.R. Koszewski N.J. Notides A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7263-7268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dephosphorylation of the hER with potato acid phosphatase reduces but does not eliminate the receptor's affinity for an ERE(16.Denton R.R. Koszewski N.J. Notides A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7263-7268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enhanced affinity of the hER for its ERE was found to be mediated by the estradiol-induced phosphorylation of serine 167, the major phosphorylation site on the hER(11.Arnold, S. F., Obourn, J. D., Jaffe, H. J., Notides, A. C. (1995) J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Casein kinase II specifically phosphorylates serine 167 of the hER(17.Arnold S.F. Obourn J.D. Jaffe H. Notides A.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1208-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Serine 118 of the hER was identified as a growth factor-regulated phosphorylation site, mediated by mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase; however, its role in transcriptional activation of the hER remains to be defined(11.Arnold, S. F., Obourn, J. D., Jaffe, H. J., Notides, A. C. (1995) J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar). An estradiol-independent phosphorylation site at tyrosine 537 in the carboxyl terminus of the hER has been identified by amino acid sequencing of 32P-labeled tryptic peptides of the hER(18.Arnold S.F. Obourn J.D. Jaffe H.J. Notides A.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 24-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Src family tyrosine kinases, p60c-arc and p56lck, were shown to specifically phosphorylate tyrosine 537 on the hER, while protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and Src homology 2 protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHPTP1) dephosphorylated phosphotyrosine 537(18.Arnold S.F. Obourn J.D. Jaffe H.J. Notides A.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 24-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the tyrosine kinase activity of p60c-arc in human breast cancers has been shown to be elevated as compared with other cancers (19.Jacobs C. Rubsaamen H. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 1696-1702PubMed Google Scholar). The human MCF-7 mammary carcinoma cell line overexpresses p60c-arc and has been a useful paradigm for investigating estrogen-dependent processes associated with human breast cancers(20.Katzenellenbogen B. Kendra K. Norman M. Berthios Y. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 4355-4360PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we sought to gain insight into the consequences of the phosphorylation of tyrosine 537 on the hER by p60c-arc. We show here that the phosphorylation of tyrosine 537 is a regulatory mechanism that controls the capacity of the hER to undergo the monomer to dimer transition. The phosphorylation of tyrosine 537 is also a prerequisite for the estrogen-dependent hyperphosphorylation of the serine residue(s), nuclear retention, and DNA binding of the hER. 17β-[6,7-3H]Estradiol (45.6 mCi/mmol) was purchased from DuPont NEN. Leupeptin, pepstatin, and chymostatin were obtained from Peninsula Laboratories, Inc. (Belmont, CA). The 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody, p60c-arc (1 pmol of PO4/min/mg), p56lck (1 pmol of PO4/min/mg), MAP kinase (1 μmol of PO4/min/mg), PTP1B (4 nmol PO4/min/μg), and SHPTP1 (40 fmol of PO4/min/μg) were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Casein kinase II (3 μmol of PO4/min/mg) was a generous gift of Drs. E. G. Krebs and D. W. Litchfield (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). Oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis of the hER was performed according to the method of Kunkel(21.Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4863) Google Scholar). A single-stranded template was prepared from M13mp19 containing the hER cDNA grown in Escherichia coli strain CL236. A 28-base pair oligonucleotide primer containing a mutation of tyrosine 537 to phenylalanine and introducing a novel restriction site, XhoI, was used. All mutants were verified by restriction enzyme digestion with XhoI and DNA sequencing. The mutated cDNA of the hER was cloned into the EcoRI site of the pVL1393 baculovirus transfer vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The orientation of the cloned fragment was confirmed by digestion with BglII. The growth conditions of the human MCF-7 cells and the Sf9 insect cells and the expression of the wild-type hER in Sf9 cells have been described(16.Denton R.R. Koszewski N.J. Notides A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7263-7268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Obourn J.D. Koszewski N.J. Notides A.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6229-6236Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Expression of the mutant Y537F hER was accomplished by transfecting the baculovirus vector AcNPV-Y537F hER into Sf9 cells using BaculoGold linearized baculovirus DNA (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA.) and Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Whole cell extracts from MCF-7 or Sf9 cells were prepared as described previously(16.Denton R.R. Koszewski N.J. Notides A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7263-7268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Obourn J.D. Koszewski N.J. Notides A.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6229-6236Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved on a SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel for 10 h at 30 mA and electrotransferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). To detect phosphotyrosine by Western blotting, the PVDF membrane was blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin for 3 h and then immunoblotted with a 1:1000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody for 3 h. The bands were visualized by chemiluminescence using the ECL system (Amersham Corp.). The PVDF membranes were stripped for reblotting in 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS at 50°C for 30 min. The membrane was then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and reblotted with anti-hER antibody 6(22.Obourn J.D. Koszewski N.J. Notides A.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6229-6236Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The whole cell extracts of MCF-7 or Sf9 cells were made 40% saturated with respect to ammonium sulfate, and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation. The ammonium sulfate precipitate was dissolved in a Tris buffer composed of 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 25 mM KCl, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 10 mM sodium phosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4, 0.2 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mM leupeptin, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. Then, 50 μg/ml single- and double-stranded salmon sperm DNAs was added to block nonspecific binding to the ERE-Teflon matrix. The sequence of the ERE and its coupling to the Teflon affinity matrix have been described(22.Obourn J.D. Koszewski N.J. Notides A.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6229-6236Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The hER was incubated with the ERE affinity column for 30 min at 4°C. The ERE affinity column was washed with 30 volumes of the Tris buffer containing 0.15 M KCl and eluted with the Tris buffer containing 0.6 M KCl. For analysis by SDS gel electrophoresis, the ERE affinity column fractions were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone, and dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer(23.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204236) Google Scholar). A double-stranded 27-base pair probe (5′-GATCCTAGAGGTCACAGTGACCTACGA-3′) encoding the Xenopus vitellogenin A2 ERE (24.Klein-Hiptass L. Schorpp M. Wagner U. Ryffel G.U. Cell. 1986; 46: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) was 32P-end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase. The gel mobility shift assay was performed with the hER in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM KCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 nM estradiol, 15% glycerol, and protease inhibitors. The hER, at a final concentration of 10 nM, except where otherwise noted, was incubated with 500 ng of poly(dI•dC) for 15 min at 4°C. Then, 20 fmol of 32P-labeled ERE was added for 15 min at 4°C in a total volume of 20 μl. Samples were loaded onto a prerun 5% polyacrylamide gel followed by electrophoresis with cooling at 175 V for 3 h in 25 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 152 mM glycine, and 1 mM EDTA. The gel was dried and autoradiographed at −70°C. The native or recombinant wild-type hER was phosphorylated by the addition of the reaction buffer for p60c-arc (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 10 mM MgCl2), p56lck (125 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 62.5 mM MgCl2, 12.5 mM MnCl2, and 0.125 mM Na3VO4), casein kinase II (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 10 mM MgCl2), or MAP kinase (60 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, 50 mM β-glycerol phosphate, 2 mM EGTA, 30 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM NaF, and 8 mM dithiothreitol). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 mM ATP and 5 units of p60c-arc, 50 units of p56lck, 50 ng of casein kinase II, or 50 ng of MAP kinase. The reactions were incubated at 30°C for 15 min and then stopped by placing the tube at 4°C and adding phosphatase inhibitors. The native or recombinant hER (10 nM) was dephosphorylated at 37°C for 30 min in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 5% glycerol with 1 μg of PTP1B or 5 μg of SHPTP1 conjugated to agarose beads. The phosphatase-agarose beads were removed by centrifugation at 4°C and washed with buffer. The supernatant and the washes were pooled, and 100 nM estradiol was added. The purified recombinant hER was dephosphorylated/rephosphorylated as described above, resolved by SDS gel electrophoresis, and electrotransferred to a PVDF membrane. For the probe, the purified recombinant hER was labeled with [32P]ATP and p60c-arc or casein kinase II(25.Arnold S.F. Notides A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7475-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The native hER from untreated MCF-7 cells detected with an anti-hER antibody migrated at 66 kDa (Fig. 1, lane 1), whereas estradiol treatment of the MCF-7 cells produced two forms of the hER, a 66-kDa and a 67-kDa form (Fig. 1, lane 3). The 67-kDa form of the hER results from hyperphosphorylation of serine residues as previously shown by [32P]phosphate incorporation and phosphoamino acid analysis(16.Denton R.R. Koszewski N.J. Notides A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7263-7268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Golding T.A. Korach K.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, a serine phosphatase, but not a tyrosine phosphatase, reverts the 67-kDa form to the 66-kDa form of the hER (data not shown). The 66-kDa form of the native hER from untreated MCF-7 cells was recognized by the 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1, lane 2). However, after estradiol treatment of the MCF-7 cells, the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody recognized only the 67-kDa form and not the 66-kDa form of the hER (Fig. 1, lane 4). These data indicate that only the fraction of the hER in the 66-kDa form, which was phosphorylated at tyrosine, was converted to the 67-kDa form after estradiol treatment of the MCF-7 cells. To further aid in deciphering the function of tyrosine phosphorylation, the wild-type hER and the mutant Y537F hER were expressed in Sf9 cells. The wild-type hER expressed in Sf9 cells reacted with an anti-hER antibody, confirming the presence of the wild-type hER at 66 and 67 kDa (22.Obourn J.D. Koszewski N.J. Notides A.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6229-6236Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The 67-kDa form, but not the 66-kDa form, of the wild-type hER from whole cell extracts of Sf9 cells (or following purification of the hER by immunoprecipitation) showed strong reactivity with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 1, lanes 6 and 8). Antibody 6 immunoprecipitates, before or after estrogen treatment of MCF-7 cells, the 66- or 67-kDa form of the hER with equal efficiency (data not shown). The presence of the 67-kDa form of the wild-type hER was independent of estradiol treatment of the Sf9 cells (Fig. 1, lanes 5 and 7). The lack of estrogen-dependent phosphorylation of the hER in Sf9 insect cells may be due to the 10,000-fold overexpression of the hER in insect as compared with mammalian cells(22.Obourn J.D. Koszewski N.J. Notides A.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6229-6236Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), cell-specific differences in protein kinase regulatory pathways, or loss of regulatory factors during baculoviral infection. An extract from Sf9 cells infected with mock baculovirus showed no reactivity with the anti-hER or the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody at 66 or 67 kDa (data not shown). The mutant Y537F hER expressed in Sf9 cells migrated only at 66 kDa in the absence or presence of estradiol treatment of the Sf9 cells (Fig. 1, lanes 9 and 11) and did not show reactivity with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (lanes 10 and 12). These results confirm our earlier findings that the hER is phosphorylated at tyrosine 537 (18.Arnold S.F. Obourn J.D. Jaffe H.J. Notides A.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 24-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that the 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody specifically recognizes the phosphorylation at tyrosine 537 on the hER. These data also indicate that the phosphorylation of tyrosine 537 is a necessary prerequisite for the serine hyperphosphorylation of the hER and consequently the formation of the 67-kDa form of the hER. The intracellular localization of the 67-kDa form of the hER in MCF-7 cells was exclusively nuclear after estradiol treatment. Following a 20-min exposure to [3H]estradiol, the nuclear fraction of the MCF-7 cells contained 90% of the specifically bound [3H]estradiol, while only 10% was present in the cytoplasmic fraction (data not shown). Equivalent amounts of cytosolic and nuclear proteins were separated by SDS gel electrophoresis and electrotransferred to a PVDF membrane. Western blot analysis with an anti-hER antibody revealed that the nuclear fraction contained the 67-kDa form of the hER, while the cytosolic fraction contained the 66-kDa form (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 3). Consistent with the observations described above, only the 67-kDa form of the hER reacted with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody in a Western blot (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 4). In the absence of estradiol treatment of MCF-7 cells, the hER was recovered only in the cytosolic fraction, demonstrating that estrogen binding promotes nuclear retention of the hER ((16.Denton R.R. Koszewski N.J. Notides A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7263-7268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and data not shown). These results suggest that the biologically active hER is the 67-kDa form since it is hyperphosphorylated and retained in the nucleus after estradiol treatment of MCF-7 cells. The hyperphosphorylated 67-kDa form, whether from estradiol-treated MCF-7 cells or untreated Sf9 cells expressing the wild-type hER, had a higher affinity than the 66-kDa form for an ERE affinity column. Ammonium sulfate fractions of the MCF-7 or Sf9 cell extracts were subjected to ERE affinity chromatography. Western blot analysis of the flow-through and salt-eluted fractions from the ERE affinity column revealed that the salt-eluted fractions from the MCF-7 or Sf9 cell preparations contained only the 67-kDa form of the hER (Fig. 3, A and B, lane 5). In contrast, the flow-through fraction contained only the 66-kDa form of the native hER and the recombinant hER (Fig. 3, A and B, lane 3). The anti-phosphotyrosine antibody data indicated that the native hER and the recombinant hER in the eluate fraction, but not in the flow-through fraction, were phosphorylated at tyrosine 537 (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 4 and 6). Rechromatography of the flow-through fraction of the recombinant hER on the ERE affinity column revealed that the hER still eluted in the flow-through fraction, indicating that selective ERE binding was not due to a limited number of ERE-binding sites on the column (data not shown). Furthermore, the presence of estradiol did not alter the binding of the hER to the ERE affinity column since the 67-kDa form of both the unliganded recombinant hER and the liganded native hER bound to the ERE affinity column (Fig. 3, A and B). The mutant Y537F hER did not bind to the ERE affinity column and was present only in the flow-through fraction (Fig. 3C). The 67-kDa form of the recombinant hER was purified to near homogeneity by ERE affinity chromatography. Coomassie Blue staining indicated that the 67-kDa form of the hER was the only protein present (Fig. 4, lane 1). Western blot analysis with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody detected only the hER (Fig. 4, lane 2). The phosphorylation of tyrosine 537 on the hER was necessary for its binding to an ERE in a gel mobility shift assay. A whole cell extract of Sf9 cells expressing the wild-type hER was incubated with a 32P-labeled ERE, and the complexes were resolved by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. The recombinant hER formed a specific hER•ERE complex that was supershifted with an anti-hER antibody (i.e. the mobility of the hER Ab•hER•ERE complex was further retarded, confirming the presence of the hER in the complex) (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 2). The DNA specificity was shown by the addition of a 50-fold excess of unlabeled ERE, which eliminated the appearance of the hER•ERE complex (Fig. 5, lane 3). The recombinant or native hER in the salt-eluted fraction from the ERE affinity column formed a hER•ERE complex (Fig. 5, lanes 4 and 6). In contrast, the recombinant or native hER in the flow-through fraction did not form a hER•ERE complex (Fig. 5, lanes 5 and 7). The 67-kDa form of the native hER treated with the tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of the hER•ERE complex (Fig. 6A, lanes 2-4) and reactivity with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 6B, lanes 2-4). With 1 μg of PTP1B, the hER•ERE complex and the tyrosine phosphorylation of the hER were completely eliminated (Fig. 6, A and B, lane 4). The tyrosine dephosphorylation by PTP1B was specific since 1 mM Na3VO4, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, prevented the loss of the hER•ERE complex (Fig. 6A, lane 7) and the tyrosine dephosphorylation of the hER (Fig. 6B, lane 7). The addition of Sf9 mock cytosol (without hER) did not restore the binding of the tyrosine-dephosphorylated hER to an ERE (data not shown). The tyrosine-dephosphorylated hER nevertheless migrated as a 67-kDa protein, indicating that PTP1B did not result in serine dephosphorylation, which is responsible for the 67-kDa form of the hER. The rephosphorylation of the tyrosine-dephosphorylated hER by p60c-arc resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the hER•ERE complex (Fig. 6A, lanes 5 and 6). The action of the p60c-arc was not observed in the absence of ATP (data not shown). A Western blot confirmed that the tyrosine phosphorylation of the hER by the p60c-arc restored reactivity with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 6B, lanes 5 and 6). Western blot analysis with the anti-hER antibody confirmed the presence of the hER in all the samples (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that the binding of the native hER to an ERE is dependent on the phosphorylation of tyrosine 537. The purified recombinant wild-type hER showed identical characteristics, with respect to tyrosine phosphorylation and binding to an ERE, as the native hER. The tyrosine dephosphorylation of the recombinant wild-type hER (Fig. 7B, lanes 1 and 2) eliminated ERE binding (Fig. 7A, lanes 1 and 2). The tyrosine dephosphorylation of the recombinant wild-type hER was inhibited with 1 mM Na3VO4 (Fig. 7B, lanes 11 and 12) and prevented the loss of the hER•ERE complex by inhibiting the activity of the tyrosine phosphatases (Fig. 7A, lanes 11 and 12). Casein kinase II or MAP kinase activity did not restore the ERE binding of the tyrosine-dephosphorylated hER (Fig. 7A, lanes 5, 6, 9, and 10). However, ERE binding was restored after the 67-kDa form of the purified recombinant hER (that was dephosphorylated with PTP1B or SHPTP1) was rephosphorylated with p60c-arc or p56lck (Fig. 7A, lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8). The restoration of ERE binding was specific since p60c-arc or p56lck in the absence of ATP did not restore the hER•ERE complex (data not shown). Western blot analysis with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody confirmed the phosphorylation of tyrosine 537 by p60c-arc or p56lck, but not by casein kinase II or MAP kinase (Fig. 7B, lanes 3-10). To confirm that the phosphorylation of tyrosine 537 is required for the hER to bind an ERE, the ERE binding properties of the mutant Y537F hER were assayed. As expected, a whole cell extract of Sf9 cells expressing the wild-type hER or the purified 67-kDa form of the recombinant wild-type hER produced a hER•ERE complex (Fig. 8, lanes 1 and 2). However, at 10 or 40 nM mutant Y537F hER, a hER•ERE complex was not formed (Fig. 8, lanes 3 and 4). An “antibody rescue experiment” (27.Neff S. Sadowski C. Miksicek R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1215-1223PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the phosphorylation of the hER at tyrosine 537 regulates the monomer to dimer transition of the receptor (Fig. 9). The premise of the antibody rescue experiment is that the anti-hER antibody is bivalent and recognizes two molecules of hER. Therefore, the anti-hER antibody can bring together two inactive hER monomers and facilitate dimer formation and DNA binding. The purified 67-kDa form of the recombinant hER was incubated in the absence or presence of the anti-hER antibody or a nonspecific antibody. The anti-hER antibody, but not the nonspecific antibody, supershifted the hER•ERE complex (Fig. 9, lanes 1, 2, and 4). The 67-kDa form of the recombinant hER after dephosphorylation with PTP1B did not form a hER•ERE complex (Fig. 9, lane 5). Interestingly, we observed the appearance of a supershifted complex (hER Ab•hER•ERE) when the dephosphorylated hER was incubated with the anti-hER antibody (Fig. 9, lane 6). The hER Ab•hER•ERE complex was eliminated with an excess of unlabeled ERE (Fig. 9, lanes 3 and 9), but not unlabeled glucocorticoid response element (lane 8), indicating that the complex was ERE-specific. A supershifted hER Ab•hER•ERE complex was not formed with the anti-hER antibody when hER peptide 6, which was used to generate the anti-hER antibody, was added to the gel shift reaction (22.Obourn J.D. Koszewski N.J. Notides A.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6229-6236Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In addition, a nonspecific antibody did not produce a complex with the dephosphorylated hER (data not shown). Thus, the anti-hER antibody facilitated the formation of the hER dimer and allowed ERE binding. Predictably, the mutant Y537F hER did not form a hER•ERE complex, whereas the addition of the anti-hER antibody to the mutant Y537F hER gel shift reaction produced a hER Ab•hER•ERE complex (Fig. 9, lanes 10 and 11). These results suggest that the phosphorylation of tyrosine 537 on the hER is required for dimerization of the hER. Far-Western blot analysis established that the tyrosine phosphorylation of the hER was necessary for dimerization. Dimer formation was maximal when both monomers of the hER were phosphorylated at tyrosine 537. Dimer formation was also observed when one of the monomers of the hER dimer was tyrosine-phosphorylated; however, the extent of dimerization was reduced to more than one-half. The far-Western blot analysis utilized the purified recombinant hER that was either 32P-labeled at tyrosine 537 with p60c-arc (32P-Y537 hER) (Fig. 10A) or 32P-labeled at serine 167 with casein kinase II as a probe (32P-S167 hER) (Fig. 10B). The 32P-Y537 hER showed strong protein-protein interaction with the purified recombinant wild-type hER immobilized on a PVDF membrane (Fig. 10A, lane 1). However, far-Western analysis of the hER that was tyrosine-dephosphorylated prior to SDS gel electrophoresis showed a reduced interaction with 32P-Y537 hER (Fig. 10A, lanes 2 and 3). An immunoblot with the anti-tyrosine antibody confirmed that the PVDF-immobilized hER was tyrosine-dephosphorylated (Fig. 10C, lanes 2, 3, 6, and 7). One mM Na3VO4 inhibited the activity of PTP1B and SHPTP1 (Fig. 10C, lanes 4 and 5) and prevented the reduction of interaction with 32P-Y537 hER (Fig. 10A, lanes 4 and 5). The hER was tyrosine-dephosphorylated with PTP1B or SHPTP1 and then rephosphorylated with casein kinase II, MAP kinase, p60c-arc, or p56lck. The tyrosine phosphorylation, but not the serine phosphorylation, of the hER restored the full dimerization potential to the dephosphorylated hER (Fig. 10A, lanes 8 and 9 versus lanes 6 and 7). Far-Western blot analysis with the 32P-S167 hER confirmed that hER dimerization was dependent on tyrosine and not serine phosphorylation (Fig. 10B). An immunoblot of the PVDF membrane with the anti-hER antibody showed that the amount of hER in each lane was equivalent (Fig. 10D). This study provides the first evidence that the tyrosine phosphorylation of the hER regulates the capacity of the receptor to homodimerize and bind an ERE. We have presented evidence, from several different experimental approaches, that the phosphorylation at tyrosine 537 of the hER is a prerequisite for ERE binding. We observed that the nuclear form, but not the cytosolic form, of the hER is tyrosine-phosphorylated. Only the nuclear hER bound an ERE in a gel mobility shift assay. The dephosphorylation of the purified hER with a tyrosine phosphatase results in the loss of ERE binding, while rephosphorylation with p60c-arc or p56lck, but not with serine-protein kinases, restores ERE binding. These observations were confirmed by the inability of the mutant Y537F hER to bind an ERE. The antibody rescue experiments show that ERE binding is restored to the tyrosine-dephosphorylated hER or the mutant Y537F hER by virtue of the ability of the anti-hER antibody to promote dimer formation. Far-Western blot analysis demonstrated that the tyrosine phosphorylation of at least one of the hER monomers, but preferably both, is required for dimer formation. Overall, our results indicate that the phosphorylation of tyrosine 537 facilitates the transition of the hER from the monomer to dimer form. The reactivity of the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody with the native hER was equivalent in the absence (i.e. the 66-kDa form of the hER) or presence (i.e. the 67-kDa form of the hER) of estradiol treatment of MCF-7 cells, confirming earlier observations that the phosphorylation of tyrosine 537 is not increased by estradiol treatment(18.Arnold S.F. Obourn J.D. Jaffe H.J. Notides A.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 24-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a previous report, the ERE-Teflon matrix containing ~500 nmol of double-stranded ERE/ml of Teflon fiber bound both the 66- and 67-kDa forms of the hER(22.Obourn J.D. Koszewski N.J. Notides A.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6229-6236Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In the experiments described here, the ERE content was only 1-5% of that previously used and consequently revealed selectivity for the 67-kDa form of the hER. Recently, tyrosine phosphorylation has been reported to regulate the dimerization of the signal transducer and activators of transcription (STAT) family of DNA-binding proteins(9.Shuai K. Horvath C.M. Tsai Huang L.H. Qureshi S.A. Cowburn D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 821-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 10.Hou J. Schindeler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.C. Brassner M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1701-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). The STAT proteins dimerize through the association of a phosphorylated tyrosine residue on one monomer and with a SH2 domain on the opposing monomer(9.Shuai K. Horvath C.M. Tsai Huang L.H. Qureshi S.A. Cowburn D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 821-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 10.Hou J. Schindeler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.C. Brassner M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1701-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). This mechanism of dimerization allows for an additional level of control of the activity of a transcription factor. A computer search of the amino acid sequence of the hER has failed to reveal a region of significant homology to the SH2 domain of p60c-arc. We hypothesize that the 67-kDa form of the hER is the transcriptionally active form of the receptor. In the absence of estradiol treatment of MCF-7 cells, the 66-kDa form of the native hER exists as two populations of receptors: one that is phosphorylated at tyrosine 537 and one that is not. After estradiol treatment of MCF-7 cells, only the population of hER that is phosphorylated at tyrosine 537 will undergo serine hyperphosphorylation, as monitored by the production of the up-shifted 67-kDa form of the hER. We 2S. F. Arnold, D. P. Vorojeikina, and A. C. Notides, unpublished data. and others (28.Castoria G. Migliaccio A. Green S. DiDomenico M. Chambon P. Aurricchio F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1740-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) have shown that the phosphorylation of tyrosine 537 is required for the hER to bind estradiol in vitro and in vivo. Numerous mechanisms can account for the nuclear retention of the 67-kDa form of the native hER; estradiol has been shown to increase the binding of the calf estrogen receptor to an ERE by isocratic elution chromatography (29.Skafar D.F. Notides A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12208-12213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the influence of hormone binding is not observed with the ERE affinity column or gel mobility shift analysis. We have shown that the phosphorylation of serine 167 on the hER increases the affinity of the hER for an ERE(11.Arnold, S. F., Obourn, J. D., Jaffe, H. J., Notides, A. C. (1995) J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar). In addition, the hER associates in an estradiol-dependent fashion with transcriptional proteins, such as transcriptional intermediary factor 1 (TIF1)(2.Le Douarin B. Zechel C. Garnier J.-M. Lutz Y. Tora L. Pierrat B. Heery D. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2020-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the DNA binding ability of the hER is regulated at two levels of post-translational phosphorylation: first, the phosphorylation of tyrosine 537 is required for hER binding to an ERE, and second, the phosphorylation of serine 167 increases the hER (already phosphorylated at tyrosine 537) affinity for an ERE. In conclusion, the post-translational phosphorylation of tyrosine 537 on the hER is required to produce the biologically active hER. Furthermore, the oncogenic potential of protein-tyrosine kinases, such as p60c-arc, may alter the activity of the hER in estrogen-dependent breast cancer."

https://openalex.org/W1972705740,"The transcription factors controlling the complex genetic response to ischemia and their modes of regulation are poorly understood. We found that ATF-2 and c-Jun DNA binding activity is markedly enhanced in post-ischemic kidney or in LLC-PK1 renal tubular epithelial cells exposed to reversible ATP depletion. After 40 min of renal ischemia followed by reperfusion for as little as 5 min, binding of ATF-2 and c-Jun, but not ATF-3 or CREB (cAMP response element binding protein), to oligonucleotides containing either an ATF/cAMP response element (ATF/CRE) or the jun2TRE from the c-jun promoter, was significantly increased. Binding to jun2TRE and ATF/CRE oligonucleotides occurred with an identical time course. In contrast, nuclear protein binding to an oligonucleotide containing a canonical AP-1 element was not detected until 40 min of reperfusion, and although c-Jun was present in the complex, ATF-2 was not. Incubating nuclear extracts from reperfused kidney with protein phosphatase 2A markedly reduced binding to both the ATF/CRE and jun2TRE oligonucleotides, compatible with regulation by an ATF-2 kinase. An ATF-2 kinase, which phosphorylated both the transactivation and DNA binding domains of ATF-2, was activated by reversible ATP depletion. This kinase co-eluted on Mono Q column chromatography with a c-Jun amino-terminal kinase and with the peak of stress-activated protein kinase, but not p38, immunoreactivity.

Phosphorylation-dependent activation of the DNA binding activity of ATF-2, which appears to be regulated by the stress-activated protein kinases, may play an important role in the earliest stages of the genetic response to ischemia/reperfusion by targeting ATF-2 and c-Jun to specific promoters, including the c-jun promoter and those containing ATF/CREs.

Acute renal failure is a major cause of morbidity in hospitalized patients and often results from transient cessation of blood flow (ischemia) followed by restoration of flow (reperfusion)(1.Bonventre J.V. Kidney Int. 1993; 43: 1160-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Reperfusion of ischemic tissue activates a complex genetic program, which may induce cells to dedifferentiate, to proliferate, or, possibly, to undergo apoptosis(1.Bonventre J.V.

We report that ATF-2 and c-Jun DNA binding activity is highly regulated in the intact animal in response to the extreme, albeit common, pathophysiologic stress of reperfusion of the ischemic kidney, and ATF-2 DNA binding activity is regulated by an ischemia-activated ATF-2 kinase, probably a SAPK. Phosphorylation may serve to target ATF-2 and c-Jun to various promoter sites, including the jun2TRE within the c-jun promoter, and this targeting may be an important initial step in the transcriptional responses necessary for repair and proliferation of cells that have survived the ischemic insult to restore tissue functional integrity. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 220-350 g were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (55 mg/kg) and then administered 10 ml of 0.9% NaCl intraperitoneally prior to surgery to prevent intravascular volume depletion. Unilateral renal ischemia was induced by occluding the left renal artery and vein with a microaneurysm clamp(2.Witzgall R. Brown D. Schwarz C. Bonventre J.V. J. Clin.

Ischemic and contralateral kidneys were removed at 0, 5, 40, or 90 min following initiation of reperfusion. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described(29.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar), with modifications, from sham-operated control, post-ischemic, and contralateral kidneys(26.Pombo C.P.

Kidneys were homogenized at 4°C in homogenization buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mM β-glycerophosphate, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 250 mM sucrose, 0.4 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 2 μM leupeptin, 2 μM pepstatin, 10 units/ml Trasylol). The lysates were centrifuged at 3,300 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatants were discarded, and the packed nuclear volume was estimated. The nuclei were resuspended in 0.5 packed nuclear volume of low-salt buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 20 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM PMSF, 0.5 mM DTT). Then, 0.5 packed nuclear volume of high-salt buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.8 M KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM PMSF, 0.5 mM DTT) was added. After 30 min of continuous gentle mixing, the nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation (30 min at 25,000 × g). The supernatants were dialyzed twice against 50 volumes of dialysis buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 100 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM PMSF, 0.5 mM DTT) for 2 h. The dialyzed extract was then centrifuged for 20 min at 25,000 × g, and the protein concentration was determined. The nuclear extracts were stored at −80°C. LLC-PK1 renal tubular epithelial cells were reversibly depleted of ATP by exposure to cyanide (5 mM) and 2-deoxyglucose (5 mM) in the absence of glucose for 40 min followed by re-exposure to glucose for 20 min to allow cellular ATP levels to recover(26.Pombo C.P.

Cells were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline and then resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.9, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM NaF, 1 mM EDTA, 0.6% Nonidet P-40, 2 μM pepstatin and leupeptin, and 0.4 mM PMSF). After centrifugation (1250 × g) for 5 min, the pellet was resuspended in 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 420 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM PMSF, 25% glycerol. After 20 min at 4°C, samples were centrifuged (1250 × g) for 5 min, and the supernatant (nuclear extract) was stored at −80°C. Binding activities in the nuclear extracts to ATF/CRE, jun2TRE, and AP-1 element-containing oligonucleotides were determined by gel shift assays using double-stranded oligonucleotides as probes. The ATF/CRE oligonucleotide was prepared by annealing 5′-GATCCAGCTTGATGACGTCAGCCG-3′ (27.Abdel-Hafiz H.A. Heasley L.E. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Kroll D.J. Johnson G.L. Hoeffler J.P. Mol.

The jun2TRE probe was made by annealing 5′-AGCTAGCATTACCTCATCCC-3′ (−194 to −179 of the c-jun promoter underlined and core element in bold) and 5′-GATCGGGATGAGGTAATGCT-3′. The AP-1 element-containing oligonucleotide was made by annealing 5′-AGCTTGGTGACTCATCCG3′ (canonical AP-1 site in bold) and 5′-GATCCGGATGAGTCACCA-3′(13.Boyle W.J. Smeal T. Defize L.H. Angel P.

The double-stranded jun2TRE and AP-1 consensus oligonucleotides were labeled with [α-32P]dATP by fill-in reaction with Klenow. For the binding reactions, nuclear extracts (3-20 μg) were mixed with 20,000 cpm of the appropriate 32P-labeled oligonucleotide in 20 μl of buffer containing 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.9), 10% glycerol, 50 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, and 1 μg of poly[d(I•C)]. After 20 min at room temperature, the reaction products were separated on a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Gels were then dried and subjected to autoradiography. Competition experiments were performed by preincubating the extracts with unlabeled ATF/CRE, jun2TRE, or AP-1 oligonucleotides for 5 min. Labeled oligonucleotide was then added (20,000 cpm) for 20 min prior to electrophoresis. Antibody supershift assays were performed by adding 2 μg of the appropriate antibody to the extract after a 20-min preincubation of extract with labeled oligonucleotide. After 4 h at 4°C, samples were run on 4% non-denaturing gels. Alternatively, incubation with the antibody was performed for 1 h prior to addition of the labeled probe. All antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. To determine the role of phosphorylation in the binding activity directed at the ATF/CRE and jun2TRE oligonucleotides, extracts were incubated for 30 min at 30°C with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A, which was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle (31.Chen J. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Science. 1992; 257: 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar) (generously provided by Dr. David L. Brautigan). To ensure that any change in binding activity was due to phosphatase activity, extracts were also exposed to phosphatase 2A in the presence of the phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid (100 nM), or to heat-inactivated phosphatase 2A (10 min at 55°C; heat inactivation was employed because a second phosphatase 2A inhibitor, microcystin, directly interfered with the gel shift assay). Following this, gel shift assays were performed as above. The effect of the phosphatase on ATF/CRE and jun2TRE binding was quantified by densitometry using an IS 1000 digital imaging system. The supernatants from LLC-PK1 cell lysates were matched for protein and loaded onto a Mono Q anion exchange column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), which had been pre-equilibrated with buffer A (25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.03% (w/w) Brij 35, 1 mM benzamidine, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.3 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol). After washing with 10 ml of buffer A, proteins were eluted with a 40-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0-700 mM), and 1-ml fractions were collected. 10 μl of column fractions were added to 10 μl of assay buffer containing GST-ATF-2 (8-94), including the transactivation domain (21-23), GST-ATF-2 (94-505), including the DNA binding and dimerization domains(27.Abdel-Hafiz H.A.

After 20 min at 30°C, reactions were stopped, and the samples were processed for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The bands corresponding to the substrates were cut out of the gel, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. 50 μl of the column fractions were run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Imobilon. The membranes were stained with anti-SAPK antiserum(24.Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R.

Detection was with the enhanced Chemiluminescence system. Rats were subjected to 40 min of unilateral renal ischemia followed by no reperfusion or reperfusion for 5, 40, or 90 min. Nuclear extracts were made from these kidneys and from sham-operated controls as well as contralateral, non-ischemic control kidneys. Binding of extract proteins to an oligonucleotide (5′-GATCCAGCTTGATGACGTCAGCCG-3′) containing the consensus palindromic ATF/CRE octanucleotide (in boldface type) was evaluated. Binding activity directed at the ATF/CRE oligonucleotide in nuclear extracts from ischemic kidneys that had not been reperfused was not different from control kidney activity (Fig. 1A). Reperfusion for as little as 5 min, however, markedly increased ATF/CRE binding activity. Binding activity remained greater than control in extracts from kidneys reperfused for 90 min (Fig. 1A). The DNA binding activity was specific to the ATF/CRE oligonucleotide, since 5-fold excess unlabeled oligonucleotide markedly reduced and 125-fold excess oligonucleotide eliminated binding to the labeled oligonucleotide (Fig. 1B, left), but 125-fold excess of an unlabeled oligonucleotide (5′-GATCCAGCTTGATCATGTCAGCCG-3′), containing base pair changes at two sites within the ATF/CRE palindrome (underlined), did not reduce binding (Fig. 1B, right). We also examined DNA binding activity in nuclear extracts from renal tubular epithelial cells (LLC-PK1) exposed to reversible ATP depletion, one component of ischemia. Consistent with previous observations in cultured cells, there was a high basal binding activity in control cells directed at the ATF/CRE oligonucleotide, but ATP repletion resulted in a significant increase in binding activity (Fig. 1C). Antibody interference and supershift assays were performed to identify the proteins binding to the ATF/CRE oligonucleotide after reperfusion. ATF-2 is a member of the group of bZip transcription factors. Heterodimer formation between members of the bZip group is common and is believed to add diversity to the cis-acting elements at which binding of the dimers is directed. Specifically, ATF-2 may dimerize with c-Jun, as occurs in response to E1a, and in so doing shift the binding preference of c-Jun toward ATF/CRE sites(35.Benbrook D.M. Jones N.C. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 295-302PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Hai T. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3720-3724Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar, 37.van Dam H. Duyndam M.

Therefore, we determined whether ATF-2 or c-Jun were present in the complex binding to the ATF/CRE oligonucleotide. Preincubation of extracts with anti-ATF-2 or anti-c-Jun, but not anti-CREB or anti-ATF-3, markedly decreased apparent binding activity directed at the ATF/CRE oligonucleotide, suggesting ATF-2 and c-Jun account for an important percent of total ATF/CRE binding activity in post-ischemic kidney or post-anoxic LLC-PK1 cells (Fig. 2A, left and right). Although the c-Jun antibody decreased the apparent binding activity more than the ATF-2 antibody, this does not necessarily mean that c-Jun accounts for a larger percent of DNA binding activity and may be due to differences in the antibodies and/or to access of the antibodies to their respective epitopes. When extracts were first incubated with labeled ATF/CRE oligonucleotide and then one of the monoclonal antibodies, a supershift was induced by anti-ATF-2 and anti-c-Jun, but not anti-CREB or anti-ATF-3, even after prolonged exposure of the gels (Fig. 2B, left and right). These data suggest that reperfusion of ischemic kidney specifically activates DNA binding activity of ATF-2 and c-Jun directed at an ATF/CRE motif. Although these data do not prove conclusively that ATF-2 and c-Jun bind to the ATF/CRE motif as a dimer after reperfusion of ischemic kidney, it is highly probable since c-Jun homodimers or heterodimers of c-Jun and a c-Fos family member bind with low affinity to ATF/CRE sites. This reperfusion-induced dimerization with ATF-2 appears to be specific to c-Jun since, as noted, neither ATF-3 nor CREB, with which ATF-2 may also dimerize(32.Abdel-Hafiz H.A. Chen C.Y. Marcell T. Kroll D.J. Hoeffler J.P. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1161-1174PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Benbrook D.M. Jones N.C. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 295-302PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Hai T. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1463-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), was detected in the complex. The c-jun promoter is one of only a very few target regions of ATF-2 that have been identified. ATF-2 and c-Jun heterodimers appear to be responsible, at least in part, for the induction of c-jun by adenoviral E1a protein(37.van Dam H. Duyndam M. Rottier R. Bosch A. de Vries-Smits L. Herrlich P. Zantema A. Angel P. van der Eb A.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The heterodimer binds to a cis-acting element in the c-jun promoter called the jun2TRE (TTACCTCA, positions −190 to −183 of the c-jun promoter), which is a variant of the canonical AP-1 element (TGA(C/G)TCA). Since c-jun is induced following reperfusion of ischemic kidney(3.Safirstein R. Price P.M. Subodh S.J. Saggi J. Harris R.C. Kidney Int. 1990; 37: 1515-1521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 4.Rosenberg M.E. Paller M.S. Kidney Int. 1991; 39: 1156-1161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we determined whether reperfusion also enhanced binding activity of ATF-2 and c-Jun directed at a jun2TRE-containing oligonucleotide (5′-AGCTAGCATTACCTCATCCC-3′, position −194 to −179 of the c-jun promoter underlined), as a possible mechanism of c-jun induction. Reperfusion enhanced a jun2TRE binding activity in kidney nuclear extracts (Fig. 3A), which was eliminated by incubation with 125-fold excess unlabeled jun2TRE oligonucleotide (Fig. 3B). The time course of activation of the jun2TRE binding activity and that of the ATF/CRE binding activity were similar. Binding to the jun2TRE was evident as early as 5 min post-reperfusion. Preincubation of kidney nuclear extracts with antibodies to either ATF-2 or c-Jun, but not ATF-3 or CREB, prior to gel shift assay markedly reduced the intensity of the shifted band and induced a supershift (Fig. 3C). These data confirm the presence of both ATF-2 and c-Jun in the complex and suggest that together they account for a significant percent of the jun2TRE binding activity in post-ischemic kidney. These data suggest that ATF-2 and c-Jun may play a critical role in the induction of c-jun following ischemia and reperfusion, as they appear to do following E1a transformation, and that the initiating mechanism of c-jun induction may be a reperfusion-induced increase in DNA binding activity of ATF-2 and c-Jun. When compared to the time course of binding activity directed at ATF/CRE and jun2TRE oligonucleotides, the binding to a canonical AP-1 motif-containing oligonucleotide (5′-AGCTTGGTGACTCATCCG-3′) was delayed (Fig. 4A). AP-1 binding activity was not apparent until 40 min of reperfusion. Binding increased further at 90 min. Binding was eliminated by incubation with 125-fold excess of unlabeled AP-1 oligonucleotide (data not shown). c-Jun was present in the complex binding the AP-1-containing oligonucleotide, but in contrast to the complexes binding the ATF/CRE and jun2TRE-containing oligonucleotides, ATF-2 was not present (Fig. 4B). These data indicate that c-Jun DNA binding activity is increased after reperfusion of ischemic kidney, but the dimer binding to AP-1 motifs does not include ATF-2 and is likely to be composed of more typical AP-1 dimers such as c-Jun•c-Jun and c-Jun•c-Fos. We performed gel shift assays after nuclear extracts had been exposed to the protein serine phosphatase, phosphatase 2A, to determine whether protein phosphorylation played a role in the enhanced ATF/CRE binding activity. Pretreatment of kidney nuclear extracts with phosphatase 2A prior to gel shift assay reduced the intensity of the shifted band (Fig. 5A). This effect of phosphatase 2A was prevented by heat inactivation of the phosphatase (55°C for 10 min) (Fig. 5A, left) or by co-incubation with the phosphatase 2A inhibitor, okadaic acid (100 nM) (Fig. 5A, right). Incubation of nuclear extracts with okadaic acid alone had no effect. We also explored the role of phosphorylation in the ischemia-induced increase in binding to the jun2TRE. Pre-incubation of nuclear extracts with phosphatase 2A markedly reduced the intensity of the shifted band (Fig. 5B). This effect of phosphatase 2A was inhibited by okadaic acid. These data suggest the phosphorylation state of ATF-2, presumably mediated by an ATF-2 kinase, is the critical determinant of binding of the putative ATF-2•c-Jun dimer to both the ATF/CRE and jun2TRE motifs since dephosphorylation"

https://openalex.org/W1965363899,"Mass spectrometry has been used to demonstrate that vitamin K-dependent carboxylation is a processive post-translational modification (i.e. multiple carboxylations occur during a single association between enzyme and substrate). Purified vitamin K-dependent carboxylase can carboxylate as many as 12 glutamate residues in FIXQ/S, a peptide substrate based on amino acids −18 to 41 of the human blood clotting enzyme factor IX. Mass spectrometry was used to determine the number of γ-carboxyl groups added to FIXQ/S by the carboxylase during an in vitro reaction. Despite the fact that most substrate molecules in a reaction were uncarboxylated, almost all carboxylated FIXQ/S molecules were carboxylated many times. This observation can only be explained by two types of mechanisms. In a processive mechanism, multiple carboxylations could occur during a single substrate binding event. Alternatively, a distributive mechanism could result in the observed behavior if the initial carboxylation event results in a substrate that is additionally carboxylated far more efficiently than the uncarboxylated FIXQ/S. Kinetic experiments and arguments were used to show that the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase is not distributive but rather is one of the first well documented examples of an enzyme that catalyzes a processive post-translational modification.

The vitamin K-dependent carboxylase converts glutamate to carboxyglutamate (Gla) by the addition of CO2 at the γ-position(1.Suttie J.W. Nelsestuen G.L. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 8: 191-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 2.Suttie J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 459-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 3.Suttie J.W.

FASEB J. 1993; 7: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In addition to glutamate and CO2, the reaction requires the cosubstrates O2 and reduced vitamin K. The native substrates for the carboxylase include several proteins central to blood clotting as well as bone Gla protein, matrix Gla protein, and others. Each of these proteins contain a “Gla domain” in which glutamate is converted to Gla. This Gla domain binds Ca2+ and is essential for activity in all of the identified Gla-containing proteins. Efficient carboxylation of the native substrates requires that they contain a conserved region which binds to the carboxylase with a submicromolar affinity constant(6.Pan L.C. Price P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6109-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 7.Knobloch J.E. Suttie J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15334-15337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the blood-clotting factors, this region is contained in an amino-terminal propeptide which is proteolytically removed following carboxylation. Substrates containing this propeptide have Km values 3 to 4 orders of magnitude lower than small peptide substrates that do not contain the propeptide(8.Ulrich M.M.W. Furie B. Jacobs M.R. Vermeer C.

Acta. 1991; 1078: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This suggests that the propeptide acts primarily as a “docking” site which localizes the glutamate residues near the carboxylase active site. Using the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase activity present in solubilized bovine microsomes, we previously reported the introduction of multiple Gla residues into peptide substrates derived from the propeptide and Gla domain of human Factor IX(9.Wu S.-M. Soute B.A.M. Vermeer C. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13124-13129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we use one of those substrates, FIXQ/S (Fig. 1), to investigate the mechanism by which multiple glutamates per substrate are converted to Gla residues during vitamin K-dependent carboxylation. As a consequence of our recent purification of the vitamin K-dependent bovine carboxylase(11.Wu S.-M. Morris D.P. Stafford D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2236-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we can perform in vitro carboxylations from which the carboxylated products can easily be recovered. After suitable purification, the number of Gla residues introduced into the peptide products can be determined by mass spectrometry on the products as they elute from a reverse phase HPLC 1The abbreviations used are: HPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyDTTdithiothreitolCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfateMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidvitamin KH2vitamin K1 hydroquinoneproFIX19AVFLDHENANKILNRPKRY. column. We also found that elution of the various carboxylation states from an anion exchange HPLC column is closely correlated with the extent of carboxylation. This behavior allowed us to perform a series of kinetic experiments to demonstrate that the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase is truly processive. high performance liquid chromatography dithiothreitol 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfate 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid vitamin K1 hydroquinone AVFLDHENANKILNRPKRY. Examples of processive enzymes are very common in the replication and modification of RNA and DNA(12.Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. Freeman, New York1992Google Scholar). However, examples of processive post-translational modification for which there is good supporting evidence appear to be rare. Nevertheless, processive modes of post-translational modification should offer significant advantages in a wide variety of biochemical processes where multiple identical modifications are introduced into a substrate. The few apparent cases of such modifications in the scientific literature reflect this diversity and suggest that processive post-translational modification may be very common. Unlike processivity involving nucleic acids, processive post-translational modification of proteins may often occur in patterns other than a linear sequence along the polymer chain. The vitamin K-dependent γ-glutamyl carboxylase appears to be an excellent model for studying such processes. Vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) at 10 mg/ml was obtained from Abbott Laboratories in the form of a colloidal suspension (Vitamin K1 Injection) which included 7% polyoxylated fatty acid, 3.75% hydrous dextrose, and 0.9% benzyl alcohol. Phosphatidylcholine, type X-E, from dried egg yolk, and CHAPS were from Sigma. NaH14CO3 with a specific activity of 56.4 mCi/mmol was from ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. Carboxylase was affinity-purified as described previously except that either FIXQ/S or proFIX19 was used as the propeptide stabilizer of carboxylase(11.Wu S.-M. Morris D.P. Stafford D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2236-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The fractions of carboxylase used in this study were stored at −70°C and contained 1.2-2 μM FIXQ/S or proFIX19, 0.6-1% CHAPS, 0.1% phosphatidylcholine, 25 mM MOPS (pH 7.4), 1 × protease inhibitor mixture, 500 mM NaCl, and 20% (v/v) glycerol. The carboxylase was eluted with FIXQ/S unless the presence of propeptide is indicated. Carboxylase was quantitated by densitometric scanning of Coomassie-stained gels using IgG as a standard. Molar concentrations of carboxylase were calculated using a molecular mass of 88 kDa(13.Wu S.-M. Cheung W.-F. Frazier D. Stafford D.W. Science. 1991; 254: 1634-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The peptide substrate FIXQ/S was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein and cleaved with cyanogen bromide as described previously(9.Wu S.-M. Soute B.A.M. Vermeer C. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13124-13129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The peptide products dissolved in guanidine HCl were dialyzed against 25 mM MOPS (pH 8.0) with 50 mM NaCl. The soluble FIXQ/S product was collected as described previously(9.Wu S.-M. Soute B.A.M. Vermeer C. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13124-13129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Formylation of cysteine was reversed by incubating FIXQ/S with 20 mM DTT for 4 h at 25°C(14.Kellaris K.V. Ware D.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3469-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The peptide-containing solution was then chilled to 4°C and loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column (20 ml of matrix per 50 mg of protein) equilibrated with 25 mM MOPS (pH 8.0) and 50 mM NaCl. The column was washed with 2 volumes of equilibration buffer, and the protein eluted in 25 mM MOPS (pH 8.0) with a NaCl gradient from 50 to 500 mM NaCl. Vitamin K1 (Abbott Laboratories) at 10 mg/ml was reduced by addition to 3 volumes of buffer containing 200 mM DTT, 500 mM NaCl, and 20 mM Tris (pH 8.5). Full tubes were incubated in darkness at 4°C for at least 36 h to ensure complete reduction. After all additions, reactions to generate sufficient carboxylated FIXQ/S for mass spectrometry included: 5-20 nM carboxylase, 1.3-1.4 μM FIXQ/S, 0.38 mM NaH14CO3, 25 mM MOPS (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, 0.12% phosphatidylcholine, 0.26-0.3% CHAPS, 4% (v/v) glycerol, 0.4 mM EDTA, and 6 mM DTT. Typically, 75 μM vitamin KH2 was added initially, and an additional 37 μM vitamin KH2 was added at 12 h. These later additions increased the DTT concentration slightly above 6 mM. Reactions up to 500 ml were done. To perform a reaction, most of the solution components were combined and placed on ice. After the solution had chilled, purified carboxylase which represented 20% of the final reaction volume was thawed and added to the ice-cold solution. The NaH14CO3 was then added, and the solution was placed in a 17°C water bath for a 1-h preincubation. The reaction was initiated by addition of vitamin KH2 and allowed to proceed for as long as 44 h at 17°C. The progress of the reaction was followed by periodically removing small samples and assaying them for incorporated NaH14CO3 as in previous FLEEL assays(15.Morris D.P. Soute B.A.M. Vermeer C. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8735-8742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the desired time, large reactions were terminated in a fume hood by the addition of acetic acid to a final concentration of 30 mM, resulting in a pH below 5. The remaining steps were done at room temperature in a fume hood. The NaH14CO3 was removed by bubbling N2 gas through the reaction solution for about 30 min. The 14CO2 gas was collected by running the exhaust gas through two consecutive traps containing 0.5 N NaOH. The reaction container was sealed except for tubes leading from the nitrogen and to the NaOH trap. The tube from the nitrogen went to the bottom of the reaction vessel and could be used to remove small amounts of solution. After scintillation counting revealed that more than 99.9% of the free radioactivity had been removed, reaction solutions were neutralized by addition of NaOH to a final concentration of 30 mM and diluted with 1.5 volumes of deionized water. The diluted reaction was combined with 0.04 volume of a 50% slurry of DEAE-Sepharose in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.3, and 50 mM NaCl. The matrix was recovered in minimal volume and loaded into a 2.5-cm diameter column. The column was washed with 2 volumes of column equilibration buffer and eluted with 10 mM Tris (pH 7.3) and 1 M NaCl. Fractions containing 14C-FIXQ/S were determined by scintillation counting a portion of each sample. These fractions were then pooled and frozen. In all experiments and at all stages, peptide samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70°C. All fractions were collected and stored in polypropylene Microfuge tubes. After thawing, a sample was concentrated and desalted on Centricon 3 concentrators (Amicon). This desalted sample was centrifuged (13,000 × g) to remove particulates and loaded onto a 0.46 × 100 mm Rainin Hydropore AX weak anion exchange column equilibrated with 100% buffer A (20 mM Tris, pH 7.2). A sample was loaded using multiple injections over 5-10 min while the flow rate was 1 ml/min. Subsequently, the flow rate was linearly reduced over 1 min to 0.5 ml/min, and the column eluted at 0.5 ml/min as follows: linear gradient to 30% buffer B (20 mM Tris (pH 7.2) and 2 M NaCl) over 12 min, linear gradient to 100% B over 5 min, then at least 10 min at 100% B. Fractions containing radioactivity were pooled, frozen, and stored. To remove uncarboxylated FIXQ/S, fractions containing labeled FIXQ/S were concentrated, desalted, and fractionated a second time on the Hydropore AX column as described above. Eluted fractions were then pooled into groups and frozen. During the above procedures, protein was quantitated from peak area relative to known amounts of FIXQ/S using absorbance at 220 nm. After thawing, each group was centrifuged to remove particulates and loaded directly onto a 0.46 × 50 mm Rainin C18 column (83-203-F5) with matching guard column. Samples were loaded using multiple injections over 10 min during which buffer A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) was flowing at 1 ml/min. After the load period, the flow rate was linearly reduced over 1 min to 0.125 ml/min followed by 2 min at this velocity. Next, a linear elution gradient brought the mobile phase composition to 100% B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 90% acetonitrile) over 10 min. The remaining 15 min of each run was 100% B. Protein-containing fractions were collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and dried by rotary evaporation. Protein was quantitated from peak area relative to known amounts of FIXQ/S using absorbance at either 220 or 280 nm. Each group was resuspended to 1 μg/μl in 25 mM ammonium hydroxide after which acetic acid was added to a final concentration of 15 mM. Each group was aliquoted and frozen. Immediately prior to use, a 10-μl aliquot from each group was thawed and warmed to room temperature. To the sample was added in order: 1 μl of 200 mM DTT, 1 μl of 200 mM ammonium hydroxide, and 1 μl of 20 mM EDTA. A portion of each sample (5 μl) was loaded onto the 2.1 × 150 mm Vydac C4 column (214TP 5215) equilibrated with 90% solution A (0.025% trifluoroacetic acid) and 10% solution B (0.25% trifluoroacetic acid, 90% acetonitrile). The protein was eluted using an ISCO microbore HPLC apparatus at 20 μl/min according to the following gradient: 10% B from 0 to 10 min, linear gradient to 50% B from 10 to 15 min, linear gradient to 90% B from 15 to 40 min, and 90% B from 40 to 45 min. The effluent was monitored at 216 nm and run directly into the mass spectrometer through PEEK tubing (inside diameter 0.0051 cm). Mass measurements were made on a Fisions-VG Quattro BQ triple quadropole mass spectrometer equipped with a pneumatically assisted electrostatic ion source operating at atmospheric pressure. Mass spectra were acquired in the continuum mode from m/e 700-1400 with a scan time of 10 s. The mass scale was calibrated with horse heart myoglobin (16951.48 kDa) with a resolution corresponding to a peak width at half-height of 1.4 Da for m/e 893. The mass spectra were transformed to a molecular mass scale using software supplied by the manufacturer. The average carboxylation state of carboxylated products was estimated using the assumption that the ionization efficiencies of all carboxylation states within a group were the same. From the relative amounts of each carboxylation state in the mass spectrometry profile for a group, the average carboxylation state of the carboxylated products in the group was estimated. The average carboxylation state for each group and the amount of carboxylated peptide in each group was then used to determine the overall average carboxylation state of the product peptides. Changes from the preparative reaction procedure are indicated in the figure legends. For these reactions, recovery of carboxylated and uncarboxylated FIXQ/S by DEAE-Sepharose was done in 15- or 50-ml polypropylene tubes. Low speed centrifugation (2,000 × g) of these tubes allowed essentially complete recovery of the matrix. The carboxylation state of the reaction products from these experiments was estimated from their elution position on the Hydropore AX anion exchange column. For these experiments, the preparative anion exchange HPLC method was modified to the extent that elution gradients were linear from 0-100% buffer B and occurred over 25 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Following an initial burst of activity, carboxylation of the substrate FIXQ/S (Fig. 1) by the purified vitamin K-dependent carboxylase was linear with respect to time for more than 24 h provided the reaction was supplemented periodically with vitamin KH2 (Fig. 2). During this linear period, the average reaction velocity was 10−3 s−1, indicating that one carboxylation occurs per enzyme about every 17 min. In enzymatic reactions, a rapid burst of product formation followed by a slower linear rate of reaction often indicates that product release is rate-limiting for the reaction. These burst phenomena are a consequence of the accumulation of product-enzyme complex from a single substrate binding event and catalysis. In this situation, the size of a burst may indicate the concentration of active enzyme in the reaction and can be determined by linear extrapolation of the linear portion of the progress curve back to zero time. For the experiment in Fig. 2, this method suggests a burst size of 350 nM incorporated CO2 which is well above the 20 nM carboxylase concentration estimated to be present in the reaction. However, it is reasonably close to the concentration of CO2 one would expect to incorporate into 20 nM FIXQ/S if an average of about 7.5 CO2 molecules are incorporated per FIXQ/S molecule (e.g. 150 nM). Data presented later suggest that this average is approximately correct. Imprecision in the quantitation of the carboxylase, which was done on SDS gels by comparison with IgG, could easily account for the remaining difference. The presence of a burst phenomenon which could be explained by multiple carboxylations per binding event suggests a processive reaction with a rate-limiting product release step. The FIXQ/S substrate and the carboxylated peptides were simultaneously recovered from reaction mixtures by batch chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose (see “Materials and Methods”). Recovery of the peptides and the incorporated radioactivity were essentially quantitative when care was taken to recover all of the Sepharose matrix. Because the carboxylated and uncarboxylated peptides were recovered together, it was necessary to separate the much more abundant uncarboxylated FIXQ/S from the carboxylated products if these products were to be analyzed effectively by mass spectrometry. The carboxylated and uncarboxylated forms of FIXQ/S were found to be relatively well separated by weak anion exchange HPLC (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, enough uncarboxylated FIXQ/S trailed the uncarboxylated FIXQ/S peak that it was necessary to combine fractions containing labeled peptide from the initial anion exchange elution and chromatograph them a second time. The absorbance profile from the second of two such sequential anion exchange runs is shown in Fig. 4. For these runs, a low flow rate and steep gradient were used to elute the carboxylated products in a minimum volume.Fig. 4Consecutive anion exchange column runs reduce the amount of uncarboxylated FIXQ/S that coelutes with carboxylated forms of FIXQ/S. FIXQ/S from the reaction in Fig. 2 was desalted and loaded onto the Rainin Hydropore HA anion exchange column (data not shown). Carboxylated FIXQ/S fractions containing fractions from the first anion exchange elution (as indicated by the presence of radioactivity) were combined, desalted, and rerun as before. The FIXQ/S from the second elution (shown above) was pooled into six groups labeled G1 to G6 as indicated. Quantitation during reverse phase HPLC indicate that the groups contained the following amounts of protein: G2, 44 μg; G3, 33 μg; G4, 20 μg; G5, 40 μg; G6, 143 μg. See “Materials and Methods” for details.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since increasing carboxylation of a peptide would result in a more negatively charged product, it seemed reasonable that more highly carboxylated peptides would elute from the anion exchange column at higher salt concentrations. As shown below, this behavior was observed and explains the broad range of salt concentrations at which the products elute from the anion exchange column. Prior to mass spectrometry, fractions from the second anion exchange column were combined into groups (Fig. 4), and each group was run on a C18 reverse phase column using a low flow rate elution (data not shown). For each group, a single major peptide peak eluted at essentially the same point late in the gradient. The elution profile of later groups (G5 and G6 in Fig. 4) also contained a moderate size peak just after the FIXQ/S peak. Mass spectrometry of material from this peak revealed a 70510-Da protein that was not investigated further. This reverse phase HPLC step concentrates the peptide and removes both salts and a 280 nm absorbing contaminant. The low flow rate allowed easy rotary evaporation of the samples with minimum peptide loss. Even after reverse phase HPLC purification, mass spectrometry on carboxylated material with more than 2 Gla residues could not be done directly. Under the acidic conditions required for positive ion mass spectrometry, peptide precipitation was a problem. Even when precipitates were removed by centrifugation, highly carboxylated FIXQ/S blocked the injection tubing on the mass spectrophotometer. Use of a wide bore PEEK tubing reduced this problem; however, unidentified adducted forms of the peptide dominated the mass distribution. Negative ion mass spectrometry was tried and also produced unidentifiable adducted species. Our initial attempts at mass spectrometry did reveal that the FIXQ/S starting material included multiple 28-dalton additions. This modification almost certainly represents formyl groups added to the cysteine residues during cyanogen bromide cleavage of the fusion protein and could be reversed by longer treatment with the reducing agent DTT(14.Kellaris K.V. Ware D.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3469-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It should be noted that serine or threonine residues may also be formylated by cyanogen bromide cleavage in formic acid; however, this modification should not be reversible with DTT(16.Goodlett D.R. Armstrong F.B. Creech J. Van Breemen R.B. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 186: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A second species of peptide that was 28 daltons less than the observed mass of FIXQ/S was also observed. We have not been able to identify the modification responsible but it appears not to affect carboxylation (see below). As a solution to the problems mentioned above, we turned to direct mass spectrometry of FIXQ/S as it eluted from a reverse phase microbore column. With this technique, even groups containing highly carboxylated FIXQ/S yielded high resolution data (Fig. 5). As indicated by their presence in the later groups, the higher carboxylation states eluted from the anion exchange HPLC column at higher salt concentrations. All 13 of the possible carboxylation states (0 to 12 added CO2 groups) are clearly evident. Each carboxylation state has a companion peak which is 28 daltons lighter than itself. As mentioned above, this modification is evident in uncarboxylated FIXQ/S. The even distribution of this form across the carboxylation states suggests that the modification has no effect upon carboxylation. The observed molecular mass of uncarboxylated FIXQ/S was 6954.2 daltons, in good agreement with the expected average mass of 6954.6 daltons. The mass difference between the carboxylation states is 45.3 daltons, corresponding to a specific activity of 40.3 mCi/mmol for the incorporated carbon atom. The added NaH14CO3 had a specific activity of 56.4 mCi/mmol, but the presence of cold endogenous bicarbonate in the reaction solutions results in some dilution. Quantitation of the average carboxylation state of the product peptides was simplified by the similar ionization efficiencies observed for the various carboxylation states. Under identical mass spectrometry conditions, the relative signal intensities from identical amounts of groups 2 though 6 in Fig. 5 were, respectively, 96:100:80:66:51. The fact that the different groups have similar ionization efficiencies argues strongly that the ionization efficiencies of the different carboxylation states within a single group will have similar ionization efficiencies. This allows a reasonably accurate estimate of average carboxylation state of the products by the algorithm given under “Materials and Methods.” Because the peak containing highly carboxylated product (G6 in Fig. 5) contains most of the product peptide (Fig. 4), this material dominates the average, which is approximately 7.5 carboxylations per carboxylated product. While an estimate of the possible error in this average is difficult, even unreasonably extreme assumptions about relative ionization efficiencies of similar species within a group would result in a change in the average of less than 1 carboxylation per peptide. Given that most of the FIXQ/S molecules present in the reaction were uncarboxylated, the relatively high degree of carboxylation among those peptides that were carboxylated suggests a processive mechanism in which many or all of the available glutamates are carboxylated during a single association between the carboxylase and the substrate. A carboxylation mechanism of this type is outlined in Fig. 6A. In a processive mechanism, the rate of release of the product must be slower than the rate of chemical reaction if multiply modified forms are to be produced during a single association between enzyme and substrate. Even if dissociation and reassociation of the partially carboxylated products does occur, it should be minimal prior to accumulation of significant product. The above data suggest a processive mechanism; however, one other type of mechanism that does not involve processivity could result in apparently processive behavior. If product release is rapid relative to the carboxylation (i.e. the reaction is distributive, not processive), it is still possible for highly carboxylated FIXQ/S to predominate as product, if the carboxylated peptides are dramatically better substrates than the uncarboxylated peptide (Fig. 6B). In other words, if the initial carboxylation event were to result in a large increase in the carboxylation efficiency of the singly carboxylated FIXQ/S as compared to the uncarboxylated FIXQ/S, and if this increase in efficiency were maintained throughout the remaining carboxylation events, then the carboxylated forms could out compete the far more abundant uncarboxylated FIXQ/S. We have termed this special case of a distributive mechanism the “efficiency-enhanced” distributive mechanism to reflect the central requirement that the efficiency of modification of the intermediate product forms be enhanced relative to the original substrate. It is important to recognize that the processive and efficiency-enhanced distributive mechanisms are the only way to explain up to 12 carboxylations in FIXQ/S while most substrate molecules remain uncarboxylated. The most direct way to demonstrate efficiency-enhanced distributive behavior would be to show that partially carboxylated FIXQ/S including the singly carboxylated form is preferentially carboxylated in a reaction containing both carboxylated and uncarboxylated FIXQ/S. However, when a reaction was performed which contained FIXQ/S and the precarboxylated material from group 3 (0 to 2 carboxylations, see Fig. 5), both the uncarboxylated and previously carboxylated peptides were similarly carboxylated (Fig. 7). Quantitation of the carboxylation rate for both uncarboxylated and previously carboxylated peptides is difficult due to low conversion rates and variable backgrounds. Nevertheless, the amount of radiolabeled (precarboxylated) and unradiolabeled (not previously carboxylated) peptide converted to the peak which elutes at the same location as material from group 6 (6 to 12 carboxylations, see Fig. 5) was more than 1% and less than 3% of starting material in each case (Fig. 7). These similar conversion rates indicate that the carboxylation states present have similar carboxylation efficiencies. This result is inconsistent with the substantial enhancement in carboxylation efficiency of the intermediate products required for a distributive mechanism to appear processive. To demonstrate the extent of this inconsistency, we performed a carboxylation reaction with 1.3 μM FIXQ/S and a carboxylase concentration of 0.1 nM. Under these conditions, less than 0.4 nM NaH14CO3 was incorporated into the peptide during the course of the reaction; nevertheless, the extent of carboxylation as indicated by the elution pattern of the radiolabeled peptide on anion exchange HPLC (Fig. 8) was essentially the same as observed previously (Fig. 3). For the vastly more abundant uncarboxylated FIXQ/S (1300 nM) to be out competed by the carboxylated forms (below 0.4 nM) for an average of about 7.5 carboxylations would require these forms to be carboxylated more than 3250-fold more efficiently than FIXQ/S. As shown above, this was not the case. In addition, over the range of enzyme concentrations which have been tried (0.1 to 20 nM), the production of the carboxylated forms was proportional to the carboxylase concentration (data not shown). Because the concentration of enzyme affects the concentration of intermediates, this would not in general be the case for an efficiency-enhanced distributive mechanism. On the other hand, both a similar distribution of carboxylation states and reaction rate proportionality would be expected from a processive enzymatic reaction. The concentration of carboxylase would not affect the distribution of carboxylation states resulting from an association between an enzyme and substrate. In addition, since the reaction velocity expected from a processive mechanism is not affected by the concentration of carboxylated intermediates, the processive mechanism would predict a carboxylation rate proportional to the enzyme concentration when the substrate concentration is essentially constant and not limiting. A possible difficulty encountered in the above experiments was the presence of propeptide (FIX19) from the purified carboxylase that was used. Fortunately, the presence of propeptide should not affect the experimental outcomes. The concentration of FIXQ/S (1.0 μM) in these experiments was sufficiently above the concentration at half-maximal velocity (0.6 μM), observed in the presence of 0.4 μM propeptide (as in Fig. 7) that most of the carboxylase was bound to FIXQ/S. This observation shows that the carboxylated forms of FIXQ/S are competing primarily with uncarboxylated FIXQ/S rather than with propeptide. Examination of the efficiency-enhanced distributive mechanism (Fig. 6B) suggests a second independent method for testing carboxylase behavior against this mechanism. The mechanism is a complicated case of a common situation in enzymology: multiple substrates competing for a single enzyme. For the case in which two substrates compete for an enzyme, the relative velocity of conversion of each substrate is given by (17.Ferscht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanisms. 2nd Ed. Freeman, New York1985: 111Google Scholar). Importantly, the relative reaction velocity is dependent upon the concentrations of both substrates. Extending this simple example to the more complicated situation in our carboxylation reaction, it is still clear that, as the concentration of the carboxylated intermediates increase, the relative rates of carboxylation of uncarboxylated and carboxylated FIXQ/S molecules must change, since the concentration of uncarboxylated FIXQ/S is essentially constant. Similarly, the relative rates of carboxylation of different carboxylation states should change relative to one another. However, as data in Table 1 show, during a time course of carboxylation from 1-22 h, the proportion of carboxylated peptide with about the same anion exchange elution times as Group 3/4 (1-3 carboxylations), Group 5 (3-6 carboxylations), and Group 6 (6-12 carboxylations) were unchanged. Thus, at changing levels of intermediates, additional uncarboxylated FIXQ/S continues to be recruited for carboxylation at the same rate as the carboxylated forms. Once again, this behavior is not consistent with an efficiency-enhanced distributive mechanism; however, it is exactly that expected from a processive mechanism as the concentration of unbound intermediates should have no effect on the distribution of carboxylation states resulting from an association between an enzyme and substrate.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab For the in vitro carboxylation reaction, only two types of mechanisms could explain how as many as 12 carboxylations occur in carboxylated FIXQ/S molecules, while most substrate molecules remain uncarboxylated. One of these mechanisms, which we have termed the efficiency-enhanced distributive mechanism, is not consistent with the behavior observed for the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase. Neither was partially carboxylated FIXQ/S more efficiently carboxylated than FIXQ/S nor was the reaction velocity and the distribution of the carboxylation states dependent upon the concentration of partially carboxylated FIXQ/S as would be expected for this mechanism. In contrast, the observed behavior of the carboxylase agrees with that expected from a processive mechanism in which multiple modifications of the substrate molecule occur during a single association between the enzyme and the substrate. In a processive mechanism, the degree of substrate modification should be unaffected by enzyme, substrate, or low partially modified product concentrations, since these variables should not affect the modification process once binding has occurred. In addition, the reaction velocity should be unaffected by low levels of partially modified intermediates and should be linearly proportional to the carboxylase concentration when substrate is not limiting. All of these behaviors were observed during the multiple carboxylation of FIXQ/S by the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase. A processive carboxylation reaction is also consistent with the size and duration of the burst phenomenon observed during time courses of carboxylation. Given the inaccuracy of the method used to quantitate the carboxylase, the size of the burst is in reasonable agreement with the carboxylase concentration when it is recognized that an average of about 7.5 carboxylations occur during a single association between carboxylase and FIXQ/S. For enzymatic reactions where it has been demonstrated that burst behavior is a reflection of rate-limiting product release, the size of the burst is often the preferred method of determining the concentration of active enzyme. For the carboxylase, this suggests that gel quantitation results in an underestimation of the true carboxylase concentration by a factor of about 2.3-fold. The processive carboxylation of an average of about 7.5 glutamate residues during a single enzyme/substrate association when combined with an average time per carboxylation per enzyme of 17 min implies that an average substrate molecule is remaining bound to the carboxylase for about 127 min. Thus, the half-time for a substrate to be bound is about 63.5 min, which qualitatively agrees with the time at which the burst is half-completed (see Fig. 2). For each of the experiments presented, it may be possible to suggest unlikely formal possibilities that could result in the observed behavior. However, taken in total, we believe these experiments demonstrate that the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase is a processive post-translational modification enzyme. It should be recognized that the partial carboxylation observed in many of the in vitro reaction products is probably due to the unnatural environment of the carboxylase rather than a characteristic of the in vivo mechanism. It is difficult to imagine why processive carboxylation in vivo would not proceed to complete carboxylation of the substrate as complete carboxylation is necessary for the expression of the calcium-dependent, functionally essential domain conformation. Unanswered questions relating to the manner in which the carboxylase recognizes complete carboxylation of its native substrates are central to a full understanding of the mechanism of the carboxylase. This is particularly true as carboxylation does not appear to proceed in a linear sequence along the polymer chain, 2D. Morris, D. Wright, and D. Stafford, manuscript in preparation. making this reaction very different from the linear processivity observed in replication, transcription, and translation(12.Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. Freeman, New York1992Google Scholar). Interestingly, very few examples of the processive post-translational modification of amino acids have been reported. Most post-translational modifications for which the mechanism is understood involve binding to a particular amino acid and/or recognition site, performing a modification on a single amino acid and releasing the product. There are, however, examples of post-translational modification which are probably processive. Convincing evidence that ubiquitin-protein ligase (18.Hershko A. Heller H. Eytan E. Reiss Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11992-11999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar) is processive has been presented. Pulse/chase experiments with analysis during the presteady state period were used to demonstrate multiple ubiquitin additions during a single enzyme/substrate association. Evidence suggests that ubiquitination of histones by ubiquitin carrier protein (19.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar, 20.Haas A.L. Bright P.M. Jackson V.E. J. Biol.

Dynan W.S. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 426-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 22.Dvir A. Stein L.Y. Calore B.L. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10440-10447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) may be processive. These three cases and vitamin K-dependent carboxylation are examples of a type of processivity that results from the association of enzyme and substrate at a binding site distinct from the modifiable residues, followed by modification at these residues. A second class of processive post-translational modifications may be represented by the hydroxylation of proline by prolyl hydrolase(23.De Jong L. Van Der Kraan I. De Waal A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1079: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Prolyl hydrolase has two active sites and modifies protein collagen at a large number of sites. The enzyme probably remains bound to at least one and often two prolyl sites on the substrate for a period of time during which many hydroxylations occur. Coincidentally, other work in our laboratory may fit this method of processivity. The coagulation protease Factor XIa exists as a dimer with two active sites. In the intrinsic blood coagulation pathway, Factor XIa cleaves its substrate Factor IX at two sites generating the active protease Factor IXa. In our laboratory, both cleavages occur without the generation of an intermediate. 3A. Wolberg, unpublished observation. An apparent lack of intermediate products is compatible only with a processive mechanism or with the less likely efficiency-enhanced distributive mechanism. Because processivity is possible for any enzyme which multiply modifies a substrate and which has two binding sites on the substrate, it seems likely that processive post-translational modification is a common phenomenon. Unlike processivity involving nucleic acids, processive post-translational modification will often occur in patterns other than a linear sequence along the polymer chain. This should have profound consequences for the mechanisms of processive post-translational modification enzymes. It appears that the mechanism of vitamin K-dependent carboxylation is an excellent model for studying these enzymes."

One was thought to be the cognate of the human NPY-Y1 receptor, termed Y1α receptor, and the other form, termed Y1β receptor, differed from the Y1α receptor in the seventh transmembrane domain and C-terminal tail. Analysis of the mouse genomic DNA showed that both receptors originated from a single gene. The different peptide sequences of the Y1β receptor were encoded by separate exons, hence, these receptors were generated by differential RNA splicing. High affinity binding of [125I]NPY to each receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and sequestration of [125I]NPY after binding to each receptor were observed. In the CHO cells expressing the Y1α receptor, intracellular Ca2+ increase, inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation were observed by stimulation of NPY, and these responses were abolished by pretreatment with pertussis toxin. Since wortmannin completely inhibited NPY-elicited MAPK activation, we speculate that wortmannin-sensitive signaling molecule(s) such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase may lie between pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein and MAPK. In contrast, these intracellular signals were not detected in CHO cells expressing the Y1β receptor.

NPY is highly conserved in primary structure among species as sequences of human, rabbit, rat, and mouse are identical and differ from the porcine sequence by only a single amino acid(2.Tatemoto K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5485-5489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar). It belongs to a peptide family that also includes peptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP)(3.Glover I.D. Barlow D.J. Pitts J.E. Wood S.P. Tickle I.J. Blundell T.L. Tatemoto K. Kimmel J.R.

NPY is widely distributed in the brain (4.Wahlestedt C. Ekman R. Widerlöv E. Prog. NeuropsychoPharmacol. Biol.

Studies of various organs and cell types with peptide fragments of NPY have indicated that multiple NPY receptor subtypes exist(6.Michel M.C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 389-394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The two major receptor subtypes have been designated Y1 and Y2, and the Y1 receptor has the ability to respond to an analog of NPY modified at residues 31 and 34 ([Leu31,Pro34]NPY)(7.Fuhlendorff J. Gether U. Aakerlund L. Langeland-Johansen N. Thögersen H. Melberg S.G. Olsen U.B. Thastrup O. Schwartz T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To isolate the common region of both receptors and Y1β receptor specific exon, the EcoRI-PstI fragment of the Y1α receptor and 3′-untranslated region of the Y1β receptor were used as probes, respectively. Isolated clones were subcloned into the NotI site of pBluescript SK- vector and analyzed by restriction digestion and partial sequencing. Mouse genomic DNA was purchased from Clontech. The mouse genomic DNA was digested with BamHI, PstI, HindIII, KpnI, or XhoI. The fragments were separated by electrophoresis on an 0.8% agarose gel, transferred onto a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+), then hybridized with a αP-labeled EcoRI-PstI fragment of the NPY-Y1α receptor. Hybridization was carried out at 65°C for 2 h in Rapid Hybridization Buffer and the filter was washed at 65°C for 30 min in 0.2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS. RT-PCR analysis was carried out using poly(A)+ RNA isolated from mouse bone marrow cells. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized using First-strand Synthesis Kit (Pharmacia). The forward oligonucleotide primers were derived from the common region to the Y1α and Y1β receptor (SP1: 5′-CCCATCT GACTCTCACAGGCTGTCT-3′ and SP2: 5′-AGATATACATTCGCTTGAAAAGGAG-3′) and the reverse primers were derived from the unique regions of the Y1α receptor (aAP1, 5′-TAAAAGATGGGGTTGACGCAGGTGG-3′; and aAP2, 5′-CATGGTAGACATGGCTATGGTCTCG-3′) and the Y1β receptor (bAP1, 5′-AGTCAACGCAAACATGAGTACCCCC-3′; and bAP2, 5′-ATGGAAATACATCAGGCTCAGAGGC-3′), respectively. PCR was performed using 1 μg of the synthesized cDNA with 30 cycles of 1 min of denaturation at 94°C, 2 min of annealing at 57°C, and 1 min of extension at 72°C. The amplified products were separated by electrophoresis on an 0.8% agarose gel, transferred onto a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+), then hybridized with a αP-labeled probe. The probe DNA fragment (170 bp long) was prepared by PCR reaction, using the following primers P1 (5′-ATGGACAAGATCCGGGACAG-3′) and P2 (5′-AGCAGATTGTGGTTGCAGGT-3′) and the Y1α receptor cDNA as a template, under the thermal cycling conditions described above. Hybridization was carried out at 65°C for 2 h in Rapid Hybridization Buffer and the filter was washed at 65°C for 30 min in 0.2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS. CHO-K1 cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium containing 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. For all experiments, cells were grown at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Each full-length cDNA fragment (Y1α or Y1β receptor) was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNAI/neo and the plasmid was transfected into CHO-K1 cells by electroporation. Stably transfected cells were selected in medium containing 1 mg/ml geneticin (G418, Sigma) and clonal cell lines were obtained by limiting dilution. G418-resistant clones were expanded and tested for the ability to bind [125I]NPY. Cell membranes of these transfected cells, prepared as described previously(25.Nakamura M. Honda Z. Izumi T. Sakanaka C. Mutoh H. Minami M. Bito H. Seyama Y. Matsumoto T. Noma M. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20400-20405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were resuspended in ice-cold assay buffer I (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mM CaCl2, 5 mM KCl, 120 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1% bacitracin). Each type of cell membranes was incubated with various concentrations (Scatchard plot analysis) or 1.0 nM (displacement experiments) of [125I]NPY in 0.2 ml of assay buffer II (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mM CaCl2, 5 mM KCl, 120 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 0.1% bacitracin) at 25°C for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by adding 2 ml of ice-cold assay buffer II, and the unbound radioactive component was removed by rapid filtration. The bound radioactivity was measured in a γ-counter (1470 WIZARD, Pharmacia). The protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (26.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (209612) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Transfected cells (2 × 105 cells) were cultured in 12-well plates. [125I]NPY binding was measured on whole cell monolayers, as described(21.Krause J. Eva C. Seeburg P.H. Sprengel R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 817-821PubMed Google Scholar). To determine internalized [125I]NPY, monolayers were treated for 3 min with 200 mM Gly-HCl, pH 3, 200 mM NaCl (subsequent to binding incubation) to remove [125I]NPY bound to the exterior surface of the cells, then the acid-resistant (internalized) radioactivities were measured as described(27.Segaloff D.L.

The cells were incubated in HEPES/Tyrode buffer containing 3 μM Fura-2-pentaacetoxymethyl ester (Fura-2/AM) (Dojin) for 1.5 h at room temperature. Measurements of intracellular Ca concentration in the Fura-2-loaded cells were performed as described previously(31.Nakamura M. Honda Z. Waga I. Matsumoto T. Noma M. Shimizu T. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Five × 104 cells were plated in a 24-well plate 48 h before the assay. For experiments using PTX, PTX (50 ng/ml) was added to the medium 24 h before the assay. Thirty min prior to the addition of the ligand to the medium we added 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma), then switched to a serum-free medium containing the indicated concentrations of NPY, 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and 20 μM forskolin. After a 30-min incubation at 37°C, the reaction was stopped and the cells lysed by the addition of the final 6% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, then left at −80°C. cAMP was measured using a cAMP Assay Kit (Amersham), according to the manufacturer's protocol. MAPK activity was measured as described(32.Sakanaka C. Ferby I.M. Waga I. Bito H. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), using myelin basic protein as a substrate. Cell lysates were run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (10% polyacrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were then probed with anti-Erk-2 monoclonal antibody and a peroxidase-labeled second antibody. The antibody staining was visualized with an ECL Detection System (Amersham). Mouse Multiple Tissue Northern blot and Mouse Embryo Multiple Tissue Northern blot were purchased from Clontech that contained 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from various sources. Hybridization was carried out at 65°C for 2 h in Rapid Hybridization Buffer, and the filter was washed at 65°C for 30 min in 0.2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS. The Y1α receptor and the Y1β receptor specific regions (3′-untranslated regions) were used as probes, respectively. A human NPY-Y1 receptor cDNA was cloned from a human brain cDNA library(18.Herzog H. Hort Y.J. Ball H.J. Hayes G. Shine J. Selbie L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5794-5798Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 19.Larhammar D. Blomqvist A.G. Yee F. Jazin E. Yoo H. Wahlestedt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10935-10938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This receptor consists of 384 amino acids and has seven putative transmembrane domains, as noted in other members of the G-protein coupled receptor superfamily. Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we found that mRNA encoding the human NPY-Y1 receptor was expressed not only in brain, kidney, and lung, but also in bone marrow cells, whereas it was not observed in vascular endothelial cells, smooth muscle, and leukocytes (Fig. 1). To determine the functional role of the NPY-Y1 receptor in bone marrow cells, we isolated and sequenced mouse NPY-Y1 receptors from a mouse bone marrow cell cDNA library. Upon screening of approximately 5 × 105 plaques of the bone marrow cell cDNA library, using the human NPY-Y1 receptor fragment as a probe, we obtained 2 positive clones. One of the isolated clones, represented by Y1α receptor, has a 2279-bp insert DNA containing a 1146-bp open reading frame. Since analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence indicates that the polypeptide encoded by this cDNA has seven transmembrane regions typical of G-protein coupled receptors and is 93% homologous to the human NPY-Y1 receptor, it is thought to be the mouse homologue of the NPY-Y1 receptor (Fig. 2A, a and b). The cytoplasmic tail of this receptor contains 6 serine residues and 4 threonine residues, as possible phosphate acceptors, and as observed in the human NPY-Y1 receptor. Furthermore, there seem to be four N-linked glycosylation sites in the N-terminal domain and the extracellular loops. We then characterized the other clone represented by Y1β receptor. The sequence was identical to the Y1α receptor from the 5′-untranslated region to the third extracellular region, but was completely different in the seventh transmembrane, the cytoplasmic tail and 3′-untranslated region (Fig. 2A, a and c). Addition of different DNA fragments at position 908 (numbering from the first base of the coding sequence) of the Y1α receptor created another reading frame downstream from this junction, which extends the coding region to a new stop codon located 14 bp downstream. As a consequence, a 79-amino acid C-terminal fragment of the Y1α receptor was replaced with a new 4-amino acid fragment in the C-terminal end of the Y1β receptor. Thus, the Y1β receptor does not carry part of the seventh transmembrane and C-terminal tail (Fig. 2B). To confirm the existence of two forms of mouse NPY-Y1 receptor in mouse bone marrow cells, RT-PCR analysis was carried out with template cDNAs constructed with mRNAs of the bone marrow cells. As shown in Fig. 3, the amplified products corresponding to each clone were detected. Thus, mRNAs encoding two isoforms of mouse NPY-Y1 receptor exist in bone marrow cells. To determine whether or not Y1α and Y1β receptors are produced from a single gene, genomic structure of the mouse NPY-Y1 receptor was characterized. First, Southern blot analysis of the mouse genomic DNA indicated the presence of single BamHI, PstI, HindIII, KpnI, and XhoI restriction fragments, when probed with the EcoRI-PstI fragment which corresponds to a part of the common region to both Y1α and Y1β receptor cDNAs (Fig. 4a). This means that the Y1α and Y1β receptors originated from a single gene. Upon screening of approximately 1.5 × 106 plaques of a mouse genomic library with the above probe (the EcoRI-PstI fragment), we obtained 5 positive clones. One of the isolated clones (λMY1α2), approximately 23 kbp, was analyzed in detail. Restriction mapping of this clone is shown in Fig. 4b. Partial sequence and Southern blot analysis revealed that this clone contained the entire Y1α receptor open reading frame, including the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (Fig. 2A, a and b, and Fig. 4b), but not the Y1β receptor-specific region (Fig. 2c). The mouse genomic library was thus rescreened using a DNA probe corresponding to the Y1β receptor-specific cDNA sequences: at positions 980 to 1300 (320 bases) of the Y1β receptor (Fig. 2A, c). Screening of approximately 1.5 × 106 plaques yielded 3 positive clones. One of the isolated clones (λMY1β11), approximately 13 kbp, was extensively characterized. Restriction mapping, sequencing of the partial fragments that hybridized to the probes, and comparison with the both receptor cDNAs allowed for determination of the intron/exon structure of the NPY-Y1 receptor gene. As shown in Fig. 4b, the Y1α receptor has at least two introns. The first intron, approximately 6.4 kbp long, was located at −147/-148 in the 5′-untranslated region of the Y1α receptor. Since the major transcriptional start points of the mouse NPY-Y1 receptor were determined at positions −167, −182, −238, −247, and −263 in the 5′-untranslated region(33.Eva C. Oberto A. Sprengel R. Genazzani E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the first exon consists of about 20~120 bp. The second intron (108 bp long) is located just after the proposed fifth transmembrane domain at position 697. A similar organization (locations of first and second introns) was observed in the human NPY-Y1 receptor gene(34.Herzog H. Baumgartner M. Vivero C. Selbie L.A. Auer B. Shine J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6703-6707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Y1β receptor is produced by RNA splicing of the third intron, more than 15 kbp long, located downstream from position 908 of the Y1α receptor. Sequences around the putative junctions are shown in Fig. 4c. These sequences fit well with the proposed consensus sequences for RNA splicing. These results taken together indicate that the variation in C-terminal peptides could be produced by alternative splicing of mRNA from the single gene encoding the mouse NPY-Y1 receptor. The (TG)29 and (GC)10 sequences, alternating purine/pyrimidine repeat, and the potential left-handed Z-DNA-forming sequences(35.Hamada H. Kakunaga T.

Although the function of these sequences is unknown, the potential Z-DNA-forming sequences in the third intron might play a substantial role for splicing of the Y1β receptor mRNA. To examine ligand binding properties and signal transduction through each receptor, the coding region of each clone was subcloned in a mammalian expression vector and transfected into CHO-K1 cells (termed CHO-NPYα for the Y1α receptor and CHO-NPYβ for the Y1β receptor). [125I]NPY specifically bound to membranes from the CHO-NPYα and the CHO-NPYβ cells. The results of Scatchard plot analysis of the specific [125I]NPY binding to each receptor showed that both receptors exhibited indistinguishable binding affinities with dissociation constants (Kd) of 1.0 ± 0.3 nM (mean ± S.D., n = 3) for Y1α rec"

A variety of in vitro techniques in many biological systems have been used to implicate CaM in nuclear activities. The nucleus contains several CaM-binding proteins (1.Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 24aCrossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) including protein kinases and phosphatases(2.Ohta Y. Ohba T. Miyamoto E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the present study, the MLCK CaM binding domain was used to design a synthetic concatemer gene that would target and functionally neutralize CaM in the nuclei of cultured cells and in lung epithelium of transgenic mice.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning and Expression of MLCK Peptide Gene in E. coliA synthetic gene (72 bp) containing an ATG initiation codon and XmaI restriction enzyme sites at each end was designed to encode the rabbit skeletal muscle MLCK CaM-binding sequence, KRRWKKNFIAVSAANRFKK. The respective coding and complimentary oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned into the XmaI site of pBluescript SK (Stratagene) using T4 DNA ligase. Proper orientation of the MLCK peptide gene was confirmed by dideoxy DNA sequencing (United States Biochemical Corp.). A BamHI-EcoRI fragment containing the coding sequence was released from pBSK and fused to the 3′ end of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene using the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the bacterial expression vector pGEX-2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The GST-MLCK peptide fusion protein (30.6 kDa) was induced in Escherichia coli SURE cells (Stratagene) with 100 μM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside for 2 h and purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmacia).Purification and Assay of CaM-dependent Protein Kinase IICaM kinase II was purified from rabbit brain using Ca2+-dependent binding to CaM-Sepharose(12.Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1818-1822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme reactions (50 μl) were performed at 30°C in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 mM calcium chloride, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont NEN), 0.1 μg of CaM kinase II, and 0.5 μg of myelin basic protein, with or without 0.5 μg of calmodulin as indicated. Synthetic MLCK peptide or purified GST-MLCK peptide fusion protein at the indicated concentrations were added. The reaction was terminated after 30 s with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min and the resulting pellets dissolved in 150 μl of SDS sample buffer and separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and autoradiographed.Production and Affinity Purification of Anti-MLCK Peptide AntibodiesInitial injections into four individual rabbits were performed using KRRWKKNFIAVSAANRFKK coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH, Sigma). The quality of the peptide was confirmed by fast atom mass spectroscopy. Six milligrams of the peptide were mixed with an equal weight of KLH and suspended in distilled water (pH 5.0); 5 mg of carbodiimide (Pierce) was dissolved in the mixture. A second 6 mg:6 mg mixture of the peptide and KLH was suspended in 125 mM borate (pH 8.4) containing 75 mM NaCl and 5 mg of dimethylsuberimidate. Both mixtures were allowed to react overnight in the dark at room temperature. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 0.1 M ethanolamine. For the first injection, each rabbit received a 2-mg peptide equivalent of the mixture emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant. The second injection, 30 days later, contained 1 mg of peptide equivalent emulsified in 1/10 complete Freund's adjuvant. The third and fourth injections were on days 45 and 60, respectively. Each boost contained 1 mg of free peptide in incomplete adjuvant. The animals were bled on day 75 and every 2 weeks thereafter.Affinity columns were constructed using 5 mg of the free peptide dissolved in 125 mM borate (pH 8.4) containing 75 mM NaCl and 5 ml of CNBr-activated Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) Immune sera were centrifuged (10,000 × g for 15 min) and 5 ml applied to the affinity resin. The column was washed with 100 ml of 0.1 M NaHCO3 (pH 8.4) containing 0.5 M NaCl. The bound IgG was eluted with 0.1 M glycine (pH 2.7) and immediately neutralized to pH 7.4 with 1 M Tris (pH 9.0).Expression and Localization of the MLCK Peptide Gene in Mammalian COS-7 Cells5′-CGTACTCGGGATGAAGAGAAGATGG-3′ and 5′-ACTACCCGAGCTTCTTGAATCTGTT-3′ were designed to incorporate an AvaI restriction enzyme site “CTCGGG” at each end of the monomer gene in pBluescript SK using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Following AvaI digestion, the amplified monomer genes (66 bp) were self-ligated using T4 DNA ligase in a head-to-tail manner. The ligation mixture was blunt-ended using Klenow and cloned into the SmaI site of pBluescript SK (Stratagene). Clones that contained different lengths and proper orientation of concatemer genes were confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing. Amino acids Leu and Gly, which are encoded by the AvaI site, CTCGGG, acted as a spacer between each monomer peptide. The Kozak initiation sequence (13.Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and an XbaI site were incorporated into the 5′ PCR primer 5′-CTAGCTAGCGCCACCATGGGACCCCTCGGGATGAAG-3′. A SmaI site and a stop codon were designed into the 3′ PCR primer 5′-CCCCTCGAGATTCGTACCGTACCTGCAGCCCCCGAG-3′. A four-repeat MLCK peptide gene (318 bp), which is a XbaI-SmaI fragment, was subcloned into the XbaI and SmaI sites of the eukaryotic expression vector pSVL (Pharmacia). This vector contains the SV40 late promoter, a VP1 intron, and the SV40 polyadenylation signal. COS cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. Recombinant DNA (20 μg) was purified using a Qiagen Maxi Kit and was transiently transfected into COS-7 cells by the calcium-phosphate precipitation method(31.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E.

Transfected cells were grown on 22 × 22-mm coverslips. At 24, 48, or 72 h after transfection, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in −20°C acetone. The fixed cells were incubated for 1 h with affinity-purified rabbit anti-MLCK peptide antibody, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with fluorescein-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit IgG. Double-stained cells were also incubated for 1 h with 10% normal rabbit serum, followed by affinity-purified sheep anti-calmodulin antibody and CY3-conjugated rabbit anti-sheep IgG (Jackson Laboratories). The coverslips were then mounted and photographed using Kodak Elite 200 Ektachrome film with a Nikon Microflex UFX exposure attachment mounted on a Nikon Optiphot epifluorescence microscope and the appropriate Nikon fluorescence filter cubes.Targeted Expression of MLCK Peptide Gene to the Lung Epithelium of Transgenic MiceThe transgene is composed of the 3.7-kb HindIII-HindIII fragment of human SP-C promoter, 318-bp NheI-XhoI fragment of a four-repeat MLCK peptide gene, and 850-bp XhoI-BamHI fragment of SV40 intervening sequence and polyadenylation signal. The 4.8-kb transgene was excised from pBluescript KS by SalI and NotI digestion, separated on 1.0% agarose gel, and purified by Geneclean (Bio101 Inc.). This DNA was dissolved in 10 mM Tris (pH 8.3) and 0.1 mM EDTA and microinjected into donor eggs of mouse strain FVB/N by the University of Cincinnati Transgenic Animal Core Facility. Founder mice were identified by PCR amplification of DNA isolated from tail-clippings using primer 5′-AGCTTGATATCGAATTCCTG-3′ (specific for human SP-C) and the 3′ primer, 5′-GCAAGCAAGAGTTCTATTCA-3′ (specific for the 3′ untranslated region of SV40). The PCR product was a 703-bp fragment of the MLCK peptide transgene. Four surviving founder mice were identified from 83 pups delivered by surrogate mothers. Embryos obtained from the X-linked transgenic females were harvested and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h at 4°C. The fixed tissues were then embedded in paraffin, and 4-μm cross-sections were cut. Deparaffinized sections were incubated with 2 μg of the respective affinity-purified rabbit anti-MLCK peptide antibody for 2 h, washed three times in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h, and washed again. Sections mounted in glycerol/phosphate-buffered saline (9:1) containing 0.1% p-phenylenediamine were viewed on a Nikon epifluorescence microscope.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe used the rabbit skeletal muscle MLCK 19-amino acid CaM-binding sequence to design a gene, which, when expressed, would eliminate the cellular function of Ca2+-CaM by competing with endogenous target proteins. In order to test whether the synthetic gene product would inhibit CaM, the MLCK peptide gene was expressed in bacteria as a fusion protein. The fusion protein, like the chemically synthesized peptide, inhibits Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1).CaM is composed of two highly structured globular Ca2+-binding domains connected by an α-helical peptide(14.Babu Y.S. Sack J. Greenhough T. Bugg C. Means A. Cook W.J. Nature. 1985; 315: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). In the presence of Ca2+, the lobes engulf the target peptide like a vise(15.Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). The inhibitor peptide gene for in vivo studies was designed to include two properties, high binding capacity and intracellular targeting. Due to the fact that calmodulin is abundant in cells, the monomer gene was self-ligated into four tandem repeats in order to increase the calmodulin binding capacity of each transcript and to target localization to the nucleus. The sequence of the first two repeats of the concatemer is: MKRRWKKNFIAVSAANRFKKLGMKRRWKKNFIAVSAANRFKKLG. This sequence contains several basic amino acid clusters and the bipartite lysine-lysine motif, KK ……. KK (underlined). These are potential nuclear localization signals common in many karyophilic proteins such as the SV40 T-antigen and transcription factors(16.Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). In order to evaluate the cellular targeting of the CaM inhibitor gene and its effects in intact cells, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the concatemer gene. The cells were examined by indirect immunofluorescence using affinity purified antibody produced against the inhibitor peptide. As shown in Fig. 2a, approximately 10% of the cells expressed the MLCK peptide concatemer, which was concentrated in the nuclei of transfected cells (Fig. 2, c and d). During early stages of expression, the peptide staining pattern was “donut-like” (Fig. 2e). By 72 h, the nuclei became extremely large and multi-lobed, and contained condensed chromatin indicating disruption of nuclear function (Fig. 2f). It did not appear that the MLCK peptide-transfected cells entered mitosis. A splicing isoform of CaM kinase II contains the nuclear targeting sequence, KKRK, and is localized in the nucleus(3.Srinivasan M. Edman C.F. Schulman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 839-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Microinjection of a CaM kinase II inhibitory peptide into sea urchin eggs causes a delay in nuclear envelope breakdown(17.Baitinger C. Alderton J. Poenie M. Schulman H. Steinhart R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1763-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Targeted overexpression of the MLCK peptide in the nucleus may inhibit CaM kinase II activity preventing cells from entering mitosis. Double immunostaining of transfected cells demonstrates coincident localization of CaM and the MLCK peptide in the nucleus. CaM is also present throughout the cytoplasm, indicating that only nuclear functions of CaM were being neutralized (Fig. 2, g and h).Fig. 2Immunolocalization of the MLCK concatemer peptide in transfected COS cells.

Due to the potent inhibitory effects of the peptide observed in the CaM kinase II assay and in cultured cells, the lung was selected as the target organ since the animals would not require respiratory function until birth. The 3.7-kb 5′ promoter region of the human SP-C gene dictates specific expression to type II cells of the distal airway epithelium(18.Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Wert S.E. Bruno M.D. McWilliams K.M. Vorbroker D.K. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: L349-L356PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of gene expression by the 3.7-kb SP-C promoter occurs approximately on day 11 of fetal life, when a definable lung epithelium first appears.Our transgene was composed of the SP-C promotor, the four-repeat MLCK peptide concatemer gene, and SV40 RNA processing motifs (Fig. 3a). Offspring of transgenic founder mice displayed varying degrees of lung pathology, which corresponded to congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation. In this condition, the terminal bronchioli continue to develop in the absence of alveolar epithelial proliferation. At birth, trapped air causes cystic dilation of the bronchioles. Alveoli that appeared normal were found among the cysts in some transgenic animals. One founder, a female, demonstrated no obvious physical symptoms. Her litters contained two transgenic phenotypes. Some pups displayed cyanosis and died within 15 min of birth (Fig. 3b). All of the surviving transgenic animals were females. They demonstrated retarded post-natal development as exhibited by a 10-20% reduction in body size and displayed delayed hair growth, eye opening, and tooth eruption (Fig. 3c). Affinity-purified antibodies produced against the MLCK peptide showed that expression of the transgene product occurs by approximately day 13.5 of embryonic development (Fig. 3d). Cellular differentiation and bronchial branching began to decrease. Dilated tubules appeared at day 15.0 (Fig. 3e). There was no anti-MLCK peptide staining in the lung of day 16.5, 17.5, and post-natal male transgenic animals. Histological examination of tissue sections revealed that the transgenic male animals that died at birth had not developed a lung epithelium or lower airways (Fig. 3f). These results indicate that the type II cells that express the inhibitor peptide did not survive early development of the lung epithelium. The trachea and all major organs were histologically normal. Analysis of subsequent F1, F2, and F3 generations confirmed that all of the transgenic males died at birth and that all of the surviving transgenic animals were female (Fig. 4).Fig. 3Morphological analysis of mice expressing the MLCK peptide transgene. a, schematic representation of a transgene designed to target expression to the lung epithelium.

During morula development of females, there is random inactivation of one of the X-chromosomes, which form a Barr body. All of the cells in a given lineage inactivate the same X-chromosome throughout the life of the animal(19.Lyon M.F. Nature. 1961; 190: 372-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (2582) Google Scholar). In the present study the “Lyonized” females develop a mosaic lung epithelium. In some proliferating type II cells, and their clonal descendants, the CaM inhibitor peptide gene would remain silent, enabling some of the heterozygotic transgenic females to survive. Most of the transgenic females lived to adulthood, reproduced, and had a normal lung morphology. These studies confirm that progenitor type II cells are important for normal lung development.Genetic manipulation of organisms at all levels of complexity has proven valuable in identifying the role of specific genes in cellular function. Gene “knock-outs” by genomic homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells allows for the selective disruption of targeted genes(20.Mansour S.L. Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Nature. 1988; 336: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). Ablation of genes that are critical for the function of many cell types influences fetal development and can prove lethal. Indeed, disruption of fungal CaM genes demonstrates that CaM is essential for survival(21.Davis T. Urdea M. Masiarz F. Thorner J. Cell. 1986; 47: 423-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 22.Sun G.H. Hirata A. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. J.

Our study demonstrates that binding peptides can be used to selectively neutralize the function of a targeted protein such as CaM in a specific organelle of a defined cell type. Our findings also suggest that the mosaic inactivation of the MLCK peptide gene in lung allowed the unaffected clonal type II cells to proliferate and compensate for early loss of the cells expressing the concatemer peptide. These findings demonstrate that dominant lethal genes can be sustained in the germ-line of animals by targeting transgene integration into the X-chromosome. Male progeny display the most severe phenotype, while females demonstrate a broad spectrum of phenotypes depending upon the ratio of X-chromosome inactivation of the transgene during early embryogenesis.Organism organization is based upon recognition between individual biochemical components. Cell adhesion, assembly of organelles, and signal transduction pathways are each, for example, a complex series of molecular interactions. Properties of individual proteins are altered through covalent modifications and ligand binding. Stimuli initiate a cascade of protein conformational changes. These changes, in turn, modify the properties of other proteins in sequential order. These physical interactions transmit signal bifurcation and propagation throughout the cell, ultimately leading to a cellular response. Analysis of protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid associations has shown that the interactive domains are highly structured and are often composed of less than 25 amino acids(24.Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar, 25.Lim W.A. Richards F.M. Fox R.O.

These domains of recognition are attractive target sites for the design of peptides that modify specific cellular pathways. Identification and design of binding peptides that modify a targeted protein activity can be obtained by several techniques including biochemical fragmentation, three-dimensional structural analysis, mutagenesis of interacting species, two-hybrid transcriptional systems, and libraries of random peptides(27.Dedman J.R. Kaetzel M.A. Chan H.C. Nelson D.J. Jamieson Jr., G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23025-23030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Once identified, the binding properties of a selected peptide can be further refined by mutagenesis and reselection. Due to the fact that cellular processes involve a cascade of protein-protein interactions, the interference of molecular recognition by the use of binding peptides should be applicable to modulate any targeted cellular function.

A variety of in vitro techniques in many biological systems have been used to implicate CaM in nuclear activities. The nucleus contains several CaM-binding proteins (1.Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 24aCrossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) including protein kinases and phosphatases(2.Ohta Y. Ohba T. Miyamoto E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ca2+-CaM is capable of directly binding transcription factors containing basic helix-loop-helix domains and can differentially inhibit in vitro transcription(4.Corneliussen B. Holm M. Waltersson Y.

This study addresses the position of ssDNA in the RecA filament and the identification of amino acids that are in contact with the ssDNA.Photocross-linking has been used previously to determine the exact amino acids contacting DNA in a number of DNA (or RNA)-protein complexes (see (8.Williams K.R.

From analogy with 5-bromodeoxyuridine, we may expect that UV irradiation of 5IdU with an emission peak at 312 nm can result in high yields of photocross-linking with tryptophans, tyrosines, and histidines and photocross-linking with lower yields with most of the other amino acids.In this report we show that two loops, L1 and L2, of RecA protein are in close contact with single-stranded DNA. We have determined Met164 of loop L1 and Phe203 of loop L2 to be the exact positions of photocross-linking.MATERIALS AND METHODSRecA protein was isolated and purified as previously described (12.Yancey-Wrona J.E. Camerini-Otero R.D. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1149-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by automated β-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite DNA synthesis on a 380B DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems).Preparative UV Irradiation, Protease Digestion, and Purification of Cross-linked Peptides162 μg of the single-stranded oligonucleotide were preincubated with 10 mg of RecA protein for 1 h at 37°C in 25 ml in buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 0.4 mM DTT, and 0.1 mM ATPγS. The major portion of the oligonucleotide was synthesized with a phosphate at the 5′ end, a small fraction was 32P-labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase.Irradiation in a UV Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene), loaded with 312-nm bulbs (40 watts total) was carried out for 8 h. After irradiation the DNA-protein complex was dissociated by adding 15 mM EDTA, 5 mM ADP, 0.5 M NaCl, and 0.1% SDS.A small oligo(dT) cellulose column was poured. The column was equilibrated with binding buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.4 mM DTT, 0.1% SDS, 0.5 M NaCl) prior to sample loading. Then it was washed with 10 volumes of binding buffer, and the sample was eluted in elution buffer 1 (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.05 mM EDTA, 0.4 mM DTT, 0.01% SDS). DNA-containing fractions were identified by following the 32P label. SDS and DTT were adjusted to 0.3% and 3 mM, correspondingly, in a reaction volume of 0.5 ml. The tube was heated at 85°C for 20 min to denature the protein. After denaturation, the reaction was allowed to cool, and 1 ml of clostripain buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM CaCl2, 2 mM DTT) was added. After 4 h of clostripain digestion with 40 μg of enzyme at 37°C, an extra 40 μg of clostripain were added, and the cleavage was continued overnight.The sample was applied to oligo(dT) cellulose as described above. The oligonucleotide was eluted with buffer 2 (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.05 mM EDTA, 0.4 mM DTT, 1 M urea) and concentrated six times in a Speedvac. A small fraction was saved for a gel. The probe was heated at 85°C for 20 min. After denaturation the reaction was allowed to cool, and it was diluted 6-fold with trypsin buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM CaCl2). After 4 h of modified trypsin digestion with 40 μg of enzyme at 37°C, an extra 40 μg of trypsin were added, and the cleavage was continued overnight.The sample was again purified by oligo(dT) cellulose chromatography and then purified by gel electrophoresis. The probe was loaded onto a 10% denaturing (urea) PAGE, and the bands were cut from the gel, eluted, and sent to the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University for peptide sequencing.Analytical UV Irradiation, Protease Digestion, and Purification of Cross-linked PeptidesAnalytical complex formation, UV irradiation, and purification were essentially as described for preparative samples. Typically, 0.2-0.5 μg of oligonucleotide were preincubated for 1 h with an excess of RecA protein in 300 μl. The probe was then placed in a thin 1-mm quartz cuvette and irradiated for 4 h. Scaled-down oligo(dT) cellulose purifications were carried out as described above. The protease digestions were performed overnight with 10-20 μg of the appropriate protease. Finally, the cross-linked material was analyzed on 10% denaturing PAGE.RESULTSAnalytical Digestion of Cross-linked RecA ProteinIt was previously reported that RecA accomplishes its strand exchange activity by binding DNA at a minimum of two distinct sites(13.Howard-Flanders P.

In this study we were primarily interested in the localization of the major (highest affinity) single-strand DNA binding site, also called site I or the primary binding site. In order to exclude the possibility of the multiple occupancy of DNA in the RecA protein, we used excess protein, less than two nucleotides per one protein protomer. Since it is well established that the binding of ssDNA at the primary binding site is at a stoichiometry of three nucleotides per one protein molecule(15.Koller T. DiCapua E. Stasiak A. Cozzarelli N.

Liss, New York1983: 723-729Google Scholar), we had a 1.5-fold molar excess of RecA.The time course of the photocross-linking reaction showed that the reaction reached saturation with 19% of oligonucleotides cross-linked after 4 h, detected by gel-shift assay (Fig. 1, filled circles). Most of the photocross-links occurred at the 5-iododeoxyuridine position, as the cross-linking yield was more than 10 times less for a control oligonucleotide containing deoxythymidine instead of 5IdU (Fig. 1, open circles).RecA protein binds to DNA phosphates and it can form a presynaptic filament on any sequence(16.Leahy M. Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6954-6960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As the van der Waals radius of iodine was only 8% larger than the methyl group, we did not anticipate that the monosubstitution of photoactive 5IdU for thymine would significantly alter the structure of the presynaptic filament. Fig. 2 provides additional evidence that the cross-linking signal is specific. In the presence of ADP alone RecA protein cannot form a stable complex with the 5IdU-monosubstituted oligonucleotide and UV irradiation did not result in the formation of any nonspecific photocross-links (Fig. 2, lane 2). Furthermore, an unsubstituted, unlabeled oligonucleotide of the same sequence competed with the labeled 5IdU-monosubstituted oligonucleotide for the same binding sites on the RecA protein (Fig. 2, lanes 4-8). Thus, the incorporation of one 5IdU does not significantly alter the binding mode of the RecA protein. As expected, the presynaptic filament formed on 5IdU-monosubstituted DNA was able to find a homologous sequence in a double-stranded plasmid DNA to form a synaptic complex (data not shown). The incorporation of an adenine tail at the 5′ end of the oligonucleotide provided us with a simple and powerful strategy for the purification of proteins and/or peptides covalently attached to the oligo. Oligonucleotides bound to oligo(dT) cellulose at high ionic strength (500 mM NaCl) and eluted in low salt conditions when the oligo(dA-dT) duplex was destabilized. All uncross-linked polypeptides passed through the column without trapping, which resulted in very efficient purification of the sample.Figure 2:An excess of unmodified DNA competes out the 5IdU-monosubstituted oligonucleotide from DNA binding sites of RecA protein. The 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotide d(A)18CTATC(5IU)TAC was incubated for 1 h with RecA protein in the presence of different nucleotide cofactors and the indicated excess of the unlabeled and unmodified oligonucleotide d(A)18CTATCTTAC followed by UV irradiation for 4 h. Lane 1, oligonucleotide; lane 2, the reaction buffer contained 1.1 mM ADP; lane 3, the complex was formed in the presence of 0.3 mM ATPγS and 1.1 mM ADP; lanes 4-8, 0.1 mM ATPγS was used as a cofactor. Lanes 1-4, no competitive DNA was added; lanes 5-8, the molar excess of unsubstituted DNA added to the reaction mixtures is indicated at the top.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We utilized a two-step endoprotease digestion to obtain a complete trypsin digestion and to minimize sample losses. The first step was cleavage of cross-linked protein in the presence of 0.1% SDS by clostripain, which cleaves at the carboxylic end of all arginines. The second step was redigestion of cross-linked peptides in the presence of 1 M urea by trypsin, which cleaves after both arginines and lysines. The products of these two rounds of protease digestion were resolved by electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide urea gel. The oligonucleotide and cross-linked samples were detected by autoradiography.We resolved three different cross-linked peptides (Fig. 3, lane 2). To check whether we obtained the shortest completely cleaved peptides we combined different endoproteinase digestions. A part of the sample after trypsin cleavage was saved for gel analysis (Fig. 3, lane 2), while the other part was repurified by oligo(dT) chromatography and then subjected to either clostripain (lane 3), trypsin (lane 4), or Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease (lanes 5-16) treatment. Clostripain did not change the cross-linked peptide pattern obtained (compare lanes 2 and 3). Additional trypsin treatment did not give rise to any new shorter products, but band C disappeared. Thus bands A and B contain the two shortest distinct peptides, while band C was an underdigested tryptic cross-linked peptide, that was converted into either A or B during the second round of trypsin cleavage. We expect the resulting peptides in samples A and B to be short because they migrated faster than samples cross-linked to a peptide 20 amino acids long (data not shown).Figure 3:Superposition of endoprotease digestions. Lane 1, oligonucleotide; lane 2 cross-linked peptides from a two-step (clostripain/trypsin) digestion. Samples were redigested by clostripain (lane 3), trypsin (lane 4), or S. aureus V8 protease (lanes 5-16). Length of time of the third digestion is indicated at the top of the autoradiogram. The sizes of the cross-linked peptides determined by amino acid sequencing are in square brackets.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We also performed a time course of V8 protease cleavage of tryptic peptides in order to reveal the relationship between the three products (bands A, B, and C) and to determine whether these peptides have aspartic or glutamic acids in their sequence. The specificity of V8 protease depends on the buffer used for digestion. It cleaves specifically at the carboxylic side of glutamic and aspartic acid in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.8. In 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8, this protease cleaves only after glutamic acid. Comparing the intensities of all the bands (lanes 5-16), it is clear that sample B was converted into B′ and, presumably, has one glutamic acid. Band A was relatively resistant to V8 digestion, but had at least two sites of cleavage (Glu or Asp) leading to A′. Band C behaved as B, so it was reasonable to expect that sample C represents the underdigestion of band B (see Fig. 4 for the peptide map).Figure 4:Map of cross-linked peptides. Outlined R or K are potential sites of trypsin cleavage (arginine or lysine). Italicized E or D are potential sites of V8 protease cleavage (glutamic or aspartic acid). Shadowed M and F are the exact positions of photocross-linking (methionine 164 and phenylalanine 203).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Amino Acid Sequencing of the Tryptic Peptides Cross-linked to ssDNAThe identity of the cross-linked peptides was unambiguously determined by amino acid sequencing. RecA•5IdU DNA complexes were formed maintaining the same stoichiometry but under scaled up conditions. We used the same two-step endoprotease digestion. Small fractions after clostripain and trypsin rounds of digestion were loaded onto an analytical 10% denaturing PAGE (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 3). Meanwhile, the main sample after the last digestion was loaded onto a 10% preparative urea PAGE, all of the bands were cut from the gel and eluted, and the peptides were sequenced.Figure 5:Two-step endoprotease digestion prior to peptide sequencing. On the left, a cartoon of the strategy. On the right, an autoradiogram of the digestion steps.

So, in addition to the typical triple band pattern observed in the lane 2 of Fig. 3, there was an extra band whose mobility coincided with the band before the trypsin treatment (Fig. 5, lane 2). Presumably, this top band represented the partially digested product. However, materials from all four gel shifted bands as well as the band corresponding to free oligonucleotide were sequenced. There was no peptide material in the major band corresponding to unbound oligonucleotide. All other gel-shifted bands gave amino acid sequences.The gel-shifted band A contains amino acid residues 153-169 (Fig. 4), corresponding to loop L1 with small flanking regions in the molecular structure of RecA(17.Story R.M. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). The recovery of Met was only 5.8% that of the expected value; therefore, it is the probable site of cross-linking.The peptide component of band B matched residues 199-217 of the RecA protein. It contains most of loop L2 and terminates at the nearest lysine on the carboxyl side. The yield of Phe in cycle 5 was only 21% of the anticipated level; thus, it appears to be a potential site of cross-linking. The remaining 20% of this peptide may be cross-linked at other positions along the peptide spanning residues 199-217, although the sensitivity of the sequencing was not sufficient to unambiguously determine these minor species. As we used long wavelength UV radiation resulting in minimum damage to biological substrates, it is unlikely that the decreased yield of phenylalanine results from photodestruction rather than photocross-linking. Also, as a control, we subjected a synthetic peptide derived from amino acids residues 193-212 to the same dose of UV radiation and did not observe any decrease of Phe level in the sequence (data not shown). Because the sequences of the cross-linked peptides A and B do not contain internal sites for cleavage by trypsin, they are the shortest possible tryptic peptides. This is consistent with the fact that the cross-linked peptides A and B represent limit digests.Sequencing confirmed our preliminary conclusions about the nature of band C. The product C had peptide extending from residues 199-222 so C was indeed an underdigested band B, and lysine 216 was the position of undercleavage (see Fig. 4). As in the case of B, Phe203 was determined as the primary photocross-linking position.The longest peptide, D, started upstream from loops L1 and L2 at residue 135. We sequenced only the first 22 amino acids from the amino end and detected no obvious position of cross-linking among these 22 amino acids. Thus, the simplest explanation is that lane D represents a partial digest of products A and B.We can explain the electrophoretic mobilities of all peptide-DNA species in Fig. 3 on the basis of their peptide lengths and electrical charges (see Fig. 4 for peptide map). Sample A migrates faster than B, as it has one less amino acid and a −3 electrical charge of the peptide versus the uncharged peptide component of B. A presence of six extra amino acids slows down the mobility of C in comparison with B. Digestion with V8 protease cleaves product B into B′. B′ has the shortest cross-linked peptide, which is nine amino acids long, and exhibits the fastest mobility. The lengths of the digestion products of A′ based on the cleavage specificity of V8 protease and the known peptide sequence are predicted to be 15, 13, 11, and 9 amino acids long. As a result, the mobility of A′ is somewhat faster than A, but slower than that of B′. The inability to obtain all four predicted cleavage products of A′ and the relative resistance to the V8 cleavage of the other peptides could be the result of steric protection by the cross-linked oligonucleotide in the vicinity of these potential protease cleavage sites.We have not found any evidence for any additional points of cross-linking and all peptides have been accounted for. Thus, we can conclude that: (i) there are only two independent points of photocross-linking, (ii) peptides A and B are the shortest products of tryptic digestion, and (iii) cross-links occurred at Met164 and Phe203.DISCUSSIONOur cross-linking data confirm a prediction deduced from crystallographic studies of RecA protein(17.Story R.M. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 18.Story R.M. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Within the crystal, RecA protein is organized in a 83.7 Å pitch right-handed helix with six protomers per turn(17.Story R.M. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Assuming that this helix reflects the geometry of the DNA-RecA filament, and bearing in mind the fact that the DNA lies near the center(19.Egelman E.H. Stasiak A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 677-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), Story et al. (17.Story R.M. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar) proposed that loops L1 and L2 lining the cavity down the filament axis are involved in DNA binding. This prediction, based on the x-ray data obtained in the absence of DNA and triphosphate cofactors, is confirmed and extended by our finding that these loops constitute the ssDNA (primary) binding site in the active DNA-RecA filament.The identity of amino acids in the loop L2 is important for proper RecA function. In vitro, the recA430 mutation (Gly204→Ser) led to a decrease in ssDNA binding affinity(20.Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 845-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Two other mutations (Glu207→Gln and Gly211→ Ala) exhibited a recA− phenotype in vivo(21.Cazaux C. Larminat F. Defais M. Biochimie (Paris). 1991; 73: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In vitro, these two mutants were deficient in promoting both the self-cleavage of LexA repressor and the DNA strand-exchange reaction(22.Cazaux C. Larminat F. Villani G. Johnson N.P. Schnarr M. Defais M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8246-8254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA strand-exchange defects were correlated with an inability of mutant proteins to displace SSB from DNA(22.Cazaux C. Larminat F. Villani G. Johnson N.P. Schnarr M. Defais M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8246-8254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of these data are consistent with the participation of loop L2 in ssDNA binding.Gardner et al.(23.Gardner R.V. Voloshin O.N. Camerini-Otero R.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) unambiguously demonstrated that a peptide (amino acids 193-212) spanning loop L2, binds to ssDNA(23.Gardner R.V. Voloshin O.N. Camerini-Otero R.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This observation combined with our cross-linking findings strongly argues for a direct participation of loop L2 in ssDNA binding.While this manuscript was in preparation a study was published (24.Morimatsu K. Horii T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 772-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) that also used photocross-linking to identify the ssDNA binding domain of RecA. Surprisingly, the authors claimed two other regions to be the DNA binding sites of RecA in the presence of ATPγS, the regions of residues 89-106 and 178-183. As these peptides are located on the outside surface of the filament and far from the central axis, these observations are not in accord with the x-ray (17.Story R.M. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar) and electron microscopy data(19.Egelman E.H. Stasiak A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 677-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), which place the DNA near that axis. Although the difference between our and their data is puzzling, it could be a consequence of different experimental designs. A lack of cross-links in loops L1 and L2 could be the result of a less powerful cross-linking strategy. Oligo(dT) was photocross-linked to RecA protein by short UV (254 nm) irradiation(24.Morimatsu K. Horii T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 772-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Halogen-substituted uridines are more reactive than thymines. Thus, it is conceivable that, even though the oligo(dT) might have close contacts with loops L1 and L2, it might not be cross-linkable in these regions. In addition, the two regions of residues 89-106 and 178-183 could be part of the second DNA binding site of RecA. As we used a significant excess of RecA protein compared to the work of Morimatsu and Horii(24.Morimatsu K. Horii T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 772-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), only the primary DNA binding site was occupied, and this may explain why we did not have any cross-links with these secondary regions. INTRODUCTIONRecA protein is the central enzyme of bacterial homologous recombination. It also plays an important role in DNA repair and the SOS response (reviewed in (1.Kowalczykowski S.C.

That this presynaptic filament is an essential precursor of recombination reactions and the SOS response has led to a great interest in the structure of these DNA•RecA complexes (reviewed in (7.Egelman E.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 189-197Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar)). This study addresses the position of ssDNA in the RecA filament and the identification of amino acids that are in contact with the ssDNA.Photocross-linking has been used previously to determine the exact amino acids contacting DNA in a number of DNA (or RNA)-protein complexes (see (8.Williams K.R. Konigsberg W.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 516-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 9.Willis M.C. LeCuyer K.A. Meisenheimer K.M. Uhlenbeck O.C. Koch T.H.

Science. 1993; 262: 1255-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) demonstrated that 5-iodouracil-substituted DNA or RNA can be cross-linked with an extremely high yield by monochromatic 325-nm irradiation. From analogy with 5-bromodeoxyuridine, we may expect that UV irradiation of 5IdU with an emission peak at 312 nm can result in high yields of photocross-linking with tryptophans, tyrosines, and histidines and photocross-linking with lower yields with most of the other amino acids.In this report we show that two loops, L1 and L2, of RecA protein are in close contact with single-stranded DNA. We have determined Met164 of loop L1 and Phe203 of loop L2 to be the exact positions of photocross-linking."

https://openalex.org/W2056021390,"It is unclear whether the six known human defensin peptides are all encoded by separate genes or whether some of them are allelic. Three of the peptides, HP-1, HP-2, and HP-3, differ by only one amino acid, and it is thought that HP-2 may represent a proteolytic product of HP-1 and/or HP-3. To help determine the relationship of these three proteins, we isolated a nearly full-length cDNA encoding HP-1 with a sequence very similar to, but different from, the previously isolated HP-1 and -3 cDNAs. Gene copy number experiments established that there were at least two but fewer than five defensin genes with a high level of similarity to the HP-1 cDNA (HP-1/3-like). Three genomic clones were isolated that contained two different configurations of the HP-1/3-like sequences. Sequencing established that one encoded the HP-1 peptide, whereas the other encoded HP-3. Analysis of DNAs obtained from 18 unrelated individuals by Southern blot analysis revealed the expected fragments as well as additional fragments that were not present in the genomic clones. This suggested the possibility of alleles; however, when DNAs from families were examined, these fragments did not segregate in an obvious Mendelian fashion. The HP-1/3-like defensin genes are on human chromosome 8. Surprisingly, somatic cell hybrid mapping showed that the number of HP-1/3-like genes on isolated copies of chromosome 8 was variable.

These proteins are small, often cationic peptides (29-35 amino acids) with a characteristic cysteine-rich structure and were originally isolated because of their anti-adrenocorticotrophin hormone (corticostatic) (6.Zhu Q.

Subsequently, sequence analysis of a cDNA clone revealed that cryptdin, from mouse intestinal Paneth cells, is a family member(13.Huttner K.M. Selsted M.E. Ouellette A.J. Genomics. 1994; 19: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Recently, Paneth cell sequences of human origin have also been identified(14.Ouellette A.J. Greco R.M. James M. Frederick D. Naftilan J. Fallon J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 15.Jones D.E. Bevins C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23216-23225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Presently, the family consists of six human, six rabbit, seven rat, two guinea pig, and six mouse sequences. Three of the human peptides, HP-1, HP-2, and HP-3, are almost identical in sequence. HP-1 and HP-3 are 30 amino acids long and differ only at the first amino acid, which is Ala in HP-1 and Asp in HP-3. HP-2 is 29 amino acids in length and may simply be a proteolytic product of one or both of the other two peptides as it begins with the second amino acid (Cys) of HP-1 and HP-3. In contrast, sequences of HP-4, HP-5, and HP-6 are very different, sharing only 10 amino acids with each other and the other HP peptides. The functions of the human peptides have been studied in some detail. At higher concentrations (25-200 μg/ml range), HP-1, HP-2, HP-3, and HP-4 exhibit varying degrees of antimicrobial and/or viricidal properties in vitro(2.Ganz T. Selsted M.E. Szklarek D.

In general, HP-4 seems to have the greatest defensin activity(19.Wilde C.G. Griffith J.E. Marra M.N. Snable J.L. Scott R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11200-11203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas HP-3 has the least (2.Ganz T. Selsted M.E. Szklarek D. Harwig S.S.L. Daher K. Bainton D.F. Lehrer R.I. J. Clin.

Invest. 1988; 81: 1829-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). At lower concentrations (1-25 μg/ml range), a mixture of HP-1, HP-2, and HP-3 affects mammalian cell growth in that it is cytotoxic against selected cell lines and promotes the growth of others(7.Singh A. Bateman A. Zhu Q. Shimasaki S. Esch F. Solomon S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 155: 524-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 20.Zhu Q. Singh A.V. Bateman A. Esch F. Solomon S. J.

Dis. 1990; 141: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Curiously, HP-1 and HP-2 are chemotactic for monocytes, whereas HP-3 is not(23.Territo M. Ganz T. Selsted M. Lehrer R. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 2017-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). All three proteins can inhibit protein kinase C in vitro, with HP-2 displaying the greatest inhibitory effect(24.Charp P.A. Rice W.G. Raynor R.L. Reimund E. Kinkade Jr., J.M. Ganz T. Selsted M.E. Lehrer R.I. Kuo J.F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 951-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). HP-4 has corticostatic activity, whereas HP-1, HP-2, and HP-3 do not(7.Singh A. Bateman A. Zhu Q. Shimasaki S. Esch F. Solomon S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 155: 524-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 20.Zhu Q. Singh A.V. Bateman A. Esch F. Solomon S. J. Steroid Biochem. 1987; 27: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As HP-5 and HP-6 are known only from their DNA sequences(15.Jones D.E. Bevins C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23216-23225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Jones D.E. Bevins C.L. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), their functions are unknown; however, it is likely that these peptides have defensin-like activities, similar to their mouse counterparts(10.Eisenhauer P.B. Harwig S.S. Lehrer R.I. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 3556-3565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Selsted M.E. Miller S.I. Henschen A.H. Ouellette A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The probable tertiary structure of the peptides has been determined (25.Hill C.P. Yee J. Selsted M.E. Eisenberg D. Science. 1991; 251: 1481-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). They are considered to be cyclic as the first and last cysteines are linked(26.Selsted M.E. Harwig S.S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4003-4007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, they form dimers with charged and hydrophobic molecules clustered on two different faces of the molecule, rendering them amphiphilic. Under optimal conditions, HP-1 can permeabilize the outer and inner membranes of Escherichia coli(27.Lehrer R.I. Barton A. Daher K.A. Harwig S.S.L. Ganz T. Selsted M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), forming voltage-gated ion channels(28.Kagan B.L. Selsted M.E. Ganz T. Lehrer R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 210-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the peptides do not display viricidal activity against viruses without envelopes(17.Daher K.A. Selsted M.E. Lehrer R.I. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 1068-1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that membrane interaction is necessary for defensin-like function. The corticostatin activity of the rabbit peptides occurs via receptor interaction(29.Zhu Q. Bateman A. Singh A. Solomon S. Endocrine Res. 1989; 15: 129-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 30.Tominaga T. Fukata J. Naito Y. Nakai Y. Funakoshi S. Fujii N. Imura H. J. Endocrinol. 1990; 125: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), so it is likely that all of the peptides in this family exert their functions via some type of membrane interaction. Although much is known about the function and structure of these peptides, relatively little is known about them at the DNA and RNA levels. cDNAs encoding HP-1, HP-3, HP-4, HP-5, and HP-6 have been isolated(15.Jones D.E. Bevins C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23216-23225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Jones D.E. Bevins C.L.

The two cDNA sequences encoding HP-1 and HP-3 are almost identical, differing by only three nucleotides; whereas, the cDNA encoding HP-4 shares a 72% identity with the HP-1 and HP-3 cDNAs. The cDNA encoding HP-6 is also very similar to the sequences encoding HP-1, HP-3, and HP-4 in certain regions. For example, nucleotides −9 to +81 of the HP-6 sequence (16.Jones D.E. Bevins C.L. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) are 84% identical with nucleotides +85 to +174 of the HP-1 sequence(31.Mars W.M. vanTuinen P. Drabkin H.A. White J.W. Saunders G.F. Blood. 1988; 71: 1713-1719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genes encoding HP-1, HP-3, and HP-5 have also been sequenced(15.Jones D.E. Bevins C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23216-23225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Linzmeier R. Michaelson D. Liu L. Ganz T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), as have two of the rabbit genes (encoding MCP-1 and MCP-2)(36.Ganz T. Rayner J.R. Valore E.V. Tumolo A. Talmadge K. Fuller F. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 1358-1365PubMed Google Scholar). Like HP-1, HP-2, and HP-3, the MCP-1 and MCP-2 peptides differ by a single amino acid. Although one might expect that the two rabbit genes are simply alleles of each other, analysis of their gene structure revealed that this is not the case. In contrast, two rat peptides that differ by a single amino acid are apparently allelic(8.Eisenhauer P. Harwig S.S.L. Szklarek D. Ganz T. Lehrer R.I. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3899-3902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although two genomic sequences encoding the HP-1 and HP-3 peptides have been identified(35.Linzmeier R. Michaelson D. Liu L. Ganz T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), it is unclear whether they represent two different genes or two alleles of the same gene. We originally initiated these studies to determine whether the HP-1, HP-2, and HP-3 peptides are alleles or are encoded by different genes. Gene copy number experiments were performed that determined there is more than one gene per haploid genome. Genomic clones from a lambda phage library were isolated and characterized by restriction digest mapping. The restriction map analysis indicated that two clones were similar to the previously published genomic sequences encoding HP-1 and HP-3(35.Linzmeier R. Michaelson D. Liu L. Ganz T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), but a third clone was different. Sequencing determined that the former clones encoded HP-1, whereas the third encoded HP-3. To ascertain whether two different alleles or two different genes had been isolated, we performed Southern blot analyses on genomic DNAs from unrelated individuals as well as from families. Novel fragments, which were additional to the ones predicted from the genomic maps, were present in DNAs from unrelated individuals, confirming that there are multiple HP-1/3-like genes. Surprisingly, when DNAs from grandparents, parents, and children within the same family were examined, we discovered that the genes did not segregate in an obvious Mendelian fashion. To determine which fragments corresponded to which gene, DNAs from somatic cell hybrids containing single human chromosome 8s were examined. This analysis determined that the numbers of HP-1/3-like genes on the different chromosome 8s varied. Thus, individuals can inherit unequal numbers of these genes, depending upon which chromosomes they inherit from their parents. DNA was isolated from human peripheral blood lymphocytes or lymphoblastoid cell lines. DNA samples were digested with restriction endonucleases, electrophoresed through agarose gels, transferred to nitrocellulose or nylon membranes, and hybridized to radiolabeled DNA probes as described previously(37.Huff V. Compton D.A. Strong L.C. Saunders G.F. Hum. Genet. 1990; 84: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A cDNA library was prepared from leukocyte poly(A+) RNA isolated from a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia and cloned into λgt11(38.Chang K.S. Trujillo J.M. Cook R.G. Stass S. Blood. 1986; 68: 1411-1414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). cDNA clones were selected from this library by screening with pC-A3, a clone containing the 3′-HP-1 sequence, and inserts were subcloned into a pUC vector for further analysis. The pC-A3 sequence encodes the mature peptide. The nucleotide sequences were determined by the dideoxy chain termination method of Sanger et al.(39.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar). Both strands from overlapping regions were sequenced. For the genomic clones, the region from EcoRI to BamHI was subcloned into pUC18, and only the region encoding exon 3 was sequenced. The synthetic primer ACTGCTAACTCCATACTCAA was used in one direction, and the appropriate pUC primer was used in the other. Using a previously described protocol(40.Harper M.E. Barrera-Saldana H.A. Saunders G.F. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1982; 34: 227-234PubMed Google Scholar), we digested genomic DNA with EcoRI, electrophoresed it through a 1% agarose gel, and transferred it to nitrocellulose. BamHI-linearized pC-A3 DNA corresponding to one, two, and five copies of HP-1 per haploid genome were electrophoresed and transferred with the genomic digests. The filters were prepared as described above and probed with a 32P-labeled subclone of pC-A3 in an M13 vector that does not cross-hybridize with pBR322. Hybridization and washes were performed using stringent conditions (hybridization was at 68°C in 0.9 M NaCl, 0.09 M Na3 citrate, 0.04% each of Ficoll-400, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and bovine serum albumin, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.05% SDS, pH 7.0; washes were at 68°C for 2 h each in 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M Na3 citrate, 0.5% SDS, pH 7.0). The resulting autoradiograms were analyzed on a Millipore BioImage scanning densitometer (Millipore Corp.). Screening of the genomic library was as described previously (41.Compton D.A. Weil M.M. Jones C. Riccardi V.M. Strong L.C. Saunders G.F. Cell. 1988; 55: 827-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) using pC-A3, representing the 3′-end of the cDNA encoding HP-1(31.Mars W.M. vanTuinen P. Drabkin H.A. White J.W. Saunders G.F. Blood. 1988; 71: 1713-1719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This region encodes the mature peptide. High molecular weight DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes or cultured cells was prepared in agarose plugs and digested with restriction enzymes as described previously(41.Compton D.A. Weil M.M. Jones C. Riccardi V.M. Strong L.C. Saunders G.F. Cell. 1988; 55: 827-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The digested DNA was separated by field inversion gel electrophoresis (42.Carle G.F. Frank M. Olsen M.V. Science. 1986; 232: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 43.Graham M.Y. Otani T. Boime I. Olsen M.V. Carle G.F. Chaplin D.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 4437-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) at 300 V for 16 h using 0.4-s electrical pulses. Current in the reverse direction was one-third that of the current in the forward direction. The methods for DNA transfer and hybridization have been described previously(41.Compton D.A. Weil M.M. Jones C. Riccardi V.M. Strong L.C. Saunders G.F. Cell. 1988; 55: 827-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To facilitate studies of the HP-1/3-like gene structure(s), we decided to isolate a full-length cDNA encoding an HP-1 (or HP-3) peptide. Previously, we had determined the HP-1 sequence by analyzing overlapping cDNAs (pH-E2 and pC-A3, containing sequences from the HP-1 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively)(31.Mars W.M. vanTuinen P. Drabkin H.A. White J.W. Saunders G.F. Blood. 1988; 71: 1713-1719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An identical HP-1 cDNA sequence was also determined independently using overlapping sequences(32.Daher K.A. Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. Kronenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7327-7331Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar); however, since the HP-1 and HP-3 cDNAs are extremely similar, isolation of a full-length cDNA seemed essential to avoid potential problems. A cDNA library made from a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia (38.Chang K.S. Trujillo J.M. Cook R.G. Stass S. Blood. 1986; 68: 1411-1414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was screened using pC-A3. A new clone was selected, subcloned (pUC4A), and sequenced (Fig. 1). Comparison of pUC4A with the previously reported HP-1 and HP-3 cDNA sequences (31.Mars W.M. vanTuinen P. Drabkin H.A. White J.W. Saunders G.F. Blood. 1988; 71: 1713-1719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Daher K.A. Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. Kronenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7327-7331Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 33.Wiedemann L.M. Francis G.E. Lamb R.F. Burns J.H. Winnie J.N. MacKenzie E.D. Birnie G.D. Leukemia. 1989; 3: 227-234PubMed Google Scholar) showed that pUC4A encodes the HP-1 peptide (Table 1). Although it is nearly identical to the previously reported sequences (Table 1), it differs from the earlier HP-1 and HP-3 cDNAs.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab As a first step toward determining whether HP-1, HP-2, and HP-3 represent alleles of a single peptide or are peptides encoded by separate genes, we performed gene copy number experiments(40.Harper M.E. Barrera-Saldana H.A. Saunders G.F. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1982; 34: 227-234PubMed Google Scholar). Genomic DNAs from several different individuals were digested and compared with titrated quantities of a standard representing the HP-1/3-like genes. Densitometric analyses of the autoradiograms indicated the presence of at least two and less than five HP-1/3-like defensin genes per haploid genome (see Fig. 2), with a copy number closest to two. To further characterize the genes encoding these peptides, genomic clones were isolated from a human leukocyte DNA library by using pC-A3 as a probe. Three different recombinant phage were isolated and mapped by restriction enzyme analyses. Two of the clones contained overlapping regions of DNA spanning approximately 17 kb 1The abbreviation used is: kbkilobase(s). with a restriction map that was consistent with the previously published HP-1 and HP-3 genomic sequences(35.Linzmeier R. Michaelson D. Liu L. Ganz T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), with the exception of an additional BglI site between exons I and II. Sequencing indicated these clones encoded the HP-1 peptide (not shown). The third clone was very similar but distinct and contained 16 kb of DNA. Sequencing revealed that this clone encoded the HP-3 peptide (not shown). In all three phages, the gene itself was confined to a region less than 3 kb (Fig. 3). kilobase(s). To confirm the gene copy number data and to determine whether the HP-1 and HP-3 sequences represented different alleles or different genes, we digested DNA samples from 18 unrelated individuals with BamHI, EcoRI, and HindIII, subjected the samples to Southern blot analysis, and hybridized the filters with radiolabeled pC-A3. The patterns obtained using all three enzymes were consistent with the genomic clone data and suggested that either pC-A3 hybridized to sequences from a single gene or, as the gene copy number experiment suggested, there were two or more HP-1/3-like genes with indistinguishable restriction fragment patterns using these experimental conditions. When DNAs were digested with BglI and probed with pUC4A, containing the entire HP-1 cDNA sequence, multiple bands were detected in addition to those that could be explained by the maps of our genomic clones (data not shown). Thus, we determined that the 5′-cDNA sequences present in pUC4A hybridize to a minimum of two genes; however, it was still unclear whether these were all HP-1/3-like genes or whether there was cross-hybridization with the related HP-4, HP-5, and HP-6 sequences(15.Jones D.E. Bevins C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23216-23225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Jones D.E. Bevins C.L. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 34.Palfree R.G.E. Sadro L.C. Solomon S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 199-205PubMed Google Scholar). To simplify our analysis, we decided to probe with a genomic fragment rather than a cDNA. Since the genomic clone restriction mapping indicated that the 5′ regions of the genes were different, a 1.6-kb EcoRI fragment from the genomic clone representing the HP-1 gene (Fig. 3) was subcloned into a pUC vector for further analysis. Genomic DNAs from unrelated individuals were digested with either Asp718 or BamHI and subjected to Southern blot analyses (Fig. 4). In accordance with the genomic clone data, a single, intensely hybridizing band was detected in the BamHI digests of DNAs from nine unrelated individuals, consistent with the interpretation that HP-1 and HP-3 are either alleles or they represent two (or more) more highly related genes. In contrast, either one or three bands were noted in the Asp718 digests. The sizes suggested that the two lower bands might be the products of the upper band, i.e. the EcoRI fragment was detecting a polymorphism, which would indicate that HP-1 and HP-3 were alleles rather than separate genes. To determine whether the Asp718 bands were indeed alleles, 23 DNAs from a three-generation pedigree were examined by digesting with Asp718 and probing with the pUC4A cDNA. Surprisingly, using this approach we were able to show that the two smaller Asp718 bands were not the products of the larger band, as many family members had only one, rather than both, of the two smaller bands (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the combined data suggested that our probe was probably detecting two (or more) highly related genes with alleles that were comigrating and therefore cohybridizing. An alternative but less likely explanation of the data was that at the DNA level we were detecting a gene (or genes) that did not have a corresponding allele (or alleles) on the sister chromosome. To help resolve the situation, additional experiments were performed using BglI digests of DNAs from several smaller pedigrees. Again, after probing with the 1.6-kb EcoRI genomic fragment from the 5′-end of the gene, we were unable to detect alleles that segregated in a typical Mendelian fashion (data not shown). The genes encoding the neutrophil defensins have been mapped to human chromosome 8(31.Mars W.M. vanTuinen P. Drabkin H.A. White J.W. Saunders G.F. Blood. 1988; 71: 1713-1719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Sparkes R.S. Kronenberg M. Heinzmann C. Daher K.A. Klisak I. Ganz T. Mohandas T.

Therefore, to help determine the source of the variation in this gene family, we obtained multiple DNA samples from somatic cell hybrids that were prepared using cells from a single individual and that contained either one or both copies of chromosome 8(45.Stallings R.L. Olson E. Strauss A.W. Thompson L.H. Bachinski L. Siciliano M.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1988; 43: 144-151PubMed Google Scholar). The hybrid DNAs were digested with BglI, and Southern blot analysis was performed using the 1.6-kb EcoRI fragment. To our surprise, unequal numbers of DNA fragments corresponding to the HP-1/3-like genes were detected in the different hybrids. Either two bands (1.7 and 2.3 kb) or three bands (1.2, 2.3, and 2.9 kb) of equal intensity were observed (Fig. 6), depending upon which chromosome 8 was present. This suggested that either two genes or three genes, respectively, were present on the chromosome that was present in the hybrid. In addition, a hybrid containing a single chromosome 8 from a second individual had a single, strongly hybridizing band. At first it appeared as though this might represent a single gene; however, when the intensity of the signal from this blot was compared with the intensity of a control probe from chromosome 8 (pSW50, which hybridizes to the D8S7 locus(46.Wagner M.J. Ge Y. Siciliano M. Wells D.E. Genomics. 1991; 10: 114-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar)) that was rehybridized to the same blot, scanning densitometric analysis showed that this band actually represented two genes (data not shown). As the D8S7 locus is polymorphic, pSW50 also served to confirm the identity of the individual chromosome 8s within the hybrids. It is important to note that the 1.6-kb probe does not cross-hybridize with hamster DNA, so the only bands detected were human in origin. Furthermore, although the hybrids did contain other human chromosomes, there was no correlation of the hybridization pattern with any other human chromosomes. Our somatic cell hybrid data showed that individuals can inherit copies of chromosome 8 with either two or three highly related loci corresponding to the 5′ regions of the HP-1/3-like genes. To confirm that all of these bands actually contained 5′-coding regions in addition to the genomic sequences, the somatic cell hybrid blot was rehybridized with the pUC4A cDNA. As expected, the same bands were detected by pUC4A along with additional bands (data not shown). We were interested in determining whether the peptides HP-1, HP-2, and HP-3 originate from a single gene or alternatively, whether they represent the products of almost identical, but separate genes. By a combination of studies such as gene copy number experiments and Southern blot analysis, we showed that multiple HP-1/3-like genes exist; however, using this approach we were still unable to distinguish whether the HP-1 and HP-3 peptides arose from separate genes or whether they were allelic variants of a single gene. We reasoned that by analyzing DNAs from somatic cell hybrids containing opposing copies of chromosome 8 from a single individual, we would be able to compare the band patterns on the individual chromosomes and distinguish between the two possibilities. To our surprise, we discovered that the chromosomes harbored unequal numbers of the HP-1/3-like genes, showing that unequal numbers of these genes can be inherited. Our somatic cell hybrid data demonstrates that the HP-1 and HP-3 sequences we isolated represent two genes rather than two alleles. The 1.2- and 2.9-kb BglI bands in the somatic cell hybrid DNAs (see Fig. 6), found on a single chromosome 8, correspond with the expected HP-1 and HP-3 fragments, respectively, as seen in Fig. 3. The 2.3-kb band, which was present in all the somatic cell hybrid DNAs, corresponds with the expected band from the published HP-1/HP-3 gene sequence (35.Linzmeier R. Michaelson D. Liu L. Ganz T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and spans the BglI site just 5′ of exon I to the BglI site inside exon II. In all of the hybrids, we also detected a small (500-600-base pair) BglI fragment with the genomic probe, which did not hybridize with the cDNA (not shown). This fragment represents the end 5′-BglI site depicted in Fig. 3 to the first internal BglI site in HP-1. The most likely origin of the 1.7-kb band detected in the hybrids would be a segment that spans the outer BglI site to the site between exons I and II. It is presently unclear whether the 1.7-kb fragment represents an allele of HP-1 or HP-3 or if it encodes a third HP-1/3-like gene (such as HP-2) or pseudogene. Given the similarities of the HP-4, HP-5, and HP-6 sequences (15.Jones D.E. Bevins C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23216-23225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Jones D.E. Bevins C.L. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 34.Palfree R.G.E. Sadro L.C. Solomon S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 199-205PubMed Google Scholar) with the HP-1/3-like sequences in the 5′-transcribed regions, it might seem reasonable to suspect that one of the strongly hybridizing bands we detected represents one of these other genes; however, comparison of our data with the published data shows that this is probably not the case. For example, the genomic EcoRI fragment, which we used as a probe, is 5′ to the region of shared similarity with HP-5(15.Jones D.E. Bevins C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23216-23225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is not necessarily present upstream of the HP-5 gene. Still, the EcoRI fragment did detect three other larger, much weaker hybridizing bands in the somatic cell hybrids digested with BglI, which cross-hybridized with the pUC4A cDNA (data not shown) and two smaller (6.0 and 7.0 kb), weaker bands in the BamHI digests (Fig. 4). It is possible that these weaker bands represent minor regions of shared similarity with other genes such as HP-4, HP-5, and HP-6. Given our inability to demonstrate typical Mendelian inheritance within families combined with our somatic cell hybrid data, we propose that variable numbers of the HP-1/3-like genes are transmitted to individuals within the general population. It is probable that the genes are physically linked on the individual chromosomes, as preliminary data using field inversion gel electrophoresis showed a single hybridizing EagI band of 300 kb by Southern blot analysis (data not shown). Thus, one would inherit a block of genes (most likely two or three) from each parent, the number being determined by the number on the parental chromosome 8. In agreement with our hypothesis is the finding that approximately 10% of the population lacks the HP-3 peptide(47.Ganz T. Selsted M.E. Lehrer R.I. Eur. J. Haematol. 1990; 44: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the 4.0-kb Asp718 band we observed was present in DNAs from 16 of 18 unrelated individuals (89%). This Asp718 fragment was present in our complete HP-3 genomic clone (data not shown), which had the the 2.9-kb BglI fragment. As the 2.9-kb BglI fragment was a third HP-1/3-like fragment in the somatic cell hybrid, it is intriguing to speculate that this configuration of the HP-3 gene encodes the HP-3 protein present in 90% of the population. In fact, although this was the fragment that did not display the hypothesized Mendelian inheritance when we examined our three-generation pedigree (Fig. 5), analysis of the familial data shows proper segregation when this allele is used as a haplotype marker. Still, there is a problem with our hypothesis since a second genomic sequence encoding HP-3 has been reported(35.Linzmeier R. Michaelson D. Liu L. Ganz T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and its role would be left unexplained. In summary, we detected a second cDNA sequence (pUC4A) that encodes the HP-1 peptide and showed that the numbers of the defensin HP-1/3-like genes vary from individual to individual. Furthermore, we proved that HP-1 and HP-3 are encoded by two different genes on the same chromosome. At present, no sequence has been detected that is known to specifically encode HP-2, and HP-2 may be a proteolytic product of the HP-1 or HP-3 peptides (or both). One interesting possibility is that one of the mRNAs thought to encode HP-1 may actually encode HP-2. For example, subtle differences in the mRNAs might be indicative of cell-specific expression. The final, processed peptide would then reflect the parental cell type in which it was originally transcribed. It is not unrealistic to believe that a specific HP-2 gene exists since we have shown that there can be three configurations of the HP-1/3-like genes on a single chromosome. Further studies will be necessary to elucidate the exact relationship between the genomic structure, expression, and translation of this interesting family of peptides.

The size of the products removed from the 3′-end of the RNA varies. The release of single nucleotides, dinucleotides, and larger oligonucleotides has been detected by different workers. Dinucleotides tend to originate from SII-independent complexes and 7-14 base products from SII-dependent complexes (Izban, M. G., and Luse, D. S.(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 12874-12885). Different modes of cleavage have also been recognized for bacterial transcription complexes and are thought to represent important structural differences between functionally distinct transcription intermediates.Using an elongation complex “walking” technique, we have observed factor-independent complexes as they approach and become arrested at an arrest site. Dinucleotides or 7-9-base (large) oligonucleotides were released from SII-independent or dependent complexes, respectively. The abrupt shift between the release of dinucleotide versus large products accompanied the change from factor-dependent to factor-independent elongation, as described by others. However, not all factor-independent complexes showed cleavage in dinucleotide intervals since oligonucleotides 2-6 bases long were also liberated from elongation-competent complexes. These were all 5′-coterminal oligonucleotides indicating that a preferred phosphodiester bond is targeted for cleavage in a series of related complexes. This is consistent with recent models postulating a large product binding site that can hold RNA chains whose size increases as a function of chain polymerization.

https://openalex.org/W1977273387,"Peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the COOH-terminal α-amidation of neural and endocrine peptides through a two-step reaction carried out sequentially by its monooxygenase and lyase domains. PAM occurs in soluble and integral membrane forms. Metabolic labeling of stably transfected hEK-293 and AtT-20 cells showed that [32P]PO43− was efficiently incorporated into Ser and Thr residues of membrane PAM but not into soluble PAM. Truncation of integral membrane PAM proteins (which terminate with Ser976) at Tyr936 eliminated their phosphorylation, suggesting that the COOH-terminal region of the protein was the site of phosphorylation. Recombinant PAM COOH-terminal domain was phosphorylated on Ser937 and Ser937 by protein kinase C (PKC). PAM-1 protein recovered from different subcellular fractions of stably transfected AtT-20 cells was differentially susceptible to calcium-dependent, staurosporine-inhibitable phosphorylation catalyzed by endogenous cytosolic protein kinase(s). Although phorbol ester treatment of hEK-293 cells expressing PAM-1 stimulated the cleavage/release of a bifunctional 105-kDa PAM protein, the effect was an indirect one since it was also observed in hEK-293 cells expressing a truncated PAM-1 protein that was not phosphorylated. AtT-20 cells expressing PAM-1 lacking one of the PKC sites (PAM-1/Ser937→Ala) exhibited an altered pattern of PAM•PAM antibody internalization, with the mutant protein targeted to lysosomes upon internalization. Thus, phosphorylation of Ser937 in the COOH-terminal cytosolic domain of membrane PAM plays a role in a specific step in the targeting of this protein."

Compared with LEC29 CHO cells, the double mutant exhibited an unusually high sensitivity to the toxic lectin, ricin, indicating increased exposure of galactose residues on cell surface carbohydrates. Structural analysis of LEC29.Lec32 cellular glycoproteins showed a nearly complete lack of sialic acid residues. Genetic analysis demonstrated that the <i>lec32</i> mutation is recessive and novel. Biochemical analysis showed that the mutant cells contained less than 5% of the cytidine 5′-monophosphate <i>N</i>-acetyl-neuraminic acid (CMP-NeuAc) present in parental CHO cells (1.6 nmol/mg of cell protein). A sensitive radiochemical assay used to measure CMP-NeuAc synthetase activity showed that the properties of this enzyme in parental CHO cells were essentially identical to those of CMP-NeuAc synthetase in various mammalian tissues. However, no CMP-NeuAc synthetase activity was detected in LEC29.Lec32 extracts. Mixing experiments provided no evidence for an inhibitor in the mutant CHO cells, and two revertants, which expressed only the LEC29 phenotype, had normal CMP-NeuAc synthetase levels. The combined evidence indicates that the <i>lec32</i> mutation resides in either the structural gene encoding CMP-NeuAc synthetase or in a gene that regulates the production of active enzyme."

In the present study, U937 monocyte adhesion to a plastic surface was used to investigate the mechanism of its promotion by u-PA and ATF. Adhesion was found to be inhibited by cycloheximide or actinomycin D, implicating protein synthesis and gene expression in u-PA-induced monocyte adhesion. Adhesion was prevented by 2′-deoxyadenosine 3′-monophosphate, indicating that a cAMP-dependent pathway of signal transduction was involved. This concept was supported by the complementary finding that u-PA-induced adhesion was greatly promoted by forskolin, cholera toxin, or 8-bromo-cAMP, which by themselves induced little adhesion. Furthermore, similar to many other cAMP-dependent activities, cGMP diminished u-PA-induced adhesion. When u-PA or ATF was treated with immobilized carboxypeptidase B, its proadhesive effect was abolished, implicating the involvement of carboxyl-terminal lysine residues (Lys158 on u-PA and Lys135 on ATF).

Retro-inverso modification of biologically active peptides is the most common peptidomimetic approach used to enhance peptide stability against the action of proteolytic enzymes and thus prolong their half-life in vivo(5.Goodman M. Chorev M. Acc. Chem. Res. 1979; 12: 1-7Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 6.Chorev M. Goodman M. Acc. Chem. Res. 1993; 26: 266-273Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In addition, this type of modification, leaving unaltered the topology of the peptide side chain and interconverting carbonyl and amide groups from their position, constitutes a useful approach to elucidate the role of peptide backbone polarity in molecular recognition events(7.Guptasarma P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). End group modified retro-inverso peptides are isomers of linear peptides in which the direction of the sequence is reversed, the chirality of each amino acid residue is inverted, and the end groups are modified to obtain close complementarity and full topological relationship to the parent peptide. Retro-inverso peptide have been found to retain recognition properties (8.Ruvo M. Fassina G. Int. J. Pept.

While the effect of peptide chirality and backbone modification has been extensively investigated in terms of biological reactivity, a limited amount of work has been carried out in order to assess the importance of peptide topochemistry on antibody recognition. Earlier studies suggested the lack of cross-antigenicity between enantiomeric peptides(12.Gill III, T.J. Gould H.J. Doty P. Nature. 1963; 197: 746-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 13.Maurer P. J. Exp. Med. 1965; 121: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 14.Borek F. Stupp Y. Fuchs S. Sela M. Biochem. J. 1965; 96: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), as well as between enantiomeric proteins, such as rubredoxin and its all-D analogue(15.Dintzis H.M. Symer D.E. Dintzis R.Z. Zawadzke L.E. Berg J.M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 16: 306-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). More recently the stereochemical requirements for peptide antigenicity have been investigated with renewed interest, since preliminary studies in a limited number of cases suggested the existence of antibody cross-recognition with topologically related variants of the parent peptide. In the first study, cross-recognition between the COOH-terminal fragment 130-135 of histone H3 (IRGERA) and the corresponding all-D analogue was experimentally observed with antibodies of the IgG3 isotype raised in mice against the parent peptide(16.Benkirane N. Friede M. Guichard G. Briand J.P. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Muller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26279-26285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it was shown than antibodies raised against the all-D peptide variant were able to recognize the all-L parent peptide equally well. In both cases, the corresponding antibodies recognized also the parent protein histone H3. On the other hand, anti-parent peptide antibodies of the IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b isotypes failed to bind the all-D peptide. The analysis of peptide topology importance on antigenicity has been extended in a further study, evaluating the effect of backbone polarity reversal (retro derivative), or amino acid chirality and backbone inversion (retro-inverso derivative), on antibody recognition(17.Guichard G. Benkirane N. Zeder-Lutz G. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Briand J.-P. Muller S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9765-9769Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Antibodies to the peptide analogues were produced in BALB/c mice and showed a strong correlation between cross-recognition properties and peptide topology, since mouse antibodies of the IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b isotypes against the parent peptide recognized only the peptide retro-inverso derivative, while antibodies of the same isotype against the inverso (all-D) peptide recognized only the corresponding retro-peptide and vice versa. These observations were supported by other studies on the cross-antigenicity between a cyclic peptide analogous to the third complementarity-determining region (CDR3) in immunoglobulin and the corresponding retro-inverso isomer(18.Jameson B.A. McDonnell J.M. Marini J.C. Korngold R. Nature. 1994; 368: 744-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Retro-inverso peptides are strongly topologically correlated with the parent peptide, since the resulting side chain disposition is similar to the parent peptide, but carbonyl and amide groups are interconverted from their positions(6.Chorev M. Goodman M. Acc. Chem. Res. 1993; 26: 266-273Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 7.Guptasarma P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Similarly, inverso peptide are strongly correlated with the retro derivative of the parent peptide for the same reason, while no apparent structural relationship can be envisioned between retro and retro-inverso peptides, as well as between the inverso and the all-L parent peptide, since in both cases the peptides display an enantiomeric relationship. The stringent side chains topological equivalence between linear all-L peptides and the corresponding retro-inverso derivatives, or between retro and inverso peptides, could provide a sufficient explanation for the observed cross-antigenicity, while cross-recognition between parent antigen and its retro or inverso variants apparently lack of a rational mechanistic explanation. In this study we have investigated the cross-recognition properties of polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbits against a 15-residue peptide (P15) able to bind interleukin 2 and at the same time to inhibit its interaction with the p55 interleukin 2 receptor subunit(19.Fassina G.

To further examine the role of side chain topology of enantiomeric antigens on cross-antigenicity, two other variants of the parent peptide were prepared, where the parent peptide amino acid sequence was changed in order to display only side chains in alternating position (1, 3, 5, 7, … or 2, 4, 6, 8, …) of the parent peptide original sequence, by replacing corresponding residues with glycine residues.

Linear peptides were purified by RP-HPLC on a RP-8 Lichrosphere 100 × 10-mm inner diameter column. Peptide identity was confirmed by amino acid analysis and determination of molecular weight by TOF-MALDI mass spectrometry. Rabbit anti-MAP antisera were prepared using the peptides without carrier conjugation.

After elution of unbound material, the eluent was changed to 0.1 M acetic acid to eluted bound antibody. Extent of purification was followed by ELISA, evaluating fractions reactivity on plates coated with the parent antigen MAP-P15. Conjugation of linear peptides to BSA was carried out by mixing 5 mg of peptide dissolved in 1 ml of 50 mM PBS, pH 7.0, with 15 mg of bovine serum albumin dissolved in 1 ml of the same buffer and incubating the mixture with 2 ml of 0.2% glutaraldehyde solution in the same buffer. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, 1 ml of 1 M Gly solution was added and 1 h later the conjugates were extensively dialyzed against 50 mM PBS, pH 7.0. Peptide-BSA conjugates were characterized by TOF-MALDI mass spectrometry, indicating that in all cases an average of eight peptide chains were coupled to BSA. Polystyrene microtiter plates were incubated overnight at 4°C or for 2 h at room temperature with 50 μg/ml MAP solution or 100 μg/ml peptide-conjugated solution (100 μl/well) in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer, pH 8.5. After five washings of the microtiter plates with PBS, the wells were saturated with 200 μl of PBS containing 3% BSA, for 1 h at room temperature, to block the uncoated plastic surface. Plates were then washed again with PBS and filled with samples containing anti-MAP antibodies at varying concentrations, previously diluted with PBS containing 0.5% BSA (PBS-B). For competition experiments, various concentrations of inhibitor (MAP, conjugated peptide, or linear peptide) were incubated for 3 h at 37°C with anti-MAP antibodies. The mixture was then added to MAP or BSA-conjugated peptide-coated wells. After 1 h of incubation the plates were washed five times with PBS. For anti-MAP antibody detection, wells were filled with 100 μl of a horseradish peroxidase labeled goat anti-rabbit (IgG) immunoglobulin solution diluted 1:1000 with PBS-B. The plates were then left to stand for 1 h at room temperature in a humid covered box, washed with PBS 5 times, an then filled with chromogenic substrate solution consisting of 1 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine in 0.1 M sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 5 mM hydrogen peroxide. The absorbance at 450 nm was determined with a model 2250 EIA Reader (Bio-Rad). Molecular models of peptide fragments and corresponding enantiomers or sequence-simplified derivatives were determined using the Sybyl software version 5.4 (Tripos) on a ESV3 graphic workstation. The peptide used for immunization was produced by solid phase peptide synthesis starting from a tetradentate lysine core following the Fmoc methodology. Amino acid analysis and determination of molecular weight by laser desorption mass spectrometry confirmed the intended chemical nature. Following the same synthetic methodology, the corresponding linear peptide (VRLGWLLAPADLDAR) was assembled and purified by semipreparative RP-HPLC. The inverso derivative was prepared using amino acid in the D configuration (VRLGWLLAPADLDAR), the retro inverting the sequence COOH to NH2 terminus (RADLDAPALLWGLRV), while the retro-inverso assembling the retro sequence with amino acids in the D configuration (RADLDAPALLWGLRV). No end group modification was carried over, since preliminary experiments with peptide smaller fragments suggested that the main epitope was distant from the peptide antigen amino or carboxyl terminus. As a control, a peptide containing all the amino acids of the parent linear antigen was prepared scrambling the amino acid sequence. Peptides were all purified by RP-HPLC and fully characterized by amino acid analysis and determination of molecular weight by laser desorption mass spectrometry (TOF-MALDI). Sequences of the peptides used in this study are shown in Fig. 1. Rabbit immunization with MAP-P15 induced a strong immune response even after the 1st boost, as detected by ELISA on microtiter plates coated with the multimeric antigen, while preimmune serum was unreactive. Antibody binding was dose-dependent and specific, since soluble MAP-P15 was able to inhibit the interaction between antibodies and immobilized MAP-P15 in a dose-dependent manner (not shown). Unrelated tetrameric peptides or BSA had no effect on the interaction, as well as scrambled linear P15 coupled to BSA. Crude serum was first purified by affinity chromatography on MAP-P15 antigen columns as described previously(21.Verdoliva A. Cassani G. Fassina G. J. Chromatogr. Biomed. Appl. 1995; 664: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified antibody was then tested for its ability to recognize the linear parent peptide, the retro, retro-inverso, and inverso derivatives, conjugated to BSA to facilitate coating on microtiter plates for ELISA determination. All the four topologically related variants, adsorbed on microtiter plates at roughly the same concentration, reacted in a similar way with affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies, in a dose-dependent fashion (not shown). Binding to BSA was negligible, as well as binding to scrambled linear antigen conjugated to BSA, thus providing evidence of the sequence specificity of the interaction. The polylysine core used for MAP-P15 synthesis apparently was not immunogenic, since antibodies did not cross-react with two other unrelated tetrameric peptides with the same lysine core (not shown). Binding was inhibited in the presence of soluble BSA-conjugated antigens, in a dose-dependent manner (not shown), while BSA or scrambled parent peptide conjugated to BSA had no effect on the interaction, thus providing further evidence of interaction specificity. Cross-recognition between the peptide variants was further confirmed by competition experiment on microtiter plates coated with the parent antigen MAP-P15. As shown in Fig. 2, all the peptide variants conjugated to BSA were efficiently able to displace the interaction between anti-MAP-P15 antibodies and MAP-P15 immobilized on microtiter plates in a dose-dependent manner, and interaction was reduced at 50% of its original value by BSA-peptide conjugates at roughly the same concentration (Table 1). Scrambled linear antigen, on the other hand, had no effect on the interaction, thus providing additional support to the sequence dependence of these interactions. Similar dose-response inhibition profiles were observed with free peptides, without conjugation to BSA (not shown).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab While the observed antibody cross-recognition with the retro-inverso derivative of the parent antigen could be ascribed to the close side chains topological equivalence of the two isomers, no structural similarity between retro and inverso derivatives could be invoked to explain cross-reactivity. In order to study further this intriguing behavior, a molecular model of all the peptide variants was built in the extended all- trans configuration. The parent peptide and its retro-inverso analogue display a superimposable side chain topology, with main differences, as expected, only at the level of peptide backbone, where carbonyl groups are replaced in the retro inverso isomer by amide groups and vice versa. Assuming that the peptide backbone does not take part in stabilizing contacts with the antibody, the molecular surface formed by the side chains residues in the two variants is very similar. The same is true considering the other two antigen variants, the retro and the inverso isomers, which display, as seen before, a superimposable side chains disposition. On the other hand, enantiomeric antigens, such as parent peptide P15 and its inverso derivative, or the retro-inverso and retro variants, by definition, are characterized by a nonsuperimposable side chains arrangement. A more detailed analysis of enantiomeric antigens structure suggested the possibility of aligning only the side chains of alternating residues, such as residues in position 1, 3, 5, 7, … or alternatively in position 2, 4, 6, 8, … (Fig. 3). In this configuration, the carbonyl and amide groups in the backbone are not superimposable, but located in close proximity. This structural analysis suggests that enantiomeric antigens could display similar recognition surfaces formed by alternating residues, thus providing a possible explanation for the observed cross-antigenicity. In order to test this hypothesis, parent peptide variants were prepared where alternating residues were replaced by glycine residues. Two sequence-simplified variants were synthesized, one with glycine residue substitutions in the parent peptide even sequence position (VGLGWGLGPGDGDGR) ((+G)P15 variant) and the other with glycine replacement in the odd position (GRGGGLGAGLGAG) ((-G)P15 variant). Molecular models of these two latter variants are shown in Fig. 4. Sequence-simplified variants were then conjugated to BSA and then tested for their ability to recognize the antibody raised against the parent multimeric antigen. As detected by direct binding ELISA experiments, affinity-purified anti-MAP-P15 antibody recognized both sequence-simplified variants in a dose-related manner (Fig. 5A). Antibody binding to parent antigen MAP-P15 was inhibited by soluble (+G)P15 and (-G)P15 variants in a dose-dependent fashion, and peptide conjugates concentration yielding 50% binding inhibition was very close and comparable with that of BSA-P15 conjugates (Fig. 5B and Table 1). Once again, scrambled P15 conjugated to BSA had no effect on these interactions.Fig. 4Topological relationships between parent peptide and sequence-simplified variants.

Monospecific antibodies previously purified on the MAP-P15 affinity column were then eluted on the two columns, and as a positive control, also on a affinity column prepared with the linear parent peptide antigen P15, equilibrated with a neutral buffer. After elution of columns unbound material, the buffer was changed to acidic conditions to elute bound antibody. Fractions corresponding to the unbound and bound material were collected for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and ELISA determination of antibody reactivity using microtiter plates coated with the parent multimeric antigen MAP-P15. As shown in Table 2, in all cases immunoreactivity was found in the columns bound fractions, while negligible activity was found in the columns breakthrough, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis indicated that almost all the antibody loaded on the columns was recovered in the bound fractions. Elution of crude serum samples on the same columns confirmed the presence of immunoreactivity only in the columns adsorbed fractions. These results suggest that the entire anti-parent peptide antibody population recognizes the two sequence-simplified variants, equally well as the parent antigen.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Experimental evidences of antigenic cross-recognition between linear antigens and the corresponding retro-inverso isomers have been reported only recently in at least three different cases. In the first study, monospecific rabbit antibodies were used as conformational probes to demonstrate surface similarities between a cyclic peptide analogous to the third complementarity-determining region (CDR3) in immunoglobulin and the corresponding retro-inverso isomer(18.Jameson B.A. McDonnell J.M. Marini J.C. Korngold R. Nature. 1994; 368: 744-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In the second study, poly- or monoclonal antibodies raised against the COOH-terminal hexapeptide of histone H3 by injecting BALB/c mice with peptides covalently coupled to small unilamellar liposomes containing monophosphoryl lipid A, exhibited a clear cross-reactivity with the retro-inverso derivative(17.Guichard G. Benkirane N. Zeder-Lutz G. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Briand J.-P. Muller S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9765-9769Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 22.Benkirane N. Guichard G. Van Regenmortel H.H.V. Briand J.P. Muller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11921-11926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Similarly, antibodies raised against the retro derivative cross-reacted with the inverso derivative, but not with the parent linear antigen or the retro-inverso form, at least for antibodies of the IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b isotypes. Only antibodies of the IgG3 isotype displayed a generalized cross-reactivity, as in our case, with the parent peptide and the retro, retro-inverso, and inverso derivatives. In the third very recent study, similar cross-reactivity was found between the major antigenic site of foot-and-mouth disease virus and its end group-modified retro-inverso isomer(23.Muller S. Guichard G. Benkirane N. Brown F. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Briand J.P. Pept. Res. 1995; 8: 138-144PubMed Google Scholar). Cumulatively these results ruled out the importance of the peptide backbone as the common structural recognition element providing cross-reactivity between linear antigens and the corresponding topologically related variants, since retro-inverso peptides, while structurally similar to the linear parent peptide in the side chain disposition, have totally inverted carbonyl and amide groups in the backbone. The hypothesis of the limited role of peptide backbone on antibody recognition was further supported from data deriving from a different study, where it has been shown that pseudopeptide analogues of the COOH-terminal hexapeptide of histone H3 obtained by systematically replacing, in each analogue, one peptide bond at a time by a reduced peptide bond Y (CH2-NH), maintained recognition properties for poly- or monoclonal antibodies raised against the original parent peptide(24.Guichard G. Benkirane N. Graff R. Muller S. Briand J.P. Pept. Res. 1994; 7: 308-321PubMed Google Scholar). In our study, antigenic cross-recognition was found not only between the parent peptide and its retro-inverso derivative, or between the inverso and the retro derivatives, but with the complete set of topologically related peptides, to the same extent and with similar characteristics. These observations are in agreement with data on the cross-recognition properties of IgG3 mouse monoclonal antibodies against the COOH-terminal histone H3 hexapeptide with the all-D derivative(16.Benkirane N. Friede M. Guichard G. Briand J.P. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Muller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26279-26285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Guichard G. Benkirane N. Zeder-Lutz G. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Briand J.-P. Muller S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9765-9769Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). While structural similarities between retro-inverso and parent peptide, or between inverso and retro derivatives of the parent peptide, are clearly evident from a simple visual inspection of the peptide molecular models, and could constitute the simplest reason to explain cross-reactivity, no structural relatedness can be apparently detected between the parent peptide and its inverso or retro derivative. Inverso peptides are mirror images of the linear parent peptide, and consequently also the side chains are oriented in a nonsuperimposable way. The same is true for the retro and retro-inverso derivatives. But if enantiomeric peptides are aligned in the trans configuration, side chains in alternating residues (1, 3, 5, … or alternatively 2, 4, 6, …) can be superimposed, thus leading to topologically equivalent molecular surfaces formed by alternating residues. The epitope recognized by the antibody in this case is formed not by a linear array of residues, but by alternating residues. This suggest that a peptide antigen can display two recognition surfaces, one formed by residues in odd position, the other by residues in even position, and that probably both surfaces can take part in antibody recognition events, even independently. The cross-recognition dependence on the alternating linear array of side chains has been confirmed by experiments with sequence-simplified variants of the parent peptide, which represent a molecular dissection of the parent peptide side chains topology. Peptide variants, where only parent peptide side chains in alternating position were left, still retained a certain degree of cross-antigenicity. These findings have considerable significance for a more detailed understanding of antigen-antibody interaction and could constitute an interesting route to design sequence-simplified peptides able to cross-react with antibodies of predetermined specificity. In addition, the observed cross-reactivity between peptides displaying complementary side chains could suggest the possibility of incorporating a 2-fold antibody specificity on peptide antigens, by generating chimeric peptides characterized by side chains in alternating position belonging respectively to two different antigens. The structural model proposed in our study to explain cross-recognition between enantiomeric antigens is based on the assumption that peptide binding occur in an extended and flexible conformation. A growing number of linear peptide antigens are seen to adopt an extended conformation upon binding to the corresponding antibodies(25.Rini J.M. Schulze-Gahmen U. Wilson I.A. Science. 1992; 255: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 26.Rini J.M. Stanfield R.L. Stura E.A. Salinas P.A. Profy A.T. Wilson I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Similarly, extended conformations dominates T-cell epitope-major histocompatibility complex of class I or II complexes(28.Collins E.J. Garboczi D.N. Wiley D.C.

A. 1992; 89: 8403-8407Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Our study also points out that, at least in the case systems analyzed, topologically related variants of the parent antigen do not need end group modification to display cross-antigenicity. The generality of the phenomenon of antigenic cross-reactivity has also been confirmed with two other polyclonal antibodies raised against a multimeric 13 residue peptide (GFRKYLHFRRHLL) and a 14-residue peptide (RKFLAGLRARRLKF). In both cases the same type of antigenic cross-recognition was observed with the complete series of topochemically related peptides. 2A. Verdoliva, M. Ruvo, G. Cassani, and G. Fassina, manuscript in preparation. Inverso- and retro-inverso peptides are particularly stable to proteolytic treatments since their inverted chiral configuration is not easily recognized by enzymes, making these derivatives useful for their prolonged half-life in vitro and in vivo. The stability and cross-antigenicity of retro-inverso and inverso peptides could provide a novel and interesting route for the treatment of various diseases associated to the immune system(31.Weiner H.L.

To localize intracellular translocating Glut4, we studied the effects of brefeldin A (BFA), which disassembles Golgi and prevents trans-Golgi vesicular budding, on the glucose transport system. Isolated rat adipocytes were treated with and without both BFA (10 μg/ml) and insulin. BFA did not affect maximal rates of either 2-deoxyglucose or 3-O-methylglucose transport or the insulin:glucose transport dose-response curve but did increase basal transport by ~2-fold (p < 0.05). We also measured Glut4 in PM, low (LDM) and high density microsome subfractions. In basal cells, BFA increased PM Glut4 by 58% concomitant with a 18% decrease in LDM (p < 0.05). Insulin alone increased PM Glut4 by 3-fold concomitant with a 56% decrease in LDM. BFA did not affect insulin-induced changes in Glut4 levels in PM or LDM. Most intracellular Glut4 was localized to sub-PM vesicles by immunoelectron microscopy in basal cells, and BFA did not affect insulin-mediated recruitment of immunogold-labeled Glut4 to PM. In summary, 1) in basal cells, BFA led to a small increase in glucose transport activity and redistribution of a limited number of transporters from LDM to PM; 2) BFA did not affect insulin's ability to stimulate glucose transport or recruit normal numbers of LDM Glut4 to PM; and 3) insulin action is predominantly mediated by a BFA-insensitive pool of intracellular Glut4, which localizes to sub-PM vesicles.

The Glut4 transporter isoform predominates in insulin target tissues (fat and muscle) and mediates the bulk of insulin-stimulatable glucose transport activity.

After digestion, isolated cells were filtered through a fine nylon mesh, washed three to four times, and resuspended in the same buffer. Cells were incubated with or without BFA for 30-60 min, followed by treatment with or without insulin for 30 min. Glucose transport activity was determined as initial rates of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DOG) or 3-O-methylglucose (3-OMG) uptake. 2-DOG uptake was measured over 3 min (2-3 × 105 cells/ml) as described previously(11.Garvey W.T.

Nature. 1990; 346: 369-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). 35 μg of protein from each fraction was solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer (15.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204082) Google Scholar) and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1.5-mm slab gels, 7% polyacrylamide). Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose filters and incubated with Glut4- or Glut1-specific polyclonal antibodies (1:1000) followed by 125I-protein A. Relative levels of immunoreactive Glut4 and Glut1 were quantitated by densitometric analysis of autoradiographs. Isolated rat adipocytes were incubated for 1 h at 37°C with no addition or with 10 μg/ml BFA. Half of each set was then incubated for 30 min with no addition or with 100 ng/ml insulin. The cells were fixed and prepared as described previously (7.Smith R.M. Charron M.J. Shah N. Lodish H.F. Jarett L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6893-6897Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 16.Jarett L. Smith R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 68: 3526-3530Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar) for both routine electron microscopy, to assess the effects of BFA on Golgi structure, and immunoelectron microscopy, to examine effects of insulin and BFA on the cellular distribution of Glut4. Monoclonal antibodies MC2A and MC1A against Glut4 carboxyl- and amino-terminal, respectively, were employed. Immunolabeling and quantitative morphometric analysis of Glut4 associated with the PM and sub-PM invaginations and vesicles, and cytoplasmic vesicles were performed as described previously(7.Smith R.M. Charron M.J. Shah N. Lodish H.F. Jarett L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6893-6897Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We first studied whether BFA could affect glucose transport activity in intact cells. Isolated rat adipocytes were preincubated with increasing concentrations of BFA (0-10 μg/ml) for 30 min and then treated in the absence (basal) and presence of a maximally effective concentration (100 ng/ml) of insulin for 30 min at 37°C. Basal and maximal rates of 2-DOG uptake are shown in Fig. 1. BFA did not affect maximal insulin-stimulated glucose transport but, at concentrations of 5 and 10 μg/ml, increased basal 2-DOG transport rates by ~2-fold (p < 0.05). In addition, full dose-response curves, shown in Fig. 2, demonstrated that BFA at 10 μg/ml did not significantly affect the insulin ED50 for stimulation of 2-DOG uptake. We also examined whether BFA could alter basal and insulin-stimulated transport rates of 3-OMG, a glucose analog that is transported but not phosphorylated upon entry into the cell. Again, BFA (10 μg/ml) produced a moderate increase in basal transport (64%, p < 0.05) but did not affect maximal insulin-stimulated 3-OMG transport rates (Fig. 3). The increase in basal 2-DOG transport was fully reversed within 30 min after BFA removal, as shown in Fig. 4. However, as might be expected, insulin-stimulated 2-DOG transport was not affected by the addition or removal of BFA. In other experiments not shown, adipocytes were first stimulated with maximal insulin (100 ng/ml, 30 min, 37°C) and then exposed to 10 μg/ml BFA for 30 min. Pretreatment with insulin did not alter the results; BFA still was unable to affect insulin-stimulated 2-DOG transport. To examine whether BFA altered the subcellular localization of glucose transporters, PM, LDM, and HDM subfractions were prepared from cells preincubated with or without BFA and insulin, and transporter levels were quantitated by immunoblot analysis of membrane proteins. As shown in Fig. 5B, in basal cells, BFA increased Glut4 in the PM fraction by 58% concomitant with a 18% decrease in LDM (both p < 0.05). In cells treated with insulin alone, Glut4 was increased by ~3-fold in PM and was decreased by 56% in LDM. Importantly, BFA did not affect levels of Glut4 in PM from insulin-treated cells, or the Glut4 decrement in LDM. In both basal and insulin-stimulated cells, BFA did not alter HDM Glut4 content (Fig. 5B; p = not significant). The effect of BFA on glucose transporter distribution in basal cells was specific for Glut4; BFA had no significant effect on Glut1 subcellular distribution (data not shown). From the data in Fig. 5B, it is clear that even maximal insulin was unable to recruit all intracellular Glut4 in LDM to the PM; 40-45% of Glut4 remains associated with LDM as has been consistently reported by multiple investigators. Although BFA caused an 18% decrease in LDM Glut4 in both basal and insulin-stimulated cells, the absolute decrement in LDM Glut4 as a consequence of insulin stimulation was similar in cells treated with and without BFA. Therefore, the BFA-sensitive pool of LDM Glut4 appears to be distinct from insulin-responsive translocating Glut4. Table 1 shows quantitative morphometric analysis of immunolabeled Glut4 using two monoclonal antibodies. Studies using the amino-terminal antibody MC1A revealed that the majority of intracellular Glut4 was localized to sub-PM vesicles or PM invaginations in basal cells. Insulin treatment caused a significant translocation of sub-PM Glut4 to the cell surface. The carboxyl-terminal antibody MC2A preferentially recognizes insulin-activated Glut4(7.Smith R.M. Charron M.J. Shah N. Lodish H.F. Jarett L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6893-6897Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and studies using MC2A also revealed a large increase in “activated” Glut4 associated with the PM upon insulin stimulation (Table 1, Fig. 6, A and B). Quantitative analysis by IEM was not able to statistically resolve small changes in PM and LDM Glut4 as a consequence of BFA treatment in basal cells. Importantly, BFA had no effect on either translocation (MC1A) or activation (MC2A) of Glut4 by insulin (Table 1; Fig. 6C). Routine electron microscopy demonstrated that BFA treatment under these experimental conditions disrupted the Golgi complex in rat adipocytes (data not shown). Studies designed to localize the intracellular, insulin-sensitive, translocating pool of Glut4 have been controversial. Our experiments, using BFA, support the conclusion that the Golgi apparatus and trans-Golgi are not the major functional sources of Glut4 undergoing insulin-mediated translocation to PM in rat adipocytes. BFA is a fungal antibiotic that has been extensively used in studies of intracellular membrane trafficking. BFA causes a morphological disassembly of Golgi apparatus. It blocks transport of proteins into post-Golgi compartments in the cell and redistributes Golgi-resident proteins back into endoplasmic reticulum(17.Lippincott-Schwartz J. Donaldson J.G. Schweizer A. Berger E.C. Hauri H. Yuan L.C. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1990; 60: 821-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). BFA blocks constitutive secretion by preventing the formation of non-clathrin-coated vesicles required for vesicular transport through Golgi cisternae (10.Orci L. Tagaya M. Amherdt M. Perrelet A. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Klausner R.D. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1991; 64: 1183-1195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) as well as clathrin-coated vesicles that bud from trans-Golgi network(18.Robinson M.S. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1992; 69: 129-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Molecular mechanisms of BFA toxicity are not known; however, β-cop, ADP-ribosylation factor (components of non-clathrin-coated vesicles), as well as γ-adaptin (a component of clathrin-coated vesicles) are unable to bind to Golgi membranes and are released into cytosol. Blockage of vesicle assembly prevents anterograde transport of proteins from endoplasmic reticulum through Golgi to the cell surface. Thus, if intracellular translocating Glut4 derives from trans-Golgi, we would expect to see that insulin-stimulated glucose transport and Glut4 translocation are inhibited by BFA. However, in this study, we demonstrated that BFA did not affect insulin's ability to stimulate glucose transport or translocate normal numbers of intracellular Glut4 to PM. Immunoelectron microscopic studies confirm our biochemical data. As previously demonstrated(7.Smith R.M. Charron M.J. Shah N. Lodish H.F. Jarett L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6893-6897Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), the major pool of Glut4 undergoing insulin-mediated recruitment to the cell surface is morphologically localized to sub-plasma membrane vesicles or invaginations. The current data confirm this observation and show that BFA did not affect translocation of this pool of Glut4 to PM. We also found that BFA led to a small (~2-fold) increment in basal glucose transport activity, which corresponds with redistribution of a limited number of Glut4 from LDM to PM. The data in Fig. 5 define two functional pools of intracellular Glut4. BFA-sensitive Glut4 constitute a small pool of intracellular Glut4, which is recruited from LDM to PM subfractions upon treatment with doses of BFA known to disrupt Golgi. However, BFA did not affect insulin's ability to maximally stimulate glucose transport activity or translocate normal numbers of LDM Glut4 to PM. Thus, the BFA-sensitive pool is distinct from the absolute net decrement in LDM Glut4 observed as a consequence of maximal insulin stimulation. This latter insulin-responsive component comprises the largest pool of intracellular Glut4. The combined biochemical and immunocytochemical data indicate that the insulin-responsive pool is not located in trans-Golgi and more likely resides in PM invaginations, cell surface-connected vesicles, or sub-PM endosomal compartments(7.Smith R.M. Charron M.J. Shah N. Lodish H.F. Jarett L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6893-6897Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), which could sediment or cofractionate in the LDM subfraction. These ideas are consistent with data obtained using a hydrodynamic shearing technique applied to 3T3 cells before homogenization(8.Lange K. Brandt U. FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 459-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This procedure yielded a low density surface-derived vesicle fraction, which would sediment in LDM if shearing was not applied. It was shown that the low density surface-derived vesicle fraction contained nearly 60% of the cellular glucose transporters and the total insulin-sensitive transporter pool. Other authors have recently examined effects of BFA on Glut4 translocation. Chakrabarti et al.(19.Chakrabarti R. Buxton J. Joly M. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 261: 7926-7933Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) studied effects of BFA on glucose transport and transporter translocation in 3T3-L1 cells. Similar to our data in rat adipocytes, these authors found that BFA increased PM Glut4 by approximately 2-fold and did not impair insulin's ability to increase cell surface Glut4 concentration. However, BFA was found to inhibit both basal and insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity by up to ~60% with a half-maximal effect being observed at 10 μg/ml. They explained that BFA may directly inhibit the intrinsic activity of glucose transporters. We found no evidence in rat adipocytes that 10 μg/ml BFA inhibited intrinsic activity of glucose transporters. The reason for the difference in BFA effects between 3T3-L1 cells and rat adipocytes is not clear but could be explained by utilization of different cell systems or more generalized cellular toxicity at high BFA concentrations. Lachaal et al.(20.Lachaal M. Moronski C. Liu H. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23689-23693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have also studied the effects of BFA on glucose transport and transporter translocation in rat adipocytes. In their studies, BFA at 1 μg/ml inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose transport as well as redistribution of Glut4 from microsomes to PM. These data are not confirmed in the current study. There were some differences in experimental design. Lachaal et al.(20.Lachaal M. Moronski C. Liu H. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23689-23693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used 3-OMG equilibrium exchange to measure glucose transport activity and did not subfractionate total microsomes into LDM and HDM while studying Glut4 subcellular redistribution. However, it is not clear whether these differences can fully explain the discrepancies between the results. In the current study, we have performed morphological in addition to biochemical experiments, and both lines of investigation are consistent with the conclusion that BFA does not interfere with insulin's ability to stimulate glucose transport activity ot Glut4 translocation. In summary, we have shown that 1) in basal cells, BFA led to a small increase on glucose transport activity and to the redistribution of a limited number of Glut4 from LDM to the PM subfraction; 2) BFA did not affect insulin's ability to stimulate transport or recruit normal numbers of Glut4 to PM; 3) there are two functional pools of intracellular Glut4 in rat adipocytes, a large insulin-responsive pool, which is unaffected by BFA, and a smaller BFA-sensitive pool; and 4) BFA-insensitive Glut4, which translocate in response to insulin, are localized by IEM in sub-PM vesicles. In several human diseases characterized by insulin resistance such as obesity and Non-insulin-dependent Diabetes Mellitus, cellular depletion of Glut4 is a major mechanism of insulin resistance in adipocytes(21.Garvey W.T. Maianu L. Huecksteadt T.P. Birnbaum M.J. Molina J.M. Ciaraldi T.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1072-1081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, defects in translocation of Glut4 may be responsible for insulin resistance in skeletal muscle(22.Garvey W.T. Draznin B. LeRoith D. Molecular Biology of Diabetes. II. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1994: 437-471Google Scholar, 23.Garvey W.T. Zhu J.H. Maianu L. Brechtel G. Baron A. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 164Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that abnormalities in Glut4 trafficking may contribute to insulin resistance in adipocytes from women with gestational diabetes(24.Garvey W.T. Maianu L. Zhu J.H. Hancock J.A. Golichowski A.M. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1773-1785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Precise localization of the intracellular Glut4 pool and a better understanding of Glut4 trafficking will permit elucidation of translocation defects causing insulin resistance in human diseases."

Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1379-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Among their various functions, chaperonins have been shown to assist in the folding of many proteins. Widely studied representatives of the chaperonin family are the GroES and GroEL proteins of Escherichia coli(2.Tilly K. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 149: 1082-1088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Georgopoulos C. Ang D. Semin. Cell Biol. 1990; 1: 19-25PubMed Google Scholar). Recent models for chaperonin action have the larger of the two proteins, GroEL, binding partially folded protein intermediates(4.Bochkareva E.S. Lissin N. Girshovich A.S. Nature. 1988; 336: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). GroES participates in the cycle by modulating the ATPase activity of GroEL(5.Hendrix R.W. J. Mol.

In addition, the release of partially folded polypeptides has been proposed to be modulated by GroES(8.Azem A. Kessel M. Goloubinoff P. Science. 1994; 265: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 9.Weissman J.S. Kashi Y. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L.

Georgopoulos C. Gierasch L.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Structurally, GroES is a heptamer composed of seven identical 10-kDa subunits(6.Chandrasekhar G.N. Tilly K. Woolford C. Hendrix R.W. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12414-12419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The subunits are organized into a single ring structure. An x-ray crystal structure of the oligomer has been recently solved and shows the core of the protein to be organized as a topologically irregular β-barrel. 1Hunt, J. F., Weaver, A. J., Landry, S. L., Gierasch, L., and Deisenhofer, J. Nature, in press. A recent study has shown that there exists a dynamic equilibrium between monomeric and oligomeric GroES(12.Zondlo J. Fisher K.E. Lin Z. Ducote K.R. Eisenstein E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10334-10339Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In that report, GroES was shown to dissociate with a half time of a few minutes and a dissociation constant of 1 × 10−38M6(12.Zondlo J. Fisher K.E. Lin Z. Ducote K.R. Eisenstein E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10334-10339Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Those results indicate that, as with GroEL(13.Mendoza J.A. Demeler B. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2447-2451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), monomeric GroES may play an important functional role in the mechanism of chaperonin action. We have investigated the role of the C-terminal region of GroES in the oligomerization of the protein. The C-terminal sequence of GroES is resistant to proteolysis by carboxypeptidase Y in the absence of structural perturbants. However, in the presence of moderate concentrations of urea, a portion of the C-terminal sequence of GroES becomes susceptible to proteolysis. Under conditions that have been previously shown to allow for reassembly of urea denatured GroES, 2J. W. Seale, B. M. Gorovits, J. Ybarra, and P. M. Horowitz, submitted for publication. the truncated species is no longer able to oligomerize. Amino acid analysis reveals that the C-terminal 7 amino acid residues are released from GroES, giving the truncated species. Structurally, these residues appear to be important for the integrity of the monomer interface. All reagents were of highest purity available. Carboxypeptidase Y was purchased from Sigma and used without further purification. GroES was purified from E. coli containing the pND5 plasmid bearing the groESL operon as described previously (14.Staniforth R.A. Cortes A. Burston S.G. Atkinson T. Holbrook J.J. Clarke A.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) with slight modification. GroES that had been purified according to this method was further purified by gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-200 column. Fractions containing purified GroES were pooled, concentrated, and stored in 70% ammonium sulfate at 4°C. GroES (0.5 mg/ml) was incubated in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.2, and 100 mM NaCl containing various concentrations of urea (see figure legends) and 1% (w/w) carboxypeptidase Y. Digestion times were determined by removing aliquots at various times and analyzing the peptides by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15.Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10502) Google Scholar) and native gel electrophoresis(16.Neuhoff V. Cheong-Kim K. Altland K. Electrophoresis. 1986; 7: 56-57Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). GroES (0.5 mg/ml) was digested with carboxypeptidase Y (2%, w/w) in the presence of 3 M urea for 90 min. The entire sample was then dialyzed overnight at 4°C against 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and 100 mM NaCl to remove the urea. The oligomerization state of truncated GroES was determined by sedimentation velocity analysis using a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. For each run, GroES concentration was 0.5 mg/ml. The temperature was kept constant at 25°C. The rotor speed was 60,000 rpm for all samples. The scans were analyzed by the method of van Holde and Weischet (17.van Holde K.E. Weischet W.O. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 1387-1403Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar) using the UltraScan data collection and analysis program (B. Demeler, Department of Biochemistry, University of Texas Health Sciences Center, San Antonio, TX). All data were corrected for buffer density and viscosity. GroES (0.5 mg/ml) was treated with carboxypeptidase Y (2% w/w) in the presence of 3 M urea for 90 min. The sample was then placed in an Ultrafree-MC microconcentrator unit with a Mr 5000 cut-off (Millipore) in order to separate the amino acids from the protein mixture. The samples were centrifuged at 4500 × g until approximately 85% of the sample had passed through the membrane. Next, 200 μl of distilled H2O was added to the top portion of the filter unit. The sample was again centrifuged at 4500 × g until approximately 90% of the sample had passed through the membrane. The entire filtrate, approximately 500 μl, was saved for amino acid analysis. Amino acid analysis was performed using a Beckman 7300 analyzer using the ninhydrin reaction after the amino acids had been separated on a 20-cm high resolution ion exchange column. Detection of the derivatized amino acids was at 570 and 440 nm. The retention time and peak heights of the samples were compared with known standards to determine amino acid identity and quantity. The results from the amino acid analysis were compared to the published sequence of GroES to determine the site of truncation(18.Hemmingsen S.M. Woolford C. van der Vies S.M. Tilly K. Dennis D.T. Georgopoulos C. Hendrix R.W. Ellis R.J. Nature. 1988; 333: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows an SDS gel demonstrating the proteolysis of GroES by carboxypeptidase Y in the presence of moderate concentrations of urea. GroES in the absence of urea is not susceptible to proteolysis by carboxypeptidase Y (Fig. 1A, lane 0M). In the presence of either 3 M urea (Fig. 1A, lane 3M) or 4 M urea (Fig. 1A, lane 4M), a single proteolytic product is formed after 90 min. This product appears to be stable since subsequent digestion products do not appear on this time scale (data not shown). Examination of the properties of carboxypeptidase Y (19.Hayashi R. Moore S. Stein W. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2296-2302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) along with the primary structure of GroES does not reveal any indication that proteolysis should be inherently blocked at any point within 20 residues in the C-terminal sequence of GroES. In fact, after 24 h, significant further proteolysis is observed (data not shown). These results suggest that the initial truncation is retarded by the conformation of GroES. The proteolytic product also demonstrates an altered mobility during native gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1B, lanes 3M and 4M). Conditions were chosen from previous studies2 that would allow for reassociation of oligomers by dilution into an equal volume of buffer followed by electrophoresis (lanes denoted by B). Likewise, dilution of the sample into an equal volume of 9 M urea (lanes marked U) would allow for the dissociation of oligomeric GroES. A comparison in Fig. 1B of lane ES with lane U at 0 M urea shows that electrophoresis allows for the reassembly of samples that were originally at concentrations as high as 4.5 M urea. The digestion product has an altered mobility irrespective of the dilution conditions prior to electrophoresis. Analysis of the amino acids released from the limited proteolysis of GroES give the following ratios of amino acids: A:I:E:V:L, 2:2:1:1:1. When matched with the published sequence of GroES(18.Hemmingsen S.M. Woolford C. van der Vies S.M. Tilly K. Dennis D.T. Georgopoulos C. Hendrix R.W. Ellis R.J. Nature. 1988; 333: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar), this sequence corresponds to the 7 C-terminal amino acids of GroES (highlighted in bold): … EVLIMS.E.SDILAIVEA. This sequence corresponds to the predicted C-terminal strand in the GroES structure(20.Srinivasan R. Rose G.D. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 22: 81-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 21.Valencia A. Hubbard T.J. Muga A. Bañuelos S. Llorca O. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. Proteins Struct. Funct.

Bañuelos S. Llorca O. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 22: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Recent reports have described the reversible oligomerization of GroES under native conditions (12.Zondlo J. Fisher K.E. Lin Z. Ducote K.R. Eisenstein E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10334-10339Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) or from a urea-denatured state.2 The oligomerization state of the truncated GroES was investigated by sedimentation velocity analysis. GroES that had been digested with carboxypeptidase Y in the presence of 3 M urea was dialyzed against buffer to remove the urea and allow for reassembly of GroES. These dialysis conditions are sufficient for the reassembly of urea-dissociated GroES.2Fig. 2 shows the sedimentation velocity behavior of truncated GroES. The majority of the species has an s20w value of approximately 1 S. This value corresponds to the value previously reported for monomeric GroES.2 The sample also contains some larger species, as indicated by the nonuniformity of the plot(17.van Holde K.E. Weischet W.O. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 1387-1403Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Native gel electrophoresis reveals a small amount of heptameric GroES remaining in this sample prior to ultracentrifugation (data not shown) that would account for the heterogeneity of the plot. It is important to note that under conditions where the proteolysis is stopped prior to complete formation of the truncated species, the products consist of only heptameric and monomeric GroES. There are no other oligomeric species formed, i.e. dimers, trimers, etc. (data not shown). Several recent reports have focused on the structural characteristic of GroES1(20.Srinivasan R. Rose G.D. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 22: 81-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 21.Valencia A. Hubbard T.J. Muga A. Bañuelos S. Llorca O. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 22: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). It is believed that the oligomeric structure of GroES serves to coordinate the hydrolysis of ATP(22.Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Science. 1995; 265: 659-666Crossref Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 23.Gray T.E. Fersht A.R. FEBS Lett. 1991; 292: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 24.Bochkareva E.S. Lissin N.M. Flynn G.C. Rothman J.E. Girshovich A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6796-6800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported recently that GroES dissociates at relatively low concentrations(12.Zondlo J. Fisher K.E. Lin Z. Ducote K.R. Eisenstein E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10334-10339Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The dissociation of GroES suggests that the monomeric species may play a role in the chaperonin mechanism. The present work emphasizes the importance of the C-terminal sequence of GroES in the oligomerization of the protein. When these results are analyzed in the context of the recently solved x-ray crystal structure,1 the reasons become clear. The C-terminal 7 residues form the last β-strand. This β-strand makes the primary contacts with the N terminus of a neighboring monomer forming the interface between monomers. This interface is rich in flexible side chains, and the interface is described as having structural plasticity. In summary, the production of monomeric GroES by limited proteolysis provides a new avenue for the study of GroES function.

https://openalex.org/W2056605061,"The dominant Chinese hamster ovary cell glycosylation mutant, LEC18, was selected for resistance to pea lectin (Pisum sativum agglutinin (PSA)). Lectin binding studies show that LEC18 cells express altered cell surface carbohydrates with markedly reduced binding to 125I-PSA and increased binding to 125I-labeled Datura stramonium agglutinin (DSA) compared with parental cells. Desialylated [3H]Glc-labeled LEC18 cellular glycopeptides that did not bind to concanavalin A-Sepharose exhibited an increased proportion of species that were bound to DSA-agarose. Most of these glycopeptides bound to ricin-agarose and were unique to LEC18 cells. This fraction was purified from ~101010 cells and shown by 1H NMR spectroscopy and methylation linkage analysis to contain novel N-linked structures. Digestion of these glycopeptides with mixtures of β-D-galactosidases and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidases gave core glycopeptides that, in contrast to cores from parental cells, were mainly not bound to concanavalin A-Sepharose or to PSA-agarose. 1H NMR spectroscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectrometry, electrospray mass spectrometry, and collision-activated dissociation mass spectrometry showed that the LEC18 core glycopeptides contained a new GlcNAc residue that substitutes the core GlcNAc residue.

INTRODUCTIONThe N-linked carbohydrates of mammalian cells are initially synthesized on dolichol-phosphate, transferred en bloc to an Asn-X-(Ser/Thr) sequon, trimmed by glycosidases, and matured via the sequential action of a series of glycosyltransferases(1.Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3751) Google Scholar). The core region of a mature N-linked structure is the Manα(1,6)[Manα(1,3)]Manβ(1,4)GlcNAcβ(1,4)GlcNAc, originally synthesized on dolichol. In mammalian cells, only four types of core have been described: the Man3GlcNAc2Asn described above; Man3GlcNAc2(Fuc)Asn, where Fuc 1The abbreviations used are: FucfucoseXylxylosePSAP. sativum (pea) agglutininCHOChinese hamster ovaryLCAL. culinaris agglutininConAconcanavalin AL-PHAPhaseolus vulgaris leukoagglutininRCAIricin agglutinin IRCAIIricin agglutinin IIMS/MScollision-activated dissociation mass spectrometryPBSphosphate-buffered salineBSAbovine serum albuminGLC-MSgas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometryES-MSelectrospray mass spectrometryMALDI-TOF-MSmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectrometryDSAD. stramonium agglutinin. is linked O-6 to the Asn-linked GlcNAc; and cores, with or without Fuc, that contain a bisecting GlcNAc(2.Vliegenthart J.F.G.

Technol. 1993; 4: 73-76Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). By contrast, certain plant glycoproteins have N-linked carbohydrates with Xyl attached at O-2 of the β-1,4-linked Man and/or Fuc attached at O-3 of the Asn-linked GlcNAc (4.Ashford D. Dwek R.A.

A glycoprotein from honeybee has been reported to have two Fuc residues substituting the Asn-linked GlcNAc at O-3 and O-6(6.Staudacher E. Altmann F. Glossl J. Marz L. Schachter H. Kamerling J.P. Hard K. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). No substitutions of the latter types have been reported to date in mammalian glycoproteins(1.Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3751) Google Scholar, 2.Vliegenthart J.F.G. Dorland L. van Halbeek H. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem.

However, an altered N-linked core might be expected to be the basis of cellular resistance to the toxicity of pea lectin (PSA), because PSA binds specifically to the fucosylated core region of biantennary and β-1,6-branched, triantennary, N-linked carbohydrates(7.Kornfeld K. Reitman M.L. Kornfeld R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6633-6640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).LEC18 Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are rare mutants that were isolated following a selection for resistance to PSA(8.Ripka J. Stanley P. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1986; 12: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). They are 39-fold more resistant to PSA compared with parental cells. In addition, LEC18 cells are 16-fold more resistant to Lens culinaris agglutinin (LCA), a lectin with a very similar binding specificity to PSA(9.Cummings R.D. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11235-11240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The properties of LEC18 CHO cells are dominant in somatic cell hybrids formed with parental cells(8.Ripka J. Stanley P. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1986; 12: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), showing that their lectin resistance arises from a gain-of-function mutation. Other gain-of-function CHO glycosylation mutants include LEC10, LEC11, LEC12, LEC29, and LEC30(10.Stanley P. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Each of these mutants synthesizes cell surface carbohydrates carrying a sugar residue that is not synthesized by parental CHO cells and that confers a distinctive pattern of lectin resistance. In this paper, we show that LEC18 cells also synthesize a species of N-linked carbohydrate that is not present in parental cells, nor in any of the previously described dominant CHO mutants. These carbohydrates have a novel GlcNAc substitution in their core region, which markedly alters the conformation of the trimannosyl core and is likely to be the reason that LEC18 cells are highly resistant to both PSA and LCA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsD-[6-3H]Gal (31.5 Ci/mmol), D-[2-3H]Man (11.6 Ci/mmol), D-[6-3H]Glc (36.25 Ci/mmol), D-[U-14C]Glc (290 mCi/mmol), and L-[6-3H]Fuc (16.1Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Corp.; ConA-Sepharose and Sephadex G-25 were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc.; L-PHA-agarose, RCAI-agarose, RCAII-agarose, tomato-agarose, DSA and DSA-agarose, and PSA and PSA-agarose were from Vector; Bio-Gel P-2 (45-90 mesh), the Bradford protein reagent, and Chelex-100 (200-400 mesh) were from Bio-Rad.

Mayer Jr., H.E. Montgomery R. Carbohydr. Res. 1970; 13: 127-137Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar) were prepared from chicken egg ovalbumin (Sigma); biantennary GlcNAc terminating glycopeptides with no fucose (GnGn) were isolated as described previously (12.Stanley P. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 443-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) from human fibrinogen (Sigma), and the corresponding glycopeptides with fucose [GnGn(Fuc)] were from human IgG (Sigma). N,N′-diacetylchitobiose and N,N′,N”-triacetylchitotriose were isolated from chitin (Sigma) essentially as described by Rupley et al.(13.Rupley J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 83: 245-255PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeled Man3Gn2(Fuc)Asn core glycopeptide was prepared from a ConA-bound, PSA-bound fraction of parental [3H]Glc glycopeptides followed by acid hydrolysis to remove sialic acid residues and digestion with β-D-galactosidase (bovine testis) and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (Jack bean) to remove Gal and GlcNAc residues.Cell Lines and Cell CultureCHO cells were grown in suspension at 37°C in complete α medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum. Independent LEC18 isolates Pro−LEC18.21B and Gat−LEC18.14F were obtained from a selection for mutants resistant to the toxicity of PSA(8.Ripka J. Stanley P. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1986; 12: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Pro−5 parental CHO cells, Pro−Lec1.3C, and Pro−Lec13.6A CHO glycosylation mutants were described previously(14.Stanley P. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 157-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Binding of 125I-PSA and 125I-DSA to Whole CellsBinding experiments were performed as described previously (15.Stanley P. Sudo T. Cell. 1981; 23: 763-769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). PSA (15 μg) or DSA (30 μg) were iodinated to a specific activity of 5.6 × 107 and 0.2 × 107 cpm/μg protein, respectively using the chloramine-T method. 125I-Lectins were mixed with unlabeled lectins to obtain a range of 2 ng/ml to 200 μg/ml (including preparations of identical concentrations but different specific activities) in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 2% bovine serum albumin (PBS/BSA). Exponentially growing cells, washed 3 times with PBS/BSA, were added to 125I-lectin in a final volume of 100 μl. After 1 h at 4°C, cell-bound and free lectin were separated by centrifugation through 15% BSA and counted separately in a LKB γ-counter.Preparation of Radiolabeled Cell Surface GlycopeptidesSuspension cultures of Pro−5 and Pro−LEC18.21B cells were established at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/ml in complete medium, and 100 μCi of [3H]Glc was added to each 10-ml culture. Following a 48-h incubation at 37°C, the cells were washed 3 times with 10 ml of PBS containing 0.01 M Ca2+, 0.01 M Mg2+, 0.02% azide (PBS2+). Following extraction in 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8 containing 1% Nonidet P-40 for 5 min at 4°C and 5 min at room temperature, nuclei were removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was incubated with 1 mg/ml Pronase in 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 3 mM CaCl2 at 55°C under toluene. Additional Pronase was added every 24 h for 3 days. After boiling for 10 min, the sample was centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g, desalted on Bio-Gel P-2, and stored at −20°C.Lectin Affinity ChromatographyGlycopeptides were applied to a ConA-Sepharose column (0.5 cm × 20 cm) in ConA buffer (0.1 M sodium acetate, 0.01 M MgCl2, 0.01 M CaCl2, 0.01 M MnCl2, 0.02% sodium azide (pH 7.3)). The column was washed with at least 10 column volumes of ConA buffer, and bound glycopeptides were eluted with at least four column volumes of 10 mM methyl α-glucoside followed by 10 mM methyl α-mannoside and finally 200 mM methyl α-mannoside in ConA buffer. Glycopeptides were similarly fractionated on a PSA-agarose column (0.5 cm × 20 cm). Pooled glycopeptides were desalted on a Bio-Gel P-2 column (1.5 cm × 70 cm).Samples of glycopeptides were applied to L-PHA-agarose, RCAI-agarose, RCAII-agarose, tomato-agarose, or DSA-agarose columns in PBS2+ (pH 7.4), and the columns were washed with >8 column volumes of the same buffer. The addition of sugar was not required for elution of glycopeptides from the L-PHA-agarose column. Buffer containing 100-200 mM lactose was used to elute bound glycopeptides from RCAI-agarose and RCAII-agarose columns. The bound glycopeptides from tomato-agarose and DSA-agarose columns were eluted using a mixture of N,N′-diacetylchitobiose and N,N′,N”-triacetylchitotriose (7-10 mg/ml) in PBS2+ (pH 7.4). Chromatography was performed either at room temperature or at 4°C at flow rates of 6-10 ml/h.Purification of Glycopeptides for Structural AnalysisApproximately 1010 Pro−LEC18.21B cells were pelleted, washed twice with PBS2+, and incubated with 1 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2) containing 1.0% Nonidet P-40 on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at room temperature for 30 min at 3000 rpm, the supernatant was incubated with 1 mg/ml Pronase in 1 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 3 mM CaCl2 at 55°C under toluene. Fresh Pronase was added every 24 h for 5 days. After boiling for 10 min, the sample was centrifuged for 2 h at 30,000 rpm in a type 50 Ti rotor. The supernatant was loaded onto a column of Sephadex G-25 (5 cm × 65 cm). The column was eluted with glass distilled water, and fractions of 10 ml were assayed with phenol-sulfuric acid for neutral hexoses(16.Dubois M. Gills K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (39927) Google Scholar). Positive fractions were pooled, concentrated by rotoevaporation to 5 ml, and diluted with an equal volume of 2× ConA buffer. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was chromatographed on a column of ConA-Sepharose (1.5 cm × 22 cm). Unbound glycopeptides were desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column (5 cm × 65 cm), lyophilized, resuspended in 2 ml water, and adjusted to 10 mM HCl by adding 10 μl of aqueous 2 N HCl. After heating at 80°C for 1 h to hydrolyze bound sialic acid, the hydrolyzate was evaporated to dryness, co-evaporated with methanol to remove traces of acid, and passed through a column of Sephadex G-25. The desialylated glycopeptides, dissolved in 1 ml of PBS2+2+ were applied to tomato-agarose (0.5 cm × 20 cm). The unbound fraction was fractionated on DSA-agarose (0.5 cm × 20 cm). The DSA-retarded fraction was desalted on Bio-Gel P-2 (1.5 cm × 70 cm), lyophilized, dissolved in 1 ml of PBS, and chromatographed on a column of RCAII-agarose (0.5 cm × 20 cm). The column was eluted with 200 ml of PBS2+ followed by 100 ml of 100 mM lactose in PBS2+. Pooled fractions were desalted on Bio-Gel P-2. A portion of each glycopeptide fraction was subjected to monosaccharide analysis. The remainder was used to record 1H NMR spectroscopy and was subjected to methylation linkage analysis or treated with exoglycosidases to isolate core glycopeptides as described below.High Performance Anion-exchange Chromatography with Pulsed Amperometric Detection of Monosaccharides and GlycopeptidesFor monosaccharide analysis, glycopeptides (2-5 μg or 2000-4000 cpm) were hydrolyzed with 2 M trifluoroacetic acid or 4 M hydrochloric acid (100-200 μl) in Teflon-lined, screw capped Eppendorf tubes (Sarstedt) at 100°C for 4-5 h in a heating block filled with glycerine (Lab-Line Instruments, Inc.). After hydrolysis, samples were evaporated to dryness, resuspended in 50-100 μl of glass distilled water, passed through Centrex (Schleicher and Schuell, Inc.,) and analyzed by high performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (17.Hardy M.R. Townsend R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) using a model PAD-2 detector (Dionex Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) and a CarboPac PA1 (4 mm × 250 mm) pellicular anion-exchange column equipped with a CarboPac guard column. Eluant 1 was 200 mM NaOH, eluant 2 was water, eluant 3 was 500 mM NaOH, and eluant 4 was 100 mM NaOH containing 1 M NaOAc. Fuc, GlcN, GalN, Gal and Man were eluted isocratically with 16 mM NaOH. Unless otherwise mentioned, the flow rate was 0.9 ml/min for 25 min. The following pulse potentials and durations were used: E1 = 0.05 V (t1 = 300 ms); E2 = 0.65 V (t2 = 180 ms); E3 = −0.65 V (t3 = 60 ms). Detection was with 1000 nm full scale. No postcolumn base addition was used as no base-line drift was observed; a Dionex Advanced Computer Interface connected to a Gateway 2000, 4SX-33V computer with Dionex AI-450 (release 3.32.00) software was used to collect the data. For radiolabeled sugars, 50 fractions of 0.5 min (0.45 ml) were collected and mixed with 5 ml of Ecolume, and radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Glycopeptides, N-acetyl- and N-glycolylneuraminic acids were eluted using a gradient of 100 mM NaOH and 100 mM NaOH containing 1 M NaOAc. Elution was isocractic with 2% eluant 4 for 10 min, linearly increasing eluant 4 to 80% over 60 min, and finally, 80% eluant 4 isocratically for another 20 min using either CarboPac PA1 (4 mm × 250 mm) or Carbopac PA100 (4 mm × 250 mm) columns.1H NMR Spectroscopy at 500 MHzFor 1H NMR spectroscopy, glycopeptide samples were desalted 3 times on Bio-Gel P-2 (1.5 cm × 70 cm), passed through Chelex 100, exchanged in 99.6% D2O (Sigma) 3 times, and resuspended in 99.996% D2O (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) containing a small amount of acetone (Backer analyzed) as internal standard. Spectra were recorded on a 500 MHz Varian Spectrometer at 23, 32, or 42°C using a sweep width of 4000 Hz, a cycle delay time of 3 s, and 90° pulses. Chemical shifts were determined based on acetone being at 2.225 ppm.Methylation Linkage AnalysisGlycopeptides (~100 μg) were permethylated according to Hakomori(18.Hakomori S.-I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1964; 55: 205-209PubMed Google Scholar). The permethylated products were purified using a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters), hydrolyzed with 2 M trifluoroacetic acid, reduced with sodium borodeuteride, acetylated with pyridine-acetic anhydride, and analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (GLC-MS) as described(19.York W.S. Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Stevenson T.T. Albersheim P. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 118: 3-40Crossref Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). GLC-MS was performed with a Hewlett Packard 5890A gas liquid chromatograph using a SP-2330 column (Supelco) for analysis of neutral monosaccharide derivatives and a DB-1 column (J&Scientific) for the analysis of hexosamine derivatives, coupled to a Hewlett-Packard 5970 MSD mass spectrometer.Mass SpectrometryElectrospray-mass spectrometry (ES-MS) and MS/MS analysis of glycopeptides were performed on an API-III triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (PE-SCIEX, Ontario, Canada) using the SCIEX IonSpray interface with nitrogen as the nebulizer gas, an ion spray voltage of 3300, and the orifice at 35 or 70 V. The sample was infused into the mass spectrometer at 2 μl/min using a Harvard apparatus syringe pump after diluting 1:1 with 50% acetonitrile/H2O containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Collision-activated dissociation mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was performed using argon as the collision gas at a collision gas thickness of ~1 × 1010 molecules/cm2 and a collision energy of 30-35 eV. Under these collision-activated dissociation conditions, daughter ion spectra of selected parent ions were obtained.Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) was performed on a Voyager RP Biospectrometry work station (Perspective Biosystems, Framingham, MA), using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix. A laser power of 190 attenuator (nitrogen laser at 337 nm) was used, and an average of 50 scans were taken.Enzyme DigestionsJack bean β-D-galactosidase digestion was carried out in 100 μl of sodium citrate buffer (pH 3.5) at 37°C under toluene for 24-72 h with a total of 1 unit enzyme. Bovine testis β-D-galactosidase and Jack bean N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase digestions were performed in 100 μl of sodium citrate buffer (pH 4.5) at 37°C under toluene for 24-96 h with a total of 100 munits enzyme. D. pneumoniae β-D-galactosidase and N-acetyl-β-D-hexosaminidase digestions were performed in 50-100 μl of sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.0) at 37°C under toluene for 24-96 h, with a total of 100 milliunits of enzymes. Each reaction was started with 25 milliunits enzyme, and an additional 25 milliunits were added at 24-h intervals.RESULTSBinding of 125I-PSA and 125I-DSA to LEC18 CellsThe increased resistance of LEC18 cells to PSA and LCA (8.Ripka J. Stanley P. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1986; 12: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) is expected to be due to the expression of altered cell surface carbohydrates. As predicted, LEC18 mutants exhibited a marked (2-4-fold) reduction in 125I-PSA binding when compared with parental CHO cells over a broad range of PSA concentrations (Fig. 1). In the linear region of the binding curves, the differences in 125I-PSA binding were ~4-5-fold when the assay was performed at room temperature (data not shown). Two independently isolated LEC18 mutants exhibited a similar reduction in PSA binding. Lec13 CHO mutant cells were used as a negative control, as they synthesize N-linked carbohydrates that lack a core Fuc residue and hence do not bind to PSA (20.Ripka J. Adamany A. Stanley P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 249: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).Most CHO glycosylation mutants exhibit an increased sensitivity to and binding of certain lectins(21.Stanley P. Carver J.P. Arch. Exp. Med. Biol. 1977; 84: 265-282Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Such lectins, once identified, can be useful for affinity purification of novel glycopeptides. In binding experiments with a series of 125I-lectins, DSA was identified as binding better to LEC18 cells than to parental CHO cells (Fig. 1). DSA binds to poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains (22.Cummings R.D. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6253-6260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Cummings R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 130: 66-86Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and it can be seen that LEC18 cells bound significantly more 125I-DSA than parental cells. Both independent LEC18 mutants exhibited a similar increase in DSA binding. Lec1 CHO cells were used as a negative control, because they do not synthesize complex, N-linked carbohydrates(24.Robertson M.A. Etchison J.R. Robertson J.S. Summers D.F. Stanley P. Cell. 1978; 13: 515-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).A Glycopeptide Fraction Unique to LEC18 CellsThe increased binding of 125I-DSA by LEC18 cells would be consistent with increased affinity or increased synthesis of poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains(23.Cummings R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 130: 66-86Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To identify carbohydrates unique to LEC18 cells, detailed studies with metabolically labeled cellular glycopeptides were carried out by serial lectin affinity chromatography. ConA-Sepharose chromatography (25.Baenziger J.U. Fiete D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2400-2407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of [3H]Glc-labeled glycopeptides from parental and LEC18 CHO cells showed no significant differences in profile. About 85% of the label passed through the column, 5% bound and eluted in the biantennary fraction, while 10% bound and was eluted in the hybrid and oligomannosyl fraction. The glycopeptides that were not bound to the ConA-Sepharose column should include branched N-glycans with poly-N-acetyllactosamine units that would bind to DSA (22.Cummings R.D. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6253-6260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Cummings R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 130: 66-86Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These glycopeptides were subjected to mild acid hydrolysis to remove sialic acid residues and fractionated on a tomato-agarose column to identify any difference in branched poly-N-acetyllactosamine content(26.Merkle R.K. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8179-8189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In both cases, ~85% of the glycopeptides passed through the column, while ~15% were bound and eluted with N,N′,N”-triacetylchitotriose. However, a difference between parent and LEC18 glycopeptides was uncovered when the species that passed through tomato-agarose were fractionated on DSA-agarose. This glycopeptide fraction from LEC18 was largely retarded on (loosely bound to) DSA-agarose, whereas the same glycopeptide fraction from parental cells was largely unbound to the column (Fig. 2). Monosaccharide analysis of [3H]Glc-labeled DSA-retarded glycopeptides by high performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection showed evidence for the presence of only the expected N-linked sugar residues (Man, Gal, GlcNAc, Fuc) in the LEC18 glycopeptide fraction (data not shown).Fig. 2Lectin affinity chromatography of 3H-Glc-labeled glycopeptides. [3H]Glc-labeled glycopeptides that passed through ConA-Sepharose were desialylated, and fractionated on tomato-agarose. The unbound fraction was subsequently fractionated on DSA-agarose (upper panel). In the lower panel, the DSA-retarded fraction from parental CHO or LEC18 cells was fractionated on RCAII-agarose.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)About 65% LEC18 glycopeptides were retarded on the DSA-agarose column, but ~15% parental glycopeptides were also present in this pool. In order to separate glycopeptides unique to LEC18 cells, further fractionation of the DSA-retarded glycopeptides was performed on a series of lectin columns. A dramatic difference in elution profile was observed on RCAII-agarose (Fig. 2). LEC18 glycopeptides separated into late retarded (45%) and bound (55%) species, whereas parent glycopeptides eluted in the unbound (35%) or early retarded (65%) fractions, indicating that the glycopeptides derived from LEC18 cells were indeed unique to the mutant.LEC18 Glycopeptides Have an Altered N-Linked Core RegionTo determine whether the glycopeptides unique to LEC18 cells were altered in their core region, as might be expected from the PSA resistance of LEC18 cells, DSA-retarded glycopeptides of both parental and LEC18 cells (Fig. 2) were treated exhaustively with a mixture of bovine testis β-D-galactosidase and Jack bean N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase. The digestion products fractionated on Bio-Gel P-2 into two major glycopeptide pools (Vo in the excluded volume and Ve in the included volume) and two monosaccharide pools (Gal and GlcNAc) (Fig. 3). As the Vo fraction was complex and probably contained some partially digested material, the Ve fraction was choosed for further studies.Fig. 3Purification of [3H]Glc-labeled core glycopeptides. The DSA-retarded glycopeptides of LEC18 and parental CHO cells (Fig. 2) were, exhaustively, digested with bovine testis β-D-galactosidase and Jack bean N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase and chromatographed on a Bio-Gel P-2 column (1.5 cm × 70 cm) as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fractionation on ConA-Sepharose and PSA-agarose revealed a significant difference between Ve glycopeptides of LEC18 and parent cells. As would be expected, ~95% of parental CHO Ve glycopeptides did bind to ConA-Sepharose, indicating that they had been converted to trimannosyl cores (Fig. 4). By contrast, ~65% of LEC18 Vee glycopeptides did not bind to ConA-Sepharose (Fig. 4). These results suggested that the core glycopeptides from LEC18 cells have a modified structure. Similarly, for core glycopeptides obtained following exhaustive digestion with a mixture of β-D-galactosidase and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase from D. pneumoniae(27.Kobata A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), a much greater proportion of LEC18 Ve glycopeptides did not bind to ConA-Sepharose, compared with parental glycopeptides.Fig. 4ConA-Sepharose and PSA-agarose affinity chromatography. The Ve fraction obtained from Parent and [3H]Glc-labeled LEC18 cells (Fig. 3) was fractionated separately on ConA-Sepharose as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The LEC18 Veglycopeptides were also fractionated on PSA-agarose (lower panel). Fucosylated trimannosyl core glycopeptides from parent CHO cells were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” and chromatographed separately on PSA-agarose.

Clathrin-coated vesicles are organelles involved in a number of cellular transport processes including receptor-mediated endocytosis, transfer of proteins from the trans-Golgi network to a pre-lysosomal compartment (reviewed in (1.Smythe E. Warren G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 2.Pearse B.M.F. Robinson M.S. Annu. Rev.

Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1379-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The main constituent of coated vesicles is clathrin, a triskelion composed of three ~190-kDa subunits and three ~23-27-kDa light chains(5.Ungewickell E. Branton D.

In addition to clathrin, a number of proteins referred to as assembly proteins or adaptins copurify with coated vesicles (reviewed in (7.Keen J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar)). Under physiological conditions, these proteins induce polymerization of clathrin into artificial clathrin baskets that resemble coated vesicles (8.Zaremba S. Keen J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1339-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In addition, several of these proteins have been shown to bind to the cytoplasmic tails of receptors that are concentrated in clathrin-coated pits(9.Pearse B.M.F. EMBO J. 1988; 6: 2507-2512Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To date, four different assembly proteins have been discovered.

In vitro, both coated vesicles and clathrin baskets assembled from purified clathrin and assembly proteins are uncoated by hsp70 in an ATP dependent reaction(17.Greene L. Eisenberg E. J. Biol.

Cell. 1986; 45: 3-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). We recently found that, in addition to hsp70, a 100-kDa protein cofactor which appears to be auxilin is required for uncoating(20.Prasad K. Barouch W. Greene L. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23758-23761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Barouch W. Prasad K. Greene L. Eisenberg E. J. Biol.

(1995) Nature, in pressGoogle Scholar). Auxilin is heat sensitive, but while purifying auxilin we obtained evidence for a ~50-kDa heat-stable protein cofactor which, like auxilin, supported uncoating by hsp70. 2K. Prasad, W. Barouch, L. E. Greene, and E. Eisenberg, unpublished results. While attempting to purify this latter cofactor, we found that a protein fraction with a Mr of less than 50,000 was present in the 0.5 M Tris, pH 7.0, extracts of bovine brain coated vesicles which, rather than supporting uncoating by hsp70, actually suppressed it. Further examination of this fraction revealed it to contain a protein with strong clathrin polymerizing activity. We now report the purification of this 20-kDa protein and identify it as myelin basic protein (MBP). Superose-6 was obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Hydroxylapatite was from Calbiochem. Myelin basic protein (MBP) was from Sigma. The polyacrylamide gradient (4-20%) mini gels were from Integrated Separation Systems and the Mr standards used in the gels were from Bio-Rad. Endoproteinase Lys-C was from Boehringer Mannheim. Buffer A contained 0.1 M MES, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 0.02% NaN3, pH 6.5. Buffer B contained 0.5 M Tris-HCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.0. Buffer C consisted of 20 mM imidazole, 2 mM magnesium acetate, 10 mM ammonium sulfate, 25 mM KCl, and 1 mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.0. Coated vesicles were prepared according to the method of Prasad and Keen (22.Prasad K. Keen J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5590-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) which yielded a material rich in clathrin and assembly proteins similar to those obtained by using other published procedures. Clathrin, assembly proteins, and 100-kDa cofactor protein were obtained from the coated vesicles as reported previously(20.Prasad K. Barouch W. Greene L. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23758-23761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hsp70 was prepared as described previously (17.Greene L. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6682-6687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) employing a method which is similar to the method of Schlossman et al.(18.Schlossman D.M. Schmid S.L. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Assembly assays (7.Keen J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) were performed by combining clathrin with either high molecular weight assembly proteins or ~20-kDa protein in Buffer B followed by overnight dialysis against Buffer A. The resulting solutions were then centrifuged in a TL-100 ultracentrifuge at 400,000 × g for 6 min. The amount of clathrin assembled was quantified by SDS-gel electrophoretic analysis of the solutions before and after centrifugation. The composition of the assembled baskets was evaluated by suspending the pellets in Buffer A and analyzing by SDS-gel electrophoresis. An aliquot of the sample was also negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate and viewed in a Philips 410 electron microscope. Uncoating assays were performed as described previously(17.Greene L. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6682-6687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Schlossman D.M. Schmid S.L. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 28563-28568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dependence of this uncoating reaction on cofactor concentration was determined(20.Prasad K. Barouch W. Greene L. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23758-23761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Barouch W. Prasad K. Greene L. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28563-28568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal antisera to the ~20-kDa protein were raised in New Zealand White rabbits and supplied commercially by Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA. For the immunization, the pure protein was obtained from the Coomassie-stained protein bands of the SDS gels. The antiserum was further purified by affinity purification against the pure ~20-kDa protein. The polyclonal antiserum was used at a dilution of 1:10. The 20-kDa protein was digested with Lys-C endoproteinase overnight at 37°C at a enzyme to substrate ratio of 1 to 40. The resulting digest was chromatographed on a narrow-bore reverse phase column (Vydac 218 TP52) using an acetonitrile gradient containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Four peptides were subjected to amino acid sequence analysis on an ABI model 470A gas-phase sequencer equipped with an on-line model 120A PTH amino acid analyzer. Three of the four peptides were sequenced to their carboxyl-terminal while the fourth provided the first eight residues. SDS-PAGE was carried out using 4-20% acrylamide gradient gels from Integrated Separation Systems. The Coomassie Blue intensity of the protein bands on the gels was quantified using the LKB Ultroscan XL laser densitometer. Protein concentration of the 20-kDa protein was determined from the peptide chromophore absorbance of the protein at 205 and 215 nm(23.Scopes R.K. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 59: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Concentrations of the hsp70, clathrin, and assembly proteins were determined as described by Prasad et al.(20.Prasad K. Barouch W. Greene L. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23758-23761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Superose-6 column chromatography of a 0.5 M Tris, pH 7.0, extract of coated vesicles yielded the characteristic elution profile reported previously (7.Keen J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) with a major peak of clathrin followed by a broad peak containing assembly proteins (Fig. 1A). A small peak prior to clathrin contained aggregated clathrin and a small peak following the assembly protein peak contained several uncharacterized proteins that were previously ignored (Fig. 1B). The ~100-kDa protein cofactor subsequently identified as auxilin, which was found to be essential for the uncoating of clathrin baskets by hsp70, was purified from the descending portion of the assembly protein peak. At the end of the assembly protein peak we observed the presence of a heat-stable protein cofactor with Mr of ~55,000-60,000 which could substitute for auxilin in supporting the uncoating reaction. In the course of characterizing this protein, we found that some fractions in the minor peak that followed the assembly protein peak strongly suppressed the uncoating activity of hsp70, suggesting that they might be inducing the polymerization of clathrin. Preliminary work suggested that they were causing clathrin polymerization under the same conditions as the other assembly proteins which induce the formation of clathrin baskets. Recently Lindner and Ungewickell (24.Lindner R. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16567-16573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that clathrin assembly proteins can be efficiently purified by a cycle of clathrin basket formation, sedimentation of the baskets, and then refractionation of the dissolved baskets on a gel filtration column. Following this method, we combined clathrin from the major peak of the Superose-6 column with the low molecular weight fractions which caused polymerization of the clathrin. When this mixture was dialyzed against 0.1 M MES, pH 6.5, approximately half of the total clathrin polymerized. The polymerized clathrin was then sedimented, the pellet redissolved in 0.5 M Tris, pH 7.0, and rechromatographed on the Superose-6 column. The elution profile and SDS-gel electrophoretic pattern of the fractions obtained are shown in Fig. 2, A and B, respectively. Note that the polymerized clathrin apparently contained no high molecular weight assembly proteins, only relatively low molecular weight proteins (fractions 70-85) suggesting that one or more of these proteins was responsible for polymerizing the clathrin. Each fraction of the redissolved polymerized clathrin eluted from the Superose-6 column chromatography was tested for its ability to polymerize fresh clathrin. The fractions that had the highest activity (fractions 74-81) were then pooled and fractionated further on a hydroxylapatite column, equilibrated in 0.5 M Tris, pH 7.0. Fig. 3 shows the SDS-gel electrophoretic pattern of both the flow-through fractions and the proteins that are eluted with 0.5 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. The flow-through fractions contained predominantly a protein of Mr~20,000 and examination of the assembly activity of these fractions suggested that they accounted for ~80% of the total clathrin assembly activity. The lower molecular weight bands are probably digestion products of the 20-kDa protein since their amount increases during the hydroxylapatite chromatography. Therefore, it appears that this 20-kDa protein was able to strongly induce clathrin polymerization. Table 1summarizes the purification of this protein; approximately 40% of the protein was recovered with a 6-fold increase in specific activity.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To determine whether the 20-kDa protein was a proteolytic digestion product of one of the higher molecular weight assembly proteins, a polyclonal antibody was raised against the 20-kDa protein and its immunoreactivity tested against the other assembly protein fractions. Fig. 4 shows that this antibody only recognized the 20-kDa protein on immunoblots and did not cross-react with a pool of mixed assembly proteins (lane 1), AP180 containing fractions (lane 2), or AP-2 purified by hydroxylapatite chromatography (lane 3). These data suggest that the 20-kDa protein was not a proteolytic digestion product of one of the higher molecular weight assembly proteins. To confirm this point we tested whether the 20-kDa protein had any sequence homology to the other assembly proteins. The protein was digested with endoproteinase Lys-C and four pure peptides ranging from 9 to 17 amino acids were sequenced. Surprisingly, all four peptides showed 100% identity to MBP(25.Eylar E.H. Brostoff S. Hashim G. Caccam J. Burnett P. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5770-5784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Brostoff S.W. Reuter W. Hichens M. Eylar E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 2: 559-567Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), suggesting that the 20-kDa protein may, in fact, be myelin basic protein (Fig. 5). In accordance with this view, we found that commercially obtained MBP (from Sigma) assembled clathrin as efficiently as the 20-kDa protein which we isolated. We therefore conclude that the 20-kDa assembly protein which we isolated was MBP.Fig. 5Sequence analysis of the ~20-kDa protein. The protein was digested with endoproteinase Lys-C and four peptides P1, P2, P3, and P4 were sequenced after fractionation on high performance liquid chromatography. The peptide sequences were aligned with the sequence of bovine myelin basic protein(25.Eylar E.H. Brostoff S. Hashim G. Caccam J. Burnett P. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5770-5784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Brostoff S.W. Reuter W. Hichens M. Eylar E.H. J. Biol.

Myelin: Biology and Chemistry. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992Google Scholar). Therefore, it was important to determine if the polymerization of clathrin induced by MBP was a specific effect. To investigate this question we first determined the ratio of MBP to clathrin required for polymerization. Various amounts of MBP were combined with a constant amount of clathrin and dialyzed against 0.1 M MES, pH 6.5, for 15 h. An aliquot of each sample was then centrifuged, and the supernatant assayed for unpolymerized clathrin using SDS-gel electrophoresis. Fig. 6A shows that as the amount of MBP was increased, increasing amounts of clathrin sedimented. As has been observed with other assembly proteins, the plot of clathrin polymerized versus 20-kDa protein added was sigmoidal (Fig. 6B). The midpoint of the plot suggested that half-maximal assembly required about 3 molecules of 20-kDa protein per triskelion. In agreement with this stoichiometry, examination of a pellet of the polymerized clathrin by SDS-gel electrophoresis (Fig. 6A, lane 12) showed that each triskelion was associated with about 3 MBP molecules. Therefore the ratio of MBP required for clathrin assembly is similar to that observed with AP-2 and auxilin where three molecules are needed to assemble each triskelion in contrast to AP180 where only one molecule is required per clathrin assembled(15.Murphy J.E. Pleasure I.T. Puszkin S. Prasad K. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4401-4408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Ahle S. Ungewickell E. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 28563-28568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We next used electron microscopy to determine the structure of the clathrin polymerized by MBP. Negative staining revealed characteristic basket-like structures resembling the structures seen with AP180(16.Ahle S. Ungewickell E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) or AP-2(10.Keen J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The MBP-clathrin baskets were predominantly 85-90 nm diameter (Fig. 7). Their size was somewhat more heterogeneous than occurs with AP180-clathrin baskets or with AP-2-clathrin baskets. Similar size heterogeneity was recently observed for clathrin baskets assembled with auxilin(16.Ahle S. Ungewickell E. J.

As noted above, we recently determined that a 100-kDa protein cofactor, probably auxilin, is required for the uncoating of clathrin baskets assembled by AP-2 (20.Prasad K. Barouch W. Greene L. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23758-23761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or AP180(21.Barouch W. Prasad K. Greene L. Eisenberg E. J. Biol.

(1995) Nature, in pressGoogle Scholar). Fig. 8 shows that a similar effect occurs with clathrin baskets assembled by MBP; like the AP-2-clathrin and the AP180-clathrin baskets, the MBP-clathrin baskets were uncoated by hsp70 in a cofactor dependent manner. Furthermore, the time course of uncoating was similar to that observed with coated vesicles, AP-2-clathrin baskets, and AP180-clathrin baskets (data not shown). Therefore, the MBP-clathrin baskets appear to be similar to the other clathrin substrates in their ability to be uncoated by hsp70. Since MBP is a basic protein, we were interested in determining whether other basic proteins could also induce clathrin basket formation. Table 2 shows that, of the five proteins tested, three had no effect on the clathrin. The other two proteins, histone I and the polylysines, did affect the clathrin. However, with these proteins we could not detect polymerization of the clathrin into baskets. Rather, even at very low ratios of these proteins to clathrin, the clathrin precipitated in proportion to the amount of basic protein added and electron microscopy of the precipitates revealed no basket-like structures (data not shown).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Like the previously discovered higher molecular weight clathrin assembly proteins, AP-1, AP-2, AP180, and auxilin, MBP copurifies with coated vesicles and interacts with clathrin in vitro under physiological conditions inducing it to polymerize into baskets. Furthermore, like the plasma membrane-associated assembly protein, AP-2 (and perhaps the trans-Golgi membrane associated assembly protein, AP-1), MBP catalyzes the polymerization of clathrin with a defined stoichiometry of 3 MBP molecules per clathrin triskelion. Therefore, MBP is acting like a clathrin assembly protein. MBP accounts for a little less than half of the total clathrin-assembly promoting activity in bovine brain coated vesicles isolated by conventional differential gradient centrifugation procedures. However, this does not mean that, in vivo, MBP makes up half of the assembly proteins present in coated vesicles. Since MBP is associated with myelin(27.Martenson R.J. Myelin: Biology and Chemistry. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992Google Scholar), the percentage of MBP present in our preparation of clathrin-coated vesicles may reflect the amount of white matter present in the bovine brain starting material from which we isolate the vesicles rather than the amount of MBP directly involved as a clathrin assembly protein. Since MBP is a strongly basic protein, the question arises as to whether its ability to polymerize clathrin is a nonspecific effect. It has previously been reported that several basic compounds enhance the rate of clathrin polymerization(28.Nandi P.K. Van Jaarsveld P.P. Lippoldt R.E. Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6706-6710Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, these studies were carried out before assembly proteins were discovered (8.Zaremba S. Keen J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1339-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and therefore the clathrin used may have been contaminated with assembly proteins. In addition, turbidity was used to follow polymerization and therefore it was not clear if the clathrin was actually forming baskets or was simply being precipitated by the basic proteins tested. In our experiments on the effect of basic proteins on clathrin polymerization, we found that 3 of the basic proteins we tested did not assemble clathrin even at 5-10-fold higher concentrations than the concentration where MBP is effective. Two proteins, histones and polylysines, did precipitate the clathrin but the precipitate did not exhibit any structure when viewed by electron microscopy nor did hsp70 depolymerize the precipitate. This is in contrast to the effect of MBP where the polymerized baskets appear normal by electron microscopy and are normally uncoated by hsp70 both in regard to the time course of uncoating and the requirement for 100-kDa cofactor. Finally, in contrast to the action of the histone and polylysines, where clathrin precipitated even at low ratios of basic protein to clathrin, with MBP the polymerization of clathrin had a simple stoichiometry of 3 MBP molecules per clathrin. Therefore, we were not able to duplicate the effect of MBP by using other basic proteins, which suggests that the effect of MBP may be specific. MBP is a major component of the myelin membrane and is present in the oligodendrocytes which form myelin(29.Pfeiffer S. Warrington A.E. Bansal R. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 191-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that changes in MBP cause pathological changes in the function of myelin, the exact function of MBP in the formation and properties of myelin are not known(30.McKhann G.M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1982; 5: 219-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recently it has been reported that, like other proteins, e.g. STOP 220, MBP stabilizes microtubules derived from bovine brain (31.Pirollet F. Derancourt J. Haiech J. Job D. Margolis R.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8849-8855Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) which may be related to the observation that MBP is associated with microtubules in oligodendrocyte cell cultures(32.Dyer C.A. Benjamins J.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 24: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 33.Dyer C.A. Benjamins J.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 24: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that MBP forms a bridge between clathrin-coated vesicles and microtubles. However, as yet, there is no direct evidence that MBP is associated with clathrin in vivo. Clathrin-coated vesicles have been observed in specialized regions of the axolemma, at the site of adhesion between the axon and its myelinating process; it has been suggested that these coated vesicles may be involved in the insertion or deletion of the junctional membrane (34.Sims T.J. Gilmore S.A. Waxman S.G. Dev. Brain Res. 1988; 40: 223-232Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, a large amount of endocytosis occurs in oligodendrocytes because of their uptake of iron by the transferrin pathway(35.Beard J.L. Connor J.R. Jones B.C. Nutrition Rev. 1993; 51: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). It is possible that MBP may be involved in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles in one or both of these processes. In any case, whether or not MBP interacts with clathrin in vivo, its easy availability and small size should make it very useful in studying the mechanism of the assembly of clathrin into clathrin baskets and the disassembly of these baskets by hsp70. We thank Dr. Blair Bowers for electron micrographs of baskets and Dr. Danny Sackett for helpful discussions. We also appreciate the technical assistance of Joe Kilheeney."
https://openalex.org/W1505995599,"The NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of muscle caldesmon are separated by a long alpha-helical stretch. Cys-580, in the COOH-terminal domain, can be rapidly and efficiently disulfide-cross-linked to Cys-374 of actin by incubation with actin modified with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Graceffa, P., and Jancso, A. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 20305-20310). Upon further incubation (+/- tropomyosin), a second cross-link was slowly formed between Cys-153 in the NH2-terminal domain and Cys-374 of another actin monomer. The yield of the second cross-link was relatively insensitive to increasing ionic strength, whereas the caldesmon-actin binding strength decreased considerably, suggesting that the NH2-terminal domain is largely dissociated from actin and becomes slowly cross-linked to it during collisions with the actin filament. In support of these conclusions, the yield of photocross-linking actin to caldesmon specifically labeled with benzophenonemaleimide at Cys-580 was high, but close to zero for caldesmon labeled at Cys-153, and the fluorescence intensity and polarization of tetramethylrhodamine iodoacetamide attached to Cys-580 showed large changes, while there were no changes for the probe at Cys-153 upon binding caldesmon to actin (+/- tropomyosin). These findings are consistent with the knowledge that COOH-terminal fragments of caldesmon bind to actin, whereas NH2-terminal fragments do not. Since the NH2-terminal domain of caldesmon binds to myosin, a dissociated NH2-terminal domain may account for caldesmon's ability to link myosin and actin filaments."

This investigation studied the pharmacological induction of HSP 68 (HSP 68 is the rat homolog of human HSP 70) by 1,10-phenanthroline in cultured rat astrocytes under conditions that activated heat shock transcription factor-1 without inducing HSP 68 synthesis. Two conditions that activate heat shock transcription factor-1 and promote its binding to the heat shock element without subsequent transcription of HSP 68 mRNA, intracellular acidosis and exposure to salicylate, showed synthesis of HSP 68 when 1,10-phenanthroline was added to culture medium after the activation of heat shock transcription factor-1. 1,10-phenanthroline mimicked heat shock by inducing HSP 68 mRNA and protein under both conditions. 1,10-phenanthroline added alone to culture medium did not induce the synthesis of HSP 68 or activate heat shock transcription factor-1. These findings strongly suggest a multistep activation for HSP 68 synthesis and also demonstrate that the synthesis of HSP 68 can be pharmacologically regulated.

These findings strongly suggest a multistep activation for HSP 68 synthesis and also demonstrate that the synthesis of HSP 68 can be pharmacologically regulated. The heat shock response is highly conserved and well described in procaryotes, eukaryotes, and plants(1.Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. Stress Proteins in Biology and Medicine. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1990Google Scholar). It appears to be highly involved in the survival of cells from extreme physiological stress due to heat exposure (1.Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. Stress Proteins in Biology and Medicine.

Immunol. 1989; 19: 1413-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The heat shock response is characterized by the synthesis of a number of proteins known as heat shock proteins (HSPs)( 1The abbreviations used are: HSPheat shock proteinHSEheat shock elementsHSFheat shock transcription factor-1DMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumTBSTris-buffered saline.) (1.Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. Stress Proteins in Biology and Medicine. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1990Google Scholar). Of these the most extensively studied is HSP 70, a highly inducible protein associated with thermotolerance(1.Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. Stress Proteins in Biology and Medicine. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1990Google Scholar). It is known to be regulated at the transcriptional level through heat shock elements (HSE), which are activated by binding of the active form of heat shock transcription factor-1 (HSF-1) to the HSE after heat shock(7.Morimoto R.I. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21987-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After HSF-1 binds to the upstream promoter elements of the HSP 70 gene during heat shock, transcription of HSP 70 mRNA is rapidly induced. However, there are specific conditions that activate HSF-1 and promote its binding to the HSE within the promoter region but do not result in significant transcription of HSP 70 mRNA. Two of these conditions are well described, induced intracellular acidosis (8.Mosser D.D. Kotzbauer P.T. Sarge K.D. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3748-3752Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 9.Larson J.S. Schuetz T.J. Kingston R.E.

Science. 1992; 255: 1243-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). It is inferred from those studies that the induction of HSP 70 mRNA is at least a two-step regulated process. The exact mechanism of induction of transcription of HSP 70 mRNA after activation of HSF-1 is not fully understood. This paper describes the induction of rat HSP 68 mRNA and HSP 68 protein, the homolog of human HSP 70, in cultured rat astrocytes after exposure of cells to mild acidosis and sodium salicylate by the addition of 1,10-phenanthroline (1,10-PA), a potent intracellular chelator of iron (11.Privalle C.T. Kong S.E. Fridovich I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2310-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and DNA intercalating agent (12.Veal J.M. Rill R.L.

We have been interested in the induction of HSP 68 in the central nervous system because of its association with cell protection. We have noted that HSP 68 was synthesized when cultured rat astrocytes were exposed to extremely acidic culture medium of pH 5.5(13.Nishimura R.N. Dwyer B.E. Cole R. deVellis J. Picard K. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 180: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, this induction was minimal when astrocytes were exposed to medium, pH 6.0. We have also noted in separate experiments that cultured astrocytes exposed to 0.7 μM H2O2 could induce small amounts of HSP 68(14.Nishimura R.N. Dwyer B.E. Cole R. de Vellis J. Gorio A. Perez-Polo J.R. deVellis J. Haber B. NATO ASI Series. 1122. Springer-Verlag Press, Berlin1988: 229-231Google Scholar). Two papers have described acidosis-induced activation and binding of HSF-1 to the HSE without subsequent synthesis of HSP 70(8.Mosser D.D. Kotzbauer P.T. Sarge K.D. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3748-3752Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 9.Larson J.S. Schuetz T.J. Kingston R.E. Nature. 1988; 335: 372-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). A goal of our research is to enhance the synthesis of HSP 68 in the central nervous system after pathological stresses in an attempt to protect neurons and glial cells from injury or death. A strategy of exposing cultured astrocytes to two mild stressful conditions, 0.7 μM H2O2 in mildly acidotic medium, pH 6.0, was chosen to increase HSP 68 synthesis. As a control for those experiments we added the iron chelator, 1,10-phenanthroline (1,10-PA), to the medium to inhibit the effect of H2O2. This compound inhibits the Fenton reaction by chelating iron necessary in the production of hydroxyl radicals, which presumably would produce oxidative stress resulting in HSP 68 synthesis. However, we found the opposite effect, specifically, that the addition of 1,10-PA resulted in increased synthesis of HSP 68. Subsequent experiments based on those findings are reported in this paper. Rat forebrain astrocytes were prepared from 1-2-day-old rat pups by methods previously described in our laboratory (15.Cole R. de Vellis J. Shahar A. de Vellis J. Vernadakis A. Haber B. A Dissection and Tissue Culture Manual of the Nervous System. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1989: 121-133Google Scholar). Mixed glial cultures were grown in 75-cm2 flasks for 8-10 days in vitro, when oligodendrocytes were shaken from the flasks. At 20-30 days in vitro, these primary astrocyte cultures were dissociated with 2.5% trypsin and replated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/25-cm2 flask. Feeding medium consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Ham's F-12 medium (1:1), DMEM/F-12, pH 7.4, buffered with NaHCO3 (1.2 g/liter) and HEPES (3.6 g/liter) and supplemented with 5% calf serum (v/v). Astrocytes were grown for 14-21 days in vitro until used for experiments. Astrocytes were greater than 98% pure by glial fibrillary acidic protein immunostaining. Cells were switched to serum-free buffered DMEM/F-12 medium for experiments unless otherwise noted. Prewarmed (37°C) DMEM/F-12 was used to wash the cells three times prior to the final feeding of 5 ml of DMEM/F-12 per flask. The cells were then equilibrated at 37°C for approximately 15 min prior to experiments. Buffered DMEM/F-12 medium was adjusted to indicated pH levels with concentrated HCl. 1,10-phenanthroline (Aldrich) and neocuproine, 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (Aldrich) were solubilized in absolute ethanol. Deferoxamine (Sigma) and sodium salicylate (Sigma) were dissolved in DMEM/F-12. Cells were exposed to acidic medium or salicylate for 15 min prior to the addition of 1,10-PA, neocuproine, or deferoxamine. Incubation with the additives was for an additional hour. Heat shock and protein labeling were performed as per previous descriptions(16.Nishimura R.N. Dwyer B.E. Welch W. Cole R. de Vellis J. Liotta K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1988; 20: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 17.Nishimura R.N. Dwyer B.E. Clegg K. Cole R. de Vellis J. Mol. Brain Res. 1991; 9: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). After the pharmacological exposure, astrocytes were washed in fresh methionine-deficient DMEM, 37°C, and labeled with 30 μCi/ml Tran35S-label methionine (ICN) for 3 h. Cells were harvested after washing with ice cold 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and total cellular protein was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid supplemented with 0.1% methionine. Trichloroacetic acid was removed, and cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Total cellular precipitated proteins were scraped from the flasks, pelleted, and solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer(17.Nishimura R.N. Dwyer B.E. Clegg K. Cole R. de Vellis J. Mol. Brain Res. 1991; 9: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Aliquots for protein determination and counts per minute were taken. Total cellular proteins were separated on 12% polyacrylamide slab gels with 4% stacking gels as described previously(17.Nishimura R.N. Dwyer B.E. Clegg K. Cole R. de Vellis J. Mol. Brain Res. 1991; 9: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Western blots were prepared as described previously(16.Nishimura R.N. Dwyer B.E. Welch W. Cole R. de Vellis J. Liotta K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1988; 20: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 17.Nishimura R.N. Dwyer B.E. Clegg K. Cole R. de Vellis J. Mol. Brain Res. 1991; 9: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore Corp.) or nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) by applying a current of 0.3 A for 16-18 h in a Bio-Rad transblotting cell. Immunostaining was performed as described previously in our laboratory(16.Nishimura R.N. Dwyer B.E. Welch W. Cole R. de Vellis J. Liotta K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1988; 20: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 17.Nishimura R.N. Dwyer B.E. Clegg K. Cole R. de Vellis J. Mol. Brain Res. 1991; 9: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked overnight in 5% powdered milk in 20 mM Tris, 137 mM NaCl, pH 7.6 (Tris-buffered saline; TBS). Membranes were then incubated with antibodies diluted in 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS, pH 7.6, 1:1000 or 1:2000, for 2 h. The remainder of the protocol was per manufacturer's recommendations (ECL from Amersham Corp. or ABC kit from Vector Labs). Monoclonal antibody C-92, specific for human HSP 70, was a gift from W. Welch (University of California, San Francisco). It has been previously tested in our laboratory and is specific for the rat homolog of HSP 70, a 68-kDa protein(16.Nishimura R.N. Dwyer B.E. Welch W. Cole R. de Vellis J. Liotta K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1988; 20: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 17.Nishimura R.N. Dwyer B.E. Clegg K. Cole R. de Vellis J. Mol. Brain Res. 1991; 9: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Other antibodies specific to HSPs 104, 90, and 27 (Affinity Bioreagents) diluted 1:1000 in TBS were also used in immunoblotting experiments. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against mouse HSF-1 was kindly provided by R. I. Morimoto, Northwestern University (18.Sarge K.D. Zimarino V. Holm K. Wu C. Morimoto R.I. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1902-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and diluted 1:2000 in TBS for immunoblots. Quantitation of immunoreactivity was performed on a Bio-Rad GS-670 densitometry imaging system in the linear range of the densitometer. Total cellular RNA preparation was performed as described in a previous publication (17.Nishimura R.N. Dwyer B.E. Clegg K. Cole R. de Vellis J. Mol. Brain Res. 1991; 9: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Total RNA was separated on 1.4% agarose gels and blotted on nitrocellulose membranes as described previously(17.Nishimura R.N. Dwyer B.E. Clegg K. Cole R. de Vellis J. Mol. Brain Res. 1991; 9: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 19.Dwyer B.E. Nishimura R.N. Lu Shi-Yi. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 30: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). After transfer, blots were sealed in plastic, prehybridized for 2 h at 65°C, and hybridized overnight at 65°C using a 32P-labeled riboprobe(17.Nishimura R.N. Dwyer B.E. Clegg K. Cole R. de Vellis J. Mol. Brain Res. 1991; 9: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Blots were then treated with RNase A and thoroughly washed with buffer, dried, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR-5 film for autoradiography. Astrocytes exposed to pH 6.0 medium and 1,10-PA induce HSP 68 synthesis, while exposure to pH 6.0 medium or 1,10-PA alone had no effect on HSP 68 synthesis (Fig. 1A). Repeated experiments resulted in similar results (data not shown). In addition it appears that HSC 70 is not induced in 1,10-PA-treated astrocytes when compared with the control heat shock astrocytes. Northern blot analysis for HSP 68 mRNA showed that astrocytes treated with the combination of pH 6.0 medium and 1,10-PA produced a transient early induction of HSP 68 mRNA (Fig. 1B). This was similar to that produced by heat shock(17.Nishimura R.N. Dwyer B.E. Clegg K. Cole R. de Vellis J. Mol. Brain Res. 1991; 9: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Since 1,10-PA is an iron chelator, other chelating agents were tested for similar properties of inducing HSP 68 synthesis. Fig. 1A shows that neocuproine, a compound chemically related to 1,10-PA, which more selectively chelates copper ion when added to medium, pH 6.0, also induced HSP 68 as well as 1,10-PA. However, incubation of the cells in pH 6.0 medium with deferoxamine, an iron chelator chemically unrelated to 1,10-PA, did not result in synthesis of HSP 68 (Fig. 1A). This suggested that iron chelation was not the mechanism of HSP 68 induction in those experiments and that the similar structures of 1,10-PA and neocuproine were important in the induction. Further experiments showed that astrocytes exposed to pH 5.5 medium plus 1,10-PA markedly increased HSP 68 synthesis when compared with pH 5.5 medium alone (Fig. 2, A and B). Western blot analysis for HSP 68 was compared with the induction of HSP 90 (Fig. 2B). The induction of HSP 90 was less than that for HSP 68. Western blot analysis for HSP 104 and 27 were inconclusive due to significant background staining (not shown). The ability of 1,10-PA to induce HSP 68 synthesis under acidotic conditions might be relevant to expressing HSP 68 in clinical conditions where acidosis is created such as cerebral ischemia and trauma.Figure 2:A, autoradiograph of [35S]methionine-labeled astrocyte protein in pH 5.5 medium. Enhanced HSP 68 synthesis in astrocytes were incubated in pH 5.5 medium for 2 h with and without 50 μM 1,10-PA and then switched to methionine-deficient DMEM, pH 7.4 for labeling. Control medium was pH 7.4 and then switched to methionine-deficient medium for labeling. Cells were labeled for 3 h and then harvested for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. HSP 68 and 70 are indicated on the right. Equal counts per minute were compared from each sample. B, Western blot of the samples in A. Each lane represents 20 μg of total cellular protein. The membrane was probed for HSP 68 and HSP 90. In this particular experiment, densitometry showed a 1.4- and 2.4-fold increase of HSP 68 immunoreactivity over the control in the pH 5.5 medium- and pH 5.5 medium plus 1,10-PA-treated astrocytes, respectively. This was in comparison with HSP 90 immunoreactivity, which showed a 1.2- and 1.4-fold increase over the control value, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addition to acidosis, activation and binding of HSF-1 to the heat shock element without subsequent transcription of HSP 70 mRNA was described under another condition by exposing HeLa cells to sodium salicylate(10.Jurivich D.A. Sistonen L. Kroes R.A. Morimoto R.I. Science. 1992; 255: 1243-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that HSP 68 induction was not specific for the condition of acidosis plus 1,10-PA, cultured astrocytes were exposed to pH 6.8 medium and 20 or 30 mM sodium salicylate as described previously(10.Jurivich D.A. Sistonen L. Kroes R.A. Morimoto R.I. Science. 1992; 255: 1243-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). A mildly acidotic medium, pH 6.8, was used to facilitate the entry of salicylate into astrocytes (10.Jurivich D.A. Sistonen L. Kroes R.A. Morimoto R.I. Science. 1992; 255: 1243-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The synthesis of HSP 68 protein by the addition of 1,10-PA to both 20 mM and 30 mM sodium salicylate-exposed cells was readily apparent (Fig. 3) and confirmed by western immunoblotting of the same samples (Fig. 4). This experiment was repeated with nearly identical results. Detectable induction of HSP 68 was noted in 30 mM sodium salicylate-treated cells by autoradiography, suggesting that high concentrations of salicylate are toxic (Fig. 4). However, even in that condition added 1,10-PA resulted in increased induction of HSP 68. No induction of HSP 68 was noted by 1,10-PA alone or control medium, pH 6.8. Northern blot analysis of 30 mM salicylate and 1,10-PA-treated astrocytes showed a marked transient induction of HSP 68 mRNA after exposure of cells to 30 mM salicylate plus 1,10-PA (Fig. 5). No HSP 68 mRNA was noted in astrocytes exposed to 1,10-PA. Astrocytes exposed only to 30 mM salicylate showed a small induction of HSP 68 mRNA. Fig. 5 shows that 1,10-PA can enhance accumulation of HSP 68 mRNA in salicylate treated cultures and thus appears similar to the induction by acidosis and 1,10-PA.Figure 4:Western blot analysis of the same samples in A probed for HSP 68 using monoclonal antibody C-92. Each lane represents 20 μg of total astrocyte protein. Densitometry results showed a 4.5 (20 mM S plus PA) and 6.4 (30 mM S plus PA) -fold increase of HSP 68 when compared with their respective controls without added PA. HSP 68 in heat shock astrocytes was increased 7.6-fold over the control HSP 68 level.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5:Northern blot of HSP 68 mRNA induction in astrocytes treated with 30 mM salicylate and 100 μM 1,10-phenanthroline. Astrocytes incubated in 30 mM salicylate in pH 6.8 medium for 15 min with and without 1,10-PA for one additional hour. Cells were then switched to DMEM/F-12 medium, pH 7.4, until harvested for RNA extraction. Cultures treated with salicylate and 1,10-PA were harvested 1 (lane 8), 3 (lane 9), and 6 h (lane 10) after switching to DMEM/F-12 medium, pH 7.4. Control cultures treated with 1,10-PA alone in pH 6.8 medium for 75 min were harvested 1 (lane 2), 3 (lane 3), and 6 h (lane 4) after switching to DMEM/F-12 medium, pH 7.4. Astrocytes treated with 30 mM salicylate alone in pH 6.8 medium for 75 min were harvested 1 (lane 5), 3 (lane 6), and 6 h (lane 7) after switching to DMEM/F-12 medium, pH 7.4. An artifact is noted in lane 4. Control astrocytes incubated in DMEM/F-12, pH 7.4, for 4 h (lane 1) and heat shock astrocytes (HS), at 45°C for 10 min and harvested 3 h later, were other controls. Heat shock RNA (2 μg) was compared with 5 μg of RNA from each experimental sample.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) After heat shock, HSF-1 becomes phosphorylated and migrates at a higher molecular mass than unphosphorylated HSF-1(20.Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). To determine if 1,10-PA induced changes in the molecular mass of HSF-1, astrocyte cultures were treated with feeding medium, pH 6.0, and salicylate with and without the addition of 1,10-PA. A Western blot was performed on total cellular proteins from treated cultures and probed with HSF-1 antibody (Fig. 6). HSF-1 immunostaining showed similar molecular mass in the control and 100 and 200 μM 1,10-PA-treated cultures. Acidosis, salicylate, and the addition of 1,10-PA in both conditions resulted in HSF-1 shifts to higher molecular mass similar to the positive heat shock control. The Western blot also revealed higher molecular mass band(s) at approximately 150-175 kDa in the heat shock-, acidosis-, and salicylate-treated cultures but not in the control (lane 1) or the 1,10-PA-treated cultures (lanes 3 and 10). These may represent an oligomeric form (dimer) of HSF-1. It appears that the activated state of HSF-1 is that represented by a higher molecular mass because of the association of this state with HSP 68 synthesis and the 1,10-PA-treated cultures under conditions of acidosis and salicylate exposure. The evidence presented in this paper indicates that the synthesis of HSP 68 and possibly HSP 90 can be manipulated pharmacologically after the activation of HSF-1. Acidosis and salicylate have been shown to activate and promote binding of HSF-1 to the HSE(8.Mosser D.D. Kotzbauer P.T. Sarge K.D. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3748-3752Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 9.Larson J.S. Schuetz T.J. Kingston R.E. Nature. 1988; 335: 372-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 10.Jurivich D.A. Sistonen L. Kroes R.A. Morimoto R.I. Science. 1992; 255: 1243-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In the present study the addition of 1,10-PA under those conditions induced or increased the synthesis of HSP 68 mRNA and protein. The pattern of HSP 68 mRNA induction is very similar to that found after heat shock in cultured astrocytes(17.Nishimura R.N. Dwyer B.E. Clegg K. Cole R. de Vellis J. Mol. Brain Res. 1991; 9: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The transient induction of HSP 68 mRNA by 1,10-PA mimics heat shock in the induction of HSP 68 protein. The present study also shows that the mechanism of this induction is unlikely to be secondary to the iron-chelating properties of 1,10-PA since deferoxamine does not induce HSP 68 synthesis. The known intercalation of 1,10-PA with DNA (12.Veal J.M. Rill R.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1132-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and specifically with the promoter region of the HSP 68 gene under the conditions of acidosis and salicylate exposure is a possible mechanism of induction of HSP 68 mRNA. Heat shock results in a shift of HSF-1 to a phosphorylated higher molecular mass(20.Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). 1,10-PA-treated astrocytes did not show a change in the mobility of HSF-1 by electrophoresis, which is consistent with the absence of induction of HSP 68 mRNA. However, acidosis and salicylate induce a shift in the molecular mass of HSF-1 very similar to that induced by heat shock. Since this shift in the molecular mass of HSF-1 is also noted in the acidosis- and salicylate plus 1,10-PA-treated astrocytes, it appears unlikely that the mechanism of action of 1,10-PA is through the phosphorylation of HSF-1. It appears that the higher molecular mass form of HSF-1 is associated with the initiation of transcription. 1,10-PA induction of HSP 68 mRNA is probably involved in steps after HSF-1 interacts with the HSE. Recent evidence points to activator and suppressor domains in the heat shock promoter(21.Green M. Newton E. Kingston R.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 19B: 189Google Scholar, 22.Voellmy B. Zuo J. Xia W. Rungger D. Baler R. Dahl G. Zou J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 19B: 189Google Scholar, 23.Wu C. Fritsch M. Hosokawa N. Jedlicka P. Kim S-J. Orosz A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 19B: 190Google Scholar, 24.Morimoto R.I. Chen J. Jurivich D. Kline M. Kroeger P. Lee B. Satyal S. Shi Y. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 19B: 192Google Scholar). How the activator domains become activated during heat shock is not known, but it is possible that 1,10-phenanthroline may work by modulating these areas. Our findings are significant since it appears that HSP 68 synthesis can be manipulated pharmacologically. HSP 68 is essential for thermotolerance in cells and may also be important in ischemic tolerance in the nervous system(25.Nakata N. Kato H. Kogure K. NeuroReport. 1993; 4: 695-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A pharmacological agent that would allow the controlled synthesis of HSP 68 might be helpful in preventing damage from ischemia or trauma in all organ systems. HSP 68 accumulation in the absence of heat shock will promote understanding of the role of HSP 68 in cell survival without the confounding nonspecific effects of heat stress. It will also contribute to therapeutic strategies designed to elevate intracellular HSP 68 to promote cell survival. We acknowledge the technical help of R. Cole in the laboratory of J. de Vellis, I.

The p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase binds to phosphotyrosine residues of various phosphoproteins including the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor, the insulin receptor, and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). Using NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing the human insulin receptor, we demonstrate that the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase binds to phosphorylated PDGF receptor in cells incubated in the absence of insulin. When insulin is added, p85 is released from phosphorylated PDGF receptors and binds to phosphorylated insulin receptors and insulin receptor substrate-1. Moreover, insulin-induced dissociation of PDGF receptors from binding sites on PI 3-kinase requires a functional insulin receptor and is not prevented by vanadate treatment. In contrast, insulin activation does not displace PDGF receptors from binding sites on Ras GTPase-activating protein. This competition for binding to PI 3-kinase provides a mechanism for cross-talk among signaling pathways initiated by distinct peptide hormones and growth factors such as insulin and PDGF.
