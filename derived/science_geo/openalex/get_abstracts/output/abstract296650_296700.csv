https://openalex.org/W2004119567,"The changes in relative efficacy of two incompatible behaviors was investigated during growth of the lobster, Homarus americanus. In larval and early juvenile stages, physiological and morphological factors favor use of the escape response over defensive behavior. In large animals, defensive behavior is preferred almost exclusively to escape behavior unless the claws are lost. The interaction of escape and defensive behavior is modified by neural and morphological factors, which are dependent on the stage in the life cycle of the organism."

They descend faster than would maple samaras of the same size and weight and much faster than would zanonia samaras, but they are very stable, which may explain their evolutionary success."
https://openalex.org/W1967842326,"Small Bombus ternarius workers for age most frequently on the distal parts of goldenrod flower clusters when large B. terricola workers are present. This shift results from B. ternarius avoiding B. terricola. In this way B. ternarius can exploit, without conflict, resources whose availability changes constantly because of fluctuating numbers of larger consumers."
https://openalex.org/W2018739111,Two recent precision experiments provide conclusive evidence against any local hidden variables theory and in favor of standard quantum mechanics. Therefore the epistemology and the ontology of quantum mechanics must now be taken more seriously than ever before. The consequences of the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics are summarized in nontechnical language. The implications of the finiteness of Planck's constant (h > 0) for the quantum world are as strange as the implications of the finiteness of the speed of light (c < infinity for space and time in relativity theory. Both lead to realities beyond our common experience that cannot be rejected.

https://openalex.org/W2022254544,"Males of Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, an intestinal parasite of rodents, were maintained in an environment permeated with pheromone produced by females of the species. After the males were removed from that environment, their subsequent ability to orient to a gradient of the pheromone emanating from living females was greatly reduced for periods up to 2 hours. This phenomenon might serve as the basis for a new, selective antihelminthic technique in which the premating communication between males and females is disrupted."
