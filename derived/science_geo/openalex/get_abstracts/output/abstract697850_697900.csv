We discovered that the disease-associated gain-of-function allele Lrrk2G2019S (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2) perturbs mitochondrial homeostasis and reprograms cell death pathways in macrophages. When the inflammasome is activated in Lrrk2G2019S macrophages, elevated mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) directs association of the pore-forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD) to mitochondrial membranes. Mitochondrial GSDMD pore formation then releases mtROS, promoting a switch to RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL-dependent necroptosis. Consistent with enhanced necroptosis, infection of Lrrk2G2019S mice with Mycobacterium tuberculosis elicits hyperinflammation and severe immunopathology. Our findings suggest a pivotal role for GSDMD as an executer of multiple cell death pathways and demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction can direct immune outcomes via cell death modality switching. This work provides insights into how LRRK2 mutations manifest or exacerbate human diseases and identifies GSDMD-dependent necroptosis as a potential target to limit Lrrk2G2019S-mediated immunopathology.

https://openalex.org/W4288740296,"Upon stress, eukaryotes typically reprogram their translatome through GCN2-mediated phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor, eIF2α, to inhibit general translation initiation while selectively translating essential stress regulators. Unexpectedly, in plants, pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) and response to other environmental stresses occur independently of the GCN2/eIF2α pathway. Here, we show that while PTI induces mRNA decapping to inhibit general translation, defense mRNAs with a purine-rich element (“R-motif”) are selectively translated using R-motif as an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). R-motif-dependent translation is executed by poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) through preferential association with the PTI-activating eIFiso4G over the repressive eIF4G. Phosphorylation by PTI regulators mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 and 6 (MPK3/6) inhibits eIF4G’s activity while enhancing PABP binding to the R-motif and promoting eIFiso4G-mediated defense mRNA translation, establishing a link between PTI signaling and protein synthesis. Given its prevalence in both plants and animals, the PABP/R-motif translation initiation module may have a broader role in reprogramming the stress translatome."

However, separating cause and effect in such embryonic failure is challenging. To isolate cell-autonomous effects of TET loss, we used temporal single-cell atlases from embryos with partial or complete mutant contributions. Strikingly, when developing within a wild-type embryo, Tet-mutant cells retain near-complete differentiation potential, whereas embryos solely comprising mutant cells are defective in epiblast to ectoderm transition with degenerated mesoderm potential. We map de-repressions of early epiblast factors (e.g., Dppa4 and Gdf3) and failure to activate multiple signaling from nascent mesoderm (Lefty, FGF, and Notch) as likely cell-intrinsic drivers of TET loss phenotypes. We further suggest loss of enhancer demethylation as the underlying mechanism. Collectively, our work demonstrates an unbiased approach for defining intrinsic and extrinsic embryonic gene function based on temporal differentiation atlases and disentangles the intracellular effects of the demethylation machinery from its broader tissue-level ramifications."
https://openalex.org/W4288692015,"There is evidence of negative impact of social distancing and confinement measures to manage the COVID-19 pandemic on children, including increased anxiety and depression and behaviour difficulties. Paradoxically, positive impacts like increased support and more self-care activities have also been documented. Little is known about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the children with disability and the potential role of familial, environmental, and biological factors on mitigating this impact. The aims of the study were 1) identifying profiles of functioning across multiple domains during the COVID-19 pandemic and 2) examining the extent to which parenting self-efficacy, support in accessing schooling, and type of diagnosis predict the likelihood of resilience among children with disability, after controlling for household income and single-parent status. An online survey developed from COVID-19 guidance recommendations, was available from June 11- July 21, 2020, and resulted in a convenience sample of caregivers across Canada ( n = 883) of children with disability (mean age of 9.4 years old, SD age = 5.7, 58% male). We conducted latent class analysis to examine the number of latent profiles on caregiver-reported changes of 12 functioning domains, as either ‘worsening’, ‘no change’, or ‘improving’. Most participants belonged to ‘stable’ or ‘worsening’ profiles. However, we identified a small subgroup with improvements in child functioning, a pattern indicative of a ‘resilient’ profile. Using a multinomial logistic regression, we found that diagnosis type, parenting self-efficacy and support in accessing schooling were associated with membership in the Resilient or Stable profiles compared to the Worsening profile, after controlling for single-parent status and income. Taken together, our findings identified variability in responses to adversity that is dependent on the child’s diagnosis type, parenting self-efficacy, and support in accessing schooling. By identifying potentially modifiable predictors of resilience, namely parenting self-efficacy and support in accessing schooling, we signal the potential for tailored supports for different diagnoses, through interventions that enhance caregiver empowerment, access to schooling, access to health and social services, and/or mitigate disparities resulting from social disadvantage."

Here, we studied the HPV genotype distribution of HPV positive Latin American (LA) women by histological grade, in a sub-cohort from the ESTAMPA study; we also explored the association of age-specific HPV genotypes in severe lesions. Cervical samples from 1,252 participants (854 ≤CIN1, 121 CIN2, 194 CIN3 and 83 CC) were genotyped by two PCRs-Reverse Blotting Hybridization strategies: i) Broad-Spectrum General Primers 5+/6+ and ii) PGMY9/11 PCRs. HPV16 was the most frequently found genotype in all histological grades, and increased with the severity of lesions from 14.5% in ≤ CIN1, 19.8% in CIN2, 51.5% in CIN3 to 65.1% in CC (p < 0.001). For the remaining HR-HPVs their frequency in CC did not increase when compared to less severe categories. The nonavalent vaccine HR-types ranked at the top in CC, the dominant ones being HPV16 and HPV45. HR-HPV single infection occurs, respectively, in 57.1% and 57.0% of ≤CIN1 and CIN2, increasing to 72.2% and 91.6% in CIN3 and CC (p<0.001). No association between age and HPV type was observed in CC, although the risk of HPV16 infection in CIN3 cases increased with age. Results confirm the relevance of HPV16 in the whole clinical spectrum, with a strong rise of its proportion in CIN3 and cancer. This information will be relevant in evaluating the impact of HPV vaccination, as a baseline against which to compare genotype changes in HPV type-specific distribution as vaccinated women participate in screening in LA region. Likewise, these data may help select the best HPV testing system for HPV-based efficient, affordable, and sustainable screening programmes."
https://openalex.org/W4288696142,"Objectives To evaluate the prognostic value of fully automatic lung quantification based on spectral computed tomography (CT) and laboratory parameters for combined outcome prediction in COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods CT images of 53 hospitalized COVID-19 patients including virtual monochromatic reconstructions at 40-140keV were analyzed using a fully automated software system. Quantitative CT (QCT) parameters including mean and percentiles of lung density, fibrosis index (FIBI -700 , defined as the percentage of segmented lung voxels ≥-700 HU), quantification of ground-glass opacities and well-aerated lung areas were analyzed. QCT parameters were correlated to laboratory and patient outcome parameters (hospitalization, days on intensive care unit, invasive and non-invasive ventilation). Results Best correlations were found for laboratory parameters LDH (r = 0.54), CRP (r = 0.49), Procalcitonin (r = 0.37) and partial pressure of oxygen (r = 0.35) with the QCT parameter 75 th percentile of lung density. LDH, Procalcitonin, 75 th percentile of lung density and FIBI- 700 were the strongest independent predictors of patients’ outcome in terms of days of invasive ventilation. The combination of LDH and Procalcitonin with either 75 th percentile of lung density or FIBI -700 achieved a r 2 of 0.84 and 1.0 as well as an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.99 and 1.0 for the prediction of the need of invasive ventilation. Conclusions QCT parameters in combination with laboratory parameters could deliver a feasible prognostic tool for the prediction of invasive ventilation in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia."
https://openalex.org/W4288535556,"Altered expression of Urea Cycle (UC) enzymes occurs in many tumors, resulting a metabolic hallmark termed as UC dysregulation. Polyamines are synthesized from ornithine, and polyamine synthetic genes are elevated in various tumors. However, the underlying deregulations of UC/ polyamine synthesis in cancer remain elusive. Here, we characterized a hypoxia-induced lncRNA LVBU (lncRNA regulation via BCL6/urea cycle) that is highly expressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) and correlates with poor cancer prognosis. Increased LVBU expression promoted CRC cells proliferation, foci formation and tumorigenesis. Further, LVBU regulates urea cycle and polyamine synthesis through BCL6, a negative regulator of p53. Mechanistically, overexpression of LVBU competitively bound miR-10a/miR-34c to protect BCL6 from miR-10a/34c-mediated degradation, which in turn allows BCL6 to block p53-mediated suppression of genes (arginase1 ARG1, ornithine transcarbamylase OTC, ornithine decarboxylase 1 ODC1) involved in UC/polyamine synthesis. Significantly, ODC1 inhibitor attenuated the growth of patient derived xenografts (PDX) that sustain high LVBU levels. Taken together, elevated LVBU can regulate BCL6-p53 signaling axis for systemic UC/polyamine synthesis reprogramming and confers a predilection toward CRC development. Our data demonstrates that further drug development and clinical evaluation of inhibiting UC/polyamine synthesis are warranted for CRC patients with high expression of LVBU."
https://openalex.org/W4288698336,"This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between the Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) and the incidence of surgery-related acute kidney injury (AKI) in non-cardiac surgery patients under general anaesthesia.In this retrospective study, 5057 patients from Third Xiangya hospital from January 2012 to December 2016 and 1686 patients from Second Xiangya hospital from January 2016 to December 2016 for non-cardiac surgery under general anesthesia were included. According to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve constructed by NLR for postoperative AKI, the cut-off point was obtained as the basis for grouping low or high NLR. The baseline characteristics of two sets were compared with each other. A multi-factor model was constructed by Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method with the training set, and verified by outside validation set.243 patients (3.604%) developed postoperative AKI. The ROC curve showed that the AUC of the NLR for predicting postoperative AKI in non-cardiac surgery was 0.743 (95% CI, 0.717-0.769), and the cut-off value was 3.555 (sensitivity, 86.4%; specificity 51.9%). There was no significant difference in the baseline characteristics of training set and validation set. The AUC in the training set was 0.817 (95% CI, 0.784-0.850), and the AUC in the validation set was 0.804 (95% CI, 0.749-0.858), the AUC deviation was 0.012 (P > 0.05) from validation set, and the likelihood ratio test showed P < 0.05.This study showed that preoperative high NLR (NLR≥3.555) was an independent risk factor associated with postoperative AKI (OR, 2.410; 95% CI, 1.371-4.335) in patients for non-cardiac surgery under general anesthesia."
https://openalex.org/W4288701281,"Poverty is multifaceted. The global poverty profile shows 41% of multidimensionally poor people living in South Asian countries. Though castes and tribes are a more prevalent line of social stratification in India, and their socio-economic characteristics also vary remarkably, hardly any study has explored these dimensions while analysing multidimensional poverty in India. Hence, this study attempts to assess the multidimensional status of poverty among the social groups in India. National Family Health Survey, 2015–16 (NFHS-4) is a source of rich information on 579,698 households’ well-being for this analysis. Alkire- Foster technique was applied to decompose the Multidimensional Poverty Index (M 0 ) across its dimensions and indicators for all the social groups. Three broad dimensions of deprivation–Health, Education and Standard of Living–include 12 indicators, guided by the poverty literature, data availability and the country’s sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). There were three main findings in this study: (1) Scheduled Tribes (STs) are the most disadvantaged subgroup in India with remarkably high values of headcount (H = 0.444;), intensity (A = 0.486), and M 0 (0.216), followed by Scheduled Castes (SCs) (H = 0.292; A = 0.473; M 0 = 0.138), and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) (H = 0.245; A = 0.465; M 0 = 0.114); and Others category is the most privileged with very low values of H = 0.149, A = 0.463, and M 0 = 0.069; (2) STs contribute nearly twice their population share for both H and M 0 , and the SCs contribution is also noticeably higher than their population share; (3) States located in the central and eastern regions of India have the higher H, A and M 0 for all the social groups. This suggests that there is a need for a thorough assessment of poverty at specific levels to uncover the poverty situation in society, improve the effectiveness of evidence-based planning and effective policymaking."
https://openalex.org/W4289261027,"Cholestasis is a common complication of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, characterized by increased intrahepatic and plasma bile acid levels. Cholestasis was found negatively associated with hepatitis outcome, however, the exact mechanism by which cholestasis impacts anti-viral immunity and impedes HBV clearance remains elusive. Here, we found that cholestatic mice are featured with dysfunctional T cells response, as indicated by decreased sub-population of CD25+/CD69+ CD4+ and CD8+ cells, while CTLA-4+ CD4+ and CD8+ subsets were increased. Mechanistically, bile acids disrupt intracellular calcium homeostasis via inhibiting mitochondria calcium uptake and elevating cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration, leading to STIM1 and ORAI1 decoupling and impaired store-operated Ca2+ entry which is essential for NFAT signaling and T cells activation. Moreover, in a transgenic mouse model of HBV infection, we confirmed that cholestasis compromised both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells activation resulting in poor viral clearance. Collectively, our results suggest that bile acids play pivotal roles in anti-HBV infection via controlling T cells activation and metabolism and that targeting the regulation of bile acids may be a therapeutic strategy for host-virus defense."

Methods The HLQ items were translated and culturally adapted to the Korean context. The convenience sampling method was used, and data were collected. The difficulty level, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using diagonal weighted least squares (DWLS) estimator in R, discriminant validity, and composite reliability were performed. Results The easiest scale to obtain a high score was “Scale 4. Social support for health” and the hardest was “Scale 7. Navigating the healthcare system.” Nine one-factor models fitted well. The nine-factor structural equation model fitted the data well. All HLQ scales were homogenous, with composite reliability. Conclusions The Korean version of the HLQ has a strong construct and high composite reliability when applied to Korean adults."

https://openalex.org/W4288710626,"Among all racial groups in the U.S., African Americans (AA) have the highest incidence of and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC). Although socioeconomic factors, as the major contributors to racial disparity of CRC, have been widely investigated, there is a dearth of information germane to understanding its biological basis. To better elucidate the clinicopathologic features we extracted demographic, clinical, pathologic and molecular features of 500 consecutive cases of CRC diagnosed at our institution which has an AA-predominant patient population (75% of all patients). We compared data from our AA patients with those of white patients both from our institution and from SEER and the published literature for meaningful comparison. AA patients were more likely to be at an advanced disease stage (25.9% vs. 20.8%, p = 0.041), have low grade tumors (89.2% vs. 77.5%, p<0.001) in cecum (18.7% vs. 16.2%, p<0.001) and <60-years-old than white patients (31.8% vs. 26.3%, p = 0.015). The frequency of KRAS mutation was higher in AA patients than in white patients (56.8% vs. 20.7%, p<0.001). Amongst subtypes of KRAS tested in CRC, codon 12 mutation is more common in AA than white patients (85.2% vs. 68.9%, p = 0.020). Compared with other racial groups, we found AA patients to have worse disease-free survival (HR = 3.682, p = 0.035). Also, AA patients with CRC in distal (sigmoid and rectum) or proximal (cecum) colon have worse overall survival than those with CRC in middle colon (HR = 2.926, p = 0.014), a finding not observed in white patients. In both racial groups, advanced stage, perforation, and hypertension were independent prognostic factors for overall survival (p<0.05). Similarly, low body-mass index at presentation, mucinous adenocarcinoma, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion and KRAS mutations were independent factors significantly associated with poor disease-free survival. Collectively, our data provide new insights into the roles of clinicopathologic features, especially anatomic distribution, in predicting outcomes of CRC in AA population."
https://openalex.org/W4289262340,"Mutations in TRPC6 are a cause of autosomal dominant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in humans. Many of these mutations are known to have a gain-of-function effect on the non-specific cation channel function of TRPC6. In vitro studies have suggested these mutations affect several signaling pathways, but in vivo studies have largely compared wild-type and Trpc6 -deficient rodents. We developed mice carrying a gain-of-function Trpc6 mutation encoding an E896K amino acid change, corresponding to a known FSGS mutation in TRPC6 . Homozygous mutant Trpc6 animals have no appreciable renal pathology, and do not develop albuminuria until very advanced age. The Trpc6 E896K mutation does not impart susceptibility to PAN nephrosis. The animals show a slight delay in recovery from the albumin overload model. In response to chronic angiotensin II infusion, Trpc6 E896K/E896K mice have slightly greater albuminuria initially compared to wild-type animals, an effect that is lost at later time points, and a statistically non-significant trend toward more glomerular injury. This phenotype is nearly opposite to that of Trpc6 -deficient animals previously described. The Trpc6 mutation does not appreciably impact renal interstitial fibrosis in response to either angiotensin II infusion, or folate-induced kidney injury. TRPC6 protein and TRPC6-agonist induced calcium influx could not be detected in glomeruli. In sum, these findings suggest that a gain-of-function Trpc6 mutation confers only a mild susceptibility to glomerular injury in the mouse."
https://openalex.org/W4288697558,"International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 's adoption increased attention to International Accounting Standard Regulations worldwide. It has opened the door for empirical analysis having different perceptions of mandatory IFRS adoption. This paper's main objective is to examine the impact of accounting quality and IFRS adoption on Pakistan's banking sector efficiency. We have employed the Malmquist productivity index, Roychowdhury's Earnings Management, and modified learner index to conduct the empirical analysis. The results mean how much banking sector efficiency is affected by accounting quality and IFRS adoption. The results demonstrate that the banking sector efficiency significantly increases through accounting quality and IFRS. Furthermore, it can be seen that the foreign banks' efficiency in Pakistan is less than other banks compared to public or private banks. Additionally, more earnings timeliness has been noted in large banks than medium and small banks in Pakistan. Preferably, the practice of quality accounting relies on disclosed information through financial statements. In contrast, the organizations may evade the losses once the information quality is precise and appropriate. The study provides valuable information to managers and other stakeholders."

It is however unclear when and how depressive symptoms develop and progress in the course of PD development.To assess how depressive symptoms evolve in PD, using repeated measures.In 2994 older adults, ages 70-79 years, depressive symptoms were assessed 8 times over 11 years using the 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD-10). For each PD patient at each time point, we calculated the difference between CESD-10 score and its expected value estimated based on data from individuals without PD, and then realigned the time scale in reference to the year of PD diagnosis. We examined longitudinal changes in CESD-10 scores before and after PD diagnosis using a joint modeling approach to account for competing risks of non-participation and death.A total of 79 PD patients were identified at enrollment or during the follow-up, with repeatedly assessed depressive symptom data up to 9 years before and after PD diagnosis. We found a monotonic trend of increasing CESD-10 score in PD patients throughout the observational period (p = 0.002). The observed scores became higher than expected approximately 7 years before PD diagnosis and significantly different 1 year before PD diagnosis.Increasing depressive symptomatology appears to precede PD diagnosis by a few years."

We used an ordinal logistic regression with a backward selection method to identify factors that affected vaccination intention.Several factors could increase individuals' vaccination intentions including: being male, older, with an openness personality, having a better quality of life in the physical health domain, having better knowledge and personal health behavior, having more trust in the government, and being worried about misinformation. Perceived risks played a crucial role in the vaccine decision-making process. When the pandemic intensified, people's vaccination intentions increased significantly.The findings of the present study could highlight individuals' vaccination attitudes and provide governments with an empirical and dynamic base to design tailored strategies to increase vaccination rates."
https://openalex.org/W4288695366,"In this work, an innovative multi-strain SV EAIR epidemic model is developed for the study of the spread of a multi-strain infectious disease in a population infected by mutations of the disease. The population is assumed to be completely susceptible to n different variants of the disease, and those who are vaccinated and recovered from a specific strain k (k ≤ n) are immune to previous and present strains j = 1, 2, ⋯, k, but can still be infected by newer emerging strains j = k + 1, k + 2, ⋯, n. The model is designed to simulate the emergence and dissemination of viral strains. All the equilibrium points of the system are calculated and the conditions for existence and global stability of these points are investigated and used to answer the question as to whether it is possible for the population to have an endemic with more than one strain. An interesting result that shows that a strain with a reproduction number greater than one can still die out on the long run if a newer emerging strain has a greater reproduction number is verified numerically. The effect of vaccines on the population is also analyzed and a bound for the herd immunity threshold is calculated. The validity of the work done is verified through numerical simulations by applying the proposed model and strategy to analyze the multi-strains of the COVID-19 virus, in particular, the Delta and the Omicron variants, in the United State."
https://openalex.org/W4288702524,"The timely reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) could improve pharmacovigilance (PV) in a healthcare system. However, in almost all healthcare systems barriers exist that lead to the underreporting of ADRs. The objective of this study was to identify the barriers and facilitators regarding PV activities from the point of view of healthcare professionals (HCPs) in Lahore, Pakistan. A cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey was conducted between September 2018 to January 2019. The data was collected through convenience sampling of physicians, pharmacists, and nurses at tertiary care public hospitals in Lahore. A total of 384 questionnaires were distributed, and 346 HCPs responded to the survey. Over 62% percent of physicians and 54.8% of nurses agreed that they did not know how to report an ADR in their workplace. About 43.2% of pharmacists and 40.1% of nurses disagreed that they were not aware of the need for ADR reporting. Furthermore, 41.6% of nurses identified a lack of financial reimbursement and 51.8% highlighted a lack of support from a colleague as a reason that could lead to the underreporting of ADR. The majority of participants, including 69.6% physicians, 48.6% pharmacists, and 55.3% nurses identified the lack of knowledge about the existence of a national PV centre. Extra time for ADR reporting, incentives, continuous medical education, reminders, and availability of an online ADR reporting system was classed as the facilitators and were agreed upon by the majority of HCPs."
https://openalex.org/W4288704554,"China is a large country with rapid economic expansion and high energy consumption, which implies that the country’s overall carbon emissions are enormous. It is vital to increase urban low-carbon economy efficiency (ULEE) to achieve sustainable development of China’s urban economy. Digital finance is a significant tool to boost ULEE by providing a convenient and effective funding channel for urban low-carbon economic transformation. Analyzing the coupled and coordinated relationship between ULEE and digital finance is of vital importance for the sustainable development of the urban economy. This paper selects panel data of 100 cities in China’s Yangtze River Economic Belt (YEB) in 2011-2019, and analyzes the research methods such as the Global Malmquist-Luenberger index model, coupling coordination degree (CCD) model, standard deviation ellipse model, gray model, and geographic detector by The spatial and temporal distribution, dynamic evolution characteristics and influencing factors of the CCD between ULEE and digital finance are analyzed. The study shows that: (1) the CCD of ULEE and digital finance grows by 3.42% annually, reflecting the increasingly coordinated development of the two systems; (2) The CCD of ULEE and digital finance shows a distribution pattern of gradient increase from the upstream region of Yangtze River to the downstream region, meanwhile, the spatial center of gravity moves mainly in the midstream region; (3) The spatial center of gravity of CCD of ULEE and digital finance is expected to move 22.17 km to the southwest from 2019 to 2040; (4) In terms of influencing factors, the influence of informatization and industrial structure on the CCD increases over time, while the influence of factors such as population development, greening, transportation, and scientific research decreases over time. Finally, this paper proposes policy recommendations for improving the CCD of ULEE and digital finance based on the empirical results."
https://openalex.org/W4288709966,"Neutron contamination as a source of out-of-field dose in radiotherapy is still of concern. High-energy treatment photons have the potential to overcome the binding energy of neutrons inside the nuclei. Fast neutrons emitting from the accelerator head can directly reach the patient’s bed. Considering that modern radiotherapy techniques can increase patient survival, concerns about unwanted doses and the lifetime risk of fatal cancer remain strong or even more prominent, especially in young adult patients. The current study addressed these concerns by quantifying the dose and risk of fatal cancer due to photo-neutrons for glioma patients undergoing 18-MV radiotherapy. In this study, an NRD model rem-meter detector was used to measure neutron ambient dose equivalent, H*(10), at the patient table. Then, the neutron equivalent dose received by each organ was estimated concerning the depth of each organ and by applying depth dose corrections to the measured H*(10). Finally, the effective dose and risk of secondary cancer were determined using NCRP 116 coefficients. Evidence revealed that among all organs, the breast (0.62 mSv/Gy) and gonads (0.58 mSv/Gy) are at risk of photoneutrons more than the other organs in such treatments. The neutron effective dose in the 18-MV conventional radiotherapy of the brain was 13.36 mSv. Among all organs, gonads (6.96 mSv), thyroid (1.86 mSv), and breasts (1.86 mSv) had more contribution to the effective dose, respectively. The total secondary cancer risk was estimated as 281.4 cases (per 1 million persons). The highest risk was related to the breast and gonads with 74.4 and, 34.8 cases per 1 million persons, respectively. Therefore, it is recommended that to prevent late complications (secondary cancer and genetic effects), these organs should be shielded from photoneutrons. This procedure not only improves the quality of the patient’s personal life but also the healthy childbearing in the community."
https://openalex.org/W4288714480,"Previous studies have reported correlates of bodily self-illusions such as the rubber hand in signatures of rhythmic brain activity. However, individual studies focused on specific variations of the rubber hand paradigm, used different experimental setups to induce this, or used different control conditions to isolate the neurophysiological signatures related to the illusory state, leaving the specificity of the reported illusion-signatures unclear. We here quantified correlates of the rubber hand illusion in EEG-derived oscillatory brain activity and asked two questions: which of the observed correlates are robust to the precise nature of the control conditions used as contrast for the illusory state, and whether such correlates emerge directly around the subjective illusion onset. To address these questions, we relied on two experimental configurations to induce the illusion, on different non-illusion conditions to isolate neurophysiological signatures of the illusory state, and we implemented an analysis directly focusing on the immediate moment of the illusion onset. Our results reveal a widespread suppression of alpha and beta-band activity associated with the illusory state in general, whereby the reduction of beta power prevailed around the immediate illusion onset. These results confirm previous reports of a suppression of alpha and beta rhythms during body illusions, but also highlight the difficulties to directly pinpoint the precise neurophysiological correlates of the illusory state."
https://openalex.org/W4289261747,"While most productivity on the surface of the Earth today is fueled by oxygenic photosynthesis, for much of Earth history it is thought that anoxygenic photosynthesis—using compounds like ferrous iron or sulfide as electron donors—drove most global carbon fixation. Anoxygenic photosynthesis is still performed by diverse bacteria in niche environments today. Of these, the Chlorobi (formerly green sulfur bacteria) are often interpreted as being particularly ancient and are frequently proposed to have fueled the biosphere during late Archean and early Paleoproterozoic time before the rise of oxygenic photosynthesis. Here, we perform comparative genomic, phylogenetic, and molecular clock analyses to determine the antiquity of the Chlorobi and their characteristic phenotypes. We show that contrary to common assumptions, the Chlorobi clade is relatively young, with anoxygenic phototrophy, carbon fixation via the rTCA pathway, and iron oxidation all significantly postdating the rise of oxygen ~2.3 billion years ago. The Chlorobi therefore could not have fueled the Archean biosphere, but instead represent a relatively young radiation of organisms which likely acquired the capacity for anoxygenic photosynthesis and other traits via horizontal gene transfer sometime after the evolution of oxygenic Cyanobacteria."

However, although sequencing of the genome of the Australian lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri) , as well as, that of the West African lungfish ( Protopterus annectens ) were reported in the first three months of 2021, we could not retrieve a GR sequence with a BLAST search of GenBank, when we submitted our research for publication in July 2021. Moreover, we were unsuccessful in cloning the GR from slender African lungfish using a cDNA from the ovary of P . dolloi and PCR primers that had successfully cloned a GR from elephant shark, Xenopus and gar GRs. On October 21, 2021 the nucleotide sequence of West African lungfish ( P . annectens ) GR was deposited in GenBank. We used this GR sequence to construct PCR primers that successfully cloned the GR from the slender spotted lungfish. Here, we report the sequences of nine P . dolloi GR isoforms and explain the basis for the previous failure to clone a GR from slender African lungfish using PCR primers that cloned the GR from elephant shark, Xenopus and gar. Studies are underway to determine corticosteroid activation of these slender African lungfish GRs."
https://openalex.org/W4289341473,"Introduction This study aimed to validate hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) treatment via a tailored nutritional pathway in myeloablative conditioning (MAC), determine its efficacy in terms of remission, and explore associations between clinical outcomes and nutritional indicators. Methods We included patients who underwent MAC for HSCT at the Shizuoka Cancer Center Stem Cell Transplantation between 2015 and 2019. We evaluated outcomes from the day before treatment initiation (transplant date: day 0) to day 42. Results Among the 40 MAC cases (participant characteristics: 20/40 males, mean age of 52 years, and mean body mass index of 21.9 kg/m 2 ), we found that the percent loss of body weight and loss of skeletal muscle mass were correlated with the basal energy expenditure rate (BEE rate; r = 0.70, p &lt;0.001 and r = 0.49, p &lt;0.01, respectively). Based on the receiver operating characteristics curves, the cutoff value for the BEE rate in terms of weight loss was 1.1. Salivary amylase levels did not significantly change during the treatment course. Continuous variables, including oral caloric intake and performance status, showed statistically significant correlations with nutrition-related adverse events during treatment ( r = −0.93, p &lt;0.01 and r = 0.91, p &lt;0.01, respectively). Skeletal muscle mass before treatment initiation was an independent predictive variable for reduced 2-year survival ( p = 0.04). Conclusion Our results support the validity of a safe nutritional pathway with a BEE rate of 1.1 for HSCT patients pretreated with MAC. Specifically, we found that this pathway could prevent weight loss in response to nutrition-related adverse events. Skeletal muscle mass before treatment was identified as an independent risk factor for reduced 2-year survival."
https://openalex.org/W4288687340,"Thoracic ossification of the ligamentum flavum (TOLF) is a heterotopic ossification of spinal ligaments. TOLF is the major cause of thoracic spinal canal stenosis and myelopathy, and its underlying mechanisms are not clear. Bone formation is a complex developmental process involving the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells to osteoblasts, and regulated by BMP2, RUNX2, Osterix (OSX), etc. In this study, we continue to further characterize properties of TOLF. Our immunohistochemistry experiments showed that expressions of osteoblastic factors such as BMP2 and RUNX2 increased in TOLF. According to flow cytometry analysis the proportion of S phase of cell cycle in primary TOLF cells was 9% higher than the control. Alizarin red staining and ALP staining observations were consistent with immunohistochemistry results. It was also observed that inflammatory cytokine IL-6 level dramatically increased in the culture supernatant of primary TOLF cells. We propose the hypothesis that IL-6 is involved in TOLF. To testify the hypothesis, we examined the effect of IL-6. Our results showed that IL-6 was able to activate expressions of osteoblastic factors such as BMP2, RUNX2, OSX, OCN and ALP, and that expressions of cell proliferation factors cyclin D1 and cyclin C increased in the presence of IL-6. Moreover, IL-6-induced BMP2 expression was inhibited by p38 inhibitor SB203580, indicating that IL-6 regulated the osteogenic BMP2 activation through p38 MAPK pathway. These data suggest that IL-6 is involved in TOLF."
https://openalex.org/W4288689827,"Prospect Theory, proposed and developed by Kahneman and Tversky, demonstrated that people do not make rational decisions based on expected utility, but are instead biased by specific cognitive tendencies leading to neglect, under- or over- consider information, depending on the context of presentation. In this vein, the present paper focuses on whether and how individual decision-making attitudes are prone to change in the presence of globally challenging events. We ran three partial replications of the Kahneman and Tversky (1979) paper, focusing on a set of eight prospects, after a terror attack (Paris, November 2015, 134 subjects) and during the Covid-19 pandemic, both during the first lockdown in Italy (Spring 2020, 176 subjects) and after the first reopening (140 subjects). The results confirm patterns of choice characterizing uncertain times, as shown by previous literature. In particular, we note significant increase of risk aversion, both in the gain and in the loss domains, that consistently emerged in the three replications. Given the nature of our sample, and the heterogeneity between the three periods investigated, we suggest that the phenomenon we present can be explained stress-related effects on decision making rather than by other economic effects, such as the income effect."

In the case of cardiopulmonary arrest due to myocardial infarction, the survival rate is as low as 13.3% one month after resuscitation, which birthed the need for continuous heart monitoring. In this study, we develop a Ballistocardiogram (BCG) measurement system using a load cell installed on a chair and a heart rate estimation algorithm that is robust to waveform changes, with the aim of constructing a non-contact heart rate acquisition system. The proposed system was evaluated by utilizing data obtained from 13 healthy subjects and 1 subject with abnormal ECG who were simultaneously measured with ECG. The output of the BCG system was confirmed to change with the same period as the ECG data obtained as the correct answer, and the synchronization of the R-peak positions was confirmed for all cases. As a result of comparing the heart rate intervals estimated from BCG and those obtained from ECG, it was confirmed that the same heart rate variability (HRV) features could be obtained even for abnormal ECG subject."
https://openalex.org/W4288704143,"In regional land-use planning, many different demands for often-limited land resources must be weighed against each other. Analysis of the benefits of different land-use types is of great significance in land-use design. However, a good evaluation methodology does not exist. To facilitate a comparative analysis of land-use benefits, this paper presents an evaluation system consisting of four steps: (1) Connotation dissection to determine the land-use benefits, (2) construction of a land-use benefit classification system to summarize a limited number of land-use benefit types by an inductive method, (3) land-use benefit valuation, which includes a biophysical model, direct and indirect market valuations, and The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity value conversion method, and (4) case analysis of the evaluation results according to local conditions. Empirical results from a case study of Mentougou District, Beijing, China, show that (i) the evaluation results of land-use benefit groups provides information on each land-use type and the spatial distribution of land-use benefits in Mentougou District, (ii) the topography of Mentougou District has an important influence on economic and ecological land-use benefits, and (iii) there is a synergistic effect of economic and social land-use benefits."
https://openalex.org/W4288704605,"Background The neonatal period is the most vulnerable time for survival in which children face the highest risk of dying in their lives. Neonatal mortality (NM) remains a global public concern, especially in sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. Although, better progress has been made in reducing NM before 2016, Ethiopia is currently one of the top ten countries affected by NM. Studies are limited to secondary data extraction in Ethiopia which focus only on survival status during admission, and no study has been conducted in the study area in particular. Objective To assess the survival status and predictors of neonatal mortality among neonates admitted to the NICU of WURH and Nekemte Specialized Hospital, Western Ethiopia. Methods An institution-based prospective cohort study was conducted among a cohort of 412 neonates admitted to the NICU of WURH and Nekemte Specialized Hospital from September 1, 2020 to December 30, 2020. All neonates consecutively admitted to the NICU of the two hospitals during the study period were included in the study. Data entry was performed using Epidata version 3.0 and the analysis was performed using STATA version 14. A Kaplan Meier survival curve was constructed to estimate the cumulative survival probability. A cox proportional hazards regression model was used to identify the predictors of NM. Hazard Ratios with 95% CI were computed and all the predictors associated with the outcome variable at p-value ≤ 0.05 in the multivariable cox proportional hazards analysis were declared as a significant predictor of NM. Results A total of 412 neonates were followed for a median of 27 days with an IQR of 22–28 days. During the follow-up period, a total of 9249 person day observations (PDO) were detected. At the end of follow-up, 15.3% of neonates died with an overall incidence rate of death 6.81/1000 PDO. The median time to death was 10 days, and the highest incidence rate of death was observed during the first week of the neonatal period. The study found that rural residence (AHR = 2.04, 95%CI: 1.14, 3.66), lack of ANC visits (AHR = 7.77, 95%CI: 3.99, 15.11), neonatal hypothermia (AHR = 3.04, 95%CI: 1.36, 6.80), and delayed initiation of breastfeeding (AHR = 2.26, 95% CI: 1.12, 4.56) as independent predictors of NM. However, a decreased number of pregnancies decrease the risk of NM. Conclusions and recommendations The incidence rate of neonatal death was high particularly in the first week of life in the study area. The study found that lack of ANC visit, neonatal hypothermia, increased number of pregnancies, rural residence, and delayed initiation of breastfeeding positively predicted NM. Therefore, there is a need to encourage programs that enhance ANC visits for pregnant mothers and community-based neonatal survival strategies, particularly for countryside mothers."
https://openalex.org/W4288707360,"Academic networks are expected to enhance scientific collaboration and thereby increase research outputs. However, little is known about whether and how the initial steps of getting to know other researchers translates into effective collaborations. In this paper, we investigate the evolution and co-evolution of an academic social network and a collaborative research network (using co-authorship as a proxy measure of the latter), and simultaneously examine the effect of individual researcher characteristics (e.g. gender, seniority or workplace) on their evolving relationships. We used longitudinal data from an international network in primary care cancer research: the CanTest Collaborative (CanTest). Surveys were distributed amongst CanTest researchers to map who knows who (the ‘academic social network’). Co-authorship relations were derived from Scopus (the ‘collaborative network’). Stochastic actor-oriented models were employed to investigate the evolution and co-evolution of both networks. Visualizing the development of the CanTest network revealed that researchers within CanTest get to know each other quickly and also start collaborating over time (evolution of the academic social network and collaborative network respectively). Results point to a stable and solid academic social network that is particularly encouraging towards more junior researchers; yet differing for male and female researchers (the effect of individual researcher characteristics). Moreover, although the academic social network and the research collaborations do not grow at the same pace, the benefit of creating academic social relationships to stimulate effective research collaboration is clearly demonstrated (co-evolution of both networks)."
https://openalex.org/W4288709988,"Background COVID-19 is a severe disease with a high need for intensive care treatment and a high mortality rate in hospitalized patients. The objective of this study was to describe and compare the clinical characteristics and the management of patients dying with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the acute medical and intensive care setting. Methods Descriptive analysis of dying patients enrolled in the Lean European Open Survey on SARS-CoV-2 Infected Patients (LEOSS), a non-interventional cohort study, between March 18 and November 18, 2020. Symptoms, comorbidities and management of patients, including palliative care involvement, were compared between general ward and intensive care unit (ICU) by univariate analysis. Results 580/4310 (13%) SARS-CoV-2 infected patients died. Among 580 patients 67% were treated on ICU and 33% on a general ward. The spectrum of comorbidities and symptoms was broad with more comorbidities (≥ four comorbidities: 52% versus 25%) and a higher age distribution (&gt;65 years: 98% versus 70%) in patients on the general ward. 69% of patients were in an at least complicated phase at diagnosis of the SARS-CoV-2 infection with a higher proportion of patients in a critical phase or dying the day of diagnosis treated on ICU (36% versus 11%). While most patients admitted to ICU came from home (71%), patients treated on the general ward came likewise from home and nursing home (44% respectively) and were more frequently on palliative care before admission (29% versus 7%). A palliative care team was involved in dying patients in 15%. Personal contacts were limited but more often documented in patients treated on ICU (68% versus 47%). Conclusion Patients dying with SARS-CoV-2 infection suffer from high symptom burden and often deteriorate early with a demand for ICU treatment. Therefor a demand for palliative care expertise with early involvement seems to exist."
https://openalex.org/W4288712663,"Selenoproteins contain the 21st amino acid, selenocysteine (Sec), which is incorporated at select UGA codons when a specialized hairpin sequence, the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element, is present in the 3’ UTR. Aside from the SECIS, selenoprotein mRNA 3’ UTRs are not conserved between different selenoproteins within a species. In contrast, the 3’-UTR of a given selenoprotein is often conserved across species, which supports the hypothesis that cis-acting elements in the 3’-UTR other than the SECIS exert post-transcriptional control on selenoprotein expression. In order to determine the function of one such SECIS context, we chose to focus on the plasma selenoprotein, SELENOP, which is required to maintain selenium homeostasis as a selenium transport protein that contains 10 Sec residues. It is unique in that its mRNA contains two SECIS elements in the context of a highly conserved 843-nucleotide 3’ UTR. Here we have used RNA affinity chromatography and identified PTBP1 as the major RNA binding protein that specifically interacts with the sequence between the two SECIS elements. We then used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to delete two regions surrounding the first SECIS element. We found that these sequences are involved in regulating SELENOP mRNA and protein levels, which are inversely altered as a function of selenium concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W4288713051,"Policymakers around the world are enforcing mobility restriction policies such as lockdowns, facemask requirements and social distancing to curb the spread of Covid-19. While these policies are effective in preventing the spread of virus, the economic implications are not well understood. We contribute to the literature by examining the impact of these policies on the offline retail sector. Specifically, we measure the effects of these policies on the daily number of shoppers passing by, which we refer to as ‘footfall’, along major shopping streets in Netherlands. We rely on unique proprietary Wifi data to accurately measure footfall. Our findings imply that all these policies attribute to a non-trivial reduction in footfall levels along shopping streets. While lockdowns led to a 50% reduction in footfall along major shopping streets, shopping streets faced with facemask regulations also experience a 25% drop in human traffic. A reduction in footfall translates into a substantial reduction in retail income of between 12% and 25%."
https://openalex.org/W4288714734,"Mature B-cell neoplasms are typically divided into Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas. Hodgkin Lymphoma is characterized by the neoplastic Reed-Sternberg cells, usually harbored in an inflammatory background, with a frequent clinical presentation of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Many studies link between autoimmunity and lymphomagenesis, a large proportion of these studies evidently trace the pathogenesis back to the misdirected detection of self-derived nucleic acids by Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs), especially those of the intracellular type. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between a selected SNP in TLR9 (TLR9-1237T&gt;C; rs5743836) and the risk and overall survival of HL patients in a Jordanian Arab population. A total of 374 subjects; 136 cases of Hodgkin lymphoma and 238 matched healthy controls were incorporated in this study. Genomic DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. Genotyping of the genetic polymorphisms was conducted using a sequencing protocol. The results show a statistically significant higher distribution of the rs5743836 (TLR9-1237T&gt;C) allele among the case population, with a p-value of 0.031 (&lt;0.05). This distribution proved significant when studied in the codominant (only significant in the T/C genotype, p-value = 0.030), dominant (p-value = 0.025), and overdominant (p-value = 0.035) models.

Considering that OCT1 and MATE1 transporters determine the metformin pharmacokinetics, this study aimed to investigate the influence of SLC22A1 and SLC47A1 variants on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of metformin and the glycemic response. This research used the prospective-cohort study design for 81 patients with T2DM who received 500 mg metformin twice a day from six primary healthcare centers. SLC22A1 rs628031 A>G (Met408Val) and Met420del genetic variants in OCT1 as well as SLC47A1 rs2289669 G>A genetic variant in MATE1 were examined through the PCR-RFLP method. The bioanalysis of plasma metformin was performed in the validated reversed-phase HPLC-UV detector. The metformin steady-state concentration was measured for the trough concentration (Cssmin) and peak concentration (Cssmax). The pharmacodynamic parameters of metformin use were the fasting blood glucose (FBG) and glycated albumin (GA). Only SLC22A1 Met420del alongside estimated-glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) affected both Cssmax and Cssmin with an extremely weak correlation. Meanwhile, SLC47A1 rs2289669 and FBG were correlated. This study also found that there was no correlation between the three SNPs studied and GA, so only eGFR and Cssmax influenced GA. The average Cssmax in patients with the G allele of SLC22A1 Met408Val, reaching 1.35-fold higher than those with the A allele, requires further studies with regard to metformin safe dose in order to avoid exceeding the recommended therapeutic range."
https://openalex.org/W4288715462,"The nasal route of immunization has become a real alternative to injections. It is indeed described as more efficient at inducing immune protection, since it initiates both mucosal and systemic immunity, thus protecting against both the infection itself and the transmission of pathogens by the host. However, the use of immunomodulators should be limited since they induce inflammation. Here we investigated in vitro the mechanisms underlying the enhancement of antigen immunogenicity by starch nanoparticles (NPL) delivery systems in H292 epithelial cells, as well as the NPL's immunomodulatory effect. We observed that NPL had no intrinsic immunomodulatory effect but enhanced the immunogenicity of an E. coli lysate (Ag) merely by increasing its intracellular delivery. Moreover, we demonstrated the importance of the NPL density on their efficiency by comparing reticulated (NPL) and non-reticulated particles (NPL·NR). These results show that an efficient delivery system is sufficient to induce a mucosal immune response without the use of immunomodulators."

In this technique, the sequence amplitudes are extracted by extracting the phase-angle of the FFPS and FFNS components. The extracted phase-angles have DC and double frequency AC components. The AC component is filtered out by using a Moving Average Filter (MAF) of appropriate window length. From the extracted phase-angle, the unknown frequency can be estimated by using a suitable controller. A frequency-fixed equidistant samples-based pre-loop filter is also applied to eliminate the effect of measurement offset. The proposed technique has a very simple structure and is easy to tune. Small-signal modeling-based stability analysis and gain tuning procedure are also provided. The proposed technique strikes a good balance between fast convergence and disturbance rejection capability. Comparative numerical simulation and experimental results with similar other techniques demonstrate the suitability and performance enhancement by the proposed technique."
https://openalex.org/W4289262039,"The 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake (within Fukushima, Iwate, and Miyagi prefectures) was a complex disaster; it caused a tsunami and the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident, resulting in radiation exposure. This study investigated the earthquake’s effects on the migration patterns of pregnant women and their concerns regarding radiation exposure. We also considered the following large-scale earthquakes without radiation exposure: Great Hanshin-Awaji (Hyogo prefecture), Niigata-Chuetsu, and Kumamoto. Pregnant women were categorized as outflow and inflow pregnant women. Data on the annual number of births three years before and after the earthquake were used as a denominator to calculate the outflow and inflow rates per 100 births. The odds ratios of annual outflow and inflow rates after the earthquake, using three years before the earthquake as the baseline, were calculated. The odds-ratio for outflow significantly increased for Hyogo, Fukushima, Miyagi, and Kumamoto prefectures after the earthquake, particularly for Fukushima, showing a significant increase until three years post the Great East Japan Earthquake (disaster year: odds-ratio: 2.66 [95% confidence interval: 2.44–2.90], 1 year post: 1.37 [1.23–1.52], 2 years post: 1.13 [1.00–1.26], 3 years post: 1.18 [1.05–1.31]), while the remaining three prefectures reported limited increases post one year. The inflow decreased after the earthquake, particularly in Fukushima, showing a significant decrease until 2 years post the Great East Japan Earthquake (disaster year: 0.58 [0.53–0.63], 1 year post: 0.76 [0.71–0.82], 2 years post: 0.83 [0.77–0.89]). Thus, pregnant women’s migration patterns changed after large-scale earthquakes, suggesting radiation exposure concerns possibly have a significant effects. These results suggested that plans for receiving assistance and support that considers the peculiarities of disaster related damage and pregnant women’s migration patterns are needed in both the affected and non-affected areas."

The burst ratio parameter, which reflects the tendency of losses to form long series, is studied in detail. Perhaps the most versatile model of the arrival stream is used, i.e. the batch Markovian arrival process (BMAP). Among other things, it enables modeling the interarrival time density function, the interarrival time autocorrelation function and batch arrivals. The main contribution in an exact formula for the burst ratio in a queue with BMAP arrivals and arbitrary service time distribution. The formula is presented in an explicite, ready-to-use form. Additionally, the impact of various system parameters on the burst ratio is demonstrated in numerical examples. The primary application area of the results is computer networking, where the complex nature of traffic has a deep impact on the burst ratio. However, due to the versatile arrival model, the results can be applied in other fields as well."

As movement development in children emerges through physical activity (PA), it is important to determine the extent of PA promotion within movement competence focused teaching pedagogies. Therefore, this study aimed to assess children's moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and related teaching practices in primary PE within Linear pedagogy and Nonlinear pedagogy and to compare this to current practice within PE delivery in primary schools.Participants (n = 162, 53% females, 5-6y) were recruited from 9 primary schools within the SAMPLE-PE cluster randomised controlled trial. Schools were randomly-allocated to one of three conditions: Linear pedagogy, Nonlinear pedagogy, or control. Nonlinear and Linear pedagogy intervention schools received a PE curriculum delivered by trained deliverers over 15 weeks, while control schools followed usual practice. Children's MVPA was measured during 3 PE lessons (44 PE lessons in total) using an ActiGraph GT9X accelerometer worn on their non-dominant wrist. Differences between conditions for children's MVPA were analysed using multilevel model analysis. Negative binomial models were used to analyse teaching practices data.No differences were found between Linear pedagogy, Nonlinear pedagogy and the control group for children's MVPA levels during PE. Linear and Nonlinear interventions generally included higher percentages of MVPA promoting teaching practices (e.g., Motor Content) and lower MVPA reducing teaching practices (e.g., Management), compared to the control group. Teaching practices observed in Linear and Nonlinear interventions were in line with the respective pedagogical principles.Linear and Nonlinear pedagogical approaches in PE do not negatively impact MVPA compared to usual practice. Nevertheless, practitioners may need to refine these pedagogical approaches to improve MVPA alongside movement competence."
https://openalex.org/W4288687333,"This study investigates visuospatial memory in patients with unilateral lesions of the temporal lobe and the hippocampus resulting from surgery to treat drug-resistant epilepsy. To detect impairments of visuospatial memory in these individuals, a memory test should be specific to episodic memory, the type of memory in which the hippocampus is crucially involved. However, most known visuospatial memory tests do not focus on episodic memory. We hypothesized that a new sequential visuospatial memory test, which has been previously developed and applied only in healthy subjects, might be suitable to fill this gap. The test requires the subject to reproduce a memorized sequence of target locations in ordered recall by typing on a blank graphics tablet. The length of the memorized sequence extended successively after repeated presentation of a sequence of 20 target positions. The test was done twice on day one and again after one week. Visual working memory was tested with the Corsi block-tapping task. The performance in the new test was also related to the performance of the patients in the standard test battery of the neuropsychological examination in the clinical context. Thirteen patients and 14 controls participated. Patients showed reduced learning speed in the new sequential visuospatial memory task. Right-sided lesions induced stronger impairments than left-sided lesions. After one week, retention was reduced in the patients with left-sided lesions. The performance of the patients in commonly used tests of the neuropsychological standard battery did not differ compared to healthy subjects, whereas the new test allowed discrimination between patients and controls at a high correct-decision rate of 0.89. The Corsi block-span of the patients was slightly shorter than that of the controls. The results suggest that the new test provides a specific investigation of episodic visuospatial memory. Hemispheric asymmetries were consistent with the general hypothesis of right hemispheric dominance in visuospatial processing."

Cyber criminals are interested in IoT because it offers a variety of benefits for users, but it still poses many types of threats. The most common form of attack against IoT is Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). The growth of preventive processes against DDoS attacks has prompted IoT professionals and security experts to focus on this topic. Due to the increasing prevalence of DDoS attacks, some methods for distinguishing different types of DDoS attacks based on individual network features have become hard to implement. Additionally, monitoring traffic pattern changes and detecting DDoS attacks with accuracy are urgent and necessary. In this paper, using Modified Whale Optimization Algorithm (MWOA) feature extraction and Hybrid Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), shown that DDoS attack detection methods can be developed and tested on various datasets. The MWOA technique, which is used to optimize the weights of the LSTM neural network to reduce prediction errors in the hybrid LSTM algorithm, is used. Additionally, MWOA can optimally extract IP packet features and identify DDoS attacks with the support of MWOA-LSTM model. The proposed MWOA-LSTM framework outperforms standard support vector machines (SVM) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) as well as standard methods for detecting attacks based on precision, recall and accuracy measurements."
https://openalex.org/W4288692546,"It has been demonstrated earlier in healthy adult volunteers that visually and multisensory (audiovisual) guided equivalence learning are similarly effective. Thus, these processes seem to be independent of stimulus modality. The question arises as to whether this phenomenon can be observed also healthy children and adolescents. To assess this, visual and audiovisual equivalence learning was tested in 157 healthy participants younger than 18 years of age, in both a visual and an audiovisual paradigm consisting of acquisition, retrieval and generalization phases. Performance during the acquisition phase (building of associations), was significantly better in the multisensory paradigm, but there was no difference between the reaction times (RTs). Performance during the retrieval phase (where the previously learned associations are tested) was also significantly better in the multisensory paradigm, and RTs were significantly shorter. On the other hand, transfer (generalization) performance (where hitherto not learned but predictable associations are tested) was not significantly enhanced in the multisensory paradigm, while RTs were somewhat shorter. Linear regression analysis revealed that all the studied psychophysical parameters in both paradigms showed significant correlation with the age of the participants. Audiovisual stimulation enhanced acquisition and retrieval as compared to visual stimulation only, regardless of whether the subjects were above or below 12 years of age. Our results demonstrate that multisensory stimuli significantly enhance association learning and retrieval in the context of sensory guided equivalence learning in healthy children and adolescents. However, the audiovisual gain was significantly higher in the cohort below 12 years of age, which suggests that audiovisually guided equivalence learning is still in development in childhood."

Serum levels of BDNF and CRH were measured with the help of a commercially available sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Genotyping for the rs11030094 polymorphism of the BDNF gene and for the rs242924 polymorphism of the corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRH-R1) gene was performed by a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).There was a significant relationship between the CRH-R1 rs242924 and BDNF rs11030094 polymorphisms and vitiligo. Moreover, serum levels of neurotransmitters differed significantly between vitiligo and control groups and were associated with the CRH-R1 rs242924 and BDNF rs11030094 SNPs.Our findings demonstrated the association between CRH-R1 rs242924 and BDNF rs11030094 polymorphisms and vitiligo. Further studies need to be carried out in vitiligo patients to confirm the results observed."

This study evaluated the morphological and nutritional variability of natal grass [ Melinis repens (Willd.) Zizka] plants produced from seed irradiated with gamma radiation. Natal grass seed was collected from wild populations in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico. The seed was exposed to a source of Co 60 . The radiation doses were: 0, 10, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300 and 350 Gray (Gy). Sixty-six first generation mutant genotypes (M1), produced from irradiated seed, and nine non-mutant genotypes (M0), developed from non-irradiated seed (0 Gy), were evaluated. For the morphological characterization, 18 variables were measured on the plants when they were at the reproductive stage. The nutritional analysis was performed on the M0, as well as on a group of plants from the M1, which resulted morphologically different (p &lt;0.005) from the rest. The differenced M1 plants were classified as promising mutant genotypes (M1p). Results showed that variability was induced in the M1p. These individuals presented morphological differences in leaf weight-tillering weight ratio and foliage height, compared to the rest of the plants (p &lt;0.001). The M1p 250–10 genotype presented the highest (p &lt;0.001) crude protein and the lowest (p &lt;0.001) lignin contents. Gamma radiation in the seed of natal grass induced morphological and nutritional variability. With that, promising mutant genotypes, with desirable morphological and nutritional attributes, were identified."

The objective of our study was to use a simplified approach to calculate viraemic-time: the proportion of follow-up time with unsuppressed VL above the limit of detection. We estimated risk factors for higher viraemic-time and whether viraemic-time predicted mortality in a second-line antiretroviral treatment (ART) cohort in Myanmar.We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of people living with HIV (PLHIV) who received second-line ART for a period >6 months and who had at least two HIV VL test results between 01 January 2014 and 30 April 2018. Fractional logistic regression assessed risk factors for having higher viraemic-time and Cox proportional hazards regression assessed the association between viraemic-time and mortality. Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted to illustrate survival probability for different viraemic-time categories.Among 1,352 participants, 815 (60.3%) never experienced viraemia, and 172 (12.7%), 214 (15.8%), and 80 (5.9%) participants were viraemic <20%, 20-49%, and 50-79% of their total follow-up time, respectively. Few (71; 5.3%) participants were ≥80% of their total follow-up time viraemic. The odds for having higher viraemic-time were higher among people with a history of injecting drug use (aOR 2.01, 95% CI 1.30-3.10, p = 0.002), sex workers (aOR 2.10, 95% CI 1.11-4.00, p = 0.02) and patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir (vs. atazanavir; aOR 1.53, 95% CI 1.12-2.10, p = 0.008). Viraemic-time was strongly associated with mortality hazard among those with 50-79% and ≥80% viraemic-time (aHR 2.92, 95% CI 1.21-7.10, p = 0.02 and aHR 2.71, 95% CI 1.22-6.01, p = 0.01). This association was not observed in those with viraemic-time <50%.Key populations were at risk for having a higher viraemic-time on second-line ART. Viraemic-time predicts clinical outcomes. Differentiated services should target subgroups at risk for a higher viraemic-time to control both HIV transmission and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4288702710,"As haze pollution intensifies, its impact on tourism is becoming increasingly obvious. However, limited studies have analyzed the impacts of haze pollution on tourism. To explore the contribution rate and impact of PM2.5 pollution on tourism flows, panel data on 341 prefecture-level cities in China from 2001 to 2015 were used. The results illustrated that the changes in PM2.5 pollution and domestic tourism flows showed a similar partial-most anti-phase main spatial pattern in space, as well as other spatial patterns of PM2.5. From a regional perspective, the contribution rate of PM2.5 to domestic tourism flows was less than that of traditional factors, such as GDP, GDP_500, and 45A, but larger than that of the Airport factor. The contribution rate of the interaction between PM2.5 and 45A on domestic tourism flows was the largest. From a local perspective, PM2.5 pollution had a negative impact on domestic tourism flows in northern China, while it had a positive impact in other regions. The classic environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis showed applicability to the Chinese tourism industry, and the is of great significance for comprehensively understanding the impact of PM2.5 pollution on tourism flows and for promoting the sustainable development of domestic tourism."
https://openalex.org/W4288712682,"Background Psychotic disorders contribute to significant morbidity and mortality partly due to the chronicity of the illness and high relapse rates. Delivering psycho-education messages about disease etiology, their signs and symptoms and the benefits of treatment adherence have been shown to improve clinical outcomes among individuals with psychoses. However, little has been done to examine the feasibility and efficacy of this intervention in low resourced settings. Objective Our primary objective will be to determine the feasibility of recruiting and retaining patients with a first episode psychosis (FEP) and for the secondary objective, we will determine the preliminary efficacy of psycho-education on illness self-management, stigma, adherence to medications and symptom severity. Hypothesis We hypothesize that (i) we will recruit 70% of eligible participants and accrue a sample size of 80 over 20-weeks, retaining 80% of the sample size for 24 weeks, (ii) the intervention will lead to improvement in clinical outcomes (described above). Methods We will recruit 80 adult patients who have been diagnosed with a FEP, received antipsychotic medication at Butabika Hospital and reside within 21km from the Hospital. Trained village health team (VHTs) members will deliver 6 psycho-education sessions to 40 participants and their family members (intervention arm). Participants in the control arm (n = 40) will receive routine care. We will document how feasible it will be to recruit and retain participants over 24 weeks and document the preliminary efficacy of the intervention on illness self-management, stigma, adherence to medications and severity of symptoms. Data analysis We will document the proportion of participants who consent and get recruited, the proportion of those who will get retained and reasons for drop out. We will conduct an intention to treat analysis comparing the groups at weeks 4, 12, 24 and assess the effect of the intervention on the clinical outcomes (described above). We will use the Bonferroni approach to correct for multiple comparisons. Trial registration Clinical trials.gov registration number: NCT 04602585 ."
https://openalex.org/W4289262274,"The need to evaluate suppliers from the perspective of risk analysis by purchasing companies is increasing. Such evaluation of suppliers is conducted primarily by production companies with implemented quality (QMS), environmental (EMS), health and safety management systems (H&amp;SMS), as well as Toyota Production System (TPS). This article aims to examine latent factors for suppliers’ evaluation and to describe the intensity of these factors by the implemented management system. The article provides the results of empirical research conducted with the computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) technique in 151 medium and large manufacturing companies operating in Poland. The risk was classified into three main groups to deepen the research process: management system risks, environment risks, and process risks. This allowed for the formulation of some original conclusions. The results showed that companies implementing standardized management systems take the issue of risk analysis and management more seriously than organizations that do not implement such systems. The research also highlighted the differences in the perception of risk caused by implementing various management systems. The study also found that the industry and business profile specificity also affect the risk assessment in cooperation with suppliers."
