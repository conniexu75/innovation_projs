https://openalex.org/W2021145743,"Sarat Chandarlapaty and colleagues report the identification of mutations in the ESR1 gene affecting the ligand-binding domain of the encoded estrogen receptor in 20% of metastatic hormone-resistant breast cancers. They determine that the mutant receptor has a hormone-independent active state that likely promotes resistance to estrogen-depriving therapies. Seventy percent of breast cancers express estrogen receptor (ER), and most of these are sensitive to ER inhibition. However, many such tumors for unknown reasons become refractory to inhibition of estrogen action in the metastatic setting. We conducted a comprehensive genetic analysis of two independent cohorts of metastatic ER-positive breast tumors and identified mutations in ESR1 affecting the ligand-binding domain (LBD) in 14 of 80 cases. These included highly recurrent mutations encoding p.Tyr537Ser, p.Tyr537Asn and p.Asp538Gly alterations. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the structures of the Tyr537Ser and Asp538Gly mutants involve hydrogen bonding of the mutant amino acids with Asp351, thus favoring the agonist conformation of the receptor. Consistent with this model, mutant receptors drive ER-dependent transcription and proliferation in the absence of hormone and reduce the efficacy of ER antagonists. These data implicate LBD-mutant forms of ER in mediating clinical resistance to hormonal therapy and suggest that more potent ER antagonists may be of substantial therapeutic benefit."
https://openalex.org/W2073367400,"Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in women, and over two-thirds of cases express estrogen receptor-α (ER-α, encoded by ESR1). Through a prospective clinical sequencing program for advanced cancers, we enrolled 11 patients with ER-positive metastatic breast cancer. Whole-exome and transcriptome analysis showed that six cases harbored mutations of ESR1 affecting its ligand-binding domain (LBD), all of whom had been treated with anti-estrogens and estrogen deprivation therapies. A survey of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) identified four endometrial cancers with similar mutations of ESR1. The five new LBD-localized ESR1 mutations identified here (encoding p.Leu536Gln, p.Tyr537Ser, p.Tyr537Cys, p.Tyr537Asn and p.Asp538Gly) were shown to result in constitutive activity and continued responsiveness to anti-estrogen therapies in vitro. Taken together, these studies suggest that activating mutations in ESR1 are a key mechanism in acquired endocrine resistance in breast cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2037918682,"The obesity epidemic has led to an increased incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and type 2 diabetes. AMP-activated protein kinase (Ampk) regulates energy homeostasis and is activated by cellular stress, hormones and the widely prescribed type 2 diabetes drug metformin. Ampk phosphorylates mouse acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (Acc1; refs. 3,4) at Ser79 and Acc2 at Ser212, inhibiting the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. The latter metabolite is a precursor in fatty acid synthesis and an allosteric inhibitor of fatty acid transport into mitochondria for oxidation. To test the physiological impact of these phosphorylation events, we generated mice with alanine knock-in mutations in both Acc1 (at Ser79) and Acc2 (at Ser212) (Acc double knock-in, AccDKI). Compared to wild-type mice, these mice have elevated lipogenesis and lower fatty acid oxidation, which contribute to the progression of insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and NAFLD, but not obesity. Notably, AccDKI mice made obese by high-fat feeding are refractory to the lipid-lowering and insulin-sensitizing effects of metformin. These findings establish that inhibitory phosphorylation of Acc by Ampk is essential for the control of lipid metabolism and, in the setting of obesity, for metformin-induced improvements in insulin action."

We also identified frequent mutations at previously reported hotspots in the IDH1 and IDH2 genes encoding metabolic enzymes in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. In contrast, TP53 was the most frequently altered gene in a series of nine gallbladder carcinomas. These discoveries highlight the key role of dysregulated chromatin remodeling in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas."

https://openalex.org/W2040165511,"The primary visual cortex (V1) carries signals related to visual speed, and its responses are also affected by run speed. Here the authors report that nearly half of the V1 neurons were reliably driven by combinations of visual speed and run speed. As a population, V1 neurons predicted a linear combination of visual and run speed better than visual or run speeds alone. Successful navigation through the world requires accurate estimation of one's own speed. To derive this estimate, animals integrate visual speed gauged from optic flow and run speed gauged from proprioceptive and locomotor systems. The primary visual cortex (V1) carries signals related to visual speed, and its responses are also affected by run speed. To study how V1 combines these signals during navigation, we recorded from mice that traversed a virtual environment. Nearly half of the V1 neurons were reliably driven by combinations of visual speed and run speed. These neurons performed a weighted sum of the two speeds. The weights were diverse across neurons, and typically positive. As a population, V1 neurons predicted a linear combination of visual and run speeds better than either visual or run speeds alone. These data indicate that V1 in the mouse participates in a multimodal processing system that integrates visual motion and locomotion during navigation."
https://openalex.org/W2121923232,"Hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are complex traits representing major global health problems. Multiple genome-wide association studies have identified common variants in the promoter of the UMOD gene, which encodes uromodulin, the major protein secreted in normal urine, that cause independent susceptibility to CKD and hypertension. Despite compelling genetic evidence for the association between UMOD risk variants and disease susceptibility in the general population, the underlying biological mechanism is not understood. Here, we demonstrate that UMOD risk variants increased UMOD expression in vitro and in vivo. Uromodulin overexpression in transgenic mice led to salt-sensitive hypertension and to the presence of age-dependent renal lesions similar to those observed in elderly individuals homozygous for UMOD promoter risk variants. The link between uromodulin and hypertension is due to activation of the renal sodium cotransporter NKCC2. We demonstrated the relevance of this mechanism in humans by showing that pharmacological inhibition of NKCC2 was more effective in lowering blood pressure in hypertensive patients who are homozygous for UMOD promoter risk variants than in other hypertensive patients. Our findings link genetic susceptibility to hypertension and CKD to the level of uromodulin expression and uromodulin's effect on salt reabsorption in the kidney. These findings point to uromodulin as a therapeutic target for lowering blood pressure and preserving renal function."
https://openalex.org/W1991912136,"Matthew Meyerson and colleagues report whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing of 55 small intestine neuroendocrine tumors. They identify recurrent somatic mutations in CDKN1B, implicating cell cycle dysregulation in the pathogenesis of these tumors. The diagnosed incidence of small intestine neuroendocrine tumors (SI-NETs) is increasing, and the underlying genomic mechanisms have not yet been defined. Using exome- and genome-sequence analysis of SI-NETs, we identified recurrent somatic mutations and deletions in CDKN1B, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor gene, which encodes p27. We observed frameshift mutations of CDKN1B in 14 of 180 SI-NETs, and we detected hemizygous deletions encompassing CDKN1B in 7 out of 50 SI-NETs, nominating p27 as a tumor suppressor and implicating cell cycle dysregulation in the etiology of SI-NETs."
https://openalex.org/W2018734911,"Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among men in industrialized countries, accounting for the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Although we now know that the androgen receptor (AR) is important for progression to the deadly advanced stages of the disease, it is poorly understood what AR-regulated processes drive this pathology. Here we demonstrate that AR regulates prostate cancer cell growth via the metabolic sensor 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a kinase that classically regulates cellular energy homeostasis. In patients, activation of AMPK correlated with prostate cancer progression. Using a combination of radiolabeled assays and emerging metabolomic approaches, we also show that prostate cancer cells respond to androgen treatment by increasing not only rates of glycolysis, as is commonly seen in many cancers, but also glucose and fatty acid oxidation. Importantly, this effect was dependent on androgen-mediated AMPK activity. Our results further indicate that the AMPK-mediated metabolic changes increased intracellular ATP levels and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α)-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis, affording distinct growth advantages to the prostate cancer cells. Correspondingly, we used outlier analysis to determine that PGC-1α is overexpressed in a subpopulation of clinical cancer samples. This was in contrast to what was observed in immortalized benign human prostate cells and a testosterone-induced rat model of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Taken together, our findings converge to demonstrate that androgens can co-opt the AMPK-PGC-1α signaling cascade, a known homeostatic mechanism, to increase prostate cancer cell growth. The current study points to the potential utility of developing metabolic-targeted therapies directed toward the AMPK-PGC-1α signaling axis for the treatment of prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2072891641,"Parkinsonism typified by sporadic Parkinson disease is a prevalent neurodegenerative disease. Mutations in PINK1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase 1), a mitochondrial Ser/Thr protein kinase, or PARKIN, a ubiquitin-protein ligase, cause familial parkinsonism. The accumulation and autophosphorylation of PINK1 on damaged mitochondria results in the recruitment of Parkin, which ultimately triggers quarantine and/or degradation of the damaged mitochondria by the proteasome and autophagy. However, the molecular mechanism of PINK1 in dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) has not been fully elucidated. Here we show by fluorescence-based techniques that the PINK1 complex formed following a decrease in ΔΨm is composed of two PINK1 molecules and is correlated with intermolecular phosphorylation of PINK1. Disruption of complex formation by the PINK1 S402A mutation weakened Parkin recruitment onto depolarized mitochondria. The most disease-relevant mutations of PINK1 inhibit the complex formation. Taken together, these results suggest that formation of the complex containing dyadic PINK1 is an important step for Parkin recruitment onto damaged mitochondria.

Less prevalent is the heritable familial early onset parkinsonism. Although the symptoms of hereditary parkinsonism are not the same as sporadic PD, they share a number of clinical features (1Imaizumi Y. Okada Y. Akamatsu W. Koike M. Kuzumaki N. Hayakawa H.

Further, toxic parkinsonism is caused by various inhibitors of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, such as rotenone and MPTP(1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine). Thus, a correlation between parkinsonism and mitochondrial impairment has been well established. Recent studies revealed that when the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) decreases, PINK1 accumulates and is phosphorylated on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) by escaping ΔΨm-dependent degradation (15Narendra D.P.

The suppression of PINK1 transport into the inner mitochondrial membrane by a decrease in ΔΨm triggers an accumulation of PINK1 on OMM (18Lazarou M. Jin S.M. Kane L.A. Youle R.J.

Phosphorylation of Ser-228 and Ser-402 activates the accumulated PINK1, triggering the recruitment of Parkin to the depolarized mitochondria (17Okatsu K. Oka T. Iguchi M. Imamura K. Kosako H. Tani N.

PINK1 autophosphorylation upon membrane potential dissipation is essential for Parkin recruitment to damaged mitochondria.Nat. Commun. 2012; 3: 1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Thus, PINK1 is not only quantitatively but also qualitatively regulated by mitochondrial conditions. However, the dynamics of PINK1 on depolarized mitochondria have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we established a multicolor detection method for resolving with high sensitivity the dynamic interactions of PINK1. Using this method, we demonstrated that PINK1 forms a high molecular weight complex containing a PINK1 dimer. Complex formation is correlated with intermolecular phosphorylation. Defects in PINK1 complex formation significantly reduced Parkin translocation onto depolarized mitochondria, suggesting that PINK1 complex formation might be a pathophysiologically significant process for Parkin-mediated mitochondrial quality control.

Therefore, the KOR has become a prominent drug discovery target toward treating pain, depression, and drug addiction. Agonists at KOR can promote G protein coupling and βarrestin2 recruitment as well as multiple downstream signaling pathways, including ERK1/2 MAPK activation. It has been suggested that the physiological effects of KOR activation result from different signaling cascades, with analgesia being G protein-mediated and dysphoria being mediated through βarrestin2 recruitment. Dysphoria associated with KOR activation limits the therapeutic potential in the use of KOR agonists as analgesics; therefore, it may be beneficial to develop KOR agonists that are biased toward G protein coupling and away from βarrestin2 recruitment. Here, we describe two classes of biased KOR agonists that potently activate G protein coupling but weakly recruit βarrestin2. These potent and functionally selective small molecule compounds may prove to be useful tools for refining the therapeutic potential of KOR-directed signaling in vivo.

The G protein-mediated signaling events are believed to contribute to the analgesic properties of KOR agonists (14Goicoechea C. Ormazábal M.J. Abalo R. Alfaro M.J. Martín M.I.

Unlike MOR agonists, KOR agonists do not cause physical dependence nor do they produce respiratory failure; thus, they are attractive as potent analgesics (16Raehal K.M. Bohn L.M.

However, KOR activation has also been implicated in producing an array of undesirable side effects, including dysphoria (17Pfeiffer A. Brantl V. Herz A. Emrich H.M.

Dynorphin, stress, and depression.Brain Res. 2010; 1314: 56-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). These adverse effects limit the therapeutic potential of KOR agonists as analgesics. It is becoming widely evident that activation of GPCRs by chemically distinct agonists can promote receptor coupling to distinct pathways in different tissues (21Bohn L.M. Neve K.A. 1st Ed.

Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2012; 52: 179-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The KOR also has the potential to signal through multiple downstream signaling cascades, and there is increasing evidence that signaling to alternative cascades may promote side effects associated with KOR activation. In addition to G protein coupling, another proximal event following GPCR activation is the agonist-promoted recruitment of βarrestins. As regulatory and scaffolding proteins, βarrestins can lead to desensitization of the receptor by impeding further G protein coupling; in some cases, βarrestins facilitate the assembly of protein scaffolds, thereby acting as signal transducers (24Luttrell D.K.

For example, βarrestin2 recruitment has been shown to promote recruitment and activation of MAPKs, including ERK1/2 (27Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K.

Interestingly, studies in AtT-20 cells and mouse striatal neurons suggest that the KOR may signal via a GPCR kinase 3 (GRK3)- and a βarrestin2-dependent mechanism to activate the stress MAPK p38 and that this signaling cascade may mediate the dysphoric effects of KOR agonists (29Bruchas M.R.

Endogenously elevated dynorphin levels produced by repeated swim stress tests lead to KOR-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the mouse brain that was not dependent on GRK3 expression (33Bruchas M.R.

Repeated swim stress induces kappa opioid-mediated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2.Neuroreport. 2008; 19: 1417-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, ERK activation may be a useful indicator of both βarrestin-dependent and G protein-dependent signaling states downstream of KOR (34Bruchas M.R. Chavkin C. Kinase cascades and ligand-directed signaling at the kappa opioid receptor.Psychopharmacology. 2010; 210: 137-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because G protein-mediated signaling is implicated in KOR-induced antinociception and βarrestin2-mediated signaling has been implicated in the aversive and dysphoric properties of KOR agonists, the development of G protein-biased agonists may provide a means to optimally tune KOR therapeutics. In two different screening campaigns, we discovered two new classes of KOR agonists, triazole probe 1 and isoquinolinone probe 2 (Fig. 1). The triazole scaffold was identified under the auspices of the Molecular Libraries Probe Production Centers Network via a high throughput screening campaign. In this work, which was done in collaboration with colleagues at Sanford-Burnham Research Institute and Duke University, the National Institutes of Health Small Molecule Repository was screened to identify KOR ligands based on activation of βarrestin2 recruitment (35Hedrick, M.

Following their initial disclosure, these scaffolds were subjected to iterative rounds of medicinal chemistry and structure-activity relationship studies with the goal of developing KOR agonists that are biased toward G protein coupling.

Briefly, CHO-hKOR cells were serum-starved for 1 h in DMEM/F-12 media, collected with 5 mm EDTA, washed with PBS, and stored at −80 °C. For each assay, cell pellets were homogenized via Teflon-on-glass homogenizer in buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), passed through a 26-gauge needle eight times, centrifuged twice at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and resuspended in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 3 μm GDP). For each reaction, 15 μg of membrane protein were incubated in assay buffer containing ∼0.1 nm [35S]GTPγS and increasing concentrations of compounds in a total volume of 200 μl for 1 h at room temperature. The reactions were terminated by rapid filtration over GF/B filters using a 96-well plate harvester (Brandel Inc., Gaithersburg, MD).

https://openalex.org/W2056943012,"The role of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) in spontaneous miniature neurotransmitter release is incompletely understood. We found that stochastic opening of P/Q-, N- and R-type VGCCs accounts for ∼50% of all spontaneous glutamate release at rat cultured hippocampal synapses, and that R-type channels have a far greater role in spontaneous than in action potential-evoked exocytosis. VGCC-dependent miniature neurotransmitter release (minis) showed similar sensitivity to presynaptic Ca2+ chelation as evoked release, arguing for direct triggering of spontaneous release by transient spatially localized Ca(2+) domains. Experimentally constrained three-dimensional diffusion modeling of Ca2+ influx-exocytosis coupling was consistent with clustered distribution of VGCCs in the active zone of small hippocampal synapses and revealed that spontaneous VGCCs openings can account for the experimentally observed VGCC-dependent minis, although single channel openings triggered release with low probability. Uncorrelated stochastic VGCC opening is therefore a major trigger for spontaneous glutamate release, with differential roles for distinct channel subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W2130127196,"Timing is a crucial aspect of synaptic integration. For pyramidal neurons that integrate thousands of synaptic inputs spread across hundreds of microns, it is thus a challenge to maintain the timing of incoming inputs at the axo-somatic integration site. Here we show that pyramidal neurons in the rodent hippocampus use a gradient of inductance in the form of hyperpolarization-activated cation-nonselective (HCN) channels as an active mechanism to counteract location-dependent temporal differences of dendritic inputs at the soma. Using simultaneous multi-site whole-cell recordings complemented by computational modeling, we find that this intrinsic biophysical mechanism produces temporal synchrony of rhythmic inputs in the theta and gamma frequency ranges across wide regions of the dendritic tree. While gamma and theta oscillations are known to synchronize activity across space in neuronal networks, our results identify a new mechanism by which this synchrony extends to activity within single pyramidal neurons with complex dendritic arbors."
https://openalex.org/W2092909753,"Metastatic breast tumors undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which renders them resistant to therapies targeted to the primary cancers. The mechanistic link between mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) reduction, often seen in breast cancer patients, and EMT is unknown. We demonstrate that reducing mtDNA content in human mammary epithelial cells (hMECs) activates Calcineurin (Cn)-dependent mitochondrial retrograde signaling pathway, which induces EMT-like reprogramming to fibroblastic morphology, loss of cell polarity, contact inhibition and acquired migratory and invasive phenotype. Notably, mtDNA reduction generates breast cancer stem cells. In addition to retrograde signaling markers, there is an induction of mesenchymal genes but loss of epithelial markers in these cells. The changes are reversed by either restoring the mtDNA content or knockdown of CnAα mRNA, indicating the causal role of retrograde signaling in EMT. Our results point to a new therapeutic strategy for metastatic breast cancers targeted to the mitochondrial retrograde signaling pathway for abrogating EMT and attenuating cancer stem cells, which evade conventional therapies. We report a novel regulatory mechanism by which low mtDNA content generates EMT and cancer stem cells in hMECs."
https://openalex.org/W2116232319,"Acyl-CoA:lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT) enzymes have central roles in acyl editing of phosphatidylcholine (PC). Plant LPCAT genes were expressed in yeast and characterized biochemically in microsomal preparations of the cells. Specificities for different acyl-CoAs were similar for seven LPCATs from five different species, including species accumulating hydroxylated acyl groups in their seed oil, with a preference for C18-unsaturated acyl-CoA and low activity with palmitoyl-CoA and ricinoleoyl (12-hydroxyoctadec-9-enoyl)-CoA. We showed that Arabidopsis LPCAT1 and LPCAT2 enzymes catalyzed the acylation and de-acylation of both sn positions of PC, with a preference for the sn-2 position. When acyl specificities of the Arabidopsis LPCATs were measured in the reverse reaction, sn-2-bound oleoyl, linoleoyl, and linolenoyl groups from PC were transferred to acyl-CoA to a similar extent. However, a ricinoleoyl group at the sn-2-position of PC was removed 4-6-fold faster than an oleoyl group in the reverse reaction, despite poor utilization in the forward reaction. The data presented, taken together with earlier published reports on in vivo lipid metabolism, support the hypothesis that plant LPCAT enzymes play an important role in regulating the acyl-CoA composition in plant cells by transferring polyunsaturated and hydroxy fatty acids produced on PC directly to the acyl-CoA pool for further metabolism or catabolism."

Early studies of substrate specificity of BCO1 used liver and intestine homogenates to show the enzymatic production of retinal from provitamin A carotenoids (β-carotene, α-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin) and β-apocarotenals (β-apo-8′-, β-apo-10′-, and β-apo-12′-carotenal) (14Grolier P.

In raw fruits and vegetables, β-carotene exists predominantly in the all-trans form, but processing leads to an increase of cis isomers, particularly 9-cis and 13-cis forms (18Chandler L.A. Schwartz S.J. HPLC separation of cis-trans carotene isomers in fresh and processed fruits and vegetables.J. Food Sci. 1987; 52: 669-672Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar). These isomers have also been detected in human plasma (19Gaziano J.M. Johnson E.J. Russell R.M. Manson J.E. Stampfer M.J. Ridker P.M. Frei B. Hennekens C.H. Krinsky N.I.

Cleavage activity with these β-carotene isomers have been shown by incubation with intestine and liver homogenates (14Grolier P. Duszka C. Borel P. Alexandre-Gouabau M.C. Azais-Braesco V.

Carotenoids are relatively easy to oxidize, and even no-enzyme incubations carried out for relatively long periods (1 h) with β-carotene produces random cleavage products (23Hansen S. Maret W. Retinal is not formed in vitro by enzymatic central cleavage of β-carotene.Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 200-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The intestine contains other enzymes that could potentially oxidize carotenoids (reviewed by Hansen and Maret (23Hansen S. Maret W. Retinal is not formed in vitro by enzymatic central cleavage of β-carotene.Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 200-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)). Indeed, early studies with intestine homogenates have detected random cleavage products in addition to retinal (11Wang X.D. Tang G.W. Fox J.G. Krinsky N.I. Russell R.M.

Although the use of an anti-oxidant such as α-tocopherol reduces the amount of random cleavage products (25Yeum K.J. dos Anjos Ferreira A.L. Smith D. Krinsky N.I. Russell R.M.

Two studies have used purified recombinant BCO1 preparations to study substrate specificity and, for the most part, agree with the suggestion of previous studies that BCO1 only cleaves carotenoids with at least one unsubstituted β-ionone ring (1Lindqvist A.

Specifically, both studies showed that purified recombinant BCO1 does not cleave lycopene. Yan et al. (27Yan W. Jang G.F. Haeseleer F. Esumi N. Chang J. Kerrigan M. Campochiaro M. Campochiaro P.

These studies are in contrast with the study of Redmond et al., who observed that expression of murine BCO1 in lycopene-accumulating Escherichia coli results in bleaching of the red lycopene pigment, indicating cleavage of lycopene (4Redmond T.M.

In this work, we investigated the activity of purified recombinant human BCO1 with major dietary carotenoids and β-apocarotenals. We show that purified recombinant human BCO1 catalyzes the cleavage of lycopene to produce acycloretinal (apo-15-lycopenal) and β-apocarotenals as short as β-apo-14′-carotenal to produce retinal. We also find that it does not catalyze the cleavage of 9-cis-β-carotene. β-Carotene (≥97%), all-trans-retinal (≥98%), 9-cis-retinal (≥95%), 13-cis-retinal (≥85%), α-carotene (≥95%), β-cryptoxanthin (≥97%), zeaxanthin (≥95%), lutein (≥90%), and β-apo-8′-carotenal (≥96%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The lycopene standard (92% all-trans, 6% 5-cis, 2% other isomers) was a gift from Dr. Steven J. Schwartz of The Ohio State University. β-Apo-10′-carotenal, β-apo-12′-carotenal, and β-apo-14′-carotenal were synthesized according to published methods (28Eroglu A. Hruszkewycz D.P. dela Sena C. Narayanasamy S. Riedl K.M. Kopec R.E. Schwartz S.J. Curley Jr., R.W. Harrison E.H.

Chem. 2012; 287: 15886-15895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The synthesis of acycloretinal (apo-15-lycopenal) used similar methods and will be reported in a future publication. The structures of synthesized substrates and standards were confirmed by mass spectrometry, ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and purity (≥95%) was further assessed by HPLC analysis. All experiments involving carotenoids and retinoids were done under amber lights. Betatene® is a supplement of carotenoids extracted from the alga Dunaliella salina that is known to have relatively high amounts of 9-cis-β-carotene (29Stahl W. Schwarz W. Sies H. Human serum concentrations of all-trans β- and α-carotene but not 9-cis β-carotene increase upon ingestion of a natural isomer mixture obtained from Dunaliella salina (Betatene).J. Nutr. 1993; 123: 847-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Five capsules of Betatene® (Swanson Vitamins) were sliced open under methanol, and the resulting slurry of carotenoids was transferred to a conical glass centrifuge tube. The mixture was centrifuged, and the residue was washed three times with 5 ml of ethanol per wash. The residue was transferred to a separatory funnel with 1:1 (v/v) hexane-methanol. The volume of the mixture was then brought up to ∼100 ml of 1:1 (v/v) hexane-methanol, and 5 ml of water was added, producing two phases. The hexane layer was evaporated under argon, and the residue was dissolved in 75:25 (v/v) methanol-methyl t-butyl ether. The sample was separated using HPLC method C described below. The 9-cis-β-carotene fraction was collected, evaporated under argon, and stored at −80 °C until used. The product is ∼95% pure by HPLC. A pET-28b plasmid vector containing the cDNA of human BCO1 with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag was a gift from Dr. William Blaner of Columbia University. The plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21-Gold(DE3) (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transformed bacterial cells were grown in LB broth (Sigma-Aldrich) to an A600 of 0.5–0.7 at 30 °C, and expression of the recombinant protein was induced by adding isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (Gold Biotechnology) to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. Five liters of culture were grown for 24 h, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cell pastes were frozen at −80 °C and thawed prior to lysis. The cells were lysed by gentle stirring with lysis buffer (50 mm phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 mm imidazole, 10 mg/ml chicken egg white lysozyme (Sigma), 0.1 μl/ml benzonase nuclease HC (Novagen), 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride, and 1 tablet of EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)/50 ml), using 5 ml of lysis buffer per gram of wet cell paste. The lysis was conducted in ice for 1 h. The lysate was centrifuged at 15,600 × g for 25 min, and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-μm syringe-driven filter. The NaCl concentration of the filtered supernatant was brought up to 300 mm using salt adjustment buffer (50 mm phosphate, 2,500 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 mm imidazole) and stirred with 0.5 ml of HisPur resin (Pierce) that has been previously washed with equilibration buffer (50 mm phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 mm imidazole) for 1 h in an ice bath. The resin was harvested by centrifugation at 700 × g for 2 min and transferred to a gravity column. The resin was then eluted with the following solutions, which were prepared by combining the calculated amounts of equilibration buffer (2.5 mm imidazole) and elution buffer (same composition as equilibration buffer except for 150 mm imidazole): 4 ml of 2.5 mm imidazole (equilibration buffer), 1.5 ml of 10 mm imidazole, 1 ml each of 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 mm imidazole (elution buffer). The fractions with pure protein were transferred into the final storage buffer (50 mm phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) using a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare). SDS-PAGE was used to assess the purity of the protein throughout the purification process. The concentration of the protein solution was measured using the reducing agent-compatible bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce). The protein was stored at −80 °C until used. The in vitro BCO1 enzyme assay was based on the method of During et al. (13During A. Nagao A. Hoshino C. Terao J. Assay of β-carotene 15,15′-dioxygenase activity by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography.Anal. Biochem. 1996; 241: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) with the following exceptions. First, 500 μl of 1:1 (v/v) acetonitrile-isopropyl alcohol (instead of acetonitrile alone) was added after quenching the reaction with formaldehyde. Second, the resulting mixture was filtered through a 0.22-μm syringe filter instead of centrifugation to remove the insoluble particles. Third, only 100 μl of the sample, instead of 200 μl as in the original method, was injected into the HPLC. Five hundred ng of purified recombinant BCO1 are used per reaction, and the reaction time is 15 min, unless otherwise indicated. Standard curves were generated by dissolving various amounts of standard compounds (retinal or apo-15-lycopenal) in a solution of 200:0.3:50:250:250 (v/v/v/v) water, Tween 40, 37% formaldehyde acetonitrile, isopropyl alcohol, which has the same ratio of solvents as the samples obtained from the reaction mixtures. The assay is sensitive to Triton X-100 concentration. We have found the optimum enzyme activity at 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and all assays are carried out at this constant concentration of Triton X-100. The reaction products were analyzed using an Agilent 1200 Series HPLC system and a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 LC column (4.6 × 50 mm, 1.8 μm, Agilent) with a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 guard column (4.6 × 12.5 mm, 5 μm, Agilent) or a Nova-Pak C18 reverse-phase analytical column (3.9 × 150 mm, 4 μm, Waters) with a Nova-Pak C18 guard column (3.9 × 20 mm, 4 μm, Waters). The column thermostat was set to 35 °C, and the flow rate was 1 ml/min. The following elution profile was used with 75:25 (v/v) acetonitrile and water with 0.1% NH4CH3COO (solvent A) and 72:18:10 (v/v) isopropyl alcohol and acetonitrile water with 0.1% NH4CH3COO (solvent B): gradient from 100% solvent A-100% solvent B over 10 min, 100% solvent B for 10 min, gradient from 100 solvent B-100% solvent A over 6 s, and 100% solvent A for 4 min. Elution was monitored at 380, 414, and 453 nm. Retinal isomers were separated on a YMC Carotenoid S-3 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 3 μm). The following elution profile was used with water (solvent A) and 75:25 (v/v) acetonitrile, methyl tert-butyl ether (solvent B): 55% B for the first 5 min, followed by a gradient from 55% to 62.5% B over 25 min. The flow rate used was 1 ml/min, and the column thermostat was set to 35 °C. Elution was monitored at 380 nm. β-Carotene isomers were analyzed using a YMC-carotenoid S-3 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 3 μm), with 75:25 (v/v) methanol-methyl t-butyl ether as mobile phase, a flow rate of 1.4 ml/min, and a column temperature of 35 °C. This was based on the HPLC method of Maeda et al. (31Maeda T. Perusek L. Amengual J. Babino D. Palczewski K. von Lintig J. Dietary 9-cis-β, β-carotene fails to rescue vision in mouse models of leber congenital amaurosis.Mol. Pharmacol. 2011; 80: 943-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Elution was monitored at 450 nm. For multiple reaction monitoring analysis, the BCO1-lycopene reaction mixture was separated by an Agilent 1200 SL HPLC system (Agilent Technologies) using a YMC C30 column with dimensions 150 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm (Waters). The flow rate was 1.3 ml/min, and the column temperature was 35 °C. The composition of solvents was as follows: A = 80:20, methanol/water with 0.04% (w/v) ammonium acetate; B = 78:20:2 methanol-methyl t-butyl ether/methanol/water with 0.04% (w/v) ammonium acetate. A linear eluting gradient was applied as follows: 0–35.6% B for over 9 min, 35.6–100% B over 6.5 min, isocratic 100% B for 2.5 min, 100% B to 100% A over 0.1 min, and re-equilibrated for 3.4 min. The BCO1-lycopene reaction mixture was separated using the HPLC method D described in the previous section. The HPLC was interfaced with a QTrap 5500 mass spectrometer (ABSciex), operated as a triple quadrupole, using an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source in positive ion mode. Additional settings were as follows: nebulizer current, 5 μA; nebulizer temperature, 500 °C; declustering potential, 80 V. MS/MS transitions were optimized for acycloretinal using authentic standard prepared by organic synthesis. The multiple reaction monitoring sequence included transitions m/z 285 > 69, 119, 135, and 161 using collision energies of 28, 15, 15, and 14 eV, respectively. Data from plots of reaction velocity versus substrate concentration were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using GraphPad Prism (version 4). The pET-28b-human BCO1 plasmid was sequenced to verify the alignment with the sequence reported in PubMed (accession no. NM_017429.2, corresponding to a 547-amino acid peptide). The clone has an additional eight amino acids at the C terminus corresponding to the hexahistidine tag. The theoretical mass of the protein including the hexahistidine tag is 63,702 Da. The protein tends to form inclusion bodies under conditions that favor high rate of expression (high isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and high growth temperature). Five liters of culture grown under the conditions described above yields 2–3 mg of purified protein. Sample purification gels are shown in Fig. 1. The enzyme is soluble in detergent-free phosphate buffer. However, we found greater activity if detergent is maintained through purification and storage. The average specific activity of our enzyme preparation is 132.1 ± 23.8 (mean ± S.D., n = 5) nmol retinal/mg BCO1/h, measured using 20 μm β-carotene and 500 ng of BCO1 per reaction. Our BCO1 preparation is active even without the addition of Fe2+, and all enzyme incubations are performed without addition of the latter. The kinetic data for β-carotene is shown in Fig. 2. The production of retinal is linear up to 15 min and 500 ng of enzyme/200 μl reaction (Fig. 2, A and B). We found trace amounts of β-apocarotenals in the β-carotene-BCO1 reaction mixtures. We first conducted experiments to see whether BCO1 catalyzed cleavage of β-carotene at positions other than the 15–15′ bond. However, there was no evidence of enzyme-dependent formation of these β-apocarotenals (Fig. 3). Even at the higher protein concentrations tested when making the BCO1 protein curve (Fig. 2B), there was still no evidence that β-apocarotenals are formed enzymatically. Thus, BCO1 cleaves solely at the central 15–15′ bond. Six major dietary carotenoids (β-carotene, lycopene, α-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, zeaxanthin, and lutein) as well as β-apocarotenals (β-apo-8′-carotenal, β-apo-10′-carotenal, β-apo-12′-carotenal, and β-apo-14′-carotenal) were tested for activity with BCO1, comparing peak areas from 15-min reactions with time zero, boiled enzyme, and no enzyme controls. We detected enzymatic cleavage activity with all of the test substrates except for zeaxanthin and lutein. For the asymmetrical provitamin A carotenoids α-carotene and β-cryptoxanthin, two product peaks were detected, one corresponding to all-trans-retinal, and the other corresponding to the non-retinal half of the molecule. However, we only quantified the amount of all-trans-retinal produced in the reaction. For lycopene, acycloretinal was detected as product (Fig. 4), and synthetic acycloretinal was used to generate standard curves for quantification. Time courses were run for all other substrates using a 500 ng of BCO1/200 μl reaction, and the production of retinal (or acyloretinal in the case of lycopene) was linear within the first 15–25 min (data not shown). The dependence of reaction velocity on substrate concentration is shown in Figs. 2C, 5, and 6. The carotenoids and β-apocarotenals vary in solubility, and this affects the range of concentrations that can be tested.FIGURE 6Substrate-velocity plots for β-apocarotenals. The reactions were performed using 500 ng of BCO1/200 μl reaction and 15 min of reaction time at 37 °C. Each data point represents the average of three independent experiments. Only β-apo-8′-carotenal displays Michaelis-Menten kinetics (shown in Fig. 5) in the assay conditions used.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The kinetic data for all substrates were tested, and their values relative to β-carotene are shown in Fig. 7. With the exception of β-apo-8′-carotenal, the substrate curves for the β-apocarotenals do not fit well with the Michaelis-Menten equation (Fig. 6). The kinetic data with the full-length carotenoids suggest that a β-ionone ring conjugated to the rest of the polyene chain is essential for activity. Hydroxylation of the ring (as in β-cryptoxanthin) or loss of conjugation between the ring and the rest of the polyene chain (as in α-carotene) result in a decrease in catalytic activity. Hydroxylation of both rings (as in zeaxanthin and lutein) results in a loss of activity. Surprisingly, lycopene is cleaved by BCO1 at a catalytic efficiency similar to β-carotene. Although the Vmax of lycopene is low, the Km is also low, thus resulting in a relatively high kcat/Km value. Fig. 8, A–C, shows the chromatograms for the Betatene® hexane extract, all-trans-β-carotene standard, and the purified 9-cis-β-carotene. We incubated 9-cis-β-carotene (20 μm) wi"
https://openalex.org/W2081557134,"Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) induce severe inflammation in poultry and men. One characteristic of HPAIV infections is the induction of a cytokine burst that strongly contributes to viral pathogenicity. This cell-intrinsic hypercytokinemia seems to involve hyperinduction of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Here we investigate the role of p38 MAPK signaling in the antiviral response against HPAIV in mice as well as in human endothelial cells, the latter being a primary source of cytokines during systemic infections. Global gene expression profiling of HPAIV-infected endothelial cells in the presence of the p38-specific inhibitor SB 202190 revealed that inhibition of p38 MAPK leads to reduced expression of IFNβ and other cytokines after H5N1 and H7N7 infection. More than 90% of all virus-induced genes were either partially or fully dependent on p38 signaling. Moreover, promoter analysis confirmed a direct impact of p38 on the IFNβ promoter activity. Furthermore, upon treatment with IFN or conditioned media from HPAIV-infected cells, p38 controls interferon-stimulated gene expression by coregulating STAT1 by phosphorylation at serine 727. In vivo inhibition of p38 MAPK greatly diminishes virus-induced cytokine expression concomitant with reduced viral titers, thereby protecting mice from lethal infection. These observations show that p38 MAPK acts on two levels of the antiviral IFN response. Initially the kinase regulates IFN induction and, at a later stage, p38 controls IFN signaling and thereby expression of IFN-stimulated genes. Thus, inhibition of MAP kinase p38 may be an antiviral strategy that protects mice from lethal influenza by suppressing excessive cytokine expression."
https://openalex.org/W1964820326,"Activation of serine biosynthesis supports growth and proliferation of cancer cells. Human cancers often exhibit overexpression of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), the metabolic enzyme that catalyses the reaction that diverts serine biosynthesis from the glycolytic pathway. By refueling serine biosynthetic pathways, cancer cells sustain their metabolic requirements, promoting macromolecule synthesis, anaplerotic flux and ATP. Serine biosynthesis intersects glutaminolysis and together with this pathway provides substrates for production of antioxidant GSH. In human lung adenocarcinomas we identified a correlation between serine biosynthetic pathway and p73 expression. Metabolic profiling of human cancer cell line revealed that TAp73 activates serine biosynthesis, resulting in increased intracellular levels of serine and glycine, associated to accumulation of glutamate, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) anaplerotic intermediates and GSH. However, at molecular level p73 does not directly regulate serine metabolic enzymes, but transcriptionally controls a key enzyme of glutaminolysis, glutaminase-2 (GLS-2). p73, through GLS-2, favors conversion of glutamine in glutamate, which in turn drives the serine biosynthetic pathway. Serine and glutamate can be then employed for GSH synthesis, thus the p73-dependent metabolic switch enables potential response against oxidative stress. In knockdown experiment, indeed, TAp73 depletion completely abrogates cancer cell proliferation capacity in serine/glycine-deprivation, supporting the role of p73 to help cancer cells under metabolic stress. These findings implicate p73 in regulation of cancer metabolism and suggest that TAp73 influences glutamine and serine metabolism, affecting GSH synthesis and determining cancer pathogenesis."

How autophagy is regulated by hormonal signals in response to major changes in metabolic state is not well understood. Here, we provide evidence that myonectin (CTRP15), a skeletal muscle-derived myokine, is a novel regulator of cellular autophagy. Starvation activated liver autophagy, whereas nutrient supplementation following food deprivation suppressed it; the former and latter correlated with reduced and increased expression and circulating levels of myonectin, respectively, suggestive of a causal link. Indeed, recombinant myonectin administration suppressed starvation-induced autophagy in mouse liver and cultured hepatocytes, as indicated by the inhibition of LC3-dependent autophagosome formation, p62 degradation, and expression of critical autophagy-related genes. Reduction in protein degradation is mediated by the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway; inhibition of this pathway abrogated the ability of myonectin to suppress autophagy in cultured hepatocytes. Together, our results reveal a novel skeletal muscle-liver axis controlling cellular autophagy, underscoring the importance of hormone-mediated tissue cross-talk in maintaining energy homeostasis.

Together, our results reveal a novel skeletal muscle-liver axis controlling cellular autophagy, underscoring the importance of hormone-mediated tissue cross-talk in maintaining energy homeostasis. Autophagy helps recycle intracellular organelles and proteins into their constituent building blocks, serving as potential fuel sources for maintaining cellular homeostasis in times of nutrient deprivation (1Kuma A.

In fact, exercise, a form of nutrient deprivation, triggers autophagic turnover of aged organelles, such as mitochondria, to accommodate renewal of cellular content; this is thought to be the origin of some exercise-related health benefits (3He C. Bassik M.C. Moresi V. Sun K. Wei Y. Zou Z. An Z. Loh J. Fisher J. Sun Q. Korsmeyer S. Packer M. May H.I. Hill J.A. Virgin H.W. Gilpin C. Xiao G. Bassel-Duby R. Scherer P.E. Levine B. Exercise-induced BCL2-regulated autophagy is required for muscle glucose homeostasis.Nature. 2012; 481: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). In contrast, dysregulation of autophagy is linked to diseases like obesity and atherosclerosis (4Yang L. Li P. Fu S. Calay E.S. Hotamisligil G.S.

Global deletion of autophagy genes (e.g. Atg5 (autophagy-related 5) and Atg7) in mice results in perinatal lethality (7Kuma A. Hatano M. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakaya H. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y.

Liver autophagy contributes to the maintenance of blood glucose and amino acid levels.Autophagy. 2011; 7: 727-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This process is needed to maintain energy homeostasis within the first few hours after birth, before neonates have acquired a full capacity for gluconeogenesis (11Girard J. Ferré P. Pégorier J.P.

Regulation of mTORC1 by the Rag GTPases is necessary for neonatal autophagy and survival.Nature. 2013; 493: 679-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Thus, autophagy is essential to normal cellular and organismal functions. One organ in which autophagy has particular importance is the liver. The liver responds dramatically to starvation; up to 40% of its cellular protein content can be degraded via autophagy during prolonged periods of nutrient depravation (13Addis T. Poo L.J. Lew W. The quantities of protein lost by the various organs and tissues of the body during a fast.J. Biol. Chem. 1936; 115: 111-116Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Autophagy in liver is remarkably sensitive to hormonal regulation. Elevated levels of glucagon, a hormone produced in the pancreas, in the fasted state induce autophagy in liver (14Schworer C.M. Mortimore G.E. Glucagon-induced autophagy and proteolysis in rat liver: mediation by selective deprivation of intracellular amino acids.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76: 3169-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Conversely, the anabolic hormone insulin, secreted in response to food intake, and diet-derived amino acids suppress hepatocyte autophagy by activating the nutrient-sensing mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling pathway (15Kanazawa T. Taneike I. Akaishi R. Yoshizawa F. Furuya N. Fujimura S. Kadowaki M. Amino acids and insulin control autophagic proteolysis through different signaling pathways in relation to mTOR in isolated rat hepatocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8452-8459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In diet-induced obese mice that are insulin-resistant, liver autophagy is dysregulated (16Liu H.Y. Han J. Cao S.Y. Hong T. Zhuo D. Shi J. Liu Z. Cao W. Hepatic autophagy is suppressed in the presence of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia: inhibition of FoxO1-dependent expression of key autophagy genes by insulin.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 31484-31492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Suppression of autophagy by insulin also extends to skeletal and cardiac muscles (17Mortimore G.E. Pösö A.R. Intracellular protein catabolism and its control during nutrient deprivation and supply.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1987; 7: 539-564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although insulin and glucagon play an important role in regulating cellular autophagy in the fed and fasted states, respectively, other hormonal signals may also affect this recycling process. We recently described myonectin (also designated as CTRP15) as a nutritionally regulated hormone secreted by skeletal muscle (18Seldin M.M. Peterson J.M. Byerly M.S. Wei Z. Wong G.W.

It belongs to the C1q/TNF-related protein family of secreted proteins known to regulate glucose and fatty acid metabolism (19Wong G.W. Wang J. Hug C. Tsao T.S. Lodish H.F.

A central role for C1q/TNF-related protein 13 (CTRP13) in modulating food intake and body weight.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e62862Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, unlike many C1q/TNF-related proteins that are predominantly expressed by adipose tissue, myonectin is derived primarily from skeletal muscle. Myonectin expression and circulating levels in mice are highly induced by refeeding following an overnight (12-h) fast. Infusion of recombinant myonectin into mice lowers circulating levels of free fatty acids, in part by promoting cellular lipid uptake and up-regulating the expression of genes (Cd36, Fabp, and Fatp) involved in lipid uptake (18Seldin M.M. Peterson J.M. Byerly M.S. Wei Z. Wong G.W. Myonectin (CTRP15), a novel myokine that links skeletal muscle to systemic lipid homeostasis.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 11968-11980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Here, we established the functional significance of myonectin as a novel regulator of autophagy in liver, highlighting its role in mediating skeletal muscle-liver cross-talk to modulate metabolic processes critical to maintaining tissue homeostasis. Mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody and a rabbit polyclonal antibody recognizing LC3B (microtubule-associated protein-1 light chain 3 beta) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Rabbit polyclonal anti-peptide antibody, which can specifically recognize mouse myonectin, has been described previously (18Seldin M.M. Peterson J.M. Byerly M.S. Wei Z. Wong G.W.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies recognizing p62, ULK1 (UNC-51-like kinase 1), phospho-ULK1 (Ser-757), Akt, phospho-Akt (Thr-308), mTOR, phospho-mTOR (Ser-2448), IRS1 (insulin receptor substrate 1), phospho-IRS-1 (Ser-612), FOXO3 (Forkhead box transcription factor O3), phospho-FOXO3 (Thr-24), and β-tubulin were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Rabbit monoclonal antibodies against Atg7 and Atg12 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Akt inhibitor IV was obtained from Millipore (Billerica, MA). The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Eight-week-old male wild-type C57BL/6 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and were housed in polycarbonate cages on a 12-h light/dark photocycle and had ad libitum access to water and standard laboratory chow diet (LabDiet 5001, PMI Nutrition International, St. Louis, MO) throughout the study period. Animals were fasted for 24 h and injected via the tail vein with either 20% (w/v) glucose solution and saline (10 μl/g of body weight; control) or recombinant myonectin (1 μg/g of body weight). Serum and tissues were harvested in the ad libitum state at 10 min or 4 h post-injection as indicated. All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Recombinant full-length mouse myonectin containing a C-terminal FLAG-tagged epitope was produced in mammalian cells as described previously (18Seldin M.M. Peterson J.M. Byerly M.S. Wei Z. Wong G.W. Myonectin (CTRP15), a novel myokine that links skeletal muscle to systemic lipid homeostasis.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 11968-11980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 cells (GripTiteTM, Invitrogen) were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 10% (v/v) FBS (Invitrogen) supplemented with antibiotics. Transfections were performed in HEK293 cells using the calcium phosphate method (28Chen C. Okayama H. High-efficiency transformation of mammalian cells by plasmid DNA.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). At 48 h post-transfection, the medium was replaced with serum-free Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) supplemented with vitamin C (0.1 mg/ml). Supernatants were collected three times every 48 h, pooled, and purified using an anti-FLAG affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Proteins were eluted with 150 μg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma-Aldrich) and dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 8.0) containing 135 mm NaCl in a 10-kDa cutoff Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassette (Pierce). Protein concentration was determined using Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent (Thermo Scientific), and samples were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Liver and muscle samples were immediately harvested from euthanized mice and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Homogenized cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures (Sigma-Aldrich). Protein content was quantified using Coomassie Plus protein reagent. Mouse C2C12 myocytes and rat H4IIE hepatocytes (ATCC) were cultured in 24-well plates and differentiated as described previously (18Seldin M.M. Peterson J.M. Byerly M.S. Wei Z. Wong G.W. Myonectin (CTRP15), a novel myokine that links skeletal muscle to systemic lipid homeostasis.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 11968-11980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). To induce autophagy, cells were placed in autophagy media (DMEM containing 0.1% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) but lacking glucose, l-glutamine, and sodium pyruvate) for 3, 6, 12, or 24 h. To assess the effects of macronutrients on myonectin expression, myotubes were cultured in autophagy medium alone or supplemented with 5 mm glucose (Sigma) and/or a mixture of essential amino acids (Sigma M5550) for 6 h. For all other experiments on hepatocytes, control cells were incubated with DMEM containing 10% FBS. In all cell culture treatments, 5 μg/ml recombinant myonectin was used. Mouse serum was harvested by tail bleed. Samples were separated using Microvette® CB 300 (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. Serum glucagon levels were quantified using a glucagon ELISA kit (Millipore). Total RNAs were isolated from tissues or cell lines using TRIzol® and reverse-transcribed using Superscript II RNase H reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Primer sequences are listed in supplemental Table 1. Quantitative real-time PCR analyses were performed on an Applied Biosystems Prism 7500 sequence detection system (Invitrogen). Samples were analyzed in 25-μl reactions with SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer's directions. Data were normalized to β-actin and expressed as relative mRNA levels using the ΔΔCt method (29Schmittgen T.D. Livak K.J. Analyzing real-time PCR data by the comparative CT method.Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (17278) Google Scholar). Serum samples were diluted 1:20 in SDS loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2% (w/v) SDS, 6% (w/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and separated on NuPAGE 10% Bis-Tris 4The abbreviation used is: Bis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. gels (Invitrogen). Each well was loaded with an equivalent of 1 μl of serum. For H4IIE hepatocytes and mouse liver lysates, 10 μg of protein were loaded and separated on NuPAGE 12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen). Fractionated proteins were then transferred to Protran BA8 nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman), blocked in 2% nonfat milk for 1 h, and probed overnight with primary antibodies. Immunoblots were washed three times (10 min each) with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000; Cell Signaling Technology) for 1 h. Blots were washed three times (10 min each) with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, developed in enhanced chemiluminescent reagent (Amersham Biosciences), and visualized with MultiImage III FluorChem® Q (Alpha Innotech, Santa Clara, CA). Signal intensity quantifications were performed using AlphaView software (Alpha Innotech). 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. Autophagic degradation of long-lived proteins was assessed as described previously (30Ogier-Denis E. Houri J.J. Bauvy C. Codogno P. Guanine nucleotide exchange on heterotrimeric Gi3 protein controls autophagic sequestration in HT-29 cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28593-28600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, H4IIE hepatocytes (∼80% confluence) were incubated for 18 h in complete medium (DMEM containing 5 mm glucose, penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% FBS) supplemented with 0.2 μCi/ml l-[14C]valine (Moravek Biochemicals, Brea, CA). Cells were washed three times with PBS and placed in DMEM (lacking glucose, l-glutamine, and sodium pyruvate but containing 0.1% BSA and 0.5 mm cold valine) supplemented with 10% FBS; vehicle (20 mm HEPES (pH 8) containing 135 mm NaCl); 5 μg/ml myonectin; or myonectin plus LY294002 (50 μm), Akt inhibitor IV (10 μm), or rapamycin (10 ng/ml). Short-lived proteins were degraded within 1 h of incubation, so media were changed at 1 h. Cells were then incubated for an additional 4 h, after which the media were collected. Cells were washed three times with PBS, scraped, and collected. A matched volume containing 10% trichloroacetic acid and 1% phosphotungstic acid was added to cells, which were then centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell media and the acid-soluble cell lysate fraction were combined and placed in a scintillation vial containing 2 ml of Soluene 350 (National Diagnostics). The acid-insoluble fraction was resuspended in PBS and placed in a separate scintillation vial containing 2 ml of Soluene 350. Percent protein degradation was calculated by dividing counts in the medium plus the acid-soluble fraction of the cell lysate by counts in the acid-insoluble fraction of the cell lysate. Comparisons were performed using two-tailed Student's t tests with 95% confidence intervals. Values were considered significant at p < 0.05. All data are presented as means ± S.E. We have previously shown that myonectin expression and circulating levels are highly up-regulated in mice by refeeding after a 12-h fast (18Seldin M.M. Peterson J.M. Byerly M.S. Wei Z. Wong G.W. Myonectin (CTRP15), a novel myokine that links skeletal muscle to systemic lipid homeostasis.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 11968-11980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). However, effects on liver autophagy are observed only after a prolonged 24-h food deprivation (considered starvation in mice) (31Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Matsui M. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. In vivo analysis of autophagy in response to nutrient starvation using transgenic mice expressing a fluorescent autophagosome marker.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1921) Google Scholar). To evaluate changes in myonectin expression during starvation, mice were fed ad libitum or fasted for 24 h and injected with a bolus of glucose or saline. A striking increase in myonectin mRNA (∼10-fold) and circulating protein levels (∼3-fold) was observed when starved mice were given a bolus of glucose compared with a bolus of saline or mice fed ad libitum (Fig. 1, A and B). In accordance, myonectin mRNA expression was markedly reduced in differentiated C2C12 myotubes when cells were subjected to serum deprivation (Fig. 1C), mimicking starvation-induced autophagy (32Mordier S. Deval C. Béchet D. Tassa A. Ferrara M. Leucine limitation induces autophagy and activation of lysosome-dependent proteolysis in C2C12 myotubes through a mammalian target of rapamycin-independent signaling pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29900-29906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To evaluate which macronutrients could prevent the suppression of myonectin expression in nutrient-deprived cells, C2C12 myotubes were incubated in autophagic medium in the presence or absence of 5 mm glucose and/or a mixture of minimal essential amino acids. Glucose or amino acid supplementation was sufficient to inhibit the starvation-induced down-regulation of myonectin expression (Fig. 1D). The effects on myonectin expression were much greater if both glucose and essential amino acids were given to cells, reflecting the additive effects of both nutrients. These results indicate that myonectin expression is repressed by starvation but robustly induced by nutrient (glucose or amino acids) availability in cultured skeletal muscle cells and in mice. Expression of key autophagy genes in mouse liver is altered in response to nutrient deprivation. Atg7 is required for starvation-induced protein degradation in liver (8Komatsu M. Waguri S. Ueno T. Iwata J. Murata S. Tanida I. Ezaki J. Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Uchiyama Y. Kominami E. Tanaka K. Chiba T. Impairment of starvation-induced and constitutive autophagy in Atg7-deficient mice.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar), whereas Atg12 is critical for the formation of autophagosome precursors (33Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. The role of Atg proteins in autophagosome formation.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2011; 27: 107-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar). Time course treatments revealed a strong induction of Atg7 (Fig. 2A) and Atg12 (Fig. 2B) when H4IIE hepatocytes were serum-starved for 3 and 6 h. Addition of recombinant myonectin was sufficient to suppress the induction of Atg genes in response to serum deprivation (Fig. 2, A and B). Changes in the mRNA levels of Atg7 and Atg12 in response to serum starvation and myonectin treatment were confirmed at the protein levels (Fig. 2, C and D). Atg12 conjugates with Atg5, and the Atg12-Atg5 complex facilitates autophagosome formation (34Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. A protein conjugation system essential for autophagy.Nature. 1998; 395: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar, 35Hanada T. Noda N.N. Satomi Y. Ichimura Y. Fujioka Y. Takao T. Inagaki F. Ohsumi Y. The Atg12-Atg5 conjugate has a novel E3-like activity for protein lipidation in autophagy.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37298-37302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar); however, we could not detect the covalently linked complex using the anti-Atg12 antibody. Western blot analysis of Atg12 reflects only the unconjugated form of the protein. To confirm our results in vivo, mice were fasted for 24 h and injected with a bolus of glucose, vehicle, or myonectin (1 μg/g of body weight). Recombinant protein administration resulted in a 4-fold increase in the circulating levels of myonectin 10 min after protein injection compared with saline injection (supplemental Fig. 1). As expected, starved mice injected with vehicle control showed a significant up-regulation of Atg7 and Atg12 levels in mouse liver, and this induction was suppressed when starved mice were given a bolus of glucose or injected with recombinant myonectin (Fig. 2, E and F). These results suggest that myonectin regulates the expression of key autophagy genes in cultured hepatocytes and liver in response to nutrient availability. Furthermore, recombinant myonectin administration did not alter the circulating levels of glucagon, a hormone known to activate liver autophagy in the fasted state (14Schworer C.M. Mortimore G.E. Glucagon-induced autophagy and proteolysis in rat liver: mediation by selective deprivation of intracellular amino acids.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76: 3169-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), at 10 min or 4 h post-injection (supplemental Fig. 2), suggesting that myonectin acts independently of glucagon. Lipidation of LC3 is a critical initial step in autophagy, leading to its subsequent aggregation and autophagosome formation (31Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Matsui M. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y.

Thus, the ratio of non-lipidated to lipidated LC3 and the extent of p62 degradation serve as markers for early and late stages of autophagy, respectively. H4IIE hepatocytes were deprived of serum for 2 h to activate autophagy, as indicated by a marked decrease in the proportion of non-lipidated (indicated by LC3-I) to lipidated (indicated by LC3-II) forms of LC3. Treatment of serum-starved cells with recombinant myonectin alone for 1 h was sufficient to reduce the lipidation of LC3 (Fig. 3A). Myonectin treatment increased the LC3-I/LC3-II ratio by ∼50%, an effect comparable to cells cultured in the presence of serum (Fig. 3B). To confirm that the effects of myonectin on LC3 lipidation were indeed due to a shift in autophagic flux, the same experiments were repeated in the presence of chloroquine (38Klionsky D.J.

In this study, there was strong neuroprotection in mice lacking AQP4 in a model of global cerebral ischemia produced by transient, bilateral carotid artery occlusion (BCAO). Survival and neurological outcome were greatly improved in the AQP4(-/-) vs. AQP4(+/+) mice after occlusion, with large and robust differences in both outbred (CD1) and inbred (C57bl/6) mouse strains without or with mechanical ventilation. Improved survival was also seen in mice lacking the scaffold protein α-syntrophin, which manifest reduced astrocyte water permeability secondary to defective AQP4 plasma membrane targeting. Intracranial pressure elevation and brain water accumulation were much reduced in the AQP4(-/-) vs. AQP4(+/+) mice after carotid artery occlusion, as were blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and neuronal loss. Brain slices from AQP4(-/-) mice showed significantly reduced cell swelling and cytotoxicity in response to oxygen-glucose deprivation, compared with slices from AQP4(+/+) mice. Our findings suggest that the neuroprotective effect of AQP4 deletion in global cerebral ischemia involves reduced astrocyte swelling and brain water accumulation, resulting in reduced BBB disruption, inflammation, and neuron death. AQP4 water transport inhibition may improve survival and neurological outcome after cardiac arrest and in other conditions associated with global cerebral ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W1985905712,"Inhibition of type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) enhances tumor cell sensitivity to ionizing radiation. It is not clear how this effect is mediated, nor whether this approach can be applied effectively in the clinic. We previously showed that IGF-1R depletion delays repair of radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), unlikely to be explained entirely by reduction in homologous recombination (HR) repair. The current study tested the hypothesis that IGF-1R inhibition induces a repair defect that involves non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). IGF-1R inhibitor AZ12253801 blocked cell survival and radiosensitized IGF-1R-overexpressing murine fibroblasts but not isogenic IGF-1R-null cells, supporting specificity for IGF-1R. IGF-1R inhibition enhanced radiosensitivity in DU145, PC3 and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells, comparable to effects of Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated inhibition. AZ12253801-treated DU145 cells showed delayed resolution of γH2AX foci, apparent within 1 h of irradiation and persisting for 24 h. In contrast, IGF-1R inhibition did not influence radiosensitivity or γH2AX focus resolution in LNCaP-LN3 cells, suggesting that radiosensitization tracks with the ability of IGF-1R to influence DSB repair. To differentiate effects on repair from growth and cell-survival responses, we tested AZ12253801 in DU145 cells at sub-SF50 concentrations that had no early (⩽48 h) effects on cell cycle distribution or apoptosis induction. Irradiated cultures contained abnormal mitoses, and after 5 days IGF-1R-inhibited cells showed enhanced radiation-induced polyploidy and nuclear fragmentation, consistent with the consequences of entry into mitosis with incompletely repaired DNA. AZ12253801 radiosensitized DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK)-proficient but not DNA-PK-deficient glioblastoma cells, and did not radiosensitize DNA-PK-inhibited DU145 cells, suggesting that in the context of DSB repair, IGF-1R functions in the same pathway as DNA-PK. Finally, IGF-1R inhibition attenuated repair by both NHEJ and HR in HEK293 reporter assays. These data indicate that IGF-1R influences DSB repair by both major DSB repair pathways, findings that may inform clinical application of this approach."

We found Zaprinast alters the metabolomic profile of mitochondrial intermediates and amino acids in retina and brain. This metabolic effect of Zaprinast does not depend on inhibition of phosphodiesterase activity. By providing 13C-labeled glucose and glutamine as fuels, we found that the metabolic profile of the Zaprinast effect is nearly identical to that of inhibitors of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier.

Moreover, Zaprinast inhibits pyruvate-driven O2 consumption in brain mitochondria and blocks mitochondrial pyruvate carrier in liver mitochondria. Inactivation of the aspartate glutamate carrier in retina does not attenuate the metabolic effect of Zaprinast. Our results show that Zaprinast is a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier activity, and this action causes aspartate to accumulate at the expense of glutamate.

O2 consumption was measured in an Oroboros Oxygraph-2K. The respiration buffer consisted of 150 mm KCl, 10 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4. 25 μl of 5 mg/ml mitochondria was injected into the chamber for each assay. Respiration was measured in response to serial additions of pyruvate/malate, ADP, drug (DMSO, Zaprinast, or UK5099), glutamate/malate, and succinate. The final concentrations of substrates were 100 μm EGTA, 50 μm CaCl2, 1.5 mm pyruvate, 0.5 mm malate, 2.5 mm ADP, 1 mm glutamate/0.5 mm malate, and 5 mm succinate. After the addition of each component, the O2 consumption rate was allowed to stabilize for 4–5 min before the slope was quantified. Mouse liver mitochondria were prepared as described before (25Frezza C. Cipolat S. Scorrano L. Organelle isolation. Functional mitochondria from mouse liver, muscle, and cultured fibroblasts.Nat.

After 1 min, the mitochondria-associated radioactivity was separated from the free medium by transferring the mitochondrial suspension to a 0.4-ml centrifuge tube containing a layer of oil consisting of 1:37.5 n-dodecane:bromododecane (Sigma) and spinning at 12,535 × g for 8 s. The portion of the tube containing the mitochondrial pellet was cut off with a razor blade, placed into a scintillation vial, and then counted for radioactivity (26Sweet I.R. Cook D.L. Lernmark A.

To disrupt them we treated mitochondria with 0.1% Triton and freeze-thawed 5 times. Both membrane-intact and -disrupted mitochondria from separate isolations were incubated with 1 mm [13C3]pyruvate in the buffer used for respiration studies on isolated mitochondria at 30 °C for 10 min. The metabolites were analyzed by GC/MS. To test shuttling of metabolites into and out of mitochondria, we incubated freshly isolated mitochondria with 100 μm EGTA, 1 mm glutamate, 0.5 mm malate, 2.5 mm ADP, 50 μm CaCl2, and 1 mm [13C3]pyruvate in respiration buffer at 30 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation, the mitochondrial pellet and incubation medium were collected for GC/MS analysis. Glucose in the culture medium was measured using an Amplex® Red Glucose/Glucose Oxidase Assay kit (Invitrogen). PDH activity was measured using an NADH cycling assay in the presence of diaphorase to reduce the generated NADH and MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) was as an electron acceptor (27Janke R.

Bioeng. 2010; 107: 566-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Purified PDH protein from pig heart was incubated with 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm l-carnitine, 0.2 mm thiamine pyrophosphate, 0.1 mm CoA, 2.5 mm NAD+, 1 mm MTT, and 1 unit/ml diaphorase in 50 mm HEPES/KOH buffer, pH 7.5, at 30 °C. 5 mm pyruvate was added into the mixture to start the reaction, and the plate was read at 570 nm every 10 s for 10 min. The Δ570-nm with maximum linear rate was used for calculating the enzyme activity. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. The significance of differences between means was determined by unpaired two-tailed t tests or analysis of variance with an appropriate post hoc test. A p value < 0.05 was considered to be significant. We began the experiments with the intention of identifying the metabolomic signature of PDE6 inhibition. We isolated mouse retinas and incubated them with or without Zaprinast in the presence of 5 mm glucose and then extracted metabolites for GC/MS analysis. We then determined the concentration of Zaprinast required to inhibit PDE activity in mouse retinas. The concentration of Zaprinast required to cause accumulation of cGMP in the retina is in the range of 20∼200 μm (supplemental Fig. 1A). We also found large changes in several metabolite levels at 200 μm (Fig. 1A). Glutamate and aspartate had the largest changes: about a 5-fold decrease and increase, respectively. The effects on both glutamate and aspartate were first detectable at 30 min after the addition of Zaprinast, became more apparent at 60 min, and remained constant from 2 to 6 h (supplemental Fig. 1, B and C). We reasoned that the change of these two metabolites might be primarily responsible for the overall change of metabolic profile as aspartate-derived metabolites, malate, methionine, cysteine, and N-acetyl-aspartate increased, whereas glutamate-derived metabolites, glutamine and α-ketoglutarate (αKG), decreased. We considered that glutamate in the retina might decrease because it is released into the medium. However, both glutamate and aspartate were undetectable in the incubation medium. Pyruvate increased by about 2–3-fold in response to Zaprinast in both retina and medium, but lactate did not change (Fig. 1, A and B). Glucose deprivation (22Chertov A.O. Holzhausen L. Kuok I.T. Couron D. Parker E. Linton J.D. Sadilek M. Sweet I.R. Hurley J.B. Roles of glucose in photoreceptor survival.J. Biol.

Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1027-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) causes similar changes of glutamate and aspartate levels in retina and brain slices. Therefore, we tested the effect of Zaprinast on glucose consumption. The retina consumed about 1.2 μmol/h/retina. Zaprinast did not affect the rate of glucose consumption (Fig. 1C). To investigate the relationship between PDE6 inhibition and the metabolic effects of Zaprinast, we compared the concentrations of Zaprinast required to inhibit PDE in the retina with the concentration required to cause glutamate to decrease. We found that Zaprinast increases cGMP at 50 and 100 μm and increases both cGMP and cAMP at 200 μm. This indicates that Zaprinast inhibits PDE6 specifically between 50 and 100 μm, but it inhibits other PDEs at 200 μm (Fig. 2A). Surprisingly, Zaprinast decreased glutamate and increased aspartate at much lower concentrations beginning at 2 μm (Fig. 2B). To test whether cyclic nucleotide-gated channels and Ca2+ are involved in the decrease of glutamate, we used the retina from Cngb1−/− mice in which the rising cGMP could not activate cyclic nucleotide gated channels to cause depolarization and elevation of intracellular free Ca2+ (19Paquet-Durand F. Beck S. Michalakis S. Goldmann T. Huber G. Mühlfriedel R. Trifunovi D. Fischer M.D. Fahl E. Duetsch G. Becirovic E. Wolfrum U. van Veen T. Biel M. Tanimoto N. Seeliger M.W.

Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels.Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2009; 191: 111-136Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Remarkably, Zaprinast decreased glutamate and increased aspartate in Cngb1−/− retina (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, neither of the cell-permeable cGMP analogues 8-Br-cGMP and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cGMP nor inhibitors of Protein kinase G and PKA changed the levels of glutamate and aspartate in the retina (supplemental Fig. 2). These findings suggested that Zaprinast increases aspartate and lowers glutamate by a different mechanism than we expected, i.e. in a PDE6-independent fashion. As further confirmation that the metabolic effects of Zaprinast occur independently of PDE6 inhibition, we applied Zaprinast to the retina from rd1 mice that were 2 months old. The rd1 mutation causes almost all PDE6-expressing photoreceptors to die and disappear by 1 month of age and thus abolishes PDE6 activity. We found that glutamate and aspartate levels in rd1 retina are lower than normal, consistent with photoreceptors being a major source of these amino acids in normal retinas. We also found that Zaprinast potently decreases glutamate and increases aspartate in rd1 retina, suggesting that Zaprinast acted at a site distinct from PDE6 (Fig. 2D). As further confirmation that the effect of Zaprinast on glutamate and aspartate was not through PDE, we evaluated the effect of sildenafil, another PDE5/6 inhibitor. Sildenafil between 0.1–50 μm robustly increased cGMP in WT retina but did not have a significant effect on glutamate or aspartate (Fig. 2, E and F). Taken altogether, these results show unambiguously that the effect of Zaprinast on glutamate and aspartate occurs independently of PDE inhibition. Zaprinast also has been identified as a potent agonist of G protein-coupled receptor 35 (GPR35) (30Taniguchi Y. Tonai-Kachi H. Shinjo K.

GPR35 is expressed predominantly in spleen, immune cells, and gastrointestinal tissues, but expression in eye also has been reported (32Wang J. Simonavicius N. Wu X. Swaminath G. Reagan J. Tian H.

GPR35 as a novel therapeutic target.Front. Endocrinol. 2011; 2: 68Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To test whether GPR35 contributes to the metabolic effect of Zaprinast, we preincubated the retina with a GPR35 antagonist, CID 2745687, for 30 min followed by an additional 30 min of Zaprinast treatment. CID 2745687 did not block the effect of Zaprinast on glutamate and aspartate. Furthermore, the GPR35 agonist, pamoic acid, did not change glutamate or aspartate levels (supplemental Fig. 3). These results show that GPR35 was not responsible for the observed Zaprinast effects. To identify the mechanism behind the metabolic effect of Zaprinast, we incubated the retina with [13C6]glucose for 15 min with/without Zaprinast and then analyzed the isotopomer distributions of the intermediates. Under normal conditions, pyruvate and lactate become fully labeled by glycolysis of [13C6]glucose. Pyruvate loses 1 13C to synthesize acetyl-CoA, and the two-labeled carbons appear in most TCA intermediates in the first round of the TCA cycle (Fig. 3A). In the second cycle citrate gains a total of four labeled carbons, and the rest of the intermediates have either three or four carbons labeled due to the loss of CO2 at one of two different positions (supplemental Fig. 4A). Zaprinast did not change the 13C enrichment in pyruvate and lactate. However, the enrichment of glutamate, aspartate, and TCA intermediates was much lower after Zaprinast treatment (Fig. 3B). Zaprinast increased the concentration of M3 (three labeled carbons) pyruvate but not lactate, and it significantly decreased both enrichment and concentration of the M2 isotopomer of citrate (the form with two labeled carbons from the first cycle), M4 (four labeled carbons from the second cycle), and M5/M6 (after three or more cycles) (Fig. 3, C–E; supplemental Fig. 4B). These results suggest that Zaprinast inhibits the formation of citrate from pyruvate. Accordingly, the downstream intermediates αKG and glutamate had fewer M2 and M3/4 isotopomers in Zaprinast-treated retinas. Zaprinast decreased M2 in both succinate and malate but increased both M2 and M3 in aspartate (Fig. 3, F--J). Zaprinast increased the total amount of labeled aspartate, but it decreased the overall enrichment of aspartate because Zaprinast causes a very large increase in the amount of unlabeled aspartate. Overall, these results indicate that Zaprinast inhibits the incorporation of pyruvate-derived carbons into the TCA cycle. This causes accumulation of oxaloacetate and aspartate. We also noted that the excess oxaloacetate “spills over” into the M3 isotopomers of malate and succinate by the reversible malate dehydrogenase and fumarate hydratase reactions. The decrease of glutamate that occurs with Zaprinast treatment always occurs in parallel with an increase of aspartate. We hypothesized that the increased carbons of aspartate come from oxidation of glutamate through αKG dehydrogenase. To test this hypothesis, we labeled the retina with [13C5]glutamine for 5 min and then replaced it with unlabeled glucose for 10 min (Fig. 4). The short time pulse makes it possible to trace the fate of glutamate as TCA intermediates are labeled in the first cycle and then start to lose the labeled carbons in the second cycle. During the first round of the TCA cycle, glutamate and αKG are fully labeled as M5, and the subsequent intermediates have four 13C carbons. A small amount of M5 citrate also accumulates. This must result from the reve"

The effects of ROS signaling in the cell are diverse and key to cell functions; thus, it remains critical to precisely define the regulation of ROS sources and the species produced. The diverse roles of individual types of ROS are illustrated by the ability of H2O2 to oxidize enzymatic cofactors such as the tetrahydrobiopterin utilized by nitric oxide synthase to produce NO, thus uncoupling the enzyme (2Kuzkaya N. Weissmann N. Harrison D.G. Dikalov S. Interactions of peroxynitrite, tetrahydrobiopterin, ascorbic acid, and thiols: implications for uncoupling endothelial nitric-oxide synthase.J. Biol.

Additionally, O2⨪ and its dismuted metabolite H2O2 oxidize thiols, causing functional alterations in protein structure/function and enhancing growth factor signaling by inactivation of protein phosphatases that subserve normal cell signaling (5Juarez J.C.

Reactivity of biologically important thiol compounds with superoxide and hydrogen peroxide.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). To complicate matters, most mammalian cells abundantly express superoxide dismutase (SOD), which rapidly converts O2⨪ to the relatively stable H2O2 and facilitates the generation of downstream-oxidizing ROS (8McCord J.M.

Excessive stimulation of Noxes often leads to hyperproliferative and migratory phenotypes as well as oxidative stress, resulting in end-organ damage (9Sedeek M. Hébert R.L. Kennedy C.R. Burns K.D.

Increasingly, the roles of individual Nox isoforms are being appreciated as playing highly localized, specific, and temporal roles in disease progression. Indeed, Nox1's localization to smooth muscle caveolae and endosomes could limit Nox1's effect to a specific signaling pathway. Thus, specific inhibitors of Nox1 are likely to facilitate the identification of these links while also serving as a basis for therapy.

The production of ROS by Nox enzymes is achieved through a conserved catalytic mechanism contained within the enzyme's transmembrane domain that causes the transfer of electrons from NADPH to molecular oxygen to form O2⨪ and/or H2O2 (10Lassègue B.

Although this catalytic core is conserved among Nox isoforms, it alone is insufficient for activity in a subclass of Noxes, including Nox1. Indeed, key interactions between Nox1 and its co-activating cytosolic subunits play a major role in activation of this enzyme domain by forming a heterodimeric complex essential for ROS generation (1Al Ghouleh I.

The assembled complex of subunits becomes the functional Nox1 oxidase. The biochemical structure and function of NOXA1 and NOXO1 are largely unknown due to their more recent discovery. That said, p67phox contains an “activation domain” spanning amino acids 190–210 that participates in the catalytic reduction of FAD (16Han C.H. Freeman J.L. Lee T. Motalebi S.A. Lambeth J.D.

This domain shares 50 and 80% homology with corresponding residues 191–211 and 198–208 of NOXA1, respectively (17Ambasta R.K. Schreiber J.G. Janiszewski M. Busse R. Brandes R.P. Noxa1 is a central component of the smooth muscle NADPH oxidase in mice.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 41: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Herein, we provide evidence that residues 195–205 of NOXA1 serve a function similar to that of the activation domain of p67phox and, in turn, hypothesize that this peptide could serve as a viable inhibitor of NOXA1-Nox1 binding and activation. With the knowledge that mutagenesis of a tyrosine for an alanine at residue 199 of NOXA1 reduces Nox1-derived O2⨪ production by >95% (18Maehara Y. Miyano K. Yuzawa S. Akimoto R. Takeya R. Sumimoto H.

In addition, by including amino acids that are homologous (residues 200 to 205) and nonhomologous between NOXA1 and p67phox (residues 195–198), we surmised that the peptide would be rendered specific for the Nox1 oxidase. The peptide representing amino acids 195–205 of NOXA1 with a Y199A substitution is heretofore referred to as NOXA1 docking sequence (NoxA1ds) and was tested for its efficacy as a Nox1 inhibitor (Scheme 1). Tissue distribution of the Noxes is wide and variable with Nox1 being uniquely expressed in the colon epithelium and prevalent in blood vessels (19Suh Y.A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J. Xu X.

Targeted and specific inhibition of Nox1 has long been desired, and yet there remains a dearth of Nox1-specific inhibitors with a validated target and established mechanism. Here, we report that a peptide derived from the activation domain of NOXA1 is an isoform-specific inhibitor of Nox1 and that this peptide not only binds Nox1 but also disrupts its interaction with NOXA1. The current findings elucidate a key domain of NOXA1 as a binding partner for Nox1, shed light on the mechanism of Nox1 oxidase assembly, and provide a useful tool for investigating the role of Nox1 in a variety of cellular processes and pathologies.

NoxA1ds, Nox2dsTAT, and scrambled NoxA1ds were synthesized by the Tufts University Core Facility (Boston). The sequence of human NoxA1ds is as follows: NH3-EPVDALGKAKV-CONH2. The scrambled NoxA1ds sequence (SCRMB) is as follows: NH3-LVKGPDAEKVA-CONH2. In both cases, the NH3 group represents the amino end and CONH2 represents the amide of the C terminus, a consequence of the synthetic procedure. Each peptide was prepared in several batches, with no batch having a purity of less than 90%. FITC-labeled NoxA1ds was also synthesized by Tufts University and is identical in sequence to NoxA1ds with FITC linked to the N terminus of NoxA1ds via an α-hydroxyl acid. Rhodamine-labeled NoxA1ds was synthesized by Fisher and is identical in sequence to NoxA1ds with rhodamine B linked to the N terminus of NoxA1ds via an α-hydroxyl acid.

Plasmids encoding full-length human cDNAs for Nox1-YFP and NoxA1-CFP were custom subclones purchased from OriGene (Rockville, MD). Nox1-YFP was subcloned into the pCMV6-AC-mYFP plasmid, and NOXA1-CFP was subcloned into the pCMV6-AC-mCFP plasmid. Both plasmids placed the fluorophore at the C terminus of the Nox protein sequence. A membrane-targeted CFP with extensive N-terminal myristoylation (CFPm) was kindly provided by Dr. Jean-Pierre Vilardaga (Pittsburgh, PA) (33Vilardaga J.P. Nikolaev V.O. Lorenz K. Ferrandon S.

Plasmids encoding Nox1, NOXO1, NOXA1, Nox1-YFP, NOXA1-CFP, or CFPm were transformed and amplified into Escherichia coli strain TOP10 (Invitrogen). Plasmids were purified using a QIAfilter plasmid purification kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA.). Cell transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine LTX and Plus reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. COS-22 cells were singly or in combination transiently transfected with the above Nox plasmids. Cells were used for experiments 24 h after transfection. Nox1- and Nox2-derived O2⨪ production was measured as described by Csanyi et al. (34Csányi G. Cifuentes-Pagano E. Al Ghouleh I. Ranayhossaini D.J. Egaña L. Lopes L.R. Jackson H.M. Kelley E.E.

Briefly, separate populations of COS-22 cells were transfected with either pcDNA3.1-hNox1 alone (COS-Nox1) or a combination of pcDNA3.1-hNOXO1 and pCMVsport 6-hNOXA1 (COS-NOXO1/A1). Adherent cells were harvested by incubating with 0.05% trypsin/EDTA for 5 min at 37 °C. Following addition of DMEM, 10% FBS to neutralize the trypsin, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and subsequently resuspended at 5 × 107 cells/ml in lysis buffer (8 mm potassium, sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 131 mm NaCl, 340 mm sucrose, 2 mm NaN3, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitor mixture) (35Molshanski-Mor S.

The cells were lysed by freeze/thaw cycles (five cycles) and passed through a 30-gauge needle five times to further lyse the cells and then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove unbroken cells. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 160,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C to yield a membrane-enriched pellet (membrane fraction). The membrane fraction from COS-Nox1 was resuspended in lysis buffer and retained, whereas the COS-NOXO1/A1 cytosolic fraction was retained. O2⨪ generation was measured in oxidase assay buffer (65 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μm FAD, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaN3, and 0.2 mm cytochrome c with added 1000 units/ml catalase to prevent H2O2-mediated oxidation of cytochrome c (35Molshanski-Mor S.

Biol. 2007; 412: 385-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)). The components of the cell-free system were added in the following order: oxidase assay buffer, COS-Nox1 cell membrane fraction (5 × 105 cell eq/well, ∼5 μg of protein/well), and NoxA1ds/SCRMB peptides followed by 10 min incubation on ice, after which COS-NOXO1/A1-containing cytosolic fractions were added (5 × 105 cell eq/well). Plates were placed on an orbital shaker for 5 min at 120 movements/min at room temperature before addition of 180 μm NADPH to initiate O2⨪ production. The production of O2⨪ was calculated from the initial linear rate (over 15 min) of SOD-inhibitable cytochrome c reduction quantified at 550 nm using an extinction coefficient of 21.1 mm−1 cm−1 (Biotek Synergy 4 Hybrid Multi-Mode Microplate Reader). The concentration of NoxA1ds peptide that caused 50% inhibition of O2⨪ production (IC50) in COS-Nox1 cell lysates was calculated by Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). To measure Nox2-derived O2⨪ production, COS-Nox2 cells were separated into membrane and cytosolic fractions as described above. The production of O2⨪ was measured using identical methods with the addition of 130 μm lithium dodecyl sulfate after incubation with NoxA1ds or SCRMB. Measurement of HEK-Nox5 O2⨪ production was determined using methods exactly as described previously with NoxA1ds and SCRMB peptides being added to HEK-Nox5 membrane lysates prior to the addition of calcium (final concentration 20 μm) (13Bánfi B.

Throughout these procedures, extreme care was taken to maintain the lysate at a temperature close to 4 °C. O2⨪ production by peritoneal macrophages was determined after re-plating cells into 96-well white micro-plates (Greiner-Bio One GmbH, Germany) at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well. Cells were preincubated with 10 μm NoxA1ds for 1 h in reduced serum media at 37 °C before addition of 1 μm PMA and 400 μm luminol derivative L-012 for 30 min. Luminescence was quantified over time using a Biotek Synergy 4 Hybrid Multi-Mode Microplate Reader. H2O2 production was quantified in COS-Nox4 cell lysates as described previously (36Nisimoto Y.

Constitutive NADPH-dependent electron transferase activity of the Nox4 dehydrogenase domain.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 2433-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It is important to note that COS-Nox4 cells do not produce O2⨪ (34Csányi G. Cifuentes-Pagano E. Al Ghouleh I. Ranayhossaini D.J. Egaña L. Lopes L.R. Jackson H.M. Kelley E.E. Pagano P.J.

COS-Nox4 and COS-22 cells were suspended to a concentration of 5 × 107 cells/ml in ice-cold disruption buffer (PBS containing 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitor mixture, and 0.1 mm PMSF). The cells were lysed by five freeze/thaw cycles and passed through a 30-gauge needle five times to further lyse the cells. Incubation of COS-Nox4 cell lysate (10 μg/100 μl) with NoxA1ds was performed in assay buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 120 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 25 μm FAD, 0.1 mm Amplex Red, and 0.32 units/ml of HRP) for 15 min at room temperature on an orbital shaker (120 movements/min), before the addition of 36 μm NADPH, to initiate H2O2 production. This relatively low concentration of NADPH was used because it was found that higher concentrations interfered with Amplex Red fluorescence. Fluorescence measurements were made using a Biotek Synergy 4 Hybrid Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (excitation wavelength, 560 nm; emission wavelength, 590 nm). A standard curve of known H2O2 concentrations was developed using the Amplex Red assay (as per the manufacturer's instructions) and was used to quantify H2O2 production in the COS-Nox4 cell-free system. The reaction was monitored at room temperature for 60 min. The emission increase was linear during this interval. The effect of NoxA1ds on Nox4-derived H2O2 production was expressed as percent inhibition of Nox4, which was calculated by designating the amount H2O2 pr"
https://openalex.org/W2145459347,"The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) is a quality control device to ensure accurate chromosome attachment to spindle microtubule for equal segregation of sister chromatid. Aurora B is essential for SAC function by sensing chromosome bi-orientation via spatial regulation of kinetochore substrates. However, it has remained elusive as to how Aurora B couples kinetochore-microtubule attachment to SAC signaling. Here, we show that Hec1 interacts with Mps1 and specifies its kinetochore localization via its calponin homology (CH) domain and N-terminal 80 amino acids. Interestingly, phosphorylation of the Hec1 by Aurora B weakens its interaction with microtubules but promotes Hec1 binding to Mps1. Significantly, the temporal regulation of Hec1 phosphorylation orchestrates kinetochore-microtubule attachment and Mps1 loading to the kinetochore. Persistent expression of phosphomimetic Hec1 mutant induces a hyperactivation of SAC, suggesting that phosphorylation-elicited Hec1 conformational change is used as a switch to orchestrate SAC activation to concurrent destabilization of aberrant kinetochore attachment. Taken together, these results define a novel role for Aurora B-Hec1-Mps1 signaling axis in governing accurate chromosome segregation in mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W2019478137,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric enzyme that senses and governs changes in the cellular energy balance represented by concentrations of AMP, ADP, and ATP. Each of its three chains (α, β, and γ) exists as either two or three subtypes, theoretically allowing up to 12 different forms of the complete enzyme. Tissue specificity in the distribution of AMPK subtypes is believed to underpin a range of biological functions for AMPK, a central regulator of metabolic function and response. It is of particular interest for drug discovery purposes to compare AMPK isoforms that are most prevalent in human liver and muscle with isoforms present in key preclinical species. To complement immunocapture/immunodetection methods, which for AMPK are challenged by sequence similarities and difficulties of obtaining accurate relative quantitation, AMPK was captured from lysates of a range of cells and tissues using the ActivX ATP probe. This chemical probe covalently attaches desthiobiotin to one or more conserved lysyl residues in the ATP-binding sites of protein kinases, including AMPK, while also labeling a wide range of ATP-utilizing proteins. Affinity-based recovery of labeled proteins followed by gel-based fractionation of the captured sample was followed by proteomic characterization of AMPK polypeptides. In agreement with transcript-based analysis and previous indications from immunodetection, the results indicated that the predominant AMPK heterotrimer in human liver is α1β2γ1 but that dog and rat livers mainly contain the α1β1γ1 and α2β1γ1 forms, respectively. Differences were not detected between the AMPK profiles of normal and diabetic human liver tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2028780089,"p53 is an established tumor suppressor that can activate the transcription of multiple target genes. Recent evidence suggests that p53 may contribute to the regulation of cell invasion and migration. In this study, we show that the forkhead box transcription factor FOXF1 is a novel target of the p53 family because FOXF1 is upregulated by p53, TAp73 and TAp63. We show that FOXF1 is induced upon DNA damage in a p53-dependent manner. Furthermore, we identified a response element located within the FOXF1 gene that is responsive to wild-type p53, TAp73β and TAp63γ. The ectopic expression of FOXF1 inhibited cancer cell invasion and migration, whereas the inactivation of FOXF1 stimulated cell invasion and migration. We also show that FOXF1 regulates the transcriptional activity of E-cadherin (CDH1) by acting on its FOXF1 consensus binding site located upstream of the E-cadherin gene. Collectively, our results show that FOXF1 is a p53 family target gene, and our data suggest that FOXF1 and p53 form a portion of a regulatory transcriptional network that appears to have an important role in cancer cell invasion and migration."
https://openalex.org/W2005626767,"Electrical coupling in the brain usually occurs between inhibitory neurons that are anatomically and functionally similar. Here the authors show that the excitability of inhibitory interneurons in the dorsal cochlear nucleus is controlled by electrical synapses with excitatory projection cells. Electrical coupling of inhibitory interneurons can synchronize activity across multiple neurons, thereby enhancing the reliability of inhibition onto principal cell targets. It is unclear whether downstream activity in principal cells controls the excitability of such inhibitory networks. Using paired patch-clamp recordings, we show that excitatory projection neurons (fusiform cells) and inhibitory stellate interneurons of the dorsal cochlear nucleus form an electrically coupled network through gap junctions containing connexin36 (Cxc36, also called Gjd2). Remarkably, stellate cells were more strongly coupled to fusiform cells than to other stellate cells. This heterologous coupling was functionally asymmetric, biasing electrical transmission from the principal cell to the interneuron. Optogenetically activated populations of fusiform cells reliably enhanced interneuron excitability and generated GABAergic inhibition onto the postsynaptic targets of stellate cells, whereas deep afterhyperpolarizations following fusiform cell spike trains potently inhibited stellate cells over several hundred milliseconds. Thus, the excitability of an interneuron network is bidirectionally controlled by distinct epochs of activity in principal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2086216924,"Retinoid X receptors (RXRs) are obligate partners for several other nuclear receptors, and they play a key role in several signaling processes. Despite being a promiscuous heterodimer partner, this nuclear receptor is a target of therapeutic intervention through activation using selective RXR agonists (rexinoids). Agonist binding to RXR initiates a large conformational change in the receptor that allows for coactivator recruitment to its surface and enhanced transcription. Here we reveal the structural and dynamical changes produced when a coactivator peptide binds to the human RXRα ligand binding domain containing two clinically relevant rexinoids, Targretin and 9-cis-UAB30. Our results show that the structural changes are very similar for each rexinoid and similar to those for the pan-agonist 9-cis-retinoic acid. The four structural changes involve key residues on helix 3, helix 4, and helix 11 that move from a solvent-exposed environment to one that interacts extensively with helix 12. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry reveals that the dynamics of helices 3, 11, and 12 are significantly decreased when the two rexinoids are bound to the receptor. When the pan-agonist 9-cis-retinoic acid is bound to the receptor, only the dynamics of helices 3 and 11 are reduced. The four structural changes are conserved in all x-ray structures of the RXR ligand-binding domain in the presence of agonist and coactivator peptide. They serve as hallmarks for how RXR changes conformation and dynamics in the presence of agonist and coactivator to initiate signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1981221499,"CD154 (CD40 ligand) is a type II transmembrane protein that belongs to the tumor necrosis factor superfamily. The soluble form of CD154 (sCD154), which results from the shedding of membrane-bound CD154, plays a key role in the production of proinflammatory cytokines and has been linked to various autoimmune and vascular disorders. Therefore, elucidating the mechanisms by which CD154 is released from the cell surface following its interaction with its various receptors is of primordial importance. Using co-culture experiments, we show that CD154 is shed predominantly upon its engagement with CD40. Indeed, only CD40 (both membrane-bound and soluble) and not α5β1 or αMβ2 is involved in the cleavage and release of CD154 from Jurkat E6.1 T-cells. Interestingly, CD154 is cleaved independently of the formation of cell surface CD40 homodimers and independently of its association into lipid rafts. In contrast, we found that the protein kinase C (PKC) signaling family and the matrix metalloproteinases ADAM10 and ADAM17 are intimately involved in this process. In conclusion, our data indicate that CD154 is released from T-cells by ADAM10 and ADAM17 upon CD40 ligation. These findings add significant insights into the mechanisms by which CD154 is down-regulated and may lead to the generation of novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of CD154-associated disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2045865134,"Chromosomal translocations that juxtapose the androgen-sensitive transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) gene promoter to the oncogenic ETS-family transcription factor ERG result in excessive ERG overexpression in approximately 50% of prostate cancer (PCa) patients. Although numerous studies have investigated ERG-downstream genes, such studies have not attempted to examine miRNAs, which however are emerging to be important regulators of cancer. Through bioinformatics analysis of ChIP-Seq ERG data and miRNA expression profiling data we nominated miR-200c as a direct target of ERG. Experimentation of PCa cells with ERG overexpression or knockdown demonstrated that ERG directly repressed miR-200c expression by physically binding to the erythroblast transformation-specific (ETS) motif within its promoter. Consequently, miR-200c was downregulated in ERG-positive PCa, and miR-200c target gene expression was restored. In addition, the expression pattern of miR-200c target genes predicted ERG status in clinical PCa specimens. Furthermore, miR-200c was found to be important in modulating ZEB1 upregulation by ERG. Most importantly, miR-200c reconstitution fully reversed ERG-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell migration and invasion. Therefore, our study report miR-200c as the first miRNA target of ERG and a critical inhibitor of PCa cell motility. Therapeutic delivery of miR-200c may provide personalized treatment for patients with the molecular subtype of PCa that harbors TMPRSS2–ERG gene fusions."

MSCs have been shown to specifically migrate to inflammatory sites, including tumors, and hold great promise as tumor-specific vectors to deliver antitumor agents. Interferon-α (IFNα) has been used in clinic to treat various types of tumors; however, because of its short half-life, significant therapeutic effects require high doses that often results in serious side effects. Here, we tested whether MSCs continuingly secreting IFNα can exert a persistent antitumor effect and eliminate the side effects associated with high clinical doses of recombinant IFNα. We found that even a small number of IFNα-secreting MSCs could potently halt B16 tumor growth in vivo. The antitumor activity of IFNα-secreting MSCs was largely abolished in immunodeficient mice, an effect largely attributed to natural killer cells and CD8+ T cells. Therefore, IFNα-secreting MSCs provide an innovative strategy for tumor therapy."

Acetylation of the RelA subunit of NF-κB and the subsequent recruitment of bromodomain-containing factor Brd4 are important for the expression of NF-κB target genes in response to various stimuli. However, their contributions to Tax-mediated NF-κB target gene expression and tumorigenesis remain unclear. Here we report that Tax induced the acetylation of lysine 310 of RelA and the binding of Brd4 to acetylated RelA to facilitate Tax-mediated transcriptional activation of NF-κB. Depletion of Brd4 down-regulated Tax-mediated NF-κB target gene expression and cell proliferation. Inhibiting the interaction of Brd4 and acetylated RelA with the bromodomain extraterminal protein inhibitor JQ1 suppressed the proliferation of Tax-expressing rat fibroblasts and Tax-positive HTLV-1-infected cells and Tax-mediated cell transformation and tumorigenesis. Moreover, JQ1 attenuated the Tax-mediated transcriptional activation of NF-κB, triggering the polyubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of constitutively active nuclear RelA. Our results identify Brd4 as a key regulator for Tax-mediated NF-κB gene expression and suggest that targeting epigenetic regulators such as Brd4 with the bromodomain extraterminal protein inhibitor might be a potential therapeutic strategy for cancers and other diseases associated with HTLV-1 infection."
https://openalex.org/W2002588250,"Glucokinase acts as a glucose sensor in pancreatic beta cells. Its posttranslational regulation is important but not yet fully understood. Therefore, a pancreatic islet yeast two-hybrid library was produced and searched for glucokinase-binding proteins. A protein sequence containing a full-length ubiquitin-like domain was identified to interact with glucokinase. Mammalian two-hybrid and fluorescence resonance energy transfer analyses confirmed the interaction between glucokinase and the ubiquitin-like domain in insulin-secreting MIN6 cells and revealed the highest binding affinity at low glucose. Overexpression of parkin, an ubiquitin E3 ligase exhibiting an ubiquitin-like domain with high homology to the identified, diminished insulin secretion in MIN6 cells but had only some effect on glucokinase activity. Overexpression of the elucidated ubiquitin-like domain or midnolin, containing exactly this ubiquitin-like domain, significantly reduced both intrinsic glucokinase activity and glucose-induced insulin secretion. Midnolin has been to date classified as a nucleolar protein regulating mouse development. However, we could not confirm localization of midnolin in nucleoli. Fluorescence microscopy analyses revealed localization of midnolin in nucleus and cytoplasm and co-localization with glucokinase in pancreatic beta cells. In addition we could show that midnolin gene expression in pancreatic islets is up-regulated at low glucose and that the midnolin protein is highly expressed in pancreatic beta cells and also in liver, muscle, and brain of the adult mouse and cell lines of human and rat origin. Thus, the results of our study suggest that midnolin plays a role in cellular signaling of adult tissues and regulates glucokinase enzyme activity in pancreatic beta cells."
https://openalex.org/W2065999955,"We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of a replication-competent oncolytic vaccinia virus, GLV-1h153, carrying human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS), in combination with radioiodine in an orthotopic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) murine model. In vitro viral infection was confirmed by immunoblotting and radioiodine uptake assays. Orthotopic xenografts (MDA-MB-231 cells) received intratumoral injection of GLV-1h153 or PBS. One week after viral injection, xenografts were randomized into 4 treatment groups: GLV-1h153 alone, GLV-1h153 and (131)I (∼ 5 mCi), (131)I alone, or PBS, and followed for tumor growth. Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon tests were performed for statistical analysis. Radiouptake assay showed a 178-fold increase of radioiodine uptake in hNIS-expressing infected cells compared with PBS control. Systemic (131)I-iodide in combination with GLV-1h153 resulted in a 6-fold increase in tumor regression (24 compared to 146 mm(3) for the virus-only treatment group; P<0.05; d 40). We demonstrated that a novel vaccinia virus, GLV-1h153, expresses hNIS, increases the expression of the symporter in TNBC cells, and serves both as a gene marker for noninvasive imaging of virus and as a vehicle for targeted radionuclide therapy with (131)I."
https://openalex.org/W2052298869,"We have determined the structure of the human integrin α1I domain bound to a triple-helical collagen peptide. The structure of the α1I-peptide complex was investigated using data from NMR, small angle x-ray scattering, and size exclusion chromatography that were used to generate and validate a model of the complex using the data-driven docking program, HADDOCK (High Ambiguity Driven Biomolecular Docking). The structure revealed that the α1I domain undergoes a major conformational change upon binding of the collagen peptide. This involves a large movement in the C-terminal helix of the αI domain that has been suggested to be the mechanism by which signals are propagated in the intact integrin receptor. The structure suggests a basis for the different binding selectivity observed for the α1I and α2I domains. Mutational data identify residues that contribute to the conformational change observed. Furthermore, small angle x-ray scattering data suggest that at low collagen peptide concentrations the complex exists in equilibrium between a 1:1 and 2:1 α1I-peptide complex."
https://openalex.org/W2007342561,"Recent studies have demonstrated that in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) several chromatin remodeling enzymes are genetically inactivated. Although, growing evidence in cancer models has demonstrated the importance of epigenetic changes, currently only changes in DNA methylation can be accurately determined from clinical samples. To address this limitation, we have applied formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIREs) combined with next-generation sequencing (FAIRE-seq) to identify specific changes in chromatin accessibility in clinical samples of ccRCC. We modified the FAIRE procedure to allow us to examine chromatin accessibility for small samples of solid tumors. Our FAIRE results were compared with DNA-methylation analysis and show how chromatin accessibility decreases at many sites where DNA-methylation remains unchanged. In addition, our FAIRE-seq analysis allowed us to identify regulatory elements associated with both normal and tumor tissue. We have identified decreases in chromatin accessibility at key ccRCC-linked genes, including PBRM1, SETD2 and MLL2. Overall, our results demonstrate the power of examining multiple aspects of the epigenome."

https://openalex.org/W2068487380,"Tumor drug resistance remains a major challenge in the treatment of cancer. Here, we show that Prostatic secretory protein 94 (PSP94) levels are reduced in ovarian cancer patients with high levels of excision repair cross-complementing 1 (ERCC1), a marker for chemoresistance. We find that PSP94 is decreased in an ovarian cancer drug-resistant cell line, and plays an important role in the development of drug resistance in vitro. Our studies indicate that PSP94 can partially reverse drug resistance in mouse tumor models in vivo and that a PSP94 peptide derivative PCK3145 suppresses chemoresistant cancer cell and tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Our investigation of the involved molecular mechanisms suggests that PSP94 may confer drug resistance by modulating the Lin28b/Let-7 signaling pathway. We introduce PSP94 and its peptide derivative PCK3145 as potential target to reverse chemoresistance in ovarian cancer and have begun to identify their relevant molecular targets in specific signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2052518935,"Choline is a precursor for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine through the CDP-choline pathway. Saccharomyces cerevisiae expresses a single high affinity choline transporter at the plasma membrane, encoded by the HNM1 gene. We show that exposing cells to increasing levels of choline results in two different regulatory mechanisms impacting Hnm1 activity. Initial exposure to choline results in a rapid decrease in Hnm1-mediated transport at the level of transporter activity, whereas chronic exposure results in Hnm1 degradation through an endocytic mechanism that depends on the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5 and the casein kinase 1 redundant pair Yck1/Yck2. We present details of how the choline transporter is a major regulator of phosphatidylcholine synthesis."
