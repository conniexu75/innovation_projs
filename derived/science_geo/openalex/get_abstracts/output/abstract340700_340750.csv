https://openalex.org/W2047516202,"Contemporary in situ tectonic stress indicators along the San Andreas fault system in central California show northeast-directed horizontal compression that is nearly perpendicular to the strike of the fault. Such compression explains recent uplift of the Coast Ranges and the numerous active reverse faults and folds that trend nearly parallel to the San Andreas and that are otherwise unexplainable in terms of strike-slip deformation. Fault-normal crustal compression in central California is proposed to result from the extremely low shear strength of the San Andreas and the slightly convergent relative motion between the Pacific and North American plates. Preliminary in situ stress data from the Cajon Pass scientific drill hole (located 3.6 kilometers northeast of the San Andreas in southern California near San Bernardino, California) are also consistent with a weak fault, as they show no right-lateral shear stress at approximately 2-kilometer depth on planes parallel to the San Andreas fault."
https://openalex.org/W1978371906,"Mussels, clams, and tube worms collected in the vicinity of hydrocarbon seeps on the Louisiana slope contain mostly ""dead"" carbon, indicating that dietary carbon is largely derived from seeping oil and gas. Enzyme assays, elemental sulfur analysis, and carbon dioxide fixation studies demonstrate that vestimentiferan tube worms and three clam species contain intracellular, autotrophic sulfur bacterial symbionts. Carbon isotopic ratios of 246 individual animal tissues were used to differentiate heterotrophic (8(13)C = -14 to -20 per mil), sulfur-based (8(13)C = -30 to -42 per mil), and methane-based (8(13)C = <-40 per mil) energy sources. Mussels with symbiotic methanotrophic bacteria reflect the carbon isotopic composition of the methane source. Isotopically light nitrogen and sulfur confirm the chemoautotrophic nature of the seep animals. Sulfur-based chemosynthetic animals contain isotopically light sulfur, whereas methane-based symbiotic mussels more closely reflect the heavier oceanic sulfate pool. The nitrogen requirement of some seep animals may be supported by nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Some grazing neogastropods have isotopic values characteristic of chemosynthetic animals, suggesting the transfer of carbon into the background deep-sea fauna."

These functions have now been derived from neutron diffraction data on four mixtures of light and heavy water. They will provide a crucial and sensitive test for proposed models of liquid water."
https://openalex.org/W2076491182,X-ray pulsations have been observed in the Crab Nebula at a frequency closely matching the radio and optical pulsations. About 5 percent of the total x-ray power of the nebula appears in the pulsed component. The x-ray pulsations have the form of a main pulse and an interpulse separated by about 12 milliseconds.
https://openalex.org/W1969634077,"The social bee Trigona hypogea uses carrion instead of pollen as a protein source. Nests lack stored pollen, pollen is absent in larval provisions, and corbiculae for pollen transport on worker hind legs are reduced. Glandular secretions of 20 percent protein content appear to replace stored pollen. Toothed mandibles, pheromonal recruitment to resources, and aggressive foraging behavior facilitated evolution of necrophagy in this tropical forest bee lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2066588303,"At a confining pressure of a few kilobars, deformation of many sedimentary rocks, altered mafic rocks, porous volcanic rocks, and sand is ductile, in that instabilities leading to audible elastic shocks are absent. At pressures of 7 to 10 kilobars, however, unstable faulting and stick-slip in certain of these rocks was observed. This high pressure-low temperature instability might be responsible for earthquakes in deeply buried sedimentary or volcanic sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1977385928,"Results obtained from a detailed air-sea-ice climate model for an instantaneous increase in the atmospheric carbon dioxide content are used to estimate the transient surface temperature response for several time-dependent carbon dioxide increase scenarios. The inclusion of realistic variations of land fraction and ocean mixing with latitude is found to limit the applicability of steady- state simulations as approximate guides to the actual time-dependent temperature response, particularly when the regional response is considered."
https://openalex.org/W2054514345,"Laboratory cultures have been established of the didemnid symbiont Prochloron, a unique prokaryotic alga that synthesizes chlorophylls a and b but no phycobilin pigments. Cell division in Prochloron cultures occurs under acidic conditions (pH 5.5) in the presence of tryptophan. The alga is a naturally occurring tryptophan auxotroph that survives in nature by close association with the host, Diplosoma similis. The metabolic dysfunction that renders Prochloron auxotrophic may involve only the initial step of the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2001416910,"Protein targeting in eukaryotic cells is determined by several topogenic signals. Among these are stop-transfer regions, which halt translocation of proteins across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Two different stop-transfer regions were incorporated into precursors for a chloroplast protein, the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. Both chimeric proteins were imported into chloroplasts and did not accumulate in the envelope membranes. Thus, the stop-transfer signals did not function during chloroplast protein import. These observations support the hypothesis that the mechanism for translocation of proteins across the chloroplast envelope is significantly different from that for translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane."

The features are not obvious in conventional aerial photographs, and only one cluster could be recognized on the ground. Soil and pollen analyses reveal that they are prehistoric agricultural plots."
https://openalex.org/W2074701078,"The midday ""sun dagger"" solstice and equinox marker on Fajada Butte in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, is formed by three sandstone slabs that collimate sunlight onto two spiral petroglyphs. The slabs appear to be the result of a natural rockfall and not a construct of the Chacoan Anasazi. Although neither the rockfall nor the petroglyphs can be dated accurately, it is likely that the petroglyphs were designed after the rockfall by people who observed the details of the light pattern for several annual cycles."

https://openalex.org/W2009088940,The results of eight soundings conducted from sites at high latitude during the summers of 1963 through 1965 suggest that a relation exists between the winds at the mesopause and the occurrence of noctilucent clouds. These measurements indicate that situations in which noctilucent clouds are present are associated with lower wind speeds than is the case where there are no clouds.

https://openalex.org/W1965808196,"Physicists working on nuclear fusion in the Soviet Union want to participate in America's next experiment, the Compact Ignition Tokamak (CIT). Soviet scientists first mentioned the idea to Department of Energy (DOE) officials last spring but have not put forth any formal proposal. Department officials, however, say the Soviets are serious about working with the US on the project. From the outset, however, efforts to work more closely with the Soviets on fusion research have been stifled by concerns within the Administration that sensitive Western technology will be transferred to the Soviet Union's military establishment. The key to Soviet participation in CIT may depend on what they can contribute materially, as well as intellectually to the US project. Soviet scientists are currently defining how their country might contribute to the CIT, and they could submit a proposal to the US within a year. Indeed, the technology transfer issue has made DOE and State Department officials reluctant to discuss the possibility of the Soviet Union taking a role in the CIT. They fear that the concept will be rejected on ideological grounds before the merits of a Soviet proposal can be considered."
