https://openalex.org/W2081620485,"Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells can be generated from somatic cells by the introduction of Oct3/4 (also known as Pou5f1), Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc, in mouse and in human. The efficiency of this process, however, is low. Pluripotency can be induced without c-Myc, but with even lower efficiency. A p53 (also known as TP53 in humans and Trp53 in mice) short-interfering RNA (siRNA) was recently shown to promote human iPS cell generation, but the specificity and mechanisms remain to be determined. Here we report that up to 10% of transduced mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking p53 became iPS cells, even without the Myc retrovirus. The p53 deletion also promoted the induction of integration-free mouse iPS cells with plasmid transfection. Furthermore, in the p53-null background, iPS cells were generated from terminally differentiated T lymphocytes. The suppression of p53 also increased the efficiency of human iPS cell generation. DNA microarray analyses identified 34 p53-regulated genes that are common in mouse and human fibroblasts. Functional analyses of these genes demonstrate that the p53-p21 pathway serves as a barrier not only in tumorigenicity, but also in iPS cell generation."
https://openalex.org/W2070672434,"Reprogramming somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells has been accomplished by expressing pluripotency factors and oncogenes, but the low frequency and tendency to induce malignant transformation compromise the clinical utility of this powerful approach. We address both issues by investigating the mechanisms limiting reprogramming efficiency in somatic cells. Here we show that reprogramming factors can activate the p53 (also known as Trp53 in mice, TP53 in humans) pathway. Reducing signalling to p53 by expressing a mutated version of one of its negative regulators, by deleting or knocking down p53 or its target gene, p21 (also known as Cdkn1a), or by antagonizing reprogramming-induced apoptosis in mouse fibroblasts increases reprogramming efficiency. Notably, decreasing p53 protein levels enabled fibroblasts to give rise to iPS cells capable of generating germline-transmitting chimaeric mice using only Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1) and Sox2. Furthermore, silencing of p53 significantly increased the reprogramming efficiency of human somatic cells. These results provide insights into reprogramming mechanisms and suggest new routes to more efficient reprogramming while minimizing the use of oncogenes."
https://openalex.org/W2111920812,"The reprogramming of differentiated cells to pluripotent cells (induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells) is known to be an inefficient process. We recently reported that cells with short telomeres cannot be reprogrammed to iPS cells despite their normal proliferation rates, probably reflecting the existence of 'reprogramming barriers' that abort the reprogramming of cells with uncapped telomeres. Here we show that p53 (also known as Trp53 in mice and TP53 in humans) is critically involved in preventing the reprogramming of cells carrying various types of DNA damage, including short telomeres, DNA repair deficiencies, or exogenously inflicted DNA damage. Reprogramming in the presence of pre-existing, but tolerated, DNA damage is aborted by the activation of a DNA damage response and p53-dependent apoptosis. Abrogation of p53 allows efficient reprogramming in the face of DNA damage and the generation of iPS cells carrying persistent DNA damage and chromosomal aberrations. These observations indicate that during reprogramming cells increase their intolerance to different types of DNA damage and that p53 is critical in preventing the generation of human and mouse pluripotent cells from suboptimal parental cells."

https://openalex.org/W2076047032,"The mechanisms involved in the reprogramming of differentiated cells into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells by the three transcription factors Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1), Klf4 and Sox2 remain poorly understood. The Ink4/Arf locus comprises the Cdkn2a-Cdkn2b genes encoding three potent tumour suppressors, namely p16(Ink4a), p19(Arf) and p15(Ink4b), which are basally expressed in differentiated cells and upregulated by aberrant mitogenic signals. Here we show that the locus is completely silenced in iPS cells, as well as in embryonic stem (ES) cells, acquiring the epigenetic marks of a bivalent chromatin domain, and retaining the ability to be reactivated after differentiation. Cell culture conditions during reprogramming enhance the expression of the Ink4/Arf locus, further highlighting the importance of silencing the locus to allow proliferation and reprogramming. Indeed, the three factors together repress the Ink4/Arf locus soon after their expression and concomitant with the appearance of the first molecular markers of 'stemness'. This downregulation also occurs in cells carrying the oncoprotein large-T, which functionally inactivates the pathways regulated by the Ink4/Arf locus, thus indicating that the silencing of the locus is intrinsic to reprogramming and not the result of a selective process. Genetic inhibition of the Ink4/Arf locus has a profound positive effect on the efficiency of iPS cell generation, increasing both the kinetics of reprogramming and the number of emerging iPS cell colonies. In murine cells, Arf, rather than Ink4a, is the main barrier to reprogramming by activation of p53 (encoded by Trp53) and p21 (encoded by Cdkn1a); whereas, in human fibroblasts, INK4a is more important than ARF. Furthermore, organismal ageing upregulates the Ink4/Arf locus and, accordingly, reprogramming is less efficient in cells from old organisms, but this defect can be rescued by inhibiting the locus with a short hairpin RNA. All together, we conclude that the silencing of Ink4/Arf locus is rate-limiting for reprogramming, and its transient inhibition may significantly improve the generation of iPS cells."
https://openalex.org/W2142744987,"The overexpression of defined transcription factors in somatic cells results in their reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. The extremely low efficiency and slow kinetics of in vitro reprogramming suggest that further rare events are required to generate iPS cells. The nature and identity of these events, however, remain elusive. We noticed that the reprogramming potential of primary murine fibroblasts into iPS cells decreases after serial passaging and the concomitant onset of senescence. Consistent with the notion that loss of replicative potential provides a barrier for reprogramming, here we show that cells with low endogenous p19(Arf) (encoded by the Ink4a/Arf locus, also known as Cdkn2a locus) protein levels and immortal fibroblasts deficient in components of the Arf-Trp53 pathway yield iPS cell colonies with up to threefold faster kinetics and at a significantly higher efficiency than wild-type cells, endowing almost every somatic cell with the potential to form iPS cells. Notably, the acute genetic ablation of Trp53 (also known as p53) in cellular subpopulations that normally fail to reprogram rescues their ability to produce iPS cells. Our results show that the acquisition of immortality is a crucial and rate-limiting step towards the establishment of a pluripotent state in somatic cells and underscore the similarities between induced pluripotency and tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2030692069,"Recent advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies have enabled order-of-magnitude improvements in both cost and throughput. Here we report the use of single-molecule methods to sequence an individual human genome. We aligned billions of 24- to 70-bp reads (32 bp average) to approximately 90% of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) reference genome, with 28x average coverage. Our results were obtained on one sequencing instrument by a single operator with four data collection runs. Single-molecule sequencing enabled analysis of human genomic information without the need for cloning, amplification or ligation. We determined approximately 2.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a false-positive rate of less than 1% as validated by Sanger sequencing and 99.8% concordance with SNP genotyping arrays. We identified 752 regions of copy number variation by analyzing coverage depth alone and validated 27 of these using digital PCR. This milestone should allow widespread application of genome sequencing to many aspects of genetics and human health, including personal genomics."
https://openalex.org/W2100465572,"The reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells upon overexpression of the transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and cMyc is inefficient. It has been assumed that the somatic differentiation state provides a barrier for efficient reprogramming; however, direct evidence for this notion is lacking. Here, we tested the potential of mouse hematopoietic cells at different stages of differentiation to be reprogrammed into iPS cells. We show that hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells give rise to iPS cells up to 300 times more efficiently than terminally differentiated B and T cells do, yielding reprogramming efficiencies of up to 28%. Our data provide evidence that the differentiation stage of the starting cell has a critical influence on the efficiency of reprogramming into iPS cells. Moreover, we identify hematopoietic progenitors as an attractive cell type for applications of iPS cell technology in research and therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2164962782,"Cells in a primate face area are sensitive to both specific face parts and the presence of the whole, upright face reports an electrophysiology study in monkeys. Cells in the middle face patch detected distinct constellations of face parts, but their tuning amplitude was modulated by the presence of a whole, upright face. The ability of primates to effortlessly recognize faces has been attributed to the existence of specialized face areas. One such area, the macaque middle face patch, consists almost entirely of cells that are selective for faces, but the principles by which these cells analyze faces are unknown. We found that middle face patch neurons detect and differentiate faces using a strategy that is both part based and holistic. Cells detected distinct constellations of face parts. Furthermore, cells were tuned to the geometry of facial features. Tuning was most often ramp-shaped, with a one-to-one mapping of feature magnitude to firing rate. Tuning amplitude depended on the presence of a whole, upright face and features were interpreted according to their position in a whole, upright face. Thus, cells in the middle face patch encode axes of a face space specialized for whole, upright faces."
https://openalex.org/W2114339744,"Phosphotidylinositol (PtdIns) signaling is tightly regulated both spatially and temporally by subcellularly localized PtdIns kinases and phosphatases that dynamically alter downstream signaling events. Joubert syndrome is characterized by a specific midbrain-hindbrain malformation ('molar tooth sign'), variably associated retinal dystrophy, nephronophthisis, liver fibrosis and polydactyly and is included in the newly emerging group of 'ciliopathies'. In individuals with Joubert disease genetically linked to JBTS1, we identified mutations in the INPP5E gene, encoding inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase E, which hydrolyzes the 5-phosphate of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(4,5)P2. Mutations clustered in the phosphatase domain and impaired 5-phosphatase activity, resulting in altered cellular PtdIns ratios. INPP5E localized to cilia in major organs affected by Joubert syndrome, and mutations promoted premature destabilization of cilia in response to stimulation. These data link PtdIns signaling to the primary cilium, a cellular structure that is becoming increasingly recognized for its role in mediating cell signals and neuronal function."
https://openalex.org/W2037626596,"Although endogenous inhibitors of blood vessel growth have been studied extensively, specific inhibitors of lymphatic vessel growth have not been identified. Albuquerque et al. now identify truncated, secreted versions of mouse and human VEGFR-2 receptors generated by alternative splicing. The mouse protein acts as an endogenous inhibitor of lymphatic vessel growth in the cornea and skin, and its administration had therapeutic effects in mouse models of corneal injury and transplantation. Disruption of the precise balance of positive and negative molecular regulators of blood and lymphatic vessel growth can lead to myriad diseases. Although dozens of natural inhibitors of hemangiogenesis have been identified, an endogenous selective inhibitor of lymphatic vessel growth has not to our knowledge been previously described. We report the existence of a splice variant of the gene encoding vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (Vegfr-2) that encodes a secreted form of the protein, designated soluble Vegfr-2 (sVegfr-2), that inhibits developmental and reparative lymphangiogenesis by blocking Vegf-c function. Tissue-specific loss of sVegfr-2 in mice induced, at birth, spontaneous lymphatic invasion of the normally alymphatic cornea and hyperplasia of skin lymphatics without affecting blood vasculature. Administration of sVegfr-2 inhibited lymphangiogenesis but not hemangiogenesis induced by corneal suture injury or transplantation, enhanced corneal allograft survival and suppressed lymphangioma cellular proliferation. Naturally occurring sVegfr-2 thus acts as a molecular uncoupler of blood and lymphatic vessels; modulation of sVegfr-2 might have therapeutic effects in treating lymphatic vascular malformations, transplantation rejection and, potentially, tumor lymphangiogenesis and lymphedema ( pages 993–994 )"

Here we characterize a second DWM-linked locus on 6p25.3, showing that deletions or duplications encompassing FOXC1 are associated with cerebellar and posterior fossa malformations including cerebellar vermis hypoplasia (CVH), mega-cisterna magna (MCM) and DWM. Foxc1-null mice have embryonic abnormalities of the rhombic lip due to loss of mesenchyme-secreted signaling molecules with subsequent loss of Atoh1 expression in vermis. Foxc1 homozygous hypomorphs have CVH with medial fusion and foliation defects. Human FOXC1 heterozygous mutations are known to affect eye development, causing a spectrum of glaucoma-associated anomalies (Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, ARS; MIM no. 601631). We report the first brain imaging data from humans with FOXC1 mutations and show that these individuals also have CVH. We conclude that alteration of FOXC1 function alone causes CVH and contributes to MCM and DWM. Our results highlight a previously unrecognized role for mesenchyme-neuroepithelium interactions in the mid-hindbrain during early embryogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2104112974,"Efficiency, defined as the amount of work produced for a given amount of oxygen consumed, is a key determinant of endurance capacity, and can be altered by metabolic substrate supply, in that fatty acid oxidation is less efficient than glucose oxidation. It is unclear, however, whether consumption of a high-fat diet would be detrimental or beneficial for endurance capacity, due to purported glycogen-sparing properties. In addition, a high-fat diet over several months leads to cognitive impairment. Here, we tested the hypothesis that short-term ingestion of a high-fat diet (55% kcal from fat) would impair exercise capacity and cognitive function in rats, compared with a control chow diet (7.5% kcal from fat) via mitochondrial uncoupling and energy deprivation. We found that rats ran 35% less far on a treadmill and showed cognitive impairment in a maze test with 9 d of high-fat feeding, with respiratory uncoupling in skeletal muscle mitochondria, associated with increased uncoupling protein (UCP3) levels. Our results suggest that high-fat feeding, even over short periods of time, alters skeletal muscle UCP3 expression, affecting energy production and physical performance. Optimization of nutrition to maximize the efficiency of mitochondrial ATP production could improve energetics in athletes and patients with metabolic abnormalities."

https://openalex.org/W2091894244,"Abscisic acid (ABA) is a plant hormone regulating fundamental physiological functions in plants, such as response to abiotic stress. Recently, ABA was shown to be produced and released by human granulocytes, by insulin-producing rat insulinoma cells, and by human and murine pancreatic β cells. ABA autocrinally stimulates the functional activities specific for each cell type through a receptor-operated signal transduction pathway, sequentially involving a pertussis toxin-sensitive receptor/G-protein complex, cAMP, CD38-produced cADP-ribose and intracellular calcium. Here we show that the lanthionine synthetase C-like protein LANCL2 is required for ABA binding on the membrane of human granulocytes and that LANCL2 is necessary for transduction of the ABA signal into the cell-specific functional responses in granulocytes and in rat insulinoma cells.

Although the ABA biosynthetic pathway in plants and in fungi has been largely detailed, identification of the components of the ABA signaling pathway, particularly of the ABA receptor(s), has remained elusive. Two ABA-binding proteins have been identified in different plant tissues: the chloroplast Mg-chelatase subunit H (2Shen Y.Y. Wang X.F. Wu F.Q. Du S.Y. Cao Z. Shang Y. Wang X.L. Peng C.C. Yu X.C.

Yue Y. Li B. Nie Y. Li W. Wu W.H. Ma L. Science. 2007; 315: 1712-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), although the role of GCR2 in the control of seed germination is still controversial (4Gao Y. Zeng Q. Guo J. Cheng J.

Biophys. Chem. 2008; 133: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The Mg-chelatase subunit H was proposed as an intracellular ABA receptor, whereas GCR2 is a plasmamembrane protein, which interacts with the only Gα subunit (GPA 1) present in Arabidopsis (3Liu X. Yue Y. Li B. Nie Y. Li W. Wu W.H. Ma L. Science. 2007; 315: 1712-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Although the Mg-chelatase subunit H does not show any significant homology with mammalian proteins, GCR2 shares a high amino acid identity with the mammalian peptide-modifying lanthionine synthetase C-like protein (LANCL) family (7Johnston C.A.

The fact that lantibiotics are not produced in animals suggests that LANCL proteins have a different function than prokaryotic lanthionine synthetase component C proteins. The human genome contains three LANCL genes, LANCL1, LANCL2, and LANCL3, located on chromosomes 2 and 7 and the X chromosome, respectively (11Mayer H. Bauer H. Prohaska R. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 2001; 93: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 12Katoh M. Katoh M. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 12: 399-404PubMed Google Scholar). LANCL1 was the first member of the family to be isolated from human erythrocyte membranes (13Mayer H. Salzer U. Breuss J. Ziegler S. Marchler-Bauer A. Prohaska R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1395: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The LANCL2 mRNA was identified in a screening procedure for genes whose down-regulation resulted in anticancer drug resistance; thus, LANCL2 was also called testis-specific Adriamicin sensitivity protein (14Park S. James C.D. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 723-727PubMed Google Scholar). The structural assignment for the human LANCL proteins remains controversial. Based on the presence of seven putative transmembrane domains, LANCL1 and -2 were originally described as new G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR69A and GPR69B, respectively); however, subsequent studies performed on human epithelial cells overexpressing LANCL1 or LANCL2 fused to the green fluorescent protein (LANCL1-GFP and LANCL2-GFP) showed that LANCL1-GFP is mainly found in the cytosol and in the nucleus, whereas LANCL2-GFP is associated with the plasmamembrane through N-terminal myristoylation (15Landlinger C. Salzer U. Prohaska R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1758: 1759-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Similarly, the debate over the structurally related GCR2 is still open (3Liu X. Yue Y.

ABA has recently been demonstrated to be an endogenous pro-inflammatory hormone in human granulocytes, stimulating several cell functions (phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide production, chemotaxis, and chemokinesis) through a pathway involving a pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G-protein/receptor complex located on the plasmamembrane, cAMP overproduction, protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of the human ADP-ribosyl cyclase CD38, and consequent cADP-ribose (cADPR) generation, leading to an increase of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration (16Bruzzone S.

Cells were maintained in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Transient transfection of human granulocytes, INS-1, and RIN-m cells was performed using the Nucleofector System (Amaxa GmbH, Cologne, Germany). Freshly isolated granulocytes (20 × 106 cells) were transfected using the Nucleofector program X-005, without (control), with 2 μm LANCL2-targeting StealthTM duplex short interference RNA (siRNA#1, #2 or #3) or with 2 μm StealthTM Negative Control (negative control), as described (26Moreschi I.

After transfection, granulocytes were resuspended in 2.5 ml of RPMI supplemented with fetal calf serum (10%), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) and incubated in a 5% CO2 at 37 °C. All experiments were performed 24 h after transfection. RIN-m and INS-1 cells were grown to 50–75% confluence. Cells were trypsinized and 5 × 106 cells were electroporated with 1 μm LANCL2-targeting StealthTM duplex siRNA, using the Amaxa Nucleofector, program T20, solution T or V for INS-1 or RIN-m cells, respectively. To exclude nonspecific knockdown, cells were also transfected with StealthTM Negative Control (negative control). All experiments were performed 48 h after transfection. The LANCL2-targeting StealthTM siRNAs for human LANCL2 (siRNA#1, LANCL2-HSS125242; siRNA#2, LANCL2- HSS125243; and siRNA#3, LANCL2-HSS125244) and for rat LANCL2 (siRNA, NM_001014187_stealth_208) were obtained from Invitrogen (Milan, Italy); the negative control siRNA for transfection of human (cat. no. 12935-300), or of rat cells (NM_001014187_stealth_control_208), were also from Invitrogen. Twenty-four hours after transfection, [Ca2+]i measurements were performed on Fura2/AM-loaded granulocytes or rat insulinoma cells (control, negative control siRNA, and LANCL2 siRNA) seeded on 20-mm glass coverslips, as described in a previous study (16Bruzzone S. Moreschi I. Usai C. Guida L. Damonte G. Salis A. Scarfì S. Millo E. De Flora A. Zocchi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 5759-5764Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). After transfection, CD38+ and CD38− HeLa transfected with the control or with the LANCL2 plasmid were seeded on 20-mm glass coverslips, and [Ca2+]i determinations were performed after 24 h, as described in a previous study (25Zocchi E.

Twenty- four hours after transfection, granulocytes (control, negative control, and siRNA) were resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS, 25 × 106/ml), preincubated for 5 min at 25 °C in the presence of 10 μm 4-(3-butoxy-4-methoxybenzyl)imidazolidin-2-one (Ro 20-1724), a cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, and then challenged with 10 μm ABA. At 0 and 60 s, a 300-μl aliquot of the suspension was withdrawn, and incubations were stopped by adding perchloric acid (PCA) to a final concentration of 0.6 m, at 4 °C. The PCA was removed as described in a previous study (27Bruzzone S. De Flora A. Usai C. Graeff R. Lee H.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Intracellular cAMP levels were determined by radioimmunoassay (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's protocol. For measurement of the [cAMP]i in CD38+/LANCL2+ HeLa, cells (1.5 × 106/determination in a total volume of 0.7 ml of HBSS) were preincubated for 10 min at 25 °C with 10 μm Ro 20-1724, the supernatant was removed, and 0.7 ml of HBSS with or without 100 nm ABA was added; after 0.5 and 1 min the incubation was stopped with PCA (0.6 m final concentration). The cell extracts were recovered and processed as described above. For measurement of the [IP3]i, CD38+ and CD38+/LANCL2+ HeLa or granulocytes were transfected with the pcDNAI/Gαq/i plasmid. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the HeLa cell supernatant was removed and 0.7 ml of HBSS with or without ABA was added to the adherent cells (1 × 106/determination); granulocytes were centrifuged, resuspended in HBSS, and stimulated with 10 μm ABA (6 × 106/determination); and then incubations were stopped with PCA (0.6 m final concentration) after 10, 30, and 60 s. The cell extracts were recovered, PCA was removed, and intracellular IP3 levels were determined by radioimmunoassay (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The protein content of each sample was measured (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) on the protein precipitate solubilized with 1 n NaOH. The full-length LANCL2 cDNA was amplified by PCR using cDNA obtained with reverse transcription of total RNA from human granulocytes (purified as described before) and using the following primers: 5′-CACCATGGGCGAGACCATGTCAAAG-AG-3′ (foward) and 5′-TTAATCCCTCTTCGAAGAGTCAAGT-3′ (reverse). The PCR was performed in 25 μl containing 1× reaction buffer, 200 μm dNTP, 5 pmol of primers, and using 1.25 units of Herculase HotStart DNA polymerase. The PCR reaction profile was 1 cycle at 94 °C for 2 min, 35 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s, 62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min with a final extension for 5 min at 72 °C. The PCR product was purified with a Nucleospin® Extract Kit (Macherey-Nagel) and cloned into pcDNA6.2/V5/ GW/D-TOPO©. This vector allows the synthesis of the recombinant protein as a C-terminal fusion to the V5 epitope. The LANCL2 plasmid was purified using PureLinkTM HiPure Plasmid Filter Kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced by TibMolbiol (Genova, Italy). The pCS2+/α-transducin plasmid (Addgene plasmide 16681) was purchased from Addgene Inc. (Cambridge, MA). The plasmid pcDNAI/Gαq/i and the corresponding empty vector were kindly provided by Dr. R. A. Nicholas (Chapel Hill, NC). Human granulocytes or CD38+ and CD38− HeLa, were transfected in parallel with pcDNA6.2/V5/GW/D-TOPO© (empty, control plasmid) and with LANCL2-pcDNA6.2/V5/ GW/D-TOPO© (LANCL2 plasmid). Moreover, granulocytes, CD38+, and CD38+/LANCL2+ HeLa cells were also transfected with pCS2+/α-transducin or with pcDNAI/Gαq/i plasmids. Human granulocytes were transfected using the Nucleofector System as described above; HeLa were transfected with Nucleofector System (Cell Line Nucleofector Kit R, program I-013). LANCL2 protein expression was determined by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody against the V5 epitope (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours after transfection with the plasmid, granulocytes and HeLa were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8) in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture for mammalian cells (Sigma). Homogenates were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with an orbital rotator and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration of the supernatants was determined by a DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). After SDS-PAGE, performed according to the standard method on 10% gels, the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked for 1 h with PBS-0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) containing 5% nonfat dry milk and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Anti-V5 mouse monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen). After washing with PBST, the membrane was incubated with an anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and developed with ImmobilonTM Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore), following the manufacturer's instructions. Blots were also probed with a primary goat anti-actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a secondary anti-goat IgG-HRP antibody. Total RNA was extracted from human granulocytes, HeLa, INS-1, or RIN-m using the RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and reverse transcribed into cDNA using the iScriptTM cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). The cDNA was used as template for real-time PCR analysis: reactions were performed in an iQ5 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). The human- and rat-specific primers were designed by using Beacon Designer 2.0 software (Bio-Rad), and their sequences were as shown in Table 1.TABLE 1Human- and rat-specific primers used in real-time PCRSequence, 5′–3′Human genesLANCL1ForwardTCTCACAACGCTTGACCAATAAGReverseGCCCAGCCAGTGTAACCGLANCL2ForwardAGGCGTACAAGGTCTTTAAGGAGReverseGCTCGGTAGAGGTACTTCTTATCCLANCL3ForwardGCTCTGTGTGCCGTCTGCReverseCTCCTGGGCGAGTTTCTGCGAPDHForwardCCTGTTCGACAGTCAGCCGReverseCGACCAAATCCGTTGACTCCHPRT-1ForwardGGTCAGGCAGTATAATCCAAAGReverseTTCATTATAGTCAAGGGCATATCCRat genesLANCL2ForwardGGTGCCACGGTGCTCCAGReverseCCTCGCTGCCAAATCACATCACGAPDHForwardATGATTCTACCCACGGCAAGReverseCTGGAAGATGGTGATGGGTTβ-ActinForwardGGGAAATCGTGCGTGACATTReverseGCGGCAGTGGCCATCTC Open table in a new tab Each sample was assayed in triplicate in a 25-μl amplification reaction, containing 4 ng of cDNA, primers mixture (0.4 μm each of sense and antisense primers), and 12.5 μl of 2× iQ SYBR Green Supermix Sample (Bio-Rad). The amplification program included 40 cycles of two steps, each comprising heating to 95 °C and to 62 °C, respectively. Fluorescence products were detected at the last step of each cycle. To verify the purity of the products, a melting curve was produced after each run. Values for human genes were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase-1 mRNA expression, and values for rat genes to GAPDH and β-actin. Statistical analysis of the quantitative real-time PCR was obtained using the iQ5 Optical System Software version 1.0 (Bio-Rad) based on the 2−ΔΔCt method, which calculated relative changes in gene expression of the target normalized to GAPDH and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase-1. The quantitative PCR efficiencies were determined by series of 5-fold dilutions for each experiment and each gene, and were always between 90 and 95%. The relative expression of two genes in the same sample was estimated (29Ståhlberg A. Zoric N. Aman P. Kubista M. Expert. Rev. Mol. Diagn. 2005; 5: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Absolute quantification of cDNA copy number was achieved using a standard curve constructed from known amounts of DNA amplicons of the relative target, after purification with QIAquick® gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and absorbance determination (30Rutledge R.G. Côté C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following siRNA transfection, RIN-m and INS-1 cells were seeded in a 24 well-plate (105 cells/well). After 48 h, the culture medium was replaced, and cells were incubated for 4 h in the low glucose buffer (LG-KRH: 129 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaHCO3, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 10 mm Hepes, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 2 mm glucose). The buffer was then removed, and cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with fresh LG or high glucose buffer (HG-KRH: same as LG-KRH, mixed with glucose to 20 mm final concentration), in the presence or absence of ABA. The buffer was recovered, centrifuged at 5000 × g for 1 min, and insulin concentration was determined by EIA (Rat Insulin Enzyme Immunoassay Kit, SPI-BIO, Montigny Le Bretonneux, France), following the manufacturer's instruction. CD38+ HeLa were transfected in parallel with the empty plasmid or with the LANCL2 plasmid, as described above. After 24 h, cells were resuspended in HBSS (5 × 106/ml). Ectocellular GDP-ribosyl cyclase activity was measured on nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide, an NAD+ analogue used to determine cyclase activity, because cGDPR is not a substrate of the hydrolase (31Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Fryxell K. Branton W.D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30260-30267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide was added at a final concentration of 0.4 mm with or without 100 nm ABA. Enzymatic activities were carried out at 37 °C: at various times from the addition of the substrate (0, 5, 15, and 30 min), 100-μl aliquots were withdrawn and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 15 s (supernatants were recovered and deproteinized with 2.5% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid). High-performance liquid chromatography analyses of nucleotides to measure the production of cGDPR were performed as described (32Guida L. Franco L. Zocchi E. De Flora A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Protein determination (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) was performed on aliquots of each incubation saved prior to trichloroacetic acid addition. Granulocytes were resuspended at 107/ml in chemotaxis buffer (HBSS, PBS, and 0.5% albumin, 39:16:1). Chemotaxis and chemokinesis assays were performed using 96-well ChemoTx system microplates (Neuro Probe, Gaithersburg, MD) with a 3-μm pore size polycarbonate filter. For chemotaxis assays, ABA was diluted to 10 μm in chemotaxis buffer and added to the bottom wells. For chemokinesis assays, cells were preincubated for 15 min in the presence or absence of 10 μm ABA; chemotaxis buffer was added in the bottom wells. Cell suspensions (25 μl) were placed directly on top of the filter, and the plates were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. The transmigrated cells were collected following ChemoTx system instructions, transferred into a 96-well plate, and quantified by adding 60 μl of a solution composed of 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and 1 mm SYTOX Green. After 20 min of incubation at 37 °C, fluorescence was recorded (excitation, 485 nm; emission, 520 nm). A standard curve was obtained by placing a serial dilution of the cell suspension in the bottom wells. The results were expressed as chemotaxis index (chemotaxis index = number of cells migrated toward chemoattractant/number of cells migrated toward medium) and chemokinesis index (chemokinesis index = number of ABA-treated cells migrated toward medium/number of untreated cells migrated toward medium). Twenty-four hours after transfection, phagocytosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were determined on granulocytes (untreated, negative control- and siRNA-transfected) as described before (16Bruzzone S. Moreschi I. Usai C. Guida L. Damonte G. Salis A. Scarfì S. Millo E. De Flora A. Zocchi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 5759-5764Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). CD38+ HeLa transfected with the control, empty plasmid, or with the LANCL2 plasmid (2 × 105/determination) were incubated in duplicate at 20 °C for 60 min in 100 μl of HBSS with or without excess unlabeled ABA (to determine nonspecific binding), in the presence of increasing co"
https://openalex.org/W2106244705,"The pleiotropic actions of neuromodulators on pre- and postsynaptic targets make disentangling the mechanisms underlying regulation of synaptic transmission challenging. In the striatum, acetylcholine modulates glutamate release via activation of muscarinic receptors (mAchRs), although the consequences for postsynaptic signaling are unclear. Using two-photon microscopy and glutamate uncaging to examine individual synapses in the rat striatum, we found that glutamatergic afferents have a high degree of multivesicular release (MVR) in the absence of postsynaptic receptor saturation. We found that mAchR activation decreased both the probability of release and the concentration of glutamate in the synaptic cleft. The corresponding decrease in synaptic potency reduced the duration of synaptic potentials and limited temporal summation of afferent inputs. These findings reveal a mechanism by which a combination of basal MVR and low receptor saturation allow the presynaptic actions of a neuromodulator to control the engagement of postsynaptic nonlinearities and regulate synaptic integration."
https://openalex.org/W2172200071,"It has been thought that blue-yellow color opponent cells in the primate retina receive little input from rods. Here, the authors report that rod and cone signals are multiplexed in blue-yellow cells and that this may be the source of the blue hue bias in night vision. Small bistratified cells (SBCs) in the primate retina carry a major blue-yellow opponent signal to the brain. We found that SBCs also carry signals from rod photoreceptors, with the same sign as S cone input. SBCs exhibited robust responses under low scotopic conditions. Physiological and anatomical experiments indicated that this rod input arose from the AII amacrine cell–mediated rod pathway. Rod and cone signals were both present in SBCs at mesopic light levels. These findings have three implications. First, more retinal circuits may multiplex rod and cone signals than were previously thought to, efficiently exploiting the limited number of optic nerve fibers. Second, signals from AII amacrine cells may diverge to most or all of the ∼20 retinal ganglion cell types in the peripheral primate retina. Third, rod input to SBCs may be the substrate for behavioral biases toward perception of blue at mesopic light levels."
https://openalex.org/W2054598174,"Protein degradation is an essential process that continuously takes place in all living cells. Regulated degradation of most cellular proteins is initiated by proteasomes, which produce peptides of varying length. These peptides are rapidly cleaved to single amino acids by cytoplasmic peptidases. Proline-containing peptides pose a specific problem due to structural constrains imposed by the pyrrolidine ring that prevents most peptidases from cleavage. Here we show that DPP9, a poorly characterized cytoplasmic prolyl-peptidase, is rate-limiting for destruction of proline-containing substrates both in cell extracts and in intact cells. We identified the first natural substrate for DPP9, the RU1(34-42) antigenic peptide (VPYGSFKHV). RU1(34-42) is degraded in vitro by DPP9, and down-regulation of DPP9 in intact cells results in increased presentation of this antigen. Together our findings demonstrate an important role for DPP9 in peptide turnover and antigen presentation."
https://openalex.org/W2011355386,"The c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) is an important player in inflammation, proliferation, and apoptosis. More recently, JNK was found to regulate cell migration by phosphorylating paxillin. Here, we report a novel role of JNK in cell adhesion. Specifically, we provide evidence that JNK binds to E-cadherin/beta-catenin complex and phosphorylates beta-catenin at serine 37 and threonine 41, the sites also phosphorylated by GSK-3beta. Inhibition of JNK kinase activity using dominant-negative constructs reduces phosphorylation of beta-catenin and promotes localization of E-cadherin/beta-catenin complex to cell-cell contact sites. Conversely, activation of JNK induces beta-catenin phosphorylation and disruption of cell contacts, which are prevented by JNK siRNA. We propose that JNK binds to beta-catenin and regulates formation of adherens junctions, ultimately controlling cell-to-cell adhesion."

The role of intrauterine inflammation, although implicated in preterm birth, is not yet established in human term labor. We hypothesized that intrauterine inflammation at term is associated with spontaneous onset of labor.In two large urban hospitals in the Netherlands, a cross-sectional study of spontaneous onset term vaginal deliveries and elective caesarean sections (CS), without signs of labor, was carried out. Placentas and amniotic fluid samples were collected during labor and/or at delivery. Histological signs of placenta inflammation were determined. Amniotic fluid proinflammatory cytokine concentrations were measured using ELISA. A total of 375 women were included. In term vaginal deliveries, more signs of intrauterine inflammation were found than in elective CS: the prevalence of chorioamnionitis was higher (18 vs 4%, p = 0.02) and amniotic fluid concentration of IL-6 was higher (3.1 vs 0.37 ng/mL, p<0.001). Similar results were obtained for IL-8 (10.93 vs 0.96 ng/mL, p<0.001) and percentage of detectable TNF-alpha (50 vs 4%, p<0.001).This large cross-sectional study shows that spontaneous term delivery is characterized by histopathological signs of placenta inflammation and increased amniotic fluid proinflammatory cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W1982286295,"Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP(3)Rs) are ubiquitous intracellular Ca2+ channels. IP(3) binding to the IP(3)-binding core (IBC) near the N terminus initiates conformational changes that lead to opening of a pore. The mechanisms underlying this process are unresolved. We synthesized 2-O-modified IP(3) analogs that are partial agonists of IP(3)R. These are similar to IP(3) in their interactions with the IBC, but they are less effective than IP(3) in rearranging the relationship between the IBC and the N-terminal suppressor domain (SD), and they open the channel at slower rates. IP(3)R with a mutation in the SD occupying a position similar to the 2-O substituent of the partial agonists has a reduced open probability that is similar for full and partial agonists. Bulky or charged substituents from either the ligand or the SD therefore block obligatory coupling of the IBC and the SD. Analysis of DeltaG for ligand binding shows that IP(3) is recognized by the IBC and conformational changes then propagate entirely via the SD to the pore."
https://openalex.org/W2013080012,"The multifunctional protein Yin Yang 1 (YY1) has an important role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression. YY1 is highly expressed in various types of cancers, including prostate cancer. Currently, the mechanism underlying the functional role of YY1 in prostate tumorigenesis remains unclear. In this report, we investigated the functional interplay between YY1 and androgen receptor (AR), and the effect of YY1 on AR-mediated transcription. We found that YY1 physically interacts with AR both in a cell-free system and in cultured cells. YY1 is required for the optimal transcriptional activity of AR in promoting the transcription of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) promoter. However, ectopic YY1 expression in LNCaP cells did not further enhance the reporter driven by the PSA promoter, suggesting that an optimal level of YY1 is already established in prostate tumor cells. Consistently, YY1 depletion in LNCaP cells reduced endogenous PSA levels, but overexpressed YY1 did not significantly increase PSA expression. We also observed that YY1–AR interaction is essential to YY1-mediated transcription activity of AR and YY1 is a necessary component in the complex binding to the androgen response element. Thus, our study demonstrates that YY1 interacts with AR and regulates its transcriptional activity."
https://openalex.org/W2092950531,"The brain tumor glioblastoma (GBM) remains one of the most aggressive and devastating tumors despite decades of effort to find more effective treatments. A hallmark of GBM is the constitutive activation of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling pathway, which regulates cell proliferation, inflammation, migration and apoptosis. The prolyl isomerase, Pin1, has been found to bind directly to the NF-κB protein, p65, and cause increases in NF-κB promoter activity in a breast cancer model. We now present evidence that this interaction occurs in GBM and that it has important consequences on NF-κB signaling. We demonstrate that Pin1 levels are enhanced in primary GBM tissues compared with controls, and that this difference in Pin1 expression affects the migratory capacity of GBM-derived cells. Pin1 knockdown decreases the amount of activated, phosphorylated p65 in the nucleus, resulting in inhibition of the transcriptional program of the IL-8 gene. Through the use of microarray, we also observed changes in the expression levels of other NF-κB regulated genes due to Pin1 knockdown. Taken together, these data suggest that Pin1 is an important regulator of NF-κB in GBM, and support the notion of using Pin1 as a therapeutic target in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2053530884,"Microtubule-perturbing drugs have become front-line chemotherapeutics, inducing cell-cycle crisis as a major mechanism of action. However, these agents show pleiotropic effects on cells and can induce apoptosis through other means. Paclitaxel, a microtubule-stabilizing agent, induces a caspase-dependent apoptosis, although the precise mechanism(s) remain unclear. Here, we used genetic approaches to evaluate the role of caspase 8 in paclitaxel-mediated apoptosis. We observed that caspase 8-expressing cells are more sensitive to paclitaxel than caspase 8-deficient cells. Mechanistically, caspase 8 was found associated with microtubules, and this interaction increased after paclitaxel treatment. The prodomains death effector domains (DEDs) of caspase 8 were sufficient for interaction with microtubules, but the caspase 8 holoprotein was required for apoptosis. DED-only forms of caspase 8 were found in both primary and tumor cell lines, associating with perinuclear microtubules and the centrosome. Microtubule association, and paclitaxel sensitivity, depends on a critical lysine (K156) within a microtubule-binding motif (KLD) in DED-b of caspase 8. The results show an unexpected pathway of apoptosis mediated by caspase 8."
https://openalex.org/W2152832787,"BAD is a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family that is regulated by phosphorylation in response to survival factors. Although much attention has been devoted to the identification of phosphorylation sites in murine BAD, little data are available with respect to phosphorylation of human BAD protein. Using mass spectrometry, we identified here besides the established phosphorylation sites at serines 75, 99, and 118 several novel in vivo phosphorylation sites within human BAD (serines 25, 32/34, 97, and 124). Furthermore, we investigated the quantitative contribution of BAD targeting kinases in phosphorylating serine residues 75, 99, and 118. Our results indicate that RAF kinases represent, besides protein kinase A, PAK, and Akt/protein kinase B, in vivo BAD-phosphorylating kinases. RAF-induced phosphorylation of BAD was reduced to control levels using the RAF inhibitor BAY 43-9006. This phosphorylation was not prevented by MEK inhibitors. Consistently, expression of constitutively active RAF suppressed apoptosis induced by BAD and the inhibition of colony formation caused by BAD could be prevented by RAF. In addition, using the surface plasmon resonance technique, we analyzed the direct consequences of BAD phosphorylation by RAF with respect to association with 14-3-3 and Bcl-2/Bcl-XL proteins. Phosphorylation of BAD by active RAF promotes 14-3-3 protein association, in which the phosphoserine 99 represented the major binding site. Finally, we show here that BAD forms channels in planar bilayer membranes in vitro. This pore-forming capacity was dependent on phosphorylation status and interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. Collectively, our findings provide new insights into the regulation of BAD function by phosphorylation.

Phosphorylation of BAD by active RAF promotes 14-3-3 protein association, in which the phosphoserine 99 represented the major binding site. Finally, we show here that BAD forms channels in planar bilayer membranes in vitro. This pore-forming capacity was dependent on phosphorylation status and interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. Collectively, our findings provide new insights into the regulation of BAD function by phosphorylation. Apoptosis is a genetically programmed, morphologically distinct form of cell death that can be triggered by a variety of physiological and pathological stimuli (1Reed J.C. Doctor K.S. Godzik A. Sci.

Cell. 2006; 21: 728-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This form of cellular suicide is widely observed in nature and is not only essential for embryogenesis, immune responses, and tissue homeostasis but is also involved in diseases such as tumor development and progression. Bcl-2 family proteins play a pivotal role in controlling programmed cell death. The major function of these proteins is to directly modulate outer mitochondrial membrane permeability and thereby regulate the release of apoptogenic factors from the intermembrane space into the cytoplasm (for a recent review, see Ref. 4Youle R.J. Strasser A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (3422) Google Scholar). On the basis of various structural and functional characteristics, the Bcl-2 family of proteins is divided into three subfamilies, including proteins that either inhibit (e.g. Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, or Bcl-w) or promote programmed cell death (e.g. Bax, Bak, or Bok) (5Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4754) Google Scholar, 6Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3224) Google Scholar).

Strasser A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (3422) Google Scholar). BH3-only proteins share sequence homology only at the BH3 domain. The amphipathic helix formed by the BH3 domain (and neighboring residues) associates with a hydrophobic groove of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members (7Fesik S.W. Cell. 2000; 103: 273-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 8Petros A.M. Olejniczak E.T. Fesik S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1644: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Originally, truncated Bid has been reported to interact with Bax and Bak (9Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that some BH3-only proteins promote apoptosis via at least two different mechanisms: inactivating Bcl-2-like proteins by direct binding and/or by inducing modification of Bax-like molecules. BAD (Bcl-2-associated death promoter, Bcl-2 antagonist of cell death) was described to promote apoptosis by forming heterodimers with the prosurvival proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, thus preventing them from binding with Bax (10Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar). More recently, two major models have been suggested for how BH3-only proteins may induce apoptosis. In the direct model, all BH3-only proteins promote cell death by directly binding and inactivating their specific anti-death Bcl-2 protein partner (11Galonek H.L. Hardwick J.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1317-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 12Willis S.N. Fletcher J.I. Kaufmann T. van Delft M.F. Chen L. Czabotar P.E. Ierino H. Lee E.F. Fairlie W.D. Bouillet P. Strasser A. Kluck R.M. Adams J.M. Huang D.C. Science. 2007; 315: 856-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). In this model, the relative killing potency of different BH3-only proteins is based on their affinities for antiapoptotic proteins. Thus, the activation of Bax/Bak would be mediated through their release from antiapoptotic counterparts. Contrary to this model, Kim et al. (13Kim H. Rafiuddin-Shah M. Tu H.C. Jeffers J.R. Zambetti G.P. Hsieh J.J. Cheng E.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1348-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar) provided support for an alternative hierarchy model, in which BH3-only proteins are divided into two distinct subsets. According to this model, the inactivator BH3-only proteins, like BAD, Noxa, and some others, respond directly to survival factors, resulting in phosphorylation, 14-3-3 binding, and suppression of the proapoptotic function. In the absence of growth factors, these proteins engage specifically their preferred antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. The targeted Bcl-2 proteins then release the other subset of BH3-only proteins designated the activators (truncated Bid, Bim, and Puma) that in turn bind to and activate Bax and Bak.

Non-phosphorylated BAD associated with Bcl-2/Bcl-XL is found at the outer mitochondrial membrane. Phosphorylation of specific serine residues, Ser-112 and Ser-136 of mouse BAD (mBAD) or the corresponding phosphorylation sites Ser-75 and Ser-99 of human BAD (hBAD), results in association with 14-3-3 proteins and subsequent relocation of BAD (14Hekman M. Albert S. Galmiche A. Rennefahrt U.E. Fueller J. Fischer A. Puehringer D. Wiese S. Rapp U.R. J. Biol.

Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2233) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of mBAD at Ser-155 (Ser-118 of hBAD) within its BH3 domain disrupts the association with Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL, promoting cell survival (16Datta S.R. Katsov A. Hu L. Petros A. Fesik S.W. Yaffe M.B. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Therefore, the phosphorylation status of BAD at these serine residues reflects a checkpoint for cell death or survival. Although the C-RAF kinase was the first reported BAD kinase (17Wang H.G. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar), its target sites were not clearly defined. However, there is a growing body of evidence for direct participation of RAF in regulation of apoptosis via BAD (18Jin S. Zhuo Y. Guo W. Field J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24698-24705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 19Panka D.J. Wang W. Atkins M.B. Mier J.W.

On the other hand, numerous reports suggest that PKA (21Harada H. Becknell B. Wilm M. Mann M. Huang L.J. Taylor S.S. Scott J.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol.

BMC Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) are involved in BAD phosphorylation as well. The involvement of c-Jun N-terminal kinase in BAD phosphorylation is controversially discussed. Whereas Donovan et al. (30Donovan N. Becker E.B. Konishi Y. Bonni A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40944-40949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) reported that c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylates mBAD at serine 128, Zhang et al. (31Zhang J. Liu J. Yu C. Lin A. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8372-8378Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) claimed that c-Jun N-terminal kinase is not a BAD-serine 128 kinase. On the other hand, it has been shown that c-Jun N-terminal kinase is able to suppress IL-3 withdrawal-induced apoptosis via phosphorylation of mBAD at threonine 201 (32Yu C. Minemoto Y. Zhang J. Liu J. Tang F. Bui T.N. Xiang J. Lin A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Thus, taken together, with respect to regulation of mBAD by phosphorylation, five serine phosphorylation sites (at positions 112, 128, 136, 155, and 170) and two threonines (117 and 201) have been identified so far. Intriguingly, only little data are available regarding the role of phosphorylation in regulation of hBAD protein, although significant structural differences between these two BAD proteins exist. During apoptosis, some members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, such as Bax or Bak, have been shown to induce permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane, allowing proteins in the mitochondrial intermembrane space to escape into the cytosol, where they can initiate caspase activation and cell death (for a review, see Refs. 33Zamzami N. Kroemer G. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: R71-R73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar and 34Antignani A. Youle R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Despite intensive investigation, the mechanism whereby Bax and Bak induce outer membrane permeability remains controversial (34Antignani A. Youle R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Based on crystal structure (35Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.L. Ng S.L. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar), it became evident that Bcl-XL has a pronounced similarity to the translocation domain of diphtheria toxin (36Choe S. Bennett M.J. Fujii G. Curmi P.M. Kantardjieff K.A. Collier R.J. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 357: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar), a domain that can form pores in artificial lipid bilayers. This discovery provoked the predominant view that upon commitment to apoptosis, the proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak also form pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane (37Martinou J.C. Green D.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). As expected from the structural considerations, Bcl-XL was found to form channels in synthetic lipid membranes (38Minn A.J. Vélez P. Schendel S.L. Liang H. Muchmore S.W. Fesik S.W. Fill M. Thompson C.B. Nature. 1997; 385: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Since then, other Bcl-2 family members like Bcl-2, Bax, and the BH3-only protein Bid have been reported to have channel-forming ability. These pores can be divided into two different types: proteinaceous channels of defined size and ion specificity (38Minn A.J. Vélez P. Schendel S.L. Liang H. Muchmore S.W. Fesik S.W. Fill M.

With respect to the BH3-only protein BAD, no pore-forming abilities have been reported so far, although human BAD has been found to possess per se high affinity for negatively charged phospholipids and liposomes, mimicking mitochondrial membranes (14Hekman M. Albert S. Galmiche A. Rennefahrt U.E. Fueller J. Fischer A. Puehringer D. Wiese S. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17321-17336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The RAF kinases (A-, B-, and C-RAF) play a central role in the conserved Ras-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling cascade and mediate cellular responses induced by growth factors (45Daum G. Eisenmann-Tappe I.

Direct involvement of C-RAF in inhibition of proapoptotic properties of BAD established a link between signal transduction and apoptosis control (48Rapp U.R. Rennefahrt U. Troppmair J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1644: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 49Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 1341-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, the early works did not identify the exact RAF phosphorylation sites on BAD (17Wang H.G. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that hBAD serves as a substrate of RAF isoforms. With respect to hBAD phosphorylation by PKA, Akt/PKB, and PAK1 in vivo, we observed different specificity compared with RAF kinases. hBAD phosphorylation by RAF was accompanied by reduced apoptosis in HEK293 cells (transformed human embryonic kidney cells) and NIH 3T3 cells (a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line). Furthermore, we show that in vitro phosphorylation of hBAD by RAF at serines 75, 99, and 118 regulates the binding of 14-3-3 proteins and association with Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. By use of mass spectrometry, we detected several novel in vivo phosphorylation sites of hBAD in addition to the established phosphorylation sites, serines 75, 99, and 118. Finally, we show here that hBAD forms channels in planar bilayer membranes in vitro. This pore-forming capacity was dependent on phosphorylation status and interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. HEK293 cells and NIH 3T3 cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 45 min), 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2. U0126 (Promega), PD98059 (Promega), BAY 43-9006, forskolin (Alexis), isobutylmethylxanthine (Sigma), CI1040 (Axon Medchem), wortmannin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and LY294002 (Promega) were dissolved in DMSO (Sigma), whereas H-89 (Sigma) was dissolved in ethanol. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/well of a 6-well plate and grown for 24 h before transfection by Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). HEK293 cells were seeded at 7.5 × 105 cells/well on a 6-well plate and grown for 24 h before they were transfected with expression plasmids by the calcium phosphate method (50Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). 16 h post-transfection, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and cultivated for the indicated time in medium supplemented with 0.3% serum to avoid activity of endogenous kinases. Cells were washed once in PBS, and equal amounts of cells were lysed by the direct addition of Laemmli buffer or in Nonidet P-40 buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 142.5 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with a mixture of standard protease inhibitors). Protein concentration was determined by Bradford method. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (14Hekman M. Albert S. Galmiche A. Rennefahrt U.E. Fueller J. Fischer A. Puehringer D. Wiese S. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17321-17336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The following primary antibodies were used: monoclonal anti-phospho-ERK antibody (catalog number 9106; Cell Signaling Technology), phosphospecific antibodies against mBAD phosphoserines 112 and 155 (catalog numbers 9295 and 9297; Cell Signaling Technology) and phosphoserine 136 (44-524Z; BIOSOURCE), polyclonal anti-actin (A2066; Sigma), polyclonal anti-Akt/PKB (catalog number 9272; Cell Signaling Technology), polyclonal anti-BAD antibody (sc-943 and sc-8044; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-PAK antibody (sc-881; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-B-RAF antibody (sc-166; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-PKA antibody (sc-903; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and pan-RAF antibody (30K; Institute for Medical Radiation and Cell Research). For the analysis of cell survival, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected in triplicates. 16 h post-transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS and grown for 30 h in medium supplemented with 0.3% serum. Cell viability was assessed by staining cells in trypan blue (Sigma). NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids using Lipofectamine. The day after transfection, cells were split, and around 50 cells of each set of transfection were seeded in 6-cm dishes. Colony assays were performed in triplicate by scoring the number of colonies (consisting of at least 20 cells) in the dishes grown for 14–18 days with appropriate antibiotic selection (450 μg/ml neomycin and 6 μg/ml puromycin; Calbiochem). To visualize the growing colonies, cells were washed once with PBS, fixed with methanol, and stained with Giemsa dye (Sigma). Human BAD cDNA (kind gift of John Reed, La Jolla, CA) and cDNAs mutated at serine 75 (S75A), serine 99 (S99A), serine 118 (S118A), serines 75/99 (S75A/S99A), and serines 75, 99, and 118 (S75A/S99A/S118A) were cloned into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). Deletion mutants of hBAD were PCR-amplified, with primer overhangs containing restriction sites and cloned into GST fusion vector pGEX-TT cleaved with the appropriate enzymes. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by using QuikChange (Stratagene). To generate N-terminal His-tagged hBAD, the cDNA was released by EcoRI/NotI from pGEX-4T-1 and ligated in the EcoRI/NotI sites of pFastBac H1 (Invitrogen). Human Bcl-XL (John Reed, La Jolla, CA) was isolated from pcDNA3 using EcoRI and ligated with blunt ends in pFastBac-GST linearized by StuI. PAK1 constructs were from Jonathan Chernoff (Philadelphia, PA). Akt/PKB plasmids were kindly provided by Jakob Troppmair (Innsbruck, Austria). pGEX-Bcl-2 was kindly donated by John Reed. Expression and purification of RAF kinases, PAK1, Akt/PKB, 14-3-3 proteins, and Bcl-XL from Sf9 insect cells (an insect cell line derived from pupal ovarian tissue of Spodoptera frugiperda) were performed as previously described (14Hekman M.

For purification of phosphorylated His-hBAD, Sf9 cells were infected with baculoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 5 and incubated for 48 h at 27 °C. The Sf9 cell pellet (2 × 108 cells) was lysed in 10 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and a mixture of standard proteinase inhibitors for 30 min with gentle rotation at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (10 ml) containing His-hBAD was incubated with 0.5 ml Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. After incubation, the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole, and hBAD was eluted with an imidazole step gradient. GST-tagged 14-3-3 proteins and GST-hBAD were expressed in Escherichia coli using pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences) and purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography. For lipid bilayer experiments, GST-hBAD was additionally purified by ion exchange chromatography using an AKTA system (GE Healthcare). 14-3-3 proteins were released by thrombin (Sigma) cleavage using standard protocols. The purity of the proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue. To enrich and separate phosphorylated His-hBAD from the non-phosphorylated fraction, His-hBAD purified from Sf9 cells (0.5 mg) was incubated with 0.5 mg of recombinant GST-14-3-3ζ on glutathione-Sepharose beads (300 μl) for 40 min at room temperature. After excessive washing with 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.01% Nonidet P-40, the phosphorylated hBAD fraction was released from the complex by 1% Empigen (Calbiochem). Human GST-BAD was incubated with purified preparations of RAF kinases, PKA, Akt/PKB, or PAK1 in 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.6, in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 500 μm ATP. The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of Laemmli buffer. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The extent of BAD phosphorylation at serines 75, 99, and 118 was detected by phosphospecific antibodies. To inhibit kinase activity in vitro, purified kinases were preincubated with BAY 43-9006 or H-89 at room temperature for 30 min. Purified His-hBAD samples (about 100 pmol of each) were applied to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining, applying the method of Neuhoff et al. (54Neuhoff V. Arold N. Taube D. Ehrhardt W. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (2337) Google Scholar). In-gel reduction, acetamidation, and tryptic and/or GluC digestion were done according to Wilm et al.

After elution of the peptides, solutions were desalted using a Millipore C18 ZipTip according to the manufacturer's instructions. ESI-MS was performed on a Bruker APEX II FT-ICR mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonic GmbH Bremen) equipped with an Apollo-Nano-ESI ion source in positive ion mode. To determine the exact positions of phosphates within the peptides, the nano-LC-MS/MS analysis was carried out as follows. Purified hBAD samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and protein bands were excised, washed, and digested in gel as described previously (56Reinders J. Wagner K"

Treatment of LNCaP prostate cancer cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) causes a strong and sustained activation of RhoA and its downstream effector ROCK (Rho kinase) as well as the formation of stress fibers. These effects are impaired in cells subjected to PKCδ RNA interference depletion. Functional studies revealed that expression of a dominant negative RhoA mutant or treatment with the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 inhibits the apoptotic effect of PMA in LNCaP cells. Remarkably, the cytoskeleton inhibitors cytochalasin B and blebbistatin blocked not only PMA-induced apoptosis but also the activation of JNK, a mediator of the cell death effect by the phorbol ester. In addition, we found that up-regulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p21Cip1 is required for PMA-induced apoptosis and that inhibitors of ROCK or the cytoskeleton organization prevent p21Cip1 induction. Real time PCR analysis and reporter gene assay revealed that PMA induces p21Cip1 transcriptionally in a ROCK- and cytoskeleton-dependent manner. p21Cip1 promoter analysis revealed that PMA induction is dependent on Sp1 elements in the p21Cip1 promoter but independent of p53.

Based on their different structural organization and biochemical regulation by lipids and calcium, PKCs have been classified into three groups: classical or conventional (PKCα, -β, and -γ), novel (PKCδ, -ϵ, -η, and -θ), and atypical PKCs (PKCζ and -λ). Both conventional PKCs and novel PKCs are the target for the phorbol esters, natural products that mimic the action of the lipid second messenger diacylglycerol (1Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 2Griner E.M. Kazanietz M.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Despite their well characterized tumor promoter activity, phorbol esters cause dissimilar effects, since they can either stimulate proliferation and survival or, conversely, induce cell growth arrest or trigger apoptotic cell death, depending on the cell type (2Griner E.M. Kazanietz M.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 3Barry O.P. Kazanietz M.G. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2001; 7: 1725-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Such diversity relates primarily to the differential expression of PKC isozymes according to cell type as well as to the great divergence in the signaling events modulated by individual PKCs. One of the key PKC isozymes implicated in negative growth regulation is PKCδ. Work from several laboratories, including ours, established that PKCδ modulates the transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle by controlling the phosphorylation status of retinoblastoma (4Nakagawa M.

Among the few cell types that undergo apoptosis in response to phorbol esters, androgen-responsive prostate cancer cells have been one of the best characterized models. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) triggers an apoptotic response in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells, including LNCaP, C4-2, and CWR22-Rv1 cells (7Fujii T. García-Bermejo M.L.

The mechanisms underlying the cell death effect of phorbol esters in prostate cancer cells are only partially understood, but they seem to involve the p21Cip1/retinoblastoma pathway (10Zhao X.

Our previous studies established that this effect is primarily mediated by PKCδ, and subsequent analysis revealed that this kinase promotes the activation of the extrinsic apoptotic cascade via an autocrine mechanism. PMA promotes the secretion of death factors from LNCaP cells via PKCδ, including TNFα and TRAIL, and the released factors promote cell death via activation of JNK and p38 MAPK cascades (11Gonzalez-Guerrico A.M.

These small G-proteins have been established as important mediators of receptor signaling and control a variety of cellular functions related to cell division and morphology. Upon receptor activation, Rho GTPases dissociate from Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (Rho-GDIs), allowing Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Rho-GEFs) to switch GDP by GTP and Rho activation (13Jaffe A.B. Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 247-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (2377) Google Scholar). Members of the Rho family were originally established as key regulators of cytoskeletal organization in response to extracellular growth factors. Studies over the past few years have revealed that Rho GTPases also play crucial roles in diverse cellular events, such as transcriptional regulation, cell cycle control, endocytosis, differentiation, and apoptosis (13Jaffe A.B. Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 247-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (2377) Google Scholar, 14Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3875) Google Scholar). Recently, growing attention has been drawn toward the emerging role of the cytoskeleton in the modulation of apoptosis. RhoA, predominantly through its effectors ROCKI and ROCKII serine/threonine kinases, regulates the phosphorylation of multiple downstream targets, including myosin light chain and LIM kinases (15Riento K. Ridley A.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 446-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar, 16Shi J. Wei L. Arch. Immunol. Ther. Exp. 2007; 55: 61-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), which control actin cytoskeleton assembly and cell contractility. It has been shown that caspase-3-mediated ROCKI activation is both necessary and sufficient for the formation of membrane blebs and nuclear disintegration in apoptotic cells (17Coleman M.L. Sahai E.A. Yeo M. Bosch M. Dewar A. Olson M.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar, 18Sebbagh M. Renvoizé C. Hamelin J. Riché N. Bertoglio J. Bréard J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). In some cell types, ROCK is involved in the intracellular signaling that initiates apoptosis, such as caspase-8, caspase-10, and caspase-3 activation (19Lai J.M. Hsieh C.L. Chang Z.F. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3491-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) or modulates the transcription of the proapoptotic proteins, such as Bax (20Del Re D.P. Miyamoto S. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8069-8078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Emerging evidence implicated Rho GTPases as mediators of PKC signaling. For example, the decreased invasiveness of PKCϵ-depleted head and neck squamous carcinoma cells is associated with a corresponding inactivation of RhoA and RhoC GTPases (21Pan Q. Bao L.W. Teknos T.N. Merajver S.D. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9379-9384Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). PKCs can modulate Rho function through either Rho-GEF activation or Rho-GDI inactivation (22Chang Y.C.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4437-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether Rho or its downstream effectors are implicated in PMA-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. In the present study, we show that PMA causes a strong and sustained activation of Rho and the formation of stress fibers via PKCδ. Notably, inhibition of Rho or its downstream effector ROCK impairs apoptosis triggered by PKC activation, suggesting a crucial role for Rho and ROCK downstream of PKCδ. We also found that ROCK mediates the induction of p21Cip1, a necessary event for apoptosis induced by PMA. All of these effects depend on the integrity of the cytoskeleton, since agents that disrupt cytoskeleton organization markedly impaired apoptosis, JNK activation, and p21Cip1 induction by PMA. PMA was purchased from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole, cytochalasin, and blebbistatin were obtained from Sigma. Y-27632 and SP600125 were purchased from Calbiochem. GF 109203X was purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Rhodamine-phalloidin was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Microcystin-LR was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Cell culture reagents and media were from ATCC (Manassas, VA). LNCaP, C4-2, and CWR22 human prostate cancer cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin (100 units/ml)-streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. LNCaP cells in 6-well plates (∼70% confluence) growing in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum were infected with an adenovirus (AdV) for a dominant negative RhoA mutant N19-RhoA or a GFP control AdV for 14 h at a multiplicity of infection of 10 plaque-forming units/cell. After removal of the AdV by extensive washing, cells were incubated for an additional 24 h in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Expression of the recombinant protein remained stable throughout the duration of the experiment, as detected by Western blotting (data not shown). Cells were harvested into lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Protein determinations were performed with the Bio-Rad Dc protein assay according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Equal amounts of protein (20 μg/lane) were subject to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk or 5% bovine serum albumin in 0.05% Tween 20, phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with the first antibody overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed three times with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS and then incubated with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:3000; Bio-Rad). Bands were visualized with the ECL Western blotting detection system. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-PKCδ (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY); anti-RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); anti-actin (Sigma); anti-p21Cip1, anti-phospho-JNK, anti-JNK, anti-phospho-p38 MAPK, and anti-p38 MAPK (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA); and anti-phospho-MYPT1 (myosin phosphatase target subunit 1)-Thr850 (Millipore, Billerica, MA). All antibodies were used at a 1:1000 dilution except for the anti-actin antibody, which was used at a 1:20,000 dilution. The incidence of apoptosis was determined as we previously described (7Fujii T. García-Bermejo M.L. Bernabó J.L. Caamaño J. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Li L. Yuspa S.H. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7574-7582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma). Cells were trypsinized, mounted on glass slides, fixed in 70% ethanol, and then stained for 20 min with 1 mg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Apoptosis was characterized by chromatin condensation and fragmentation when examined by fluorescence microscopy. The incidence of apoptosis in each preparation was analyzed by counting ∼300 cells. 21-bp double-stranded RNAs were purchased from Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Dallas, TX) or Ambion (Austin, TX) and transfected into LNCaP cells using the Amaxa Nucleofector (Amaxa Biosystems, Gaithersburg, MD) following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Experiments were performed 48 h after transfection. The following targeting sequences were used: CCATGAGTTTATCGCCACCTT (PKCδ 1), CCATGTATCCTGAGTGGAA (PKCδ 2), AACATACTGGCCTGGACTGTT (p21Cip1 1), ATCGTCCAGCGACCTTCCTTT (p21Cip1 2), GGTAGCTCTAAGTTTTGAT (Sp1 1), and GGTCATTTCTTTGCTTATG (Sp1 2). As a control RNAi, we used the Silencer® negative control 7 siRNAi (Ambion). RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Two μg of RNA/sample were reverse transcribed using the First-Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences) following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. PCR primers and fluorogenic probes for p21Cip1 were purchased from Applied Biosystems. The probes were 5′-end-labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein. Each PCR amplification was performed in a total volume of 12.5 μl, containing 6.25 μl of 2× TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), commercial target primers (300 nm), the fluorescent probe (200 nm), and 1 μl of cDNA, using an ABI PRISM 7700 detection system. PCR product formation was continuously monitored using Sequence Detection System software version 1.7 (Applied Biosystems). The 6-carboxyfluorescein signal was normalized to endogenous 18 S RNA. LNCaP cells (1.5 × 106 cells) were transfected with 2 μg of p21Cip1 firefly luciferase reporter vectors (25De Siervi A. Marinissen M. Diggs J. Wang X.F. Pages G. Senderowicz A. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) using the Amaxa Nucleofector. A Renilla luciferase expression vector (100 ng, pRL-TK; Promega, Madison, WI) was co-transfected for normalization of transfection efficiency. Forty-eight h after transfection, cells were stimulated with PMA and lysed. Cell extracts were subject to luciferase determination using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, and washed briefly with PBS. For phalloidin staining, cells were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. Cells were stained with phalloidin (Molecule Probes) in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (30 min, room temperature) and then stained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1 μg/ml, 20 min, 4 °C). For the determination of GFP-PKCδ localization, LNCaP cells were transfected with pEGFP-PKCδ plasmid using the Amaxa Nucleofector and 48 h later treated with PMA. In all cases, coverslides were mounted with Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech) and visualized with a laser-scanning fluorescence microscope (LSM 410 or 510; Carl Zeiss). RhoA-GTP levels were determined with a pull-down assay using the rhotekin binding domain and detected by Western blot with an anti-RhoA antibody (26Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 264-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 500 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2. The supernatant was collected and incubated with glutathione S-transferase-rhotekin binding domain (20 μg) for 60 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, boiled with SDS sample buffer with 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and subjected to Western blot. ROCK kinase activity was measured by two approaches. First, we determined phosphorylation of the endogenous ROCK substrate MYPT1 in total cell extracts using a rabbit anti-phospho-Thr850-MYPT1 antibody (27Liu P.Y. Liao J.K. Methods Enzymol. 2008; 439: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Second, we used the ROCK Activity Immunoblot Kit (Cell Biolabs, Inc.). Briefly, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed with an immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 5% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 1 μm microcystin-LR, and mixture proteinase inhibitor). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min to remove insoluble debris. Supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes, precleared with protein G-Sepharose (Invitrogen) beads for 15 min, and incubated with an anti-ROCK antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 40 min. The antibody-ROCK complexes were pulled down with protein G-Sepharose beads (20 min). Beads were washed three times in immunoprecipitation buffer and incubated with the kinase reaction mixture (final volume = 25 μl) that included 0.25 μg of rMYPT1 and 200 μg of ATP, following the protocol indicated by the manufacturer. Samples were subjected to Western blot, and rMYPT1 phosphorylation was determined using a rabbit anti-phospho-Thr850 MYPT1 antibody. TNFα levels were determined by ELISA (Pepro Tech Inc.), essentially as described previously (11Gonzalez-Guerrico A.M. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38982-38991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μl of conditioned medium (CM) were added into each well and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently, 100 μl of biotin-labeled anti-TNFα antibody (0.25 μg/ml) was added for 2 h at room temperature. Bound antibody was detected by incubation with peroxidase-labeled avidine and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) from Sigma, and absorbance was measured at 450 nm. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Phorbol esters induce a strong apoptotic response in LNCaP cells. This effect is mediated primarily by PKCδ, which upon activation stimulates the release of death factors and the extrinsic apoptotic cascade (11Gonzalez-Guerrico A.M. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38982-38991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Since PKC isozymes have been shown to regulate Rho GTPases, and Rho has been implicated in apoptosis triggered by diverse stimuli, we speculated that this small G-protein could be involved in phorbol ester-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. To address this issue, we first examined if PMA could promote the activation of RhoA in LNCaP cells. Using a pull-down assay, we found that treatment with PMA (100 nm) caused a robust and sustained elevation in Rho-GTP levels in LNCaP cells, which persisted for at least 3 h poststimulation (Fig. 1A). RhoA activation by PMA was blocked by pretreatment of LNCaP cells with the pan-PKC inhibitor GF 109203X (Fig. 1B), suggesting that it is mediated by PKC isozymes and not other phorbol ester receptors unrelated to PKC (2Griner E.M. Kazanietz M.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Since ROCK is a main Rho effector, we determined the effect of PMA on ROCK activation in LNCaP cells. As a first approach, we examined the phosphorylation of the ROCK substrate MYPT1, using a specific phosphoantibody against Thr850-MYPT1, a well established ROCK phosphorylation site (27Liu P.Y. Liao J.K. Methods Enzymol. 2008; 439: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C (left), PMA induces a marked MYPT1 phosphorylation, which peaks at 15 min and is sustained for at least 1 h. ROCK activation can also be observed in C4-2 and CRW22 androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells (Fig. 1C, right). Next, we examined ROCK activation using an immunoprecipitation assay. Endogenous ROCK was pulled down from LNCaP cells treated with PMA (100 nm, 0–15 min), and ROCK activity was determined using an in vitro kinase assay using as a substrate the recombinant fragment of MYPT1 that comprises the ROCK phosphorylation site (amino acids 654–880). Phosphorylation of the peptide was determined by Western blot using the anti-Thr850-MYPT1 antibody. Consistent with the results in Fig. 1C, ROCK kinase activity was enhanced in immunoprecipitates of PMA-treated LNCaP cells (Fig. 1D). Activation of ROCK by PMA was blocked by pretreatment of cells with the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (Fig. 1E), as expected, as well as by the pan-PKC inhibitor GF 109203X (Fig. 1F). Rho GTPases are best known for their roles in the regulation of cytoskeleton rearrangement and the generation of the contractile force necessary for the formation of stress fibers (13Jaffe A.B. Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 247-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (2377) Google Scholar). We first examined if PKC activation causes cytoskeleton reorganization in LNCaP cells. As shown in Fig. 1G, PMA promotes the formation of stress fibers, and this effect was sensitive to the PKC inhibitor GF 109203X. Moreover, the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 blocked the formation of stress fibers in response to PMA. Taken together, these results indicate that PMA is a strong activator of Rho and its downstream effector ROCK in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. To determine whether Rho plays a role in PMA-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells, we expressed a dominant negative RhoA mutant (N19-RhoA) by adenoviral means. As a control, we used a GFP AdV. Expression of N19-RhoA reduced the apoptotic effect of PMA by ∼40% (Fig. 2A). Next, to determine if ROCK is implicated in PMA-induced apoptosis, we used the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632. As shown in Fig. 2B, the ROCK inhibitor significantly blocked PMA-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells, suggesting a role for the Rho-ROCK pathway in phorbol ester-induced apoptosis. Y-27632 also blocked the apoptotic effect of PMA in C4-2 and CRW22 cells (supplemental Fig. S1). Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that PMA-induced apoptosis is mediated by the activation of PKCδ. Inhibition of PKCδ by either pharmacological means or expression of a dominant negative PKCδ mutant reduces PMA-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells (7Fujii T. García-Bermejo M.L. Bernabó J.L. Caamaño J.

RhoA-GTP levels were determined in LNCaP cells subject to PKCδ RNAi, using two different RNAi duplexes (PKCδ RNAi-1 and PKCδ RNAi-2). PKCδ depletion was >75% with either RNAi duplex (Fig. 2C, left). Fig. 2C (right) shows that the activation of RhoA by PMA was greatly reduced in PKCδ-depleted LNCaP cells. We next assessed the effect of PKCδ knockdown on ROCK activation. As shown in Fig. 2D, PMA- induced activation of ROCK in LNCaP cells was impaired as a consequence of PKCδ RNAi depletion. To further assess the involvement of PKCδ in Rho function, we examined stress fiber formation in response to PMA in PKCδ-depleted cells. Fig. 2E shows that LNCaP cells subjected to PKCδ RNAi failed to assemble stress fibers in response to the PKC activator. These observations indicate that activation of PKCδ in LNCaP cells promotes the activation of RhoA and RhoA-dependent responses via ROCK. Our previous studies established that the apoptotic effect of phorbol esters is caused by the autocrine release of death factors, primarily TNFα and TRAIL, an effect mediated by PKCδ. CM collected from PMA-treated LNCaP cells has the ability to trigger an apoptotic response via the extrinsic cascade, which becomes activated in response to the death factors released to the CM. Although we found that inhibition of JNK does not affect the release of death factors (11Gonzalez-Guerrico A.M. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38982-38991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), SP600126 blocked the apoptotic effect of CM from PMA-treated cells, suggesting a key role for the JNK pathway in the effect of the autocrine factors. CM collected from PMA-treated LNCaP cells causes a strong and sustained JNK activation when added to a previously untreated culture of LNCaP cells (11Gonzalez-Guerrico A.M. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38982-38991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows that the JNK inhibitor SP600126 caused a significant impairment of the PMA apoptotic response. The effect was observed when SP600126 was left in the medium after the PMA treatment but not if only added for short times after PMA treatment (data not shown) (28Tanaka Y. Gavrielides M.V. Mitsuuchi Y. Fujii T. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33753-33762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the involvement of JNK as a mediator of the effect of death factors but not their release (11Gonzalez-Guerrico A.M. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol.

Previous studies have shown that a non-HS-binding mutant form of the inflammatory chemokine CCL7 can block inflammation produced by wild-type chemokines. This study examined the anti-inflammatory mechanism of a non-HS-binding mutant of the homeostatic chemokine CXCL12. Initial experiments demonstrated that mutant CXCL12 was an effective CXCR4 agonist. However, this mutant chemokine failed to promote transendothelial migration in vitro and inhibited the haptotactic response to wild-type CCL7, CXCL12, and CXCL8, and naturally occurring chemoattractants in synovial fluid from the rheumatoid synovium, including CCL2, CCL7, and CXCL8. Notably, intravenous administration of mutant CXCL12 also inhibited the recruitment of leukocytes to murine air pouches filled with wild-type CXCL12. Following intravenous administration, wild-type CXCL12 was cleared from the circulation rapidly, while the mutant chemokine persisted for >24 h. Chronic exposure to mutant CXCL12 in the circulation reduced leukocyte-surface expression of CXCR4, reduced the chemotactic response of these cells to CXCL12, and inhibited normal chemokine-mediated induction of adhesion between the alpha4beta1 integrin, VLA-4, and VCAM-1. These data demonstrate that systemic administration of non-HS-binding variants of CXCL12 can mediate a powerful anti-inflammatory effect through chemokine receptor desensitization."

Microarray studies in prostate DU145 cells identified the pro-cell death gene, BNIP3 (Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa interacting protein 3), as a novel putative target of SIM2s repression. Further validation showed BNIP3 repression in several prostate and pancreatic carcinoma-derived cell lines with ectopic expression of human SIM2s. BNIP3 levels are enhanced in prostate carcinoma cells upon short interfering (si)RNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous SIM2s. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and promoter studies show that SIM2s represses BNIP3 through its activities at the proximal promoter hypoxia response element (HRE), the site through which the bHLH/PAS family member, hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha), induces BNIP3. SIM2s attenuates BNIP3 hypoxic induction via the HRE, and increased hypoxic induction of BNIP3 occurs with siRNA knockdown of endogenous SIM2s in prostate PC3AR+ cells. BNIP3 is implicated in hypoxia-induced cell death processes. Prolonged treatment of PC3AR+ cells with hypoxia mimetics, DP and DMOG, confers hypoxia-induced autophagy, measured by enhanced LC3-II levels and SQSTM1/p62 turnover. We show that PC3AR+ cells expressing ectopic SIM2s have enhanced survival in these conditions. Induction of LC3-II and turnover of SQSTM1/p62 are attenuated in PC3AR+/SIM2s DMOG and hypoxia-treated cells, suggesting that SIM2s may attenuate autophagic cell death processes, perhaps through BNIP3 repression. These data show, for the first time, SIM2s cross-talk on an endogenous HRE. SIM2s' functional interference with HIF1alpha activities on BNIP3 may indicate a novel role for SIM2s in promoting tumourigenesis."

Proper control of osteoclast development and function is important and deregulation of these processes may lead to bone disease, such as osteoporosis. Previous studies have shown that the cytosolic protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 acts as a suppressor of osteoclast differentiation and function, but putative inhibitory receptors that mediate recruitment and activation of SHP-1 in osteoclasts have remained unknown. In the present study, we identify the SHP-1-recruiting inhibitory immunoreceptor signal regulatory protein (SIRP) α as a negative regulator of osteoclast activity. SIRPα is expressed by osteoclasts, and osteoclasts from mice lacking the SIRPα cytoplasmic tail and signaling capacity display enhanced bone resorption in vitro. Consequently, SIRPα-mutant mice have a significantly reduced cortical bone mass. Fur-thermore, osteoclasts from SIRPα-mutant mice show an enhanced formation of actin rings, known to be instrumental in bone resorption. SIRPα mutation did not significantly affect osteoclast formation, implying that the role of SIRPα was limited to the regulation of mature osteoclast function. This identifies SIRPα as a bona fide inhibitory receptor that regulates the bone-resorption activity and supports a concept in which osteoclast function is balanced by the signaling activities of activating and inhibitory immunoreceptors.—Van Beek, E.

https://openalex.org/W2091912122,"Reticulons are a family of highly conserved proteins, localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and involved in different cellular functions, such as intracellular membrane trafficking, apoptosis and nuclear envelope formation. The reticulon protein family consists of four members, but their specific functions are presently poorly understood. RTN-1C overexpression triggers apoptosis, regulating ER stress versus DNA damage-induced cell death in a mutually exclusive way. The different RTN isoforms share a C-terminal reticulon homology domain containing two hydrophobic segments and a 66-amino acid hydrophilic loop. In the C-terminal region of RTN-1C, a unique consensus sequence (GAKRH) has recently been identified, showing 100% identity with the DNA-binding domain of histone H4. In this study, we show that this sequence is essential for RTN-1C-mediated apoptosis. It is noteworthy that the lysine 204 present in this region is post-translationally modified by acetylation and that this event is associated with a significant decrease in histone deacetylase activity and contributes to RTN-1C binding to DNA. These data demonstrate a molecular mechanism by which RTN-1C controls apoptosis and indicate this protein to be a novel potential target for cancer therapy."

To further define molecular mechanisms accompanying the activation of endothelial cells during angiogenesis, we identified genes that were differentially regulated during this process using microarray analyses. In this work, we established a regulatory role for Sushi repeat protein X-linked 2 (Srpx2) in endothelial cell remodeling during angiogenesis. In particular, silencing of Srpx2 using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) specifically attenuated endothe-lial cell migration and delayed angiogenic sprout formation. In vivo, Srpx2 expression was detected in de novo formation of blood vessels in angiogenic tissues by in situ mRNA hybridization and immunostaining. Pulldown experiments identified Srpx2 as a ligand for vascular uPAR, a key molecule involved in invasive migration of angiogenic endothelium. Immunostaining revealed coexpression of the Srpx2 and uPAR on vascular endothelium. These findings suggest that Srpx2 regulates endothelial cell migration and tube formation and provides a new target for modulating angiogenesis.—Miljkovic-Licina, M., Hammel, P., Garrido-Urbani, S., Bradfield, P.

LNX (ligand of Numb protein-X) is a RING finger and four PDZ domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase. LNX serves as a binding platform and may have a role in cell fate determination, but its in vivo functions are unknown. Here we show that Lnx-l (Lnx-like) functions as a critical regulator of dorso-ventral axis formation in zebrafish. Depletion of Lnx-l using specific antisense morpholinos (MOs) caused strong embryonic dorsalization. We identified Bozozok (Boz, also known as Dharma or Nieuwkoid) as a binding partner and substrate of Lnx-l. Boz is a homeodomain-containing transcriptional repressor induced by canonical Wnt signalling that is critical for dorsal organizer formation. Lnx-l induced K48-linked polyubiquitylation of Boz, leading to its proteasomal degradation in human 293T cells and in zebrafish embryos. Dorsalization induced by Boz overexpression was suppressed by raising the level of Lnx-l, but Lnx-l failed to counteract dorsalization caused by mutant Boz lacking a critical motif for Lnx-l binding. Furthermore, dorsalization induced by depletion of Lnx-l was alleviated by attenuation of Boz expression. We conclude that Lnx-l modulates Boz activity to prevent the invasion of ventral regions of the embryo by organizer tissue. These studies introduce a ubiquitin ligase, Lnx-l, as a balancing modulator of axial patterning in the zebrafish embryo."
https://openalex.org/W2104280907,"Cell polarization is essential for processes such as cell migration and asymmetric cell division. A common regulator of cell polarization in most eukaryotic cells is the conserved Rho GTPase, Cdc42. In budding yeast, Cdc42 is activated by a single guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Cdc24. The mechanistic details of Cdc24 activation at the onset of yeast cell polarization are unclear. Previous studies have suggested an important role for phosphorylation of Cdc24, which may regulate activity or function of the protein, representing a key step in the symmetry breaking process.Here, we directly ask whether multisite phosphorylation of Cdc24 plays a role in its regulation. We identify through mass spectrometry analysis over thirty putative in vivo phosphorylation sites. We first focus on sites matching consensus sequences for cyclin-dependent and p21-activated kinases, two kinase families that have been previously shown to phosphorylate Cdc24. Through site-directed mutagenesis, yeast genetics, and light and fluorescence microscopy, we show that nonphosphorylatable mutations of these consensus sites do not lead to any detectable consequences on growth rate, morphology, kinetics of polarization, or localization of the mutant protein. We do, however, observe a change in the mobility shift of mutant Cdc24 proteins on SDS-PAGE, suggesting that we have indeed perturbed its phosphorylation. Finally, we show that mutation of all identified phosphorylation sites does not cause observable defects in growth rate or morphology.We conclude that lack of phosphorylation on Cdc24 has no overt functional consequences in budding yeast. Yeast cell polarization may be more tightly regulated by inactivation of Cdc42 by GTPase activating proteins or by alternative methods of Cdc24 regulation, such as conformational changes or oligomerization."

We generated DLC2-deficient mice to investigate the tumor suppressor role of DLC2 in hepatocarcinogenesis and the function of DLC2 in vivo. In this study, we found that, unlike homologous DLC1, which is essential for embryonic development, DLC2 was dispensable for embryonic development and DLC2-deficient mice could survive to adulthood. We also did not observe a higher incidence of liver tumor formation or diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in DLC2-deficient mice. However, we observed that DLC2-deficient mice were smaller and had less adipose tissue than the wild type mice. These phenotypes were not due to reduction of cell size or defect in adipogenesis, as observed in the 190B RhoGAP-deficient mouse model. Together, these results suggest that deficiency in DLC2 alone does not enhance hepatocarcinogenesis."

In this study, we investigated the functional role of Plk1 in modulating the p53 family member TAp63, resulting in the control of apoptotic cell death in liver tumor cells. Immunoprecipitation and in vitro pull-down assay showed that p63 binds to the kinase domain of Plk1 through its DNA-binding region. in vitro kinase assay indicated that p63 is phosphorylated by Plk1 at Ser-52 of the transactivating (TA) domain. Plk1 decreased the protein stability of TAp63 by its phosphorylation and suppressed TAp63-induced cell death. Furthermore, Plk1 knockdown in p53-mutated liver tumor cells transactivated p53 family downstream effectors, PUMA, p21Cip1/WAF1 and 14-3-3σ, and induced apoptotic cell death. Double knockdown of Plk1/p63 attenuated Plk1 knockdown-induced apoptotic cell death and transactivation. Intriguingly, both Plk1 and p63 are highly expressed in the side population (SP) fraction of liver tumor cells compared to non-SP fraction cells, suggesting the significance of Plk1/TAp63 in the control of cell death in tumor-initiating SP fraction cells.

https://openalex.org/W2102283370,"Cyclin A1 is essential for leukemia progression, and its expression is tightly regulated by acinus, a nuclear speckle protein. However, the molecular mechanism of how acinus mediates cyclin A1 expression remains elusive. Here we show that transcription corepressor CtBP2 directly binds acinus, which is regulated by nerve growth factor (NGF), inhibiting its stimulatory effect on cyclin A1, but not cyclin A2, expression in leukemia. NGF, a cognate ligand for the neurotrophic receptor TrkA, promotes the interaction between CtBP2 and acinus through triggering acinus phosphorylation by Akt. Overexpression of CtBP2 diminishes cyclin A1 transcription, whereas depletion of CtBP2 abolishes NGF's suppressive effect on cyclin A1 expression. Strikingly, gambogic amide, a newly identified TrkA agonist, potently represses cyclin A1 expression, thus blocking K562 cell proliferation. Moreover, gambogic amide ameliorates the leukemia progression in K562 cells inoculated nude mice. Hence, NGF downregulates cyclin A1 expression through escalating CtBP2/acinus complex formation, and gambogic amide might be useful for human leukemia treatment."

The calmodulin-binding domain (CaMBD) region of Nicotiana tabacum MAPK phosphatase has an amino acid sequence that does not resemble the CaMBD of any other known Ca(2+)-CaM-binding proteins. Using a unique fusion protein strategy, we have been able to obtain a high resolution solution structure of the complex of soybean Ca(2+)-CaM4 (SCaM4) and this CaMBD. Complete isotope labeling of both parts of the complex in the fusion protein greatly facilitated the structure determination by NMR. The 12-residue CaMBD region was found to bind exclusively to the C-lobe of SCaM4. A specific Trp and Leu side chain are utilized to facilitate strong binding through a novel ""double anchor"" motif. Moreover, the orientation of the helical peptide on the surface of Ca(2+)-SCaM4 is distinct from other known complexes. The N-lobe of Ca(2+)-SCaM4 in the complex remains free for additional interactions and could possibly act as a calcium-dependent adapter protein. Signaling through the MAPK pathway and increases in intracellular Ca(2+) are both hallmarks of the plant stress response, and our data support the notion that coordination of these responses may occur through the formation of a unique CaM-MAPK phosphatase multiprotein complex."

To identify proteins associating with MT1-MMP in different types of tumor cells, we first studied conditions for cell lysis using malignant melanoma A375 cells and following purification method of the proteins as reported recently (17Tomari T. Koshikawa N. Uematsu T. Shinkawa T. Hoshino D. Egawa N. Isobe T. Seiki M. Cancer Sci. 2009; 100: 1284-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Proteins purified in this manner were analyzed by high-throughput proteomic analysis (18Gavin A.C. Bösche M. Krause R. Grandi P. Marzioch M. Bauer A. Schultz J. Rick J.M. Michon A.M. Cruciat C.M.

Interestingly, approximately one-half of the membrane proteins identified in our previous study could be cleaved by MT1-MMP at least in vitro. Here, we applied this approach to human carcinoma cells (A431) that originate from epidermoid cells and further validated the systemic whole cell analysis method. To evaluate whether the MT1-MMP-associated membrane proteins so identified include physiological targets of MT1-MMP activity, we select one of them, Lutheran blood group glycoprotein (Lu), and evaluate its processing in A431 cells. The human epidermoid carcinoma cell line A431 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), and the African green monkey kidney cell line COS-7 was obtained from Health Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan). MT1-MMP constructs were prepared as previously described (14Kajita M. Itoh Y. Chiba T. Mori H. Okada A. Kinoh H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Catalytically inactive MT1-MMP mutant (MT1 E/A) has a substitution of Ala for Glu240 in the active site as reported previously (22Itoh Y. Takamura A. Ito N. Maru Y. Sato H. Suenaga N. Aoki T. Seiki M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4782-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). A cDNA sequence corresponding to the open reading frame of human Lu was amplified using PCR. Expression constructs for C-terminally FLAG-tagged Lu were generated as previously described using the Gateway system (Invitrogen) (23Egawa N. Koshikawa N. Tomari T. Nabeshima K. Isobe T. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37576-37585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For inducible expression of wild-type or catalytically inactive MT1-MMP mutant (MT1 E/A) in A431 cells we used the RevTet-OffTM Gene Expression Systems (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. MMI270 (a synthetic hydroxamic MMP inhibitor, a kind gift of Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland) (24MacPherson L.J. Bayburt E.K. Capparelli M.P. Carroll B.J. Goldstein R. Justice M.R. Zhu L.

Chem. 1997; 40: 2525-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) was added when the medium was changed 24 h after transfection. A431 cells that stably expressed FLAG-tagged MT1-MMP were gently lysed by a lysis buffer containing 1% (w/v) Brij-98 as described previously (17Tomari T. Koshikawa N. Uematsu T. Shinkawa T. Hoshino D. Egawa N. Isobe T. Seiki M. Cancer Sci. 2009; 100: 1284-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Lysate containing the FLAG-tagged MT1-MMP was subjected to affinity purification using a column packed with agarose beads conjugated to the anti-FLAG M2 antibody. Proteins bound to the column were eluted with successive fractions of buffer containing increasing concentrations of NaCl followed by elution buffer containing FLAG peptide (17Tomari T. Koshikawa N. Uematsu T. Shinkawa T. Hoshino D. Egawa N. Isobe T. Seiki M. Cancer Sci. 2009; 100: 1284-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To label the cell surface proteins with biotin, cells were incubated with sulfo-LC-NHS-biotin (Pierce) at 0.1 mg/ml for 30 min at 4 °C. The reaction was terminated by washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline (+). The eluted fractions were digested with endoproteinase Lys-C, and subjected to Nano-Flow liquid chromatography (nano-LC), which was linked online to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The details of the system were previously described (17Tomari T. Koshikawa N. Uematsu T. Shinkawa T. Hoshino D. Egawa N. Isobe T. Seiki M. Cancer Sci. 2009; 100: 1284-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All MS/MS spectra were correlated with a search engine, Mascot program (Matrix Science), against the non-redundant protein sequence data base at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. We followed the criteria used for match acceptance as described previously (21Natsume T. Yamauchi Y. Nakayama H. Shinkawa T. Yanagida M. Takahashi N. Isobe T. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 4725-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). When the match scores exceeded 10 above the threshold, identifications were accepted without further consideration. When scores were lower than 10 or identifications were based on single matched MS/MS spectra, we manually inspected the raw data for confirmation prior to acceptance. Peptides assigned by less than three y series ions and those with a +4 charge state were all eliminated regardless of scores. Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates prepared with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (v/w) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (v/w) SDS) and using agarose beads conjugated to an anti-FLAG M2 antibody was performed as previously described (23Egawa N. Koshikawa N. Tomari T. Nabeshima K. Isobe T. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37576-37585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Proteins in the conditioned medium were precipitated with 10% (v/w) trichloroacetic acid, and prepared for SDS-PAGE. Total cell lysates (trichloroacetic acid), immunoprecipitated products, proteins in the conditioned medium, and purified laminin-511 were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing or non-reducing conditions. Western blot analysis was performed as previously described (23Egawa N. Koshikawa N. Tomari T. Nabeshima K. Isobe T. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37576-37585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies included an anti-human MT1-MMP mouse monoclonal antibody (222-1D8, Daiichi-fine-Chemical, Takaoka, Japan), an anti-FLAG M2 mouse monoclonal antibody, an anti-FLAG rabbit polyclonal antibody (Sigma), an anti-human Lu goat polyclonal antibody (AF148, R & D Systems), an anti-c-Myc mouse monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science), an anti-FAS Ligand mouse monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences), an anti-transferrin receptor mouse monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen), and an anti-CD44 rabbit polyclonal antibody (prepared as previously described (14Kajita M. Itoh Y. Chiba T. Mori H. Okada A. Kinoh H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar)). The secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). The ECL Plus Western blot detection system (Amersham Biosciences) was used for development of the blots. We established HEK293 cells expressing laminin α5 (C-FLAG-tagged), β1 and γ1 (25Kikkawa Y.

Purification of recombinant laminin-511 was performed as previously described (26El Nemer W. Gane P. Colin Y. Bony V. Rahuel C. Galactéros F. Cartron J.P. Le Van Kim C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16686-16693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated on ice with the primary antibody followed by the secondary antibody for 30 min each. In the laminin-511 binding assay, cells were incubated with 20 μg/ml purified laminin-511 on ice for 30 min prior to application of the primary antibody. Samples were analyzed with FACS Aria (BD Biosciences). The primary antibodies used were an anti-human Lu mouse monoclonal antibody (BRIC221) (AbD), an anti-FLAG M2 mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma). The secondary antibodies used were an Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, an Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and an Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Invitrogen). The entry and destination vectors were generated according to the manufacturer's instruction using a BLOCK-it U6 Entry Vector Kit and the Gateway system (Invitrogen). Lu knockdown cells were established using the Virapower lentiviral expression system (Invitrogen), and the cells were maintained in the presence of 10 μg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen). Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting MT1-MMP mRNA was designed and prepared by B-Bridge (Sunnyvale, CA), and transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine RNAi MAX Reagent (Invitrogen). The conditioned medium or cells were harvested 72 h after transfection. To isolate proteins associating with MT1-MMP, we first prepared tetracycline-inducible expression constructs for MT1-MMP FLAG-tagged at either the N (MT1-NF) or C terminus (MT1-CF) (Fig. 1A). To prevent the possible degradation of protein components in the complex by the proteolytic activity of MT1-MMP, we used a catalytically inactive mutant (E/A) containing an amino acid substitution from Glu240 to Ala (E/A) in the catalytic site (22Itoh Y. Takamura A. Ito N. Maru Y. Sato H. Suenaga N. Aoki T. Seiki M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4782-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The viral vectors encoding the tagged MT1-MMPs were transduced into A431 cells as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and stable clones were isolated. Expression of MT1-MMP was induced by the depletion of doxycycline (Dox) in the culture medium, and the identities of the MT1-MMP proteins were confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG antibody. We detected both pro and active forms of MT1-MMP (Fig. 1B, pro and active, respectively). An excessive amount of MT1-MMP to the endogenously expressed protein was induced as presented in supplemental Fig. S1. Protein fragments corresponding to those predicted by autodegradation of MT1-MMP were detected even in cells expressing the E/A mutant (Fig. 1B, fragment), presumably because A431 cells express endogenous MT1-MMP (refer to Fig. 5B).FIGURE 5Processing of Lu by endogenous MT1-MMP in A431 cells. A, domain structure of Lu protein. Lu comprises five Ig-like domains within its extracellular region, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. C-terminally FLAG-tagged Lu (Lu-CF) is also presented. B, shedding of Lu fragments in A431 cells. Proteins in the conditioned medium of A431 cells treated with the indicated siRNA were collected and analyzed by Western blot analysis (bottom panel) using a polyclonal antibody against the extracellular portion of Lu (Lu (pAb)). NT, non-treated; cont., control siRNA; siMT1, siRNA for knockdown of MT1-MMP. Total cell lysates were examined by Western blot analysis using anti-MT1-MMP antibody (top panel), Lu (pAb) (second panel), and anti-actin antibody (third panel). Knockdown of MT1-MMP in the cells diminished the amount of the shed Lu fragment with smaller apparent molecular weight (arrowhead). C, processing of Lu-CF by MT1-MMP in COS-7 cells. Lu-CF and MT1-MMP (MT1) were expressed in the cells in the indicated combinations, and cell lysates were analyzed by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG antibody. Total cell lysate (TCL) were examined for MT1-MMP expression using anti-MT1-MMP antibody. D, amino acid sequence of the cleavage site and design of a non-cleavable Lu mutant (mLu-CF). Two amino acids flanking the original Lu cleavage site were substituted by alanine. E, processing of mLu-CF was tested in COS-7 cells and analyzed by immunoprecipitation/Western blotting using an anti-FLAG antibody. The fragment processed by MT1-MMP is indicated by an arrowhead.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We examined different detergents for preparation of the cell lysate and determined to use Brij-98, because this reagent does not disrupt the reported association between MT1-MMP and CD44 (14Kajita M. Itoh Y. Chiba T. Mori H. Okada A. Kinoh H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 27Suenaga N. Mori H. Itoh Y. Seiki M. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Cleared lysate was applied to an affinity column packed with agarose beads conjugated to an anti-FLAG M2 antibody (refer to “Experimental Procedures” for a detailed purification procedure). The column was washed with increasing concentrations of NaCl, and finally the proteins bound to the beads were eluted with a FLAG peptide. Aliquots of each step sample were examined by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining after SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A). Most of the proteins that were nonspecifically retained in the column were eluted with washing buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl. The major polypeptides detected by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining in the final elution fraction corresponded to MT1-MMP, because they could be detected by Western blot analysis using an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2B). Unexpectedly, we observed autodegraded MT1-MMP fragments in the final FLAG eluate fraction even when we used cells expressing MT1-NF (Fig. 2A). We speculate that this is due to the ability of MT1-MMP to form homophilic dimers through the hemopexin-like domain (HPX), as we reported previously (22Itoh Y. Takamura A. Ito N. Maru Y. Sato H. Suenaga N. Aoki T. Seiki M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4782-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Multiple proteins in the final elution became visible with silver staining (Fig. 2C, left). The proteins that eluted with MT1-MMP showed a distinct pattern from that of the starting material. Almost no proteins were detected in the elution fraction from lysates prepared from non-induced cells (Dox(+)). We further examined whether a specific set of membrane proteins eluted with MT1-MMP by labeling them with biotin prior to cell lysis and affinity purification. The labeled proteins were detected by Western blot analysis using Avidin-horseradish peroxidase (Fig. 2C, right). Only a distinct subset of cell surface proteins eluted with MT1-MMP. We next subjected the membrane proteins that eluted with MT1-MMP to Western blot analysis using antibodies specific for CD44 and the transferrin receptor, which have both been reported to interact with MT1-MMP (Fig. 2D) (14Kajita M. Itoh Y. Chiba T. Mori H. Okada A. Kinoh H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 15Nakamura H. Suenaga N. Taniwaki K. Matsuki H. Yonezawa K. Fujii M. Okada Y. Seiki M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 876-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We detected both CD44 and transferrin receptor in the elution fractions prepared from the induced cells. We also probed the blots for FAS ligand (FAS-L), which has not been reported to associate with MT1-MMP, and we were unable to detect its presence. These results suggest that the proteins in the final elution represent those that associate with MT1-MMP. To identify the proteins associating with MT1-MMP, the final elution fractions for MT1-NF (E/A) and MT1-CF (E/A) were digested with endoproteinase Lys-C and subjected to nano-flow liquid chromatography (nano-LC). The separated peptide fragments were automatically subjected to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) connected to the nano-LC and analyzed using the Mascot program. The validity of each high scoring peptide sequence was confirmed by manual inspection of the corresponding MS/MS spectrum (refer to “Experimental Procedures”). In total, 163 proteins were identified as MT1-MMP-associating proteins (supplemental Table S1), and these were classified into membrane, cytoplasmic, secretory, and unknown proteins (Table 1A). The 64 membrane proteins included adhesion molecules, receptors, transporters, and others (Table 1B). These proteins included known MT1-MMP substrates such as CD44 (14Kajita M. Itoh Y. Chiba T.

We evaluated binding of these FLAG-tagged proteins to MT1-MMP by first co-expressing them individually along with Myc-tagged MT1-MMP in A431 cells. Lysates prepared from the transfected cells were then subjected to immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis. We confirmed co-precipitation of MT1-MMP with each of the 18 selected test proteins (Fig. 3B) as it is expected from co-elution of the test proteins with MT1-MMP from the affinity columns. Interestingly, the ratio of pro and active forms of MT1-MMP that co-precipitated with the test proteins differed for each test protein. This may reflect the subcellular localization of the test proteins that interact with MT1-MMP. Some of these membrane proteins might be cleaved by MT1-MMP. To test this possibility, we co-expressed each of these proteins together with MT1-MMP in A431 cells. Indeed, co-expression of MT1-MMP and the test proteins generated new cleavage fragments in nine cases, and this fragmentation was inhibited by incubation of the cells with a synthetic MMP inhibitor, MMI270. Six representative cases are presented in Fig. 4, and the other twelve cases are presented in supplemental Fig. S2. Processing of JAM-1 was not affected by expression of MT1-MMP, although its processing can be inhibited by MMI270. These results indicate that approximately half of the identified membrane proteins can be cleaved by MT1-MMP"
https://openalex.org/W2002758362,"Laminin-332 (LN-332) is a basement membrane component known to exert a beneficial effect on rat pancreatic beta cells in vitro. In this work, we analyzed the expression of LN-332 in human islets, its expression after inflammatory insults by cytokines, and the molecular mechanisms responsible for this effect. By Western blotting and RT-PCR, we showed that LN-332 was expressed in isolated human islets. By immunofluorescence on pancreas sections, we observed that labeling was confined to endocrine cells in islets. Confocal microscopy analysis on isolated islet cells revealed that labeling was granular but did not colocalize with hormone secretory granules. LN-332 was most abundant in cultured islets compared to freshly isolated islets and was found in culture medium, which suggests that it was secreted by islets. When islets were exposed to interleukin (IL)-1beta, expression and secretion of LN-332 increased as compared to control. No effect was observed with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interferon (IFN)-gamma. LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) activity, inhibited culture- and IL-1beta-induced LN-332 expression in islets. These results show that LN-332, known to have some beneficial effect on beta cells in vitro, is produced and secreted by endocrine islet cells and is up-regulated by stressing conditions such as culture and IL-1beta-exposure."

https://openalex.org/W2026737835,"The T cell leukaemia/lymphoma 1A (TCL1A) oncoprotein plays key roles in several B and T cell malignancies. Lacking enzymatic activity, TCL1A's transforming action was linked to its capacity to co-activate the protein kinase AKT via binding to its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. However, perturbation of AKT signalling alone was recently shown insufficient to explain TCL1A oncogenesis, suggesting that TCL1A has additional cellular partners. Searching for such additional targets, we found that TCL1A binds specifically and directly to the ankyrin domain of IkappaB, the inhibitor of the NF-kappaB transcription factors. Through binding assays and a structural analysis by small angle X-ray scattering, we show that TCL1A and IkappaB interact in yeast-two-hybrid systems, when transiently overexpressed in 293 cells, and as recombinant proteins in vitro. We further establish that the association between TCL1A and IkappaB is compatible with AKT binding to TCL1A, but incompatible with IkappaB binding to NF-kappaB. By interfering with the inhibition of NF-kappaB by IkappaB, TCL1A may increase the concentration of free NF-kappaB molecules sufficiently to trigger expression of anti-apoptotic genes. Thus our data suggest an additional route by which TCL1A might cause cancer."
