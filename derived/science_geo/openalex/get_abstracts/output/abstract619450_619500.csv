https://openalex.org/W2894687190,"Here we present a compendium of single-cell transcriptomic data from the model organism Mus musculus that comprises more than 100,000 cells from 20 organs and tissues. These data represent a new resource for cell biology, reveal gene expression in poorly characterized cell populations and enable the direct and controlled comparison of gene expression in cell types that are shared between tissues, such as T lymphocytes and endothelial cells from different anatomical locations. Two distinct technical approaches were used for most organs: one approach, microfluidic droplet-based 3'-end counting, enabled the survey of thousands of cells at relatively low coverage, whereas the other, full-length transcript analysis based on fluorescence-activated cell sorting, enabled the characterization of cell types with high sensitivity and coverage. The cumulative data provide the foundation for an atlas of transcriptomic cell biology."

https://openalex.org/W2895161737,"The emergence of multiple axes is an essential element in the establishment of the mammalian body plan. This process takes place shortly after implantation of the embryo within the uterus and relies on the activity of gene regulatory networks that coordinate transcription in space and time. Whereas genetic approaches have revealed important aspects of these processes1, a mechanistic understanding is hampered by the poor experimental accessibility of early post-implantation stages. Here we show that small aggregates of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), when stimulated to undergo gastrulation-like events and elongation in vitro, can organize a post-occipital pattern of neural, mesodermal and endodermal derivatives that mimic embryonic spatial and temporal gene expression. The establishment of the three major body axes in these ‘gastruloids’2,3 suggests that the mechanisms involved are interdependent. Specifically, gastruloids display the hallmarks of axial gene regulatory systems as exemplified by the implementation of collinear Hox transcriptional patterns along an extending antero-posterior axis. These results reveal an unanticipated self-organizing capacity of aggregated ESCs and suggest that gastruloids could be used as a complementary system to study early developmental events in the mammalian embryo. Cultures grown from small aggregates of mouse embryonic stem cells can be induced to organize spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression that parallel those of the early embryo, offering a potentially useful system for studying early development."

Previous studies have shown direct antiviral activity of potent HIV-1 Env-specific broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) administered when antiretroviral therapy (ART) was discontinued, but it remains unclear whether bNAbs can target the viral reservoir during ART. Here we show that administration of the V3 glycan-dependent bNAb PGT121 together with the Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist vesatolimod (GS-9620) during ART delayed viral rebound following discontinuation of ART in simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-SF162P3-infected rhesus monkeys in which ART was initiated during early acute infection. Moreover, in the subset of monkeys that were treated with both PGT121 and GS-9620 and that did not show viral rebound after discontinuation of ART, adoptive transfer studies and CD8-depletion studies also did not reveal virus. These data demonstrate the potential of bNAb administration together with innate immune stimulation as a possible strategy for targeting the viral reservoir."

https://openalex.org/W2892606152,"Climate change is shifting the phenological cycles of plants1, thereby altering the functioning of ecosystems, which in turn induces feedbacks to the climate system2. In northern (north of 30° N) ecosystems, warmer springs lead generally to an earlier onset of the growing season3,4 and increased ecosystem productivity early in the season5. In situ6 and regional7–9 studies also provide evidence for lagged effects of spring warmth on plant productivity during the subsequent summer and autumn. However, our current understanding of these lagged effects, including their direction (beneficial or adverse) and geographic distribution, is still very limited. Here we analyse satellite, field-based and modelled data for the period 1982–2011 and show that there are widespread and contrasting lagged productivity responses to spring warmth across northern ecosystems. On the basis of the observational data, we find that roughly 15 per cent of the total study area of about 41 million square kilometres exhibits adverse lagged effects and that roughly 5 per cent of the total study area exhibits beneficial lagged effects. By contrast, current-generation terrestrial carbon-cycle models predict much lower areal fractions of adverse lagged effects (ranging from 1 to 14 per cent) and much higher areal fractions of beneficial lagged effects (ranging from 9 to 54 per cent). We find that elevation and seasonal precipitation patterns largely dictate the geographic pattern and direction of the lagged effects. Inadequate consideration in current models of the effects of the seasonal build-up of water stress on seasonal vegetation growth may therefore be able to explain the differences that we found between our observation-constrained estimates and the model-constrained estimates of lagged effects associated with spring warming. Overall, our results suggest that for many northern ecosystems the benefits of warmer springs on growing-season ecosystem productivity are effectively compensated for by the accumulation of seasonal water deficits, despite the fact that northern ecosystems are thought to be largely temperature- and radiation-limited10. Widespread but contrasting delayed responses of ecosystem productivity to spring warmth across northern ecosystems is inferred from satellite data, with higher areal fractions of adverse effects than beneficial effects."

https://openalex.org/W2895598278,"Deep learning (DL) based solutions have been proposed for interpretation of several imaging modalities including radiography, CT, and MR. For chest radiographs, DL algorithms have found success in the evaluation of abnormalities such as lung nodules, pulmonary tuberculosis, cystic fibrosis, pneumoconiosis, and location of peripherally inserted central catheters. Chest radiography represents the most commonly performed radiological test for a multitude of non-emergent and emergent clinical indications. This study aims to assess accuracy of deep learning (DL) algorithm for detection of abnormalities on routine frontal chest radiographs (CXR), and assessment of stability or change in findings over serial radiographs.We processed 874 de-identified frontal CXR from 724 adult patients (> 18 years) with DL (Qure AI). Scores and prediction statistics from DL were generated and recorded for the presence of pulmonary opacities, pleural effusions, hilar prominence, and enlarged cardiac silhouette. To establish a standard of reference (SOR), two thoracic radiologists assessed all CXR for these abnormalities. Four other radiologists (test radiologists), unaware of SOR and DL findings, independently assessed the presence of radiographic abnormalities. A total 724 radiographs were assessed for detection of findings. A subset of 150 radiographs with follow up examinations was used to asses change over time. Data were analyzed with receiver operating characteristics analyses and post-hoc power analysis.About 42% (305/ 724) CXR had no findings according to SOR; single and multiple abnormalities were seen in 23% (168/724) and 35% (251/724) of CXR. There was no statistical difference between DL and SOR for all abnormalities (p = 0.2-0.8). The area under the curve (AUC) for DL and test radiologists ranged between 0.837-0.929 and 0.693-0.923, respectively. DL had lowest AUC (0.758) for assessing changes in pulmonary opacities over follow up CXR. Presence of chest wall implanted devices negatively affected the accuracy of DL algorithm for evaluation of pulmonary and hilar abnormalities.DL algorithm can aid in interpretation of CXR findings and their stability over follow up CXR. However, in its present version, it is unlikely to replace radiologists due to its limited specificity for categorizing specific findings."
https://openalex.org/W2895418220,"The ability to record transcriptional events within a cell over time would help to elucidate how molecular events give rise to complex cellular behaviours and states. However, current molecular recording technologies capture only a small set of defined stimuli. Here we use CRISPR spacer acquisition to capture and convert intracellular RNAs into DNA, enabling DNA-based storage of transcriptional information. In Escherichia coli, we show that defined stimuli, such as an RNA virus or arbitrary sequences, as well as complex stimuli, such as oxidative stress, result in quantifiable transcriptional records that are stored within a population of cells. We demonstrate that the transcriptional records enable us to classify and describe complex cellular behaviours and to identify the precise genes that orchestrate differential cellular responses. In the future, CRISPR spacer acquisition-mediated recording of RNA followed by deep sequencing (Record-seq) could be used to reconstruct transcriptional histories that describe complex cell behaviours or pathological states."
https://openalex.org/W2892918490,"Quaternary amino acids, in which the α-carbon that bears the amino and carboxyl groups also carries two carbon substituents, have an important role as modifiers of peptide conformation and bioactivity and as precursors of medicinally important compounds1,2. In contrast to enantioselective alkylation at this α-carbon, for which there are several methods3-8, general enantioselective introduction of an aryl substituent at the α-carbon is synthetically challenging9. Nonetheless, the resultant α-aryl amino acids and their derivatives are valuable precursors to bioactive molecules10,11. Here we describe the synthesis of quaternary α-aryl amino acids from enantiopure amino acid precursors by α-arylation without loss of stereochemical integrity. Our approach relies on the temporary formation of a second stereogenic centre in an N'-arylurea adduct12 of an imidazolidinone derivative6 of the precursor amino acid, and uses readily available enantiopure amino acids both as a precursor and as a source of asymmetry. It avoids the use of valuable transition metals, and enables arylation with electron-rich, electron-poor and heterocyclic substituents. Either enantiomer of the product can be formed from a single amino acid precursor. The method is practical and scalable, and provides the opportunity to produce α-arylated quaternary amino acids in multi-gram quantities."

https://openalex.org/W2895478883,"Membrane-bound O-acyltransferases (MBOATs) are a superfamily of integral transmembrane enzymes that are found in all kingdoms of life1. In bacteria, MBOATs modify protective cell-surface polymers. In vertebrates, some MBOAT enzymes—such as acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1—are responsible for lipid biosynthesis or phospholipid remodelling2,3. Other MBOATs, including porcupine, hedgehog acyltransferase and ghrelin acyltransferase, catalyse essential lipid modifications of secreted proteins such as Wnt, hedgehog and ghrelin, respectively4–10. Although many MBOAT proteins are important drug targets, little is known about their molecular architecture and functional mechanisms. Here we present crystal structures of DltB, an MBOAT responsible for the d-alanylation of cell-wall teichoic acid in Gram-positive bacteria11–16, both alone and in complex with the d-alanyl donor protein DltC. DltB contains a ring of 11 peripheral transmembrane helices, which shield a highly conserved extracellular structural funnel extending into the middle of the lipid bilayer. The conserved catalytic histidine residue is located at the bottom of this funnel and is connected to the intracellular DltC through a narrow tunnel. Mutation of either the catalytic histidine or the DltC-binding site of DltB abolishes the d-alanylation of lipoteichoic acid and sensitizes the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis to cell-wall stress, which suggests cross-membrane catalysis involving the tunnel. Structure-guided sequence comparison among DltB and vertebrate MBOATs reveals a conserved structural core and suggests that MBOATs from different organisms have similar catalytic mechanisms. Our structures provide a template for understanding structure–function relationships in MBOATs and for developing therapeutic MBOAT inhibitors. Crystal structures of DltB, a bacterial membrane-bound O-acyltransferase, are reported both alone and in complex with the d-alanyl donor protein DltC."
https://openalex.org/W2894235153,"SS 433 is a binary system containing a supergiant star that is overflowing its Roche lobe with matter accreting onto a compact object (either a black hole or neutron star). Two jets of ionized matter with a bulk velocity of $\sim0.26c$ extend from the binary, perpendicular to the line of sight, and terminate inside W50, a supernova remnant that is being distorted by the jets. SS 433 differs from other microquasars in that the accretion is believed to be super-Eddington, and the luminosity of the system is $\sim10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The lobes of W50 in which the jets terminate, about 40 pc from the central source, are expected to accelerate charged particles, and indeed radio and X-ray emission consistent with electron synchrotron emission in a magnetic field have been observed. At higher energies (>100 GeV), the particle fluxes of $\gamma$ rays from X-ray hotspots around SS 433 have been reported as flux upper limits. In this energy regime, it has been unclear whether the emission is dominated by electrons that are interacting with photons from the cosmic microwave background through inverse-Compton scattering or by protons interacting with the ambient gas. Here we report TeV $\gamma$-ray observations of the SS 433/W50 system where the lobes are spatially resolved. The TeV emission is localized to structures in the lobes, far from the center of the system where the jets are formed. We have measured photon energies of at least 25 TeV, and these are certainly not Doppler boosted, because of the viewing geometry. We conclude that the emission from radio to TeV energies is consistent with a single population of electrons with energies extending to at least hundreds of TeV in a magnetic field of $\sim16$~micro-Gauss."
https://openalex.org/W2895774066,"The successful segregation of germ cells from somatic lineages is vital for sexual reproduction and species survival. In the mouse, primordial germ cells (PGCs), precursors of all germ cells, are induced from the post-implantation epiblast1. Induction requires BMP4 signalling to prospective PGCs2 and the intrinsic action of PGC transcription factors3–6. However, the molecular mechanisms that connect BMP4 to induction of the PGC transcription factors that are responsible for segregating PGCs from somatic lineages are unknown. Here we show that the transcription factor OTX2 is a key regulator of these processes. Downregulation of Otx2 precedes the initiation of the PGC programme both in vitro and in vivo. Deletion of Otx2 in vitro markedly increases the efficiency of PGC-like cell differentiation and prolongs the period of PGC competence. In the absence of Otx2 activity, differentiation of PGC-like cells becomes independent of the otherwise essential cytokine signals, with germline entry initiating even in the absence of the PGC transcription factor BLIMP1. Deletion of Otx2 in vivo increases PGC numbers. These data demonstrate that OTX2 functions repressively upstream of PGC transcription factors, acting as a roadblock to limit entry of epiblast cells to the germline to a small window in space and time, thereby ensuring correct numerical segregation of germline cells from the soma. The transcription factor OTX2 ensures that germline induction is initially kept in check and only proceeds after OTX2 downregulation."

https://openalex.org/W2981621999,"The retroviral restriction factor tripartite motif-containing 5α (Trim5α) acts during the early postentry stages of the retroviral life cycle to block infection by a broad range of retroviruses, disrupting reverse transcription and integration. The mechanism of this restriction is poorly understood, but it has recently been suggested to involve recruitment of components of the autophagy machinery, including members of the mammalian autophagy-related 8 (ATG8) family involved in targeting proteins to the autophagosome. To better understand the molecular details of this interaction, here we utilized analytical ultracentrifugation to characterize the binding of six ATG8 isoforms and determined the crystal structure of the Trim5α Bbox coiled-coil region in complex with one member of the mammalian ATG8 proteins, autophagy-related protein LC3 B (LC3B). We found that Trim5α binds all mammalian ATG8s and that, unlike the typical LC3-interacting region (LIR) that binds to mammalian ATG8s through a β-strand motif comprising approximately six residues, LC3B binds to Trim5α via the α-helical coiled-coil region. The orientation of the structure demonstrated that LC3B could be accommodated within a Trim5α assembly that can bind the retroviral capsid. However, mutation of the binding interface does not affect retroviral restriction. Comparison of the typical linear β-strand LIR with our atypical helical LIR reveals a conservation of the presentation of residues that are required for the interaction with LC3B. This observation expands the range of LC3B-binding proteins to include helical binding motifs and demonstrates a link between Trim5α and components of the autophagosome."

Using a combination of X-ray crystallography and NMR analyses, we further show that GH107 family enzymes share features of their structures and catalytic mechanisms with GH29 α-l-fucosidases.

Biochemical characterization of FcnA revealed it to endo-hydrolytically depolymerize a class two fucoidan from Pelvetia canaliculata by hydrolysis of the α(1–4)-glycosidic linkage within the repeating motifs [→4)-α-l-fucopyranosyl-2,3-disulfate-(1–3)-α-l-fucopyranosyl-2-sulfate-(1→]n. Currently, there are seven other members of family GH107, including two patented sulfated fucan hydrolases, referred to as Fda1 and Fda2 from the marine bacterium Alteromonas sp. SN-1009 (21Takayama, M., Koyama, N., Sakai, T., and Kato, I., (December 3, 2002) Enzymes capable of degrading a sulfated-fucose-containing polysaccharide and their encoding genes, U. S.

Although fucoidan depolymerizing enzymes have been identified, the molecular basis of their action remains largely uninvestigated. In this study we focus on three GH107 family enzymes, FcnA, which we will specify as MfFcnA, and two newly identified members, P5AFcnA and P19DFcnA, from marine Psychromonas species SW5A and SW19D, respectively. Here we show that P5AFcnA and P19DFcnA show activity on fucoidans from Laminaria hyperborea and Macrocystis pyrifera, thus distinguishing them from MfFcnA, which lacks activity on these substrates. To probe the molecular basis of fucoidan activity and provide some potential insight into the differential specificity of this enzyme family, we determined the full structure of P5AFcnA and catalytically active fragments of MfFcnA by X-ray crystallography. This revealed structural similarities to GH29 α-l-fucosidases and the proposal of a catalytic mechanism that retains the stereochemistry of the substrate at C1 of the hydrolyzed bond, support for which was provided by NMR analyses. Although the catalytic machinery is conserved throughout the family, including the unusual use of a histidine residue as the proposed catalytic acid/base, the structural data point to nonconserved subsites outside of the primary −1 subsite as possible key contributors to determining the specificity of GH107 enzymes for different fucoidan substructures. MfFcnA is the founding member of GH107 and the canonical example of an endo-fucoidanase. The activity of this enzyme, however, was only reported on fucoidan from one source, and subsequent to this report, no characterization of additional members of GH107 have been reported. Therefore, we sought to provide additional assessment of substrate specificity within the GH107 family with MfFcnA serving as our standard. Because it is a relatively large, multimodular protein, we based our initial truncation comprising residues Gln29–Thr794 on the construct of Colin et al. (19Colin S. Deniaud E. Jam M. Descamps V. Chevolot Y. Kervarec N. Yvin J.-C. Barbeyron T. Michel G. Kloareg B. Cloning and biochemical characterization of the fucanase FcnA: definition of a novel glycoside hydrolase family specific for sulfated fucans.Glycobiology. 2006; 16 (16880504): 1021-103210.1093/glycob/cwl029Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), which we refer to as MfFcnA2 (Fig. 1A), and produced this in Escherichia coli. In the genome sequences of two newly isolated fucoidanolytic marine Psychromonas sp., we identified two genes encoding proteins that we refer to as P5AFcnA and P19DFcnA. These are 403-amino acid proteins, including predicted 15-amino acid secretion signal peptides, which display 81% amino acid sequence identity to one another. Initial annotation of these proteins indicated identity (E values of ∼10−8) with proteins classified as GH107 enzymes and no identity with other GH families. More detailed comparison of P5AFcnA and P19DFcnA with members of GH107, including MfFcnA, yielded amino acid identities between 16 and 21%. Although the identities of P5AFcnA and P19DFcnA with the canonical GH107 MfFcnA were comparatively low, they were suggestive of membership in GH107 and possible fucoidanase activity. P5AFcnA and P19DFcnA were produced as recombinant proteins in E. coli with only their predicted secretion signal peptides truncated (Fig. 1B). To assess the activity of recombinant MfFcnA2, P5AFcnA, and P19DFcnA against fucoidans originating from a variety of algal sources, we used carbohydrate-PAGE (C-PAGE) (Fig. 2). Consistent with previous reports, MfFcnA2 was capable of degrading fucoidan, and displayed activity on fucoidan from Chorda filum and fucoidan from Ascophyllum nodosum (Fig. 2). It also showed some capacity to degrade fucoidan from Saccharina japonica (previously known as Laminaria japonica) (Fig. 2), which is a complex and highly variable fucoidan that contains both class 1 and 2 backbone structures. P5AFcnA and P19DFcnA both showed the capacity to degrade fucoidans, supporting assignment of fucoidanase activity and membership in family GH107 (Fig. 2). They qualitatively displayed the same specificity for fucoidans from L. hyperborea and M. pyrifera, with apparently some limited ability to degrade fucoidans from S. japonica and C. filum (Fig. 2). The distinct laddering pattern observed upon treatment of fucoidan from L. hyperborea with either P5AFcnA and P19DFcnA implies endo-fucoidanase activity. In an effort to provide molecular insight into fucoidan degradation by GH107 enzymes, we made extensive attempts at crystallizing P5AFcnA and P19DFcnA. We were successful in getting X-ray diffraction quality crystals of P5AFcnA. This protein crystallized in the space group P3121 with a single molecule in the asymmetric unit. Phases were initially determined to ∼1.98 Å resolution by a single isomorphous replacement with anomalous signal (SIRAS) experiment using an iodide derivative. The resulting preliminary model was used with a higher resolution 1.55 Å resolution data set to determine the final refined structure. This revealed a single domain organization comprising a (β/α)8-barrel domain (Fig. 3). The (β/α)8-barrel fold contains defects in the secondary structure such that the polypeptide regions corresponding to one of the α-helices and one β-strand do not form regular secondary structures and are better described as random coil. Electron density for one metal ion, which was modeled as Ca2+, was found weakly bound to the loop leading into α-helix 7 and was coordinated by one nitrogen ligand from Lys259 and one water molecule (Fig. 3). Initial attempts at crystallizing MfFcnA2 were unsuccessful, and we reasoned that this was likely due to our inability to purify the protein as a fully intact and homogeneous protein. To explore potential regions of disorder in MfFcnA2 and possibly inform the generation of constructs that could be crystallized, we performed a hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) MS analysis of MfFcnA2. This highlighted a highly dynamic region at the C terminus comprising residues Thr731–Thr769 (Fig. 4A). Subsequently, a new construct was designed, MfFcnA4, which comprised resides Gln29–Ser734 (Fig. 1A). This new construct could be purified as a stable, homogeneous polypeptide and produced crystals of X-ray–diffraction quality. MfFcnA4 crystallized in the space group P3121 with a single molecule in the asymmetric unit. The phases were initially determined to ∼2.8 Å resolution by a SIRAS experiment using an iodide derivative. The resulting preliminary model was used with a higher resolution 2.2 Å resolution data set to determine the final refined structure. This revealed a four-domain organization comprising a large N-terminal (β/α)8-barrel domain, which displayed a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 2.21 Å over 287 aligned residues and 24% sequence identity when compared with the P5AFcnA structure (Fig. 4, B and C). This N-terminal domain, which we will refer to as D1, also contained the same secondary structure defects as P5AFcnA. In MfFcnA4 the D1 domain is linked to three consecutive Ig-like domains that wrap around the D1 domain (Fig. 4, B and C). Electron density for two well defined metal ions, modeled as Ca2+ (based on coordination geometry, protein ligands, and refined B-factor), was found in the N-terminal domain. One Ca2+ (Ca1) was found bound to the loop leading into α-helix 5 and was octahedrally coordinated by five oxygen ligands from the protein (side chains of Asp330, Asn335, and Asp336; backbone carbonyls of Phe327 and Arg332) and one water molecule (Fig. 4B). The second and likely more weakly bound Ca2+ (Ca2) was found near the C terminus of α-helix 7. This was also octahedrally coordinated but by four water molecules and two oxygen ligands: one from the carboxylate of Asp79 and the other from the backbone carbonyl of Thr77 in the protein (Fig. 4B). As noted by Colin et al. (19Colin S. Deniaud E. Jam M. Descamps V. Chevolot Y. Kervarec N. Yvin J.-C. Barbeyron T. Michel G. Kloareg B. Cloning and biochemical characterization of the fucanase FcnA: definition of a novel glycoside hydrolase family specific for sulfated fucans.Glycobiology. 2006; 16 (16880504): 1021-103210.1093/glycob/cwl029Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) the three repeating domains, referred to as R1 to R3, following D1 had folds consistent with membership in the immunoglobulin-like superfamily with each domain binding a calcium atom at an apical end (Fig. 4, B and C). The pairwise amino acid sequence identities range from 27 to 48%, whereas the structural superimposition gives RMSD values of 1.6 Å (R1 cf. R2), 1.7 Å (R1 cf. R3), and 0.7 (R2 cf. R3) Å. The high frequency of carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM) in carbohydrate-active enzymes, combined with the observation that these often have Ig-like folds, lends to the idea that the repeated domains in MfFcnA4 may be CBMs (22Boraston A.B. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Carbohydrate-binding modules: fine-tuning polysaccharide recognition.Biochem.

However, CBMs invariably employ carbohydrate-binding sites with solvent-exposed aromatic amino acid side chains (22Boraston A.B. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J.

Structure similarity searches using the DALI server (24Holm L. Laakso L.M.

Chen Y. et al.Structural insights into SraP-mediated Staphylococcus aureus adhesion to host cells.PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10 (24901708)e100416910.1371/journal.ppat.1004169Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) (PDB codes 4M00 and 4M03). R1 shows structural similarity to the C-terminal module CDHL-2 (PDB code 4M03) (25% identity over 85 residues, with a RMSD of 2.0 Å). R2 and R3 show structural similarity to the CDHL-1 module (PDB code 4M00) (22 and 24% identity over 92 and 86 residues, with a RMSD of 2.8 Å and 2.1 Å, respectively). The CDHL modules, which resemble calcium-dependent eukaryotic cadherins, function as a relatively rigid stem to extend the N-terminal lectin module of the glycoprotein outwards from the S. aureus cell surface. Like the R domains in MfFcnA, the CDHL modules bind one Ca2+ ion per module and are suggested to facilitate structural rigidity to adopt the extended conformation in solution (25Yang Y.H. Jiang Y.L. Zhang J. Wang L. Bai X.H. Zhang S.J. Ren Y.M. Li N. Zhang Y.H. Zhang Z. Gong Q. Mei Y. Xue T. Zhang J.R. Chen Y. et al.Structural insights into SraP-mediated Staphylococcus aureus adhesion to host cells.PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10 (24901708)e100416910.1371/journal.ppat.1004169Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). On this basis we propose that the R1–R3 domains could be carrying out a similar function whereby the R modules constitute a structural spacer separating the D1 catalytic domain from the unknown C-terminal domain. We made extensive attempts to generate a structure of MfFcnA4 in complex with fucoidan oligosaccharides purified after treatment of C. filum fucoidan with this enzyme. These attempts were unsuccessful, and we reasoned this to be largely because of occlusion of the active site in the crystal packing of the existing crystal form and an inability to generate alternative crystal forms. To obtain a construct that might crystallize differently, we designed a truncation based on the MfFcnA4 structure comprising only the D1–R2 domains (amino acids Gln29–Asp623), which we called MfFcnA9 (Fig. 1A). Recombinant purified MfFcnA9 crystallized and its structure was determined; however, we were again unable to generate the structure of the bound complex. Nevertheless, a comparison of the MfFcnA9 coordinates with MfFcnA4 provided insight into the conformational preference of the composite domains in these polypeptides. An overlay of the two structures revealed a RMSD of 0.65 Å over all of the residues present in the MfFcnA9 model (Fig. 4D). Notably, the two different crystal forms of MfFcnA4 and MfFcnA9 had quite different crystallographic environments, suggesting that the very similar arrangements of the first three domains (D1–R2) in these different truncations of MfFcnA represent a configuration that is consistently stabilized by the interdomain interfaces. The R3 domain in MfFcnA4, however, is fully solvent-exposed, suggesting that the terminal domain in this construct may be somewhat flexible (Fig. 4D). Supporting this is the observation that the average B-factor for R3 was ∼10 Å2 (or ∼20%) higher than for the R1 and R2 domains, which were otherwise similar. Comparative structural analysis of the D1 domain of MfFcnA and P5AFcnA using the DALI server revealed the majority of the most structurally similar proteins to belong to GH family 29 with the closest structural homologue to both proteins (RMSD of 3.0 Å with 13% identity over 459 residues of MfFcnA4 and RMSD of 3.8 Å with 12% identity over 459 residues of P5AFcnA) being an α-l-fucosidase from Bacteroides thetaiotamicron (BT2192; PDB code 4OZO) (26Guillotin L. Lafite P. Daniellou R. Unraveling the substrate recognition mechanism and specificity of the unusual glycosyl hydrolase family 29 BT2192 from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron.Biochemistry. 2014; 53 (24527659): 1447-145510.1021/bi400951qCrossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Enzymes from glycoside hydrolase family 29 typically have α(1–2), α(1–3), α(1–4), or α(1–6) α-l-fucosidase activity and largely act on the nonreducing termini of fucosylated glycans. However, it has been speculated that certain α-l-fucosidases may participate in the degradation of algal fucoidan by removing α(1–2)- and/or α(1–4)-linked fucosyl side chains from the polysaccharide (18Sulzenbacher G.

Despite extensive attempts to generate structures of substrate and/or product complexes of GH107s, we were unable to do so.

Some 1,085 (1,085/7,895 = 13.7%) cardiovascular ADRs were reported, being conduction abnormalities and EKG alterations the most frequently identified.EV data may support the levels of concern relating to loperamide potential of abuse and associated cardiotoxicity issues."
https://openalex.org/W2894635770,"In environments experiencing fast technological change in which innovative performance is expected, work design research has found that the degree of autonomy positively predicts behavioral and attitudinal work outcomes. Because extant work design research has tended to examine the direct and mediating effects of autonomy on work outcomes such as job satisfaction, examinations of more situational elements and the degree to which the organizational context strengthens or weakens this relationship has been neglected. This study, therefore, takes a context-contingent perspective to investigate the degree to which psychological climate dimensions such as supervisor support, organizational structure and organizational innovation moderate the effects of autonomy (work scheduling autonomy, work methods autonomy, decision-making autonomy) on employee perceived innovative work behavior (IWB). Using a conjoint experiment based on 9,440 assessments nested within 1,180 employees, it was found that all autonomy dimensions had a significant direct effect on employee perceived IWB. Contrary to the Hypotheses, the multi-level analysis did not reveal any moderating effect of the climate dimensions on the relationship between autonomy and employee IWB. This study provides a context-contingent view for the features of work design and gives a more detailed analysis of autonomy, which has previously been seen primarily as a unidimensional construct."

The same set of E2s stimulate the deubiquitinating activity of OTUB1 when the E2 is not charged with ubiquitin. Previous studies have shown that, in cells, OTUB1 binds to E2-conjugating enzymes of the UBE2D (UBCH5) and UBE2E families, as well as to UBE2N (UBC13). Cellular roles have been identified for the interaction of OTUB1 with UBE2N and members of the UBE2D family, but not for interactions with UBE2E E2 enzymes. We report here a novel role for OTUB1–E2 interactions in modulating E2 protein ubiquitination. We observe that Otub1−/− knockout mice exhibit late-stage embryonic lethality. We find that OTUB1 depletion dramatically destabilizes the E2-conjugating enzyme UBE2E1 (UBCH6) in both mouse and human OTUB1 knockout cell lines. Of note, this effect is independent of the catalytic activity of OTUB1, but depends on its ability to bind to UBE2E1. We show that OTUB1 suppresses UBE2E1 autoubiquitination in vitro and in cells, thereby preventing UBE2E1 from being targeted to the proteasome for degradation.

Enzymes in the had operon from the bacterium Ralstonia pickettii DTP0602 have the potential for application as biocatalysts in the degradation of many of these toxic chemicals. HadA monooxygenase previously was identified as a two-component reduced FAD (FADH−)–utilizing monooxygenase with dual activities of dehalogenation and denitration. However, the partner enzymes of HadA, that is, the flavin reductase and quinone reductase that provide the FADH− for HadA and reduce quinone to hydroquinone, remain to be identified. In this report, we overexpressed and purified the flavin reductases, HadB and HadX, to investigate their functional and catalytic properties. Our results indicated that HadB is an FMN-dependent quinone reductase that converts the quinone products from HadA to hydroquinone compounds that are more stable and can be assimilated by downstream enzymes in the pathway. Transient kinetics indicated that HadB prefers NADH and menadione as the electron donor and acceptor, respectively. We found that HadX is an FAD-bound flavin reductase, which can generate FADH− for HadA to catalyze dehalogenation or denitration reactions. Thermodynamic and transient kinetic experiments revealed that HadX prefers to bind FAD over FADH− and that HadX can transfer FADH− from HadX to HadA via free diffusion. Moreover, HadX rapidly catalyzed NADH-mediated reduction of flavin and provided the FADH− for a monooxygenase of a different system. Combination of all three flavin-dependent enzymes, i.e. HadA/HadB/HadX, reconstituted an effective dehalogenation and denitration cascade, which may be useful for future bioremediation applications."
https://openalex.org/W2952977500,"High-fat (HF) diets in combination with sedentary lifestyle represent one of the major public health concerns predisposing to obesity and diabetes leading to skeletal muscle atrophy, decreased fiber diameter and muscle mass with accumulation of fat tissue resulting in loss of muscle strength. One strategy to overcome the maleficent effects of HF diet is resistance training, a strategy used to improve muscle mass, reverting the negative effects on obesity-related changes in skeletal muscle. Together with resistance training, supplementation with creatine monohydrate (CrM) in the diet has been used to improve muscle mass and strength. Creatine is a non-essential amino acid that is directly involved in the cross-bridge cycle providing a phosphate group to ADP during the initiation of muscle contraction. Besides its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects CrM also upregulates IGF-1 resulting in hyperthophy with an increase in muscle function. However, it is unknown whether CrM supplementation during resistance training would revert the negative effects of high-fat diet on the muscle performance. During 8 weeks we measured muscle performance to climb a 1.1m and 80° ladder with increasing load on trained rats that had received standard diet or high-fat diet, supplemented or not with CrM. We observed that the CrM supplementation up-regulated IGF-1 and phospho-AKT protein levels, suggesting an activation of the IGF1-PI3K-Akt/PKB-mTOR pathway. Moreover, despite the CrM supplementation, HF diet down-regulated several proteins of the IGF1-PI3K-Akt/PKB-mTOR pathway, suggesting that diet lipid content is crucial to maintain or improve muscle function during resistance training."
https://openalex.org/W2895104161,"Postmenopausal osteoporosis is initiated by estrogen withdrawal and is characterized mainly by over-activated osteoclastic bone resorption. Targeting TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) or its downstream signaling pathways to modulate osteoclast formation and function is an appealing strategy for osteoclast-related disorders. In the present study, we determined the effect of tomatidine, a steroidal alkaloid derived from Solanaceae, on the formation and function of receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) ligand-induced osteoclasts and the underlying mechanism. Tomatidine inhibited osteoclast formation in a dose-dependent manner and decreased the expression of osteoclast marker genes. Actin ring formation and osteoclastic bone resorption were attenuated in the presence of tomatidine in vitro. Eight weeks after ovariectomy, tomatidine prevented estrogen deficiency-induced bone loss and restored the mechanical properties of the femur. At the molecular level, tomatidine abrogated phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/p38, NF-κB, and protein kinase B (Akt) pathway proteins by suppressing RANK expression, inhibiting the binding of TRAF6 to RANK, and downregulating the osteoclastogenesis marker-related protein expression. In summary, these data demonstrated that tomatidine attenuated osteoclast formation and function by modulating multiple TRAF6-mediated pathways. Therefore, tomatidine could be a novel candidate for the treatment of osteoclast-related disorders, including osteoporosis.—Hu, B., Sun, X., Yang, Y., Ying, Z., Meng, J., Zhou, C., Jiang, G., Li, S., Wu, F., Zhao, X., Zhu, H., Wu, H., Cai, X., Shi, Z., Yan, S.

https://openalex.org/W2894684938,"Pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli assemble surface structures termed pili, or fimbriae, to mediate binding to host-cell receptors1. Type 1 pili are assembled via the conserved chaperone–usher pathway2–5. The outer-membrane usher FimD recruits pilus subunits bound by the chaperone FimC via the periplasmic N-terminal domain of the usher. Subunit translocation through the β-barrel channel of the usher occurs at the two C-terminal domains (which we label CTD1 and CTD2) of this protein. How the chaperone–subunit complex bound to the N-terminal domain is handed over to the C-terminal domains, as well as the timing of subunit polymerization into the growing pilus, have previously been unclear. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to capture a pilus assembly intermediate (FimD–FimC–FimF–FimG–FimH) in a conformation in which FimD is in the process of handing over the chaperone-bound end of the growing pilus to the C-terminal domains. In this structure, FimF has already polymerized with FimG, and the N-terminal domain of FimD swings over to bind CTD2; the N-terminal domain maintains contact with FimC–FimF, while at the same time permitting access to the C-terminal domains. FimD has an intrinsically disordered N-terminal tail that precedes the N-terminal domain. This N-terminal tail folds into a helical motif upon recruiting the FimC-subunit complex, but reorganizes into a loop to bind CTD2 during handover. Because both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of FimD are bound to the end of the growing pilus, the structure further suggests a mechanism for stabilizing the assembly intermediate to prevent the pilus fibre diffusing away during the incorporation of thousands of subunits. The structure of a pilus assembly intermediate reveals the timing of subunit polymerization and how chaperone–subunit complexes are transferred from N-terminal to C-terminal domains of the usher in the formation of bacterial pili."
https://openalex.org/W2895025115,"Explaining the origin of life requires us to explain how self-replication arises. To be specific, how can a self-replicating entity develop spontaneously from a chemical reaction system in which no reaction is self-replicating? Previously proposed mathematical models either supply an explicit framework for a minimal living system or only consider catalyzed reactions, and thus fail to provide a comprehensive theory. We set up a general model for chemical reaction systems that properly accounts for energetics, kinetics and the conservation law. We find that (1) some systems are collectively-catalytic where reactants are transformed into end products with the assistance of intermediates (as in the citric acid cycle), while some others are self-replicating where different parts replicate each other and the system self-replicates as a whole (as in the formose reaction); (2) many alternative chemical universes often contain one or more such systems; (3) it is possible to construct a self-replicating system where the entropy of some parts spontaneously decreases, in a manner similar to that discussed by Schr\""odinger; (4) complex self-replicating molecules can emerge spontaneously and relatively easily from simple chemical reaction systems through a sequence of transitions. Together these results start to explain the origins of prebiotic evolution."

The methods employed provide a supplementary perspective to that given by the photometric properties of the lighting applications. The study involved 89 participants from two age groups (Young: N: 43, 19-31 yrs.; Elderly: N: 46, 62-77 yrs.). Data were collected in a full-scale laboratory using a mock-up pedestrian pathway. Three lighting applications (one ceramic metal halide and two LED) were presented and the participants' behavior (walking speed), perception (ability to perform visual tasks-recognize facial expressions, detect obstacles, read street signpost), affective response, and evaluation of the lighting quality were assessed. The three lighting applications significantly differed with regard to the human response. The facial expression recognition distance, sign reading distance and the obstacle detection task, along with the evaluation of lighting quality and level of arousal, distinguished one of the LEDs (Correlated Color Temperature: 3810, Color Rendering Index: 75, Scotopic/Photopic ratio: 1.48) from the other two lighting applications-the participants performed better on the visual tasks, and the lighting was perceived as brighter, more arousing and less pleasant. Methods to capture human perception, evaluation and behavior in relation to outdoor lighting, provide a valuable perspective that should be systematically applied when municipalities consider different pedestrian lighting applications."

Here, we report that sirtuin 7 (SIRT7) directly deacetylates WDR77 and that this deacetylation interferes with the WDR77–PRMT5 interaction and suppresses proliferation of human colon cancer HCT116 cells. Using co-expression in HEK293T cells and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we observed that SIRT7 deacetylates WDR77 at Lys-3 and Lys-243, which reduced of WDR77’s interaction with PRMT5. More importantly, this reduction suppressed the transmethylase activity of the WDR77/PRMT5 complex, resulting in a reduction of the H4R3me2 modification. Rescue of the WDR77-KO HCT116 cells with a WDR77–2KR (K3R and K243R) variant yielded cell migration and proliferation rates that were significantly lower than those of WDR77-KO HCT116 cells rescued with WT WDR77.

Sirtuins are a family of NAD+-dependent deacetylases, also identified as class III histone deacetylases (1Hirschey M.D. Old enzymes, new tricks: sirtuins are NAD(+)-dependent deacylases.Cell Metab. 2011; 14 (22100408): 718-71910.1016/j.cmet.2011.10.006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Mammalian sirtuins comprise seven members (SIRT1–SIRT7) that participate in many cellular functions encompassing cellular proliferation, metabolism, genomic stability, and stress responses (2Michan S.

Sirtuins have also been associated with several human diseases and disorders, including cancers, aging, and aging-related disorders, such as hearing-loss and cardiac dysfunction, and metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and fatty liver disease (3Osborne B.

In addition to protecting organisms from tumors by increasing genomic stability and limiting cellular replicative lifespan, Sirtuins can also induce tumorigenesis by promoting cell survival under stress and enhancing uncontrolled cell division (4Taylor D.M.

Interestingly, SIRT7 is reported to be significantly down-regulated in breast cancer lung metastases in humans and mice and predicts metastasis-free survival (11Tang X. Shi L. Xie N. Liu Z. Qian M.

WDR77 is a WD-repeat protein that can interact with protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) 2The abbreviations used are: PRMT5protein arginine methyltransferase 5WDR77WD repeat-containing protein 77TSAtrichostatin AGSTglutathione S-transferaseqPCRquantitative PCRGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseFLfull-lengthPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideaaamino acid(s)NTamino-terminalCTcarboxyl-terminaCBPcAMP-response element-binding protein. and form a higher-order tetrameric complex while acting independently as an androgen receptor cofactor (p44) that is overexpressed in prostate cancer cells (17Hosohata K.

The WDR77/PRMT5 complex catalyzes the methylation of arginines on histones and other proteins. H4R3me2 is an important target of WDR77/PRMT5, but its function and regulation have yet to be fully elucidated. Elevated PRMT5 and WDR77 expression is observed in many cancers and is often correlated with enhanced tumor growth and poor disease prognosis (18Bao X. Zhao S. Liu T. Liu Y. Liu Y. Yang X.

In this study, we demonstrate that SIRT7 can directly deacetylate WDR77 and influence the interaction with PRMT5. More importantly, decreased WDR77–PRMT5 interactions leads to the down-regulation of H4R3me2 levels and can thus restrain cancer cell proliferation. Relatively few SIRT7 targets have been reported in literature. We therefore searched for more potential targets of SIRT7 through purification and MS and found that WDR77 may be a new target of SIRT7 (Fig. 1A). To verify the interaction, we overexpressed tagged SIRT7 and WDR77 in HEK293T cells and performed co-immunoprecipitation assays to confirm the interaction between these two proteins. SIRT7 can co-immunoprecipitate WDR77 (Fig. 1B), and vice versa (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, the interaction of these two proteins was enhanced by the co-expression of histone acetyltransferase CBP (Fig. 1C). The SIRT7–WDR77 interaction was further confirmed by the co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous SIRT7 and WDR77 (Fig. 1, D and E). We also confirmed the SIRT7 and WDR77 interaction by GST pulldown assay. We first generated GST fusion proteins for the assay. WDR77 was divided into 3 segments according to its domains: N terminus (NT, 1–116 aa), central domain (M, 117–250 aa), and C terminus (CT, 251–342 aa). SIRT7 can clearly be pulled down by GST-WDR77 full-length and central domains, but not the N-terminal and C-terminal domains (Fig. 1F), indicating that SIRT7 interacts with WDR77 at its central domain. Taken together, these results demonstrated that SIRT7 interacts with WDR77 both in vivo and in vitro. The interaction between WDR77 and SIRT7 prompted us to consider whether WDR77 is a novel target of SIRT7, especially considering that the interaction is enhanced in the presence of CBP (Fig. 1C). Therefore, we first examined whether WDR77 was acetylated. We co-transfected FLAG-WDR77 with different acetyltransferases in HEK293T cells and incubated the cell lysates with M2 beads to immunoprecipitate WDR77. WDR77 acetylation was detected only when co-transfected with CBP (Fig. 2A), consistent with the results of the interaction studies (Fig. 1C). WDR77 acetylation was more significant in cells treated with nicotinamide than in cells treated with trichostatin A (TSA) (Fig. 2B), suggesting that Sirtuins could be the major deacetylase for WDR77. Using the GST fusion proteins described in Fig. 1F, we performed the in vitro acetylation assay. The results indicated that WDR77 was primarily acetylated at the central region, although weak acetylation was also detected in the N-terminal region (Fig. 2C). To identify the major acetylation sites of WDR77, we purified the acetylated WDR77 from HEK293T cells co-transfected with WDR77 and CBP and performed MS assay. Lysine residues 3, 150, 201, and 243 were detected in the peptides with acetylated K (Fig. 2D), consistent with the in vitro acetylation assay (Fig. 2C). By mutating these 4 lysines to arginine (K3R, K150R, K201R, K243R), we were able to observe significantly reduced acetylation levels for the K243R mutant (Fig. 2E). Because the N-terminal of WDR77 also showed an acetylation signal in the in vitro acetylation assay (Fig. 2C), we generated a construct containing K3R and K243R (2KR), which showed even lower acetylation levels than those of K243R (Fig. 2F). Taken together, these results indicated that WDR77 is acetylated by CBP both in cells and in vitro and that both lysine 3 and lysine 243 are the major acetylation sites of WDR77. We then explored the possibility that SIRT7 deacetylates WDR77. FLAG-WDR77 and different HA-SIRT7 plasmid amounts were co-transfected into HEK293T cells. Western blotting showed that WDR77 acetylation levels decreased with increasing amounts of SIRT7 transfection (Fig. 3A). WDR77 deacetylation by SIRT7 was further confirmed by an in vitro deacetylation assay. We purified and incubated acetylated WDR77 under different conditions. The results revealed that WDR77 was deacetylated only in the presence of both SIRT7 and NAD+, as SIRT7 is a NAD+-dependent deacetylase (Fig. 3B). To further investigate whether WDR77 deacetylation depends on SIRT7 catalytic activity, we co-transfected WDR77 with SIRT7-WT or SIRT7-H187Y, which lacks catalytic activity, and analyzed WDR77 acetylation levels by Western blotting. Although SIRT7-WT was able to deacetylate WDR77, SIRT7-H187Y could not deacetylate WDR77 (Fig. 3C). To provide further insight into the role of SIRT7, we generated SIRT7 knockout cells using CRISPR-Cas9 technology (Fig. 3D) and overexpressed FLAG-WDR77 with CBP in both HCT116 WT and HCT116 SIRT7-KO cells. Western blotting revealed that WDR77 acetylation levels were significantly increased in SIRT7-KO cells compared with SIRT7-WT cells (Fig. 3E). Thus, WDR77 is a novel target of SIRT7, which can deacetylate WDR77 both in cells and in vitro, dependent on SIRT7 catalytic activity. Conversely, depletion of SIRT7 in cells enhanced WDR77 acetylation. As an important component of the WDR77/PRMT5 complex, WDR77 mediates interactions with binding partners and substrates through its interaction with PRMT5 to form an atypical heterooctameric complex (21Antonysamy S. Bonday Z. Campbell R.M. Doyle B. Druzina Z. Gheyi T. Han B. Jungheim L.N. Qian Y. Rauch C. Russell M. Sauder J.M. Wasserman S.R. Weichert K. Willard F.S. Zhang A. Emtage S.

Moreover, WDR77 is reported to interact with PRMT5 through both its N-terminal (Trp-44) and middle region (Phe-289) (22Ho M.C. Wilczek C. Bonanno J.B. Xing L. Seznec J. Matsui T. Carter L.G.

Thus, we investigated whether WDR77 deacetylation affects the interaction with PRMT5. We overexpressed HA-PRMT5 with FLAG-WDR77-WT or FLAG-WDR77–2KR in HEK293T cells and co-immunoprecipitated FLAG-WDR77-WT and FLAG-WDR77–2KR using M2 beads. Western blotting revealed that PRMT5 was pulled down more weakly by WDR77–2KR than by WDR77-WT (Fig. 4A). Endogenous PRMT5 also interacted less strongly with FLAG-WDR77 when we overexpressed HA-tagged SIRT7 in HEK293T cells (Fig. 4B), consistent with the results of the WDR77 deacetylation by SIRT7. Conversely, endogenous WDR77 interacted more tightly with endogenous PRMT5 when SIRT7 was knocked out (Fig. 4C). Thus, the interaction of WDR77 with PRMT5 was affected by WDR77 deacetylation, which is regulated by SIRT7. The effect of SIRT7 on the WDR77–PRMT5 interaction prompted us to further explore the enzymatic activity of this complex. We first generated WDR77-knockout HCT116 cells by CRISPR-Cas9. PRMT5 and H4R3me2 were both down-regulated (Fig. 5A). When stably re-expressing WDR77-WT and WDR77–2KR in WDR77-KO cells, we observed a significant difference in the enzymatic activity of the WDR77/PRMT5 complex by measuring the levels of H4R3me2, a known target of this complex. Although the expression levels of WDR77-WT and WDR77–2KR were almost the same, WDR77–2KR/PRMT5 showed much less activity than WDR77-WT/PRMT5 (Fig. 5A). Recently, PRMT5/WDR77 was reported to regulate cancer cell proliferation through histone H4R3me2 methylation (23Chen H. Lorton B. Gupta V. Shechter D. A TGFβ-PRMT5-MEP50 axis regulates cancer cell invasion through histone H3 and H4 arginine methylation coupled transcriptional activation and repression.Oncogene. 2017; 36 (27270440): 373-38610.1038/onc.2016.205Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus, we measured the mRNA expression of a series of metastasis suppressor genes, which were reported to be regulated by H4R3me2. The results of RT-qPCR showed that these genes were indeed up-regulated in WDR77 knockout cells and that mRNA expression levels of these genes were very different in WDR77-WT and WDR77–2KR cells, consistent with the levels of H4R3me2. The mRNA expression levels of these genes were decreased in WDR77-WT cells but remained at higher levels in WDR77–2KR cells (Fig. 5B). These findings led us to investigate further the difference between WDR77-WT and WDR-2KR in metastasis. We observed that WDR77–2KR cells grew much slower compared with WDR77-WT cells. This observation was confirmed by a cell counting assay. WDR77-WT cells presented nearly the same growth rate as HCT116-WT cells, whereas the WDR77–2KR cells grew much slower and only a little faster than WDR77 KO cells (Fig. 5C). Moreover, we performed a wound-healing assay and demonstrated a significantly reduced rate of closure in the WDR77–2KR cells compared with that in the WDR77-WT cells (Fig. 5D). To examine the anchorage-independent growth behavior, we employed a colony formation assay and observed much less colony formation in WDR77–2KR cells compared with WDR77-WT cells (Fig. 5E). Thus, we identified a different behavior in cell proliferation between WDR77-WT and WDR77–2KR through a knockout-and-rescue approach. Although WDR77-WT and WDR77–2KR expression levels were almost the same (Fig. 5B), WDR77–2KR exerted a weaker effect than WDR77-WT in these assays. To further investigate the role of SIRT7 in cell proliferation, we knocked down SIRT7 in HCT116 cells, WDR77 KO cells, WDR77-WT cells, and WDR77–2KR cells by using siRNAs (Table 1, Fig. 6B) and performed similar assays as presented in Fig. 5. We first measured the mRNA expression of those metastasis suppressor genes detected in Fig. 5B. The results of RT-qPCR showed that these genes were down-regulated in SIRT7 KD cells consistent with the up-regulated levels of H4R3me2 in SIRT7 KO cells (Fig. 6A), and the mRNA expression levels of these genes were decreased in WDR77-WT cells but remained at higher levels in WDR77–2KR cells (Fig. 6C). In the cell counting assay, the WDR77–2KR cells still grew much slower than WDR77-WT cells (Fig. 6D). Moreover, we performed a wound-healing assay and still observed a significantly reduced rate of closure in the WDR77–2KR cells compared with that in the WDR77-WT cells (Fig. 6E). We also observed much less colony formation in WDR77–2KR cells compared with WDR77-WT cells when performing colony formation assays (Fig. 6F). Taken together, these results demonstrated that WDR77 deacetylation influences cancer cell proliferation by altering WDR77/PRMT5 complex activity.Table 1Sequences of siRNAs used in this studyTargetsSequence (5′-3′)hSIRT7CUCACCGUAUUUCUACUACUAhSIRT7GGGAGUACGUGCGGGUGUUhSIRT7CCCUGAAGCUACAUGGGAA Open table in a new tab As the least studied Sirtuin family member, SIRT7 has attracted more attention recently. However, the targets of SIRT7 remain poorly understood. Identifying novel targets is therefore essential to better understand the functions of SIRT7. In this current study, we identified WDR77 as a novel target of SIRT7, and SIRT7 interacts with and deacetylates WDR77. We further identified the major acetylation sites of WDR77 at Lys-3 and Lys-243. WDR77-deficient cells complemented with WDR77–2KR, which mimics hypoacetylated WDR77, displayed a reduced ability to interact with PRMT5 compared with the WDR77-deficient cells complemented with WT WDR77. Significantly, the disruption of the interaction between WDR77 and PRMT5 reduced the PRMT5 enzymatic activity and hence influenced cancer cell proliferation. Our study increased the understanding of functions of SIRT7. The role of SIRT7 in tumor progression remains the subject of debate. On the one hand, Barber et al. (6Barber M.F. Michishita-Kioi E. Xi Y. Tasselli L. Kioi M. Moqtaderi Z. Tennen R.I. Paredes S. Young N.L. Chen K. Struhl K. Garcia B.A. Gozani O. Li W. Chua K.F. SIRT7 links H3K18 deacetylation to maintenance of oncogenic transformation.Nature. 2012; 487 (22722849): 114-11810.1038/nature11043Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) showed that SIRT7 can selectively deacetylate H3K18ac and promote oncogenic transformation and tumor growth. SIRT7 levels are also reportedly elevated in thyroid and breast cancer tissues and may predict poor prognosis in colorectal and prostate cancers (24Yu H. Ye W. Wu J. Meng X. Liu R.Y. Ying X. Zhou Y. Wang H. Pan C. Huang W. Overexpression of sirt7 exhibits oncogenic property and serves as a prognostic factor in colorectal cancer.Clin.

On the other hand, SIRT7 is negatively correlated with the progression of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (26Lai C.C. Lin P.M. Lin S.F. Hsu C.H. Lin H.C. Hu M.L. Hsu C.M. Yang M.Y. Altered expression of SIRT gene family in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.Tumour Biol. 2013; 34: 1847-185410.1007/s13277-013-0726-yCrossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Moreover, previous work demonstrated that SIRT7 can antagonize transforming growth factor β signaling by destabilizing Smad4 to inhibit breast cancer metastasis. Transforming growth factor β signaling is frequently disturbed during tumor progression and metastasis. This complex signaling pathway converges with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition through the altered expression and regulation of key transcription factors. Oncogenic transformation, tumor growth, and metastasis are phenotypically distinct and mechanistically different processes, and SIRT7 seemingly plays a different role in metastasis. This dual role of SIRT7 in tumor development may arise from its various deacetylation targets in different cells, such as H3K18ac, PAF53, p53, NPM1, GABP-β1, and Smad4, with the overt phenotypes being attributed to the combined effects of various targets. Our study showed that SIRT7 may decrease proliferation by deacetylating WDR77 and thereby disrupting the WDR77/PRMT5 complex. WDR77 is a core component of the WDR77/PRMT5 complex, which mediates interactions with binding partners and substrates. Many studies have shown that WDR77 and PRMT5 can regulate each other's expression. Down-regulation or up-regulation of WDR77 results in decreased or increased PRMT5 expression, respectively, which is consistent with our results (Fig. 5A). PRMT5 inhibition or loss disrupts cancer cell phenotypes, and its direct interaction with proteins commonly dysregulated or mutated in cancers indicates that PRMT5 acts as an oncogene. PRMT5-MEP50 is also essential for the transcriptional regulation that promotes cancer cell invasion in lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and breast carcinoma cancer cells (23Chen H. Lorton B. Gupta V. Shechter D. A TGFβ-PRMT5-MEP50 axis regulates cancer cell invasion through histone H3 and H4 arginine methylation coupled transcriptional activation and repression.Oncogene. 2017; 36 (27270440): 373-38610.1038/onc.2016.205Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, the regulation of WDR77 and PRMT5 activity is poorly understood. Our study demonstrates that WDR77/PRMT5 complex formation is indeed important for PRMT5-mediated H4R3 methylation. More importantly, by deacetylating WDR77, SIRT7 regulates WDR77/PRMT5 complex activity and participates in the regulation of cancer cell proliferation. WDR77 acetylation has not been reported previously. In the current study, we found that WDR77 was primarily acetylated by CBP at lysines 3 and 243. More importantly, we further ascertained that WDR77 was deacetylated by SIRT7 both in vivo and in vitro. However, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that WDR77 is also deacetylated by other deacetylases because TSA treatment also slightly increased the acetylation levels of WDR77 (Fig. 2B). It is worth further investigation to find out whether the other histone deacetylases may deacetylate WDR77 and regulate its functions. Nevertheless, we found that SIRT7 acts as a major deacetylase for WDR77 and the deacetylation of WDR77 at Lys-3 and Lys-243 weakened the interaction between WDR77 and PRMT5 and further influenced WDR77/PRMT5 complex activity. Through this mechanism, SIRT7 regulates the activity of the WDR77/PRMT5 methyltransferase complex, which is important in cancer cell proliferation. HEK293T and HCT116 (p53+/+) cells were obtained from ATCC between 2012 and 2016 and maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 mg/ml of streptomycin (Sigma). All cell lines were tested for mycoplasma contamination and authenticated utilizing short tandem repeat profiling. The same batch of cells was thawed every 1 to 2 months. Proteins were analyzed by Western blotting according to standard methods. Visualization was performed using ECL (Thermo Fisher Scientific, number 32106). Antibodies specific to the following proteins were purchased commercially: mouse anti-SIRT7 (Santa Cruz, sc-365344, 1:1,000 dilution), rabbit anti-SIRT7 (Santa Cruz, sc-135055, 1:1,000 dilution), anti-WDR77 (Abcam, ab154190, 1:1,000 dilution), anti-PRMT5 (Abcam, ab151321, 1:1,000 dilution), anti-H3 (Abcam, ab1791, 1:1,000 dilution), anti-H4R3me2 (Abcam, ab5823, 1:1,000 dilution), anti-GAPDH (Cell Signaling Technology, number 5174S, 1:2,000 dilution), anti-FLAG (Sigma, F-3165, 1:10,000 dilution), anti-HA (Pierce, number 26183, 1:5,000 dilution), and anti-pan-acetyl-lysine (Cell Signaling Technology, number 9441L, 1:1,000 dilution). SIRT7, WDR77, and PRMT5 cDNA were amplified and cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector. SIRT7- and WDR77-mutant constructs were generated by using the KOD Plus Mutagenesis Kit (TOYOBO). WDR77 full-length (FL), WDR77-NT (NT), WDR77-M (M), and WDR77-CT (CT) cDNA were subcloned into the pGEX4T-3 vector. All expression constructs were verified by Sanger sequencing. Total cells were lysed in BC100 buffer (20 mmol/liter of Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 100 mmol/liter of NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 20% glycerol) containing 1 mmol/liter of dithiothreitol (DTT; Sigma), 1 mmol/liter of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF; Sigma) and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Whole cell lysates were incubated with DNase I (Invitrogen) for 45 min at 37 °C and then incubated with 1 μg of mouse anti-SIRT7 or rabbit anti-WDR77 or normal mouse/rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz) for 10–14 h at 4 °C. Protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz) were added and the reaction mixtures were further mixed for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed by BC100 several times and eluted with 0.1 mol/liter of glycine (pH 2.5) and then neutralized with 1 mol/liter of Tris buffer. Eluted proteins were analyzed by Western blot analysis. For the GST pulldown, 1 μg of GST or GST-WDR77-FL (1–342 aa), GST-WDR77-NT (1–116 aa), GST-WDR77-M (117–250 aa), and GST-WDR77-CT (251–342 aa) protein were expressed and purified from Rosetta bacteria and incubated with FLAG-tagged SIRT7 purified from HEK293T cells for 8 h at 4 °C in BC100. Beads were washed and then bound proteins were eluted with GSH. Eluted proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. HEK293T cells were seeded in a 10-cm Petri dish at the density of 2 × 106 cells/dish the day before transfection. FLAG-tagged plasmids, as indicated, were transfected into HEK293T cells with polyethyleneimine method. At 24 h, for the acetylation assay, cells were incubated with 1 μmol/liter of TSA (Sigma) and 5 mmol/liter of nicotinamide (Sigma) for an additional 6 h before harvest. For the deacetylation assay, cells were not treated with any drugs before harvest. After collection of cells by centrifugation, whole cell lysates were prepared in FLAG lysis buffer (50 mmol/liter of Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 137 mmol/liter of NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% Sarkosyl, 1 mmol/liter of NaF, 1 mmol/liter of Na3VO4, and 10% glycerol) containing fresh protease inhibitors, 10 μmol/liter of TSA, and 5 mmol/liter of nicotinamide. Cell extracts were then incubated with anti-FLAG M2 beads (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. After washing the beads five times with BC100 buffer (50 mmol/liter of Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 100 mmol/liter of NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol), FLAG peptide was added, and the beads were incubated for an additional 2 h to elute the bound proteins. Immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with different antibodies as indicated. GST-WDR77-FL, GST-WDR77-NT, GST-WDR77-M, and GST-WDR77-CT were expressed and purified from Rosetta bacteria. Reactions were performed in a 30-μl system containing 3 μl of 10× reaction buffer (200 mmol/liter of HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mmol/liter of PMSF, 10 mmol/liter of DTT, 170 nmol/liter of acetyl-CoA), 3 μg of GST or GST fusion protein, 0.1 μg of HA-CBP, and double-distilled H2O as needed. The reaction mixture was then incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by Western blotting. To confirm equal protein loading in the in vitro acetylation assays, a parallel SDS-PAGE was performed using the same amount and loading of GST or GST fusion proteins, followed by gel code blue staining (Thermo Scientific). Total cells were lysed in FLAG lysis buffer (50 mmol/liter of Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 137 mmol/liter of NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% Sarkosyl, 1 mmol/liter of NaF, 1 mmol/liter of Na3VO4, and 10% glycerol) containing protease inhibitor mixture, 1 mmol/liter of DTT, and 1 mmol/liter of PMSF. Immunoprecipitations were carried out by incubating with M2 affinity gel (Sigma) for over 4 h at 4 °C. After incubation, beads were washed four times with ice-cold BC100 buffer and eluted with FLAG peptide. GST-WDR77-FL, GST-WDR77-NT, GST-WDR77-M, and GST-WDR77-CT were expressed and purified from Rosetta bacteria and bound to GST-agarose columns (Novagen). After incubation, the beads were eluted with GSH and rapidly diluted with 4 volumes of BC100 buffer. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with FLAG-WDR77 and HA-CBP plasmids and treated with or without 10 mmol/liter of nicotinamide and 1 μmol/liter of TSA for 6 h before being harvested. Cells were lysed in FLAG lysis buffer plus 10 mmol/liter of nicotinamide and 10 μmol/liter of TSA, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated overnight with M2 beads. Immunoprecipitated WDR77 proteins were separated via 8% SDS-PAGE, and WDR77 bands were excised from the gel and analyzed by MS. Distinct modification sites and undetected sites were chosen for further analysis. For the deacetylation assay, 2 μg of acetylated FLAG-WDR77 expressed and purified from HEK293T cells were incubated with or without 1 μg of HA-SIRT7 (as indicated) expressed and purified from HEK293T cells in deacetylation reaction buffer (10% glycerol, 4 mmol/liter of MgCl2, 100 mmol/liter of NaCl, 50 μmol/liter of NAD+ co-factor (Sigma) (when indicated)), at 37 °C for 2 h. The total volume of reaction mixtures was 30 μl. The reactions were stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved for Western blotting to detect the acetylation level of FLAG-WDR77. To generate HCT116 SIRT7, HCT116 WDR77 knockout (KO; down) cell lines, single guide RNA sequences were ligated into the LentiCRISPRv2 plasmid and then cotransfected with viral packaging plasmids (psPAX2 and pMD2G) into HEK293T cells. After transfection for 6 h, the medium was changed, and the viral supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-mm strainer after 42 h. Targeted cells were infected with the viral supernatant and selected with 1 mg/ml of puromycin for 2 weeks. Single guide RNA sequences targeting SIRT7 and WDR77 were designed using the CRISPR designer (http://crispr.mit.edu). 3Please note that the JBC is not responsible for the long-term archiving and maintenance of this site or any other third party hosted site. The guide sequences designed to target Exon 3 of human SIRT7 and Exon 1 of human WDR77 were as follows: SIRT7, 5′-CACCGCGTCCGGAACGCCAAATACT-3′; WDR77, 5′-AGCCTCCGTTTGGACTCCGG-3′ For WDR77-rescue cell lines, FLAG-tagged WDR77 wildtype (WT) and WDR77 2KR (K3R and K243R) mutant cDNA was subcloned into the pQCXIH retrovirus vector. The two plasmids were cotransfected with viral packaging plasmids (vsvg and gag) into HEK293T cells. Twenty-four hours after transfection, viral supernatants were filtered and infected into HCT116 WDR77 KO cells. The infected cells were selected with 150 mg/ml of hygromycin for 2 weeks. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Sigma), and RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the qPCR RT Kit (FSQ-101 TOYOBO). Quantitative PCR was performed on a 7500 Fast Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using qPCR SYBR Green Master Mix (Q131-03 Vazyme). mRNA quantity was calculated using the method ΔΔCt and normalized to actin.

https://openalex.org/W2895221165,"Waldenström Macroglobulinemia (WM) is a low-grade B-cell lymphoma characterized by disease progression from IgM MGUS to asymptomatic and then symptomatic disease states. We profiled exosomes from the peripheral blood of patients with WM at different stages (30 smoldering/asymptomatic WM, 44 symptomatic WM samples and 10 healthy controls) to define their role as potential biomarkers of disease progression. In this study, we showed that circulating exosomes and their miRNA content represent unique markers of the tumor and its microenvironment. We observed similar levels of miRNAs in exosomes from patients with asymptomatic (smoldering) and symptomatic WM, suggesting that environmental and clonal changes occur in patients at early stages of disease progression before symptoms occur. Moreover, we identified a small group of miRNAs whose expression correlated directly or inversely with the disease status of patients, notably the known tumor suppressor miRNAs let-7d and the oncogene miR-21 as well as miR-192 and miR-320b. The study of these miRNAs’ specific effect in WM cells could help us gain further insights on the mechanisms underlying WM pathogenesis and reveal their potential as novel therapeutic targets for this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2895595701,"Since anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α agents (TNF-α inhibitors) induce both clinical response and remission in patients with moderate to severe inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the use of anti-TNF therapies has fundamentally changed the approach to treatment for patients with IBD. Infliximab (IFX) is a TNF-α inhibitor approved for the induction and remission of Crohn’s disease (CD). However, even among patients who initially demonstrate a clinical response to IFX therapy, secondary loss of response occurs, although the reason remains unknown. We therefore investigated predictive factors associated with the response to IFX in long-term maintenance treatment in Japanese CD patients. Eight types of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were investigated using the real-time PCR method, and patient characteristics were collected from the electronic medical records. The Crohn’s Disease Activity Index criteria were used as the response to IFX therapy. The observation period was 1 year after IFX had been administered for more than 1 year. Associations between the IFX response and patient characteristics were evaluated using the multivariate logistic regression model. We studied 121 unrelated adult Japanese with CD treated for more than 1 year with IFX as outpatients at Keio University Hospital from November 1, 2014 to November 30, 2015. Among them, 71 were classified as in remisson. In multivariate analysis, patients with the TNF-α 857C>T C/C genotype, shorter disease duration, without double dosing, and combination treatment with an immunomodulator had higher remisson rates than those with the C/T or T/T genotype, longer disease duration, with double dosing, and no combination treatment with an immunomodulator. The response to IFX in Japanese CD patients may therefore be predicted by these 4 characteristics in actual clinical practice."

Abnormal expression of Nav1.5 on the cell surface because of mutations that disrupt Nav1.5 trafficking causes Brugada syndrome (BrS), sick sinus syndrome (SSS), cardiac conduction disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, and sudden infant death syndrome. We and others previously reported that Ran-binding protein MOG1 (MOG1), a small protein that interacts with Nav1.5, promotes Nav1.5 intracellular trafficking to plasma membranes and that a substitution in MOG1, E83D, causes BrS. However, the molecular basis for the MOG1/Nav1.5 interaction and how the E83D substitution causes BrS remains unknown. Here, we assessed the effects of defined MOG1 deletions and alanine-scanning substitutions on MOG1’s interaction with Nav1.5. Large deletion analysis mapped the MOG1 domain required for the interaction with Nav1.5 to the region spanning amino acids 146–174, and a refined deletion analysis further narrowed this domain to amino acids 146–155. Site-directed mutagenesis further revealed that Asp-148, Arg-150, and Ser-151 cluster in a peptide loop essential for binding to Nav1.5. GST pulldown and electrophysiological analyses disclosed that the substitutions E83D, D148Q, R150Q, and S151Q disrupt MOG1’s interaction with Nav1.5 and significantly reduce its trafficking to the cell surface. Examination of MOG1’s 3D structure revealed that Glu-83 and the loop containing Asp-148, Arg-150, and Ser-151 are spatially proximal, suggesting that these residues form a critical binding site for Nav1.5. In conclusion, our findings identify the structural elements in MOG1 that are crucial for its interaction with Nav1.5 and improve our understanding of how the E83D substitution causes BrS.

https://openalex.org/W2895504326,"Background Aberrant DNA methylation occurs frequently in cancer. The aim of this study was to identify novel methylation markers in lung cancer in Xuanwei, China, through integrated genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression studies. Methods Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected on 10 paired lung cancer tissues and noncancerous lung tissues by methylated DNA immunoprecipitation combined with microarray (MeDIP-chip) and gene expression microarray analyses, respectively. Integrated analysis of DMRs and DEGs was performed to screen out candidate methylation-related genes. Both methylation and expression changes of the candidate genes were further validated and analyzed. Results Compared with normal lung tissues, lung cancer tissues expressed a total of 6,899 DMRs, including 5,788 hypermethylated regions and 1,111 hypomethylated regions. Integrated analysis of DMRs and DEGs identified 45 tumor-specific candidate genes: 38 genes whose DMRs were hypermethylated and expression was downregulated, and 7 genes whose DMRs were hypomethylated and expression was upregulated. The methylation and expression validation results identified 4 candidate genes (STXBP6, BCL6B, FZD10, and HSPB6) that were significantly hypermethylated and downregulated in most of the tumor tissues compared with the noncancerous lung tissues. Conclusions This integrated analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression in lung cancer in Xuanwei revealed several genes regulated by promoter methylation that have not been described in lung cancer before. These results provide new insight into the carcinogenesis of lung cancer in Xuanwei and represent promising new diagnostic and therapeutic targets."

This study evaluates the EZ, outer retina, and inner retina in eyes without macular disease across a wide age spectrum.An IRB-approved study was performed for eyes without macular pathology undergoing Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) scans on the Cirrus HD-OCT system (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Oberkochen, Germany). Scans were analyzed using a previously described automated EZ mapping tool with line-by-line manual verification. Segmentation included internal limiting membrane (ILM), outer nuclear layer/Henle fiber layer complex (ONL/HFL), EZ, and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The output included metrics for the inner retina (ILM-OPL/HFL), outer retina (ONL/HFL-RPE), EZ-RPE area and volume, and en face EZ mapping. EZ-RPE attenuation on en face mapping was defined as EZ-RPE thickness < 20 um, and total attenuation was 0 um. Imaging parameters were assessed for the group and compared to age, sex, visual acuity and spherical equivalent.167 eyes from 167 subjects were included. Mean age was 49.7 years (range 10-84 years). The mean foveal retinal thickness was 200.58 ± 19.22 um. Mean inner retinal thickness was 21.47 ± 13.60 um. Mean outer retinal thickness was 179.11 ± 18.52 um. Mean EZ-RPE thickness was 50.58 ± 6.01um. The mean EZ-RPE volume was 1.20 ± 0.10 mm3. Mean EZ attenuation percentage per macular map area was 0.87% ± 1.13% and mean percentage total attenuation was 0.12% ± 0.14%. Total and inner retinal thickness metrics decreased with age. Mean outer retinal thickness increased with age. EZ-RPE parameters were unchanged with age. However, EZ attenuation was negatively correlated with age.This study provides important information for inner and outer retinal parameters. Future research on quantitative EZ integrity can utilize this data for comparison."
https://openalex.org/W2894643202,"The level of the vitamin D in the bloodstream is regulated by cytochrome P450 enzyme 24-hydroxylase A1 (CYP24A1). Over expression of CYP24A1 enzyme is correlated with vitamin D deficiency and resistance to vitamin D therapy. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients are commonly reported with the above said expression variations. This deregulation could be solved by ligands that act as a vitamin D receptor (VDR) agonists and CYP24A1 antagonists. Posner et al., (2010) first time reported two new vitamin D analogues namely CTA-091 and CTA-018 to inhibit CYP24A1. The CTA-018 inhibited CYP24A1 with an IC50 27 ± 6 nM (10 times more potent than the ketoconazole (253 ± 20 nM)). CTA-018 induced VDR expression (15-fold lower than 1α,25(OH)2D3) and is under phase II clinical trial, whereas CTA-091 was not able to efficiently induce the VDR expression (>2000 nM). To explore the molecular mechanism, binding specificity of these two vitamin D analogues along with native ligand was extensively studied through in silico approaches. Through molecular dynamics simulations studies, we shown that the sulfonic group (O = S = O) in the side chain of CTA-018 plays an important role in the regulation of VDR agonistic activity. The electron lone pairs of the sulfonic group that interacted with His393 lead to be a factor for agonistic mechanism of VDR activity. Compared to azol-based compounds, CTA-018 binds the different sites in the CYP24A1 binding cavity and thus it could be a potent antagonistic for CYP24A1enzyme."

This study evaluated the effect of rural infrastructure construction from the perspective of farmers. First, this study revised the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) model and selected a performance appraisal index for rural infrastructure based on this revised model. Then, the study adopted an interpretive structural model (ISM), analyzed the influence of each index factor, and developed a hierarchical directed graph. Finally, based on the mutual-influence relationships among the index factors in the hierarchical directed graph, a performance appraisal analytic network process (ANP) model was established. Based on discussions with rural college students and rural households in Sichuan, China, 246 questionnaires were obtained pertaining to rural infrastructure, and an empirical analysis was conducted. The results indicated that the performance of rural infrastructure construction is not very good. In particular, the full use of infrastructure and its role in improving the environment were found to be the worst. Meanwhile, the possibility of building information transparency and the longitudinal comparison of perceived performance appraisal results were the best. The performance of rural infrastructure construction was evaluated based on the perceptions of the direct users of rural infrastructure, and the relationship between the factors and the weight was measured reasonably. The proposed method was found to be workable and the analysis results reliable and effective."
https://openalex.org/W2895293826,"The interaction between the enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2) and fibronectin (FN) is involved in the cell-matrix interactions that regulate cell signaling, adhesion, and migration and play central roles in pathologic conditions, particularly fibrosis and cancer. A precise definition of the exact interaction domains on both proteins could provide a tool to design novel molecules with potential therapeutic applications. Although specific residues involved in the interaction within TG2 have been analyzed, little is known regarding the TG2 binding site on FN. This site has been mapped to a large internal 45-kDa protein fragment coincident with the gelatin binding domain (GBD). With the goal of defining the minimal FN interacting domain for TG2, we produced several expression constructs encoding different portions or modules of the GBD and tested their binding and functional properties. The results demonstrate that the I8 module is necessary and sufficient for TG2-binding in vitro, but does not have functional effects on TG2-expressing cells. Modules I7 and I9 increase the strength of the binding and are required for cell adhesion. A 15-kDa fragment encompassing modules I7–9 behaves as the whole 45-kDa GBD and mediates signaling, adhesion, spreading, and migration of TG2+ cells. This study provides new insights into the mechanism for TG2 binding to FN.—Soluri, M.

https://openalex.org/W2894775439,"Multifunctional autoprocessing repeats-in-toxin (MARTX) toxins are secreted by Gram-negative bacteria and function as primary virulence-promoting macromolecules that deliver multiple cytopathic and cytotoxic effector domains into the host cytoplasm. Among these effectors, Ras/Rap1-specific endopeptidase (RRSP) catalyzes the sequence-specific cleavage of the Switch I region of the cellular substrates Ras and Rap1 that are crucial for host innate immune defenses during infection. To dissect the molecular basis underpinning RRSP-mediated substrate inactivation, we determined the crystal structure of an RRSP from the sepsis-causing bacterial pathogen Vibrio vulnificus (VvRRSP). Structural and biochemical analyses revealed that VvRRSP is a metal-independent TIKI family endopeptidase composed of an N-terminal membrane-localization and substrate-recruitment domain (N lobe) connected via an inter-lobe linker to the C-terminal active site–coordinating core β-sheet–containing domain (C lobe). Structure-based mutagenesis identified the 2His/2Glu catalytic residues in the core catalytic domain that are shared with other TIKI family enzymes and that are essential for Ras processing. In vitro KRas cleavage assays disclosed that deleting the N lobe in VvRRSP causes complete loss of enzymatic activity. Endogenous Ras cleavage assays combined with confocal microscopy analysis of HEK293T cells indicated that the N lobe functions both in membrane localization via the first α-helix and in substrate assimilation by altering the functional conformation of the C lobe to facilitate recruitment of cellular substrates. Collectively, these results indicate that RRSP is a critical virulence factor that robustly inactivates Ras and Rap1 and augments the pathogenicity of invading bacteria via the combined effects of its N and C lobes.

https://openalex.org/W2895068982,"The implication of αβ and γδ T cells in obesity-associated inflammation and insulin resistance (IR) remains uncertain. Mice lacking γδ T cells show either no difference or a decrease in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced IR, whereas partial depletion in γδ T cells does not protect from HFD-induced IR. αβ T-cell deficiency leads to a decrease in white adipose tissue (WAT) inflammation and IR without weight change, but partial depletion of these cells has not been studied. We previously described a mouse model overexpressing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor β (PPAR-β) specifically in T cells [transgenic (Tg) T–PPAR-β] that exhibits a partial depletion in αβ T cells and no change in γδ T-cell number. This results in a decreased αβ/γδ T-cell ratio in lymphoid organs. We now show that Tg T–PPAR-β mice are partially protected against HFD-induced weight gain and exhibit decreased IR and liver steatosis independently of animal weight. These mice display an alteration of WAT-depots distribution with an increased epididymal-WAT mass and a decreased subcutaneous WAT mass. Immune cell number is decreased in both WAT-depots, except for γδ T cells, which are increased in epididymal-WAT. Overall, we show that decreasing αβ/γδ T-cell ratio in WAT-depots alters their inflammatory state and mass repartition, which might be involved in improvement of insulin sensitivity.—Le Menn, G., Sibille, B., Murdaca, J., Rousseau, A.-S., Squillace, R., Vergoni, B., Cormont, M., Niot, I., Grimaldi, P.

Biomineralization is elaborately controlled and involves several macromolecules, especially matrix proteins, but little is known about the regulatory mechanisms. The matrix protein Shematrin-2, expression of which peaks in the mantle tissues and in the shell components of the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata, has been suggested to be a key participant in biomineralization. Here, we expressed and purified Shematrin-2 from P. fucata and explored its function and transcriptional regulation. An in vitro functional assay revealed that Shematrin-2 binds the calcite, aragonite, and chitin components of the shell, decreases the rate of calcium carbonate deposition, and changes the morphology of the deposited crystal in the calcite crystallization system. Furthermore, we cloned the Shematrin-2 gene promoter, and analysis of its sequence revealed putative binding sites for the transcription factors CCAAT enhancer–binding proteins (Pf-C/EBPs) and nuclear factor-Y (NF-Y). Using transient co-transfection and reporter gene assays, we found that cloned and recombinantly expressed Pf-C/EBP-A and Pf-C/EBP-B greatly and dose-dependently up-regulate the promoter activity of the Shematrin-2 gene. Importantly, Pf-C/EBP-A and Pf-C/EBP-B knockdowns decreased Shematrin-2 gene expression and induced changes in the inner-surface structures in prismatic layers that were similar to those of antibody-based Shematrin-2 inhibition.

https://openalex.org/W2792939521,"The genetic regulatory network (GRN) plays a key role in controlling the response of the cell to changes in the environment. Although the structure of GRNs has been the subject of many studies, their large scale structure in the light of feedbacks from the metabolic network (MN) has received relatively little attention. Here we study the causal structure of the GRNs, namely the chain of influence of one component on the other, taking into account feedback from the MN. First we consider the GRNs of E. coli and B. subtilis without feedback from MN and illustrate their causal structure. Next we augment the GRNs with feedback from their respective MNs by including (a) links from genes coding for enzymes to metabolites produced or consumed in reactions catalyzed by those enzymes and (b) links from metabolites to genes coding for transcription factors whose transcriptional activity the metabolites alter by binding to them. We find that the inclusion of feedback from MN into GRN significantly affects its causal structure, in particular the number of levels and relative positions of nodes in the hierarchy, and the number and size of the strongly connected components (SCCs). We then study the functional significance of the SCCs. For this we identify condition specific feedbacks from the MN into the GRN by retaining only those enzymes that are essential for growth in specific environmental conditions simulated via the technique of flux balance analysis (FBA). We find that the SCCs of the GRN augmented by these feedbacks can be ascribed specific functional roles in the organism. Our algorithmic approach thus reveals relatively autonomous subsystems with specific functionality, or regulatory modules in the organism. This automated approach could be useful in identifying biologically relevant modules in other organisms for which network data is available, but whose biology is less well studied."

The goal of this study was to assess the CT appearance pattern and severity of RILI without consideration of the clinical presentation.A total of 49 patients, 41 with primary lung cancer and 8 with metastatic lung cancer, were treated by 4-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). RILI after SBRT was separately assessed by two observers. The early and late CT appearance patterns and CT-based severity grading were explored.The median follow-up period was 39.0 months. In the early CT findings of observers 1 and 2, there was diffuse consolidation in 15 and 8, diffuse ground glass opacity (GGO) in 0 and 0, patchy consolidation and GGO in 17 and 20, patchy GGO in 3 and 3, and no changes in 10 and 14, respectively (kappa = 0.61). In late CT findings of observer 1 and 2, there were modified conventional pattern in 28 and 24, mass-like pattern in 8 and 11, scar-like pattern in 12 and 12, and no changes in 1 and 2, respectively (kappa = 0.63). In the results of the CT-based grading by observers 1 and 2, there were grade 0 in 1 and 2, grade 1 in 10 and 14, grade 2 in 31 and 29, grade 3 in 7 and 4, and none of grade 4 or more, respectively (kappa = 0.66). According to multivariate analyses (MVA), the significant predicting factors of grade 2 or more CT-based RILI were age (p = 0.01), oxygen dependence (p = 0.03) and interstitial shadow (p = 0.03).The agreement of the CT appearance and CT-based grading between two observers was good. These indicators may be able to provide us with more objective information and a better understanding of RILI."
https://openalex.org/W2895715909,"Rhodococcus equi is a facultative intracellular bacterium of macrophages and is an important pathogen of animals and immunocompromised people wherein disease results in abcessation of the lungs and other sites. Prior work has shown that the presence of the major virulence determinant, VapA, encoded on the pVAPA-type plasmid, disrupts normal phagosome development and is essential for bacterial replication within macrophages. pVAPA- type plasmids are typical of R. equi strains derived from foals while strains from pigs carry plasmids of the pVAPB-type, lacking vapA, and those from humans harbor various types of plasmids including pVAPA and pVAPB. Through the creation and analysis of a series of gene deletion mutants, we found that vapK1 or vapK2 is required for optimal intracellular replication of an R. equi isolate carrying a pVAPB plasmid type. Complementation analysis of a ΔvapA R. equi strain with vapK1 or vapK2 showed the VapK proteins of the pVAPB-type plasmid could restore replication capacity to the macrophage growth-attenuated ΔvapA strain. Additionally, in contrast to the intracellular growth capabilities displayed by an equine R. equi transconjugant strain carrying a pVAPB-type plasmid, a transconjugant strain carrying a pVAPB-type plasmid deleted of vapK1 and vapK2 proved incapable of replication in equine macrophages. Cumulatively, these data indicate that VapK1 and K2 are functionally equivalent to VapA."

https://openalex.org/W2894799426,"Experimental nephrotoxic serum nephritis (NTN) is a model for T-cell–mediated human rapid progressive glomerulonephritis. T-cell receptor stimulation involves intracellular signaling events that ultimately lead to the activation of transcription factors, such as NF-κB. We explored the involvement of the NF-κB components IKK-2 and NEMO in NTN, by using cell-specific knockouts of IKK-2 and NEMO in CD4+ T lymphocytes. Our results demonstrate that although the course of disease was not grossly altered in CD4xIKK2Δ and CD4xNEMOΔ animals, renal regulatory T cells were significantly reduced and T helper (Th)1 and Th17 cells significantly increased in both knockout mouse groups. The expression of the renal cytokines and chemokines IL-1β, CCL-2, and CCL-20 was also significantly altered in both knockout mice. Lymphocyte transcriptome analysis confirmed the increased expression of Th17-related cytokines in spleen CD4+ T cells. Moreover, our array data demonstrate an interrupted canonical NF-κB pathway and an increased expression of noncanonical NF-κB pathway–related genes in nephritic CD4xNEMOΔ mice, highlighting different downstream effects of deletion of IKK-2 or NEMO in T lymphocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2950879184,"Introduction Human immunodeficiency virus and protein energy malnutrition are still prevalent in Nigeria and the occurrence of the two conditions together confers a poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to determine the current categories of malnutrition amongst under-5 children in Lagos, document their HIV status and determine any peculiarities in the clinical features, haematological and some biochemical profile in these children. Methods The study was a cross-sectional study conducted at the Paediatric departments of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital and the Massey Street Children’s Hospital, both in Lagos, over a 6-month period. All the subjects had anthropometry, HIV testing, full blood count and serum proteins done. The factors associated with HIV status were determined with the logistic regression analysis. Results Two hundred and fourteen (214) malnourished children ≤5 years, including 25 (11.7%) with HIV were recruited in the study. Among the study participants, 150 (70.1%) and 54 (29.9%) had moderate and severe malnutrition, respectively. Fever, cough and diarrhea were the most common symptoms in the study participants. The haematological indices were comparable in the two groups, the serum globulin levels though higher in the HIV infected group was not statistically significantly different from the non-infected group.(p = 0.66). None of the factors explored on multivariate analysis was able to predict the occurrence of the infection in this cohort. Conclusion Malnourished children remain a high risk group for HIV infection and the prevalence of the infection obtained in this group of children is still unacceptably high. Discriminatory features between malnutrition and HIV remains difficult. The presence of hyperglobulinaemia on laboratory analysis in a malnourished child may heighten the suspicion of possible underlying associated HIV infection. Screening of malnourished children for HIV infection and further longitudinal studies on malnourished children with HIV is advocated"

In a laboratory experiment, we manipulate the way in which payoffs are presented to subjects in two different ways. In both cases, information is made less accessible relative to the standard representation of the game. Results show that these manipulations shift the distribution of take nodes further away from the equilibrium prediction. The evidence is consistent with the view that failures of game-form recognition and the resulting limits to strategic reasoning are crucial for explaining non-equilibrium behavior in the centipede game."
https://openalex.org/W2895756978,"Attaining recombinant thermostable proteins is still a challenge for protein engineering. The complexity is the length of time and enormous efforts required to achieve the desired results. Present work proposes a novel and economic strategy of attaining protein thermostability by predicting site-specific mutations at the shortest possible time. The success of the approach can be attributed to Analytical Hierarchical Process and the outcome was a rationalized thermostable mutation(s) prediction tool- RankProt. Briefly the method involved ranking of 17 biophysical protein features as class predictors, derived from 127 pairs of thermostable and mesostable proteins. Among the 17 predictors, ionic interactions and main-chain to main-chain hydrogen bonds were the highest ranked features with eigen value of 0.091. The success of the tool was judged by multi-fold in silico validation tests and it achieved the prediction accuracy of 91% with AUC 0.927. Further, in vitro validation was carried out by predicting thermostabilizing mutations for mesostable Bacillus subtilis lipase and performing the predicted mutations by multi-site directed mutagenesis. The rationalized method was successful to render the lipase thermostable with optimum temperature stability and Tm increase by 20°C and 7°C respectively. Conclusively it can be said that it was the minimum number of mutations in comparison to the number of mutations incorporated to render Bacillus subtilis lipase thermostable, by directed evolution techniques. The present work shows that protein stabilizing mutations can be rationally designed by balancing the biophysical pleiotropy of proteins, in accordance to the selection pressure."
