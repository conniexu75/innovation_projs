Neuronal circuits vulnerable to AD are also affected in human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) transgenic mice. hAPP mice with high levels of amyloid-β peptides in the brain develop AD-like abnormalities, including cognitive deficits and depletions of calcium-related proteins in the dentate gyrus, a region critically involved in learning and memory. Here, we report that hAPP mice have spontaneous nonconvulsive seizure activity in cortical and hippocampal networks, which is associated with GABAergic sprouting, enhanced synaptic inhibition, and synaptic plasticity deficits in the dentate gyrus. Many Aβ-induced neuronal alterations could be simulated in nontransgenic mice by excitotoxin challenge and prevented in hAPP mice by blocking overexcitation. Aberrant increases in network excitability and compensatory inhibitory mechanisms in the hippocampus may contribute to Aβ-induced neurological deficits in hAPP mice and, possibly, also in humans with AD.

The hippocampus plays key roles in learning and memory (Burgess et al., 2002Burgess N. Maguire E.A. O'Keefe J.

Zetterberg H. Alzheimer's disease.Lancet. 2006; 368: 387-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2832) Google Scholar). Although much is known about the neural circuits and molecular pathways required for normal hippocampal functions, the processes by which AD disables this brain region remain to be defined. We recently postulated that destabilization of neuronal network activity may contribute to cognitive impairments associated with AD and hypothesized that such destabilization may result, at least in part, from aberrant alterations in neuronal network activity and resulting compensatory responses (Palop et al., 2006Palop J.J. Chin J. Mucke L. A network dysfunction perspective on neurodegenerative diseases.Nature. 2006; 443: 768-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). A key molecule that may perturb network activity in AD is the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, which is derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by proteolytic cleavage. The excessive accumulation of pathogenic Aβ assemblies in the brain appears to play a causal role in AD (Glenner and Wong, 1984Glenner G.G. Wong C.W.

In strong support of this notion, neuronal expression of human APP (hAPP) and Aβ in transgenic mice elicits several AD-like abnormalities, including amyloid plaques, neuritic dystrophy, aberrant sprouting of axon terminals, functional and structural synaptic deficits, impairments in learning and memory, and other behavioral alterations (Chin et al., 2004Chin J.

The relevance of these transgenic mouse models to the human condition is further underlined by the fact that their impairments do not affect the entire brain but primarily those regions that are particularly vulnerable to AD, including the hippocampus. Aβ-dependent deficits in hippocampal learning and memory correlate well with alterations in calcium- and synaptic activity-related proteins in granule cells of the dentate gyrus (Chin et al., 2005Chin J.

These functionally relevant molecular alterations include reductions in the calcium-binding protein calbindin-D28K, the immediate-early gene products Arc and Fos, the dendritic spine actin-binding protein α-actinin-II, and the phosphorylation states of the NMDA receptor subunit NR2B and the MAP kinases ERK1/2, as well as increases in the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and striatal-enriched phosphatase. The levels of these molecules are affected to different degrees in different familial AD mutant hAPP (hAPPFAD) mice but to very similar degrees in any given hAPPFAD mouse, suggesting a common underlying mechanism (Chin et al., 2005Chin J.

Notably, several of these dentate alterations have also been observed in humans with AD (Palop et al., 2003Palop J.J. Jones B. Kekonius L. Chin J. Yu G.-Q. Raber J. Masliah E. Mucke L.

These findings suggest that the dentate alterations of hAPPFAD mice and humans with AD may be caused, at least in part, by aberrant increases in neuronal activity, consistent with the increased risk of seizure activity in sporadic and familial AD and with the excitotoxicity hypothesis of neurodegenerative disorders (for review, Amatniek et al., 2006Amatniek J.C.

However, Aβ decreases glutamatergic synaptic transmission, at least at certain synapses, presumably through a mechanism that involves the endocytosis of AMPA receptors and subsequent collapse of dendritic spines (Hsia et al., 1999Hsia A.

Naturally secreted oligomers of amyloid β protein potently inhibit hippocampal long-term potentiation in vivo..Nature. 2002; 416: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (3742) Google Scholar). Therefore, the depletion of calcium- and synaptic activity-related proteins in the dentate gyrus of hAPPFAD mice may also be caused by the suppression of overall network activity. Because Aβ might act differentially on neuronal subtypes and brain regions, it is unclear whether the net effect of Aβ on specific networks is excitatory, inhibitory, or combines elements of both. To explore whether Aβ-dependent neuronal alterations associated with cognitive deficits are more closely related to overexcitation or suppression of neuronal activity in cortical and hippocampal networks, we analyzed four lines of transgenic mice expressing FAD mutant or wild-type (WT) hAPP. Compared with nontransgenic (NTG) mice and with hAPPWT transgenic mice, hAPPFAD mice with high levels of Aβ showed anatomical and biochemical alterations in the dentate gyrus that are indicative of aberrant excitatory neuronal activity. Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in hAPPFAD mice revealed intermittent epileptiform cortical and hippocampal synchronous discharges and generalized nonconvulsive seizure activity. These abnormalities were associated with a prominent remodeling of inhibitory circuits, increased synaptic inhibition, and synaptic plasticity deficits in the dentate gyrus. Many of these alterations could be simulated in NTG mice by systemic injection with kainate and prevented in both hAPPFAD mice and kainate-treated NTG mice by removal of Tau, a genetic manipulation that protects against excitotoxin-induced seizure activity (Roberson et al., 2007Roberson E.D. Scearce-Levie K. Palop J.J. Yan F. Cheng I.H. Wu T. Gerstein H. Yu G.-Q. Mucke L. Reducing endogenous tau ameliorates amyloid β-induced deficits in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model.Science. 2007; 316: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that hAPP/Aβ induces aberrant excitatory neuronal network activity in vivo and triggers compensatory inhibitory mechanisms in hippocampal circuits. Both the aberrant excitatory neuronal activity and the compensatory inhibitory mechanisms may limit the capacity for synaptic plasticity and contribute to AD-related network dysfunction. Axonal sprouting of GABAergic interneurons and alterations in the expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY) are sensitive indicators of imbalances between excitatory and inhibitory neuronal activities in the hippocampus (for review, Vezzani et al., 1999Vezzani A. Sperk G. Colmers W.F. Neuropeptide Y: emerging evidence for a functional role in seizure modulation.Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 25-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Compared with NTG controls, hAPPFAD mice from the high expresser J20 line (hAPP-J20 mice) showed ectopic expression of NPY in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and in the axons of granule cells (mossy fibers; Figure 1A). Double labeling for NPY and calbindin revealed that these alterations were associated with depletions of calbindin in granule cells (Figures 1B–1D), which correlate with deficits in learning and memory in this model and are also seen in humans with AD (Palop et al., 2003Palop J.J. Jones B. Kekonius L. Chin J. Yu G.-Q. Raber J. Masliah E. Mucke L. Neuronal depletion of calcium-dependent proteins in the dentate gyrus is tightly linked to Alzheimer's disease-related cognitive deficits.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 9572-9577Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Compared with NTG controls, hAPP-J20 mice showed a marked increase in NPY mRNA levels in granule cells (Figure 1E), suggesting that the ectopic presence of NPY in mossy fibers was caused by increased NPY gene expression in these neurons. In contrast, the NPY-positive sprouting in the molecular layer more likely emanated from hilar NPY- and somatostatin (SOM)-positive GABAergic interneurons (Bakst et al., 1986Bakst I. Avendano C. Morrison J.H. Amaral D.G. An experimental analysis of the origins of somatostatin-like immunoreactivity in the dentate gyrus of the rat.J.

Neuropeptide Y: emerging evidence for a functional role in seizure modulation.Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 25-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), since these fibers were also immunoreactive for somatostatin (Figures 1F and 1G) and failed to stain with the Timm method, which detects the high levels of zinc present in mossy fibers (data not shown). Because NPY- and SOM-positive GABAergic hilar interneurons inhibit the dendrites of granule cells (Freund and Buzsáki, 1996Freund T.F. Buzsáki G. Interneurons of the hippocampus.Hippocampus. 1996; 6: 347-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the inhibitory sprouting would be expected to increase inhibition of granule cells. Dentate mRNA levels for NPY-Y1 and -Y2 receptors were determined by quantitative fluorogenic RT-PCR. Compared with NTG mice, the mRNA level for Y1 receptors, which exert weak excitatory activity of NPY (Vezzani et al., 1999Vezzani A. Sperk G. Colmers W.F. Neuropeptide Y: emerging evidence for a functional role in seizure modulation.Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 25-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), was decreased in hAPP-J20, whereas the mRNA level for Y2 receptors, which mediate potent inhibitory activity of NPY (Vezzani et al., 1999Vezzani A. Sperk G. Colmers W.F. Neuropeptide Y: emerging evidence for a functional role in seizure modulation.Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 25-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), was increased (Figure 1H). To exclude the possibility that the NPY alterations in hAPP-J20 mice resulted from hAPP overexpression or from a transgene insertion effect, we analyzed additional hAPPWT (hAPP-I5) and hAPPFAD (hAPP-ARC48 and hAPP-J9/FYN) transgenic lines (Cheng et al., 2004Cheng I.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4050-4058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NPY expression in hAPP-I5 mice, which have similar hAPP levels as hAPP-J20 mice but much lower levels of Aβ, was indistinguishable from that in NTG controls (see Figure S1A in the Supplemental Data available with this article online), excluding a direct effect of hAPP overexpression on these alterations. The two additional hAPPFAD lines showed prominent increases in NPY expression (Figures S1B–S1E), demonstrating that this alteration is not restricted to hAPP-J20 mice. Ectopic expression of NPY in mossy fibers has previously been identified in aged hAPPFAD mice and was ascribed to late amyloid deposition (Diez et al., 2000Diez M. Koistinaho J. Kahn K. Games D.

Dis. 2003; 14: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, we found that the magnitude of NPY elevation was similar in the three independent hAPPFAD lines, even though they have vastly different plaque loads (Figure S1F and Cheng et al., 2004Cheng I. Palop J. Esposito L. Bien-Ly N. Yan F. Mucke L. Aggressive amyloidosis in mice expressing human amyloid peptides with the Arctic mutation.Nat.

USA. 2003; 100: 9572-9577Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Thus, it is very likely that NPY and calbindin alterations in hAPPFAD mice are unrelated to amyloid deposition. The GABAergic sprouting and NPY alterations we identified in different hAPPFAD lines have also been observed in animal models with chronic epilepsy and aberrant increases in neuronal activity (for review, Vezzani et al., 1999Vezzani A.

We therefore examined whether hAPP-J20 mice resemble epilepsy models also with respect to circuit alterations that are widely presumed to promote epileptogenesis: recurrent excitatory sprouting of collateral mossy fibers in the inner molecular layer and loss of inhibitory interneurons in the hilus (Cobos et al., 2005Cobos I.

We found no evidence for recurrent mossy fiber sprouting in the inner molecular layer of hAPP-J20 mice either by NPY immunostaining (Figures 1 A and 1B) or by Timm staining (Figure 2A). Instead, there was an increase of collateral mossy fibers crossing the granule cell layer (Figures 2A and 2B). Double labeling for collateral mossy fibers (Timm) and markers of GABAergic basket cells (parvalbumin or NPY) revealed that the Timm-positive sprouting was specifically and heavily decorating somas and proximal dendrites of basket cells (Figure 2C). Because the GABAergic basket cells inhibit the granule cells (Freund and Buzsáki, 1996Freund T.F. Buzsáki G. Interneurons of the hippocampus.Hippocampus. 1996; 6: 347-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), increased excitatory mossy fiber innervation of basket cells would be expected to enhance inhibition of granule cells. In a similar vein, quantification of the number of somatostatin-positive interneurons in the hilus throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the hippocampus showed no significant difference between NTG and hAPP-J20 mice (Figures 2D and 2E). Thus, the dentate gyrus of hAPP-J20 mice exhibits circuit alterations that are widely presumed to enhance inhibition but lacks those that promote hippocampal epileptogenesis, suggesting an incomplete mechanistic overlap with models of epilepsy. In models of epilepsy, synaptic inhibition in the dentate gyrus is compromised primarily due to the loss of hilar NPY- and SOM-positive GABAergic cells (Kobayashi and Buckmaster, 2003Kobayashi M.

To test whether the remodeling of inhibitory hippocampal circuits in hAPP-J20 mice is associated with increased inhibition in granule cells, we performed whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings to isolate miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs). We found that the frequency of mIPSCs recorded from dentate granule cells was significantly increased in hAPP-J20 mice relative to NTG controls (Figures 3A–3C). Although mIPSC amplitudes were not significantly different between NTG and hAPP-J20 mice when all events were averaged (data not shown), the cumulative probability plot demonstrated that large-amplitude events were enhanced in hAPP-J20 mice (Figure 3D).

However, additional details about the intial colonization of the Americas remain unclear. To investigate the pioneering phase in the Americas we analyzed a total of 623 complete mtDNAs from the Americas and Asia, including 20 new complete mtDNAs from the Americas and seven from Asia. This sequence data was used to direct high-resolution genotyping from 20 American and 26 Asian populations. Here we describe more genetic diversity within the founder population than was previously reported. The newly resolved phylogenetic structure suggests that ancestors of Native Americans paused when they reached Beringia, during which time New World founder lineages differentiated from their Asian sister-clades. This pause in movement was followed by a swift migration southward that distributed the founder types all the way to South America. The data also suggest more recent bi-directional gene flow between Siberia and the North American Arctic."

Behavior, with all its variety and complexity, reflects the coordinated activity of neurons that are organized into local and global networks. To understand the spatiotemporal organization of activity in such networks and the way it generates behavioral output, we need to combine results derived from its measurements at different spatial scales, including large-scale information provided from neuroimaging methods, regional information derived from mesoscopic electrical activity, such as that obtained from field potentials, and information on the activity of single neurons, traditionally obtained from fine-resolution, extracellular, single-unit recordings. For several decades, combined electrophysiological and behavioral experiments have concentrated mainly on the finest of these scales, ignoring other graded signals, population synchrony, and rhythms yielding medium to large-scale activation patterns. Ever since their development (Adrian and Zotterman, 1926Adrian E.D. Zotterman Y. The impulses produced by sensory nerve-endings, part 2. The response of a single end-organ.J. Physiol. 1926; 61: 151-171PubMed Google Scholar), in fact, microelectrodes have been used to monitor the spiking rate of isolated neurons, and this rate was used as the neural correlated of behavior (for a review, see Logothetis, 2002Logothetis N.K.

The focus on spiking rates remained unchallenged for many decades and was strengthened by their suitability for studying the first steps of afferent information processing in sensory physiology (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962Hubel D.H.

What the frog's eye tells the frog's brain.Proc. Inst. Radio. Engrs. 1959; 47: 1940-1951Google Scholar). The very same microelectrodes, however, can also be used to monitor the slow (<120 Hz) potential changes that are generated by all regional sinks and sources within the extracellular space. They typically, but not exclusively, provide three-dimensional information about the cooperating synaptic inputs into a recorded area; such information is often not predictable from spiking activity. Such mesoscopic recordings may prove essential for the study of small networks and the interactions between distant brain regions (Abeles, 1991Abeles M. Corticonics. Neural Circuits of the Cerebral Cortex. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1991Crossref Google Scholar, Bullock, 1997Bullock T.H.

USA. 1997; 94: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, Freeman, 1975Freeman W.J. Mass Action in the Nervous System. Academic Press, New York1975Google Scholar). The importance of understanding small networks, rather than merely focusing on single cell properties, can hardly be overestimated. Every cortical pyramidal cell receives approximately 10,000 synaptic inputs, about 75% of which are excitatory, the exact numbers varying between structures and species (Abeles, 1991Abeles M. Corticonics. Neural Circuits of the Cerebral Cortex. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1991Crossref Google Scholar, Braitenberg and Schuez, 1998Braitenberg V. Schuez A. Cortex: Statistics and Geometry of Neuronal Connectivity. Springer, Berlin1998Crossref Google Scholar). The vast majority of these excitatory inputs arise from other cortical neurons, with each presynaptic cell providing only a few synapses. The strong convergence of synaptic input onto each cortical cell shows the degree of integration at the single-cell level and gives us an indication of the complexity of the computations performed at each recording site. These computations ultimately determine the properties of the canonical cortical microcircuits (Douglas et al., 1989Douglas R.J. Martin K.A.C. Whitteridge D. A functional microcircuit for cat vat visual cortex.Neural Comput. 1989; 1: 480-488Crossref Google Scholar, Douglas and Martin, 1990Douglas R.J. Martin K.A.C. Neocortex.in: Shepherd G.M.

Physiol. 1991; 440: 735-769PubMed Google Scholar), the elementary processing units of cortex. The study of such units and of the computations they perform can greatly benefit from the analysis of the local field potentials (LFPs). Until recently the latter were thought to be generated by summed (population) postsynaptic potentials, as first proposed by Eccles, 1951Eccles J.C. Interpretation of action potentials evoked in the cerebral cortex.Electroencephalogr. Clin. Neurophysiol. 1951; 3: 449-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar. Indeed, intracellular recordings from cortical neurons demonstrated a close correspondence between LFP and EEG activity and synaptic potentials (Creutzfeldt et al., 1966Creutzfeldt O.D. Watanabe S.

Postsynaptic potentials in the cat's visual cortex following electrical stimulation of afferent pathways.Exp. Brain Res. 1966; 1: 272-283PubMed Google Scholar). At the same time, such measurements also showed that the slow wave activity in the EEG is largely independent of neuronal spiking responses (Ajmone-Marsan, 1965Ajmone-Marsan C.

The observation that slow wave potentials but not spiking activity is visible at the scalp surface was interpreted as an indication that cortical tissue possesses strong frequency-filtering properties (Bedard et al., 2004Bedard C.

Model of low-pass filtering of local field potentials in brain tissue.Phys. Rev. E Stat. Nonlin. Soft Matter Phys. 2006; 73: 051911Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Such frequency-dependent behavior was also suggested by experiments employing the typical extracellular unit recordings. Under most conditions, the amplitude of extracellularly recorded spikes is very sensitive to the position of the electrode (Gold et al., 2006Gold C. Henze D.A. Koch C. Buzsaki G. On the origin of the extracellular action potential waveform: A modeling study.J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 95: 3113-3128Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), while slow potentials show much less sensitivity to position. In addition, the spatial correlation of slow waves is found to extend over larger cortical distances (>7 mm) than that of the higher frequencies such as the gamma band (24–90 Hz) or spiking activity (Destexhe et al., 1999Destexhe A. Contreras D. Steriade M. Spatiotemporal analysis of local field potentials and unit discharges in cat cerebral cortex during natural wake and sleep states.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4595-4608PubMed Google Scholar). This differential spatial correlation provides additional support for the hypothesis that cortical tissue selectively filters frequencies; in other words, it suggests that cortical tissue has a non-flat impedance spectrum. A frequency-dependent impedance spectrum could selectively attenuate electric signals of some frequencies more than those of others—for example, high-frequency spiking events more than low-frequency potentials (Bedard et al., 2004Bedard C.

The simplest way to examine the cortical frequency-filter hypothesis is to measure the impedance spectrum directly. Impedance is a measure of the ability of a circuit to resist the flow of electrical current. In biological tissues the “circuit” is the volume conductor, consisting of various intra- and extracellular components of the brain tissue, and the “current” is generated by the movement of ions. Measurements of biological impedances have proved highly useful in understanding the propagation of electromagnetic waves in the body (Schwan, 1963Schwan H.P. Determination of Biological Impedances.in: Nastuk W.L. Physical Techniques in Biological Research. Academic Press, New York1963: 323-407Crossref Google Scholar, Schwan, 1999Schwan H.P. The practical success of impedance techniques from an historical perspective. Electrical bioimpedance methods.Applications to Medicine and Biotechnology. 1999; 873: 1-12Google Scholar), in identifying different brain regions under different physiological conditions, e.g., hypoxia (Van Harreveld and Ochs, 1956Van Harreveld A. Ochs S. Cerebral impedance changes after circulatory arrest.Am. J. Physiol. 1956; 187: 180-192PubMed Google Scholar), and in determining the anatomical and electrical characteristics of the cells, the interstitial space, and their interrelations (Freygang and Landau, 1955Freygang W.H. Landau W.M. Some relations between resistivity and electrical activity in the cerebral cortex of the cat.J. Cell. Comp. Physiol. 1955; 45: 377-392Crossref Google Scholar, Havstad, 1976Havstad, J.W.

Analysis of specific impedance of rabbit cerebral cortex.Exp. Neurol. 1963; 7: 153-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In basic and clinical neurosciences, the bioimpedance research provides information about the conductivity of tissues and helps the design of better models for electric currents and conductivity tensors, with very useful applications, including impedance encephalography and impedance tomography. Such models have been often used for the study of electrical injury mechanisms and pathology and can be also used to better understand the propagation of different neural signals. In the present study, precise measurements of the impedance of cortical tissue within gray and white matter of the monkey visual cortex showed no frequency dependence, regardless of the direction or depth of measurement. Our measurements were carried out using a novel, custom-made system that permits unbiased computation of cortical impedance using a five-point measurement technique. On the basis of our measurements and of concomitant simulations, we conclude that the cortical tissue has the properties of a simple ohmic conductor, which permits unbiased propagation of signals of any biologically relevant temporal frequency. The histological properties of brain tissue by themselves make it clear that the brain is not a homogeneous and isotropic medium. Most obvious, of course, are the differences in the histological properties of the gray and white matter, and it comes as not surprise that they also differ in electric resistance. Within a particular cortical area, however, the gray matter seems rather homogenous in a tangential direction, while cell density and myelination differ across layers, i.e., in a radial direction. Here we directly measured the cortical impedance spectrum in gray and white matter as well as along different tangential directions and in a radial direction. Figure 1 shows the frequency response of the cortical tissue in a series of measurements along tangential directions. The interelectrode distance was 3 mm, and the tip of the electrodes was 250 μm deep in the cortex (Figure 1A). Figure 1B displays the results for monkey B02. The initial impedance of the electrodes at 1 kHz was 450 kΩ and 70 kΩ for the two current electrodes, and 130 kΩ and 140 kΩ for the voltage electrodes, respectively. We tested frequencies in the range of 10 Hz to 5 kHz and different stimulation currents (see color code). As the figure clearly shows, the amplitude of the cortical resistance drops by only 1.9 dB as the frequency increases from 10 Hz to 5 kHz. For comparison purposes the figure also displays the frequency responses of a 20 μF and a 1.26 μF capacitor (dotted lines). The impedance of a capacitor drops by 6 dB when the frequency is only doubled. In the range of 10 Hz to 5 kHz, the drop for the 20 μF capacitor is 49.4 dB, which is much larger than the drop observed for the cortical tissue. The deviation from a completely flat response might be the result of measuring errors, or alternatively, a very small (practically insignificant) dependence on frequency may be a property of the tissue. In saline a drop of 1 dB from lower to higher frequencies is also typical (see below). The reproducibility of the measurements was verified by repeated measurements at the same cortical depth (250 μm) and using the same current (the three thick lines in Figure 1B, Reps1–3). The three repeats differ from each other by a maximum of 0.2 dB, demonstrating the high reliability of the measurement. In addition, we tested the linearity of the tissue by repeatedly lowering the current by factors of two from 20 μA down to 1.25 μA. No noticeable nonlinearities of the extracellular tissue were evident throughout the tested current range. The small signal increase in the two curves with the lowest current, around 60 Hz, is probably due to interference from the 50 Hz power supply; this interference is stronger because of the reduced signal-to-noise ratio at the low currents. Figure 1C shows the results of the same experiment with the second animal (R97). At the beginning of the experiment, three spectra were measured consecutively with an excitation current of 20 μA peak value. As shown in Figure 1C, the responses are flat within 1.5 dB, and the maximum difference between repeats is 0.33 dB. Testing linearity with different currents revealed the same results as with the animal B02, and most currents yielded very similar impedance spectra. Surprisingly, the responses obtained with the 2.5 μA and 1.25 μA currents were 1 dB and 2 dB higher than the response at 5 μA, an observation that would seem to suggest the existence of a nonlinearity (current-dependant resistance). However, repeating a measurement with a 20 μA current immediately after the measurement with 1.25 μA revealed that the 1.25 μA and 20 μA spectra overlapped. This strongly suggests that the difference probably results from a slight movement of the electrode or cortical tissue in, between, or during the 2.5 and 1.25 μA measurements, but not from a current dependency of the impedance spectrum. The notion that the gray matter impedance spectrum is flat for all directions is further corroborated by measurements at different distances from the surface (point of penetration in the dura mater) and different orientations of the electrodes. In Figure 2, all four electrodes were advanced in seven steps from 250 μm to 3250 μm, and the impedance spectrum was recorded using an excitation current of 20 μA peak. Within the gray matter (approximately depths above 2000 μm), the spectrum is clearly flat for all depths, and the drop-off is less than 2.0 dB within the range of 10 Hz to 5 kHz. Importantly, the same flat impedance behavior was found for measurements where the four-electrode system was oriented in a mediolateral direction (Figure 2B) and in an anterior-posterior direction (Figure 2C) in the same animal. This not only demonstrates a flat impedance spectrum, but also reveals comparable impedance in different tangential directions, suggesting that the impedance spectrum is isotropic within the tangential plane. However, when advancing the electrodes into white matter—a transition that was also verified electrophysiologically—we consistently noticed an abrupt change in impedance. Importantly, the impedance of the white matter showed a strong dependency on the direction of measurement: while measurements in the mediolateral direction revealed a decrease of impedance at the gray-white matter transition (Figure 2B), measurements in the anterior-posterior direction revealed an increase (Figure 2C). Importantly, the impedance spectrum of the white matter was again frequency independent, and all measured values were within 2.5 dB in the measured frequency range. This anisotropy of the white matter, as well as the isotropy of the gray matter, are also clearly evident in Figure 2D, which displays the average impedance (over all frequencies) as a function of cortical depth. In addition to testing the frequency responses of the cortical tissue, we also examined the phase shift between the voltage and the excitation current at four different cortical depths. Figure 3 shows nearly zero phase shift at low frequencies and a drop to about −13° at higher frequencies. As these numbers are not intuitively clear, we compared them to the phase shift observed in a resistive load (simple resistor) and in saline. The resistor showed a drop of −5.5°, while measurements in saline typically yielded a drop of about −10°. Given the similarity of the numbers obtained in gray matter and saline, we conclude that there is no significant phase shift in cortex between the current and the voltage, independent of frequency and depth. Impedance measurements were also conducted between points at different cortical depths, hence in a radial direction. For such measurements the interelectrode distance must be optimized to permit the crosstalk-free measurement of points differing as little as possible along the horizontal direction. Measurements from sulci were impractical with respect to precise placement of the electrode arrays. Instead, a special electrode arrangement and a modified electrode drive were used for measurements in the gyral cortex. A commercial seven-electrode drive (Thomas Recording, GmbH, Giessen) was modified, both mechanically and electronically, to ensure compatibility with the previous measurements. In addition, to avoid crosstalk between the electrode wires, metal plates were added between every electrode wire inside the shielded drive case. Figure 4 illustrates the impedance spectra recorded at different depths and radial electrode distances. For each measurement, the upper panel indicates the depths of the electrode tips and shows a sketch of their relative alignment. In the first series (black lines, 1–4) the current electrodes had a fixed distance of 2130 μm, while the distance between the voltage electrodes was varied by lowering the U+ electrode (measurements 1–3) and by reversing the position of the voltage electrodes (4). Again, the frequency dependence of the impedance spectra was small, regardless of the distance between the electrodes. This demonstrates that the conductivity of the gray matter is frequency independent along the radial direction. In addition, these measurements confirm that the approximation of the cortical tissue by a series of impedances, as depicted in Figure 7C (Experimental Procedures), is only an approximation. For example, changing the distance between the voltage and current electrodes while keeping the distance of the two voltage electrodes fixed (orange lines 5–6 and red lines 7–8) alters the measured signal gain. From 5 to 6 the arrangement of the electrodes was altered altogether, and the voltage electrodes were no longer positioned in between the current electrodes. From 7 to 8 one current electrode was moved further away from the voltage electrodes. In both cases, the measured signal gain is larger when the current electrode is closer to the voltage electrodes which would not be expected from the simple three-resistor model. This results from a larger electric potential induced at the voltage electrode when the stimulating electrodes are closer (see theoretical analysis in the following section), and hence shows that the distance between the current and the voltage electrode cannot be approximated easily by simple impedances (Z+, ZT, and Z−), as shown in Figure 7D. More importantly, these measurements confirm that the flat impedance spectrum does not result from a specific arrangement of the measurement system, and they support the theoretical arguments provided below. Our results have certain implications with respect to signal propagation in cortex and the relative spatial specificity of action and field potentials. To obtain a better understanding of these, the following section provides a theoretical analysis of the currents and potentials for sources in a homogenous and isotropic ohmic medium and for similar electrode configurations as used in the in vivo and in vitro experiments. Neurons are considered to be embedded in an extracellular medium that acts as a volume conductor (Lorente de Nó, 1947Lorente de Nó R. A study of nerve physiology, Part 2, Chapter XVI. Analysis of the distribution of action currents of nerve in volume conductors.Studies from the Rockefeller Institute Medical Res. 1947; 132: 384-477PubMed Google Scholar) (for a detailed review on field potentials, see Freeman, 1975Freeman W.J.

Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1989Google Scholar, Johnston and Wu, 1995Johnston D. Wu S.M. Foundations of Cellular Neurophysiology. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1995Google Scholar). When the membrane potential between two separate regions of such a neuron differs, there is a flow of current in the neuron matched by a return current through the extracellular path. Active regions of the membrane are considered to act as a current sink, inactive ones as a source for the active regions. Such extracellular field potentials add up linearly and algebraically throughout the volume conductor (the principle of electric superposition). Inside the physiological frequency range (0 to about 5 kHz), the inductive, magnetic, and propagative (wave) effects of the bioelectrical signals in the extracellular space can be neglected (Aidley, 1989Aidley D.J. The Physiology of Excitable Cells. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1989Google Scholar, Robinson, 1968Robinson D.A. The electric properties of metal microelectrodes.Proc. IEEE. 1968; 56: 1065-1071Crossref Scopus (339) Google Scholar), permitting the description of the current electrode as a simple static point source (McIntyre and Grill, 2001McIntyre C.C. Grill W.M.

Eng. 2001; 29: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) that can be described using Ohm's law. As detailed in the Supplemental Data available with this article online, using Ampere's law one can derive the following expressions for the electric potential U and the current density j of a point source (which is assumed to be at the origin of the coordinate system):j→(r→)=I4π⋅r−2⋅e→r(1) U(r)=14πIρ1r(2) whereby e→r is the unity vector in the radial direction, r→denotes the position vector, I is the current, and ρ is the specific electric resistance (also known as electrical resistivity). To obtain the electric potential in the field induced by two current sources, one acting as source (I+) and one as sink (I−) as in our in vivo experiments, we can use the principle of superposition. Using the coordinate system depicted in Figure 5, and taking the distance between the electrodes as 2z [with z→=(0,0,z))]:j→(r→)=j→+(r→)+j→−(r→)withj→+(r→)=I4π⋅|r→−z→|−2⋅r→−z→|r→−z→|andj→−(r→)=−I4π⋅|r→+z→|−2⋅r→+z→|r→+z→|,whereby the fractions represent the current directions e→r. Combining these equations, we obtainj→(r→)=I4π[r→−z→|r→−z→|3−r→+z→|r→+z→|3](3) Similarly, we add the voltage from single electrodes (Equation 2) to obtain the total voltage of the dipole:U(r→)=U+(r→)+U−(r→)=14πIρ[|r→−z→|−1−|r→+z→|−1](4) The graphical representation of the results of Equations (3), (4) are shown in Figure 5B, with the constants taken from saline-bath experiments [see section 4.4: ρ = 0.664 Ωm, z = 3 mm, I = 20 μApk, the I+ electrode at (0, +3 mm) and the I− electrode at (0, −3 mm)]. To illustrate the dipole field, Figure 5B shows 17 isopotential lines from −800 μV to +800 μV in the x-z plane, as well as the streamlines of the current vector field. This electrode configuration can be used to simulate the signal propagation in the brain. The I+ and the I− electrodes form a floating current source similar to a neuron. The current flows through the intracellular tissue in a manner similar to that illustrated in Figure 5. Perpendicular to this current direction there is a voltage potential that can be graphically depicted by the equipotential lines (circular lines in Figure 5B). Because the current source is floating and the point sources symmetrical, the center voltage line has zero volts, just like a distant, remote ground (Gnd). The sign of the recorded signal depends on the location of the recording electrode with respect to the zero-volt line. When the voltage is measured across two conductors (U+, U−), one at each side of the zero line, the amplitude of the voltage, as expected, will be twice as large. All above-mentioned relationships were examined by using our system and conducting measurements in saline. We performed systematic experiments in a saline bath using the same measurement system as used in the in vivo experiments. Figure 6A shows the electrode configuration used in the saline"
https://openalex.org/W2059040821,"Synaptic NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) play important roles in synaptic plasticity, brain development, and pathology. In the last few years, the view of NMDARs as relatively fixed components of the postsynaptic density has changed. A number of studies have now shown that both the number of receptors and their subunit compositions can be altered. During development, the synaptic NMDARs subunit composition changes, switching from predominance of NR2B-containing to NR2A-containing receptors, but little is known about the mechanisms involved in this developmental process. Here, we report that, depending on the pattern of NMDAR activation, the subunit composition of synaptic NMDARs is under extremely rapid, bidirectional control at neonatal synapses. This switching, which is at least as rapid as that seen with AMPARs, will have immediate and dramatic consequences on the integrative capacity of the synapse. Synaptic NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) play important roles in synaptic plasticity, brain development, and pathology. In the last few years, the view of NMDARs as relatively fixed components of the postsynaptic density has changed. A number of studies have now shown that both the number of receptors and their subunit compositions can be altered.

This switching, which is at least as rapid as that seen with AMPARs, will have immediate and dramatic consequences on the integrative capacity of the synapse. NMDARs are heteromeric cation channels composed of NR1 and NR2 subunits. These channels require the near simultaneous binding of glutamate and membrane depolarization to open, thus making this receptor the coincidence detector of pre- and postsynaptic activity underlying Hebbian synaptic plasticity. NMDAR channels display a high permeability to calcium, which, depending on the level of spine calcium, triggers either long-term potentiation (LTP) (high calcium) or long-term depression (LTD) (modest calcium) of AMPAR synaptic currents. The channel properties depend on the subunit composition of the receptor. All receptors require the presence of two NR1 subunits. The NR1 subunits in the hippocampus can assemble as heterodimers containing NR1/NR2A or NR1/NR2B or as heterotrimers containing NR1/NR2A/NR2B. NR2B receptors have a slower decay compared to NR2A receptors and are selectively blocked by the antagonist ifenprodil (Cull-Candy and Leszkiewicz, 2004Cull-Candy S.G. Leszkiewicz D.N. Role of distinct NMDA receptor subtypes at central synapses.Sci. STKE. 2004; 2004: re16Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). NR2B receptors are expressed early in development, while the expression of NR2A receptors increases during development (Monyer et al., 1994Monyer H. Burnashev N. Laurie D.J. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H.

Changing subunit composition of heteromeric NMDA receptors during development of rat cortex.Nature. 1994; 368: 144-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). These developmental changes are accompanied by an acceleration of the decay of the NMDA EPSC and a decrease in ifenprodil sensitivity (Kirson and Yaari, 1996Kirson E.D. Yaari Y. Synaptic NMDA receptors in developing mouse hippocampal neurones: functional properties and sensitivity to ifenprodil.J. Physiol. 1996; 497: 437-455PubMed Google Scholar). In the neocortex, these changes occur during the critical period of visual development, and the switch is influenced by experience (Carmignoto and Vicini, 1992Carmignoto G. Vicini S.

The discovery of subunit-specific antagonists for NMDARs, which are currently lacking for AMPARs, provides a powerful tool for studying possible subunit-specific trafficking of native synaptic receptors. In synaptic plasticity, NMDAR activation initiates a cascade of events that results in the rapid recruitment of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) into the synapse. Such receptor dynamics is not limited to the brain, as the density of acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction is dependent on activity as well (Akaaboune et al., 1999Akaaboune M. Culican S.M. Turney S.G. Lichtman J.W. Rapid and reversible effects of activity on acetylcholine receptor density at the neuromuscular junction in vivo.Science. 1999; 286: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Thus, a general picture of excitatory synapses has emerged in which excitatory neurotransmitter receptors are highly dynamic. In striking contrast, NMDARs have been viewed as relatively fixed structural components of the postsynaptic density; NMDARs initiate plasticity and AMPARs express the plasticity. Yet, there is evidence in the literature suggesting that this scenario may be too simplistic. In cultured neurons, synaptic NMDARs can exchange with extrasynaptic receptors (Groc et al., 2006Groc L. Heine M. Cousins S.L. Stephenson F.A. Lounis B. Cognet L. Choquet D. NMDA receptor surface mobility depends on NR2A-2B subunits.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Mobile NMDA receptors at hippocampal synapses.Neuron. 2002; 34: 255-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Moreover, changes in the number of receptors and subunits composition of NMDARs appear to be mediated by change in synthesis and degradation (Mu et al., 2003Mu Y. Otsuka T. Horton A.C. Scott D.B.

In addition, it is well established that a switch in the subunit composition of synaptic NMDARs occurs during postnatal development and that the time course of this process is governed by experience (Barth and Malenka, 2001Barth A.L.

However, little is known about the mechanisms involved in this developmental process. Here, we report that the subunit composition of synaptic NMDARs can quickly change in an activity-dependent manner at neonatal, but not mature, synapses. The change in subunit composition changes both the charge transfer and kinetics of synaptic NMDA EPSCs, which, in turn, would be expected to modify the activity requirements for evoking LTP and LTD. In this study, we examined whether activity can influence the trafficking of NMDARs in hippocampal pyramidal cells. We compared the kinetics of NMDAR synaptic currents and their sensitivity to 3 μM ifenprodil in neonatal and mature hippocampal slices. At a concentration of 3 μM, ifenprodil provides a maximal and selective block of NR1/NR2B diheteromeric receptors in heterologous expression systems (Williams, 1993Williams K. Ifenprodil discriminates subtypes of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor: selectivity and mechanisms at recombinant heteromeric receptors.Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 851-859PubMed Google Scholar). As previously reported, the sensitivity of NMDA EPSCs to ifenprodil is substantially greater in neonatal slices compared to older slices (Kirson and Yaari, 1996Kirson E.D. Yaari Y. Synaptic NMDA receptors in developing mouse hippocampal neurones: functional properties and sensitivity to ifenprodil.J. Physiol. 1996; 497: 437-455PubMed Google Scholar) (Figures 1A and 1B). We next examined the effect of development on the kinetics of the NMDA EPSC. In parallel with the decreased sensitivity of the peak current to ifenprodil with age, the kinetics of the NMDA EPSCs becomes considerably faster (Figures 1C and 1D). The acceleration of the NMDA EPSC by ifenprodil in neonatal slices (Figure 1D) indicates that the decay time provides a simple assay for the subunit composition of the synaptic NMDARs. Because the developmental switch of synaptic NMDAR subunit composition is influenced by experience, we wondered whether this switching process could be accelerated by activity in young animals. Indeed, in preliminary experiments in which we continuously monitored the NMDA EPSC at +40 mV over time in neonatal animals (2-9 days old), we noticed that the decay of the EPSC became faster (see Figure S1A in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). This acceleration did not occur if the recording pipette contained the calcium chelator BAPTA (Figure S1B) or if the EPSC was just sampled briefly at specific time points (Figure S1C). To study the effect of activity on the NMDA EPSC in a controlled manner, we stimulated two independent pathways and monitored the AMPA EPSC at −70 mV. We then induced LTP on one pathway, while using the other pathway as a control (Figure 2A). After establishing LTP of the AMPA EPSC, NBQX was applied to selectively block AMPARs, and the cell was depolarized to +40 mV to unblock the NMDARs. A comparison of the decay time between the control, naive pathway and the LTP pathway consistently revealed that the NMDA EPSC in the LTP pathway decayed more rapidly than the NMDA EPSC in the control pathway (0.33 ± 0.02 s in test pathway versus 0.45 ± 0.02 s in control pathway; n = 14, p < 0.001) (Figure 2B). In a separate set of experiments we found that the change in kinetics was still present 60 min after the induction of LTP (Figure 2B). We also demonstrated that the LTP of the AMPA EPSC was stable for at least an hour (Figure S1D). To determine whether this change in kinetics actually reflects a loss of NR2B-containing receptors, we then applied ifenprodil (Figure 2C). The NMDA EPSC in the LTP pathway was found to be much less sensitive to the antagonist. In addition, the effect of ifenprodil on the decay was diminished (Figure 2D), confirming the loss of NR2B-containing receptors after LTP. LTP of the AMPA EPSC requires a rise in postsynaptic calcium. We therefore examined the effect of loading the postsynaptic cell with the calcium chelator BAPTA. In this condition, no change in the decay of the NMDA EPSC was seen after pairing (0.44 ± 0.02 s versus 0.40 ± 0.04 s; n = 6, data not shown). The experiments thus far have relied on a cross-pathway comparison to determine the effects of LTP on NR2 subunit composition. We next carried out the entire experiment in the presence of NBQX so that we could compare the effect of LTP on the same pathway. In addition, this experiment allowed us to examine the time course of the change in kinetics after LTP induction. A clear acceleration of the decay of the NMDA EPSC was evident immediately after the pairing protocol within the first 30 s and was fully established by 5 min (0.42 ± 0.02 s before versus 0.37 ± 0.01 s [1–30 s], p < 0.05 and 0.33 ± 0.01 s [5 min], p < 0.001 after LTP induction; n = 23, 11, 12) (Figure 2E). Does LTP cause a selective loss of NR2B-containing receptors, or is there actually a replacement of the lost NR2B-containing receptors with NR2A-containing receptors? If there were simply a loss of NR2B-containing receptors, one would expect the size of the NMDA EPSC to decrease following LTP. However, on average, there was no change in the size of the NMDA EPSC (Figure 2F). This finding, then, favors a swapping of NR2B receptors for NR2A receptors. To test this idea directly, we repeated the experiments in the presence of ifenprodil and monitored only NR2A receptors. In this case, the size of the NMDA EPSC should increase after LTP, if LTP is associated with an insertion of NR2A receptors. Indeed, in the presence of ifenprodil the size of the NMDA EPSC increases following LTP (Figure 2F) (193.9 ± 35.5 pA, n = 8; significantly different from 123.3 ± 12.8 pA, n = 12; p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney test). Importantly, in the presence of ifenprodil LTP was not associated with a change in decay time (0.31 ± 0.02 versus 0.27 ± 0.03). It is well established that, following the induction of LTP, synapses can be depotentiated with low-frequency stimulation (Fujii et al., 1991Fujii S. Saito K. Miyakawa H. Ito K. Kato H. Reversal of long-term potentiation (depotentiation) induced by tetanus stimulation of the input to CA1 neurons of guinea pig hippocampal slices.Brain Res. 1991; 555: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, O'Dell and Kandel, 1994O'Dell T.J. Kandel E.R. Low-frequency stimulation erases LTP through an NMDA receptor-mediated activation of protein phosphatases.Learn. Mem. 1994; 1: 129-139PubMed Google Scholar). Can depotentiating stimuli reverse the subunit switching observed with LTP? We first did a series of experiments monitoring the AMPA EPSC to determine whether neonatal synapses are capable of being depotentiated. LTP was first induced by pairing at 0 mV. Following LTP, the synapses were stimulated at 1 Hz while holding the cell at −40 mV. A clear depotentiation was recorded (Figure 3A). It should be noted that in a separate set of experiments we show that the LTP in our conditions remains stable for at least an hour (Figure S1D). Having established that AMPA EPSCs can be depotentiated in the neonate, we repeated the entire experiment in the presence of NBQX. As shown in Figure 3B, LTP accelerated the EPSC decay in all cells, and this acceleration was reversed by depotentiation. These clear changes in kinetics were associated with a corresponding change in the sensitivity of the EPSC to ifenprodil (Figure 3C). We also considered the possibility that LTD in neonatal slices (Bolshakov and Siegelbaum, 1994Bolshakov V.Y. Siegelbaum S.A. Postsynaptic induction and presynaptic expression of hippocampal long-term depression.Science. 1994; 264: 1148-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, Oliet et al., 1997Oliet S.H. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Two distinct forms of long-term depression coexist in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells.Neuron. 1997; 18: 969-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) might, on its own, slow the NMDA EPSC. Despite generating robust LTD of the AMPA EPSC, we were unable to detect any change in the kinetics of the NMDA EPSC or a change in ifenprodil sensitivity after the induction of LTD (Figure S2). A final question is whether the dramatic bidirectional plasticity we observe in young animals can also be seen in older animals. We recorded responses from two largely independent pathways and induced LTP in one of these pathways (Figure 4A). NBQX was then applied, and the membrane potential shifted to +40 mV. We observed no difference in the kinetics (Figure 4B) or the ifenprodil sensitivity (Figure 4C) following LTP. Perhaps this lack of effect is due to synapse maturation occluding the effects of LTP, i.e., all the NR2B subunits that can be removed had already been removed by maturation. In this case, one might expect that with LTD NR2B receptors could be recruited back to the synapse. To test this, we stimulated two independent pathways in the presence of NBQX and then induced LTD on one pathway by pairing 1 Hz stimulation while holding the cell at −40 mV (Selig et al., 1995Selig D.K. Hjelmstad G.O. Herron C. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. Independent mechanisms for long-term depression of AMPA and NMDA responses.Neuron. 1995; 15: 417-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). After establishing the presence of LTD on the NMDA EPSC, we depolarized the cell to +40 mV and compared the kinetics and ifenprodil sensitivity of the two pathways. We could detect no change in either the kinetics (Figure 4E) or the ifenprodil sensitivity (Figure 4F). Thus, the remarkable receptor switching seen in young animals is completely lost during development. These findings contrast with a study in which surface receptors were measured with biotinylation, and LTP-inducing stimuli were found to cause a change in subunit composition (Grosshans et al., 2002Grosshans D.R. Clayton D.A. Coultrap S.J. Browning M.D. LTP leads to rapid surface expression of NMDA but not AMPA receptors in adult rat CA1.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Presumably, the effects observed in this study reflected shifts in extrasynaptic pools of receptors. The present study establishes that at early ages synaptic NMDARs are at least as dynamic as AMPARs. LTP-inducing stimuli caused a switch in subunit composition within seconds and the change lasted for at least an hour. However, depotentiating stimuli rapidly reversed the change. Our data indicate that the activity-dependent loss of NR2B receptors is coincident with the simultaneous recruitment of NR2A receptors. How this swapping of receptors is coordinated is unclear, but is likely to be dependent on the differences in the C terminus of the two receptor subunits and the partners with which they interact (Barria and Malinow, 2005Barria A.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8253-8264Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and removal of NMDARs during synaptic depression has been reported to be either dynamin dependent (Montgomery et al., 2005Montgomery J.M.

Activity-dependent plasticity of the NMDA-receptor fractional Ca2+ current.Neuron. 2007; 53: 17-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). PDZ protein interactions are thought to be critical for maintaining NMDARs at synapses, while interaction with AP-2 is an important determinant of the number of synaptic NR2B-containing NMDARs (Prybylowski et al., 2005Prybylowski K. Chang K. Sans N. Kan L. Vicini S. Wenthold R.J. The synaptic localization of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors is controlled by interactions with PDZ proteins and AP-2.Neuron. 2005; 47: 845-857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Lastly, lateral diffusion may also play an important role in controlling the number of synaptic NMDARs by allowing receptors to move between synaptic to extrasynaptic sites (Choquet and Triller, 2003Choquet D. Triller A. The role of receptor diffusion in the organization of the postsynaptic membrane.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 251-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, Tovar and Westbrook, 2002Tovar K.R. Westbrook G.L. Mobile NMDA receptors at hippocampal synapses.Neuron. 2002; 34: 255-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Ifenprodil is the first and best-characterized NMDAR antagonist shown to discriminate between NR2A- and NR2B-containing receptors, being more than 100-fold more selective for NR2B- over NR2A-containing receptors (Williams, 1993Williams K. Ifenprodil discriminates subtypes of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor: selectivity and mechanisms at recombinant heteromeric receptors.Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 851-859PubMed Google Scholar). However, the effect of ifenprodil on triheteromeric receptors is not entirely clear. Hatton and Paoletti (Hatton and Paoletti, 2005Hatton C.J. Paoletti P. Modulation of triheteromeric NMDA receptors by N-terminal domain ligands.Neuron. 2005; 46: 261-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) suggest that triheteromeric receptors have high affinity for ifenprodil but are inhibited to only a small extent. The use of 3 μM ifenprodil in our experiments, which has no effect on NR2A-containing receptors, ensures that any observed sensitivity arises from the presence of an NMDAR that contains an NR2B subunit. However, given the uncertainty of ifenprodil's effect on triheteromeric receptors, we cannot exclude the presence of these receptors in our experiments. The change in decay time caused by LTP can be fully accounted for by changes in NR2B content of synaptic receptors, because in the presence of ifenprodil no change in kinetics occurs during LTP. The precise roles that NMDAR subunits play in synaptic plasticity are hotly debated (Bartlett et al., 2007Bartlett T.E. Bannister N.J. Collett V.J. Dargan S.L. Massey P.V. Bortolotto Z.A.

Activation of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors is not required for NMDA receptor-dependent long-term depression.Neuropharmacology. 2007; 52: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). One possible role for subunit switching at neonatal synapses is the rapid acquisition of timing precision and refinement of coincidence detection. LTP at neonatal thalamocortical synapses has been shown to produce an improvement in the timing of neuronal output to a give synaptic input (Daw et al., 2006Daw M.I. Bannister N.V. Isaac J.T. Rapid, activity-dependent plasticity in timing precision in neonatal barrel cortex.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 4178-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Despite this controversy, it is clear that the immediate replacement of NR2B receptors with NR2A receptors will transform the synapse from one that has a broad window for spike-timing plasticity to one in which the window is greatly reduced. Experiments were carried out according to the guidelines of UCSF Committee of Animal Research. Standard techniques were used to prepare transverse hippocampal slices (300 μm) from 2- to 21-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats, which were anesthetized with halothane. Slices were maintained at room temperature and allowed to recover for 1 hr before being transferred to the recording chamber, where they were submerged in a continuously superfusing solution at room temperature and equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. The external solutions contained (in mM) 119 mM NaCI, 2.5 mM KCI, 2.5 mM CaCI2, 1.3 mM MgSO4, 1.0 mM NaH2PO4, 26.2 mM NaHCO3, 11 mM glucose, and 0.1 mM picrotoxin (pH 7.4). For the experiment of LTD in young animals, the concentration of MgSO4 and CaCl2 was 4 mM during the recording. Evoked postsynaptic responses were induced in CA1 pyramidal cells by stimulating Schaffer collaterals in stratum radiatum (0.1 Hz) with monopolar glass pipettes. Studying possible activity-dependent changes in NMDA EPSCs is problematic because the very condition required to measure the NMDA EPSC also can be expected to initiate the process being investigated. We have designed two protocols to circumvent this problem. First, we designed a two-pathway experiment in which two stimulating electrodes were positioned on either side of the recording site in order to stimulate two nonoverlapping sets of synapses. After inducing LTP of the AMPA EPSC in one pathway, the cell was depolarized and the AMPA EPSC blocked. This allowed us to compare the NMDA EPSC of the LTP pathway to the NMDA EPSC of the naive control pathway. The second method was to briefly sample NMDA EPSCs in the presence of NBQX at different time points during the experiment, ensuring that the sampling was sufficiently brief as to not induce any changes (see Figure S1C). Somatic whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were made from CA1 pyramidal cells using 2–6 ΩM electrodes. The internal solution contained (in mM) 115 CsMeSO4, 20 CsCl2, 10 HEPES, 2.5 MgCl2, 4 NaATP, 0.4 NaGTP, 10 NaCreatine, and 0.6 EGTA (pH 7.2). Synaptic responses were collected with a Multiclamp 700B-amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), filtered at 2 kHz, digitized at 5 Hz, and analyzed online using Igor Pro software (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). All data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test was used for comparing paired observations; Mann-Whitney test was applied in the other case. Cells were held at −70 mV for AMPA EPSC recordings and at + 40 mV in presence of 10 μM NBQX for NMDA EPSC, except when otherwise indicated. To simplify the comparison of decay times across conditions, a single weighted decay measure (see Cathala et al., 2005Cathala L. Holderith N.B. Nusser Z. DiGregorio D.A. Cull-Candy S.G. Changes in synaptic structure underlie the developmental speeding of AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1310-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (referred in the text as decay time) was calculated from the area under the peak-normalized current for 1.3 s after the peak. To minimize possible voltage-clamp artifacts that can affect the kinetics of the NMDA EPSC, we limited the size of the EPSC to less than 200 pA. We also examined whether reducing the EPSC with APV altered the kinetics. APV (2.5 μM) reduced the EPSC to 64.6% ± 5.7% of control (n = 5), while the decay time did not change (before = 0.42 ± 0.02; after = 0.42 ± 0.02) (Figure S3). Presumably, the small size and limited dendritic branching of neonatal pyramidal cells minimizes space-clamp problems. Ifenprodil, NBQX, and AP-5 were obtained from Tocris Biosciences, UK.

https://openalex.org/W2050347424,"Current antidepressants are clinically effective only after several weeks of administration. Here, we show that serotonin4 (5-HT4) agonists reduce immobility in the forced swimming test, displaying an antidepressant potential. Moreover, a 3 day regimen with such compounds modifies rat brain parameters considered to be key markers of antidepressant action, but that are observed only after 2–3 week treatments with classical molecules: desensitization of 5-HT1A autoreceptors, increased tonus on hippocampal postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, and enhanced phosphorylation of the CREB protein and neurogenesis in the hippocampus. In contrast, a 3 day treatment with the SSRI citalopram remains devoid of any effect on these parameters. Finally, a 3 day regimen with the 5-HT4 agonist RS 67333 was sufficient to reduce both the hyperlocomotion induced by olfactory bulbectomy and the diminution of sucrose intake consecutive to a chronic mild stress. These findings point out 5-HT4 receptor agonists as a putative class of antidepressants with a rapid onset of action."
https://openalex.org/W2114908816,"In blood vessels, the endothelium is a crucial signal transduction interface in control of vascular tone and blood pressure to ensure energy and oxygen supply according to the organs' needs. In response to vasoactive factors and to shear stress elicited by blood flow, the endothelium secretes vasodilating or vasocontracting autacoids, which adjust the contractile state of the smooth muscle. In endothelial sensing of shear stress, the osmo- and mechanosensitive Ca(2+)-permeable TRPV4 channel has been proposed to be candidate mechanosensor. Using TRPV4(-/-) mice, we now investigated whether the absence of endothelial TRPV4 alters shear-stress-induced arterial vasodilation.In TRPV4(-/-) mice, loss of the TRPV4 protein was confirmed by Western blot, immunohistochemistry and by in situ-patch-clamp techniques in carotid artery endothelial cells (CAEC). Endothelium-dependent vasodilation was determined by pressure myography in carotid arteries (CA) from TRPV4(-/-) mice and wild-type littermates (WT). In WT CAEC, TRPV4 currents could be elicited by TRPV4 activators 4alpha-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate (4alphaPDD), arachidonic acid (AA), and by hypotonic cell swelling (HTS). In striking contrast, in TRPV4(-/-) mice, 4alphaPDD did not produce currents and currents elicited by AA and HTS were significantly reduced. 4alphaPDD caused a robust and endothelium-dependent vasodilation in WT mice, again conspicuously absent in TRPV4(-/-) mice. Shear stress-induced vasodilation could readily be evoked in WT, but was completely eliminated in TRPV4(-/-) mice. In addition, flow/reperfusion-induced vasodilation was significantly reduced in TRPV4(-/-) vs. WT mice. Vasodilation in response to acetylcholine, vasoconstriction in response to phenylephrine, and passive mechanical compliance did not differ between genotypes, greatly underscoring the specificity of the above trpv4-dependent phenotype for physiologically relevant shear stress.Genetically encoded loss-of-function of trpv4 results in a loss of shear stress-induced vasodilation, a response pattern critically dependent on endothelial TRPV4 expression. Thus, Ca(2+)-influx through endothelial TRPV4 channels is a molecular mechanism contributing significantly to endothelial mechanotransduction."
https://openalex.org/W2138421970,"Background Determination of seabird diet usually relies on the analysis of stomach-content remains obtained through stomach flushing; this technique is both invasive and logistically difficult. We evaluate the usefulness of DNA-based faecal analysis in a dietary study on chick-rearing macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) at Heard Island. Conventional stomach-content data was also collected, allowing comparison of the approaches. Methodology/Principal Findings Prey-specific PCR tests were used to detect dietary DNA in faecal samples and amplified prey DNA was cloned and sequenced. Of the 88 faecal samples collected, 39 contained detectable DNA from one or more of the prey groups targeted with PCR tests. Euphausiid DNA was most commonly detected in the early (guard) stage of chick-rearing, and detection of DNA from the myctophid fish Krefftichthys anderssoni and amphipods became more common in samples collected in the later (crèche) stage. These trends followed those observed in the penguins' stomach contents. In euphausiid-specific clone libraries the proportion of sequences from the two dominant euphausiid prey species (Euphausia vallentini and Thysanoessa macrura) changed over the sampling period; again, this reflected the trend in the stomach content data. Analysis of prey sequences in universal clone libraries revealed a higher diversity of fish prey than identified in the stomachs, but non-fish prey were not well represented. Conclusions/Significance The present study is one of the first to examine the full breadth of a predator's diet using DNA-based faecal analysis. We discuss methodological difficulties encountered and suggest possible refinements. Overall, the ability of the DNA-based approach to detect temporal variation in the diet of macaroni penguins indicates this non-invasive method will be generally useful for monitoring population-level dietary trends in seabirds."
https://openalex.org/W2032734258,"Background Type 2 diabetes arises when insulin resistance-induced compensatory insulin secretion exhausts. Insulin resistance and/or β-cell dysfunction result from the interaction of environmental factors (high-caloric diet and reduced physical activity) with a predisposing polygenic background. Very recently, genetic variations within four novel genetic loci (SLC30A8, HHEX, EXT2, and LOC387761) were reported to be more frequent in subjects with type 2 diabetes than in healthy controls. However, associations of these variations with insulin resistance and/or β-cell dysfunction were not assessed. Methodology/Principal Findings By genotyping of 921 metabolically characterized German subjects for the reported candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we show that the major alleles of the SLC30A8 SNP rs13266634 and the HHEX SNP rs7923837 associate with reduced insulin secretion stimulated by orally or intravenously administered glucose, but not with insulin resistance. In contrast, the other reported type 2 diabetes candidate SNPs within the EXT2 and LOC387761 loci did not associate with insulin resistance or β-cell dysfunction, respectively. Conclusions/Significance The HHEX and SLC30A8 genes encode for proteins that were shown to be required for organogenesis of the ventral pancreas and for insulin maturation/storage, respectively. Therefore, the major alleles of type 2 diabetes candidate SNPs within these genetic loci represent crucial alleles for β-cell dysfunction and, thus, might confer increased susceptibility of β-cells towards adverse environmental factors."
https://openalex.org/W2013895597,"Neurexins have been proposed to function as major mediators of the coordinated pre- and postsynaptic apposition. However, key evidence for this role in vivo has been lacking, particularly due to gene redundancy. Here, we have obtained null mutations in the single Drosophila neurexin gene (dnrx). dnrx loss of function prevents the normal proliferation of synaptic boutons at glutamatergic neuromuscular junctions, while dnrx gain of function in neurons has the opposite effect. DNRX mostly localizes to the active zone of presynaptic terminals. Conspicuously, dnrx null mutants display striking defects in synaptic ultrastructure, with the presence of detachments between pre- and postsynaptic membranes, abnormally long active zones, and increased number of T bars. These abnormalities result in corresponding alterations in synaptic transmission with reduced quantal content. Together, our results provide compelling evidence for an in vivo role of neurexins in the modulation of synaptic architecture and adhesive interactions between pre- and postsynaptic compartments."
https://openalex.org/W2001067717,"A central theoretical goal of epidemiology is the construction of spatial models of disease prevalence and risk, including maps for the potential spread of infectious disease. We provide three continent-wide maps representing the relative risk of malaria in Africa based on ecological niche models of vector species and risk analysis at a spatial resolution of 1 arc-minute (9 185 275 cells of approximately 4 sq km). Using a maximum entropy method we construct niche models for 10 malaria vector species based on species occurrence records since 1980, 19 climatic variables, altitude, and land cover data (in 14 classes). For seven vectors (Anopheles coustani, A. funestus, A. melas, A. merus, A. moucheti, A. nili, and A. paludis) these are the first published niche models. We predict that Central Africa has poor habitat for both A. arabiensis and A. gambiae, and that A. quadriannulatus and A. arabiensis have restricted habitats in Southern Africa as claimed by field experts in criticism of previous models. The results of the niche models are incorporated into three relative risk models which assume different ecological interactions between vector species. The ""additive"" model assumes no interaction; the ""minimax"" model assumes maximum relative risk due to any vector in a cell; and the ""competitive exclusion"" model assumes the relative risk that arises from the most suitable vector for a cell. All models include variable anthrophilicity of vectors and spatial variation in human population density. Relative risk maps are produced from these models. All models predict that human population density is the critical factor determining malaria risk. Our method of constructing relative risk maps is equally general. We discuss the limits of the relative risk maps reported here, and the additional data that are required for their improvement. The protocol developed here can be used for any other vector-borne disease."
https://openalex.org/W2130730062,"Neuronal network formation in the developing nervous system is dependent on the accurate navigation of nerve cell axons and dendrites, which is controlled by attractive and repulsive guidance cues. Ephrins and their cognate Eph receptors mediate many repulsive axonal guidance decisions by intercellular interactions resulting in growth cone collapse and axon retraction of the Eph-presenting neuron. We show that the Rac-specific GTPase-activating protein alpha2-chimaerin binds activated EphA4 and mediates EphA4-triggered axonal growth cone collapse. alpha-Chimaerin mutant mice display a phenotype similar to that of EphA4 mutant mice, including aberrant midline axon guidance and defective spinal cord central pattern generator activity. Our results reveal an alpha-chimaerin-dependent signaling pathway downstream of EphA4, which is essential for axon guidance decisions and neuronal circuit formation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2021397048,"Naturally occurring DNA sequences that are able to form unusual DNA structures have been shown to be mutagenic, and in some cases the mutagenesis induced by these sequences is enhanced by their transcription. It is possible that transcription-coupled DNA repair induced at sites of transcription arrest might be involved in this mutagenesis. Thus, it is of interest to determine whether there are correlations between the mutagenic effects of such noncanonical DNA structures and their ability to arrest transcription. We have studied T7 RNA polymerase transcription through the sequence from the nuclease-sensitive element of the human c-MYC promoter, which is mutagenic in mammalian cells (Wang, G., Kim, K. M. (2004) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 101,13448-13453). This element has two mirror-symmetric homopurine-homopyrimidine blocks that potentially can form either DNA triplex (H-DNA) or quadruplex structures. We detected truncated transcription products indicating partial transcription arrest within and closely downstream of the element. The arrest required negative supercoiling and was much more pronounced when the pyrimidine-rich strand of the element served as the template. The exact positions of arrest sites downstream from the element depended upon the downstream flanking sequences. We made various nucleotide substitutions in the wild-type sequence from the c-MYC nuclease-sensitive element that specifically destabilize either the triplex or the quadruplex structure. When these substitutions were ranked for their effects on transcription, the results implicated the triplex structure in the transcription arrest. We suggest that transcription-induced triplex formation enhances pre-existing weak transcription pause sites within the flanking sequences by creating steric obstacles for the transcription machinery.

We suggest that transcription-induced triplex formation enhances pre-existing weak transcription pause sites within the flanking sequences by creating steric obstacles for the transcription machinery. In addition to its primary function in protein synthesis, transcription plays an important role in gene regulation and genome modification. Transcription through a particular DNA region can also increase the rate of mutation in this region (transcription-assisted mutagenesis) or create a hot spot for homologous recombination (transcription-assisted recombination) (reviewed in Ref. 1Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Both of these phenomena can occur as a consequence of the DNA opening during transcription, because single-stranded DNA is more sensitive than double-stranded DNA to attack from a number of agents, including some DNA-modifying enzymes. In some cases, transcription-induced mutagenesis is enhanced by the formation of an unusually stable RNA-DNA hybrid and/or secondary structure in the nontemplate strand, both of which stabilize R-loops, thus prolonging DNA opening (for example see Refs. 2Duquette M.L. Kim P. Vincent J.A. Taylor A.F. Maizels N. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1618-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 3Duquette M.L. Kim P. Goodman M.F. Maizels N. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5791-5798Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These two pathways, however, are not necessarily associated with transcription pausing or arrest. A special pathway of DNA processing associated with transcription arrest is transcription-coupled DNA repair (TCR) 3The abbreviations used are: TCR, transcription-coupled DNA repair; WT, wild type.3The abbreviations used are: TCR, transcription-coupled DNA repair; WT, wild type. (see Refs. 4Mellon I. Kim G. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1987; 51: 241-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, 5Mellon I. Kim P.C. Nature. 1989; 342: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar and reviewed in Refs. 6Hanawalt P.C. Science. 1994; 266: 1957-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 7Hanawalt P.C.

Trends Genet. 2006; 22: 430-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). TCR manifests itself as a preferential repair of DNA lesions (for example pyrimidine photodimers) in the template strand versus the nontemplate strand. This sub-pathway of nucleotide excision repair involves dedicated enzymatic machinery to displace the RNA polymerase and to provide an accelerated recovery of functionally important genes as well as clearing the DNA template for replication and other transactions. According to our current model for TCR, when RNA polymerase becomes arrested upon encountering a lesion in the template strand, the arrested RNA polymerase interacts with specific TCR factors, and this interaction serves as a signal for excision of the lesion and subsequent DNA repair synthesis (reviewed in Refs. 6Hanawalt P.C. Science. 1994; 266: 1957-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 7Hanawalt P.C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8949-8956Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). It was suggested that not only template DNA lesions, but also other factors that arrest transcribing RNA polymerase, might initiate TCR, leading to DNA excision and repair synthesis, resulting in mutations near the area of arrest (6Hanawalt P.C. Science. 1994; 266: 1957-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The report that mutagenesis induced by triplex-forming DNA oligonucleotides, which are known to arrest transcription, appeared to be dependent upon TCR factors, supports this hypothesis (10Wang G. Kim M.M. Glazer P.M. Science. 1996; 271: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The “gratuitous” TCR hypothesis predicts that naturally occurring DNA sequences, which present an obstacle for transcription, could be hot spots for mutations. Among the sequences that can be obstacles for transcription are those that can form unusual (i.e. non-B-form) DNA structures. These structures are known to interfere with a number of the enzymes that operate on DNA, and they cause genomic instability in many systems (reviewed in Refs. 11Wang G. Kim K.M. Mutat. Res. 2006; 598: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 12Mirkin S.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2006; 16: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 13Bacolla A. Kim M. Kosmider B. Larson J.E. Wells R.D. DNA Repair. 2006; 5: 1161-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This study focuses upon unusual DNA structure(s), which can be formed in the sequence from the nuclease-sensitive element of the human c-MYC promoter (14Firulli A.B. Kim D.C. Kinniburgh A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This element was shown to be mutagenic in mammalian cells, and it was suggested that formation of an unusual DNA structure, intramolecular triplex or H-DNA, could be responsible for this effect (15Wang G. Kim K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13448-13453Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It is important to point out that although the nuclease-sensitive element from the c-MYC gene is localized upstream of c-MYC promoters P1 and P2, which are most commonly used in normal cells in nontranslocated alleles of the gene (reviewed in Ref. 16Marcu K.B. Kim S.A. Patel A.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 809-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is localized downstream of an alternative promoter P0; consequently, the element would be transcribed when transcription is initiated from the P0 promoter. Transcription from the P0 promoter includes about 1% in normal cells in nontranslocated alleles, but it is more abundant in translocated alleles of the gene or in some cancer cells (17Eick D. Kim A. Kofler E. Lenoir G.M. Rickinson A.B. Bornkamm G.W. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1397-1402PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hoover R.G. Kim V. Lary C. Travis P. Sneed T. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 194: 257-264PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to serving as a model prototype of the effect on transcription of naturally occurring H-DNA-forming sequences, the transcription through this element might have direct biological relevance. H-DNA forms within homopurine-homopyrimidine mirror-symmetrical repeats or H-palindromes (Fig. 1A) (reviewed in Ref. 19Mirkin S.M. Kim M.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 541-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Upon H-DNA formation, the DNA double helix within one-half of the H-palindrome denatures into two single strands, and one of these complementary strands folds back to form a DNA triplex with the nondenatured half of the H-palindrome, whereas the other strand remains denatured. The presence of denatured regions makes this structure hypersensitive to single strand-specific endonucleases, like S1, which are commonly used for detection of H-DNA. Because H-DNA is topologically equivalent to complete unwinding of the entire region that participates in the structure formation, it is stabilized by negative supercoiling. Within H-DNA, the triplex is stabilized by either Hoogsteen (YRY triplex) or reverse Hoogsteen (RRY triplex) interactions, depending upon whether the pyrimidine or the purine-rich strand participates in the triplex formation. (Sometimes the YRY triplex-containing structure is referred to as H-DNA or H-y-DNA, and the RRY triplex-containing structure is referred to as H*-DNA or H-r-DNA. For simplicity, we will refer to all of these structures as H-DNA.) Because the YRY triplex requires cytosine protonation in the third strand, and consequently is stabilized by low pH, the RRY triplex is usually considered to be the more favored structure under physiological conditions, especially for G-rich sequences. Fig. 1B illustrates possible RRY triplex-containing H-DNA structures within the nuclease-sensitive element of the c-MYC promoter. However, H-DNA is not the only unusual structure able to form at this sequence. If a DNA strand contains more than four closely localized guanine blocks that have three or more guanines each, this strand can fold into another unusual DNA structure, a DNA quadruplex stabilized by G-quartets (reviewed in Ref. 20Davis J.T. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2004; 43: 668-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). DNA quadruplexes are known to form in many biologically important sequences, including telomeres (reviewed in Ref. 20Davis J.T. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2004; 43: 668-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar) and regulatory elements of the c-MYC promoter similar to the one used in this study (21Simonsson T. Kim P. Kubista M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1167-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 22Yang D. Kim L.H. Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids. 2006; 25: 951-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Therefore, one has to determine whether one or both of these structures, triplex or quadruplex, is responsible for the effects caused by the G-rich H-palindrome sequence. Here we have studied the effect on T7 RNA polymerase transcription elongation of the wild-type sequence from the nuclease-sensitive element from the c-MYC promoter and similar sequences with various nucleotide substitutions, which allow us to examine the contributions from the triplex and the quadruplex to the observed effects. Transcription Substrates—All inserts containing the sequence from the nuclease-sensitive element of the c-MYC promoter and its various substitutions (Fig. 2) were cloned into BamHI/XhoI sites of pUCGTG-TS plasmid (23Tornaletti S. Kim S.M. Turchi J.J. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35791-35797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) 252 bp downstream from the T7 promoter. Plasmids pWT-ribo and pWT-Rev-ribo were obtained by inserting a ribozyme sequence from RiboCop plasmid (Sigma) into the corresponding plasmid 0.3 kb downstream from the c-MYC sequence. Plasmids were propagated in DH5α Escherichia coli cells (Invitrogen), and purified using Qiagen maxi-prep kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, except that the time of the cell lysis step was reduced to several seconds. When substrates were gel-purified, the QIAquick gel purification protocol (Qiagen) was used with the following modifications. (i) To avoid ethidium bromide (EtBr) contamination or UV exposure of the transcription substrates, preparative gels were run without EtBr. The DNA bands of interest were localized by comparison with a gel slice containing a small amount of the sample that was cut from the same gel, stained with EtBr, and UV-irradiated. Thus, the DNA actually used in our experiments was neither stained nor UV-irradiated. (ii) The agarose-dissolving step of purification was performed for 40 min at room temperature instead of 10 min at 50 °C. To obtain plasmids with various degrees of supercoiling, 2 μg of plasmid DNA were incubated with 2 units of wheat germ topoisomerase I (Sigma) and various concentrations of EtBr during incubation for 2 h in 200 μl of the buffer containing 35 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1.8 mm spermidine, 6.5% glycerol, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Then proteins and EtBr were removed by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) extraction, followed by chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Then samples were rinsed twice with 100 μl of 70% ethanol, dried, and dissolved in 12 μl of TE buffer (pH 7.9). Supercoiling of the samples was analyzed on agarose/TAE gels with various concentrations of chloroquine. In Vitro T7 RNA Polymerase Transcription—10 ng of DNA template was incubated with 20 units of T7 RNA polymerase (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) and 16 units of RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI) in 12 μl of buffer containing 33 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 5 mm MgCl2, 8.3 mm NaCl, 1.7 mm spermidine, 8.3 mm dithiothreitol, 0.17 mm of each ATP, CTP, UTP, 0.017 mm of GTP, 10 μCi of [α-32P]GTP for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 94 μl of buffer containing 1% SDS, 35 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 12.5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.27 mg/ml tRNA (Invitrogen), and 0.11 mg/ml proteinase K (Invitrogen) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Next, 11 μl of 3 m NaOAc (pH 5.27) and 300 μl of ethanol (pre-cooled at -20 °C) were added, and the mixture was incubated on dry ice for 20 min and centrifuged for 20 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant was carefully removed;75% ethanol (pre-cooled at -20 °C) was then added, and the mixture was centrifuged for 5 min under the same conditions. The supernatant was carefully removed, and the pellets were dried on a SpeedVac for 10 min and dissolved in 8 μl of the formamide loading solution (94% formamide, 2 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol). 2 μl of the obtained solution were then mixed with 2 μl of the formamide loading solution, heated at 85 °C for 3 min, quickly chilled on ice or a pre-cooled rack, and loaded on 5% sequencing gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 29:1) containing 8 m urea and run at 70 V/cm. As size markers, a 5′-end-labeled denatured DNA ladder consisting of DNA fragments of sizes increasing in steps of 100 bases or 10 bases was used. The gel was then dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. Quantitation of the Data—Intensities of the bands were quantitated by phosphorimaging using ImageQuant software. We measured the volume of the signal from the rectangle drawn closely around a band of interest. The local background was calculated by placing same size adjacent rectangles above and below the one surrounding the band and averaging the signals from these adjacent rectangles. This amount was subtracted from the signal obtained for the band of interest. In the case of WT-C and WT-Rev sequences, the arrest site bands were poorly distinguishable from background, and their positions often had to be extrapolated from neighboring samples. These values were normalized to the signal from the major transcription product (Fig. 3). Because the transcription was performed on a circular DNA template, the major product was expected to be heterogeneous. However, it formed a relatively narrow band instead of either smearing or trapping in wells. Thus, most of the transcripts from the circular plasmid were sufficiently long to be beyond the resolution capability of the gel, but not too long to prevent their entering the gel. Estimation from the ribozyme-containing plasmid (see supplemental Fig. 1) suggests that the average size of these products is roughly twice the size of the plasmid. A Sequence from the Nuclease-sensitive Element of the c-MYC Promoter Causes Partial Transcription Arrest—We found that during T7 RNA polymerase transcription through the sequence from the nuclease-sensitive element of the c-MYC promoter (Fig. 1A; this sequence is further referred as “wild-type” or WT sequence), truncated transcription products appeared indicating partial transcription arrests within and closely downstream of the sequence (the left panel in Fig. 3, lane WT). These products were barely detectable when the bases within the sequence were replaced by complementary bases (Fig. 3, lane WT-C) or when the sequence was cloned in the opposite orientation (lane WT-Rev). Thus, the inhibitory effect on transcription is sequence-dependent. The main purpose of our study was to determine whether this effect on transcription is because of formation of one or another of the noncanonical DNA structures within this sequence. To study this, we constructed sequences that differed in significant ways relevant to formation of particular secondary DNA structures and tested them for effects on transcription arrest. Design of Test Sequences—Under physiological pH and ionic conditions, this sequence could form two noncanonical DNA structures, the intramolecular purine-purine-pyrimidine (RRY) DNA triplex (H-DNA) and the DNA quadruplex containing a G-quartet (see Fig. 1). The ability to form both these structures is a general feature of sequences containing sufficiently long blocks of guanines, because both of these structures are stabilized by Hoogsteen base pairing between guanines. Additionally, the structure that is more energetically favorable in free DNA is not necessarily the one that is actually formed when DNA is partially bound to protein or to another nucleic acid, as in the case of transcription. Thus, a priori it is difficult to say which of these structure (if any) is responsible for the effect of interest (i.e. interference with transcription in our case). However, by making sequence substitutions that are known to selectively destabilize either the triplex or the quadruplex and by monitoring the effects of these substitutions on the interference with transcription, one might be able to discern the contribution of each of these structures to the interference observed. One of the base substitutions is based on the fact that in the triplex, adenines participate in Hoogsteen base pairing (Fig. 1B), whereas in the G-quartet-stabilized quadruplex only guanines participate in Hoogsteen base pairing, and other bases are presumably “looped out” from the structure (Fig. 1C). Consequently, the stability of the G-quadruplexes would depend mostly on the length of uninterrupted blocks of guanines within the sequence and is not expected to be sensitive to nucleotide substitutions between the blocks. Thus, substitution of both adenines by thymines in homopurine blocks within the WT sequence, producing sequence designated TT (this and all other sequences are shown in Fig. 2), should selectively destabilize the triplex but not affect the quadruplex. We also used the Tetrahymena telomeric sequence motif (G4T2)n (sequence Q), which is known to form a stable quadruplex (24Sundquist W.I. Kim A. Nature. 1989; 342: 825-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). The quadruplex formed by this sequence is expected to be significantly more stable than the potential quadruplexes formed by other sequences tested in this work, because it has 4-nucleotide-long uninterrupted G-blocks, whereas the others have only 3-nucleotide-long or less uninterrupted G-blocks (see Fig. 2). Thus this sequence should have the strongest effect on transcription if the quadruplex formation is responsible for this effect. In contrast, the triplex formed by this sequence (25Veselkov A.G. Kim V.A. Frank-Kamenetskll M.D. Dobrynin V.N. Nature. 1993; 364: 496Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) is expected to be less stable than that formed by the WT sequence because of the presence of thymines, which interrupt the triplex. The design of two other sequences, designated AG and AA, was based on the fact that the formation of an undisturbed intramolecular triplex within the homopurine-homopyrimidine sequence requires mirror symmetry of the sequence (see Fig. 1), and deviation from the mirror symmetry significantly destabilizes this structure (26Mirkin S.M. Kim V.I. Drushlyak K.N. Dobrynin V.N. Filippov S.A. Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Nature. 1987; 330: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The sequence AG contains one A-G permutation in the right half of the wild-type c-MYC sequence, which distorts the mirror symmetry of two homopurine-homopyrimidine blocks within the sequence, and the sequence AA contains an additional “compensating” A-G permutation in the left half of the sequence, which restores their mirror symmetry. If the interference with transcription is because of intramolecular triplex formation, then a single A-G permutation in the sequence AG should reduce the effect on transcription in comparison to that with the WT sequence, and the compensating second permutation in the sequence AA would restore the effect on transcription approximately to the same level as for the wild-type sequence. In contrast, the potential quadruplex in both of these sequences should be destabilized in comparison with that in the WT sequence because the A-G permutations disrupt one of four 3-nucleotide-long G-blocks within the sequence. In summary, the predicted ranking of the inhibitory effects on transcription for the various test sequences is Q > (WT, TT) > (AA, AG) if the effect on transcription is because of quadruplex formation, and (WT, AA) > (AG, TT, Q) if the effect on transcription is because of triplex formation. Intensities of Arrest Sites Downstream of the c-MYC Sequence Depend upon the Sequence Orientation and Correlate with Its Triplex-forming Potential—The typical results of experiments are shown in Fig. 3. We found two bands corresponding to partial arrest sites localized in close proximity to the downstream flank of the c-MYC sequence for which the intensity correlates with the sequence orientation and composition. The bands were clearly pronounced only when the R-rich transcript was formed (i.e. for all sequences except WT-Rev and WT-C). Judging from the DNA ladder marker, a stronger (top) band is localized about 10 bases downstream from the c-MYC sequence, and a weaker (bottom) band is localized within the c-MYC sequence close to its downstream flank. The data for the various sequences are summarized in Fig. 4. As described above, for sequences producing a R-rich transcript, an expected ranking of the triplex-forming potential is WT, AA > AG, TT, Q. An expected ranking of quadruplex-forming potential is Q > WT, TT > AA, AG. From Fig. 4 it is seen that the ranking of observed band intensities correlates with the triplex-forming potential, rather than the quadruplex-forming potential. All the experiments described above were performed with circular closed negatively supercoiled DNA as a template for transcription (see below). Consequently, the band at the top of the gel representing a major (“complete”) transcript might correspond to several rounds of RNA polymerase transcribing around the circular template. The intensity of this major band was used as a normalizing factor to obtain the relative values of the arrested band intensities, which reflect relative probabilities for transcription arrest (see “Experimental Procedures”). To estimate an absolute value for these probabilities, we applied a ribozyme-based approach similar to one used in Ref. 27Grabczyk E. Kim K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2815-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar (see supplemental Fig. 1). Using this method, we estimated that for the WT sequence the probability of arrest at the principal top arrest band position was ∼1%. Intensity of Arrest Sites Increases with Negative Supercoiling—The absence of an observable effect in linear DNA (data not shown) suggests that negative supercoiling is required for arrest in the vicinity of the sequence of interest, and thus the signal should increase with increased negative supercoiling, consistent with the structure formation induced by negative supercoiling. To test this hypothesis we prepared topoisomer distributions with increasing superhelical densities (Fig. 5A). From Fig. 5B it is seen that the intensities of the arrest bands of interest do indeed increase with increasing negative supercoiling. In most of our experiments, we used DNA of native superhelical density, which is usually distributed around -0.05 and should be similar for the same plasmid vectors propagated in the same bacterial strain under the same conditions. However, various plasmid samples might still differ slightly in topoisomer distribution (especially in the highly supercoiled “tails” of the distribution). In addition, they also might contain various amounts of some minor fractions like partially denatured DNA, which might be prone to fold into unusual structures and thus strongly contribute to the observed effects. To exclude any artifacts related to these possible differences in the plasmid samples, we gel-purified the topoisomers from natively supercoiled pWT, pWT-Rev, pAA, and pAG plasmids from the area shown by an arrow in the bottom panel of Fig. 5A. The purification produced a narrow distribution of topoisomers, which was virtually identical for pAA, pAG, and pWT-Rev, and very slightly shifted (less than one topoisomer) for pWT (Fig. 6A). The results for the purified topoisomers (Fig. 6, B and C) were similar to the results for the initial plasmid samples (Fig. 4), confirming that the effects observed really result from differences in the nucleotide sequences and not from possible differences in the plasmid samples.FIGURE 6Relative intensities of arrest bands for various sequences for gel-purified topoisomers are similar to relative intensities of natively supercoiled DNA. A, topoisomer analysis on a 1% agarose gel with 24 μg/ml chloroquine. SC designates supercoiled topoisomers, which are similar for all plasmids; OC is a small amount of open circular (nicked) DNA that most likely formed during gel purification. B and C, results of transcription experiment and quantitation for gel-purified samples from A (bottom band for WT-Rev were indistinguishable from the background). It is seen that the results are similar to the results obtained for native DNA (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Predominant Arrest Sites Are Localized Downstream of the c-MYC Element Sequence, and Their Positions Depend Upon the Flanking Sequences—As already mentioned, according to the DNA size ladder the band, which corresponds to the predominant arrest site, is localized about 10 bp downstream from the c-MYC sequence. The comparison with RNA markers produced by run-off transcription from the plasmid linearized by restriction enzymes confirmed this conclusion; accordingly, the most intense top arrest band is localized between 8 and 11 bases downstream from the c-MYC sequence (Fig. 7A). To check if the position of the arrest band depends upon the flanking sequence, we prepared analogs of the plasmids pWT and pWT-Rev, pWT-D223, and pWT-D223-Rev, in which 223 bp 2 bases immediately downstream from the c-MYC sequence were deleted, leaving a flanking sequence without an apparent similarity to the flanking sequ"
https://openalex.org/W1989581181,"Background The IL23R gene has been identified as a susceptibility gene for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the North American population. The aim of our study was to test this association in a large German IBD cohort and to elucidate potential interactions with other IBD genes as well as phenotypic consequences of IL23R variants. Methods Genomic DNA from 2670 Caucasian individuals including 833 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), 456 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 1381 healthy unrelated controls was analyzed for 10 IL23R SNPs. Genotyping included the NOD2 variants p.Arg702Trp, p.Gly908Arg, and p.Leu1007fsX1008 and polymorphisms in SLC22A4/OCTN1 (1672 C→T) and SLC22A5/OCTN2 (–207 G→C). Results All IL23R gene variants analyzed displayed highly significant associations with CD. The strongest association was found for the SNP rs1004819 [P = 1.92×10−11; OR 1.56; 95 % CI (1.37–1.78)]. 93.2% of the rs1004819 TT homozygous carriers as compared to 78% of CC wildtype carriers had ileal involvement [P = 0.004; OR 4.24; CI (1.46–12.34)]. The coding SNP rs11209026 (p.Arg381Gln) was protective for CD [P = 8.04×10−8; OR 0.43; CI (0.31–0.59)]. Similar, but weaker associations were found in UC. There was no evidence for epistasis between the IL23R gene and the CD susceptibility genes CARD15 and SLC22A4/5. Conclusion IL23R is an IBD susceptibility gene, but has no epistatic interaction with CARD15 and SLC22A4/5. rs1004819 is the major IL23R variant associated with CD in the German population, while the p.Arg381Gln IL23R variant is a protective marker for CD and UC."
https://openalex.org/W2006170285,"After observing that expression of two NR4A orphan nuclear receptors, NR4A3 and NR4A1, was altered by insulin in cDNA microarray analyses of human skeletal muscle, we studied whether these receptors could modulate insulin sensitivity. We found that both NR4A3 and NR4A1 were induced by insulin and by thiazolidinedione drugs (pioglitazone and troglitazone) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Furthermore, gene expression of NR4A3 and NR4A1 was reduced in skeletal muscles and adipose tissues from multiple rodent models of insulin resistance. To determine whether NR4A3 could modulate insulin sensitivity, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were stably transduced with NR4A3 or LacZ (control) lentiviral vectors. Compared with LacZ expressing cells, hyperexpression of NR4A3 increased the ability of insulin to augment glucose transport activity, and the mechanism involved increased recruitment of GLUT4 glucose transporters to the plasma membrane. NR4A3 hyperexpression also led to an increase in insulin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 as well as Akt phosphorylation. Suppression of NR4A3 using lentiviral short hairpin RNA constructs reduced the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose transport and phosphorylate Insulin receptor substrate-1 and Akt. Thus, NR4A3 and NR4A1 are attractive novel therapeutic targets for potential amelioration of insulin resistance, and treatment and prevention of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome.

Thus, NR4A3 and NR4A1 are attractive novel therapeutic targets for potential amelioration of insulin resistance, and treatment and prevention of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. Type 2 diabetes is a disease caused by defects in insulin secretion combined with the presence of insulin resistance in peripheral target tissues that results in dysregulation of glucose metabolism. Among non-diabetic individuals, there is a wide variation in the degree of insulin sensitivity, and relative insulin resistance is associated with a cluster of clinical and metabolic traits including central obesity, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, and elevated blood pressure. This trait cluster is referred to as the metabolic syndrome and confers increased risk of both type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (1Reaven G.M. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Reaven G.M. Diabetes Care. 1991; 14: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 3DeFronzo R.A. Kim E. Diabetes Care. 1991; 14: 173-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (4159) Google Scholar). The primary target tissues for insulin action are skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and liver. To better understand the molecular defects responsible for human insulin resistance, we have recently assessed differential gene expression in human skeletal muscle biopsies from insulin-sensitive and -resistant individuals using cDNA microarray technology (4Wu X. Kim J. Cui X. Maianu L. Rhees B. Rosinski J. So W.V. Willi S.M. Osier M.V. Hill H.S. Page G.P. Allison D.B. Martin M. Garvey W.T. Endocrine. 2007; 31: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These studies identified two differentially expressed genes that are members of the NR4A (NGFI-B) family of orphan nuclear receptors within the greater steroid/thyroid receptor superfamily, namely, NR4A3 and NR4A1. NR4A3 (also known as NOR-1, TEC, CHN, and MINOR) was originally identified as a protein induced in primary cultures of rat embryonic forebrain neurons undergoing apoptosis (5Ocurra T. Kim M. Yamanoto A. Miki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1959-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Based on homology within the DNA binding domain, there are two additional members of the NR4A (NGFI-B) family of orphan nuclear receptors, NR4A2 (also known as TINUR, NOT, and Nurr1) and NR4A1 (also known as Nur77, NGFI-B, and TR3). NR4A/NGFI-B receptor family members share greater that 97% homology in their DNA binding domains, which consist of two zinc fingers and a domain termed the A box. NR4A3, NR4A2, and NR4A1 also display 37-53% homology in the N-terminal transactivation domains and 53-77% homology in the C-terminal ligand binding domains. In the absence of any ligand, NR4A3, NR4A2, and NR4A1 can each bind and activate the NGFI-B-responsive DNA element characterized by the nucleotide sequence AAAGGTCA (6Wilson T.E. Kim T.J. Johnston M. Milbrandt J. Science. 1991; 252: 1296-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). In the presence of retinoic acid, however, NR4A1 and NR4A2, but not NR4A3, can heterodimerize with the retinoid X receptor and regulate a DNA element composed of direct repeats separated by five nucleotides (DR5) (7Mangelsdorf D.J.

Based on the observations from our human muscle microarray studies, we have now examined whether NR4A3 and NR4A1 are able to modulate insulin sensitivity in an insulin target cell. We have demonstrated that NR4A3 and NR4A1 orphan nuclear receptors are highly induced by insulin and thiazolidinedione insulin-sensitizing drugs in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and, conversely, are suppressed in fat tissues and skeletal muscles from rodent models of insulin resistance. Moreover, increased expression of NR4A3 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes augments insulin responsiveness of the glucose transport system and recruitment of GLUT4 glucose transporters to the plasma membrane together with increased insulin regulated phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and Akt. Thus, NR4A3 and perhaps NR4A1 represent novel therapeutic targets for ameliorating insulin resistance and in the treatment/prevention of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome.

Unless otherwise specified, all other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture and Stimulation—3T3-L1 fibroblasts were grown and differentiated into adipocytes in 100-mm culture dishes, as described by Frost and Lane (16Frost S. Kim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2646-2652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown to 100% confluence in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 25 mm glucose and 10% calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Two days after full confluence cells were differentiated via incubation in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) containing 25 mm glucose, 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 1 μm dexamethasone, 10 μg/ml insulin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 3 days and then for 2 days in DMEM containing 25 mm glucose, 10 μg/ml insulin, and 10% FBS. Thereafter, cells were maintained in and refed every 2 or 3 days with Dulbecco's minimal essential medium, 25 mm glucose, and 10% fetal bovine serum until used in the experiments 10-14 days after initiation of the differentiation protocol when between 80 and 90% of the cells exhibited the adipocyte phenotype. In differentiated adipocytes, various experiments involved stimulation with insulin (100 nm), thiazolidinediones (10 μm), or signaling pathway inhibitors for the indicated periods at 37 °C. Real Time QPCR Analysis—Five μg of total RNA was converted to first strand cDNAs in 20-μl reactions using random primers (Invitrogen). For each quantitative PCR experimental set, the target gene primers (see below) were utilized to amplify 10-fold serial diluted gene products (10-1012) to make a linear standard curve for each individual target gene. For an endogenous standard 18 S rRNA primers (5′-AAT TTG ACT CAA CAC GGG AAA CCT CAC-3′ and 5′-CAG ACA AAT CGC TCC ACC AAC TAA GAA C-3′) were simultaneously used for amplification from 1-μl first strand cDNAs in each 20-μl reaction tube; this allowed for normalization of cDNA loading and mRNA levels in each of the reactions. QPCRs were performed using a Mx3000P™ real-time PCR system and a Brilliant SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix buffer (Stratagene) containing 100 mm KCl, 40 mm Tris-HCl, 0.4 mm concentrations of each dNTP, 2.5 mm MgCl2, SYBR Green I, SureStart TaqDNA polymerase (50 units/ml) with hot start capability, and 20 nm fluorescein for experimental plate well factor collection on the Mx3000P™ real-time PCR system. A passive diluted reference dye (ROX) was also added to each tube (30 nm) to compensate for non-PCR-related variations in fluorescence. The concentrations of the gene primers for NR4A3 (5′-CAG CAG CTG CGA ACT CAA-3′ and 5′-GGA GGG AGG AGG AAT GGA-3′) and NR4A1 (5′-CCG AAC CGT GAC ACT TCC-3′ and 5′-CTT-GCA GCC CTC ACA GGT-3′); were 500 nm for each primer and 1 μl of first strand cDNAs for each real-time QPCR reaction performed in a volume of 20 μl. The thermal cycling program was 3 min at 95 °C for enzyme activation (allowing an automated hot start PCR), 45 cycles of denaturation for 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s of annealing at 60 °C, and a 30-s extension at 72 °C. Melting curve analysis was performed to confirm the real-time QPCR products. The amplified products were denatured and reannealed at different temperature points to detect their specific melting temperature. Recombinant Lentiviruses and Lentiviral-transduced Cell Lines—Fusion cDNAs containing the full-length NR4A3 coding sequence and a V5 epitope tag were cloned into a Vira-Power-CMV vector (Invitrogen). The recombinant lentiviral plasmids and a control LacZ gene construct were transfected into HEK293 cells. Western blot and X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside) staining were performed to confirm that the HEK293 cell transfection was successful, and infectious virus particles were produced. To establish stable 3T3-L1 cell lines that express NR4A3 or LacZ genes, recombinant NR4A3 or LacZ lentiviral stocks were used to infect 3T3-L1 cells with Polybrene (Specialty Media, Phillipsburg, NJ) at a final concentration of 6 μg/ml. Forty-eight hours post-transduction, these cells were placed under blasticidin selection (10 μg/ml) for 20 days. Western blot analyses were performed to test for stable NR4A3 or LacZ gene expression after antibiotic selection. For endogenous NR4A3 gene knock down experiments, three shRNA hairpin oligonucleotides (sense 5′-CAC CGC TGT TTG TCC TCA GAC TTT CCG AAG AAA GTC TGA GGA CAA ACA GC-3′, antisense 5′-AAA AGC TGT TTG TCC TCA GAC TTT CTT CGG AAA GTC TGA GGA CAA ACA GC-3′; sense 5′-CAC CGC TGA GCA TGT GCA ACA ATT CCG AAG AAT TGT TGC ACA TGC TCA GC-3′, antisense 5′-AAA AGC TGA GCA TGT GCA ACA ATT CTT CGG AAT TGT TGC ACA TGC TCA GC-3′; sense 5′-CAC CGC TCT TGT CCG AGC TTT AAC ACG AAT GTT AAA GCT CGG ACA AGA GC-3′, antisense 5′-AAA AGC TCT TGT CCG AGC TTT AAC ATT CGT GTT AAA GCT CGG ACA AGA GC-3′) that are complementary to the mouse NR4A3 gene coding sequences were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Coralville, IA) and annealed and then subcloned into the pENTR™/U6 lentiviral vectors (Invitrogen) to create the NR4A3 shRNA constructs following the manufacturer's instructions. Three specific target sequences in the gene coding region for the knockdown experiments were 5′-GCT GTT TGT CCT CAG ACT TTC-3′, 5′-GCT GAG CAT GTG CAA CAA TTC-3′, and 5′-GCT CTT GTC CGA GCT TTA ACA-3′ for the three synthesized short oligonucleotides. The recombinant shRNA-NR4A3 lentiviral plasmid or control scramble construct was transfected into HEK293 cells to generate lentiviruses. Inhibition experiments were performed by adding these shRNA lentiviruses to adipocytes 3 days before the measurement of cell insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity. Western Blot Analysis—Adipocytes were treated with cell lysis buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing freshly added protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Twenty-five μg of protein per lane and known molecular weight markers from Bio-Rad were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and incubated overnight at 4 °C with blocking solution (5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline). The blocked membranes were incubated with either the GLUT1, GLUT4, IRS-1, Akt, or phospho-IRS-1 and Akt antibodies and then the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody (1:1000 or 1:5000 dilution with 1% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS)) for 1 h for each at room temperature and washed 3 times each with TBS buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 15 min at room temperature with shaking. Immunodetection analyses were accomplished using the Enhance Chemiluminescence Kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Glucose Transport Activity Assays—Adipocytes were washed 3 times with transport buffer, pH 7.4, consisting of 20 mm HEPES, 120 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm NaH2PO4, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate and incubated in this buffer for an additional 30 min in the absence (basal) and presence of an insulin concentration (100 nm) at 37 °C. Glucose transport was assayed in monolayers as initial rates of 2-deoxyglucose uptake as described previously by our laboratory (17Mayor P. Kim L. Garvey W.T. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 274-285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these experiments the distribution space of radiolabeled l-glucose was used to correct for nonspecific carryover of radioactivity with the cells and uptake of hexose by simple diffusion. GLUT4 Translocation Assays—Plasma membrane sheets were prepared by the method of Fingar et al. (18Fingar D.C. Kim S. Blenis J. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3005-3008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, grown on glass coverslips, were differentiated into adipocytes at least 2 weeks before the experiment. Adipocytes were then incubated for 1.75 h at 37 °C in Leibovitz's L-15 medium (Invitrogen) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Coverslips were incubated in the absence and presence of a maximally effective insulin concentration during the last 30 min of this incubation. Cells were then washed once with ice-cold buffer A (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3) and once with ice-cold buffer B (100 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) and then left in buffer B for sonification. Cells underwent sonification for 1 s using a Sonics and Materials VCX-400 Sonifier with a 1-inch diameter probe (model CV26) placed 1 cm above the cover slips (amplitude, 80%; pulse, 0.1 s on, 0.9 s off). Adherent plasma membrane sheets were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.88 mm Ca2+ and 0.49 mm Mg2+, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and processed for indirect immunofluorescence using polyclonal anti-GLUT4 antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate- or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies as described (19Robinson L. Kim S. Harris D. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 20Nelson B.A. Kim K.A. Buse M.G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 981-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The amounts of glucose transporter GLUT4 in plasma membranes were quantified by digital image processing as described previously (20Nelson B.A. Kim K.A. Buse M.G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 981-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Images of the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-stained sheets were acquired, and the regions to be quantified were marked in the image captured with the FITC filter and counted with the Image-Pro Plus software. Animals—Adult Zucker diabetic fatty rats and their controls were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Fifteen-week-old ob/ob and db/db mice and their wild-type C57BL/6 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Animals were housed in colony cages and maintained on a cycle of 12-h light/12-h dark. The animal care and procedures were approved by the Animal Resources Program of the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The tissue samples of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, and their controls were kindly provided by Dr. Lidia Maianu. Statistics—Experimental results are shown as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed by unpaired Students t test assuming unequal variance unless otherwise indicated. Significance was defined as p < 0.05. To examine whether NR4A3 and NR4A1 gene expression are insulin-responsive in adipocytes, fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with 100 nm insulin for various times (0 to 8 h), and NR4A3 and NR4A1 mRNA species were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Fig. 1A demonstrates that insulin produced a rapid increase in NR4A3 gene expression that was sustained at 2-3-fold over basal for a 4-h period. Insulin also stimulated NR4A1 gene expression in adipocytes but with a different temporal response; NR4A1 expression levels increased 5-fold at 1 h and then returned to base line by 2 h after treatment (Fig. 1B). Expression of the NR4A2 (Nurr1) gene, a third member of the NR4A nuclear receptor family, was not stimulated by insulin in fully differentiated adipocytes (data not shown). The signal transduction pathways mediating insulin regulation of NR4A3 and NR4A1 expression were examined by treating cells with insulin for 1 h in the presence or absence of inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (LY294002), p38 MAPK (SB203580), or protein kinase C (Ro3 18220). Blocking any of these pathways by administration of these chemical inhibitors partially decreased the ability of insulin to stimulate NR4A3 or NR4A1 gene expression (Fig. 1, C and D) in fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Although these data should be interpreted cautiously since the inhibitors are not always specific, those data suggest that the pathways regulating NR4A expression are similar to those that mediate insulin major metabolic effects in both skeletal muscle and adipocytes. Next, two drugs in the thiazolidinedione class of insulin-sensitizing drugs, namely pioglitazone and troglitazone, were examined for their ability to induce NR4A3 and NR4A1 gene expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The thiazolidinediones are known to improve insulin resistance and are used as a treatment for diabetes in human patients and in animal models (21Saltiel A.R. Kim J.M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1661-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2, fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with 10 μm concentrations of the indicated thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone or troglitazone) from 0 to 48 h, whereas control cells received vehicle alone. Pioglitazone and troglitazone were both observed to stimulate NR4A3 and NR4A1 gene expression in adipocytes (Fig. 2, A-D). A pioglitazone effect on NR4A3 expression was not noted until 48 h, at which point mRNA levels were increased 7-fold, whereas a 3-fold increase in NR4A1 mRNA was observed at 24 h. Conversely, troglitazone led to a 3-fold increase in NR4A3 at 24 h and a gradual augmentation in NR4A1 mRNA that became significantly greater than that in controls at 48 h. To identify the biological or functional effects of increased NR4A3 gene expression, a recombinant NR4A3 lentiviral vector was generated and used to stably transduce 3T3-L1 adipocyte cell lines using antibiotic selection (data not shown). The tests for stable recombinant NR4A3 or LacZ gene expression were performed in transformed cells by Western blot analyses (data not shown). To determine the functional effects of NR4A3 or LacZ expression in these transduced cells, we assessed basal and insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity since transport is the rate-limiting step in the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake and metabolism. Insulin augments the transport of glucose into target cells by increasing the concentration of a specific glucose transporter isoform, GLUT4, at the cell surface (22Hunter S. Kim W.T. Am. J. Med. 1998; 105: 331-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, the ability of insulin to maximally stimulate glucose uptake in fully differentiated adipocytes was increased by 88% (p < 0.01) in the NR4A3-overexpressing cells when compared with LacZ-transformed control adipocytes. This was true for all five different stably transduced NR4A3-expressing cell lines that were established in these experiments (data not shown). In full-dose-response curves, glucose transport responses were markedly enhanced over the full range of insulin concentrations in NR4A3-transduced cells without changes in the insulin half-maximal effective dose (ED50) for glucose transport stimulation (data not shown). To further characterize the ability of NR4A3 to modulate glucose transport in adipocytes, we used recombinant shRNA-NR4A3 and control scramble lentiviruses to perform the NR4A3 inhibition experiments. The infection of shRNA-NR4A3 lentiviruses led to a mean 41% suppression of endogenous NR4A3 protein expression relative to control cells (data not shown) compared with controls. As shown in Fig. 3B, suppression of endogenous NR4A3 in adipocytes reduced maximally insulinstimulated glucose transport rates by 36% (p < 0.05) when compared with the scramble controls. To determine the mechanisms by which NR4A3 hyperexpression increases insulin responsiveness, we next assessed the ability of insulin to recruit GLUT4 glucose transport proteins to the cell surface using the plasma membrane “lawn” assay, as seen in Fig. 4. In these experiments, adipocytes were cultured on glass coverslips and stimulated for 30 min with or without (basal) 100 nm insulin. The adipocytes were then disrupted by sonication leaving and plasma membrane sheets attached to coverslips, and plasma membrane associated GLUT4 was detected by immunofluorescence. In control (LacZ gene-transduced) cells, insulin stimulation led to increased GLUT4 staining in the plasma membrane consistent with the known ability of insulin to recruit intracellular GLUT4 transporters to the cell surface. In cells overexpressing the NR4A3 gene, the ability of insulin stimulation to recruit GLUT4 glucose transporters to the plasma membrane was clearly augmented compared with control LacZ-expressing adipocytes (compare Fig. 4, A and B, to C and D). Image analysis software was used to quantify and define the immunofluorescent staining area in a blinded manner; these data indicated that mean immunoreactive GLUT4 staining in adherent plasma membranes was increased by 1.72-fold with acute insulin stimulation in NR4A3 hyperexpressing cells compared with that in LacZ controls. Therefore, NR4A3 gene expression increased insulin-stimulated glucose transport by enhancing the appearance of GLUT4 in the plasma membrane. These effects occurred without any significant change in the total cellular content of GLUT4 or GLUT 1 proteins, as shown in Fig. 5A, comparing GLUT levels in fully differentiated adipocytes transduced with either NR4A3 or LacZ. To explore whether NR4A3 might affect adipocyte differentiation, we measured GLUT4 content (data not shown) and lipid accumulation (Fig. 5A) in 3T3-L1 cells at day 8, when the cells were less than fully mature, and did not observe any significant differences in these adipocyte phenotypes in NR4A3 hyperexpressing and LacZ control cells. This suggests that NR4A3 may not regulate the rate of adipocyte differentiation as reflected by these parameters.FIGURE 5Effects of NR4A3 overexpression and suppression on GLUT4 and GLUT1 protein levels and insulin-stimulated IRS-1 and Akt phosphorylation in adipocytes. A, 3T3-L1 cells transduced with LacZ gene (control) or with NR4A3 (MINOR) gene were incubated for 12 days until fully differentiated.

IRS-1 and Akt phosphorylation was assessed in fully differentiated NR4A3- and LacZ-transduced adipocytes under basal and insulin-stimulated conditions (Fig. 5B). These experiments indicated that insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (tyrosine 941) and serine phosphorylation of Akt (serine 473) were enhanced in the NR4A3-transduced adipocytes. Analogous experiments testing for effects of NR4A3 suppression were performed using shRNA-NR4A3 and scramble control lentiviral constructs (Fig. 5C). A mean 42% reduction in NR4A3 protein in the shRNA-transduced cells was associated with significant decrements in the ability of insulin to promote phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Akt (Fig. 5C) when compared with the control cells. To determine whether NR4A3 and NR4A1 are dysregulated in states of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, gene expression was analyzed in muscle and adipose tissues from several rodent models. We studied streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, Zucker diabetic fatty rats, ob/ob mice, and db/db mice, all of which are well characterized rodent models of insulin resistance and/or diabetes (23Tofovic S.P. Kim E.K. Methods Mol. Med. 2003; 86: 29-46PubMed Google Scholar, 24Moore G.B. Kim H. Holder J.C. Lister C.A. Piercy V. Smith S.A. Clapham J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Skeletal muscles and adipose tissues from these diabetic and insulin-resistant rodents and respective insulin sensitive controls were obtained, and mRNA species encoding NR4A3 and NR4A1 were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. In all instances both NR4A3 and NR4A1 gene expression were decreased in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue from insulin-resistant animals. Fig. 6A showed that NR4A3 and NR4A1 gene expression was significantly decreased in the streptozotocin and Zucker diabetic fatty rat models, and Fig. 6, B and C, showed similar results from skeletal muscles and adipose tissues for the ob/ob and db/db mice models. Thus, NR4A3 and NR4A1 genes were consistently suppressed as a function of insulin resistance, diabetes, and/or obesity. The present results demonstrate for the first time that the NR4A3 and NR4A1 genes, both members of the NR4A family of orphan nuclear receptors, are up-regulated by insulin and thiazolidinediones and are suppressed in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue from rodent models of insulin resistance or diabetes. Moreover, NR4A3 is capable of enhancing insulin responsiveness of the glucose transport system and increasing GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane in adipocytes. Specifically, the current data show that 1) NR4A3 and NR4A1 genes were induced by insulin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and this response appeared to probably involve multiple insulin signaling pathways (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, p38 MAPK, and protein kinase C), 2) NR4A3 and NR4A1 mRNA levels were increased by two different thiazolidinedione insulin-sensitizing drugs in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (troglitazone and pioglitazone), 3) expression of NR4A3 and NR4A1 genes in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue was consistently decreased in multiple rodent models of insulin resistance, obesity, and type 2 diabetes (Zucker diabetic fatty rats, streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, ob/ob mice, db/db mice), 4) in lentiviral vector stably transduced adipocyte cell lines, NR4A3 expression markedly augmented insulin responsiveness for stimulation of glucose transport activity compared with LacZ transduced controls. On the other hand, inhibition of NR4A3 expression by small interfering RNA from lentiviral shRNA-NR4A3 constructs reduced insulin-stimulated glucose transport and led to insulin resistance; 5) increased NR4A3 expression led to increased mobilization of the GLUT4 glucose transporter proteins to the cell surface in response to insulin, and 6) NR4A3 hyperexpression increased insulin-mediated phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Akt phosphorylation, and these components of insulin signal transduction were inhibited by small interfering RNA-mediated suppression of NR4A3. The combined data implicated a role for these orphan nuclear receptors in the modulation of insulin action and in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Furthermore, agonists for NR4A3 receptor action would predictably increase insulin sensitivity and have application in the treatment and prevention of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Previous work has identified NR4A receptors as early response genes in T cells for apoptosis (25Winoto A. Kim D.R. Cell. 2002; 109: 57-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar); however, the biological function of these receptors in other cell types is poorly understood. Recently, NR4A nuclear receptors have been implicated in the development of cardiovascular disease in response to diverse inflammatory stimuli in macrophages (14Pei L. Kim A. Chen M. Hoffmann A. Tontonoz P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29256-29262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 15Martinez-Gonzalez J. Kim L. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 65: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, very few direct regulatory or target genes for these transcription factors have been identified. The homeotic protein, Six3, was shown in a yeast two-hybrid screen to be a putative partner of NR4A3 (26Ohkura N. Kim T. Murayama K. Tsukada T. Yamaguchi K. Dev. Neurosci. 2001; 23: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and Six3 has been shown to bind in vitro to the DNA binding domain and to interact with NR4A3 in vivo in human chondrocyte cell lines (27Laflamme C. Kim C. Bridge J.A. Ladanyi M. Goldring M.B. Labelle Y. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 449-454PubMed Google Scholar). When we examined the expression of Six3 gene in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we could only detect very low levels of this gene expression, and we did not observe that Six3 was stimulated by insulin in adipocytes (data not shown). Thus, other coactivators and target genes for NR4A3 are likely to exist in adipocytes relating to insulin signaling pathways and GLUT4 translocation. A mouse gene knock-out model revealed that NR4A3 is essential for the development of the semicircular canals of the inner ear (28Ponnio T. Kim Q. Pereira F.A. Wu D.K. Conneely O.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 935-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar); these results are consistent with the predominant expression of NR4A3 gene in the central nervous system (29Zetterström R.H. Kim L. Mitsiadis T. Olson L. Perlmann T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1656-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 30Maruyama K. Kim T. Bandoh S. Sasaki K. Ohkura N. Yamaguchi K. Mol.

However, it is not clear whether these NR4A3-deficient mice exhibit metabolic defects in other tissues, such as skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and macrophages. Interestingly, during the submission of this manuscript, Pei et al. (32Pei L. Kim H. Vaitheesvaran B. Wilpitz D.C. Kurland I.J. Tontonoz P. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 1048-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) reported that NR4A orphan nuclear receptors regulate glucose metabolism in hepatocytes, although these orphan nuclear receptors expressed either very low level or undetected in liver tissue. 3Y. Fu, L. Luo, N. Luo, X. Zhu, and W. T. Garvey, unpublished data. It seems likely, therefore, that the target genes and physiological functions of NR4A receptors are tissue-dependent and developmentally programmed (32Pei L. Kim H. Vaitheesvaran B. Wilpitz D.C. Kurland I.J. Tontonoz P. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 1048-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). IRS-1 is a substrate of the insulin receptor-tyrosine kinase and appears to have a central role in the insulin-stimulated signal transduction pathways, and this step is highly regulated in both physiological and pathological conditions. Tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 is required for downstream activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt, with subsequent GLUT4 translocation and stimulation of glucose transport activity, and the current data demonstrate that overexpression of NR4A3 in adipocytes can augment all of these actions of insulin. These results demonstrated that the NR4A3 orphan nuclear receptor can exert a powerful effect to enhance insulin sensitivity in adipocytes. Our present work also demonstrates that insulin resistance in rodent models is associated with reduced expression of NR4A3 and NR4A1 in both skeletal muscle and adipose tissues. Therefore, NR4A3 and possibly NR4A1 represent potential novel therapeutic targets for the treatment and prevention of diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and other diseases associated with insulin resistance. Such new therapeutic agents could include synthetic or endogenous ligands as agonists for NR4A3 and NR4A1 or other strategies that result in increased expression or action regarding these nuclear receptors. Because these receptors are induced by thiazolidinediones, it is possible that this effect contributes to the insulin-sensitizing action of these drugs. Thus, NR4A3 and NR4A1 could provide the basis for identifying down-stream molecular events that mediate desirable therapeutic effects. For example, a search for genes regulated by NR4A3 and NR4A1 or factors that interact with these nuclear receptors could identify new drug targets. Additional research is needed to examine the precise molecular mechanisms by which these nuclear receptors could modulate insulin sensitivity and the activity of the insulin-responsive glucose transport system.

https://openalex.org/W2011444132,"The assembly of neuronal networks during development requires tightly controlled cell-cell interactions. Multiple cell surface receptors that control axon guidance and synapse maturation have been identified. However, the signaling mechanisms downstream of these receptors have remained unclear. Receptor signals might be transmitted through dedicated signaling lines defined by specific effector proteins. Alternatively, a single cell surface receptor might couple to multiple effectors with overlapping functions. We identified the neuronal RacGAP alpha2-chimaerin as an effector for the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA4. alpha2-Chimaerin interacts with activated EphA4 and is required for ephrin-induced growth cone collapse in cortical neurons. alpha2-Chimaerin mutant mice exhibit a rabbit-like hopping gait with synchronous hindlimb movements that phenocopies mice lacking EphA4 kinase activity. Anatomical and functional analyses of corticospinal and spinal interneuron projections reveal that loss of alpha2-chimaerin results in impairment of EphA4 signaling in vivo. These findings identify alpha2-chimaerin as an indispensable effector for EphA4 in cortical and spinal motor circuits."

The eIF2α kinases are critical for mRNA translation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Activation of the tumor suppressor p53 results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to various types of stress. We previously showed that, unlike the majority of stress responses that stabilize and activate p53, induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress leads to p53 degradation through an Mdm2-dependent mechanism. Here, we demonstrate that the endoplasmic reticulum-resident eIF2α kinase PERK mediates the proteasomal degradation of p53 independently of translational control. This role is not specific for PERK, because the eIF2α kinase PKR also promotes p53 degradation in response to double-stranded RNA. We further establish that the eIF2α kinases induce glycogen synthase kinase 3 to promote the nuclear export and proteasomal degradation of p53.

The tumor suppressor p53 is a transcription factor mutated in ∼50% of human cancers (1Vousden K.H. Kim X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2728) Google Scholar). In normal cells, p53 plays a pivotal role in controlling cell cycle, apoptosis, and DNA repair in response to various forms of genotoxic stress (2Sengupta S. Kim C.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 3Gudkov A.V. Kim E.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The regulation of p53 is complex and occurs mainly at the post-translational level (4Harris S.L. Kim A.J. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2899-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar). This is mediated by various post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and acetylation, which contribute to its stabilization and activation (5Bode A.M. Kim Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). The stability of p53 is regulated by its interaction with Hdm2 (human Mdm2), an E3-ubiquitin ligase that acts as an antagonist limiting p53 tumor suppressor function (6Chene P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Both p53 and Hdm2 are in an autoregulatory feedback loop in which p53 induces Hdm2 expression at the transcriptional level. The Hdm2 protein then binds to and ubiquitinates p53 in the nucleus, a process that allows the nuclear export and the cytoplasmic proteasome-dependent degradation of the tumor suppressor (6Chene P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). In addition to Hdm2, other ubiquitin ligases, such as COP1 (7Dornan D. Kim I. Shimizu H. Arnott D. Frantz G.D. Dowd P. O'Rourke K. Koeppen H. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 429: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) and Pirh2 (8Leng R.P. Kim Y. Ma W. Wu H. Lemmers B. Chung S. Parant J.M. Lozano G. Hakem R. Benchimol S. Cell. 2003; 112: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), have been shown to disrupt p53 stability. However, compared with Hdm2, little is currently known about how these ligases act on p53 (9Corcoran C.A. Kim Y. Sheikh M.S. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2004; 3: 721-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The majority of stress responses that activate p53 require its nuclear accumulation and function (10O'Brate A. Kim P. Drug Resist. Updat. 2003; 6: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This is mediated mainly through inactivation of the Hdm2-dependent degradation pathway as well as through interactions with nuclear proteins that promote post-translational modifications of p53 leading to its stabilization and activation (10O'Brate A. Kim P. Drug Resist. Updat. 2003; 6: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The current interest in p53 is underscored by the tremendous therapeutic benefits of its reactivation in cancer cells. Small molecules or peptides that restore the function of mutant p53 proteins have a great anti-tumor potential by enhancing the apoptotic sensitivity of tumor cells (11Bykov V.J. Kim G. Wiman K.G. Eur. J. Cancer. 2003; 39: 1828-1834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 12Bykov V.J. Kim N. Zache N. Shilov A. Hultcrantz M. Bergman J. Selivanova G. Wiman K.G. J.

Selivanova G. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). Because p53 activity is influenced by many factors, targeting of proteins that regulate p53 function may also be necessary to ensure its ability to switch on its apoptotic programs (1Vousden K.H. Kim X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2728) Google Scholar, 6Chene P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Thus, more information is needed about the partners of p53 and their role in regulating signaling pathways that modulate p53 tumor suppressor function in both normal and tumor cells. Regulation of gene expression at the translational level plays a critical role in cell growth, proliferation, and tumor development (14Ruggero D. Kim P.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 15Holcik M. Kim N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 318-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). Translation can be controlled at each of the three steps: initiation, elongation, and termination (16Hershey J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). However, most regulation is exerted at the level of initiation, when the ribosome is recruited to an mRNA and positioned at the initiation codon (17Gebauer F. Kim M.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). A critical event in this process is the phosphorylation of the α subunit of translation initiation factor eIF2 5The abbreviations used are: eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; TG, thapsigargin; FRAT1, frequently rearranged in advanced T cell lymphomas 1; GSK-3, glycogen synthase kinase-3; GS, glycogen synthase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; RT, reverse transcriptase; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; GyrB, gyrase B; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; KD, protein kinase domain. at serine 51 (Ser51), a modification that blocks initiation (18Dever T.E.

This is because phosphorylated eIF2 acts as a dominant inhibitor of the guanine exchange factor eIF2B and prevents recycling of eIF2 between successive rounds of protein synthesis. Phosphorylation of eIF2α is mediated by kinases that respond to distinct forms of stress (18Dever T.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The eIF2α kinase family includes the heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI), whose activity is prevented by heme in vitro and in vivo, and which becomes activated when cells are deficient in iron or heme or exposed to oxidative stress (19Chen J.J. Blood. 2006; 109: 2693-2699Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The general control non-derepressible-2 is activated by uncharged tRNA as a result of amino acid starvation resulting in the induction of amino acid biosynthetic genes (20Kimball S.R. Kim L.S. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 561-579Google Scholar, 21Kimball S.R. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2001; 26: 155-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The activity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein kinase PERK/PEK is induced by the presence of unfolded proteins in the ER and results in a decrease of protein synthesis to prevent the accumulation of incorrectly folded or unfolded proteins (22Ron D. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 23Ron D. Kim H.P. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 547-560Google Scholar). Finally, the interferon-inducible protein kinase PKR, the prototype of the eIF2α kinases, is activated by double-stranded (ds) RNA produced during virus replication and results in the inhibition of viral and host protein synthesis (24Kaufman R.J. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 503-527Google Scholar, 25Clemens M.J. Kim A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 503-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Each of these enzymes exhibit a number of significant sequence similarities between them, particularly in the protein kinase domain (KD) (18Dever T.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). This may account for the common substrate specificity toward eIF2α and indicate the conserved properties of the kinases throughout evolution (18Dever T.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). In the past years, there has been much progress in identifying new conditions that induce the eIF2α phosphorylation pathway. For example, the cloning and characterization of PERK and mammalian general control non-derepressible-2 have revealed the important role of translational control in cells subjected to ER stress and nutrient deprivation (26Schroder M. Kim R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 739-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar). ER stress typically switches on cytoprotective measures that help cells adapt to this form of stress and induces apoptosis only when adaptation is not possible (27Ma Y. Kim L.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 966-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). One of these adaptive mechanisms requires the down-regulation of p53 (28Qu L. Kim A.E. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 567-570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, we demonstrated that ER stress inhibits the apoptotic function of p53 (29Qu L. Kim S. Baltzis D. Rivas-Estilla A.M. Pluquet O. Hatzoglou M. Koumenis C. Taya Y. Yoshimura A. Koromilas A.E. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 261-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). It does so by promoting the nuclear export and degradation of p53 through the activation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) (29Qu L. Kim S. Baltzis D. Rivas-Estilla A.M. Pluquet O. Hatzoglou M. Koumenis C. Taya Y. Yoshimura A. Koromilas A.E. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 261-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We further showed that ER stress enhances the Hdm2-dependent ubiquitination of p53, which requires GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation of p53 at Ser315 and Ser376 (30Pluquet O. Kim L. Baltzis D. Koromilas A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9392-9405Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The negative role of GSK-3β in regulation of p53 is supported by other studies showing the ability of nuclear GSK-3β to phosphorylate Hdm2 and promote p53 degradation (31Kulikov R. Kim K.A. Blattner C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7170-7180Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus, unlike DNA damage and other types of stress that stabilize p53, ER stress is the only type of stress described so far that leads to p53 destabilization. Cell Culture and Reagents—NIH 3T3 and derived cell lines, and HT1080 and derived cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% calf serum (Invitrogen) and antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin, 100 units/ml). Isogenic eIF2α S/S and eIF2α A/A MEFs were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus non-heat inactivated calf serum, essential and non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), and antibiotics. A549, U2OS, and HCT116 cells were maintained in F12K medium (Cellgro), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and McCoy's 5A medium (Cellgro), respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin, 100 units/ml). Tunicamycin (10 μg/ml, Sigma), thapsigargin (TG) (1 μm, Sigma), leptomycin B (3 ng/ml, Sigma), MG132 (10 μm, Biomol), and 1-azakenpaullone (1 μm, Calbiochem) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). LiCl (Sigma) was dissolved in water, dsRNA (poly(rI-rC), 10 μg/ml) was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline. The salubrinal derivative Sal003 (75 μm) and coumermycin (100 ng/ml, Sigma) were used as described (32Robert F. Kim L.D. Khan S.N. Acker M.G. Kolitz S. Kazemi S. Kaufman R.J. Merrick W.C.

Koromilas A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3415-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For transient transfections, Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) was used according to the manufacturer's specifications. Protein Extraction and Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and proteins were extracted in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 3 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Extracts were kept on ice for 15 min, centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min (4 °C), and supernatants were stored at -80 °C. Proteins were quantified by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). For immunoblotting, whole cell extracts (50 μg of protein) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and proteins were then electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore). Primary antibodies (1:1000 dilution, unless specified) used were as follows: rabbit polyclonal antibody to PERK (generous gift from D. Ron), rabbit polyclonal antibody to phosphoserine 51-eIF2α (1:5000 dilution, BioSource), rabbit polyclonal anti-eIF2α (sc-11386, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), mouse monoclonal antibody to PKR (B-10, sc-6282, Santa Cruz), mouse monoclonal antibody to actin (1:5000 dilution, Clone C4, ICN Biomedicals Inc.), mouse monoclonal antibody to human p53 (DO-1, Ab-6, Oncogene Science), a rabbit polyclonal antibody to mouse p53 (CM-5, Novocastra), rabbit polyclonal antibody to GSK-3β (number 9332, Cell Signaling), rabbit polyclonal antibody to phosphoserine 641/645 of glycogen synthase (Upstate), mouse monoclonal antibody to glycogen synthase (Cell Signaling), rabbit polyclonal antibody to PUMA (3041, ProSci Inc.), and rabbit polyclonal antibody to NOXA (2437, ProSci Inc.). Anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase or anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were used as secondary antibodies (1:1000 dilution). Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) according to the manufacturer's specification (Amersham Biosciences). Quantification of bands was performed by densitometry using the NIH Image 1.54 software. Immunofluorescence Studies—The detection of GFP-p53, GSK-3β, or p53 by immunofluorescence was performed as previously described (29Qu L. Kim S. Baltzis D. Rivas-Estilla A.M. Pluquet O. Hatzoglou M. Koumenis C. Taya Y. Yoshimura A. Koromilas A.E. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 261-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence, cells were stained with a 1:200 dilution for mouse monoclonal antibody to p53 (DO-1, Oncogene Science) or a 1:100 dilution for rabbit polyclonal antibody to GSK-3β (number 9332, Cell Signaling). The nucleus was visualized after staining with 0.05 μg/ml of 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma). Images were captured on a Zeiss microscope using equal exposure times. Nuclear/cytoplasmic ratios were determined by calculating total pixel intensity in a circle of 4 μm in diameter in the nucleus and the cytoplasm using AxioVision 4.5 software. The background was determined by calculating pixel intensity in a 4-μm diameter cell-free area. This area was then subtracted from the nuclear and cytoplasmic measurements for each cell within the microscopy field. Experiments were performed in triplicate. GSK-3β Kinase Assay—Protein extracts (100 μg) were mixed with 15 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 mm MgCl2) and 50 μm synthetic phospho-CREB substrate peptide (KRREILSRRP(pS)YR) with or without 1-azakenpaullone (1 μm). After 30 min of incubation at 30 °C, 10 μl of trichloroacetic acid was added and the reaction mixtures were centrifuged, and 20 μl of the supernatant was spotted onto Whatman P81 phosphocellulose paper. Filters were washed in three changes of 0.85% phosphoric acid, dried, and subjected to liquid scintillation counting. All kinase assays were performed in triplicate. siRNA Treatments—For siRNA transfection, 1.25 × 105 HT1080 cells were seeded onto 6-well plates. The following day, cells were transfected with 200 pmol of nonspecific (GL-2, Control) or human PERK siRNA (Dharmacon) using 4 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in medium devoid of serum. Six hours post-transfection, the plates were washed with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and replenished with medium containing 10% serum. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for an additional 72 h before being treated with thapsigargin or coumermycin. Polysome Profile Analysis and RNA Extraction—Polysome profiling protocol used was previously described (34Arava Y. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 224: 79-87PubMed Google Scholar). The gradients were prepared with the ISCO model 160 Gradient Former and were fractionated into 20 fractions of 500 μl using the ISCO density gradient fractionation system Foxy Jr. Fraction Collector while measuring the absorbance at 254 nm. The RNA was isolated from each fraction using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and the manufacturer's specifications. Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—The extracted RNA (from each fraction) was used for reverse transcription using SuperScript II RNase H Reverse Transcriptase (90 units/reaction, 18064-014, Invitrogen) and 100 μm oligo(dT) primer (dT20VN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Taq-Plus Precision Polymerase (2 units/reaction, 600212, Stratagene) was used for PCR according to the manufacturer's specifications. The PCR program was as follows: 94 °C, 1 min; 58 °C, 1 min; and 72 °C, 1 min × 28 cycles. The following primers were used: p53 forward, 5′-AACCTACCAGGGCAGCTACG-3′, p53 reverse, 5′-TTCCTCTGTGCGCCGGTCTC-3′; ATF4 forward, 5′-CTGGCTGTGGATGGGTTGGT-3′, ATF4 reverse, 5′-GAGGGGCTGTGCTGCGGAGA-3′; GAPDH forward, 5′-CATCATCTCTGCCCCCTCTGCT-3′, and GAPDH reverse, 5′-GACGCCTGCTTCACCACCTTCT-3′. Activation of eIF2α Kinases Results in p53 Degradation—ER stress induces the nuclear export and proteasomal degradation of p53 (29Qu L. Kim S. Baltzis D. Rivas-Estilla A.M. Pluquet O. Hatzoglou M. Koumenis C. Taya Y. Yoshimura A. Koromilas A.E. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 261-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 30Pluquet O. Kim L. Baltzis D. Koromilas A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9392-9405Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To better understand the signaling pathways induced by ER stress that converge on p53, we examined whether p53 degradation is mediated by PERK. To this end, we subjected primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) expressing wild type PERK (PERK+/+) or lacking PERK (PERK-/-) to ER stress after treatment with TG. We noticed that p53 protein levels were decreased by ∼70% in PERK+/+ MEFs after treatment with TG treatment as opposed to PERK-/- MEFs, in which p53 levels remained unaffected (Fig. 1A). We also found that down-regulation of p53 in HT1080 cells, which contain wild type p53 (29Qu L. Kim S. Baltzis D. Rivas-Estilla A.M. Pluquet O. Hatzoglou M. Koumenis C. Taya Y. Yoshimura A. Koromilas A.E. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 261-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), treated with TG was rescued when endogenous PERK was targeted by siRNA (Fig. 1B). Although siRNA did not completely eliminate endogenous PERK, its partial inactivation was sufficient to prevent p53 degradation in response to TG treatment (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4). These data revealed a negative effect of PERK on p53 in ER-stressed cells. We also investigated whether other eIF2α kinases exert similar effects on p53 as PERK. When HT1080 cells were transfected with dsRNA, which activates PKR, we noticed that p53 levels were reduced by ∼80% concomitantly with an induction of eIF2α phosphorylation (Fig. 1C, lane 3). Unlike dsRNA transfection, incubation of cells with dsRNA alone was insufficient to down-regulate p53 indicating that an intracellular pathway is required to decrease the levels of the tumor suppressor (Fig. 1C, lane 2). Down-regulation of p53 by transfected dsRNA was prevented by the presence of MG132 thus implicating the proteasome degradation machinery in this process (Fig. 1C, lane 6). It is of interest that MG132 decreased eIF2α phosphorylation in cells transfected with dsRNA indicating that p53 down-regulation may be proportional to eIF2α phosphorylation (Fig. 1C, compare lane 3 with lane 6). Given that dsRNA transfection activates several proteins in addition to PKR (35Saunders L.R. Kim G.N. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 961-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), we verified the role of the eIF2α kinase in NIH 3T3 cells, which contain wild type p53 and whose endogenous PKR levels were knocked-down by shRNA. We noticed that p53 protein levels were decreased by 80% in control shRNA-treated cells in response to dsRNA transfection (Fig. 1D, lane 2) as opposed to cells with inactivated PKR, in which p53 protein levels remained stable (Fig. 1D, lanes 3 with 4). Collectively, these findings supported a negative role of eIF2α kinases in p53 stabilization. Activation of eIF2α Kinases Results in p53 Degradation Independently of eIF2α Phosphorylation—To better understand the mechanisms of p53 down-regulation by eIF2α kinases, we utilized a conditionally active form of PKR expressed in HT1080 cells (33Kazemi S. Kim S. Li S. Su Q. Wang S. Yoshimura A. Matlashewski G. Dever T.E. Koromilas A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3415-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This form consists of the first 220 amino acids of the bacterial gyrase B (GyrB) protein fused to the kinase domain (KD) of the human PKR (GyrB-PKR) (36Ung T.L. Kim C. Lu J. Ozato K. Dever T.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3728-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with the antibiotic coumermycin causes the activation of GyrB-PKR by dimerization leading to the phosphorylation of eIF2α at Ser51 and inhibition of protein synthesis (33Kazemi S. Kim S. Li S. Su Q. Wang S. Yoshimura A. Matlashewski G. Dever T.E. Koromilas A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3415-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 36Ung T.L. Kim C. Lu J. Ozato K. Dever T.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3728-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Given that the high degree of homology between the KD of all eIF2α kinases (37Dever T.E. Kim L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), the GyrB-PKR system faithfully represents the consequences of activation of all eIF2α kinases. Treatment of GyrB-PKR-expressing HT1080 cells with coumermycin resulted in the down-regulation of p53 concomitantly with an induction of eIF2α phosphorylation (Fig. 2A, lane 2). On the other hand, expression of the catalytically inactive GyrB-PKR K296H in HT1080 cells did not affect p53 protein levels (Fig. 2A, lane 4). Treatment with MG132 prevented the down-regulation of p53 by the conditional activation of GyrB-PKR (Fig. 2B, compare lane 2 with lane 4) supporting a role of the proteasome pathway in this process. Taken together, these data demonstrated that the eIF2α kinase activity is both necessary and sufficient to mediate the proteasomal degradation of p53. Given the fundamental role of eIF2α kinases in translational control (37Dever T.E. Kim L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), we next investigated a possible link between p53 destabilization and protein synthesis inhibition. Treatment of HT1080 cells (Fig. 2C) or NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 2D) with Sal003, a derivative of salubrinal (38Boyce M. Kim K.F. Jousse C. Long K. Harding H.P. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Ma D. Coen D.M. Ron D. Yuan J. Science. 2005; 307: 935-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar) that blocks eIF2α dephosphorylation (32Robert F. Kim L.D. Khan S.N. Acker M.G. Kolitz S. Kazemi S. Kaufman R.J. Merrick W.C. Koromilas A.E. Lorsch J.R. Pelletier J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4632-4644Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), did not affect the overall levels of p53. These data suggested that induction of eIF2α phosphorylation alone is not capable of inducing the destabilization of p53. Translation of p53 mRNA Resists to eIF2α Phosphorylation—The above data favored a post-translational regulation of p53 by the eIF2α kinases. To verify this prediction, we measured the translatability of p53 mRNA by polysome profile analysis, a technique that allows the separation of monosomes from polyribosomes by sucrose density centrifugation (39Mangus D.A. Kim A. Methods. 1999; 17: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Efficiently translated mRNAs are bound to polyribosomes, whereas mRNAs that are poorly translated are associated with monosomes or disomes. We first examined the translatability of p53 mRNA in GyrB-PKR-expressing cells (Fig. 3A). Polysomal mRNA was isolated from total cellular mRNA by fractionation through 10-55% sucrose gradient. The distribution of ribosomes and mRNAs in the gradient fractions was determined by UV spectroscopy and the presence of specific mRNAs was identified by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. In each gradient, fractions 1-4 represent free mRNAs, whereas fractions 5-11 represent the ribosomal subunits (40S and 60S) and the single associated ribosome (80S or monosome). Fractions 12-20 represent mRNA associated with polyribosomes. We observed that activation of GyrB-PKR by coumermycin resulted in a significant reduction of polyribosome fractions concomitant with an increase in ribosomal subunit peaks indicative of inhibition of translation initiation. We utilized ATF4 mRNA as a control for its capacity to be better translated under conditions that induce eIF2α phosphorylation (40Harding H.P. Kim I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar). We observed that ATF4 transcripts shifted toward larger polyribosome fractions upon coumermycin treatment indicative of their efficient translation (Fig. 3A, right panel, compare fractions 9-14 of control to fractions 15-20 of treated samples). The GAPDH transcripts were also used as a control for general mRNA translation. Unlike the ATF4 mRNA, a large portion of GAPDH mRNAs shifted toward monosomes indicative of the general shut-off of translation. When p53 mRNA translation was assessed, we found that the p53 transcripts remained associated with the polyribosome fractions before and after the activation of GyrB-PKR with coumermycin. These data strongly suggested that p53 mRNAs are efficiently translated under conditions of translational inhibition caused by eIF2α kinase activation. We further verified the above observations by assessing p53 mRNA translation in HT1080 cells subjected to ER stress or treated with Sal003 (Fig. 3B). We noticed that both drugs exerted a significant inhibition of mRNA translation compared with untreated cells as indicated by the increase in ribosomal subunit peaks (compare fractions 5-11 to control) concomitant with a significant decrease of the largest class of polyribosomes (fractions 12-20). Under these conditions ATF4 mRNA translation was induced further demonstrating the dependence of this mRNA on eIF2α phosphorylation for efficient translation (Fig. 3B, compare fractions 9-14 of control to fractions 15-20 of treated samples). Contrary to ATF4, a significant fraction of GAPDH transcripts shifted toward"

Here we propose a novel, genetically determined cause of susceptibility to acute pyelonephritis, which is the most severe form of UTI. The IL-8 receptor, CXCR1, was identified as a candidate gene when mIL-8Rh mutant mice developed acute pyelonephritis (APN) with severe tissue damage.We have obtained CXCR1 sequences from two, highly selected APN prone patient groups, and detected three unique mutations and two known polymorphisms with a genotype frequency of 23% and 25% compared to 7% in controls (p<0.001 and p<0.0001, respectively). When reflux was excluded, 54% of the patients had CXCR1 sequence variants. The UTI prone children expressed less CXCR1 protein than the pediatric controls (p<0.0001) and two sequence variants were shown to impair transcription.The results identify a genetic innate immune deficiency, with a strong link to APN and renal scarring."

Kim M. Hertzel A.V. Banaszak L. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 277-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) are low molecular weight (15 kDa) abundant, ubiquitously expressed proteins that bind and sequester hydrophobic ligands such as free fatty acids and/or closely related compounds facilitating their solubilization and trafficking between various aqueous compartments of the cell. Whereas the members of the multigene family share only 20-70% sequence identity, they fold into a structurally conserved β-barrel that produces an internal water-filled cavity that functions as the fatty acid binding site (1Bernlohr D.A. Kim M. Hertzel A.V. Banaszak L. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 277-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Lipolysis in adipocytes (defined as the regulated release of fatty acids from the cell) is facilitated via a series of regulatory phosphorylation events linking receptor-mediated increases in cAMP to the phosphorylation of several key proteins including perilipin A and the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) resulting in an increase in triacylglycerol, diacylglycerol, and monoacylglycerol hydrolysis and efflux of fatty acid from the adipocyte (2Greenberg A. Kim W.-J. Muliro K. Patel S. Souza S. Roth R. Kraemer F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45456-45461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Perilipin A phosphorylation results in a dynamic restructuring of the lipid droplet surface, potentially providing access to the lipid droplets for lipases (3Tansey J. Kim A. Vogt R. Davis K. Jones J. Fraser K. Brasaemle D. Kimmel A. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 8402-8406Google Scholar, 4Moore S.-P. Kim R. Mottillo E. Bernlohr D.A. Granneman J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43109-43120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Recent structure-function studies have indicated that diacylglycerol is the predominant glyceride substrate for HSL in vivo and is provided by the action of the upstream adipose triglyceride lipase (5Haemmerle G. Kim R. Hayn M. Theuss C. Waeg G. Wagner E. Sattler W. Magin T. Wagner E. Zechner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4806-4815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). HSL function is under multidimensional regulation by hormones and catecholamines, and several investigators have shown that protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of Ser659 and Ser660 is required for both the translocation of HSL to the lipid droplet and increased hydrolytic activity (6Londos C. Kim D.L. Schultz C.J. Segrest J.P. Kimmel A.R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 7Su C. Kim C. Contreras J.A. Holm C. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol.

Trans. 1997; 25: 56-72Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition, AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of HSL (Ser565) also results in activation of the lipase and is necessary for translocation (7Su C. Kim C. Contreras J.A. Holm C. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43615-43619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 9Yin W. Kim J. Birnbaum M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 44: 43074-43080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Concomitant with HSL phosphorylation, the phosphorylation of perilipin facilitates the translocation of HSL from the cytosol to the lipid droplet and access to the substrate (10Sztalryd C. Kim G. Dorward H. Tansey J.T. Contreras J.A. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 161: 1093-1103Google Scholar). As such, lipolysis is a multicomponent highly regulated process linking a number of hydrolytic events leading toward fatty acid release from the adipocyte. AFABP/aP2-null mice exhibit decreased basal and hormone-stimulated lipolysis both in situ and in vivo, but demonstrate rates of fatty acid influx identical to those of wild-type mice, suggesting that the protein facilitates diffusion of fatty acids from the site of lipid hydrolysis (droplet surface) to the plasma membrane as part of lipid efflux from the cell (11Coe N.R. Kim M.A. Bernlohr D.A. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 967-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, AFABP/aP2-null mice accumulate intracellular FFA, suggesting that lipid release (lipolysis) from adipocytes is attenuated while intracellular lipid hydrolysis has not been formally addressed (11Coe N.R. Kim M.A. Bernlohr D.A. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 967-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An additional complexity to the system is that AFABP/aP2 forms a physical association with the hormone-sensitive lipase. Using a combination of yeast two-hybrid analysis, GST pull-down and immunoprecipitation analysis of full-length HSL and truncated derivatives, the AFABP/aP2 binding domain on HSL has been mapped to a region on the N terminus demarcated by amino acids 190-200 (12Shen, W.-J., Kim, Y., Hong, R., Patel, S., Natu, V., Sridhar, K., Jenkins, A., Bernlohr, D. A., Kraemer, F., (2001), 276, 49443-49448Google Scholar). This region on HSL is distinct from the catalytic region or the regulatory sites of phosphorylation that reside in the C-terminal domain leading to the consideration that the N-terminal domain is a regulatory docking domain (13Osterlund T. Kim B. Degerman E. Contreras J.A. Edgren G. Davis R.C. Schotz M.C. Holm C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In vitro analysis of AFABP/aP2 interaction with HSL using titration microcalorimetry indicates that the reaction is dependent upon fatty acids, although it was not clear from this study if the fatty acids were bound to AFABP/aP2 or to a fatty acid binding region on HSL that represents a site for product inhibition (14Jenkins-Kruchten A.E. E. Kim A. Ross J.R. Shen W.-J. Kraemer F.B. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47636-47643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In vitro, AFABP/aP2 stimulates HSL cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity, presumably by relieving product inhibition. However, such activation did not require physical association, because other FABPs such as those from liver and intestine that do not associate also activate the lipase (14Jenkins-Kruchten A.E. E. Kim A. Ross J.R. Shen W.-J. Kraemer F.B. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47636-47643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Because the in vitro studies of AFABP/aP2 interaction with HSL utilize purified proteins devoid of regulatory modifications (phosphorylation) known to affect HSL structure and function, we have turned our attention to a cellular system to assess regulatory properties of the association. A previous report defined an experimental cell system utilizing 293 HEK cells stably transfected with the fatty acid transport protein 1 and perilipin A termed C8PA (15Smith A. Kim M. Thompson B. Londos C. Kraemer F. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52399-52405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Such cells transport and metabolize serum fatty acids avidly, preferentially synthesize triacylglycerol, form well-defined lipid droplets and are responsive to lipolytic stimulation. C8PA cells have been transiently transfected with plasmids expressing fluorescent fusion proteins (YFP-AFABP/aP2 and CFP-HSL) thereby allowing for not only identification of subcellular distribution but also close physical interactions via fluorescence resonance energy transfer (15Smith A. Kim M. Thompson B. Londos C. Kraemer F. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52399-52405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Moreover, the cells can be labeled using BODIPY-conjugated fatty acids, thereby providing for a convenient mechanism to identify lipid droplets and association between droplet-associated proteins and the stored triacylglycerol. In this report we extend our previous observations to an analysis of the AFABP/aP2 protein by utilizing mutant forms of AFABP/aP2 and HSL and FRET as an experimental tool for evaluating protein-protein association in C8PA cells. Materials—Zeocin, Geneticin, Lipofectamine, and tissue culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad CA). BODIPY D 3835 (4,4-difluoro-5-(2-thienyl)-4-bora-3a, 4adiaza-s-indacene-3-dodecanoic acid; referred to as BODIPY-C12) was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR. pEYFP-C1 and pECFP-C1 were obtained from Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA. Gold Seal glass coverslips for imaging were purchased from Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro, NJ. Pure oleic acid was purchased from NuChek Prep (Elysian, MN). Cholesteryl [1-14C]oleate was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Restriction and DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from Promega. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. DNA sequencing and synthesis of oligonucleotides used for PCR were carried out by the University of Minnesota Microchemical Facility. Cell Culture—The cells used in this work (C8PA lipocytes) were HEK-293 fibroblasts stably expressing fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1) and perilipin A (15Smith A. Kim M. Thompson B. Londos C. Kraemer F. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52399-52405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The cells were grown and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum; stable expression of FATP1 was maintained with 400 μg/ml geneticin and stable expression of perilipin was maintained with 300 μg/ml Zeocin. Cloning and Mutagenesis—The R126Q AFABP/aP2 nonfatty acid binding mutant was subcloned into the A206K pEYFP-C1 expression vector. Mutations in the HSL phosphorylation sites were introduced into wild-type HSL in the A206K pECFP-C1 expression vector using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis technique of Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA as previously described (15Smith A. Kim M. Thompson B. Londos C. Kraemer F. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52399-52405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The mutational primer for HSL S565A was 5′-CTATGCGCAGGAGTGTGGCTGAGGCAGCCC-3′ while the mutational primer for HSL S659A/S660A was 5′-GTTTCCACCCACGGCGCGCAGCCCAAGGTGTCCTCCAC-3′. Wild-type HSL was subcloned inframe into pEYFP-C1 to spectrally enable FRET analysis between the HSL portion of the AFABP:HSL complex and the BODIPY-labeled triacylglycerol droplet. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Live Cell Imaging and FRET—For FRET analysis, C8PA cells were grown on polylysine-coated 13-mm coverslips placed into 12-well dishes. At ∼70% confluence, wells were transfected with expression plasmids specific for CFP-HSL and/or YFP-FABP. 24-h later, cells were lipid-loaded for 48 h with 300 μm oleic acid:100 μm BSA to maximize droplet formation. Lipolytic conditions were initiated by the addition of 20 μm forskolin and digital images for FRET captured after 4 h. For triacylglycerol labeling, BODOIPY-C12 in Me2SO is added to monolayers (final concentrations 10 μg/ml) 60 min following forskolin addition and maintained on the monolayers for an additional 30 min until the cells were washed and images collected. During microscopy, cells were kept in media at 37 °C until imaging at room temperature. Digital images were collected using a Roper CoolSnap HQ 12 bit monochrome camera and captured to a Pentium IV 2.6 GHz personal computer using Image Pro Plus AMS version 6.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Springs, MD 20910) for microscope automation and image analysis on a Nikon Eclipse E800 photomicroscope equipped with Ludl Mac 5000 controls of shutters and excitation and emission filter wheels. Images were captured with a 40×, 0.75 n.a. plan fluor or a 60×, 1.40 n.a. plan apo immersion objective. Cells with relatively equal levels of expression of both vectors were selected for imaging. For detection of CFP-HSL, cells were viewed with an excitation filter of 436/20 nm, a dichroic beam splitter of 455 nm, and an emission filter of 480/40 nm. YFP-AFABP/aP2 was detected by using an excitation filter of 500/25 nm, a dichroic beam splitter of 515 nm, and an emission filter of 535/30 nm. The filters for FRET were an excitation filter of 436/20 nm, a dichroic beam splitter of 455 nm, and an emission filter of 535/50 nm. Filters were obtained from the Chroma Technology (Brattleboro, VT). Images were acquired using 2 × 2 binning mode and 100-150-ms integration times on the camera. The exposure times were equal within each series of images and were chosen so that all pixel intensities were within the linear range of the camera. Images were first background-subtracted and registered to ensure accurate pixel alignment. Real Time FRET—Measurements were performed using the Spectral DV Micro-Imager system in Dual View mode from Optical Insight (Santa Fe, NM) that allows monitoring of donor and acceptor pair fluorescence emissions simultaneously. The ratio between YFP and CFP emission is then calculated as an indicator of FRET efficiency. The Spectral DV Micro-Imager is directly attached to the microscope and is equipped with a 505-nm long-pass dichroic filter used to separate the CFP signal from the YFP signal, a CFP emission filter (480 ± 30 nm) and an YFP emission filter (535 ± 40 nm). The excitation filter was 436 ± 20 nm. The fluorescence images of YFP and BODIPY were separated by a dichroic mirror (550 nm), and projected into the two detection arms with bandpass filters (535 ± 40 nm for YFP and 580 ± 40 nm for BODIPY (Chroma Technology, Brattleboro, VT). Images were captured with a fast high resolution digital camera (CoolSNAP-HQ 12bit Cooled Monochrome Digital Camera, Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ) and acquired in a PC using the ImagePro Plus AMS (Media Cybernetics). For all experiments only cells with nonsaturating levels of fluorescence are used. The images were then background-subtracted and shading-corrected using the “Correct Background” tool in ImagePro, which performs the shading correction as Corrected Image = (Max value of Shade Image) × (Acquired Image Background)/(Shade Image Background). The background image was a 10-frame average of the camera bias, taken with the identical situation as for imaging, but with the excitation light blocked. The shade image was collected from a 10-frame average of images of a calibration slide (Chroma Technology, Brattleboro, VT). Shading correction was necessary to obtain uniform values across the CCD chip. The CFP-HSL image was then thresholded, changing the intensities of all pixels outside of the cell to zero. Thresholding was based on the CFP-HSL image because it had the largest signal-to-noise ratio, providing the clearest distinction between the cell and background. The thresholded CFP-HSL image was used to generate a binary image with all values within the cell = 1 and all outside = 0. The FRET and YFP-AFABP/aP2 images were multiplied by the binary image, ensuring that the same pixels were analyzed in all three images as described in detail. Emission appearing in the FRET image because of emission from CFP-HSL or direct excitation of YFP-AFABP/aP2 was removed by subtracting a fraction of the CFP-HSL and YFP-FABP/aP2 images from the FRET image. This fraction depended on the filter set and exposure condition used and was determined as described (17Hoppe A. Kim K. Swanson J.A. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3652-3664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Corrected FRET (FRETC) was calculated on a pixel-by-pixel basis for the entire image using Equation 1, FRETC=FRET−(0.50×CFP−HSL)−(0.02×YFP−AFABP/aP2) where FRET, CFP-HSL, and YFP-AFABP/aP2 correspond to background-subtracted images of cells co-expressing CFP-HSL and YFP-AFABP/aP2 acquired through the FRET, CFP, and YFP channels, respectively. 0.50 and 0.02 are the fractions of bleed-through of CFP and YFP fluorescence, respectively, through the FRET filter channel. Controls were performed in which images were obtained in different orders. The order in which images were obtained had no effect. For presentation, a low-pass filter kernel was applied to the corrected FRET image to remove high-frequency noise (18Feige J.N. Sage Kim Wahli W. Desvergne B. Gelman L. J. Micr. Res. Tech. 2005; 68: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The data were analyzed for statistical significance by using a paired Student's t test. Images were contrast stretched, pseudocolored, and formated for display using Adobe Photoshop CS2 software (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA). Each live cell imaging and FRET experiment was done at least three independent times on different passages of cells. For each co-transfection and FRET analysis, monolayers were scanned to identify representative cells expressing comparable amounts of fusion proteins. Once identified, typically five separate cell fields were evaluated for localization of the proteins and FRET between them. As such, although a single image for each FRET experiment is shown, it represents a finding evaluated 15 times. HSL Activity Assay—The HSL mutant constructs were assayed for cholesteryl esterase activity as previously described (13Osterlund T. Kim B. Degerman E. Contreras J.A. Edgren G. Davis R.C. Schotz M.C. Holm C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Activity assays using p-nitrophenyl butyrate as a substrate were carried out analogously to that for cholesteryl hydrolase activity. Briefly, His-HSL and fatty acid free His-AFABP (purified as previously described (15Smith A. Kim M. Thompson B. Londos C. Kraemer F. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52399-52405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) were incubated in a 1:1 molar ratio in the presence or absence of 10 μm oleate and 2 μm pNPB for 60 min at 37 °C in triplicate. The reaction was stopped and the absorbance at 400 nm of the supernatant containing p-nitrophenol was measured. The experiment was carried out three times and each experiment individually analyzed using Microsoft Excel. HSL Affinity-purified Antibody—An HSL peptide corresponding to amino acids 594-611 (NSEPSDSPEMSQSMETLG) was used to produce a rabbit polyclonal antibody toward HSL (Bio-world, Dublin, OH). Coupling of the peptide to Affi-gel 15 (Bio-Rad), and subsequent affinity chromatography with antiserum were used for purification of the antibody. Previous studies using C8PA lipocytes (293 HEK cells stably transfected with FATP1 and perilipin A) have demonstrated that physical association of CFP-HSL and YFP-AFABP/aP2 occurs in the cytoplasm under basal conditions and is increased markedly in response to forskolin treatment (Fig. 1). In adipocytes, lipolytic stimulation leads to the translocation of HSL to the droplet surface and is dependent upon phosphorylation of perilipin A and HSL (3Tansey J. Kim A. Vogt R. Davis K. Jones J. Fraser K. Brasaemle D. Kimmel A. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 8402-8406Google Scholar, 4Moore S.-P. Kim R. Mottillo E. Bernlohr D.A. Granneman J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43109-43120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 7Su C. Kim C. Contreras J.A. Holm C. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43615-43619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The C8PA lipocyte system mirrors such regulation and 20 μm forskolin treatment leads to not only translocation of HSL, but also an increase in FFA release (15Smith A. Kim M. Thompson B. Londos C. Kraemer F. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52399-52405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, YFP-AFABP/aP2 association with CFP-HSL is increased in response to forskolin and is largely found associated with the lipid droplets (panels F and H). To assess the spatial relationship between the different aspects of the HSL-AFABP/aP2 complex to the triacylglycerol droplet, studies were carried out using fusion proteins of both AFABP/aP2 and HSL that allow for FRET analysis between the YFP fusions (but not CFP fusions) and BODIPY-C12-labeled triacylglycerol. By assessing direct fluorescence of each reporter, as well as by energy transfer analysis, the location and spatial proximity of the AFABP/aP2-HSL complex to the lipid can be evaluated. As shown in Fig. 2, once bound on the droplet surface, the YFP-AFABP/aP2-HSL complex exhibits a FRET response with BODIPY-C12-labeled triacylglycerol while AFABP/aP2 YFP-HSL does not (compare panels C and F), implying that the AFABP/aP2 fusion partner is in closer proximity to the lipid droplet than is the corresponding HSL fusion. The FRET signal between YFP-AFABP/aP2 and BODIPY-C12-labeled triacylglycerol required the presence of HSL and did not occur in the absence of forskolin stimulation (results not shown). Control transfection using pYFP-AFABP/aP2 and pCFP-HSL carried out on the same day and measured at the same time revealed that CFP-HSL translocated to the droplet surface and exhibited energy transfer with YFP-AFABP/aP2 identically as shown in Fig. 1. It should be noted that the fluorescent HSL fusion exhibits catalytic activity comparable to HSL alone (15Smith A. Kim M. Thompson B. Londos C. Kraemer F. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52399-52405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) indicating that the presence of the YFP does not block access to substrates such as triacylglycerol. Previous studies using titration microcalorimetry have demonstrated that in vitro, fatty acids are required to enable complex formation between AFABP/aP2 and HSL (14Jenkins-Kruchten A.E. E. Kim A. Ross J.R. Shen W.-J. Kraemer F.B. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47636-47643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). AFABP/aP2 is a fatty acid-binding protein with a well-characterized binding site defined, in part, by a hydrogen-bonding network between the fatty acid carboxylate and the side chains of Arg106, Arg126, and Tyr128 (19Sha R. Kim C. Xu Z. Banaszak L. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7885-7892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work in this laboratory demonstrated that an R126Q mutation in AFABP/aP2 resulted in a 30-50-fold reduction in the binding affinity for long chain fatty acids (19Sha R. Kim C. Xu Z. Banaszak L. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7885-7892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taking this into account, we evaluated the ability of R126Q AFABP/aP2 to form a complex with HSL. To that end, the R126Q mutant AFABP/aP2 cDNA was cloned as a YFP fusion and transiently cotransfected into the C8PA cells along with CFP-HSL. As shown in Fig. 3 CFP-HSL and YFP-AFABP/aP2 R126Q were located in the cytoplasm of the cell under basal conditions and the CFP-HSL translocated to the droplet surface in response to forskolin stimulation. However, in contrast to native AFABP/aP2 (Fig. 1), there was no energy transfer between AFABP/aP2 R126Q and HSL under either basal or stimulated conditions. Control transfection using pYFP-AFABP/aP2 and pCFP-HSL revealed that CFP-HSL translocated to the droplet surface and exhibited energy transfer with YFP-AFABP/aP2 identically as shown in Fig. 1. These results are consistent with the microcalorimetry data and indicate that if AFABP is unable to bind fatty acids it does not form a physical association with HSL under conditions of lipolytic stimulation. Previous studies have shown that apoAFABP/aP2 stimulates the catalytic activity of HSL ∼2-3-fold, presumably by relieving product inhibition and that activation did not require complex formation. These findings indicate that activation of HSL is unlinked mechanistically to complex formation and that the form of AFABP/aP2 that does interact with HSL is the holoprotein. The finding that the holoprotein form of AFABP/aP2 binds to HSL suggests that the interaction may be regulatory. If so, it would seem likely that holoAFABP/aP2 would interact with the catalytically competent form of HSL. Because maximal catalytic competence and acquisition of lipid binding is achieved following regulatory phosphorylation (7Su C. Kim C. Contreras J.A. Holm C. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol.

Work from a variety of laboratories has demonstrated that phosphorylation of HSL by PKA at Ser659 and Ser660 is required for full activation and for translocation of the protein to the droplet surface and that translocation does not occur when these two serine residues are mutated simultaneously to alanine (7Su C. Kim C. Contreras J.A. Holm C. Kimmel A."
https://openalex.org/W2093068062,"Cadherin-mediated interactions are integral to synapse formation and potentiation. Here we show that N-cadherin is required for memory formation and regulation of a subset of underlying biochemical processes. N-cadherin antagonistic peptide containing the His-Ala-Val motif (HAV-N) transiently disrupted hippocampal N-cadherin dimerization and impaired the formation of long-term contextual fear memory while sparing short-term memory, retrieval, and extinction. HAV-N impaired the learning-induced phosphorylation of a distinctive, cytoskeletally associated fraction of hippocampal Erk-1/2 and altered the distribution of IQGAP1, a scaffold protein linking cadherin-mediated cell adhesion to the cytoskeleton. This effect was accompanied by reduction of N-cadherin/IQGAP1/Erk-2 interactions. Similarly, in primary neuronal cultures, HAV-N prevented NMDA-induced dendritic Erk-1/2 phosphorylation and caused relocation of IQGAP1 from dendritic spines into the shafts. The data suggest that the newly identified role of hippocampal N-cadherin in memory consolidation may be mediated, at least in part, by cytoskeletal IQGAP1/Erk signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2046781193,"The mechanisms that govern the formation of α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregates are not well understood but are considered a central event in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). A critically important modulator of α-syn aggregation in vitro is dopamine and other catechols, which can prevent the formation of α-syn aggregates in cell-free and cellular model systems. Despite the profound importance of this interaction for the pathogenesis of PD, the processes by which catechols alter α-syn aggregation are unclear. Molecular and biochemical approaches were employed to evaluate the mechanism of catechol-α-syn interactions and the effect on inclusion formation. The data show that the intracellular inhibition of α-syn aggregation requires the oxidation of catechols and the specific noncovalent interaction of the oxidized catechols with residues 125YEMPS129 in the C-terminal region of the protein. Cell-free studies using novel near infrared fluorescence methodology for the detection of covalent protein-ortho-quinone adducts showed that although covalent modification of α-syn occurs, this does not affect α-syn fibril formation. In addition, oxidized catechols are unable to prevent both thermal and acid-induced protein aggregation as well as fibrils formed from a protein that lacks a YEMPS amino acid sequence, suggesting a specific effect for α-syn. These results suggest that inappropriate C-terminal cleavage of α-syn, which is known to occur in vivo in PD brain or a decline of intracellular catechol levels might affect disease progression, resulting in accelerated α-syn inclusion formation and dopaminergic neurodegeneration.

(NACP, synelfin), a small, neuron-specific protein, was first linked to PD by genetic analysis of families with autosomal dominant inheritance of the disease. Genetic analysis discovered a point mutation in the α-syn gene (SNCA), resulting in an amino acid conversion of Ala53 to Thr (1Polymeropoulos M.H. Kim C. Leroy E. Ide S.E. Dehejia A. Dutra A. Pike B. Root H. Rubenstein J. Boyer R. Stenroos E.S. Chandrasekharappa S. Athanassiadou A. Papapetropoulos T. Johnson W.G. Lazzarini A.M. Duvoisin R.C. Di Iorio G. Golbe L.I. Nussbaum R.L. Science. 1997; 276: 2045-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (6734) Google Scholar). Subsequently, α-syn protein was detected in Lewy bodies within the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (2Spillantini M.G. Kim M.L. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (6267) Google Scholar), the intracellular proteinaceous inclusions characteristic of PD and related disorders. Since this discovery, the process of α-syn aggregation has been proposed to underlie dopaminergic degeneration that occurs in PD. Therefore, delineating the mechanisms of α-syn aggregation and its pathophysiological role in neurodegeneration has been the focus of many investigations. Although the in vivo factors that regulate α-syn aggregation are not well understood, mechanisms involving genetic and environmental factors have been proposed. Genetic analysis has uncovered two additional missense mutations in SNCA (A30P and E46K) (3Kruger R. Kim W. Muller T. Woitalla D. Graeber M. Kosel S. Przuntek H. Epplen J.T. Schols L. Riess O. Nat.

Kim K. Lancet. 2004; 364: 1105-1107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Most PD cases are sporadic and involve aggregation of wild type α-syn, indicating that other factors may influence disease progression. For example, slow, chronic administration of the selective dopaminergic toxin, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine can induce the formation of α-syn aggregates in mice, putatively through mitochondrial damage and subsequent oxidative stress (10Fornai F. Kim O.M. Lenzi P. Gesi M. Ruffoli R. Ferrucci M. Lazzeri G. Busceti C.L. Pontarelli F. Battaglia G. Pellegrini A. Nicoletti F. Ruggieri S. Paparelli A. Sudhof T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Additionally, the pesticides rotenone and paraquat have been shown to induce or alter α-syn pathology in rodent models through complex I inhibition and oxidative injury (11Betarbet R. Kim T.B.

Consistent with these findings, oxidative and nitrative modifications to α-syn have been documented in human PD brain (13Giasson B.I. Kim J.E. Murray I.V. Chen Q. Souza J.M. Hurtig H.I.

Although α-syn has been clearly linked to PD pathogenesis, the mechanism by which a ubiquitously expressed neuronal protein causes accelerated cell death in circumscribed brain nuclei remains unknown. Catechols, such as dopamine, can be oxidized at physiological pH to generate reactive ortho-quinone (o-quinone) and aminochrome species. Electron-deficient o-quinones can directly modify protein structure and function through covalent attachment to cysteine or other nucleophilic residues (16LaVoie M.J. Kim T.G. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1484-1491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17LaVoie M.J. Kim B.L. Weihofen A. Schlossmacher M.G. Selkoe D.J. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 1214-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). In relation to PD pathophysiology, cell-free in vitro analysis has shown that oxidized catechols can inhibit the formation of α-syn aggregates by stabilizing soluble oligomeric intermediates (18Conway K.A. Kim J.C. Bieganski R.M. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Science. 2001; 294: 1346-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 19Li J. Kim M. Manning-Bog A.B. Di Monte D.A. Fink A.L.

However, several critical questions relating to the mechanisms of dopamine-induced alterations in α-syn aggregation remain unanswered. Therefore, we employed a previously characterized cellular model (21Mazzulli J.R. Kim A.J. Giasson B.I. Lynch D.R. Thomas S.A. Nakashima A. Nagatsu T. Ota A. Ischiropoulos H. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 10068-10078Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) to explore the biochemical mechanisms that govern the interaction of α-syn with catechols. We utilized SH-SY5Y cells expressing a five-amino acid-mutated α-syn in the C-terminal region: Y125F,E126A,M127A,P128F,S129A, designated α-syn 125m. This pentapeptide motif has been suggested to be an important putative catechol interaction domain responsible for inhibiting α-syn aggregation as determined by cell-free in vitro studies (19Li J. Kim M. Manning-Bog A.B. Di Monte D.A. Fink A.L. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 962-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Here, we have manipulated intracellular catechol levels in α-syn 125m-expressing cells to determine the effect of this motif on catechol-induced inhibition of cellular α-syn aggregation. Further, we utilized cell-free in vitro systems to gain insight into the chemical nature of the catechol-α-syn interaction. Generation of α-Syn-containing Plasmids—The bacterial expression vector prk172 encoding α-syn Y125F,E126A, M127A,P128F,S129A (α-syn 125m) was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described previously (20Norris E.H.

The prk172 Δ71-82 α-syn mutant was generated with the ExSite PCR site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as described previously (22Giasson B.I. Kim I.V. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2380-2386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). To generate both the Δ71-82 and 125m α-syn pCDNA3.0 constructs, the coding sequences were PCR-amplified from the prk172 vector to introduce a 5′ KpnI site followed by a Kozak consensus site. The following primers were used: 5′-Phos-GGG GTA CCC CAC CAT GGA TGT ATT CAT GAA AGG ACT TTC AAA GGC C-3′;5′-Phos-GCC GGA TCG GAA TTC AAG CTT GGA TGG AAC ATC TGT CAG CAG ATC TC-3′. The PCR-generated fragment was subcloned into pCDNA3.0 at the 5′-KpnI and 3′-EcoRV sites. A53T-125m α-syn was generated with the ExSite PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the following primers: 5′-Phos-ACA ACA GTG GCT GAG AAG ACC AAA G-3′;5′-Phos-CAC ACC ATG CAC CAC TCC CT-3′. The sequences of all constructs were confirmed by diagnostic restriction enzyme digest as well as by using T7 primer and a 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Generation of Stably Transfected α-Syn Cell Lines—SH-SY5Y cells (American Type Culture Collection) were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (complete medium). α-Syn-containing plasmids were transfected in 10-cm plates seeded at 6 × 104 cells/cm2 with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen) using 24 μg of plasmid per 10-cm plate. Stable transfected cell lines were selected by culturing in 300 μg/ml Geneticin (G418; Invitrogen) for 1 month. Monoclonal stable cell lines were selected, propagated in 300 μg/ml Geneticin, and initially screened for α-syn protein levels by Western blot analysis (see below). Cell lines were selected for experiments based on cellular morphology, responsiveness to differentiation by retinoic acid, and α-syn protein levels. Cell lines were differentiated into a neuron-like phenotype by the addition of 20 μm trans-retinoic acid (Sigma) into the complete medium, which was changed every 48 h. In some experiments (Fig. 4a), n-acetylcysteine (NAC; Sigma) was dissolved in sterile water at a stock concentration of 200 mm and diluted in complete medium containing trans-retinoic acid (RA) to a final concentration of 200 μm. Fresh NAC stocks were made for each addition and replenished in the medium every 24 h. Lentiviral Infection of α-Syn-expressing SH-SY5Y Cell Lines—Generation of lentiviral vectors expressing TH RR-EE and preparation of virus have been described previously (21Mazzulli J.R. Kim A.J. Giasson B.I. Lynch D.R. Thomas S.A. Nakashima A. Nagatsu T. Ota A. Ischiropoulos H. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 10068-10078Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). For each experiment, cells were seeded at 6 × 104 cells/cm2 in culture dishes, allowed to recover for 2 days, infected with lentivirus containing empty vector or TH expression plasmids, and differentiated with 20 μm RA for 8 days. α-Syn Extraction and Western Blot Analysis—These procedures have been described in detail previously (21Mazzulli J.R. Kim A.J. Giasson B.I. Lynch D.R. Thomas S.A. Nakashima A. Nagatsu T. Ota A. Ischiropoulos H. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 10068-10078Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, after viral transduction and RA differentiation, cells were washed in cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS) and harvested in lysis buffer (1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μm lactacystin, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), pH 7.4). Homogenates were loaded directly onto 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels in 1× sample buffer (20 mm Tris, 1% (v/v) glycerol, 180 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.003% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 2% w/v SDS, pH 6.8) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Blots were blocked in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20 containing 5% (w/v) milk for 1 h followed by incubation with the following primary antibodies for 2 h at 25 °C: monoclonal Syn 204 (1:1000), monoclonal TH (1:5000; EMD Biosciences, La Jolla, CA), polyclonal NSE (1:2000; Polysciences, Warrington, PA). Primary antibodies were detected by a 1-h incubation with either goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 680 (1:5000; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) or goat anti-rabbit IgG IRDye 800 (1:5000; Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA) conjugated secondary antibodies in blocking buffer and scanned at intensity level 2 with an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE). Size Exclusion Chromatography—α-Syn was extracted as described above, and 0.5-1 mg of total Triton-soluble lysate was resolved on a Superdex 200 HR10/30 column (GE Healthcare) using 25 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Fractions were collected (0.5 ml), concentrated with 5-kDa cut-off filters (Millipore), and loaded onto 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for Western blot analysis as described above and previously (21Mazzulli J.R. Kim A.J. Giasson B.I. Lynch D.R. Thomas S.A. Nakashima A. Nagatsu T. Ota A. Ischiropoulos H. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 10068-10078Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Quantification of Intracellular Catechols by High Pressure Liquid Chromatography-electrochemical detection (ECD)—After viral transduction and RA differentiation, cells (5 × 105 cells/well) were washed in D-PBS and harvested in 100 μl of 0.1 m perchloric acid containing 100 nm dihyroxybenzylamine and lysed by sonication. Lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and 50 μl of supernatant was injected on the high pressure liquid chromatograph for analysis as described previously (21Mazzulli J.R. Kim A.J. Giasson B.I. Lynch D.R. Thomas S.A. Nakashima A. Nagatsu T. Ota A. Ischiropoulos H. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 10068-10078Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Analysis—Cells were cultured at 6 × 104 in 12-well cluster dishes (Corning Glass). Cells were washed three times in ice-cold D-PBS and fixed in methanol followed by a 1:1 mix of methanol/acetone as described (20Norris E.H. Kim B.I. Hodara R. Xu S. Trojanowski J.Q. Ischiropoulos H. Lee V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21212-21219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The following primary antibodies for α-syn were used: affinity-purified polyclonal SNL-1 (1:1000), polyclonal SNL-4 (1:500), and monoclonal Syn 514 (1:400). Monoclonal or polyclonal anti-tyrosine hydroxylase was also used (1:1000; EMD Biosciences, La Jolla, CA). Primary antibodies were incubated in blocking buffer (50 mm phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, 0.3% (v/v) Triton (PBS-T), with 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 10% (v/v) normal goat serum) at 4 °C overnight. The cells were washed three times in PBS-T followed by incubation of secondary antibodies for 1 h at 25 °C in blocking buffer (Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (1:100; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA); Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (1:300, Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Nuclei were visualized with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride staining at 200 ng/ml for 15 min. In some experiments, thioflavin S staining was done after secondary incubation using a 0.05% (w/v) solution dissolved in ethanol (21Mazzulli J.R. Kim A.J. Giasson B.I. Lynch D.R. Thomas S.A. Nakashima A. Nagatsu T. Ota A. Ischiropoulos H. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 10068-10078Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Cells were imaged with an inverted Olympus IX70 microscope equipped with an IX-FLA fluorescence observation attachment (Olympus Optical Co., Tokyo, Japan). For quantification of cells containing aggregates, 10 fields of view were randomly selected per well, with at least 100 total cells counted per replicate. For SNL-1, total aggregates were scored (both large and small cytoplasmic punctated structures), whereas for SNL-4 and Syn 514, only juxtanuclear inclusions were counted. For thioflavin S, only inclusions that were juxtanuclear and co-localized with α-syn immunostaining were counted. Purification of Recombinant WT and Mutant α-Syn—BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL-competent cells (Stratagene) were transformed with expression plasmid prk172 WT or mutant α-syn and cultured to an optical density of 0.6-0.8 at 37 °C with shaking. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h. Bacterial cell pellets were homogenized with a pestle in high salt buffer (0.75 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors and 0.2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, heated to 100 °C for 10 min, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatant was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris containing 1 mm EDTA and 0.2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5, and applied to a Superdex 200 HR10/30 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) in a mobile phase of 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Fractions containing α-syn were collected, concentrated, and applied to a Resource Q column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with a 0-0.5 m NaCl gradient. Collected fractions containing α-syn were purified once more by gel filtration in D-PBS. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. In Vitro Analysis of α-Syn Aggregation—α-Syn was incubated in conditions previously described for promoting fibril formation (6Giasson B.I. Kim K. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7619-7622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) at 346 μm (5 mg/ml) in D-PBS for 48 h with constant shaking at 1000 rpm, 37 °C with a mineral oil overlay. For sedimentation analysis, the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, 1× sample buffer (20 mm Tris, 1% (v/v) glycerol, 180 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.003% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 2% (w/v) SDS, pH 6.8) was added to both supernatant and pellets, and samples were boiled for 5 min. Samples were loaded onto 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and protein was visualized by colloidal blue stain. In some experiments, NAC was dissolved in D-PBS at a stock concentration of 50 mm and then added to the reaction at a final concentration of 5 mm. For thioflavin T analysis, 5 μl of sample (25 μg) was removed after the incubation period and diluted into 10 μm thioflavin T made in 100 mm glycine, pH 8.5, in a final volume of 100 μl and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Samples were loaded into black Maxisorp microplates (Nunc, Rochester, NY), and fluorescence at 490 nm was measured (excitation, 450 nm; bandwidth, 9 nm; emission, 490 nm; cut-off, 475 nm). For incubations of α-syn with catechols, l-DOPA, DA, and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) (Sigma) were dissolved at a stock concentration of 10 mm in D-PBS and then immediately diluted in the reaction mixture to a final concentration of 0.5 m (1:1.5 protein/catechol ratio). Detection of Catechol-modified Proteins Using Near Infrared Fluorescence (nIRF) and Redox-cycling Staining—This method utilizes the specific fluorescent properties of quinone-containing compounds and therefore is unable to detect unoxidized catechols or polymerization products of oxidized catechols, such as melanin. α-Syn was incubated with catechols in D-PBS (1:1.5 molar ratio) at 37 °C for 48 h. Samples were boiled in 1× sample buffer (20 mm Tris, 1% glycerol, 180 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.003% bromphenol blue, and 2% SDS, pH 6.8) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (30-50 μg of protein/lane). Gels were immediately scanned with an Odyssey infrared imager after the run (700-nm channel, intensity = 10) (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE), and then the same gel was stained with colloidal blue to visualize total protein. Densitometric analysis by integrating protein band intensities with Odyssey infrared imaging system software, version 1.2, was utilized to quantify the amount of catechol-modified α-syn. Redox-cycling staining was performed as described (23Paz M.A. Kim R. Boak A. Kagan H.M. Gallop P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 689-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after SDS-PAGE analysis, gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and stained in a 2 m potassium glycine solution, pH 10, containing 0.24 mm nitro blue tetrazolium for 40 min and scanned with a Canon Canon-scan 8400F color scanner using Adobe Photoshop software, version 6.0. Mass Spectrometry of Catechol-modified α-Syn—Recombinant α-syn was incubated with constant shaking in D-PBS, 37 °C for 48 h as described above. Following incubation, the sample was centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min, and 2 μg of total soluble protein was injected into the mass spectrometer. Mass spectrometry was performed on an Agilent 1100 series quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ion source in a mobile phase of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. The spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode. In Vitro Aggregation of Fibrinogen, Alcohol Dehydrogenase, and γ-Crystallin—Aggregation for all three proteins was determined by light scattering at 360 nm and followed as a function of time in seconds, using a SpectraMax 250 microplate spectrophotometer system (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale CA). Aggregation was assessed in the presence of a 1:2 ratio (protein/catechol) of freshly made 10 mm dopamine or DOPAC (Sigma) in D-PBS or autoxidized dopamine or DOPAC (incubated at 25 °C for 1 month in D-PBS). Human fibrinogen (1 mg/ml; American Diagnostica, Inc., Greenwich, CT) aggregation was initiated by the addition of 0.1 units/ml human thrombin (American Diagnostica) in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris base, 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.4, at 25 °C as previously described (24Vadseth C.

Horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (1 mg/ml; Sigma) thermal-induced aggregation was performed as described previously (25Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar) in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 45 °C. Bovine γ-crystallin (0.1 mg/ml; Sigma) was subjected to acid denaturation in 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 3.0, at 20 °C. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed using Sigmastat software version 2.03 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and are expressed as the mean ± S.E. One-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post hoc test was utilized to determine if groups were statistically different, with p values of <0.05 considered significant. To determine the cellular mechanism of catechol-α-syn interactions and the effect on inclusion formation, stably transfected α-syn 125m SH-SY5Y cell lines were generated. Because expression of α-syn 125m did not result in a substantial amount of cells containing inclusions (Fig. S1, a and b), the A53T mutation was introduced into the 125m construct to generate α-syn A53T-125m. Several cell lines were generated and analyzed for A53T-125m expression levels by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1, a and b). Based on this analysis, line 34 was selected for subsequent experiments. Immunofluorescence analysis of RA-differentiated A53T-125m cells revealed the presence of cytoplasmic, punctated aggregates as well as larger, juxtanuclear inclusions that co-localized with thioflavin S, indicating the presence of amyloid inclusions (Fig. 1, c and d). The number of A53T-125m cells containing punctated and juxtanuclear inclusions that co-localized with thioflavin S was comparable with cells expressing A53T α-syn. As a control, cells expressing Δ71-82 α-syn, a mutant α-syn protein that is incapable of polymerizing in vitro (22Giasson B.I. Kim I.V. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 3338-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), were used. Immunofluorescence analysis showed a diffuse, cytoplasmic staining pattern with only a small percentage of cells (<1%) that contained small punctated α-syn aggregates (Fig. 1, c and d). The transfected SH-SY5Y cell lines used for these experiments do not contain detectable amounts of catechols or the rate-limiting synthesizing enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (vector condition; Fig. 2, a and b). Therefore, to determine the effect of increasing catechol levels on α-syn aggregation in A53T-125m cells, TH was expressed by transduction with a lentiviral vector encoding for human TH-1. To achieve elevated levels of cytosolic catechols, a mutant form of TH was utilized, TH RR-EE, which contains an altered catecholamine feedback inhibition site (residues 37 and 38 converted from Arg to Glu), allowing the enzyme to produce higher catechol levels compared with wild type TH (21Mazzulli J.R. Kim A.J. Giasson B.I. Lynch D.R. Thomas S.A. Nakashima A. Nagatsu T. Ota A. Ischiropoulos H. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 10068-10078Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 27Nakashima A. Kim Y.S.

After RA differentiation, the TH RR-EE-transduced A53T-125m cells contained higher levels of catechols compared with empty vector-transduced cells (Fig. 2b). As shown previously, commensurate to increasing catechol levels, the number of cells containing α-syn aggregates in A53T expressing cells declined (Fig. 3, a and b).

The calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor requires the assembly of the seven-transmembrane domain calcitonin receptor-like receptor with the single-transmembrane domain receptor activity-modifying protein-1 to reach the cell surface and be active. However, the relative stoichiometric arrangement of these two proteins within a receptor complex remains unknown.

Increasing evidence indicates that “signalosomes,” regrouping different components of a signaling pathway into multiprotein complexes with well defined stoichiometries, play crucial roles in defining the specificity and efficacy of signal transduction (1Hoeller D.

For instance, the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) 3The abbreviations used are: CGRP, calcitonin gene-related peptide; 7TM, seven-transmembrane domain; BiFC, bimolecular fluorescence complementation; BRET, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer; COS7, simian kidney fibroblasts; CRLR, calcitonin receptor-like receptor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Fz1, Frizzled 1; Fz4m, Frizzled 4 mutant; HEK, human embryonic kidney; RAMP1, receptor activity-modifying protein-1; RET, resonance energy transfer; Rluc, Renilla luciferase; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; YC, C-terminal fragment of YFP; YN, N-terminal fragment of YFP; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin. receptor results from the association of the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR), a seven-transmembrane domain (7TM) receptor belonging to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors, with a one-transmembrane domain protein, the receptor activity-modifying protein-1 (RAMP1), which is part of a three member family (RAMP1, -2, and -3). When expressed individually, both CRLR and RAMP1 are retained intracellularly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereas their association permits their common plasma membrane targeting and determines the pharmacological properties of the receptor (3McLatchie L.M.

From these data, it was proposed that the formation of a functional CGRP receptor requires a 1:1 stoichiometric association of CRLR and RAMP1. Consistent with this idea, cross-linking experiments, using bivalent reagents, captured complexes consisting of one CRLR and one RAMP1 molecule (6Hilairet S. Kim C. Bertrand J. Laperriere A.

However, the observation that both CRLR and RAMP1 can form homo-oligomers (often refer to as dimers) when expressed alone (3McLatchie L.M. Kim N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R.

Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 7022-7033Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) adds a new level of complexity that reactualizes the question of the number of CRLR and RAMP1 molecules forming the receptor complex in living cells. The present study was therefore undertaken to probe the composition and relative stoichiometric arrangement of the CGRP receptor. Despite the emergence of several cell-based techniques to detect protein-protein interactions (9Michnick S.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 472-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 10Wallrabe H. Kim A. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2005; 16: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 11Pfleger K.D. Kim K.A. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), the lack of assays monitoring interactions between more than two proteins simultaneously makes stoichiometric analysis of protein complexes in living cells a challenging endeavor. Among the techniques used to study protein-protein interactions in living cells, resonance energy transfer (RET) and protein fragment complementation assays are gaining in popularity. RET approaches rely on the nonradiative transfer of energy between luminescent and/or fluorescent donor and acceptor molecules that are attached to potential protein partners (12Truong K. Kim M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). For protein complementation assay, the reconstitution of a reporter protein (typically an enzyme) from its two fragments attached to the potential protein partners under study is taken as evidence for interactions between the partners (9Michnick S.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 472-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The development of a protein complementation assay known as bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), based on the reconstitution of a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) upon reassociation of its two fragments (13Hu C.D. Kim Y. Kerppola T.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar), opens the possibility of combining this technology with resonance energy transfer approaches to probe interactions between at least three partners at the same time in living cells (14Rebois R.V. Kim M. Gales C. Dupre D.J. Baragli A. Trieu P. Ethier N. Bouvier M. Hebert T.E. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 2807-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 15Dupre D.J. Kim M. Ethier N.

Taking advantage of this possibility, we combined BiFC with a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assay (BRET) that uses Renilla luciferase (Rluc) and YFP as the energy donor and acceptor, respectively. Using this dual BRET/BiFC approach in combination with BRET competition, co-immunoprecipitation, and subcellular distribution microscopy studies, we found that at least two molecules of CRLR associate with a single molecule of RAMP1 to generate an asymmetrical oligomeric complex that can reach the cell surface as a functional entity. In addition to shedding new light on the CGRP receptor structure, the present study demonstrates that it is possible to combine BiFC and BRET in a single assay to probe the composition of signaling complexes.

Malenka (Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA), and YFP BiFC fragments were provided by T. K. Kerppola (University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI). GABABR1-Rluc and β-arrestin2-Rluc were previously described (16Perroy J. Kim L. Qanbar R. Chenier S. Bouvier M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3816-3824Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Myc-CRLR-Rluc, Myc-RAMP1-Rluc, and HA-RAMP1-Rluc (hereafter called CRLR-Rluc, RAMP1-Rluc, and HA-RAMP1, respectively) have also been previously described (8Heroux M. Kim B. Hogue M. Bouvier M. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 7022-7033Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The RAMP1-YFP was generated by subcloning the coding sequence of enhanced YFP at the C terminus of Myc-RAMP1, yielding a five-amino acid linker encoding VPVAT between the two proteins. To obtain the CRLR, RAMP1, and CD8-C1 BiFC constructs, the cDNAs encoding amino acids residues 1-154 (YN) and 145-238 (YC) of enhanced YFP were fused at the C terminus of Myc-CRLR, Myc-RAMP1, and CD8-C1, creating a 10-amino acid linker encoding VPVNSGGGGS between the CRLR, RAMP1, or CD8-C1 and the YFP fragment. The two YFP fragments provide a 10-amino acid overlapping region (residues 145-154) that facilitates complementation (17Hu C.D. Kim T.K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfections—Human embryonic kidney 293T cells (HEK293T) and simian kidney fibroblasts (COS7) were maintained as described previously (8Heroux M. Kim B. Hogue M. Bouvier M. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 7022-7033Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation method for HEK293T cells (18Mellon P. Kim V. Gluzman Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1981; 27: 279-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) or the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) for COS7 cells, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and switched at 30 °C for another 24 h to promote maturation of the YFP fluorophore in BiFC experiments (17Hu C.D. Kim T.K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). For other experiments, transfected cells were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. Radioligand Binding—Transfected HEK293T cells were washed three times with cold PBS and incubated on ice for 3 h in binding buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) with 200 pm [125I]CGRP (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) in the absence (total binding) or presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled CGRP (Bachem AG). Nonspecific binding was defined as binding in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled CGRP. After incubation, the cells were washed once with binding buffer, washed twice with PBS, and then solubilized with 0.5 m NaOH. The associated cellular radioactivity was measured in a γ-counter. BRET Titration Curves and BRET/BiFC Assays—Transfected HEK293T cells were washed twice with PBS, detached, and resuspended in PBS containing 0.1% glucose. The cells were then distributed in 96-well plates (100,000 cells/well) (white plates from Corning), and coelenterazine H (Molecular Probes) was added at a final concentration of 5 μm. The readings were collected immediately following coelenterazine H addition using a Mithras LB 940 instrument (Berthold Technologies). The BRET signal corresponds to the ratio of the light emitted by the YFP (510-550 nm) over the light emitted by the Rluc (460-500 nm). The values were corrected by subtracting the background BRET signal detected when Rluc constructs were expressed alone. For BRET titration curve experiments, the cells were transfected with a constant amount of Rluc construct and increasing quantities of YFP construct. For competition assays, a constant amount of the competitor construct was also co-transfected. Total luminescence and fluorescence were measured (see below) to control for relative expression levels of donor and acceptor proteins, respectively. BRET values were then plotted as a function of the total fluorescence/luminescence ratios (YFP/Rluc) (19Mercier J.F. Kim A. Angers S. Breit A. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44925-44931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). For BRET/BiFC experiments, the cells were transfected with the different Rluc, YN, and YC constructs. Total luminescence and fluorescence were measured to control for relative expression level of Rluc fusion proteins and reconstitution of YFP from YN- and YC-fused proteins, respectively. For β-arrestin2 recruitment experiments, the cells distributed in 96-well plates were first treated with αCGRP (Bachem AG) for 10 min before the addition of coelenterazine H and BRET reading. Total Fluorescence and Luminescence Measurements—Transfected HEK293T cells resuspended in PBS 0.1% glucose were distributed in 96-well plates (100,000 cells/well) (white plates with clear bottoms from Corning), and the total fluorescence, emitted by YFP constructs or reconstituted YFP from YN and YC constructs, was measured using a FluoroCount (Packard Bioscience) with excitation and emission filters set at 485 and 530 nm, respectively. The values were corrected by subtracting the background signal detected in cells that were not transfected with YFP or BiFC constructs. The cells were then incubated for 10 min with coelenterazine H at a final concentration of 5 μm, and total luminescence was determined using a LumiCount (Packard Bioscience). Fluorescence Imaging—COS7 cells expressing the different fusion proteins were fixed and analyzed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy using a LSM 510 META Zeiss. YFP fluorescence was measured after excitation at 488 nm with a 505-530-nm emission filter, whereas DsRed fluorescence was detected after excitation at 543 nm with a 560-nm long pass emission filter. Co-immunoprecipitation—Transfected HEK293T cells were lysed for 1 h at 4 °C in solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm iodoacetamide, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin) and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to remove unsolubilized material. Protein concentration of the lysates was determined, and the total fluorescence emitted by reconstituted YFP was measured for each condition by distributing 130 μg of lysate in 96-well plates (see above). For each condition, the same quantity of lysate was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with immobilized anti-HA rat antibodies (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Antibody·antigen complexes were washed four times with cold solubilization buffer containing 150, 250, 350, and finally 150 mm NaCl, respectively, and transferred to 96-well plates to measure the total fluorescence emitted by reconstituted YFP associated with the immunoprecipitate. To control for the amount of HA-RAMP1 immunoprecipitated in each condition, antibody·antigen complexes were then resuspended in sample buffer (60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 4.5 m urea, and 100 mm dithiothreitol), resolved onto 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and subjected to immunoblotting using rabbit anti-HA antibodies (1/10 000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Statistical Analysis—In Fig. 1, multiple nonlinear regression analysis were performed using a bootstrap strategy to determine whether the BRETmax and BRET50 values obtained for each curves were significantly different. Nonlinear regressions were generated using Equation 1, where BRETmax and BRET50 parameters were optimized using the Levenberg-Marquardt method (20Marquardt D.W. J. Soc. Indust. Appl. Math. 1963; 11: 431-441Crossref Google Scholar) following the implementation proposed by Press et al. (21Press W.H. Kim S.A. Vetterling W.T. Flannery B.P. Numerical Recipes in C: The Art of Scientific Computing. 2002; (Cambridge University Press, New York)Google Scholar). Using resampling with replacement (22Efron B. Kim R.J. An Introduction to the Bootstrap. 1994; (Chapman & Hall/CRC, New York)Crossref Google Scholar), 100,000 bootstrap repetitions of this procedure were executed. The generated curves correspond to the optimal fit obtained from the data, whereas the gray zones represent 0.05-0.95 percentiles of the 100,000 curves, calculated for each YFP/Rluc data points. Significance of the difference in BRETmax and BRET50 is quantified by p values that are determined by a one-sided resampling-based test carried out on 1,000,000 repetitions. The p values were obtained by counting the proportion of fitted BRETmax or BRET50 values that were not greater for the experimental conditions (i.e. in the presence of RAMP1, CD8-C1, CRLR, or Fz4m) than for the control data set (i.e. in the presence of empty vector). A p value below 0.05 was considered significant. BRET=BRETmax·xBRET50+x where x is the YFP/Rluc ratio. In Figs. 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8 the data represent the means ± S.E. calculated from three to four independent experiments. Statistical significance of the difference was assessed using analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's test (Figs. 2 and 5) or Student's t test (Figs. 4, inset, and 6).FIGURE 4Validation of the BRET/BiFC approach.

Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 7022-7033Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), raising questions about the oligomeric composition of the CRLR·RAMP1 complex. To examine whether the association of CRLR with RAMP1 competes with the homo-oligomerization of each of the partners or results from the association between homo-oligomers, we performed BRET competition assays that assess the effect of CRLR and RAMP1 co-expression on their homo-oligomerization status. For this purpose, CRLR and RAMP1 were genetically fused at their C termini to either the energy donor (Rluc) or acceptor (YFP). Such fusion did not significantly affect the normal subcellular distribution of CRLR or RAMP1 nor their ability to confer CGRP binding upon co-expression (Ref. 8Heroux M. Kim B. Hogue M. Bouvier M. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 7022-7033Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar and data not shown). BRET titration curves were generated by expressing a constant level of the donor fusion protein and increasing amounts of the protein attached to the acceptor. As can be seen in Fig. 1, for both the CRLR-Rluc·CRLR-YFP and RAMP1-Rluc·RAMP1-YFP pairs, BRET signals increased as an hyperbolic function of the acceptor concentration (expressed as YFP/Rluc), representing the progressive engagements of the energy donors by the acceptor. Whereas the value of the curve asymptotes (BRETmax) reflects the orientation and distance between the energy donor and acceptor within the dimer, the concentration of acceptor/donor (YFP/Rluc) yielding 50% of the BRETmax (BRET50) indicates the relative amount of YFP-fused partner needed to saturate the energy donor (19Mercier J.F.

It should therefore be emphasized that the lower BRETmax value observed for CRLR-Rluc·CRLR-YFP compared with RAMP1-Rluc·RAMP1-YFP is not an indication of a lower propensity to form oligomers but most likely reflects distinct relative position of the energy donor and acceptor within the oligomers. To assess the influence of CRLR·RAMP1 complex formation on the homo-oligomerization profiles of both CRLR and RAMP1, the BRET titration curves were carried out in the presence of their untagged reciprocal partner (RAMP1 in the case of the CRLR-Rluc·CRLR-YFP and CRLR for the RAMP1-Rluc·RAMP1-YFP). If the association of CRLR with RAMP1 occurs at the expense of homo-oligomerization, the addition of a constant amount of untagged reciprocal partner would be predicted to cause a rightward shift in the BRET titration curve (increase in BRET50) resulting from the scavenging of the YFP and Rluc fusion proteins by the untagged partner. Indeed, the reduction in the proportion of fusion proteins available for RET would lead to an increase in the YFP/Rluc ratio needed to reach BRETmax values. In contrast, a change in BRETmax in the absence of BRET50 modification would suggest a conformational rearrangement of the complex resulting from the association of the homo-oligomers with the untagged reciprocal partner leading to a change in the orientation and/or the distance between YFP and Rluc within the oligomeric complex. To determine whether the BRETmax and BRET50 value obtained for each curve was significantly affected by the addition of the untagged reciprocal partners, multiple repeated nonlinear regression analyses of the BRET titration curves were performed using a bootstrap strategy described under “Experimental Procedures.” Co-expression of RAMP1 in CRLR-Rluc·CRLR-YFP-expressing cells led to a significant increase in BRETmax without significantly affecting the BRET50 (Fig. 1A), indicating that RAMP1 did not compete for CRLR homo-oligomerization but promoted a conformational change leading to a better orientation for RET or a smaller distance between YFP and Rluc within the CRLR·CRLR oligomer. To verify the selectivity of action of RAMP1, we assessed the effect of another single transmembrane protein, CD8, which, similarly to RAMP1 and CRLR expressed alone, is retained in the ER as a result of its fusion to the C1 cassette of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor NR1 subunit (CD8-C1 (23Xia H. Kim Z.D. Malenka R.C. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 41: 714-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar)). Although properly expressed, as assessed by Western blot analysis (data not shown) and fluorescence microscopy (see Fig. 3), CD8-C1 was without effect on the CRLR-Rluc·CRLR-YFP BRET titration curve, confirming that overexpressing a protein in the ER is not sufficient to affect the BRET signals. When considering the RAMP1-Rluc·RAMP1-YFP pair, co-transfection of CRLR promoted a significant rightward shift in the titration curve (increase in BRET50) with no change in the BRETmax (Fig. 1B), indicating that the presence of CRLR reduced the fraction of RAMP1 partners available for RET, thus suggesting that CRLR competes for RAMP1 homo-oligomerization. Although the change in BRET50 is relatively modest (2.3-fold), bootstrapping analysis of the curves, determined by a one-sided resampling-based test, indicated that the difference between the curves carried out in the presence and absence of CRLR was highly significant (p = 3 × 10-6). The selectivity of RAMP1 homo-oligomerization competition by CRLR was assessed by evaluating the effect of an unrelated 7TM receptor, Frizzled 4, which was truncated from its last four amino acids (Fz4m) to mimic the intracellular localization of RAMP1 and CRLR expressed alone (24Kaykas A. Kim J. Heroux M. Shah K.V. Bouvier M. Moon R.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 1B, the expression of Fz4m, which was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy (data not shown), did not significantly affect the RAMP1-Rluc·RAMP1-YFP BRET titration curve. Taken together, the BRET competition assays indicate that RAMP1 association to the complex can occur without dissociation of the CRLR homo-oligomer, whereas CRLR interaction with RAMP1 appears to interfere with the formation of RAMP1 homo-oligomers. These data are compatible with an asymmetrical complex model whereby one molecule of RAMP1 associates with a CRLR homo-oligomer. Establishing the BiFC Assay for Detection of the CRLR and RAMP1 Homo- and Hetero-oligomers—Although the BRET competition assays described above suggest that the CGRP receptor is formed by a CRLR homo-oligomer associated to a RAMP1 monomer, it does not provide a direct proof of the existence of such an asymmetric complex. To directly test this model, we combined the use of BRET and BiFC to probe the simultaneous interaction between three proteins. The dual BRET/BiFC approach is based on the transfer of energy between the luminescent enzyme Rluc and YFP reconstituted as a result of BiFC. In these experiments, the YFP is split in two parts (designated YN and YC fragments) that are each expres"
https://openalex.org/W2004074456,"Background The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) fuels tuberculosis (TB) epidemics. In controlled clinical trials, antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces TB incidence in HIV-infected patients. In this study we determine if, under programmatic conditions, Brazil's policy of universal ART access has impacted TB incidence among HIV-infected patients. Methods We abstracted clinical information from records of HIV-infected patients managed in the public sector in 11 Brazilian states between 1/1/1995 and 12/31/2001. Case ascertainment (TB and HIV) utilized guidelines (with added stringency) published by Brazil's Ministry of Health. We determined TB incidence and hazards ratio (HR) for ART-naïve and ART-treated [including highly active ART (HAART)] patients employing Cox proportional hazards analysis. Results Information from 463 HIV-infected patients met study criteria. The median age of the study population was 34 years, 70% were male, and mean follow-up to primary endpoints—TB, death, and last clinic visit—was 330, 1059, and 1125 days, respectively. Of the 463 patients, 76 (16%) remained ART-naïve. Of the patients who never received HAART (n = 157) 81 were treated with ART non-HAART. Of the patients who received any ART (n = 387), 306 were treated with HAART (includes those patients who later switched from ART non-HAART to HAART). Tuberculosis developed in 39/463 (8%) patients. Compared to HAART- and ART non-HAART-treated patient groups, TB incidence was 10- (p<0.001) and 2.5-fold (p = 0.03) higher in ART-naïve patients, respectively. The median baseline absolute CD4+ T-lymphocyte count for patients who developed TB was not significantly different from that of patients who remained TB free. In multivariate analysis, the incidence of TB was statistically significantly lower in HAART-treated [HR 0.2; 95% (CI 0.1, 0.6); p<0.01] compared to ART naïve patients. A baseline CD4+ T-lymphocyte count <200 cells/mm3 [HR 2.5; (95% CI 1.2, 5.4); p<0.01], prior hospitalization [HR 4.2; (95% CI 2.0, 8.8); p<0.001], prior incarceration [HR 4.1; 95% CI 1.6, 10.3); p<0.01], and a positive tuberculin skin test [HR 3.1; (95% CI 1.1, 9.0); p = 0.04] were independently and positively associated with incident TB. Conclusion In this population-based study we demonstrate an 80% reduction in incident TB, under programmatic conditions, in HAART-treated HIV-infected patients compared to ART-naïve patients."
https://openalex.org/W2072716993,"The prevailing hypothesis regards schizophrenia as a polygenic disease, in which multiple genes combine with each other and with environmental stimuli to produce the variance of its clinical symptoms. We investigated whether the ubiquitous transcription factor Sp1 is abnormally expressed in schizophrenia, and consequently can affect the expression of genes implicated in this disorder.mRNA of Sp1 and of mitochondrial complex I subunits (NDUFV1, NDUFV2) was analyzed in three postmortem brain regions obtained from the Stanley Foundation Brain Collection, and in lymphocytes of schizophrenic patients and controls. Sp1 role in the transcription of these genes was studied as well. Sp1 was abnormally expressed in schizophrenia in both brain and periphery. Its mRNA alteration pattern paralleled that of NDUFV1 and NDUFV2, decreasing in the prefrontal cortex and the striatum, while increasing in the parieto-occipital cortex and in lymphocytes of schizophrenic patients as compared with controls. Moreover, a high and significant correlation between these genes existed in normal subjects, but was distorted in patients. Sp1 role in the regulation of complex I subunits, was demonstrated by the ability of the Sp1/DNA binding inhibitor, mithramycin, to inhibit the transcription of NDUFV1 and NDUFV2, in neuroblastoma cells. In addition, Sp1 activated NDUFV2 promoter by binding to its three GC-boxes. Both activation and binding were inhibited by mithramycin.These findings suggest that abnormality in Sp1, which can be the main activator/repressor or act in combination with additional transcription factors and is subjected to environmental stimuli, can contribute to the polygenic and clinically heterogeneous nature of schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2010677325,"In vitro studies have pointed to the collapsin response mediator proteins (CRMPs) as key regulators of neurite outgrowth and axonal differentiation. CRMP3 is expressed mostly in the nervous system during development but remains at high levels in the hippocampus of adults. To explore CRMP3 function in vivo, we generated mice with targeted disruption of the CRMP3 gene. Immunohistochemistry and Golgi staining of CA1 showed abnormal dendrite and spine morphogenesis in the hippocampus of CRMP3-deficient mice. Apical dendrites displayed an increase in undulation and a reduction in length and branching points. Basal dendrites also exhibited a reduction in length with an alteration in soma stem distribution and an increased number of thick dendrites localized in stratum oriens (SO). Long-term potentiation (LTP) was impaired in this area. These data indicate an important role for CRMP3 in dendrite arborization, guide-posts navigation, and neuronal plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2158038706,"Background The major hindrance to imaging the intact adult Drosophila is that the dark exoskeleton makes it impossible to image through the cuticle. We have overcome this obstacle and describe a method whereby the internal organs of adult Drosophila can be imaged in 3D by bleaching and clearing the adult and then imaging using a technique called optical projection tomography (OPT). The data is displayed as 2D optical sections and also in 3D to provide detail on the shape and structure of the adult anatomy. Methodology We have used OPT to visualize in 2D and 3D the detailed internal anatomy of the intact adult Drosophila. In addition this clearing method used for OPT was tested for imaging with confocal microscopy. Using OPT we have visualized the size and shape of neurodegenerative vacuoles from within the head capsule of flies that suffer from age-related neurodegeneration due to a lack of ADAR mediated RNA-editing. In addition we have visualized tau-lacZ expression in 2D and 3D. This shows that the wholemount adult can be stained without any manipulation and that this stain penetrates well as we have mapped the localization pattern with respect to the internal anatomy. Conclusion We show for the first time that the intact adult Drosophila can be imaged in 3D using OPT, also we show that this method of clearing is also suitable for confocal microscopy to image the brain from within the intact head. The major advantage of this is that organs can be represented in 3D in their natural surroundings. Furthermore optical sections are generated in each of the three planes and are not prone to the technical limitations that are associated with manual sectioning. OPT can be used to dissect mutant phenotypes and to globally map gene expression in both 2D and 3D."
https://openalex.org/W2164468235,"Competitive antagonists of the human prolactin (hPRL) receptor are a novel class of molecules of potential therapeutic interest in the context of cancer. We recently developed the pure antagonist Del1-9-G129R-hPRL by deleting the nine N-terminal residues of G129R-hPRL, a first generation partial antagonist. We determined the crystallographic structure of Del1-9-G129R-hPRL, which revealed no major change compared with wild type hPRL, indicating that its pure antagonistic properties are intrinsically due to the mutations. To decipher the molecular bases of pure antagonism, we compared the biological, physicochemical, and structural properties of numerous hPRL variants harboring N-terminal or Gly129 mutations, alone or combined. The pure versus partial antagonistic properties of the multiple hPRL variants could not be correlated to differences in their affinities toward the hPRL receptor, especially at site 2 as determined by surface plasmon resonance. On the contrary, residual agonism of the hPRL variants was found to be inversely correlated to their thermodynamic stability, which was altered by all the Gly129 mutations but not by those involving the N terminus. We therefore propose that residual agonism can be abolished either by further disrupting hormone site 2-receptor contacts by N-terminal deletion, as in Del1-9-G129R-hPRL, or by stabilizing hPRL and constraining its intrinsic flexibility, as in G129V-hPRL.

Touraine P. Culler M.D. Kelly P.A. Nat. Clin. Pract. Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 2: 571-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These include dopamine-resistant prolactinomas (i.e. pituitary tumors of PRL-secreting cells), as well as breast cancer, prostate cancer, and benign prostate hyperplasia, in which evidence for the tumor growth-promoting actions of autocrine PRL has been emerging within the past decade (2Goffin V. Bernichtein S. Touraine P. Kelly P.A. Endocr. Rev. 2005; 26: 400-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 3Clevenger C.V. Furth P.A. Hankinson S.E. Schuler L.A. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In view of the ubiquitous expression pattern of the PRLR (4Bole-Feysot C. Goffin V. Edery M. Binart N. Kelly P.A. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 225-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar), these indications are not necessarily exhaustive and may be extended to other pathologies that remain to be identified (or better characterized) with respect to the involvement of locally produced PRL in their etiology. Because of their mechanism of action involving competition with endogenous hPRL for receptor binding, competitive hPRLR antagonists need to be used in molar excess compared with endogenous hPRL. Therefore, the most promising compounds are anticipated to be those that are devoid of any residual agonistic properties, even at high concentration (5Bernichtein S. Kayser C. Dillner K. Moulin S.

We recently developed an antagonist exhibiting such unique properties, referred to as Del1-9-G129R-hPRL. In contrast to other antagonists developed to date (for reviews see Refs. 2Goffin V.

As highlighted by its name, Del1-9-G129R-hPRL is a hPRL core protein containing two modifications: deletion of the nine N-terminal residues, and substitution of Gly129 for an Arg (5Bernichtein S. Kayser C. Dillner K. Moulin S. Kopchick J.J. Martial J.A. Norstedt G. Isaksson O. Kelly P.A. Goffin V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35988-35999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The rationale for engineering this variant was based on previous structure-function studies performed in the Goffin laboratory. First, as demonstrated for all members of the PRL/growth hormone (GH)/placental lactogen (PL) family (2Goffin V. Bernichtein S. Touraine P. Kelly P.A. Endocr. Rev. 2005; 26: 400-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), substitution of the conserved helix 3 Gly for an Arg was shown to drastically impair the agonistic properties of hPRL while maintaining its ability to bind to the PRLR (12Goffin V.

Second, the sole G129R mutation appeared to be insufficient to completely abolish the ability to activate the PRLR, as highlighted in sensitive cell bioassays (12Goffin V. Struman I. Mainfroid V. Kinet S. Martial J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32598-32606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bernichtein S. Jeay S. Vaudry R. Kelly P.A. Goffin V. Endocrine. 2003; 20: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) or in transgenic mice overexpressing this variant. 5V. Rouet, C. Kayser, and V. Goffin, unpublished observations. Third, mutations of the N terminus, which is interestingly the most divergent region within the PRL/GH/PL family, were shown to slightly modulate the properties of hPRL (16Bernichtein S. Jomain J.B. Kelly P.A. Goffin V. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2003; 208: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although the combination of the N terminus deletion and the G129R mutation was successful in achieving the goal of generating a pure PRLR antagonist, the mechanism underlying these unique properties remained poorly understood. Although structural studies of the hGH·hGHR complex have clearly identified the helix 3 Gly pocket as a critical characteristic of binding site 2 (17De Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar, 18Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), the roles of the structurally equivalent region (Gly129), and even more of the N terminus, in receptor binding and activation have remained largely speculative for hPRL. Ultimately, this lack of information about the molecular bases of our best antagonist hampers its improvement through knowledge-assisted strategies. The aim of this work was to elucidate the importance of these two hPRL modifications at the molecular level, using a combination of structural, biophysical, and biological approaches. First, to identify the structural characteristics underlying its pure antagonistic properties, we determined the three-dimensional structure of Del1-9-G129R-hPRL by x-ray diffraction. Second, we generated numerous hPRL variants harboring single or combined modifications at the N terminus (deletion/elongation) and the Gly129 residue (different substitutions), to be compared with the prototype G129R-hPRL and Del1-9-G129R-hPRL variants. These mutants were analyzed for their (residual) agonistic and antagonistic properties in cell bioassays, and for their thermodynamic stability and structural integrity. Finally, we designed an appropriate methodology to determine independently the affinities of binding sites 1 and 2 of all the variants by surface plasmon resonance. Culture media, fetal calf serum (FCS), geneticin (G-418), trypsin, and glutamine were purchased from Invitrogen. Luciferin and cell lysis buffer were from Promega (Madison, WI), and luciferase activity was measured in relative light units using a Lumat LB 9501 (Berthold, Nashua, NH). IODO-GEN was purchased from Sigma, and carrier-free Na125I was obtained from GE Healthcare. Oligonucleotides were from Eurogentec (Liège, Belgium). All immobilization reagents used for surface plasmon resonance experiments were purchased from Biacore (Uppsala, Sweden). Optimization of crystallization conditions was performed in Linbro plates from Hampton. Chemicals were purchased from Sigma, VWR (Fontenay-sous-Bois, France), or Merck. Expression plasmids encoding WT hPRL, G129R-hPRL, and Del1-9-G129R-hPRL were available from previous studies (5Bernichtein S. Kayser C. Dillner K. Moulin S. Kopchick J.J. Martial J.A. Norstedt G.

Subcloning constraints led to the addition of four amino acids just before the His tag (Gly211-Ser212-Arg213-Ser214 for hECD, and Arg211-Ser212-Arg213-Ser214 for rECD) as described (21Teilum K.

Recombinant WT hPRL, hPRL variants, and PRLR ECDs were overexpressed in 0.5-1-liter cultures of E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified as described previously (22Paris N. Rentier-Delrue F. Defontaine A. Goffin V. Lebrun J.J. Mercier L. Martial J.A. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1990; 12: 436-449PubMed Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, when the A600 of bacterial cultures reached 0.7-0.9, overexpression was induced using 2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h (A600 = 2-2.5 after 4 h). Cells were broken using high pressure (French press). Proteins were overexpressed as insoluble inclusion bodies, which were solubilized in 8 m urea (5 min at 55 °C and then 2 h at room temperature) and refolded by continuous dialysis (72 h, 4 °C) against 100 volumes of 25 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.6. Solubilized proteins were centrifuged and then loaded onto a HiTrap Q anion exchange column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 25 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.6. Prolactin (WT and variants) and receptor ECDs were eluted along a NaCl gradient (0-500 mm), and the major peak was collected, quantified, and kept frozen until use. Purity of the various hPRL variant/receptor ECD batches was >95% as judged from SDS-PAGE analysis. Initial crystallization screening was performed in 96-well sitting drop crystallization plates (Greiner Bio-One) using a Cybi-Disk robot from Cybio. Crystallization screens were set up using several commercially available high throughput crystallization screening kits (Hampton Research). Crystals appeared as needle clusters after 1 week at 18 °C in several conditions (29Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The initial crystals were refined using standard techniques, which lead to isolated needles too thin to be collected. A second screening was performed by mixing 75% of the optimized crystallization solution with 25% of the crystal screen kits from Hampton. Larger needles appeared in five new conditions. After manual optimization in Linbro plates using the hanging drop method, only one led to diffracting crystals. The corresponding reservoir was composed of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 675 mm K2HPO4, 45 mm (NH4)2PO4, 50 mm LiSO4, 7.5% glycerol, 8% PEG4000. The drop was formed by mixing 1.5 μl of protein at 10 mg/ml with 1.5 μl of reservoir. The largest final crystal size was 40 × 40 × 200 μm3. Best diffracting crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen without previous soaking. A complete data set at 2.6 Å resolution was obtained on the ID29 beam line at ESRF (Grenoble, France). The diffraction images were reduced, scaled, and merged with programs MOSFLM and SCALA (23Potterton E. Briggs P. Turkenburg M. Dodson E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol.

The crystals belonged to space group I4 with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 122.59 Å, c = 28.68 Å. The Matthews coefficient (2.25) and solvent content analysis (∼42%) indicated the presence of one antagonist molecule in the asymmetric unit.TABLE 2X-ray diffraction data collection and refinement statistics for Del1-9-G129R-hPRLData collectionSpace group14Unit cell parameter (Å)a = b = 122.59, c = 28.68Resolution (Å)85.00-2.60 (2.74-2.60)aValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.Total no. of reflections15,583 (2216)No. of unique reflections6433 (905)Completeness (%)93.8 (93.1)RmergebRmerge = ∑h∑j|〈I〉h - Ih,j|/∑h∑jIh,j, where 〈I〉h is the mean intensity of symmetry equivalent reflections.0.080 (0.235)I/σ(I)12.1 (5.5)Multiplicity2.4 (2.4)RefinementResolution (Å)20.0-2.7 (2.77-2.7)No. of reflections5139 (375)R/Rfree (%)c∑|Fobs - Fcalc|/∑Fobs.

A PHASER search with the WT hPRL structure resolved by NMR (Protein Data Bank code 1RW5) used as search model also yielded the right solution, but the PHASER statistics were not convincing. Refinement of the structure was carried out through multiple cycles of manual rebuilding using the program O (28Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) and refinement using Refmac5 (29Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The refined structure was validated by the program PROCHECK (30Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Figure panels showing three-dimensional structures were generated using the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (DeLano Scientific). The refined structure of the antagonist and that of WT hPRL (PDB code 1RW5) (21Teilum K. Hoch J.C. Goffin V. Kinet S. Martial J.A. Kragelund B.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 810-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) were both subjected to all-atom normal mode analysis, using the web-based servers HingeMaster (31Flores S. Echols N. Milburn D. Hespenheide B. Keating K. Lu J. Wells S. Yu E.Z. Thorpe M. Gerstein M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D296-D301Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and NOMAD-Ref (32Lindahl E. Azuara C. Koehl P. Delarue M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: W52-W56Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Far-UV CD spectra as well as temperature melts of all hPRL variants were recorded on a Jasco 810 spectropolarimeter. Temperature melts were performed in 0.01 m NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, using a water-jacketed cuvette of 1-cm light path length, from 37 to 95 °C, and the change in signal followed at 222 nm. Far-UV CD spectra were run at 37 °C from 250 to 190 nm, with a 1-cm path length. However, because of high absorbance from buffer, no signal below 197 to 195 nm could be interpreted. Protein concentrations were set at ∼1-2 μm for the temperature melts and far-UV CD spectra. Unfolding was assumed to follow a two-state transition. Circular dichroism thermal scans were fitted to the Gibbs-Helmholz equation as described (33Oliveberg M. Vuilleumier S. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8826-8832Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), using Gnuplot. Because of the high melting temperatures, which result in the lack of sufficient post-transition regions, it was assumed that the unfolded state was unchanged by the mutations. The slope of the post-transition region was therefore extrapolated for each mutant protein from the well determined post-transition of G129P-hPRL. The results of the fits are melting temperature (Tm) and change in enthalpy on unfolding at Tm (ΔH(Tm)). Immobilization of PRLR ECD—As a first approach, the ECDs (human or rat) were covalently coupled in a random orientation, through their solvent-accessible primary amine groups, to the carboxymethylated dextran matrix of a CM5 sensor chip, using a Biacore 2000 instrument and the amine coupling kit (Biacore), according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, each flow cell, equilibrated at a flow rate of 5 μl/min in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4, supplemented with 0.005% Tween 20), was activated for 12 min with an NHS-EDC solution (50 mm N-hydroxysuccinimide and 200 mm N-ethyl-N′-(3 dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide), followed by an injection of the ECD of interest (100 nm) in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5. The surface was finally deactivated for 12 min with 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. We routinely immobilized 500-1500 resonance units (1 resonance unit ∼1 pg·mm-2) of ECD on three flow cells out of four on the sensor chip. The fourth, treated only by NHS-EDC and ethanolamine, was used as a reference surface. In a second approach, the ECDs were covalently coupled in an oriented fashion onto a nitrilotriacetic acid-derivatized NTA sensor chip, as described (34Willard F.S. Siderovski D.P. Anal. Biochem. 2006; 353: 147-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, each flow cell, equilibrated at a flow rate of 5 μl/min in PBS supplemented with 0.005% Tween 20 and 50 μm EDTA, was sequentially loaded with 500 μm NiCl2 for 4 min and activated with NHS-EDC for 2 min. The His6-tagged ECD (100 nm in PBS/Tween/EDTA) was injected until 500-2,000 resonance units were captured by the Ni-NTA moieties. The surface was finally deactivated by a 4-min ethanolamine injection, followed by a 2-min injection of EDTA 0.35 m. One flow cell was used as a reference surface, after activation by NiCl2 and NHS-EDC, and deactivation by ethanolamine and EDTA. Real Time Binding Assays—All the binding assays were performed at 25 °C at a flow rate of 20 μl/min, in running buffer (25 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Tween 20). For site 1 characterization, 5-8 different concentrations (ranging from 0.54 to 350 nm) of the hPRL variants were injected for 12 min onto the PRLR surfaces, followed by a 10-min dissociation period. At the end of each cycle, the sensor chip was regenerated by two 1-min injections of 2 m MgCl2 (followed by a 1-min injection of EDTA 0.35 m for Ni-NTA chips only). For site 2 characterization, the PRLR surface was first saturated with each hPRL variant (350 nm). Five concentrations of ECD (ranging from 1.7 to 350 μm) were then injected for 2 min on the ECD·PRL complexes, followed by a 5-min dissociation period. Control experiments showed the absence of detectable ECD-ECD interaction in the absence of hormone (not shown). Data Analysis—All the association and dissociation profiles were double-referenced using the Scrubber 2.0 software. The site 1 binding curves were globally analyzed with a nonlinear least squares algorithm implemented in the BIAevaluation 4.1 software (Biacore), using single-exponential functions of time (Langmuir monovalent binding model). The site 2 binding curves were subjected to steady-state analysis. Kinetic parameters (kon and koff) and equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) were determined based on at least two experiments. Binding affinities of hPRL variants were determined using cell homogenates of HEK 293 cells stably expressing the human PRLR (so-called HL-5 clone), following a procedure described previously (14Kinet S. Bernichtein S. Kelly P.A. Martial J.A. Goffin V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26033-26043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, hPRL was iodinated using IODO-GEN, and binding assays were performed overnight at room temperature using 150-300 μg of cell homogenate protein in the presence of 20,000-30,000 cpm 125I-labeled hPRL and increasing concentrations of unlabeled competitor (WT or mutated hPRL). Results presented are representative of at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate. The relative binding affinities of hPRL variants were calculated with respect to that of WT hPRL based on their IC50. The biological properties of hPRL variants were analyzed using two homologous bioassays that we recently developed for human lactogens (15Bernichtein S. Jeay S. Vaudry R. Kelly P.A. Goffin V. Endocrine. 2003; 20: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The transcriptional assay involved HEK 293 cells stably expressing the hPRLR and the lactogenic hormone-response element-luciferase reporter gene (HL-5 clone); it was used to determine the antagonistic properties by competing a fixed concentration (9 nm) of WT hPRL with increasing amounts of each variant (14Kinet S.

A proliferation assay was also performed to determine the residual agonistic activity of the antagonists, using Ba/F-03 cells stably expressing the human PRLR (referred to as Ba/F-LP cells); this assay has been shown to be much more sensitive than the HL-5 clone to reveal low level agonistic effects (5Bernichtein S.

The pore helix/loop/helix motifs that are contributed by three subunits unfold independently of the protein cage, as observed by crystallography, Fe removal rates, and CD spectroscopy. Pore unfolding is induced in wild type ferritin by increased temperature or urea (1–10 mm), a physiological urea range, 0.1 mm guanidine, or mutation of conserved pore amino acids. A peptide selected for ferritin pore binding from a combinatorial, heptapeptide library increased the rate of Fe demineralization 3-fold (p < 0.001), similarly to a mutation that unfolded the pores. Conjugating the peptide to Desferal® (desferrioxamine B mesylate), a chelator in therapeutic use, increased the rates to 8-fold (p < 0.001). A second pore binding peptide had the opposite effect and decreased the rate of Fe demineralization 60% (p < 0.001). The peptides could have pharmacological uses and may model regulators of ferritin demineralization rates in vivo or peptide regulators of gated pores in membranes. The results emphasize that small peptides can exploit the structural plasticity of protein pores to modulate function.

The results emphasize that small peptides can exploit the structural plasticity of protein pores to modulate function. Pores in ferritin protein cages are an example of pores in molecular or ionic barriers; other examples are pores in membranes. In ferritin, pores control reactions between reductants outside the protein and the ferric mineral inside. As with many gated pores, ferritin pores are formed by α-helices in multiple subunits that surround the ion path and are modulated by unfolding (1Sachs J.N. Kim D.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 2Liu X. Kim E.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 2005; 38: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Ferritin pores are arranged symmetrically around the protein cage, eight for 24 subunit maxi-ferritins and four for 12 subunit maxi-ferritins, also called Dps proteins (2Liu X. Kim E.C. Acc. Chem.

Ferritins concentrate Fe for biological use and also detoxify Fe/O2 or H2O2 in the ferric/oxy biomineral inside the proteins of Archaea, bacteria, and Eukaryota, including higher plants and animals. Fe ions destined to enter the mineral appear to reach the ferroxidase coupling site through the pores for the first step in biomineralization (2Liu X. Kim E.C. Acc. Chem.

The rates of Fe transport from the ferritin mineral through the nanocage channels and pores to chelators on the outside of the nanocage are initiated by external reductant and increase under several conditions. (i) Highly conserved, ferritin pore residues are changed. (ii) The temperature is increased. (iii) Urea is added at physiological concentrations (1–10 mm). The increased rate of Fe2+ exit coincides with localized unfolding of ferritin pore helices (crystallography) and a decrease in the melting transition for 10% of the total α-helix content, Tm = 56 °C; Tm = 43 °C in 1 mm urea (CD spectroscopy) (2Liu X.

In contrast to the pores, global unfolding of the protein nanocage requires high temperatures (>80 °C) or high concentrations of urea (6 m) plus an acidic pH (pH = 4.5). Folding/unfolding of protein subdomains, such as the ferritin pores, occurs in other ion channel proteins, e.g. Refs. 16Chandra S. Kim G. Fernandez-Chacon R. Schluter O.M. Sudhof T.C.

(i) Fe3+ is reduced and hydrated to convert mineralized Fe3+ to mononuclear Fe2+. (ii) Fe2+ moves through the protein channels to and through the pores. (iii) Fe2+ exiting the protein cage is complexed to a chelator or putative protein chaperone. Complexation of the exiting Fe2+ with a chelator can be monitored by the visible absorption of Fe2+, bipyridyl, or Fe3+, desferrioxamine B, a therapeutic chelator, formed outside the protein (13Takagi H.

Theil E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3653-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), peptides would also selectively recognize the ferritin protein nanocage pores and that such peptides could be identified in a combinatorial peptide library by selection with two ferritins, one with folded pores (wild type) and one with pores unfolded by substitution of a conserved amino acid in the channel (L134P) (15Liu X. Kim W. Theil E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3653-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Our hypothesis was supported by finding, among five peptides that selectively bound to ferritin, one peptide that increased pore unfolding in wild type ferritin (peptide 1) (reductant-dependent increase in Fe2+ chelator complex formation rate) with no effect on Fe2+ entry/mineralization and no effect on the L134P protein with fully open pores. Another peptide (peptide 4) decreased rates of Fe chelation. In addition, increasing DFO 4The abbreviations used are: DFO, desferrioxamine B; WT, wild type ferritin; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; SFO, succinyl ferrioxamine; LC/MS/MS, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry; E‡, activation energy. concentration near the pore by conjugation to peptide 1 via a succinyl-serine link overcame the rate difference between wild type protein + peptide and L134P that may reflect competing reactions during oxidation to stable Fe3+-DFO. The peptides identified could model peptides or proteins that regulate ferritin pores and may have pharmacological uses.

Protein Isolation and Mineralization and Analysis of Fe Chelation Rates—Recombinant ferritin apoprotein nanocages were purified, and the Fe/oxy mineral was formed (480 Fe/protein nanocage) in solutions of ferritin nanocages (2.06 μm protein, 100 mm MOPS, and 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0), as described previously (13Takagi H.

Formation of Fe2+-bipyridyl was monitored at 522 nm, and formation of Fe3+-desferrioxamine B was monitored at 430 nm (15Liu X. Kim W. Theil E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Initial rates of iron release were calculated from the progress curves for the formation of Fe chelator complexes as described previously (15Liu X. Kim W. Theil E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The goodness of fit parameter for linear fits (χ2/degrees of freedom in the model) was set to <6. All nonlinear models tested were rejected by the program; for linear fits, p = 0.04. Data from 3 independent measurements/protein preparations were averaged for each time point, and the average was used for fitting. The mineral formed inside of ferritin in vitro has the spectroscopic properties of the natural biomineral (18Lewin A.C. Kim G.R. Le Brun N.E.

Selective Peptide Binding to Ferritin Using Phage Display—Ferritin binding peptides were identified using phage display and a combinatorial library (2.8 × 109) of random heptapeptides fused to a minor coat protein (pIII) of M13 phage (Ph.D.™-7, from New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) (31Parmley S.F. Kim G.P. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 73: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 32Rodi D.J. Kim L. Kay B.K. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). At the time the experiments were designed, selection of the heptapeptide combinatorial library was based on costs of the only other commercial phage display library (a dodecapeptide) or synthesis of such a library. Ferritin H (frog) was used as the adsorbent for the peptides. After four rounds of selection, no further decrease in phage number occurred. Phage-displaying Group A peptides (n = 428) were eluted from WT ferritin with the mutant L134P that had unfolded pores (13Takagi H. Kim D. Ha Y. Allewell N.M. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18685-18688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 14Jin W. Kim H. Pancorbo N.M. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7525-7532Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 15Liu X. Kim W. Theil E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3653-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Phage in Group B (n = 600) were eluted with WT ferritin after elution with L134P protein. After translating in silico the phage DNA that encoded the two groups of binding peptides, five consensus peptide sequences were obtained. Group A had two consensus peptide sequences, 1 and 2, and Group B had three consensus peptide sequences, 3, 4, and 5. Effects of Peptides on Ferritin Pore Function—Peptides, predicted from the DNA identified by phage display, were synthesized as undecapeptides; the cost/benefit of determining binding constants with radioactive peptides is beyond the scope of this report and the hypotheses tested. Heptapeptides were synthesized with two phage coat protein residues at the N terminus (HS) and two at the C terminus (GG) to facilitate synthesis of some of the sequences and to enhance solubility. Peptides were obtained from AnaSpec, Inc. (San Jose, CA). Effects of the five peptides on ferritin demineralization rates were analyzed by mixing mineralized ferritin with the peptide for 1 h, at 25 °C, before initiating demineralization by adding reductant, 2.5 mm FMN, 2.5 mm NADH (24Jones T. Kim R. Walsh C. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4011-4017Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Initial rates of Fe removal from the mineral and protein nanocage were measured as initial rates of formation of Fe2+-bipyridyl or air-oxidized Fe2+-desferrioxamine B, as described in earlier studies (14Jin W. Kim H. Pancorbo N.M. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7525-7532Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 15Liu X. Kim W. Theil E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3653-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Coupling of Peptide 1 to a Chelator—Peptide 1 was derivatized and conjugated to DFO (1) via a DFO-succinyl-serine-peptide 1 link. (Note that the numbers in bold indicate the intermediates in the synthesis in Scheme 1, supplemental materials.) The approach of using carboxyl activation of a DFO derivative avoided the necessity for extensive protecting group chemistry on the two primary amino groups of the peptide. The addition of serine to the N terminus of peptide 1 created Hser-His-Ser-Asn-Thr-Tyr-Tyr-Phe-Pro-Lys-Gly-Gly-COOH. Desferrioxamine B was reacted with succinic anhydride (33Adapa S. Kim P. Keller-Schierlein W. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1982; 65: 1818-1824Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 34Herscheid J.D. Kim A. Vos C.M. Eur. J. Nucl.

To provide temporary protection of the hydroxamate components of the succinyl-DFO (2) (Scheme 1, supplemental materials), and to facilitate active ester formation, the succinyl ferrioxamine (SFO) (3) (Scheme 1, supplemental materials) was formed (33Adapa S. Kim P. Keller-Schierlein W. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1982; 65: 1818-1824Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 34Herscheid J.D. Kim A. Vos C.M. Eur. J. Nucl.

Med. Chem. 1983; 26: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Coupling of Ser-peptide 1 with SFO occurred upon reaction of the N-hydroxysuccinimide active ester of SFO in dimethylformamide with an aqueous solution of the peptide at pH 8; careful control of the pH enhanced coupling of the N-terminal serine to SFO and minimized reactions with the more basic epsilon amino group of the internal lysine. The major isolable product of the reaction, identified as the peptide 1-SFO conjugate by LC/MS/MS (4) (Scheme 1, supplemental materials), was coupled via the terminal serine of the peptide. Minor products were also analyzed by LC/MS/MS. A product ion scan of the precursor m/z 1028 (SFO-SHSNTYYFPKGG+H)+ yielded m/z 505 (SFO-SHSNTYYFPKGG+2H-(NTYYFPKGG))2+, which corresponded to SFO coupled to the terminal serine amine and fragmented between the internal serine and asparagine. Another product ion scan of the precursor m/z 1027 [SHSNTYYFPK(SFO)GG+H]+ yielded m/z 922 (SHSNTYYFPK(SFO)GG+H-(GG, SHSNTYYF))+, which corresponded to SFO attached to lysine with fragmentation between lysine and glycine and between phenylalanine and proline. Aqueous Na2EDTA and phenol/chloroform extraction (38Jalal M.A. F. Kim J.L. van der Helm D. J. Org. Chem. 1985; 50: 5642-5645Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) yielded the desferri-conjugate (5) (Scheme 1, supplemental materials) as a white powder; the molecular ion peak corresponded to the predicted molecular mass for the desferri-conjugate. The strategy for identifying peptides that modulate ferritin pore function was as follows. (i) Search a combinatorial peptide library for ferritin binding peptides. (ii) Analyze the effects of the identified peptides on rates of transferring Fe from the ferritin mineral inside the protein nanocage to a chelator outside the nanocage by monitoring the formation of the colored, chelator complexes outside the protein cage, Fe2+-bipyridyl or Fe3+-DFO, as described previously (13Takagi H. Kim D. Ha Y. Allewell N.M. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18685-18688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 14Jin W. Kim H. Pancorbo N.M. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7525-7532Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 15Liu X. Kim W. Theil E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3653-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Properties of the reactions include multiphasic kinetics (Fig. 1) and reductant dependence (24Jones T. Kim R. Walsh C. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4011-4017Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Five consensus peptide sequences were obtained from the peptides selected for WT ferritin binding. Each of the five peptide sequences represented convergence among the in silico translation products of multiple DNA sequences obtained after four rounds of selection and phage amplification; there was no change in the numbers of phage selected between rounds three and four. The peptides identified represent two groups obtained by elution of phage-displaying peptides bound to WT ferritin (Fig. 1). Group A phage were eluted with unfolded pore protein, ferritin L134P (13Takagi H. Kim D. Ha Y. Allewell N.M. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18685-18688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Group B phage peptide elution used WT ferritin, after removing Group A peptides. The five consensus peptide sequences identified by in silico translation of the DNA sequences obtained correspond to those in a large number of open reading frames from the human genome. However, examining the possible interactions of such a large number of proteins with ferritin is currently impractical. Group A sequences (n = 600) encoded two consensus sequences: peptides 1-NTYYFPK and 2-SHTSPSI. Group B sequences (n = 400) encoded three consensus sequences: peptides 3-GDWYLGD, 4-HHALDGS, and 5-HHALGGS. Peptide 1 increased the rate of WT ferritin demineralization 3.3-fold (Fig. 1), suggesting that the pores were unfolded as they were with 1 mm urea or by 0.1 mm guanidine (15Liu X. Kim W. Theil E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3653-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) or by replacement of conserved, amino acids around the pores that influenced pore gating (14Jin W. Kim H. Pancorbo N.M. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7525-7532Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The peptide had no effect on Fe mineralization rates when added to the unmineralized protein cage. Three of the peptides, peptide 2 in Group A and peptides 3 and 5 in Group B, had no effect on rates of formation of Fe2+-bipyridyl, indicating that binding to ferritin did not disrupt normal pore structure. Peptide 4 in Group B, in contrast to peptide 1 in Group A, decreased the rate significantly, by 63% (p < 0.001). Interaction of peptide 4 with ferritin might influence pore unfolding and/or reductant access to the ferric mineral or might induce conformational changes elsewhere. Peptide 1, NTYYFPK, is very hydrophobic and could, by altering native pore structure, model a regulatory protein in vivo that functions during Fe deficiency. Peptide 4, HHALDGS, could bind to negatively charged Glu and Asp residues around the pore (2Liu X. Kim E.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 2005; 38: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 39Chasteen N.D. Kim P.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 126: 182-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar) and could effectively clamp the pore shut and be a model for cellular proteins that lead to the observed retention of mineralized Fe in ferritin during inflammation. By diminishing the Fe available for reactions with oxidants, such a peptide would have anti-inflammatory properties in vivo. Effects of temperature on the rate of Fe demineralization depend on protein structure; they are independent of the mineral/solution transition or the chelator. For example, lowering the temperature decreased the rate for both the WT type ferritin and the pore mutant protein, L134P, at any temperature. However, when WT and L134P proteins were compared under the same conditions of mineralization and mineral dissolution, the Fe exit rate was always faster for ferritin with unfolded pores than the wild type. For the Arrhenius plot, over the temperatures 10–45 °C, E‡ = 88.5 ± 2.3 kJ/mole for WT protein and 77.4 ± 2.1 kJ/mole for H-L134P. (Note that no ferritin pore mutant studied to date altered the melting temperature of the protein nanocages (15Liu X. Kim W. Theil E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3653-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar).) When peptide 1 was complexed with WT ferritin, E‡ = 79.8 ± 2.6 kJ/mole, a value comparable with H-L134P that indicates induced pore unfolding by peptide 1 equivalent to the pore gate mutation. Such data and the composition of peptide 1 (Fig. 1) suggest disruption of helix-helix interactions around the pore, similar to the disruption of the Leu-110-Leu-134 interaction caused by L134P substitution. In analogy to antisense RNA, which alters the structure of RNA, peptide 1 is an “antisense peptide.” To determine the effect of a different chelator on Fe demineralization rates, we chose DFO, an Fe3+ chelator in common use 5Bipyridyl toxicity precludes the use of bipyridyl in vivo. in vivo (40Vichinsky E.P. Semin. Hematol. 2001; 38: 2-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). When the rates for Fe2+-bipyridyl and Fe3+-DFO reporters were compared (Figs. 1 and 2), peptide 1 increased the Fe exit rate from WT ferritin significantly (p < 0.001) with either chelator. Moreover, peptide 1 had no effect on L134P (Fig. 2), where the pores were already unfolded, eliminating the possibility of chelator side reactions. However, the effect of peptide 1 was smaller with Fe3+-DFO than with Fe2+-bipyridyl for WT ferritin, where peptide 1 induced rates that were comparable with L134P (Figs. 1 and 2). We reasoned that competition for Fe2+ during oxidation from Fe2+-DFO to Fe3+-DFO could explain the difference in effects of peptide 1 with the two reporters. Such a competing reaction is Fe2+ entry into the protein cage and binding at the ferroxidase site. (The stability constants for Fe2+-DFO differ from Fe2+-bipyridyl and Fe3+-DFO more than 107 (41Farkas E. Kim E.A. Zekany L. Deak G. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2001; 83: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).) Fe2+ reentry could also contribute to the very slow removal rates of Fe observed with DFO in vivo (40Vichinsky E.P. Semin. Hematol. 2001; 38: 2-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We then determined the effect of increasing local DFO concentrations around the pore by tethering DFO to peptide 1; the strategy should minimize competing reactions. To conjugate DFO to peptide 1, we used a succinyl-serine link (Fig. 2) (see “Experimental Procedures” and Scheme 1 in the supplemental materials for synthesis steps). Availability of the conjugate, pc-1, required use at 0.11 mm to permit examination of experimental variability. Since the mineralized Fe concentration was 0.99 mm and since the reactions with and without free peptide used 2.5 mm DFO, the same concentration of DFO was included in the reaction mixture with pc-1 to trap Fe released from the pc1-DFO conjugate before oxidation. The rates for WT, WT + peptide 1, WT pc-1, L134P, L134P + peptide 1, L134P + pc-1, respectively, were 0.28 ± 0.04, 0.93 ± 0.26, 2.33 ± 0.17, 2.49 ± 0.11, 2.22 ± 0.31, and 2.24 ± 0.19 (Fig. 2). Such data show that increasing the local concentration of chelator around the ferritin pores facilitates formation of the Fe3+-DFO complex with a rate equivalent to L134P, for which the rate was unaltered by added peptide or peptide-DFO conjugate. The complexity of the Fe exit pathway in ferritin revealed here indicates either that Fe reentry occurs regularly for a small fraction of Fe ions leaving the mineral or that in vivo, Fe chaperones stably complex the Fe2+ ions exiting from ferritin, preventing reentry. The two peptides that had opposite functional effects (Fig. 1) on rates of removing Fe from the mineral inside the ferritin nanocage to chelators on the outside, identified from a combinatorial, heptapeptide library, have pharmacological potential either as an antioxidant (peptide 4) or, when conjugated to DFO (peptide 1), as an improved chelator in sickle cell disease or thalassemia. The peptides might also model in vivo regulation of ferritin pore function. For example, holding the ferritin pores closed (peptide 4, Fig. 1) when little or no Fe is needed to synthesize Fe proteins would minimize consumption of cellular reductants and escape of redox active Fe. On the other hand, opening the ferritin pores (peptide 1, Fig. 1) when Fe is needed to synthesize Fe proteins would increase mineral reduction and transport of Fe from the mineral through the ferritin nanocage to sites of protein synthesis. Finally, since ferritin pores are studied in situ, i.e. in the protein nanocage that is stable in solution, they contrast with other pores that are studied in synthetic bilayers where conformational modification can occur (42Duong-Ly K.C. Kim V. Degrado W.F. Howard K.P. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 856-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, the peptide-pore interactions in ferritin can model the function of other protein pores in ion channel proteins. We gratefully acknowledge Dr. M. Joyce and Dr. W.

https://openalex.org/W2041882637,"Primary visual cortex recombines inputs from magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P) streams to create functionally specialized outputs. Understanding these input-output relationships is complicated by the fact that layer 4B, which provides outputs to dorsal visual areas, contains multiple cell types. Using a modified rabies virus that expresses green fluorescent protein, we show that layer 4B neurons projecting to MT are a majority spiny stellate, whereas those projecting to V2 are overwhelmingly pyramidal. Regardless of cell type, MT-projecting neurons have larger cell bodies, more dendritic length, and are deeper within layer 4B. Furthermore, MT-projecting pyramidal neurons are located preferentially underneath cytochrome oxidase blobs, indicating that MT-projecting neurons of both types restrict their dendrites to M-recipient zones. We conclude that MT-projecting layer 4B neurons are specialized for the fast transmission of information from the M pathway, while V2-projecting neurons are likely to mediate slower computations involving mixed M and P signals."
https://openalex.org/W2063704442,"The S1P1 receptor, on the surface of lymphocytes and endothelial cells, regulates the unique trafficking behavior of certain lymphocyte populations. We have examined whether the S1P1 receptor also dictates the distinctive tissue distribution of V alpha14-J alpha18 natural killer T (NKT) cells, whose trafficking pattern is not well understood. Mice (TCS1P1 KO) were established with a conditional deletion of the S1P1 receptor in thymocytes that included precursors of NKT cells. Within the thymus, NKT cells were found at normal or increased levels, indicating that S1P1 receptor expression was dispensable for NKT cell development. However, substantially reduced numbers of NKT cells were detected in the peripheral tissues of the TCS1P1 KO mice. Short-term S1P1 deletion after NKT cells had established residence in the periphery did not substantially alter their distribution in tissues, except for a partial decrease in the spleen. FTY720, a S1P1 receptor ligand that has potent effects on the trafficking of conventional T cells, did not alter the preexisting distribution of NKT cells within peripheral tissues of wild-type mice. Our results indicate that the S1P1 receptor expression on NKT cells is dispensable for development within thymus but is essential for the establishment of their tissue residency in the periphery."
https://openalex.org/W2024933743,"Accumulation of specific proteins at synaptic structures is essential for synapse assembly and function, but mechanisms regulating local protein enrichment remain poorly understood. At the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), subsynaptic nuclei underlie motor axon terminals within extrafusal muscle fibers and are transcriptionally distinct from neighboring nuclei. In this study, we show that expression of the ETS transcription factor Erm is highly concentrated at subsynaptic nuclei, and its mutation in mice leads to severe downregulation of many genes with normally enriched subsynaptic expression. Erm mutant mice display an expansion of the muscle central domain in which acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clusters accumulate, show gradual fragmentation of AChR clusters, and exhibit symptoms of muscle weakness mimicking congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS). Together, our findings define Erm as an upstream regulator of a transcriptional program selective to subsynaptic nuclei at the NMJ and underscore the importance of transcriptional control of local synaptic protein accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2091081637,"Endothelial cell apoptosis is associated with vascular injury and predisposes to atherogenesis. Endothelial cells express anti-apoptotic genes including Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and survivin, which also contribute to angiogenesis and vascular remodeling. We report a central role for protein kinase Cε (PKCε) in the regulation of Bcl-2 expression and cytoprotection of human vascular endothelium against apoptosis. Using myristoylated inhibitory peptides, a predominant role for PKCε in vascular endothelial growth factor-mediated endothelial resistance to apoptosis was revealed. Immunoblotting of endothelial cells infected with an adenovirus expressing a constitutively active form of PKCε (Adv-PKCε-CA) or control Adv-β-galactosidase demonstrated a 3-fold, PKCε-dependent increase in Bcl-2 expression, with no significant change in Bcl-XL, Bad, Bak, or Bax. The induction of Bcl-2 inhibited apoptosis induced by serum starvation or etoposide, and PKCε activation attenuated etoposide-induced caspase-3 cleavage. The functional role of Bcl-2 was confirmed with Bcl-2 antagonist HA-14-1. Inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase attenuated vascular endothelial growth factor-induced protection against apoptosis, and this was rescued by overexpression of constitutively active PKCε, suggesting PKCε acts downstream of phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated a physical interaction between PKCε and Akt, which resulted in formation of a signaling complex, leading to optimal induction of Bcl-2. This study reveals a pivotal role for PKCε in endothelial cell cytoprotection against apoptosis. We demonstrate that PKCε forms a signaling complex and acts co-operatively with Akt to protect human vascular endothelial cells against apoptosis through induction of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and inhibition of caspase-3 cleavage. Endothelial cell apoptosis is associated with vascular injury and predisposes to atherogenesis. Endothelial cells express anti-apoptotic genes including Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and survivin, which also contribute to angiogenesis and vascular remodeling. We report a central role for protein kinase Cε (PKCε) in the regulation of Bcl-2 expression and cytoprotection of human vascular endothelium against apoptosis. Using myristoylated inhibitory peptides, a predominant role for PKCε in vascular endothelial growth factor-mediated endothelial resistance to apoptosis was revealed. Immunoblotting of endothelial cells infected with an adenovirus expressing a constitutively active form of PKCε (Adv-PKCε-CA) or control Adv-β-galactosidase demonstrated a 3-fold, PKCε-dependent increase in Bcl-2 expression, with no significant change in Bcl-XL, Bad, Bak, or Bax. The induction of Bcl-2 inhibited apoptosis induced by serum starvation or etoposide, and PKCε activation attenuated etoposide-induced caspase-3 cleavage. The functional role of Bcl-2 was confirmed with Bcl-2 antagonist HA-14-1. Inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase attenuated vascular endothelial growth factor-induced protection against apoptosis, and this was rescued by overexpression of constitutively active PKCε, suggesting PKCε acts downstream of phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated a physical interaction between PKCε and Akt, which resulted in formation of a signaling complex, leading to optimal induction of Bcl-2. This study reveals a pivotal role for PKCε in endothelial cell cytoprotection against apoptosis. We demonstrate that PKCε forms a signaling complex and acts co-operatively with Akt to protect human vascular endothelial cells against apoptosis through induction of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and inhibition of caspase-3 cleavage. Experimental models suggest that vascular endothelial injury is the earliest detectable event in atherogenesis and that chronic endothelial dysfunction precedes structural lesions (1Lerman A. Kim A.M. Circulation. 2005; 111: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). Endothelial dysfunction is a feature of chronic renal disease, post-transplant vasculopathy (2Cailhier J.F. Kim P. Hebert M.J. Am. J. Transplant. 2006; 6: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), systemic lupus erythematosus, and inflammatory rheumatic diseases (3Haskard D.O. Scand. J. Rheumatol. 2004; 33: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and represents an independent risk factor for accelerated atherosclerosis.

Kim M.R. Clin. Sci. 2004; 107: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Moreover, the observation that aging and exposure to oxidized low density lipoprotein or reactive oxygen species increases EC apoptosis implies a role in the initiation of atherogenesis (5Dimmeler S. Kim J. Zeiher A.M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2002; 13: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Apoptotic EC are themselves pro-thrombotic and release microparticles that may induce EC dysfunction (6Boulanger C.M. Kim A. Ebrahimian T. Henry P. Mathieu E. Tedgui A. Mallat Z. Circulation. 2001; 104: 2649-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) and precipitate thrombosis (7Mallat Z. Kim B. Ohan J. Leseche G. Freyssinet J.M. Tedgui A. Circulation. 1999; 99: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Although considerable progress has been made in identifying the pro-inflammatory pathways involved and in the management of established atherosclerosis, development of disease prevention strategies requires detailed understanding of endogenous mechanisms of endothelial cytoprotection. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) represents a family of multifunctional glycoproteins, which in addition to their fundamental role in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, control endothelial homeostasis through the regulation of survival signals (8Zachary I. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1171-1177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cytoprotective actions of VEGF-A include induction of the anti-apoptotic genes Bcl-2 and A1 (9Gerber H.P. Kim V. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13313-13316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). In addition, VEGF increases endothelial nitric oxide (NO) biosynthesis (10He H.

Lublin D.M. Haskard D.O. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 138-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These mechanisms may contribute to the cytoprotective effects of VEGF in vivo (14Ostendorf T. Kim U. Eitner F. Loos A. Regele H. Kerjaschki D. Henninger D.D. Janjic N. Floege J. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 913-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), and their importance may be reflected in the side effects associated with the anti-VEGF-A monoclonal Ab bevacizumab therapy, including hypertension and thrombosis (15Hurwitz H. Kim S. Semin. Oncol. 2006; 33: S26-S34Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of phospholipid-dependent serine/threonine kinases, divided on the basis of their structure and response to phosphatidylserine, calcium, and diacylglycerol, into classical (cPKCα, -βI, -βII, -γ), novel (nPKCδ, -ε, -η, -θ), and atypical (aPKCζ and λ/ι) isozymes, with PKCμ/PKD forming a distinct fourth group (16Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2005; 165: 2353-2364Google Scholar). The presence of multiple, highly conserved PKC isozymes suggests they have distinct roles, a hypothesis supported by emerging data from the study of PKC isozyme-deficient mice, which while revealing essential functions for individual isozymes, also suggests the presence of functional redundancy (for review, see Ref. 17Parker P.J. Kim J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 131-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). PKC isozymes demonstrate a cell-type and stimulus-specific influence on apoptosis, with classical isozymes PKCα and βI/II reported to be both pro- and anti-apoptotic and the atypical isozymes PKCζ and -λ/ι predominantly anti-apoptotic (for review, see Ref. 18Gutcher I. Kim P.R. Anderson N.G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1061-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The novel isozymes PKCδ and PKCε typically exert opposite effects (19Heidkamp M.C. Kim A.L. Martin J.L. Samarel A.M. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 882-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 20Murriel C.L. Kim D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 420: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). PKCδ has been implicated in the initiation of apoptosis (19Heidkamp M.C. Kim A.L. Martin J.L. Samarel A.M. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 882-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) at the level of the mitochondria (21Li L. Kim P.S. Bogi K. Blumberg P.M. Yuspa S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8547-8558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in its amplification through interactions with caspase-3 (18Gutcher I. Kim P.R. Anderson N.G. Cell. Mol.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6148-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). In contrast, PKCε is an important cell survival factor and may act as an oncogene (23Cacace A.M. Kim S.N. Krauss R.S. Fabbro D. Weinstein I.B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2095-2104PubMed Google Scholar). PKCε is anti-apoptotic, promoting survival of interleukin-3-dependent human myeloid (24Gubina E. Kim M.S. Szallasi Z. Blumberg P.M. Mufson R.A. Blood. 1998; 91: 823-829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Jurkat (25Bertolotto C. Kim L. Filippa N. Baier G. Auberger P. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 7301-7309Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of PKCε correlates with resistance to chemotherapy and metastasis in prostate and breast carcinomas (27Wu D. Kim T.L. Gregory C.W. McJilton M.A. Wescott G.G. Ford O.H. Alvey R.F. Mohler J.L. Terrian D.M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2423-2429PubMed Google Scholar, 28Pan Q. Kim L.W. Kleer C.G. Sabel M.S. Griffith K.A. Teknos T.N. Merajver S.D. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8366-8371Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In vivo studies have demonstrated that during ischemic pre-conditioning, activation of PKCε in cardiomyocytes protects against apoptosis (29Ping P. Kim J. Qiu Y. Tang X.L. Manchikalapudi S. Cao X.

Despite its potential, the role of PKCε in EC survival and resistance to vascular injury remains relatively unexplored. VEGF activates PKCε in vascular EC (33Wu L.W. Kim L.D. Dunbar J.D. Kessler K.M.

Wheeler-Jones C. Zachary I. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and using the complement regulatory protein decay-accelerating factor as a VEGF target gene, we have previously identified PKCε as a regulator of EC resistance to complement-mediated injury (35Mason J.C. Kim R. Lidington E.A. Kinderlerer A.R. Ohba M. Haskard D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41611-41618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Herein we have investigated the hypothesis that PKCε plays a pivotal role in the regulation of VEGF-activated effector mechanisms against vascular endothelial injury. We demonstrate that PKCε acts downstream of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI-3K) and forms a signaling complex with Akt, acting co-dependently to protect primary human vascular EC against apoptosis through induction of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and inhibition of caspase-3 cleavage. Reagents—Antibodies used were: anti-PKCε from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-ICAM-2 from BD Biosciences, and anti-phospho-PKCε (Ser729) from Upstate Ltd (Dundee, UK). Anti-Akt, anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473), and antibodies against Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bad, Bak, and Bax were all from Cell Signaling, (Beverly, MA). Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) was from Sigma-Aldrich. Akt phosphorylation inhibitor IV and etoposide were from Merck, and LY294002 was from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA). HA-14-1 was from Maybridge Chemical Co. (Tintagel, Cornwall, UK). Recombinant human VEGF-A (referred to as VEGF) was purchased from PeproTech EC Ltd (London, UK). Z-VAD-FMK and the Z-FA-FMK negative control peptide were from BD Biosciences. Myristoylated (myr) PKC peptide inhibitors (myr-ΨPKC) (myr-Arg-Phe-Ala-Arg-Lys-Gly-Ala-Leu-Arg-Gln-Lys-Asn-Val) and PKCε V1–2 (myr-Glu-Ala-Val-Ser-Leu-Lys-Pro-Thr) were from Promega (Southampton, UK) and BIOMOL, respectively. Myr-PKCθ (myr-Leu-His-Gln-Arg-Arg-Gly-Ala-Ile-Lys-Gln-Ala-Lys-Val-His-His-Val-Lys-Cys) and myr-PKCζ (myr-Ser-Ile-Tyr-Arg-Arg-Gly-Ala-Arg-Arg-Trp-Arg-Lys-Leu) were from Merck. In all experiments EC monolayers were treated with appropriate vehicle controls. Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein ECs (HUVEC) were isolated and cultured as previously described (36Mason J.C. Kim H. Sugars K. Morgan B.P. Davies K.A. Haskard D.O. Blood. 1999; 94: 1673-1682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The use of human EC was approved by Hammersmith Hospitals Research Ethics Committee (Ref no. 06/Q0406/21). Adenoviral Infection—Generation of adenoviral expression vectors for dominant-negative (DN) and constitutively active (CA) PKC isozymes and Akt has been described previously (19Heidkamp M.C. Kim A.L. Martin J.L. Samarel A.M. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 882-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 37Ohba M. Kim K. Kashiwagi M. Kawabe S. Chida K. Huh N.H. Kuroki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5199-5207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adenoviruses were amplified in human embryonic kidney 293A cells, purified, and titrated as previously described (35Mason J.C. Kim R. Lidington E.A. Kinderlerer A.R. Ohba M. Haskard D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41611-41618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). HUVEC were infected by incubation with adenovirus in serum-free M199 for 2 h at 37 °C. The media were replaced with M199, 10% FBS, and HUVEC were incubated overnight before experimentation. Optimal multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.), expressed as infectious units (ifu) per cell, for each adenovirus was determined by Western blotting. Flow Cytometry—Flow cytometry was performed as previously described (36Mason J.C. Kim H. Sugars K. Morgan B.P. Davies K.A. Haskard D.O. Blood. 1999; 94: 1673-1682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results are expressed as the relative fluorescent intensity, representing mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) with test monoclonal Ab divided by the MFI using an isotype-matched irrelevant mAb. Cell viability was assessed by examination of EC monolayers using phase contrast microscopy, cell counting, and estimation of trypan blue exclusion. For intracellular flow cytometry, EC were fixed in 2% formaldehyde and permeabilized in 90% methanol. Primary antibody was added in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% bovine serum albumin and detected with an appropriate fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody. Quantitative Real-time PCR—Quantitative RT-PCR was carried out using an iCycler (Bio-Rad). DNase-1-digested total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed using 1 μm oligo-dT and Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was amplified in a 25-μl reaction containing 5 μl of cDNA template, 12.5 μl of iSYBR supermix (Bio-Rad), and 0.5 pm sense and 0.5 pm antisense gene-specific primers. The volume was adjusted to 25 μl with double-distilled H2O. The primer sequences used were as follows: Bcl-2 forward 5′-GTCATGTGTGTGGAGAGCGT-3′, reverse 5′-GCCGTACAGTTCCACAAAGG-3′; tubulin forward 5′-TCTGTTCGCTCAGGTCCTTT-3′, tubulin reverse 5′-TTCATGATGCGATCAGGGTA-3′. The cycling parameters were 3 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 20 s. Western Blotting—Immunoblotting was performed as described (35Mason J.C. Kim R. Lidington E.A. Kinderlerer A.R. Ohba M. Haskard D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41611-41618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Membrane fractions were isolated using the ProteoExtract kit (Merck) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Immunoblots were probed with primary Abs overnight at 4 °C followed by appropriate secondary reagents for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoblots were developed with a chemiluminescence substrate (Amersham Biosciences). To ensure equivalent sample loading, protein content was determined using the Bio-Rad Dc protein assay (Bio-Rad), and membranes were stripped and re-probed with a control antibody. Integrated density values were obtained with an Alpha Innotech Chemi-Imager 5500 (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). Cell Survival, Proliferation, and Apoptosis Assays—EC apoptosis was induced by serum starvation (0.1% FBS for 24 h) or treatment with etoposide (50–150 μm). Analysis of EC survival and proliferation was performed using the Promega Cell-Titer96 [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium] (MTS) assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The assay was quantified by recording absorbance (490 nm) using a 96-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (Dynex Technologies, Worthing, UK). Percent cell death was calculated as follows: % cell death = 100 - (absorbance test/absorbance control × 100), where control represents EC cultured in M199, 20% FBS alone for the duration of the experiment. For the assessment of EC apoptosis, cell culture supernatant was collected, and apoptotic EC were pelleted by centrifugation and added to EC harvested by trypsinization. EC were fixed in 70% ethanol, washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, 50 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 units/ml RNase, and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide before analysis by flow cytometry. Apoptotic cells were identified as those falling within the sub-G1 gate and expressed as a percentage of total cells. Apoptosis was also quantified by nuclear staining of adherent EC with Hoechst 33342 dye (Sigma) and by intracellular flow-cytometric analysis of cleaved caspase-3 using an antibody specific for the cleaved fragment (Cell Signaling). Immunoprecipitation—HUVEC were lysed in 1% Nonidet P40, 20 mm Tris (pH 8), 130 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3V04, 4 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5% protease inhibitor (Sigma). After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm, lysates were pre-cleared with 50 μl of anti-rabbit Ig immunoprecipitation beads (eBioscience, San Diego, CA). After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm, supernatants were incubated with anti-PKCε or control antibody for 1 h at 4 °C before the addition of 50 μl of immunoprecipitation beads and incubation for 2 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 3000 rpm, protein-bound beads were washed 4 times in 1 ml of lysis buffer and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, boiled, and run on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels before to a nitrocellulose membrane and analysis by Western blotting. Statistical Analysis—Data were expressed as the mean of the individual experiments ±S.E. Data were grouped according to treatment and analyzed using the analysis of variance with Bonferroni multiple comparison test or an unpaired Students t test (GraphPad Prism 4.0 software, San Diego, CA). Differences were considered significant at p values of <0.05. PKC Activation Protects EC against Serum Starvation—The PKC family of isozymes plays an important role in the regulation of cell survival. Using a model of serum starvation in which HUVEC were cultured for 24 h in medium containing 0.1% FBS, we observed an increase in cell death of 50% when compared with the same cells cultured in 20% FBS. Pretreatment of HUVEC with PKC agonists PDBu and VEGF significantly reduced serum starvation-induced cell death (Fig. 1A). The role of PKC in this response was suggested by abrogation of both PDBu- and VEGF-mediated cytoprotection in the presence of GF109203X, an inhibitor of classical and novel PKC isozymes (38Toullec D. Kim P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhame L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of note, trypan blue exclusion demonstrated 5–10% cell death in control EC cultured in 20% FBS (not shown). Thus, although VEGF and PDBu are able to significantly reduce the deleterious effects of serum starvation on EC, they do not protect completely. We have previously reported that VEGF-induced EC protection against complement activation is dependent upon PKCα and PKCε (35Mason J.C. Kim R. Lidington E.A. Kinderlerer A.R. Ohba M. Haskard D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41611-41618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recognizing that in addition to PKC isozymes, GF109203X may inhibit MAPKAP-K1/RSK and MSK1 (39Davies S.P. Kim H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3945) Google Scholar), we used cell-permeable myristoylated inhibitory peptides against PKCα and PKCε to investigate the role of these isozymes in protection against apoptosis. Blockade of PKCε increased the susceptibility of HUVEC to serum starvation, whereas the PKCα inhibitory peptide had no significant effect (Fig. 1B). Likewise, inhibition of PKCε, but not PKCα, significantly reversed the protective effect of both VEGF (Fig. 1C) and PDBu (not shown), suggesting that activation of PKCε exerts an anti-apoptotic effect in human vascular EC. As with myr-PKCα, myr-PKCθ and myr-PKCζ had no inhibitory effect on VEGF-mediated protection against serum starvation (not shown). PKCε Overexpression in EC Protects against Apoptosis—To assess the effect of PKCε overexpression on EC survival, HUVEC were cultured for 24 h in endothelial cell growth factor-free HUVEC medium containing either 20 or 0.1% FBS. Serum starvation resulted in 50% cell death (Fig. 2A). Infection of EC with CA-PKCε Adv 24 h before serum withdrawal demonstrated a dose-dependent cytoprotective effect, maximal at an m.o.i. of 20–50 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the control β-galactosidase Adv was not protective, although at an m.o.i. of 10 and 20 β-galactosidase expression reduced serum starvation-induced cell death to a level that did not quite reach significance (Fig. 2A). This response may reflect a previously reported pro-survival action of adenoviral transfection per se (40Ramalingam R. Kim S. Worgall S. Brough D.E. Crystal R.G. Blood. 1999; 93: 2936-2944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An MTS cell proliferation and survival assay was used to exclude a role for EC proliferation in the protective effect observed after PKCε overexpression. Subconfluent HUVEC were plated in endothelial cell growth factor-free HUVEC medium containing 5% FBS and subsequently infected with CA-PKCε Adv (m.o.i. 10–25), β-galactosidase Adv, and GFP control Adv (m.o.i. 25). When compared with EC cultures in HUVEC medium alone, endothelial cell growth factor treatment increased the total EC count over 24 h, whereas no significant change was seen after infection with CA-PKCε Adv or control Adv (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that EC proliferation plays no significant part in PKCε-mediated cytoprotection against serum starvation. We next sought to demonstrate that the effect of PKCε activation on EC survival was the consequence of protection against apoptosis using an etoposide-induced model of apoptosis. HUVEC were infected with CA-PKCε or β-galactosidase control Adv and treated 24 h later with etoposide for 16 h. As seen in Fig. 2C, nuclear staining with Hoechst 33342 of β-galactosidase control Adv-infected EC treated with etoposide revealed numerous apoptotic cells, identified by characteristic DNA bright nuclear condensation and fragmentation. In contrast, overexpression of CA-PKCε protected EC against apoptosis, with few apoptotic cells detected (Fig. 2D). Quantification of three separate experiments revealed a significant reduction in apoptosis in PKCε overexpressing EC (Fig. 2E). Likewise, propidium iodide staining of fixed and permeabilized EC followed by flow-cytometric analysis and quantification of sub-G1 DNA as a measure of apoptosis demonstrated a significant cytoprotective effect of CA-PKCε against etoposide-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2F). PKCε Activation Increases EC Bcl-2 Expression—In light of evidence that exogenous stimuli such as VEGF, laminar shear stress, and integrin ligation activate PKCε (34Gliki G. Kim R. Jezequl S.

Initial immunoblotting experiments revealed a dose-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of PKCε after infection with CA-PKCε-Adv (Fig. 3A) and determined the optimal m.o.i. of 20–50 ifu/cell for the CA-PKCε-Adv. CA-PKCε specifically increased expression of PKCε but had no effect on PKCα, -δ, or -ζ protein levels (not shown). Furthermore, overexpression of CA-PKCε resulted in a parallel increase in the expression of Bcl-2, whereas the β-galactosidase-expressing control adenovirus failed to phosphorylate PKCε or induce Bcl-2 (Fig. 3A). The specificity of the PKCε-mediated effect was demonstrated by comparing overexpression of CA-PKCε and CA-PKCδ, in which only the former induced Bcl-2 (Fig. 3B). Subsequent experiments demonstrated that the induction of Bcl-2 was sustained up to 48 h post-infection with CA-PKCε Adv (Fig. 3C). Immunoblotting was also used to explore the effect of PKCε activation on other pro- and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. As seen in Fig. 3D and in contrast to Bcl-2 itself, no significant change in the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-XL or pro-apoptotic Bad, Bak, or Bax was seen at 24 h post-infection of HUVEC with CA-PKCε-Adv when compared with β-galactosidase Adv. This suggests that, at least in human vascular EC, activation of PKCε is specifically associated with induction of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. The role of PKCε-induced Bcl-2 in the anti-apoptotic effect observed was investigated further using HA-14-1, a functional antagonist of Bcl-2 (46Wang J.L. Kim D. Zhang Z.J. Shan S. Han X.

https://openalex.org/W2058025950,"Organelle transport in neuronal processes is central to the organization, developmental fate, and functions of neurons. Organelles must be transported through the slender, highly branched neuronal processes, making the axonal transport vulnerable to any perturbation. However, some intracellular structures like mitochondria are able to considerably modify their volume. We therefore hypothesized that swollen mitochondria could impair the traffic of other organelles in neurite shafts. To test this hypothesis, we have investigated the effects of mitochondrial swellers on the organelle traffic. Our data demonstrate that treatment of neurons with potassium ionophore valinomycin led to the fast time-dependent inhibition of organelle movement in cerebellar granule neurons. Similar inhibition was observed in neurons treated with the inhibitors of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, sodium azide and antimycin, which also induced swelling. No decrease in the motility of organelles was observed in cultures treated with inhibitors of ATP production or transport, oligomycin or bongkrekic acid, suggesting that inhibition of the ATP-generating activity itself without swelling does not affect the motility of organelles. The effect of swellers on the traffic was more important in thin processes, thus indicating the role of steric hindrance of swollen mitochondria.

We propose that the size and morphology of the transported cargo is also relevant for seamless axonal transport and speculate that mitochondrial swelling could be one of the reasons for impaired organelle transport in neuronal processes. Organelle transport in neuronal processes is essential for neuron viability and function. Organelles move along microtubule and microfilament tracks powered by molecular motor proteins; plus-end-directed kinesin carries organelles anterogradely, whereas dynein propels them retrogradely. Golgi-derived transport vesicles, endocytotic vesicles, lysosomes, and autophagosomes move at maximal rates of 1-5 μm/s, whereas mitochondria move at maximal rates of 0.3-0.7 μm/s (1Brown A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 817-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Axonal transport of mitochondria and lysosomes is bidirectional, sharing the same tracks and motor proteins (2Tanaka Y. Kanai Y. Okada Y. Nonaka S. Takeda S. Harada A. Hirokawa N. Cell. 1998; 93: 1147-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Organelles must be transported through the slender, highly branched neuronal processes; the axonal shafts between the varicosities are extremely thin, with an average diameter around 200-300 nm (3Benquet P. Le Guen J. Pichon Y. Tiaho F. J. Neurophysiol. 2002; 88: 1475-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 4Shepherd G.M. Harris K.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8300-8310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), matching exactly with the size of the most sizable organelles, mitochondria and lysosomes (5Kaasik A. Safiulina D. Zharkovsky A. Veksler V. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: C157-C163Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 6Safiulina D. Veksler V. Zharkovsky A. Kaasik A. J. Cell Physiol. 2006; 206: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). All these factors make axonal transport vulnerable to any perturbation that could lead to axonal traffic jams and axonal degeneration and cause neuronal dysfunction (7Gunawardena S. Goldstein L.S. J. Neurobiol. 2004; 58: 258-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Axonal transport of organelles seems to be a highly orchestrated and well coordinated process, and under physiological conditions, the organelles could move and cross each other without difficulties (8Vanden Berghe P. Hennig G.W. Smith T.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: G671-G682Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, several lines of evidence suggest that the axonal traffic becomes compromised when the size of cargo increases or the axonal diameter decreases. Defects in axonal transport have been indirectly linked to a number of progressive human neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer disease, Huntington disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. All these diseases are characterized by perturbed axonal transport that could be related to accumulation of proteins within axons. On the other hand, Shaw and Goldstein's group (9Shah S.B. Goldstein L.S.B. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 400AGoogle Scholar) has demonstrated dramatic impairment of mitochondrial transport in the neurites after internalization of fluorescent beads with diameters between 200 and 500 nm. In recent reports (5Kaasik A. Safiulina D. Zharkovsky A. Veksler V. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: C157-C163Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 6Safiulina D. Veksler V. Zharkovsky A. Kaasik A. J. Cell Physiol. 2006; 206: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated that mitochondrial swelling, induced either by mitochondrial depolarization or by opening of KATP channels, leads to a dramatic increase in the diameters of neuronal mitochondria (ranging between 300 and 800 nm). This raises a possibility that in living cells, various conditions affecting mitochondrial homeostasis are able to modify the geometry of these organelles. We therefore hypothesized that swollen mitochondria could impair the traffic of other organelles in neurite shafts. To test this hypothesis, we have investigated the effects of mitochondrial swellers on the organelle traffic. The results obtained show that increase in mitochondrial volume is associated with a marked drop in the motility of mitochondria themselves and also impair the motility of lysosomes. Sample Preparation—Primary cultures of cerebellar granule neurons were prepared according to the method of Gallo et al. (26Gallo V. Ciotti M.T. Coletti A. Aloisi F. Levi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7919-7923Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Briefly, the cerebelli from 8-day-old Wistar rat pups were dissociated by mild trypsinization (0.25% trypsin at 35 °C for 15 min) followed by trituration in a 0.004% DNase solution containing 0.05% soybean trypsin inhibitor. The cells were resuspended in Eagle's basal medium with Earle's salts containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 25 mm KCl, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 μg/ml gentamycin. The cell suspension was plated at a density of 1.0 × 106 cells/ml on poly-l-lysine-coated LabTek II chambered cover-glass (0.3 ml/chamber; Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) or at a density of 1.25 × 106 cells/ml on poly-l-lysine-coated MatTek glass bottom culture dishes (2 ml; MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA). 10 μm cytosine arabinoside was added 24 h after plating to prevent the proliferation of glial cells. The cells were cultured for 5-7 days in a humidified 5% CO2/95% air at 37 °C. Staining and Transfection—For mitochondrial tracking, intact neurons were loaded for 30 min at 37 °C with 100 nm MitoTracker Green or 200 nm MitoTracker Red in culture medium. To stain the cytoplasm, intact neurons were loaded for 30 min with 5 μm CellTracker Green 5-chloromethyl-fluorescein diacetate at 37 °C in Lockey's solution that was replaced with conditioned medium after staining and incubated for a further 30 min before microscopy. For lysosomal staining, the intact cells were loaded for 30 min with 100 nm LysoTracker Red in culture medium. All dyes were purchased from Invitrogen. In another set of experiments, the cerebellar neurons were transiently transfected on second day in vitro using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 100 μl of OPTI-MEM® (Invitrogen) containing 2% Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and 1 μg of cytosolic-green fluorescent protein DNA (Clontech) mixed with either 1 μg of DNA for Lamp1-RFP 2The abbreviation used is: RPF, red fluorescent protein. (Addgene, PubMed Identifier: 14617360) or mitochondria-targeted pDsRed2 (mtDsRed2, Clontech) was incubated with ∼105 cells in glass bottom microwell dishes (MatTek) for 4 h at 37 °C. On completion of incubation conditioned culture medium (Eagle's basal medium, Invitrogen) was added to the cells, and cells were further grown in humidified 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The transfected DNAs were allowed to express and accumulate respective proteins in targeted organelle for 3 days. Three-dimensional Analysis—512 × 512 pixel digital optical sections were acquired by a confocal laser scanning microscope (MRC1024, Bio-Rad) equipped with an Ar-Kr laser (excitation wavelengths 488 and 568 nm) and a 100× oil immersion objective (1.35 numerical aperture, Olympus). Voxels were collected at 15-nm lateral and 100-nm axial intervals. Raw images were deconvolved by the AutoDeblur software package (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD). Isosurface three-dimensional pictures were generated using the AutoVisualize software package (AutoQuant Imaging) after binarizing with a fixed 32% threshold value. Details are given in Safiulina et al. (6Safiulina D. Veksler V. Zharkovsky A. Kaasik A. J. Cell Physiol. 2006; 206: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Quantitative Analysis of Organelle Motility—Organelle motility was measured in intact cultures of cerebellar granule neurons loaded with MitoTracker Green and Lyso-Tracker Red or expressing Lamp1-RFP or mtDsRed2 by time course confocal microscopy. Temperature in the culture medium was kept at 37 °C with a temperature-controlled chamber system, and images were collected using a 40× or 63× spring objective. The pH of culture medium in the chamber was maintained at 7.1 with 20 mm HEPES. Time course analysis was performed using the LaserSharp 2000 software time course option by recording 30 frames with 5-s intervals for one time point. Coordinates of randomly chosen mitochondria were recorded by a computer and were tracked through the time series. Matrices of the data were further processed using a Microsoft Excel macro that calculated the percentage of time spent in motile state, distance of displacement, maximal velocity, average velocity, and average velocity in motile state for each mitochondrion. Statistical Analysis—The data are presented as mean ± S.E. One-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni post hoc test was used for statistical analysis except for data presented in Fig. 4, where the Mann-Whitney test was used. Our first aim was to validate the effect of mitochondrial modulators on mitochondrial morphology. We have shown previously that mitochondrial inhibitors depolarizing mitochondrial inner membrane increase considerably the mitochondrial size, and this is associated with impaired mitochondrial motility (6Safiulina D. Veksler V. Zharkovsky A. Kaasik A. J. Cell Physiol. 2006; 206: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, compounds inducing mitochondrial depolarization and swelling also de-energize mitochondria and inhibit production of ATP, which might also account for the loss of mitochondrial motility. It was therefore not possible to differentiate whether the mitochondrial motility ceased because of mitochondrial swelling or due to decline in cytoplasmic ATP required to power cytoplasmic motor proteins. To distinguish between these effects, we decided to use in current experiments two groups of mitochondrial inhibitors. The first group, valinomycin (induces massive potassium influx into the mitochondrial matrix), antimycin (inhibits ubiquinone-cytochrome c reductase), and high concentrations of sodium azide (inhibits cytochrome c oxidase together with ATP synthetase), ceases the mitochondrial energy supply to cytoplasmic consumers and produces mitochondrial swelling due to dissipation of the mitochondrial potential. The second group of inhibitors, bongkrekic acid (inhibits mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocase, and thus, the ATP transport from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytoplasm), and oligomycin (inhibits the ATP synthetase), inhibits mitochondrial energy supply to cytoplasm but does not induce mitochondrial swelling. As could be seen from Fig. 1, the inhibitors from the first group, valinomycin, azide and antimycin, induced marked mitochondrial swelling associated with increase in mitochondrial diameter from 200-300 to 400-600 nm. On the other hand, the inhibitors belonging to the second class, oligomycin and bongkrekic acid, had no effect on the mitochondrial morphology. Thus, although all inhibitors block the ATP-generating activity of mitochondria, only depolarizers induce mitochondrial swelling. Next question addressed in the study was to know whether the decreased mitochondrial motility in response to mitochondrial depolarization is related to the mitochondrial swelling or to the impaired ATP production. We measured the mitochondrial motility in the presence of these different classes of mitochondrial inhibitors. Valinomycin, antimycin, and azide inhibit almost completely the mitochondrial motility as demonstrated (Fig. 2) by decline in the average velocity (average distance per second traveled during motile and stationary state) as well as by fallen duty percentage (percentage of time in motile state) of individual mitochondria. However, no statistically significant change in these motility parameters was observed when we treated the neurons with bongkrekic acid (25 μm) or oligomycin (50 μm). These results demonstrate that inhibition of mitochondrial energy production per se cannot be the reason for impaired mitochondrial traffic in neuronal processes. The latter event is instead related to mitochondrial morphology modification or mitochondrial membrane potential drop (it cannot be excluded that mitochondrial membrane potential regulates somehow its transportation of this organelle (6Safiulina D. Veksler V. Zharkovsky A. Kaasik A. J. Cell Physiol. 2006; 206: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)). Next, we designed an experiment to test whether the mitochondrial swellers affect the lysosome traffic. Although possibly energy-dependent, the lysosome traffic should be independent on mitochondrial membrane potential itself and could be impaired only in the case when swollen mitochondria block mechanically the lysosome passage. The individual experiment depicted in Fig. 3, A and C, demonstrates that treatment of neurons with valinomycin led to fast, time-dependent inhibition of lysosomal movement within a few minutes as estimated by drop in their average speed and duty percentage. At about 10 min after start of the treatment, the lysosomal movement almost completely ceased. No decrease in motility of lysosomes was observed either in control neurons or in bongkrekic acid-treated neurons at any time point after treatment. Fig. 3, B and D, showing summarized data of independent experiments, demonstrate that compounds inhibiting mitochondrial movement, valinomycin and azide, inhibited lysosomal movement almost completely when measured ∼15 min after the start of the drug treatment. Another mitochondrial inhibitor, antimycin, also inhibited the lysosomal traffic, although not as efficiently as others did. On the other hand, oligomycin (which does not change the mitochondrial geometry), similarly to bongkrekic acid, exerted no inhibitory effect. Rather, on the contrary, lysosomal motility tended to increase in bongkrekic acid-treated neurons. Thus, these data demonstrate that all mitochondrial modulators that induce mitochondrial swelling also inhibit the organelle transport in the processes of granule neurons and that this effect is not directly related to mitochondrial energy production. We confirmed these findings by an additional set of experiments using mtDsRed2-labeled mitochondria and Lamp1-RFP-labeled lysosomes. Fig. 4 demonstrates that these fluorescently labeled organelles respond to mitochondrial sweller valinomycin similarly to MitoTracker Green- or LysoTracker Red-stained organelles. Thus, our previous findings could not be ascribed to the effect of valinomycin on fluorescent intensity. Moreover, in our experiments with Lamp1-RFP-labeled lysosomes, we failed to detect any effect of valinomycin or other swellers on the lysosomal morphology. Several observations from our time lapse imaging of organelles support the “traffic jam” hypothesis. Fig. 5 demonstrates that under valinomycin treatment, lysosomes still move in the thick processes but not in small ones, although initially, the motility was similar. Swollen mitochondria tend to block mitochondrial movement, as shown in the pictures set in Fig. 6, where lysosome is trying to pass rounded mitochondrion but fails and turns back. Note that swollen mitochondria are often localized near lysosomes and that the effect of mitochondrial swelling on lysosome transport is dependent on the diameter of neurites. Fig. 5 shows that average velocity of lysosomes in thin processes is almost stopped when culture is treated with valinomycin, whereas in thick processes, the average is decreased only by about 50% of control value. Thus, these observations suggest that steric hindrance of swollen mitochondria rather than mitochondrial membrane potential itself or energy drop could be the major factor behind the ceased organelle movement.FIGURE 6Depicted time series demonstrating lysosome-mitochondrion interaction. Note the LysoTraker Red-stained lysosome marked with an arrow (panel 0s, lower part), which starts to move and turns back after reaching to a swollen mitochondria in a neuron treated with antimycin (100 μm). Note also the lysosome (panel 0s, upper part) standing aside of swollen mitochondrion.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is well known that mitochondrial dysfunction, due to either environmental or genetic factors, is one of the primary events in several neurodegenerative diseases (10Lin M.T. Beal M.F. Nature. 2006; 443: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (4413) Google Scholar). Oxidative damage and dysfunction of mitochondria occur early in the Alzheimer disease brain, before the onset of significant plaque pathology (11Nunomura A. Perry G. Aliev G. Hirai K. Takeda A. Balraj E.K. Jones P.K. Ghanbari H. Wataya T. Shimohama S. Chiba S. Atwood C.S. Petersen R.B. Smith M.A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2001; 60: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar). In Parkinson disease, several mutations in putative mitochondrial proteins leading to mitochondrial alterations have been described. The most frequent familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is related to mitochondrial damage; overexpression of the respective superoxide dismutase mutation in transgenic mice causes mitochondrial energy metabolism disturbances in brain (12Mattiazzi M. D'Aurelio M. Gajewski C.D. Martushova K. Kiaei M. Beal M.F. Manfredi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29626-29633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In Huntington disease, the mutant huntingtin seems to directly affect mitochondria as well. In general, mitochondrial dysfunction is related to mitochondrial depolarization, calcium accumulation, permeability transition pore opening, e.g. related to conditions that ultimately lead to mitochondrial swelling (5Kaasik A. Safiulina D. Zharkovsky A. Veksler V. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: C157-C163Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it is well known that the length, complexity, and slenderness of neuronal processes coupled with the amount of material that must be transported makes the axonal transport vulnerable to any kind of perturbation. Traffic jams are therefore thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases. The molecular nature of these traffic jams is diverse and could involve transport proteins or aggregates blocking the axons. Recent findings of Goldstein and co-workers (13Stokin G.B. Lillo C. Falzone T.L. Brusch R.G. Rockenstein E. Mount S.L. Raman R. Davies P. Masliah E. Williams D.S. Goldstein L.S. Science. 2005; 307: 1282-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar) suggest that disruption of axonal transport of vesicles, through lesions in APP or APP-interacting components, may result in axonal block and be a causative factor in the development of Alzheimer disease. Mutations in dynactin, a protein required for axonal transport, have been described in patients with motor neuron disease (14Puls I. Jonnakuty C. LaMonte B.H. Holzbaur E.L. Tokito M. Mann E.

Abnormalities in axonal transport have been suspected for some time in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and axonal transport defects have been observed in mouse models expressing mutant forms of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) (15Collard J.F. Cote F. Julien J.P. Nature. 1995; 375: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 16Williamson T.L. Cleveland D.W. Nat.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar); in addition, large axonal swellings with neurofilament accumulations, consistent with a failure in axonal transport, are observed in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (18Munoz D.G. Greene C. Perl D.P. Selkoe D.J. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1988; 47: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 19Rouleau G.A. Clark A.W. Rooke K. Pramatarova A. Krizus A. Suchowersky O. Julien J.P. Figlewicz D. Ann. Neurol. 1996; 39: 128-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Recent data from several models of polyglutamine disease have suggested that abnormalities in axonal transport contribute to this pathology (20Katsuno M. Adachi H. Minamiyama M. Waza M. Tokui K. Banno H. Suzuki K. Onoda Y. Tanaka F. Doyu M. Sobue G. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 12106-12117Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Also, some other pathologies related to oversized and nonfunctional organelles (for example, paraplegia and drug-induced neuropathies) are associated with impaired axonal transport (21Ferreirinha F. Quattrini A. Pirozzi M. Valsecchi V. Dina G. Broccoli V. Auricchio A. Piemonte F. Tozzi G. Gaeta L. Casari G. Ballabio A. Rugarli E.I. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Thus, here we propose that size and morphology of the transported cargo are also relevant for seamless axonal transport, and we speculate that mitochondrial swelling could be one of the reasons for impaired organelle transport in neuronal processes. Current data demonstrate that mitochondrial swellers increasing the diameter and volume of mitochondria inhibit mitochondrial as well as lysosomal traffic; all conditions leading to inhibition of organelle transport in processes also lead to a parallel increase in mitochondrial diameter. In all cases, the mitochondrial diameter increased from around 200 to 400-600 nm, which is larger than the average diameter of processes being around 200-300 nm. We demonstrate clearly that this inhibition is not related to cessation of the mitochondrial ATP production as proposed earlier (6Safiulina D. Veksler V. Zharkovsky A. Kaasik A. J. Cell Physiol. 2006; 206: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 22Miller K.E. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 373-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Rintoul G.L. Filiano A.J. Brocard J.B. Kress G.J. Reynolds I.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7881-7888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); bongkrekic acid and oligomycin, inhibiting ATP transport from the mitochondrial matrix to cytosol and mitochondrial ATP synthetase, respectively, had no effect on mitochondrial or lysosomal traffic. The absence of their effect could be explained by earlier data demonstrating that glycolysis can support the function of cerebellar granule cells in vitro (24Budd S.L. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurosci. 1996; 67: 2282-2291Google Scholar) and by the observations that molecular motors responsible for mitochondrial traffic have relatively high affinity to ATP (25Hollenbeck P.J. Front. Biosci. 1996; 1: d91-d102Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). It is also unlikely that mitochondrial depolarization per se induced by swellers could affect the axonal traffic. Mitochondrial membrane potential could modify the mitochondrial binding to the motor proteins or motor protein activity but not lysosomal traffic directly. It is therefore most tempting to speculate that swollen mitochondria will physically block the passage of other sized organelles in neurites, and thus, inhibit the axonal organelle traffic. Several observations support that hypothesis; swollen mitochondria tend to block mitochondrial movement, and this interaction seemed to be less evident in bigger neurites.

https://openalex.org/W2078105055,"The involvement of the mitogen-activated protein kinase c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase-1 (JNK1) has never been investigated in hemostasis and thrombosis. Using two JNK inhibitors (SP600125 and 6o), we have demonstrated that JNK1 is involved in collagen-induced platelet aggregation dependent on ADP. In these conditions, JNK1 activation requires the coordinated signaling pathways of collagen receptors (α2β1 and glycoprotein (GP)VI) and ADP. In contrast, JNK1 is not required for platelet adhesion on a collagen matrix in static or blood flow conditions (300–1500 s–1) involving collagen receptors (α2β1 and GPVI). Importantly, at 1500 s–1, JNK1 acts on thrombus formation on a collagen matrix dependent on GPIb-von Willebrand factor (vWF) interaction but not ADP receptor activation. This is confirmed by the involvement of JNK1 in shear-induced platelet aggregation at 4000 s–1. We also provide evidence during rolling and adhesion of platelets to vWF that platelet GPIb-vWF interaction triggers αIIbβ3 activation in a JNK1-dependent manner. This was confirmed with a Glanzmann thrombastenic patient lacking αIIbβ3. Finally, in vivo, JNK1 is involved in arterial but not in venular thrombosis in mice. Overall, our in vitro studies define a new role of JNK1 in thrombus formation in flowing blood that is relevant to thrombus development in vivo.

We also provide evidence during rolling and adhesion of platelets to vWF that platelet GPIb-vWF interaction triggers αIIbβ3 activation in a JNK1-dependent manner. This was confirmed with a Glanzmann thrombastenic patient lacking αIIbβ3. Finally, in vivo, JNK1 is involved in arterial but not in venular thrombosis in mice. Overall, our in vitro studies define a new role of JNK1 in thrombus formation in flowing blood that is relevant to thrombus development in vivo. Blood platelets play a key role in hemostasis and thrombosis. At the site of vascular injury, platelets roll and adhere to various components of the subendothelial matrix through a number of adhesive receptors present on the platelet surface. Several mechanisms support the initial adhesion of platelets and their subsequent activation and aggregation into a thrombus (1Nieswandt B. Kim S.P. Blood. 2003; 102: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Collagen is the most thrombogenic component of the subendothelial matrix. It supports firm platelet adhesion mediated by its two major surface receptors, the integrin α2β1 and glycoprotein (GP) 5The abbreviations used are: GP, glycoprotein; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; vWF, von Willebrand factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PPACK, d-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethylketone dihydrochloride; GT, Glanzmann thrombasthenia; SIPA, shear-induced platelet aggregation; ANOVA, analysis of variance; JNK1-P, phosphorylated JNK1.

This interaction is unstable, but firm platelet adhesion and platelet recruitment occur via the interaction of the collagen with its receptors (α2β1 and GPVI) and the interaction of vWF with the integrin αIIbβ3 (6Savage B. Kim F. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are a family of serine/threonine protein kinases that comprises three subgroups: extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), p38, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs) (7Rossomando A.J. Kim D.M. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6940-6943Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Mammalian JNKs were found to be activated by a variety of environmental stresses, inflammatory cytokines, and growth factors (8Guo Y.L. Kim K. Kang B. Yang L.J. Williamson J.R. J. Biol.

Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). JNKs have also been characterized by their ability to phosphorylate regulatory sites in the NH2 terminus of the transcription factor c-Jun (10Hibi M. Kim A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar) and a variety of additional transcription factors such as Elk-1 and ATF-2 (11Cavigelli M. Kim F. Claret F.X. Karin M.

JNK substrates are not limited to transcription factors or nuclear proteins such as the apoptotic proteins Bcl-X(L) or the protein cytoskeleton paxillin (13Huang C. Kim Z. Borchers C.

In platelets, ERK2, p38, and JNK1 are present and activated by various agonists. The involvement of ERK2 and p38 in hemostasis and thrombosis is still a matter of debate. For example, Marshall et al. (15Marshall S.J. Kim Y.A. Auger J.M. Feil R. Hofmann F. Salmon G. Peterson J.T. Burslem F. Watson S.P. Blood. 2004; 103: 2601-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) demonstrated that αIIbβ3 activation was dependent on the Src kinase pathway but not the ERK2 pathway. By contrast, Li et al. (16Li Z. Kim X. Gu M. Feil R. Ye R.D. Eigenthaler M. Hofmann F. Du X. Cell. 2003; 112: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 17Li Z. Kim X. Du X. J. Biol.

Recently, our group demonstrated a critical role for ERK2 in platelet adhesion, in blood flow conditions, and in platelet spreading (18Mazharian A. Kim S. Berrou E. Adam F. Kauskot A. Nurden P.

With other agonists, such as low doses of collagen (20Roger S. Kim M. Habib A. Jandrot-Perrus M. Rosa J.P. Bryckaert M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 556: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) or thrombin (21Falker K. Kim D. Presek P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2004; 92: 114-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), ERK2 is involved in platelet aggregation. In these conditions, ERK2 acts on platelet secretion and activation of myosin light chain kinase (20Roger S. Kim M. Habib A. Jandrot-Perrus M. Rosa J.P. Bryckaert M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 556: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 22Toth-Zsamboki E. Kim C. Cornelissen H. De Vos R. Vermylen J. Hoylaerts M.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6586-6589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), vWF-induced platelet activation (24Canobbio I. Kim S. Sinigaglia F. Balduini C. Torti M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2004; 91: 102-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and procoagulant activity (25Siljander P. Kim R.W. Feijge M.A. Comfurius P. Kos S. Bevers E.M. Heemskerk J.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In vivo, the involvement of MAP kinases is largely unexplored. Recently, in a model of thrombotic occlusion of injured arterioles and venules, P2X1 and ERK2 were reported to be involved in shear stress-controlled thrombosis (26Oury C. Kim K. Hu H. Toth-Zsamboki E. Bryckaert M. Hoylaerts M.F. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2006; 4: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Moreover, in a model of artery carotid injury, p38 was also involved in thrombosis (27Sakurai K. Kim Y. Sudo T. Takuwa Y. Kimura S. Kasuya Y. J. Recept Signal Transduct. Res. 2004; 24: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our group found that JNK1 is present in platelets and down-regulated by αIIbβ3 engagement after thrombin induction (28Bugaud F. Kim F. Levy-Toledano S. Rosa J.P. Bryckaert M. Blood. 1999; 94: 3800-3805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, JNK1 is activated by porcine vWF (29Song S. Kim J. Mody M. Lazarus A.H. Br. J. Haematol. 2000; 109: 851-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and by thrombin (28Bugaud F. Kim F. Levy-Toledano S. Rosa J.P. Bryckaert M. Blood. 1999; 94: 3800-3805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but its role in platelet activation and thrombosis has never been investigated. In this study, we examined the involvement of JNK1 in platelet aggregation induced by collagen and vWF and platelet adhesion in blood flow conditions and in a mouse model of thrombosis. We found that JNK1 was involved in collagen-induced platelet aggregation dependent on ADP. In blood flow conditions, JNK1 was required for thrombus formation but not platelet adhesion over a collagen matrix. Moreover, JNK1 was partially involved in the αIIbβ3-activated pathway required for shear-induced platelet aggregation, for platelet rolling, and for firm adhesion to vWF. Finally, in vivo, JNK1 was found to be involved in a mouse model of arterial thrombosis. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing the involvement of JNK1 in thrombus formation.

Calcein-AM and Alexa Fluor® 488-phalloidin were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The stress-activated protein kinase/JNK assay kit was from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Rose bengal was purchased from Acros Organics (Halluin, France). Antibody to human αIIbβ3/αvβ3 (ReoPro®) was from Lilly (Leiden, The Netherlands). The mAb 6F1 directed against the α2β1 integrin was generously provided by Prof. B. S. Coller (Rockefeller University, New York, NY). The mAb G19H10 that blocks the binding of vWF to GPIb was produced as previously described (31Theilmeier G. Kim T. Remacle C. Collen D. Vermylen J. Hoylaerts M.F. Blood. 1999; 94: 2725-2734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AR-C69931 MX was generously provided by Dr. B. Humphries (Astra Zeneca, UK). Polyclonal antibody directed against the phosphorylated form of JNK1 (JNK1-P) was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Preparation and Fluorescence Labeling of Human Platelets—Venous blood was collected from healthy donors and from a patient with Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) characterized by an absence of αIIbβ3 (32Nurden A.T. Kim D. Kieffer N. McEver R.P. Blood. 1985; 65: 1021-1024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Written informed consent was obtained from all the donors. Platelet-rich plasma was obtained by centrifugation (120 × g for 15 min at 20 °C), and platelets were isolated by differential centrifugation as previously described (20Roger S. Kim M. Habib A. Jandrot-Perrus M. Rosa J.P. Bryckaert M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 556: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The platelet pellet was resuspended in Tyrode’s buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 5 mm NaHCO3, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm glucose). To study platelet adhesion to vWF, platelets in platelet-rich plasma were labeled with 2.5 μm calcein-AM and resuspended at 3 × 105/μl in autologous plasma, whereas erythrocytes were maintained as a packed cell suspension. Reconstituted blood was obtained by gently mixing labeled platelets and erythrocytes at 45% hematocrit just before perfusion. Platelet Aggregation—Platelet aggregations were monitored by measuring light transmission through the stirred suspension of washed platelets at 37 °C using a Chronolog dual-beam aggregometer (Coultronics, Margency, France). The platelets (4 × 105/μl) were preincubated with SP600125 (10 min, 2–10 μm) or with 6o (30 min, 2–10 μm) or Me2SO at 37 °C without stirring. The quantity of Me2SO never exceeded 0.2% (v/v). Platelet aggregation was initiated by adding type I collagen (0.2–10 μg/ml). Aggregation was measured and expressed as the percentage of change in light transmission, with the value for the blank sample (buffer without platelet) set at 100%. Immunoblotting—The samples were subjected to immunoblotting as previously described (33Nadal F. Kim S. Grelac F. Caen J.P. Rosa J.P. Bryckaert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22381-22384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The platelets were lysed in SDS denaturing buffer (50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 μm phenylarsine oxide, 1% SDS, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.4). The proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membranes were incubated with various primary antibodies: anti-JNK1-P (1/5000), anti-c-Jun-P (1/1000), and anti-tubulin (1/4000). Immunoreactive bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (Perbio Science, Brebières, France). JNK1 Activity—JNK1 activity was examined after collagen stimulation in the presence or absence of various concentrations of SP600125 or 6o (5 and 10 μm) or Me2SO. JNK1 activity was measured according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Cell Signaling). Briefly, the platelets (4 × 105/μl) were lysed with cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Immobilized c-Jun fusion protein beads (20 μl) were added in the supernatant and incubated with gentle rocking overnight at 4 °C to pull down JNK. After centrifugation (14,000 × g; 30 s; 4 °C), the pellet was washed twice with cell lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer on ice (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2). The pellet was suspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 200 μm ATP and incubated 30 min at 30 °C. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE according to standard protocols and c-Jun-GST substrate, phosphorylated by JNK1 (c-Jun-P), was detected by Western blotting using specific antibody. Platelet Deposition—Platelet suspension (2 × 105) was preincubated with SP600125 or 6o (10 μm) or Me2SO in the presence or absence of ReoPro® (10 μg/ml) and then plated on type I collagen (50 μg/ml) for 60 min at 20 °C. After three washes, platelet deposition was quantified by an acid phosphatase assay, as previously described (34Lewis J.M. Kim D.A. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1323-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Platelet Perfusion Studies—Platelet adhesion to type I collagen under flow was evaluated using a parallel plate perfusion chamber. Glass coverslips were coated overnight at 4 °C with type I collagen (50 μg/ml). Whole blood, collected into 40 μm PPACK, was perfused for 4 min, using a KD Scientific syringe pump (Fisher) at shear rates of 300 or 1500 s–1 followed by washing in the same conditions. After fixation (4% paraformaldehyde) and permeabilization (0.2% Triton X-100), F-actin of adherent platelets was detected using Alexa Fluor® 488-phalloidin (1/200). Platelet adhesion to vWF under flow was evaluated using glass microcapillary tubes (Fiber Optic Center, New Bedford, MA). Microcapillary tubes were coated overnight at 4 °C with purified vWF (20 μg/ml). Reconstituted blood was drawn through the coated glass microcapillary at a shear rate of 1500 s–1 for 4 min and then rinsed in the same conditions. Adherent platelets were recorded using an inverted epifluorescent microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U; Champigny sur Marne, France), coupled to Metamorph 7.0r1 software (Universal Imaging Corporation). The surface covered by platelets was expressed as the relative surface covered to facilitate the comparison of different experimental conditions. Quantification of Platelet Surface Velocity—To calculate the velocity of platelets interacting with the surface of vWF-coated microcapillary, reconstituted blood containing labeled platelets (3 × 103/μl) was perfused at a shear rate of 1500 s–1. Real time platelet adhesion and platelet rolling were recorded at 2 frames/s. Platelet velocity was determined as previously described (35Savage B. Kim E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Shear-induced Platelet Aggregation (SIPA)—SIPA was measured by means of a coaxial cylinder shearing device, as previously described (36Depraetere H. Kim N. Girma J.P. Lacombe C. Meyer D. Deckmyn H. Baruch D. Blood. 1998; 91: 3792-3799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, washed platelets (1.8 × 105/μl) were preincubated with SP600125 (10 μm) or Me2SO and were exposed to a shear rate of 200 or 4000 s–1 for 2 min at 20 °C with vWF (40 μg/ml). The samples were fixed with 1.25% paraform-aldehyde, and the number of single platelets was measured by flow cytometry (Coulter Epics XL, Beckman Coulter, Roissy, France) before and after exposure to shear. SIPA was expressed as the percentage of disappearance of single platelets. Animals—All of the experimental procedures on animals were performed according to French legislation on the protection of animals. FVB mice were obtained from Janvier Laboratories (Le Genest-St-Isle, France) and kept in animal facilities. Eight- to twelve-week-old male mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg), and Xylocain® 0.5% (v/v) was used as a local analgesic. Mouse Platelet Isolation and Labeling for Intravital Microscopy—Blood was collected on PPACK (80 μm) with ACD buffer (1/5) (93 mm Na3 citrate, 7 mm citric acid, 0.14 m dextrose, pH 6.5) via puncture of the heart of anesthetized mice. Platelet-rich plasma was obtained by consecutive centrifugation of the blood for 30 s at 850 × g and 5 min at 150 × g. Upon the addition of 0.2 volume of ACD, 1 μm prostaglandin E1, the platelets were isolated by centrifugation at 850 × g for 5 min. The platelets were resuspended at 0.5 × 106/μl and labeled with 10 μm calcein-AM for 20 min at 37 °C. Photochemically Induced Thrombosis Model—Vascular injury of caecum arterioles and venules was induced by the photoactivatable dye rose bengal as previously described (37Melis E. Kim A. Daenens K. Yamamoto H. Vermylen J. Hoylaerts M.F. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2004; 2: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Anesthetized mice were catheterized via the jugular vein. Fluorescently labeled murine platelets (200 μl; 0.5 × 106 platelets/μl) were injected through the catheter, followed by an intravenous bolus of rose bengal (30 mg/kg), which was infused (30 mg/kg/h) for 10 min, the time required for the injected platelets to reach steady-state, prior to induction of the vascular injury and then throughout the experiment. To evaluate the involvement of JNK1 in thrombus formation, a bolus plus perfusion of the inhibitor SP600125 or Me2SO was applied through the catheterized jugular vein 10 min prior to vessel wall injury (bolus of 0.91 μmol/kg = 200 μg/kg followed by an intravenous infusion at 200 μg/kg/h). The mouse intestines were then spread on a microscopic glass, and the arterioles and venules lying on the caecum were visualized with the epifluorescent microscope. Injury was induced by exposing the selected arterioles and venules at 540 nm for 30 s. Recruitment of fluorescent platelets to the lesion site was registered in real time and recorded in the memory of an attached computer for analysis with the Metamorph program. We analyzed the vessel occlusion time, defined as blood flow arrest for at least 1 min. Statistics—The results are expressed as the means ± S.E. for at least three independent experiments. Statistical significance was assessed with a one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post-test or the Mann-Whitney test, depending on the case. JNK1 Is Involved in Collagen-induced Platelet Aggregation—We have previously reported that JNK1 was present in platelets (28Bugaud F. Kim F. Levy-Toledano S. Rosa J.P. Bryckaert M. Blood. 1999; 94: 3800-3805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but its involvement in hemostasis and thrombosis remains to be established. Therefore, we first investigated the phosphorylation level of JNK1 in collagen-induced platelet aggregation. Platelet suspension was incubated with various doses of collagen (0.2–10 μg/ml) under stirring conditions. Whereas JNK1 was not phosphorylated in resting platelets, phosphorylated JNK1 (JNK1-P) was detected at a low collagen concentration (0.2 μg/ml) (Fig. 1) and reached a maximum at 2 μg/ml collagen after 2 min. These results indicate that JNK1 is activated during platelet aggregation induced by collagen. To further investigate the role of JNK1 in platelets, we used two JNK inhibitors, SP600125 and 6o. We first assessed the inhibitory effect of SP600125 and 6o in conditions of collagen-induced platelet aggregation by testing JNK1 activity. This activity was quantified by the phosphorylation level of the specific substrate, c-Jun (10Hibi M. Kim A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). SP600125 and 6o inhibited JNK1 activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2). Next, the role of JNK1 was investigated in platelet aggregation induced by collagen in conditions where platelets were pretreated with SP600125, 6o, or Me2SO. At low collagen concentrations (0.2 and 0.5 μg/ml), platelet aggregation was totally or partially impaired by both inhibitors (10 μm), whereas at a high collagen concentration (5 μg/ml), these inhibitors had no effect (Fig. 3, A and B). We next examined the effect of various concentrations of JNK inhibitors (2–10 μm) on platelet aggregation induced by a low collagen concentration (0.2 μg/ml). Two μm of SP600125 or 6o impaired platelet aggregation by 28 ± 3 and 14 ± 3%, respectively, compared with control, whereas 10 μm of SP600125 or 6o impaired platelet aggregation by 98 ± 1 and 98 ± 4%, respectively (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3C). In these conditions, at a low collagen concentration (0.2 μg/ml), platelet aggregation and JNK1 phosphorylation were mostly impaired by ADP/ATP scavenger apyrase (2 units/ml) and the antagonist of ADP receptor P2Y12 (AR-C69931 MX; 10 μm), the P2Y1 antagonist (MRS2179) having a weak inhibitory effect on JNK1 phosphorylation (Fig. 4). Taken together, these results indicate that JNK1 is involved in platelet aggregation induced by low collagen concentrations dependent on ADP. Collagen-induced Platelet Deposition Does Not Require JNK1 Activation—First, we examined the state of JNK1 phosphorylation in collagen-induced platelet deposition. Platelet suspensions were plated on type I collagen for various times. JNK1-P was detected after 15 min of adhesion, followed by a decrease in the JNK1 phosphorylation level (Fig. 5A). To investigate the role of JNK1 in platelet deposition on collagen, a static adhesion assay was performed in conditions where only platelet adhesion occurred (2 × 105 platelets/μl), which was confirmed by the identical adhesion observed in the presence or absence of anti-αIIbβ3, ReoPro® (10 μg/ml) (Fig. 5, B and C). Neither of the two JNK inhibitors (10 μm) affected platelet adhesion. Our results show that JNK1 is not required for collagen-induced platelet deposition. JNK1 Is Required in Thrombus Formation on Collagen under Blood Flow Conditions at High Shear Rates—We next investigated the role of JNK1 in platelet adhesion to collagen at different shear rates. Whole blood was perfused over immobilized type I collagen at low (300 s–1) and high (1500 s–1) shear rates. After 4 min of perfusion, thrombi were smaller at 300 s–1 compared with 1500 s–1, and the covered surface reached 22.5 ± 0.5 and 40.6 ± 7.4%, respectively (Fig. 6A). At 300 and 1500 s–1, only 15 ± 8% of platelet surface coverage and aggregate size were dependent on ADP/ATP (data not shown). The addition of SP600125 or 6o, at 300 s–1, did not modify surface coverage (adhesion/aggregation) on immobilized collagen (Fig. 6). In contrast, at 1500 s–1, surface coverage was strongly impaired by SP600125 (71 ± 5%; p < 0.01) (Fig. 6A) and 6o (52 ± 2%; p < 0.01) (Fig. 6B). In addition, the size of thrombi measured by confocal laser scanning microscopy was impaired by 77% in the presence of SP600125 (10 μm) at 1500 s–1 (data not shown). These results show that JNK1 engagement in thrombus formation is dependent on shear conditions. To better understand the apparent discrepancy observed between the low and high shear rates, we next examined the different receptors involved. Blood perfusion assays were performed in the presence or absence of mAb 6F1, which blocks α2β1, and mAb G19H10, which blocks GPIb. At 300 s–1, 6F1 inhibited surface coverage by platelets by 99 ± 2% (p < 0.01), whereas G19H10 had no effect (Fig. 7A). VWF deposition on the collagen surface visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy after perfusion at 300 s–1 confirmed that small amounts of vWF were deposited (Fig. 7B) and that thrombus formation was only dependent on collagen receptors. In contrast, at 1500 s–1, 6F1 and G19H10 impaired surface coverage (aggregation and/or adhesion) by 50 ± 3 and 87 ± 7%, respectively (p < 0.01) (Fig. 7A). Larger amounts of vWF were deposited on immobilized type I collagen (Fig. 7B), showing that in conditions where JNK1 is involved, thrombus formation is mostly dependent on GPIb-vWF interaction. Finally, to further investigate the role of JNK1 at 1500 s–1, adhesion without thrombi was examined in control platelets in the presence of anti-αIIbβ3 (ReoPro®) and in platelets from GT patient characterized by an absence of αIIbβ3. When thrombi were inhibited in the presence of ReoPro®, only platelet adhesion was observed, and the addition of SP600125 did not affect adhesion (Fig. 8A). Importantly, in the absence of thrombi, platelet adhesion was inhibited only by 6F1 (98 ± 1%) and not by G19H10 (8 ± 5%), indicating that platelet adhesion was dependent on collagen receptors (α2β1 and GPVI) but not on GPIb-vWF interaction (Fig. 8B) as previously described (37Melis E. Kim A. Daenens K. Yamamoto H. Vermylen J. Hoylaerts M.F. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2004; 2: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Our results show that, at a high shear rate, thrombus formation dependent on GPIb-vWF interaction requires JNK1 activation.FIGURE 7Involvement of collagen receptors and GPIb in platelet adhesion to collagen matrix.

We investigated an outbreak of severe CA-MRSA infections in children following out-patient vaccination. Methods and Findings We carried out a field investigation after adverse events following immunization (AEFI) were reported. We reviewed the clinical data from all cases. S. aureus recovered from skin infections and from nasal and throat swabs were analyzed by pulse-field gel electrophoresis, multi locus sequence typing, PCR and microarray. In May 2006, nine children presented with AEFI, ranging from fatal toxic shock syndrome, necrotizing soft tissue infection, purulent abscesses, to fever with rash. All had received a vaccination injection in different health centres in one District of Ho Chi Minh City. Eight children had been vaccinated by the same health care worker (HCW). Deficiencies in vaccine quality, storage practices, or preparation and delivery were not found. Infection control practices were insufficient. CA-MRSA was cultured in four children and from nasal and throat swabs from the HCW. Strains from children and HCW were indistinguishable. All carried the Panton-Valentine leukocidine (PVL), the staphylococcal enterotoxin B gene, the gene complex for staphylococcal-cassette-chromosome mec type V, and were sequence type 59. Strain HCM3A is epidemiologically unrelated to a strain of ST59 prevalent in the USA, although they belong to the same lineage. Conclusions We describe an outbreak of infections with CA-MRSA in children, transmitted by an asymptomatic colonized HCW during immunization injection. Consistent adherence to injection practice guidelines is needed to prevent CA-MRSA transmission in both in- and outpatient settings."
https://openalex.org/W2120357332,"The MCM2-7 proteins are crucial components of the pre replication complex (preRC) in eukaryotes. Since they are significantly more abundant than other preRC components, we were interested in determining whether the entire cellular content was necessary for DNA replication in vivo.We performed a systematic depletion of the MCM proteins in Drosophila S2 cells using dsRNA-interference. Reducing MCM2-6 levels by >95-99% had no significant effect on cell cycle distribution or viability. Depletion of MCM7 however caused an S-phase arrest. MCM2-7 depletion produced no change in the number of replication forks as measured by PCNA loading. We also depleted MCM8. This caused a 30% reduction in fork number, but no significant effect on cell cycle distribution or viability. No additive effects were observed by co-depleting MCM8 and MCM5.These studies suggest that, in agreement with what has previously been observed for Xenopus in vitro, not all of the cellular content of MCM2-6 proteins is needed for normal cell cycling. They also reveal an unexpected unique role for MCM7. Finally they suggest that MCM8 has a role in DNA replication in S2 cells."

Chem. 2006; 281: 4517-4522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm, CBC is replaced by the cytoplasmic cap-binding protein, also known as eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), which together with factors eIF4A and eIF4G, is responsible for initiation of cap-dependent mRNA translation (see Refs. 10Labourier E.

Biol. 2004; 11: 992-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and references therein). Similarly, the poly(A) tail is recognized in the nucleus by the nuclear poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1), which subsequently is replaced by the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) (see Refs. 12Kabnick K.S.

In the deadenylation-dependent decapping pathway, the cap is recognized and removed after the initial deadenylation step, whereas hydrolysis of the cap is one of the final steps in the deadenylation followed by 3′-5′ degradation pathway. Several poly(A) degrading activities have been characterized in eukaryotic cells (reviewed in Refs. 2Meyer S. Temme C. Wahle E. Crit Rev. Biochem. Mol.

The cap stimulates the rate of the PARN reaction and thereby amplifies PARN processivity (22Martinez J. Ren Y.G. Thuresson A.C. Hellman U. Astrom J. Virtanen A. J. Biol.

It has been proposed that the cap binding property of PARN could play a critical role in regulating the competition between translation and mRNA degradation (Refs. 2Meyer S. Temme C. Wahle E. Crit Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 39: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 5Wilusz C.J. Wormington M. Peltz S.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2007; 8: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar and references therein). For example, this property of PARN could abrogate ongoing protein synthesis and target the mRNA for degradation or vice versa could ensure that translation is not initiated on an mRNA already subjected to PARN-mediated degradation. PARN is an oligomeric enzyme (22Martinez J. Ren Y.G. Thuresson A.C. Hellman U. Astrom J. Virtanen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24222-24230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and a recent crystal structure has revealed a dimeric composition (28Wu M. Reuter M. Lilie H. Liu Y. Wahle E. Song H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4082-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The active site of PARN has been characterized both biochemically (29Ren Y.G. Kirsebom L.A. Virtanen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48702-48706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 30Ren Y.G. Martinez J. Virtanen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5982-5987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and structurally (28Wu M. Reuter M. Lilie H. Liu Y. Wahle E. Song H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4082-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and is build up by four conserved acidic amino acid residues that coordinate catalytically essential divalent metal ions. In addition to the cap-binding and the active sites, PARN also contains two potential RNA-binding sites. One of these sites belongs to the recently identified R3H class of RNA-binding domains (Refs. 28Wu M. Reuter M. Lilie H. Liu Y. Wahle E. Song H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4082-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar and 31Grishin N.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 329-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar and Protein Data Bank entry 1UG8), whereas the second is a classical RNA recognition motif (RRM) (Protein Data Bank entry 1WHV) (Fig. 1). However, no functional data has yet confirmed that any of these two domains bind RNA; neither has the cap-binding site been identified. It is of utmost importance to identify and characterize the cap- and poly(A)-binding sites of PARN to fully understand how poly(A) specificity is achieved and how PARN integrates its hydrolytic activity with its cap binding properties. Here we have investigated the cap binding property of PARN, using fluorescence spectroscopy and mutational analysis and identified at least one tryptophan residue within the RRM that is involved in cap binding. We have also characterized the RNA binding properties of the RRM and found that the RRM preferentially binds poly(A) and that the RNA- and cap-binding sites are located in close proximity to each other but not overlapping. In conclusion, our data show that the RRM of PARN binds both cap and poly(A), suggesting that the RRM is a major element important for proper PARN activity because the RRM is involved in the two unique properties tightly associated with PARN, i.e. poly(A) specificity and cap binding. Molecular Cloning—A DNA fragment corresponding to amino acids 443–560 in the human PARN sequence, PARN (443–560), was obtained by PCR amplification using plasmid pE33PARN (30Ren Y.G. Martinez J. Virtanen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5982-5987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) as template and the primers (443–560)5′ containing restriction site for NdeI and (443–560)3′ containing restriction site for Bpu1102 I. The sequences of used primers are listed in Table S1. The obtained DNA fragment was cloned into pCR 2.1TOPO vector and subsequently subcloned into the pET19b vector between the NdeI and Bpu1102 I sites. Site-directed Mutagenesis—All of the PARN mutants were generated from pE33PARN using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's protocol. The mutations were introduced by using primers named as the corresponding mutation and with sequences as listed in Table S1. All of the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Polypeptides—His-tagged recombinant PARN, PARN(W219A), PARN (E455A), PARN(W456A), PARN(E455A,W456A), PARN (W475A), PARN(W526A), PARN(W531A), PARN(W639A), PARN(E455,W456,475A), PARN(443–560), and PARN(443–560,W456,475A) polypeptides were expressed from Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) as described (32Nilsson P. Virtanen A. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2006; 39: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Soluble recombinant polypeptides were purified using Talon Metal Affinity Resin (Clontech) according to Nilsson and Virtanen (32Nilsson P. Virtanen A. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2006; 39: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The amount of protein was measured using Bio-Rad protein assay kit, and purity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver or Coomassie staining. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Recombinant PARN or PARN mutants expressed in E. coli and purified as previously described (32Nilsson P. Virtanen A. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2006; 39: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) were used. The protein was dialyzed into buffer D (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 100 mm KCl. The protein samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 rpm in 4 °C and softly degassed prior to each measurement. Concentrations of the protein supernatants and ligands were determined spectroscopically on a Uvikon 933 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Kontron Instruments). For monomers of PARN, single Trp → Ala PARN mutants, PARN(E455A,W456,W475A), PARN(443–560), and PARN(443–560,W456,W475A), extinction coefficients at 280 nm of 71,990, 66,490, 60,990, 33,920, and 22,920 m-1 cm-1 were used, respectively (33Gasteiger E. Gattiker A. Hoogland C. Ivanyi I. Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3784-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (3429) Google Scholar). Concentrations of m7GTP (Sigma, catalog number M-6133) and m7GpppG (GE Healthcare catalog number 27-4635) were determined according to Cai et al. (34Cai A. Jankowska-Anyszka M. Centers A. Chlebicka L. Stepinski J. Stolarski R. Darzynkiewicz E. Rhoads R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8538-8547Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were performed on LS 50 B and LS 55 spectrofluorometers (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with an automatic correction for the photomultiplier sensitivity, in a thermostatted quartz micro or semi-micro cuvette (Hellma catalog number 104.002F QS and 119.004F QS), at 20.0 °C. For all of the measurements, an excitation wavelength of 280 nm was applied (slit 2.5 nm, auto cut-off filter). Titrations based on whole spectra recording (Fig. 2, A and B) were performed for PARN and single Trp → Ala mutants at 5 μm per monomer by adding 2-μl aliquots of m7GTP or m7GpppG to 400 μl of the protein. Each titration consisted of eight emission spectra recorded for different ligand concentrations. The change in the fluorescence intensity was calculated from data points at 320 nm, which provided precise detection of both the intrinsic protein fluorescence quenching and the fluorescence increase caused by the presence of free ligand in the solution toward the end of the titration. Detailed fluorescence titrations (Fig. 2, C and D) were performed essentially as described previously (35Niedzwiecka A. Marcotrigiano J. Stepinski J. Jankowska-Anyszka M. Wyslouch-Cieszynska A. Dadlez M. Gingras A.C. Mak P. Darzynkiewicz E. Sonenberg N. Burley S.K. Stolarski R. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 615-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). PARN and its mutants were used at 0.2 and 1 μm/monomer, in steady-state conditions provided by preincubation at a given concentration by at least 1 h. Fluorescence changes were monitored continuously with the integration time of 30 s and the gap of 30 s for adding the ligand, with slow magnetic stirring, at a single wave-length of 320 (slit 4 nm, 290 nm cut-off filter) During the gap, the UV xenon flash lamp was switched off to avoid photobleaching of the sample. Aliquots of 1 μl of increasing concentrations (10 μm to 2 mm) of m7GTP or m7GpppG were injected manually to 800 μl of protein solution. Each titration consisted of 40 data points. The fluorescence intensities were corrected for the inner filter effect and the dilution of the sample. The values of the dissociation constants, KD, were obtained by fitting the theoretical curve to the experimental data points, F, using the following full equilibrium binding equation, F=F(0)−[cx]·(Δϕ+ϕlig-free)+[L]·ϕlig-freewhere the actual concentration of the protein·ligand complex, [cx], is as follows, [cx]=12([L]+[P]+KD−([L]−[P]+KD)2+4KD·[P])and F(0) is the initial fluorescence of the pure protein; [L]isthe total ligand concentration; [P] is the protein concentration per monomer; Δϕ is the difference between the fluorescence efficiencies of the apo-protein and the complex; ϕlig-free is the fluorescence efficiency of the ligand. KD and Δϕ were free parameters of the fitting. The values of ϕlig-free were fixed and taken from independent controlling titration experiments in pure buffer. Regressions were performed by means of a nonlinear, least squares method, using PRISM 3.02 (GraphPad Software) or Origin 7 software (OriginLab Corporation). The final KD values were calculated as weighed averages from at least three independent titration series. Circular Dichroism—CD spectra were measured on an Aviv spectropolarimeter (Lakewood, NJ) in 1.00-mm quartz cuvette (110-QS; Hellma) in 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.0, 5% glycerol, 0.75 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, at 20.0 °C, with 4 s of integration time at each point in at least two scans. The buffers and the protein solutions were filtered through a 100-kDa membrane (Millipore) and degassed for 15 min prior to the experiments. The concentrations of PARN(443–560) and PARN(443–560,W456,475A) monomers were 20.9 and 11.5 μm, respectively. Molar ellipticity, [θ]λ, was calculated for the full sequences of the tagged proteins. Preparation of RNA Substrates—L3(A30) RNA substrates with or without m7GpppG at their 5′ ends were synthesized by in vitro transcription as previously described (27Martinez J. Ren Y.G. Nilsson P. Ehrenberg M. Virtanen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27923-27929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A5-A20 substrates were purchased from Dharmacon Research, Inc. Before usage the substrates were deprotected according to the instructions from the manufacturer. 10 pmol of A5-A20 were 5′-labeled with 20 pmol [γ-32P]ATP (GE Healthcare; catalog number AA0068) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (USB; catalog number 70031Z), and the reactions were incubated in 37 °C for 45 min. The labeled oligonucleotides were resolved on 25% acrylamide gels, bands cut out and eluted in water. The final concentrations of labeled oligo(A) were 2.5–25 nm. PARN Deadenylation Assay—The conditions for the deadenylation assays were 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, and 15 mm MgCl2.10 nm PARN or PARN(E455,W456,475A) monomers were incubated with 50 nm capped or noncapped radioactively labeled L3A30 RNA substrates. A 20-μl reaction was incubated at 30 °C, and 1-μl aliquots were taken out at indicated time points. The reactions were analyzed, and released AMP products were separated by one-dimensional TLC by spotting 1 μl of the reaction on a polyethyleneimine cellulose F plate (Merck; 5579) and using 0.75 m KH2PO4, pH 3.5 (H3PO4), as solvent. The plate was dried, exposed, and scanned by a 400S PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—10-μl reactions were performed in Buffer A (32 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA) using 5 nm of oligo(A) RNA and 0.2–8 μm of monomeric PARN or PARN mutant. The reactions were incubated for 15 min at room temperature. 5 μl of loading dye (8% glycerol, 0.15% bromphenol blue/xylene cyanole) was added to the reaction prior to loading the samples to nondenaturing gel (0.5× TBE, 6% 19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide v/v) prerun at 200 V, 5W for 30 min in 4 °C. The gels were run for 3 h at 5 Win 4 °C or using the BioVectis DNA Pointer System for 33 min at constant 30 W at 10 °C, dried in a Bio-Rad gel dryer for 1 h, and finally exposed and scanned by a 400S PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Filter Binding Assay—Reactions using 32P-labeled A5-A20 as the RNA were performed as described under “Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay.” After 15 min of incubation, the entire reaction mixture was bound to a Protran BA 85 Cellulose nitrate membrane (Schleicher & Schuell; catalog number 10 401191) preincubated in ice-cold Buffer A and mounted on a vacuum manifold with no vacuum applied. The membrane was washed with 0.75 ml of ice-cold Buffer A with vacuum applied and dried, and finally the amount of bound protein·RNA complex was quantified in a BeckmannCoulter LC6500 scintillation counter. The equilibrium dissociation constant, KD, was obtained by plotting experimental data and fitting curves with nonlinear regression (Origin 7 software, OriginLab Corporation) using the following binding equation, [PL]=12([L0]+[P0]+KD−([L0]−[P0]+KD)2−4·[L0][P0])where [P0] and KD were free parameters of the fitting, and [P0] is the active concentration of PARN polypeptides. The dissociation rate constant, kd, of the PARN·A20 complex was determined by setting up reactions as described above. At time 0 a 100-fold excess of cold A20 was added, and subsequently 10-μl aliquots were taken out at different time points and subjected to filter binding assay. The equation [PL]=[PL]0·e−(kd·t)was used to calculate the dissociation rate constant, kd. supplemental data—Supplemental information includes supplemental Fig. S1 and supplemental Table S1.

https://openalex.org/W2146275202,"It is well known that small molecules (ligands) do not necessarily adopt their lowest potential energy conformations when binding to proteins. Analyses of protein-bound ligand crystal structures have reportedly shown that many of them do not even adopt the conformations at local minima of their potential energy surfaces (local minimum conformations). The results of these analyses raise a concern regarding the validity of virtual screening methods that use ligands in local minimum conformations. Here we report a normal-mode-analysis (NMA) study of 100 crystal structures of protein-bound ligands. Our data show that the energy minimization of a ligand alone does not automatically stop at a local minimum conformation if the minimum of the potential energy surface is shallow, thus leading to the folding of the ligand. Furthermore, our data show that all 100 ligand conformations in their protein-bound ligand crystal structures are nearly identical to their local minimum conformations obtained from NMA-monitored energy minimization, suggesting that ligands prefer to adopt local minimum conformations when binding to proteins. These results both support virtual screening methods that use ligands in local minimum conformations and caution about possible adverse effect of excessive energy minimization when generating a database of ligand conformations for virtual screening."
https://openalex.org/W1985343126,"Background NK cells are able to kill tumor and virus-infected cells without the need of prior antigen stimulation. The killing of these target cells is regulated by inhibitory, lysis and co-stimulatory receptors that are expressed on the surface of NK cells. Principal Findings CD100 (Semaphorin 4D), a 150kD transmembrane protein, is expressed on the surface of activated NK cells as a homodimer, mediates the killing of target cells by binding to CD72. CD100 is not involved directly in the killing process but is rather increases NK cytotoxicity by enhancing the adhesion between NK cells and their targets. This increased adhesion leads to a more efficient killing and enhanced IFNγ secretion. Significance Since CD72 is expressed on antigen presenting cells (APC) and the CD100-CD72 interaction lead to the shading of CD100, we suggest that NK interacting with APC cells could be the early source of soluble CD100 which is crucial for the formation of antigen specific immune response. CD100-CD72 interaction can be the mechanism by which NK cell communicate with B cells."

There are two major isoforms of Epac, Epac1 and Epac2, each encoded by an independent gene and with distinctive tissue distribution in mammalian cells. Epac1 and Epac2 share extensive sequence homology, and both contain an N-terminal regulatory region and a C-terminal catalytic region. The catalytic region of Epac consists of a RAS exchange motif (REM) domain, RAS association (RA) domain, and a classic CDC25 homology domain (CDC25HD) responsible for nucleotide exchange activity. Whereas the regulatory region of Epac1 and Epac2 shares a Dishevelled/Egl-10/pleckstrin (DEP) domain followed by a cAMP-binding domain (CBD), an additional CBD N-terminal to the DEP domain is presented in Epac2. The function of this extra CBD domain (CBD-A) is not clear, since it binds cAMP with low affinity and does not seem to be essential for Epac regulation by cAMP (13de Rooij J. Kim H. van Triest M.

In the absence of cAMP, the N-terminal regulatory region of Epac acts as an autoinhibitor of the C-terminal guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity by sterically blocking the access of the downstream effector, Rap. Binding of cAMP to the high affinity CBD leads to a conformational change that releases the CDC25HD from the interdomain inhibition imposed by the CBD. This regulatory scheme is further supported by a recently solved crystal structure of the full-length Epac2 in the absence of cAMP (17Rehmann H. Kim J. Knipscheer P. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 2006; 439: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In this autoinhibited Epac2 structure, the regulatory and catalytic regions form two distinctive structural lobes. The smaller regulatory lobe is anchored to the larger catalytic lobe by the so-called “switchboard” structure, which is a five-strand β-sheet-like structure consisting of the C terminus of the second CBD of Epac2 (CBD-B), the N terminus of the REM domain, and a hairpin of the catalytic core. Although CBD-A does not interact with the catalytic region, CBD-B of Epac2, which is common to Epac1 and Epac2, is briefly connected to the catalytic guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain through an “ionic latch” (17Rehmann H. Kim J. Knipscheer P. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 2006; 439: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). This loose interdomain interaction is the only direct contact point between the regulatory region and catalytic core of Epac. Because of its proximity to the Rap1-binding surface, this ionic latch is believed to be important for the inhibitory effect exerted by the CBD-B on the catalytic activity. Determining the specific regions/residues of Epac that undergo conformational changes in response to cAMP binding is the next step in elucidating the mechanism of Epac activation. Hydrogen exchange techniques have been successfully employed to study protein conformational change and protein folding for more than 30 years (18Englander S.W. Kim L. Bai Y. Sosnick T.R.

Since the atomic structure of cAMP-bound Epac in its active state is not currently available, the molecular mechanism of Epac activation is not known. In this study, we investigated the conformational and dynamic states of Epac1 in the presence and absence of cAMP using DXMS and structural modeling to delineate the mechanism of Epac activation. Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant Δ(1–148)Epac1 was expressed and purified as described previously (49Mei F.C. Kim X.D. Mol.

Two major parameters optimized were the concentration of guanidine hydrochloride in the quenching buffer and the pump C flow rate over the pepsin column. A 5-μl stock solution of Δ(1–148)Epac1 (8 mg/ml) was diluted with 15 μl of water and then quenched with 30 μl of 0.8% formic acid containing various concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride (0–6.4 m). The quenched sample was immediately injected into the DXMS apparatus, and the system was started. The flow rate passing over the pepsin column was varied between 100 and 250 μl/min. Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange—Deuterated samples were prepared at 23 ± 1 °C by diluting 5 μl of Δ(1–148)Epac1 stock solution with 15 μl of deuterated buffer (20 mm Mops (pH 7.0), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol), followed by “on-exchange” incubation for varying times (10–3000 s) prior to quenching in 30 μl of 0.8% formic acid, 3.2 m guanidine hydrochloride at 0 °C (31Pantazatos D.

These functionally deuterated samples were then subjected to DXMS analysis, along with control samples of nondeuterated and fully deuterated Δ(1–148)Epac1 (incubated in deuterated buffer overnight at room temperature).

Thawed samples (50 μl) were then automatically and immediately passed over a column (66-μl bed volume) filled with porcine pepsin (Sigma) (immobilized on Poros 20 AL medium at 30 mg/ml following the manufacturer’s instructions), at a flow rate of 100 μl/min, with contemporaneous collection of the resulting proteolytic products by a C18 column (Vydac). Subsequently, the C18 column was eluted with a linear gradient of 5–45% B over 30 min (solvent A was 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and solvent B was 80% (v/v) acetonitrile, 20% (v/v) water, 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid).

Data acquisition was performed in either MS1 profile mode (for deuterium quantification) or data-dependent MS2 mode (for peptide identification). Sequence Identification of Peptide Fragments—The SEQUEST software program (Thermo Finnigan Inc.) was used to identify the likely sequence of the parent peptide ions. Identified peptides were then further examined to determine if the quality of the measured isotopic envelope of peptides was sufficient to allow accurate measurement of the geometric centroid of isotopic envelopes on deuterated samples and then assayed for deuterium content in functionally deuterated samples employing specialized software as previously described (31Pantazatos D.

Structural Modeling of Epac1—The Epac1 structural model was initially generated using homology modeling software MODELLER (50Marti-Renom M.A. Kim A.C. Fiser A. Sanchez R. Melo F. Sali A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 291-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar). The recently solved Epac2 three-dimensional coordinates (Protein Data Bank code 2BYV) (17Rehmann H. Kim J. Knipscheer P. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 2006; 439: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) was used as the template. A three-dimensional model of the cAMP-bound Epac1 CBD was created using the CBD-B of rat PKA RIIβ crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 1CX4) as a template. The initial structural models were subjected to additional energy minimization and further refined using the molecular dynamics simulation package AMBER in the presence of a water box. The final Epac1 models were based on the average energy-minimized structure over the last 100 ps of the 5-ns molecular dynamics simulation. Pepsin Fragmentation of Δ(1–148)Epac1 and Peptide Identification—Pepsin digestion and HPLC separation conditions that produced Δ(1–148)Epac1 fragments of optimal size and distribution for exchange analysis were established prior to H/D exchange experiments. We used Δ(1–148)Epac1 in this study, since the published literature so far indicates that the function of the N-terminal 148 residues is mainly associated with cellular targeting of Epac1 in vivo (13de Rooij J.

In addition, extensive biophysical and biochemical characterization by Wittinghofer and co-workers (14Kraemer A. Kim H.R. Cool R.H. Theiss C. de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) show that Δ(1–148)Epac1 retains all measurable biochemical functional properties, such as cAMP binding and Rap activation. Removal of the first 148 residues significantly improves Epac1 solubility and increases expression levels in Escherichia coli, whereas the full-length Epac1 protein cannot be expressed and purified in sufficient quantity (14Kraemer A. Kim H.R. Cool R.H. Theiss C. de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 49Mei F.C. Kim X.D. Mol. Biosystems. 2005; 1: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Optimal pepsin digestion for Δ(1–148)Epac1 was obtained by diluting one part of the deuterated sample with one and a half parts of the quench solution (3.2 m guanidine hydrochloride in 0.8% formic acid). The quenched sample was then run over immobilized pepsin with a duration of 40 s. These conditions generated 111 peptides covering 76% of the Δ(1–148)Epac1 sequence (Fig. 1). H/D Exchanges of Δ(1–148)Epac1 in the cAMP-free State—To explore the intrinsic protein dynamics and conformational flexibility of Epac, H/D exchange of Δ(1–148)Epac1 was monitored by DXMS. Fig. 2 shows one specific peptide fragment, Pro487–Arg492, prior and subsequent to dilution in D2O. Incorporation of deuterium is clearly evident from the increase in overall mass and complexity of the peptide mass peaks as a function of deuteration time. The deuteration level of cAMP-free Δ(1–148)Epac1 as a function of time is illustrated in Fig. 3A. Peptide fragments with a broad range of exchange speeds, varying from nearly fully exchanged at the shortest time point employed (10 s) to no detectable exchange at the longest time point employed (3000 s), were observed.FIGURE 3Amide H/D exchange results of cAMP-free Δ(1–148)Epac1. A, the deuteration levels of each peptide fragment at various time points are shown by different colors, from blue (<10%) to red (>90%), as indicated at the lower right corner of the figure. Each block represents an individual peptide analyzed at each of the six time points (from top, 10, 30, 100, 300, 1000, and 3000 s). B, peptide fragments with more than 50% deuteration levels after a 100-s exchange in D2O are mapped onto the structural model of Epac1 in red (>70%) and in yellow (>50% and <70%). Three independent DXMS analyses were performed, and similar results were obtained. Studies performed with our automated exchange data acquisition apparatus result in deuterium incorporation S.D. values of 2.5% or less when replicates are analyzed (33Wong L. Kim S. Chie-Leon B. Miyashita O. Aubol B. Shaffer J. Onuchic J.N. Jennings P.A. Woods V.L. Jr. Adams J. A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 93-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When we mapped the solvent-exposed peptides, defined as more than 50% deuteration after 100 s in D2O, onto the homology structural model of Epac1 constructed based on the x-ray structure of Epac2, many of these fragments were located in the loop and turn regions (Fig. 3B). This is consistent with the fact that loops and turns are usually exposed to solvent and more flexible. In fact, the fastest exchange fragments revealed by DXMS correspond to regions in Epac2 structure without significant electron density, a sign of high flexibility associated with structure disorder. Most of the fast exchange regions of Δ(1–148)Epac1 are located in the CBD, REM, and RA domains, suggesting that these domains, particularly the CBD, are highly dynamic in the absence of cAMP. On the other hand, the catalytic core of Epac (CDC25HD), except for the very C-terminal tail, is relatively solvent-inaccessible. Effects of cAMP Binding on H/D Exchanges of Δ(1–148)Epac1—To elucidate the conformational changes associated with Epac activation, the time-dependent amide H/D exchange patterns of Δ(1–148)Epac1 in the presence and absence of cAMP were measured and compared. Although the binding of cAMP had no effect on the time-dependent incorporation of deuterons for most of the peptide fragments, as typified by peptide Phe379–Leu392 (Fig. 4A), the rates and/or the extents of the H/D exchange of several peptides decreased in response to cAMP binding over the experimental time course (Fig. 4, B–H), indicating that these peptide fragments are protected by the binding of cAMP. We did not observe that cAMP significantly increased the rate of deuteron incorporation for any of the peptide fragments analyzed. When the peptide fragments of Epac1 that underwent significant changes in amide H/D exchange were mapped onto the three-dimensional structural model of Epac1, all changes in solvent accessibility induced by cAMP were located at the relative more dynamic parts of the Epac, including the CBD, the switchboard, and the REM domains. The catalytic core (CDC25HD) domain remains constant upon cAMP binding (Fig. 5A). It is reassuring that the largest changes induced by cAMP binding are located directly at the cAMP binding pocket. These apparent decreases in H/D exchange at the cAMP binding pocket upon cAMP binding may be due to the steric protection of residues that come in direct contact with the ligand or/and to local conformational/dynamic changes in response to binding of cAMP. Although our DXMS analyses could not distinguish these possibilities, the coincidence between the observed major region of solvent protection and the cAMP binding pocket provides an independent validation for our DXMS analysis. On the other hand, observed changes in solvent accessibility at regions outside the cAMP binding pocket provided a potential description of the conformational changes induced by cAMP binding during Epac activation (Fig. 5A).

https://openalex.org/W1981836110,"One effect of stressors such as chronic drug administration is that sequence within the terminal exon of the transcription factor FosB is recognized as intronic and removed by alternative splicing. This results in an open-reading-frame shift that produces a translation stop codon and ultimately a truncated protein, termed ΔFosB. In vitro splicing assays with control and mutated transcripts generated from a fosB mini-gene construct indicated a CU-rich sequence at the 3′ end of intron 4 (I4) plays an important role in regulating fosB pre-mRNA splicing due to its binding of polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB). PTB binding to this sequence is dependent upon phosphorylation by protein kinase A and is blocked if the CU-rich sequence is mutated to a U-rich region. When this mutated fosB minigene is expressed in HeLa cells, the splicing efficiency of its product is increased compared to wild type. Moreover, transient transfection of PTB-1 in HeLa cells decreased the splicing efficiency of a wild type fosB minigene transcript. Depletion of PTB from nuclear extracts facilitated U2AF65 binding to wild type sequence in vitro, suggesting these proteins function in a dynamic equilibrium to modulate fosB pre-mRNA alternative splicing. These results demonstrate for the first time that phosphorylated PTB promotes intron retention and thereby silences the splicing of fosB I4."
https://openalex.org/W1983823376,"Background While human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes preferentially target specific regions of the viral proteome, HIV-1 features that contribute to immune recognition are not well understood. One hypothesis is that similarities between HIV and human proteins influence the host immune response, i.e., resemblance between viral and host peptides could preclude reactivity against certain HIV epitopes. Methodology/Principal Findings We analyzed the extent of similarity between HIV-1 and the human proteome. Proteins from the HIV-1 B consensus sequence from 2001 were dissected into overlapping k-mers, which were then probed against a non-redundant database of the human proteome in order to identify segments of high similarity. We tested the relationship between HIV-1 similarity to host encoded peptides and immune recognition in HIV-infected individuals, and found that HIV immunogenicity could be partially modulated by the sequence similarity to the host proteome. ELISpot responses to peptides spanning the entire viral proteome evaluated in 314 individuals showed a trend indicating an inverse relationship between the similarity to the host proteome and the frequency of recognition. In addition, analysis of responses by a group of 30 HIV-infected individuals against 944 overlapping peptides representing a broad range of individual HIV-1B Nef variants, affirmed that the degree of similarity to the host was significantly lower for peptides with reactive epitopes than for those that were not recognized. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that antigenic motifs that are scarcely represented in human proteins might represent more immunogenic CTL targets not selected against in the host. This observation could provide guidance in the design of more effective HIV immunogens, as sequences devoid of host-like features might afford superior immune reactivity."
https://openalex.org/W1993548844,"We describe two uncommon roles for Zn2+ in enzyme KpnI restriction endonuclease (REase). Among all of the REases studied, KpnI REase is unique in its DNA binding and cleavage characteristics. The enzyme is a poor discriminator of DNA sequences, cleaving DNA in a promiscuous manner in the presence of Mg2+. Unlike most Type II REases, the active site of the enzyme comprises an HNH motif, which can accommodate Mg2+, Mn2+, or Ca2+. Among these metal ions, Mg2+ and Mn2+ induce promiscuous cleavage by the enzyme, whereas Ca2+-bound enzyme exhibits site-specific cleavage. Examination of the sequence of the protein revealed the presence of a zinc finger CCCH motif rarely found in proteins of prokaryotic origin. The zinc binding motif tightly coordinates zinc to provide a rigid structural framework for the enzyme needed for its function. In addition to this structural scaffold, another atom of zinc binds to the active site to induce high fidelity cleavage and suppress the Mg2+- and Mn2+-mediated promiscuous behavior of the enzyme.

A large number of proteins have bound zinc ions, which contribute to protein stability and/or catalytic functions more widely than any other transition metal ions (1Coleman J.E. Annu. Rev.

A catalytic role for zinc was first shown in the case of carbonic anhydrase (3Keilin D. Kim T. Biochem.

Since then, the roles for Zn2+ in numerous zinc-binding proteins have been identified and characterized. In many examples, the role of zinc ion is neither strictly structural nor catalytic, as in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, where zinc is involved in amino acid discrimination (6Sankaranarayanan R.

Zinc binding motifs are structurally diverse and are present among proteins that perform a broad range of functions in various cellular processes. For instance, the motifs play a role in DNA recognition, transcription activation, protein folding and assembly, and protein-protein interactions (7Laity J.H. Kim B.M. Wright P.E. Curr. Opin. Struct.

The binding of zinc is important for structural stability of I-PpoI, I-TevI, and T4 endonuclease VII and for catalysis in endonuclease IV and colicin E7. Bioinformatic analysis showed that McrA has a zinc binding fold, suggested to be needed for structural integrity (13Bujnicki J.M. Kim M. Rychlewski L. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1280-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). R.BslI contains two glucocorticoid receptor-like zinc (Cys4) binding motifs, which are important for the protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions (14Vanamee E.S. Kim P. Zhu Z. Yates D. Garman E. Xu S. Aggarwal A.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe two distinct roles for Zn2+ in R.KpnI. Type II REases 3The abbreviations used are: REase, restriction endonuclease; WT, wild type. require Mg2+ or a similar divalent metal ion to cleave DNA. Almost 3700 Type II restriction enzymes, representing more than 262 distinct specificities, are known to date (15Roberts R.J. Kim T. Posfai J. Macelis D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: D269-D270Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Most Type II REases belong to the PD... (D/E)XK superfamily (16Pingoud A. Kim M. Pingoud V. Wende W. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 685-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Recent structural and bioinformatics studies revealed that apart from the PD... (D/E)XK superfamily, few REases belong to other nuclease superfamilies, such as Nuc, HNH, and YIG-GIY, which are structurally unrelated to each other (17Sapranauskas R. Kim G. Lagunavicius A.

Sci. 2001; 26: 9-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment and subsequent validation experiments showed that R.KpnI is the first member of the HNH superfamily (20Saravanan M. Kim J.M. Cymerman I.A. Rao D.N. Nagaraja V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 6129-6135Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although at first glance R.KpnI appeared to be a typical dimeric Type IIP REase recognizing and cleaving palindromic sequence GGTACC, it has several distinct features. The properties include prolific promiscuous activity in the presence of Mg2+ which is further enhanced with Mn2+, efficient site specific high fidelity DNA cleavage when Ca2+ is used instead of Mg2+, and suppression of the promiscuous cleavage activity in presence of Ca2+ (21Chandrashekaran S. Kim M. Radha D.R. Nagaraja V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49736-49740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies revealed that the Ca2+-mediated exquisite specificity is achieved at the step of DNA cleavage (22Saravanan M. Kim K. Kanakaraj R. Rao D.N. Nagaraja Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 2777-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The alignment of McrA, T4 endonuclease VII, and R.KpnI is depicted in Fig. 1A. The former two enzymes have tetra-Cys Zn2+ fingers, whereas R.KpnI has an unusual CCCH putative Zn2+ finger. Here we describe the importance of the Zn2+ finger motif in Zn2+ coordination. Surprisingly, the bound Zn2+ has more complex, multiple roles in R.KpnI function, in a manner distinct from any other restriction-modification system. Enzymes and DNA—T4 polynucleotide kinase, Pfu DNA polymerase, and DpnI were purchased from New England Biolabs. Oligonucleotides (Sigma and Microsynth) were purified on 18% urea-polyacrylamide gel (33Sambrook J. Kim E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol). Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification of Mutant Proteins—The model of R.KpnI was built using the structure of T4 endonuclease VII and other structurally characterized HNH superfamily nucleases. The detailed procedure has been described and discussed previously (20Saravanan M. Kim J.M. Cymerman I.A. Rao D.N. Nagaraja V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 6129-6135Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by the megaprimer method (23Kirsch R.D. Kim E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1848-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The WT and mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli BL26 (F-omp T hsdSB (rB- mB-) gal dcm Δlac (DE3) nin5 lac UV5-T7 gene 1) containing KpnI methyltransferase, and the cells were induced with 0.3 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside as described previously (24Chandrashekaran S. Kim P. Nagaraja V. J. Biosci. 1999; 24: 269-277Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed by sonication in buffer A containing 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA, 7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The supernatant was subjected to 0-50% ammonium sulfate fractionation. The samples were dialyzed against buffer A and purified by phosphocellulose and Hi-Trap heparin columns. The fractions containing the enzyme were pooled and dialyzed against buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 50% glycerol). The concentration of the proteins was estimated by the method of Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Atomic Absorption Analysis—Purified R.KpnI (10 mg) was denatured and renatured in the presence or absence of 100 μm ZnCl2 or 5 mm EDTA and then dialyzed overnight against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl at 4 °C with buffer changes to eliminate excess metal ions or chelators. Chelex-100 resin (Sigma) was used to remove trace metal ions in all of the buffers. The samples were analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The dialyzed buffer after Chelex treatment was used as a blank, and the residual Zn2+ background was subtracted from the measurement of protein samples. Zn2+ Blotting Assay—Purified R.KpnI and its mutants (0-6 μg) was slot-blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane presoaked in buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). Proper transfer was ascertained by Ponceau-S staining with transferred protein amounts estimated using Quantity One software. After transfer, the membrane was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2 and subsequently washed three times (15 min each) in the same buffer. The membrane was next incubated in buffer containing 30 μCi of 65ZnCl2 (specific activity, 800 mCi/g; BARC, Mumbai) at room temperature for 1 h with gentle rocking. The unbound radioactivity was removed by washing the membrane three times with buffer (20 min each). The membrane was dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Different concentrations of the WT (1-10 nm) and mutant R.KpnI (10-100 nm) were incubated with the 0.2 pmol of end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (20-mer) containing the R.KpnI recognition site in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 25 mm NaCl, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) for 15 min on ice. The free DNA and the enzyme-bound complexes were resolved by 8% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 1× TBE buffer (89 mm Tris-HCl, 89 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA), and then signals were detected by autoradiography. In Vitro DNA Cleavage and Steady-state Kinetic Analysis—Purified R.KpnI and its mutants were incubated with 500 ng of plasmid DNA in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm MgCl2, or 10-100 μm ZnCl2 for 1 h at 37 °C. The cleavage products were analyzed on 1% agarose gel. For kinetic analysis, the purified enzyme was dialyzed against 10 mm EDTA to remove any bound metal ions. Steady-state kinetic time courses with canonical DNA substrates were measured at DNA concentrations of 5-150-fold molar excess over dimeric enzyme (1 nm) in the presence of 100 μm Zn2+. The kinetic parameters were determined as described (22Saravanan M. Kim K. Kanakaraj R. Rao D.N. Nagaraja Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 2777-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism—The wild type R.KpnI and its mutants harboring the C119A, C128A, C171A, and H174A mutations were analyzed by CD. The CD spectra were recorded at 25 °C from 250 to 200 nm using a JASCO J-720 spectropolarimeter and a cuvette of path length 0.2 cm. The spectra were collected at scanning rate of 50 nm/min, and triplicate spectrum readings were collected per sample. All of the samples were base line-corrected before calculations. The buffer used was 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The proteins were at a concentration of 0.2 μg/μl, and the molar ellipticity (θ) was calculated using the equation, θ=θobs×10−3×MrC×l×n×10−2deg dmol−1 cm2 where θobs is the observed ellipticity, Mr is molecular weight, C is concentration (in mg/ml), l is the path length of the cuvette in centimeters, n refers to the number of residues, and deg is degrees. Thermal stability of the protein samples was assessed using CD by following changes in the spectrum with increasing temperature (25-75 °C). A single wavelength (222 nm) was chosen to monitor the protein structure, and the signal at that wavelength is recorded continuously as the temperature is raised. Tryptic Digestion of R.KpnI—Proteolytic digestions of different samples of R.KpnI and its mutants (1 mg/ml) were carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, and at 37 °C using 1% trypsin. 5-μl samples (5 μg) were taken after various time periods, and trypsin was inactivated with buffer containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Samples were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE. R.KpnI Has Two Zn2+ Binding Sites—Sequence analysis and homology modeling of R.KpnI predicted the presence of an unusual CCCH zinc finger motif (20Saravanan M. Kim J.M. Cymerman I.A. Rao D.N. Nagaraja V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 6129-6135Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) different from other previously described commonly found zinc finger motifs (CCCC, CCHH, CCHC). The putative zinc-coordinating residues are shown in the model (Fig. 1B). The arrangement of cysteines and histidine (CCCH) in R.KpnI is rare among zinc finger proteins of prokaryotic origin. To estimate the bound Zn2+, weper-formed atomic absorption spectrometry (Table 1). Extensively dialyzed R.KpnI was found to bind 2 mol of Zn2+/mol of dimer. The dimeric nature of the enzyme has been established before (24Chandrashekaran S. Kim P. Nagaraja V. J. Biosci. 1999; 24: 269-277Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Bound Zn2+ was not replaceable with other metal ions, since even after exhaustive dialysis against a buffer that contained 10 mm MgCl, 2 mol of Zn2+ were still retained in the protein, indicating that the site was inert to exchange by Mg2+. However, when urea-denatured protein was renatured in presence of ZnCl2, the zinc content increased to 4 mol/mol of R.KpnI dimer. Dialysis of this preparation in the presence of MgCl2 resulted in loss of 2 mol of Zn2+ from R.KpnI, indicating the replacement of two of the four Zn2+ ions by Mg2+. The other 2 mol of tightly bound zinc could not be replaced by Mg2+. These results show that R.KpnI monomer possesses two zinc-binding sites; one is replaceable with Mg2+, and another one is not (Table 1).TABLE 1Zn2+ atomic absorption spectroscopy of R.KpnIR.KpnISample preparationZn2+[Zn2+]/[E]μmμm5.0Chelex-treated10.32 ± 0.42.16 ± 0.085.0100 μm ZnCl219.54 ± 1.23.96 ± 0.065.02 mm MgCl29.45 ± 0.41.92 ± 0.085.010 mm EDTA9.74 ± 0.41.95 ± 0.05.08 m urea0.20 ± 0.20.04 ± 0.0 Open table in a new tab Role of the Zn2+ in Structural Integrity—To define the role of zinc atoms in R.KpnI, we compared the DNA binding and cleavage properties of native, zinc-demetalated (renatured in the absence of Zn2+), and zinc-reconstituted enzymes. The zinc-demetalated R.KpnI (the apoenzyme with no Zn2+ bound) did not bind DNA (Fig. 2A). The enzyme had no DNA cleavage activity in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2. Similar experiments were carried out with native and zinc reconstituted R.KpnI (Fig. 2B). The zinc-reconstituted enzyme binds and cleaves the DNA in a promiscuous manner in Mg2+-catalyzed reactions, similar to the native enzyme. To investigate whether the loss of DNA binding and cleavage in Zn2+-demetalated R.KpnI is due to the structural alterations in the protein, we carried out CD analysis. In presence of Zn2+, the far-UV CD spectrum of R.KpnI has two negative maxima at 208 and 222 nm, which is a characteristic of helical conformation. The zinc-demetalated enzyme showed altered secondary structure compared with zinc-reconstituted enzyme, indicating the importance of Zn2+ coordination to maintain the secondary structure of the R.KpnI (Fig. 3A). The stability of these proteins was monitored by CD thermal denaturation. Unfolding profiles were measured at 222 nm, from 30 to 75 °C. The Tm of zinc-reconstituted enzyme was increased by ∼8 °C over the zinc-demetalated enzyme, indicating a role for Zn2+ in stability of the enzyme (Fig. 3B). In accordance with CD spectroscopy and thermal melting experiments, proteolytic experiments also showed that the zinc-demetalated enzyme is more susceptible to trypsin cleavage than the native or zinc-reconstituted enzyme (Fig. 3C). We conclude that Zn2+ is required for stabilization of the enzymatically active R.KpnI conformation.FIGURE 3Structural alterations in R.KpnI. A, CD spectra of R.KpnI. Shown are the mean residue ellipticity of CD spectra for demetalated (dotted line) and zinc-reconstituted R.KpnI (continuous line). Changes in secondary structure were monitored by scanning from 200 to 250 nm. B, temperature-dependent CD measurements (222 nm) for demetalated (dotted line) and zinc-reconstituted R.KpnI (continuous line). All spectra represent the average of three scans using protein concentrations of 0.25 mg/ml. C, trypsin digestion profiles of zinc-reconstituted and zinc-demetalated R.KpnI. The detailed procedure is described under “Experimental Procedures.” The digestion profiles were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The CCCH Motif Is Involved in Zn2+ Coordination and Maintenance of the R.KpnI Structure—To establish that the zinc binding is through the unusual zinc finger motif shown in Fig. 1A, point mutations were generated in R.KpnI. The cysteines (Cys119, Cys128, and Cys171) and histidine (His174) of the putative motif were individually changed into alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant proteins were analyzed for radioactive zinc binding using a zinc blotting assay. All of the alanine replacement mutants failed to bind radioactive zinc (Fig. 4A) in contrast to R.KpnI. Zn2+ has been shown to be essential for the folding and stability of many Zn2+ finger proteins. Zinc blotting experiments indicate that Cys119, Cys128, Cys171, and His174 are responsible for coordinating Zn2+ in R.KpnI. We examined the effect of impairment in Zn2+ coordination on the stability of the enzyme by monitoring the CD thermal melting curves of the alanine replacement mutant proteins. The normalized CD absorbance at 222 nm as a function of temperature for WT and mutants is shown in Fig. 4B. The mutant proteins showed decreased thermal stability compared with that of the WT R.KpnI, indicating that the mutations at the CCCH motif affect the folding of the enzyme. Further, the mutant enzymes showed increased protease susceptibility compared with R.KpnI, confirming the importance of the CCCH motif for the structural stability of the enzyme (Fig. 4C). Effect of CCCH Zn2+ Finger Mutations on DNA Cleavage and Binding—R.KpnI and its mutants were analyzed for the ability to cleave DNA. Under the assay conditions, wherein pUC18 DNA was completely cleaved by 1 nm WT enzyme, there was no cleavage product observed with all the four mutants even at a 100-fold excess of the enzyme (Fig. 4D). To address the cause for the loss of DNA cleavage observed with the mutants, we analyzed the DNA binding ability of the mutants by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The mutants failed to bind the DNA containing R.KpnI recognition sequence (Fig. 4E). The mutants showed no detectable DNA binding and cleavage, due to the loss of the structure as observed in CD thermal melting and proteolytic experiments. These results suggest that the loss of coordination with zinc affected the structural integrity of the protein, concomitantly affecting the activity of the enzyme. The loss of DNA binding and cleavage seen with single amino acid substitution in R.KpnI is a typical characteristic of Zn2+ finger proteins where Zn2+ has a structural role. Specific DNA Cleavage and Suppression of Mg2+- and Mn2+-induced Promiscuous Activity—The atomic absorption spectroscopy analysis of zinc-reconstituted R.KpnI showed that the enzyme binds 4 mol of zinc (Table 1). Among the 4 mol, only 2 mol can be readily replaced with Mg2+. This hints at the possibility of zinc ions binding to the active site to influence the enzymatic properties of R.KpnI in addition to the tight coordination at the CCCH motif. The additional 2 mol of Zn2+ bound replacing the Mg2+ may inhibit DNA cleavage. Surprisingly, the enzyme showed efficient DNA cleavage in the presence of 50 μm Zn2+ (Fig. 5A). To evaluate the role of Zn2+ in the specificity of R.KpnI, we carried out DNA cleavage experiments at higher enzyme concentrations (50-1000 nm) and in the presence of 100 μm Zn2+. Even at such high concentrations of the enzyme, promiscuous cleavage is not detected, unlike in Mg2+-catalyzed reactions (Fig. 5B). In experiments using one of the noncanonical oligonucleotides (GtTACC) as a substrate in the presence of 2 mm Mg2+ or 100 μm Zn2+, the cleavage was observed only with Mg2+, indicating that the enzyme is highly specific in the presence of Zn2+ (Fig. 5C). No detectable DNA cleavage was observed in the presence of Zn2+ with any of the other noncanonical substrates. In the qualitative experiments described above, Zn2+-mediated enzyme activity appeared to be comparable with the activity in the presence of other metal ions. We resorted to kinetic analysis to obtain quantitative information about Zn2+ DNA cleavage. Kinetic analysis in the presence of Zn2+ revealed the turnover number (kcat) of the enzyme to be 2.12 min-1, which is comparable with that of Ca2+ (2.20 min-1), showing that Zn2+-mediated DNA cleavage is as efficient as Ca2+-dependent cleavage (Table 2) (22Saravanan M. Kim K. Kanakaraj R. Rao D.N. Nagaraja Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 2777-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The Km of the enzyme for the canonical sequence with Zn2+ (24 nm) is similar to that of Mg2+ (22 nm). The ability of Zn2+ to replace Mg2+ from the active site and induce specific cleavage suggests that it may suppress the Mg2+-mediated promiscuous activity of the enzyme. Results of Zn2+ chase experiments on Mg2+- or Mn2+-bound enzyme-DNA complex showed that the Mg2+- or Mn2+-mediated promiscuous activity was completely suppressed in the presence of 100 μm Zn2+ (Fig. 5D). The ability of different metal ions to bind the active site indicates the plasticity of the active site. Previous studies revealed that R.KpnI utilizes the HNH motif in its reaction mechanism for Mg2+/Mn2+/Ca2+-mediated DNA cleavage. Residues Asp148, His149, and Gln175 together form the active site and are essential for Mg2+ binding and catalysis (20Saravanan M. Kim J.M. Cymerman I.A. Rao D.N. Nagaraja V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 6129-6135Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The active site mutant enzymes D148G, H149L, and Q175E were analyzed for Zn2+-mediated DNA cleavage (supplemental Fig. 1). Zn2+-mediated cleavage also relies on the same catalytic motif, indicating the inherent flexibility of the R.KpnI active site HNH motif to accommodate Mg2+, Mn2+, Ca2+, and Zn2+. Replacement of the other metal ions from the active site by Zn2+ and retention of the catalytic activity with kinetic constants comparable with those of Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ca2+ indicate that Zn2+ is a cofactor for R.KpnI.TABLE 2Kinetic parameters of R.Kpnl with different divalent metal ionsMetal ionsKmKcatKcat/Kmmmin−1m−1 s−1Zn2+24 ± 1.6 × 10−92.12 ± 0.161.1 ± 0.4 × 106Mg2+aKinetic constants obtained from Saravanan et al.

Open table in a new tab Zinc finger proteins are involved in fundamental cellular processes (viz. replication, transcription, repair, translation, and programmed cell death) (7Laity J.H. Kim B.M. Wright P.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). Zinc finger motifs have also been discovered and implicated in maintenance of the structural architecture in a number of nucleases (9Van Roey P. Kim C.A. Fox K.M. Belfort M. Derbyshire V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3631-3637Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14Vanamee E.S. Kim P. Zhu Z. Yates D. Garman E. Xu S. Aggarwal A.K. J. Mol.

We demonstrate that a sequence motif (119CX8CX42CX2H174) found in R.KpnI is a zinc binding motif. Based on the conserved arrangements of cysteines and/or histidines, several classes of zinc finger families (CCHH, CCCC, CCHC, and CHCC), have been characterized and shown to be involved in interactions with DNA, RNA, or other proteins (27Berg J.M. Kim H.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). CCCH-type zinc fingers were identified in a number of RNA-binding proteins of eukaryotic origin (28Amann B.T. Kim M.T. Berg J.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and also found in Mcm10 protein, which is essential for the formation of active homocomplex (29Cook C.R. Kim G. Peterson F.C. Volkman B.F. Lei M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36051-36058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The arrangement of three cysteines and a histidine in the CCCH zinc finger found in R.KpnI is rare in prokaryotic proteins. The CCCH zinc fingers were identified in replication protein A homologues in different lineages of Euryarcheaota (30Lin Y. Kim J.B. Nayannor E.K. D. Chen Y.H. Cann I.K. O. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 7881-7889Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), RPA41 from Pyrococcus furiosus (31Komori K. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25654-25660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and 50 S ribosomal protein L36 from Thermus thermophilus (32Boysen R.I. Kim M.W. J. Pept. Res. 2001; 57: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). R.KpnI thus is a new member of the CCCH Zn2+ finger family and is the first REase to have this motif. The Zn2+ fingers in other members having this motif listed above have varied roles in protein-protein interactions, protein-nucleic acid interactions, structural integrity, and folding. From the results presented in Fig. 2, it is clear that tightly bound Zn2+ has a structural role, since it supports Mg2+-mediated promiscuous cleavage. The second Zn2+ atom, which is loosely bound to the active site, imparts catalytic function. A peculiar characteristic of R.KpnI is its highly promiscuous behavior in the presence of Mg2+ not seen with any other REase (21Chandrashekaran S. Kim M. Radha D.R. Nagaraja V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49736-49740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The Mg2+ (and Mn2+)-mediated promiscuous cleavage by R.KpnI is completely suppressed by Zn2+ meanwhile, inducing the high fidelity cleavage. The architectural plasticity of the R.KpnI active site allows the binding of Mg2+, Mn2+, Ca2+, or Zn2+, which have different coordination chemistry and geometry to induce promiscuous or specific cleavage. Thus, in R.KpnI, Zn2+ has both structural and catalytic roles, together not found in any enzyme so far. The tightly bound Zn2+ at the CCCH motif imparts structural integrity for the enzyme, whereas the readily exchangeable Zn2+ at the active site induces high specificity cleavage. Finally, Zn2+ finger motifs as such appear to be extremely rare in nucleases of prokaryotic origin. Although the HNH motif is commonly found in diverse classes of nucleases, the zinc finger motifs are found only in McrA, I-PpoI, and T4 endonuclease VII belonging to the superfamily. Although the Cys4 zinc finger of T4 endonuclease VII has a structural role, the function of similar zinc finger in McrA is not known. The two Zn2+ fingers (CCCH and CCHC) in I-PpoI are also important for structural stabilization of the protein core. The catalytic and structural role for Zn2+ in R.KpnI hints at its distant origin and possibly additional yet unknown function in Klebsiella pneumoniae. We thank J. M. Bujnicki for the R.KpnI modeling and the Departments of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics and Solid State Chemistry Units for circular dichroism, fluorometry, and atomic absorption spectrometry, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W1978516023,"Background In environmental sequencing projects, a mix of DNA from a whole microbial community is fragmented and sequenced, with one of the possible goals being to reconstruct partial or complete genomes of members of the community. In communities with high diversity of species, a significant proportion of the sequences do not overlap any other fragment in the sample. This problem will arise not only in situations with a relatively even distribution of many species, but also when the community in a particular environment is routinely dominated by the same few species. In the former case, no genomes may be assembled at all, while in the latter case a few dominant species in an environment will always be sequenced at high coverage to the detriment of coverage of the greater number of sparse species. Methods and Results Here we show that, with the same global sequencing effort, separating the species into two or more sub-communities prior to sequencing can yield a much higher proportion of sequences that can be assembled. We first use the Lander-Waterman model to show that, if the expected percentage of singleton sequences is higher than 25%, then, under the uniform distribution hypothesis, splitting the community is always a wise choice. We then construct simulated microbial communities to show that the results hold for highly non-uniform distributions. We also show that, for the distributions considered in the experiments, it is possible to estimate quite accurately the relative diversity of the two sub-communities. Conclusion Given the fact that several methods exist to split microbial communities based on physical properties such as size, density, surface biochemistry, or optical properties, we strongly suggest that groups involved in environmental sequencing, and expecting high diversity, consider splitting their communities in order to maximize the information content of their sequencing effort."

Clearly, a more thorough understanding of the effector phase of T cell responses, within the tumor site itself, would be beneficial. To examine this issue, we adoptively transferred tumor antigen-specific effector T cells into tumor-bearing mice, then performed kinetic evaluations of their phenotype, function, and survival in tumors, draining lymph nodes (dLNs), and spleens during regression of murine fibrosarcomas. Effector function in tumors was quantitated through the use of a novel intratumoral cytolytic assay. This approach revealed dynamic changes in the phenotype, cytolytic capacity, and viability of tumor infiltrating effector T cells during the course of tumor regression. Over a period of days, T cells within tumors rapidly transitioned from a CD25hi/CD27hi to a CD25low/CD27low phenotype and displayed an increase in cytolytic capacity, indicative of effector maturation. Simultaneously, however, the viability of maturing T cells within tumors diminished. In contrast, transferred T cells trafficking through lymphoid organs were much more static, as they maintained a stable phenotype, robust cytolytic activity, and high viability. Therefore, there exists a marked phenotypic and functional divergence between tumor-infiltrating effector T cells and their counterparts in lymphoid organs. Our results indicate that the population of tumor-infiltrating T cells is unique in experiencing rapid effector maturation post-transfer, and suggest that strategies aimed at prolonging the survival of CD25low/CD27low full effectors, which displayed the highest levels of intratumoral cytolytic activity, should enhance the efficacy of T cell based tumor immunotherapies."
