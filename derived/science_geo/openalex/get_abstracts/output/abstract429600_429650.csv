https://openalex.org/W2098816950,"The rapid disruption of tropical forests probably imperils global biodiversity more than any other contemporary phenomenon. With deforestation advancing quickly, protected areas are increasingly becoming final refuges for threatened species and natural ecosystem processes. However, many protected areas in the tropics are themselves vulnerable to human encroachment and other environmental stresses. As pressures mount, it is vital to know whether existing reserves can sustain their biodiversity. A critical constraint in addressing this question has been that data describing a broad array of biodiversity groups have been unavailable for a sufficiently large and representative sample of reserves. Here we present a uniquely comprehensive data set on changes over the past 20 to 30 years in 31 functional groups of species and 21 potential drivers of environmental change, for 60 protected areas stratified across the world’s major tropical regions. Our analysis reveals great variation in reserve ‘health’: about half of all reserves have been effective or performed passably, but the rest are experiencing an erosion of biodiversity that is often alarmingly widespread taxonomically and functionally. Habitat disruption, hunting and forest-product exploitation were the strongest predictors of declining reserve health. Crucially, environmental changes immediately outside reserves seemed nearly as important as those inside in determining their ecological fate, with changes inside reserves strongly mirroring those occurring around them. These findings suggest that tropical protected areas are often intimately linked ecologically to their surrounding habitats, and that a failure to stem broad-scale loss and degradation of such habitats could sharply increase the likelihood of serious biodiversity declines."
https://openalex.org/W2167532631,"Medulloblastoma is the most common brain tumour in children; using whole-genome sequencing of tumour samples the authors show that the clinically challenging Group 3 and 4 tumours can be tetraploid, and reveal the expression of the first medulloblastoma fusion genes identified. Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumour in children. Four papers published in the 2 August 2012 issue of Nature use whole-genome and other sequencing techniques to produce a detailed picture of the genetics and genomics of this condition. Notable findings include the identification of recurrent mutations in genes not previously implicated in medulloblastoma, with significant genetic differences associated with the four biologically distinct subgroups and clinical outcomes in each. Potential avenues for therapy are suggested by the identification of targetable somatic copy-number alterations, including recurrent events targeting TGFβ signalling in Group 3, and NF-κB signalling in Group 4 medulloblastomas. Medulloblastoma is an aggressively growing tumour, arising in the cerebellum or medulla/brain stem. It is the most common malignant brain tumour in children, and shows tremendous biological and clinical heterogeneity1. Despite recent treatment advances, approximately 40% of children experience tumour recurrence, and 30% will die from their disease. Those who survive often have a significantly reduced quality of life. Four tumour subgroups with distinct clinical, biological and genetic profiles are currently identified2,3. WNT tumours, showing activated wingless pathway signalling, carry a favourable prognosis under current treatment regimens4. SHH tumours show hedgehog pathway activation, and have an intermediate prognosis2. Group 3 and 4 tumours are molecularly less well characterized, and also present the greatest clinical challenges2,3,5. The full repertoire of genetic events driving this distinction, however, remains unclear. Here we describe an integrative deep-sequencing analysis of 125 tumour–normal pairs, conducted as part of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) PedBrain Tumor Project. Tetraploidy was identified as a frequent early event in Group 3 and 4 tumours, and a positive correlation between patient age and mutation rate was observed. Several recurrent mutations were identified, both in known medulloblastoma-related genes (CTNNB1, PTCH1, MLL2, SMARCA4) and in genes not previously linked to this tumour (DDX3X, CTDNEP1, KDM6A, TBR1), often in subgroup-specific patterns. RNA sequencing confirmed these alterations, and revealed the expression of what are, to our knowledge, the first medulloblastoma fusion genes identified. Chromatin modifiers were frequently altered across all subgroups. These findings enhance our understanding of the genomic complexity and heterogeneity underlying medulloblastoma, and provide several potential targets for new therapeutics, especially for Group 3 and 4 patients."
https://openalex.org/W2082080058,"Medulloblastoma, the most common malignant paediatric brain tumour, is currently treated with nonspecific cytotoxic therapies including surgery, whole-brain radiation, and aggressive chemotherapy. As medulloblastoma exhibits marked intertumoural heterogeneity, with at least four distinct molecular variants, previous attempts to identify targets for therapy have been underpowered because of small samples sizes. Here we report somatic copy number aberrations (SCNAs) in 1,087 unique medulloblastomas. SCNAs are common in medulloblastoma, and are predominantly subgroup-enriched. The most common region of focal copy number gain is a tandem duplication of SNCAIP, a gene associated with Parkinson’s disease, which is exquisitely restricted to Group 4α. Recurrent translocations of PVT1, including PVT1-MYC and PVT1-NDRG1, that arise through chromothripsis are restricted to Group 3. Numerous targetable SCNAs, including recurrent events targeting TGF-β signalling in Group 3, and NF-κB signalling in Group 4, suggest future avenues for rational, targeted therapy. Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumour in children; having assembled over 1,000 samples the authors report that somatic copy number aberrations are common in medulloblastoma, in particular a tandem duplication of SNCAIP, a gene associated with Parkinson’s disease, which is restricted to subgroup 4α, and translocations of PVT1, which are restricted to Group 3. Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumour in children.

https://openalex.org/W1973337266,"The realization of strong nonlinear interactions between individual light quanta (photons) is a long-standing goal in optical science and engineering, being of both fundamental and technological significance. In conventional optical materials, the nonlinearity at light powers corresponding to single photons is negligibly weak. Here we demonstrate a medium that is nonlinear at the level of individual quanta, exhibiting strong absorption of photon pairs while remaining transparent to single photons. The quantum nonlinearity is obtained by coherently coupling slowly propagating photons to strongly interacting atomic Rydberg states in a cold, dense atomic gas. Our approach paves the way for quantum-by-quantum control of light fields, including single-photon switching, all-optical deterministic quantum logic and the realization of strongly correlated many-body states of light."
https://openalex.org/W2158060605,"Cardiovascular death commonly occurs in patients with chronic kidney disease. Indoxyl sulfate (IS), a uremic toxin, has been demonstrated in vitro as a contributory factor in cardiac fibrosis, a typical pathological finding in uremic cardiomyopathy. This study aimed to determine if cardiac fibrosis is reversible by lowering serum IS levels using an oral charcoal adsorbent, AST-120. Subtotal-nephrectomized (5/6-STNx) Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to receive either AST-120 (AST-120, n = 13) or no treatment (vehicle, n = 17) for 12 weeks. Sham operated rats (n = 12) were used as controls. Early left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction was demonstrated by an increase in peak velocity of atrial filling [A and A’ waves] and a decrease of E/A and E’/A’ ratios obtained by echocardiography. This was accompanied by a 4.5-fold increase in serum IS (p<0.001) as well as elevated tail-cuff blood pressure (p<0.001) and heart weight (p<0.001). Increased LV fibrosis (p<0.001), gene expression of pro-fibrotic (TGF-β, CTGF) and hypertrophic (ANP, β-MHC and α-skeletal muscle actin) markers, as well as TGF-β and phosphorylated NF-κB protein expression were observed in STNx + vehicle rats. Treatment with AST-120 reduced serum creatinine (by 54%, p<0.05) and urine total protein (by 27%, p<0.05) vs vehicle whilst having no effect on blood pressure (AST-120 = 227±11 vs vehicle = 224±8 mmHg, ns) and heart weight. The increase in serum IS was prevented with AST-120 (by 100%, p<0.001) which was accompanied by reduced LV fibrosis (68%, p<0.01) and TGF-β and phosphorylated NF-κB protein expression (back to sham levels, p<0.05) despite no significant change in LV function. In conclusion, STNx resulted in increased cardiac fibrosis and circulating IS levels. Reduction of IS with AST-120 normalizes cardiac fibrosis, in a blood pressure independent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2000626262,"Chromatin insulators are DNA elements that regulate the level of gene expression either by preventing gene silencing through the maintenance of heterochromatin boundaries or by preventing gene activation by blocking interactions between enhancers and promoters. CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), a ubiquitously expressed 11-zinc-finger DNA-binding protein, is the only protein implicated in the establishment of insulators in vertebrates. While CTCF has been implicated in diverse regulatory functions, CTCF has only been studied in a limited number of cell types across human genome. Thus, it is not clear whether the identified cell type-specific differences in CTCF-binding sites are functionally significant. Here, we identify and characterize cell type-specific and ubiquitous CTCF-binding sites in the human genome across 38 cell types designated by the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) consortium. These cell type-specific and ubiquitous CTCF-binding sites show uniquely versatile transcriptional functions and characteristic chromatin features. In addition, we confirm the insulator barrier function of CTCF-binding and explore the novel function of CTCF in DNA replication. These results represent a critical step toward the comprehensive and systematic understanding of CTCF-dependent insulators and their versatile roles in the human genome."
https://openalex.org/W2036638163,"Starting in 2003, numerous studies using culture-independent methodologies to characterize the gut microbiota of honey bees have retrieved a consistent and distinctive set of eight bacterial species, based on near identity of the 16S rRNA gene sequences. A recent study [Mattila HR, Rios D, Walker-Sperling VE, Roeselers G, Newton ILG (2012) Characterization of the active microbiotas associated with honey bees reveals healthier and broader communities when colonies are genetically diverse. PLoS ONE 7(3): e32962], using pyrosequencing of the V1-V2 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene, reported finding entirely novel bacterial species in honey bee guts, and used taxonomic assignments from these reads to predict metabolic activities based on known metabolisms of cultivable species. To better understand this discrepancy, we analyzed the Mattila et al. pyrotag dataset. In contrast to the conclusions of Mattila et al., we found that the large majority of pyrotag sequences belonged to clusters for which representative sequences were identical to sequences from previously identified core species of the bee microbiota. On average, they represent 95% of the bacteria in each worker bee in the Mattila et al. dataset, a slightly lower value than that found in other studies. Some colonies contain small proportions of other bacteria, mostly species of Enterobacteriaceae. Reanalysis of the Mattila et al. dataset also did not support a relationship between abundances of Bifidobacterium and of putative pathogens or a significant difference in gut communities between colonies from queens that were singly or multiply mated. Additionally, consistent with previous studies, the dataset supports the occurrence of considerable strain variation within core species, even within single colonies. The roles of these bacteria within bees, or the implications of the strain variation, are not yet clear."
https://openalex.org/W2031688387,"Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is considered to be the primary causative agent of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), which has become a serious economic problem for the swine industry worldwide. The major genotypes, PCV2a and PCV2b, are highly prevalent in the pig population and are present worldwide. However, another newly emerging PCV2b genotype mutant, which has a mutation in its ORF2-encoded capsid protein, has been sporadically present in China, as well as in other countries. It is therefore important to determine the relative virulence of the newly emerging PCV2b genotype mutant, compared with the existing PCV2a and PCV2b genotypes, and to investigate whether the newly emerging mutant virus induces more severe illness.Twenty healthy, 30-day-old, commercial piglets served as controls or were challenged with PCV2a, PCV2b and the newly emerging mutant virus. A series of indexes representing different parameters were adopted to evaluate virulence, including clinical signs, serological detection, viral load and distribution, changes in immune cell subsets in the peripheral blood, and evaluation of pathological lesions. The newly emerging PCV2 mutant demonstrated more severe signs compatible with PMWS, characterized by wasting, coughing, dyspnea, diarrhea, rough hair-coat and depression. Moreover, the pathological lesions and viremia, as well as the viral loads in lymph nodes, tonsils and spleen, were significantly more severe (P<0.05) for piglets challenged with the newly emerging mutant compared with those in the groups challenged with PCV2a and PCV2b. In addition, a significantly lower average daily weight gain (P<0.05) was recorded in the group challenged with the newly emerging PCV2 mutant than in the groups challenged with the prevailing PCV2a and PCV2b.This is believed to be the first report to confirm the enhanced virulence of the newly emerging PCV2 mutant in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2004690526,"Bacteria play critical roles in marine nutrient cycles by incorporating and redistributing dissolved organic matter (DOM) and inorganic nutrients in the ocean. TonB-dependent transporter (TBDT) proteins allow Gram-negative bacteria to take up scarce resources from nutrient-limiting environments as well as siderophores, heme, vitamin B12, and recently identified carbohydrates. Thus, the characterization of TBDT distribution and functions is essential to better understand the contribution TBDT to DOM assimilation and its consequences on nutrient cycling in the environment.This study presents the distribution of encoded known and putative TBDT proteins in the genomes of microorganisms and from the Global Ocean Survey data. Using a Lek clustering algorithm and substrate specificities, the TBDT sequences were mainly classified into the following three groups: (1) DOM transporters; (2) Siderophores/Vitamins transporters; and (3) Heme/Hemophores/Iron(heme)-binding protein transporters. Diverse TBDTs were found in the genomes of oligotroph Citromicrobium bathyomarinum JL354 and Citromicrobium sp JLT1363 and were highly expressed in the stationary phase of bacterial growth. The results show that the Gammaproteobacteria and the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides (CFB) group bacteria accounted for the majority of the TBDT gene pool in marine surface waters.The results of this study confirm the ecological importance of TBDTs in DOM assimilation for bacteria in marine environments owing to a wide range of substrate utilization potential in the ubiquitous Gammaproteobacteria and CFB group bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2149895384,"NOD2, the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing gene family (NLR) member 2 is involved in mediating antimicrobial responses. Dysfunctional NOD2 activity can lead to severe inflammatory disorders, but the regulation of NOD2 is still poorly understood. Recently, proteins of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family have emerged as regulators of innate immune responses by acting as E3 ubiquitin ligases. We identified TRIM27 as a new specific binding partner for NOD2. We show that NOD2 physically interacts with TRIM27 via the nucleotide-binding domain, and that NOD2 activation enhances this interaction. Dependent on functional TRIM27, ectopically expressed NOD2 is ubiquitinated with K48-linked ubiquitin chains followed by proteasomal degradation. Accordingly, TRIM27 affects NOD2-mediated pro-inflammatory responses. NOD2 mutations are linked to susceptibility to Crohn's disease. We found that TRIM27 expression is increased in Crohn's disease patients, underscoring a physiological role of TRIM27 in regulating NOD2 signaling. In HeLa cells, TRIM27 is partially localized in the nucleus. We revealed that ectopically expressed NOD2 can shuttle to the nucleus in a Walker A dependent manner, suggesting that NOD2 and TRIM27 might functionally cooperate in the nucleus. We conclude that TRIM27 negatively regulates NOD2-mediated signaling by degradation of NOD2 and suggest that TRIM27 could be a new target for therapeutic intervention in NOD2-associated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2005556840,"Background Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) of the Beaufort Sea enter hyperphagia in spring and gain fat reserves to survive periods of low prey availability. We collected information on seals killed by polar bears (n = 650) and hunting attempts on ringed seal (Pusa hispida) lairs (n = 1396) observed from a helicopter during polar bear mark-recapture studies in the eastern Beaufort Sea in spring in 1985–2011. We investigated how temporal shifts in ringed seal reproduction affect kill composition and the intraspecific vulnerabilities of ringed seals to polar bear predation. Principal Findings Polar bears primarily preyed on ringed seals (90.2%) while bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) only comprised 9.8% of the kills, but 33% of the biomass. Adults comprised 43.6% (150/344) of the ringed seals killed, while their pups comprised 38.4% (132/344). Juvenile ringed seals were killed at the lowest proportion, comprising 18.0% (62/344) of the ringed seal kills. The proportion of ringed seal pups was highest between 2007–2011, in association with high ringed seal productivity. Half of the adult ringed seal kills were ≥21 years (60/121), and kill rates of adults increased following the peak of parturition. Determination of sex from DNA revealed that polar bears killed adult male and adult female ringed seals equally (0.50, n = 78). The number of hunting attempts at ringed seal subnivean lair sites was positively correlated with the number of pup kills (r2 = 0.30, P = 0.04), but was not correlated with the number of adult kills (P = 0.37). Conclusions/Significance Results are consistent with decadal trends in ringed seal productivity, with low numbers of pups killed by polar bears in spring in years of low pup productivity, and conversely when pup productivity was high. Vulnerability of adult ringed seals to predation increased in relation to reproductive activities and age, but not gender."
https://openalex.org/W1983042902,"Successful vaccine development against HIV will likely require the induction of strong, long-lasting humoral and cellular immune responses in both the systemic and mucosal compartments. Based on the known immunological linkage between the upper-respiratory and urogenital tracts, we explored the potential of nasal adjuvants to boost immunization for the induction of vaginal and systemic immune responses to gp140. Mice were immunized intranasally with HIV gp140 together with micellar and emulsion formulations of a synthetic TLR4 agonist, Glucopyranosyl Lipid Adjuvant (GLA) and responses were compared to R848, a TLR7/8 agonist, or chitosan, a non TLR adjuvant. GLA and chitosan but not R848 greatly enhanced serum immunoglobulin levels when compared to antigen alone. Both GLA and chitosan induced high IgG and IgA titers in nasal and vaginal lavage and feces. The high IgA and IgG titers in vaginal lavage were associated with high numbers of gp140-specific antibody secreting cells in the genital tract. Whilst both GLA and chitosan induced T cell responses to immunization, GLA induced a stronger Th17 response and chitosan induced a more Th2 skewed response. Our results show that GLA is a highly potent intranasal adjuvant greatly enhancing humoral and cellular immune responses, both systemically and mucosally."
https://openalex.org/W1963749123,"Aging of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells of the eye is marked by accumulations of bisretinoid fluorophores; two of the compounds within this lipofuscin mixture are A2E and all-trans-retinal dimer. These pigments are implicated in pathological mechanisms involved in some vision-threatening disorders including age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Studies have shown that bisretinoids are photosensitive compounds that undergo photooxidation and photodegradation when irradiated with short wavelength visible light. Utilizing ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) we demonstrate that photodegradation of A2E and all-trans-retinal dimer generates the dicarbonyls glyoxal (GO) and methylglyoxal (MG), that are known to modify proteins by advanced glycation endproduct (AGE) formation. By extracellular trapping with aminoguanidine, we established that these oxo-aldehydes are released from irradiated A2E-containing RPE cells. Enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays (ELISA) revealed that the substrate underlying A2E-containing RPE was AGE-modified after irradiation. This AGE deposition was suppressed by prior treatment of the cells with aminoguanidine. AGE-modification causes structural and functional impairment of proteins. In chronic diseases such as diabetes and atherosclerosis, MG and GO modify proteins by non-enzymatic glycation and oxidation reactions. AGE-modified proteins are also components of drusen, the sub-RPE deposits that confer increased risk of AMD onset. These results indicate that photodegraded RPE bisretinoid is likely to be a previously unknown source of MG and GO in the eye."
https://openalex.org/W1997492667,"Environmental conditions, including anthropogenic disturbance, can significantly alter host and parasite communities. Yet, our current knowledge is based mainly on endoparasites, while ectoparasites remain little studied. We studied the indirect effects of anthropogenic disturbance (human population density) and climate (temperature, precipitation and elevation) on abundance of highly host-specific bat flies in four Neotropical bat species across 43 localities in Venezuela. We formulated a set of 11 a priori hypotheses that included a combination of the two effectors and host species. Statistically, each of these hypotheses was represented by a zero-inflated negative binomial mixture model, allowing us to control for excess zeros in the data. The best model was selected using Akaike's information criteria. Fly abundance was affected by anthropogenic disturbance in Artibeus planirostris, Carollia perspicillata and Pteronotus parnellii, but not Desmodus rotundus. Climate affected fly abundance in all bat species, suggesting mediation of these effects via the host or by direct effects on flies. We conclude that human disturbance may play a role in shaping bat-bat fly interactions. Different processes could determine fly abundance in the different bat species."
https://openalex.org/W2041544427,"Trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular domain of the HER2 oncoprotein, can effectively target HER2-positive breast cancer through several mechanisms. Although the effects of trastuzumab on cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis and apoptosis have been investigated in depth, the effect of trastuzumab on microRNA (miRNA) has not been extensively studied. We have performed miRNA microarray profiling before and after trastuzumab treatment in SKBr3 and BT474 human breast cancer cells that overexpress HER2. We found that trastuzumab treatment of SKBr3 cells significantly decreased five miRNAs and increased three others, whereas treatment of BT474 cells significantly decreased two miRNAs and increased nine. The only change in miRNA expression observed in both cell lines following trastuzumab treatment was upregulation of miRNA-194 (miR-194) that was further validated in vitro and in vivo. Forced expression of miR-194 in breast cancer cells that overexpress HER2 produced no effect on apoptosis, modest inhibition of proliferation, significant inhibition of cell migration/invasion in vitro and significant inhibition of xenograft growth in vivo. Conversely, knockdown of miR-194 promoted cell migration. Increased miR-194 expression markedly reduced levels of the cytoskeletal protein talin2 and specifically inhibited luciferase reporter activity of a talin2 wild-type 3′-untranslated region, but not that of a mutant reporter, indicating that talin2 is a direct downstream target of miR-194. Trastuzumab treatment inhibited breast cancer cell migration and reduced talin2 expression in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of talin2 inhibited cell migration/invasion. Knockdown of trastuzumab-induced miR-194 expression with a miR-194 inhibitor compromised trastuzumab-inhibited cell migration in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Consequently, trastuzumab treatment upregulates miR-194 expression and may exert its cell migration-inhibitory effect through miR-194-mediated downregulation of cytoskeleton protein talin2 in HER2-overexpressing human breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2006584824,"Both resistance and tolerance, which are two strategies that plants use to limit biotic stress, are affected by the abiotic environment including atmospheric CO2 levels. We tested the hypothesis that elevated CO2 would reduce resistance (i.e., the ability to prevent damage) but enhance tolerance (i.e., the ability to regrow and compensate for damage after the damage has occurred) of tomato plants to the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera. The results showed that elevated CO2 reduced resistance by decreasing the jasmonic acid (JA) level and activities of lipoxygenase, proteinase inhibitors, and polyphenol oxidase in wild-type (WT) plants infested with H. armigera. Consequently, the activities of total protease, trypsin-like enzymes, and weak and active alkaline trypsin-like enzymes increased in the midgut of H. armigera when fed on WT plants grown under elevated CO2. Unexpectedly, the tolerance of the WT to H. armigera (in terms of photosynthetic rate, activity of sucrose phosphate synthases, flower number, and plant biomass and height) was also reduced by elevated CO2. Under ambient CO2, the expression of resistance and tolerance to H. armigera was much greater in wild type than in spr2 (a JA-deficient genotype) plants, but elevated CO2 reduced these differences of the resistance and tolerance between WT and spr2 plants. The results suggest that the JA signaling pathway contributes to both plant resistance and tolerance to herbivorous insects and that by suppressing the JA signaling pathway, elevated CO2 will simultaneously reduce the resistance and tolerance of tomato plants."
https://openalex.org/W2041908811,"Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels by sprouting from pre-existing ones, is critical for the establishment and maintenance of complex tissues. Angiogenesis is usually triggered by soluble growth factors such as VEGF. However, geometrical cues also play an important role in this process. Here we report the induction of angiogenesis solely by SVVYGLR peptide micropatterning on polymer surfaces. SVVYGLR peptide stripes were micropatterned onto polymer surfaces by photolithography to study their effects on endothelial cell (EC) behavior. Our results showed that the EC behaviors (cell spreading, orientation and migration) were significantly more guided and regulated on narrower SVVYGLR micropatterns (10 and 50 µm) than on larger stripes (100 µm). Also, EC morphogenesis into tube formation was switched on onto the smaller patterns. We illustrated that the central lumen of tubular structures can be formed by only one-to-four cells due to geometrical constraints on the micropatterns which mediated cell-substrate adhesion and generated a correct maturation of adherens junctions. In addition, sprouting of ECs and vascular networks were also induced by geometrical cues on surfaces micropatterned with SVVYGLR peptides. These micropatterned surfaces provide opportunities for mimicking angiogenesis by peptide modification instead of exogenous growth factors. The organization of ECs into tubular structures and the induction of sprouting angiogenesis are important towards the fabrication of vascularized tissues, and this work has great potential applications in tissue engineering and tissue regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2064595165,"Apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA1) is a micronemal protein of apicomplexan parasites that appears to be essential during the invasion of host cells. In this study, a full-length cDNA of AMA1 was identified from Eimeria tenella (Et) using expressed sequence tag and the rapid amplification of cDNA ends technique. EtAMA1 had an open reading frame of 1608 bp encoding a protein of 535 amino acids. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that EtAMA1 was expressed at higher levels in sporozoites than in the other developmental stages (unsporulated oocysts, sporulated oocysts and second-generation merozoites). The ectodomain sequence was expressed as recombinant EtAMA1 (rEtAMA1) and rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the rEtAMA1 recognized a 58-kDa native parasite protein by Western Blotting and had a potent inhibitory effect on parasite invasion, decreasing it by approximately 70%. Immunofluorescence analysis and immunohistochemistry analysis showed EtAMA1 might play an important role in sporozoite invasion and development."
https://openalex.org/W2045517809,"Why some species become successful invaders is an important issue in invasive biology. However, limited genomic resources make it very difficult for identifying candidate genes involved in invasiveness. Mikania micrantha H.B.K. (Asteraceae), one of the world's most invasive weeds, has adapted rapidly in response to novel environments since its introduction to southern China. In its genome, we expect to find outlier loci under selection for local adaptation, critical to dissecting the molecular mechanisms of invasiveness. An explorative amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) genome scan was used to detect candidate loci under selection in 28 M. micrantha populations across its entire introduced range in southern China. We also estimated population genetic parameters, bottleneck signatures, and linkage disequilibrium. In binary characters, such as presence or absence of AFLP bands, if all four character combinations are present, it is referred to as a character incompatibility. Since character incompatibility is deemed to be rare in populations with extensive asexual reproduction, a character incompatibility analysis was also performed in order to infer the predominant mating system in the introduced M. micrantha populations. Out of 483 AFLP loci examined using stringent significance criteria, 14 highly credible outlier loci were identified by Dfdist and Bayescan. Moreover, remarkable genetic variation, multiple introductions, substantial bottlenecks and character compatibility were found to occur in M. micrantha. Thus local adaptation at the genome level indeed exists in M. micrantha, and may represent a major evolutionary mechanism of successful invasion. Interactions between genetic diversity, multiple introductions, and reproductive modes contribute to increase the capacity of adaptive evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2079236688,"The molecular mechanisms that regulate the endothelial response during transendothelial migration (TEM) of invasive cancer cells remain elusive. Tyrosine phosphorylation of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cad) has been implicated in the disruption of endothelial cell adherens junctions and in the diapedesis of metastatic cancer cells. We sought to determine the signaling mechanisms underlying the disruption of endothelial adherens junctions after the attachment of invasive breast cancer cells. Attachment of invasive breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) to human umbilical vein endothelial cells induced tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cad, dissociation of β-catenin from VE-cad, and retraction of endothelial cells. Breast cancer cell-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cad was mediated by activation of the H-Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade and depended on the phosphorylation of endothelial myosin light chain (MLC). The inhibition of H-Ras or MLC in endothelial cells inhibited TEM of MDA-MB-231 cells. VE-cad tyrosine phosphorylation in endothelial cells induced by the attachment of MDA-MB-231 cells was mediated by MDA-MB-231 α2β1 integrin.

Our study showed that the MDA-MB-231 cell-induced disruption of endothelial adherens junction integrity is triggered by MDA-MB-231 cell α2β1 integrin and is mediated by H-Ras/MLC-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cad. Tumor cell migration depends on the invasive capacity of tumor cells and their ability to breach the endothelial cell barrier. During the process of hematogenous metastasis, circulating tumor cells must overcome the endothelial barrier to extravasate. However, the precise molecular mechanism of tumor cell extravasation has been poorly defined. A widely supported model is that the adhesion of tumor cells to the endothelium or the secretion of growth factors by cancer cells disrupts the integrity of endothelial barrier function. The integrity of the vascular endothelium is primarily dependent upon the organization of interendothelial adherens junctions. These junctions are formed by the homotypic interaction of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cad), 2The abbreviations used are: VE-cadvascular endothelial cadherinHUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cellMLCmyosin light chainTEMtransendothelial migrationDNdominant negative. which is a transmembrane protein that forms a complex with an intracellular protein network, including α-, β-, and γ-catenin. VE-cad is found specifically in endothelial cell adherens junctions and may play fundamental roles in controlling transport across the endothelial barrier and in regulating angiogenesis (1Akiyama S.K.

To maintain endothelial barrier function, VE-cad activity is tightly regulated through mechanisms that involve protein phosphorylation and cytoskeletal dynamics. Phosphorylation of VE-cad on Tyr residues disrupts endothelial cell adherens junctions by causing the dissociation of catenins from VE-cad, facilitating the diapedesis of leukocytes and metastatic cancer cells (3Alcaide P.

Previously, the endothelium has been shown to act as a protective barrier against the invasion of cancer cells and, hence, metastasis (6Van Sluis G.L. Niers T.M. Esmon C.T. Tigchelaar W. Richel D.J.

Transmigrating tumor cells are thought to overcome the endothelial barrier by inducing changes in endothelial cells, including the reorganization of the cytoskeleton (7Rousseau S. Houle F. Landry J.

Oncol. 2002; 128: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, the validity of this paradigm has recently been called into question. Endothelial cells have been shown to modulate the invasiveness of several types of cancer cells by increasing their dissemination through vessels (10Kedrin D. Gligorijevic B. Wyckoff J.

Most previous studies regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor cell metastasis have focused on the role of cancer cells, whereas the mechanisms that protect endothelial barrier integrity during the diapedesis of metastatic cancer cells remain elusive. In our study, we explored the molecular pathways that regulate the disruption of endothelial barrier function after the attachment of invasive breast cancer cells. Tumor cell invasion may closely resemble leukocyte trafficking, in which the endothelium acts as a barrier and greatly reduces invasion rates (13Wittchen E.S. Worthylake R.A. Kelly P. Casey P.J.

Recently, we identified signal transduction pathways that regulate the transendothelial migration (TEM) of monocytes (14Haidari M. Zhang W. Chen Z. Ganjehei L. Warier N. Vanderslice P. Dixon R.

Res. 2011; 92: 456-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the present study, we determined that the attachment of invasive breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 cells) to endothelial cells leads to the disorganization of adherens junction structure and Tyr phosphorylation of VE-cad. Furthermore, we characterized the mechanisms underlying these events by identifying roles for α2β1 integrin, endothelial H-Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling, and myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation. Phospho-specific and nonphospho-specific antibodies against Src (Tyr(P)-416), Pyk2 (Tyr(P)-402), β-catenin, and ERK1/2 were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA).

Cell Physiol. 2005; 289: C68-C81Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). siRNA and TaqMan primers and probes for Src, Pyk2 (PTK2B), β1, β2, αvβ3, and α2–6 integrin subunits were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7), and human ovarian and prostatic cancer cells (PC-3) were purchased from ATCC. HUVECs were grown in Lonza EGM-2-MV medium on collagen-coated (20 μg/ml) tissue culture dishes. HUVECs from fewer than 4 generations were used for all experiments. The cancer cells were maintained in DMEM medium with 10% heat-inactivated FCS. Tumor cells were detached from a 75-mm flask by trypsin and were then added to a monolayer of HUVECs (3 × 106 cancer cells/1 × 106 HUVECs). There was a firm adhesion of cancer cells to HUVECs 10 min after the addition (the cancer cells were not detached from HUVECs after vigorously washing with PBS). To avoid the contamination of HUVEC lysates with cancer cells, the maximum time allowed for the interaction of cancer cells with HUVECs was 7 min. HUVECs were grown to confluence in 35-mmol/liter dishes or 6-well plates. Cells were extracted in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, which contained 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mmol/liter sodium phosphate, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 2 mmol/liter EDTA, 50 mmol/liter NaF, 5 mmol/liter sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1 mmol/liter sodium vanadate, 2 mmol/liter PMSF, 0.1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 100 KIU/ml aprotinin. Samples were loaded onto an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and run at 150 V for 1 h. The proteins were then transferred onto nitrocellulose paper at 300 mA for 1.5 h, followed by Western blot analysis. Blots were blocked with 5% dry milk in 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:500 to 1:1000. All antibodies were added for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the appropriate secondary antibodies (Pierce) were added at a dilution of 1:10,000 for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing, blots were developed with the SuperSignal enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Pierce) and visualized on Kodak-AR film. Cells were grown to confluence, washed gently with ice-cold PBS twice, and lysed in 1 ml of radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer. After 10 min on ice, cell lysates were collected and precleared for 30 min at 4 °C with protein A-agarose. After centrifugation (14,000 × g, 15 s at 4 °C), the supernatants were incubated with primary antibodies (1 μg/mg lysate) overnight at 4 °C with continuous mixing. Protein A-agarose (40 μl) was added to the lysate. After 2 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed three times in lysis buffer, and proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-sample buffer containing 4% 2-mercaptoethanol (Bio-Rad). The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. HUVECs were seeded into 24-well plates and grown to confluence. Tumor cells (25 × 106) were resuspended in 1 ml of complete medium and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of 50 μg/ml calcein-AM (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). After the cells were labeled, they were resuspended at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml in DMEM. Tumor cells (1.5 × 105 in 150 μl) were added to washed plates and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After incubation, plates were washed three times with DMEM. Adherent cells were lysed, and cell adhesion was quantified on an Ultra384 plate reader (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland) by using 485- and 535-nm excitation and emission filters, respectively, after cell lysis in lysis buffer containing 50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Nonidet P-40, and 5 mmol/liter EDTA. Pull-down assays for Ras were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). HUVECs were lysed in lysis buffer (25 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 5 mmol/liter MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmol/liter DTT, and 5% glycerol) on ice for 5 min. The lysates were centrifuged at 16 000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. Activated Ras was pulled down with GST·Raf1·Ras-binding domain complex followed by Western blotting for active Ras. Tumor cells were trypsinized and resuspended in 100 μl of FACS buffer (1 × 106 cells/tube). The cells were treated with 1 μg of antibody and were incubated on ice for 1 h. The cells were washed, secondary FITC antibody was added, and cells were incubated for 30 min on ice. The cells were then washed with cold FACS buffer, resuspended in 400 μl of FACS buffer, and used for analysis. Fluorochrome- and isotype-matched controls were used in parallel experiments to monitor nonspecific staining. All data were recorded with a BD FACS LSRII and analyzed with FlowJo 7.6.1. The conditions used for the transduction of recombinant adenoviruses were optimized by using adenovirus encoding GFP. All reagents and kits, including transduction reagents, an adenovirus purification kit, and an adenovirus titration kit, were purchased from Cell Biolabs, Inc. After purification, the titration of each recombinant adenovirus was determined by an ELISA titrating kit. HUVECs were seeded into 6-well plates for 24 h until they reached 80% confluence. According to the manufacturer's protocol, adenovirus was transduced into cells by using ViraDuctin (Cell Biolabs, Inc.). HUVECs were infected with adenoviral vectors with a multiplicity of infection of 100 plaque-forming units/cell in the presence of ViraDuctin. After incubation with viral particles for 48 h, the cells were assessed for the expression of the transduced genes. The efficacy of all recombinant adenoviruses was previously tested (14Haidari M. Zhang W. Chen Z. Ganjehei L. Warier N. Vanderslice P. Dixon R. Myosin light chain phosphorylation facilitates monocyte transendothelial migration by dissociating endothelial adherens junctions.Cardiovasc. Res. 2011; 92: 456-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). An FITC-labeled, double-stranded siRNA (Invitrogen) was used to optimize the transfection of endothelial cells with siRNA. The siRNA constructs for Src Pyk2, β1, and α2–6 were validated by Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). To confirm the efficiency of siRNA transfection, the mRNA expression of genes of interest was measured by RT-PCR (15Di Ciano-Oliveira C. Lodyga M. Fan L. Szászi K. Hosoya H. Rotstein O.D. Kapus A. Is myosin light-chain phosphorylation a regulatory signal for the osmotic activation of the Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter?.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2005; 289: C68-C81Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and protein expression was analyzed by flow cytometry. The vector pcDNA3.1/CT-GFP TOPO (Invitrogen) was used to optimize the transfection of plasmids into HUVECs. Plasmids and siRNA were transfected into cells by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Scrambled siRNA (a non-targeting siRNA pool) and empty pcDNA3.1 vector were transfected as controls. Cells were collected 48 h after transfection with siRNA or plasmids. Cells were grown in wells of 4-chamber culture collagen-coated slides. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 4 °C, washed with PBS, and permeabilized for 5 min with 0.1% Triton X-100. After blocking with PBS plus 2% BSA plus 0.1% Tween 20, cells were incubated with primary antibody against VE-cad and goat anti-rabbit IgG for 45 min each. Images were acquired by MicroSuite FIVE software (Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions, Golden, CO) with an Olympus BX61 motorized microscope (Olympus America, Center Valley, PA). A kit from Cell Biolabs, Inc. was used for TEM assays according to the manufacturer's instructions. MDA-MB-231 or MCF-7 cells (25 × 106 each) were resuspended in 1 ml of complete medium and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of 50 μg/ml calcein-AM (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). After the cells were labeled, they were resuspended at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml in DMEM. MDA-MB-231 or MCF-7 cells (1.5 × 105 in 150 μl) were added to the upper compartment of transwell chambers with 6.5-mm diameter and 8-μm pores for 4 h. To remove non-migrating cells, the apical side of the filter was scraped gently with cotton wool and discarded; only cells that attached to the bottom side of the filter or migrating tumor cells were quantified with an Ultra384 plate reader (Tecan) by using 485- and 535-nm excitation and emission filters, respectively. Adhesion and transmigration data were analyzed by analysis of variance, and a two-sample Student t test was used to calculate statistical significance (Excel, Microsoft Corp., Houston, TX). All experiments were repeated at least three times. A probability (P) value of <0.05 was considered significant. We recently showed that the interaction of monocytes with endothelial cells leads to Tyr phosphorylation of VE-cad and disruption of endothelial adherens junctions (14Haidari M. Zhang W. Chen Z. Ganjehei L. Warier N. Vanderslice P. Dixon R. Myosin light chain phosphorylation facilitates monocyte transendothelial migration by dissociating endothelial adherens junctions.Cardiovasc. Res. 2011; 92: 456-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To determine if the interaction of breast cancer cells with endothelial cells leads to similar effects on endothelial adherens junctions, invasive breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) were added to a monolayer of HUVECs. MDA-MB-231 cells are known as a highly aggressive estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cell line. As indicated in Fig. 1A, VE-cad Tyr phosphorylation was significantly increased after the addition of MDA-MB-231 cells, and this was accompanied by an increase in the phosphorylation of Src and Pyk-2, two Tyr kinases that are involved in Tyr phosphorylation of VE-cad (14Haidari M. Zhang W. Chen Z. Ganjehei L. Warier N. Vanderslice P. Dixon R. Myosin light chain phosphorylation facilitates monocyte transendothelial migration by dissociating endothelial adherens junctions.Cardiovasc. Res. 2011; 92: 456-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The increase in VE-cad tyrosine phosphorylation induced by MDA-MB-231 cells also occurs after attachment of other invasive cancer cells (see below). siRNA against Src and Pyk2, which reduced basal levels of each respective protein almost 50% (data not shown), attenuated the Tyr phosphorylation of VE-cad induced by MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 1, B and C). As indicated by immunofluorescence staining of VE-cad (Fig. 1D), the attachment of MDA-MB-231 cells to a monolayer of HUVECs led to a dramatic retraction in endothelial cells, a process that may precede MDA-MB-231 endothelial transmigration. When HUVECs were pretreated with a Src inhibitor (4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl) pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine, PP2), the retraction of HUVECs was blocked (Fig. 1D), suggesting that Src activation contributes to MDA-MB-231-induced retraction of HUVECs. In addition, after the attachment of MDA-MB-231 cells to HUVECs, β-catenin was dissociated from VE-cad (Fig. 1E). Integrins regulate cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and survival, processes that are required in both tumorigenesis and metastasis of cancer cells. To determine which integrins mediate breast cancer cell-induced VE-cad Tyr phosphorylation, we examined integrin expression on MDA-MB-231 cells. As indicated in Fig. 2A, β1 integrins were the most highly expressed integrins found on MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, α2 and α3 integrin subunits were expressed at greater levels than the rest of the α integrin subunits examined. The expressions of α5 and α6 integrins were also significantly greater than the control IgG. The expression of α4 integrin subunit was almost undetectable. The expression of αvβ3 integrins on MDA-MB-231 cells was very low. The expression of αvβ3 integrin on HUVECs was used as a positive control (Fig. 2B). To determine whether β1 integrins are critical for the adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells to endothelial cells and for the induction of VE-cad Tyr phosphorylation in HUVECs, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with a β1 integrin-blocking antibody (mAb 33B6) or β1 integrin-activating antibody (mAb TS2/16). The results of substrate attachment assays showed that the pretreatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with β1 integrin-blocking (33B6) antibody or β1 integrin-activating (TS2/16) antibody inhibited or enhanced, respectively, the attachment of these cells to laminin, fibronectin, and collagen type I (Fig. 2C). The attachment of MDA-MB-231 cells to HUVECs was inhibited or enhanced when MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with the β1 integrin-blocking (33B6) antibody or β1 integrin-activating (TS2/16) antibody, respectively (Fig. 2D). To verify the data obtained with the function-blocking mAb 33B6, we examined the effects of knocking down the β1 integrin subunit in MDA-MB-231 cells with siRNA. The knockdown of the β1 integrin subunit was confirmed by flow cytometry (Fig. 2E). The adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells to HUVECs was reduced by β1 siRNA (Fig. 2F), suggesting that β1 integrins play a critical role in the attachment of MDA-MB-231 cells to HUVECs. To determine which α subunit was involved in the attachment of MDA-MB-231 cells to HUVECs, we examined the effects of knocking down α2 and α3 integrin subunits in MDA-MB-231 cells. By using flow cytometry, we confirmed the siRNA-mediated reduction in expression of α2 and α3 integrin subunits (Fig. 2G). The inhibition of α2 subunit did not show any effect on expression of α3 subunit and vice versa (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2H, α2 and α3 siRNAs inhibited the adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells to HUVECs (Fig. 2H). The inhibition was more pronounced for α2 siRNA. Previous studies have shown that the interaction of integrins α4β1 and αL/Mβ2 with VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 adhesion molecules leads to monocyte-induced Tyr phosphorylation of VE-cad (14Haidari M. Zhang W. Chen Z. Ganjehei L. Warier N. Vanderslice P. Dixon R. Myosin light chain phosphorylation facilitates monocyte transendothelial migration by dissociating endothelial adherens junctions.Cardiovasc.

Immunol. 2007; 179: 4053-4064Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). By using blocking antibody and siRNA, we sought to determine which integrin(s) mediate MDA-MB-231 cell-induced Tyr phosphorylation of VE-cad in HUVECs. The treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with blocking antibody against β1 integrin suppressed MDA-MB-231 cell-induced Tyr phosphorylation of VE-cad and Pyk2 (Fig. 3A). The treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with siRNA against β1 and α2 integrin subunits attenuated Tyr phosphorylation of VE-cad in HUVECs (Fig. 3, B and C). Tyr phosphorylation of VE-cad was slightly but significantly reduced by siRNA against α3 integrin subunit. The siRNA-mediated knockdown of α4, α5, α6, β2, and αvβ3 integrin subunits failed to attenuate breast cancer cell-induced Tyr phosphorylation of VE-cad (data not shown). To determine which ligand(s) mediates MDA-MB-231-induced Tyr phosphorylation of HUVECs, we pretreated MDA-MB-231 cells with soluble laminin, fibronectin, or collagen type I before adding the cells to a monolayer of HUVECs. As shown in Fig. 3D, the adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells to HUVECs was partially inhibited by the pretreatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with laminin/fibronectin and profoundly inhibited by collagen type I. VE-cad Tyr phosphorylation in HUVECs was primarily attenuated by collagen type I and weakly attenuated by laminin and fibronectin (Fig. 3E). TEM of MDA-MB-231 cells was also inhibited by the siRNA-mediated knockdown of α2 and β1 integrin subunits (Fig. 3F). Integrin α2β1-mediated adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells to HUVECs could induce VE-cad Tyr phosphorylation. To determine whether α2β1 integrin alone is sufficient to induce this, we treated HUVECs with recombinant soluble integrins (α2β1, α3β1, and α5β1) and examined tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cad. As shown in Fig. 3G, recombinant human α2β1 and to a lesser degree α3β1 integrins induced Tyr phosphorylation of VE-cad in HUVECs, whereas recombinant human α5β1 or BSA did not. These results suggest that binding of α2β1 and α3β1 integrins to HUVECs is sufficient to induce Tyr phosphorylation of HUVECs and that MDA-MB-231 cell-induced Tyr phosphorylation of VE-cad is primarily mediated by the integrin α2β1. To determine whether the invasiveness of breast cancer cells affects the induction of VE-cad Tyr phosphorylation in HUVECs, we compared the effects of highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells with those of weakly invasive MCF-7 cells. In MCF-7 cells, integrin subunits,"

Here we develop an array of Escherichia coli biosensors to sensitively quantify eleven different amino acids. By using online databases, genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis were identified that – upon deletion – should render the corresponding mutant auxotrophic for one particular amino acid. This rational design strategy suggested genes involved in the biosynthesis of arginine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, threonine, tryptophan, and tyrosine as potential genetic targets. A detailed phenotypic characterization of the corresponding single-gene deletion mutants indeed confirmed that these strains could neither grow on a minimal medium lacking amino acids nor transform any other proteinogenic amino acid into the focal one. Site-specific integration of the egfp gene into the chromosome of each biosensor decreased the detection limit of the GFP-labeled cells by 30% relative to turbidometric measurements. Finally, using the biosensors to determine the amino acid concentration in the supernatants of two amino acid overproducing E. coli strains (i.e. ΔhisL and ΔtdcC) both turbidometrically and via GFP fluorescence emission and comparing the results to conventional HPLC measurements confirmed the utility of the developed biosensor system. Taken together, our study provides not only a genotypically and phenotypically well-characterized set of publicly available amino acid biosensors, but also demonstrates the feasibility of the rational design strategy used."
https://openalex.org/W1991501949,"Endocannabinoid signaling plays key roles in multiple female reproductive events. Previous studies have shown an interesting phenomenon, that mice with either silenced or elevated endocannabinoid signaling via Cnr1 encoding CB(1) show similar defects in several pregnancy events, including preimplantation embryo development. To unravel the downstream signaling of this phenomenon, microarray studies were performed using RNAs collected from WT, Cnr1(-/-), and Faah(-/-) mouse blastocysts on day 4 of pregnancy. The results indicate that about 100 genes show unidirectional changes under either silenced or elevated anandamide signaling via CB(1). Functional enrichment analysis of the microarray data predicted that multiple biological functions and pathways are affected under aberrant endocannabinoid signaling. Among them, genes enriched in cell migration are suppressed in Cnr1(-/-) or Faah(-/-) blastocysts. Cell migration assays validated the prediction of functional enrichment analysis that cell mobility and spreading of either Cnr1(-/-) or Faah(-/-) trophoblast stem cells are compromised. Either silenced or elevated endocannabinoid signaling via CB(1) causes similar changes in downstream targets in preimplantation embryos and trophoblast stem cells. This study provides evidence that a tightly regulated endocannabinoid signaling is critical to normal preimplantation embryo development and migration of trophoblast stem cells."

We compared offspring mean BMI, WC, WHR, SBP, DBP and PR and the risk of being overweight and obese at 21 years by three mutually exclusive categories of maternal smoking status defined as never smoked, smoked before and/or after pregnancy but not in pregnancy or smoked during pregnancy and other times.Offspring of mothers who smoked during pregnancy had greater mean BMI, WC, WHR and PR and they were at greater risk of being obese at 21 years compared to offspring of those mothers who never smoked. The mean of these risk factors among those adult offspring whose mothers stopped smoking during pregnancy, but who then smoked at other times in the child's life, were similar to those mothers who never smoked. These results were independent of a range of potential confounding factors.The findings of this study suggest a prospective association of maternal smoking during pregnancy and offspring obesity as well as PR in adulthood, and reinforce the need to persuade pregnant women not to smoke."
https://openalex.org/W2054288757,"Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4), belonging to serine/threonine kinase family, is critical for centriole replication and cell cycle progression. PLK4 has been proposed as a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, its expression and significance in HCC have not been well studied. In the present study, we found that PLK4 was markedly downregulated in both HCC cell lines and fresh cancer tissues, using quantitative real-time-PCR and western blot. Immunohistochemistry data also revealed that decreased expression of PLK4 was present in 72.4% (178/246) of HCC tissues, compared with the corresponding adjacent nontumorous tissues. Furthermore, PLK4 expression significantly correlated with clinicopathological parameters, including clinical stage (P = 0.034), serum α-fetoprotein (AFP) (P = 0.019) and tumor size (P = 0.032). Moreover, HCC patients with low PLK4 expression survived shorter than those with high PLK4 expression, as indicated by overall survival (P = 0.002) and disease-free survival (P = 0.012) assessed by the Kaplan–Meier method. In addition, multivariate analysis suggested PLK4 as an independent predictor of overall survival (HR, 0.556; 95%CI, 0.376−0.822; P = 0.003) and disease-free survival (HR, 0.547; 95%CI, 0.382−0.783; P = 0.001). Collectively, our study demonstrated that PLK4 was remarkably downregulated in HCC and could be served as a potential prognostic marker for patients with this deadly disease."
https://openalex.org/W1975244640,"Background Although diffusion tensor imaging has been used to monitor Wallerian degeneration, the exact relationship between the evolution of diffusion indices and its underlying pathology, especially in central nervous system, remains largely unknown. Here we aimed to address this question using a cat Wallerian degeneration model of corticospinal tract. Methodology/Principal Findings Twenty-five domestic mature Felis catus were included in the present study. The evolution of diffusion indices, including mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), primary (λ1) and transverse eigenvalues (λ23) of the degenerated corticospinal tract, were observed at baseline (before modeling) and at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45 and 60 days after modeling in 4 cats. Pathological examinations were performed at eight time points mentioned above. Wallerian degeneration can be detected as early as the 2nd day after modeling by both diffusion tensor imaging and pathology. According to the evolution of diffusion indices, Wallerian degeneration can be classified into 2 stages. During the early stage (within 8 days after modeling), progressive disintegration of axons and myelin sheaths underlies the decreases in FA and λ1 and the increase in λ23. However, during the late stage (after 8 days), the gradual increases in FA, MD and λ1 and the unchanged λ23 seem to be a comprehensive reflection of the pathological processes including microglia activation, myelin clearance, and astrocytosis. Conclusions/Significance Our findings help the understanding of the altered diffusion indices in the context of pathology and suggest that diffusion tensor imaging has the potential to monitor the processes of Wallerian degeneration in the central nervous system in vivo after acute damage."
https://openalex.org/W1981073891,"Sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) is an important enzyme involved in the production of the bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). SK1 is overexpressed in many forms of cancer, however, the contribution of SK1 to cancer progression is still unclear. One of the best characterized mutations found in several forms of human cancer is an activating point mutation in the Ras oncogene, which disrupts its GTPase activity and leads to stimulation of the MEK/ERK pathway. Because SK1 activity and subcellular localization have been shown to be regulated by ERK, we wished to investigate the effect of oncogenic Ras, a potent activator of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, on the activity of SK1 and sphingolipid metabolism. Using HEK293T cells transiently transfected with the K-RasG12V oncogene and both wild type and Sphk1−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts stably infected with retroviral K-RasG12V, we found that K-RasG12V increases the production of S1P and decreases the production of ceramide in a SK1-dependent manner. In addition, we found that expression of the K-RasG12V oncogene leads to plasma membrane localization of SK1 and a reduction in cytosolic levels of SK1. This effect is likely mediated by the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway as constitutively active B-Raf or MEK1 are able to activate SK1, but constitutively active Akt1 is not. We believe this research has important implications for how sphingolipids may be contributing to oncogenic transformation and provide some of the first evidence for oncogenes inducing specific changes in sphingolipid metabolism through SK1 regulation.

However, there is no information on the vascular effects of the combination of statins and exercise on arterial wall stiffness in CAD patients.The present study is a sub-analysis of PRESET study that determined the effects of 20-week treatment with statins (rosuvastatin, n=14, atorvastatin, n=14) combined with regular exercise on arterial wall stiffness assessed by measurement of brachial and ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) in CAD patients.The combination of statins and regular exercise significantly improved exercise capacity, lipid profile, including low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), baPWV (baseline: 1747 ± 355, at 20 weeks of treatment: 1627 ± 271 cm/s, p=0.008), and basophil count (baseline: 42 ± 32, 20 weeks: 26 ± 15 cells/µL, p=0.007), but had no effect on blood pressure (baseline: 125 ± 22, 20 weeks: 121 ± 16 mmHg). Changes in baPWV correlated significantly with changes in basophil count (r=0.488, p=0.008), but not with age, lipids profile, exercise capacity, or hs-CRP.In CAD patients, the combination treatment with statins and exercise resulted in significant amelioration of arterial wall stiffness, at least in part, through reduction of circulating basophils."
https://openalex.org/W2096894427,"Despite advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of salivary gland neoplasms (SGN), the molecular pathways associated with enhanced tumor growth and cell survival remain to be established. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether TP53 mutations are relevant to SGN pathogenesis and if they impact on p53 protein expression. The study included 18 benign and 18 malignant SGN samples. Two polymorphic microsatellite markers at the TP53 genetic locus were chosen to assess loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the samples that had matched normal DNA. The TP53 exons 2–11 were amplified by PCR, and all of the products were sequenced. Reverse transcription-PCR of the TP53 open reading frame (ORF) was carried out in the samples that had fresh tissue available, and immunohistochemistry for the p53 protein was performed in all samples. TP53 LOH was only found in two pleomorphic adenomas. We found two missense mutations in exon 7 (one in a pleomorphic adenoma and the other in a polymorphous low grade adenocarcinoma), another in exon 8 (in a carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma) and a fourth missense mutation in exon 10 (in a mucoepidermoid carcinoma). In addition, a nonsense mutation was found in exon 8 of an adenoid cystic carcinoma. Several intronic and exonic SNPs were detected. Although almost all of the malignant samples were immunopositive for p53, approximately 37% of the benign samples were positive, including the sample harboring the missense mutation and one of the samples that showed LOH. The complete TP53 ORF could be amplified in all samples analyzed, including the IHC negative samples, the samples showing LOH and one sample displaying a missense mutation. In summary, our results show that TP53 mutations are not a frequent event in SGN and that p53 immunopositivity might not be associated with sequence mutations in SGN."
https://openalex.org/W1985726296,"Two novel cyclic lipopeptides, anabaenolysin A and anabaenolysin B, were isolated from two benthic cyanobacterial strains of the genus Anabaena. This novel class of cyanobacterial lipopeptides has a general structure of a small peptide ring consisting of four amino acids from which two are proteinogenic and two unusual; glycine1, glycine2, 2-(3-amino-5-oxytetrahydrofuran-2-yl)-2-hydroxyacetic acid3 and a long unsaturated C18 β-amino acid4 with a conjugated triene structure. They are distinguished by the presence of a conjugated dienic structure in the C18 β-amino acid present in anabaenolysin A but not in anabaenolysin B. Conjugated triene structure generates a typical UV spectrum for anabaenolysins for easy recognition. Anabaenolysin A constituted up to 400 ppm of the cyanobacterial dry weight. We found evidence of thirteen variants of anabaenolysins in one cyanobacterial strain. This suggests that the anabaenolysins are an important class of secondary metabolites in benthic Anabaena cyanobacteria. Both anabaenolysin A and B had cytolytic activity on a number of mammalian cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W1981975969,"Liver is a target organ in many mitochondrial disorders, especially if the complex III assembly factor BCS1L is mutated. To reveal disease mechanism due to such mutations, we have produced a transgenic mouse model with c.232A>G mutation in Bcs1l, the causative mutation for GRACILE syndrome. The homozygous mice develop mitochondrial hepatopathy with steatosis and fibrosis after weaning. Our aim was to assess cellular mechanisms for disease onset and progression using metabolomics.With mass spectrometry we analyzed metabolite patterns in liver samples obtained from homozygotes and littermate controls of three ages. As oxidative stress might be a mechanism for mitochondrial hepatopathy, we also assessed H(2)O(2) production and expression of antioxidants.Homozygotes had a similar metabolic profile at 14 days of age as controls, with the exception of slightly decreased AMP. At 24 days, when hepatocytes display first histopathological signs, increases in succinate, fumarate and AMP were found associated with impaired glucose turnover and beta-oxidation. At end stage disease after 30 days, these changes were pronounced with decreased carbohydrates, high levels of acylcarnitines and amino acids, and elevated biogenic amines, especially putrescine. Signs of oxidative stress were present in end-stage disease.The findings suggest an early Krebs cycle defect with increases of its intermediates, which might play a role in disease onset. During disease progression, carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism deteriorate leading to a starvation-like condition. The mouse model is valuable for further investigations on mechanisms in mitochondrial hepatopathy and for interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2083537669,"There is increasing evidence that dysregulation of CD4+ T cell populations leads to intestinal inflammation, but the regional distribution of these populations throughout the intestinal tract in healthy individuals remains unclear. Here, we show that TH17, TH22 and TReg cells are enriched in the healthy human cecum compared to the terminal ileum and sigmoid colon, whereas TH1 and TH2 cells do not significantly vary by location. Transcriptional profiling analysis of paired pinch biopsies from different regions of the intestine identified significant differences in the metabolic state of the terminal ileum, cecum, and sigmoid colon. An increased proportion of TH17 cells was positively associated with expression of resistin (RETN) and negatively associated with expression of trefoil factor 1 (TFF1). These results suggest that CD4+ T helper cells that are important in maintaining mucosal barrier function may be enriched in the cecum as a result of metabolic differences of the surrounding microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2169011549,"High avidity cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are important in viral clearance and anti-tumor immunity, however, mechanisms for their optimal generation and maintenance in vivo remain unclear. Immunizing mice with an antibody-DNA vaccine encoding a single CTL epitope, induces a 100 fold higher avidity response than peptide vaccination with the identical epitope. The high avidity response is retained into memory and can be efficiently reactivated with an antibody-DNA boost. In contrast, reactivation of high avidity CTL with peptide, stimulated responses with a significant drop in avidity, suggesting loss or conversion of the high avidity CTL to lower avidity. Similarly, high avidity T cells maintained ex vivo were exquisitely sensitive to signaling with low doses of peptide (1 ng/ml) giving optimal TCR stimulation and resulting in retained avidity, proliferation and ability to kill specific targets. In contrast, high avidity T cells maintained ex vivo with supraoptimal TCR stimulation (10 µg/ml peptide) resulted in reduced avidity and failure to kill tumor cells. They also failed to proliferate, showed a significant increase in apoptosis and expressed high levels of the exhaustion marker programmed death-1 (PD-1) and low levels of the lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3). This suggests high avidity T cells are recruited to the memory pool but can be lost by supraoptimal stimulation in vitro and in vivo. This is characterized by loss of function and an increase in cell death. The remaining CTL, exhibit low functional avidity that is reflected in reduced anti-tumor activity. This could contribute to failure of the immune system to control the growth of tumors and has implications for vaccination strategies and adoptive transfer of T cells."
https://openalex.org/W1967245909,"New regimens for intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) against malaria are needed as the effectiveness of the standard two-dose sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) regimen is under threat. Previous trials have shown that IPTp with monthly SP benefits HIV-positive primi- and secundigravidae, but there is no conclusive evidence of the possible benefits of this regimen to HIV-negative women, or to a population comprising of both HIV-positive and -negative women of different gravidities.This study analyzed 484 samples collected at delivery as part of a randomized, partially placebo controlled clinical trial, conducted in rural Malawi between 2003 and 2007. The study included pregnant women regardless of their gravidity or HIV-infection status. The participants received SP twice (controls), monthly SP, or monthly SP and two doses of azithromycin (AZI-SP). The main outcome was the prevalence of peripheral Plasmodium falciparum malaria at delivery diagnosed with a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay.Overall prevalence of PCR-diagnosed peripheral P. falciparum malaria at delivery was 10.5%. Compared with the controls, participants in the monthly SP group had a risk ratio (95% CI) of 0.33 (0.17 to 0.64, P<0.001) and those in the AZI-SP group 0.23 (0.11 to 0.48, P<0.001) for malaria at delivery. When only HIV-negative participants were analyzed, the corresponding figures were 0.26 (0.12 to 0.57, P<0.001) for women in the monthly SP group, and 0.24 (0.11 to 0.53, P<0.001) for those in the AZI-SP group.Our results suggest that increasing the frequency of SP administration during pregnancy improves the efficacy against malaria at delivery among HIV-negative women, as well as a population consisting of both HIV-positive and -negative pregnant women of all gravidities, in a setting of relatively low but holoendemic malaria transmission, frequent use of bed nets and high SP resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2058399725,"Background We have previously reported that human recombinant granzyme B (grB) mediates apoptosis in membrane heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70)-positive tumor cells in a perforin-independent manner. Methodology/Principal Findings Optical imaging of uptake kinetics revealed co-localization of grB with recycling endosomes (Rab9/11) as early as 5 min after internalization, with late endosomes (Rab7) after 30 min, and the lysosomal compartment (LAMP1/2) after 60 to 120 min. Active caspase-3-mediated apoptosis was induced in mouse CT26 monolayer cells and 3D tumor spheroids, but not in normal mouse endothelial cells. Granzyme B selectively reduced the proportion of membrane Hsp70-positive cells in CT26 tumor spheroids. Consecutive i.v. injections of recombinant human grB into mice bearing membrane Hsp70-positive CT26 tumors resulted in significant tumor suppression, and a detailed inspection of normal mouse organs revealed that the administration of anti-tumoral concentrations of grB elicited no clinicopathological changes. Conclusions/Significance These findings support the future clinical evaluation of human grB as a potential adjuvant therapeutic agent, especially for treating immunosuppressed patients that bear membrane Hsp70-positive tumors."

Here, we show that two-pore channel 2 (TPC2) is expressed in osteoclast precursor cells, and its knockdown (TPC2-KD) in these cells suppressed RANKL-induced key events including multinucleation, enhancement of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activities, and TRAP mRNA expression levels. With respect to intracellular signaling, TPC2-KD reduced the levels of the RANKL-induced dynamic waving of Ca(2+) in RAW cells. The search for the target of TPC2 identified that nuclear localization of NFATc1 is retarded in TPC2-KD cells. Finally, TPC2-KD suppressed osteoclastic pit formation in cultures. We conclude that TPC2 is a novel critical molecule for osteoclastogenesis."

Rhodococcus strains were cultivated in LBP medium containing 1% (w/v) bacto-peptone (Difco, Detroit, MI), 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract (BD Biosciences) and 1% (w/v) NaCl at 30 °C and 200 rpm. E. coli strains were grown in Luria-Bertani broth (Sigma) at 37 °C unless stated otherwise. Initial Δ4-(5α)-KSTD activity was established by a native gel-based assay. Cell-free extracts of three Rhodococcus strains (Rhodococcus erythropolis SQ1, Rhodococcus rhodochrous, and R. jostii RHA1) were prepared as described (5Knol J. Bodewits K. Hessels G.I. Dijkhuizen L. van der Geize R. 3-Keto-5α-steroid Δ1-dehydrogenase from Rhodococcus erythropolis SQ1 and its orthologue in Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv are highly specific enzymes that function in cholesterol catabolism.Biochem. J. 2008; 410: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These were loaded on native PAGE gels and stained for KSTD activity following published procedures (5Knol J. Bodewits K. Hessels G.I. Dijkhuizen L. van der Geize R. 3-Keto-5α-steroid Δ1-dehydrogenase from Rhodococcus erythropolis SQ1 and its orthologue in Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv are highly specific enzymes that function in cholesterol catabolism.Biochem. J. 2008; 410: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Δ4-(5α)-KSTD was heterologously expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and subsequently purified and crystallized as described before (10van Oosterwijk N. Knol J. Dijkhuizen L. van der Geize R. Dijkstra B.W. Cloning, overexpression, purification, crystallization and preliminary x-ray analysis of 3-ketosteroid Δ4-(5α)-dehydrogenase from Rhodococcus jostii RHA1.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2011; 67: 1269-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). UV-visible spectra of purified enzyme measured in the range of 200 to 700 nm (Cary 100, Varian) with and without substrate were used to characterize the protein as a flavoprotein and to detect the reduction of the FAD upon addition of substrate. Noncovalent binding of the flavin co-factor was determined as follows. Purified Δ4-(5α)-KSTD was applied to a SDS-PAGE gel. Following electrophoresis, the gel was treated with 5% acetic acid solution, and flavin was visualized by 254-nm UV irradiation. Lack of co-migration indicated noncovalent binding of the flavin co-factor to the Δ4-(5α)-KSTD protein. Because E. coli does not code for any KSTD enzymes, cell-free extracts were used for product formation assays as described before (5Knol J. Bodewits K. Hessels G.I. Dijkhuizen L. van der Geize R. 3-Keto-5α-steroid Δ1-dehydrogenase from Rhodococcus erythropolis SQ1 and its orthologue in Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv are highly specific enzymes that function in cholesterol catabolism.Biochem. J. 2008; 410: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, enzyme activities were determined spectrophotometrically at 30 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, using 80 μm dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) as an artificial electron acceptor and 0–200 μm 1-(5α)-androstene-3,17-dione (1-(5α)-AD) as substrate (Steraloids). The initial reaction rates were determined from the absorbance change at 600 nm during the first 20 s of the reaction. The products were identified by HPLC following a reaction containing purified protein (50–200 μg), 200 μm 1-(5α)-AD dissolved in ethanol, and 200 μm DCPIP. No activity was detected in control reaction mixtures lacking steroids or purified enzyme or in extracts of E. coli with an empty pET15b expression vector. Δ4-(5α)-KSTD was crystallized at 293 K as described before, with a precipitant consisting of 200 mm NH4-acetate, 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.6, and 30% (w/v) PEG 4000 (10van Oosterwijk N. Knol J.

Cryst. Commun. 2011; 67: 1269-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Crystals were prepared for data collection by soaking them for ∼30 s in mother liquor, supplemented with 20% (w/v) glycerol, followed by cryo-cooling in liquid nitrogen. The 4-AD soaks were prepared by soaking crystals for ∼18 h in cryo-mother liquor, which had the 200 mm NH4-acetate replaced by 200 mm NH4Cl, and to which 10 μl of a saturated solution of 4-AD in ethanol had been added per 500 μl of cryo-mother liquor. The diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the beamlines of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). The intensity data were processed using the programs MOSFLM (11Battye T.G. Kontogiannis L. Johnson O. Powell H.R. Leslie A.G. iMOSFLM.

The structure with the highest sequence identity (24%) was that of flavocytochrome c3 fumarate reductase from Shewanella frigidimarina in the open conformation (Protein Data Bank entry 1qo8) (15Bamford V.

Because of the low sequence identity, the molecular replacement model was enhanced by incorporating all-serine structural information from various homologous proteins (17–24% identity; Protein Data Bank entries 1d4c (16Leys D.

This ensemble of all-serine models was used to solve the structure of Δ4-(5α)-KSTD by molecular replacement at 2.5 Å resolution using the program Phaser (21McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Phaser crystallographic software.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14504) Google Scholar). Several model building cycles, consisting of manual model building using COOT (22Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G. Cowtan K. Features and development of Coot.Acta Crystallogr. D. 2010; 66: 486-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17187) Google Scholar) and density modification with Resolve (23Terwilliger T.C. Maximum-likelihood density modification.Acta Crystallogr. D. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar), were performed to improve the model obtained from Phaser until an R factor of 0.44%. Because of low sequence similarity and variable positions of residues 291–426 (substrate-binding domain) in the homologous structures, no interpretable density was observed for this region. However, manual model building and density modification improved the phases sufficiently to allow Arp/Warp (24Langer G. Cohen S.X. Lamzin V.S. Perrakis A. Automated macromolecular model building for x-ray crystallography using ARP/wARP version 7.Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar) to build the complete model using data to 1.6 Å resolution. The model obtained from Arp/wArp was used as the starting model for the crystallographic refinement. First, manual model building using COOT (25Emsley P. Cowtan K. Coot. Model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23311) Google Scholar) was performed to adjust minor discrepancies in the model. Then the model was refined with Refmac using TLS refinement (26Murshudov G.N. Skubák P. Lebedev A.A. Pannu N.S. Steiner R.A. Nicholls R.A. Winn M.D. Long F. Vagin A.A. REFMAC5 for the refinement of macromolecular crystal structures.Acta Crystallogr. D. 2011; 67: 355-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5982) Google Scholar) to a final R factor of 15.8% and an Rfree of 17.5% at 1.6 Å resolution. Most residues were visible in the electron density except for the first 25 residues (consisting of the His6 tag and 19 residues of the His6 tag linker) and the last residue. Two differences were found, A60T and T160A, compared with the published genome sequence. The final model contains FAD, one glycerol molecule, two acetate molecules, and 619 water molecules. Also 14 amino acids with double conformations were identified. In addition, the structure contains a chloride ion, of which the location was confirmed using a bromide MAD data set. The secondary structure was assigned using DSSP (27Kabsch W. Sander C. Dictionary of protein secondary structure. Pattern recognition of hydrogen-bonded and geometrical features.Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12304) Google Scholar). The product-bound structure was solved by rigid body fitting of the steroid-free structure followed by restrained refinement with REFMAC5. The geometric restraints for the FAD and 4-AD models were generated using the PRODRG2 server (28Schüttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M. PRODRG. A tool for high-throughput crystallography of protein-ligand complexes.Acta Crystallogr. D. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar). These ligands were manually built into 2Fo − Fc and Fo − Fc electron density maps using COOT. The 4-AD model was refined to an R factor of 15.9% and an Rfree value of 18.1% at 1.6 Å resolution. A summary of the refinement statistics and the geometric quality of the models is given in Table 2. The quality of the models was analyzed using the program MolProbity (29Chen V.B. Arendall 3rd, W.B.

Open table in a new tab Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with plasmid pBluescript-ro05698 as template. The PCR product of ro05698 (10van Oosterwijk N. Knol J. Dijkhuizen L. van der Geize R. Dijkstra B.W. Cloning, overexpression, purification, crystallization and preliminary x-ray analysis of 3-ketosteroid Δ4-(5α)-dehydrogenase from Rhodococcus jostii RHA1.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2011; 67: 1269-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) was cloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript (II) KS (Fermentas). Primers used for site-directed mutagenesis are listed in supplemental Table S1. Successful mutagenesis was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The resulting mutant genes were subcloned following NdeI/BamHI digestion into the NdeI/BamHI-digested pET15b (Novagen) for protein expression and protein purification. Mutation S468A in Ro05698 was obtained by ordering a synthetic DNA fragment (487 bp, AGOWA) of ro05698 containing the desired mutation. The synthetic fragment was digested with NotI/BamHI and subcloned into the NotI/BamHI digested pET15b-Ro05698 construct to obtain the full-length gene with the desired mutation. The genome of R. jostii RHA1 contains at least three probable Δ1-KSTD enzymes but only one single putative Δ4-(5α)-KSTD enzyme, encoded by ro05698, based on its 31% sequence identity to the Δ4-(5α)-KSTD of R. erythropolis (1McLeod M.P.

Dijkhuizen L. van der Geize R. 3-Keto-5α-steroid Δ1-dehydrogenase from Rhodococcus erythropolis SQ1 and its orthologue in Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv are highly specific enzymes that function in cholesterol catabolism.Biochem. J. 2008; 410: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Indeed, cell-free extracts of R. jostii RHA1 and two other Rhodococcus strains showed Δ4-(5α)-KSTD activity in a native PAGE assay with 1-(5α)-AD as substrate (supplemental Fig. S1). In R. jostii RHA1, this activity presumably originates from the product of the ro05698 gene. To firmly establish that ro05698 codes for an enzyme with Δ4-(5α)-KSTD activity, the gene was expressed in E. coli, and the Ro05698 protein was purified and incubated with the steroid substrate 1-(5α)-AD. HPLC analysis of the product confirmed the formation of 1,4-androstadiene-3,17-dione (ADD) (Fig. 2), indicating that ro05698 indeed codes for a Δ4-(5α)-KSTD. As expected, no activity was observed with the product 4-androstene-3,17-dione (4-AD) as substrate. The absorption spectrum of purified Δ4-(5α)-KSTD protein is typical of that of a flavoprotein (31Ghisla S. Massey V. Lhoste J.M. Mayhew S.G. Fluorescence and optical characteristics of reduced flavines and flavoproteins.Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), with maxima at 461 and 389 nm (Fig. 3). The addition of 1-(5α)-AD led to the rapid disappearance of the maxima at ∼389 and 461 nm, indicating that the flavin co-factor is reduced along with the dehydrogenation of the steroid substrate. However, also a broad absorbance peak near 490 nm develops, which may indicate the formation of a charge-transfer complex of the electron-rich reduced FAD and the electron-poor oxidized substrate (32Massey V. Ghisla S. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1974; 227: 446-465Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This could suggest that the product does not dissociate from the reduced enzyme before the oxidizing substrate enters the active site. A SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis assay showed that the flavin co-factor did not co-migrate with the protein, suggesting that it is noncovalently bound to the Ro05698 protein. This was confirmed by the crystal structure of Δ4-(5α)-KSTD (see below). The crystal structure of Δ4-(5α)-KSTD was elucidated by molecular replacement using an ensemble of six structures with 17–24% sequence identity to Δ4-(5α)-KSTD as the starting model, and the resulting solution was refined to an R factor of 15.8% at 1.6 Å resolution (for details see Table 2). The crystals contain one Δ4-(5α)-KSTD molecule per asymmetric unit. Δ4-(5α)-KSTD has an ellipsoid shape with dimensions of 80 × 40 × 35 Å (Fig. 4). The overall fold resembles that of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (33Wierenga R.K. de Jong R.J. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G. Drenth J. Crystal structure of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase.J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 131: 55-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), a fold often observed in flavoenzymes (34Mattevi A. The PHBH fold. Not only flavoenzymes.Biophys. Chem. 1998; 70: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The protein consists of two domains connected via a two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (Fig. 4)."

In the present study, 4-(2-Aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF) a serine protease inhibitor was evaluated for prophylactic and therapeutic treatment in mouse model of airway allergy.BALB/c mice were sensitized by i.p route and challenged with ovalbumin. They were treated i.n. with 2, 10 and 50 µg of AEBSF, one hour before or after challenge and euthanized to collect BALF (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid), blood and lungs. Proteolytic activity, total cell/eosinophil/neutrophil count eosinophil peroxidase activity (EPO), IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, cysteinyl leukotrienes and 8-isoprostane were determined in BALF and immunoglobulins were measured in serum. H&E and PAS stained lung sections were examined for cellular infiltration and airway inflammation.Mice exposed to ovalbumin and treated with PBS showed increased cellular infiltration in lungs and higher serum IgE, IgG1 and IgG2a levels as compared to sham mice. Treatment with AEBSF reduced total cells/eosinophil/neutrophil infiltration. Both prophylactic and therapeutic AEBSF treatment of 10 or 50 µg reduced serum IgE and IgG1 significantly (p<0.05) than control. AEBSF treatment reduced the proteolytic activity in BALF. IL-4 IL-5 and IL-13 levels decreased significantly (p<0.05) after AEBSF treatment while IL-10 levels increased significantly (p<0.05) in BALF. Airway inflammation and goblet cell hyperplasia reduced as demonstrated by lung histopathology, EPO activity and cysteinyl leukotrienes in BALF after treatment. AEBSF treatment also suppressed oxidative stress in terms of 8-isoprostane in BALF. Among the treatment doses, 10 or 50 µg of AEBSF were most effective in reducing the inflammatory parameters.Prophylactic and therapeutic treatment with serine protease inhibitor attenuates the airway inflammation in mouse model of airway allergy and have potential for adjunct therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1977344306,"The purpose of the study was to comprehensively evaluate physiologic changes associated with development of high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). We tested whether changes in pulmonary function and breathing pattern would herald clinically overt HAPE at an early stage.In 18 mountaineers, spirometry, diffusing capacity, nitrogen washout, nocturnal ventilation and pulse oximetry were recorded at 490 m and during 3 days after rapid ascent to 4559 m. Findings were compared among subjects developing HAPE and those remaining well (controls).In 8 subjects subsequently developing radiographically documented HAPE at 4559 m, median FVC declined to 82% of low altitude baseline while closing volume increased to 164% of baseline (P<0.05, both instances). In 10 controls, FVC decreased slightly (to 93% baseline, P<0.05) but significantly less than in subjects with HAPE and closing volume remained unchanged. Sniff nasal pressure was reduced in both subjects with and without subsequent HAPE. During nights at 4559 m, mean nocturnal oxygen saturation dropped to lower values while minute ventilation, the number of periodic breathing cycles and heart rate were higher (60%; 8.6 L/min; 97 cycles/h; 94 beats/min, respectively) in subjects subsequently developing HAPE than in controls (73%; 5.1 L/min; 48 cycles/h; 79 beats/min; P<0.05 vs. HAPE, all instances).The results comprehensively represent the pattern of physiologic alterations that precede overt HAPE. The changes in lung function are consistent with reduced lung compliance and impaired gas exchange. Pronounced nocturnal hypoxemia, ventilatory control instability and sympathetic stimulation are further signs of subsequent overt HAPE."
https://openalex.org/W2008131781,"There are more drug overdose deaths in the Untied States than motor vehicle fatalities. Yet the US vital statistics reporting system is of limited value because the data are delayed by four years. Poison centers report data within an hour of the event, but previous studies suggested a small proportion of poisoning deaths are reported to poison centers (PC). In an era of improved electronic surveillance capabilities, exposure calls to PCs may be an alternate indicator of trends in overdose mortality.We used PC call counts for methadone that were reported to the Researched Abuse, Diversion and Addiction-Related Surveillance (RADARS®) System in 2006 and 2007. US death certificate data were used to identify deaths due to methadone. Linear regression was used to quantify the relationship of deaths and poison center calls.Compared to decedents, poison center callers tended to be younger, more often female, at home and less likely to require medical attention. A strong association was found with PC calls and methadone mortality (b=0.88, se=0.42, t=9.5, df=1, p<0.0001, R(2) =0.77). These findings were robust to large changes in a sensitivity analysis assessing the impact of underreporting of methadone overdose deaths.Our results suggest that calls to poison centers for methadone are correlated with poisoning mortality as identified on death certificates. Calls received by poison centers may be used for timely surveillance of mortality due to methadone. In the midst of the prescription opioid overdose epidemic, electronic surveillance tools that report in real-time are powerful public health tools."
https://openalex.org/W2003875585,"Background Escherichia coli Shiga-like toxin 1 normally traffics to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in sensitive mammalian cells from where the catalytic A chain (SLTxA1) dislocates to the cytosol to inactivate ribosomes. Currently, no molecular details of the dislocation process are available. To investigate the mechanism of the dislocation step we expressed SLTxA1 in the ER of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Methodology and Principal Findings Using a combination of growth studies and biochemical tracking in yeast knock-out strains we show that SLTxA1 follows an ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway to enter the cytosol in a step mediated by the transmembrane Hrd1p ubiquitin ligase complex. ER-to-cytosol dislocation of the bulk population of SLTxA1 requires Cdc48p and its ubiquitin-handling co-factor Npl4p, and this population of toxin is terminally dispatched by proteasomal degradation. A small sub-population of SLTxA1 uncouples from this classical ERAD pathway and recovers catalytic activity in the cytosol. The pathway that leads to toxicity is also Hrd1p-dependent but, unlike that for the related ricin A chain toxin, SLTxA1 dislocation does require the catalytic cysteine of Hrd1p. However it does not depend on canonical ubiquitylation since toxin variants lacking endogenous lysyl residues also utilize this pathway, and furthermore there is no requirement for a number of Cdc48p co-factors. Conclusions and Significance The fraction of SLTxA1 that disengages from the ERAD pathway thus does so upstream of Cdc48p interactions and downstream of Hrd1p interactions, in a step that possibly involves de-ubiquitylation. Mechanistically therefore, the dislocation of this toxin is quite distinct from that of conventional ERAD substrates that are normally degraded, and the toxins partially characterised to date that do not require the catalytic cysteine of the major Hrd1p component of the dislocation apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W1982093937,"The ANRS EP45 ""Aging"" study investigates the cellular mechanisms involved in the accelerated aging of HIV-1 infected and treated patients. The data reported focus on mitochondria, organelles known to be involved in cell senescence.49 HIV-1 infected patients untreated with antiretroviral therapy, together with 49 seronegative age- and sex-matched control subjects and 81 HIV-1 infected and treated patients, were recruited by 3 AIDS centres (Marseille, Montpellier, Nice; France; http://clinicaltrials.gov/, NCT01038999). In more than 88% of treated patients, the viral load was <40 copies/ml and the CD4+ cell count was >500/mm(3). ROS (reactive oxygen species) production and ΔΨm (inner membrane potential) were measured by flow cytometry in blood lymphocytes and monocytes (functional parameters). Three mitochondrial network quantitative morphological parameters were computed using confocal microscopy and image analysis. Three PBMC mitochondrial proteins (porin and subunits 2 and 4 of cytochrome C oxidase encoded by mtDNA or nuclear DNA, respectively) were analysed by western blotting.Quantitative changes in PBMC mitochondrial proteins were not induced by either HIV-1 infection or ART. Discriminant analysis integrating functional (ROS production and ΔΨm) or morphological (network volume density, fragmentation and branching) parameters revealed HIV-1 infection and ART differential effects according to cell type. First line ART tended to rescue lymphocyte mitochondrial parameters altered by viral infection, but induced slight changes in monocytes. No statistical difference was found between the effects of three ART regimens on mitochondrial parameters. Correlations between functional parameters and viral load confirmed the damaging effects of HIV-1 in lymphocyte mitochondria.In patients considered to be clinically stable, mitochondria exhibited functional and morphological modifications in PBMCs resulting from either direct or indirect effects of HIV-1 infection (lymphocytes), or from first line ART (monocytes). Together with other tissue impairments, these changes may contribute to global aging."
https://openalex.org/W2055591679,"Background Optical Projection Tomography (OPT) is a microscopic technique that generates three dimensional images from whole mount samples the size of which exceeds the maximum focal depth of confocal laser scanning microscopes. As an advancement of conventional emission-OPT, Scanning Laser Optical Tomography (SLOTy) allows simultaneous detection of fluorescence and absorbance with high sensitivity. In the present study, we employ SLOTy in a paradigm of brain plasticity in an insect model system. Methodology We visualize and quantify volumetric changes in sensory information procession centers in the adult locust, Locusta migratoria. Olfactory receptor neurons, which project from the antenna into the brain, are axotomized by crushing the antennal nerve or ablating the entire antenna. We follow the resulting degeneration and regeneration in the olfactory centers (antennal lobes and mushroom bodies) by measuring their size in reconstructed SLOTy images with respect to the untreated control side. Within three weeks post treatment antennal lobes with ablated antennae lose as much as 60% of their initial volume. In contrast, antennal lobes with crushed antennal nerves initially shrink as well, but regain size back to normal within three weeks. The combined application of transmission-and fluorescence projections of Neurobiotin labeled axotomized fibers confirms that recovery of normal size is restored by regenerated afferents. Remarkably, SLOTy images reveal that degeneration of olfactory receptor axons has a trans-synaptic effect on second order brain centers and leads to size reduction of the mushroom body calyx. Conclusions This study demonstrates that SLOTy is a suitable method for rapid screening of volumetric plasticity in insect brains and suggests its application also to vertebrate preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1990320360,"Enzymes play a fundamental role in almost all biological processes and identification of catalytic residues is a crucial step for deciphering the biological functions and understanding the underlying catalytic mechanisms. In this work, we developed a novel structural feature called MEDscore to identify catalytic residues, which integrated the microenvironment (ME) and geometrical properties of amino acid residues. Firstly, we converted a residue's ME into a series of spatially neighboring residue pairs, whose likelihood of being located in a catalytic ME was deduced from a benchmark enzyme dataset. We then calculated an ME-based score, termed as MEscore, by summing up the likelihood of all residue pairs. Secondly, we defined a parameter called Dscore to measure the relative distance of a residue to the center of the protein, provided that catalytic residues are typically located in the center of the protein structure. Finally, we defined the MEDscore feature based on an effective nonlinear integration of MEscore and Dscore. When evaluated on a well-prepared benchmark dataset using five-fold cross-validation tests, MEDscore achieved a robust performance in identifying catalytic residues with an AUC1.0 of 0.889. At a ≤10% false positive rate control, MEDscore correctly identified approximately 70% of the catalytic residues. Remarkably, MEDscore achieved a competitive performance compared with the residue conservation score (e.g. CONscore), the most informative singular feature predominantly employed to identify catalytic residues. To the best of our knowledge, MEDscore is the first singular structural feature exhibiting such an advantage. More importantly, we found that MEDscore is complementary with CONscore and a significantly improved performance can be achieved by combining CONscore with MEDscore in a linear manner. As an implementation of this work, MEDscore has been made freely accessible at http://protein.cau.edu.cn/mepi/."
https://openalex.org/W1991068821,"Background Epidermal growth factor (EGF), a potent mitogenic protein, plays an important role in the development of cancers, including glioma. Previous studies showed that the EGF +61G/A polymorphism (rs4444903) may lead to an alteration in EGF production and/or activity, which can result in individual susceptibility to glioma. However, published data regarding the association between the +61G/A polymorphism and glioma risk was contradictory. Objective The aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of eligible studies to derive precise estimation of the association of EGF +61G/A with glioma risk. Methods We performed a pooled analysis of seven published studies that included 1,613 glioma cases and 2,267 controls. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of the association. The pooled ORs were performed for codominant model, dominant model, and recessive model, respectively. Results Overall, no significant associations between the EGF +61G/A polymorphism and glioma cancer risk were found for AA versus GG (OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.62–1.45), GA versus GG (OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.72–1.22), AA/GA versus GG (OR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.70–1.23), and AA versus GA/GG (OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.77–1.39). However, in the stratified analysis by ethnicity, the EGF +61G/A polymorphism had a higher risk of glioma development among Asians, but a lower risk among Caucasians. Conclusions Taken together, the results suggest that the EGF +61G/A polymorphism may contribute to the susceptibility of glioma in different ethnic groups."
https://openalex.org/W2018533296,"T2 ribonucleases are conserved nucleases that affect a variety of processes in eukaryotic cells including the regulation of self-incompatibility by S-RNases in plants, modulation of host immune cell responses by viral and schistosome T2 enzymes, and neurological development and tumor progression in humans. These roles for RNaseT2’s can be due to catalytic or catalytic-independent functions of the molecule. Despite this broad importance, the features of RNaseT2 proteins that modulate catalytic and catalytic-independent functions are poorly understood. Herein, we analyze the features of Rny1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to determine the requirements for cleaving tRNA in vivo and for inhibiting cellular growth in a catalytic-independent manner. We demonstrate that catalytic-independent inhibition of growth is a combinatorial property of the protein and is affected by a fungal-specific C-terminal extension, the conserved catalytic core, and the presence of a signal peptide. Catalytic functions of Rny1 are independent of the C-terminal extension, are affected by many mutations in the catalytic core, and also require a signal peptide. Biochemical flotation assays reveal that in rny1Δ cells, some tRNA molecules associate with membranes suggesting that cleavage of tRNAs by Rny1 can involve either tRNA association with, or uptake into, membrane compartments."
https://openalex.org/W2016095136,"The roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) as important regulators of gene expression have been studied intensively. Although most of these investigations have involved the highly expressed form of the two mature miRNA species, increasing evidence points to essential roles for star-form microRNAs (miRNA*), which are usually expressed at much lower levels. Owing to the nature of miRNA biogenesis, it is challenging to use plasmids containing miRNA coding sequences for gain-of-function experiments concerning the roles of microRNA* species. Synthetic microRNA mimics could introduce specific miRNA* species into cells, but this transient overexpression system has many shortcomings. Here, we report that specific miRNA* species can be overexpressed by introducing artificially designed stem-loop sequences into short hairpin RNA (shRNA) overexpression vectors. By our prototypic plasmid, designed to overexpress hsa-miR-146b-3p, we successfully expressed high levels of hsa-miR-146b-3p without detectable change of hsa-miR-146b-5p. Functional analysis involving luciferase reporter assays showed that, like natural miRNAs, the overexpressed hsa-miR-146b-3p inhibited target gene expression by 3′UTR seed pairing. Our demonstration that this method could overexpress two other miRNAs suggests that the approach should be broadly applicable. Our novel strategy opens the way for exclusively stable overexpression of miRNA* species and analyzing their unique functions both in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2072728630,"In organisms, various protective mechanisms against oxidative damaging of proteins exist. Here, we show that cofactor binding is among these mechanisms, because flavin mononucleotide (FMN) protects Azotobacter vinelandii flavodoxin against hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidation. We identify an oxidation sensitive cysteine residue in a functionally important loop close to the cofactor, i.e., Cys69. Oxidative stress causes dimerization of apoflavodoxin (i.e., flavodoxin without cofactor), and leads to consecutive formation of sulfinate and sulfonate states of Cys69. Use of 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD-Cl) reveals that Cys69 modification to a sulfenic acid is a transient intermediate during oxidation. Dithiothreitol converts sulfenic acid and disulfide into thiols, whereas the sulfinate and sulfonate forms of Cys69 are irreversible with respect to this reagent. A variable fraction of Cys69 in freshly isolated flavodoxin is in the sulfenic acid state, but neither oxidation to sulfinic and sulfonic acid nor formation of intermolecular disulfides is observed under oxidising conditions. Furthermore, flavodoxin does not react appreciably with NBD-Cl. Besides its primary role as redox-active moiety, binding of flavin leads to considerably improved stability against protein unfolding and to strong protection against irreversible oxidation and other covalent thiol modifications. Thus, cofactors can protect proteins against oxidation and modification."
https://openalex.org/W2022146348,"The aim of this study was to determine the association between the rs6552828 polymorphism in acyl coenzyme A synthetase (ACSL1) and elite endurance athletic status. We studied 82 Caucasian (Spanish) World/Olympic-class endurance male athletes, and a group of sex and ethnically matched healthy young adults (controls, n = 197). The analyses were replicated in a cohort of a different ethnic origin (Chinese of the Han ethnic group), composed of elite endurance athletes (runners) [cases, n = 241 (128 male)] and healthy sedentary adults [controls, n = 504 (267 male)]. In the Spanish cohort, genotype (P = 0.591) and minor allele (A) frequencies were similar in cases and controls (P = 0.978). In the Chinese cohort, genotype (P = 0.973) and minor allele (G) frequencies were comparable in female endurance athletes and sedentary controls (P = 0.881), whereas in males the frequency of the G allele was higher in endurance athletes (0.40) compared with their controls (0.32, P = 0.040). The odds ratio (95%CI) for an elite endurance Chinese athlete to carry the G allele compared with ethnically matched controls was 1.381 (1.015–1.880) (P-value = 0.04). Our findings suggest that the ACSL1 gene polymorphism rs6552828 is not associated with elite endurance athletic status in Caucasians, yet a marginal association seems to exist for the Chinese (Han) male population."
https://openalex.org/W2145622193,"Phenotypic transformation of mesangial cells (MCs) is implicated in the development of glomerular disease; however, the mechanisms underlying their altered genetic program is still unclear. α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) is known to be a crucial marker for phenotypic transformation of MCs. Recently, E-boxes and the class I basic helix-loop-helix proteins, such as E12 have been shown to regulateα-SMA expression. Therefore, we tried to identify a novel E12 binding protein in MCs and to examine its role in glomerulonephritis. We found that PIASy, one of the protein inhibitors of activated STAT family protein, interacted with E12 by yeast two-hybrid screens and coimmunopreciptation assays. Overexpression of E12 significantly enhanced theα-SMA promoter activity, and the increase was blocked by co-transfection of PIASy, but not by a PIASy RING mutant. In vivo sumoylation assays revealed that PIASy was a SUMO E3 ligase for E12. Furthermore, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) treatment induced expression of both PIASy and E12, consistent with α-SMA expression. Moreover, reduced expression of PIASy protein by siRNA specific for PIASy resulted in increased TGF-β-mediated α-SMA expression. In vivo, PIASy and E12 were dramatically upregulated along with α-SMA and TGF-β in the proliferative phase of Thy1 glomerulonephritis. Furthermore, an association between PIASy and E12 proteins was observed at day 6 by IP-western blotting, but not at day 0. These results suggest that TGF-β up-regulates PIASy expression in MCs to down-regulateα-SMA gene transcription by the interaction with E12."
