https://openalex.org/W2017677393,"Demise of the Lizards Despite pessimistic forecasts from recent studies examining the effects of global climate change on species, and observed extinctions in local geographic areas, there is little evidence so far of global-scale extinctions. Sinervo et al. (p. 894 ; see the Perspective by Huey et al. ) find that extinctions resulting from climate change are currently reducing global lizard diversity. Climate records during the past century were synthesized with detailed surveys of Mexican species at 200 sites over the past 30 years. Temperature change has been so rapid in this region that rates of adaptation have not kept pace with climate change. The models were then extended to all families of lizards at &gt;1000 sites across the globe, and suggest that climate change-induced extinctions are currently affecting worldwide lizard assemblages."
https://openalex.org/W2148791497,"Scale-free dynamics, with a power spectrum following P proportional to f(-beta), are an intrinsic feature of many complex processes in nature. In neural systems, scale-free activity is often neglected in electrophysiological research. Here, we investigate scale-free dynamics in human brain and show that it contains extensive nested frequencies, with the phase of lower frequencies modulating the amplitude of higher frequencies in an upward progression across the frequency spectrum. The functional significance of scale-free brain activity is indicated by task performance modulation and regional variation, with beta being larger in default network and visual cortex and smaller in hippocampus and cerebellum. The precise patterns of nested frequencies in the brain differ from other scale-free dynamics in nature, such as earth seismic waves and stock market fluctuations, suggesting system-specific generative mechanisms. Our findings reveal robust temporal structures and behavioral significance of scale-free brain activity and should motivate future study on its physiological mechanisms and cognitive implications."
https://openalex.org/W2052948442,"We report the construction and analysis of 4,836 heterozygous diploid deletion mutants covering 98.4% of the fission yeast genome providing a tool for studying eukaryotic biology. Comprehensive gene dispensability comparisons with budding yeast--the only other eukaryote for which a comprehensive knockout library exists--revealed that 83% of single-copy orthologs in the two yeasts had conserved dispensability. Gene dispensability differed for certain pathways between the two yeasts, including mitochondrial translation and cell cycle checkpoint control. We show that fission yeast has more essential genes than budding yeast and that essential genes are more likely than nonessential genes to be present in a single copy, to be broadly conserved and to contain introns. Growth fitness analyses determined sets of haploinsufficient and haploproficient genes for fission yeast, and comparisons with budding yeast identified specific ribosomal proteins and RNA polymerase subunits, which may act more generally to regulate eukaryotic cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2072739064,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies are widely used to determine which brain regions are active during particular tasks or behaviours. There is much controversy over the source and interpretation of the BOLD (blood oxygenation level-dependent) signals that this imaging technique detects. Now, using fMRI in combination with optogenetics, a group of excitatory neurons in the rat brain has been identified as a source of the BOLD signals. Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals are the basis for much of the work on which regions of the human brain are active during particular tasks or behaviours, but there is controversy over their source and interpretation. Here a combination of optogenetics and BOLD signal monitoring shows that specific excitatory neurons within a mixed population are sufficient to produce positive BOLD signals, and could be used to map connections. Despite a rapidly-growing scientific and clinical brain imaging literature based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD)1 signals, it remains controversial whether BOLD signals in a particular region can be caused by activation of local excitatory neurons2. This difficult question is central to the interpretation and utility of BOLD, with major significance for fMRI studies in basic research and clinical applications3. Using a novel integrated technology unifying optogenetic4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 control of inputs with high-field fMRI signal readouts, we show here that specific stimulation of local CaMKIIα-expressing excitatory neurons, either in the neocortex or thalamus, elicits positive BOLD signals at the stimulus location with classical kinetics. We also show that optogenetic fMRI (ofMRI) allows visualization of the causal effects of specific cell types defined not only by genetic identity and cell body location, but also by axonal projection target. Finally, we show that ofMRI within the living and intact mammalian brain reveals BOLD signals in downstream targets distant from the stimulus, indicating that this approach can be used to map the global effects of controlling a local cell population. In this respect, unlike both conventional fMRI studies based on correlations14 and fMRI with electrical stimulation that will also directly drive afferent and nearby axons, this ofMRI approach provides causal information about the global circuits recruited by defined local neuronal activity patterns. Together these findings provide an empirical foundation for the widely-used fMRI BOLD signal, and the features of ofMRI define a potent tool that may be suitable for functional circuit analysis as well as global phenotyping of dysfunctional circuitry."
https://openalex.org/W1982447134,"Focal adhesion proteins promote cell adhesion and migration in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional environments. When cells are embedded in a 3D matrix, focal adhesion proteins modulate the speed and persistence of migration by regulating protrusion activity. Focal adhesions are large multi-protein assemblies that form at the basal surface of cells on planar dishes, and that mediate cell signalling, force transduction and adhesion to the substratum. Although much is known about focal adhesion components in two-dimensional (2D) systems, their role in migrating cells in a more physiological three-dimensional (3D) matrix is largely unknown. Live-cell microscopy shows that for cells fully embedded in a 3D matrix, focal adhesion proteins, including vinculin, paxillin, talin, α-actinin, zyxin, VASP, FAK and p130Cas, do not form aggregates but are diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm. Despite the absence of detectable focal adhesions, focal adhesion proteins still modulate cell motility, but in a manner distinct from cells on planar substrates. Rather, focal adhesion proteins in matrix-embedded cells regulate cell speed and persistence by affecting protrusion activity and matrix deformation, two processes that have no direct role in controlling 2D cell speed. This study shows that membrane protrusions constitute a critical motility/matrix-traction module that drives cell motility in a 3D matrix."
https://openalex.org/W2071540056,"Nitrate for Me, Ammonium for You The interdependence of plant nitrogen uptake and plant responses to carbon dioxide is well established, but the influence of inorganic nitrogen form—i.e., whether nitrate or ammonium—has been largely ignored. Bloom et al. (p. 899 ) present evidence from five independent methods in both a monocot and dicot species that carbon dioxide inhibition of nitrate assimilation is a major determinant of plant responses to rising atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide. This finding explains several phenomena, including carbon dioxide acclimation and decline in food quality. The large variation in these phenomena among species, locations, or years derives from the large variation in the relative dependence of plants on nitrate and ammonium as nitrogen sources among species, locations, or years. The relative importance of ammonium and nitrate for plant N nutrition in future cropping systems will be critical for quantity and quality of food."
https://openalex.org/W2161234653,"In contrast with the many studies of stress effects on the brain, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms of resilience, the ability of some individuals to escape the deleterious effects of stress. We found that the transcription factor DeltaFosB mediates an essential mechanism of resilience in mice. Induction of DeltaFosB in the nucleus accumbens, an important brain reward-associated region, in response to chronic social defeat stress was both necessary and sufficient for resilience. DeltaFosB induction was also required for the standard antidepressant fluoxetine to reverse behavioral pathology induced by social defeat. DeltaFosB produced these effects through induction of the GluR2 AMPA glutamate receptor subunit, which decreased the responsiveness of nucleus accumbens neurons to glutamate, and through other synaptic proteins. Together, these findings establish a previously unknown molecular pathway underlying both resilience and antidepressant action."

Human ESCs (hESCs) invariably exhibit signs of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) and are considered developmentally more advanced than their murine counterparts. We describe the establishment of XaXa hESCs derived under physiological oxygen concentrations. Using these cell lines, we demonstrate that (1) differentiation of hESCs induces random XCI in a manner similar to murine ESCs, (2) chronic exposure to atmospheric oxygen is sufficient to induce irreversible XCI with minor changes of the transcriptome, (3) the Xa exhibits heavy methylation of the XIST promoter region, and (4) XCI is associated with demethylation and transcriptional activation of XIST along with H3K27-me3 deposition across the Xi.

Established hESC lines exhibit a remarkable degree of variability with respect to their propensity to differentiate as well as their genetic and epigenetic stability. These differences have often been attributed to variable environmental conditions and culture techniques used to isolate and propagate hESCs, but the exact causes of the observed variability have been difficult to address directly due to genetic heterogeneity of hESCs confounding any comparison between different cell lines. The state of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) can vary greatly not only between hESCs, but also between subcultures of a single hESC line (Hall et al., 2008Hall L.L. Byron M. Butler J. Becker K.A.

Unlike mouse ESCs, all human ESC lines analyzed to date exhibit partial or complete XCI. Many of these lines lack XIST coating on the inactive X (Xi) in the undifferentiated state and do not reactivate XIST gene expression upon differentiation (Hall et al., 2008Hall L.L. Byron M.

Strikingly, hESC cultures exhibit monoallelic expression of X-linked genes, suggesting that XCI in hESCs may have resulted from a nonrandom parental allele specific choice (Shen et al., 2008Shen Y. Matsuno Y. Fouse S.D. Rao N. Root S. Xu R. Pellegrini M. Riggs A.D. Fan G. X-inactivation in female human embryonic stem cells is in a nonrandom pattern and prone to epigenetic alterations.Proc.

However, adult females exhibit random XCI and evidence for imprinted XCI in human extraembryonic tissue is controversial (Payer and Lee, 2008Payer B. Lee J.T. X chromosome dosage compensation: how mammals keep the balance.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2008; 42: 733-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Conversely, random XCI may occur in the ICM of female embryos followed by clonal selection after hESC derivation. Staining of preimplantation female human embryos has shown that at the eight-cell stage XIST foci begin to form and expand to full XIST clouds by the morula and blastocyst stages, consistent with XCI having already occurred at this stage (van den Berg et al., 2009van den Berg I.M. Laven J.S. Stevens M. Jonkers I. Galjaard R.J. Gribnau J. van Doorninck J.H. X chromosome inactivation is initiated in human preimplantation embryos.Am. J. Hum.

In the current study, we examine the intrinsic effects of atmospheric oxygen (∼20%, pO2, 142 mm Hg) on the ability of hESCs to maintain pluripotency, genetic, and epigenetic stability. ESC derivation and maintenance in culture is conventionally performed in atmospheric O2 concentrations (Cowan et al., 2004Cowan C.A. Klimanskaya I. McMahon J. Atienza J. Witmyer J. Zucker J.P.

Bavister B.D. Oxygen tension in the oviduct and uterus of rhesus monkeys, hamsters and rabbits.J. Reprod. Fertil. 1993; 99: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Exposure to 20% O2 results in premature senescence and accumulation of oxidative DNA lesions (Parrinello et al., 2003Parrinello S. Samper E. Krtolica A. Goldstein J. Melov S. Campisi J. Oxygen sensitivity severely limits the replicative lifespan of murine fibroblasts.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar) and it is possible that the hyperoxic conditions used for ESC culture have detrimental effects on cell viability and epigenetic state. Numerous reports have described protective effects of decreasing the O2 concentrations on hESCs originally derived and maintained in atmospheric O2 to more physiological levels such as decreased accumulation of chromosomal abnormalities (Forsyth et al., 2006Forsyth N.R.

Nonetheless, these findings remain controversial as recent studies called into question the beneficial effects of returning hESC lines established in atmospheric O2 to 5% O2 (Chen et al., 2009Chen H.F.

Further evidence supporting the use of physiological O2 for the derivation and maintenance of hESCs comes from studies on preimplantation development and ESC derivation in nonhuman mammals. Exposure to atmospheric O2 has detrimental effects on blastocyst formation rates and on cell proliferation within individual blastocysts. This was observed across many species, including mouse (Harlow and Quinn, 1979Harlow G.M. Quinn P.

To date, such studies have not been performed with human embryos. We demonstrate here that derivation and culture in physiological O2 (∼5%, pO2, 36 mm Hg) aids in maintaining pluripotency and suppressing spontaneous differentiation of hESCs. Strikingly, the derivation and maintenance of hESC cultures in 5% O2 prevented precocious XCI, suggesting that physiological O2 helps to maintain hESCs in a more developmentally immature state. IVF-derived eight-cell embryos were thawed and cultured in 5% O2 until the blastocyst stage prior to hESC derivation in 5% or 20% O2 (Table S1 available online). We established three hESC lines under 5% O2 (designated WIBR1, 2, and 3; Figure S1) and one line under 20% O2 (data not shown). Immediately after stable establishment, each hESC line was split at the first passage, with one half remaining at 5% O2 and the other shifted to culture in 20% O2. The resulting three pairs of genetically identical hESC lines were cultured for prolonged periods (>18 months, Table 1). Three additional hESC lines were derived from cryopreserved blastocysts and will be described later (Table 1).Table 1hESC Derivation in Physiological O2LineIsolation DatePassageSexXi StatushESCsDifferentiated CellsXIST ExpressionX-Linked Gene ExpressionXIST ExpressionX-Linked Gene ExpressionWIBR1-5%6/19/0777MaleXaY−NA−NAWIBR1-20%6/21/0783MaleXaY−NA−NAWIBR2-5%8/9/0734FemaleXaXa−biallelic+biallelicWIBR2-20%8/11/0754FemaleXaXi−monoallelic−monoallelicWIBR3-5%6/3/0868FemaleXaXa−biallelic+biallelicWIBR3-20%6/5/0860FemaleXaXi+monoallelic+monoallelicWIBR4-5%9/11/0914FemaleXaXa−ND+NDWIBR4-20%9/18/0912FemaleXaXi+ND+NDWIBR5-5%9/11/0911FemaleXaXi+ND+NDWIBR5-20%9/18/0911FemaleXaXi+ND+NDWIBR6-5%9/11/099MaleXaY−NA−NAWIBR6-20%9/18/098MaleXaY−NA−NASix hESC lines were derived under 5% O2.

Data is relative to GAPDH. To assess changes in gene expression induced by hyperoxic culture, we analyzed the transcriptome of hESCs after acute (72 hr) or chronic exposure to 20% O2 and compared the transcriptional profiles to hESCs maintained in 5% O2. Acute exposure to 20% O2 induced a dramatic change in global gene expression and resulted in a marked downregulation of genes associated with hypoxia and the HIF pathway (Figure 1A ). Many of these changes were not maintained and approached baseline (5%) levels after chronic exposure to 20% O2 (Figure 1A). Consistent with these observations, hierarchical clustering revealed that under either chronic 20% or 5% O2 culture conditions, gene expression profiles clustered on the basis of the genetic background of the hESCs rather than O2 environment (Figure 1B). We identified 198 genes whose change in expression after acute exposure to 20% O2 was maintained during chronic culture (Figure S4 and Table S2). Gene set enrichment analysis across the three cell lines identified an upregulation of gene sets associated with mitochondrial activity and messenger RNA (mRNA) processing after acute exposure to 20% O2 (Figure S4). Gene sets associated with hypoxia such as the HIF, glycolysis, and gluconeogenesis pathways were downregulated in response to both acute and chronic exposure to 20% O2 (Figure S4).Figure S4Effects of Atmospheric Oxygen Exposure on Gene Expression in hESCs, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Heat map of 198 genes whose expression (on average across WIBR1, WIBR2, and WIBR3) is changed in response to acute culture in 20% O2 and which subsequently maintained that change in gene expression after chronic exposure to 20% O2.(B) Gene set enrichment analysis for gene sets enriched in atmospheric oxygen in cell lines acutely exposed to 20% O2, including gene sets associated with mRNA processing (p = .081, FDR q = .238), mitochondrial activity (p = .062, FDR q = .172), and genes that are downregulated in response to hypoxia (p = .052, FDR q = .163).

(D) Changes in the expression of genes related to maintenance of pluripotency and early lineage specification plotted as fold change in chronic 20% O2 cultures relative to 5% O2. Gene expression analysis of embryonic stem cell and lineage-specific transcripts revealed no significant changes in the expression of the core pluripotency genes OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG, whereas induction of neurectodermal, trophoblast, mesoderm, extraembryonic endoderm, and visceral endoderm genes was observed in hESCs after chronic exposure to 20% O2 (Figure S4). This suggests that the exposure to 20% O2 does not significantly compromise pluripotency but may promote differentiation in a fraction of the cells. We tested whether atmospheric O2 would increase the susceptibility of hESCs to undergo spontaneous differentiation under suboptimal culture conditions. We therefore cultured hESCs on mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) constitutively expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) for 8 days without passaging, thereby triggering spontaneous differentiation. We found that the proportion of cells in the culture expressing SSEA4 and OCT4 was reduced in lines WIBR1 and WIBR2 after acute (72 hr) as well as chronic exposure to 20% O2 (Figure 1C). In contrast WIBR3 remained largely unaffected, with over 90% of cells maintaining OCT4 immunoreactivity under all culture conditions (Figure 1C). This finding highlights the variability of hESC lines in their response to atmospheric O2 and may provide an explanation for the conflicting reports in the literature. To evaluate the consequences of exposure to 20% O2 on the epigenetic stability of hESCs, we assessed the DNA methylation status of several imprinted genes using Sequenom matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry analysis of bisulfite modified DNA, and we observed no significant differences in methylation between 5% or 20% O2 cultures at the DLX5, H19, KCNQ1, NDN, PLAG1, SLC22A18, and SNURF loci (data not shown). One exception was observed at the PEG3 locus, where chronic exposure to 20% O2 was associated with increased CpG methylation. We conclude that the DNA methylation status at numerous imprinted loci remains stable in hESCs cultured in both atmospheric and physiological O2. We next assessed the status of XCI in the two female lines WIBR2 and 3. This is of particular interest since hESCs are similar to murine EpiSCs (Brons et al., 2007Brons I.G. Smithers L.E.

https://openalex.org/W2084913591,"We investigated how different subregions of rodent prefrontal cortex contribute to value-based decision making, by comparing neural signals related to animal's choice, its outcome, and action value in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats performing a dynamic two-armed bandit task. Neural signals for upcoming action selection arose in the mPFC, including the anterior cingulate cortex, only immediately before the behavioral manifestation of animal's choice, suggesting that rodent prefrontal cortex is not involved in advanced action planning. Both OFC and mPFC conveyed signals related to the animal's past choices and their outcomes over multiple trials, but neural signals for chosen value and reward prediction error were more prevalent in the OFC. Our results suggest that rodent OFC and mPFC serve distinct roles in value-based decision making and that the OFC plays a prominent role in updating the values of outcomes expected from chosen actions. We investigated how different subregions of rodent prefrontal cortex contribute to value-based decision making, by comparing neural signals related to animal's choice, its outcome, and action value in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats performing a dynamic two-armed bandit task.

Our results suggest that rodent OFC and mPFC serve distinct roles in value-based decision making and that the OFC plays a prominent role in updating the values of outcomes expected from chosen actions. Rat prefrontal cortex does not convey upcoming action selection signals Previous choice and outcome signals are broadly distributed in rat prefrontal cortex Orbitofrontal cortex encodes both positive and negative reward prediction errors Signals needed to update decision-making strategies converge in orbitofrontal cortex Decisions are influenced by the expectations about the costs and benefits of alternative choices. In an uncertain and dynamically changing environment, therefore, it would be advantageous for a decision maker to continually update such expectations based on the outcomes of previous choices. In reinforcement learning (RL) theory, the estimates for future rewards expected from different actions are referred to as action values, and they are updated according to the errors in predicting the reward obtained at each time step (reward prediction error or RPE; Sutton and Barto, 1998Sutton R.S. Barto A.G. Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998Google Scholar). Decision makers can therefore optimize long-term consequences of their actions simply by choosing the actions with maximum action values. Previous studies have shown that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is an important brain structure for RL (Buckley et al., 2009Buckley M.J. Mansouri F.A. Hoda H. Mahboubi M. Browning P.G. Kwok S.C.

Considering that the PFC comprises a large area of the frontal lobe consisting of many heterogeneous regions, it would be important to identify the distinct computational processes served by different regions within the PFC to understand neural mechanisms underlying value-based decision making. Recently, numerous behavioral, physiological, and neuroimaging studies have found dissociable effects of lesions and regional specialization of neural and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals across different areas of the PFC and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) while humans or monkeys were performing various decision-making tasks (Buckley et al., 2009Buckley M.J.

Orbitofrontal cortex and its contribution to decision-making.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 31-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). As a result, principles for functional specialization within the PFC and ACC are beginning to emerge. For example, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and ACC appear to play particularly important roles in encoding and updating values of expected outcomes (Rushworth et al., 2007aRushworth M.F. Behrens T.E. Rudebeck P.H. Walton M.E. Contrasting roles for cingulate and orbitofrontal cortex in decisions and social behaviour.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2007; 11: 168-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), whereas the lateral PFC appears to be necessary for maintaining in working memory the state representation necessary for identifying optimal choices in a given environment (Buckley et al., 2009Buckley M.J. Mansouri F.A. Hoda H. Mahboubi M. Browning P.G. Kwok S.C. Phillips A. Tanaka K.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 8170-8173Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). On the other hand, similar types of neural signals, such as values and animal's choice, are often found redundantly across different regions of the PFC (Lee, 2006Lee D. Neural basis of quasi-rational decision making.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2006; 16: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, Lee, 2008Lee D. Game theory and neural basis of social decision making.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 404-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), but few studies have compared different areas of the PFC under the same experimental condition (c.f., Buckley et al., 2009Buckley M.J. Mansouri F.A. Hoda H. Mahboubi M. Browning P.G. Kwok S.C. Phillips A. Tanaka K. Dissociable components of rule-guided behavior depend on distinct medial and prefrontal regions.Science. 2009; 325: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Thus, it is still unclear how different regions of the PFC work together for optimal decision making in a dynamic environment. Compared to the primate PFC, less is known about functional differentiation across different regions of the rodent PFC involved in value-based decision making. In the present study, we investigated this issue by examining temporal dynamics of neural signals related to animal's choices, their outcomes and action values across different regions within the rat PFC. In particular, we addressed the following issues. First, we tested whether value processing is a function implemented across all regions within the rat PFC. A number of studies have found value-related signals in the OFC of humans, monkeys and rats (Mainen and Kepecs, 2009Mainen Z.F. Kepecs A.

However, other parts of the primate PFC, including dorsolateral and dorsomedial PFC, and ACC have been shown to convey value signals as well (Kennerley et al., 2009Kennerley S.W. Dahmubed A.F.

Neurosci. 2009; 29: 3627-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that value processing might be a general characteristic of the PFC-ACC network. To our knowledge, value processing in the PFC other than the OFC has not been investigated in rats. Second, we examined whether the rat PFC conveys neural signals related to RPE, which is the difference between the actual and expected rewards (Sutton and Barto, 1998Sutton R.S. Barto A.G. Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998Google Scholar). Brain imaging studies in humans have found RPE signals in the OFC (O'Doherty et al., 2003O'Doherty J.P. Dayan P. Friston K. Critchley H. Dolan R.J. Temporal difference models and reward-related learning in the human brain.Neuron. 2003; 38: 329-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). In monkeys, on the other hand, RPE signals have been found in the ACC (Amiez et al., 2005Amiez C. Joseph J.P. Procyk E. Anterior cingulate error-related activity is modulated by predicted reward.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 21: 3447-3452Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, Matsumoto et al., 2007Matsumoto M. Matsumoto K. Abe H. Tanaka K.

Temporal filtering of reward signals in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex during a mixed-strategy game.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 8366-8377Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), but not in the OFC (Kennerley et al., 2009Kennerley S.W. Dahmubed A.F. Lara A.H. Wallis J.D. Neurons in the frontal lobe encode the value of multiple decision variables.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2009; 21: 1162-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). A recent study in rats also failed to find RPE signals in the OFC (Takahashi et al., 2009Takahashi Y.K. Roesch M.R. Stalnaker T.A. Haney R.Z. Calu D.J. Taylor A.R. Burke K.A. Schoenbaum G. The orbitofrontal cortex and ventral tegmental area are necessary for learning from unexpected outcomes.Neuron. 2009; 62: 269-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Thus, whether and which part of the rat PFC conveys RPE signals remains unclear. Third, we investigated which part of the rat PFC conveys neural signals predictive of animal's upcoming actions. To our knowledge, neural signals for future choice of action have not been clearly shown in the rat PFC. To address these issues, we analyzed the activity of neurons recorded from the medial wall of the rat PFC (mPFC), which consists of the dorsal ACC, prelimbic cortex (PLC), and infralimbic cortex (ILC), and the lateral OFC in rats performing a dynamic two-armed bandit task in which the animals faced two probabilistically reinforced choices in each trial. Six rats each performed a total of 17–30 sessions of a dynamic two-armed bandit task (Huh et al., 2009Huh N. Jo S. Kim H. Sul J.H. Jung M.W. Model-based reinforcement learning under concurrent schedules of reinforcement in rodents.Learn. Mem. 2009; 16: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, Kim et al., 2009Kim H. Sul J.H. Huh N. Lee D. Jung M.W. Role of striatum in updating values of chosen actions.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 14701-14712Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar; Figure 1A ). The animals were allowed to choose freely between two goals that delivered water reward with different probabilities (see Experimental Procedures). Reward probability for each goal was constant within a block of 35–45 trials but changed across four blocks without any sensory cues so that relative reward probabilities could be discovered only by trial and error. The animals started to choose the goal associated with a higher reward probability more frequently within 10–20 trials after a block transition, indicating that they quickly detected the changes in relative reward probabilities and adjusted their behaviors accordingly (Figure 1B). A logistic regression analysis (Huh et al., 2009Huh N. Jo S. Kim H. Sul J.H. Jung M.W. Model-based reinforcement learning under concurrent schedules of reinforcement in rodents.Learn. Mem. 2009; 16: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, Lau and Glimcher, 2005Lau B. Glimcher P.W. Dynamic response-by-response models of matching behavior in rhesus monkeys.J. Exp. Anal. Behav. 2005; 84: 555-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) revealed that a reward obtained from a given choice tended to encourage the animal to make the same choice (Figure 1C). Thus, animal's choice behavior was influenced by the history of animal's choices and their outcomes, with more recent choice outcomes having greater effects. The animals showed stereotyped movement trajectories on the maze (Figure 2B ). We divided animal's behavior into five distinct behavioral stages as in our previous study (Kim et al., 2009Kim H. Sul J.H. Huh N. Lee D. Jung M.W. Role of striatum in updating values of chosen actions.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 14701-14712Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). They were delay (2.0 ± 0.0 s), go (1.0 ± 0.1 s), approach (1.0 ± 0.3 s), reward (7.6 ± 2.3 s), and return (1.9 ± 0.7 s, mean ± SD) stages, with the beginning of a new trial defined as the onset of the delay stage (Figure 2A). The beginning of the approach stage was determined separately for each session as the time when the animal's movement trajectory began to diverge depending on the upcoming goal choice of the animal (Figures 2C and 2D). Therefore, animal's movement trajectory was independent of the upcoming choice of the animal during the time period between the reward and the next approach stages (Figure 2B). On the other hand, the trajectory was different in the early delay stage (1.1 ± 0.6 s, mean ± SD) depending on the previous goal choice of the animal (Figure 2B). Single-unit activity was recorded from a total of 730, 751, and 1148 neurons (≥500 spikes during each recording session) in the dorsal ACC, PLC/ILC, and lateral OFC, respectively (Figure 1D), of six rats. The number of neurons recorded from ILC was small (n = 187), and therefore, the data obtained from the PLC and ILC were combined since the results from these two areas were similar (see Figure S1 available online). We analyzed neural signals related to various internal and external variables using multiple regression (Corrado and Doya, 2007Corrado G. Doya K. Understanding neural coding through the model-based analysis of decision making.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 8178-8180Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We first analyzed neural signals for animal's choice, its outcome (i.e., reward) and their interaction in the current and previous trials (Equation 1; see Experimental Procedures). Fractions of neurons conveying these neural signals are shown in the left, middle and right panel, respectively, in Figure 3A . In all three areas, neural signals for animal's choice [C(t)] were weak before choice was made (in the delay and go stages) but increased steeply after animal's trajectory diverged to reflect its choice (approach, reward, and return stages). The analysis based on a 100 ms time window advancing in 50 ms time steps showed that the choice signal arose approximately 100 (ACC) or 50 (PLC/ILC) ms before the onset of the approach stage only in the mPFC, whereas such signals became significant after the onset of the approach stage in the OFC (see Experimental Procedures for the determination of choice signal onset; Figure 3B). The choice signal then persisted throughout the following trial so that significant levels of previous choice signal [C(t-1)] were found in the delay, go, approach and even in the reward stage (large circles in Figure 3A). Overall, both current and previous choice signals were stronger in the ACC than in the other areas (indicated by triangles in Figure 3A). Neural signals related to choice outcome [R(t)] increased steeply in all three areas after the outcome of animal's choice was revealed in the reward stage, and decreased gradually during the subsequent stages. Similar to the signals related to animal's choice, choice outcome signals also persisted during the next trial so that the previous choice outcome signal [R(t-1)] stayed above chance level in the delay stage. In the OFC, these previous outcome signals were further elevated during the approach and reward stages (Figure 3A). The neural signal for choice outcome two trials before [R(t-2)] was overall weak but above chance level and somewhat elevated during the approach and reward stages in the OFC. Therefore, choice outcome signals were stronger in the OFC than in the other areas. Signals related to animal's choice or its outcome alone are not sufficient, and they must be combined to specify how the decision-making strategy should be updated. Indeed, significant choice × outcome interactions [X(t)] were observed in the reward stage in all three areas (Figure 3A), indicating that many PFC neurons conveyed conjunctive choice and outcome signals. Thus, all regions represented the information necessary for evaluating the consequences of choices. The neural signal for previous choice × previous outcome interaction [X(t-1)] was overall weak (Figure 3A). We then examined neural signals related to action values that were estimated using a simple RL model (Sutton and Barto, 1998Sutton R.S. Barto A.G. Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998Google Scholar). Animal's actual choices were well accounted for by this model (Figure 1B; see Tables S1 and S2), suggesting that this model estimated animal's subjective values well. Using action values estimated with this RL model, therefore, we examined neural signals related to decision value [ΔQ(t)], which was defined as the difference between the left and right action values, and chosen value [Qc(t)] which is the value of the chosen action in the current trial. Whereas action values represent estimates of future rewards expected from different actions (left and right goal choices), decision value represents their difference, hence the relative desirability of left versus right goal choices. Neural signals for decision value, therefore, would be useful for action selection. Neural signals for chosen value, on the other hand, would be useful to update chosen value according to the outcome of animal's choice, because the information on chosen value (estimated future reward) and choice outcome (actual reward) can be combined to compute RPE. Chosen value can be increased or decreased depending on whether the actual outcome is better (positive RPE) or worse (negative RPE) than itself (Sutton and Barto, 1998Sutton R.S. Barto A.G. Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998Google Scholar). We ran a multiple regression analysis that included these value terms in addition to previous choice and previous outcome, which were correlated with decision value and chosen value, respectively (Figure S2). This model also included autoregressive terms to control for autocorrelations in spike counts (Table S4), and current choice, current outcome, and their interaction as explanatory variables (Equation 2). Signals related to decision value were weak, but nevertheless significant (large circles in Figure 4A ) with no significant variation across regions before the animal committed to choose a particular goal (delay and go stages). For example, during the last 1 s of the delay stage, significant numbers of ACC (76, 10.4%, binomial test, p < 0.001), PLC/ILC, (61, 8.1%, p < 0.001), and OFC (95, 8.3%, p < 0.001) neurons modulated their activity according to the decision value. Similar results were obtained when the neural data were analyzed with the decision value replaced with action values in the regression (Equation 2). Action value signals were weak, but significant before animal's choice of action with no significant variation across regions (Figure 4B). Neural signals related to chosen value were weak before animal's goal choice (delay and go stages), but increased during the approach and early reward stages and gradually decayed thereafter (Figure 4). Although significant fractions of neurons modulated their activity according to the chosen value in all three areas in the approach and reward stages (binomial test; large circles in Figure 4), the fraction was significantly greater in the OFC (χ2 test; triangles in Figure 4). The above analyses showed that all the components necessary for updating chosen value, namely the information about animal's choice, its outcome, and chosen value, converge in multiple areas of the PFC during the reward stage. The time courses of these neural signals are shown at a higher temporal resolution in Figure 5A . Neural signals for animal's choice and chosen value arose at least 0.5 s before the outcome of animal's choice was revealed and slowly decayed during the reward stage, and this was particularly noticeable in the OFC. Choice outcome signals then appeared at the onset of the reward stage so that signals related to choice, its outcome and chosen value temporally overlapped during the initial phase of the reward stage. Thus, chosen value signal was uploaded before the choice outcome signal arrived in the OFC and they overlapped briefly in the early reward stage (an example is shown in Figure 5B). The overall pattern was similar in the ACC and PLC/ILC, but neural signals for chosen value were much weaker in these areas compared to the OFC. During the first 1 s of the reward stage, a larger fraction of OFC neurons (235 out of 1148, 20.5%) significantly modulated their activity according to chosen value than ACC (96 out of 730, 13.2%, χ2 test, p < 0.001) and PLC/ILC (101 out of 751, 13.4%, p < 0.001) neurons (Equation 2). Similarly, the fraction of neurons encoding both chosen value and choice outcome during the first 1 s of the reward stage was significantly higher in the OFC (11.6%, 133 out of 1148 neurons) compared to the ACC (5.3%, 39 out of 730, χ2 test, p < 0.001) and PLC/ILC (6.3%, 47 out of 751, p < 0.001). We therefore limit the following description of neural activity related to RPE and updated chosen value to the OFC (for the results from the mPFC; see Table S3 and Figure S3). For the majority of the 133 OFC neurons that significantly modulated their activity according to chosen value as well as choice outcome, activity was better accounted for by the model containing RPE (Equation 3) than that containing updated chosen value (Equation 4; 83 out of 133, 62.4%; χ2 tests, p < 0.001), indicating that OFC neurons largely encoded RPE during the initial phase of the reward stage. Because RPE and updated chosen value are computed by the difference between and weighted sum of choice outcome and chosen value, respectively (RPE = R(t) – Qc(t) and updated chosen value = R(t) + (1-α)Qc(t), where α is learning rate and 0 < α < 1; see Experimental Procedures), those neurons with the opposite signs of the coefficients for chosen value and choice outcome are expected to modulate their activity according to RPE. Conversely, those neurons with the same signs of their coefficients are expected to modulate their activity according to updated chosen value. Indeed, the 133 OFC neurons, except one, modulated their activity according to RPE or updated chosen value as predicted by the relative signs of the regression coefficients associated with chosen value and choice outcome during the first 1 s of the reward stage (Figure 6). Temporal profiles of the activity of these OFC neurons around the time of reward delivery are shown in Figure 7A according to the signs of the coefficients for chosen value and choice outcome (see Figure S4 for individual examples). Mean normalized activity of these OFC neurons during the first 1 s of the reward stage showed largely linear relationships with RPE (positive RPE-slope neurons: n = 44, r = 0.979, p < 0.001; negative RPE-slope neurons: n = 40, r = −0.951, p < 0.001) or updated chosen value (positive updated value-slope neurons: n = 14, r = 0.978, p < 0.001; negative updated value-slope neurons: n = 35, r = −0.980, p < 0.001; Figure 7B).Figure 7OFC Population Activity Related to RPE or Updated Chosen ValueShow full captionActivity of OFC neurons encoding both choice outcome (R(t)) and chosen value (Qc(t)) during the first 1 s of the reward stage were analyzed (n = 133).(A) The 133 OFC neurons were divided into 4 groups according to the signs of the regression coefficients for choice outcome and chosen value, and normalized spike density functions (divided by the peak value of each neuron's spike density function averaged for all trials) were plotted according to eight equally divided ranges of RPE or updated chosen value (upQc).

https://openalex.org/W2106172517,"One of the most intriguing aspects of adaptive behavior involves the inference of regularities and rules in ever-changing environments. Rules are often deduced through evidence-based learning which relies on the prefrontal cortex (PFC). This is a highly dynamic process, evolving trial by trial and therefore may not be adequately captured by averaging single-unit responses over numerous repetitions. Here, we employed advanced statistical techniques to visualize the trajectories of ensembles of simultaneously recorded medial PFC neurons on a trial-by-trial basis as rats deduced a novel rule in a set-shifting task. Neural populations formed clearly distinct and lasting representations of familiar and novel rules by entering unique network states. During rule acquisition, the recorded ensembles often exhibited abrupt transitions, rather than evolving continuously, in tight temporal relation to behavioral performance shifts. These results support the idea that rule learning is an evidence-based decision process, perhaps accompanied by moments of sudden insight."
https://openalex.org/W1968650783,"A photoactivatable Rac construct reveals that localized Rac activation in one Drosophila border cell is sufficient to induce protrusion in that cell, with concomitant JNK-dependent retraction in neighbouring cells. The small GTPase Rac induces actin polymerization, membrane ruffling and focal contact formation in cultured single cells1 but can either repress or stimulate motility in epithelial cells depending on the conditions2,3. The role of Rac in collective epithelial cell movements in vivo, which are important for both morphogenesis and metastasis4,5,6,7, is therefore difficult to predict. Recently, photoactivatable analogues of Rac (PA-Rac) have been developed, allowing rapid and reversible activation or inactivation of Rac using light8. In cultured single cells, light-activated Rac leads to focal membrane ruffling, protrusion and migration. Here we show that focal activation of Rac is also sufficient to polarize an entire group of cells in vivo, specifically the border cells of the Drosophila ovary. Moreover, activation or inactivation of Rac in one cell of the cluster caused a dramatic response in the other cells, suggesting that the cells sense direction as a group according to relative levels of Rac activity. Communication between cells of the cluster required Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) but not guidance receptor signalling. These studies further show that photoactivatable proteins are effective tools in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2060961033,"Polycomb Repressor Complexes (PRCs) are important regulators of embryogenesis. In embryonic stem (ES) cells many genes that regulate subsequent stages in development are enriched at their promoters for PRC1, PRC2 and Ser 5-phosphorylated RNA Polymerase II (RNAP), and contain domains of 'bivalent' chromatin (enriched for H3K4me3; histone H3 di- or trimethylated at Lys 4 and H3K27me3; histone H3 trimethylated at Lys 27). Loss of individual PRC components in ES cells can lead to gene de-repression and to unscheduled differentiation. Here we show that Jarid2 is a novel subunit of PRC2 that is required for the co-recruitment of PRC1 and RNAP to genes that regulate development in ES cells. Jarid2-deficient ES cells showed reduced H3K4me2/me3 and H3K27me3 marking and PRC1/PRC2 recruitment, and did not efficiently establish Ser 5-phosporylated RNAP at target genes. ES cells lacking Jarid2, in contrast to previously characterized PRC1 and PRC2 mutants, did not inappropriately express PRC2 target genes. Instead, they show a severely compromised capacity for successful differentiation towards neural or mesodermal fates and failed to correctly initiate lineage-specific gene expression in vitro. Collectively, these data indicate that transcriptional priming of bivalent genes in pluripotent ES cells is Jarid2-dependent, and suggests that priming is critical for subsequent multi-lineage differentiation."

Their apical surface is covered by cilia that beat in a coordinated fashion to facilitate circulation of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The genetic factors that govern the development and function of ependymal cilia remain poorly understood. We found that the planar cell polarity cadherins Celsr2 and Celsr3 control these processes. In Celsr2-deficient mice, the development and planar organization of ependymal cilia are compromised, leading to defective CSF dynamics and hydrocephalus. In Celsr2 and Celsr3 double mutant ependyma, ciliogenesis is markedly impaired, resulting in lethal hydrocephalus. The membrane distribution of Vangl2 and Fzd3, two key planar cell polarity proteins, was disturbed in Celsr2 mutants, and even more so in Celsr2 and Celsr3 double mutants. Our findings suggest that planar cell polarity signaling is involved in ependymal cilia development and in the pathophysiology of hydrocephalus, with possible implications in other ciliopathies."

Increasing drug-resistance is an imminent public health disaster, and we urgently need to find new drugs. The recently acquired malarial genomes provide a plethora of targets. However, due to the genetic intractability of the parasite, it has been difficult to identify essential genes in the clinically relevant blood-stage of the parasite. Dvorin et al. (p. 910 ) investigated the function of a Plasmodium falciparum plant-like calcium-dependent protein kinase, PfCDPK5, which is expressed in the invasive blood-stage forms of the parasite. A system for conditional protein expression allowed the production of a functional knockout in the bloodstream stage of the parasite. PfCDPK5 was required for parasite egress from the human host erythrocyte, an essential step in the parasite life cycle."

In cortical pyramidal cells (PCs), this AP back-propagation is supported by dendritic voltage-gated Na+ (Nav) channels, whose molecular identity is unknown. Using a highly sensitive electron microscopic immunogold technique, we revealed the presence of the Nav1.6 subunit in hippocampal CA1 PC proximal and distal dendrites. Here, the subunit density is lower by a factor of 35 to 80 than that found in axon initial segments. A gradual decrease in Nav1.6 density along the proximodistal axis of the dendritic tree was also detected without any labeling in dendritic spines. Our results reveal the characteristic subcellular distribution of the Nav1.6 subunit, identifying this molecule as a key substrate enabling dendritic excitability."
https://openalex.org/W2011391168,"Photoreceptive, melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) encode ambient light (irradiance) for the circadian clock, the pupillomotor system, and other influential behavioral/physiological responses. mRGCs are activated both by their intrinsic phototransduction cascade and by the rods and cones. However, the individual contribution of each photoreceptor class to irradiance responses remains unclear. We address this deficit using mice expressing human red cone opsin, in which rod-, cone-, and melanopsin-dependent responses can be identified by their distinct spectral sensitivity. Our data reveal an unexpectedly important role for rods. These photoreceptors define circadian responses at very dim ""scotopic"" light levels but also at irradiances at which pattern vision relies heavily on cones. By contrast, cone input to irradiance responses dissipates following light adaptation to the extent that these receptors make a very limited contribution to circadian and pupillary light responses under these conditions. Our data provide new insight into retinal circuitry upstream of mRGCs and optimal stimuli for eliciting irradiance responses."
https://openalex.org/W2067543592,"Adolescents are thought to be hypersensitive to rewards. Using model-based fMRI, the authors identify elevated reward prediction error signals in the striatum during adolescence, which could contribute to the increased reward-seeking behavior seen during this stage of development. Previous work has shown that human adolescents may be hypersensitive to rewards, but it is not known which aspect of reward processing is responsible for this. We separated decision value and prediction error signals and found that neural prediction error signals in the striatum peaked in adolescence, whereas neural decision value signals varied depending on how value was modeled. This suggests that heightened dopaminergic prediction error responsivity contributes to adolescent reward seeking."

https://openalex.org/W2011075614,"The innate antiviral response is mediated, at least in part, by Toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLR3 signaling is activated in response to viral infection, and the absence of TLR3 in mice significantly increases mortality after infection with enteroviruses that cause myocarditis and/or dilated cardiomyopathy. We screened TLR3 in patients diagnosed with enteroviral myocarditis/cardiomyopathy and identified a rare variant in one patient as well as a significantly increased occurrence of a common polymorphism compared with controls. Expression of either variant resulted in significantly reduced TLR3-mediated signaling after stimulation with synthetic double-stranded RNA. Furthermore, Coxsackievirus B3 infection of cell lines expressing mutated TLR3 abrogated activation of the type I interferon pathway, leading to increased viral replication. TLR3-mediated type I interferon signaling required cellular autophagy and was suppressed by 3-methyladenine and bafilomycin A1, by inhibitors of lysosomal proteolysis, and by reduced expression of Beclin 1, Atg5, or microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3beta (MAP1LC3beta). However, TLR3-mediated signaling was restored upon exogenous expression of Beclin 1 or a variant MAP1LC3beta fusion protein refractory to RNA interference. These data suggest that individuals harboring these variants may have a blunted innate immune response to enteroviral infection, leading to reduced viral clearance and an increased risk of cardiac pathology."

MCPH is thought to arise from alterations in the size of the neural progenitor pool, but the cause of this defect has not been thoroughly explored. We find that one of the genes associated with MCPH, Cdk5rap2, is highly expressed in the neural progenitor pool and that its loss results in a depletion of apical progenitors and increased cell-cycle exit leading to premature neuronal differentiation. We link Cdk5rap2 function to the pericentriolar material protein pericentrin, loss of function of which is associated with MOPDII. Depletion of pericentrin in neural progenitors phenocopies effects of Cdk5rap2 knockdown and results in decreased recruitment of Cdk5rap2 to the centrosome.

The developing cortex can be divided into the ventricular zone (VZ), subventricular zone (SVZ), intermediate zone (IZ), and cortical plate (CP). Neural progenitors reside in the VZ and SVZ, where they divide to produce immature neurons. These migrate through the IZ before coming to rest in the CP, where they fully differentiate. The centrosome is the organelle responsible for nucleating and organizing the majority of microtubule structures in animal cells. It plays a central role in multiple processes important to corticogenesis. Altered protein expression that weakens the microtubule link between the centrosome and oscillating nuclei can disrupt interkinetic nuclear migration and alter neurogenesis (Xie et al., 2007Xie Z.

Our study sought to determine the role of one of these proteins, Cdk5rap2, in mammalian corticogenesis.

Another centrosome protein, pericentrin, has been linked to microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II (MOPD II), a syndrome characterized by microcephaly, intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation, and skeletal abnormalities (Majewski et al., 1982Majewski F.

To obtain insights into the mechanisms underlying MCPH, we sought to examine the role of Cdk5rap2 in corticogenesis. We examined the expression of Cdk5rap2 in the developing cortex and confirm its expression in neural progenitors, where it localizes to the centrosome. Small hairpin-mediated knockdown of Cdk5rap2 starting at E11.5 resulted in a redistribution of cells between cortical zones, with more cells exiting the cell cycle and differentiating into neurons. There was also a change in the makeup of the progenitor pool following knockdown, with fewer apical progenitors and more basal progenitors comprising the overall pool. Interestingly, we observed a functional association of Cdk5rap2 with pericentrin, wherein pericentrin recruits Cdk5rap2 to the centrosome to support its critical role in the maintenance of the progenitor pool during corticogenesis. Together, these findings reveal a functional relationship between two centrosome proteins that regulate neurogenesis with important implications for the manifestation of diseases characterized by microcephaly. The microcephaly phenotype that is the hallmark of MCPH is postulated to arise through deviations in the normal proliferative program of neural progenitors that occurs during corticogenesis. We therefore wanted to examine the expression pattern of Cdk5rap2 in the developing cortex. To do so, we generated a Cdk5rap2 antibody that recognizes the Cdk5rap2 amino-terminus. Purified antibody specifically detected full-length flag-tagged Cdk5rap2 (see Figure S1A available online). In order to examine the time course of Cdk5rap2 expression in the developing mouse brain, we prepared whole-brain extracts at different ages. Cdk5rap2 was detectable at E9.5 as a band greater than 200 kDa (Figure 1A ). This band peaked in intensity between E10.5 and E13.5, remained robust at E15.5, and declined thereafter. We also detected a doublet of ∼90 kDa in extracts beginning at E13.5 that increased in intensity through P7.5, mirroring the decline of the larger species. This doublet may represent alternative Cdk5rap2 isoforms. We conclude that Cdk5rap2 is expressed in the developing brain and that its expression peaks during periods of active neurogenesis in the developing neocortex. To examine the spatial expression pattern of Cdk5rap2 in the developing neocortex, we probed coronal neocortical sections from mouse embryos harvested at E14.5. Cdk5rap2 antibody displayed a punctate staining pattern apparent in all cortical layers (Figure 1B, bottom). Cdk5rap2 signal was detectable in Tuj1-positive neurons of the embryonic cortical plate (Figure S2B). We observed the most intense signal at the luminal surface of the VZ. This signal was punctate and present in the apical endfeet of nestin-positive progenitors (Figures 1B, bottom right panel, and 1C). Cdk5rap2 puncta overlapped almost completely with those of the centrosome protein pericentrin in images of the ventricular surface, demonstrating that our antibody detects a true centrosome signal (Figure 1D). Cdk5rap2 signal was also detectable in nestin-positive cultured neural progenitors where it colocalized with centrosome proteins (Figure S2C). We conclude that Cdk5rap2 is expressed in nestin-positive neural progenitor cells of the developing neocortex during neurogenesis, and that it localizes to the centrosome. In order to determine what role Cdk5rap2 plays in neurogenesis, we developed and screened small hairpin expression constructs capable of targeting Cdk5rap2 transcript. We identified three different small hairpin constructs (shC1, shC2, and shC3) capable of knocking down expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Cdk5rap2, endogenous Cdk5rap2 in cultured cell lines, and in utero electroporated cells in brain slices (Figure S2). We coelectroporated cells of the dorsal cortex with a GFP-expression plasmid as well as one of the small hairpin constructs at day E11.5 and harvested embryos 72 hr later, at E14.5. We then analyzed the distribution of GFP-positive cells between different zones of the developing neocortex. The majority of cells were found in either the IZ or CP, but a sizable population remained in the VZ and SVZ (Figures 2A and 2B ). Knockdown of Cdk5rap2 resulted in a significant alteration in cell distribution between cortical zones. Specifically, knockdown resulted in significantly fewer cells remaining in the VZ/SVZ (group, n; control, n = 6; shC1, n = 7; shC2, n = 6; shC3, n = 3) and more cells entering the IZ or CP. Coelectroporation of a Cdk5rap2 construct resistant to shC2-mediated knockdown (Cdk5rap2res) and shC2 was able to restore cellular distribution to approximately control values (control + vector, n = 3; shC2 + vector, n = 4; shC2 + Cdk5rap2res, n = 4) (Figure S4). In order to determine whether this redistribution of cells was a transient effect of knockdown, we also performed in utero electroporation with control hairpin or shC2 and harvested electroporated brains at E17.5. We found that the effect of Cdk5rap2 on cell distribution was more pronounced following a further 72 hr of small hairpin expression (Figures 2C and 2D). A significantly larger fraction was found in the IZ and CP following Cdk5rap2 knockdown (control and shC2, n = 3). Moreover, the VZ/SVZ was virtually cleared of cells in the knockdown group (Figure 2C, far right panel). Following cell-cycle exit in the VZ and SVZ, cells generally migrate to the CP. Migration takes place simultaneously with the process of neuronal differentiation. To determine whether the redistribution of cells we observed is correlated with cell differentiation we stained for the neuronal marker Tuj1. In control brains, most electroporated cells were found in regions of the cortex that robustly expressed Tuj1. However, a noticeable portion were located in the Tuj1− region of the VZ (Figure 3A , top row). Following Cdk5rap2 knockdown, a significantly larger portion of cells were found in Tuj1+ regions of the cortex, and many cells in the VZ expressed Tuj1 (Figures 3A and 3C; control, shC1, shC2, and shC3, n = 3). Additionally, coexpression of shC3 and a GFP expression plasmid regulated by a NeuroD promoter (pNeuroD-GFP) indicated that significantly more electroporated cells were at a postmitotic stage compared with controls (Figure S4; control and shC3, n = 3). These observations indicate that knockdown of Cdk5rap2 levels results in an increased propensity for neurons to differentiate. The CP is formed in an inside-out manner, with early-born neurons situated in the deeper layers (Angevine and Sidman, 1961Angevine Jr., J.B. Sidman R.L. Autoradiographic study of cell migration during histogenesis of cerebral cortex in the mouse.Nature. 1961; 192: 766-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). FoxP2 is a marker of layer 6 neurons, and is first visible in the neocortex at E14.5 (Ferland et al., 2003Ferland R.J. Cherry T.J. Preware P.O. Morrisey E.E. Walsh C.A. Characterization of Foxp2 and Foxp1 mRNA and protein in the developing and mature brain.J. Comp. Neurol. 2003; 460: 266-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Based on the fact that we observed increased Tuj1 costaining and fewer GFP+ cells in the VZ/SVZ at E14.5 following Cdk5rap2 knockdown, we hypothesized that we should observe an increase in neurons born at this stage following knockdown. We therefore quantified the fraction of GFP+ cells in the IZ and CP (i.e., the postmitotic population) that costained for FoxP2 at E17.5. We found that a significantly larger fraction of this cell population expresses FoxP2 after knockdown (Figures 3E and 3F; control and shC2, n = 3). Additionally, we quantified GFP+ cell distribution across neuronal layers at P6 (Figures 3B and 3D). We found that in Cdk5rap2 knockdown samples a significantly larger fraction of the total GFP+ cell population was located in layer 6, a significantly smaller fraction was found in layer 5, and there was a trend toward a smaller fraction being found in layer 2/3 and 4 compared with controls (control and shC2, n = 4). Thus, we conclude that Cdk5rap2 knockdown results in an increased propensity for cells to differentiate into neurons at early time points during corticogenesis. We also asked whether increased neuronal differentiation is a property restricted to cells exposed to Cdk5rap2 knockdown at early time points, or whether Cdk5rap2 knockdown continues to influence the differentiation of actively cycling cells at later time points. To investigate this possibility, we performed in utero electroporation surgery, and at E14.5 we pulse labeled the actively cycling progenitors in electroporated brains by 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) injection into pregnant dams. We then waited a further 72 hr before quantifying the distribution of BrdU-labeled GFP-positive cells within the cortex. The corticothalamic and corticofugal axon tracts serve as an approximate border between the IZ and the CP. Progenitor cells reside in the VZ and SVZ while recently differentiated neurons are found in the IZ. The CP consists of neurons that have either finished migrating or are completing radial migration. In order to obtain an idea of how Cdk5rap2 knockdown affects differentiation of actively cycling progenitors at the E14.5 time point, we examined the distribution of the BrdU, GFP double-positive cell population between the region below and within the axon tracts and the region above the upper border of the axon tracts (Figure 3G). We found that at E17.5 fewer BrdU-labeled cells remained in the proliferative and transitional IZ regions below the upper border of the axon tracts region (control and shC2, n = 3) and significantly more BrdU-labeled cells were positioned above the axon tracts region compared to control samples (Figure 3H). This demonstrates that Cdk5rap2 knockdown results in increased neuronal differentiation of neural progenitor cells even at relatively later stages of neurogenesis. Progenitor cells of the embryonic neocortex are actively cycling cells that can give rise to both immature neurons and more progenitors. Newly born neurons undergo neuronal differentiation while progenitor daughters reenter the cell cycle. Because knockdown of Cdk5rap2 increased the observed level of neuronal differentiation, we asked whether this increase coincided with changes in proliferative activity. We performed in utero electroporation and injected pregnant dams with BrdU at E13.5. We then harvested electroporated brains at E14.5 and determined the 24 hr BrdU-labeling index within the GFP-positive cell population (Figures 4A and 4B ). Knockdown of Cdk5rap2 led to a significant decrease in the 24 hr BrdU-labeling index compared to controls (all conditions, n = 3). The decrease we observed indicates that fewer cells passed through a single S phase following Cdk5rap2 knockdown, indicative of decreased cell-cycle activity. We also costained the same sections for Ki-67 in order to mark the actively proliferating cell population (Figure 4A, column iii), and determined the cell-cycle exit index (Figure 4C). Cdk5rap2 knockdown resulted in a significant increase in cell-cycle exit compared with controls (all conditions, n = 3). Thus, depletion of Cdk5rap2 results in increased cell-cycle exit, consistent with a decrease in cell proliferation. We also stained electroporated brains with the mitotic marker phosphohistone H3 (PHH3) (Figure 4D). Cdk5rap2 knockdown correlated with a significantly lowered mitotic index at this stage as assessed by PHH3 overlap with GFP (Figure 4E, all conditions, n = 3). Taken together, these observations demonstrate that Cdk5rap2 depletion results in reduced proliferative activity and a concomitant increase in cell-cycle exit. We did not observe any increase in cleaved caspase 3 (CC3) staining following Cdk5rap2 knockdown, excluding apoptosis as an explanation for the phenotypes we observed (Figure S5). When we examined the position of individual mitotic events, we found that more cells in the mitotic population mitosed away from the ventricular surface following Cdk5rap2 knockdown compared with controls (Figure S6A; control and shC2, n = 5). One potential explanation for this change is an alteration in the makeup of the neural progenitor pool as apical progenitors normally divide at the ventricular surface whereas basal progenitors are prone to divide at more basal positions (Farkas and Huttner, 2008Farkas L.M. Huttner W.B. The cell biology of neural stem and progenitor cells and its significance for their proliferation versus differentiation during mammalian brain development.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). We examined the makeup of the progenitor pool in control and Cdk5rap2 knockdown conditions at E14.5 and found that knockdown led to a significant decrease in the proportion of apical progenitors identified by Pax6 (Figures 5A and 5B ; control and shC2, n = 3) and a significant increase in the proportion of basal progenitors identified by Tbr2 (Figures 5C and 5D; control and shC2, n = 6). Endfeet of apical progenitors following knockdown appeared grossly normal, and we did not identify any obvious defects in localization or expression of several apical polarity markers (Figure S6G). Thus, Cdk5rap2 levels modulate the makeup of the progenitor pool, providing an explanation for the increased cell-cycle exit and neuronal differentiation observed following knockdown. We also found that Cdk5rap2 knockdown had significant effects upon cell-cycle dynamics. We observed that knockdown of Cdk5rap2 in Neuro-2A (N2A) cells (Figure S6B) resulted in a significant shift in the proportion of cells to the G0/G1 population from the S phase population (Figure S6D; T cell receptor coreceptor CD8 negative control small hairpin (CD8), n = 4; shC1, n = 4; shC2, n = 3). We also found that the"
https://openalex.org/W2055895089,"Staphylococcal superantigen-carrying pathogenicity islands (SaPIs) are discrete, chromosomally integrated units of approximately 15 kilobases that are induced by helper phages to excise and replicate. SaPI DNA is then efficiently encapsidated in phage-like infectious particles, leading to extremely high frequencies of intra- as well as intergeneric transfer. In the absence of helper phage lytic growth, the island is maintained in a quiescent prophage-like state by a global repressor, Stl, which controls expression of most of the SaPI genes. Here we show that SaPI derepression is effected by a specific, non-essential phage protein that binds to Stl, disrupting the Stl-DNA complex and thereby initiating the excision-replication-packaging cycle of the island. Because SaPIs require phage proteins to be packaged, this strategy assures that SaPIs will be transferred once induced. Several different SaPIs are induced by helper phage 80alpha and, in each case, the SaPI commandeers a different non-essential phage protein for its derepression. The highly specific interactions between different SaPI repressors and helper-phage-encoded antirepressors represent a remarkable evolutionary adaptation involved in pathogenicity island mobilization."

In addition to neuroligins and LRRTMs, neurexins bind to dystroglycan (Sugita et al., 2001Sugita S. Saito F. Tang J. Satz J. Campbell K. Südhof T.C. A stoichiometric complex of neurexins and dystroglycan in brain.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and to neurexophilins (Petrenko et al., 1996Petrenko A.G.

Vertebrate genomes contain three neurexin genes, each of which expresses larger α- and smaller β-neurexins from distinct promoters (Rowen et al., 2002Rowen L. Young J. Birditt B. Kaur A. Madan A.

Furthermore, extensive alternative splicing of the primary transcripts of all α- and β-neurexins additionally diversifies neurexins, resulting in potentially thousands of evolutionarily conserved isoforms that are differentially expressed in brain (Ushkaryov et al., 1994Ushkaryov Y.A.

In mice, deletion of α-neurexins causes a presynaptic phenotype that includes a major decrease in action-potential-evoked neurotransmitter release, and a massive impairment in Ca2+-channel function (Missler et al., 2003Missler M. Zhang W. Rohlmann A. Kattenstroth G. Hammer R.E. Gottmann K.

Südhof T.C. Structure and evolution of neurexin genes: insight into the mechanism of alternative splicing.Genomics. 2002; 79: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) also causes an ultrastructural and functional disorganization of neuromuscular junctions (Li et al., 2007Li J.

Consistent with a presynaptic localization and suggestive of a synaptogenic function, overexpressed neurexins in nonneuronal cells induce formation of postsynaptic specializations in cocultured neurons (Graf et al., 2004Graf E.R. Zhang X. Jin S.X. Linhoff M.W. Craig A.M.

Chen L. Postsynaptic assembly induced by neurexin-neuroligin interaction and neurotransmitter.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 6137-6142Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). However, neurexins may also have postsynaptic effects because α-neurexin KO mice display a relative loss of postsynaptic NMDA-receptor activity (Kattenstroth et al., 2004Kattenstroth G. Tantalaki E. Südhof T.C. Gottmann K. Missler M. Postsynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor function requires alpha-neurexins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 2607-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and neurexins may partly localize postsynaptically (Taniguchi et al., 2007Taniguchi H. Gollan L. Scholl F.G. Mahadomrongkul V. Dobler E. Limthong N. Peck M. Aoki C. Scheiffele P. Silencing of neuroligin function by postsynaptic neurexins.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 2815-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Viewed together, the existing data thus suggest that neurexins function as presynaptic cell-adhesion molecules with essential functions in all organisms tested. However, no clear-cut view of the exact nature of these functions has emerged. Whereas the genetic data in mice and flies argue for a role in synapse assembly and function, but not in synaptogenesis (Missler et al., 2003Missler M. Zhang W. Rohlmann A. Kattenstroth G.

Because the effects of neurexin overexpression in neurons have not been examined, it is unclear whether neurexins generally trigger formation of postsynaptic specializations. Moreover, a flurry of recent human genetics studies suggested that changes in the neurexin-1α gene are associated with autism (Szatmari et al., 2007Szatmari P. Paterson A.D. Zwaigenbaum L. Roberts W.

Neuroligins and neurexins link synaptic function to cognitive disease.Nature. 2008; 455: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). Here, we show that neurexins unexpectedly interact with GABAA receptors, and that overexpression of neurexins in neurons is not synaptogenic, but selectively inhibits GABAergic synaptic responses by a neuroligin-independent mechanism. These data suggest that neurexins may organize synapses not only via trans-synaptic interactions with postsynaptic cell-adhesion molecules, but also with neurotransmitter receptors. When neuroligins or neurexins are overexpressed in nonneuronal cells that are cocultured with neurons, neuroligins induce formation of presynaptic specializations in the cocultured neurons, while neurexins induce formation of postsynaptic specializations (Scheiffele et al., 2000Scheiffele P.

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 6137-6142Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of neuroligins in neurons increases synapse numbers (Chih et al., 2004Chih B. Afridi S.K. Clark L. Scheiffele P. Disorder-associated mutations lead to functional inactivation of neuroligins.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1471-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, Boucard et al., 2005Boucard A.A. Chubykin A.A. Comoletti D. Taylor P. Südhof T.C.

Neurosci. 2009; 29: 10843-10854Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that overexpression of neurexins in neurons should also increase synapse numbers. We infected cultured neurons with lentiviruses expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) alone or together with neurexin-2β, such that virtually all neurons are infected. We then measured in these neurons spontaneous miniature excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs and mIPSCs, respectively). Neurexin-2β caused no change in mEPSCs, but surprisingly induced an ∼2-fold decrease in mIPSC frequency, without a significant change in mIPSC amplitude (Figures 1A, 1B , S1A, and S1B). EGFP alone had no effect. We next recorded evoked synaptic responses (ESPCs and IPSCs), and detected a similar selective ∼2-fold decrease in IPSC amplitude and charge, again without a significant change in EPSCs (Figures 1C and 1D). This selective impairment in inhibitory GABAergic synaptic transmission by neurexin-2β was independent of alternative splicing at splice site 4 (Figures 1E and 1F). Using immunocytochemistry, we found that neurexin-2β had no significant effect on the number or size of inhibitory synapses (Figures 1G and 1H). Protein quantitations showed that neurexin-2β caused a small but significant decrease in the levels of pre- and postsynaptic proteins specific for GABAergic synapses, without changing their mRNA levels (Figures 1I, 1J, and S1C). Thus, contrary to expectations, increasing neuronal neurexin-2β expression decreased the function of GABAergic but not glutamatergic synapses, without altering synapse numbers. We next transfected neurons with neurexin-2β or a control plasmid, such that only a small percentage of neurons express neurexin-2β, and recorded from the transfected neurons that were identified via cotransfected cyan fluorescent protein (CFP). Similar to lentiviral delivery of neurexin-2β, transfection of neurexin-2β caused a selective >2-fold decrease in mIPSC frequency (Figures 2A and S2A) and in evoked IPSC amplitude, without altering EPSCs (Figures 2B–2E). To ensure specificity of the observed effect, we measured IPSCs in neighboring transfected and nontransfected neurons on the same coverslip (Figure 2B). Only transfected neurons expressing neurexin-2β exhibited depressed GABAergic synaptic responses. The neurexin-2β induced decrease in IPSCs was not alleviated when neurotransmitter release was increased by elevating the extracellular Ca2+ concentration (Figures 2C and 2D). Moreover, IPSCs induced by hypertonic sucrose (which induces exocytosis of all readily releasable vesicles) were also significantly decreased by transfected neurexin-2β (Figure 2F). Similar to panneuronal lentiviral expression of neurexin-2β, transfection of neurexin-2β did not significantly change the density of excitatory or inhibitory synapses (Figures S2B–S2E). Immunocytochemically, no change in the postsynaptic neuroligin signal was observed, whereas we detected a small but significant decrease in the synaptic signal for GABA-Aα1 receptors and GAD65 (Figure 2G), consistent with the decrease in GABAergic synaptic protein levels after lentiviral expression of neurexin-2β (Figures 1I and 1J). To test whether all neurexins decrease GABAergic synaptic transmission, we tested neurexin-1β, -1α, -2β, and -3β. All neurexins similarly impaired IPSCs (Figure 3A ; for neurexin-1α, see Figure 4B ). Transfection of C-terminally truncated neurexin-2βΔct lacking the cytoplasmic neurexin tail also decreased IPSCs, whereas deletion of the extracellular sequences of neurexin-1β abolished suppression of IPSCs, suggesting that postsynaptically expressed neurexin acts by an extracellular interaction (Figure 3B).Figure 4Neurexins Impair IPSCs Independent of NeuroliginsShow full captionHippocampal neurons transfected with the indicated combinations of expression vectors were analyzed as described for Figure 2.(A) Representative traces (left) and mean amplitudes (right) of IPSCs recorded from neurons transfected with control vector, or vectors expressing only neurexin-1β (Nrx-1β), only neuroligin-2 (NL2), neurexin-1β together with neuroligin-2 (Nrx-1β + NL2), or neurexin-1β with neuroligin-1 (Nrx-1β + NL1; control: n = 42/5; Nrx-1β: n = 55/5; Nrx-1β + NL-1: n = 26/4; Nrx-1β + NL-2: n = 25/4; NL-2: n = 9/1).(B) Representative traces (left) and mean amplitudes (right) of IPSCs recorded from neurons transfected with control vector, or vectors expressing only neurexin-1α (Nrx-1α), or together with neuroligin-2 (Nrx-1α + NL2), or only neuroligin-1 (Nrx-1α + NL1; control: n = 48/5; Nrx-1α: n = 38/5; Nrx-1α + NL-1: n = 19/3; Nrx-1α + NL-2: n = 16/3).(C and D) Representative traces (left) and mean amplitudes (right) of IPSCs recorded from neurons cultured from neuroligin-2 KO (C) or neuroligin-3 KO mice (D), and transfected with control vector or neurexin-2β (Nrx-2β; C, control: n = 20/3; Nrx-"

Here, however, we show that individuals with autism exhibited not only normal fMRI responses in mirror system areas during observation and execution of hand movements but also exhibited typical movement-selective adaptation (repetition suppression) when observing or executing the same movement repeatedly. Movement selectivity is a defining characteristic of neurons involved in movement perception, including mirror neurons, and, as such, these findings argue against a mirror system dysfunction in autism."
https://openalex.org/W2163573284,"Constant harvest policies for fish and wildlife populations can lead to population collapse in the face of stochastic variation in population growth rates. Here, we show that weak compensatory response by resource users or managers to changing levels of resource abundance can readily induce harvest cycles that accentuate the risk of catastrophic population collapse. Dynamic system models incorporating this mix of feedback predict that cycles or quasi-cycles with decadal periodicity should commonly occur in harvested wildlife populations, with effort and quotas lagging far behind resources, whereas harvests should exhibit lags of intermediate length. Empirical data gathered from three hunted populations of white-tailed deer and moose were consistent with these predictions of both underlying behavioral causes and dynamical consequences."

This process is controlled on the cellular efflux level catalyzed by members of the PIN (pin-formed) and ABCB (ATP-binding cassette protein subfamily B)/P-glycoprotein family that can function independently and coordinately. In this study, we have identified by means of chemical genomics a novel auxin transport inhibitor (ATI), BUM (2-[4-(diethylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoyl]benzoic acid), that efficiently blocks auxin-regulated plant physiology and development. In many respects, BUM resembles the functionality of the diagnostic ATI, 1-N-naphtylphtalamic acid (NPA), but it has an IC50 value that is roughly a factor 30 lower. Physiological analysis and binding assays identified ABCBs, primarily ABCB1, as key targets of BUM and NPA, whereas PIN proteins are apparently not directly affected. BUM is complementary to NPA by having distinct ABCB target spectra and impacts on basipetal polar auxin transport in the shoot and root. In comparison with the recently identified ATI, gravacin, it lacks interference with ABCB membrane trafficking. Individual modes or targets of action compared with NPA are reflected by apically shifted root influx maxima that might be the result of altered BUM binding preferences or affinities to the ABCB nucleotide binding folds. This qualifies BUM as a valuable tool for auxin research, allowing differentiation between ABCB- and PIN-mediated efflux systems. Besides its obvious application as a powerful weed herbicide, BUM is a bona fide human ABCB inhibitor with the potential to restrict multidrug resistance during chemotherapy.

Many of its functionalities are controlled by a unique, plant-specific process, the cell-to-cell or polar auxin transport (PAT) (3.Vieten A. Sauer M. Brewer P.B. Friml J.

ABCB- and PIN-mediated auxin efflux can function independently and play identical cellular but separate developmental roles (10.Mravec J. Kubes M. Bielach A. Gaykova V. Petrásek J. Skůpa P. Chand S. Benková E. Zazímalová E. Friml J. Development. 2008; 135: 3345-3354Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, ABCBs and PINs are also able to interactively and coordinately transport auxin (9.Blakeslee J.J. Bandyopadhyay A. Lee O.R. Mravec J. Titapiwatanakun B. Sauer M. Makam S.N. Cheng Y. Bouchard R. Adamec J. Geisler M. Nagashima A. Sakai T. Martinoia E. Friml J. Peer W.A. Murphy A.S. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 131-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The current picture that emerges is that in interacting cells, multilaterally expressed ABCBs minimize apoplastic reflux, whereas polar ABCB-PIN interactions provide specific vectorial auxin stream (10.Mravec J. Kubes M. Bielach A. Gaykova V. Petrásek J. Skůpa P. Chand S. Benková E. Zazímalová E. Friml J. Development. 2008; 135: 3345-3354Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, the individual roles of ABCB- and PIN-mediated auxin flows are far from being understood. The investigation of PAT streams was facilitated by using synthetic compounds that act as auxin transport inhibitors (ATIs), with the non-competitive IAA efflux inhibitor 1-N-naphtylphtalamic acid (NPA) being the most prominent. Until today, the identity, number, and affinity of putative NPA-binding proteins (NBPs) is still controversial (13.Cox D.N. Muday G.K.

However, the current consensus is that the auxin efflux complex consists of at least two proteins: a membrane-integral transporter and an NBP-regulatory subunit (13.Cox D.N. Muday G.K. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1941-1953PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Luschnig C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R831-R833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 15.Michalke W. Katekar G.F.

Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that PIN proteins do not themselves act as NBPs (19.Lomax T.L. Muday G.K. Rubery P.H. Davies P.J. Plant Hormones: Physiology, Biochemistry, and Molecular Biology. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 509-530Google Scholar), although NPA application results in a pin-formed inflorescence, mimicking PIN1 loss of function (20.Okada K. Ueda J. Komaki M.K. Bell C.J. Shimura Y. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 677-684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it was suggested that NPA blocks PAT by interfering with the cycling of auxin transporters, like PIN1 (21.Geldner N. Friml J. Stierhof Y.D. Jürgens G. Palme K. Nature. 2001; 413: 425-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). However, NPA itself does not directly affect PIN cycling, and concentrations necessary to perturb PIN cycling were much higher than was needed for efficiently blocking PAT (16.Petrásek J. Cerná A. Schwarzerová K. Elckner M. Morris D.A. Zazímalová E. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 254-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 21.Geldner N. Friml J. Stierhof Y.D. Jürgens G. Palme K. Nature. 2001; 413: 425-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). Independently, ABCB1 and ABCB19 have been identified as targets of NPA (5.Geisler M. Blakeslee J.J. Bouchard R. Lee O.R.

Surprisingly, NPA was additionally shown to bind to TWD1, and NPA binding disrupted TWD1-ABCB1 interaction (11.Bailly A. Sovero V. Vincenzetti V. Santelia D. Bartnik D. Koenig B.W. Mancuso S.

In planta, this leads to disruption of ABCB1 activity, suggesting that TWD1 and ABCB1 represent high and low affinity components of the NPA-sensitive efflux complex (11.Bailly A. Sovero V.

In the last few years, chemical genomic screens have allowed for the identification of several synthetic compounds and, in some cases, respective molecular targets that interfere with auxin signaling (26.Armstrong J.I.

Rojas-Pierce M. Carter C. Hicks G.R. Vasquez J. Raikhel N.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 4902-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In a follow-up screen, inhibition of gravitropism and protein trafficking was shown to employ independent mechanics (23.Rojas-Pierce M. Titapiwatanakun B. Sohn E.J. Fang F. Larive C.K. Blakeslee J. Cheng Y. Cutler S.R. Peer W.A. Murphy A.S. Raikhel N.V. Chem. Biol. 2007; 14: 1366-1376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Mutations in ABCB19 confer resistance to the effect of gravacin on hypocotyl gravitropism and result in reduced binding of gravacin to microsomal fractions, implicating ABCB19 as the major target of gravacin (23.Rojas-Pierce M. Titapiwatanakun B. Sohn E.J. Fang F. Larive C.K. Blakeslee J. Cheng Y. Cutler S.R. Peer W.A. Murphy A.S. Raikhel N.V. Chem.

Consequently, gravacin was found to be a strong inhibitor of ABCB19-mediated auxin transport in Arabidopsis and HeLa cells. In this study, we screened chemical libraries of small organic compounds for plant physiological and developmental regulators and identified a novel, highly potent ATI by means of chemical genomics. A direct comparison of compound 10824 (BUM) and NPA effects on auxin-controlled plant physiology, auxin transport, and drug binding reveals that BUM shares many features with NPA, like induction of pin-formed inflorescences and ABCB binding and blocking of transport. Unlike NPA and gravacin, BUM lacks growth activation at lower concentrations and does not interfere with membrane trafficking, respectively. BUM might therefore act as a powerful tool in dissecting ABCB- and PIN-mediated auxin streams in plant physiology. Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col) seeds were surface-sterilized, stratified at 4 °C for 3 days, and grown horizontally in 24-well plates (3 seeds/well; 0.5× B5 medium, 2% sucrose, 0.8% agar) at 22 °C under continuous light. Seven days after germination (dag), 2 μm organic compounds of a chemical library (containing 6,500 small organic chemicals at 50 μm in DMSO) from the Korea Chemical Bank was added manually. Plant phenotypes in respect to plant morphology, growth rate, leaf color, flowering time, and senescence were monitored every 2 days by visual examination in comparison with the solvent (DMSO) control on each plate up to 14 dag. In a secondary screen, plants were treated with various concentrations (up to 10 μm) of compounds from the Korea Chemical Bank that were structurally related to compound 10824 and thus contained the 2-(formyl)-benzoic acid core (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1). Phenotypes were screened for induction of pin-formed inflorescences (see Fig. 1C). For long term experiments, abcb1/pgp1–1 (At2g36910), abcb19/pgp19–1/mdr1-1 (At3g28860) (all ecotype Wassilewskija), and pin2/eir1-4 (At5g57090, ecotype Columbia) were grown on 0.5× B5 medium, 2% sucrose, 0.8% phytagar under continuous light for 18 dag in sterilized plastic boxes (SPL, Korea). For all other experiments, seedlings were grown if not indicated otherwise for 5 dag on vertical plates containing 0.5× Murashigge and Skoog medium, 1% sucrose, 1% phytagar in the dark or at 16 h of light/day. For growth quantification, seedlings were transferred on drug-containing plates (0–50 μm). After 5, 7, 9, and 11 dag, seedlings were aligned on 1% phytoagar medium, images were scanned, and root and hypocotyl lengths and lateral root numbers (7, 9, and 11 dag) were measured using Scion Image software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). For determination of IC50 values, root lengths of 7-dag seedlings grown on 0–80 μm NPA and 0–20 μm BUM were quantified, and IC50 values were calculated using sigmoidal dose-response fits. All experiments were performed at a minimum as triplicates with 20–30 seedlings per experiment. Homozygous F4 generations of A. thaliana wild-type, pin2/eir1-4 (32.Luschnig C. Gaxiola R.A. Grisafi P.

In some cases, seedlings were transferred for an additional 12 h onto new plates containing 0.5 μm BUM, 5 μm NPA, or the solvent DMSO. For histological signal localization, differential interference contrast and GFP images were merged electronically using Photoshop 10.0.1 (Adobe Systems). For measurements of basipetal root and hypocotyl (shoot) transport, seedlings were grown for 9 or 7 dag on vertical plates containing 0.5× Murashigge and Skoog medium, 1% sucrose, 1% phytagar at 16 h of light/day at 100 microeinsteins (root) or 10 microeinsteins (hypocotyl), respectively.

In short, four replicates of 10 μg each of protein were incubated with 10 nm [3H]NPA (80 Ci/mmol) and 10 nm [14C]BA (55 mCi/mmol) in the presence and absence of 10 μm NPA. For competition experiments, 10 μm BUM was added. Reported values are the means of specific binding ([3H]NPA bound in the absence of cold NPA (total) minus [3H]NPA bound in the presence of cold NPA (nonspecific)) from four independent experiments (independent transformants) with four replicates each.

The results are the average values from four independent experiments with four replica each of 10 readings collected every minute. Data were analyzed using Prism 4.0b (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). A. thaliana ABCB1 structure modeling was performed using PyMOL version 0.99 (DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA) and maximum entropy-based ligand binding was computed using MEDock (available on the World Wide Web). Drug docking was confirmed by using ZDOCK (available on the World Wide Web). Drug three-dimensional structures were energy-minimized using PRODRG2 (available on the World Wide Web), and solely polar hydrogens are displayed (usual atom color code). To identify growth and developmental regulators, we screened A. thaliana (ecotype Columbia; Col Wt) seedlings with a chemical library (Korean Chemical Bank, KRICT, Korea) composed of 6,500 small organic compounds. Seeds were germinated in 24-well plates, and at 7 dag, a 2 μm concentration of a different library compound was added to each well. Plant phenotypes with respect to plant morphology, growth rate, leaf color, flowering time, and senescence were monitored every 2 days by visual examination in comparison with solvent (DMSO) controls. Among the various chemical compounds that led to altered plant morphology, compound number 10824 (2-[4-(diethylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoyl]benzoic acid) produced a drastic phenotype, including dark green, epinastic leaves (Fig. 1A), suppression of primary and secondary roots (Fig. 1D), and abnormal, pin-formed inflorescences (Fig. 1C). We narrowed our focus to this compound 10824, subsequently named BUM, 5Named after the famous Korean football player, Cha Kun-Bum. BUM is available for academic institutions upon request from M.

https://openalex.org/W1978746677,"Actin dynamics determines podocyte morphology during development and in response to podocyte injury and might be necessary for maintaining normal podocyte morphology. Because podocyte intercellular junction receptor Nephrin plays a role in regulating actin dynamics, and given the described role of cofilin in actin filament polymerization and severing, we hypothesized that cofilin-1 activity is regulated by Nephrin and is necessary in normal podocyte actin dynamics. Nephrin activation induced cofilin dephosphorylation via intermediaries that include phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, SSH1, 14-3-3, and LIMK in a cell culture model. This Nephrin-induced cofilin activation required a direct interaction between Nephrin and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. In a similar fashion, cofilin-1 dephosphorylation was observed in a rat model of podocyte injury at a time when foot process spreading is initially observed. To investigate the necessity of cofilin-1 in the glomerulus, podocyte-specific Cfl1 null mice were generated. Cfl1 null podocytes developed normally. However, these mice developed persistent proteinuria by 3 months of age, although they did not exhibit foot process spreading until 8 months, when the rate of urinary protein excretion became more exaggerated. In a mouse model of podocyte injury, protamine sulfate perfusion of the Cfl1 mutant mouse induced a broadened and flattened foot process morphology that was distinct from that observed following perfusion of control kidneys, and mutant podocytes did not recover normal structure following additional perfusion with heparin sulfate. We conclude that cofilin-1 is necessary for maintenance of normal podocyte architecture and for actin structural changes that occur during induction and recovery from podocyte injury."

Although one possible explanation is through an effect on β-amyloid (Aβ) metabolism, its effect remains to be elucidated. Here, we explored the molecular mechanisms of how statins influence Aβ metabolism. Fluvastatin at clinical doses significantly reduced Aβ and amyloid precursor protein C-terminal fragment (APP-CTF) levels among APP metabolites in the brain of C57BL/6 mice. Chronic intracerebroventricular infusion of lysosomal inhibitors blocked these effects, indicating that up-regulation of the lysosomal degradation of endogenous APP-CTFs is involved in reduced Aβ production. Biochemical analysis suggested that this was mediated by enhanced trafficking of APP-CTFs from endosomes to lysosomes, associated with marked changes of Rab proteins, which regulate endosomal function. In primary neurons, fluvastatin enhanced the degradation of APP-CTFs through an isoprenoid-dependent mechanism. Because our previous study suggests additive effects of fluvastatin on Aβ metabolism, we examined Aβ clearance rates by using the brain efflux index method and found its increased rates at high Aβ levels from brain. As LRP1 in brain microvessels was increased, up-regulation of LRP1-mediated Aβ clearance at the blood-brain barrier might be involved. In cultured brain microvessel endothelial cells, fluvastatin increased LRP1 and the uptake of Aβ, which was blocked by LRP1 antagonists, through an isoprenoid-dependent mechanism. Overall, the present study demonstrated that fluvastatin reduced Aβ level by an isoprenoid-dependent mechanism.

https://openalex.org/W2014723616,"Asymmetric Ca2+ elevations across the axonal growth cone mediate its turning responses to attractive and repulsive guidance cues. Here we show that clathrin-mediated endocytosis acts downstream of Ca2+ signals as driving machinery for growth cone turning. In dorsal root ganglion neurons, the formation of clathrin-coated pits is facilitated asymmetrically across the growth cone by a directionally applied chemorepellent, semaphorin 3A, or by Ca2+ signals that mediate repulsive guidance. In contrast, coated pit formation remains symmetric in the presence of attractive Ca2+ signals. Inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis abolishes growth cone repulsion, but not attraction, induced by Ca2+ or extracellular physiological cues. Furthermore, asymmetric perturbation of the balance of endocytosis and exocytosis in the growth cone is sufficient to initiate its turning toward the side with less endocytosis or more exocytosis. With our previous finding that growth cone attraction involves asymmetric exocytosis, we propose that the balance between membrane addition and removal dictates bidirectional axon guidance."
https://openalex.org/W2044578370,"The fossil birds Archaeopteryx and Confuciusornis had feathered wings resembling those of living birds, but their flight capabilities remain uncertain. Analysis of the rachises of their primary feathers shows that the rachises were much thinner and weaker than those of modern birds, and thus the birds were not capable of flight. Only if the primary feather rachises were solid in cross-section (the strongest structural configuration), and not hollow as in living birds, would flight have been possible. Hence, if Archaeopteryx and Confuciusornis were flapping flyers, they must have had a feather structure that was fundamentally different from that of living birds. Alternatively, if they were only gliders, then the flapping wing stroke must have appeared after the divergence of Confuciusornis, likely within the enantiornithine or ornithurine radiations."

At cell adhesion sites, PKCα can impact the actin cytoskeleton through its influence on RhoGTPases, but the intermediate steps are not well known. One important regulator of RhoGTPase function is the multifunctional guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor RhoGDIα that sequesters several related RhoGTPases in an inactive form, but it may also target them through interactions with actin-associated proteins. Here, it is demonstrated that conventional PKC phosphorylates RhoGDIα on serine 34, resulting in a specific decrease in affinity for RhoA but not Rac1 or Cdc42. The mechanism of RhoGDIα phosphorylation is distinct, requiring the kinase and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, consistent with recent evidence that the inositide can activate, localize, and orient PKCα in membranes. Phosphospecific antibodies reveal endogenous phosphorylation in several cell types that is sensitive to adhesion events triggered, for example, by hepatocyte growth factor.

Biosci. 2009; 14: 2386-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Their activities can intersect with a number of signaling cascades and networks and are stimulated through several distinct receptor families. Broadly, there are three PKC subfamilies, conventional, novel, and atypical, and they operate at different subcellular sites with discrete functions (5.Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 6.Steinberg S.F. Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88: 1341-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). The PKCα conventional isoform may regulate a variety of functions, including redox reactions and cell survival, often upstream of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathways and NF-κB synthesis. In addition, this isoenzyme can be localized to sites of cell adhesion and regulate actin cytoskeletal function and migration (7.Jaken S. Leach K. Klauck T. J.

Goryachev A.B. Humphries M.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 1013-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), although a precise role for PKCα activity is unclear. The three mammalian RhoGDI isoforms are cytosolic proteins that sequester RhoGTPases in their GDP-bound form, effectively forming sinks that remove the G proteins from cycling through the guanine exchange factor and GTPase-activating protein-mediated activation/deactivation process (18.DerMardirossian C. Bokoch G.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 356-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 19.Dovas A. Couchman J.R. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In addition, RhoGDI can interact with cytoskeletal proteins such as ezrin-radixin-moesin that could target RhoGTPase activity at a subcellular level (20.Takahashi K. Sasaki T. Mammoto A. Takaishi K. Kameyama T. Tsukita S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23371-23375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is an oversimplification to ascribe only a sequestration function to GDI proteins. Because RhoGDIα, the most abundant isoform, binds several RhoGTPases, including GDP-RhoA, -Rac1, and -Cdc42 (18.DerMardirossian C. Bokoch G.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 356-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), regulatory mechanisms that control its function have come under some recent scrutiny (19.Dovas A. Couchman J.R. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 21.DerMardirossian C. Rocklin G. Seo J.Y. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4760-4768Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). RhoGDIα has two domains, an N-terminal domain of around 70 amino acids and an immunoglobulin-like C-terminal domain of ∼130 amino acids. NMR studies have shown that the N-terminal domain of the free protein is flexible in solution but with residues 9–20 and 36–58 forming transient helices (22.Golovanov A.P. Hawkins D. Barsukov I. Badii R. Bokoch G.M. Lian L.Y. Roberts G.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2253-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This part of the GDI molecule is stabilized by interactions with GTPases and is therefore a potential target for regulation through protein modification, such as phosphorylation. Here, we test the hypothesis that RhoGDIα phosphorylation by PKC may represent a major step in the pathway to RhoA, with onward activation of downstream effectors regulating cell adhesion, cytoskeletal, and other cellular events.DISCUSSIONRhoGDI proteins regulate the cycling and distribution of RhoGTPases (18.DerMardirossian C. Bokoch G.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 356-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 19.Dovas A. Couchman J.R. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Co-crystallization data of RhoGDIα bound to Cdc42 or Rac1 (38.Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 53.Grizot S. Fauré J. Fieschi F. Vignais P.V. Dagher M.C. Pebay-Peyroula E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10007-10013Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) reveal that residues 34–57 form an ordered helix-loop-helix motif characterized by hydrophobic interactions. Acquisition of negative charge at Ser-34 may disrupt the stability of the helix-loop-helix motif, interfering with the GTPase interaction and causing release of the GTPase from RhoGDI. In addition, there are extensive interactions between GDI N termini and switch I and II regions of the GTPases. GTPase binding establishes a bridge that brings regions of the N- and C-terminal domains of RhoGDI into proximity. A striking example is Arg-66 (Cdc42), the guanidinium group of which exhibits hydrogen bonding with Asp-185 as well as Pro-30 and Ala-31 of the GDI. Additionally, hydrophobic interactions between the aliphatic portion of the Arg-66 with Gln-32 and Ile-122 of the GDI were observed (38.Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Because many of the key residues of the RhoGDI N-terminal region lie immediately adjacent to Ser-34, these interactions may be disturbed by phosphorylation. However, Arg-66 of Cdc42 is highly conserved in Rac1 and RhoA, and indeed there is high sequence conservation through the switch II region, consistent with its role in GTP hydrolysis regulation, so the RhoA-specific effect of Ser-34 phosphorylation deserves further analysis.In vitro studies identifying the site and consequences of RhoGDIα phosphorylation are supported by in vivo studies with a Ser-34-phosphospecific antibody. Four widely differing cell types were investigated, and in each case endogenous phosphorylation of the Ser-34 residue could be detected. In MDCK cells, phorbol ester stimulates cytoskeletal reorganization and PKCα translocation to the membrane (43.Sciorra V.A. Daniel L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14226-14232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), although integrin-mediated adhesion is promoted by phorbol ester in K562 cells, also associated with actin cytoskeletal reorganization (39.Lub M. van Vliet S.J. Oomen S.P. Pieters R.A. Robinson M. Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In both cell types, RhoGDIα phosphorylation on Ser-34 rapidly increased in concert with these adhesion events. Additionally, and consistent with in vitro data, RhoGDIα phosphorylation was blocked by the Gö6976 inhibitor, which has highest activity against PKCα and PKCβ1 (41.Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G.

Both stimulants activate RhoA rather than Rac (45.Kodama A. Matozaki T. Fukuhara A. Kikyo M. Ichihashi M. Takai Y. Mol. Biol.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 273-279PubMed Google Scholar), although the molecular mechanism is unknown. The result is actin cytoskeletal reorganization and loss of cell-cell junctions. Moreover, two studies with mouse keratinocytes and KB cells showed that motility in response to these same agents was blocked both by C3 transferase and overexpression of wild-type RhoGDI (55.Takaishi K. Sasaki T. Kato M. Yamochi W. Kuroda S. Nakamura T. Takeichi M. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 273-279PubMed Google Scholar, 56.Nishiyama T. Sasaki T. Takaishi K. Kato M. Yaku H. Araki K. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2447-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). These studies therefore implicated RhoGDI, with which the current data are entirely consistent. A key result is that introduction of the S34D mutant of RhoGDIα into MDCK cells activated the motility responses of MDCK cells without a need for PKC activation. In contrast, such responses were not seen in wild-type or S34A RhoGDI-expressing cells. However, we cannot rule out additional roles for guanine exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins. Gentile et al. (57.Gentile A. D'Alessandro L. Lazzari L. Martinoglio B. Bertotti A. Mira A. Lanzetti L. Comoglio P.M. Medico E. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 5590-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) showed, for example, that HGF-promoted invasion is associated with down-regulated expression of the RacGAP, Arhgap12.Further experiments utilized the Raichu construct as a reporter for GTP-Rho levels (33.Yoshizaki H. Ohba Y. Kurokawa K. Itoh R.E. Nakamura T. Mochizuki N. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). This sensitive indicator combined with FRET microscopy enabled the impact of RhoGDIα phosphorylation to be assessed. Expression of the S34D form of RhoGDIα in fibroblasts yielded a FRET decline (i.e. GTP-RhoA levels increased). This provided in vivo evidence that RhoGDIα phosphorylation regulates RhoGTP levels. In contrast, no elevation in GTP-RhoA levels was seen by transfection of wild-type RhoGDIα or an S34A form. In these cases, FRET was increased, suggesting that a form of RhoGDIα that cannot be phosphorylated sequesters GDP-RhoA. Although wild-type RhoGDIα can theoretically be phosphorylated when overexpressed, increased protein levels alter the equilibrium in favor of decreased overall phosphorylation, consistent with Takaishi et al. (55.Takaishi K. Sasaki T. Kato M. Yamochi W. Kuroda S. Nakamura T. Takeichi M. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 273-279PubMed Google Scholar).Efficient Ser-34 phosphorylation of RhoGDIα by conventional PKC occurs in the presence of PtdIns(4,5)P2, not with the often used combination of phosphatidylserine, diacylglycerol, and calcium. This inositol phospholipid can mediate PKCα activation, and a lysine-rich-binding site in the C2 domain was identified (10.Corbalán-García S. García-García J. Rodríguez-Alfaro J.A. Gómez-Fernández J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4972-4980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We, and others, showed that syndecan-4-mediated activation of PKCα in the presence of PtdIns(4,5)P2 was calcium-independent (13.Oh E.S. Woods A. Lim S.T. Theibert A.W. Couchman J.R. J. Biol.

The C2 domain of PKCα has a higher affinity for PtdIns(4,5)P2 than phosphatidylserine, so the inositide may be a kinase-targeting site (15.Marín-Vicente C. Nicolás F.E. Gómez-Fernández J.C. Corbalán-García S. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 1038-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 58.Son H. Lim Y. Kim J. Park H. Choi S. Han I. Kim W.S. Park S. Bae Y. Oh E.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 454: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Recent work shows that PKCα C2 domain may adopt a different membrane orientation when bound to PtdIns(4,5)P2 compared with phosphatidylserine (59.Landgraf K.E. Malmberg N.J. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 8301-8316Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In turn, this may modulate kinase activity, and our study provides some evidence that substrate specificity might be engendered this way. Therefore, we predict PKCα activation resulting from phospholipase C activity, i.e. the generation of diacylglycerol, would not trigger RhoGDI phosphorylation and RhoA activation. By the same token, because inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum are consequences of phospholipase C activity, the phosphorylation of RhoGDIα is presumed to be independent of calcium fluxes. Consistent with this, we find that the PtdIns(4,5)P2-driven PKCα activation is indeed Ca2+-independent. Moreover, RhoGDIα phosphorylation persisted in the presence of a characterized phospholipase C inhibitor, U73122 (60.Horowitz L.F. Hirdes W. Suh B.C. Hilgemann D.W. Mackie K. Hille B. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 243-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar).Our data differ from two reports suggesting that in endothelial cells Ser-96 of RhoGDIα was subject to phosphorylation by PKCα, with a downstream increase in GTP-RhoA levels (61.Knezevic N. Roy A. Timblin B. Konstantoulaki M. Sharma T. Malik A.B. Mehta D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 6323-6333Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) or release of RhoG (62.Elfenbein A. Rhodes J.M. Meller J. Schwartz M.A. Matsuda M. Simons M. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), a close relative of Rac1 (63.van Buul J.D. Allingham M.J. Samson T. Meller J. Boulter E. García-Mata R. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 1279-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Although the methods and cells are different, we could not demonstrate phosphorylation of Ser-96 in vitro. A truncated form of RhoGDIα(67–204), missing the N-terminal region but containing Ser-96, was not phosphorylated by PKCα. Knezevic et al. (61.Knezevic N. Roy A. Timblin B. Konstantoulaki M. Sharma T. Malik A.B. Mehta D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 6323-6333Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) utilized N-terminally green fluorescent protein-tagged RhoGDIα that may have affected the ability of PKCα to phosphorylate Ser-34. In contrast to that study, we prepared a phosphospecific antibody that revealed both the widespread occurrence of Ser-34 phosphorylation and regulation in response to PKC activation. Serine 96 lies in a consensus PKC phosphorylation site that is present in the immunoglobulin domain of mammalian RhoGDIα but not conserved across other vertebrates or isoforms. Based on structural data, the Ser-96 residue does not apparently form part of a contact site with GTPase or the hydrophobic pocket that captures the prenyl moiety. In contrast, Ser-34 is conserved across all vertebrate RhoGDIα isoforms and is present in all vertebrate β and γ isoforms for which there are data. Although Ser-34 is a major PKC phosphorylation site, in vitro experiments suggested some residual phosphorylation after GDI mutation of Ser-34 to alanine or aspartate. The amounts varied but could represent another phosphorylation site, presumably also in the N-terminal portion of RhoGDIα.Because RhoGDIα is an abundant cytoplasmic protein, its role is potentially significant. Our work complements that of DerMardirossian et al. (64.DerMardirossian C. Schnelzer A. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 117-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) where p21-activated kinase phosphorylation of RhoGDIα on Ser-101 and Ser-174 causes specific release of Rac1. In this case, the key sites are C-terminal and are close to each other and to the prenyl-binding cleft of the GDI (38.Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). It is proposed that the negative charge may destabilize this hydrophobic interaction and cause release of the Rac1. This must be a very specific effect because Rho and Cdc42 are also prenylated yet are unaffected. A second model of RhoGDI regulation involves Tyr-156 phosphorylation by Src, but only when not complexed to a GTPase (21.DerMardirossian C. Rocklin G. Seo J.Y. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4760-4768Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This not only reduced affinity of the GDI for RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, but it also triggered a membrane or cortical redistribution of the protein. The current data show that Ser-34 phosphorylation can occur in free or GTPase-bound RhoGDIα. Phosphorylation on Tyr-156 was only noted in cells overexpressing a constitutively active form of Src (21.DerMardirossian C. Rocklin G. Seo J.Y. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4760-4768Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), perhaps an indicator of its transient nature. Here, Ser-34 phosphorylation was observed in several different untransfected cell types, with levels changing in response to adhesion events.Focal adhesion and microfilament bundle assembly is promoted by GTP-RhoA (65.Ridley A.J. Hall A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2600-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 66.Machesky L.M. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 913-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), with activation of the Rho kinases, with ROCK I playing a major role in primary fibroblasts (28.Yoneda A. Multhaupt H.A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Rho kinases phosphorylate myosin light chain and the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase, leading to myosin II-driven contraction. The transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan, syndecan-4, supports focal adhesion assembly through the binding and persistent activation of PKCα, in the presence of PtdIns(4,5)P2, an event upstream of GTP-RhoA (8.Dovas A. Yoneda A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 2837-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 11.Keum E. Kim Y. Kim J. Kwon S. Lim Y. Han I. Oh E.S. Biochem.

Chem. 2003; 278: 13795-13802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In MDCK cells, Rho kinase activity is required both for focal adhesion/stress fiber formation but also lamellipodial ruffle stabilization, possibly through phosphorylation of adducin (29.Fukata Y. Kimura K. Oshiro N. Saya H. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 67.Royal I. Lamarche-Vane N. Lamorte L. Kaibuchi K. Park M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1709-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). However, the upstream events that lead to the accumulation and targeting of GTP-RhoA were not known. Here, evidence suggests that a major downstream target of PKCα/PtdIns(4,5)P2 is RhoGDIα with phosphorylation on Ser-34. The result of phosphorylation is release or decreased capture of the GTPase, leading to nucleotide exchange and interaction with downstream effectors.

Biosci. 2009; 14: 2386-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Their activities can intersect with a number of signaling cascades and networks and are stimulated through several distinct receptor families. Broadly, there are three PKC subfamilies, conventional, novel, and atypical, and they operate at different subcellular sites with discrete functions (5.Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 6.Steinberg S.F. Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88: 1341-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). The PKCα conventional isoform may regulate a variety of functions, including redox reactions and cell survival, often upstream of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathways and NF-κB synthesis. In addition, this isoenzyme can be localized to sites of cell adhesion and regulate actin cytoskeletal function and migration (7.Jaken S. Leach K. Klauck T. J.

Besides the canonical pathway of PKC activation through phospholipase C-mediated generation of diacylglycerol and inositol trisphosphate, a second method of PKCα activation is known involving uncleaved phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (10.Corbalán-García S.

The three mammalian RhoGDI isoforms are cytosolic proteins that sequester RhoGTPases in their GDP-bound form, effectively forming sinks that remove the G proteins from cycling through the guanine exchange factor and GTPase-activating protein-mediated activation/deactivation process (18.DerMardirossian C.

https://openalex.org/W2030359753,"Eukaryotes employ complex immune mechanisms for protection against microbial pathogens. Here, we identified SCD1 (Stomatal Cytokinesis-Defective 1), previously implicated in growth and development through its role in cytokinesis and polarized cell expansion (Falbel, T. G., Koch, L.

We show that conditional scd1-1 plants containing a point mutation in a conserved DENN residue affected a subset of signaling responses to some bacterial pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Consistent with increased transcript accumulation of Pathogen-related (PR) genes, scd1-1 plants were more resistant to Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato (Pst) DC3000 infection implicating SCD1 as a negative regulator of basal resistance against bacteria. scd1-1 plants were different from known mutants exhibiting constitutive expressor of PR (cpr)-like phenotypes, in that growth impairment of scd1-1 plants was genetically independent of constitutive immune response activation. For scd1-1, shift to elevated temperature or introduction of a mutant allele in Salicylic acid Induction-Deficient 2 (SID2) suppressed constitutive defense response activation. sid2-2 also repressed the resistance phenotype of scd1-1. Temperature shift and sid2-2, however, did not rescue conditional growth and sterility defects of scd1-1.

Our previous study on the scd1-1 mutant demonstrates that the DENN domain is critical for SCD1 function. In scd1-1 plants, a point mutation in a serine residue (S131F) that is highly conserved among eukaryotic DENN domains results in conditional defects in growth and development (5.Falbel T.G. Koch L.M. Nadeau J.A. Segui-Simarro J.M. Sack F.D. Bednarek S.Y. Development. 2003; 130: 4011-4024Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These defects can be alleviated by shifting scd1-1 plants from non-permissive (22 °C) to permissive temperature (16–18 °C) (5.Falbel T.G. Koch L.M. Nadeau J.A. Segui-Simarro J.M. Sack F.D.

The molecular mechanism(s) leading to any defects in these scd1 mutant lines, however, are currently unknown. Here, we show that in conditional scd1-1 plants, the DENN mutation affected SCD1 protein accumulation in a temperature-dependent manner. Making use of the less severe growth defective phenotype compared with scd1-2-null mutant plants and the temperature-sensitive nature of scd1-1 DENN (S131F), we provide evidence that in addition to its role in plant growth and development, SCD1 functioned in immune responses against bacteria. scd1-1 also showed constitutive activation of defense responses, but scd1-1 differed from previously described mutants displaying cpr-like phenotypes.

Excised leaves of 4–5-week-old plants were vacuum infiltrated with 1 mg/ml DAB (3,3-diaminobenzidine; Sigma) and cleared by boiling in lactic acid/glycerol/EtOH (1:1:3) for 5–10 min. Bioluminescent LuxCDABE-tagged Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (20.Fan J. Crooks C. Lamb C. Plant J. 2008; 53: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) were grown for 3 days on King's B Medium plates with appropriate antibiotics at 28–30 °C and resuspended in water to an OD of 0.005. Leaves of 4–5-week-old plants were syringe infiltrated with bacterial inoculums of 5 × 105 cfu/ml and left to dry. In bacterial plate assays, leaf discs were harvested at 0 and 3 dpi and ground in 10 mm MgCl2. The cfu/cm2 was determined by plating serial dilutions of individual leaf extracts. To monitor bacterial growth in planta, luciferase signal from bioluminescent Pst DC3000 was detected in whole plants using a Photek HRPCS4 photon detection camera (21.Bartels S. Anderson J.C.

For elicited leaf samples, indicated PAMP concentrations were leaf syringe-infiltrated for indicated times. Seedlings (9-day-old) or leaf disks (from 4–5-week-old plants) were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from frozen tissues and subjected to qRT-PCR reaction as described (22.Libault M. Wan J. Czechowski T. Udvardi M. Stacey G. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2007; 20: 900-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) with primers listed in Table 1. The expression of At2G28390 (SAND family protein gene) was used to normalize all qRT-PCR results because of its highly stable expression during defense responses (22.Libault M. Wan J. Czechowski T. Udvardi M. Stacey G. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2007; 20: 900-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was performed using unpaired two sample t tests. In plants, the bacterial PAMP flagellin or its active peptide derivative flg22 (PF22) is perceived by Flagellin-Sensitive 2 (FLS2) (1.Boller T. Felix G. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2009; 60: 379-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (2149) Google Scholar, 2.Nicaise V. Roux M. Zipfel C. Plant Physiol. 2009; 150: 1638-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Previously, we employed a large-scale co-immunoprecipitation strategy using an αFLS2 antibody to discover novel PF22-dependent signaling component(s) required for innate immunity against bacteria (13.Heese A. Hann D.R. Gimenez-Ibanez S. Jones A.M. He K. Li J. Schroeder J.I. Peck S.C. Rathjen J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 12217-12222Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Here, we used the same approach to identify a protein with an apparent molecular mass of about 140 kDa that immunoprecipitated with the αFLS2 antibody in a PF22-independent manner from solubilized microsomal membranes of La-er cell culture (supplemental Fig. S1). Based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis, this protein was identified as SCD1 (supplemental Table S1), a DENN-domain containing protein required for growth and development (5.Falbel T.G. Koch L.M. Nadeau J.A. Segui-Simarro J.M. Sack F.D. Bednarek S.Y. Development. 2003; 130: 4011-4024Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Probing αFLS2 immunoprecipitates with a purified polyclonal antibody made against the SCD1 DENN domain provided additional support that the identified 140 kDa protein was SCD1 (supplemental Fig. S2). Recent studies identified proteins with dual roles in development and innate immunity (1.Boller T. Felix G. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2009; 60: 379-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (2149) Google Scholar, 13.Heese A. Hann D.R. Gimenez-Ibanez S. Jones A.M. He K. Li J. Schroeder J.I. Peck S.C. Rathjen J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Boller T. Nature. 2007; 448: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar). We therefore were interested in whether in addition to growth and development, SCD1 has role(s) in innate immunity, a function currently not ascribed to any eukaryotic DENN protein. Prior to testing SCD1 function in innate immunity, we investigated whether we could exploit the less severe growth defects and the temperature-sensitive nature of scd1-1 relative to scd1-2 (Fig. 1, A and B) (5.Falbel T.G. Koch L.M. Nadeau J.A. Segui-Simarro J.M. Sack F.D. Bednarek S.Y. Development. 2003; 130: 4011-4024Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) for subsequent assays. To gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) leading to the differences in phenotypic severity between these scd1 mutants (5.Falbel T.G. Koch L.M. Nadeau J.A. Segui-Simarro J.M. Sack F.D. Bednarek S.Y. Development. 2003; 130: 4011-4024Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we compared SCD1 mRNA and protein levels between scd1-1 and scd1-2 grown at 22 °C. In scd1-2, no SCD1 mRNA (Fig. 1C) or SCD1 protein (Fig. 1D; see also supplemental Fig. S3) was detected using qRT-PCR or immunoblot analysis with the αSCD1 antibodies, respectively. In contrast, phenotypic defects in scd1-1 were not due to changes in SCD1 mRNA accumulation (Fig. 1C) (5.Falbel T.G. Koch L.M. Nadeau J.A. Segui-Simarro J.M. Sack F.D. Bednarek S.Y. Development. 2003; 130: 4011-4024Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), but correlated with changes in SCD1 protein levels compared with wild type (WT). Long exposure of immunoblots showed reduced but detectable levels of SCD1 protein in scd1-1 (Fig. 1D; see also supplemental Fig. S3). Thus, DENN integrity may be important for proper SCD1 stability or folding as recently suggested for RME-4, a DENN protein from Caenorhabditis elegans (11.Sato M. Sato K. Liou W. Pant S. Harada A. Grant B.D. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1183-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). scd1-1 seedlings grown at non-permissive (22 °C) and transferred for 4 days to permissive (17 °C) temperature consistently accumulated more SCD1 protein relative to scd1-1 grown continuously at 22 °C, but did not reach levels found in WT (Fig. 1E). Increased SCD1 protein levels correlated with alleviation of phenotypic defects upon temperature shift to 17 °C (Fig. 1A) (5.Falbel T.G. Koch L.M. Nadeau J.A. Segui-Simarro J.M. Sack F.D. Bednarek S.Y. Development. 2003; 130: 4011-4024Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We conclude that scd1-1 is a conditional temperature-sensitive, partial loss-of-function mutation whereas scd1-2 is a complete loss-of-function mutation. To investigate SCD1 function in innate immunity, we focused on scd1-1. In contrast to scd1-2 (5.Falbel T.G. Koch L.M. Nadeau J.A. Segui-Simarro J.M. Sack F.D. Bednarek S.Y. Development. 2003; 130: 4011-4024Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), scd1-1 grew sufficiently at 22 °C for experimental manipulation (Fig. 1B). First, we tested whether SCD1 has a genetic role in PF22-dependent signaling responses. As determined by luminol-based assays (17.Gómez-Gómez L. Felix G. Boller T. Plant J. 1999; 18: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), PF22-elicited rapid and transient accumulation of apoplastic (extracellular) reactive oxygen species (ROS) in small leaf pieces of 4–5-week-old WT plants (Fig. 2, A and B). At 22 °C, PF22-elicited ROS production was significantly reduced in scd1-1 leaves compared with WT at each time point (Fig. 2, A and B; p ≤ 0.0013), indicating a role for SCD1 in PF22-induced oxidative burst. In control experiments, no ROS were produced in response to DMSO or inactive flg22 (AF22) in scd1-1 or WT (Fig. 2, A and B). scd1-1 plants also displayed significantly impaired ROS production in response to elf26 (Fig. 2B; p < 0.005), a bacterial PAMP structurally unrelated to PF22 and perceived by an independent PAMP receptor, EFR (25.Zipfel C. Kunze G. Chinchilla D. Caniard A. Jones J.D. Boller T. Felix G. Cell. 2006; 125: 749-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). Thus, SCD1 function was not restricted to PF22-elicited ROS production. To confirm that impaired PF22-induced ROS production was caused by the DENN mutation in SCD1, scd1-1 plants were grown at 22 °C continuously or shifted from 22 to 17 °C for 9 days. In contrast to ROS defects in scd1-1 grown at 22 °C, no significant difference was observed in PF22-induced ROS production between scd1-1 and WT plants shifted to 17 °C (Fig. 2C). Thus in addition to alleviating growth and developmental defects (5.Falbel T.G. Koch L.M. Nadeau J.A. Segui-Simarro J.M. Sack F.D. Bednarek S.Y. Development. 2003; 130: 4011-4024Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), a shift from 22 to 17 °C restored a molecular phenotype, namely PF22-induced ROS production in scd1-1. Reversal of the ROS defect in scd1-1 correlated with increased SCD1 protein levels (Fig. 2E), but these did not reach WT levels. No discernible change in SCD1 protein accumulation was observed in WT plants when grown at 22 °C and shifted to 17 °C. In addition, FLS2 protein levels were similar in scd1-1 and WT plants independent of growth conditions (Fig. 2E; see also supplemental Fig. S3). Transformation of scd1-1 with the SCD1 gene under the control of its own promoter (scd1-1/pSCD1:SCD1; scd1-1/comp) complemented the phenotypic defects of scd1-1 plants (Fig. 1B) (5.Falbel T.G. Koch L.M. Nadeau J.A. Segui-Simarro J.M. Sack F.D. Bednarek S.Y. Development. 2003; 130: 4011-4024Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) at 22 °C and restored SCD1 protein accumulation to WT levels (Fig. 2F). Importantly, expression of WT SCD1 protein restored the ROS defect in scd1-1 plants (scd1-1/pSCD1:SCD1; s1-1/comp; Fig. 2D). Taken together, we showed by two independent means (temperature shift and complementation assays) that reduced PF22-ROS production was due to the DENN point mutation in SCD1. Next we investigated whether SCD1 was required for other early or late PF22-responses when grown at the non-permissive temperature (22 °C). Previously, seedling growth inhibition assays were successful in identifying components of PAMP signaling pathways by assessing seedling sensitivity to bacterial PAMPs (17.Gómez-Gómez L. Felix G. Boller T. Plant J. 1999; 18: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 25.Zipfel C. Kunze G. Chinchilla D. Caniard A. Jones J.D. Boller T. Felix G. Cell. 2006; 125: 749-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). Here, 4-day-old seedlings were subsequently grown in the presence of active (PF22, elf26) or inactive (AF22) PAMPs for additional 7 days. Based on weight measurements of individual seedlings, WT exhibited dose-dependent growth reduction in the presence of PF22 (expressed in percentage relative to seedlings grown in AF22) (Fig. 3A). At the same PF22 concentrations, scd1-1 seedling growth was significantly less inhibited indicating a reduced sensitivity of scd1-1 to PF22 (Fig. 3A; p < 0.0001). Reduced sensitivity was not due to a limitation of scd1-1 seedlings to be further stunted because exposure to 1 μm elf26 (E26), a more potent PAMP in this assay compared with PF22, resulted in increased growth inhibition of scd1-1 seedlings (Fig. 3A). Taken together, these results implicate a role of SCD1 in seedling growth inhibition to bacterial PAMPs. To further examine the requirement for SCD1 in early and late PAMP responses, we determined PF22-induced transcriptional activation of a subset of early marker genes (26.Zipfel C. Robatzek S. Navarro L. Oakeley E.J. Jones J.D. Felix G. Boller T. Nature. 2004; 428: 764-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar) in leaves of 4–5 week old plants after syringe-inoculation with PF22 or a mock control (DMSO) for 30 min. As determined by qRT-PCR, transcript accumulation of tested WRKY transcription factors, previously shown to be up-regulated in response to flg22 (26.Zipfel C. Robatzek S. Navarro L. Oakeley E.J. Jones J.D. Felix G. Boller T. Nature. 2004; 428: 764-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar), were increased after PF22 elicitation compared with mock-treated tissue. WT and scd1-1 plants showed no statistically significant differences in induction of these marker transcripts (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained from PF22-treated 9-day-old seedlings. We also investigated transcript accumulation of pathogen-related (PR) PR1, PR2, and PR5 genes, known late marker genes for PF22 signaling and defense responses (17.Gómez-Gómez L. Felix G. Boller T. Plant J. 1999; 18: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 27.van Loon L.C. Rep M. Pieterse C.M. Annu. Rev. Phytopathology. 2006; 44: 135-162Crossref Scopus (2291) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PF22 elicitation for 24 h led to a significant increase in transcript accumulation of PR1, PR2, and PR5 genes in scd1-1 compared with WT leaves (Fig. 3C; p < 0.001). These results implicated SCD1 as a negative regulator of PF22-induced transcript accumulation of these marker PR genes. Next, we determined whether PF22-dependent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) MPK3, MPK6, and MPK4, generally used to monitor early PAMP responses (2.Nicaise V. Roux M. Zipfel C. Plant Physiol. 2009; 150: 1638-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), was affected in scd1-1. After elicitation with increasing PF22 concentrations for 10 min, we did not observe any differences in the activation of these MAPKs when comparing scd1-1 and WT seedlings (Fig. 3D) using an antibody (αP-MAPKact) that detects activated, phosphorylated MAPKs (13"
https://openalex.org/W2088992068,"The brainstem locomotor system is believed to be organized serially from the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) to reticulospinal neurons, which in turn project to locomotor neurons in the spinal cord. We identified brainstem muscarinoceptive neurons in lampreys (Petromyzon marinus) that received parallel inputs from the MLR and projected back to reticulospinal cells to amplify and extend the duration of locomotor output. These cells responded to muscarine with extended periods of excitation, received direct muscarinic excitation from the MLR and projected glutamatergic excitation to reticulospinal neurons. Targeted blockade of muscarine receptors over these neurons profoundly reduced MLR-induced excitation of reticulospinal neurons and markedly slowed MLR-evoked locomotion. The presence of these neurons forces us to rethink the organization of supraspinal locomotor control, to include a sustained feedforward loop that boosts locomotor output."
https://openalex.org/W2058838930,"Dendritic democracy and independence have been characterized for near-instantaneous processing of synaptic inputs. However, a wide class of neuronal computations requires input integration on long timescales. As a paradigmatic example, entorhinal grid fields have been thought to be generated by the democratic summation of independent dendritic oscillations performing direction-selective path integration. We analyzed how multiple dendritic oscillators embedded in the same neuron integrate inputs separately and determine somatic membrane voltage jointly. We found that the interaction of dendritic oscillations leads to phase locking, which sets an upper limit on the timescale for independent input integration. Factors that increase this timescale also decrease the influence that the dendritic oscillations exert on somatic voltage. In entorhinal stellate cells, interdendritic coupling dominates and causes these cells to act as single oscillators. Our results suggest a fundamental trade-off between local and global processing in dendritic trees integrating ongoing signals."
https://openalex.org/W2172269969,"Circadian systems are entrained and phase shifted by light. In Drosophila, the model of light-mediated phase shifting begins with photon capture by CRYPTOCHROME (CRY) followed by rapid TIMELESS (TIM) degradation. In this study, we focused on phase delays and assayed TIM degradation within individual brain clock neurons in response to light pulses in the early night. Surprisingly, there was no detectable change in TIM staining intensity within the eight pacemaker s-LNvs. This indicates that TIM degradation within s-LNvs is not necessary for phase delays, and similar assays in other genotypes indicate that it is also not sufficient. In contrast, more dorsal circadian neurons appear light-sensitive in the early night. Because CRY is still necessary within the s-LNvs for phase shifting, the results challenge the canonical cell-autonomous molecular model and raise the question of how the pacemaker neuron transcription-translation clock is reset by light in the early night."

Employing this information, we have constructed 17 mutants, which alter the FtsZ functional cycle at different stages, to modify FtsZ flexibility. The mutant phenotypes ranged from benign to total inactivation and included increased GTPase, reduced assembly, and stabilized assembly. Six mutations clustering at the long cleft between the C-terminal β-sheet and core helix H7 deviated FtsZ assembly into curved filaments with inhibited GTPase, which still polymerize cooperatively. These mutations may perturb the predicted closure of the C-terminal domain onto H7 required for switching between curved and straight association modes and for GTPase activation.

https://openalex.org/W2103754831,"The multidrug major facilitator superfamily transporter LmrP from Lactococcus lactis mediates protonmotive-force dependent efflux of amphiphilic ligands from the cell. We compared the role of membrane-embedded carboxylates in transport and binding of divalent cationic propidium and monovalent cationic ethidium. D235N, E327Q, and D142N replacements each resulted in loss of electrogenicity in the propidium efflux reaction, pointing to electrogenic 3H(+)/propidium(2+) antiport. During ethidium efflux, single D142N and D235N replacements resulted in apparent loss of electrogenicity, whereas the E327Q substitution did not affect the energetics, consistent with electrogenic 2H(+)/ethidium(+) antiport. Different roles of carboxylates were also observed in fluorescence anisotropy-based ligand-binding assays. Whereas D235 and E327 were both involved in propidium binding, the loss of one of these carboxylates could be compensated for by the other in ethidium binding. The D142N replacement did not affect the binding of either ligand. These data point to the presence of a dedicated proton binding site containing D142, and a flexible proton/ligand binding site containing D235 and E327, the contributions to proton and ligand binding of which depend on the chemical structure of the bound ligand. Our findings provide the first evidence that multidrug transport by secondary-active transporters can be associated with variable ion coupling."

In addition, LC7 functions in non-dynein transcriptional activation of the transforming growth factor-β complex. Crystal structures of Drosophila melanogaster LC7 in the apo form and in complex with a segment of the disordered N-terminal domain of dynein intermediate chain (IC) provide the first definitive identification of the IC sequence recognized by LC7. The site, confirmed by isothermal titration calorimetry studies, overlaps the IC sequence considered in the literature to be an IC self-association domain. The IC peptide binds as two amphipathic helices that lie along an extensive hydrophobic cleft on LC7 and ends with a polar side-chain interaction network that includes conserved residues from both proteins. The LC7 recognition sequence on IC and its interface with LC7 are well conserved and are, thus, likely representative of all IC·LC7 structures. Interestingly, the position of bound IC in the IC·LC7 complex mimics a helix that is integrated into the primary structure in distantly related LC7 homologs. The IC·LC7 structure further shows that the naturally occurring roblZ deletion mutation contains the majority of the IC binding site and suggests that promotion of IC binding by phosphorylation of LC7 is an indirect effect.

Cytoplasmic dyneins are large multisubunit protein complexes that are responsible for ATP-driven transport of diverse cargo along microtubules. They play fundamental roles within the cell including mitotic spindle assembly and orientation (1.Echeverri C.J. Paschal B.M. Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J.

The N- and C-terminal domains of IC are structurally and functionally independent. The primarily disordered N-terminal domain (N-IC) is central to dynein assembly, regulation, and cargo binding as it contains a self-association domain and the binding sites for the three light chains, the p150Glued subunit of dynactin, and several putative cargoes (8.Ye G.J.

LC7, also called roadblock or km23, is a ubiquitous component of cytoplasmic dyneins. The roadblock name originates from knock-out mutants in Drosophila melanogaster that result in posterior sluggish motility leading to complete paralysis. LC7-null mutants in D. melanogaster have mitotic defects (18.Bowman A.B. Patel-King R.S. Benashski S.E. McCaffery J.M. Goldstein L.S. King S.M. J.

LC7 belongs to an ancient protein superfamily that is widely represented in archaea and bacteria and is implicated in regulation of nucleoside triphosphatase activity (25.Koonin E.V. Aravind L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R774-R776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Superfamily members share a common structural fold of five β-strands and three α-helices, except the C-terminal α-helix is missing in LC7. LC7 apparently has multiple non-dynein interaction partners including the Rab6 family of GTPase regulators (26.Wanschers B. van de Vorstenbosch R. Wijers M. Wieringa B. King S.M. Fransen J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2008; 65: 183-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the human reduced folate carrier (27.Ashokkumar B. Nabokina S.M. Ma T.Y. Said H.M. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2009; 297: G480-G487Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and the transforming growth factor-β receptor complex (28.Tang Q. Staub C.M. Gao G. Jin Q. Wang Z.

Physiol. 2009; 221: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), but in no case is the molecular-level interaction with a binding partner characterized. Consistent with a role for LC7 in multiple cellular pathways, mutations of LC7 (30.Ding W. Tang Q. Espina V. Liotta L.A. Mauger D.T. Mulder K.M. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6526-6533Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) or changes in LC7 isoform expression levels (31.Jiang J. Yu L. Huang X. Chen X. Li D. Zhang Y. Tang L. Zhao S. Gene. 2001; 281: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) have been observed in ovarian and hepatic cancers. Phosphorylation is one mechanism that appears to regulate the multiple roles of LC7. LC7 is serine-phosphorylated after transforming growth factor-β receptor activation and binds IC in response to this activation. Two phosphorylation site mutants disrupt the interaction with IC (30.Ding W. Tang Q. Espina V. Liotta L.A. Mauger D.T. Mulder K.M. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6526-6533Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), leading to the conclusion that phosphorylation of LC7 is necessary for IC binding. However, at present there is no clear molecular-level picture of processes associated with LC7 phosphorylation/dephosphorylation or of its involvement in IC binding. As part of our ongoing effort to elucidate structure-function relationships of dynein light chains and build a comprehensive understanding of dynein assembly, we report here the first molecular-level structure of an IC·LC7 complex from D. melanogaster (79% sequence identity to H. sapiens LC7). The IC·LC7 complex structure reveals unexpected insights into dynein assembly and regulation. It also provides interesting evolutionary perspectives. Comparing LC7 to its likely ancestral fold suggests that the multifunctionality of LC7 is the result of its recruitment for new dynein-related function even while ancient functions are maintained. The gene for D. melanogaster LC7 was a generous gift from Dr. T. Hays (University of Minnesota). The LC7 and IC constructs were cloned into pCR2.1 TOPO using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) then subcloned into pET15d (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany). The IC construct corresponding to residues 212–260 (IC7) was cloned into pET SUMO (Invitrogen) which contains an N-terminal SUMO fusion protein. All constructs included an N-terminal hexahistidine tag, and their sequences were verified by automated sequencing. Recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) host cell lines. Cells expressing LC7, ICTL-d7, ICTL7, and IC92–289 were grown in LB media, and cells expressing IC7 were grown in TB media. All cells were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of ∼0.6. LC7 was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 22 °C, and IC constructs were induced as previously described (13.Makokha M. Hare M. Li M. Hays T. Barbar E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4302-4311Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Proteins were initially purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen); the IC constructs were refolded on the column. The hexahistidine tag was cleaved from LC7 using FactorXa protease (Novagen), and the SUMO tag was cleaved from IC7 using Ulp1-Sumo protease (32.Mossessova E. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Final purification of LC7, ICTL-d7, ICTL7, and IC92–289 was done using size-exclusion chromatography (HiLoad Superdex75 26/60, GE Healthcare). Final purification of IC7 was done using high performance liquid chromatography on a YMC C-18 column in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid with a linear gradient (40–65%) of acetonitrile. Protein purity was verified by SDS-PAGE and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry: LC7 molecular mass = 10,823.6 Da (10,823.4 theoretical), ICTL7 molecular mass = 20,401.8 Da (20,518.5 theoretical), IC7 molecular mass = 5,803.6 Da (5,804.5 theoretical); IC92–289 = molecular mass 24,122.0 Da (23,935.4 theoretical). The deviation from theoretical mass for ICTL7 may be due to N-terminal demethionation and retention of a Na+ ion. The higher mass of IC92–289 could be due to its low signal to noise and ambiguous centroid mass or a covalent difference as in ICTL7. Protein concentrations were determined from sequence-based calculation of absorptivity at 280 nm (33.Wilkins M.R. Gasteiger E. Bairoch A. Sanchez J.C. Williams K.L. Appel R.D. Hochstrasser D.F. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 112: 531-552PubMed Google Scholar). ApoLC7 and the IC92–289·LC7 complex were stored in 15 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm Tris at pH 7.5. The monomeric concentration of LC7 in both apoLC7 and the IC92–289·LC7 complex was 0.5 mm, with a 2-fold excess of IC92–289. Crystals were obtained at 4 °C using 2 μl of hanging drops with an equal volume of reservoir solution equilibrated against a 400 μl reservoir. In attempts to crystallize a supercomplex of IC92–289·Tctex1· LC8·LC7, IC92–289 was proteolytically degraded, but some apoLC7 crystals formed. Optimization of these crystals was done using LC7 alone, and diffraction quality apoLC7 crystals were grown using a reservoir of 20% isopropanol, 20% polyethylene glycol 4000, 100 mm sodium citrate at pH 5.6. Rectangular crystals grew to a final size of 0.1 × 0.12 × 0.05 mm3. For IC·LC7, a 1:500 (v:v) of FactorXa protease (Novagen) was added to a stock solution of IC92–289·LC7 to aid opportunistic crystal lattice formation. Hexagonal rod crystals were obtained using a reservoir of 1 m sodium citrate, 100 mm sodium chloride, 100 mm Tris at pH 7.0. Crystals grew to a final size of 0.25 × 0.06 × 0.06 mm3 within 2 weeks. Mass spectrometry analysis of IC·LC7 crystals showed IC92–289 was proteolysed with no fragments larger than 9 kDa present. Crystals of the IC7·LC7 complex having the same morphology and diffraction properties as those of IC·LC7 were reproducibly grown using the same crystallization conditions but with a 1.1-fold excess of IC7 replacing IC92–289 and with no FactorXa protease added. Crystals were pulled through oil before flash-freezing in loops using liquid nitrogen. For apoLC7, 1.95 Å resolution oscillation data (Δϕ = 1.0°) were collected using an in-house Raxis IV system with CuKα radiation. For IC·LC7, oscillation data (Δϕ = 1.0°) were collected using HHMI beam line 5.0.1 at the Berkeley Advanced Light Source. Data were integrated using MOSFLM (35.Leslie A. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar) and scaled using SCALA (36.Evans P. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3767) Google Scholar). For IC·LC7, data were input into the diffraction anisotropy server without B-factor sharpening (37.Strong M. Sawaya M.R. Wang S. Phillips M. Cascio D. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 8060-8065Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), and an elliptical resolution boundary of 2.7 × 3.0 × 3.0 Å (a*, b*, and c*, respectively) was chosen based on the default three Fo/σFo cutoff. Thus, the IC·LC7 complex has a nominal resolution of 3.0 Å but includes data to 2.7 Å in the a* lattice direction. The apoLC7 space group was P21 with a unit cell of β = 101.8°, a = 56.22, b = 58.69, and c = 65.10 Å; that for IC·LC7 was P32 with unit cell a = b = 107.13, and c = 65.29 Å.

Electron density maps calculated for the IC·LC7 complex show extra helical density for four IC chains. Model building was performed in Coot (39.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23389) Google Scholar), and both apoLC7 and the IC·LC7 complex were refined using restrained isotropic B-factor refinement with one translation libration scres domain per chain in REFMAC (40.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar). Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were applied to the four IC and LC7 chains in the IC·LC7 complex. To confirm the accuracy of the model, unbiased electron density maps were generated starting with a molecular replacement model leaving out side chains for residues Arg-71, Arg-73, Glu-78, and Gln-93. Refinement of this model with poly-Ala helices for αIC2 and the final model show unbiased density for residues Arg-71, Arg-73, Glu-78, and Gln-93 of LC7 and Glu-252 and Asn-253 of IC. Solvent-accessible surface area buried upon complex formation was calculated using SURFACE RACER 5.0 (41.Tsodikov O.V. Record Jr., M.T. Sergeev Y.V. J. Comput. Chem. 2002; 23: 600-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The atomic coordinates and structure factors for apoLC7 and the IC·LC7 complex have PDB accession numbers 3L7H and 3L9K, respectively. Proteins were dialyzed into 50 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm sodium azide at pH 7.5. Thermodynamics of binding were determined at 25 °C using a VP-ITC isothermal titration calorimeter (MicroCal, Northampton, MA). Experiments were conducted with IC7 and ICTL7 in the sample cell and LC7 in the syringe. ICTL7 was pre-bound by a 4-fold excess of Tctex1 and LC8. Data were processed using Origin 7.0 (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA). Heat of dilution, estimated to be equal to the enthalpy of the final injection, was subtracted from the binding data before fitting. LC7 binds IC7 or ICTL7·Tctex1·LC8 with a stoichiometry of 1.0 ± 0.1, but whereas ICTL7·Tctex1·LC8 is well fit by a single-site binding model (A + B → AB, where A and B refer to a single chain of IC and LC7, respectively), IC7 data show small deviations from the best fit. Nonetheless, a single-site binding model was chosen for IC7·LC7 in the absence of further information justifying additional fitting parameters. For all experiments the “c value” (c = [protein]sample cell × Kd−1) was within the 5–500 range required for reliable determination of association constants (42.Turnbull W.B. Daranas A.H. J. Am. Chem.

The monomeric concentrations of Tctex1, LC8, LC7, and the ICTL7·Tctex1·LC8·LC7 complex were 0.135, 0.135, 0.068, and 0.045 mm at loading, respectively. Multiangle light scattering (mini-Dawn, Wyatt Technology) and refractive index (ProStar 350, Varian) data were collected and processed using ASTRA v5.1.9.1 (Wyatt Technology). The peak corresponding to the ICTL7·Tctex1·LC8·LC7 complex was collected during elution and concentrated 10-fold for SDS-PAGE analysis. The apoLC7 crystal structure was solved to 1.95 Å with two LC7 homodimers in the asymmetric unit, each dimer with the expected LC7-fold seen for H. sapiens and R. norvegicus apoLC7 (22.Ilangovan U.

The four LC7 chains in the asymmetric unit have somewhat different N-terminal electron density, with chain B being the best defined (starting residues are Leu-9 for chain A, Met-1 for chain B, and Val-5 for chains C and D). In contrast, the C-terminal density of each chain is equivalent, ending at Asn-94 with residues 95–97 too disordered to model. Conformational differences among the four chains are observed for helix α1 and the loops connecting strands β1 to β2 (L2) and β4 to β5 (L6) (Fig. 2c). The differences in α1 among the four chains are due to variations in the angle of the loop connecting α1 to β1 (L1), with α1 acting as a rigid rod to amplify differences N-terminal to L1. These differences appear related to crystal packing near L1. Interestingly, conformational variations among the four chains in the asymmetric unit recapitulate differences between previously reported structures of apoLC7, with chain B similar to the average conformation in NMR structures (22.Ilangovan U.

The latter also shows the first five residues and loop L6 are too disordered to fully model. IC92–289 bound to LC7 fortuitously crystallized in the presence of protease. Using these crystals, the IC·LC7 complex was solved at a nominal resolution of 3.0 Å with the asymmetric unit containing two LC7 homodimers binding two IC chains per dimer. Each chain of IC and LC7 in the asymmetric unit has similar electron density, with IC chains initially observed as helical density not accounted for by LC7. Data interpretation at 3 Å is challenging, so the N-to-C directionality of IC segments were determined by modeling a poly-Ala chain in both directions, with one orientation clearly fitting better to the unbiased electron density. The unique sequence and registry of IC was determined from the pattern of side chain densities, including buried Leu, Ile, and Phe residues at the IC·LC7 interface. This ultimately guided the modeling of residues Leu-221 through Thr-258 for each IC chain and Gln-3 through Asp-97 for each LC7 chain. A set of unbiased electron density maps provide strong support for the final interpretation (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. 1). Based on this interpretation, the IC7 construct, encompassing IC residues 212–260 (Fig. 1), was designed for use in subsequent studies. As a further verification that the IC segment bound"

Indeed, a major model for Notch signaling posits that Notch trans-endocytosis into the ligand-expressing (signal sending) cell is a key driving force for Notch signal transduction. The extracellular protein thrombospondin-2 (TSP2) enhances Notch signaling and binds to both Jagged1 and Notch3 ectodomains, potentially bridging two essential extracellular components of Notch signaling. We investigated the role of low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1), a TSP2 receptor, in the regulation of Notch3 signaling. TSP2 potentiation of Notch is blocked by the receptor-associated protein (an inhibitor of low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein function) and requires LRP1 expression in the signal-sending cell. TSP2 stimulates Notch3 endocytosis into wild type fibroblasts but not LRP1-deficient fibroblasts. Finally, recombinant Notch3 and Jagged1 interact with the LRP1 85-kDa B-chain, a subunit that lacks known ligand binding function.

IntroductionNotch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved system that mediates direct, short range communication between adjacent cells. This pathway is required during development for cell type specification, which is essential for accurate cell patterning of almost all organs. Increasing evidence suggests that precise regulation of the quantity of Notch signaling is essential for homeostasis and development (dramatically demonstrated by Ref. 1.Schouwey K. Delmas V. Larue L. Zimber-Strobl U. Strobl L.J. Radtke F. Beermann F. Dev. Dyn. 2007; 236: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, factors that modulate the efficacy of Notch signaling may be important in proper function of this important mediator of cell communication.Unlike signaling systems that utilize soluble ligands, Notch signaling requires juxtaposition of membrane proteins expressed on two adjacent cells, commonly defined as the signal-sending and the signal-receiving cell. Mammalian Notch proteins are constitutively processed by furin, resulting in a noncovalently linked heterodimer (2.Blaumueller C.M. Qi H. Zagouras P. Artavanis-Tsakonas S.

U.S.A. 1998; 95: 8108-8112Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Canonical ligands (the DSL (Delta/Serrate/Lag-2) proteins Jagged1–2 and Delta1, -3, and -4) bind to Notch proteins, resulting in sequential processing by two additional proteolytic cleavages (4.Brou C.

Subsequently, the Notch intracellular domain migrates to the nucleus of the cells where it activates gene expression in the Notch signal-receiving cell.The precise molecular mechanisms by which engagement of DSL ligands result in proteolytic Notch activation are under intense scrutiny. A large amount of work has been devoted to understanding the observation that endocytic function in the DSL-expressing cells is critical for Notch function in genetic studies (6.Baron M. Aslam H.

Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Two basic models have been proposed (9.Le Borgne R. Bardin A. Schweisguth F. Development. 2005; 132: 1751-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 10.Wilkin M.B. Baron M. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 11.Chitnis A. Dev. Dyn. 2006; 235: 886-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). One model proposes that endocytosis may modify DSL ligands, thereby activating them, but putative modifications that are hypothesized to occur after endocytic processing of DSL have not been identified.An alternative model is that trans-endocytosis of Notch by the DSL ligand-expressing cells is critical for Notch activation. Specifically, a mechanical force provided by the endocytic machinery of the signal-sending cell may facilitate Notch dissociation and subsequent proteolytic cleavage. Indeed, cells expressing Drosophila ligand Delta, trans-endocytose Notch extracellular domain (12.Parks A.L. Klueg K.M. Stout J.R. Muskavitch M.A. Development. 2000; 127: 1373-1385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Morel V. Le Borgne R. Schweisguth F. Dev.

Although earlier reports suggested that the uptake of Notch into DSL cells may reflect simple clearance of the protein, recent studies have suggested that trans-endocytosis occurs before regulated proteolysis and correlates with Notch activation (15.Nichols J.T. Miyamoto A. Olsen S.L. D'Souza B. Yao C. Weinmaster G. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 445-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Recently, noncanonical Notch-interacting extracellular proteins MAGP were shown to activate signaling through heterodimer dissociation (16.Miyamoto A. Lau R. Hein P.W. Shipley J.M. Weinmaster G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10089-10097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).We recently demonstrated that the matricellular protein TSP2 binds to both Notch3 and Jagged1 and enhances Notch3 signaling (17.Meng H. Zhang X. Hankenson K.D. Wang M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7866-7874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). TSP2 increases the level of binding of Notch3 to Jagged1, suggesting that TSP2 amplifies Notch3 activity by enhancing the canonical Notch pathway. This study was initiated to identify mechanisms of TSP2 enhancement of Notch3 function. TSP2 acts on cells through multifaceted mechanisms. Multiple membrane receptors for TSP2 have been characterized, including CD36, CD47, HSPG, LRP1, and a variety of integrin subtypes (reviewed in Ref. 18.Bornstein P. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 929-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Each of these receptors binds to a defined region of TSP1 or TSP2 and mediates a variety of cell and context-specific cellular processes.Among these receptors, LRP1 is of particular interest because it mediates endocytosis of TSP2-matrix metalloproteinase complexes and facilitates their cell-mediated elimination from the extracellular space through endocytosis and targeting to lysosomes (19.Yang Z. Strickland D.K. Bornstein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8403-8408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Evidence that Notch signaling requires trans-endocytosis of the Notch ectodomain into the signal-sending cell has led us to test the hypothesis that LRP1 mediates TSP2 activation of Notch and facilitates Notch trans-endocytosis.DISCUSSIONIntracellular regulators of Notch and Notch ligand endocytosis are well known modulators of Notch signaling. In contrast, less is known about modulation of Notch proteins by extracellular proteins. Recent studies demonstrate that TSP2 is a novel extracellular Notch-binding protein that interacts with epidermal growth factor repeats of Notch3 and enhances its interaction with Jagged1 (17.Meng H. Zhang X. Hankenson K.D. Wang M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7866-7874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In new experiments described herein, we test whether the TSP2 receptor LRP1 participates in Notch function and describe three novel findings as follows. 1) LRP1 is required for TSP2 potentiation of Notch3 signaling. 2) LRP1 participates in trans-endocytosis of Notch. 3) Both Notch3 and Jagged1 bind directly to the 85-kDa B-chain of LRP1.Role for LRP1 in Notch SignalingLRP1 is a multifunctional receptor and a member of a family of receptors that subserves endocytic and signaling functions. The best described functions of LRP1 include ligand-specific endocytosis and clearance of a large range of secreted proteins (reviewed in Refs. 23.Lillis A.P. Van Duyn L.B. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Strickland D.K. Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88: 887-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 24.Herz J. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar), which include but are not limited to TSP1, TSP2, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP), matrix metalloproteinases, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, tissue plasminogen activator, and amyloid precursor protein. LRP1-mediated clearance requires the nucleation of endocytic components that result in the targeting of complexes to endosomes for recycling or for ultimate disposal by lysosomes.In addition to endocytic function, LRP1 has rapid signaling properties (reviewed in Ref. 23.Lillis A.P. Van Duyn L.B. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Strickland D.K. Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88: 887-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), such as regulation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (25.Lutz C. Nimpf J. Jenny M. Boecklinger K. Enzinger C. Utermann G. Baier-Bitterlich G. Baier G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43143-43151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), disassembly of focal adhesions (26.Orr A.W. Pedraza C.E. Pallero M.A. Elzie C.A. Goicoechea S. Strickland D.K. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and activation of cell contraction (27.Takayama Y. Takahashi H. Mizumachi K. Takezawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22112-22118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These are presumed to be cell autonomous functions. Interestingly, the disassembly of focal adhesions is mediated by a three-protein complex involving LRP1, cell surface-expressed calreticulin, and TSP1 (28.Orr A.W. Elzie C.A. Kucik D.F. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2917-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), demonstrating that the signaling functions of LRP1 involve the collaboration of multiple extracellular proteins.Our studies implicate LRP1 in a new role in cell signaling; LRP1 modulates Notch signaling by virtue of its expression on the DSL-expressing cell (signal-sending cell), and thus, LRP1 has non-cell autonomous signaling function. Given the broad substrate specificity of LRP1, it may be of interest to examine a more general role for this protein in other signaling systems in which trans-endocytosis plays an important role.The modification of Notch signal strength by LRP1 significantly expands the potential mechanisms by which Notch is regulated. The large molecular repertoire of LRP1 indicates that multiple extracellular ligands may impair the ability of LRP1 to enhance Notch function by competing for Notch/TSP2 binding. Moreover, engagement of LRP1 signaling results in phosphorylation of the intracellular domain and attenuation of endocytic function (29.Ranganathan S. Liu C.X. Migliorini M.M. Von Arnim C.A. Peltan I.D. Mikhailenko I. Hyman B.T. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40536-40544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As such, the broad range of LRP1 ligands may down-regulate TSP2-driven Notch signaling by decreasing LRP1-dependent endocytic rates. Clearly, primary control of LRP1 expression could also influence Notch signal strength as well. Interestingly, LRP1 levels are increased in stroma of breast tumors (30.Christensen L. Wiborg Simonsen A.C. Heegaard C.W. Moestrup S.K. Andersen J.A. Andreasen P.A. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 66: 441-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), which are known to be modulated by Notch signaling.LRP1 Participates in Notch Endocytosis and Binds Notch and JaggedIn addition to stimulating Notch activity, the TSP2/LRP1 partnership also activates trans-endocytosis of the Notch ectodomain. Previous work demonstrated that Notch is endocytosed into DSL-expressing cells in Drosophila (12.Parks A.L. Klueg K.M. Stout J.R. Muskavitch M.A. Development. 2000; 127: 1373-1385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Morel V. Le Borgne R. Schweisguth F. Dev. Genes Evol. 2003; 213: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 14.Klueg K.M. Muskavitch M.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3289-3297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, mammalian Notch1 is endocytosed into DSL-expressing cells (15.Nichols J.T. Miyamoto A. Olsen S.L. D'Souza B. Yao C. Weinmaster G. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 445-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and this process is independent of ADAM proteolysis. Although a large array of endocytic proteins that participate in the process have been identified by genetic analysis (reviewed in Ref. 31.Nichols J.T. Miyamoto A. Weinmaster G. Traffic. 2007; 8: 959-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), regulated extracellular and plasma membrane proteins involved in Notch endocytosis have yet to be identified. Our studies of TSP2/LRP1 regulations of Notch3 endocytosis demonstrate for the first time that extracellular factors (aside from Notch and its ligands) modulate trans-endocytosis and Notch function. This study provides additional support for the model proposed by Nichols et al. (15.Nichols J.T. Miyamoto A. Olsen S.L. D'Souza B. Yao C. Weinmaster G. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 445-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) that Notch activity is promoted by trans-endocytosis that mechanically stresses the Notch heterodimer, resulting in proteolytic activation of Notch.Our experiments suggest that multiple molecular mechanisms drive trans-endocytosis of the Notch3 ectodomain. PEA13 cells are still able to functionally activate and endocytose the Notch3 ectodomain, although TSP2 does not enhance this process. RAP inhibition of LRP1 is sufficient to block TSP2-stimulated Notch3 endocytosis and activity, although basal activity of Notch (stimulated by Jagged alone) is not inhibited by RAP. Thus, two modes of endocytosis occur in the same set of cells: 1) LRP1 in the signal-sending cell is required for TSP2-mediated Notch signal enhancement; and 2) TSP2-independent signaling may proceed through mechanisms that are independent of LRP1 in the signal-sending cell; the molecules involved in the latter process remain to be elucidated.What are the mechanisms by which LRP1-mediated trans-endocytosis of Notch is gated by TSP2? At first approximation, the process is analogous to what is seen with many LRP1 ligand complexes. For example, LRP1-mediated endocytosis of MMP2-TSP2 complexes (19.Yang Z. Strickland D.K. Bornstein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8403-8408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-urokinase-type plasminogen activator complexes (32.Stefansson S. Muhammad S. Cheng X.F. Battey F.D. Strickland D.K. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6358-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) is favored over MMP2 or urokinase-type plasminogen activator monomer endocytosis. We have shown that TSP2 not only enhances endocytosis but also increases the binding of Notch3 and Jagged1 (17.Meng H. Zhang X. Hankenson K.D. Wang M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7866-7874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that TSP2 nucleates the formation of multimeric complexes involving Notch and Jagged; such a complex, predicted to have dramatically increased valancy for binding to LRP1 (Notch and Jagged bind to LRP1 along with trimeric TSP2), would have significantly increased binding affinity for LRP1. In addition, it is possible that LRP1 and TSP2 binding to Notch3 and Jagged alters conformations in ways that further promote proteolytic processing and signaling of Notch. It is known that these molecules have functional and structural sensitivity to molecular perturbations induced by protein interactions (33.Rodrigues R.G. Guo N. Zhou L. Sipes J.M. Williams S.B.

Chem. 2004; 279: 21439-21448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), which may alter the conformation of the large postulated complex.The increase in Notch3 signaling stimulated by TSP2 and LRP1 could also result from independent actions on different parts of LRP1. We show that Notch3 and Jagged1 form novel complexes with the 85-kDa B-chain of LRP1. TSP2 and all of the known ligands of LRP1 bind to one or more of the four characterized ligand binding domains of the A-chain. Thus, available data suggest that LRP1 could bind to TSP2 (via the A-chain) and Notch or Jagged (via the B-chain) at the same time, with the possibility that TSP2 simultaneously interacts with Notch3 and/or Jagged1.RAP has conventionally been used as an inhibitor of LRP1 ligands; its wide success in inhibiting low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein function is likely a result of its ability to bind to multiple domains of the A-chain. All LRP1 ligands described to date bind to the A-chain. However, recent studies have disclosed several RAP-independent effects of LRP1 in peripheral nerve injury and neuropathic pain models (40.Gaultier A. Arandjelovic S. Li X. Janes J. Dragojlovic N. Zhou G.P. Dolkas J. Myers R.R. Gonias S.L. Campana W.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Our work raises the possibility that some functions of LRP1 may be mediated by the 85-kDa B-chain, which are predicted to be RAP-insensitive. Further work will be needed to establish whether RAP-insensitive effects of LRP1 in vivo are mediated by proteins that, like Notch3 and Jagged1, operate through B-chain binding.In summary, our experiments demonstrate that TSP2 enhancement of Notch activity requires LRP1 activity. The ability of LRP1 to bind TSP2/Notch3/Jagged1 and to facilitate endocytosis of Notch3 suggests that LRP1 drives regulated trans-endocytosis of Notch3, resulting in enhanced signaling. These studies expand the mechanistic repertoire of LRP1 to include a role in non-cell autonomous short range cell signaling. Moreover, these studies suggest a novel link between the dual roles of LRP1 in endocytic function and in signal transduction. IntroductionNotch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved system that mediates direct, short range communication between adjacent cells.

Canonical ligands (the DSL (Delta/Serrate/Lag-2) proteins Jagged1–2 and Delta1, -3, and -4) bind to Notch proteins, resulting in sequential processing by two additional proteolytic cleavages (4.Brou C.

Subsequently, the Notch intracellular domain migrates to the nucleus of the cells where it activates gene expression in the Notch signal-receiving cell.The precise molecular mechanisms by which engagement of DSL ligands result in proteolytic Notch activation are under intense scrutiny. A large amount of work has been devoted to understanding the observation that endocytic function in the DSL-expressing cells is critical for Notch function in genetic studies (6.Baron M. Aslam H.

Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Two basic models have been proposed (9.Le Borgne R. Bardin A. Schweisguth F. Development. 2005; 132: 1751-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 10.Wilkin M.B. Baron M. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 11.Chitnis A. Dev. Dyn. 2006; 235: 886-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). One model proposes that endocytosis may modify DSL ligands, thereby activating them, but putative modifications that are hypothesized to occur after endocytic processing of DSL have not been identified.An alternative model is that trans-endocytosis of Notch by the DSL ligand-expressing cells is critical for Notch activation. Specifically, a mechanical force provided by the endocytic machinery of the signal-sending cell may facilitate Notch dissociation and subsequent proteolytic cleavage. Indeed, cells expressing Drosophila ligand Delta, trans-endocytose Notch extracellular domain (12.Parks A.L. Klueg K.M. Stout J.R. Muskavitch M.A. Development. 2000; 127: 1373-1385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Morel V. Le Borgne R. Schweisguth F. Dev.

Although earlier reports suggested that the uptake of Notch into DSL cells may reflect simple clearance of the protein, recent studies have suggested that trans-endocytosis occurs before regulated proteolysis and correlates with Notch activation (15.Nichols J.T. Miyamoto A. Olsen S.L. D'Souza B. Yao C. Weinmaster G. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 445-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Recently, noncanonical Notch-interacting extracellular proteins MAGP were shown to activate signaling through heterodimer dissociation (16.Miyamoto A. Lau R. Hein P.W. Shipley J.M. Weinmaster G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10089-10097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).We recently demonstrated that the matricellular protein TSP2 binds to both Notch3 and Jagged1 and enhances Notch3 signaling (17.Meng H. Zhang X. Hankenson K.D. Wang M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7866-7874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). TSP2 increases the level of binding of Notch3 to Jagged1, suggesting that TSP2 amplifies Notch3 activity by enhancing the canonical Notch pathway. This study was initiated to identify mechanisms of TSP2 enhancement of Notch3 function. TSP2 acts on cells through multifaceted mechanisms. Multiple membrane receptors for TSP2 have been characterized, including CD36, CD47, HSPG, LRP1, and a variety of integrin subtypes (reviewed in Ref. 18.Bornstein P. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 929-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Each of these receptors binds to a defined region of TSP1 or TSP2 and mediates a variety of cell and context-specific cellular processes.Among these receptors, LRP1 is of particular interest because it mediates endocytosis of TSP2-matrix metalloproteinase complexes and facilitates their cell-mediated elimination from the extracellular space through endocytosis and targeting to lysosomes (19.Yang Z. Strickland D.K. Bornstein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8403-8408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Evidence that Notch signaling requires trans-endocytosis of the Notch ectodomain into the signal-sending cell has led us to test the hypothesis that LRP1 mediates TSP2 activation of Notch and facilitates Notch trans-endocytosis. Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved system that mediates direct, short range communication between adjacent cells. This pathway is required during development for cell type specification, which is essential for accurate cell patterning of almost all organs. Increasing evidence suggests that precise regulation of the quantity of Notch signaling is essential for homeostasis and development (dramatically demonstrated by Ref. 1.Schouwey K. Delmas V. Larue L. Zimber-Strobl U. Strobl L.J. Radtke F. Beermann F. Dev. Dyn. 2007; 236: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2059266306,"ARR19 (androgen receptor corepressor-19 kDa), a leucine-rich protein whose expression is down-regulated by luteinizing hormone and cAMP, is differentially expressed during the development of Leydig cells and inhibits testicular steroidogenesis by reducing the expression of steroidogenic enzymes. However, the molecular events behind the suppression of testicular steroidogenesis are unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that ARR19 inhibits the transactivation of orphan nuclear receptor Nur77, which is one of the major transcription factors that regulate the expression of steroidogenic enzyme genes in Leydig cells. ARR19 physically interacts with Nur77 and suppresses Nur77-induced promoter activity of steroidogenic enzyme genes including StAR, P450c17, and 3beta-HSD in Leydig cells. Transient transfection and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that ARR19-mediated reduced expression of steroidogenic enzyme genes was likely due to the interference of SRC-1 recruitment to Nur77 protein on the promoter of steroidogenic enzyme genes. These findings suggest that ARR19 acts as a novel coregulator of Nur77, in turn regulating Nur77-induced testicular steroidogenesis, and may play an important role in the development and function of testicular Leydig cells."
https://openalex.org/W2050304998,"Members of the protein kinase C (PKC) family of serine-threonine kinases are important regulators of immune cell survival. Ingenol 3-angelate (PEP005) activates a broad range of PKC isoforms and induces apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia cells by activating the PKC isoform PKCδ. We show here that, in contrast to its effect on leukemic cells, PEP005 provides a strong survival signal to resting and activated human T cells. The antiapoptotic effect depends upon the activation of PKCθ. This PKC isoform is expressed in T cells but is absent in myeloid cells. Further studies of the mechanism involved in this process showed that PEP005 inhibited activated CD8+ T cell apoptosis through the activation of NFκB downstream of PKCθ, leading to increased expression of the antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL. Transfection of CD8+ T cells with dominant-negative PKCθ diminished the prosurvival effect of PEP005 significantly. Ectopic expression of PKCθ in the acute myeloid leukemia cell line NB4 turned their response to PEP005 from an increased to decreased rate of apoptosis.

Due to their structural variation and the resulting activation requirements of PKC family members, these have been categorized into three subclasses: The classical PKCs (α, βI, βII, and γ) are calcium-dependent and diacylglycerol and phorbol ester-responsive; novel PKCs (δ, ϵ, η, and θ) lack the C2 domain and thus are calcium-insensitive but retain responsiveness to diacylglycerol and phorbol ester; atypical PKCs (ζ, ι, and λ) also lack the C2 domain and do not bind diacylglycerol or phorbol ester/diacylglycerol (reviewed in Ref. 1Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Depending on their activation requirements, subcellular localization, and substrate targets, the function of the PKC isoforms can be extremely diverse (2Deacon E.M. Pongracz J. Griffiths G. Lord J.M. Mol. Pathol. 1997; 50: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).The ability of PKC activators to induce apoptosis in a wide range of leukemia-derived cell lines has made them attractive targets for the development of antileukemic drugs (3Mackay H.J. Twelves C.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 554-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In contrast to leukemic cells, activation of a broad range of PKC isoforms in T lymphocytes inhibits apoptosis and increases proliferation (4Mohr H. Pettit G.R. Plessing-Menze A. Immunobiol. 1987; 175: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Currently, this differential response to broad range PKC activators is not fully understood.The novel PKC-activating agent ingenol-3-angelate (PEP005) has been identified as the active component of the sap of the plant Euphorbia peplus. This sap has been used in traditional medicine to treat skin conditions such as actinic keratosis (5Green A.C. Beardmore G.L. Australas. J. Dermatol. 1988; 29: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and basal cell carcinoma (6Weedon D. Chick J. Med. J. Aust. 1976; 1: 928Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). PEP005 has been shown to activate a broad range of PKC isoforms and binds to the C1 domain of classical and novel PKC isoforms (7Kedei N. Lundberg D.J. Toth A. Welburn P. Garfield S.H. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3243-3255Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown to induce apoptosis in a range of myeloid leukemia cell lines and in primary human acute myeloid leukemia cells (8Hampson P. Chahal H. Khanim F. Hayden R. Mulder A. Assi L.K. Bunce C.M. Lord J.M. Blood. 2005; 106: 1362-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) at concentrations in the low nanomolar range. The outcome of PKC activation depends on several factors, including the isoforms expressed and activated in a particular cell, their direction of translocation upon activation (dictating their substrate pool) and their down-regulation by proteasomal degradation (1Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). The proapoptotic effect of PEP005 on leukemia cells depends on the activation of PKCδ (8Hampson P. Chahal H. Khanim F. Hayden R. Mulder A. Assi L.K. Bunce C.M. Lord J.M. Blood. 2005; 106: 1362-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In contrast, treatment of T cells with broad range activators results in their proliferation and survival. Expression of PKCδ is widespread, but T cells also express PKCθ, an isoform that is present at high levels only in T cells and myocytes (9Baier G. Telford D. Giampa L. Coggeshall K.M. Baier-Bitterlich G. Isakov N. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4997-5004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKCθ is highly homologous to PKCδ, but the biological functions of these two isoforms differ considerably. While activation of PKCδ is commonly associated with proapoptotic effects (10Cross T. Griffiths G. Deacon E. Sallis R. Gough M. Watters D. Lord J.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2331-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), the outcome of PKCθ activation is generally antiapoptotic (11Barouch-Bentov R. Lemmens E.E. Hu J. Janssen E.M. Droin N.M. Song J. Schoenberger S.P. Altman A. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 5126-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Studies using PKCθ-deficient mice have demonstrated that PKCθ is an essential factor for the survival of activated primary T cells (11Barouch-Bentov R. Lemmens E.E. Hu J. Janssen E.M. Droin N.M. Song J. Schoenberger S.P. Altman A. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 5126-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). PKCθ is a link in the chain of signals leading from T cell receptor (TCR) ligation to the activation of NFκB, an important regulator of T cell survival. PKCθ translocates to the site of contact with the antigen presenting cell, the immunological synapse (12Monks C.R. Freiberg B.A. Kupfer H. Sciaky N. Kupfer A. Nature. 1998; 395: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1953) Google Scholar, 13Monks C.R. Kupfer H. Tamir I. Barlow A. Kupfer A. Nature. 1997; 385: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), and interacts with signalosome constituents, including CARMA1 (caspase recruitment domain membrane associated guanylate kinase 1), Bcl-10 (B cell lymphoma 10) and MALT 1 (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue 1), as well as the IκB kinase complex. Within this complex, PKCθ phosphorylates CARMA1 (14Wang D. Matsumoto R. You Y. Che T. Lin X.Y. Gaffen S.L. Lin X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and is required to initiate NFκB activation (15Coudronniere N. Villalba M. Englund N. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 3394-3399PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sun Z. Arendt C.W. Ellmeier W. Schaeffer E.M. Sunshine M.J. Gandhi L. Annes J. Petrzilka D. Kupfer A. Schwartzberg P.L. Littman D.R. Nature. 2000; 404: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar).T cell survival is largely regulated by the availability of antiapoptotic factors. These survival factors exert their function through the regulation of expression and subcellular localization of pro and antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. Among these, particularly in T cells, Bim exerts its proapoptotic effect while antiapoptotic Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and Bcl-xL act as its counterparts (17Hildeman D.A. Zhu Y. Mitchell T.C. Kappler J. Marrack P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 18Zhu Y. Swanson B.J. Wang M. Hildeman D.A. Schaefer B.C. Liu X. Suzuki H. Mihara K. Kappler J. Marrack P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 7681-7686Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).In the present study, we demonstrate the antiapoptotic effect of the broad range PKC activator PEP005 on activated and resting T cells. This activity contrasts with the proapoptotic response induced in myeloid leukemic cells. The data show that PEP005 induced survival of T cells and that this was dependent on activation of PKCθ and correlated with up-regulation of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL. Furthermore, our work emphasizes the role of PKCθ in the divergent response of primary CD8+ T cells and myeloid leukemic cells to PKC activation.RESULTSThe plant-derived PKC activator PEP005 initiates apoptosis in a range of cell lines derived from myeloid leukemia, including NB4, as well as primary leukemic cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (8Hampson P. Chahal H. Khanim F. Hayden R. Mulder A. Assi L.K. Bunce C.M. Lord J.M. Blood. 2005; 106: 1362-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1a, we confirm that apoptosis is triggered in NB4 cells at nanomolar concentrations of PEP005. In contrast, PEP005 did not affect the survival of Jurkat cells (Fig. 1b), a human T cell leukemia cell line (20Gillis S. Watson J. J. Exp. Med. 1980; 152: 1709-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Activated human T cells enter apoptosis spontaneously if deprived of survival factors such as IL-15 or IL-2. This spontaneous entry into the apoptotic pathway can be inhibited by PEP005 (Fig. 1c) in normal activated human T cells. In the experiment shown in Fig. 1c, activated CD8+ T cells were exposed to PEP005 in the absence and presence of 25 units/ml IL-2. The same concentrations of PEP005 that induced apoptosis in NB4 cells significantly inhibited apoptosis of IL-2 deprived CD8+ T cells. Survival of activated CD4+ T cells was affected to a similar extent, in the presence of fetal calf serum apoptosis was delayed, but the antiapoptotic effect of PEP005 was not affected (data not shown). Time course experiments shown in Fig. 1d revealed that this is not a permanent block of apoptosis but rather a delay of apoptosis to the same extent as addition of optimal concentrations of IL-2. Detection of an epitope specific for activated caspase 3 was used as a readout for apoptosis. Mitochondrial depolarization was assessed by detection of JC-1 incorporation in parallel experiments, yielding consistent results (data not shown).The effects of many modulators of apoptosis are restricted to cells in the active phases of the cell cycle (21Evan G.I. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (2642) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether the effect of PEP005 was restricted to proliferating T cells. For this purpose, an assay was developed to distinguish between cells that had been actively proliferating during a 2-h time window in which the cells were exposed to BrdUrd. At the end of a 48-h incubation period, the cells were stained for active caspase-3 and for incorporation of BrdUrd. As shown in Fig. 1e, PEP005 inhibited apoptosis both in T cells that had been actively proliferating during the BrdUrd exposure and cells that had not been in S-phase. We conclude from these experiments that PEP005 does not preferentially affect proliferating T cells.Although the initial experiments focused on the effects of PEP005 on in vitro-activated CD8+ T cells, the next series of experiments was directed at the effects of PEP005 on freshly isolated resting human CD8+ T cells. Depending on the parameters used, these cells can be subdivided into a number of functionally distinct subpopulations (22Sallusto F. Geginat J. Lanzavecchia A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 745-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). Co-labeling with antibodies detecting CCR7 and CD45RA allows distinction of four subsets: naïve CD8+ T cells coexpressing CCR7 and CD45RA, central memory T cells expressing CCR7 but not CD45RA, effector memory T cells negative for both CCR7 and CD45RA, and a smaller subset of T cells expressing CD45RA but not CCR7 (Fig. 2). Sorting and culturing these cells in the presence and absence of PEP005 showed that although naïve and central memory T cells had a significant increase in their survival, there was no significant change in the apoptosis of effector memory or CCR7−CD45RA+CD8+ T cells.FIGURE 2PEP005 inhibits apoptosis in resting peripheral blood naive and effector memory CD8+ T cells ex vivo. Resting human peripheral blood CD8+ T cells were sorted according to their expression of CD45RA and CCR7. Ex vivo sorted CD8+ T cells were cultured in serum-free medium in the presence/absence (-ve) of PEP005, and levels of apoptosis were analyzed by intracellular staining of active caspase-3 on day 7.

Cohen J.J. Lymphokine Res. 1986; 5: 289-299PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether such an autocrine loop was mediating the antiapoptotic effect of PEP005 on T cells, a blocking antibody to IL-2 was added to the cultures. As shown in Fig. 3a, whereas the blocking antibody could eliminate the effect of externally added IL-2, it did not inhibit PEP005-mediated survival of T cells. These observations suggest that the inhibition of T cell death cannot be explained by PEP005-induced IL-2 production.FIGURE 3Antiapoptotic effect of PEP005 requires PKC activation and is not dependent on autocrine IL-2 production. Activated CD8+ T cells were treated in the presence/absence of an anti-IL-2 antibody (A), indicated concentrations of pan-PKC inhibitor BisI (B), cPKC inhibitor (inhib.) Gö6976 (C), PKCβ-specific inhibitor (D) and 25 units/ml IL-2 and/or 20 nm PEP005 for 2 days. Levels of apoptosis were analyzed by intracellular staining of active caspase-3. Although the survival effect depends on PKC activation, inhibition of classical PKC by Gö6976 only had a partial effect, and inhibition of PKCβ did not reduce significantly the antiapoptotic effect of PEP005.

To test whether the antiapoptotic effect of PEP005 was dependent on the activation of PKC, BisI, a PKC inhibitor with broad specificity for classical and novel PKC isoforms was added to the cultures. As shown in Fig. 3b, BisI can completely abrogate the survival effect of PEP005. The inhibitor of classical PKC isoforms Gö6976, on the other hand, only had a partial effect on the PEP005-mediated inhibition of T cell apoptosis (Fig. 3c). An inhibitor specific for PKCβ did not have a significant effect on the inhibition of T cell apoptosis mediated by PEP005 (Fig. 3d). This observation suggested an involvement of novel PKC isoforms in the antiapoptotic effect of PEP005.Among the novel PKC isoforms, PKCθ is an important regulator of T cell survival. As described previously, PKCθ is not expressed in myeloid cells (9Baier G. Telford D. Giampa L. Coggeshall K.M. Baier-Bitterlich G. Isakov N. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4997-5004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Titration of varying cell numbers of NB4 and activated CD8+ T cells into Western blots confirmed the reports that PKCθ is expressed by T cells but not by NB4 cells (Fig. 4a). Positive evidence for activation of PKCθ by PEP005 was yielded by experiments involving immunoprecipitation of PKCθ phosphorylated on Thr-219, a site associated with enzymatic activity (Fig. 4b). Although the phosphorylation of PKCθ at Thr-219 was induced by PEP005, it could be inhibited by the PKCθ-specific inhibitor. We therefore hypothesized that PKCθ expression by T cells may explain the observation that broad range PKC activation leads to an antiapoptotic signal in T cells while it induces apoptosis in myeloid leukemia cell lines. In the next series of experiments, we used a specific peptide inhibitor of PKCθ. As shown in Fig. 4c, inhibition of PKCθ could completely abrogate the survival effect of PEP005 on T cells. In contrast, the antileukemic effect of PEP005 on leukemia cells was not affected by the PKCθ inhibitor (Fig. 4d). This result suggests that the inhibition of PKCθ does not affect the proapoptotic effect mediated by PKCδ, which is highly homologous to PKCθ (24Osada S. Mizuno K. Saido T.C. Suzuki K. Kuroki T. Ohno S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3930-3938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and allows separation of the proapoptotic effect of PEP005 on leukemic cells from the antiapoptotic effect on T cells. Transfection of peripheral blood CD8+ T cells with a dominant-negative, kinase-inactive mutant of PKCθ significantly reduced the antiapoptotic effect of PEP005 (Fig. 4, e–g). As expected for a kinase involved in the inhibition of apoptosis, transfection with a dominant-negative form of PKCθ also increased the amount of constitutive apoptosis (Fig. 4f). We further confirmed the role of PKCθ in the inhibition of apoptosis by transfection of NB4 cells with a plasmid coding for full-length PKCθ (Fig. 4h). Whereas PEP005 treatment increased apoptosis in NB4 cells transfected with empty control vector, the PKCθ-transfected cells responded to PEP005 with inhibition of apoptosis (Fig. 4i). Due to the technical difficulty of transfecting promyelocytic cells without inducing apoptosis, the differences observed were not very dramatic; however, the observed effect was highly reproducible. These data support the contention that expression of PKCθ determines whether a hematopoietic cell receives a pro- or antiapoptotic stimulus when exposed to broad range PKC-activating agents.FIGURE 4Role of PKCθ in the response of NB4 cells and T cells to PEP005. A, expression of PKCθ in NB4 cells and CD8+ T cells was determined by Western blotting of cell lysate obtained from 1, 2, and 4 × 105 cells with an anti-PKCθ antibody. B, activation of PKCθ upon PEP005 exposure was detected by immunoprecipitation of activated PKCθ phosphorylated at threonine 219 and detection of PKCθ by Western blotting. Phosphorylation of PKCθ was blocked by preincubation of the cells with PKCθ inhibitor (PKCθ inhib.) Detection of β-actin in the unbound lysate was used to control for equivalent cell input. C, activated CD8+ T cells were preincubated with (triangles) and without (squares) 10 μm PKCθ inhibitor and then with indicated concentrations of PEP005 in the absence of IL-2. Levels of apoptosis were analyzed by intracellular staining of active caspase-3 on day 2. D, NB4 cells were cultured in the presence and absence of 10 μm PKCθ inhibitor in the presence/absence of 20 nm PEP005. Levels of apoptosis were analyzed on day 2 by detection of activated caspase 3. E, peripheral blood CD8+ T cells were transfected with an expression vector coding for kinase-inactive PKCθ (PKCθK/R). Western blots of cell lysates of control transfected or kinase-inactive PKCθ-transfected cells were probed with an anti-PKCθ antibody. F, after 6 h of transfection, control and PKCθK/R transfected CD8+ T cells were incubated in the presence or absence of PEP005 for 24 h. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by staining for activated caspase-3 and gating on the GFP expressing cell population. G, the percentage of apoptotic cells in PEP005-treated cells from three independent experiments on CD8+ T cells transfected with GFP and kinase-inactive PKCθ is shown. H, PKCθ expression was detected in GFP+-sorted NB4 cells co-transfected with empty vector or PKCθ-coding vector. I, GFP+-sorted NB4 cells co-transfected with PKCθ-coding (black bar) and control vector (empty bar) were treated with 20 nm PEP005 for 10 h, and apoptosis was detected by intracellular staining of active caspase-3. Data shown are for PEP005-treated cells and are expressed as mean ± S.D. for the percent increase or decrease of apoptosis over untreated cells.

The relative levels of expression of Bcl-2 family members govern the decision between survival and apoptosis in many aspects of T cell biology (18Zhu Y. Swanson B.J. Wang M. Hildeman D.A. Schaefer B.C. Liu X. Suzuki H. Mihara K. Kappler J. Marrack P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 7681-7686Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The expression of the proapoptotic protein Bim is thought to initiate mitochondrial depolarisation in T cells, which can be counterbalanced by expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or Mcl-1. The levels of expression of these proteins were investigated in T cells treated either for 15 min or for 24 h with PEP005. As shown in Fig. 5, PEP005 did not lead to any obvious changes in Bcl-2 levels. However, within 24 h, an increase of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL levels was observed. The level of expression of BimEL, the highest molecular weight isoform of Bim, increased at 24 h. The increase in BIMEL was dramatically reduced in the presence of PEP005. In cells treated with PEP005, we also observed appearance of a higher molecular weight band. This band may correspond to the phosphorylated form of BimEL. The addition of either BisI, or the PKCθ inhibitor, prevented the increase in expression of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL. The reduced levels of BimEL expression in cells cultured with PEP005 were not affected by inhibition of PKC or PKCθ. The lower levels of BimEL may either be caused by an inhibition of the increase in BimEL levels or by accelerated PKC-independent degradation. We conclude from our investigation of the effect of PEP005 on relative levels of Bcl-2 family members, that PKCθ activation by PEP005 increases cell survival by alteration of the balance between pro- and antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family.FIGURE 5Induction of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL and reduction of BimEL in activated CD8+ T cells by PEP005. A, 1 × 106/ml activated CD8+ T cells in serum-free medium were treated in the presence/absence of 300 nm BisI or 10 μm PKCθ inhibitor (inhib.) for 30 min and then in the presence/absence of 20 nm PEP005 for the duration indicated. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies specific for Bcl-2, Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, and Bim; β-actin was measured as a loading control. B, abundance of Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, and BimEL in cell lysates were quantified by densitometry of immunobands. Density of immunobands were first normalized to that of β-actin and then normalized to values of untreated cells of 15 min in culture (Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL) or untreated cells of 24 h in culture (BimEL).

The effect of PEP005 on the activity of NFκB p65 was assayed by a plate-bound assay of nuclear translocation of p65 (Fig. 6, a and b). PEP005 treatment led to rapid nuclear translocation of p65. This activation was blocked entirely by the PKCθ inhibitor. We further confirmed these observations by staining cytospin preparations of activated CD8+ T cells with anti-NFκB p65 antibody. Cells were treated either with or without PEP005 after pretreatment with or without PKC θ inhibitor (Fig. 6c). Nuclear translocation was quantified and showed a significant increase in the nuclear p65 level that was inhibited in the cells pretreated with the PKCθ inhibitor (Fig. 6d).FIGURE 6Activation of NFκB by PEP005 inhibits apoptosis of activated CD8+ T cells. A, activated CD8+ T cells were treated in the presence/absence of 10 μm PKCθ inhibitor (inhib.) and then in the presence/absence of 20 nm PEP005 for 5, 10, and 15 min. Nuclear extracts were analyzed for activated p65 with the TransAM NFκB p65 activation kit. A, data shown are mean ± S.D. of the corrected absorbance (A450 nm–A650 nm). B, fold increase values were obtained by normalization of absorbance values from untreated cells.

Data shown are mean ± S.D. of the nuclear p65 expression detected as a percentage of the total cellular level of p65. E, activated CD8+ T cells were treated in the presence/absence of indicated concentration of BAY11-7085 prior to addition of 25 units/ml IL-2 or 20 nm PEP005. Levels of apoptosis were analyzed by intracellular staining of active caspase-3 on day 2. Data are mean ± S.D. from five independent experiments. An asterisk denotes p < 0.05, whereas ns denotes p > 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Inhibition of NFκB activity led to a titratable increase of the rate of spontaneous apoptosis. The antiapoptotic effect of PEP005 was significantly reduced by addition of BAY11-7085 (Fig. 6e). Taken together, these data suggest that PEP005 treatment-induced PKCθ activation leads to nuclear translocation of NFκB p65 and that the antiapoptotic effect depends on NFκB activation.DISCUSSIONThe observations made in this study provide an explanation for the difference in the response of myeloid leukemia cell lines and T cells to PKC activation. Whereas many cell lines enter apoptosis upon treatment with PEP005, T cells receive a strong antiapoptotic signal. The data shown here indicate that this antiapoptotic signal is mediated by activation of PKCθ in T cells. Downstream of PKCθ activation, we observed activation of the canonical NFκB pathway and a change in the ratio between expression of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member BimEL and antiapoptotic family members Bcl-xL and Mcl-1. Most cytotoxic drugs used in chemotherapy target rapidly proliferating cells and therefore suppress the function of the immune system. PKC activators, however, induce apoptosis in many myeloid leukemia cell types in vivo and in vitro and at the same time act as potential immune stimulants. They were shown to cause T cell activation, proliferation, and secretion of cytokine such as IL-2 (4Mohr H. Pettit G.R. Plessing-Menze A. Immunobiol. 1987; 175: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Previous work from our group has shown that nanomolar concentrations of PEP005 triggered apoptosis of cells lines derived from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (8Hampson P. Chahal H. Khanim F. Hayden R. Mulder A. Assi L.K. Bunce C.M. Lord J.M. Blood. 2005; 106: 1362-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and, in the other independent study, PEP005 enhanced cytotoxic functions of neutrophils in vitro and prevented relapse of grafted skin tumors in vivo (25Challacombe J.M. Suhrbier A. Parsons P.G. Jones B. Hampson P. Kavanagh D. Rainger G.E. Morris M. Lord J.M. Le T.T. Hoang-Le D. Ogbourne S.M. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 8123-8132Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The only previous study of effects of PEP005 on T cells was investigating the cytokine production by T cells of acute myeloid leukemia patients in vitro. If added in conjunction with stimulating anti-CD3 antibody, PEP005 increased cytokine release (including IL-2 and interferon-γ) from T cells (26Ersvaer E. Hampson P. Hatfield K. Ulvestad E. Wendelbo Ø. Lord J.M. Gjertsen B.T. Bruserud Ø. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2007; 56: 913-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The previous finding that PEP005 can increase IL-2 production raised the possibility that the underlying survival mechanism in T cells was an autocrine loop of increased IL-2 production. Inhibition with blocking anti-IL-2 antibodies, however, did not prevent the antiapoptotic effect of PEP005 on T cells. Looking for an alternative mechanism, we investigated the effect of PEP005 on PKCθ. The essential role of PKCθ signaling for activation of NFκB in T cell activation and survival is well established (15Coudronniere N. Villalba M. Englund N. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 3394-3399PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sun Z. Arendt C.W. Ellmeier W. Schaeffer E.M. Sunshine M.J. Gandhi L. Annes J. Petrzilka D. Kupfer A. Schwartzberg P.L. Littman D.R. Nature. 2000; 404: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Our own studies on survival of activated CD8+ T cells have indeed shown that PEP005 activates PKCθ. Phosphorylation of Thr-219, an autophosphorylation site critical for NFκB activation, was clearly demonstrated (27Thuille N. Heit I. Fresser F. Krumböck N. Bauer B. Leuthaeusser S. Dammeier S. Graham C. Copeland T.D. Shaw S. Baier G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3869-3880Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The NFκB pathway is an important regulator of the balance between pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. These regulate CD8+ T cell apoptosis at different development and differentiation stages; it has been shown that cytokine-deprivation mediated apoptosis of activated CD8+ T cells and viral antigen-specific CD8+ T cells from patients with chronic viral infection were caused by loss of Mcl-1 and increased expression of BimEL (28Bosque A. Marzo I. Naval J. Anel A. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 1446-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 29Lopes A.R. Kellam P. Das A. Dunn C. Kwan A. Turner J. Peppa D. Gilson R.J. Gehring A. Bertoletti A. Maini M.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 1835-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Bcl-xL up-regulation mediated by T cell activation and PKCθ-NFκB signaling supports survival of activated T cells (11Barouch-Bentov R. Lemmens E.E. Hu J. Janssen E.M. Droin N.M. Song J. Schoenberger S.P. Altman A. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 5126-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 30Manicassamy S. Gupta S. Huang Z. Sun Z. J.

Immunol. 2007; 178: 2932-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The ability to express these antiapoptotic Bcl-2 members autonomously can enhance the lifespan of effector T cells. That regulation Bcl-2 itself was not observed in our system may be due the larger nonregulated nuclear pool of Bcl-2, which can mask regulation of the mitochondrial level of Bcl-2 (32Scheel-Toellner D. Raza K. Assi L. Pilling D. Ross E.J. Lee W.Y. Curnow S.J. Buckley C.D. Akbar A.N. Lord J.M. Salmon M. Apoptosis. 2008; 13: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Our finding recapitulates the role of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 members in CD8+ T cell apoptosis, as the loss of Mcl-1 and elevated BimEL expression followed by cytokine deprivation was reversed by PEP005, together with the up-regulation of Bcl-xL. When PKCθ was inhibited, PEP005-induced activation of NFκB was completely abrogated, and this, together with the failure of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL up-regulation, subsequently led to activation of caspase-3 and apoptosis.Homeostatic control of naïve CD8+ T cell numbers is highly regulated by levels of common γ-chain cytokines IL-7 and IL-15 and stimulation of MHC-I molecules (33Gett A.V. Sallusto F. Lanzavecchia A. Geginat J. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Following antigen clearance, declined availability of survival factors renders activated CD8+ T cells highly susceptible to apoptosis. PEP005 inhibited this cytokine-deprivation induced apoptosis by delaying the process of apoptosis of freshly isolated naïve and also central memory CD8+ T cells in vitro. It is interesting, in this context, that central memory CD8+ T cells, in particular, were found to be the most effective CD8+ T cell subset in generating anti-tumor responses in vivo (34Klebanoff C.A. Gattinoni L. Torabi-Parizi P. Kerstann K. Cardones A.R. Finkelstein S.E. Palmer D.C. Antony P.A. Hwang S.T. Rosenberg S.A. Waldmann T.A. Restifo N.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 9571-9576Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar).We conclude from these studies, that broad range PKC activation can be a survival factor for activated and resting T cells, whereas it exerts a powerful proapoptotic signal to leukemia cells. This divergent response can be explained by the difference in expression of PKCθ between T cells and leukemic cells derived from acute myeloid leukemia patients. IntroductionMany cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, are regulated by serine-threonine protein kinases belonging to the PKC 2The abbreviations used are: PKCprotein kinase CBisIbisindolylmaleimide IBrdUrdbromodeoxyuridinewtwild-typeILinterleukinPBSphosphate-buffered salineTCRT cell receptorGFPgreen fluorescent proteinTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanateBimELextra long form of Bim (Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death). isoenzyme family. Due to their structural variation and the resulting activation requirements of PKC family members, these have been categorized into three subclasses: The classical PKCs (α, βI, βII, and γ) are calcium-dependent and diacylglycerol and phorbol ester-responsive; novel PKCs (δ, ϵ, η, and θ) lack the C2 domain and thus are calcium-insensitive but retain responsiveness to diacylglycerol and phorbol ester; atypical PKCs (ζ, ι, and λ) also lack the C2 domain and do not bind diacylglycerol or phorbol ester/diacylglycerol (reviewed in Ref. 1Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Depending on their activation requirements, subcellular localization, and substrate targets, the function of the PKC isoforms can be extremely diverse (2Deacon E.M. Pongracz J. Griffiths G. Lord J.M. Mol. Pathol. 1997; 50: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).The ability of PKC activators to induce apoptosis in a wide range of leukemia-derived cell lines has made them attractive targets for the development of antileukemic drugs (3Mackay H.J. Twelves C.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 554-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In contrast to leukemic cells, activation of a broad range of PKC isoforms in T lymphocytes inhibits apoptosis and increases proliferation (4Mohr H. Pettit G.R. Plessing-Menze A. Immunobiol. 1987; 175: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Currently, this differential response to broad range PKC activators is not fully understood.The novel PKC-activating agent ingenol-3-angelate (PEP005) has been identified as the active component of the sap of the plant Euphorbia peplus. This sap has been used in traditional medicine to treat skin conditions such as actinic keratosis (5Green A.C. Beardmore G.L. Australas. J. Dermatol. 1988; 29: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and basal cell carcinoma (6Weedon D. Chick J. Med. J. Aust. 1976; 1: 928Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). PEP005 has been shown to activate a broad range of PKC isoforms and binds to the C1 domain of classical and novel PKC isoforms (7Kedei N. Lundberg D.J. Toth A. Welburn P. Garfield S.H. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3243-3255Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown to induce apoptosis in a range of myeloid leukemia cell lines and in primary human acute myeloid leukemia cells (8Hampson P. Chahal H. Khanim F. Hayden R. Mulder A. Assi L.K. Bunce C.M. Lord J.M. Blood. 2005; 106: 1362-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) at concentrations in the low nanomolar range. The outcome of PKC activation depends on several factors, including the isoforms expressed and activated in a particular cell, their direction of translocation upon activation (dictating their substrate pool) and their down-regulation by proteasomal degradation (1Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). The proapoptotic effect of PEP005 on leukemia cells depends on the activation of PKCδ (8Hampson P. Chahal H. Khanim F. Hayden R. Mulder A. Assi L.K. Bunce C.M. Lord J.M. Blood. 2005; 106: 1362-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In contrast, treatment of T cells with broad range activators results in their proliferation and survival. Expression of PKCδ is widespread, but T cells also express PKCθ, an isoform that is present at high levels only in T cells and myocytes (9Baier G. Telford D. Giampa L. Coggeshall K.M. Baier-Bitterlich G. Isakov N. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4997-5004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKCθ is highly homologous to PKCδ, but the biological functions of these two isoforms differ considerably. While activation of PKCδ is commonly associated with proapoptotic effects (10Cross T. Griffiths G. Deacon E. Sallis R. Gough M. Watters D. Lord J.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2331-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), the outcome of PKCθ activation is generally antiapoptotic (11Barouch-Bentov R. Lemmens E.E. Hu J. Janssen E.M. Droin N.M. Song J. Schoenberger S.P. Altman A. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 5126-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Studies using PKCθ-deficient mice have demonstrated that PKCθ is an essential factor for the survival of activated primary T cells (11Barouch-Bentov R. Lemmens E.E. Hu J. Janssen E.M. Droin N.M. Song J. Schoenberger S.P. Altman A. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 5126-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). PKCθ is a link in the chain of signals leading from T cell receptor (TCR) ligation to the activation of NFκB, an important regulator of T cell survival. PKCθ translocates to the site of contact with the antigen presenting cell, the immunological synapse (12Monks C.R. Freiberg B.A. Kupfer H. Sciaky N. Kupfer A. Nature. 1998; 395: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1953) Google Scholar, 13Monks C.R. Kupfer H. Tamir I. Barlow A. Kupfer A. Nature. 1997; 385: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), and interacts with signalosome constituents, including CARMA1 (caspase recruitment domain membrane associated guanylate kinase 1), Bcl-10 (B cell lymphoma 10) and MALT 1 (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue 1), as well as the IκB kinase complex. Within this complex, PKCθ phosphorylates CARMA1 (14Wang D. Matsumoto R. You Y. Che T. Lin X.Y. Gaffen S.L. Lin X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and is required to initiate NFκB activation (15Coudronniere N. Villalba M. Englund N. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 3394-3399PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sun Z. Arendt C.W. Ellmeier W. Schaeffer E.M. Sunshine M.J. Gandhi L. Annes J. Petrzilka D. Kupfer A. Schwartzberg P.L. Littman D.R. Nature. 2000; 404: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar).T cell survival is largely regulated by the availability of antiapoptotic factors. These survival factors exert their function through the regulation of expression and subcellular localization of pro and antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. Among these, particularly in T cells, Bim exerts its proapoptotic effect while antiapoptotic Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and Bcl-xL act as its counterparts (17Hildeman D.A. Zhu Y. Mitchell T.C. Kappler J. Marrack P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 18Zhu Y. Swanson B.J. Wang M. Hildeman D.A. Schaefer B.C. Liu X. Suzuki H. Mihara K. Kappler J. Marrack P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 7681-7686Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).In the present study, we demonstrate the antiapoptotic effect of the broad range PKC activator PEP005 on activated and resting T cells. This activity contrasts with the proapoptotic response induced in myeloid leukemic cells. The data show that PEP005 induced survival of T cells and that this was dependent on activation of PKCθ and correlated with up-regulation of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL. Furthermore, our work emphasizes the role of PKCθ in the divergent response of primary CD8+ T cells and myeloid leukemic cells to PKC activation."
https://openalex.org/W1978736696,"Interleukin-1 (IL-1) induces extracellular matrix degradation as a result of increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). We examined adhesion-restricted signaling pathways that enable IL-1-induced MMP release in human gingival and murine fibroblasts. Of the seven MMPs and three tissue inhibitors of MMPs screened, IL-1 enhanced release only of MMP3 when cells formed focal adhesions. Inhibition of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), which are enriched in focal adhesions, blocked IL-1-induced MMP3 release. Accordingly, in contrast to wild-type cells, fibroblasts null for PTPalpha did not exhibit IL-1-induced MMP3 release. IL-1 treatment enhanced the recruitment of SHP-2 and PTPalpha to focal adhesions and the association of PTPalpha with SHP-2. Pulldown assays confirmed a direct interaction between PTPalpha and SHP-2, which was dependent on the intact, membrane-proximal phosphatase domain of PTPalpha. Interactions between SHP-2 and PTPalpha, recruitment of SHP-2 to focal adhesions, IL-1-induced ERK activation, and MMP3 expression were all blocked by point mutations in the phosphatase domains of PTPalpha. These data indicate that IL-1-induced signaling through focal adhesions leading to MMP3 release and interactions between SHP-2 and PTPalpha are dependent on the integrity of the catalytic domains of PTPalpha."
https://openalex.org/W1984710872,"Escherichia coli DinB (DNA polymerase IV) possesses an enzyme architecture resulting in specialized lesion bypass function and the potential for creating −1 frameshifts in homopolymeric nucleotide runs. We have previously shown that the mutagenic potential of DinB is regulated by the DNA damage response protein UmuD2. In the current study, we employ a pre-steady-state fluorescence approach to gain a mechanistic understanding of DinB regulation by UmuD2. Our results suggest that DinB, like its mammalian and archaeal orthologs, uses a template slippage mechanism to create single base deletions on homopolymeric runs. With 2-aminopurine as a fluorescent reporter in the DNA substrate, the template slippage reaction results in a prechemistry fluorescence change that is inhibited by UmuD2. We propose a model in which DNA templates containing homopolymeric nucleotide runs, when bound to DinB, are in an equilibrium between non-slipped and slipped conformations. UmuD2, when bound to DinB, displaces the equilibrium in favor of the non-slipped conformation, thereby preventing frameshifting and potentially enhancing DinB activity on non-slipped substrates. Escherichia coli DinB (DNA polymerase IV) possesses an enzyme architecture resulting in specialized lesion bypass function and the potential for creating −1 frameshifts in homopolymeric nucleotide runs. We have previously shown that the mutagenic potential of DinB is regulated by the DNA damage response protein UmuD2. In the current study, we employ a pre-steady-state fluorescence approach to gain a mechanistic understanding of DinB regulation by UmuD2.

DNA polymerases of the Y family catalyze replication on damaged DNA templates, thereby providing cells with a mechanism to tolerate DNA damage by a process called translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) 3The abbreviations used are: TLStranslesion DNA synthesisPol κeukaryotic DNA polymerase κ2-AP2-aminopurine. (1.Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. Wood R.D. Schultz R.A. Ellenberger T. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC2005: 509-568Google Scholar). However, there is a potential mutagenic cost to TLS that is due to the intrinsic architecture of Y family polymerases. Although Y family and replicative polymerases share a similar “right-handed” fold, those in the Y family, which lack proofreading capability, make minimal contacts with substrate DNA and dNTP, resulting in higher error rates (1.Friedberg E.C.

Therefore, Y family polymerases are regulated to prevent inappropriate access to DNA replication intermediates and thus sustain genomic integrity (2.Sutton M.D. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Y family polymerases belonging to the DinB class are found in all domains of life and include Escherichia coli DinB (polymerase IV), Sulfolobus solfataricus Dpo4, Sulfolobus acidocaldarius Dbh, and, in eukaryotes, DNA polymerase κ (Pol κ) (3.Ohmori H.

DinB and its orthologs produce single-base deletions at high rates (∼10−2 to 10−4) on repetitive DNA sequences both in vitro and in vivo (11.Boudsocq F. Kokoska R.J. Plosky B.S. Vaisman A. Ling H.

The sequence specificity for single-base deletion formation by DinB and its archaeal orthologs (Dpo4 and Dbh) is remarkably similar, with all family members having elevated −1 frameshift potential on homopolymer sequences flanked by a 5′ G (13.Potapova O.

It seems likely that some feature of the architecture of DinB orthologs that enables them to bypass N2-dG lesions, namely an open active site and lack of proofreading, results in single-base deletions via a common mechanism on similar repetitive sequences. Single-base deletions have been proposed to occur by three different mechanisms, illustrated in Fig. 1. Misinsertion misalignment occurs when an incorrect nucleotide enters the active site of the polymerase (step 1) and is incorporated at the primer terminus, creating a base substitution error (step 2) (19.Kunkel T.A. Soni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14784-14789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 4946-4950Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A subsequent DNA rearrangement results in the newly added terminal nucleotide of the primer pairing with the complementary base 5′ to the templating base (+1-position), forcing the templating (0-position) base to become unpaired in an “extrahelical” 4The term “extrahelical” is used to describe the location of a base that lacks a base-pairing partner. However, the actual location of the base in solution is uncertain. structure (step 3). In the template slippage model proposed by Streisinger (Streisinger slippage) (21.Streisinger G. Okada Y. Emrich J. Newton J. Tsugita A. Terzaghi E. Inouye M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1966; 31: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar), the polymerase can potentially form two enzyme·DNA binary conformations that are presumably in equilibrium. The non-slipped conformation has all of the bases properly base-paired (top structure). The slipped preinsertion binary conformation (bottom) occurs when the primer and template strands misalign, resulting in an unpaired base (step 1). However, the equilibrium can be displaced in favor of the slipped conformation by binding of a dNTP complementary to the next templating base to form a slipped ternary complex (step 2). The slipped preinsertion binary and preinsertion ternary intermediates do not require phosphodiester bond formation for stability because the terminal base of the primer is correctly paired with a base on the template strand. The primer of the slipped ternary complex is then extended by phosphodiester bond formation (step 3). In the dNTP-stabilized misalignment mechanism (22.Bloom L.B. Chen X. Fygenson D.K. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27919-27930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 23.Efrati E. Tocco G. Eritja R. Wilson S.H. Goodman M.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1986; 261: 13581-13587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an incoming nucleotide pairs with a base 5′ to the templating base (+1), forcing the templating base (0) to become extrahelical (step 1). The extrahelical base is then stabilized by phosphodiester bond formation (step 2). Although all the mechanisms outlined above have a similar end point, each pathway results in different intermediates that can be distinguished by fluorescence methods (25.DeLucia A.M. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 10790-10803Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 26.Tippin B. Kobayashi S. Bertram J.G. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45360-45368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). DinB family members have been proposed to use all three mechanisms for creating single-base deletions, although only one, template slippage, requires a homopolymeric nucleotide run. In a study of Pol κ fidelity, Ohashi et al. (12.Ohashi E. Bebenek K. Matsuda T. Feaver W.J. Gerlach V.L. Friedberg E.C. Ohmori H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39678-39684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the enzyme generated single-base deletions at high rates (∼10−3). On repetitive sequences, Pol κ generated deletions at a rate that was 2–3-fold higher than on non-repetitive sequences, consistent with the use of template slippage. Ohashi et al. (12.Ohashi E. Bebenek K. Matsuda T. Feaver W.J. Gerlach V.L. Friedberg E.C. Ohmori H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39678-39684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) also concluded, based on the high deletion rate on non-repetitive sequences, that Pol κ additionally generates single base deletions either by misinsertion or dNTP-stabilized misalignment. Subsequent biochemical data obtained by Wolfle et al. (27.Wolfle W.T. Washington M.T. Prakash L. Prakash S. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2191-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Pol κ efficiently extends mispaired termini by a primer·template misalignment, supporting a misinsertion misalignment mechanism. Moreover, Wolfle et al. (27.Wolfle W.T. Washington M.T. Prakash L. Prakash S. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2191-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) were unable to observe chemical incorporation by Pol κ on substrates that can only be extended by dNTP-stabilized misalignment. An archeal family member, Dbh, creates pyrimidine deletions as much as 50% of the time on the sequence 5′-G-Py-Py; a template slippage mechanism is implicated by stopped-flow fluorescence experiments, which demonstrate the unstacking of a nucleotide on the template strand within the duplex region (13.Potapova O. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28157-28166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25.DeLucia A.M. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 10790-10803Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Structural data suggest that Dbh prefers to extrude a base within the DNA duplex that is three bases 3′ to the templating base (28.Wilson R.C. Pata J.D. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 767-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). By contrast, an earlier study concluded that DinB uses dNTP-stabilized misalignment when making single-base deletions (17.Kobayashi S. Valentine M.R. Pham P. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34198-34207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 26.Tippin B. Kobayashi S. Bertram J.G. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45360-45368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the authors reported that deletion formation required a run of at least 3 identical bases (26.Tippin B. Kobayashi S. Bertram J.G. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45360-45368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), an observation that is more consistent with template slippage used by other DinB family members. In the current study, we use a pre-steady-state fluorescence approach to demonstrate that E. coli DinB does indeed use a template slippage mechanism when making single-base deletions on substrates that contain homopolymeric nucleotide runs. We had previously shown that RecA and UmuD2 prevent DinB-mediated −1 frameshift mutagenesis both in vivo and in vitro and have suggested that mechanistic principles of this regulation may be conserved throughout evolution (29.Godoy V.G. Jarosz D.F. Simon S.M. Abyzov A. Ilyin V. Walker G.C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 1058-1070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). RecA and UmuD, like DinB, are transcriptionally up-regulated as part of the SOS response after DNA damage (for a review, see Ref. 30.Simmons L.A. Foti J.J. Cohen S.E. Walker G.C. Böck A.

Walker G.C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 1058-1070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We have previously described an in silico model for the DinB·RecA·UmuD2 complex in which the accessory proteins constrain the active site of DinB, preventing rearrangements necessary for the formation of deletion intermediates (29.Godoy V.G. Jarosz D.F. Simon S.M. Abyzov A. Ilyin V. Walker G.C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 1058-1070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In support of this model, we report that the addition of UmuD2 and RecA to our DinB reactions results in the inhibition of a non-covalent step within the template slippage pathway, consistent with the accessory proteins preventing the formation of slipped DNA intermediates on homopolymeric nucleotide runs. Native DinB was purified as described previously (6.Jarosz D.F. Godoy V.G. Delaney J.C. Essigmann J.M. Walker G.C. Nature. 2006; 439: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), except that the purified protein was stored in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. Native UmuD was purified as described previously (31.Simon S.M. Sousa F.J. Mohana-Borges R. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1152-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). RecA protein and T4-polynucleotide kinase were purchased from New England Biolabs. Synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased from the W. M. Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory (Yale Medical School) and were purified as described previously (13.Potapova O. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28157-28166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Substrate sequences are provided in supplemental Table S1. Ultrapure dNTPs were purchased from GE HealthCare. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Reactions containing 2-amino-purine (2-AP) substrates were excited at 310 nm, and emission was monitored at 360 nm at 22 °C using a Photon Technology International scanning spectrofluorometer. Emission of 1 μm annealed primer·template DNA, 6–15 μm DinB (as indicated) in DinB reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 4 mm MgCl2) was monitored for 50 s (65-μl total volume), and extension was then initiated by adding 2 μl of dNTP (3 mm final), and emission was monitored for an additional ≥100 s. When indicated, RecA and UmuD were added to the reaction in a DinB/RecA/UmuD2 ratio of 1:2:10. Stopped-flow experiments were performed at 22 °C on an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV spectrofluorometer. To measure dNTP incorporation, one drive syringe contained DNA and proteins in DinB reaction buffer, and the other contained dNTP and MgCl2 in DinB reaction buffer. Nucleotide incorporation was initiated by rapid mixing of the contents of each syringe (80 μl each). The final concentrations of components were 200 nm substrate DNA, 3 μm DinB, 6 μm RecA and 60 μm UmuD, 2 mm dNTP, and 2 mm additional MgCl2. The excitation wavelength for 2-AP substrates was 310 nm, and fluorescence emission was detected using a 345-nm long pass filter. Three individual traces of at least 10 s for each reaction were averaged and fitted to exponential equations using SigmaPlot (Systat Software) to determine a reaction rate. Representative fittings are shown in supplemental Fig. S1. Primer oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4-polynucleotide kinase and annealed to template oligonucleotide by heating to 95 °C for 1 min, followed by annealing at 37 °C for 45 min. Rapid quench-flow (KinTek Corp., model RQF-3) and manual quench kinetic measurements were performed under single-turnover conditions at 22 °C with final concentrations of 10 nm annealed primer·template DNA and 1 μm DinB in DinB reaction buffer. When indicated, 2 μm RecA and 20 μm UmuD final concentrations were added to the reaction. Reactions were initiated with dNTP solution (final concentration 1 mm dNTP in DinB reaction buffer with an additional 1 mm MgCl2). Reactions were quenched with 5 μl of quench buffer (80% formamide containing 100 mm EDTA with bromphenol blue and xylene cyanole dyes) and subsequently separated on a 20% denaturing gel. Bands were quantified using a Typhoon PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare), and then the rate of product formation was determined by fitting the data to single-exponential equations using SigmaPlot. We confirmed that these conditions correspond to single turnover by demonstrating that the reaction rate is unaffected when the DinB concentration is varied from 500 nm to 2 μm. The mechanism for deletion formation, or “base skipping,” 5The term “base-skipping” is used to describe the reaction that produces single-base deletions. Experimentally, a base-skipping reaction is initiated by providing a DinB·DNA binary complex with a single dNTP complementary to the base 5′ to the templating position. shown in Fig. 1 makes specific predictions as to which template base will become extrahelical. Therefore, the mechanism of DinB single-base deletion formation on homopolymeric runs can be inferred by monitoring the stacking of nucleotides within the template. 2-AP, a fluorescent adenosine analog, is an ideal reporter because it is sensitive to its local DNA environment; its fluorescence is quenched by base-stacking interactions with its neighbors but is substantially increased if it becomes unstacked from its 5′ and 3′ neighbors, in an extrahelical conformation (32.Rachofsky E.L. Osman R. Ross J.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 946-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Stopped-flow fluorescence assays using 2-AP as a reporter have been used previously to study the mechanism of single-base deletion formation by DinB and Dbh (17.Kobayashi S. Valentine M.R. Pham P. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34198-34207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 25.DeLucia A.M. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M.

Chem. 2004; 279: 45360-45368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We therefore designed several DNA substrates (supplemental Table S1; substrates shown in abbreviated form in FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5) with the 2-AP reporter either as the templating base (0-position; substrates I-3C, I-4C, and III-C) or base-paired with the primer terminus (−1-position; substrate II-G) within nucleotide runs of varying lengths to deduce the DNA stacking environment of these positions. With 2-AP at the 0-position, we expect that the template slippage pathway will result in a prechemistry fluorescence decrease when 2-AP slips backward and base-pairs with the terminal nucleotide of the primer. In contrast, the dNTP-stabilized misalignment mechanism will give a fluorescence increase as the 2-AP becomes unstacked from its neighbors. With 2-AP at the −1-position, opposite the primer terminus, the template slippage pathway predicts a prechemistry fluorescence increase as the 2-AP loses its base-pairing partner, whereas dNTP-stabilized misalignment should result in little or no fluorescence change. The fluorescence changes associated with the misinsertion-misalignment pathway (Fig. 1) are likely to be similar to those predicted for dNTP-stabilized misalignment, but consideration of reaction rates, as described below, clearly rules out this pathway.FIGURE 4Time-based fluorescence emission using substrates III-C and III-G suggests template slippage. A, the fluorescence of 2-AP (at 360 nm) in a DinB·III-C binary complex was recorded for 50 s, at which time a reaction was initiated by the addition of the dNTP required for base skipping (red trace), the dNTP appropriate for error-free incorporation (green trace), or a buffer control (black trace), and the fluorescence was recorded for an additional 4 min. The observed fluorescence decrease for the base-skipping reaction compared with the buffer control is consistent with template slippage. B, the misinsertion control reaction (blue) was initiated by the addition of dGTP to a DinB·III-G complex. The absence of a fluorescence change compared with the buffer control (black) suggests a lack of incorporation. The final concentrations of reaction components shown in A and B were 1 μm DNA, 15 μm DinB, and 3 mm dNTP.

A stopped-flow experiment was carried out as in Fig. 2 except that the primer strand of the DNA substrate was dideoxy-terminated. The structure of the primer·template terminus with incoming dNTP is shown, appropriately colored (Ap, 2-AP; *, dideoxy). A and B, a single fluorescence decrease is observed for both base-skipping (red) and error-free (green) reactions on substrates I-3C(dd) and I-4C(dd) with rates similar to their parental I-3C and I-4C substrates (Table 1 and supplemental Table S2).

The fluorescence changes were recorded after mixing a binary complex of DinB bound to the indicated substrate with either the dNTP required for base-skipping, error-free incorporation or misinsertion. For each trace, the relevant DNA sequence at the primer terminus is shown along with the appropriately colored incoming dNTP (Ap, 2-AP; a crossed out arrow indicates the absence of incorporation; full sequences of the DNA substrates are given in supplemental Table S1). A and B, for substrates I-3C and I-4C with 2-AP as the templating base, a rapid fluorescence decrease is observed for both the base-skipping (red) and error-free (green) reactions compared with the buffer control (black), consistent with template slippage. D, for substrate II-G (2AP (−1)) the base-skipping reaction (red) results in a rapid fluorescence increase, which, like substrates I-3C and I-4C, is consistent with template slippage. The error-free reaction (green) resulted in a decrease. C and E, no fluorescence changes are observed for the misinsertion control reactions (blue traces) using substrates I-4G and II-C when compared with a buffer control. The data were plotted on a logarithmic time scale so as to show early fluorescence changes. See Table 1 and supplemental Table S2 for the rate data obtained from these experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In preparation for our studies on the effects of UmuD and RecA, we characterized the action of DinB on substrates containing 2-AP within homopolymeric nucleotide runs. We used stopped-flow fluorescence to observe the fluorescence changes that take place when a DinB·DNA binary complex is mixed with a dNTP complementary to the base 5′ to the templating position (base-skipping reaction; red traces) (Fig. 2). The fluorescence changes observed were those predicted by the template slippage mechanism: a decrease with 2-AP at the 0-position (duplexes I-3C and I-4C; Fig. 2, A and B) and an increase with 2-AP at the −1-position (duplex II-G; Fig. 2D). Fitting of the stopped-flow fluorescence traces for the base-skipping reactions gave similar rates (∼45 s−1; Table 1) of the initial fluorescence change for all of these substrates, suggesting that these rates are limited by the same process and are not influenced significantly by the length of the homopolymeric run involved in the slippage process. Moreover, the initial fluorescence change must correspond to a prechemistry step because its rate (∼45 s−1) is ≥1000-fold faster than the corresponding dNTP incorporation rate (∼3 × 10−2 s−1) measured by chemical quench. The existence of an early non-covalent step was corroborated by stopped-flow experiments using substrates I-3C(dd), I-4C(dd), and II-G(dd), which are analogous to the parental substrates except that the primer strand has a 2′,3′-dideoxynucleotide and thus cannot form a phosphodiester bond with the incoming nucleotide. When mixed with the dNTP appropriate for the base-skipping reaction, all three dideoxy-terminated substrates resulted in fluorescence changes whose amplitudes and rates were similar to the major change observed with the corresponding deoxy-terminated substrates (Fig. 3, A–C, and Table 1). Thus, base-skipping reactions utilizing deoxy- and dideoxy-terminated substrates containing homopolymeric nucleotide runs result in rapid fluorescence changes consistent with the extrusion of a base within the duplex region prior to chemistry.TABLE 1Rates of chemical incorporation and fluorescence changes catalyzed by DinBa The relevant sequence surrounding the primer terminus is shown.

https://openalex.org/W2002089682,"The cytokine interleukin-3 (IL-3) is a critical regulator of inflammation and immune responses in mammals. IL-3 exerts its effects on target cells via receptors comprising an IL-3-specific alpha-subunit and common beta-subunit (beta c; shared with IL-5 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) or a beta-subunit that specifically binds IL-3 (beta(IL-3); present in mice but not humans). We recently identified two splice variants of the alpha-subunit of the IL-3 receptor (IL-3R alpha) that are relevant to hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation or proliferation: the full length (""SP1"" isoform) and a novel isoform (denoted ""SP2"") lacking the N-terminal Ig-like domain. Although our studies demonstrated that each mouse IL-3 (mIL-3) R alpha isoform can direct mIL-3 binding to two distinct sites on the beta(IL-3) subunit, it has remained unclear which residues in mIL-3 itself are critical to the two modes of beta(IL-3) recognition and whether the human IL-3R alpha SP1 and SP2 orthologs similarly instruct human IL-3 binding to two distinct sites on the human beta c subunit. Herein, we describe the identification of residues clustering around the highly conserved A-helix residue, Glu(23), in the mIL-3 A- and C-helices as critical for receptor binding and growth stimulation via the beta(IL-3) and mIL-3R alpha SP2 subunits, whereas an overlapping cluster was required for binding and activation of beta(IL-3) in the presence of mIL-3R alpha SP1. Similarly, our studies of human IL-3 indicate that two different modes of beta c binding are utilized in the presence of the hIL-3R alpha SP1 or SP2 isoforms, suggesting a possible conserved mechanism by which the relative orientations of receptor subunits are modulated to achieve distinct signaling outcomes."
