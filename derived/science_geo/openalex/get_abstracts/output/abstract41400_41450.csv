https://openalex.org/W2087184465,"A large collection of good genetic markers is needed to map the genes that cause human genetic diseases. Although nearly 400 polymorphic DNA markers for human chromosomes have been described, the majority have only two alleles and are thus uninformative for analysis of genetic linkage in many families. A few known marker systems, however, detect loci that respond to restriction enzyme cleavage by producing a fragment that can have many different lengths. This polymorphism is due to variation in the number of tandem repeats of a short DNA sequence. Because most individuals will be heterozygous at such loci, these markers will provide linkage information in almost all families. Ten oligomeric sequences derived from the tandem repeat regions of the myoglobin gene, the zeta-globin pseudogene, the insulin gene, and the X-gene region of hepatitis B virus, were used to develop a series of single-copy probes. These probes revealed new, highly polymorphic genetic loci whose allele sizes reflected variation in the number of tandem repeats."
https://openalex.org/W2106352950,"Vascular endothelium plays an active role in preventing blood clot formation in vivo. One mechanism by which prevention is achieved involves a cell surface thrombin-binding protein, thrombomodulin, which converts thrombin into a protein C activator. Activated protein C then functions as an anticoagulant by inactivating two regulatory proteins of the coagulation system, factors Va and VIIIa. The physiological relevance of the protein C anticoagulant pathway is demonstrated by the identification of homozygous protein C-deficient infants with severe thrombotic complications. Recent studies suggest that this pathway provides a link between inflammation and coagulation."
https://openalex.org/W2072108911,"Vitamin D3 receptors are intracellular proteins that mediate the nuclear action of the active metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3]. Two receptor-specific monoclonal antibodies were used to recover the complementary DNA (cDNA) of this regulatory protein from a chicken intestinal lambda gt11 cDNA expression library. The amino acid sequences that were deduced from this cDNA revealed a highly conserved cysteine-rich region that displayed homology with a domain characteristic of other steroid receptors and with the gag-erbA oncogene product of avian erythroblastosis virus. RNA selected via hybridization with this DNA sequence directed the cell-free synthesis of immunoprecipitable vitamin D3 receptor. Northern blot analysis of polyadenylated RNA with these cDNA probes revealed two vitamin D receptor messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of 2.6 and 3.2 kilobases in receptor-containing chicken tissues and a major cross-hybridizing receptor mRNA species of 4.2 kilobases in mouse 3T6 fibroblasts. The 4.2-kilobase species was substantially increased by prior exposure of 3T6 cells to 1,25(OH)2D3. This cDNA represents perhaps the rarest mRNA cloned to date in eukaryotes, as well as the first receptor sequence described for an authentic vitamin."

https://openalex.org/W1533713329,"Two separate genes encode fast-twitch and slow-twitch/cardiac muscle forms of the Ca2+ ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum. Full length Ca2+ ATPase clones have been isolated from adult rabbit fast-twitch, slow-twitch, and cardiac muscles. Segments of these clones containing unique sequences have been used as probes to study developmental changes in Ca2+ ATPase transcripts. The fast-twitch Ca2+ ATPase transcript undergoes developmentally regulated alternative splicing in which a penultimate 42-base pair exon is retained in the adult transcript but is excised in the neonatal transcript. This additional exon shifts the exon encoding the neonatal carboxyl-terminal sequence, -Asp-Pro-Glu-Asp-Glu-Arg-Arg-Lys (Brandl, C. J., Green, N. M., Korczak, B., and MacLennan, D. H. (1986) Cell 44, 597-607) into a nontranslated region and results in the expression of an adult isoform with a carboxyl-terminal -Gly. The neonatal form of the fast-twitch Ca2+ ATPase represents 72% of the fast-twitch Ca2+ ATPase transcripts just prior to birth but only 17% by 14 days of age and 4% in adult fast-twitch muscle. Adult slow-twitch, adult cardiac, and neonatal skeletal muscles express an identical Ca2+ATPase mRNA transcript which is distinct from either of the fast-twitch forms. The slow-twitch/cardiac Ca2+ ATPase is the predominant form expressed in late fetal and early neonatal rabbit skeletal muscle, but this form is lost as the skeletal muscle differentiates into a fast-twitch state. Three or more alternative polyadenylation signals exist for this mRNA in all tissues with the most 3' signal predominating."
https://openalex.org/W2020790836,"Elevation of glucose transport is an alteration common to most virally induced tumors. Rat fibroblasts transformed with wild-type or a temperature-sensitive Fujinami sarcoma virus (FSV) were studied in order to determine the mechanisms underlying the increased transport. Five- to tenfold increases in total cellular glucose transporter protein in response to transformation were accompanied by similar increases in transporter messenger RNA levels. This, in turn, was preceded by an absolute increase in the rate of glucose transporter gene transcription within 30 minutes after shift of the temperature-sensitive FSV-transformed cells to the permissive temperature. The transporter messenger RNA levels in transformed fibroblasts were higher than those found in proliferating cells maintained at the nonpermissive temperature. The activation of transporter gene transcription by transformation represents one of the earliest known effects of oncogenesis on the expression of a gene encoding a protein of well-defined function."
https://openalex.org/W1605064581,"Two general transcription factors (IIE and IIB) (TF) were purified from HeLa cell nuclear extracts and shown to be absolutely required, along with two additional factors (IIA and IID) and RNA polymerase II, for specific transcription initiation at the adenovirus major late promoter. TFIIB and TFIIE were also required, in addition to TFIIA, TFIID, RNA polymerase II, and the adenovirus 2 major late promoter, for the formation of a (preinitiation) complex that could initiate transcription (upon addition of nucleoside triphosphates) in the presence of heparin concentrations which inhibited the action of unbound factors. Glycerol gradient analyses indicated independent interactions of TFIIE with TFIIB and with the purified RNA polymerase II, but not with RNA polymerase III. Transcription factors IIB and IIE were also shown to be required for specific initiation of transcription from several cellular and viral class II promoters."
https://openalex.org/W1488128956,"The present study was undertaken to determine the ability of protein kinase C and protein kinase A to directly phosphorylate the purified alpha 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors (AR). Both the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A and the protein kinase C, purified from bovine heart and pig brain, respectively, are able to phosphorylate the purified alpha 1-AR from DDT1 MF-2 smooth muscle cells. Occupancy of the receptor by an alpha 1 agonist, norepinephrine (100 microM), increases the rate of phosphorylation by protein kinase C but not by protein kinase A. The maximum stoichiometry of phosphorylation obtained is not affected by the agonist and reached 3 mol of PO4/mol of receptor for protein kinase C and 1 mol of PO4/mol of receptor for protein kinase A. The phosphopeptide maps of the trypsinized alpha 1-AR phosphorylated by each kinase differ drastically. The beta 2-AR purified from hamster lungs can also be phosphorylated by the two kinases. In contrast to the alpha 1-AR, the occupancy of the beta 2-AR by the agonist isoproterenol (20 microM) increases the rate of phosphorylation of the beta 2-AR by protein kinase A but not by protein kinase C. The maximum amount of phosphate incorporated into the receptor is not affected in either case by the agonist and reaches 1 mol of PO4/mol of receptor with protein kinase A and 0.4 mol of PO4/mol of receptor with protein kinase C. The phosphopeptide maps of the trypsinized receptor phosphorylated by either kinase reveal similar profiles. Thus, both alpha 1-AR and beta 2-AR are substrates for protein kinase A and protein kinase C. Agonist occupancy of the two receptors facilitates their phosphorylation only by the protein kinase coupled to their own signal transduction pathway. These observations suggest that feedback and cross-system phosphorylation may represent distinct and differently regulated mechanisms of modulation of receptor function."
https://openalex.org/W1575812822,"Continuous exposure of DDT1 MF-2 smooth muscle cells to 10-100 microM norepinephrine results in a dramatic attenuation of the ability of norepinephrine to stimulate inositol phospholipid hydrolysis via alpha 1-adrenergic receptors (alpha 1-AR). In addition to the functional desensitization, norepinephrine exposure also reduces the number of accessible cell surface alpha 1-AR as assayed by [3H]prazosin binding at 4 degrees C. Desensitization of the cells with norepinephrine results in an increase in the phosphorylation of the Mr 80,000 alpha 1-AR ligand binding peptide (2.4 +/- 0.2 mol of 32P per mol of alpha 1-AR; n = 5) when compared to control cells (1.1 +/- 0.1 mol of 32P per mol of alpha 1-AR; n = 5). The time courses of these three processes are all comparable being half-maximal within 1-2 min. These norepinephrine-promoted effects can be prevented by the alpha 1-AR receptor antagonist phentolamine indicating that they are mediated via the alpha 1-AR. Treatment of cells with the vasoactive peptide bradykinin (10 microM) induces desensitization of alpha 1-AR function similar to that induced by tumor-promoting phorbol ester treatment (Leeb-Lundberg, L. M. F., Cotecchia, S., Lomasney, J. W., DeBernardis, J. F., Lefkowitz, R. J., and Caron, M. G. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82, 5651-5655). Both treatments also result in phosphorylation of the alpha 1-AR, with stoichiometries of 1.7 +/- 0.1 (bradykinin; n = 5) and 3.6 +/- 0.1 (PMA; n = 5) mol of 32P/mol of alpha 1-AR. However, neither phorbol esters nor bradykinin reduce the number of accessible cell surface alpha 1-AR. Similar phosphopeptide maps are obtained from tryptic phosphopeptides generated from phosphorylated alpha 1-AR derived from cells treated with norepinephrine, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and bradykinin. Phosphoamino acid analysis reveals that the various agents induce phosphorylation on both serine and threonine residues. Thus, phosphorylation of receptors linked to the inositol phospholipid/Ca2+ signaling pathway may represent an important mechanism of regulation of receptor responsiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2074610333,"Neoplastic tumors of the ocular lens of vertebrates do not naturally occur. Transgenic mice carrying a hybrid gene comprising the murine alpha A-crystallin promoter (-366 to +46) fused to the coding sequence of the SV40 T antigens developed lens tumors, which obliterated the eye cavity and even invaded neighboring tissue, thus establishing that the lens is not refractive to oncogenesis. Large-T antigen was detected early in lens development; it elicited morphological changes and specifically interfered with differentiation of lens fiber cells. Both alpha- and beta-crystallins persisted in many of the lens tumor cells, while gamma-crystallin was selectively reduced. Accessibility, characteristic morphology, and defined protein markers make this transparent epithelial eye tissue a potentially useful system for testing tumorigenicity of oncogenes and for studying malignant transformation from its inception until death of the animal."

https://openalex.org/W1603483234,"The murine T lymphoma line, LBRM-33 1A5, requires synergistic signals delivered by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and interleukin 1 (IL1) for activation to high level interleukin 2 production. The activation signals provided by PHA and IL1 were replaced by the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin, and the phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), respectively. These observations supported a two-signal model for T cell activation involving increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) (signal 1) and activation of protein kinase C (signal 2) as necessary and sufficient events. However, biochemical analyses revealed that additional signals were involved in the activation of LBRM-33 cells by both receptor-dependent and -independent mediators. Both signal 1-type mediators, PHA and ionomycin, exerted pleiotropic effects at the concentrations required for synergy with signal 2-type mediators (IL1, TPA). Within 1-2 min of addition, PHA stimulated phospholipid turnover, including hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, Ca2+ mobilization, and protein kinase C activation. The [Ca2+]i increase induced by PHA was due to influx from both intracellular and extracellular Ca2+ pools. Similarly, ionomycin increased phospholipid turnover, [Ca2+]i, and directly affected protein kinase C activity in LBRM-33 cells. In contrast, the signal 2-type mediators, TPA and IL1, appeared to act by distinct intracellular mechanisms. TPA induced a protracted association of cellular protein kinase C with the plasma membrane, consistent with the two-signal activation model. Furthermore, acute TPA treatment inhibited PHA-stimulated inositol phosphate release and Ca2+ mobilization, suggesting that this mediator partially antagonized signal 1 delivery. IL1, in contrast, neither activated protein kinase C directly nor did it positively modulate the coupling of signal 1-type mediators to [Ca2+]i or protein kinase C via the phosphoinositide pathway. The intracellular signal delivered by IL1 is, therefore, generated through a mechanism distinct from or distal to the activation of protein kinase C. These studies indicate that the two-signal hypothesis, in its simplest form, is inadequate to explain the signals required for the initiation of IL1-dependent T cell activation."

https://openalex.org/W1538778697,"Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CO dehydrogenase) from Rhodospirillum rubrum was shown to be an oxygen-sensitive, nickel, iron-sulfur, and zinc-containing protein that was induced by carbon monoxide (CO). The enzyme was purified 212-fold by heat treatment, ion-exchange, and hydroxylapatite chromatography and preparative gel electrophoresis. The purified protein, active as a monomer of Mr = 61,800, existed in two forms that were comprised of identical polypeptides and differed in metal content. Form 1 comprised 90% of the final activity, had a specific activity of 1,079 mumol CO oxidized per min-1 mg-1, and contained 7 iron, 6 sulfur, 0.6 nickel, and 0.4 zinc/monomer. Form 2 had a lower specific activity (694 mumol CO min-1 mg-1) and contained 9 iron, 8 sulfur, 1.4 nickel, and 0.8 zinc/monomer. Reduction of either form by CO or dithionite resulted in identical, rhombic ESR spectra with g-values of 2.042, 1.939, and 1.888. Form 2 exhibited a 2-fold higher integrated spin concentration, supporting the conclusion that it contained an additional reducible metal center(s). Cells grown in the presence of 63NiCl2 incorporated 63Ni into CO dehydrogenase. Although nickel was clearly present in the protein, it was not ESR-active under any conditions tested. R. rubrum CO dehydrogenase was antigenically distinct from the CO dehydrogenases from Methanosarcina barkeri and Clostridium thermoaceticum."
https://openalex.org/W1637003823,"Partial amino acid sequence of human myeloperoxidase was determined, and a 41-base oligonucleotide containing deoxyinosines at four positions was chemically synthesized. By using the oligonucleotide as a probe, cDNA clones for human myeloperoxidase were isolated from a cDNA library constructed with mRNA from human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. One of the clones containing a 2.6-kilobase insert was subjected to nucleotide sequence analysis. The sequence was found to contain an open reading frame, 2,235 nucleotides coding for a protein of 745 amino acids with a calculated Mr of 83,868. The heavy chain of myeloperoxidase, consisting of 467 amino acids, was located on the COOH terminus half of the protein. The RNA specified by the cDNA was prepared using SP6 RNA polymerase and translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates, and the product was identified as human myeloperoxidase by immunoprecipitation with rabbit anti-human myeloperoxidase antibody. By Northern hybridization analysis of RNA from leukemic cells, it was shown that myeloperoxidase mRNA is abundantly expressed in human promyelocytic HL-60 and mouse myeloid leukemia NFS-60 cells. Furthermore, the results of Southern hybridization analysis of human genomic DNA suggest that there are one or two genes for myeloperoxidase in the human haploid genome."
https://openalex.org/W1509219107,"Neuropeptide Y, a major neuropeptide and potent vasoconstrictor, inhibited isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in cultured rat atrial cells as well as in atrial membranes. Prior treatment of the cells with pertussis toxin blocked the inhibitory action of neuropeptide Y. Pertussis toxin is known to uncouple the receptors for other inhibitors of adenylate cyclase by ADP-ribosylation of the alpha-subunit of Gi, the inhibitory guanine nucleotide binding component of adenylate cyclase. The toxin specifically catalyzed the ADP-ribosylation of a 41-kilodalton atrial membrane protein which corresponded to the Gi subunit. These results suggest that neuropeptide Y may mediate some of its physiological effects through specific receptors linked to the inhibitory pathway of adenylate cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W2140014571,"A gene encoding the yeast ubiquitin was chemically synthesized and expressed in yeast under regulatory control of the copper metallothionein (CUP1) promoter. The gene was assembled in a one-step ligation reaction from eight oligonucleotide fragments ranging in length from 50 to 64 nucleotides. To facilitate mutagenesis and gene fusion studies, eight unique 6-base-cutting restriction enzyme sites were placed in the reading frame which did not alter the encoded protein sequence or force the utilization of rare codons. In a copper-resistant yeast strain (CUP1r), expression of the gene was induced by copper to approximately 5% of the total yeast proteins, as determined by Coomassie-stained polyacrylamide gels. The protein, purified from yeast, reacted with ubiquitin-specific antibodies and was found to be biologically active in supporting ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2045411756,"Mycoplasma genetics has been limited by a lack of genetic tools such as selectable markers, methods to transfer DNA, and suitable vectors for cloning. Studies were undertaken to examine the potential of using the streptococcal transposon Tn916 as a mycoplasma genetic tool. The Escherichia coli plasmid pAM120, which contains Tn916, was transformed into Acholeplasma laidlawii and Mycoplasma pulmonis. Transposition of Tn916 into the mycoplasma chromosome apparently occurred by an excision-insertion mechanism. This example shows that newly introduced DNA from other bacteria can be successfully expressed in mycoplasma and that Tn916 should serve as a powerful genetic tool for the study of mycoplasmas."
https://openalex.org/W129159244,"We previously reported (Berlot, C. H., Spudich, J. A., and Devreotes, P. N. (1985) Cell 43, 307-314) that cAMP stimulation of chemotactically competent Dictyostelium amoebae causes transient increases in phosphorylation of the myosin heavy chain and 18,000-dalton light chain in vivo and in vitro. In this report we investigate the mechanisms involved in these changes in phosphorylation. In the case of heavy chain phosphorylation, the amount of substrate available for phosphorylation appears to be the major factor regulating the in vitro phosphorylation rate. Almost all heavy chain kinase activity is insoluble in Triton X-100, and the increase in the heavy chain phosphorylation rate in vitro parallels an increase in Triton insolubility of myosin. Changes in heavy chain phosphatase activity are not involved in the changes in the in vitro phosphorylation rate. In the case of light chain phosphorylation, increases in the vitro phosphorylation rate occur under conditions where the amount of substrate available for phosphorylation is constant and phosphatase activity is undetectable, implicating light chain kinase activation as the means of regulation. The specificity of the myosin kinases operating in vivo and in vitro was explored using phosphoamino acid and chymotryptic phosphopeptide analysis. The light chain is phosphorylated on serine both in vivo and in vitro, and phosphopeptide maps of the light chain phosphorylated in vivo and in vitro are indistinguishable. In the case of the heavy chain, both serine and threonine are phosphorylated in vivo and in vitro, although the cAMP-stimulated increases in phosphorylation occur primarily on threonine. Phosphopeptide maps of the heavy chain show that the peptides phosphorylated in vitro represent a major subset of those phosphorylated in vivo. The kinetics of the transient increases in myosin phosphorylation rates observed in vitro can be predicted quantitatively from the in vivo myosin phosphorylation data assuming that there is a constant phosphatase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1999854058,"The thymidine kinase (tk) promoter of herpes simplex virus includes an octanucleotide sequence motif (ATTTGCAT) that is also an essential component of immunoglobulin kappa gene promoters. In the absence of an enhancer, tk promoter derivatives that contain this element support a higher rate of transcription than those that lack it. The action of the kappa enhancer augments that of the octanucleotide in B lymphoid cells; when both elements are present, tk promoter activity is increased by more than an order of magnitude. In contrast, the presence of the octanucleotide in this promoter markedly reduces its response to a nonimmunoglobulin enhancer. These results suggest that the octanucleotide may mediate a selective interaction among promoters and enhancers."
https://openalex.org/W1495524572,"Botulinum neurotoxin (NT) is synthesized by Clostridium botulinum in any of seven antigenically distinct forms called types A-G. NT, when fully active, is a dichain protein, composed of two polypeptides, a heavy (H) and a light (L) chain (approximately 100,000 and approximately 50,000 Da, respectively) that are held together by noncovalent bonds and at least one disulfide bond. Two types of dichain NT, A and B, and their respective H and L chains were applied to nerve-muscle (NM) preparations (phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm of the mouse), in order to develop a broader, comparative understanding of the neuroparalytic actions of NT types. It was found that the paralysis induced by dichain NT was delayed or antagonized if NM preparations were incubated with isolated and purified H chain prior to, or during, incubation with the parent, dichain NT. NM preparations preincubated with H chain and then washed free of unbound H chain became paralyzed after subsequent incubation with L chain. Paralysis did not occur if NM preparations were incubated first with L chain, washed, and then incubated with H chain. These observations suggest that the H chain binds with specific sites on the nerve terminal. This binding appears to permit the L chain, or some combination of the L and H chain, to bring about neuroparalysis through a mechanism very similar to that of the parent, dichain NT."
https://openalex.org/W1603342913,"A colony autoradiographic assay for the sn-1,2-diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was developed. Twenty-two mutants defective in cholinephosphotransferase activity were isolated. Genetic analysis revealed that all of these mutations were recessive, and three complementation groups were identified. The cholinephosphotransferase activities in membranes prepared from cpt1 mutants were reduced 2-10-fold compared to wild-type activity. The cholinephosphotransferase activities of two cpt1 isolates differed from wild-type activity with respect to their apparent KM for CDP-choline. The residual cholinephosphotransferase activities of cpt1 isolates were more sensitive to inhibition by CMP than the wild-type activity. The CPT1 gene was cloned by genetic complementation of cpt1 using a yeast genomic library. In strains transformed with the CPT1-bearing plasmid, a 5-fold overproduction of cholinephosphotransferase activity with wild-type kinetic properties was observed. The CPT1 gene was localized to a 1.2-2.4-kilobase region of DNA by transposon Tn5 mutagenesis and deletion mapping. An insertional mutant of the CPT1 gene was constructed and introduced into the chromosome by integrative transformation. The resulting cpt insertional mutant fell into the cpt1 complementation group. The cholinephosphotransferase activity in membranes prepared from the cpt1 insertional mutant was reduced 5-fold and exhibited CMP sensitivity. The sn-1,2-diacylglycerol ethanolaminephosphotransferase activities in membranes from all of the cpt1 isolates including the insertional mutant were normal. The data indicate that the cloned CPT1 gene represents the yeast cholinephosphotransferase structural gene, that the yeast choline- and ethanolaminephosphotransferase activities are encoded by different genes, and that the CPT1 gene is nonessential for growth."
https://openalex.org/W1511088845,"Abstract Nuclear respiratory deficient mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae impaired in mitochondrial protein synthesis have been screened for lesions in ribosomal protein constituents. Two mutants, each representative of separate pet complementation group, have been analyzed. One of the mutants, E795, was found to have altered mitochondrial ribosomes as evidenced by the absence of some ribosomal proteins. The second mutant studied, C167, appeared to have more grossly altered ribosomes that could not be isolated by standard preparative procedures. In addition to being defective in mitochondrial protein synthesis, the mutants exhibit an absence of a and type cytochromes, are partially blocked in processing of intron bI4 of the apocytochrome b gene, have reduced levels of mitochondrial 15 S rRNA, and convert to rho- and rho 0 mutants at high frequency. The wild type genes MRP1 and MRP2 were cloned by transformation of the pet mutations in E795 and C167, respectively, with recombinant plasmid library of wild type yeast genomic DNA. MRP1 codes for basic protein of 37 kDa with no significant homology to any known prokaryotic or eukaryotic ribosomal protein. MRP2 codes for 14-kDa polypeptide homologous to protein S14 of the Escherichia coli small ribosomal subunit and to chloroplast-encoded component of chloroplast ribosomes. The levels of MRP1 and MRP2 mRNAs were examined in glucose-repressed cells and in cells undergoing adaptation to aerobic metabolism of ethanol. The steady state concentrations of the mRNAs increased during the first 3 h of derepression, indicating that expression of these mitochondrial ribosomal protein genes is transcriptionally regulated by glucose in fashion analogous to respiratory carriers such as cytochrome c."
https://openalex.org/W1523719592,"The effects of ACTH or dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP) on the synthesis of sterol carrier protein-2 (SCP2) have been studied in rat adrenocortical cells in monolayer culture. Radiolabeling of total cellular proteins with [35S]methionine and immunoprecipitation with antibodies directed against rat liver SCP2, followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography, showed a 3-4-fold increase in the rate of synthesis of SCP2 in cells treated for 48 h with ACTH (1 microM) or Bt2cAMP (0.1 mM). The induction of SCP2 synthesis depended upon the concentrations of ACTH or Bt2cAMP with an ED50 of 8 and 100 nM, respectively, and increased linearly with time between 12 and 48 h of treatment. Immunoprecipitation of SCP2 synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte in vitro translation system programmed with RNA isolated from cells treated with ACTH or Bt2cAMP revealed increased synthesis of SCP2 compared to RNA from control cells. The immunoprecipitable rat adrenal SCP2, synthesized in a cell-free translation system, showed mobility corresponding to Mr of 14,400 upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and was clearly larger than immunodetectable SCP2 synthesized in cultured adrenal cells (Mr = 11,300). The electrophoretic mobilities of rat liver SCP2 synthesized in cultured cells and in a cell-free translation system were the same as the respective forms from rat adrenal. It is concluded that the synthesis of SCP2 in rat adrenocortical cells is induced by ACTH and that the induction is mediated by cAMP and may involve increased levels of translatable mRNA encoding a higher molecular weight precursor form of SCP2, which presumably undergoes post-translational processing yielding the mature form."
https://openalex.org/W1571288613,"The receptor for platelet-derived growth factor has been purified to homogeneity on a large scale from porcine uterus. The purification procedure utilizes solubilization of uterus membranes by Triton X-100, followed by sequential chromatographies on wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose, fast protein liquid chromatography Mono-Q, and anti-phosphotyrosine-Sepharose. About 160 micrograms of homogeneous and functionally active 170-kDa receptor could be purified from 5 kg of uterus tissue. The pure receptor responded to platelet-derived growth factor stimulation by autophosphorylation, indicating that the receptor has a kinase domain as an integral part of the molecule. A rabbit antiserum was produced against the pure receptor, which specifically recognizes the intact 170-kDa receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1659256330,"This study addresses the function of multisite phosphorylation of phosphorylase kinase catalyzed by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Using subunit specific protein phosphatases (the polycation-stimulated and ATP-, Mg2+-dependent enzymes), we show that the degree of phosphorylation of both the alpha and beta subunits modulates phosphorylase kinase activity. beta subunit phosphorylation is essential for activation and, independent of the degree of alpha subunit phosphorylation, enzyme fully dephosphorylated in the beta subunit is completely inactivated. alpha Subunit phosphorylation does, however, also regulate activity, and enzyme fully or partially phosphorylated in the beta subunit is inactivated as a consequence of alpha subunit dephosphorylation. The extent of inactivation caused by alpha subunit dephosphorylation is linearly dependent on the phosphorylation state of the beta subunit. Three peptide sites on the alpha subunit are phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase; the site primarily affecting activity is the one that is initially phosphorylated. These data provide evidence that subunit interrelationships play an important role in the regulation of phosphorylase kinase by multisite phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1571368673,"Cloned cDNAs encoding mannose-binding proteins isolated from rat liver have been used to isolate one of the genes encoding this group of proteins. This gene, which encodes the minor form of binding protein (designated MBP-A), has been characterized by sequence analysis. The protein-coding portion of the mRNA for the MBP-A is encoded by four exons separated by three introns. The NH2-terminal, collagen-like portion of the protein is encoded by the first two exons. These exons resemble the exons found in the genes for nonfibrillar collagens in that the intron which divides them is inserted between the first two bases of a glycine codon and the exons do not have the 54- or 108-base pair lengths characteristic of fibrillar collagen genes. The carbohydrate-binding portion of MBP-A is encoded by the remaining two exons. This portion of the protein is homologous to the carbohydrate-recognition domain of the hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor, which is encoded by four exons. It appears that the three COOH-terminal exons of the asialoglycoprotein receptor gene have been fused into a single exon in the MBP-A gene. The organization of the MBP-A gene is very similar to the arrangement of the gene encoding the highly homologous pulmonary surfactant apoprotein, although one of the intron positions is shifted by a single amino acid. The 3' end of a mannose-binding protein pseudogene has also been characterized."
https://openalex.org/W1611066397,"The role of human plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) in the cellular uptake of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesteryl ester (CE) was studied in a liver tumor cell line (HepG2). When HepG2 cells were incubated with [3H]cholesteryl ester-labeled HDL3 in the presence of increasing concentrations of CETP there was a progressive increase in cell-associated radioactivity to levels that were 2.8 times control. The CETP-dependent uptake of HDL-CE was found to be saturated by increasing concentrations of both CETP and HDL. The CETP-dependent uptake of CE radioactivity increased continuously during an 18-h incubation. In contrast to the effect on cholesteryl ester, CETP failed to enhance HDL protein cell association or degradation. Enhanced uptake of HDL cholesteryl ester was shown for the d greater than 1.21 g/ml fraction of human plasma, partially purified CETP, and CETP purified to homogeneity, but not for the d greater than 1.21 g/ml fraction of rat plasma which lacks cholesteryl ester transfer activity. HDL cholesteryl ester entering the cell under the influence of CETP was largely degraded to free cholesterol by a process inhibitable by chloroquine. CETP enhanced uptake of HDL [3H]CE in cultured smooth muscle cells and to a lesser extent in fibroblasts but did not significantly influence uptake in endothelial cells or J774 macrophages. These experiments show that, in addition to its known role in enhancing the exchange of CE between lipoproteins, plasma CETP can facilitate the in vitro selective transfer of CE from HDL into certain cells."
https://openalex.org/W1497032393,"The mechanism of HCO3- translocation across the proximal tubule basolateral membrane was investigated by testing for Na+-HCO3- cotransport using isolated membrane vesicles purified from rat renal cortex. As indicated by 22Na+ uptake, imposing an inwardly directed HCO3- concentration gradient induced the transient concentrative accumulation of intravesicular Na+. The stimulation of basolateral membrane vesicle Na+ uptake was specifically HCO3(-)-dependent as only basolateral membrane-independent Na+ uptake was stimulated by an imposed hydroxyl gradient in the absence of HCO3-. No evidence for Na+-HCO3- cotransport was detected in brush border membrane vesicles. Charging the vesicle interior positive stimulated net intravesicular Na+ accumulation in the absence of other driving forces via a HCO3(-)-dependent pathway indicating the flow of negative charge accompanies the Na+-HCO3- cotransport event. Among the anion transport inhibitors tested, 4-4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid demonstrated the strongest inhibitor potency at 1 mM. The Na+-coupled transport inhibitor harmaline also markedly inhibited HCO3- gradient-driven Na+ influx. A role for carbonic anhydrase in the mechanism of Na+-HCO3- cotransport is suggested by the modest inhibition of HCO3- gradient driven Na+ influx caused by acetazolamide. The imposition of Cl- concentration gradients had a marked effect on HCO3- gradient-driven Na+ influx which was furosemide-sensitive and consistent with the operation of a Na+-HCO3- for Cl- exchange mechanism. The results of this study provide evidence for an electrogenic Na+-HCO3- cotransporter in basolateral but not microvillar membrane vesicles isolated from rat kidney cortex. The possible existence of an additional basolateral membrane HCO3(-)-translocating pathway mediating Na+-HCO3- for Cl- exchange is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1539749816,"The structure of five sulfated oligosaccharide units of highly anionic tracheobronchial mucous glycoproteins, isolated from a cystic fibrosis patient's sputum, were established. Reduced oligosaccharides (84%) were released under alkaline borohydride conditions, and the acidic oligosaccharides (63%) were isolated by Dowex 1-X2 chromatography. Following the removal of acidic oligosaccharides possessing N-acetylneuraminic acid and L-fucose by lectin affinity chromatography a heterogeneous mixture of sulfated oligosaccharides was obtained. From this fraction, five short chain monosulfated oligosaccharides (S-I to S-V) were purified by sequential separation by SynChroprep AX300 anion exchange high pressure liquid chromatography, gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-2, and high voltage paper electrophoresis. Based on the results of carbohydrate composition, sequential exoglycosidase degradation, permethylation analysis, lectin affinity chromatography, and periodate oxidation, the following structures (where GalNAcol is N-acetylgalactosaminitol) were proposed for these oligosaccharides.

https://openalex.org/W1576659748,"Rat thymic lymphocytes possess an amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ exchanger in their plasma membrane. Kinetic studies revealed that 5-(N-methyl-N-isobutyl)amiloride (MIA) was a more potent inhibitor of the antiport than amiloride (cf. apparent Ki of 174 nM and 6 microM, respectively). Inhibition by MIA was rapid (less than 5 s) and readily reversible. [3H]MIA binding to whole cells was assayed by rapid centrifugation following short (5 s) incubations to minimize nonspecific binding. A saturable binding component (Kd approximately equal to 170 nM) which was displaced by amiloride was detected. In contrast, there was no significant amiloride-displaceable binding to human erythrocytes, which have comparatively little Na+/H+ exchange activity. In lymphocytes, the ability of amiloride and several of its analogs to displace [3H]MIA correlated with their potency as inhibitors of the antiport. Both kinetic and binding studies revealed that extracellular H+, but not Na+, inhibited the interaction of MIA with its receptor(s). Taken together, these data suggest that [3H]MIA binds to the Na+/H+ exchanger. Scatchard analysis revealed that [3H]MIA bound to a maximum of 8000 high affinity sites/cell. Activation of Na+/H+ exchange by osmotic shrinking or by the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate was not accompanied by a significant change in [3H]MIA binding. Given an upper limit of 8000 functional sites/thymocyte, we estimate that the turnover number of each maximally activated exchanger is at least 2000 cycles/s."
https://openalex.org/W1493707825,"The mechanisms by which glyburide and tolbutamide signal insulin secretion were examined using a beta cell line (Hamster insulin-secreting tumor (HIT) cells). Insulin secretion was measured in static incubations, free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was monitored in quin 2-loaded cells, and cAMP quantitated by radioimmunoassay. Insulin secretory dose-response curves utilizing static incubations fit a single binding site model and established that glyburide (ED50 = 112 +/- 18 nM) is a more potent secretagogue than tolbutamide (ED50 = 15 +/- 3 microM). Basal HIT cell [Ca2+]i was 76 +/- 7 nM (mean +/- S.E., n = 141) and increased in a dose-dependent manner with both glyburide and tolbutamide with ED50 values of 525 +/- 75 nM and 67 +/- 9 microM, respectively. The less active tolbutamide metabolite, carboxytolbutamide, had no effect on [Ca2+]i or insulin secretion. Chelation of extracellular Ca2+ with 4 mM EGTA completely inhibited the sulfonylurea-induced changes in [Ca2+]i and insulin release and established that the rise in [Ca2+]i came from an extracellular Ca2+ pool. The Ca2+ channel blocker, verapamil, inhibited glyburide- or tolbutamide-stimulated insulin release and the rise in [Ca2+]i at similar concentrations with IC50 values of 3 and 2.5 microM, respectively. At all concentrations tested, the sulfonylureas did not alter HIT cell cAMP content. These findings provide direct experimental evidence that glyburide and tolbutamide allow extracellular Ca2+ to enter the beta cell through verapamil-sensitive, voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, causing a rise in [Ca2+]i which is the second messenger that stimulates insulin release."
https://openalex.org/W1503789453,"Several temperature-sensitive cell division cycle (cdc) mutations differentially affect the regulatory step for cell proliferation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We recently found that one of these mutations, cdc63-1, resides in a gene called PRT1; other mutations in this gene had been previously shown to affect translation initiation. Here we report the molecular cloning and characterization of the PRT1 gene from yeast. Our results show that the PRT1 gene is an essential, single-copy gene which encodes a 2500-nucleotide polyadenylated transcript. The nucleotide sequence indicates that the gene could code for a protein product of Mr 88,000, which bears no overall amino acid sequence similarity to any other known protein but which contains similarity over a limited region to amino acid sequences involved in nucleotide binding."
https://openalex.org/W1601971316,We previously have mapped N6-methyladenosine (m6A) sites within the genomic RNA of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV). The results of that study and of experiments using inhibitors of methylation suggest that m6A might be involved in mRNA processing events. We describe an approach for directly analyzing the function of m6A in RNA and for studying the sequence specificity of the m6A methylase. Two sites of methylation in RSV (nucleotides 7414 and 7424) were altered by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The highly conserved GAC consensus sequence at those sites was changed to GAU. The new sequences were no longer methylated in the RSV genomic RNA; the GAC sequence was required for efficient base modification at those two adenosines. The altered m6A pattern did not affect viral RNA processing or the viral life cycle within infected cells.

https://openalex.org/W1527580266,"Promoter-glutathione S-transferase Ya cDNA hybrid genes were constructed and analyzed to determine the efficiency with which the Ya coding sequence was transcribed and also to determine the associated levels of Ya-specific enzyme activity in mammalian cells which had received the hybrid gene constructs via electroporation. Promoter-containing fragments from either the SV40 early region or the herpes simplex thymidine kinase gene were positioned 5' to the Ya cDNA present in the pGTB38 plasmid. Both promoters supported transcription in in vitro run-off incubations containing a rat cell extract. Efficient transcription was also observed in both monkey Cos cells and mouse C3H/10T1/2 cells. Constructs containing the SV40 promoter and a residual portion of the homopolymeric G tail used in the original Ya cDNA cloning consistently gave 4-50-fold higher levels of transcript than other promoter-cDNA configurations. Associated with transcription of the hybrid gene was the appearance of a glutathione S-transferase YaYa-specific enzyme activity (delta 5-androstene-3,17-dione isomerization) in cytosols of cells electroporated with the hybrid genes. 50-260-fold increases in Ya-specific enzyme activity were found in Cos or C3H/10T1/2 cells containing multiple, episomal copies of the plasmid constructs; enzyme levels dropped in cells containing fewer, integrated plasmid copies. When a mixed population of Cos cells containing YaYa overexpressing cells was treated with benzo(a)pyrene (+/-)-anti-diol epoxide, a cytotoxic alkylating molecule and known YaYa substrate, a 20-30-fold enrichment in clones of YaYa overexpressing cells was seen among those cells which survived the treatment. The results clearly indicate that glutathione S-transferase isozymes can be overexpressed in mammalian cells and that this is accompanied by significant biological resistance to a known alkylating molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1589398776,"Abstract The rate and equilibrium kinetics of [3H]cGMP binding to the two rapidly exchanging and two slowly exchanging sites of dimeric cGMP-dependent protein kinase from bovine lung were studied. As observed by McCune and Gill (McCune, R. W., and Gill, G. N. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 5083-5091), unlabeled cGMP retarded the dissociation of [3H]cGMP bound to the site. This effect was due to interaction of unlabeled cGMP with the rather than the slow site. First, the potencies of unlabeled cGMP and a number of cGMP analogs correlated nearly perfectly with their affinities for the rapid site. Second, the rate of dissociation in the absence of unlabeled ligand was independent of the degree of saturation of the slow sites. Third, unlabeled ligand inhibited the rate of dissociation more (about 10-fold) than theoretically predicted (maximum 2-fold) from interaction between two similar sites in one macromolecule. A favorable free energy coupling appeared to exist between the rapid and slow sites but not between the slow sites. cGMP associated faster to the slow site than the rapid site. Mg/ATP decreased the rate of association to either site by 50% and increased about ten-fold the rate of dissociation from the slow site. The dissociation of cGMP from the slow site could be described by a single activation energy (Ea = 71 kJ X mol-1) for the whole temperature range (0-37 degrees C) tested. These data indicated that the cyclic nucleotide-binding sites of the cGMP-kinase are kinetically more homologous to those in the cAMP-dependent protein kinases than previously recognized."
https://openalex.org/W1507997114,"2',3'-Cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (EC 3.1.4.37) has been widely used as a marker for myelin-oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system. Evidence has been provided that the enzyme is identical with one of the Wolfgram proteins of central nervous system myelin. The amino acid sequence of bovine 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase was determined by both protein and cDNA sequence analyses. Protein sequence analysis was done on bovine elastase 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase, a low molecular weight enzyme obtained by solubilization with pancreatic elastase (EC 3.4.21.36) (Nishizawa, Y., Kurihara, T., and Takahashi, Y. (1980) Biochem. J. 191, 71-82; Kurihara, T., Nishizawa, Y., Takahashi, Y., and Odani, S. (1981) Biochem. J. 195, 153-157). Based on the carboxyl-terminal sequence of bovine elastase 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase, synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides were prepared and used as probes for screening a cDNA library of bovine brain. A cDNA of 2305 base pairs was obtained and sequenced, and the complete amino acid sequence of bovine 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase was deduced. Bovine 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase deduced contains 400 amino acids including initiation methionine and has a molecular weight of 44,850. Bovine elastase 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase corresponds to the 236 amino acids of bovine 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase. RNA blot analysis revealed a single-species mRNA of about 2600 bases."
https://openalex.org/W1540544053,"Two S49 mouse lymphoma cell variants hemizygous for expression of mutant regulatory (R) subunits of type I cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase were used to investigate functional consequences of lesions in the putative cAMP-binding sites of R subunit. Kinase activation properties of wild-type and mutant enzymes were compared using cAMP and six site-selective analogs of cAMP. Kinases from both mutant sublines were relatively resistant to cyclic nucleotide-dependent activation, but they were fully activable by at least some effectors. Relative resistances of the mutant kinases varied from about 5-fold for analogs selective for their nonmutated sites to as much as 700-fold for analogs selective for their mutated sites; resistance to cAMP was intermediate. Apparent affinities of wild-type and mutant R subunits for [3H]cAMP were not appreciably different, but competition experiments with site-selective analogs of cAMP suggested that binding of cAMP to mutant R subunits was primarily to their nonmutated sites. Analyses of cooperativity in cyclic nucleotide-dependent activation of mutant kinases, synergism between site I- and site II-selective analogs in activating the mutant enzymes, and dissociation of bound cAMP from mutant R subunits provided additional evidence that the mutations in these strains selectively inactivated single classes of cAMP-binding sites: phenomena attributable in wild-type enzyme to intrachain interactions between sites I and II were always absent or severely diminished in experiments with the mutant enzymes. These results confirm that R subunit sequences implicated in cAMP binding by homology with other cyclic nucleotide-binding proteins actually correspond to functional cAMP-binding sites. Furthermore, occupation of either cAMP-binding site I or II is apparently sufficient for activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The presence of four functional cAMP-binding sites in wild-type kinase enhances the cooperativity and sensitivity of cAMP-mediated activation."
https://openalex.org/W1593925036,"In the present paper, we report the isolation and characterization of embryonic corneal membrane glycoproteins that demonstrate specific affinity for collagen. Two collagen binding proteins have been isolated: a novel 70-kDa protein and a 47-kDa protein which is apparently similar to that reported by Kurkinen et al. (Kurkinen, M., Taylor, A., Garrels, J. I., and Hogan, B. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 5915-5922). Both proteins label metabolically with [35S]methionine and [3H] glucosamine. 125I iodination of cell surface proteins revealed that the two collagen binding proteins are expressed on the epithelial cell surface. The 70-kDa protein appears to be an integral membrane protein, whereas the 47-kDa protein can be removed from membranes by alkali treatment. The isolated proteins exhibit binding to native type IV collagen as well as heat-denatured type I collagen. It seems likely that we have isolated, at least in part, the cell surface receptor or receptor complex that binds collagen to the basal surface of epithelia."
https://openalex.org/W1596197404,"Interleukin-1 a polypeptide hormone produced by activated macrophages is a mixture of at least two proteins, interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). We have previously shown that macrophage-derived interleukin-1 induced new kappa light chain synthesis for surface IgM expression in a murine pre-B like cell line 70Z/3, a finding associated with an early amiloride-sensitive rise in the total intracellular sodium concentration. Because IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta are structurally quite different, in this study their effect on 70Z/3 was examined separately. The results show that both human rIL-1 alpha and rIL-1 beta induce the differentiation of 70Z/3, but a higher concentration of rIL-1 beta compared to rIL-1 alpha is needed for a maximal response. At saturating concentrations, both rIL-1 alpha and rIL-1 beta induce a simultaneous rise in intracellular pH and sodium concentration. Because rIL-1 mediated intracellular alkalinization and sodium rise are amiloride sensitive, they likely occur through stimulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger across the cell membrane. Inhibition of the Na+/H+ antiport with an amiloride analog did not have an effect on rIL-1 induced surface IgM expression or the rIL-1-mediated increase in kappa light chain specific mRNA level. Therefore, these results indicate that an increase in pHi or [Na]i is not required for IL-1 induced 70Z/3 differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1533909133,"The flexor digitorum brevis skeletal muscle, a nearly homogeneous fast-twitch oxidative glycolytic fiber type, has been examined for its suitability to explore the regulation of phosphorylase kinase by multisite phosphorylation. A characterization of the adrenergic response of glycogenolytic enzymes, together with the previous data on contractile properties (Carlsen, R. C., Larson, D. B., and Walsh, D. A. (1985) Can. J. Physiol. Pharm. 63, 958-965), has demonstrated that this muscle is stably maintained for the several hours necessary for phosphorylation studies. The phosphorylase kinase in this muscle is primarily the alpha' isozyme, suggesting that the alpha versus alpha' isozyme distribution in muscle is related more to oxidative capacity than to fiber contractile characteristics. Using this muscle system, beta-adrenergic activation of phosphorylase kinase was observed to occur with concomitant phosphorylation of both the alpha' and beta subunits, with the total in the alpha' subunit being approximately 3-fold greater. Similarly, deactivation, following initial adrenergic activation, occurred concomitantly with the dephosphorylation of the two subunits. These results are compatible with the conclusions drawn from previous studies of the isolated enzyme and of the enzyme in perfused rat cardiac muscle, that both alpha' (or alpha) and beta subunit phosphorylation regulate phosphorylase kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W153791800,"A direct end label method was used to study the positioning of nucleosome arrays on several long (greater than 2200 base pairs) SV40 DNA fragments reconstituted in vitro with core histones. Comparison of micrococcal nuclease cutting sites in reconstituted and naked DNA fragments revealed substantial differences in one DNA region. When sufficient core histones were annealed with the DNA to form closely spaced nucleosomes over most of the molecule, a uniquely positioned array of four nucleosomes could be assigned, by strict criteria, to a 610-base pair portion of the SV40 late with a precision of about +/- 20 base pairs. In some other DNA regions, a number of alternative nucleosome positions were indicated. The uniquely positioned four-nucleosome array spanned the same 610 nucleotides on two different DNA fragments that possessed different ends. Removal of a DNA region that had contained a terminal nucleosome of the array, by truncation of the fragment before reconstitution, did not affect the positioning of the other three nucleosomes. As the core histone to DNA ratio was lowered, evidence for specific positioning of nucleosomes diminished, except within the region where the four uniquely positioned nucleosomes formed. This region, however, does not appear to have a higher affinity for core histones than other regions of the DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1568119634,"The effect of supercoil and temperature on the topology of phi X174 replicative form (RF) DNA was studied using single-strand specific endonucleases S1 and Bal31 as probes for cruciform extrusion and other structural perturbations of the B-helix. Both enzymes were found to recognize specifically and reproducibly over 30 sites, most of which were cleaved by both enzymes independent of the superhelicity of the genome. A negative superhelical density exceeding 0.06 stabilized a transition in the DNA conformation that generated several new cleavage sites for Bal31. The underlying structures appeared to be only transiently stable and were lost from in vitro supercoiled DNA during brief incubation at 65 degrees C. They were generally absent from in vivo supercoiled RF DNA of equal superhelicity as a consequence of the extraction and storage procedure. Mapping of the cleavage sites suggested that they were preferentially located near the beginnings and ends of genes and that the structural basis for at least some of them was the extrusion of relatively small palindromes into the cruciform state. Insertion of a short synthetic palindromic sequence into the phi X174 genome generated a supercoil-dependent, temperature-sensitive secondary structure that was cleaved in the Bal31 but not the S1 reaction, further supporting the hypothesis that even small cruciforms with stem size of 7 or less base pairs may be transiently stable. Subjecting supercoiled RF DNA to the typical S1 reaction conditions induced a topological shift that diminished all but one of the supercoil-induced Bal31 recognition sites and promoted the formation of one major new site."
https://openalex.org/W2142892224,"Membranes of Dictyostelium discoideum cells were incubated under phosphorylation conditions and washed, and the effects on cAMP binding to chemotactic receptors in the absence and presence of guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) were investigated. Most experiments were done with adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATP gamma S), which is a good substrate for many kinases, but the product, protein phosphorothioate, is not easily hydrolyzed by phosphatases. Pretreatment of membranes under phosphorylating conditions with MgATP gamma S alters the site heterogeneity of the cAMP-binding forms, without a significant effect on the total number of binding sites. A similar effect was induced by GTP gamma S under nonphosphorylation conditions. The effects of MgATP gamma S were rapid (t1/2 = 1 min), irreversible, and not induced by Mg2+ or ATP gamma S alone or by magnesium adenylyl imidodiphosphate and magnesium adenylyl (beta, gamma-methylene)diphosphate. MgATP induced a smaller inhibition than MgATP gamma S, which was potentiated by the addition of exogenous cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The effect of MgATP was rapidly reversible; reversibility was reduced by the phosphatase inhibitor NaF. These results suggest that the effects of MgATP gamma S are mediated by an endogenous protein kinase. The major 35S-thiophosphorylated band detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was a protein with Mr = 36,000. The phosphorylation of a protein with the molecular weight of the cAMP receptor (Mr = 40,000-45,000) was not observed."
https://openalex.org/W1546992982,"N-ras has been identified by molecular cloning and DNA sequence analysis as the activated oncogene in carcinogen-induced guinea pig transformation. The deduced guinea pig amino acid sequence differs from that of human and mouse by 1 and 4 residues, respectively; the mismatches were in the C-terminal half of the fourth exon. The activated N-ras clone has an AT to TA transversion at the third position of codon 61 which results in the insertion of histidine instead of glutamine. The same activated N-ras gene with the identical mutation was found in all lines regardless of initiating carcinogen (aromatic aryl hydrocarbons or alkylating agents). These results suggest that the mutational event was independent of the mutagenic activity of the initiating carcinogen."

https://openalex.org/W1602199261,"The potential correlations between phosphorylase kinase subunit phosphorylation and activation have been examined using 32P-perfused rat hearts exposed to a variety of hormonal stimuli. Phosphate incorporation was measured after isolation of the enzyme by immunoprecipitation from heart extracts. Time courses of catecholamine or glucagon treatment produced a rapid rise in both the activity and the beta subunit phosphorylation of the enzyme, and a slightly slower increase in alpha' subunit phosphorylation. For short durations of catecholamine stimulation, the ratio of phosphate in the alpha' versus beta subunit was dependent upon hormone dose. After removal of hormone, both inactivation and alpha' subunit dephosphorylation were fairly slow, while the beta subunit was dephosphorylated more rapidly. For all of the above conditions, activation correlated with both alpha' and beta subunit phosphorylation. The maximum level of phosphate incorporation observed in response to hormonal stimulation is estimated to be approximately 1.3-1.7 mol of [32P]phosphate/mol of (alpha' beta gamma delta)4, divided about equally between the alpha' and beta subunits. When hearts were treated with hormone either in the absence of added calcium or in the presence of a calcium channel blocker, the time courses of subunit phosphorylation and activation were similar to those seen with standard perfusion conditions, suggesting that if any Ca2+-dependent autophosphorylation of phosphorylase kinase were occurring it does not make a major contribution to the observed hormonal responses. The complicated relationships observed here between phosphorylase kinase subunit phosphorylation and activation for the most part provide physiological affirmation of the patterns observed in vitro, but they also show some possible differences of potential interest."

https://openalex.org/W1596816729,"HeLa cells synthesize and secrete increased levels of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) when incubated for 18 h with 10-20 nM phorbol myristate acetate. This response was inhibited by a number of conditions which affect intracellular Na+ and K+ concentrations. Removing extracellular Na+, while maintaining isotonicity with choline+, reduced the secretion of both functional and antigenic tPA in a linear fashion. A series of cardiac glycosides and related compounds strongly inhibited tPA secretion with the following rank order of potency: digitoxin = ouabain greater than digoxin greater than digitoxigenin greater than digoxigenin greater than digitoxose greater than digitonin. These compounds also inhibited cellular Na+/K+-ATPase activity over an identical concentration range. Two compounds which selectively increase cellular permeability to K+, valinomycin, and nigericin, strongly inhibited tPA secretion, with IC50 values of approximately 50 nM. In contrast, monensin, which selectively increases cellular permeability to Na+, was much less active. Valinomycin, but not nigericin, also inhibited cellular Na+/K+-ATPase activity. Phorbol myristate acetate, 5-20 nM, increased Na+/K+-ATPase activity up to 2-fold and tPA secretion up to 15-fold. We conclude that the secretion of tPA by HeLa cells treated with phorbol myristate acetate proceeds via a mechanism which requires extracellular Na+ and a functional Na+/K+-ATPase (sodium pump) enzyme."
