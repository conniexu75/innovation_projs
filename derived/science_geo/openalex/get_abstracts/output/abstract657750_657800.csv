https://openalex.org/W3049089601,"Anemia remains a major public health challenge with high prevalence among women in South and Southeast Asian countries. Reductions in anemia rates have been stalled, despite the implementation of different maternal health and nutrition programs. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and factors associated with anemia among women of reproductive age in seven selected South and Southeast Asian countries.This cross-sectional analysis utilized data from the most recent demographic and health surveys from seven selected South and Southeast Asian countries (Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, and Timor-Leste) between 2011 and 2016. This study included 726,164 women of reproductive age. Multiple logistic regression was performed to assess the factors associated with anemia among women for each country separately.The combined prevalence of anemia was 52.5%, ranged from 22.7% in Timor-Leste to 63% in the Maldives. Results from multiple logistic regression suggest that likelihood of anemia is significantly higher among younger women (15-24 years), women with primary or no education, women from the poorest wealth quintile, women without toilet facilities and improved water sources, underweight women, and women with more than one children born in last five years in most of the countries.The prevalence of anemia is high among women of reproductive age in the seven selected South and Southeast Asian countries. The results of this study suggest that various household, environmental and individual factors contribute to the increased likelihood of anemia. Evidence-based, multidisciplinary policies and programs targeting mothers' health and nutrition status, in addition to scaling-up women's education and socioeconomic status, are warranted to combat anemia."

The aim of this study was to determine the factors associated with Covid-19 preventive behaviors among oral health care providers using an extended parallel process model (EPPM). Methods In a cross-sectional study, short text message invite surveys were sent to 870 oral health care providers in west part of Iran. Data were collected through validated self-report EPPM questionnaires. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square and Fishers exact tests were used for data analysis. Results In total, 300 completed questionnaires were received and the mean age of respondents was 29.89 ± 11.17 years (range: 20–75 years). Among the study population, 284 (94.67%) perceived the threat of infection highly. Washing hands frequently with water and soap and use of hand sanitizer was reported by 93.33%, of participants. Age (P = 0.010), sex (P = 0.002) and occupation field (P = 0.010) were significantly associated with danger control responses. Data identified that those oral health care providers that were on the danger control response adopted preventive behaviors more strictly than those on fear control response. Conclusion The results of this study showed how degrees of perceived threat and perceived efficacy influenced oral health providers’ willingness to perform recommended health behaviors. These findings can assist public health agencies in developing educational programs specifically designed for promoting preventive behaviors among oral health providers in pandemic situations."

We investigated DNA methylation level of the unique CpG island of HLA-G gene in CHD patients and evaluated the correlation with cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) features.Thirty-two patients that underwent CCTA for suspected CHD were enrolled for this study. Obstructive CHD group included fourteen patients, in which there was a stenosis greater than or equal to 50% in one or more of the major coronary arteries detected; whereas subjects with Calcium (Ca) Score = 0, uninjured coronaries and with no obstructive CHD (no critical stenosis, NCS) were considered as control subjects (n = 18). For both groups, DNA methylation profile of the whole 5'UTR-CpG island of HLA-G was measured. The plasma soluble HLA-G (sHLA-G) levels were detected in all subjects by specific ELISA assay. Statistical analysis was performed using R software.For the first time, our study reported that 1) a significant hypomethylation characterized three specific fragments (B, C and F) of the 5'UTR-CpG island (p = 0.05) of HLA-G gene in CHD patients compared to control group; 2) the hypomethylation level of one specific fragment of 161bp (+616/+777) positively correlated with coronary Ca score, a relevant parameter of CCTA (p<0.05) between two groups evaluated and was predictive for disease severity.Reduced levels of circulating HLA-G molecules could derive from epigenetic marks. Epigenetics phenomena induce hypomethylation of specific regions into 5'UTR-CpG island of HLA-G gene in CHD patients with obstructive non critical stenosis vs coronary stenosis individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3049240529,"Increased intestinal permeability (IP) and inflammation are both linked with functionality of the intestinal barrier and in particular enterocytes. Currently, almost all assessment methods of the intestinal barrier function are invasive. The present study aimed to quantify selected proteins as novel biomarkers in excreta of broiler chickens to facilitate non-invasive assessment of gut barrier function using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). It was further hypothesised that probiotics as feed additives may counteract gut barrier dysfunction. A 3 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments was used with the main factors being gut barrier dysfunction models (control, rye-based diet, and dexamethasone–DEX) with and without probiotic supplementation (a three-strain Bacillus) using 72 male Ross 308 day-old chickens. Each of the 6 experimental treatments was replicated 12 times. On d 21 of age, fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-d) uptake into serum was examined to test IP. Fresh excreta samples were collected on d 20. The biomarkers included alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT), intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP), lipocalin-2 (LCN2), fibronectin (FN), intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP), ovotransferrin (OVT) and superoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn] (SOD1). Only DEX increased (P<0.001) FITC-d passage to the blood on d 21 of age, indicating a greater IP. The excreta concentrations of A1AT, I-FABP and SOD1 were unaltered by the experimental treatments. DEX increased (P<0.05) FN concentration in excreta compared with control birds. Conversely, inclusion of rye in the diet reduced (P<0.05) FN but increased (P<0.001) OVT in excreta. Independently, DEX decreased IAP (P<0.05) in excreta compared with control and rye-fed birds. The excreta concentration of LCN2 tended (P = 0.086) to increase in birds injected by DEX. There was no demonstrable effect of probiotic addition on any of the studied parameters. Among the tested biomarkers, FN, IAP, and LCN2 revealed promise as biomarkers of intestinal barrier function quantified by ELISA kits."
https://openalex.org/W3049712640,"Melatonin is effective in enhancing various abiotic stress resistances of plants. However, its underlying mechanisms in drought-resistance in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is not clear. The goal of this work was to investigate the effect of melatonin on seed germination and to evaluate leaf antioxidant physiology for two wheat varieties. Experiments included 20% PEG, melatonin plus 20% PEG and a control using two contrasting wheat varieties (JM22– drought sensitive and HG35– drought resistant). Melatonin levels were 0, 1, 10, 100 and 300 μmol L-1. Results revealed that 300 μmol L-1 of melatonin alleviated the negative effect of water stress on germination and increased radicle length, radicle number, and plumule length of the germinated seeds. Principal component analysis showed a significant change in amino acid content during germination and this change was dependent on melatonin concentration and the variety. Lysine (Lys) content in wheat seeds under the PEG plus 300 μmol L-1 melatonin treatment increased compared with that of the seeds under PEG alone. There was a significant and positive correlation between Lys content and morphological index of germination. During seedling growth, soluble protein was involved in osmotic adjustment and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was increased to mitigate the damage in the cytomembrane of JM 22 leaf under 300 μmol L-1 melatonin plus PEG treatment. The effect of melatonin was dependent on SOD activity increasing significantly for HG35—a drought resistant variety. The results of this work lays a foundation for further studies to determine if melatonin can be economically used to mitigate the impact of dry planting conditions on wheat productivity in North China Plain."
https://openalex.org/W3049339741,"The phyllosphere microbiome is increasingly recognised as an influential component of plant physiology, yet it remains unclear whether stable host-microbe associations generally exist in the phyllosphere. Leptospermum scoparium (mānuka) is a tea tree indigenous to New Zealand, and honey derived from mānuka is widely known to possess unique antimicrobial properties. However, the host physiological traits associated with these antimicrobial properties vary widely, and the specific cause of such variation has eluded scientists despite decades of research. Notably, the mānuka phyllosphere microbiome remains uncharacterised, and its potential role in mediating host physiology has not been considered. Working within the prevailing core microbiome conceptual framework, we hypothesise that the phyllosphere microbiome of mānuka exhibits specific host association patterns congruent with those of a microbial community under host selective pressure (null hypothesis: the mānuka phyllosphere microbiome is recruited stochastically from the surrounding environment). To examine our hypothesis, we characterised the phyllosphere and associated soil microbiomes of five distinct and geographically distant mānuka populations across the North Island of New Zealand. We identified a habitat-specific and relatively abundant core microbiome in the mānuka phyllosphere, which was persistent across all samples. In contrast, non-core phyllosphere microorganisms exhibited significant variation across individual host trees and populations that was strongly driven by environmental and spatial factors. Our results demonstrate the existence of a dominant and ubiquitous core microbiome in the phyllosphere of mānuka, supporting our hypothesis that phyllosphere microorganisms of mānuka exhibit specific host association and potentially mediate physiological traits of this nationally and culturally treasured indigenous plant. In addition, our results illustrate biogeographical patterns in mānuka phyllosphere microbiomes and offer insight into factors contributing to phyllosphere microbiome assembly."

The current study explored the research priorities of parents of school-aged children on the autism spectrum across the home, school, and community settings. A combination of content analysis of an online questionnaire (n = 134) and Q-sort methodology (n = 9) was used. The most commonly identified research priorities in the online questionnaire were child health and well-being (home setting), socialisation and social support (school), and community awareness and understanding of autism (community). The Q-sort method highlighted different top priorities, with understanding the parent, sibling, child and family impact and stress the highest ranked priority for home, teacher/staff education and support for the school, and recognizing and supporting anxiety for the community. The implications of the findings are discussed in relation to shifting the framework of autism research to align research agendas with parental priorities."
https://openalex.org/W3049059894,"Endothelial injury is a common manifestation in IgA nephropathy (IgAN). After the previous identification of the upregulated soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) correlated with endothelial injury in IgAN, in the present study, we further explored the role of sFlt-1 in endothelial injury in IgAN. We enrolled 72 patients with IgAN and detected the sFlt-1 levels. The polymeric IgA1 (pIgA1) complexes were isolated from the pooled plasma samples of another 10 patients with IgAN. Apoptosis proteins were detected in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with the stimulation of recombinant sFlt-1 or the caspase-9 inhibitor Z-LEHD-FMK. We identified there were positive correlations between sFlt-1 and IgA-IgG complex as well as vWF levels in patients with IgAN. The sFlt-1 levels in HUVECs were significantly upregulated by pIgA1 complex derived from IgAN patients in a concentration-dependent manner. The proliferation ability of HUVECs was damaged when stimulated with sFlt-1 protein in a time- and dose- dependent manner. And the apoptosis rate was up-regulated significantly as the stimulation concentrations of sFlt-1 increased. We found sFlt-1 challenge could significantly increase the expression of vWF. In addition, sFlt-1 increased the levels of caspase-9, caspase-3, Bax and mitochondrial membrane potential; facilitated the release of cytochrome C from mitochondria to cytoplasma. In contrast, Z-LEHD-FMK attenuated high sFlt-1-induced HUVECs apoptosis. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that sFlt-1 expression was up-regulated by the challenge of pIgA1 complex derived from patients with IgAN. Furthermore, increased sFlt-1 facilitated human umbilical vein endothelial cells apoptosis via the mitochondrial-dependent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3049626228,"Background Poor health literacy has been associated with poorer physical and mental health function, and higher emergency department and hospital utilizations. The study was conducted to measure the prevalence of health literacy and its determinants among Lagos State residents. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in three local government areas in Lagos State. Health literacy was assessed using the Brief Health Literacy Screening tool (BHLS), a three-item tool with possible scores ranging between 3 and 15. Health literacy was classified as inadequate (≤ 9) or adequate (>9). Results A total of 1831 respondents participated in the study, among whom, 952 (52%) were women. The mean age of respondents was 31.7 (±10.5) years. Three-quarters (74.8%) of respondents had adequate health literacy. Adequate levels of health literacy were associated with being female (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.07–1.71), frequent use of the broad cast media as source of information (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.03–1.70), frequent use of the internet as source of information (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.13–1.96). Adequate health literacy was also associated with having knowledge of a frequently prescribed antibiotic (OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.32–2.12) and being more comfortable with the use of the English language (OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.32–2.22). Conclusion Gender, the use of broadcast media and the internet are predictive of adequate health literacy and should be taken into consideration in planning health interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3048974830,"Despite enzalutamide's efficacy in delaying the progression of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), resistance to this anti-androgen inevitably occurs. Several studies have revealed that the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5 plays a role in tumour progression and development of drug resistance such as enzalutamide. Data mining revealed heterogeneous expression of STAT5 in enzalutamide-treated mCRPC patients and enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer (PCa). Isobologram analysis revealed that the STAT5 inhibitor pimozide combined with enzalutamide has? additive and synergistic inhibitory effects on cell viability in the used models. Functional analysis with siRNA-mediated STAT5 knockdown yielded divergent results. The LNCaP-derived cell line MR49F could be resensitised to enzalutamide by siRNA-mediated STAT5b-knock-down. In contrast, neither STAT5a nor STAT5b knockdown resensitised enzalutamide-resistant LAPC4-EnzaR cells to enzalutamide. In conclusion, our results indicate that STAT5 may be a possible target in a subgroup of enzalutamide-resistant PCa. However, based on the data presented here, a general role of STAT5 in enzalutamide-resistance and its potential as a therapeutic target could not be shown."
https://openalex.org/W3049060002,"Emergence and intercontinental spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (HPAI) H5Nx virus clade 2.3.4.4 has resulted in substantial economic losses to the poultry industry in Asia, Europe, and North America. The long-distance migratory birds have been suggested to play a major role in the global spread of avian influenza viruses during this wave of panzootic outbreaks since 2013. Poultry farm epidemics caused by multiple introduction of different HPAI novel subtypes of clade 2.3.4.4 viruses also occurred in Taiwan between 2015 and 2017. The mandatory and active surveillance detected H5N3 and H5N6 circulation in 2015 and 2017, respectively, while H5N2 and H5N8 were persistently identified in poultry farms since their first arrival in 2015. This study intended to assess the importance of various ecological factors contributed to the persistence of HPAI during three consecutive years. We used satellite technology to identify the location of waterfowl flocks. Four risk factors consistently showed strong association with the spatial clustering of H5N2 and H5N8 circulations during 2015 and 2017, including high poultry farm density (aOR:17.46, 95%CI: 5.91–74.86 and 8.23, 95% CI: 2.12–54.86 in 2015 and 2017, respectively), poultry heterogeneity index (aOR of 12.28, 95%CI: 5.02–31.14 and 2.79, 95%CI: 1.00–7.69, in 2015 and 2017, respectively), non-registered waterfowl flock density (aOR: 6.8, 95%CI: 3.41–14.46 and 9.17, 95%CI: 3.73–26.20, in 2015 and 2017, respectively) and higher percentage of cropping land coverage (aOR of 1.36, 95%CI: 1.10–1.69 and 1.04, 95%CI: 1.02–1.07, in 2015 and 2017, respectively). Our study highlights the application of remote sensing and clustering analysis for the identification and characterization of environmental factors in facilitating and contributing to the persistent circulation of certain subtypes of H5Nx in poultry farms in Taiwan."
https://openalex.org/W3049200465,"Management practices such as tillage, crop rotation, irrigation, organic and inorganic inputs application are known to influence diversity and function of soil microbial populations. In this study, we investigated the effect of conventional versus organic farming systems at low and high input levels on structure and diversity of prokaryotic microbial communities. Soil samples were collected from the ongoing long-term farming system comparison trials established in 2007 at Chuka and Thika in Kenya. Physicochemical parameters for each sample were analyzed. Total DNA and RNA amplicons of variable region (V4—V7) of the 16S rRNA gene were generated on an Illumina platform using the manufacturer’s instructions. Diversity indices and statistical analysis were done using QIIME2 and R packages, respectively. A total of 29,778,886 high quality reads were obtained and assigned to 16,176 OTUs at 97% genetic distance across both 16S rDNA and 16S rRNA cDNA datasets. The results pointed out a histrionic difference in OTUs based on 16S rDNA and 16S rRNA cDNA. Precisely, while 16S rDNA clustered by site, 16S rRNA cDNA clustered by farming systems. In both sites and systems, dominant phylotypes were affiliated to phylum Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria. Conventional farming systems showed a higher species richness and diversity compared to organic farming systems, whilst 16S rRNA cDNA datasets were similar. Physiochemical factors were associated differently depending on rRNA and rDNA. Soil pH, electrical conductivity, organic carbon, nitrogen, potassium, aluminium, zinc, iron, boron and micro-aggregates showed a significant influence on the observed microbial diversity. The observed higher species diversity in the conventional farming systems can be attributed to the integration of synthetic and organic agricultural inputs. These results show that the type of inputs used in a farming system not only affect the soil chemistry but also the microbial population dynamics and eventually the functional roles of these microbes."
https://openalex.org/W3049447456,"The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has been an economic game changer for both China and Pakistan. We investigate stakeholder satisfaction with CPEC projects in Pakistan, particularly with respect to the affected local communities. Given the project application and adaptability, two provinces-Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab-and eight districts were selected randomly. Primary data from approximately 250 respondents as well as secondary data were collected. Among other models, a logit model was adopted to determine the role of certain factors in the perceived level of satisfaction. Results reveal that with respect to the relationship between land acquisition and dissatisfaction with a CPEC project, the level of dissatisfaction is 2.45 times higher when land is acquired by force or when compensation for the land is perceived to be inadequate by the local people. Individuals favor economic zones and development projects over road projects; the likelihood of being dissatisfied is approximately nine times greater in regions without economic zones than that in regions with such zones. Similarly, when no development project is allocated to a community, the probability of dissatisfaction of the local people is about 7.6 times greater. In addition, expectations of poor financial outcomes for CPEC projects cause significant dissatisfaction and are a source of tension among the local people. To reduce dissatisfaction, organizations and business communities must actively support the success of CPEC projects. A more equitable allocation of economic zones and development projects may help ease tensions and increase satisfaction among the local people."
https://openalex.org/W3048851479,"This study presents two simulation modelling tools to support the organisation of networks of dialysis services during the COVID-19 pandemic. These tools were developed to support renal services in the South of England (the Wessex region caring for 650 dialysis patients), but are applicable elsewhere. A discrete-event simulation was used to model a worst case spread of COVID-19, to stress-test plans for dialysis provision throughout the COVID-19 outbreak. We investigated the ability of the system to manage the mix of COVID-19 positive and negative patients, the likely effects on patients, outpatient workloads across all units, and inpatient workload at the centralised COVID-positive inpatient unit. A second Monte-Carlo vehicle routing model estimated the feasibility of patient transport plans. If current outpatient capacity is maintained there is sufficient capacity in the South of England to keep COVID-19 negative/recovered and positive patients in separate sessions, but rapid reallocation of patients may be needed. Outpatient COVID-19 cases will spillover to a secondary site while other sites will experience a reduction in workload. The primary site chosen to manage infected patients will experience a significant increase in outpatients and inpatients. At the peak of infection, it is predicted there will be up to 140 COVID-19 positive patients with 40 to 90 of these as inpatients, likely breaching current inpatient capacity. Patient transport services will also come under considerable pressure. If patient transport operates on a policy of one positive patient at a time, and two-way transport is needed, a likely scenario estimates 80 ambulance drive time hours per day (not including fixed drop-off and ambulance cleaning times). Relaxing policies on individual patient transport to 2-4 patients per trip can save 40-60% of drive time. In mixed urban/rural geographies steps may need to be taken to temporarily accommodate renal COVID-19 positive patients closer to treatment facilities."
https://openalex.org/W3049560453,"Background Chronic childhood malnutrition, or stunting, remains a persistent barrier to achieve optimal cognitive development, child growth and ability to reach full potential. Almost half of children under-five years of age are stunted in the province of Sindh, Pakistan. Objective The primary objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the provision of lipid-based nutrient supplement—medium-quantity (LNS-MQ) known as Wawamum will result in a 10% reduction in risk of being stunted at the age of 24 months in the intervention group compared with the control group. Design A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in Thatta and Sujawal districts of Sindh province, Pakistan. A total of 870 (419 in intervention; 451 in control) children between 6–18 months old were enrolled in the study. The unit of randomization was union council and considered as a cluster. A total of 12 clusters, 6 in each study group were randomly assigned to intervention and control group. All children received standard government health services, while children in the intervention group also received 50 grams/day of Wawamum. Results Children who received Wawamum were found to have a significantly reduced risk of stunting (RR = 0.91, 95% CI; 0.88–0.94, p<0.001) and wasting (RR = 0.78, 95% CI; 0.67–0.92, p = 0.004) as compared to children who received the standard government health services. There was no evidence of a reduction in the risk of underweight (RR = 0.94, 95% CI; 0.85–1.04, p = 0.235) in the intervention group compared to the control group. Statistically significant reduction in anaemia in the intervention group was also found as compared to the control group (RR = 0.97, 95% CI; 0.94–0.99, p = 0.042). The subgroup analysis by age, showed intervention effect is significant in reduction of risk of stunting in younger children of aged 6–12 month (RR = 0.83, 95% CI; 0.81–0.86, p = <0.001) and their older peers aged 13–18 month- (RR = 0.90, 95% CI; 0.83–0.97, p = 0.008). The mean compliance of Wawamum was 60% among children. Conclusions The study confirmed that the provision of Wawamum to children 6–23 months of age is effective in reducing the risk of stunting, wasting and anaemia. This approach should be scaled up among the most food insecure areas/households with a high prevalence of stunting to achieve positive outcomes for nutrition and health.

https://openalex.org/W3049235077,"Golgi phosphoprotein 3 (GOLPH3) is a peripheral membrane protein localized at the trans-Golgi network that is also distributed in a large cytosolic pool. GOLPH3 has been involved in several post-Golgi protein trafficking events, but its precise function at the molecular level is not well understood. GOLPH3 is also considered the first oncoprotein of the Golgi apparatus, with important roles in several types of cancer. Yet, it is unknown how GOLPH3 is regulated to achieve its contribution in the mechanisms that lead to tumorigenesis. Binding of GOLPH3 to Golgi membranes depends on its interaction to phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate. However, an early finding showed that GTP promotes the binding of GOLPH3 to Golgi membranes and vesicles. Nevertheless, it remains largely unknown whether this response is consequence of the function of GTP-dependent regulatory factors, such as proteins of the RAB family of small GTPases. Interestingly, in Drosophila melanogaster the ortholog of GOLPH3 interacts with- and behaves as effector of the ortholog of RAB1. However, there is no experimental evidence implicating GOLPH3 as a possible RAB1 effector in mammalian cells. Here, we show that human GOLPH3 interacted directly with either RAB1A or RAB1B, the two isoforms of RAB1 in humans. The interaction was nucleotide dependent and it was favored with GTP-locked active state variants of these GTPases, indicating that human GOLPH3 is a bona fide effector of RAB1A and RAB1B. Moreover, the expression in cultured cells of the GTP-locked variants resulted in less distribution of GOLPH3 in the Golgi apparatus, suggesting an intriguing model of GOLPH3 regulation."
https://openalex.org/W3049256627,"Why people differ in their susceptibility to external events is essential to our understanding of personality, human development, and mental disorders. Genes explain a substantial portion of these differences. Specifically, genes influencing the serotonin system are hypothesized to be differential susceptibility factors, determining a person’s reactivity to both positive and negative environments. We tested whether genetic variation in the serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR) is a differential susceptibility factor for daily events. Participants (N = 326, 77% female, mean age = 25, range = 17–36) completed smartphone questionnaires four times a day over four to five days, measuring stressors, uplifts, positive and negative affect. Affect was predicted from environment valence in the previous hour on a within-person level using three-level autoregressive linear mixed models. The 5-HTTLPR fulfilled all criteria of a differential susceptibility factor: Positive affect in carriers of the short allele (S) was less reactive to both uplifts and stressors, compared to homozygous carriers of the long allele (L/L). This pattern might reflect relative affective inflexibility in S-allele carriers. Our study provides insight into the serotonin system’s general role in susceptibility and highlights the need to assess the whole spectrum of naturalistic experiences."
https://openalex.org/W3049659496,"Breastfeeding is one of many health practices known to support the survival and health of mother and infant, yet low breastfeeding rates persist globally. These rates may be influenced by limited diffusion of evidence-based research and guidelines from the scientific community (SC). As recently highlighted by the National Academy of Sciences, there is a need for the SC to diffuse its findings to the public more effectively online, as means to counteract the spread of misinformation. In response to this call, we gathered data from Twitter for one month from major breastfeeding hashtags resulting in an interconnected social network (n = 3,798 users). We then identified 59 influencers who disproportionately influenced information flow using social network analysis. These influencers were from the SC (e.g. academics, researchers, health care practitioners), as well as interested citizens (IC) and companies. We then conducted an ego-network analysis of influencer networks, developed ego maps, and compared diffusion metrics across the SC, IC and company influencers. We also qualitatively analyzed their tweets (n = 711) to understand the type of information being diffused. SC influencers were the least efficient communicators. Although having the highest tweeting activity (80% of tweets), they did not reach more individuals compared to IC and companies (two-step ego size: 220± 99, 188 ± 124, 169 ± 97 respectively, P = 0.28). Content analysis of tweets suggest IC are more active than the SC in diffusing evidence-based breastfeeding knowledge, with 35% of their tweets around recent research findings compared to only 12% by the SC. Nonetheless, in terms of outreach to the general public, the two-step networks of SC influences were more heterogenous than ICs (55.7 ± 5.07, 50.9 ± 12.0, respectively, P<0.001). Collectively, these findings suggest SC influencers may possess latent potential to diffuse research and evidence- based practices. However, the research suggests specific ways to enhance diffusion."
https://openalex.org/W3048578548,"The COVID-19 crisis resulted in a large proportion of the world’s population having to employ social distancing measures and self-quarantine. Given that limiting social interaction impacts mental health, we assessed the effects of quarantine on emotive perception as a proxy of affective states. To this end, we conducted an online experiment whereby 112 participants provided affective ratings for a set of normative images and reported on their well-being during COVID-19 self-isolation. We found that current valence ratings were significantly lower than the original ones from 2015. This negative shift correlated with key aspects of the personal situation during the confinement, including working and living status, and subjective well-being. These findings indicate that quarantine impacts mood negatively, resulting in a negatively biased perception of emotive stimuli. Moreover, our online assessment method shows its validity for large-scale population studies on the impact of COVID-19 related mitigation methods and well-being."
https://openalex.org/W3048909610,"Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) invade blood vessels in solid tumors and promote metastases by circulating in the blood. CTCs are thus recognized as targets for liquid biopsy and can provide useful information for design of treatments. This diagnostic approach must consider not only the number of CTCs but also their molecular and genetic characteristics. For this purpose, use of devices that enrich CTCs independent of these characteristics and detectors that recognize various CTC characteristics is essential. In the present study, we developed a CTC detection system comprising ClearCell FX and ImageStream Mark II. We clarified the analytical performance of this system by evaluating recovery rate, lower limits of detection, and linearity. These parameters are critical for detecting rare cells, such as CTCs. We tested these parameters using three cell lines with different expression levels of the epithelial marker-epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and spiked these cells into whole-blood samples from healthy donors. The average recovery rate and lower limit of detection were approximately 40% and five cells/7.5 mL of whole blood, respectively. High linearity was observed for all evaluated samples. We also evaluated the ability of the system to distinguish between normal and abnormal cells based on protein expression levels and gene amplification and found that the system can identify abnormal cells using these characteristics. The CTC detection system thus displays the ability to distinguish specific characteristics of CTC, thereby providing valuable information for cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3049329325,"Introduction Neighborhood socioeconomic (nSES) factors have been implicated in prostate cancer (PCa) disparities. In line with the Precision Medicine Initiative that suggests clinical and socioenvironmental factors can impact PCa outcomes, we determined whether nSES variables are associated with time to PCa diagnosis and could inform PCa clinical risk assessment. Materials and methods The study sample included 358 high risk men (PCa family history and/or Black race), aged 35–69 years, enrolled in an early detection program. Patient variables were linked to 78 nSES variables (employment, income, etc.) from previous literature via geocoding. Patient-level models, including baseline age, prostate specific antigen (PSA), digital rectal exam, as well as combined models (patient plus nSES variables) by race/PCa family history subgroups were built after variable reduction methods using Cox regression and LASSO machine-learning. Model fit of patient and combined models (AIC) were compared; p-values<0.05 were significant. Model-based high/low nSES exposure scores were calculated and the 5-year predicted probability of PCa was plotted against PSA by high/low neighborhood score to preliminarily assess clinical relevance. Results In combined models, nSES variables were significantly associated with time to PCa diagnosis. Workers mode of transportation and low income were significant in White men with a PCa family history. Homeownership (%owner-occupied houses with >3 bedrooms) and unemployment were significant in Black men with and without a PCa family history, respectively. The 5-year predicted probability of PCa was higher in men with a high neighborhood score (weighted combination of significant nSES variables) compared to a low score (e.g., Baseline PSA level of 4ng/mL for men with PCa family history: White—26.7% vs 7.7%; Black—56.2% vs 29.7%). Discussion Utilizing neighborhood data during patient risk assessment may be useful for high risk men affected by disparities. However, future studies with larger samples and validation/replication steps are needed."
https://openalex.org/W3049636697,"Purpose We investigated how the abnormalities of fixation eye movements (FEMs) of the amblyopic eye were linked with treatment outcomes following part-time patching therapy in children with amblyopia. Methods We recruited 53 patients, with at least 12 months of patching, and measured FEMs at the end of treatment. Subjects were classified based on FEM waveforms (those without nystagmus = 21, those with nystagmus without fusion maldevelopment nystagmus (FMN) = 21, and those with FMN = 11) and based on clinical type of amblyopia (anisometropic = 18, strabismic = 6, and mixed = 29). The treatment outcomes such as duration of treatment of receiving part-time patching therapy, visual acuity and stereo-acuity deficits at the end of treatment were determined. Bivariate contour ellipse area (BCEA), fast (fixational saccade/quick phases), and slow (inter-saccadic drifts/slow phases) FEMs of the fellow and amblyopic eye were analyzed. Results Anisometropic group had less residual amblyopia (0.23±0.19logMAR acuity) compared to strabismic/mixed (0.36±0.26) groups (p = 0.007). Treatment duration in patients without nystagmus was lower (12.6±9.5months) compared to nystagmus without FMN (25.6±23.2) and FMN (29.5±20.4) groups (p = 0.006). Patients without nystagmus had better stereopsis at the end of treatment (2.3±0.84logarcsecs) compared to nystagmus without FMN (2.6±0.84) group (p = 0.003). The majority of patients with FMN (8/11) had absent stereopsis. BCEA of the amblyopic eye was higher in patients with greater residual visual acuity deficits in patients without nystagmus. No such association was seen in Nystagmus no FMN and FMN groups. Increased amplitude of fast FEMs, increased eye position variance and eye velocity of slow FEMs were seen in patients who had received longer duration of part time patching therapy and in those with greater residual amblyopia, and poor stereopsis at the end of treatment. Conclusions Assessment of FEM waveforms and fast and slow FEM characteristics are important measures while describing fixation instability in amblyopia. Several FEM abnormalities were associated with stereo-acuity and visual acuity deficits and treatment duration in patients with amblyopia treated with part time patching therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3048379965,"Abnormal skin melanin homeostasis results in refractory pigmentary diseases. Melanogenesis is influenced by gene regulation, ultraviolet radiation, and host epigenetic responses. Steroid receptor RNA activator (SRA), a long noncoding RNA, is known to regulate steroidogenesis and tumorigenesis. However, how SRA contributes to melanogenesis remains unknown. Using RNA interference against SRA in B16 and A375 melanoma cells, we observed increased pigmentation and increased expression of TRP1 and TRP2 at transcriptional and translational levels only in B16 cells. The constitutive phosphorylation of p38 in B16-shCtrl cells was inhibited in cells with knocked down SRAi. Moreover, the melanin content of control B16 cells was increased by SB202190, a p38 inhibitor. Furthermore, reduced p38 phosphorylation, enhanced TRP1 expression, and hypermelanosis were observed in A375 cells with RNA interference. These results indicate that SRA-p38-TRP1 axis has a regulatory role in melanin homeostasis and that SRA might be a potential therapeutic target for treating pigmentary diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3049157819,"Several studies have shown that nutrition and muscle strength were associated with functional recovery in patients with hip fracture. However, the impact of heart failure on the improvement of activity of daily living (ADL) in patients with hip fracture have not been fully investigated. The purpose was investigating the effect of heart failure on the ADL improvement by rehabilitation in patients with hip fracture. A total of 116 patients with hip fracture discharged from our convalescent rehabilitation ward were studied. Heart failure was assessed based on plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels on admission. ADL was assessed based on rehabilitation effectiveness (REs), which was calculated using the FIM instrument. Clinical, demographic, and nutritional variables were measured. Multiple regression analysis was performed with REs as the dependent variable; variables showing significant correlation with REs in univariate analyses were selected as independent variables. Based on plasma BNP levels, we assigned 39 patients to a Low group: 22 (17−25) median (interquartile) pg/mL, 39 to a Middle group: 52 (42−65) pg/mL, and 38 to a High group: 138 (93−209) pg/mL. REs, handgrip strength, Hb, albumin, and GNRI were higher and age was younger in the Low group than High group (each p < 0.01, respectively). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that age (p < 0.05), sex (p < 0.05), handgrip strength (p < 0.01), FOIS at admission (p < 0.01), rehabilitation time per day (p < 0.01), and BNP (p < 0.05) were significantly associated with REs. The effect of rehabilitation on ADL improvement was significantly blunted in the High group compared to the Low group. In conclusion, these results suggest that heart failure assessed based on plasma BNP levels negatively impacts improvements in ADL achieved through rehabilitation in patients with hip fracture."
https://openalex.org/W3049286887,"Background Risk perception (RP) describes patient´s judgment of the likelihood of experiencing something unpleasant, and has been associated to the adoption of health behaviors. Current rheumatoid arthritis (RA) guidelines recommend early and intensive treatment, although patients also commonly use Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM). We aimed to investigate if significant RP was associated to CAM use in Hispanic RA outpatients and to describe additional associated factors. Methods Between March and August 2019, 266 consecutive outpatients were invited to a face-to-face interview to collect socio-demographic and RA-related information, to assess comorbidity and the following patient-reported-outcomes: pain, overall-disease and treatment adherence with visual analogue scales, disease activity with RAPID-3, RP with a validated questionnaire, and CAM use with a translated and cross-culturally adapted for Argentina version of the International CAM questionnaire. Medical records were reviewed to corroborate the data provided by the patients. CAM use definition was restricted to “in the last 3 months”. Significant RP was defined based on published cut-off. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to investigate factors associated to CAM use. The study received IRB approval. Results There were 246 patients included, primarily middle-aged women, with substantial disease duration, moderate disease activity and 70 patients (28.5%) had significant RP. Two hundreds patients (81.3%) were CAM users. Significant RP (OR: 2.388, 95%CI: 1.044–5.464, p = 0.039) and access to Federal health care system (OR: 2.916, 95%CI: 1.081–7.866, p = 0.035) were associated to CAM use. Conclusions Patient´s perception of RA-related negative consequences was associated to recent CAM use in Hispanic RA outpatients."
https://openalex.org/W3049166042,"The serial feature-positive discrimination task requires the subjects to respond differentially to the identical stimulus depending on the temporal context given by a preceding cue stimulus. In the present study, we examined the involvement of the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors using a selective M1 antagonist VU0255035 in the serial feature-positive discrimination task of eyeblink conditioning in mice. In this task, mice received a 2-s light stimulus as the conditional cue 5 or 6 s before the presentation of a 350-ms tone conditioned stimulus (CS) paired with a 100-ms peri-orbital electrical shock (cued trials), while they did not receive the cue before the presentation of the CS alone (non-cued trials). Each day mice randomly received 30 cued and 30 non-cued trials. We found that VU0255035 impaired acquisition of the conditional discrimination as well as the overall acquisition of the conditioned response (CR) and diminished the difference in onset latency of the CR between the cued and non-cued trials. VU0255035 administration to the control mice after sufficient learning did not impair the pre-acquired conditional discrimination or the CR expression itself. These effects of VU0255035 were almost similar to those with the scopolamine in our previous study, suggesting that among the several types of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, the M1 receptors may play an important role in the acquisition of the conditional discrimination memory but not in mediating the discrimination itself after the memory had formed in the eyeblink serial feature-positive discrimination learning."
https://openalex.org/W3049184525,"This study aims to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with abdominal obesity in climacteric women assisted at Family Health Strategy units of the city of Montes Claros, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. It is a cross-sectional analytical study. The women were selected by probabilistic sampling from August 2014 to August 2015. A questionnaire containing information referring to sociodemographic and economic characteristics, behavioral characteristics and clinical data was used. To estimate abdominal obesity, the measure of circumference ≥ 88 cm was considered. To analyze the association between abdominal obesity and the independent variables, a bivariate analysis was performed by means of Pearson’s chi-square test (p≤0.25). Subsequently, a multiple Poisson regression analysis with robust variance was performed, through which prevalence ratios with level of significance of 5% (p<0.05) were obtained. A total of 805 women were evaluated, aged 40 to 65 years, and the prevalence of women with abdominal obesity was 62.4%. The mean and median of abdominal circumference were 93.0 cm. The associated variables were being sedentary (PR = 1.44) or irregularly active (PR = 1.39), presenting altered total cholesterol (PR = 1.21), and being hypertensive (PR = 1.31). The abdominal obesity in climacteric women was associated with physical inactivity, total cholesterol and arterial hypertension. The measurement of abdominal circumference must be valued and adopted in the routine of professionals who work in Primary Care."
https://openalex.org/W3049187892,"Managing difficult pediatric airway is challenging. The MultiViewScope (MVS) Stylet Scope is reported to be useful in difficult pediatric airway. In this randomized crossover study, we compared the effectiveness of the MVS Stylet Scope to a standard direct laryngoscope with Miller #1 blade in simulated normal and difficult airways.Fifteen expert anesthesiologists and Fifteen anesthesiology residents participated in the study. Participants were asked to perform intubation with the Airsim Baby manikin first, and then with the Airsim Pierre Robin manikin. Participants in each group used the intubation devices in a randomized order. The primary outcome was the time of successful intubation. The secondary outcomes were the force exerted on the incisors during intubation, Cormack-Lehane scale, the difficulty of intubation.There were no differences between MVS Stylet Scope and Direct laryngoscope in the time of successful intubation by the expert anesthesiologists or the anesthesiology residents in a normal or difficult pediatric airway. MVS Stylet Scope significantly improved the force exerted on the incisors during intubation in the expert anesthesiologists or the anesthesiology residents in a normal or difficult pediatric airway. MVS Stylet Scope significantly improved Cormack-Lehane scale, and the difficulty of intubation with difficult pediatric airway situation in both expert anesthesiologists and anesthesiology residents.Although less forces on the incisors and improved view of glottis were observed with the MVS Stylet Scope, MVS Stylet Scope did not shorten the time of intubation. The results of this study mean that the MVS Stylet Scope may be a less invasive airway devise than the direct laryngoscope with the Miller blade in the pediatric airway management. For the next step, we need to evaluate the MVS Stylet Scope in the real patients as an observational study."
https://openalex.org/W3049274607,"Child undernutrition results in poor growth in early childhood, undermines optimal development and increases the risk of mortality. Responsive feeding has been promoted as a key intervention for improving nutritional status, however measurement of this remains difficult and has rarely considered child behaviour. We therefore developed a new observed feeding tool to assess both child and caregiver behaviours, as well as their interaction during feeding, and investigate the effect of these on children anthropometric measures at 12-months of age in rural India.Our study was nested within the SPRING cluster-randomized controlled trial in Rewari, North India. Outcomes were children length-for-age (LAZ), weight-for-length (WLZ) and weight-for-age (WAZ) Z scores at 12 months of age, based on the WHO Child Growth standards. Trained non-specialists live-coded feeding episodes using the newly designed tool. Scores were then created using principal components analysis representing child behaviour, caregiver behaviour and caregiver-child interaction. Mixed effects linear regression was used to assess associations between feeding behaviours and anthropometric outcomes.857 children had a meal observation and were included. Anthropometric status was poor (mean length-for-age -1.59 (SD = 1.11); mean weight-for-length -0.58 (0.95); mean weight-for-age -1.22 (1.04)). There were positive linear differences in weight-for-length per unit increase in caregiver responsive behaviours score (adjusted β-coeff = 0.006, 95%CI = (0.001, 0.011), p = 0.01), in length-for-age and weight-for-age per unit increase in child responsive behaviours score (respectively adjusted β-coeff = 0.004, 95%CI = (0.001, 0.007), p = 0.02, and adjusted β-coeff = 0.003, 95%CI = (0.00001, 0.006), p = 0.049), and in both weight-for-length and weight-for-age per unit increase in caregiver-child interaction score (respectively adjusted β-coeff = 0.007, 95%CI = (0.003, 0.012), p = 0.001, and adjusted β-coeff = 0.005, 95%CI = (0.001, 0.011), p = 0.01). No association was seen between child behaviours and weight-for-length, caregiver behaviours and length and caregiver-child interaction and length.We found that trained non-specialists could assess feeding episodes using a newly designed checklist. Further, child and caregiver behaviours were associated with weight and length at only 12 months of age, a reminder of the importance of interventions to improve responsive feeding quality as we strive towards achievement of the sustainable development goals."
https://openalex.org/W3049684001,"Stepped-care (SC) models for anxiety disorders are implemented on a large scale and are assumed to be as effective for the greater majority of patients as more intensive treatment schemes. To compare the outcomes of SC and international guideline-based treatment (Treatment as Usual: TAU) for panic disorder, a total of 128 patients were randomized to either SC or TAU (ratio 2: 1, respectively) using a computer generated algorithm. They were treated in four mental health care centres in the Netherlands after therapists had been trained in SC by a senior expert therapist. SC comprised 10-week guided self-help (pen-and-paper version) followed, if indicated, by 13-week manualized face-to-face cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), with medication- if prescribed- kept constant. TAU consisted of 23-week regular face-to-face CBT (RCBT) with medication -when prescribed- also kept constant. The means of the attended sessions in the SC condition was 5.9 (SD = 4.8) for ITT and 9.6 (SD = 9.6) for the RCBT condition. The difference in the number of attended sessions between the conditions was significant (t(126) = -3.87, p < .001). Remission rates between treatment conditions did not differ significantly (SC: 44.5%; RCBT: 53.3%) and symptom reduction was similar. Stepping up SC treatment to face-to-face CBT showed a minimal additional effect. Importantly, drop-out rates differed significantly for the two conditions (SC: 48.2%; RCBT: 26.7%). SC was effective in the treatment of panic disorder in terms of symptom reduction and remission rate, but dropout rates were twice as high as those seen in RCBT, with the second phase of SC not substantially improving treatment response. However, SC required significantly less therapist contact time compared to RCBT, and more research is needed to explore predictors of success for guided self-help interventions to allow treatment intensity to be tailored to patients' needs and preferences."
https://openalex.org/W3049764331,"Mind wandering (MW) is a phenomenon in which attention drifts away from task-related thoughts toward task-unrelated thoughts. Recent studies have demonstrated that MW occurs during tasks in which participants are unmotivated. However, motivation ranges on a continuum from trait to state. We examined the association between trait-state motivation and trait-state MW. Participants (176 undergraduate students 18–24 years old; 68 male) completed three questionnaires for our trait level investigation. State level indices were measured using the experience sampling method with 104 students completing a sustained attention to response task. Through correlation analyses, we demonstrated an association between motivation and MW within the same dimension (trait and state, respectively) but found no association across dimensions in which the correlation coefficient was nearly zero. We show the significant association between motivation and MW whose novelty is especially evident in the trait level. Although the relationship between motivation and MW is substantial, trait-state dimensionality would be important for them. The state MW is a phasic phenomenon driven by a range of factors, one being state motivation. The causality and confounding factors remain to be further studied."
https://openalex.org/W3048969119,"While self-reported life satisfaction (LS) has become an important research and policy tool, much debate still surrounds the question of what causes LS to change in certain individuals, while not in others. Set-point theory argues that individuals have a relatively resilient LS or “set point” (i.e. there is a certain LS level that individuals return to even after major life events). Here, we describe the extent to which LS varies over time for 12,643 individuals living in Australia who participated in at least eight annual waves of the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey. We use the standard deviation (SD) of year-on-year LS by individuals (SD of LS) as a measure of instability and an inverse proxy for resilience. We then model SD of LS as the dependent variable against average LS scores over time by individual, Big Five personality scores by individual, the number of waves the individual participated in, and other control variables. We found that SD of LS was higher (lower resilience) in participants with a lower average LS and greater degrees of extraversion and agreeableness. Set-point theory thus applies more to individuals whose average LS is already high and whose personality traits facilitate higher resilience. We were able to explain about 35% of the stability in LS. These results are critical in designing policies aimed at improving people’s lives."
https://openalex.org/W3049190592,"Multiscale geometric analysis (MGA) is not only characterized by multi-resolution, time-frequency localization, multidirectionality and anisotropy, but also outdoes the limitations of wavelet transform in representing high-dimensional singular data such as edges and contours. Therefore, researchers have been exploring new MGA-based image compression standards rather than the JPEG2000 standard. However, due to the difference in terms of the data structure, redundancy and decorrelation between wavelet and MGA, as well as the complexity of the coding scheme, so far, no definitive researches have been reported on the MGA-based image coding schemes. In addressing this problem, this paper proposes an image data compression approach using the hidden Markov model (HMM)/pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN) model in the contourlet domain. First, a sparse decomposition of an image was performed using a contourlet transform to obtain the coefficients that show the multiscale and multidirectional characteristics. An HMM was then adopted to establish links between coefficients in neighboring subbands of different levels and directions. An Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm was also adopted in training the HMM in order to estimate the state probability matrix, which maintains the same structure of the contourlet decomposition coefficients. In addition, each state probability can be classified by the PCNN based on the state probability distribution. Experimental results show that the HMM/PCNN -contourlet model proposed in this paper leads to better compression performance and offer a more flexible encoding scheme."
https://openalex.org/W3049236892,"Classical value-based decision theories state that economic choices are solely based on the value of available options. Experimental evidence suggests, however, that individuals’ choices are biased towards default options, prompted by the framing of decisions. Although the effects of default options created by exogenous framing–such as how choice options are displayed–are well-documented, little is known about the potential effects and properties of endogenous framing, that is, originating from an individual's internal state. In this study, we investigated the existence and properties of endogenous default options in a task involving choices between risky lotteries. By manipulating and examining the effects of three experimental features–time pressure, time spent on task and relative choice proportion towards a specific option–, we reveal and dissociate two features of endogenous default options which bias individuals’ choices: a natural tendency to prefer certain types of options (natural default), and the tendency to implicitly learn a default option from past choices (learned default). Additional analyses suggest that while the natural default may bias the standard choice process towards an option category, the learned default effects may be attributable to a second independent choice process. Overall, these investigations provide a first experimental evidence of how individuals build and apply diverse endogenous default options in economic decision-making and how this biases their choices."
https://openalex.org/W3049669552,"Background Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among adult males globally. The poor prognosis of PCa is largely due to late diagnosis of the disease when it has already progressed to an advanced stage marked by androgen-independence, thus necessitating new strategies for early detection and treatment. We construe that these direly needed advances are limited by our poor understanding of early events in the progression of PCa and that would thus represent ideal targets for early intervention. To begin to fill this void, we interrogated molecular “oncophenotypes” that embody the transition of PCa from an androgen-dependent (AD) to–independent (AI) state. Methods To accomplish this aim, we used our previously established AD and AI murine PCa cell lines, PLum-AD and PLum-AI, respectively, which recapitulate primary and progressive PCa morphologically and molecularly. We statistically surveyed global gene expressions in these cell lines by microarray analysis. Differential profiles were functionally interrogated by pathways, gene set enrichment and topological gene network analyses. Results Gene expression analysis of PLum-AD and PLum-AI transcriptomes (n = 3 each), revealed 723 differentially expressed genes (392 upregulated and 331 downregulated) in PLum-AI compared to PLum-AD cells. Gene set analysis demonstrated enrichment of biological functions and pathways in PLum-AI cells that are central to tumor aggressiveness including cell migration and invasion facilitated by epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Further analysis demonstrated that the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was predicted to be significantly activated in the PLum-AI cells, whereas gene sets previously associated with favorable response to the p38 inhibitor SB203580 were attenuated (i.e., inversely enriched) in the PLum-AI cells, suggesting that these aggressive cells may be therapeutically vulnerable to p38 inhibition. Gene set and gene-network analysis also alluded to activation of other signaling networks particularly those associated with enhanced EMT, inflammation and immune function/response including, but not limited to Tnf, IL-6, Mmp 2, Ctgf, and Ptges. Accordingly, we chose SB203580 and IL-6 to validate their effect on PLum-AD and PLum-AI. Some of the common genes identified in the gene-network analysis were validated at the molecular and functional level. Additionally, the vulnerability to SB203580 and the effect of IL-6 were also validated on the stem/progenitor cell population using the sphere formation assay. Conclusions In summary, our study highlights pathways associated with an augmented malignant phenotype in AI cells and presents new high-potential targets to constrain the aggressive malignancy seen in the castration-resistant PCa."
https://openalex.org/W3049679258,"Backgrounds Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality all over the globe. Inflammation is believed to play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of CVD. While there are studies on the interrelationship of telomerase and vitamin D and their involvement in CVD, their independent contributions to long-term outcomes in patients with CVD are not well-defined. This study aimed to investigate the association of both telomerase and vitamin D concentrations with 10-year survival among candidates of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. Methods Participants were 404 patients from Tehran Heart Center-Coronary Outcome Measurement (THC-COM) cohort who were recruited from CABG surgery candidates in 2006. In addition to demographic and clinical data including risk factors for coronary artery disease, laboratory parameters such as markers of inflammation as well as baseline serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] and telomerase concentrations were measured. Cardiac function indexes alongside outcome measures such as mortality and survival days were recorded for every patient up to 10 years after CABG. Cox-proportional hazard model was used to study the association between all-cause mortality and research parameters. Results The mean serum telomerase enzyme level was 24.92 ±21.4 nmol/L and the mean serum 25(OH)D was 27.27±10.3 ng/mL. 10-year mortality was reported in 64 (15.8%) patients. 25(OH)D was categorized into three groups (<20, 20–30, and >30) and the cut-point for telomerase was set at 25.0 nmol/L. In Cox regression analysis, higher levels of telomerase (>25 nmol/L) were significantly associated with longer survival (p = 0.041), whereas 25(OH)D concentrations were not associated with survival time. Further analysis showed that telomerase concentrations significantly predicted survival only in the presence of insufficient levels of 25(OH)D (20–30 ng/mL) (p = 0.037). Conclusions Telomerase can be regarded as a potential predictor of long-term outcomes in patients who underwent CABG. However, the association of telomerase with the mortality may be modified by vitamin D concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W3048648838,"While metapopulation theory offers tractable means to understand extinction risks for patchily-distributed endangered species, real systems often feature discrepant patch quality and accessibility, complex influences of environmental stochasticity, and regional and temporal autocorrelation. Spatially structured metapopulation models are flexible and can use real data but often at the cost of generality. Particularly as resources for management of such species are often critically limited, endangered species management guided by metapopulation modeling requires incorporation of biological realism. Here we developed a flexible, stochastic spatially structured metapopulation model of the profoundly endangered Amargosa vole, a microtine rodent with an extant population of only a few hundred individuals within 1km2 of habitat in the Mojave Desert. Drought and water insecurity are increasing extinction risks considerably. We modelled subpopulation demographics using a Ricker-like model with migration implemented in an incidence function metapopulation model. A set of scenarios was used to assess the effect of anthropogenic stressors or management actions on expected time to extinction (Te) including: 1) wildland fire, 2) anthropogenically-mediated losses of hydrologic flows, 3) drought, 4) intentional expansion of existing patches into ‘megamarshes’ (i.e. via restoration/enhancement), and 5) additive impacts of multiple influences. In isolation, marshes could be sources or sinks, but spatial context within the full metapopulation including adjacency could alter relative impacts of subpopulations on all other subpopulations. The greatest reductions in persistence occurred in scenarios simulated with impacts from drought in combination with fire or anthropogenically-mediated losses of hydrologic flows. Optimal actions to improve persistence were to prevent distant and smaller marshes from acting as sinks through strategic creation of megamarshes that act as sources of voles and stepping-stones. This research reinforces that management resources expended without guidance from empirically-based modeling can actually harm species’ persistence. This metapopulation-PVA tool could easily be implemented for other patchily-distributed endangered species and allow managers to maximize scarce resources to improve the likelihood of endangered species persistence."

The portable rescue device could be used in clinical applications in outbreaks of viral pneumonia such as SARS. To reduce energy consumption for battery-powered portable usage, NO micro-channel plasma reactions induced by a continuous discharge arc were employed. A single-use airway tube could be combined with an intubation tube in clinical applications. In the experiment, a switching transistor controlled high frequency DC (12.5 kHz) was used to create a continuous discharge arc between two stainless steel electrodes (1-mm separation) after high-voltage breakthrough. A rotate instrument was employed to change the direction angle between the airflow and discharge arc, tube filled with Calcium hydroxide connected with gas outlet for reducing NO2, gas flow rate and input voltage were evaluated separately with concentration of NO and NO2/NO ratio. Results showed that a 2 L/min air flow direction from the cathode to the anode of electrodes (direction angle was zero) under 4 V input voltages produced 32.5±3.8 ppm NO, and the NO2/NO ratio reduced to less than 10%, stable output of nitric oxide might be convenient and effective for NO inhalation therapy. Modularization of the design produced a portable NO inhalation device that has potential for use in clinical applications as it is low cost, easy to disinfect, consumes low levels of energy and is ready to use."

There is less evidence on prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and nutrition and growth in HIV-infected and -exposed children in low- and middle-income countries. Objectives To determine the vitamin D status in Batswana HIV-infected mothers and their children, differences among HIV-infected mothers and between HIV-exposed and -infected infants and children, and associations between vitamin D and disease-related outcomes, nutrition, and growth. Methods This was a cross-sectional study of HIV+ mothers and HIV-exposed infants and unrelated children (1–7.9 years). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) was measured, among other nutritional indicators, for mothers, infants and children. Vitamin D status for HIV-infected mothers and children, and an immune panel was assessed. History of HIV anti-retroviral medications and breastfeeding were obtained. Data were collected prior to universal combination antiretroviral therapy in pregnancy. Results Mothers (n = 36) had a mean serum 25(OH)D of 37.2±12.4ng/mL; 11% had insufficient (<20ng/mL), 17% moderately low (20.0–29.9ng/mL) and 72% sufficient (≥30ng/mL) concentrations. No infants (n = 36) or children (n = 48) were vitamin D insufficient; 22% of HIV- and no HIV+ infants had moderately low concentrations and 78% of HIV- and 100% of HIV+ infants had sufficient status, 8% of HIV- and no HIV+ children had moderately low concentrations and 92% of HIV- and 100% HIV+ children had sufficient concentrations. HIV+ children had significantly lower length/height Z scores compared to HIV- children. Length/height Z score was positively correlated with serum 25(OH)D in all children (r = 0.33, p = 0.023), with a stronger correlation in the HIV+ children (r = 0.47 p = 0.021). In mothers, serum 25(OH)D was positively associated with CD4% (r = 0.40, p = 0.016). Conclusions Results showed a low prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in Botswana. Growth was positively correlated with vitamin D status in HIV-exposed children, and HIV+ children had poorer linear growth than HIV- children."
https://openalex.org/W3049488647,"Serotonin is a neurotransmitter synthesized by the amino acid tryptophan, that has the potential to impact the behaviour and activity of dogs. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of supplemental tryptophan and a 12-week incremental training regimen on the voluntary activity and behaviour of client-owned Siberian Huskies. Sixteen dogs were blocked for age, BW and sex and then randomly allocated to either the control or treatment group. Both groups were fed the same dry extruded diet; however, the treatment group were supplemented with tryptophan to achieve a tryptophan: large neutral amino acid ratio of 0.075:1. Once a week, a 5-minute video recording was taken immediately pre- and post- exercise to evaluate dogs’ behaviours. Activity monitors were used to record voluntary activity on both training and rest days. Linear regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between training week and time spent performing each behaviour. Additionally, a repeated measure mixed model was used to test differences between diet groups and training week for both behavioural and activity count data. The time spent performing agonistic behaviours prior to exercise was negatively associated with week for treatment dogs (β = -0.32, 95% CI [-0.55, -0.10], P < 0.05) and no change was observed for control dogs (β = -0.13, 95% CI [-0.41, 0.15], P > 0.10). Treatment did not have any effect on activity levels (P > 0.10). For all dogs, locomotive behaviours decreased prior to exercise as weeks progressed (P < 0.05), while run day voluntary activity depended on the distance run that day (P < 0.05). These data suggest that sled dogs experience an exercise-induced reduction in voluntary locomotion in response to both single bouts and repetitive bouts of exercise. Additionally, tryptophan supplementation may decrease agonistic behaviours, without having any effect on voluntary activity."
https://openalex.org/W3049047618,"Patients’ vitamin intake is often not documented and is therefore not considered sufficiently in studies of prescribed medication in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We aimed to determine the prevalence of vitamin use by participants in ALS clinical trials. Data about demographics, disease severity (ALS Functional Rating Scale) and concomitant medication were obtained from the Pooled Resource Open-Access ALS Clinical Trials Database, which contains records from more than 6000 ALS patients who participated in 23 phase II/III clinical trials. Information about vitamin intake for all study subjects was coded into major categories. Clinical data of vitamin users and nonusers were compared, and regression analysis was used to explore the associations among clinical parameters, vitamin use and two measures of disease progression. From the 40.996 available medication records from 6274 subjects, 7338 (17.9%) concerned vitamins. One or more vitamins were used by 3331 subjects (53.1%). Most common was vitamin E, vitamin C and multivitamins. Patients who did and did not take vitamins did not differ in terms of disease progression and ALS Functional Rating Scale score. Patients who took vitamins were younger, were more often female, had a shorter time between onset and diagnosis, had shorter disease duration and more frequently had limb-onset types. Disease progression rate and disease aggressiveness were not associated with vitamin use. Despite unclear evidence, the use of vitamins in ALS is common. However, rapid progression was not observed to be associated with vitamin use."
https://openalex.org/W3049239202,"Reducing energy consumption has become a critical issue in today data centers. Reducing the number of required physical and Virtual Machines results in energy-efficiency. In this paper, to avoid the disadvantages of VM migration, a static VM placement algorithm is proposed which places VMs on hosts in a Worst-Fit-Decreasing (WFD) fashion. To reduce energy consumption further, the effect of job scheduling policy on the number of VMs needed for maintaining QoS requirements is studied. Each VM is modeled by an M/M/* queue in space-shared, time-shared, and hybrid job scheduling policies, and energy consumption of real-time as well as non-real-time applications is analyzed. Numerical results show that the hybrid policy outperforms space-shared and time-shared policies, in terms of energy consumption as well as Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations. Moreover, our non-migration method outperforms three different algorithms which use VM migration, in terms of reducing both energy consumption and SLA Violations."
https://openalex.org/W3049253585,"The hepatitis B virus (HBV) envelope is composed of a lipid bilayer and three glycoproteins, referred to as the large (L), middle (M), and small (S) hepatitis B virus surface antigens (HBsAg). S protein constitutes the major portion of the viral envelope and an even greater proportion of subviral particles (SVP) that circulate in the blood. Recombinant S proteins are currently used as a preventive vaccine, while plasma fractions isolated from vaccinated people, referred to as hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG), are used for short-term prophylaxis. Here, we characterized a recombinant human IgG1 type anti-S antibody named Lenvervimab regarding its binding property to a variety of cloned S antigens. Immunochemical data showed an overall consistent avidity of the antibody to S antigens of most viral genotypes distributed worldwide. Further, antibody binding was not affected by the mutations in the antigenic ‘a’ determinant found in many clinical variants, including the immune escape mutant G145R. In addition, mutations in the S gene sequence that confer drug resistance to the viral polymerase did not interfere with the antibody binding. These results support for a preventive use of the antibody against HBV infection."
https://openalex.org/W3049444955,"Background With the development of second-generation sequencing technology, more and more DNA sequence variations have been detected. Exon sequencing is the first choice for sequencing many cancer genes, and it can be better used to identify disease status by detecting gene variants. PCR sequence is an effective method to capture that sequence of an exon in the process of sequencing. Exon sequencing sequence contains PCR primer sequence, the correct position of the sequence can be determined by PCR primer sequence, which can be found in SNP, Indel mutation point by comparing the sequence of PCR primer sequence. Results In this paper, a matching algorithm based on the PCR primer sequence is proposed, which can effectively sequence the position of PCR primer sequence and find out the key position sequence. Then the sequencing sequence is sorted and the number of the same sequence is counted to reduce the matching times. Then, the sequenced sequence was matched with PCR primer sequence, so that the DNA position could be accurately matched and the variation in the sequenced sequence could be found more quickly. Conclusions Compared with the traditional sequence matching method, PCR primer sequence matching method can match many sequences and find more variation. It also showed a high recall rate in the recall rate."
https://openalex.org/W3049446128,"Genome duplication leads to an emergence of gene paralogs that are essentially free to undergo the process of neofunctionalization, subfunctionalization or degeneration (gene loss). Onecut1 (Oc1) and Onecut2 (Oc2) transcription factors, encoded by paralogous genes in mammals, are expressed in precursors of horizontal cells (HCs), retinal ganglion cells and cone photoreceptors. Previous studies have shown that ablation of either Oc1 or Oc2 gene in the mouse retina results in a decreased number of HCs, while simultaneous deletion of Oc1 and Oc2 leads to a complete loss of HCs. Here we study the genetic redundancy between Oc1 and Oc2 paralogs and focus on how the dose of Onecut transcription factors influences abundance of individual retinal cell types and overall retina physiology. Our data show that reducing the number of functional Oc alleles in the developing retina leads to a gradual decrease in the number of HCs, progressive thinning of the outer plexiform layer and diminished electrophysiology responses. Taken together, these observations indicate that in the context of HC population, the alleles of Oc1/Oc2 paralogous genes are mutually interchangeable, function additively to support proper retinal function and their molecular evolution does not follow one of the typical routes after gene duplication."
https://openalex.org/W3049651437,"Falls pose a serious problem in elderly and clinical populations. Most often, they lead to a loss of mobility and independence. They might also be an indirect cause of death. The aim of this study was to determine an objective predictor of the fear of falling and falls in elderly subjects (ESs) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) subjects. Thirty-two ESs were examined in this study, of whom sixteen were diagnosed with PD. The testing procedures comprised force plate measurements (limit of stability test–LOS test) and clinical tests (Berg Balance Scale, Functional Reach Test, Timed Up and Go test, Tinetti test). The Falls Efficacy Scale International (FES-I) was used to evaluate the fear of falling. The range of the maximum forward lean was normalized to the length from the ankle joint to the head of the first metatarsal bone and was named the functional forward stability indicator (FFSI). The FFSI, derived from the LOS test, allowed us to demonstrate the real deficit in functional stability and individual safety margins. Moreover, the FFSI was highly correlated with the FES-I score and almost all clinical test results in elderly subjects (r>0,6; p<0.05). In PD subjects, the FFSI was poorly correlated with the fear of falling, the BBS score and the FR distance; however, a high correlation with the Tinetii test (r>0,6, p<0.05) was noted. The PD subjects presented a different balance strategy when close to their stability limits, which was also reflected in the lower values of sample entropy (t = (-2.40); p<0.05; d = 0.87). The FFSI might be a good predictor of the fear of falling in the group of elderly people. Additionally, the FFSI allows us to show real balance deficits both in PD subjects and in their healthy peers without the need for a reference group and norms. In conclusion, it is postulated that the popular clinical assessments of postural balance in PD subjects should be accompanied by reliable posturography measurements."
https://openalex.org/W3049575913,"Background and aims Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) against hepatitis C virus (HCV) exert high anti-HCV activity and are expected to show anti-inflammatory effects associated with HCV elimination. Furthermore, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is known to dedifferentiate from hypovascular tumors, such as dysplastic nodules or well-differentiated HCC, to hypervascular tumors. We therefore explored whether or not DAAs can suppress the growth and hypervascularization of hypovascular tumors. Methods We enrolled 481 patients with HCV genotype 1 infection who were treated with Daclatasvir and Asunaprevir therapy. Of these, 29 patients had 33 hypovascular tumors, which were confirmed by contrast-enhanced MRI or CT before therapy. We prospectively analyzed the cumulative incidence of HCC, i.e. the growth or hypervascularization of hypovascular tumors, and compared the HCC development rates between patients with hypovascular tumors and those without any tumors. Results The mean size of the hypovascular tumors was 11.3 mm. Twenty seven of 29 patients who achieved an SVR had 31 nodules, 19 of 31 nodules (61.3%) showed tumor growth or hypervascularization, and 12 (38.7%) nodules showed no change or improvement. The cumulative incidence rates of tumor growth or hypervascularization were 19.4% at 1 year, 36.0% at 2 years, 56.6% at 3 years, and 65.3% at 4 years. Among the patients who achieved a sustained virologic response, the cumulative HCC development rates of patients with hypovascular tumors was significantly higher than in those without any tumors. A Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that a history of HCC therapy, the presence of a hypovascular tumor, and AFP >4.6 ng/mL at the end of treatment were independent risk factors for HCC development. Conclusion Hypovascular tumors developed into HCC at a high rate despite the elimination of HCV by DAAs. As patients with hypovascular tumors were shown to have a high risk of HCC development, they should undergo strict HCC surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W3049633142,"In the past decade, two leptospirosis outbreaks occurred among strawberry harvesters in Germany, with 13, and 45 reported cases respectively. In both outbreaks, common voles (Microtus arvalis) infected with Leptospira kischneri serovar Grippotyphosa were identified as the most likely outbreak source. In an univariate analysis, eating unwashed strawberries was identified as one of the risk factors associated with Leptospira infection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the survival time of L. kirschneri serovar Grippotyphosa on strawberries under varying conditions. Strawberries were spiked with 5x109 of both a laboratory reference strain (strain Moskva V) and an outbreak field strain (94-6/2007) of L. kirschneri serovar Grippotyphosa sequence type 110. Survival times were investigated in a fully crossed design with three incubation times (2h, 4h, 6h and 8h) and three temperatures (15°C, 21°C and 25°C) with three replicated for each condition. A wash protocol was developed and recovered Leptospira were determined by qPCR, dark field microscopy and culturing. Viable L. kirschneri of both the reference strain and the field strain were identified in all samples at 25°C and an incubation time of 2h, but only 1/9 (11%) and 4/9 (44%) of the samples incubated at 15°C were positive, respectively. Both reference and field strain were viable only in 2/9 (22%) at 25° after 6h. After an 8h incubation, viable Leptospira could not be identified on the surface of the strawberries or within the fruit for any of the tested conditions. Based on these results, the exposure risk of consumers to viable Leptospira spp. through the consumption of strawberries bought at the retail level is most likely very low. However, there is a potential risk of Leptospira infection by consumption of strawberries on pick-your-own farms."
https://openalex.org/W3049316193,"Background HIV screening (i.e. antigen/antibody) tests are followed by a supplemental (i.e. antibody-only) if the screen is positive. Discrepant results can result from two scenarios: a false-positive screening test or acute HIV infection. These scenarios can be distinguished by a molecular HIV test, but due to contamination concerns, our laboratory recently implemented a policy requiring a second specimen dedicated for molecular HIV testing. Our objective was to (1) characterize the effect of this policy on the time-to-diagnosis for patients with discrepant screening and supplemental test results, and (2) explore “strength of positivity” as an interim predictor of screening test accuracy while awaiting confirmatory test results. Methods Data from our laboratory information system, electronic health record, and instrument logs were used to collate data for all HIV testing performed at Barnes-Jewish Hospital (BJH) between January 1, 2014 and October 18, 2017. Results Requiring a dedicated specimen for molecular testing significantly increased the time-to-diagnosis for patients with discrepant screening and supplemental HIV tests (p = 0.0084). This policy also contributed to loss-to-followup, with 0/35 discrepant cases lost-to-followup prior to policy implementation compared to 2/10 after implementation. However, by optimizing the signal-to-cutoff (S/CO) ratio of the screening test, we were able to more accurately distinguish false-positives from acute-HIV prior to molecular testing (sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 89%). Conclusions We propose utilizing quantitative fourth-generation assay results (S/CO) ratios as a predictor of infection true positivity in situations where the screening assay is reactive but the supplemental test is negative and confirmatory molecular results are not immediately available."
https://openalex.org/W3049349197,"Introduction Heterosexual infections have contributed to a high proportion of the HIV burden in Asia and Eastern Europe. Human mobility and non-local infections are important features in some cities/countries. An understanding of the determinants of the sustained growth of the heterosexual HIV epidemics would enable the potential impacts of treatment-based interventions to be assessed. Methods We developed a compartmental model for heterosexual HIV transmissions, parameterized by clinical and surveillance data (1984–2014) in Hong Kong. HIV sequence data were included for examining genetic linkages and clustering pattern. We performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate effects of high-risk sexual partnership and proportions of non-locally acquired infections. Four hypothetical interventions (a) immediate treatment, (b) enhancement of retention in care, (c) HIV testing campaigns, and (d) test-and-treat strategy, were examined. Results Data of 2174 patients (723 female and 1451 male) diagnosed with HIV between 1984 and 2012 in Hong Kong were collected for model parameterization. Among 1229 sequences of non-MSM (men who have sex with men) patients, 70% were isolates and 17% were either dyads or triads. In base-case scenario, the total estimated number of new infections in 2012–2023 would be 672 for male and 452 for female. Following 100% retention in care intervention, the total proportion of averted new infections in 2012–2023 would be 7% for male and 10% for female. HIV testing campaign in 2012 and 2017 followed by 100% immediate treatment strategy would avert 5% and 9% of male and female new infections, respectively. In the epidemic model, an increase of high-risk sexual partnership from 6% to 9% would increase the epidemic growth (annual number of newly diagnosed and newly infected cases) by about 10%. If no non-locally acquired infection occurred as from 2012, the epidemic growth would slump. To control the heterosexual epidemic, periodic HIV testing at 5-year intervals with immediate treatment would avert 5–13% of annual new infections in 2013–2023. Conclusions Enhanced HIV testing with immediate treatment is most effective in controlling the heterosexual epidemic, the impacts of which might however be attenuated by any increase of non-locally acquired infection, assuming little variations of high risk partnership over time."
