https://openalex.org/W2147151051,"In monolayer graphene, substitutional doping during growth can be used to alter its electronic properties. We used scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), Raman spectroscopy, x-ray spectroscopy, and first principles calculations to characterize individual nitrogen dopants in monolayer graphene grown on a copper substrate. Individual nitrogen atoms were incorporated as graphitic dopants, and a fraction of the extra electron on each nitrogen atom was delocalized into the graphene lattice. The electronic structure of nitrogen-doped graphene was strongly modified only within a few lattice spacings of the site of the nitrogen dopant. These findings show that chemical doping is a promising route to achieving high-quality graphene films with a large carrier concentration."

https://openalex.org/W2166791809,"The mammalian nervous system comprises many distinct neuronal subtypes, each with its own phenotype and differential sensitivity to degenerative disease. Although specific neuronal types can be isolated from rodent embryos or engineered from stem cells for translational studies, transcription factor-mediated reprogramming might provide a more direct route to their generation. Here we report that the forced expression of select transcription factors is sufficient to convert mouse and human fibroblasts into induced motor neurons (iMNs). iMNs displayed a morphology, gene expression signature, electrophysiology, synaptic functionality, in vivo engraftment capacity, and sensitivity to degenerative stimuli similar to those of embryo-derived motor neurons. We show that the converting fibroblasts do not transit through a proliferative neural progenitor state, and thus form bona fide motor neurons via a route distinct from embryonic development. Our findings demonstrate that fibroblasts can be converted directly into a specific differentiated and functional neural subtype, the spinal motor neuron."
https://openalex.org/W2168092724,"The unfolded protein response (UPR) detects the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and adjusts the protein-folding capacity to the needs of the cell. Under conditions of ER stress, the transmembrane protein Ire1 oligomerizes to activate its cytoplasmic kinase and ribonuclease domains. It is unclear what feature of ER stress Ire1 detects. We found that the core ER-lumenal domain (cLD) of yeast Ire1 binds to unfolded proteins in yeast cells and to peptides primarily composed of basic and hydrophobic residues in vitro. Mutation of amino acid side chains exposed in a putative peptide-binding groove of Ire1 cLD impaired peptide binding. Peptide binding caused Ire1 cLD oligomerization in vitro, suggesting that direct binding to unfolded proteins activates the UPR."

To investigate one mechanism by which aneuploidy could contribute to tumorigenesis, we examined the effects of aneuploidy on genomic stability. We analyzed 13 budding yeast strains that carry extra copies of single chromosomes and found that all aneuploid strains exhibited one or more forms of genomic instability. Most strains displayed increased chromosome loss and mitotic recombination, as well as defective DNA damage repair. Aneuploid fission yeast strains also exhibited defects in mitotic recombination. Aneuploidy-induced genomic instability could facilitate the development of genetic alterations that drive malignant growth in cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2072248889,"Curricular enhancements in early childhood education that are guided by the science of learning must be augmented by protective interventions informed by the biology of adversity. The same neuroplasticity that leaves emotional regulation, behavioral adaptation, and executive functioning skills vulnerable to early disruption by stressful environments also enables their successful development through focused interventions during sensitive periods in their maturation. The early childhood field should therefore combine cognitive-linguistic enrichment with greater attention to preventing, reducing, or mitigating the consequences of significant adversity on the developing brain. Guided by this enhanced theory of change, scientists, practitioners, and policy-makers must work together to design, implement, and evaluate innovative strategies to produce substantially greater impacts than those achieved by existing programs."

https://openalex.org/W2009069495,"Lithium-coordinated polyaromatic anions such as tetrareduced corannulene, C(20)H(10)(4-) (1(4-)), are useful substrates to model and ultimately improve the graphitic electrodes in lithium-ion (Li(+)) batteries. Previous studies suggested that 1(4-) forms dimers encasing four Li(+) ions in solution. Here, we report a single-crystal x-ray diffraction analysis confirming the formation of a sandwich-type supramolecular aggregate with a high degree of alkali metal intercalation. In contrast to the prior model, our data reveal that five Li(+) ions are sandwiched between the two tetrareduced corannulene decks, and (7)Li nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy delineates a conserved structure in tetrahydrofuran solution. Remarkably, the sandwich is robust in both solution and solid states even in the presence of crown ethers that compete for Li(+) coordination. These results should help elucidate Li(+) intercalation motifs between curved carbon surfaces more broadly."

https://openalex.org/W2164894446,"Sunspots are regions where strong magnetic fields emerge from the solar interior and where major eruptive events occur. These energetic events can cause power outages, interrupt telecommunication and navigation services, and pose hazards to astronauts. We detected subsurface signatures of emerging sunspot regions before they appeared on the solar disc. Strong acoustic travel-time anomalies of an order of 12 to 16 seconds were detected as deep as 65,000 kilometers. These anomalies were associated with magnetic structures that emerged with an average speed of 0.3 to 0.6 kilometer per second and caused high peaks in the photospheric magnetic flux rate 1 to 2 days after the detection of the anomalies. Thus, synoptic imaging of subsurface magnetic activity may allow anticipation of large sunspot regions before they become visible, improving space weather forecast."
https://openalex.org/W2101978443,"There are seven linker histone variants in human somatic cells (H1.0 to H1.5 and H1X), and their prevalence varies as a function of cell type and differentiation stage, suggesting that the different variants may have distinct roles. We have revisited this notion by using new methodologies to study pluripotency and differentiation, including the in vitro differentiation of human embryonic stem (ES) and teratocarcinoma cells and the reprogramming of keratinocytes to induced pluripotent stem cells. Our results show that pluripotent cells (PCs) have decreased levels of H1.0 and increased levels of H1.1, H1.3, and H1.5 compared with differentiated cells. PCs have a more diverse repertoire of H1 variants, whereas in differentiated cells, H1.0 expression represents ∼80% of the H1 transcripts. In agreement with their prevalent expression in ES cells, the regulatory regions of H1.3 and H1.5 genes were found to be occupied by pluripotency factors. Moreover, the H1.0 gene promoter contains bivalent domains (H3K4me2 and H3K27me3) in PCs, suggesting that this variant is likely to have an important role during differentiation. Indeed, the knockdown of H1.0 in human ES did not affect self-renewal but impaired differentiation. Accordingly, H1.0 was recruited to the regulatory regions of differentiation and pluripotency genes during differentiation, confirming that this histone variant plays a critical role in the regulation of these genes. Thus, histone H1 variant expression is controlled by a variety of mechanisms that produce distinct but consistent H1 repertoires in pluripotent and differentiated cells that appear critical to maintain the functionality of such cells.

https://openalex.org/W1966610248,"Following the onset of an ischemic brain injury, the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate is released. The excitotoxic effects of glutamate are a major contributor to the pathogenesis of a stroke. The aim of this study was to examine if overexpression of a glutamate transporter (GLT-1) reduces ischemic brain injury in a rat model of stroke. We generated an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector expressing the rat GLT-1 cDNA (AAV-GLT1). Functional expression of AAV-GLT1 was confirmed by increased glutamate clearance rate in non-stroke rat brain as measured by in vivo amperometry. AAV-GLT1 was injected into future cortical region of infarction 3 weeks prior to 60 min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). Tissue damage was assessed at one and two days after MCAo using TUNEL and TTC staining, respectively. Behavioral testing was performed at 2, 8 and 14 days post-stroke. Animals receiving AAV-GLT1, compared to AAV-GFP, showed significant decreases in the duration and magnitude of extracellular glutamate, measured by microdialysis, during the 60 minute MCAo. A significant reduction in brain infarction and DNA fragmentation was observed in the region of AAV-GLT1 injection. Animals that received AAV-GLT1 showed significant improvement in behavioral recovery following stroke compared to the AAV-GFP group. We demonstrate that focal overexpression of the glutamate transporter, GLT-1, significantly reduces ischemia-induced glutamate overflow, decreases cell death and improves behavioral recovery. These data further support the role of glutamate in the pathogenesis of ischemic damage in brain and demonstrate that targeted gene delivery to decrease the ischemia-induced glutamate overflow reduces the cellular and behavioral deficits caused by stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2039207601,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is associated with extracellular deposition of proteolytic fragments of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Although mutations in APP and proteases that mediate its processing are known to result in familial, early onset forms of AD, the mechanisms underlying the more common sporadic, yet genetically complex forms of the disease are still unclear. Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the ubiquilin-1 gene have been shown to be genetically associated with AD, implicating its gene product in the pathogenesis of late onset AD. However, genetic linkage between ubiquilin-1 and AD has not been confirmed in studies examining different populations. Here we show that regardless of genotype, ubiquilin-1 protein levels are significantly decreased in late onset AD patient brains, suggesting that diminished ubiquilin function may be a common denominator in AD progression. Our interrogation of putative ubiquilin-1 activities based on sequence similarities to proteins involved in cellular quality control showed that ubiquilin-1 can be biochemically defined as a bona fide molecular chaperone and that this activity is capable of preventing the aggregation of amyloid precursor protein both in vitro and in live neurons. Furthermore, we show that reduced activity of ubiquilin-1 results in augmented production of pathogenic amyloid precursor protein fragments as well as increased neuronal death. Our results support the notion that ubiquilin-1 chaperone activity is necessary to regulate the production of APP and its fragments and that diminished ubiquilin-1 levels may contribute to AD pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2045564809,"N-Linked glycosylation is a frequent protein modification that occurs in all three domains of life. This process involves the transfer of a preassembled oligosaccharide from a lipid donor to asparagine side chains of polypeptides and is catalyzed by the membrane-bound oligosaccharyltransferase (OST). We characterized an alternative bacterial pathway wherein a cytoplasmic N-glycosyltransferase uses nucleotide-activated monosaccharides as donors to modify asparagine residues of peptides and proteins. N-Glycosyltransferase is an inverting glycosyltransferase and recognizes the NX(S/T) consensus sequence. It therefore exhibits similar acceptor site specificity as eukaryotic OST, despite the unrelated predicted structural architecture and the apparently different catalytic mechanism.

https://openalex.org/W2078249788,"Parkinson disease (PD)- and cancer-associated protein, DJ-1, mediates cellular protection via many signaling pathways. Deletions or mutations in the DJ-1 gene are directly linked to autosomal recessive early-onset PD. DJ-1 has potential roles in mitochondria. Here, we show that DJ-1 increases its mitochondrial distribution in response to ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation and binds to Bcl-XL. The interactions between DJ-1 and Bcl-XL are oxidation-dependent. DJ-1(C106A), a mutant form of DJ-1 that is unable to be oxidized, binds Bcl-XL much less than DJ-1 does. Moreover, DJ-1 stabilizes Bcl-XL protein level by inhibiting its ubiquitination and degradation through ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) in response to UVB irradiation. Furthermore, under UVB irradiation, knockdown of DJ-1 leads to increases of Bcl-XL ubiquitination and degradation upon UVB irradiation, thereby increasing mitochondrial Bax, caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage. These data suggest that DJ-1 protects cells against UVB-induced cell death dependent on its oxidation and its association with mitochondrial Bcl-XL.

In our present study, we show that Bcl-XL, a protein primarily localized in the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), is a novel partner of DJ-1 under UVB irradiation. DJ-1 stabilizes Bcl-XL protein to protect cells under UVB irradiation. Our results show that the regulation of Bcl-XL by DJ-1 may play roles in the control of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). H1299 cells were cultured in RPMI medium 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Cells were transfected with expression plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. H1299 cells stably expressing EGFP-Bcl-XL were obtained by a limiting dilution and a selection with 200 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) after transfection. The culture medium was removed just prior to irradiation and replaced with a thin layer of phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH 7.4) to cover the cells. Then, HEK293 or H1299 cells were exposed to UVB irradiation (312 nm) with a UV crosslinker (SCIENTZ03-II, Ningbo, China). After UVB irradiation, the cells were fed fresh culture medium and returned to culture for 16 h. After culturing, the treated cells were subjected to additional experiments. si-DJ-1328 was described previously (29Ren H. Fu K. Mu C. Li B. Wang D. Wang G. Cancer Lett. 2010; 297: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). siRNA against human Bcl-XL mRNA was synthesized by GenePharma (GenePharma, Shanghai, China) with the following sequences: sense: 5′-GAGAUGCAGGUAUUGGUGATT-3′, antisense: 5′-UCACCAAUACCUGCAUCUCTT-3′. The oligonucleotides were transfected with Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cultured cells were washed with Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) and then transfected with siRNA using Oligofectamine reagent in Opti-MEM medium without serum. Six hours after transfection, the culture medium was replaced with fresh complete medium. The cells were subjected to further experiments 72 h after transfection. Full-length DJ-1 in p3×Flag-myc-cmv-24, pET-15b and pGEX-5x-1 were described previously (30Fan J. Ren H. Jia N. Fei E. Zhou T. Jiang P. Wu M. Wang G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4022-4030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). pDsRed-N1-DJ-1 was generated by subcloning the PCR product amplified with the primers 5′-CGGGATCCCCATGGCTTCCAAAAGAAG-3′ and 5′-CGCTCGAGCTGCTGGAGTCTTTAAGAAC-3′ into pDsRed-N1 at its BglII/SalI sites. DJ-1(C106A) was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis with the following primers: 5′-GCTGCAGGTCCTACTGCT-3′ and 5′-GATGGCGGCTATCAG-3′. Full length Bcl2 cDNA was amplified from a human fetal brain cDNA library (Clonetech) with the primers 5′-CGGAATTCAATATGGCGCACGCTG-3′ and 5′-GCGTCGACTCACTTGTGGCCCAG-3′ and then inserted into pET-21a at its EcoRI/SalI sites. A full-length Bax cDNA was amplified from a human fetal brain cDNA library (Clonetech) with the primers 5′-CGGAATTCATGGACGGGTCCGGGGA-3′ and 5′-CCCTCGAGCAGCCCATCTTCTTCCAGA-3′ and then inserted into pET-21a at its EcoRI/XhoI sites. Full-length Bcl-XL cDNA was amplified from a human fetal brain cDNA library (Clontech) with the primers 5′-CGGAATTCATGTCTCAGAGCAAC-3′ and 5′-GCGTCGACTCATTTCCGACTGAAG-3′ and inserted into pEGFP-C2, pGEX-5x-1, or pET-21a at EcoRI/SalI sites. p3×Flag-myc-cmv-24-Bcl-XL was generated by subcloning the PCR product, amplified with the primers 5′-CGGAATTCCATGTCTCAGAGCAAC-3′ and 5′-GCGTCGACTCATTTCCGACTGAAG-3′ into p3×Flag-myc-cmv-24 at its EcoRI/SalI sites. Deletion mutants of Bcl-XL encoding amino acids 1–85, 86–195, or 196–233 were created by subcloning PCR products into pGEX-5x-1 at its EcoRI/SalI sites. The PCR products were amplified with the following primers: 5′-CGGAATTCATGTCTCAGAGCAAC-3′ and 5′-GCGTCGACTCATGCTGCCATGGGGAT-3′ for 1–85aa; 5′-CGGAATTCGTAAAGCAAGCGCTG-3′ and 5′-GCGTCGACTCAATAGAGTTCCACAAA-3′ for 86–195aa; 5′-CGGAATTCGGGAACAATGCAGCA-3′ and 5′-GCGTCGACTCATTTCCGACTGAAG-3′ for 196–233aa. An aliquot containing 20 μg of GST or a recombinant GST-fused protein expressed by Escherichia coli strain JM109 was incubated with 20 μl of glutathione-agarose beads (Pharmacia) for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing three times with ice-cold PBS, the beads were incubated with 50 μg of a protein expressed by E. coli strain BL21 for 2 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the beads were washed five times with ice-cold HNTG buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 10% glycerol). Bound proteins were eluted from the beads and subjected to immunoblot analysis. The input represents 10% of the protein incubated with GST or a GST-fusion protein. The inputs of purified GST and GST-fusion proteins are stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) or anti-GST antibody. Cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5 buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or monoclonal anti-Bcl-XL antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) coupled to protein G-Sepharose (Roche). The immunoprecipitated proteins were then washed five times with cell lysis buffer. Bound proteins and cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis. The input represents 10% of the cell lysate used in the co-immunoprecipitation experiment. Proteins were separated by 12% or 15% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Monoclonal anti-Bcl2, anti-Bcl-XL, anti-GFP, anti-GST, anti-Tom20, and anti-Ub antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, as were rabbit polyclonal anti-Bax antibodies. Polyclonal anti-Bcl-XL, anti-cleaved caspase-3 and anti-PARP antibodies were from Cell Signaling. Polyclonal anti-DJ-1 antibody was from Chemicon. Monoclonal anti-Flag, anti-Flag-HRP and anti-α-Tubulin antibodies were from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody was from Millipore. The secondary antibodies, sheep anti-mouse IgG-HRP and anti-rabbit IgG-HRP, were from Amersham Biosciences. The proteins were visualized using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Total RNA was extracted using the RNA extraction kit (TaKaRa, Japan) and used for reverse transcription with an oligo (dT)18 primer and TransScript RT/RI Enzyme (TaKaRa, Japan). qRT-PCR was performed using the SYBR Green PCR Kit (TaKaRa, Japan) and a StepOne Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) in 20 μl for 40 cycles (95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 1 min). The following specific primers were used, as described elsewhere (31Kanli A. Savli H. Exp. Oncol. 2007; 29: 314-316PubMed Google Scholar): 5′-GTAAACTGGGGTCGCATTGT-3′ and 5′-TGGATCCAAGGCTCTAGGTG-3′ for Bcl-XL; 5′-GATGAGTATGCCTGCCGTGTG-3′ and 5′-CAATCCAAATGCGGCATCT-3′ for the house-keeping gene B2MG. The relative amount of the target gene was calculated using the 2−ΔΔCt method (32Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (123424) Google Scholar). Isolation of cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions from transfected cells was performed according to instructions from the Mitochondria Isolation kit for Cultured Cells (Beyotime, China). The isolated fractions were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Tom20 was used as the mitochondrial maker and α-tubulin was used as the cytosolic maker. Cells were washed with DMEM without phenol red and incubated with MTT (3-(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo(-z-y1)-3,5-di-phenytetrazoliumromide, Sigma). After 3 h of incubation, the formazan crystals were dissolved in DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide). The optical density (OD) was measured by a photometer at 570 nm and background at 630 nm was subtracted. The data were normalized to a control and the ratios are presented as means ± S.E. from three independent experiments. H1299 cells stably expressing EGFP-Bcl-XL were starved in methionine-free medium and incubated for 30 min. The cells were then labeled with 200 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer) for 2 h. Pulse-labeling was terminated by incubating cells in fresh medium containing an excess of unlabeled methionine (300 mg/liter), and the cells were harvested at 0, 7, and 14 h. Cells lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Western blot densitometric analysis of three independent experiments was performed using Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe). The data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using origin 6.0 software (Originlab, Northampton, MA). The mitochondrial localization of DJ-1 increases under oxidative stresses such as paraquat treatment, H2O2 and UV irradiation (13Canet-Avilés R.M. Wilson M.A. Miller D.W. Ahmad R. McLendon C.

Neurosci. Res. 2009; 87: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Consistent with those findings, we observed that UVB irradiation increased the mitochondrial relocalization of DJ-1 (Fig. 1A). Bax was shown as positive control which is the well-known protein translocation to mitochondria under UV irradiation (33Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 395-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial fraction of DJ-1 has been reported to localize to the OMM (13Canet-Avilés R.M. Wilson M.A. Miller D.W. Ahmad R. McLendon C. Bandyopadhyay S. Baptista M.J. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Cookson M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 9103-9108Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 28Junn E. Jang W.H. Zhao X. Jeong B.S. Mouradian M.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2009; 87: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that DJ-1 may interact with Bcl-2 family proteins. The Bcl-2 family, which includes both pro-apoptotic (Bax, Bid, Bad) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl2, Bcl-XL, Mcl-1) members, acts as an apoptotic checkpoint upstream of caspases and mitochondria. Many Bcl-2 family proteins function and localize in the OMM (33Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 395-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar, 34Youle R.J. Strasser A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (3538) Google Scholar). We therefore performed GST pull-down assays to test the interactions between DJ-1 and three typical Bcl-2 family proteins, Bcl-XL, Bcl2, and Bax. Interestingly, DJ-1 interacted with Bcl-XL but not with Bcl2 and Bax (Fig. 1, B–D), although they share sequence homology and structural similarity (33Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 395-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar). Bcl-XL can form homodimers by itself or heterodimers with other Bcl-2 family proteins, such as Bax (35Cheng E.H. Levine B. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 36Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). In our observations, GST-Bcl-XL interacted with His-Bax (Fig. 1D). To further confirm these interactions, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays using anti-Bcl-XL antibody in H1299 cells. Interestingly, DJ-1 was precipitated by anti-Bcl-XL antibody under UVB irradiation, but much less DJ-1 was precipitated under normal culture conditions (Fig. 1E). In addition, neither Bax nor Bcl2 interacted with DJ-1 in cells (data not shown). Consistent with the data from the immunoprecipitation assays, UVB irradiation resulted in small DJ-1-RFP punctate formations, and these dots were partially co-localized with EGFP-Bcl-XL signals (Fig. 1F). These results suggest that UVB irradiation increases the translocation of DJ-1 to OMM and promotes its binding to Bcl-XL. The ability of DJ-1 to protect against oxidative stress is dependent on C106 oxidation and oxidation-driven mitochondrial localization (12Taira T. Saito Y. Niki T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Takahashi K. Ariga H. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, 13Canet-Avilés R.M. Wilson M.A. Miller D.W. Ahmad R. McLendon C. Bandyopadhyay S. Baptista M.J. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Cookson M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 9103-9108Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). To examine if the interaction between DJ-1 and Bcl-XL is mediated by the oxidative state of DJ-1, we treated H1299 cells with various concentrations of H2O2 and then collected cells for pull-down assays. The results showed that more DJ-1 was pulled down by GST-Bcl-XL when more H2O2 was used (Fig. 2A). Using recombinant proteins in vitro, we also observed that an equivalent amount of GST-DJ-1 treated with more H2O2 pulled down more Bcl-XL (Fig. 2B). We next created a C106A mutant to examine whether C106 is required for DJ-1 to bind to Bcl-XL. GST-DJ-1(C106A), which cannot be oxidized, bound to Bcl-XL much less than GST-DJ-1 did in GST pulldown assays (Fig. 2C) and could not bind to EGFP-Bcl-XL with or without UVB irradiation in cells (Fig. 2D). Moreover, interactions between DJ-1 and Bcl-XL induced by UVB irradiation could be blocked by reduced glutathione (Fig. 2E). These results suggest that the interactions between DJ-1 and Bcl-XL are oxidation-dependent. Bcl-XL protein contains four conserved Bcl-2 homology domains (BHs), BH1–4 (34Youle R.J. Strasser A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (3538) Google Scholar). To identify the regions of Bcl-XL that are required for its binding to DJ-1, we generated three deletion mutants of Bcl-XL fused to GST: amino acids 1–85, which contain the BH4 domain; amino acids 86–195, which contain domains BH1–3; and amino acids 196–233, which contain a transmembrane domain (Fig. 3A). GST-pull down assays showed that DJ-1 mainly bound to the middle fragment of Bcl-XL containing amino acids 86–195, and it bound significantly less to the N-terminal and C-terminal fragments (Fig. 3B). However, oxidized DJ-1 also bound to these domains with more strong affinity (Fig. 3B). The BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains in Bcl-XL (aa 86–195) and the C terminus of Bcl-XL are required for Bcl-XL/Bax heterodimer formation (36Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar, 37Jeong S.Y. Gaume B. Lee Y.J. Hsu Y.T. Ryu S.W. Yoon S.H. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2146-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 38Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated if DJ-1 affects the interactions between Bcl-XL and Bax. Using in vitro competitive binding experiments, we found neither non-oxidized DJ-1 nor oxidized DJ-1 affected the heterodimerization between Bcl-XL and Bax (Fig. 3, C and D). To further confirm this findings, we transfected various amounts of Flag-DJ-1 into H1299 cells that stably expressed EGFP-Bcl-XL and performed immunoprecipitation assays after UVB irradiation. DJ-1 did not affect the interactions between Bcl-XL and Bax (Fig. 3E). Interestingly, Flag-DJ-1 increased EGFP-Bcl-XL protein levels in a dose-dependent manner under UVB irradiation (Fig. 3E, lowest panel). To further confirm the effects of DJ-1 on Bcl-XL protein level, we silenced DJ-1 using small interfering RNA (si-DJ-1) and examined its effects on Bcl-XL. The knockdown efficiency of si-DJ-1 is shown in Fig. 4A. It has been reported that UVB irradiation promotes Bcl-XL degradation via the UPS (39Zhang H. Rosdahl I. Int. J. Oncol. 2006; 28: 661-666PubMed Google Scholar, 40Park K. Lee J.H. Oncol. Rep. 2009; 21: 689-692PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, Bcl-XL protein levels decreased after UVB irradiation (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 3). Without UVB irradiation, knockdown of DJ-1 did not significantly change Bcl-XL protein levels (Figs. 4, B and C, lanes 1 and 2). However, with UVB irradiation, Bcl-XL protein levels were significantly lower in DJ-1 knockdown cells than in control cells (Fig. 4, B and C, lanes 3 and 4). We next examined the effects of DJ-1 knockdown on cell viability. Although DJ-1 knockdown alone did not affect cell death, under UVB irradiation, DJ-1 knockdown significantly increased cell death (Fig. 4D). Knockdown of DJ-1 did not change Bcl-XL mRNA levels with or without UVB irradiation as detected by qRT-PCR (Fig. 4E), suggesting that DJ-1 may influence Bcl-XL levels post-translationally. We therefore performed pulse-chase assays to assess the effects of DJ-1 on Bcl-XL stability. Without UVB irradiation, DJ-1 knockdown did not affect the degradation rate of Bcl-XL. And consist with previous findings (39Zhang H. Rosdahl"

Children performed seven activities: lying down viewing television, sitting upright playing a computer game, slow walking, brisk walking, jogging, hopscotch and basketball. Threshold count values were established to identify sedentary behaviour and light, moderate and vigorous physical activity using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.EE was significantly associated with counts for all non-sedentary activities with the exception of jogging. Threshold values for accelerometer counts (counts x minute(-1)) were <100 for sedentary behaviour and ≤2240, ≤3840 and ≥3841 for light, moderate and vigorous physical activity respectively. The area under the ROC curves for discrimination of sedentary behaviour and vigorous activity were 0.98. Boundaries for light and moderate physical activity were less well defined (0.61 and 0.60 respectively). Sensitivity and specificity were higher for sedentary (99% and 97%) and vigorous (95% and 91%) than for light (60% and 83%) and moderate (61% and 76%) thresholds.The accelerometer cut points established in this study can be used to classify sedentary behaviour and to distinguish between light, moderate and vigorous physical activity in children of this age."

Suppression of GPx-1 enhanced TNF-α-induced ROS production and ICAM-1 expression, whereas overexpression of GPx-1 attenuated these TNF-α-mediated responses.

To analyze further signaling pathways involved in GPx-1-mediated protection from TNF-α-induced ROS, we performed microarray analysis of human microvascular endothelial cells treated with TNF-α in the presence and absence of GPx-1. Among the genes whose expression changed significantly, dual specificity phosphatase 4 (DUSP4), encoding an antagonist of MAPK signaling, was down-regulated by GPx-1 suppression.

https://openalex.org/W2040451451,"Background The microenvironment plays a pivotal role in tumor cell proliferation, survival and migration. Invasive cancer cells face a new set of environmental challenges as they breach the basement membrane and colonize distant organs during the process of metastasis. Phenotypic switching, such as that which occurs during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), may be associated with a remodeling of cell surface receptors and thus altered responses to signals from the tumor microenvironment. Methodology/Principal Findings We assessed changes in intracellular Ca2+ in cells loaded with Fluo-4 AM using a fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPRTETRA) and observed significant changes in the potency of ATP (EC50 0.175 µM (−EGF) versus 1.731 µM (+EGF), P<0.05), and the nature of the ATP-induced Ca2+ transient, corresponding with a 10-fold increase in the mesenchymal marker vimentin (P<0.05). We observed no change in the sensitivity to PAR2-mediated Ca2+ signaling, indicating that these alterations are not simply a consequence of changes in global Ca2+ homeostasis. To determine whether changes in ATP-mediated Ca2+ signaling are preceded by alterations in the transcriptional profile of purinergic receptors, we analyzed the expression of a panel of P2X ionotropic and P2Y metabotropic purinergic receptors using real-time RT-PCR and found significant and specific alterations in the suite of ATP-activated purinergic receptors during EGF-induced EMT in breast cancer cells. Our studies are the first to show that P2X5 ionotropic receptors are enriched in the mesenchymal phenotype and that silencing of P2X5 leads to a significant reduction (25%, P<0.05) in EGF-induced vimentin protein expression. Conclusions The acquisition of a new suite of cell surface purinergic receptors is a feature of EGF-mediated EMT in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells. Such changes may impart advantageous phenotypic traits and represent a novel mechanism for the targeting of cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2079651319,"Background Epicoccum nigrum Link (syn. E. purpurascens Ehrenb. ex Schlecht) is a saprophytic ascomycete distributed worldwide which colonizes a myriad of substrates. This fungus has been known as a biological control agent for plant pathogens and produces a variety of secondary metabolites with important biological activities as well as biotechnological application. E. nigrum produces darkly pigmented muriform conidia on short conidiophores on sporodochia and is a genotypically and phenotypically highly variable species. Since different isolates identified as E. nigrum have been evaluated as biological control agents and used for biocompound production, it is highly desirable that this species name refers to only one lineage. However, according to morphological and genetic variation, E. nigrum present two genotypes that may comprise more than one species. Methodology/Principal Findings We report the application of combined molecular (ITS and β-tubulin gene sequence analysis, PCR-RFLP and AFLP techniques), morphometric, physiological, genetic compatibility and recombination analysis to study the taxonomic relationships within an endophytic population that has been identified as E. nigrum. This combined analysis established two genotypes showing morphological, physiological and genetic divergence as well as genetic incompatibility characterized by colony inhibition, strongly indicating that these genotypes correspond to different species. Genotype 1 corresponds to E. nigrum while genotype 2 represents a new species, referred to in this study as Epicoccum sp. Conclusions/Significance This research contributes to the knowledge of the Epicoccum genus and asserts that the classification of E. nigrum as a single variable species should be reassessed. In fact, based on the polyphasic approach we suggest the occurrence of cryptic species within E. nigrum and also that many of the sequences deposited as E. nigrum in GenBank and culture collection of microbial strains should be reclassified, including the reference strain CBS 161.73 sequenced in this work. In addition, this study provides valuable tools for differentiation of Epicoccum species."
https://openalex.org/W2053040879,"The genotypic structure of parasite populations is an important determinant of ecological and evolutionary dynamics of host-parasite interactions with consequences for pest management and disease control. Genotypic structure is especially interesting where multiple hosts co-exist and share parasites. We here analyze the natural genotypic distribution of Crithidia bombi, a trypanosomatid parasite of bumblebees (Bombus spp.), in two ecologically different habitats over a time period of three years. Using an algorithm to reconstruct genotypes in cases of multiple infections, and combining these with directly identified genotypes from single infections, we find a striking diversity of infection for both data sets, with almost all multi-locus genotypes being unique, and are inferring that around half of the total infections are resulting from multiple strains. Our analyses further suggest a mixture of clonality and sexuality in natural populations of this parasite species. Finally, we ask whether parasite genotypes are associated with host species (the phylogenetic hypothesis) or whether ecological factors (niche overlap in flower choice) shape the distribution of parasite genotypes (the ecological hypothesis). Redundancy analysis demonstrates that in the region with relatively high parasite prevalence, both host species identity and niche overlap are equally important factors shaping the distribution of parasite strains, whereas in the region with lower parasite prevalence, niche overlap more strongly contributes to the distribution observed.

The results presented here demonstrate that macrophages from caveolin-1-deficient mice exhibit elevated fatty acid incorporation and remodeling and a constitutively increased CoA-independent transacylase activity. Mass spectrometry-based lipidomic analyses reveal stable alterations in the profile of AA distribution among phospholipids, manifested by reduced levels of AA in choline glycerophospholipids but elevated levels in ethanolamine glycerophospholipids and phosphatidylinositol. Furthermore, macrophages from caveolin-1 null mice show decreased AA mobilization and prostaglandin E(2) and LTB(4) production upon cell stimulation. Collectively, these results provide insight into the role of caveolin-1 in AA homeostasis and suggest an important role for this protein in the eicosanoid biosynthetic response."
https://openalex.org/W1991203538,"Functional and reactive neurogenesis and astrogenesis are observed in deafferented vestibular nuclei after unilateral vestibular nerve section in adult cats. The newborn cells survive up to one month and contribute actively to the successful recovery of posturo-locomotor functions. This study investigates whether the nature of vestibular deafferentation has an incidence on the neurogenic potential of the vestibular nuclei, and on the time course of behavioural recovery. Three animal models that mimic different vestibular pathologies were used: unilateral and permanent suppression of vestibular input by unilateral vestibular neurectomy (UVN), or by unilateral labyrinthectomy (UL, the mechanical destruction of peripheral vestibular receptors), or unilateral and reversible blockade of vestibular nerve input using tetrodotoxin (TTX). Neurogenesis and astrogenesis were revealed in the vestibular nuclei using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) as a newborn cell marker, while glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and glutamate decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) were used to identify astrocytes and GABAergic neurons, respectively. Spontaneous nystagmus and posturo-locomotor tests (static and dynamic balance performance) were carried out to quantify the behavioural recovery process. Results showed that the nature of vestibular loss determined the cellular plastic events occurring in the vestibular nuclei and affected the time course of behavioural recovery. Interestingly, the deafferented vestibular nuclei express neurogenic potential after acute and total vestibular loss only (UVN), while non-structural plastic processes are involved when the vestibular deafferentation is less drastic (UL, TTX). This is the first experimental evidence that the vestibular complex in the brainstem can become neurogenic under specific injury. These new data are of interest for understanding the factors favouring the expression of functional neurogenesis in adult mammals in a brain repair perspective, and are of clinical relevance in vestibular pathology."
https://openalex.org/W1995916765,"Two-component signal transduction systems regulate numerous important physiological functions in bacteria. In this study we have identified, cloned, overexpressed, and characterized a dimeric full-length heme-bound (heme:protein, 1:1 stoichiometry) globin-coupled histidine kinase (AfGcHK) from Anaeromyxobacter sp. strain Fw109-5 for the first time. The Fe(III), Fe(II)-O(2), and Fe(II)-CO complexes of the protein displayed autophosphorylation activity, whereas the Fe(II) complex had no significant activity. A H99A mutant lost heme binding ability, suggesting that this residue is the heme proximal ligand. Moreover, His-183 was proposed as the autophosphorylation site based on the finding that the H183A mutant protein was not phosphorylated. The phosphate group of autophosphorylated AfGcHK was transferred to Asp-52 and Asp-169 of a response regulator, as confirmed from site-directed mutagenesis experiments. Based on the amino acid sequences and crystal structures of other globin-coupled oxygen sensor enzymes, Tyr-45 was assumed to be the O(2) binding site at the heme distal side. The O(2) dissociation rate constant, 0.10 s(-1), was substantially increased up to 8.0 s(-1) upon Y45L mutation. The resonance Raman frequencies representing ν(Fe-O2) (559 cm(-1)) and ν(O-O) (1149 cm(-1)) of the Fe(II)-O(2) complex of Y45F mutant AfGcHK were distinct from those of the wild-type protein (ν(Fe-O2), 557 cm(-1); ν(O-O), 1141 cm(-1)), supporting the proposal that Tyr-45 is located at the distal side and forms hydrogen bonds with the oxygen molecule bound to the Fe(II) complex. Thus, we have successfully identified and characterized a novel heme-based globin-coupled oxygen sensor histidine kinase, AfGcHK, in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2014711736,"Global histone H1 phosphorylation correlates with cell cycle progression. However, the function of site-specific H1 variant phosphorylation remains unclear. Our mass spectrometry analysis revealed a novel N-terminal phosphorylation of the major H1 variant H1.4 at serine 35 (H1.4S35ph), which accumulates at mitosis immediately after H3 phosphorylation at serine 10. Protein kinase A (PKA) was found to be a kinase for H1.4S35. Importantly, Ser-35-phosphorylated H1.4 dissociates from mitotic chromatin. Moreover, H1.4S35A substitution mutant cannot efficiently rescue the mitotic defect following H1.4 depletion, and inhibition of PKA activity increases the mitotic chromatin compaction depending on H1.4. Our results not only indicate that PKA-mediated H1.4S35 phosphorylation dissociates H1.4 from mitotic chromatin but also suggest that this phosphorylation is necessary for specific mitotic functions."

TAp73 has similar activity as p53 and functions as a tumor suppressor whereas ΔNp73 has both pro- and anti-survival functions. While p73 is rarely mutated in spontaneous tumors, the expression status of p73 is linked to the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapy and prognosis for many types of human cancer. Thus, uncovering its regulators in tumors is of great interest. Here, we found that Pirh2, a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase, promotes the proteasome-dependent degradation of p73. Specifically, we showed that knockdown of Pirh2 up-regulates, whereas ectopic expression of Pirh2 down-regulates, expression of endogenous and exogenous p73. In addition, Pirh2 physically associates with and promotes TAp73 polyubiquitination both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, we found that p73 can be degraded by both 20 S and 26 S proteasomes. Finally, we showed that Pirh2 knockdown leads to growth suppression in a TAp73-dependent manner. Taken together, our findings indicate that Pirh2 promotes the proteasomal turnover of TAp73, and thus targeting Pirh2 to restore TAp73-mediated growth suppression in p53-deficient tumors may be developed as a novel anti-cancer strategy.

https://openalex.org/W2144701973,"In most developed countries, HCV is primarily transmitted by injecting drug users (IDUs). HCV antiviral treatment is effective, and deemed cost-effective for those with no re-infection risk. However, few active IDUs are currently treated. Previous modelling studies have shown antiviral treatment for active IDUs could reduce HCV prevalence, and there is emerging interest in developing targeted IDU treatment programmes. However, the optimal timing and scale-up of treatment is unknown, given the real-world constraints commonly existing for health programmes. We explore how the optimal programme is affected by a variety of policy objectives, budget constraints, and prevalence settings. We develop a model of HCV transmission and treatment amongst active IDUs, determine the optimal treatment programme strategy over 10 years for two baseline chronic HCV prevalence scenarios (30% and 45%), a range of maximum annual budgets (£50,000-300,000 per 1,000 IDUs), and a variety of objectives: minimising health service costs and health utility losses; minimising prevalence at 10 years; minimising health service costs and health utility losses with a final time prevalence target; minimising health service costs with a final time prevalence target but neglecting health utility losses. The largest programme allowed for a given budget is the programme which minimises both prevalence at 10 years, and HCV health utility loss and heath service costs, with higher budgets resulting in greater cost-effectiveness (measured by cost per QALY gained compared to no treatment). However, if the objective is to achieve a 20% relative prevalence reduction at 10 years, while minimising both health service costs and losses in health utility, the optimal treatment strategy is an immediate expansion of coverage over 5-8 years, and is less cost-effective. By contrast, if the objective is only to minimise costs to the health service while attaining the 20% prevalence reduction, the programme is deferred until the final years of the decade, and is the least cost-effective of the scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W2026692028,"Iron plays a crucial part in proliferation while iron deficiency results in G(1)/S arrest, DNA damage, and apoptosis. However, the precise role of iron in cell cycle control remains unclear. We showed that iron depletion using the iron chelators, desferrioxamine (DFO), or 2-hydroxy-1-napthylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone (311), increased the mRNA levels of the growth arrest and DNA damage 45α gene, GADD45α (Darnell, G. and Richardson, D. R. (1999) Blood 94, 781-792). In this study, we examined the effect of iron depletion on up-regulating GADD family members involved in growth control, including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA repair, making them therapeutic targets for tumor suppression. We showed the GADD family members were up-regulated by cellular iron depletion. Further, up-regulation of GADD45α after iron deprivation was independent of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), octamer-1 (Oct-1), p53 and early growth response 1 (Egr1). We then analyzed the regulatory elements responsible for iron depletion-mediated regulation of GADD45α and identified the specific transcription factor/s involved. This region was within -117 bp and -81 bp relative to the start codon where the consensus sequences of three transcription factors are located: the CCAAT-binding factor/nuclear factor-Y (NF-Y), the stabilizing molecule v-MYB and the enhancer, CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (CEBPα). Mutation analysis, shRNA studies, Western blotting, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays led to the identification of NF-Y in the transcriptional up-regulation of GADD45α after iron depletion. Furthermore, like GADD45α, NF-YA was up-regulated after iron chelation and down-regulated by iron supplementation. These results are important for understanding the mechanisms of iron depletion-mediated cell cycle arrest, DNA damage repair, and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2154889421,"Expansion of Gr-1+/CD11b+ myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) is governed by the presence of increasingly metastatic, malignant primary tumors. Metastasis, not the primary tumor, is often the cause of mortality. This study sought to fully characterize the MDSC proteome in response to metastatic and non-metastatic mammary tumors using label-free mass spectrometry shotgun proteomics in a mouse model with tumor cell lines, 67NR and 4T1, derived from the same tumor. 67NR cells form only primary mammary tumors, whereas 4T1 cells readily metastasize to the lungs, lymph nodes, and blood. Overall analysis identified a total of 2825 protein groups with a 0.78% false discovery rate. Of the 2814 true identifications, 43 proteins were exclusive to the 67NR group, 153 were exclusive to the 4T1 group, and 2618 were shared. Among the shared cohort, 26 proteins were increased and 31 were decreased in the metastatic 4T1 cohort compared to non-metastatic 67NR controls after filtering. MDSCs selectively express proteins involved in the γ-glutamyl transferase, glutathione synthase pathways, CREB transcription factor signaling, and other pathways involved in platelet aggregation, as well as lipid and amino acid metabolism, in response to highly metastatic 4T1 tumors. Cell cycle regulation dominated protein pathways and ontological groups of the 67NR non-metastatic group. Not only does this study provide a starting point to identify potential biomarkers of metastasis expressed by MDSCs; it identifies critical pathways that are unique to non-metastatic and metastatic conditions. Therapeutic interventions aimed at these pathways in MDSC may offer a new route to control malignancy and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2053635573,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is essential for skeletal myogenesis through controlling distinct cellular pathways. The importance of the canonical mTOR complex 1 signaling components, including raptor, S6K1, and Rheb, had been suggested in muscle maintenance, growth, and metabolism. However, the role of those components in myogenic differentiation is not entirely clear. In this study we have investigated the functions of raptor, S6K1, and Rheb in the differentiation of C2C12 mouse myoblasts. We find that although mTOR knockdown severely impairs myogenic differentiation as expected, the knockdown of raptor, as well as Rheb, enhances differentiation. Consistent with a negative role for these proteins in myogenesis, overexpression of raptor or Rheb inhibits C2C12 differentiation. On the other hand, neither knockdown nor overexpression of S6K1 has any effect. Moreover, the enhanced differentiation elicited by raptor or Rheb knockdown is accompanied by increased Akt activation, elevated IRS1 protein levels, and decreased Ser-307 (human Ser-312) phosphorylation on IRS1. Finally, IRS1 knockdown eliminated the enhancement in differentiation elicited by raptor or Rheb knockdown, suggesting that IRS1 is a critical mediator of the myogenic functions of raptor and Rheb. In conclusion, the Rheb-mTOR/raptor pathway negatively regulates myogenic differentiation by suppressing IRS1-PI3K-Akt signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2076569465,"Small intestinal (SI) neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are increasing in incidence, however little is known about their biology. High throughput techniques such as inference of gene regulatory networks from microarray experiments can objectively define signaling machinery in this disease. Genome-wide co-expression analysis was used to infer gene relevance network in SI-NETs. The network was confirmed to be non-random, scale-free, and highly modular. Functional analysis of gene co-expression modules revealed processes including ‘Nervous system development’, ‘Immune response’, and ‘Cell-cycle’. Importantly, gene network topology and differential expression analysis identified over-expression of the GPCR signaling regulators, the cAMP synthetase, ADCY2, and the protein kinase A, PRKAR1A. Seven CREB response element (CRE) transcripts associated with proliferation and secretion: BEX1, BICD1, CHGB, CPE, GABRB3, SCG2 and SCG3 as well as ADCY2 and PRKAR1A were measured in an independent SI dataset (n = 10 NETs; n = 8 normal preparations). All were up-regulated (p<0.035) with the exception of SCG3 which was not differently expressed. Forskolin (a direct cAMP activator, 10−5 M) significantly stimulated transcription of pCREB and 3/7 CREB targets, isoproterenol (a selective ß-adrenergic receptor agonist and cAMP activator, 10−5 M) stimulated pCREB and 4/7 targets while BIM-53061 (a dopamine D2 and Serotonin [5-HT2] receptor agonist, 10−6 M) stimulated 100% of targets as well as pCREB; CRE transcription correlated with the levels of cAMP accumulation and PKA activity; BIM-53061 stimulated the highest levels of cAMP and PKA (2.8-fold and 2.5-fold vs. 1.8–2-fold for isoproterenol and forskolin). Gene network inference and graph topology analysis in SI NETs suggests that SI NETs express neural GPCRs that activate different CRE targets associated with proliferation and secretion. In vitro studies, in a model NET cell system, confirmed that transcriptional effects are signaled through the cAMP/PKA/pCREB signaling pathway and that a SI NET cell line was most sensitive to a D2 and 5-HT2 receptor agonist BIM-53061."
https://openalex.org/W2087682482,"In the plant genus Silene, separate sexes and sex chromosomes are believed to have evolved twice. Silene species that are wholly or largely hermaphroditic are assumed to represent the ancestral state from which dioecy evolved. This assumption is important for choice of outgroup species for inferring the genetic and chromosomal changes involved in the evolution of dioecy, but is mainly based on data from a single locus (ITS). To establish the order of events more clearly, and inform outgroup choice, we therefore carried out (i) multi-nuclear-gene phylogenetic analyses of 14 Silene species (including 7 hermaphrodite or gynodioecious species), representing species from both Silene clades with dioecious members, plus a more distantly related outgroup, and (ii) a BayesTraits character analysis of the evolution of dioecy. We confirm two origins of dioecy within this genus in agreement with recent work on comparing sex chromosomes from both clades with dioecious species. We conclude that sex chromosomes evolved after the origin of Silene and within a clade that includes only S. latifolia and its closest relatives. We estimate that sex chromosomes emerged soon after the split with the ancestor of S. viscosa, the probable closest non-dioecious S. latifolia relative among the species included in our study."
https://openalex.org/W2090202919,"The process of autophagy is situated at the intersection of multiple cell signaling pathways, including cell metabolism, growth, and death, and hence is subject to multiple forms of regulation. We previously reported that inhibition of isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase (Icmt), which catalyzes the final step in the post-translational prenylation of so-called CAAX proteins, results in the induction of autophagy which enhances cell death in some cancer cells. In this study, using siRNA-mediated knockdown of a group of small GTPases that are predicted Icmt substrates, we identify Rac3 GTPase as a negative regulator of the process of autophagy. Knockdown of Rac3, but not the closely related isoforms Rac1 and Rac2, results in induction of autophagy. Ectopic expression of Rac3, significantly rescues cells from autophagy and cell death induced by Icmt inhibition, strengthening the notion of an isoform-specific autophagy regulatory function of Rac3. This role of Rac3 was observed in multiple cell lines with varying Rac subtype expression profiles, suggesting its broad involvement in the process. The identification of this less-studied Rac member as a novel regulator provides new insight into autophagy and opens opportunities in identifying additional regulatory inputs of the process."
https://openalex.org/W2148916924,"Background A genome-wide association study (GWAS) typically involves examining representative SNPs in individuals from some population. A GWAS data set can concern a million SNPs and may soon concern billions. Researchers investigate the association of each SNP individually with a disease, and it is becoming increasingly commonplace to also analyze multi-SNP associations. Techniques for handling so many hypotheses include the Bonferroni correction and recently developed Bayesian methods. These methods can encounter problems. Most importantly, they are not applicable to a complex multi-locus hypothesis which has several competing hypotheses rather than only a null hypothesis. A method that computes the posterior probability of complex hypotheses is a pressing need. Methodology/Findings We introduce the Bayesian network posterior probability (BNPP) method which addresses the difficulties. The method represents the relationship between a disease and SNPs using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) model, and computes the likelihood of such models using a Bayesian network scoring criterion. The posterior probability of a hypothesis is computed based on the likelihoods of all competing hypotheses. The BNPP can not only be used to evaluate a hypothesis that has previously been discovered or suspected, but also to discover new disease loci associations. The results of experiments using simulated and real data sets are presented. Our results concerning simulated data sets indicate that the BNPP exhibits both better evaluation and discovery performance than does a p-value based method. For the real data sets, previous findings in the literature are confirmed and additional findings are found. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that the BNPP resolves a pressing problem by providing a way to compute the posterior probability of complex multi-locus hypotheses. A researcher can use the BNPP to determine the expected utility of investigating a hypothesis further. Furthermore, we conclude that the BNPP is a promising method for discovering disease loci associations."
https://openalex.org/W2133298213,"Presenilin 1 (PS1) is a component of the γ-secretase complex that cleaves a variety of type I membrane proteins, including the β-amyloid precursor protein (β-APP), Notch, and neuronal (N)- and epithelial (E)-cadherins. N-cadherin is an essential adhesion molecule that forms a complex with, and is cleaved by, PS1/γ-secretase and β-catenin in the plasma membrane. The purpose of this study was to determine whether calsenilin, a presenilin-interacting protein, has a functional role in PS1/γ-secretase-mediated N-cadherin ∊-cleavage using Western blot analysis, RT-PCR, immunoprecipitation, subcellular fractionation, biotinylation, and a luciferase reporter assay in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Here, we demonstrate that the expression of calsenilin leads to a disruption of PS1/γ-secretase-mediated ∊-cleavage of N-cadherin, which results in the significant accumulation of N-cadherin C-terminal fragment 1 (Ncad/CTF1), the reduction of cytoplasmic Ncad/CTF2 release, and a deceleration of PS1-CTF delivery to the cell surface. Interestingly, we also found that the expression of calsenilin is associated with the redistribution of β-catenin from the cell surface to a cytoplasmic pool, as well as with the negative regulation of genes that are targets of T-cell factor/β-catenin nuclear signaling. Taken together, our findings suggest that calsenilin is a novel negative regulator of N-cadherin processing that plays an important role in β-catenin signaling.—Jang, C., Choi, J.-K., Na, Y.-J., Jang, B., Wasco, W., Buxbaum, J.

https://openalex.org/W2012315781,"Genetic profiling of sperm from complex biological mixtures such as sexual assault casework samples requires isolation of a pure sperm population and the ability to analyze low abundant samples. Current standard procedure for sperm isolation includes preferential lysis of epithelial contaminants followed by collection of intact sperm by centrifugation. While effective for samples where sperm are abundant, this method is less effective when samples contain few spermatozoa. Laser capture microdissection (LCM) is a proven method for the isolation of cells biological mixtures, even when found in low abundance. Here, we demonstrate the efficacy of LCM coupled with on-chip low volume PCR (LV-PCR) for the isolation and genotyping of low abundance sperm samples. Our results indicate that this method can obtain complete profiles (13–16 loci) from as few as 15 sperm cells with 80% reproducibility, whereas at least 40 sperm cells are required to profile 13–16 loci by standard ‘in-tube’ PCR. Further, LCM and LV-PCR of a sexual assault casework sample generated a DNA genotype that was consistent with that of the suspect. This method was unable, however, to analyze a casework sample from a gang rape case in which two or more sperm contributors were in a mixed population. The results indicate that LCM and LV-PCR is sensitive and effective for genotyping sperm from sperm/epithelial cell mixtures when epithelial lysis may be insufficient due to low abundance of sperm; LCM and LV-PCR, however, failed in a casework sample when spermatozoa from multiple donors was present, indicating that further study is necessitated."

The significance of the interaction between CSB and p53 has remained unclear, however. Here, we show that the chromatin association of CSB and p53 is inversely related. Using in vitro binding and chromatin immunoprecipitation approaches, we demonstrate that CSB facilitates the sequence-independent association of p53 with chromatin when p53 concentrations are low and that this is achieved by the interaction of CSB with the C-terminal region of p53. Remarkably, p53 prevents CSB from binding to nucleosomes when p53 concentrations are elevated. Examining the enzymatic properties of CSB revealed that p53 excludes CSB from nucleosomes by occluding a nucleosome interaction surface on CSB.

Most notably, CSB has an essential role in transcription-coupled DNA repair, a process that removes bulky DNA lesions that stall transcription, such as those created by UV irradiation (13Hanawalt P.C. Spivak G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 958-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). CSB is, in fact, the first known protein recruited to sites of lesion-stalled transcription, a prerequisite for the subsequent recruitment of the nucleotide excision repair machinery (6Citterio E. Van Den Boom V. Schnitzler G. Kanaar R. Bonte E. Kingston R.E. Hoeijmakers J.H. Vermeulen W. Mol. Cell.

Although it is not known how the ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling activity of CSB is utilized in the DNA repair process (6Citterio E. Van Den Boom V. Schnitzler G. Kanaar R. Bonte E. Kingston R.E. Hoeijmakers J.H. Vermeulen W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7643-7653Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), ATP hydrolysis by CSB is an essential step of CSB recruitment, as the stable association of CSB with chromatin that occurs in response to lesion-stalled transcription is compromised by mutations that interfere with the ATPase activity of CSB (5Lake R.J. Geyko A. Hemashettar G. Zhao Y. Fan H.Y. Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Current evidence supports a model whereby CSB uses energy from ATP hydrolysis to convert from a closed to an open conformation. By converting between these two conformations, CSB may sample chromatin for its substrates, such as DNA lesion-stalled transcription. In the presence of lesion-stalled transcription, the open conformation would be stabilized, leading to the stable association of CSB with chromatin at sites of DNA damage (5Lake R.J. Geyko A. Hemashettar G. Zhao Y. Fan H.Y. Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). CSB is known to interact directly with the p53 tumor suppressor, but the biological ramifications of this interaction remain incompletely understood (11Yu A. Fan H.Y. Liao D. Bailey A.D. Weiner A.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 801-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 15Wang X.W. Yeh H. Schaeffer L. Roy R. Moncollin V. Egly J.M. Wang Z. Freidberg E.C. Evans M.K. Taffe B.G. Bohr V.A. Weeda G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Forrester K. Harris C.C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). p53 plays a critical role in maintaining genome integrity and is activated by various mechanisms, including DNA damage (16Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar, 17Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6740) Google Scholar). Like CSB, p53 has been linked to the aging process (18Vigneron A. Vousden K.H. Aging. 2010; 2: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). p53 appears to have both transcription-dependent and transcription-independent functions (19Vousden K.H. Prives C. Cell. 2009; 137: 413-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2328) Google Scholar, 20Beckerman R. Prives C. Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2010; 2: a000935Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). As a transcription factor, p53 functions in initiation and elongation. Moreover, p53 can function as a transcriptional activator or repressor. It is becoming increasingly apparent that that the cellular response to p53 is exquisitely tied to the degree of p53 activation and also to the cellular context (20Beckerman R. Prives C. Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2010; 2: a000935Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). For instance, under conditions of normal cell growth, when stress levels are low, p53 promotes cell survival. This tumor-suppressive, prosurvival property appears to result from the concerted action of several independent mechanisms, including the promotion of DNA repair, antioxidant gene expression, and autophagy. On the other hand, when genome integrity is severely compromised and p53 is strongly activated, p53 appears to promote cell death, most likely to eliminate cells that might propagate mutations deleterious to the integrity of an organism. In the context of proliferating tissue, cells may be eliminated through the induction of apoptosis or senescence. In quiescent cells, cell death may be achieved, at least in part, through interference with mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism (21Sahin E. Colla S. Liesa M. Moslehi J. Müller F.L. Guo M. Cooper M. Kotton D. Fabian A.J. Walkey C. Maser R.S. Tonon G. Foerster F. Xiong R. Wang Y.A. Shukla S.A. Jaskelioff M. Martin E.S. Heffernan T.P. Protopopov A. Ivanova E. Mahoney J.E. Kost-Alimova M. Perry S.R. Bronson R. Liao R. Mulligan R. Shirihai O.S. Chin L. DePinho R.A. Nature. 2011; 470: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar), and, as opposed to p53 function in normal cells, these latter processes will generate reactive oxygen species. Thus, the biological response to p53 is intimately bound to the level and cellular context of p53 activation (19Vousden K.H. Prives C. Cell. 2009; 137: 413-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2328) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that p53 activation may inhibit CSB function in transcription elongation, and this may lead to RNA polymerase stalling on select genes encoding highly structured RNAs (11Yu A. Fan H.Y. Liao D. Bailey A.D. Weiner A.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 801-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Studies of the cellular response to hypoxic stress have led to the hypothesis that the interaction between CSB and p53 is part of a feedback mechanism in which CSB attenuates p53 activity, promoting cell survival (22Filippi S. Latini P. Frontini M. Palitti F. Egly J.M. Proietti-De-Santis L. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2545-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Like CSB, p53 has also been suggested to participate directly in DNA repair, and the p53 protein has been found to interact with several other DNA repair proteins as well as mismatched DNA (15Wang X.W. Yeh H. Schaeffer L. Roy R. Moncollin V. Egly J.M. Wang Z. Freidberg E.C. Evans M.K. Taffe B.G. Bohr V.A. Weeda G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Forrester K. Harris C.C. Nat.

In the context of transcription-coupled DNA repair, the function of the CSB-p53 interaction is unknown; however, cells from Li-Fraumeni patients, which have p53 mutations, display less efficient repair of UV-induced DNA lesions (15Wang X.W. Yeh H. Schaeffer L. Roy R. Moncollin V. Egly J.M. Wang Z. Freidberg E.C. Evans M.K. Taffe B.G. Bohr V.A. Weeda G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Forrester K. Harris C.C. Nat.

U.S.A. 1999; 96: 15038-15043Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The impact of CSB on p53 function has remained largely unexplored. To elucidate further the functional significance of the CSB-p53 interaction, we examined the impact of CSB on the association of p53 with chromatin as well as the influence of p53 on the biochemical activities and chromatin association of CSB. Our results provide important insights into the mechanisms by which CSB and p53 might coordinate their activities to access chromatin and impact the efficiency of transcription and DNA repair as well as cell survival. Constructs encoding wild-type p53 and p53Δ30 were generated by PCR amplification and cloned into pGEX-4T and pFastBac1 to express in bacteria and insect cells, respectively, and binding assays were performed as described previously (11Yu A. Fan H.Y. Liao D. Bailey A.D. Weiner A.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 801-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). CSB expression constructs were as described previously (5Lake R.J. Geyko A. Hemashettar G. Zhao Y. Fan H.Y. Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For protein expression in Sf9 cells, various FLAG-tagged proteins were purified by M2 affinity chromatography (26Fan H.Y. Trotter K.W. Archer T.K. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 805-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). DNA fragments of 152 and 202 bp, each containing two 20-bp GT phasing sequences located at positions 1–40 (gray box in Fig. 3a) (27Shrader T.E. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 7418-7422Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), were assembled into mononucleosomes with HeLa cell core histones using step gradient salt dialysis (28Fan H.Y. He X. Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1311-1322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The DNA fragment containing p53-binding sequences was created by annealing two oligonucleotides containing the human MDM2 p53-response elements (ggtcaagttcagacacgttc and agttaagtcctgacttgtct) with an 18-bp spacing (cgaaactgcagtaaaagg) into the XhoI site, located at position 129, of the 202-bp DNA fragment (29Szak S.T. Mays D. Pietenpol J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3375-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). DNA fragments used for assembly were generated by PCR and body-labeled with [α-32P]dATP. ATP hydrolysis reactions were carried out as described previously (30Narlikar G.J. Phelan M.L. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1219-1230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Proteins were mixed with mononucleosomes (<1 nm) at the indicated concentrations. Binding reactions were carried out in 12 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 60 mm KCl, 8% glycerol, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP·Mg, and 0.02% Nonidet P-40 at 30 °C. Reactions were loaded directly onto a 5% Polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA. The percentage of nucleosomes or DNA bound by p53 was quantitated using a PhosphorImager. CS1AN-Sv cells were maintained in DMEM/F-10 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum as described previously (10Troelstra C. van Gool A. de Wit J. Vermeulen W. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Cell. 1992; 71: 939-953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). To generate stable CS1AN-Sv cell lines expressing the CSB protein, cells were infected with lentivirus expressing the CSB protein from the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter of pLentiPGKNeo (31Campeau E. Ruhl V.E. Rodier F. Smith C.L. Rahmberg B.L. Fuss J.O. Campisi J. Yaswen P. Cooper P.K. Kaufman P.D. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e6529Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Stable cell lines were selected with 600 μg/ml G418 (31Campeau E. Ruhl V.E. Rodier F. Smith C.L. Rahmberg B.L. Fuss J.O. Campisi J. Yaswen P. Cooper P.K. Kaufman P.D. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e6529Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Cells were either untreated or treated with UV irradiation (100 J/m2 at 254 nm) applied from a Stratalinker UV cross-linker. Irradiated cells were allowed to recover for 1 h, after which ChIP assays were performed with anti-p53 monoclonal antibody DO-1 (26Fan H.Y. Trotter K.W. Archer T.K. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 805-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Precipitated chromatin was analyzed by real-time PCR using a Bio-Rad MyiQ thermal cycler and SYBR Green. Primers were as described previously (32Mattia M. Gottifredi V. McKinney K. Prives C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Previously, we found that ATP hydrolysis by CSB leads to a conformational change of this remodeler that is a prerequisite for its stable association with chromatin inside a cell after UV irradiation (5Lake R.J. Geyko A. Hemashettar G. Zhao Y. Fan H.Y. Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To determine whether ATP hydrolysis can influence CSB-chromatin association in vitro, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays using both 202-bp mononucleosomes, which have a 45-bp naked DNA overhang, and 152-bp core mononucleosomes, which have little naked DNA overhang. Varying amounts of purified recombinant CSB protein (Fig. 1a) were mixed with radiolabeled nucleosomes in the absence or presence of ATP, and CSB-nucleosome complexes were resolved on 5% native polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1, b and c). At 3 nm CSB, ∼15% of the 202-bp nucleosome was bound by CSB in the presence of ATP and only 0.4% in the absence of ATP (Fig. 1b, lane 8 versus lane 4). Likewise, ∼3.3% of the 152-bp nucleosome was bound by CSB in the presence of ATP and only 0.46% was bound by CSB in the absence of ATP (Fig. 1c, lane 4 versus lane 8). These results indicate that ATP hydrolysis enhances CSB binding to nucleosomes in vitro and that CSB binds mononucleosomes with free DNA overhangs better than core mononucleosomes (Fig. 1, compare lane 8 in b with lane 4 in c). However, CSB-nucleosome interactions were also observed in the absence of ATP when higher concentrations of CSB protein (>10 nm) were used in the binding assays (data not shown). Therefore, in vitro, ATP hydrolysis by CSB can enhance its association with nucleosomes, but ATP hydrolysis is not absolutely required to generate the open chromatin-associating CSB conformation. CSB is a member of the SWI2/SNF2 ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler family that has been shown to interact with p53 (6Citterio E. Van Den Boom V. Schnitzler G. Kanaar R. Bonte E. Kingston R.E. Hoeijmakers J.H. Vermeulen W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7643-7653Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 11Yu A. Fan H.Y. Liao D. Bailey A.D. Weiner A.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 801-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 15Wang X.W. Yeh H. Schaeffer L. Roy R. Moncollin V. Egly J.M. Wang Z. Freidberg E.C. Evans M.K. Taffe B.G. Bohr V.A. Weeda G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Forrester K. Harris C.C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). This raised the possibility that CSB might facilitate p53 binding to nucleosomes. To test this hypothesis, we examined the influence of CSB on the sequence-independent interaction of p53 with 202-bp and 152-bp mononucleosomes, each devoid of p53-response elements (Fig. 2). When radiolabeled 202-bp mononucleosomes (Fig. 2b, lane 1) or 152-bp mononucleosomes (Fig. 2c, lane 1) were mixed with purified recombinant p53 or CSB in the presence of ATP, stable mobility-shifted nucleosomes were observed with 20 nm p53 (Fig. 2, b and c, lanes 4) or 3–6 nm CSB (Fig. 2, b and c, lanes 6), representing p53-nucleosome and CSB-nucleosome complexes, respectively (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S1). When both CSB and p53 were mixed with nucleosomes, the formation of stable complexes with mobilities similar to p53-nucleosome and CSB-nucleosome complexes were also observed; however, interactions between p53 and nucleosomes could then be detected at 2 nm p53 (Fig. 2, b, lane 7, and c, lanes 7 and 12) compared with 20 nm in the absence of CSB. Examining the binding data extrapolated to fixed percentages of p53-nucleosome association (supplemental Table S1) revealed that at approximately equimolar CSB/p53 concentrations, CSB increased the association of p53 with nucleosomes by 10-fold (1% at 7 nm p53 versus 10% at 8 nm p53 and 6 nm CSB). Together, these results suggest that CSB facilitates p53 binding to nucleosomal DNA at low p53 concentrations. Additionally, p53 appeared to demonstrate slightly higher affinity for the 202-bp mononucleosome (Fig. 2, b and c, compare lanes 1–5). To confirm the identities of these mobility-shifted species, we included in these binding assays antibodies that specifically recognize p53 or HA-tagged CSB. As shown in supplemental Fig. S1A (lanes 5–7), anti-p53 antibody DO-1 specifically retarded the mobility of the slower migrating complex A, indicating that the slower migrating complex contained the p53 protein. On the other hand, we did not detect a change in the mobility of the faster migrating complex B (supplemental Fig. S1A, lanes 8–10), indicating that the faster migrating complex B did not contain p53. The mobility of the faster migrating complex B was altered, however, with an anti-HA antibody that recognizes HA-tagged CSB (supplemental Fig. S1B), indicating that this complex contained CSB. Importantly, the anti-HA antibody did not shift the slower migrating, p53-containing complex (supplemental Fig. S1B, lanes 6–10), arguing against the presence of CSB in that complex. Together, these results reveal that p53-nucleosome or CSB-nucleosome complexes were the only complexes detected and suggest that a trimeric complex composed of CSB, p53, and nucleosomes is either transient or unstable. Moreover, these data support the hypothesis that CSB facilitates the association of p53 with nucleosomes (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S1). In addition to displaying sequence-independent DNA binding, as a transcription factor, p53 binds to DNA in a sequence-specific manner. We therefore sought to determine whether CSB could facilitate the binding of p53 to its response element. To accomplish this, we incorporated the p53-response element of the human MDM2 promoter into one end of the 202-bp DNA fragment, and we used this DNA fragment to assemble nucleosomes (Fig. 3a). p53 demonstrated a much higher affinity for nucleosomes containing the p53-response element: 7 nm p53 was needed to bind 0.1% of total nucleosomes in the absence of a p53-binding sequence, but only 0.6 nm p53 was required to bind 0.1% of total nucleosomes when a p53-response element was present (Fig. 2b, lane 4; and Fig. 3a, lane 3). Importantly, inclusion of CSB in the binding assay did not further enhance the p53-nucleosome interaction in a sequence-dependent manner (Fig. 3a). To determine whether a direct CSB-p53 interaction is important for the CSB-mediated enhancement of p53-nucleosome binding, we used a p53 protein devoid of its last 30 amino acids (p53Δ30) with compromised CSB-binding activity (Fig. 4b) (15Wang X.W. Yeh H. Schaeffer L. Roy R. Moncollin V. Egly J.M. Wang Z. Freidberg E.C. Evans M.K. Taffe B.G. Bohr V.A. Weeda G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Forrester K. Harris C.C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). p53Δ30 displayed an apparent affinity for nucleosomes greater than that of full-length p53, as only 0.7 nm p53Δ30 was required to bind 0.1% total nucleosomes, but 7 nm full-length p53 was needed to bind a similar nucleosome fraction (Fig. 2b, lane 3, and Fig. 3b, lane 2). These results are in agreement with previous observations of p53Δ30 binding to naked DNA (33Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar, 34Selivanova G. Iotsova V. Kiseleva E. Ström M. Bakalkin G. Grafström R.C. Wiman K.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3560-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Importantly, CSB did not enhance the nucleosome association of p53Δ30 as dramatically as full-length p53: CSB enhanced 7 nm p53 binding to nucleosome by ∼50-fold but enhanced a similar amount of p53Δ30 binding to nucleosome by only 8-fold (Fig. 2b, compare lane 8 with lane 3, and Fig. 3b, compare lane 14 with lane 4). The low level of CSB-mediated enhancement observed for p53Δ30 is likely attributed to the residual binding of CSB to p53Δ30 (Fig. 4b). Therefore, a decrease in the association of CSB with p53 led to a concomitant decrease in the ability of CSB to facilitate p53-nucleosome association. Together, these results indicate that a direct CSB-p53 interaction is important for CSB to facilitate the binding of p53 to nucleosomes (Figs. 2b and 3b). To determine whether CSB could facilitate p53-nucleosome association in vivo, we examined the sequence-dependent and sequence-independent recruitment of p53 to chromatin using ChIP in the presence and absence of CSB. First, we examined the influence of CSB on the recruitment of p53 to three regions of the p21 gene: 1) the promoter region containing p53-response elements, 2) a promoter region devoid of p53-response elements, and 3) a region of intron 1 also devoid of p53-response elements (32Mattia M. Gottifredi V. McKinney K. Prives C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To accomplish this, we performed p53 ChIP assays with the CSB mutant cell line CS1AN-Sv (11Yu A. Fan H.Y. Liao D. Bailey A.D. Weiner A.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 801-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) as well as a CS1AN-Sv cell line reconstituted with CSB. Functional CSB reconstitution was verified by rescue of UV sensitivity, and p53 levels were found to be similar in both cell lines (supplemental Fig. S2). As shown in Fig. 5a, during normal cell growth, when p53 levels are low, ChIP assays revealed no significant enrichment of p53 in CS1AN-Sv cells in these three regions of the p21 gene. Strikingly, however, introduction of CSB into this CSB mutant cell line led to enrichment of p53 in all three regions. To examine the influence of CSB on p53-chromatin association when p53 concentrations are elevated, we performed ChIP assays on UV-irradiated cells. As shown in Fig. 5b, when p53 concentrations were up-regulated, the association of p53 with chromatin was then independent of CSB. To increase the coverage of our study, we examined the influence of CSB on the sequence-dependent and sequence-independent association of p53 at seven additional genomic regions (32Mattia M. Gottifredi V. McKinney K. Prives C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5c, CSB enhanced the chromatin association of p53 at all regions examined during normal growth. When p53 levels were up-regulated, however, enrichment of p53 at all seven regions was independent of CSB. Although CSB facilitated p53 binding to nucleosomes at low p53 concentrations, notably, at higher p53 concentrations, CSB-nucleosome complexes became less apparent (Fig. 2, b and c), suggesting that high levels of p53 might decrease CSB-nucleosome association. To test this hypothesis, we used ATP hydrolysis assays to determine the Km of CSB for nucleosomes in the presence and absence of p53. The Km of CSB for nucleosomes is the concentration of nucleosomes necessary to achieve the half-maximal rate of ATP hydrolysis by CSB and is indicative of how tightly CSB interacts with nucleosomes (35Fresht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. 1st Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1998Google Scholar). As shown in Table 1, the Km of CSB for 202-bp mononucleosomes was ∼30 nm. However, when p53 was added to the reaction in a 20-fold molar excess, the Km of CSB for nucleosomes increased by ∼4-fold, supporting the notion that high p53 concentrations decrease CSB-nucleosome affinity.TABLE 1Km for 202-bp mononucleosomesKmWithout p53With 500 nm p53aThe p53 concentration is based on a tetramer.nmCSB (25 nm)30 ± 7120 ± 20CSBΔN (40 nm)90 ± 20500 ± 40a The p53 concentration is based on a tetramer. Open table in a new tab To dissect the mechanism by which p53 interferes with CSB-nucleosome association, we identified the regions of CSB that interact with p53 by GST pulldown assays (Fig. 4). Immobilized GST-p53, GST-p53Δ30, or GST protein alone (Fig. 4b, lanes 1–3) was mixed with lysates from 293T cells expressing wild-type or mutant CSB proteins (Fig. 4, a and b, lanes 4–9). Only the GST-p53 fusion protein, but not the GST protein alone, bound to full-length CSB (Fig. 4b, CSBwt, compare lanes 10 and 12), confirming the interaction between CSB and p53 (11Yu A. Fan H.Y. Liao D. Bailey A.D. Weiner A.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 801-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 15Wang X.W. Yeh H. Schaeffer L. Roy R. Moncollin V. Egly J.M. Wang Z. Freidberg E.C. Evans M.K. Taffe B.G. Bohr V.A. Weeda G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Forrester K. Harris C.C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Removal of the C-terminal 30 amino acids of p53 diminished the ability of p53 to associate with CSB (Fig. 4b, compare lane 2 with lane 3 and lane 11 with lane 12). Similarly, p53Δ30 interacted more weakly with mutant CSB proteins that were missing their N- or C-terminal regions (Fig. 4b, compare lane 14 with lane 15 and lane 17 with lane 18). Examining the interaction of p53 with specific regions of CSB revealed that both the ATPase domain (CSB-M) and C-terminal region (CSB-C) of CSB could interact with p53 (Fig. 4b, lanes 24 and 27), and the ATPase domain of CSB appeared to bind p53 better than full-length CSB. Interestingly, removing the C-terminal 30 amino acids of p53 impaired the ability of p53 to interact with the C-terminal region of CSB (Fig. 4b, lane 26) but had no effect on the interaction of p53 with the ATPase domain of CSB (lane 23). On the other hand, the N-terminal region of CSB appeared to be dispensable for p53 interaction (Fig. 4b, lanes 20 and 21). CSB has been shown to interact with chromatin through both its central ATPase domain and C-terminal region, and evidence suggests that the N-terminal region of CSB can function as a negative regulatory domain for chromatin interaction by occluding the chromatin interaction surface (5Lake R.J. Geyko A. Hemashettar G. Zhao Y. Fan H.Y. Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The data from the GST pulldown assays indicate that CSB also interacts with p53 through both its ATPase domain and C-terminal region and raise the hypothesis that p53 decreases the nucleosome association of CSB by occluding a chromatin interaction surface on CSB. This notion is supported by the observations that p53 increased the Km of CSBΔN for nucleosomes more than that of full-length CSB (Table 1). The ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler CSB has been shown to interact with the tumor suppressor p53, and both proteins play important roles in a variety of overlapping nuclear processes (8Newman J.C.

In this study, we have found that the association of CSB and p53 with chromatin is reciprocally regulated, and we have provided mechanistic insights into this regulation and how these two proteins may coordinate their activities. From our results, we present a model whereby CSB facilitates the sequence-independent chromatin association of p53 when p53 levels are low (Fig. 6a), and p53 interferes with CSB-chromatin association when p53 levels are up-regulated (Fig. 6b). This reciprocal relationship is primarily achieved through direct interactions involving the C-terminal 30 amino acids of p53 and the central ATPase domain and C-terminal region of CSB, which overlaps with the chromatin interaction surface of CSB (5Lake R.J. Geyko A. Hemashettar G. Zhao Y. Fan H.Y. Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 11Yu A. Fan H.Y. Liao D. Bailey A.D. Weiner A.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 801-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In general, CSB interacts with chromatin dynamically (5Lake R.J. Geyko A. Hemashettar G. Zhao Y. Fan H.Y. Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 37van den Boom V. Citterio E. Hoogstraten D. Zotter A. Egly J.M. van Cappellen W.A. Hoeijmakers J.H. Houtsmuller A.B. Vermeulen W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Most chromatin interactions are nonproductive, but, occasionally, productive chromatin interactions stimulate the ATPase activity of CSB, promoting the transition of CSB from a closed to an open conformation (Fig. 6, green) (5Lake R.J. Geyko A. Hemashettar G. Zhao Y. Fan H.Y. Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This open CSB protein would have an exposed chromatin interaction surface that could interact with the C-terminal region of p53 (Fig. 6, light blue) and facilitate the association of the p53 core domain with chromatin. The enhancement of p53-nucleosome binding by CSB is reminiscent of p53 activation by the C-terminus-binding monoclonal antibody PAb421 and by deletion or covalent modification of the C-terminal 30 amino acids of p53, which enhance p53-DNA binding in both sequence-dependent and sequence-independent manners (33Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar, 34Selivanova G. Iotsova V. Kiseleva E. Ström M. Bakalkin G. Grafström R.C. Wiman K.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3560-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Under conditions of normal cell growth or low stress, when p53 levels are relatively low, both CSB-chromatin and CSB-p53 interactions would occur (Fig. 6a). However, under conditions of high stress, when p53 levels are drastically elevated, CSB-p53 interactions would increase, promoting a decrease in CSB-chromatin associations by occluding the chromatin interaction surface of the CSB protein (Fig. 6b). It has been suggested that the N-terminal region of CSB participates in substrate recognition (5Lake R.J. Geyko A. Hemashettar G. Zhao Y. Fan H.Y. Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, p53 binding to the central ATPase domain and C-terminal region of CSB may free up the N-terminal substrate recognition domain and lead to a more efficient search by CSB for its preferred substrate, such as DNA lesion-stalled transcription (Fig. 6a). A prediction from this model would be that CSB-mediated DNA repair would be less efficient in cells defective for the p53 protein. Indeed, evidence suggests that cells from patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, which have p53 mutations, can be less efficient in transcription-coupled repair as well as global genome nucleotide excision repair (15Wang X.W. Yeh H. Schaeffer L. Roy R. Moncollin V. Egly J.M. Wang Z. Freidberg E.C. Evans M.K. Taffe B.G. Bohr V.A. Weeda G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Forrester K. Harris C.C. Nat.

U.S.A. 1999; 96: 15038-15043Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition to DNA repair, CSB can also function as a transcription elongation factor (38Tantin D. Kansal A. Carey M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6803-6814Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 39Lee S.K. Yu S.L. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Cell.

It has been suggested that activated p53 can sequester CSB and inhibit its function in transcription elongation, resulting in stalled transcription (11Yu A. Fan H.Y. Liao D. Bailey A.D. Weiner A.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 801-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Such stalling can lead to locally decondensed chromatin at certain loci during mitosis and, consequently, metaphase chromosome fragility (11Yu A. Fan H.Y. Liao D. Bailey A.D. Weiner A.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 801-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The results presented here are consistent with the hypothesis that p53 up-regulation can result in CSB sequestration (Fig. 6b and Table 1). What could be the biological significance of the CSB-mediated enhancement of p53-chromatin association (34Selivanova G. Iotsova V. Kiseleva E. Ström M. Bakalkin G. Grafström R.C. Wiman K.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3560-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 41Kern S.E. Kinzler K.W. Baker S.J. Nigro J.M. Rotter V. Levine A.J. Friedman P. Prives C. Vogelstein B. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 131-136PubMed Google Scholar)? As has been suggested for sequence-specific transcription factors, p53 may bind to chromatin in a sequence-independent manner to reduce the search for its targets from three dimensions to one, for instance by sliding along DNA (42McKinney K. Mattia M. Gottifredi V. Prives C. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 43Tafvizi A. Huang F. Leith J.S. Fersht A.R. Mirny L.A. van Oijen A.M. Biophys. J. 2008; 95: L01-L03Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Our in vitro studies revealed that CSB facilitated p53 binding to nucleosomes only in a sequence-independent manner (Fig. 3). However, our in vivo observations revealed that CSB could also enhance the association of p53 with its response elements inside cells (Fig. 5). Thus, the increased sequence-independent chromatin association, mediated by CSB, may lead to enhanced scanning by p53 for its response elements, and this may account for our in vivo observations (Fig. 5, b and c). Accordingly, by promoting p53-chromatin association, CSB may assist p53 in monitoring and maintaining genome integrity, such as in scanning for damaged DNA or in helping p53 find its target genes. In addition to CSB, p53 has been found to interact with enzymes important for nucleotide excision repair, such as XPB and XPD (15Wang X.W. Yeh H. Schaeffer L. Roy R. Moncollin V. Egly J.M. Wang Z. Freidberg E.C. Evans M.K. Taffe B.G. Bohr V.A. Weeda G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Forrester K. Harris C.C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Of interest, the C-terminal region of p53 also mediates interaction with XPB and XPD. It has been suggested that p53 can directly modulate the enzymatic activities of DNA repair proteins (15Wang X.W. Yeh H. Schaeffer L. Roy R. Moncollin V. Egly J.M. Wang Z. Freidberg E.C. Evans M.K. Taffe B.G. Bohr V.A. Weeda G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Forrester K. Harris C.C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The mechanism we propose here may represent another aspect of p53 function in DNA repair, i.e. enhancing chromatin scanning by DNA repair proteins and thus facilitating their targeting to their sites of action (42McKinney K. Mattia M. Gottifredi V. Prives C. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Given that the biological response to p53 activity is intimately tied to p53 levels, it is tempting to speculate that the dynamic relationship between the chromatin association of p53 and CSB we have described here could be part of a sensing mechanism that a cell uses to monitor genome integrity. For instance, in the absence of CSB, cells will readily undergo apoptosis when challenged with agents that stall transcription, such as exposure to UV irradiation. Therefore, CSB may participate in tailoring the response of a cell to p53 activation, impacting the decision between cell survival and programmed cell death as well as the aging process.

Structurally, Cp14a features the classical 14-3-3 dimer but with a uniquely wide pocket and a disoriented RRY triad potentially incapable of binding phosphopeptides. The Cp14b protein deviates from the norm significantly: (i) In one subunit, the phosphorylated C-terminal tail is bound in the binding groove like a phosphopeptide. This supports our binding study indicating this protein was stabilized by a peptide mimicking its last six residues. (ii) The other subunit has eight helices instead of nine, with αA and αB forming a single helix and occluding the peptide-binding cleft. (iii) The protein forms a degenerate dimer with the two binding grooves divided and facing opposite directions. These features conspire to block and disrupt the bicameral substrate-binding pocket, suggesting a possible tripartite auto-regulation mechanism that has not been observed previously.

However, low levels of endocrine specification limit the final yield of insulin-producing β-cells. In this study, we show that the pyrrolo-pyrimidine Src family kinase (SFK) inhibitor PP2 effectively promotes the endocrine specification of human embryonic stem cell derivatives based on its capacity to induce the expression of proendocrine transcription factors (NGN3, NEUROD1, NKX2.2, and PAX4) and to significantly increase the final yield of insulin-positive cells. We further demonstrate that PP2 inhibits the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and selective inhibition of this kinase is also sufficient to induce early endocrine commitment based on increased expression of NGN3, NEUROD1, and NKX2.2. Additional studies using dominant negative constructs and isolated human fetal pancreata suggest that c-Src is at least partially responsible for inhibiting early endocrine specification. Mechanistically, we propose that inhibition of SFK/FAK signaling can promote endocrine specification by limiting activation of the TGFβR/Smad2/3 pathway. Moreover, we show that inhibition of SFK/FAK signaling suppresses cell growth, increases the expression of the β-cell-associated cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p57kip2, and simultaneously suppresses the expression of Id1 and Id2.

Cells Tissues Organs. 2005; 179: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this intermediary capacity, SFKs have been shown to play an essential role in a wide range of cellular activities including growth and differentiation (12Tatosyan A.G. Mizenina O.A.

Cells Tissues Organs. 2005; 179: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Importantly, PP2, a well established SFK inhibitor, has recently been shown to promote the ex vivo differentiation of several cell types including cardiomyocytes (21Hakuno D. Takahashi T. Lammerding J. Lee R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39534-39544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and chondrocytes (13Pala D. Kapoor M. Woods A. Kennedy L. Liu S.

Interestingly, PP2 appears to induce the differentiation of these cells via a common mechanism that involves the inhibition of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (13Pala D. Kapoor M. Woods A. Kennedy L.

FAK is a broadly expressed cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase that is activated by integrin ligation and clustering, by growth factor stimulation, and by G-protein-linked receptor activation (19Mitra S.K. Schlaepfer D.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 516-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar, 22Lim S.T. Mikolon D. Stupack D.G. Schlaepfer D.D.

Among other things, FAK recruits and activates various SFKs, including the prototypical c-Src (19Mitra S.K. Schlaepfer D.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 516-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar, 22Lim S.T. Mikolon D. Stupack D.G. Schlaepfer D.D.

The subsequent formation of FAK-SFK complexes results in further FAK phosphorylation, which then triggers the activation of other downstream signaling cascades that then influence growth and differentiation (19Mitra S.K. Schlaepfer D.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 516-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar, 22Lim S.T. Mikolon D. Stupack D.G. Schlaepfer D.D.

The specific mechanism(s) whereby inhibition of SFK/FAK signaling by PP2 induces differentiation remains to be fully defined. However, several studies have shown that inhibition of SFK and FAK signaling alters the association between cells and the underlying extracellular matrix, which in turn can have profound consequences for anchorage-dependent growth and differentiation (13Pala D. Kapoor M. Woods A. Kennedy L. Liu S. Chen S. Bursell L. Lyons K.M. Carter D.E. Beier F. Leask A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9239-9247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 25Bursell L. Woods A. James C.G. Pala D. Leask A. Beier F. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2007; 9: R105Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Interestingly, anchorage-dependent SFK/FAK signaling has also been shown to induce the activation of Smad2/3, possibly as a result of cross-talk between integrins and TGFβ receptors (TGFβRs) (26Garamszegi N. Garamszegi S.P. Samavarchi-Tehrani P. Walford E. Schneiderbauer M.M. Wrana J.L. Scully S.P. Oncogene. 2010; 29: 2368-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 27Park M.S. Kim Y.H. Lee J.W. Matrix Biol. 2010; 29: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This is significant because TGFβ1-dependent activation of Smad2/3 has also recently been shown to suppress endocrine specification (28Nostro M.C. Sarangi F. Ogawa S. Holtzinger A. Corneo B. Li X. Micallef S.J. Park I.H. Basford C. Wheeler M.B. Daley G.Q. Elefanty A.G. Stanley E.G. Keller G. Development. 2011; 138: 861-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 29Rezania A. Riedel M.J. Wideman R.D. Karanu F. Ao Z. Warnock G.L. Kieffer T.J. Diabetes. 2011; 60: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Finally, it is noteworthy that PP2 and related SFK antagonists have also been shown to regulate the expression of both cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) and inhibitors of differentiation proteins (Ids), which together can have a major can impact on cell fate determination and/or differentiation (25Bursell L. Woods A. James C.G. Pala D. Leask A. Beier F. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2007; 9: R105Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 30Walker J.L. Wolff I.M. Zhang L. Menko A.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.

In this study, we show for the first time that the SFK inhibitor PP2 can be used to significantly increase endocrine specification and the subsequent derivation of insulin producing β-cells from hESCs. Moreover, we confirm that this increase in endocrine commitment can be attributed to the inhibition of FAK as well as the prototypical SFK c-Src. Inhibition of SFK and FAK activity is further shown to limit Smad2/3 activation, which in turn promotes endocrine specification (28Nostro M.C. Sarangi F. Ogawa S. Holtzinger A. Corneo B. Li X. Micallef S.J. Park I.H. Basford C. Wheeler M.B. Daley G.Q. Elefanty A.G. Stanley E.G. Keller G. Development. 2011; 138: 861-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 29Rezania A. Riedel M.J. Wideman R.D. Karanu F. Ao Z. Warnock G.L. Kieffer T.J. Diabetes. 2011; 60: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Finally, we show that inhibition of SFK/FAK activity inhibits progenitor cell proliferation, induces the expression of the human β-cell-associated CDKI p57kip2, and suppresses the expression of both Id1 and Id2. Human ESC lines, H9 (WA09), CyT203, and CyT49 were maintained in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with FGF2 (4 ng/ml; R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), activin A (10–20 ng/ml; R & D Systems), knockout serum replacement (20% v/v; Invitrogen), nonessential amino acids (1 mm), 2-mercaptoethanol (0.55 mm), GlutaMAXTM, and penicillin/streptomycin. Growth medium was replaced daily, and the ESC lines were grown in the presence of a sparse monolayer of mitomycin C-treated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (∼1 × 105 cells/60-mm plate). The cultures were mechanically passaged using a StemPro EZPassage passaging tool (Invitrogen) and were routinely split at a 1:6–1:9 ratio every 5–7 days. Differentiation was carried out essentially as described (1D'Amour K.A. Bang A.G. Eliazer S. Kelly O.G. Agulnick A.D. Smart N.G. Moorman M.A. Kroon E. Carpenter M.K. Baetge E.E. Nat.

The media conditions used, and the duration of individual differentiation steps, are shown in Fig. 1A. Basal media used included RPMI (Mediatech, Manassas, VA), DMEM high glucose (Invitrogen), and CMRL 1066 (Invitrogen). These media were supplemented with GlutaMAXTM and with either FBS (0.2–2%; HyClone, Lakewood, NJ) or B27 supplement (1% v/v; Invitrogen). Human recombinant activin A (100 ng/ml), mouse recombinant Wnt3a (25 ng/ml), mouse recombinant Noggin (50 ng/ml), and human recombinant KGF (50 ng/ml) were all purchased from R & D Systems. KAAD-cyclopamine (0.25 μm) was purchased from EMD Biosciences (Gibbstown, NJ), and all-trans-retinoic acid (2 μm) was from Sigma. The cultures were variously treated with PP2 (2–20 μm; EMD Biosciences), SKI-1 (3 μm; EMD Biosciences), ALK5 inhibitor-II (0.5–5 μm; Enzo Life Sciences Inc., Farmingdale, NY), or the FAK inhibitor PF-228 (2–3 μm; Tocris, Ellisville, MI). Please note that ESC cultures were grown to a high cell density prior to initiating differentiation, and cultures were washed with PBS (Invitrogen) at the beginning of stages 1 and 2. Fetal pancreata (gestational age, 18–21 weeks) were obtained from Advanced BioResources (Alameda, CA). These pancreata were minced and digested with collagenase prior to being allowed to form islet-like cell clusters (ICCs) as described (33Beattie G.M. Cirulli V. Lopez A.D. Hayek A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 1852-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 34Beattie G.M. Levine F. Mally M.I. Otonkoski T. O'Brien J.S. Salomon D.R. Hayek A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 78: 1232-1240PubMed Google Scholar). ICCs were subsequently washed and resuspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS and were then seeded into 24-well plates precoated with C-IV (30 μg/ml). As required, ICCs were seeded in the presence of PP2 (20 μm) or Me2SO vehicle alone and were then cultured for 72 h. For Q-PCR analysis, total RNA was extracted from ICCs prior to and after culture in the presence of PP2 or Me2SO alone. To assess the contribution of c-Src, ICC preparations were nucleofected with a dominant negative kinase-inactive mutant of c-Src (c-Src K297M) or with empty vector (pcDNA 3.1). The plasmid c-Src K297M was kindly provided by Dr. David Schlaepfer (University of California, San Diego) and has been described (35Broome M.A. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16798-16806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For transfection, fetal ICCs were cultured as a monolayer on HTB-9 matrix for 3 days as and were then nucleofected essentially as described (36Kaido T.J. Yebra M. Kaneto H. Cirulli V. Hayek A. Montgomery A.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2010; 224: 101-111PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cell monolayers were harvested as single cells using a 0.025% trypsin-EDTA solution, and 2 × 106 cells were resuspended in 100 μl of Amaxa nucleofector solution (VPI-1005; Amaxa GmbH, Gaithersburg, MD) containing 5 μg of plasmid and were then nucleofected using an Amaxa Nucleofector II (S-005 program). Using the same approach, additional cells were nucleofected with 10 nm of Ambion Silencer Select Validated src siRNA (identifier s13414), Silencer Select Validated lyn siRNA (identifier s8356), or scrambled siRNA (identifier 4611) from Invitrogen. After pulsing, the cells were transferred to C-IV-coated dishes and were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS for an additional 2 days. For Q-PCR analysis, total RNA was extracted from expanded ICCs prior to and after nucleofection and subsequent culture. β-Cell transfection efficiency based on the use of a GFP construct under identical experimental conditions was 30–35%. Q-PCR analysis was performed on differentiated hESC cultures and fetal pancreatic preparations (ICCs). Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Plus mini kit 50 (Qiagen), and cDNA was synthesized from 100–300 ng of RNA using an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). cDNA reactions (20 μl) were further diluted 1:5. PCRs (20 μl of total volume) were then run in duplicate using 3 μl of cDNA, combined with TaqMan® Universal PCR Master Mix (4324018; Applied Biosystems) and unlabeled PCR primers and TaqMan FAMTM dye-labeled probes listed in supplemental Table S1. RT-Q-PCR was performed using an Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus real time PCR system machine. The results were analyzed by the standard curve method or by the comparative Ct (ddCt) method as indicated in the text. Standard curves were generated using cDNA prepared from pooled 11–17-week human fetal ICCs (provided by University of Washington, Seattle, WA). Quantified values for each gene of interest were normalized to cyclophilin A (stem cells) or RPS-16 (fetal ICCs). The Q-PCR results shown in this study are the average values of 2–5 repeat experiments (means ± S.D.). The statistical significance of Q-PCR data were assessed using Student's t test. Levels of NGN3 and p57kip2 expression and the phosphorylation status of FAK, SFKs, and SMAD2 were assessed by Western blot analysis. The lysates were generated using a buffer consisting of Triton X-100 (1%), sodium deoxycholate (0.5%), SDS (0.1%), Tris (50 mm), and sodium chloride (150 mm) (pH 8.0). To assess NGN3 expression, lysates were generated using a buffer containing SDS (1%), urea (6 m), and Hepes (50 mm). Both buffers were further supplemented with PMSF (1 mm), pepstatin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), and a complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). To inhibit phosphatase activity, the buffers were further supplemented with sodium orthovanadate (1 mm), β-glycerophosphate (25 mm), sodium pyrophosphate (2 mm), and sodium fluoride (10 mm). Equal quantities of protein were separated under reducing conditions using polyacrylamide gels (4–12% Bis-Tris, NuPage; Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred by electroblotting onto PVDF membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore), and the membranes were then probed with rabbit Abs to p57kip2 (antibody 2557), phosphoFAK Tyr-397 (antibody 3283), phosphoFAK Tyr-576/577 (antibody 3281), phospho-FAK Tyr-925 (antibody 3284), phospho-SFK Tyr-416 (antibody 2101), and phospho-SMAD2 (antibody 3108). All of the rabbit Abs were from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA) and were used at 1:1000 overnight at 4 °C. Additional membranes were probed with a sheep pAb to NGN3 (1 μg/ml antibody AF3444; R & D) for 2.5 h at room temperature. Detection was performed using donkey anti-rabbit or anti-sheep IgG-HRP conjugates (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) and by chemiluminescence (ECL normal RPN2109; Amersham Biosciences). To ensure equal loading, the membranes were striped and probed for total FAK (1:1000 pAb 3285; Cell Signaling), total Src (1:000 pAb 21080), total SMAD2 (1:1000 antibody 5339), or β-actin (1:5000 mouse mAb AC-15; Sigma). Differentiated hESC cultures, were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then treated for 45 min with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and 5% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The cells were subsequently washed and incubated with primary mAbs or pAbs to insulin (15 μg/ml sheep pAb PC059; Binding Site), glucagon (15 μg/ml mouse mAb, Clone K7961310; Sigma), NGN3 (5 μg/ml sheep pAb AF3444; R & D Systems), phospho-SFK Y416 (1:100 rabbit pAb 2101), phospho-FAK Y925 (1:100 rabbit pAb 3284), phospho-FAK Y397 (1:100 rabbit pAb 3283), p57kip2 (1:25 rabbit pAb SC-1040 Santa Cruz), or PDX1 (1:5000 goat pAb) (kindly provided by Dr. Christopher Wright, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN). Rabbit pAbs to phospho-FAK or phospho-SFK were added in combination with the goat pAb to human PDX1. The sheep pAb to NGN3 was added alone or in combination with the rabbit pAb to p57kip2. The sheep pAb to insulin was used in combination with the mouse mAb to glucagon. The cells were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.5% normal donkey serum. Bound antibodies were subsequently detected using donkey anti-sheep Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500 antibody A11015; Molecular Probes-Invitrogen), donkey anti-goat Rhodamine RedTM-X (1:500; Jackson Immunoresearch), donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 or 568 (1:500 antibody A21206/10042; Molecular Probes-Invitrogen) or donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 or 568 (1:500 antibody A21202/A10037; Molecular Probes-Invitrogen). Secondary immunoconjugates were used alone or in combination as required, and staining was performed for 90 min at room temperature. Differentiated hESC cultures were harvested as single cells using 0.25% Trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen) and were permeablized and fixed using IntraPrep permeabilization reagent kit (PN IM2388; Beckman Coulter) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After fixation and permeabilization, the cells were blocked with 5% normal donkey serum in the presence of the permeabilizatio"
https://openalex.org/W1964769863,"Lactation is the most energy demanding part of parental care in mammals, so parent-offspring conflict arises over milk provided by the mother. In some species females commonly become pregnant shortly after parturition of previous young. This further intensifies mother-offspring conflict due to concurrent pregnancy and lactation. In equids it has been well established that pregnant females wean their foals earlier than non-pregnant ones. Intensified mother-offspring conflict was presumed to associate with pregnancy also during the period of intensive lactation, i.e., before the weaning process starts. We investigated the effect of pregnancy on suckling behaviour characteristics as indicators of mother-offspring conflict in domestic horses. Contrary to expectation, here we provide evidence of a decreased mother-offspring conflict related to pregnancy in lactating females during first two trimesters of pregnancy. Pregnant mares provided longer suckling bouts and did not reject or terminate suckling of their foals more often than non-pregnant mares. Our results suggest that pregnant mares cope with parallel investment into a nursed foal and a foetus through enhancing nursing behaviour in early stages of pregnancy before the initially low requirements of the foetus increase. They compensate their suckling foal with the perspective of its early weaning due to ongoing pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2138162130,"The suitability of populations of sexually active women in Madibeng (North-West Province) and Mbekweni (Western Cape), South Africa, for a Phase III vaginal microbicide trial was evaluated.Sexually active women 18-35 years not known to be HIV-positive or pregnant were tested cross-sectionally to determine HIV and pregnancy prevalence (798 in Madibeng and 800 in Mbekweni). Out of these, 299 non-pregnant, HIV-negative women were subsequently enrolled at each clinical research center in a 12-month cohort study with quarterly study visits.HIV prevalence was 24% in Madibeng and 22% in Mbekweni. HIV incidence rates based on seroconversions over 12 months were 6.0/100 person-years (PY) (95% CI 3.0, 9.0) in Madibeng and 4.5/100 PY (95% CI 1.8, 7.1) in Mbekweni and those estimated by cross-sectional BED testing were 7.1/100 PY (95% CI 2.8, 11.3) in Madibeng and 5.8/100 PY (95% CI 2.0, 9.6) in Mbekweni. The 12-month pregnancy incidence rates were 4.8/100 PY (95% CI 2.2, 7.5) in Madibeng and 7.0/100 PY (95% CI 3.7, 10.3) in Mbekweni; rates decreased over time in both districts. Genital symptoms were reported very frequently, with an incidence of 46.8/100 PY (95% CI 38.5, 55.2) in Madibeng and 21.5/100 PY (95% CI 15.8, 27.3) in Mbekweni. Almost all (>99%) participants said that they would be willing to participate in a microbicide trial.These populations might be suitable for Phase III microbicide trials provided that HIV incidence rates over time remain sufficiently high to support endpoint-driven trials."
https://openalex.org/W2022547131,"The objectives of this study were to determine the capacity of BED incidence testing to a) estimate the effect of a HIV prevention intervention and b) provide adequate statistical power, when used among young people from sub-Saharan African settings with high HIV incidence rates.Firstly, after having elaborated plausible scenarios based on empirical data and the characteristics of the BED HIV-1 Capture EIA (BED) assay, we conducted statistical calculations to determine the BED theoretical power and HIV incidence rate ratio (IRR) associated with an intervention when using BED incidence testing. Secondly, we simulated a cross-sectional study conducted in a population among whom an HIV intervention was rolled out. Simulated data were analyzed using a log-linear Poisson model to recalculate the IRR and its confidence interval, and estimate the BED practical power. Calculations were conducted with and without corrections for misclassifications.Calculations showed that BED incidence testing can yield a BED theoretical power of 75% or more of the power that can be obtained in a classical cohort study conducted over a duration equal to the BED window period. Statistical analyses using simulated populations showed that the effect of a prevention intervention can be estimated with precision using classical statistical analysis of BED incidence testing data, even with an imprecise knowledge of the characteristics of the BED assay. The BED practical power was lower but of the same magnitude as the BED theoretical power.BED incidence testing can be applied to reasonably small samples to achieve good statistical power when used among young people to estimate IRR."
