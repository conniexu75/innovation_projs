https://openalex.org/W2004026365,"Autoradiographs and x-radiographs have been made of vertical sections through the centers of reef corals from Eniwetok. Radioactivity bands in the coral structure are caused by strontium-90 and are related to specific series of nuclear tests, thus making possible calculation of long-term growth rates. These data indicate that the cyclic variations in radial density revealed by x-radiography are annual."
https://openalex.org/W1971487710,"Much has been written about the responsibility of the scientist in resolving conflicts which arise from the interaction between science and society. Ordinarily the assumption is made that a particular issue on which scientific knowledge is drawn into the resolution of a political conflict for example, whether or not to build a supersonic transport (SST) or whether or not to proceed with a trip to the moon can be neatly divided into two clearly separable elements, one scientific, the other political. Thus the scientist is expected to say whether a trip to the moon is feasible or whether the SST will cause additional skin cancer. The politician, or some other representative of society, is then expected to say whether the society ought to proceed in one direction or another. The scientist and science provide the means; the politician and politics decide the ends. This view of the role of the scientist, and indeed of science itself, is, of course, oversimplified, in particular because even where there are clear scientific answers to the scientific questions involved in a public issue, ends and means are hardly separable. What is thought to be a political or social end turns out to have numerous repercussions, the analysis of which must fall into the legitimate jurisdiction of the scientist, and each of these repercussions must also be assessed in moral and political terms; or what is thought to be a scientific means has non-scientific implications which also must be assessed in these terms. The relationship between the scientist and the politician is thus far more complicated than the simple model described above."

https://openalex.org/W2010791067,"The literature on the occurrence of airborne algae is reviewed briefly. Airborne algae were isolated into culture in both quantity and diversity. Qualitative experiments and culture techniques are discussed, as are quantitative sampling techniques and preliminary correlations of the occurrence of algae, fungi, and pollen in the air. The data disclose an important pathway for the dispersion of soil algae and support an observation that algae may be important as causal agents in inhalant allergies."

On page 539, column 2, line 18, Santa Maria Cave in Chiapas should read Santa Marta Cave in Chiapas. On page 545, line 3 of Summary should read uncovered from five caves."
https://openalex.org/W2016079661,"Birch's law arises in the physics of solids as a linear approximation, in a certain range of density, of a power law. For a change of chemical composition within the same crystal structure, the velocity-density relation is constant with a slope of nearly -0.5 in the first-order approximation."
https://openalex.org/W2076161999,"Evidence from many stable areas indicates that sea level has risen slowly during the past 6000 years, with a total change of about 6 meters. Since the same period is also important in the history of man, the rise in sea level explains the widespread submergence of building sites and other human relics along coasts where ancient man lived."
https://openalex.org/W1996919774,"Four Paleozoic bivalved genera are assigned to the new molluscan class Rostroconchia: Eopteria, Euchasma, Conocardium, and Pseudoconocardium. These mollusks have ani uncoiled univalved larval shell; an untorted bivalved adult shell; no hinge teeth, ligament, or adductor muscles; and a fused, almost inflexible. hinge. Rostroconchianis developed separately from the pelecypods through the ribeirioids, but are regarded as more closely related to the Pelecypoda and Scaphopoda than to other known classes of mollusks."
https://openalex.org/W2042541444,"The lunar surface was mapped with respect to magnesium, aluminum, and silicon as aluminum/ silicon and magnesium/ silicon intensity ratios along the projected ground tracks swept out by the orbiting Apollo 16 spacecraft. The results confirm the observations made during the Apollo 15 flight and provide new data for a number of features not covered before. The data are consistent with the idea that the moon has a widespread differentiated crust (the highlands). The aluminum/ silicon and magnesium/ silicon concentration ratios correspond to those for anorthositic gabbros through gabbroic anorthosites or feldspathic basalts. The x-ray results suggest the occurrence of this premare crust or material similar to it at the Descartes landing site."

https://openalex.org/W2039790124,"Television pictures from the Tiros III satellite have been analyzed on a computer to give the latitudinal distribution of cloud cover during the summer of 1961. The results, which will be useful in studying the heat balance of the atmosphere and in the determination of vertical motion, show good agreement with the long-term average cloudiness derived from data accumulated during 50 years of ground observations."

The sauropods may have been more or less omnivorous."

https://openalex.org/W2171657737,"The C/sup 14/ link between river mollusks and soil humus is discussed. It is stated that the explanation that the C/sup 13/ deficiency should be attributed to the uptake of soil CO/sub 2/ by ground water (oxidation of humus in the soil, rather than after it has been transported into streams) and the C/sup 14/ deficiency to the solution of limestone is far more plausible. It was concluded that any relation between the radiocarbon concentrations in soil humus and fresh water mollusks is almost certainly coincidental. (P.C.H.)"

https://openalex.org/W2064424111,A recent laboratory measurement of the ratio of the rate constant for the reaction CO + HO (2) --> C0(2) + OH relative to that for H + HO(2) --> 2OH indicates that the former reaction is probably faster than CO + OH --> CO(2) + H. On this basis a simple analysis is given showing that the calculated lifetime of nitric oxide in polluted atmospheres would be appreciably longer than that estimated on the assumption that the carbon monoxide-hydroperoxyl reaction may be neglected. A fast carbon monoxide-hydroperoxyl reaction implies that the cyclic consumption of carbon monoxide (an atmospheric sink) could occur even with no nitric oxide present.

https://openalex.org/W2095060476,The radiation data from Tiros II and Tiros III have been analyzed to obtain the monthly averages of the global distribution of the total outgoing radiation from the earth. These data have been combined with climatological estimates of the incoming radiation for the same periods to obtain monthly averages of the regional distribution of the net energy balance. The results show that these data could be useful in studies of the meridional circulation and the evolution of large-scale weather systems.

https://openalex.org/W1996740911,The emission spectra of thin layers of a number of organic solids have been studied from 5 to 6.6 micro in the infrared to determine if there are specific emission characteristics that would allow identification of such solids as organic. This was the case only for very thin films with strong absorption bands.

It is remarkable for its variety, especially of birds, and gives evidence for year-round occupation of these sites."

https://openalex.org/W2072765117,"A method was developed for characterizing radioactive aerosols by determining their distribution as a function of depth in fibrous filters under carefully controlled conditions. The method distinguishes the contributions of three major processes of filtration: diffusion, interception, and inertial impaction. For those experiments where diffusion is the controlling mechanism, particle sizes in the range of 50 to 500 A thus determined compare favorably with those obtained from concentration and flow data and electron photomicrographs."
