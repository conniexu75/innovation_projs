https://openalex.org/W2009132775,"The mouse Clock gene encodes a bHLH-PAS protein that regulates circadian rhythms and is related to transcription factors that act as heterodimers. Potential partners of CLOCK were isolated in a two-hybrid screen, and one, BMAL1, was coexpressed with CLOCK and PER1 at known circadian clock sites in brain and retina. CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimers activated transcription from E-box elements, a type of transcription factor-binding site, found adjacent to the mouse per1 gene and from an identical E-box known to be important for per gene expression in Drosophila. Mutant CLOCK from the dominant-negative Clock allele and BMAL1 formed heterodimers that bound DNA but failed to activate transcription. Thus, CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimers appear to drive the positive component of per transcriptional oscillations, which are thought to underlie circadian rhythmicity."
https://openalex.org/W2076457965,"The tumor suppressor PTEN is a phosphatase with sequence similarity to the cytoskeletal protein tensin. Here the cellular roles of PTEN were investigated. Overexpression of PTEN inhibited cell migration, whereas antisense PTEN enhanced migration. Integrin-mediated cell spreading and the formation of focal adhesions were down-regulated by wild-type PTEN but not by PTEN with an inactive phosphatase domain. PTEN interacted with the focal adhesion kinase FAK and reduced its tyrosine phosphorylation. Overexpression of FAK partially antagonized the effects of PTEN. Thus, PTEN phosphatase may function as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating cell interactions with the extracellular matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1997221411,"A human member of the immunoglobulin superfamily was shown to mediate entry of several alphaherpesviruses, including herpes simplex viruses (HSV) 1 and 2, porcine pseudorabies virus (PRV), and bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1). This membrane glycoprotein is poliovirus receptor-related protein 1 (Prr1), designated here as HveC. Incubation of HSV-1 with a secreted form of HveC inhibited subsequent infection of a variety of cell lines, suggesting that HveC interacts directly with the virus. Poliovirus receptor (Pvr) itself mediated entry of PRV and BHV-1 but not of the HSV strains tested. HveC was expressed in human cells of epithelial and neuronal origin; it is the prime candidate for the coreceptor that allows both HSV-1 and HSV-2 to infect epithelial cells on mucosal surfaces and spread to cells of the nervous system."

Here, it is shown that these compounds specifically block the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway. These teratogens did not prevent the sterol modification of Shh during autoprocessing but rather inhibited the response of target tissues to Shh, possibly acting through the sterol sensing domain within the Patched protein regulator of Shh response."
https://openalex.org/W2126968890,"Glial cells produce myelin and contribute to axonal morphology in the nervous system. Two myelin membrane proteolipids, PLP and DM20, were shown to be essential for the integrity of myelinated axons. In the absence of PLP-DM20, mice assembled compact myelin sheaths but subsequently developed widespread axonal swellings and degeneration, associated predominantly with small-caliber nerve fibers. Similar swellings were absent in dysmyelinated shiverer mice, which lack myelin basic protein (MBP), but recurred in MBP*PLP double mutants. Thus, fiber degeneration, which was probably secondary to impaired axonal transport, could indicate that myelinated axons require local oligodendroglial support."
https://openalex.org/W2065793682,"The circadian oscillator generates a rhythmic output with a period of about 24 hours. Despite extensive studies in several model systems, the biochemical mode of action has not yet been demonstrated for any of its components. Here, the Drosophila CLOCK protein was shown to induce transcription of the circadian rhythm genes period and timeless. dCLOCK functioned as a heterodimer with a Drosophila homolog of BMAL1. These proteins acted through an E-box sequence in the period promoter. The timeless promoter contains an 18-base pair element encompassing an E-box, which was sufficient to confer dCLOCK responsiveness to a reporter gene. PERIOD and TIMELESS proteins blocked dCLOCK's ability to transactivate their promoters via the E-box. Thus, dCLOCK drives expression of period and timeless, which in turn inhibit dCLOCK's activity and close the circadian loop."
https://openalex.org/W1996208391,The subunit stoichiometry of several ligand-gated ion channel receptors is still unknown. A counting method was developed to determine the number of subunits in one family of brain glutamate receptors. Successful application of this method in an HEK cell line provides evidence that ionotropic glutamate receptors share a tetrameric structure with the voltage-gated potassium channels. The average conductance of these channels depends on how many subunits are occupied by an agonist.
https://openalex.org/W2086670842,"High-power and highly directional semiconductor cylinder-lasers based on an optical resonator with deformed cross section are reported. In the favorable directions of the far-field, a power increase of up to three orders of magnitude over the conventional circularly symmetric lasers was obtained. A ""bow-tie""-shaped resonance is responsible for the improved performance of the lasers in the higher range of deformations, in contrast to ""whispering-gallery""-type modes of circular and weakly deformed lasers. This resonator design, although demonstrated here in midinfrared quantum-cascade lasers, should be applicable to any laser based on semiconductors or other high-refractive index materials."

In response to INH treatment, saturated hexacosanoic acid (C26:0) accumulated on a 12-kilodalton acyl carrier protein (AcpM) that normally carried mycolic acid precursors as long as C50. A protein species purified from INH-treated Mycobacterium tuberculosis was shown to consist of a covalent complex of INH, AcpM, and a beta-ketoacyl acyl carrier protein synthase, KasA. Amino acid-altering mutations in the KasA protein were identified in INH-resistant patient isolates that lacked other mutations associated with resistance to this drug."

https://openalex.org/W2068013085,"The spatially dependent de-excitation of a beam of metastable argon atoms, traveling through an optical standing wave, produced a periodic array of localized metastable atoms with position and momentum spreads approaching the limit stated by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Silicon and silicon dioxide substrates placed in the path of the atom beam were patterned by the metastable atoms. The de-excitation of metastable atoms upon collision with the surface promoted the deposition of a carbonaceous film from a vapor-phase hydrocarbon precursor. The resulting patterns were imaged both directly and after chemical etching. Thus, quantum-mechanical steady-state atom distributions can be used for sub-0.1-micrometer lithography."
https://openalex.org/W1761055895,"The role of melatonin as an immunomodulator is well established. Recent reports showed that melatonin exerts protective effects in septic and hemorrhagic shock and in inflammation. The expression of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) makes an important contribution to the pathophysiology of shock and inflammation. We studied, in cultured murine macrophages, the role of melatonin in the regulation of the expression of iNOS and defined the mode of melatonin's action. Our results show that melatonin, at 1 microM-1 mM, decreased the production of nitrite/nitrate (the breakdown products of NO) as well as the production of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1alpha (the major stable breakdown product of prostacyclin) in macrophages stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (10 microg/ml). We observed that melatonin reduces iNOS steady-state mRNA levels and iNOS protein expression in the same concentration range (1 microM-1 mM). Melatonin, up to 10 mM, exerted only a slight direct inhibitory effect on iNOS activity. Using iNOS promoter-luciferase constructs, we found that melatonin inhibits iNOS promoter activation. Inhibition of iNOS expression was associated with inhibition of activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB). We conclude that melatonin inhibits NO production in immunostimulated macrophages mainly by inhibiting the expression of iNOS. This is due to inhibition of iNOS transcription, in part through inhibition of NFkappaB activation. Inhibition of iNOS-derived NO production by melatonin may contribute to the anti-inflammatory effects of this pineal secretory product."
https://openalex.org/W2081656000,"Osmium isotopic analyses of picritic lavas from Hawaii show enrichments in the osmium-186/osmium-188 ratio ( 186 Os/ 188 Os) of 0.008 to 0.018%, relative to a chondritic upper mantle, that are positively correlated with enrichments in 187 Os/ 188 Os of 5.4 to 9.0%. The most viable mechanism to produce these coupled 186 Os and 187 Os enrichments is by addition of 0.5 to 1 weight percent of outer core metal to a portion of the D"" layer and subsequent upwelling of the mixture. These data suggest that some plumes originate at the core-mantle boundary and that Os isotopes may be used to distinguish plumes derived from shallow versus deep mantle sources."

https://openalex.org/W2020887273,"Sickle cell anemia is the most common heritable hematological disease, yet no curative treatment exists for this disorder. Moreover, the intricacies of globin gene expression have made the development of treatments for hemoglobinopathies based on gene therapy difficult. An alternative genetic approach to sickle cell therapy is based on RNA repair. A trans-splicing group I ribozyme was used to alter mutant β-globin transcripts in erythrocyte precursors derived from peripheral blood from individuals with sickle cell disease. Sickle β-globin transcripts were converted into messenger RNAs encoding the anti-sickling protein γ-globin. These results suggest that RNA repair may become a useful approach in the treatment of genetic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2118590328,"Adipocytes participate in the microenvironment of the bone marrow (BM), but their exact role remains to be determined. It has recently been shown that leptin, a hormone secreted from extramedullary adipocytes, could be involved in hematopoiesis. Therefore we have developed a primary culture system of human BM adipocytes to characterize their differentiation and determine whether leptin is also secreted from these adipocytes. BM cells were cultured with fetal calf and horse sera. In the presence of dexamethasone, cells with vesicles containing lipids appeared within 15 days. They expressed glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase activity and a lipolytic activity in response to isoproterenol, but expressed neither the adrenergic beta3 receptor nor the mitochondrial uncoupling protein UCP1. The addition of insulin alone to the culture media did not promote adipocyte differentiation. Leptin was expressed and secreted at high levels during adipocyte differentiation. Acute exposure of differentiated adipocytes to insulin had little effect on leptin expression whereas forskolin strongly inhibited it. These results show that although human BM adipocytes differ from extramedullary adipose tissues in their sensitivity to different effectors, they are a secondary source of leptin production. They suggest that BM adipocytes could contribute to hematopoiesis via the secretion of leptin in the vicinity of hematopoietic stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W1999734356,"Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is cytotoxic to rat pancreatic β-cells by inhibiting glucose oxidation, causing DNA damage and inducing apoptosis. Nitric oxide (NO) is a necessary but not sufficient mediator of these effects. IL-1β induced kinase activity toward Elk-1, activation transcription factor 2, c-Jun, and heat shock protein 25 in rat islets. By Western blotting with phosphospecific antibodies and by immunocomplex kinase assay, IL-1β was shown to activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38) in islets and rat insulinoma cells. Specific ERK1/2 and p38 inhibitors individually reduced but in combination blocked IL-1β-mediated islet NO synthesis, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of inducible NO synthase mRNA showed that ERK1/2 and p38 controlled IL-1β-induced islet inducible NO synthase expression at the transcriptional level. Hyperosmolarity caused phosphorylation of Elk-1, activation transcription factor 2, and heat shock protein 25 and activation of ERK1/2 and p38 in islets comparable to that induced by IL-1β but did not lead to NO synthesis. Inhibition of p38 but not of ERK1/2 attenuated IL-1β-mediated inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin release. We conclude that ERK1/2 and p38 activation is necessary but not sufficient for IL-1β-mediated β-cell NO synthesis and that p38 is involved in signaling of NO-independent effects of IL-1β in β-cells."

Two-dimensional (2D) superconductors were achieved by intercalating a long-chain organic compound into bismuth-based high-Tc cuprates. Although the intercalation of the organic chain increased the interlayer distance remarkably, to tens of angstroms, the superconducting transition temperature of the intercalate was nearly the same as that of the pristine material, suggesting the 2D nature of the high-Tc superconductivity."
https://openalex.org/W1515141252,"Human interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) differs from most chemokines in its apparent specificity for activated T lymphocytes. We hypothesized that IP-10 was relevant not only for recruiting T cells to inflammatory sites, but also for regulating cytokine synthesis patterns. We examined the effect of recombinant human IP-10 (rhIP-10) on human interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin 4 (IL-4) production by fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We demonstrate for the first time that this CXC chemokine selectively up-regulates human T cell cytokine synthesis, with enhancement selectively targeted to promotion of Th1-like dominance. Superantigen (TSST-1), soluble anti-CD3 mAb, and phytohemagglutinin were used to activate distinct intracellular signaling pathways, thereby inducing quantitatively different IFN-gamma:IL-4 ratios. Selective enhancement of IFN-gamma responses was consistently observed, with median increases of 105-470%. Environmental antigens (Ag) were used to evaluate IP-10's effect on CD4-dependent, chloroquine-sensitive cytokine synthesis. Ag-driven IFN-gamma responses exhibited median 19- to 30-fold increases in the presence of nanomolar concentrations of rhIP-10. IL-4 responses were neither enhanced nor inhibited under any of the conditions tested. These findings suggest a potential role for this T cell-focused chemokine in maintenance of the default Th1-like responses usually seen to environmental Ag and indicate a potential application in the modulation of Ag-driven responses in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1934607620,"Oxidized low density lipoproteins (oxLDL) are thought to play a major role in atherosclerosis. OxLDL exhibit a wide variety of biological effects resulting from their ability to interfere with intracellular signaling. The cellular targets and primary signaling events of oxLDL are unknown. We report that oxLDL elicit, in intact cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of the epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) and activation of its signaling pathway. This activation triggered by oxLDL was associated with derivatization of reactive amino groups of EGFR and was mimicked by 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE, a major lipid peroxidation product of oxLDL). Immunopurified EGFR was derivatized and activated in vitro by oxLDL lipid extracts and 4-HNE, thus indicating that 1) EGFR may be a primary target of oxidized lipids and 2) EGFR derivatization may be associated with activation. The reported data suggest that EGFR acts as a sensor for oxidized lipids. We therefore propose a novel concept of the mechanism by which oxidized lipids (contained in oxLDL or more generally produced during oxidative stress) are able to activate receptor tyrosine kinase and subsequent signaling pathways, resulting finally in a gain of function."
https://openalex.org/W1995139692,"Oxygen isotope measurements of carbonate from martian meteorite ALH 84001 (δ 18 O = 18.3 ± 0.4 per mil, δ 17 O = 10.3 ± 0.2 per mil, and Δ 17 O = 0.8 ± 0.05 per mil) are fractionated with respect to those of silicate minerals. These measurements support the existence of two oxygen isotope reservoirs (the atmosphere and the silicate planet) on Mars at the time of carbonate growth. The cause of the atmospheric oxygen isotope anomaly may be exchange between CO 2 and O( 1 D) produced by the photodecomposition of ozone. Atmospheric oxygen isotope compositions may be transferred to carbonate minerals by CO 2 -H 2 O exchange and mineral growth. A sink of 17 O-depleted oxygen, as required by mass balance, may exist in the planetary regolith."
https://openalex.org/W1977454817,"High-resolution spectroscopy of Mars' atmosphere with the Hubble Space Telescope revealed the deuterium Lyman α line at an intensity of 23 ± 6 rayleighs. This measured intensity corresponds to HD/H 2 = 1.5 ± 0.6 × 10 –4 , which is smaller by a factor of 11 than HDO/H 2 O. This indicates that fractionation of HD/H 2 relative to that of HDO/H 2 O is not kinetically controlled by the rates of formation and destruction of H 2 and HD but is thermodynamically controlled by the isotope exchange HD + H 2 O ↔ HDO + H 2 . Molecular hydrogen is strongly depleted in deuterium relative to water on Mars because of the very long lifetime of H 2 (1200 years). The derived isotope fractionation corresponds to an estimate of a planetwide reservoir of water ice about 5 meters thick that is exchangeable with the atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2084472569,"The effects of double-stranded RNA (synthetic polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid; poly(I-C)) on macrophage expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), production of nitric oxide, and release of interleukin-1 (IL-1) were investigated. Individually, poly(I-C), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulate nitrite production and iNOS expression by RAW 264.7 cells. In combination, the effects of poly(I-C) + IFN-γ are additive, while poly(I-C) does not further potentiate LPS-induced nitrite production. These results suggest that poly(I-C) and LPS may stimulate iNOS expression by similar signaling pathways, which may be independent of pathways activated by IFN-γ. LPS-induced iNOS expression is associated with the activation of NF-κB. We show that inhibition of NF-κB by pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate prevents poly(I-C) + IFN-γ-, poly(I-C) + LPS-, and LPS-induced iNOS expression, nitrite production and IκB degradation by RAW 264.7 cells. The effects of poly(I-C) on iNOS expression appear to be cell-type specific. Poly(I-C), alone or in combination with IFN-γ, does not stimulate, nor does poly(I-C) potentiate, IL-1-induced nitrite production by rat insulinoma RINm5F cells. In addition, we show that the combination of poly(I-C) + IFN-γ stimulates iNOS expression, nitrite production, IκB degradation, and the release of IL-1 by primary mouse macrophages, and these effects are prevented by pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate.

Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Phys. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three isoforms of NOS have been cloned and characterized: endothelial NOS (eNOS or NOSIII), neuronal NOS (nNOS or NOSI), and inducible NOS (iNOS or NOSII) (2Nathan C.

Collectively, eNOS and nNOS are known as cNOS because their enzymatic activity is regulated by Ca2+ and because these isoforms are constitutively expressed. Nitric oxide, produced in low levels by cNOS isoforms, functions as a signaling molecule associated with diverse biological processes including the regulation of vascular tone and neuronal signaling (4Schmidt H.H.H.

Also, Bukrinsky et al. (15Burinsky M.I. Nottet H.S.L.M. Schmidtmayerova H. Dubrovshi L. Flanagan C.R. Mullins M.E. Lipton S.A. Gendelman H.E. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) have shown that infection of human monocytes with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 stimulates iNOS expression and nitric oxide production. Although viral infection stimulates iNOS expression and nitric oxide production, the mechanism by which viral infection stimulates iNOS expression is unknown. NF-κB appears to play a primary role in the transcriptional regulation of iNOS gene expression by macrophages (16Kim H. Lee H.S. Chang K.T. Ko T.H. Baek K.J. Kwon N.S. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4741-4748PubMed Google Scholar, 17Mulsch A. Schray-Utz B. Mordvintcez P.I. Hauschildt S. Busse R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells, NF-κB is found as an inactive heterodimer of p50/p65 subunits bound to the NF-κB inhibitor protein, IκB. Upon stimulation, IκB is phosphorylated on specific serine residues which targets IκB for degradation in a ubiquitin-dependent manner (18Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4563) Google Scholar). The antioxidant inhibitors of NF-κB activation, pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC) and diethyldithiocarbamic acid, prevent lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and LPS + IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression and nitrite production by RAW 264.7 cells (17Mulsch A. Schray-Utz B. Mordvintcez P.I. Hauschildt S. Busse R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), indicating that NF-κB participates in LPS- and LPS + IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression. The active component of a viral infection that stimulates antiviral activities appears to be double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which accumulates during the replication of many viruses. The purpose of this study was to determine if the activation of macrophages by dsRNA results in iNOS expression, nitric oxide production, and IL-1 release, and if these events are dependent on NF-κB activation. We show that dsRNA (in the form of poly(I-C)), in combination with IFN-γ, is a potent activator of murine macrophages, stimulating iNOS expression, nitric oxide production, and IL-1 release. Furthermore, we show that polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I-C))-induced iNOS expression and IL-1 release are associated with the activation of NF-κB. These studies provide direct support for double-stranded RNA as one effector molecule that mediates macrophage activation in an NF-κB-dependent mechanism.

Experiments were initiated by the addition of poly(I-C), mouse IFN-γ, and/or LPS, and the cells were cultured as indicated at 37 °C. In some experiments, cells were pretreated for 30 min with 100 μm PDTC prior to stimulation with poly(I-C), IFN-γ, or LPS. RAW 264.7 cells or CD-1 mouse PEC (400,000 cells/400 μl of complete CMRL-1066), were prepared for Western analysis as described previously (20Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13697-13704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels using standard conditions (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), and transferred to Nitrocell nitrocellulose membranes (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) under semidry transfer conditions. Blots were blocked in TBST (20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5) containing 5% nonfat dry milk and incubated for 1.5 h in primary antisera (rabbit anti-mouse iNOS, 1:2000; rabbit anti-human IκB-α, 1:1000; rabbit anti-human IκB-β, 1:1000) containing 1% nonfat dry milk. The blots were then washed four times with TBST (5 min/wash), and incubated for 45 min at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:7000. The blots were washed three times in TBST and once in 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) at room temperature. Detection of iNOS and IκB was by ECL according to manufacturer's specifications (Amersham Corp.). RAW 264.7 cells (10 × 106 cells/3 ml complete CMRL-1066) were cultured for 6 h at 37 °C with the indicated concentrations of poly(I-C), mouse IFN-γ, and/or LPS. Cells were washed three times with 0.1m phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), and total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN, Inc., Chatsworth, CA). Total cellular RNA (5–10 μg) was denatured and fractionated by gel electrophoresis using a 1.0% agarose gel containing 2.2 mformaldehyde. RNA was transferred by capillary action in 20× SSC (3m NaCl, 0.3 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0) to Duralon UV nylon membranes (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the membranes were hybridized to 32P-labeled probes specific for rat iNOS or cyclophilin (20Heitmeier M.R.

The DNA probes were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming using the Prime-a-Gene nick translation system from Promega (Madison, WI). The iNOS DNA probe corresponds to bases 509–1415 of the rat iNOS coding region. The cyclophilin probe was used as an internal control for RNA loading. Hybridization and autoradiography were performed as described previously (23Burd P.R. Rogers H.W. Gordon J.R. Martin C.A. Jayaraman S. Wilson S.D. Dvorak A.M. Galli S.J. Dorf M.E. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). RAW 264.7 cells (5 × 106cells/3 ml complete CMRL) were incubated for 30 min with 100 μg/ml poly(I-C), 10 μg/ml LPS, and 150 units/ml mouse IFN-γ as indicated. Nuclear extracts were prepared essentially as described by Greenlundet al. (24Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Bibiano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were isolated by centrifugation, washed twice with ice-cold 0.1 mphosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 400 μl of buffer I (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm ZnCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml of each of the following: leupeptin, antipain, aprotinin, and pepstatin A) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cells were lysed by the addition of 50 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 (1.1% final concentration), and cell nuclei were isolated by centrifugation (2000 × g , 4 °C, 5 min). The nuclear pellets were resuspended in 60 μl of buffer II (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm ZnCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 25% glycerol, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml of each of the following: leupeptin, antipain, aprotinin, and pepstatin A) and incubated for 15 min on ice with occasional mixing. Nuclear debris was removed by centrifugation (13,500 rpm, 4 °C, 15 min), and the nuclear protein extract was used for gel shift analysis. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA protein assay according to manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Gel shift analysis of nuclear extracts was performed as described previously (24Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Bibiano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 25Kwon G. Corbett J.A. Rodi C.P. Sullivan P. McDaniel M.L. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4790-4795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The probe consisted of a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the consensus binding sequence for NF-κB (5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′; Santa Cruz) end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). Typical binding reactions consisted of 10 μg of nuclear extract, 0.5 ng of DNA probe, 2 μg/ml poly[d(I-C)] (Boehringer Mannheim) in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol and were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. Binding reactions were separated on 4% Tris-glycine nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in a 2× Tris-glycine (0.05m Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 0.38 m glycine, 2 mm EDTA) buffer system (26Buratowski S. Chodosh L.A. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. Wiley-Interscience, New York1991: 12.2.1-12.2.11Google Scholar). The gels were transferred to Whatman paper, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Nitrite production was determined by mixing 50 μl of culture medium with 50 μl of Griess reagent (27Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10586) Google Scholar). The absorbance at 540 nm was measured, and nitrite concentrations were calculated from a sodium nitrite standard curve. IL-1 release from mouse PEC was performed using the RINm5F cell bioassay as described by Hill et al. (28Hill J.R. Corbett J.A. Baldwin A.C. McDaniel M. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 235: 14-19Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Autoradiograms were scanned into NIH Image version 1.59 using a high performance CCD camera (Cohu, Inc., Brookfield, WI). Densities were determined using NIH Image version 1.59 software. Phosphorimaging analysis of RAW 264.7 cell mRNA accumulation experiments (normalized to cyclophilin mRNA levels) was performed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and Molecular Dynamics ImageQuant Software Version 3.3 (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). For Western blot data, autoradiograms were scanned into NIH Image and then imported into Canvas 3.5 (Deneba Software, Miami, FL) for the preparation of figures. LPS and IFN-γ alone will activate mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cells, to express iNOS and produce nitric oxide; however, maximal production of nitric oxide occurs in response to a combination of LPS + IFN-γ. To determine if dsRNA stimulates macrophage activation, the effects of the synthetic dsRNA molecule, poly(I-C), alone or in combination with LPS and IFN-γ, on nitrite production by RAW 264.7 cells were examined. As shown in Fig. 1 a , a 24-h incubation of RAW 264.7 cells with either poly(I-C) (100 μg/ml) or IFN-γ (150 units/ml) stimulates a ∼9- and ∼6-fold increase in nitrite production, respectively. While poly(I-C) does not appear to further increase the level of nitrite produced in response to LPS, in combination with IFN-γ, poly(I-C) stimulates an over 20-fold increase in nitrite production by RAW 264.7 cells. The levels of nitrite production in response to poly(I-C) + IFN-γ are similar in magnitude to the effects of IFN-γ + LPS on RAW 264.7 cell nitrite production. AG, a selective inhibitor of iNOS (29Corbett J.A. Tilton R.G. Chang K. Hasan K.S. Ido Y. Wang J.L. Sweetland M.A. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Williamson J.R. McDaniel M.L. Diabetes. 1991; 41: 552-556Crossref Scopus (612) Google Scholar), completely prevents poly(I-C)- (data not shown), IFN-γ- (data not shown), poly(I-C) + IFN-γ-, poly(I-C) + LPS-, and LPS + IFN-γ-induced nitrite production by RAW 264.7 cells. The concentration-dependent effects of poly(I-C) on nitrite production by RAW 264.7 cells are shown in Fig. 1 b . Alone, poly(I-C) stimulates the production of nitrite by RAW 264.7 cells at concentrations from 10 to 100 μg/ml. The maximal effect of poly(I-C) on nitrite production by RAW 264.7 cells is observed at concentrations of 50–100 μg/ml. IFN-γ alone also stimulates nitrite production by RAW 264.7 cells, and this effect is potentiated in a concentration-dependent manner by poly(I-C). Poly(I-C) + IFN-γ stimulates an over 20-fold increase in nitrite production, which is maximal at 50–100 μg/ml poly(I-C) + 150 units/ml IFN-γ. These findings indicate that alone, poly(I-C) is capable of stimulating RAW 264.7 cell production of nitric oxide; however, the levels are significantly enhanced in the presence of IFN-γ. In addition, these findings indicate that poly(I-C) does not further enhance the levels of nitrite produced in response to LPS. The effects of poly(I-C), in the presence or absence of IFN-γ and LPS, on iNOS mRNA accumulation in RAW 264.7 cells was examined by Northern blot analysis. Individually, poly(I-C) and IFN-γ stimulate the expression of barely detectable levels of iNOS mRNA following a 6-h exposure (∼7- and ∼9-fold increase above control as determined by phosphorimaging analysis, respectively; Fig. 1 c ). However, the combination of poly(I-C) + IFN-γ stimulates a ∼90-fold increase in iNOS mRNA accumulation. Similarly to nitrite production shown in Fig. 1 a , poly(I-C) does not further increase the levels of iNOS mRNA accumulation in response to LPS (∼22-fold above control for both). Also, iNOS mRNA accumulation in response to poly(I-C) + IFN-γ is only slightly (∼3-fold) less than that accumulated in response to LPS + IFN-γ. The effects of poly(I-C), alone or in combination with LPS and IFN-γ, on iNOS protein expression (Fig. 1 d ) are similar to the effects of these agents on iNOS mRNA accumulation. RAW 264.7 cells express low levels of iNOS in response to poly(I-C) or IFN-γ; however, iNOS expression is drastically increased in response to the combination of poly(I-C) + IFN-γ. Poly(I-C) also appears to increase the level of iNOS expression in response to LPS; however, the increase in iNOS protein expression is less than ∼2-fold (as determined by densitometric analysis) and appears to occur in only ∼40–50% of experiments performed under these conditions (data not shown). Taken together, the results in Fig. 1 demonstrate that poly(I-C) stimulates iNOS expression and nitrite production, and that IFN-γ potentiates the effects of poly(I-C) on RAW 264.7 cells. Since poly(I-C) does not further increase LPS-induced nitrite production by RAW cells and nitrite production in response to poly(I-C) and IFN-γ are additive (Fig. 1), it is likely that the signaling pathway activated by and associated with poly(I-C)-induced iNOS expression may be similar or identical to the pathway activated by LPS. One of the signaling molecules that participates in LPS-induced iNOS expression is the transcriptional regulator NF-κB. Previous studies have shown that the antioxidant PDTC, a potent inhibitor of NF-κB activation (30Schreck R. Alberman K. Baeuerle P.A. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1992; 17: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar), prevents LPS-induced iNOS expression by RAW 264.7 cells (17Mulsch A. Schray-Utz B. Mordvintcez P.I. Hauschildt S. Busse R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To determine if NF-κB participates in poly(I-C)-induced nitrite production and iNOS expression, RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated for 30 min with 100 μm PDTC. Poly(I-C) (100 μg/ml), IFN-γ (150 units/ml), and LPS (10 μg/ml) were then added, and the cells were cultured for 24 h. As shown in Fig.2 a , PDTC completely prevents poly(I-C)-, poly(I-C) + IFN-γ-, LPS-, and LPS + poly(I-C)-induced nitrite production by RAW 264.7 cells. Consistent with its inhibitory effects on nitrite production, PDTC also inhibits poly(I-C)- (data not shown), poly(I-C) + IFN-γ-, LPS-, and LPS + poly(I-C)-induced iNOS protein expression (Fig. 2 b ). These findings provide evidence that poly(I-C) (in the presence or absence of IFN-γ) stimulates iNOS expression by a mechanism that is associated with the activation of NF-κB. To determine if dsRNA activates NF-κB, we have evaluated the effects of poly(I-C) on NF-κB nuclear localization by gel shift analysis. As shown in Fig. 2 c , treatment of RAW 264.7 cells for 30 min with poly(I-C) stimulates the nuclear localization of NF-κB, as evidenced by the reduced mobility of the DNA probe containing the consensus sequence for NF-κB binding. The stimulatory effects of poly(I-C) are similar to the effects of LPS on NF-κB activation by RAW 264.7 cells, and co-incubation of RAW 264.7 cells with IFN-γ or LPS does not further potentiate poly(I-C)-induced NF-κB activation. As controls for the gel shift assays, excess poly[d(I-C)] and cold NF-κB oligonucleotide inhibit the formation of the NF-κB-probe complex, and inclusion of antiserum specific for the p50 and p65 components of NF-κB in the binding reactions results in a further reduction in the mobility (supershift) of the NF-κB complex (data not shown). To further examine the role of poly(I-C) in NF-κB activation, the effects of poly(I-C), alone and in combination with LPS and IFN-γ, on IκB degradation was examined. As shown in Fig. 2 d , treatment of RAW 264.7 cells for 30 min with 100 μg/ml poly(I-C) results in the degradation of greater than 50% of IκB-α. IκB-α degradation is prevented by treatment of RAW 264.7 cells for 30 min with PDTC prior to the addition of poly(I-C). In combination, poly(I-C) + IFN-γ stimulate IκB-α degradation to levels similar in magnitude to the individual effects of poly(I-C), LPS, and LPS + poly(I-C), and this effect is prevented by PDTC. Also, PDTC inhibits LPS- and LPS + poly(I-C)-induced IκB-α degradation. We have also examined the effects of poly(I-C), LPS, and IFN-γ, alone and in combination, on IκB-β degradation and have obtained nearly identical results to those shown in Fig. 2 d for IκB-α (data not shown). These findings indicate that poly(I-C) stimulates NF-κB nuclear localization by a mechanism that is associated with the degradation of IκB. The insulinoma RINm5F cell line represents a homogenous population of pancreatic islet β-cells that express iNOS and produce nitric oxide in response to IL-1 (31Corbett J.A. Wang J.L. Sweetland M.S. Lancaster Jr., J.R. McDaniel M.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2384-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In addition, IL-1-induced nitric oxide production by RINm5F cells appears to require the activation of NF-κB as PDTC and diethyldithiocarbamic acid inhibit both NF-κB activation and iNOS expression (25Kwon G. Corbett J.A. Rodi C.P. Sullivan P. McDaniel M.L. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4790-4795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Bedoya F.J. Flodstrom M. Eizirik D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 816-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that IFN-γ potentiates IL-1-induced iNOS expression and nitrite production by RINm5F cells at concentrations of IL-1 that alone do not stimulate iNOS expression (20Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13697-13704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Since poly(I-C)-induced iNOS expression and nitrite production by RAW 264.7 cells appears to require the activation of NF-κB, and IL-1-induced iNOS expression by RINm5F cells also requires NF-κB activation, the effects of poly(I-C), alone and in combination with IL-1 and IFN-γ, on nitrite production by RINm5F cells were examined (Fig. 3). Treatment of RINm5F cells with IL-1 stimulates a ∼20-fold increase in nitrite production following a 24-h incubation. Alone, poly(I-C) does not stimulate nitrite production, nor does it further potentiate IL-1-induced nitrite production by RINm5F cells. Individually, neither IFN-γ (150 units/ml) nor 0.1 units/ml IL-1 stimulate nitrite production by RINm5F cells; however, in combination these two cytokines stimulate the production of nitrite to levels nearly identical to the levels stimulated by maximal concentrations of IL-1 (1 unit/ml). In combination with either IFN-γ or submaximal concentrations of IL-1 (0.1 unit/ml), poly(I-C) does not stimulate nitrite production by RINm5F cells. Poly(I-C) also does not further potentiate IL-1 (submaximal or maximal concentrations) + IFN-γ-induced nitrite production (data not shown). These findings suggest that the actions of poly(I-C) on iNOS expression and nitrite production may be cell-type specific. In contrast to RAW 264.7 cells, resident mouse macrophages require a combination of two signals (e.g. IFN-γ + LPS) for iNOS expression and nitric oxide production. The effects of dsRNA on primary macrophage activation was examined by incubating mouse PEC with poly(I-C) in the presence or absence of IFN-γ and LPS. Alone, neither poly(I-C), IFN-γ, nor LPS stimulate nitrite production or iNOS expression by mouse PEC (Figs. 4, a andb , respectively). However, in combination, poly(I-C) + IFN-γ stimulate the expression of iNOS and the production of nitrite to levels comparable to the effects of IFN-γ + LPS. The production of nitrite in response to poly(I-C) + IFN-γ, or LPS + IFN-γ is completely prevented by the iNOS inhibitor AG. Importantly, the combination of poly(I-C) + LPS does not stimulate iNOS expression or nitrite production by PEC. This finding is consistent with the inability of poly(I-C) to potentiate LPS-induced nitrite production by RAW 264.7 cells. These findings indicate that a combination of poly(I-C) and IFN-γ activates primary macrophages stimulating iNOS expression and nitrite production. Macrophage activation is characterized by the release of high levels of the cytokine IL-1. Using the RINm5F cell bioassay (28Hill J.R. Corbett J.A. Baldwin A.C. McDaniel M. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 235: 14-19Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) we have examined the effects of poly(I-C) on IL-1 release by PEC, and whether poly(I-C)-induced IL-1 release requires NF-κB activation. Alone, poly(I-C) (100 μg/ml), IFN-γ (150 units/ml), or LPS (10 μg/ml) did not stimulate IL-1 release by PEC following a 24-h incubation (Fig.5 a ). However, the combinations of poly(I-C) + IFN-γ and LPS + IFN-γ stimulate the release of IL-1 to levels that are over 10-fold higher than that of control PEC. Preincubation of mouse PEC for 30 min with 100 μm PDTC completely inhibits poly(I-C) + IFN-γ-induced IL-1 release, implicating a role for NF-κB activation in IL-1 release by PEC. To further examine the role of poly(I-C) on NF-κB activation in mouse PEC, the effects of poly(I-C), alone and in combination with LPS and IFN-γ, on IκB-α degradation was examined. Similarly to RAW 264.7 cells, poly(I-C), LPS, poly(I-C) + IFN-γ and LPS + poly(I-C) induce the degradation of greater than 50% of IκB-α, and these effects are prevented by PDTC (Fig. 5 b ). PDTC also prevents poly(I-C) + IFN-γ- and LPS + IFN-γ-induced nitrite formation by CD-1 mouse PEC (data not shown). These findings implicate IκB degradation and NF-κB activation in poly(I-C) + IFN-γ-induced nitrite production and IL-1 release by mouse macrophages. One cellular response to viral infection is the expression of iNOS and the increased production of nitric oxide (8Croen K.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2446-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 9Mannick J.B. Res. Immunol. 1995; 146: 693-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which viral infection stimulates iNOS expression is unknown. The active component of viral infection appears to be dsRNA, which accumulates during replication of many viruses (33McNair A.N.B. Kerr I.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1992; 56: 79-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It was first demonstrated in 1971 that treatment with dsRNA (poly(I-C)) renders macrophages cytotoxic to target cells in a manner similar to the actions of endotoxin and lipid A (34Alexander P. Evans R. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 232: 76-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). dsRNA-induced inhibition of protein translation and expression of type I interferons are associated with the antiviral activity in infected cells (33McNair A.N.B. Kerr I.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1992; 56: 79-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 35Marcus P.I. Friedman R.M. Interferons 3: Mechanisms of Production and Action. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., New York1984: 113-117Google Scholar). In the current study, the effects of dsRNA on macrophage activation and the mechanism by which dsRNA activates macrophages have been examined. Treatment of RAW 264.7 cells with poly(I-C) stimulates iNOS expression and nitrite production. IFN-γ potentiates poly(I-C)-induced iNOS expression and nitrite production, while LPS does not further potentiate poly(I-C)-induced nitrite production by RAW 264.7 cells. Alone, poly(I-C) does not stimulate iNOS expression by primary macrophages (PEC); however, in combination with IFN-γ, poly(I-C) stimulates iNOS expression and high levels of nitrite production. In addition, poly(I-C) + IFN-γ stimulate IL-1 release by mouse PEC. Similar to the inability of LPS to enhance poly(I-C)-induced nitrite production by RAW 264.7 cells, poly(I-C), in combination with LPS, does not stimulate iNOS expression, nitrite production, or IL-1 release by mouse PEC. Poly(I-C) appears to stimulate iNOS expression by a mechanism similar to that induced by LPS because the effects of LPS and poly(I-C) are not additive, while RAW 264.7 cell expression of iNOS in response to poly(I-C) and IFN-γ are additive. LPS-induced iNOS expression by RAW 264.7 cells requires the activation of NF-κB (17Mulsch A. Schray-Utz B. Mordvintcez P.I. Hauschildt S. Busse R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Our studies show that poly(I-C)- and poly(I-C) + IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression, nitrite production, and IκB degradation by RAW 264.7 cells is prevented by the NF-κB inhibitor PDTC. In addition, PDTC inhibits poly(I-C) + IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression, nitrite production (data not shown), IκB degradation and IL-1 release by PEC. These findings indicate that poly(I-C)-induced IκB degradation and NF-κB nuclear localization participate in poly(I-C)- and poly(I-C) + IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression by RAW 264.7 cells and mouse PEC. IκB is phosphorylated on specific serine residues, and it is this phosphorylation that appears to direct proteolytic degradation of IκB (18Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4563) Google Scholar). The dsRNA-dependent protein kinase is one potential candidate that may phosphorylate IκB in response to poly(I-C). dsRNA (poly(I-C) and viral dsRNA) is known to activate dsRNA-dependent protein kinase by autophosphorylation (36Galabru J. Hovanessian A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15538-15544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in vitro phosphorylation studies have shown that IκB is one substrate for this kinase (37Kumar A. Haque J. Lacoste J. Hiscott J. Williams B.R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6288-6292Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). We are currently examining the effects of poly(I-C) on dsRNA-dependent protein kinase autophosphorylation in both RAW 264.7 cells and PEC. The effects of poly(I-C) on iNOS expression appear to be cell-type specific. While poly(I-C), alone and in combination with IFN-γ, stimulates iNOS expression by RAW 264.7 cells, poly(I-C), alone or in combination with IFN-γ, does not induce nor does it enhance IL-1-induced nitrite production by the pancreatic beta cell line RINm5F. Previous studies have shown that IL-1 stimulates high levels of iNOS expression and nitric oxide production by RINm5F cells, and the actions of IL-1 are potentiated by IFN-γ (20Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13697-13704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 31Corbett J.A. Wang J.L. Sweetland M.S. Lancaster Jr., J.R. McDaniel M.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2384-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). IL-1-induced iNOS expression by RINm5F cells is associated with IκB degradation 2J. A. Corbett, unpublished observation. and NF-κB nuclear localization (25Kwon G. Corbett J.A. Rodi C.P. Sullivan P. McDaniel M.L. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4790-4795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Bedoya F.J. Flodstrom M. Eizirik D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 816-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Poly(I-C) stimulates IκB degradation in RINm5F cells (data not shown); however, poly(I-C) does not stimulate iNOS expression or nitrite production. These results indicate that other transcriptional regulators in addition to NF-κB are required for IL-1-induced iNOS expression by RINm5F cells. The antiviral response generated in infected cells includes the expression of type 1 interferons, and the inhibition of protein synthesis due to the phosphorylation of elongation factor 2α (33McNair A.N.B.

In this study, evidence is presented which implicates NF-κB as one transcriptional regulator that is activated and participates in the antiviral response triggered by treatment of macrophages with dsRNA. In addition, IL-1, released following dsRNA treatment (in the presence of IFN-γ), may also play a primary role in the antiviral activities of macrophages.

https://openalex.org/W1993388352,"The synthesis of polyphosphinine macrocycles, which consist of a 16-membered ring with four phosphorus atoms (P4) and a 12-membered ring with three phosphorus atoms (P3), is described. Their high coordination ability is demonstrated by the quantitative synthesis of the rhodium and iridium cation complexes of the P4 macrocycle and by quantitative synthesis of the W(CO)3 complex of the P3 compound. Unlike the other available macrocyclic ligands bearing oxygen, sulfur, di- or tricoordinate nitrogen, and even tricoordinate phosphorus as ligating atoms, which are all essentially final sigma donors, these dicoordinate phosphorus-based macrocycles have strong pi-acceptor properties. Their use can be envisaged for the stabilization of negative oxidation states of transition metals or in reductive catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1964716733,"We characterized changes of nucleosome assembly activity, intracellular localization, and reversible phosphorylation of the human chromatin assembly factor CAF-1 during the somatic cell division cycle. HeLa cells were synchronized in the G1, S, G2, and M phases of the cell cycle. All three subunits of human CAF-1 (p150, p60, and p48) are present during the entire cell cycle. In interphase, p150 and p60 are bound to the nucleus, but they predominantly dissociate from chromatin during mitosis. During S phase, p150 and p60 are concentrated at sites of intranuclear DNA replication. Only a fraction of total p48 is associated with p150 and p60, and the majority is present in other high molecular weight complexes. The other nucleosome assembly protein, NAP-1, is predominantly cytosolic throughout the cell cycle. Human CAF-1 efficiently mediates nucleosome assembly during complementary DNA strand synthesis in G1, S, and G2 phase cytosolic extracts. Active CAF-1 can be isolated as a 6.5 S complex from G1, S, and G2phase nuclei. In contrast, CAF-1 isolated from mitotic cytosol does not support nucleosome assembly during DNA synthesis. In mitosis, the p60 subunit of inactive CAF-1 is hyperphosphorylated, whereas active CAF-1 in interphase contains hypophosphorylated and/or phosphorylated forms of p60.

The genomic DNA of a eukaryotic cell is assembled into chromatin. The repeated structural subunit is the nucleosome core particle, in which 145 base pairs of DNA are wrapped in 1.75 superhelical turns around a central core histone octamer, consisting of two copies of each histone H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (1Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (7040) Google Scholar). Higher order structures can be formed by association of nucleosome core arrays on the genomic DNA with linker histones and non-histone chromatin proteins (reviewed in Ref. 2Van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1989Crossref Google Scholar). This assembly not only serves as a means to compact the genomic DNA within the confines of the nucleus but also participates in the regulation of gene expression and, perhaps, DNA replication and repair (for reviews see Refs. 3Brownell J.E. Allis C.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 4Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2430) Google Scholar, 5Krude T.

In proliferating cells, the bulk of chromatin is assembled following DNA replication during the S phase of the cell division cycle. Histone proteins are synthesized in S phase and incorporated into nucleosomes on newly replicated DNA (8Jackson V.

Newly synthesized histones differ from bulk histones in their posttranslational modification. Newly synthesized histones H3 and H4 are acetylated on specific lysine residues before incorporation into nucleosomes (3Brownell J.E. Allis C.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 11Sobel R.E. Cook R.G. Perry C.A. Annunziato A.T. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1998; 8: 96-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Following nucleosome assembly, these sites become deacetylated by nuclear histone deacetylases (14Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar). De novo assembly of nucleosomes on replicating DNA can be mediated by chromatin assembly factors. Human chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) was purified from proliferating cell nuclei due to its ability to assemble nucleosomes on DNA templates replicating in cell-free extracts (15Smith S. Stillman B. Cell. 1989; 58: 15-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) (reviewed in Refs. 16Kaufman P.D. Curr. Opin.

It mediates the first step of nucleosome assembly, depositing an H3/H4 tetramer onto replicating DNA (18Smith S. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In human cells, CAF-1 is complexed to newly synthesized and acetylated histones H3 and H4 (12Verreault A. Kaufman P.D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Cell. 1996; 87: 95-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). H2A/H2B dimers are added to the nucleosome precursor in a second step, which is independent of ongoing DNA replication (18Smith S. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and might involve another nucleosome assembly factor, nucleosome assembly protein 1 (NAP-1) 1The abbreviations used are: NAP-1, nucleosome assembly protein 1; TE, 10 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mmEDTA, pH 7.5; TBE, 45 mm Tris-borate, 0.5 mmEDTA, pH 8.4; MNase, micrococcal nuclease; pAb, polyclonal antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody.

Biol. 1996; 16: 3112-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The assembly of new nucleosomes by CAF-1 seems to be an evolutionarily conserved mechanism in eukaryotes, and homologues of CAF-1 have been identified in Drosophila (21Bulger M. Ito T. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Proc. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11726-11730Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 22Kamakaka R.T. Bulger M. Kaufman P.D. Stillman B. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell.

Purified human CAF-1 contains three subunits, termed p150, p60, and p48. The p150 and p60 subunits are both essential for replication-dependent nucleosome assembly in human cell extracts and physically interact with each other (25Kaufman P.D. Kobayashi R. Kessler N. Stillman B. Cell. 1995; 81: 1105-1114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). These two larger subunits of human CAF-1 also co-localize with the sites of nuclear DNA replication in S phase cells (26Krude T. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that CAF-1 may be a physiologically relevant factor for nucleosome assembly during DNA replication in vivo . In yeast cells, however, mutants lacking the p150 and p60 homologues are viable, indicating that alternative nucleosome assembly pathways exist. However, these mutants are deficient in telomeric silencing, implying an involvement of CAF-1 in chromatin assembly in vivo (24Kaufman P.D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 27Enomoto S.P. McCune-Zierath P.D. Gerami-Nejad M. Sanders M.A. Berman J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 358-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The smallest subunit p48 was shown to be a member of a multiprotein family involved in histone binding (12Verreault A. Kaufman P.D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Cell. 1996; 87: 95-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 13Verreault A. Kaufman P.D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 96-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), and it is identical with protein RbAp48 in humans (28Qian Y.-W. Wang Y.-C. Hollingsworth R.E.J. Jones D. Ling N. Lee E.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 29Qian Y.W. Lee E.Y.-H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25507-25513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In addition, p48 is also a subunit of the human histone deacetylase HDAC1 (or HD1 (14Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar)) and of a homologous protein inDrosophila (23Tyler J.K. Bulger M. Kamakaka R.T. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6149-6159Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in yeast, a homologous protein, Hat2p, is a noncatalytic subunit of a cytoplasmic histone H4 acetyltransferase (30Parthun M.R. Widom J. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) and, in human cells, the closely related protein RbAp46 is a histone binding and noncatalytic subunit of the HAT1 histone acetyltransferase (13Verreault A. Kaufman P.D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 96-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the smallest subunit of CAF-1 is present in many multisubunit protein complexes involving histone metabolism (31Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The nucleosome assembly activity of CAF-1 is not restricted to DNA replication. It has been shown recently that CAF-1 is also able to mediate de novo assembly of nucleosomes on UV-irradiated DNA plasmids undergoing DNA excision repair synthesis in vitro (32Gaillard P.-H. Martini E.M.-D. Kaufman P.D. Stillman B. Moustacchi E. Almouzni G. Cell. 1996; 86: 887-896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In yeast, mutations in the two larger subunits of CAF-1 show enhanced UV-sensitivity, supporting an involvement of CAF-1 in DNA repair in vivo (24Kaufman P.D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). It appears that CAF-1 might be generally recruited to any DNA molecule undergoing DNA synthesis, be it DNA replication or repair. These findings warrant an analysis of CAF-1 during the cell division cycle. If CAF-1 is to participate in DNA repair in vivo , we reasoned that it should also be present in an active form in the nonreplicative phases of the cell division cycle. We therefore analyzed the intracellular localization and nucleosome assembly activity of all human CAF-1 subunits during the cell cycle. CAF-1 is present throughout the entire cell cycle, and, during S phase, it is concentrated at sites of intranuclear DNA replication. Importantly, active human CAF-1 is not restricted to S phase nuclei and can be isolated in active form from G1, S, and G2 phase nuclei. CAF-1 predominantly dissociates from chromatin in mitosis and becomes inactive in nucleosome assembly. Hyperphosphorylation of the p60 subunit of CAF-1 during mitosis correlates with chromatin displacement and inactivation, suggesting that nucleosome assembly activity might be regulated by reversible phosphorylation. HeLa-S3 cells were cultured as exponentially growing subconfluent monolayers on 145 mm plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10 unit/ml penicillin (Sigma), and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Sigma). Synchronization of cells was performed as described (33Krude T. Jackman M. Pines J. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1997; 88: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Cell cycle synchronization was monitored by flow cytometry of isolated interphase nuclei or of mitotic cells. Mitotic cells were fixed in 70% ethanol and washed in PBS before staining with propidium iodide (1 ml of solution of 5 μg/ml propidium iodide in PBS containing 0.4% Triton X-100). Isolated interphase nuclei were stained without fixation. Samples were analyzed by FACScan (Becton Dickinson) using the Lysis II-software. Data are presented as histograms showing relative DNA content (x axis) and cell number (y axis). Cytosolic extracts of synchronized HeLa cells were prepared by hypotonic treatment of the cells, followed by Dounce homogenization and centrifugation at 20,000 × g as described previously (34Krude T. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14432-14442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytosolic extracts contained about 9–11 μg/μl protein, determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Nuclear extracts were prepared by resuspending pelleted nuclei from the preparation of cytosolic extracts in 20 mm K-HEPES (pH 7.8), 0.4 m NaCl, 5 mm potassium acetate, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol at 1.5 × 108 nuclei/ml (33Krude T. Jackman M. Pines J. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1997; 88: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Proteins bound to nuclei were extracted with constant agitation for 60 min at 4 °C. Residual nuclear material was pelleted for 30 min at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf 5415C centrifuge. The supernatant was freshly prepared for each experiment. For an extraction of chromosomal proteins from mitotic cells, condensed chromatin from nocodazole-arrested cells was used in place of interphase nuclei. These extracts contained 4–7 μg/μl protein. For fractionation by glycerol gradient centrifugation (34Krude T. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14432-14442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 300–400 μl (1.2–2 mg of protein) of extract were directly applied to a linear 5-ml glycerol gradient (15–30%) in gradient buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.01% Nonidet P40; 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH7.5). Centrifugation was performed in a Beckman SW55 rotor at 45,000 rpm for 20 h at 4 °C. The gradient was fractionated and stored at −20 °C. Reactions were essentially performed as described (34Krude T. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14432-14442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the following modifications: standard reactions contained 30 mm NaCl, cytosolic extract (150 μg of protein for G1, G2, and M phase and 200 μg of protein for S phase extracts), the buffered nucleotide mixture, including an ATP-regenerating system and 25 ng of M13mp18-single-stranded DNA (34Krude T. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14432-14442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Where indicated, 4–10 μl (6 μg of total protein) of glycerol gradient fractions were added before the nucleotide mixture. In control reactions, identical volumes of gradient buffer (15% glycerol) were used. Reactions were mixed on ice and started by transferring to 37 °C. Standard reaction time was 120 min. For reactions monitoring DNA supercoiling in the absence of DNA synthesis, 50 ng of double-stranded M13mp18 DNA were used as substrate in the absence of radioactive dATP. Four identical reactions were pooled to yield sufficient DNA for visualization by ethidium bromide. Replication reactions were stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 2× stop mixture (2% sarcosyl, 0.2% SDS, 20 mm EDTA) and extracted in phenol-chloroform. DNA was ethanol precipitated, dissolved in TE buffer, and loaded onto 0.75% agarose gels. Gel electrophoresis was performed at room temperature in 0.5× TBE buffer at 4 V/cm. DNA was visualized either by autoradiography of the dried gel or by ethidium bromide staining after RNaseA digestion, as indicated in the figure legends. For micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestions, the products of in vitro DNA synthesis reactions were treated with the indicated amount of MNase (Boehringer Mannheim): four identical assays were pooled, adjusted to 2 mm CaCl2, subsequently digested with MNase at room temperature for 15 min, and processed as described (35Shimamura A.D. Tremethick D. Worcel A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4257-4269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CAF-1 p60 encoding cDNA was isolated by reverse transcription of total HeLa RNA and PCR using primers matching the 5′ and 3′ coding region of the published sequence (25Kaufman P.D. Kobayashi R. Kessler N. Stillman B. Cell. 1995; 81: 1105-1114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The PCR product was cloned in the pET23a vector (Novagen).Escherichia coli C41(BL21) (36Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar) was transformed with pETp60 and overexpressed p60 protein was extracted from inclusion bodies with 8 m urea. The protein was further purified to >90% homogeneity by Ni2+-NTA chromatography (Quiagen). Rabbits were immunized with the purified recombinant p60 to give anti-p60 antisera. Antibodies against p60 were affinity-purified from the antisera by column chromatography with a p60 resin, which was prepared by coupling purified recombinant p60 to Sulfolink Gel (Pierce). The antibodies were eluted from the resin with 100 mmglycine-HCl (pH 2.0). The resulting solution was neutralized with ¼ volume of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and then precipitated with ammonium sulfate. The pellet was resuspended in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 10% glycerol. Purified antibody was cross-linked to Sepharose A beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using dimethyl-pimelimidate as described (37Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Precleared S phase nuclear extract (100 μg of protein) was incubated with cross-linked antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C and washed 5 times with 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 135 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Bound proteins were eluted with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer without β-mercaptoethanol. Protein samples were subjected to electrophoresis on denaturing 8% polyacrylamide gels (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207843) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore) and analyzed by Western blotting, using rabbit polyclonal antibodies (pAb1) or mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAb60–53 and mAb1–150 (39Smith S. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12041-12047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); mAb11G10 (29Qian Y.W. Lee E.Y.-H.P. J. Biol.

The proteins were detected with ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in conjunction with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies. Dephosphorylation reactions were carried out with λ phosphatase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's manual. 10 units of enzyme per μl of the reaction were used. The analysis of isolated HeLa cell nuclei by confocal laser scanning immunofluorescence microscopy was performed exactly as detailed previously (26Krude T. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 33Krude T. Jackman M. Pines J. Laskey R.A.

Secondary antibodies were fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (both Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HeLa cells were synchronized in the G1, S, G2, and M phases of the the somatic cell cycle. Flow cytometry of isolated G1, S, and G2 phase nuclei and of entire mitotic cells confirmed successful synchronization (Fig. 1). Preparations of S phase cells were enriched in early S phase, and preparations of G2 phase cells contained up to 30% late S phase contaminants (Fig. 1) as consequences of the synchronization procedures. These synchronized cell populations were used as sources for preparation of cytosolic extracts and for the isolation of CAF-1.

As a prerequisite for studying DNA synthesis-dependent nucleosome assembly in vitro , we first asked whether cytosolic extracts from synchronized cells are able to support DNA synthesis. Single-stranded circular DNA was used as template for complementary DNA strand synthesis in cytosolic extracts, supplemented with deoxy- and ribonucleoside triphosphates and radioactive dATP as a tracer (34Krude T. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14432-14442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After deproteinization, replicated double-stranded DNA was detected by agarose gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Double-stranded DNA reaction products comprise (i) fully replicated and covalently closed molecules migrating as relaxed or supercoiled topoisomers, (ii) relaxed open circular form II DNA products still containing single-stranded gaps, and (iii) linear form III DNA products due to a limited nucleolytic cleavage of the single-stranded templates during the reaction (34Krude T. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14432-14442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytosolic extracts from G1, S, and G2 phases supported efficient complementary DNA strand synthesis, but mitotic extracts did not (Fig. 2 A ). In G1 and S phase extracts, the covalently closed double-stranded DNA reaction products were predominantly relaxed or contained only a few supercoils. Surprisingly, in G2 phase extract, these reaction products were predominantly supercoiled, suggesting nucleosome assembly during the reaction. Supercoiling during DNA synthesis in cytosolic extracts depends on DNA synthesis because double-stranded DNA templates incubated under identical conditions were efficiently relaxed by endogenous topoisomerases (Fig.2 B ). We next isolated human CAF-1 from proliferating cell nuclei and analyzed its nucleosome assembly activity during complementary DNA strand synthesis in cytosolic extracts from synchronized cells (Fig.3). CAF-1 mediated efficient supercoiling of the covalently closed double-stranded circular DNA reaction products in G1, S, and G2 phase extracts (Fig.3 A ). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis confirmed the formation of negative superhelices in these reactions, indicating an efficient nucleosome assembly mediated by CAF-1 (data not shown, but see Ref. 34Krude T. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14432-14442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of DNA synthesis, double-stranded DNA was relaxed and not supercoiled under otherwise identical conditions (Fig.3 B ), indicating that nucleosome assembly mediated by CAF-1 depends on DNA synthesis in G1, S, and G2 phase cytosolic extracts. We next analyzed the assembled minichromosomes by MNase digestions (Fig. 4). MNase cleaves chromatin preferentially in the linker DNA between adjacent nucleosomes, resulting in nuclease-resistant DNA fragments of mono- and oligonucleosomal length. The nuclease cleavage pattern of minichromosomes confirmed nucleosome assembly by CAF-1 in G1, S, and G2 phase cytosolic extracts (Fig.4). We observed patterns of oligonucleosomes in G1 and G2 phase extracts that are similar to the patterns assembled by CAF-1 in extracts from asynchronously proliferating cells (15Smith S. Stillman B. Cell. 1989; 58: 15-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 18Smith S. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 34Krude T. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14432-14442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we were not able to resolve more than three or four nucleosomes (Fig. 4), indicating an assembly of arrays of irregularly spaced nucleosomes in these extracts. On minichromosomes assembled in S phase extract, we were only able to resolve mononucleosomes containing ∼145 base pairs of DNA as reaction products (Fig. 4), indicating an assembly of irregularly or randomly spaced nucleosomes. We conclude that CAF-1 supports an efficient assembly of nucleosomes in cytosolic extracts from G1, S, and G2 phase cells in a DNA synthesis-dependent manner. Interestingly, neither the ability to support DNA synthesis nor the ability to allow CAF-1 mediated nucleosome assembly during DNA synthesis is restricted to S phase cytosolic extracts, but it occurs also in G1 and G2 phase extracts. In the next set of experiments, we investigated whether active CAF-1 itself is restricted to S phase nuclei or whether it can also be detected in and isolated from cells synchronized in the other phases of the cell cycle. To detect the p60 subunit of human CAF-1, we raised a polyclonal rabbit antiserum against the bacterially expressed product of a full-length cDNA (see under “Experimental Procedures”) and purified monospecific anti-p60 antibodies, termed pAb1. In Western blots of HeLa cell nuclear extracts pAb1 detected multiple bands of p60 (Fig.5, lane 2 ), whereas the monoclonal antibody mAb60–53 (39Smith S. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12041-12047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) detected only one major band (Fig.5, lane 1 ). Purified human CAF-1 contains at least three p60 polypeptides (15Smith S. Stillman B. Cell. 1989; 58: 15-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), reminiscent of the bands detected by pAb1, and it is phosphorylated in vivo (39Smith S. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12041-12047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether the different forms of p60 are due to phosphorylation. Treatment of isolated CAF-1 by λ phosphatase, followed by Western blotting with pAb1, resulted in a single band of faster mobility (Fig. 5, lane 3 ). Inhibition of phosphatase by pyrophosphate resulted in the detection of the full set of p60 bands by pAb1 (Fig. 5, lane 4 ). We conclude that phosphorylated p60 can be detected by pAb1 as the slower migrating forms in Western blots. The p150 and p60 subunits of CAF-1 were originally shown by immunohistochemistry to be nuclear proteins in asynchronously proliferating cells (39Smith S. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12041-12047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When analyzed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy using monoclonal antibodies, they co-localized with sites of DNA replication in isolated S phase nuclei (26Krude T. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We therefore re-investigated the intranuclear localization of CAF-1 using polyclonal antibody pAb1. Intranuclear sites of CAF-1 were first analyzed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 6). The p60 subunit (Fig. 6 A ) directly co-localized with p150 (Fig. 6 B ), confirming that these two subunits are exclusively located at the same intranuclear sites. These sites further coincide with replication foci in S phase nuclei (Fig. 6, C and D ). We did not detect any significant p150 and p60 signal above background fluorescence in G1 or G2 phase nuclei (data not shown; cf. Ref. 26Krude T. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), indicating that in proliferating cells CAF-1 is clearly detected by immunofluorescence microscopy only at replication foci in S phase nuclei. We did not detect a significant p48 signal in isolated HeLa nuclei by immunofluorescence microscopy wi"

To examine whether allelic loss is of prognostic importance in melanoma, disease-free survival was related to loss of heterozygosity on 6q, 9p and 10q in 83 individuals with sporadic primary cutaneous melanoma. Loss of chromosome arms 6q and 10q were each significantly associated with a poorer clinical outcome (P=0.013 and P=0.001 respectively). In a subgroup of 41 subjects whose primary tumours were allelotyped, the fractional allelic loss (FAL) at 39 autosomal arms also significantly correlated with disease-free survival (P=0.013), with an increase in FAL associated with a poorer outcome; this association remained significant when controlled for tumour thickness (P=0.035). In addition, a greater proportion of cells were immunopositive for Ki67 antigen, p53 and p21WAF1 protein in the primary melanomas than in the benign melanocytic nevi, however, only p53 over-expression was significantly associated with improved survival (P=0.041)."

Now, similar data from a second encounter (C9) corroborate this conclusion, but more accurate data from a third encounter (C10) indicate that the rock and ice within Callisto have partially, but not completely, separated. Callisto may be differentiated into a rock-metal core less than 25 percent of Callisto's radius, an outer layer of clean ice less than 350 km thick, and a middle layer of mixed rock and ice. Models in which ice and rock are mixed all the way to the center of Callisto are also consistent with the data."
https://openalex.org/W2017841963,"Germline mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 have been linked to the development of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and other malignancies. Recent studies suggest that the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene products may function in the sensing and/or repair of DNA damage. To investigate this possibility, we determined the effects of various DNA-damaging agents and other cytotoxic agents on the mRNA levels of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the MCF-7 and other human breast cancer cell lines. We found that several agents, including adriamycin (a DNA intercalator and inhibitor of topoisomerase II), camptothecin (a topoisomerase I inhibitor), and ultraviolet radiation induced significant decreases in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mRNA levels. Decreased levels of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mRNAs were observed within 6–12 h after treatment with adriamycin and persisted for at least 72 h. Adriamycin also induced decreases in BRCA1 protein levels; but these decreases required several days. U.V. radiation induced dose-dependent down-regulation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mRNAs, with significant decreases in both mRNAs at doses as low as 2.5 J/m2, a dose that yielded very little cytotoxicity. Adriamycin-induced down-regulation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mRNAs was first observed at doses that yielded relatively little cytotoxicity and little or no apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Adriamycin and U.V. radiation induced distinct dose- and time-dependent alterations in the cell cycle distribution; but these alterations did not correlate well with corresponding changes in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mRNA levels. However, the adriamycin-induced reduction in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mRNA levels was correlated with p53 functional status. MCF-7 cells transfected with a dominant negative mutant p53 (143 val→ala) required at least tenfold higher doses of adriamycin to down-regulate BRCA1 and BRCA2 mRNAs than did parental MCF-7 cells or control-transfected MCF-7 clones. These results suggest that BRCA1 and BRCA2 may play roles in the cellular response to DNA-damaging agents and that there may be a p53-sensitive component to the regulation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mRNA expression."
https://openalex.org/W1491535877,"The mechanisms by which neurons die after stroke and status epilepticus and related neuropathological conditions are unclear, but may involve voltage-dependent Na+ channels, glutamate receptors, and nitric oxide (NO·). These questions were investigated using an in vitro primary cell culture model in which hippocampal pyramidal neurons undergo a gradual and delayed neurodegeneration induced by enhanced excitatory neurotransmission. When cells were treated with Mg2+-free, glycine-supplemented medium for a brief period (15 min) and examined 24 h later, ~30–40% of the neurons had died. Cell death could be inhibited by blockers of voltage-sensitive Na+ channels and by N-methyl-Daspartate receptor antagonists. Application of either the endogenous antioxidant melatonin (EC50: 19.2±2.8 μM) or the NO· synthase inhibitor Nω-nitro- L-arginine after, but not during, Mg2+-free exposure protected against delayed neuronal death; significant neuroprotection was observed when the addition was delayed for up to 4 h. This operational time window suggests that an enduring production of NO· and reactive oxygen species from neuronal sources is responsible for delayed cell death. A role for reactive oxygen species in this injury process was strengthened by the finding that, whereas neurons cocultured with astroglia were more resistant to killing, agents capable of lowering intracellular glutathione negated this protection. Because secretion levels of melatonin are decreased with aging, reductions in this pineal hormone may place neurons at a heightened risk for damage by excitatory synaptic transmission.—Skaper, S.

Two potential functions of BRCA2 were proposed which includes role in the regulation of transcription and also in DNA repair. Forty-five-amino acid region encoded by exon 3 of BRCA2 was shown to have transcriptional activation function. Recent studies of the several enzymes involved in acetylation and deacetylation of histone residues have revealed a possible relationship between gene transcriptional activation and histone acetylation. Since BRCA2 appear to function as a transcriptional factor, we have tested for Histone acetyl transferase (HAT) activity of BRCA2. Here, we present evidence that BRCA2 has intrinsic HAT activity, which maps to the amino-terminal region of BRCA2. Our results demonstrate that BRCA2 proteins acetylate primarily H3 and H4 of free histones. These observations suggest that HAT activity of BRCA2 may play an important role in the regulation of transcription and tumor suppressor function."

Initial synthetic processing events for SP-C include post-translational cleavages of the COOH terminus of proSP-C21 yielding two intermediates (16 and 6 kDa). To test the role of specific COOH-terminal domains in intracellular targeting and proteolysis of proSP-C21, synthesis and processing of SP-C was evaluated using a lung epithelial cell line (A549) transfected with a eukaryotic expression vector containing either the full-length cDNA for rat SP-C (SP-Cwt) or one of six polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-generated COOH terminally truncated forms (SP-C1–185, SP-C1–175, SP-C1–147, SP-C1–120, SP-C1–72, and SP-C1–59). Using in vitro transcription/translation, each of the seven constructs produced a35S-labeled product of appropriate length which could be immunoprecipitated by epitope specific proSP-C antisera. Immunoprecipitation of 35S-labeled A549 cell lysates from SP-Cwt transfectants demonstrated rapid synthesis of [35S]proSP-C21 with processing to SP-C16 and SP-C6 intermediates via cleavages of the COOH-terminal propeptide. Both the intermediates as well as the kinetics of processing in A549 cells were similar to that observed in rat type II cells. In contrast, constructs SP-C1–185, SP-C1–175, SP-C1–147, SP-C1–120, SP-C1–72, and SP-C1–59 were each translated but degraded without evidence of proteolytic processing. Fluorescence immunocytochemistry identified proSP-Cwt in cytoplasmic vesicles of A549 cells while all COOH-terminal deletional mutants were restricted to an endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi compartment identified by co-localization with fluorescein isothiocyanate-concanavalin A. We conclude that SP-Cwt expressed in A549 cells is directed to cytoplasmic vesicles where it is proteolytically processed in a manner similar to native type II cells and that amino acids Cys186-Ile194 located at the COOH terminus of proSP-C21 are necessary for correct intracellular targeting and subsequent cleavage events.

The alveolar epithelium synthesizes pulmonary surfactant, a surface active lining film consisting of a biochemically complex mixture of lipids and proteins, which serves to reduce surface tension at the alveolar surface, thereby allowing for maintenance of alveolar stability at low lung volumes (end-expiration) (1King R.J.

Furthermore, the use of inhibitors of organellar acidification has further elucidated that these intracellular proteolytic events are taking place within acidic subcellular compartments of the exocytic pathway (15Beers M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14361-14370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Despite what is known of the major cleavage events, their localization, and cellular factors important for the regulation of SP-C synthetic processing, the role of specific peptide domains contained within the proSP-C sequence in the direction of its post-translational processing and/or of its subcellular targeting has not been forthcoming due to limitations imposed by previous experimental models. Additional insights have been hampered because primary alveolar type II cells in culture are phenotypically unstable and not easily transfected (20Lin S. Akinbi H.T. Breslin J.S. Weaver T.E. J. Biol.

The present study was undertaken to identify peptide domains that facilitate intracellular transport and processing of proSP-C. Initially, synthetic processing of wild type SP-C was defined using the A549 lung epithelial cell line transfected with a eukaryotic expression vector containing a full-length rat SP-C cDNA under the control of a strong viral promoter. Results obtained using this system show that the patterns of expression and processing of recombinant SP-C were similar to that observed for endogenous SP-C in native rat type II cells and demonstrate the feasibility of this model for use in studies aimed at evaluating functional domains contained within the proSP-C primary sequence. COOH terminally truncated forms of proSP-C were generated using PCR-based mutagenesis. Transfection of these mutant constructs into A549 cells demonstrated that deletion of as little as 10 amino acids from the COOH terminus of the proSP-C molecule causes mistargeting of the translated protein resulting in disruption of post-translational proteolytic events showing that an intact COOH-terminal peptide of proSP-C is necessary for proper post-translational processing.

Restriction analysis of amplified subclones of pcDNA3-SP-Cwt confirmed successful insertion of a full-length cDNA in the sense orientation. A subclone containing the antisense (−) orientation was also identified and used as a control in transfection studies. Mutant cDNA deletion constructs containing progressively larger truncations of the COOH flanking region of proSP-C (His59-Ile194) (Fig.1) were generated by the PCR.

The open reading frame of each construct was characterized by production of 35S-labeled protein using sequential in vitro transcription/translation of SP-C cDNAs with Trans35S-label and the TNT T7 reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Inc., Madison, WI) as described by the manufacturer. SP-C constructs were transiently transfected into A549 cells using calcium phosphate precipitation (0.18 ml of 0.25 mCaCl2 was added dropwise to 0.18 ml of plasmid DNA dissolved in 2 × HEPES-buffered saline (50 mm HEPES, 280 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm NaPO4, pH 7.1) (24Ausbel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical localization of expressed proSP-C proteins was performed on transfected epithelial cell lines fixed and stained as described previously (17Beers M.F. Wali A. Eckenhoff M.E.F. Feinstein S. Fisher J.H. Fisher A.B. Am J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1992; 7: 368-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). ProSP-C staining was visualized using primary anti-NPROSP-C (1:200) and secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG-Texas red. Concanavlin A conjugated to fluorescein (FITC-ConA) was used for staining ER and Golgi (25Tartakoff A.M. Vassalli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1243-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Fluorescent images were captured using a 12-bit CCD camera and processed using IMAGE 1 software (Universal Imaging Corporation, West Chester, PA). Sixty hours following the introduction of plasmid DNA, transiently transfected cell line monolayers (80–90% confluence) equilibrated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified essential medium-Cys/Met were labeled for 30 min with 100 μCi/ml Trans55S-label, then chased in Met/Cys replete minimal essential medium for up to 4 h. Labeled cells were harvested by scraping and pelleted by centrifugation at 130 × g for 10 min. Fresh type II cells were metabolically labeled with Trans35S-label in serum-free, Met/Cys-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, using suspension cultures (3–5 × 106 cells/ml) as described previously (9Beers M.F. Lomax C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: L744-L753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All radiolabeled cell pellets were solubilized in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, and 5 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin and immunoprecipitated using proSP-C antiserum as previously published (9Beers M.F.

Captured proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography as described below. One-dimensional SDS-PAGE was performed in 16.5% polyacrylamide gels using a Tris-Tricine buffer system (26Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10407) Google Scholar) as modified in our laboratory for surfactant proteins (9Beers M.F. Lomax C. Am. J.

Immunoblotting of transferred samples was done using proSP-C antisera and bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using the ECL kit (Amersham, Inc.). Total protein was quantified by the Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochemistry. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211805) Google Scholar) method using bovine immunoglobulin as standard. Each pcDNA-SP-C construct (Fig. 1) generated in vitro translation products which were immunoprecipitated by epitope-specific proSP-C antisera (Fig. 2). SDS-PAGE of a TNT rabbit reticulocyte lysate reaction containing full-length or truncated plasmid DNA identified 35S-labeled bands of predicted molecular weight which were not seen in reactions omitting plasmid DNA (not shown). The three proSP-C antisera specifically recognized the appropriate in vitro translation product in a pattern restricted by epitope specificity. Similar patterns were obtained using translation products from SP-C1–147, SP-C1–120, and SP-C1–59 (not shown). A549 cells transfected with pcDNA3-SP-Cwtcells stained with anti-NPROSP-C consistently demonstrated expression of proSP-C within cytoplasmic vesicles (Fig.3 A ). The specificity of the immunohistochemical staining was confirmed by the substitution of preimmune serum for primary anti-NPROSP-C (Fig. 3 B ). Control experiments using an antisense construct, pcDNA3-SP-C (−), transfected under identical conditions showed a complete absence of proSP-C staining by the A549 cell line (Fig. 3 C ). Western blots of transient transfections of A549 cells with pcDNA3-SP-Cwt confirmed detectable expression of proSP-C proteins at 48 and 72 h following introduction of DNA (not shown). The processing profile of SP-Cwt expressed in A549 cells was compared with native type II cells. Pulse-chase analysis demonstrates synthesis and proteolytic processing of35S-proSP-C21 by type II cells (Fig.4 A ). Using anti-NPROSP-C (which recognizes all major proSP-C forms),35S-proSP-C21 appeared by completion of the pulse (30 min) followed by a time-dependent appearance of a 16-kDa intermediate and low molecular weight proSP-C forms during the chase. 35S-Lysates from SP-Cwt transfected A549 cells immunoprecipitated under identical conditions yielded the same intermediates (Fig. 4 B ). Immunoprecipitation of SP-Cwt transfected A549 cells with anti-CTERMSP-C demonstrated that initial processing is due to cleavage of COOH-terminal regions (Fig. 4 C ) as had been previously shown for rat type II cells (16Beers M.F. Kim C.Y. Dodia C. Fisher A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20318-20328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of the media failed to detect the presence of proSP-C21 or smaller intermediates at chase periods of up to 4 h (not shown). The kinetics of early proSP-C processing by A549 cells was nearly identical to that of rat type II cells (Fig.5). In both models, at the conclusion of the pulse period, almost 95% of the total counts were in SP-C21. A quantitative precursor-product relationship between SP-C21 and SP-C16 can be seen. The appearance of low molecular weight forms immediately followed the appearance of SP-C16. A549 cells transiently transfecte"
https://openalex.org/W2128199646,"Neutrophil degranulation is an important event in inflammatory responses. We examined the regulation of neutrophil (PMN) degranulation by resting and activated human endothelial cells. Whereas PMNs adherent to endothelial cells that were stimulated to express P-selectin and platelet-activating factor did not release the specific granule marker lactoferrin or the primary granule enzyme, elastase, PMNs adherent to endothelial cells stimulated with interleukin-1 (IL-1) or tumor necrosis factor secreted both. PMN degranulation was dependent on the time of incubation of endothelial cells with the cytokine, its concentration, and the time of incubation of the PMNs with endothelial cells. Degranulation of PMNs and their adhesion to stimulated endothelial cells are correlated events, but they could be dissociated by blocking the tethering molecules used by the endothelial cells and neutrophils under these conditions. This suggested that paracrine signaling molecules that induce PMN degranulation are produced by cytokine-stimulated endothelial cells. We found that endothelial cells stimulated with IL-1 release newly synthesized degranulating factors that require transcription and translation. IL-8 was synthesized, released, and signaled granular secretion by PMNs. However, experiments with blocking antibodies indicated the presence of an additional degranulating factor not accounted for by IL-8. These experiments demonstrate that human endothelial cells regulate degranulation of neutrophils by generating signaling factors that are expressed differentially depending on the endothelial agonist and other features. Active modification of neutrophil granular secretion by endothelial cells can influence physiologic acute inflammatory responses but may also contribute to pathologic vascular and tissue damage."
https://openalex.org/W1988270234,"The SH2 and SH3 binding partner AFAP-110 is a tyrosine phosphorylated substrate of Src. AFAP-110 has been hypothesized to link Src to actin filaments, which may contribute to the effects of Src upon actin filament integrity. However, it has been unclear what effect activated Src (Src527F) has upon AFAP-110 structure or function and whether AFAP-110 plays a role in actin filament integrity. We report here that the carboxy terminal 127 amino acids of AFAP-110 are comprised of an alpha-helical region that contains a leucine zipper motif. This indicated the potential of AFAP-110 to self-associate. Expression of the carboxy terminus as a fusion protein (GST-cterm) will permit affinity absorption of cellular AFAP-110. The integrity of the alpha-helical leucine zipper motif in GST-cterm is required for affinity absorption, but binding is not due to a classical leucine zipper interaction. Co-expression of Src527F, unlike cSrc, will abrogate affinity absorption of AFAP-110 with GST-cterm. These data indicate that Src527F has affected a change in the carboxy terminal structure that renders AFAP-110 unavailable for affinity absorption. Superose chromatography demonstrate that AFAP-110 will fractionate as a monomer or multimer, indicating AFAP-110 can be detected in a self-associated form in cell lysates. Co-expression of Src527F resulted in AFAP-110 fractionating with a molecular weight that predicts only a multimeric population. Deletional mutagenesis also indicate a biological role for the carboxy terminus in cellular localization and actin filament integrity. Deletion of the entire carboxy terminal alpha-helix (84 amino acids) will not permit AFAP-110 to efficiently colocalize with actin filaments or the cell membrane. Deletion of only the leucine zipper region of the carboxy terminal alpha-helix (44 amino acids) from AFAP-110 (AFAPAdeltazip) demonstrate that both AFAPdeltalzip and actin filaments are repositioned into rosette-like structures, similar to the effects of Src527F, while co-expression of AFAP-110 with cSrc will not affect actin filaments. These data indicate that AFAP-110 can play an important role in modulating actin filament integrity through carboxy terminal interactions that can be affected by Src527F."
https://openalex.org/W1550154450,"In spite of the epidemiological evidence supporting a synergism between alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking in the pathogenesis of cancers of the aerodigestive tract, there is a paucity of experimental studies evaluating the effects of these agents under well-controlled conditions and exploring the mechanisms involved. We exposed groups of female BD6 rats, aged 8 months, to ethanol (5% in drinking water for 8 consecutive months) and/or whole-body to mainstream cigarette smoke (1 h/day, 5 days/week for 8 months). DNA was purified from different organs and analyzed for the presence of DNA-protein crosslinks and 32P-postlabeled DNA adducts after butanol enrichment. No significant increase of DNA-protein crosslinks, compared to untreated controls, was induced by any treatment in liver, lung, or heart. ‘Spontaneous’ nucleotidic modifications were detected by 32P-postlabeling in organs of untreated rats, with the highest levels occurring in the heart. Ingestion of ethanol did not affect DNA adduct levels in any of the organs examined: esophagus, liver, lung, and heart. Exposure to cigarette smoke induced formation of DNA adducts in the lung and heart, but not in the esophagus or liver. The combined ingestion of ethanol resulted in a significant formation of smoke-related DNA adducts in the esophagus and in their further, dramatic increase in the heart. It thus appears that ethanol consumption increases the bioavailability of DNA binding smoke components in the upper digestive tract and favors their systemic distribution. The mechanisms responsible for the interaction between ethanol and smoke and for the selective localization of DNA alterations in different organs are discussed. Formation of DNA adducts in the organs examined may be relevant in the pathogenesis of lung and esophageal cancers as well as in the pathogenesis of other types of chronic degenerative diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and cardiomyopathies.—Izzotti A., Balansky R.

https://openalex.org/W2331620970,"The Evi-1 gene encodes a zinc finger transcriptional repressor protein that normally plays a role in development and is frequently activated in myeloid leukaemias. Evi-1 has two distinct DNA binding domains, ZF1 and ZF2, and a defined repressor domain but the function of the remainder of the molecule is unknown. The ZF2 and repressor domains have been shown to be required for transformation and we show here that ZF1 is also required. An alternative splice variant of Evi-1, designated Δ324, encodes a protein which lacks a portion of the ZF1 DNA binding domain and the intervening amino acids 239–514 (designated IR) located between ZF1 and the repressor domain. We show that Δ324 can neither bind ZF1, repress transcription through this site nor transform Rat1 fibroblasts. Reconstitution studies demonstrate that the defect in Δ324 is partially complemented by recreating the ZF1 DNA binding activity. However, full function also requires the IR region which has transcriptional repressor activity. This study shows therefore, that ZF1, ZF2 and repressor domains and the IR region all contribute to the transformation efficiency of the Evi-1 protein."
https://openalex.org/W2154685669,"The Tax proteins of the oncovirinae viruses are phosphorylated transcriptional activators that exhibit oncogenic potential. The role of phosphorylation in their functional activities remains unknown. As a model for the Human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I), Bovine Leukemia Virus (BLV) permits the characterization of viral replication and leukemogenesis in vivo. Here, we show that the BLV Tax protein is phosphorylated on serine residues 106 and 293 both in insect and in mammalian cells. These sites can also be efficiently phosphorylated by the cdc2 and MAP kinases in vitro. Mutation of these residues does not affect the capacity of the Tax protein to function as a transactivator. Indeed, the Tax proteins mutated at one or both serines increase LTR-directed viral transcription at levels similar to those obtained with wild-type Tax in cell culture. Moreover, inhibition of Tax phosphorylation by W7, a calmodulin antagonist, does not alter its transactivation activity. Thus, phosphorylation on serines 106 and 293 is not required for transactivation by Tax. However, simultaneous substitution of both serines into alanine residues destroys the capacity of Tax to cooperate with the Ha-ras oncogene to transform primary rat embryo fibroblasts and induce tumors in nude mice. When the serines were replaced with aspartic acid residues, the oncogenic potential of Tax was maintained indicating that the negative charge rather than the phosphate group itself was required for Tax oncogenicity. Finally, to assess the role of the serine residues in vivo, recombinant viruses which express the Tax mutants were constructed and injected into sheep. It appeared that the mutated proviruses replicate at levels similar to the wild-type virus in vivo. We conclude that Tax phosphorylation is dispensable for transactivation and viral replication in vivo but is required for its oncogenic potential in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2319835600,"Gastrin via its G-protein coupled specific receptor induces transcription of c-fos and c-jun genes through a ras-MAPK pathway. Ornithine Decarboxylase (ODC), a growth regulated proto-oncogene, was chosen to investigate gastrin effects on translation initiation of mRNAs exhibiting a 5′UnTranslated Region (5′UTR) responsible for translation repression in quiescent cells. In AR4-2J tumoral cells, we first demonstrated that gastrin increases ODC mRNA translation. Transient transfections with various CAT chimeric constructs suggested a direct involvement of the 5′UTR in this observation. Translation of this group of mRNAs is enhanced by the availability of the cap-binding protein (eIF4E) that is increased after phosphorylation of its specific binding protein eIF4E-BP1. We found that AR4-2J cells overexpressed eIF4E protein which was not modulated by gastrin treatment. Rapamycin which inhibits 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, completely prevents gastrin-mediated increase of ODC translation indicating that 4E-BP1 could be involved in regulating ODC translation. Implication of 4E-BP1 in mediating gastrin effects is corroborated by the capacity of the ligand to affect 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. These results indicate that gastrin enhances ornithine decarboxylase mRNA translation through a rapamycin sensitive pathway and provide the first evidence in the control of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation after occupancy of a G protein-coupled receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1989887433,"We studied the function of the platelet integrin αIIbβ3 using a B lymphocyte model in which αIIbβ3 can be induced to interact with fibrinogen using phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). To determine whether a G protein-coupled receptor could also activate αIIbβ3 in lymphocytes, we coexpressed the human formyl peptide receptor (fPR) and αIIbβ3, finding that the fPR agonist formyl Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP)-stimulated lymphocyte adherence to immobilized fibrinogen and binding of soluble fibrinogen to the lymphocyte surface. The response to fMLP, but not PMA, was abrogated by pertussis toxin, indicating that the fPR was coupled to the G-protein Gαi, whereas the protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I inhibited the response to both fMLP and PMA, indicating that signaling from the fPR included protein kinase C. On the other hand, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, the Syk inhibitor piceatannol, and the RhoA inhibitor C3 exoenzyme had no effect, implying that neither tyrosine phosphorylation nor the GTPase RhoA were involved. Furthermore, whereas micromolar concentrations of cytochalasin D inhibited the PMA-stimulated interaction of αIIbβ3 with fibrinogen, nanomolar concentrations actually induced fibrinogen binding to unstimulated cells. Our studies demonstrate that αIIbβ3 expressed in B lymphocytes can be activated by a physiologic agonist and outline an activating pathway that includes Gαi, protein kinase C, and the actin cytoskeleton.

Exposure of a binding site for ligands such as fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor on the platelet integrin αIIbβ3 is a prerequisite for platelet aggregation (1Bennett J.S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1996; 16: 31-36Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The process by which this binding site is exposed has been termed “inside-out” signaling and is initiated when agonist-generated intraplatelet signals induce a conformational change in αIIbβ3 by interacting with its cytoplasmic tails (2O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). To study the process of αIIbβ3 activation in vitro , we have developed a model system in which wild-type and mutant αIIbβ3 expressed in GM1500 cells, an Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human B lymphocyte line, can be induced to interact with soluble and immobilized fibrinogen by the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) 1The abbreviations used are: PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PKC, protein kinase C; fPR, formyl peptide receptor; fMLP, formyl Met-Leu-Phe; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PTX, pertussis toxin; RGDS, Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser; BIM I, bisindolylmaleimide I; BIM V, bisindolylmaleimide V; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. 1The abbreviations used are: PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PKC, protein kinase C; fPR, formyl peptide receptor; fMLP, formyl Met-Leu-Phe; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PTX, pertussis toxin; RGDS, Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser; BIM I, bisindolylmaleimide I; BIM V, bisindolylmaleimide V; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate.

Using this system, we observed that the cytoplasmic tail of αIIb is not required for αIIbβ3 function in lymphocytes, that the conserved GFFKR motif in the αIIb tail is required for αIIb to interact with β3, and that signals interacting with the β3 cytoplasmic tail are responsible for the ability of agonists to stimulate αIIbβ3 function (4Loh E.

J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar). While phorbol esters are a potent stimulus for ligand binding to αIIbβ3 in platelets (6Shattil S.J. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 992-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), they bypass the more proximal signaling events that are initiated when agonists bind to their cognate platelet membrane receptors. Most of the known platelet receptors for agonists are seven-transmembrane domain proteins that are coupled to various G proteins (7Brass L.F. Hoffman R. Benz Jr., E.J. Shattil S.J. Furie B. Cohen H.J. Silberstein L.E. Hematology: Basic principles and practive. Churchill Livingstone, New York1995: 1536-1551Google Scholar). Stimulation of these receptors on platelets is known to activate phospholipase Cβ, generate diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate, increase cytosolic calcium, and activate several isoforms of PKC (7Brass L.F. Hoffman R. Benz Jr., E.J. Shattil S.J. Furie B. Cohen H.J. Silberstein L.E. Hematology: Basic principles and practive. Churchill Livingstone, New York1995: 1536-1551Google Scholar). We were interested in determining whether stimulation of a G protein-coupled receptor on B lymphocytes would also expose the ligand-binding domain of αIIbβ3. Honda et al. (8Honda S. Campbell J.J. Andrew D.P. Engelhardt B. Butcher B.A. Warnock R.A. Ye R.D. Butcher E.C. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4026-4035PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that stimulation of the humanN -formyl peptide chemoattractant receptor (fPR) in murine B lymphocytes induces the α4β1-mediated adherence of these cells to VCAM-1. The fPR is a seven-transmembrane domain protein coupled to the G protein Gαi in leukocytes (9Murphy P.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 593-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we coexpressed the human fPR and αIIbβ3 in GM1500 cells and tested the ability of the transfected cells to interact with immobilized and soluble fibrinogen. We found that like PMA, the chemoattractant peptide formyl Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP), an fPR agonist, increased the avidity of αIIbβ3 for immobilized fibrinogen and its affinity for soluble fibrinogen. Moreover, using a number of metabolic inhibitors, we outlined an αIIbβ3 activation pathway involving the G-protein Gi, PKC, and the actin cytoskeleton.DISCUSSIONTo delineate signaling pathways that can convert αIIbβ3 from an inactive to a ligand binding conformation, we have expressed recombinant αIIbβ3 in human B lymphocytes. Initially, we found that the phorbol ester PMA not only induced the adherence of these cells to fibrinogen, but enabled αIIbβ3 to bind soluble fibrinogen (4Loh E. Qi W. Vilaire G. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30233-30241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the current work, we asked whether an extracellular agonist acting through its cognate membrane receptor could induce αIIbβ3 function in these cells. Stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors in platelets results in αIIbβ3 activation (7Brass L.F. Hoffman R. Benz Jr., E.J. Shattil S.J. Furie B. Cohen H.J. Silberstein L.E. Hematology: Basic principles and practive. Churchill Livingstone, New York1995: 1536-1551Google Scholar). Similarly, stimulation of these receptors leads to integrin activation in lymphocytes and other cells of the hematopoietic lineage (9Murphy P.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 593-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). We found that by coexpressing αIIbβ3 with the human formyl peptide receptor, a seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor (9Murphy P.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 593-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar), we could induce B cell adherence to immobilized fibrinogen and soluble fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 using the chemoattractant peptide fMLP. Moreover, we found that the signaling pathway initiated by fPR stimulation involved PKC and similar to signaling initiated by PMA, resulted in a change in the actin cytoskeleton.The human fPR is normally expressed in phagocytic cells where it transduces signals by activating the PTX-sensitive G proteins Gαi2 or Gαi3 (9Murphy P.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 593-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). We found that PTX inhibited the fMLP-stimulated interaction of co-transfected GM1500 cells with both immobilized and soluble fibrinogen, implying that Gαi activation can regulate αIIbβ3 function in these cells. Whether Gαi can also regulate αIIbβ3 function in platelets is uncertain. However, PTX inhibits thrombin-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in saponin-permeabilized human platelets, suggesting that at least the thrombin receptor in human platelets can couple to Gαi (29Brass L.F. Laposata M. Banga H.S. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16838-16847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, platelets from Gαq-deficient mice fail to aggregate in response to thrombin, ADP, collagen, arachidonic acid, and U46619, despite normal levels of Gαi, indicating that PTX-insensitive G protein Gαq couples agonist receptors to αIIbβ3 in murine platelets (30Offermanns S. Toombs C.F. Hu Y-H. Simon M.I. Nature. 1997; 389: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, it is possible that the difference between human lymphocytes and murine platelets may simply reflect a difference in the types of signaling pathways that are present in human and murine cells, similar to a difference in the types of thrombin receptors expressed by human and murine platelets (31Connolly A.J. Ishihara H. Kahn M.L. Farese Jr., R.V. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1996; 381: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 32Ishihara H. Connolly A.J. Zeng D. Kahn M.L. Zheng Y.W. Timmons C. Tram T. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1997; 386: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar).The ability of inhibitors of PKC (33Walker T.R. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) to inhibit platelet aggregation and/or ligand binding to αIIbβ3 implies that protein phosphorylation by PKC regulates αIIbβ3 activity. Moreover, the PKC activator PMA is a potent stimulus for ligand binding to αIIbβ3 on both human platelets (6Shattil S.J. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 992-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Gαq-deficient murine platelets (30Offermanns S. Toombs C.F. Hu Y-H. Simon M.I. Nature. 1997; 389: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The identity of the proteins phosphorylated by PKC in platelets to regulate αIIbβ3 function is unknown. The β3 cytoplasmic tail has been found to contain phosphorylated threonine residues after platelet stimulation by thrombin, PMA, or the thromboxane analogue U46619 (34Hillery C.A. Smyth S.S. Parise L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14663-14669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the fraction of β3 containing phosphorylated threonine in both resting and stimulated platelets was low and unlikely to affect the function of more than a few αIIbβ3 heterodimers. We found that the fMLP-stimulated interaction of αIIbβ3 with either immobilized or soluble fibrinogen in B cells was prevented by the specific PKC inhibitor BIM I. Thus, activation of PKC, either directly with PMA or via fPR activation of Gαi, is sufficient to induce αIIbβ3 function in lymphocytes. On the other hand, Laudanna et al. (16Laudanna C. Campbell J.J. Butcher E.C. Science. 1996; 271: 981-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) observed that inhibiting PKC had no effect on fMLP-stimulated α4β1 function in murine B cells (16Laudanna C. Campbell J.J. Butcher E.C. Science. 1996; 271: 981-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Again, it is possible that this difference simply reflects differences between human and murine cells. It is also possible that at least two signaling pathways can be initiated by fPR stimulation and that these pathways can differentiate between β1 and β3 integrins. In support of this possibility, Weberet al. (35Weber C. Kitayama J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10939-10944Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) found that signaling pathways arising from the receptors for the chemoattractants RANTES, MCP-3, and C5a in eosinophils can differentially regulate the function of α4β1 and αLβ2. Whether PKC-independent pathways also exist in B cells that can regulate αIIbβ3 function remains to be determined.Phosphorylation of tyrosines 747 and 759 in the β3 cytoplasmic tail has also been detected after thrombin-stimulated platelet aggregation (36Law D.A. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Phillips D.R. J. Biochem. 1996; 271: 10811-10815Scopus (204) Google Scholar). However, this phosphorylation was not observed after thrombin stimulation in the absence of aggregation, suggesting that it is a consequence of ligand binding to αIIbβ3 (“outside-in” signaling), rather than being part of the process of αIIbβ3 activation. Blystone et al. (37Blystone S.D. Williams M.P. Slater S.E. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28757-28761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) also detected phosphorylation of β3 Tyr-747 after monocytes were exposed to Mn2+ or platelets were treated with either Mn2+or thrombin. When they expressed αvβ3 heterologously in K562 cells, they found Tyr-747 phosphorylation necessary, but not sufficient, to support either PMA and thrombin-stimulated cell adhesion, and like Tyr-747 phosphorylation in platelets (36Law D.A. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Phillips D.R. J. Biochem. 1996; 271: 10811-10815Scopus (204) Google Scholar), required ligand binding to αvβ3. We found that the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein had no effect on the ability of αIIbβ3 in B lymphocytes to interact with fibrinogen. Similarly, we found that piceatannol, an inhibitor reportedly specific for the tyrosine kinase Syk found in lymphocytes and platelets (38Gao J. Zoller K.E. Ginsberg M.H. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6414-6425Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), had no effect on either PMA- or fMLP-stimulated αIIbβ3 function in lymphocytes. Thus, our data, combined with the inability to detect significant amounts of phosphorylated serine or threonine on the β3 of stimulated platelets (34Hillery C.A. Smyth S.S. Parise L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14663-14669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggest that phosphorylation of αIIbβ3 is not required to regulate its interaction with ligands.The biochemical events that follow PKC activation in lymphocytes and platelets are uncertain. However, one consequence of PKC-mediated signaling is regulation of membrane-cytoskeletal interactions (39Jaken S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). For example, Kucik and co-workers (40Kucik D.F. Dustin M.L. Miller J.M. Brown E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2139-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) found that exposing human B lymphocytes to PMA increased the diffusion of αLβ2 in the plane of the lymphocyte membrane and augmented lymphocyte adherence to ICAM-1. Similar effects were observed following exposure of the lymphocytes to low concentrations of cytochalasin D. These data suggest that cytoskeletal constraints, released by either PKC activation or cytochalasin D, maintain αLβ2 in a low avidity state. Lub et al. (41Lub M. van Kooyk Y. van Vliet S.J. Figdor C.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) extended these observations by showing that maximum αLβ2-mediated lymphocyte adherence required both αLβ2 clustering and an increase in its affinity for ICAM-1. We found that micromolar concentrations of cytochalasin D inhibited the PMA-stimulated interaction of lymphocytes expressing αIIbβ3 with either immobilized or soluble fibrinogen. Conversely, we found that nanomolar concentrations of cytochalasin D actually induced fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 on unstimulated cells. Thus, our observations suggest that both PKC and the actin cytoskeleton play a role in regulating both the avidity and affinity of αIIbβ3 for ligands. How this might occur is uncertain. Platelet stimulation results in a conformational change in αIIbβ3 that increases its affinity for ligands (42Shattil S.J. Hoxie J.A. Cunningham M. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11107-11114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Sims P.J. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7345-7352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is also associated with the disassembly of polymerized actin, followed by actin reassembly and a change in platelet morphology (44Fox J.E. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is conceivable that low concentrations of cytochalasin D can initiate actin disassembly, resulting in increases in both integrin mobility and affinity. Fox et al. (44Fox J.E. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that a variable amount of the αIIbβ3 in detergent lysates of unstimulated platelets was recovered with fragments of the membrane skeleton and was redistributed to a detergent-insoluble fraction containing a network of cytoplasmic actin filaments after ligand binding. They also observed that high concentrations of cytochalasin E inhibited the binding of the activation-dependent mAb PAC1 to αIIbβ3 on ADP and thrombin-stimulated platelets (26Fox J.E.B. Shattil S.J. Kinlough-Rathbone R.L. Richardson M. Packham M.A. Sanan D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7004-7011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the membrane skeleton in platelets, or in our case in lymphocytes, interacts with the cytoplasmic tails of αIIbβ3 to constrain the integrin in a low affinity configuration. Relief of this constraint by agonists (or cytochalasins) could then be responsible for an augmented interaction of αIIbβ3 with immobilized fibrinogen and for its ability to bind soluble ligands.Platelet stimulation is also associated with the formation of clusters of ligand-occupied αIIbβ3 on the platelet surface (26Fox J.E.B. Shattil S.J. Kinlough-Rathbone R.L. Richardson M. Packham M.A. Sanan D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7004-7011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, ligand valency does not appear to be a factor in the ability of αIIbβ3 to recognize soluble ligands (45Abrams C. Deng Y.J. Steiner B. O'Toole T. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18781-18788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, αIIbβ3 is a univalent receptor (11Bennett J.S. Hoxie J.A. Leitman S.F. Vilaire G. Cines D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2417-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and electron microscopy of fibrinogen bound to αIIbβ3 suggests that a fibrinogen molecule can only bind to one αIIbβ3 heterodimer on the surface of a given platelet (46Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Vilaire G. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16637-16643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, it is unlikely that clustering of αIIbβ3 alone can account for its ability to bind soluble fibrinogen. Nevertheless, it is possible, and even likely, that agonist-induced clustering of αIIbβ3 contributes to the augmented adherence of stimulated lymphocytes and platelets to immobilized fibrinogen.Activity of members of the Ras family of small GTPases has major effects on cytoskeletal organization. For example, microinjection of activated forms of the small GTPases cdc42, Rac, and Rho into Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts results in the formation of filopodia, lamellopodia, and stress fibers, respectively (27Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3700) Google Scholar). Similar effects have been reported in macrophages (47Allen W.E. Jones G.E. Pollard J.W. Ridley A.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 707-720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the small GTPase RhoA appears to play an important role in regulating integrin function in leukocytes, and perhaps in platelets as well. For example, inhibiting RhoA with C3 exoenzyme prevented PMA-stimulated αLβ2-mediated homotypic lymphocyte aggregation (14Tominaga T. Sugie K. Hirata M. Morii N. Fukata J. Uchida A. Imura H. Narumiya S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1529-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and the fMLP-stimulated α4β1-mediated adherence of murine lymphocytes to VCAM-1 (16Laudanna C. Campbell J.J. Butcher E.C. Science. 1996; 271: 981-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Morii and co-workers (28Morii N. Teru-uchi T. Tominaga T. Kumagai N. Kozaki S. Ushikubi F. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20921-20926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that C3 exoenzyme completely inhibits thrombin and PMA-stimulated human platelet aggregation, although they found little correlation between the extent of RhoA inhibition by the C3 exoenzyme and the extent to which platelet function was impaired. On the other hand, in preliminary studies, Leng et al. (48Leng L. Kashiwagi H. Shattil S.J. Blood. 1997; 90 (abstr.): 430aGoogle Scholar) did not observe the reported effect of C3 exoenzyme on platelet aggregation. We found that C3 exoenzyme had no effect on either PMA and fMLP-stimulated lymphocyte adherence to fibrinogen, despite substantial ADP-ribosylation of RhoA. Thus, RhoA is unlikely to transduce the signals that regulate αIIbβ3 function, at least in our system. A more likely candidate is Rac1. Microinjection of activated Rac1 into Swiss 3T3 cells induces the submembranous accumulation of actin and the formation of integrin-containing focal complexes at the cell margin (49Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenstrom P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Furthermore, activation of Rac1 by the exchange factor Tiam1 in T-lymphoma cells induces the formation of submembranous actin filaments, membrane ruffling, and an invasive phenotype (50Michiels F. Habets G.G.M. Stam J.C. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that a Rac-mediated reorganization of the membrane skeleton in lymphocytes, and by extrapolation in platelets, could be an intermediary step in the regulation of αIIbβ3 function by agonists.In summary, we have shown that the ability of integrin αIIbβ3, expressed in B lymphocytes, to interact with immobilized and soluble fibrinogen can be stimulated by the G protein-coupled formyl peptide receptor. Moreover, our studies begin to define a signaling pathway that includes a PTX-inhibitable G-protein, PKC, and the actin cytoskeleton. Exposure of a binding site for ligands such as fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor on the platelet integrin αIIbβ3 is a prerequisite for platelet aggregation (1Bennett J.S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1996; 16: 31-36Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The process by which this binding site is exposed has been termed “inside-out” signaling and is initiated when agonist-generated intraplatelet signals induce a conformational change in αIIbβ3 by interacting with its cytoplasmic tails (2O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). To study the process of αIIbβ3 activation in vitro , we have developed a model system in which wild-type and mutant αIIbβ3 expressed in GM1500 cells, an Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human B lymphocyte line, can be induced to interact with soluble and immobilized fibrinogen by the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) 1The abbreviations used are: PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PKC, protein kinase C; fPR, formyl peptide receptor; fMLP, formyl Met-Leu-Phe; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PTX, pertussis toxin; RGDS, Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser; BIM I, bisindolylmaleimide I; BIM V, bisindolylmaleimide V; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. 1The abbreviations used are: PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PKC, protein kinase C; fPR, formyl peptide receptor; fMLP, formyl Met-Leu-Phe; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PTX, pertussis toxin; RGDS, Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser; BIM I, bisindolylmaleimide I; BIM V, bisindolylmaleimide V; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate.

Using this system, we observed that the cytoplasmic tail of αIIb is not required for αIIbβ3 function in lymphocytes, that the conserved GFFKR motif in the αIIb tail is required for αIIb to interact with β3, and that signals interacting with the β3 cytoplasmic tail are responsible for the ability of agonists to stimulate αIIbβ3 function (4Loh E.

Phorbol esters such as PMA activate the conventional and novel isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC) (5Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar). While phorbol esters are a potent stimulus for ligand binding to αIIbβ3 in platelets (6Shattil S.J. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 992-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), they bypass the more proximal signaling events that are initiated when agonists bind to their cognate platelet membrane receptors. Most of the known platelet receptors for agonists are seven-transmembrane domain proteins that are coupled to various G proteins (7Brass L.F. Hoffman R. Benz Jr., E.J. Shattil S.J. Furie B. Cohen H.J. Silberstein L.E. Hematology: Basic principles and practive. Churchill Livingstone, New York1995: 1536-1551Google Scholar). Stimulation of these receptors on platelets is known to activate phospholipase Cβ, generate diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate, increase cytosolic calcium, and activate several isoforms of PKC (7Brass L.F. Hoffman R. Benz Jr., E.J. Shattil S.J. Furie B. Cohen H.J. Silberstein L.E. Hematology: Basic principles and practive. Churchill Livingstone, New York1995: 1536-1551Google Scholar). We were interested in determining whether stimulation of a G protein-coupled receptor on B lymphocytes would also expose the ligand-binding domain of αIIbβ3. Honda et al. (8Honda S. Campbell J.J. Andrew D.P. Engelhardt B. Butcher B.A. Warnock R.A. Ye R.D. Butcher E.C. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4026-4035PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that stimulation of the humanN -formyl peptide chemoattractant receptor (fPR) in murine B lymphocytes induces the α4β1-mediated adherence of these cells to VCAM-1. The fPR is a seven-transmembrane domain protein coupled to the G protein Gαi in leukocytes (9Murphy P.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 593-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we coexpressed the human fPR and αIIbβ3 in GM1500 cells and tested the ability of the transfected cells to interact with immobilized and soluble fibrinogen. We found that like PMA, the chemoattractant peptide formyl Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP), an fPR agonist, increased the avidity of αIIbβ3 for immobilized fibrinogen and its affinity for soluble fibrinogen. Moreover, using a number of metabolic inhibitors, we outlined an αIIbβ3 activation pathway involving the G-protein Gi, PKC, and the actin cytoskeleton. DISCUSSIONTo delineate signaling pathways that can convert αIIbβ3 from an inactive to a ligand binding conformation, we have expressed recombinant αIIbβ3 in human B lymphocytes. Initially, we found that the phorbol ester PMA not only induced the adherence of these cells to fibrinogen, but enabled αIIbβ3 to bind soluble fibrinogen (4Loh E. Qi W. Vilaire G. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30233-30241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the current work, we asked whether an extracellular agonist acting through its cognate membrane receptor could induce αIIbβ3"

In bacteremia and sepsis syndrome and their consequent complications (including acute respiratory distress syndrome and systemic ischemia-reperfusion resulting from septic shock), neutrophil degranulation is an important mechanism of injury. In related studies, we found that human endothelial cells regulate neutrophil degranulation and that inflammatory cytokines induce synthesis of degranulating factors by human endothelial cells. Here we show that lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from gram-negative bacteria were the most potent agonists for release of degranulating activity by endothelial cells when compared to several cytokines and stimulatory factors. LPS also induced the release of degranulating signals for PMNs from a human endothelial cell line, EA.hy 926. Interleukin 8 (IL-8) is synthesized by endothelial and EA.hy 926 cells in response to LPS and induces neutrophil degranulation. However, complementary strategies using receptor desensitization, translation of messenger RNA by Xenopus laevis oocytes, and purification and analysis of factors from conditioned supernatants demonstrated that degranulating factors distinct from IL8 are generated in response to LPS. The characteristics of a partially purified degranulating factor isolated from conditioned supernatants distinguished it from known chemokines and other factors that induce PMN degranulation and are generated by endothelial cells in response to LPS. Thus, cultured human endothelial cells and endothelial cell lines synthesize several unique signaling molecules that can trigger neutrophil granular secretion. If produced in vivo in response to LPS or other pathologic agonists, these degranulating signals may activate PMNs in combination or in sequence, initiating or propagating vascular damage."

https://openalex.org/W1503647667,"Before discussing the future role of chairs in discipline-based departments, it seems appropriate to address the concerns and problems facing such departments, since these considerations will predicate the functions of their chairs. Widespread concerns are now evident in the departments of many American universities, especially those termed “research universities”; nowhere are these concerns more tartly discussed than in medical schools, particularly in clinical departments buffeted by the financial strains of health care reform and the “discipline-based” basic science departments such as anatomy, biochemistry, physiology, microbiology, and pharmacology. It is the concerns of the latter departments—discipline-based basic sciences—that I address here. Figure 1 illustrates the central issues, and I will discuss each in turn, moving clockwise around the wheel. Most medical colleges in the nation are in the midst of curriculum reform or have already completed such a reform. The majority of these revisions entails a centralization of curriculum authority and cross-departmental integration of subject matter. In short, there is a loss of departmental control of the basic science courses and a greater focus on clinical relevance, often disguised as “problem-based learning”. In my view, it would be unwise of the discipline-based departments to hinder or oppose this trend; its momentum is too great and, frankly, such integration is long overdue. It eliminates significant redundancy between courses and fills important gaps that have been omitted in the past. Departments must attend to the central issue, which is not control of the courses but rather what subject matter is included in them. Content should be the focus of the basic science faculty, not the format of the courses or their link to clinical material. I recognize that many Ph.D.-trained faculty feel uneasy with the clinical subject matter, but I suggest that these same faculty members should welcome the opportunity to broaden their own educational background; it might even have a salutary effect on grant funding in the coming years. This said, I recommend that discipline-based departments concentrate on the subject matter of the integrated courses, insist that high standards of excellence be maintained in such courses, but not fight a rearguard action in which the departments appear reactionary or ultraconservative. Many of the most successful graduate schools in the nation have been shifting to integrated programs that span or cross departmental boundaries, which has resulted in open admissions and integrated curricula. Many of the best applicants to graduate programs in the biomedical and biological sciences are attracted by an open admissions policy in which students are not locked into single graduate programs in their first year of study. Independent students want the chance to begin their graduate careers in a less restricted manner, i.e., by deferring final program selection until late in their first year or early in the second year of study. This permits the trainees greater latitude in selecting research areas and Ph.D. mentors. As a consequence of these shifts, there has been the loss or decline of departmental control of graduate training, often with a change in program titles. For example, graduate training in anatomy may disappear and be replaced by training in cell biology, developmental biology, or neuroscience; molecular biology programs may be created without a formal medical school department possessing this title. So the names and focus of graduate programs may not be synchronous with the medical college departments. The wheel of worry: major concerns of chairs attending to the basic science departments of medical schools in the United States. Is this bad? I'm not sure. But the trend is clear and the pace is increasing. For graduate schools to compete for the best students, they must present attractive graduate opportunities that are flexible, integrated, and exciting. ‘Public relations’ is a fact that cannot be ignored. The essence of a fine graduate program is the quality of both students and faculty. A school with a strong faculty that is incapable of attracting good students because of rigid departmental boundaries is not going to have a successful graduate program or a happy faculty. Medical school departments cannot afford to dig in and fight to rigidly control the graduate programs. Change must take place to attract the best students; generally, this involves integration and flexible training programs. This is the way we all do our research; why not do the same in our graduate programs? For many years research-intensive private medical schools in the U.S. have expected faculty to recover a fraction of their full-time salaries in proportion to the time they devote to research. This usually came from National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant support. As competition for NIH support has intensified over the past decade, particularly in areas distal from molecular genetics, traditional discipline-based departments have been severely pressured, weakening staff morale and diminishing their attractiveness to graduate students. With the demise of discipline-based Study Sections, e.g., physiology, this unease has deepened. Although the situation had been particularly intense at private schools, that is no longer the case; increasingly, faculty at state university medical schools have been expected to regain higher percentages of their salaries from grants. Salary recoveries in excess of 50% are not uncommon, and I do not believe that the situation is going to change unless one or more of the following developments occurs: 1) an increase in federal grant support; 2) an increase in medical college endowment monies allocated for salary support; 3) more foundation support (e.g., Howard Hughes Medical Institute); 4) increased industrial support; and 5) increased allocation of clinical dollars for basic science research. Space precludes a full discussion of this topic, but optimistic prospects for increased NIH support over the next 5 years are quite encouraging and should alleviate much of the stress now felt by faculty in discipline-based departments. It is unrealistic to anticipate a significant increase in endowment allocations for the basic science department, but chairs should work toward modest increments. Foundation support might increase, but not tremendously, and I am skeptical about major increases in industrial support. Finally, it is very unlikely that clinical revenues will increase in the future; the reverse is more than likely. Unless federal grant support for the basic sciences increases in the future, the stability and permanence of such departments will be uncertain. Deans of medical colleges are generally recruited with the expectation that they will strengthen research, modernize education, improve patient care, increase health care reimbursements, and enlarge private fundraising. However desirable, these expectations may be unrealistic, thus explaining the short tenure of most deans. Clearly, none of us want to blunt the high hopes or aspirations of our institutions, but the severity and complexity of these issues may preclude their timely solution. This has often led to an enormous expansion of dean's offices while faculties see shrinking academic departments, which increase teaching responsibilities without commensurate remuneration. This has led to dangerous skepticism between faculty and administrators that may have severe consequences. The increasing size and complexity of modern medical centers is a double-edged sword. Critical mass is essential for both research and tertiary health care delivery, but the current appetite for money is frightening. Most basic science faculty feel distanced from central administrators and suspect (quite rightly) that most of their attention is focused on clinical issues, primarily health care reimbursement. Open and meaningful discussions between faculty and deans concerning research and education are infrequent and usually unsatisfactory. Faculty feel they are being asked to do more teaching, often in areas in which they are poorly trained, while being asked to increase their extramural salary support. This necessitates an increasing flow of grant submissions and less time for thoughtful research. Space utilization is coming under increasing scrutiny, often with each square foot of research space being assigned a dollar value. Universities clearly have to optimize space utilization: it is a valuable resource. But despite many assurances to the contrary, most faculty believe that indirect cost recoveries are not being used to benefit their research but are disappearing in an ever-expanding dean's office. Is there a solution? Again, I am not sure. Clear and honest communication between the dean's office and faculty is essential. The aspirations of both parties must be acknowledged and addressed, but that becomes increasingly difficult as medical schools enlarge and diversify. Faculties are so dispersed and out of direct contact with one another that institutional bonds are fraying severely. Thus, the isolation felt by basic scientists is common in the modern medical center, possibly the natural consequence of increased size and diversity. I have no simple solutions: most deans and faculty muddle through, with nostalgic memories of the ‘good old days'. I see no rainbows with pots of gold on the horizon. In a U.S. medical school, monies typically are invested in a department when a new chairperson is recruited. The sums invested at that time can be quite extensive—often many millions of dollars. Although this clearly has enormous impact on the department and school for the next 5–10 years, it is just as often the case that sustained support of that department dries up rapidly. Thus, research-oriented faculty are recruited in significant numbers for the first 5 years of a new chair's tenure, but as they reach mid-career with successful research programs, the institution's attention has shifted to other problem areas and the faculty and chair are left to fend for themselves. Although this may be understandable, it is short-sighted and self-defeating because many of the best members faculty members become unhappy, search for other positions, and foster a mood of discontent. Institutions must sustain, as well as seed, departments. The tradition of feast and famine is stupid; it inevitably leads to the sinusoidal waxing and waning of departments that seem to be the predictable fate of our basic sciences. While this might also be true of the clinical departments, in reality they depend very little on the dean's office for most of their support; clinical revenues and private support are a valuable buffer for those departments, usually unavailable to the basic sciences. It would be wise for deans' offices to plan for the annual banking of $100,000 to $200,000 per year by the basic science departments, which could be used for periodic reinfusions of their programs. Instead, chairs must go ‘hat in hand’ to their deans for such infusions, often unsuccessfully. The shortsighted planning by most institutions is surprising indeed. Faculty recruitment typically requires substantial start-up packages, generally in the range of $500,000–750,000 for junior appointments. While this often includes a significant fraction of the appointee's salary, the sums are nevertheless very large and usually beyond the reach of most chairs. And then we continue the aforementioned hat-in-hand visit to the dean's office. The best young candidates are being recruited by many institutions, and despite the large number of available postdoctoral fellows the same names appear surprisingly often at the top of most search committee lists. Although competition is clearly a positive feature of the U.S. system, the sums now on the table are often backbreaking. The only answer is wise planning, prudent investment policy, and tough promotion procedures. In addition to the previous discussion, the issue of salary recovery is a severe one and not likely to go away. Also, different policies in different departments can become a problem within an institution. Uniform policies on this score are advisable because they would minimize the suspicion of favoritism or inequality that often pervades medical colleges. I suspect that salary recoveries in the range of 50% will be a reasonable target in most basic science departments, providing that NIH monies remain available. This is too large an issue to discuss in this brief article. Suffice it to say that the insecurity of clinician-scientists may be even more pervasive than that in the basic sciences. The pressures to see an ever-increasing number of patients, to carry an even greater teaching burden for pre- and postdoctoral students, and the intense competition for federal research funds have dampened the enthusiasm of most medical college graduates for entering academic careers in the clinical-scientist track. I have no crystal ball here and will duck the problem. With the intense financial pressures on most dean's offices, there has been a deferral of infrastructure repairs at many medical centers. Physical plants have been deteriorating as monies are used for short-term needs. This is having a disastrous effect on many institutions and must be redressed. The same is true of core facilities needed to sustain modern research. Until these core facilities are built and monies allocated for their subsidy, modern research programs will not be competitive. This is especially true of animal centers, which are essential for biomedical research and cannot be expected to cover their expenses from user fees. The cost of mouse colonies, for example, must be subsidized, but those monies have to come from sources also needed for start-up funds, bridge funds, library support, etc. Again, planning is essential but rarely occurs in an open and forthright manner. Faculty are often not included in long-range decisions that have a major impact on their research and educational programs. The obvious result is discontent and unease among the faculty. It can and should be avoided. Medical colleges are continually faced with the pressure to create new departments, both basic and clinical. The plethora of clinical departments in most medical schools, often numbering about 18–20, is obvious and disconcerting. Meetings of most chairpersons evolve into discussions of clinical reimbursements and the tensions between hospital and medical college administrators. Rarely are educational or research issues addressed. While the multiplication of clinical departments is occurring, most medical colleges have kept very tight reign on the growth in the number of basic science departments, usually retaining anatomy/cell biology, biochemistry, microbiology, physiology/biophysics, pharmacology, pathology (sometimes grouped with the clinical departments), and public health. Most schools would acknowledge the need to create departments of genetics and neurobiology as well, but usually this is limited by available endowment monies. As such, there continues the refrain about merging or renaming basic science departments to increase their attractiveness and competitiveness. At the same time, deans continue to test the waters about eliminating basic science departments altogether while creating a basic biomedical institute or center, with divisions akin to a department of medicine. I have no enthusiasm for such a model. The size of the total unit would be in the range of 100 faculty members, and the essence of collegial units that most faculty find in departments would disappear. Once departments grow to more than 20, there is usually a falloff in faculty interaction and connectedness. Despite the professed reductions in administrative costs, I am not persuaded that this model would be successful or welcomed by many basic science faculty. Chairs of the discipline-based departments are as bewildered as their faculty in this chaotic period of changing health care delivery, educational reform, and uncertain funding. Although most would prefer to emulate the Asian metaphor of bamboo—bending but not breaking in a strong wind—most feel like brittle twigs, fragile in the current winds of change. A central question is how much proactivity is called for or is advisable by chairs and their faculty at this time. Clearly, passivity is unappealing and defeatist. But how can we identify what is important to preserve within current departmental structure and what can be eliminated or repackaged? It is over this issue that most of us part ways. Very few basic scientists would advocate eliminating their departments, but I suggest there would be very little agreement about how much graduate program organization should be departmentally based, how much medical and graduate teaching should be controlled by medical school departments, and which departmental names should be preserved or eliminated. I close by suggesting that until we as basic scientists reach some consensus on these questions, the situation will drift or be decided by administrators with agendas that differ from our own."
https://openalex.org/W1789620130,"Mutations in the genes whose products participate in DNA mismatch repair underlie the increased risk of cancer in families with hereditary nonpolyposis colon carcinoma. Mutations in hMSH2 account for approximately 50% of the mutations found in these families. We sought to predict the 3-dimensional structure of hMSH2 by identifying structural homologues using prediction-based threading and by computer modeling using information from these putative structurally related proteins. Prediction-based threading identified three candidate structural homologues: glycogen phosphorylase (gpb), a 70 kDa soluble lytic transglycosylase, and ribonucleotide reductase protein R1. An independent approach utilizing a potential-based threading program also identified gpb as a structural homologue. The models based on the structures of these proteins suggest that the ATP binding domain and helix-turn-helix domain are exposed on the outside of the protein. All known bacterial MutS and hMSH2 mutations appear to be clustered in similar vicinities in the theoretical models of hMSH2; the major site is within the ATP binding domain and near the carboxyl-terminal end, whereas a smaller number map to the region coding for exon 5 and the amino-terminal domain. All point mutations also appear to affect amino acids that are exposed on the outside surface of the protein."
