Here we describe the discovery of DDD107498, a compound with a potent and novel spectrum of antimalarial activity against multiple life-cycle stages of the Plasmodium parasite, with good pharmacokinetic properties and an acceptable safety profile. DDD107498 demonstrates potential to address a variety of clinical needs, including single-dose treatment, transmission blocking and chemoprotection. DDD107498 was developed from a screening programme against blood-stage malaria parasites; its molecular target has been identified as translation elongation factor 2 (eEF2), which is responsible for the GTP-dependent translocation of the ribosome along messenger RNA, and is essential for protein synthesis. This discovery of eEF2 as a viable antimalarial drug target opens up new possibilities for drug discovery."

https://openalex.org/W820890112,"Touch screens are increasingly prevalent, and anecdotal evidence suggests that young children are very drawn towards them. Yet there is little data regarding how young children use them. A brief online questionnaire queried over 450 French parents of infants between the ages of 5 and 40 months on their young child's use of touch-screen technology. Parents estimated frequency of use, and further completed several checklists. Results suggest that, among respondent families, the use of touch screens is widespread in early childhood, meaning that most children have some exposure to touch screens. Among child users, certain activities are more frequently reported to be liked than others, findings that we discuss in light of current concern for children's employment of time and the cognitive effects of passive media exposure. Additionally, these parental reports point to clear developmental trends for certain types of interactive gestures. These results contribute to the investigation of touch screen use on early development and suggest a number of considerations that should help improve the design of applications geared towards toddlers, particularly for scientific purposes."

https://openalex.org/W1590170345,"Extrasolar planets that pass in front of their host star (transit) cause a temporary decrease in the apparent brightness of the star, providing a direct measure of the planet's size and orbital period. In some systems with multiple transiting planets, the times of the transits are measurably affected by the gravitational interactions between neighbouring planets. In favourable cases, the departures from Keplerian orbits (that is, unaffected by gravitational effects) implied by the observed transit times permit the planetary masses to be measured, which is key to determining their bulk densities. Characterizing rocky planets is particularly difficult, because they are generally smaller and less massive than gaseous planets. Therefore, few exoplanets near the size of Earth have had their masses measured. Here we report the sizes and masses of three planets orbiting Kepler-138, a star much fainter and cooler than the Sun. We determine that the mass of the Mars-sized inner planet, Kepler-138 b, is 0.066(+0.059)(-0.037) Earth masses. Its density is 2.6(+2.4)(-1.5) grams per cubic centimetre. The middle and outer planets are both slightly larger than Earth. The middle planet's density (6.2(+5.8)(-3.4) grams per cubic centimetre) is similar to that of Earth, and the outer planet is less than half as dense at 2.1(+2.2)(-1.2) grams per cubic centimetre, implying that it contains a greater portion of low-density components such as water and hydrogen."

In experimental arthritis, concomitant periodontitis caused by oral infection with Porphyromonas gingivalis enhances articular bone loss. The aim of this study was to investigate how lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from P. gingivalis stimulates bone resorption. The effects by LPS P. gingivalis and four other TLR2 ligands on bone resorption, osteoclast formation, and gene expression in wild type and Tlr2-deficient mice were assessed in ex vivo cultures of mouse parietal bones and in an in vivo model in which TLR2 agonists were injected subcutaneously over the skull bones. LPS P. gingivalis stimulated mineral release and matrix degradation in the parietal bone organ cultures by increasing differentiation and formation of mature osteoclasts, a response dependent on increased RANKL (receptor activator of NF-κB ligand). LPS P. gingivalis stimulated RANKL in parietal osteoblasts dependent on the presence of TLR2 and through a MyD88 and NF-κB-mediated mechanism. Similarly, the TLR2 agonists HKLM, FSL1, Pam2, and Pam3 stimulated RANKL in osteoblasts and parietal bone resorption. LPS P. gingivalis and Pam2 robustly enhanced osteoclast formation in periosteal/endosteal cell cultures by increasing RANKL. LPS P. gingivalis and Pam2 also up-regulated RANKL and osteoclastic genes in vivo, resulting in an increased number of periosteal osteoclasts and immense bone loss in wild type mice but not in Tlr2-deficient mice. These data demonstrate that LPS P. gingivalis stimulates periosteal osteoclast formation and bone resorption by stimulating RANKL in osteoblasts via TLR2. This effect might be important for periodontal bone loss and for the enhanced bone loss seen in rheumatoid arthritis patients with concomitant periodontal disease.

https://openalex.org/W1607451404,"Vascular response is an essential pathological mechanism underlying various inflammatory diseases. This study determines whether IL-35, a novel responsive anti-inflammatory cytokine, inhibits vascular response in acute inflammation. Using a mouse model of LPS-induced acute inflammation and plasma samples from sepsis patients, we found that IL-35 was induced in the plasma of mice after LPS injection as well as in the plasma of sepsis patients. In addition, IL-35 decreased LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the plasma of mice. Furthermore, IL-35 inhibited leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium in the vessels of lung and cremaster muscle and decreased the numbers of inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Mechanistically, IL-35 inhibited the LPS-induced up-regulation of endothelial cell (EC) adhesion molecule VCAM-1 through IL-35 receptors gp130 and IL-12Rβ2 via inhibition of the MAPK-activator protein-1 (AP-1) signaling pathway. We also found that IL-27, which shares the EBI3 subunit with IL-35, promoted LPS-induced VCAM-1 in human aortic ECs and that EBI3-deficient mice had similar vascular response to LPS when compared with that of WT mice. These results demonstrated for the first time that inflammation-induced IL-35 inhibits LPS-induced EC activation by suppressing MAPK-AP1-mediated VCAM-1 expression and attenuates LPS-induced secretion of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Our results provide insight into the control of vascular inflammation by IL-35 and suggest that IL-35 is an attractive novel therapeutic reagent for sepsis and cardiovascular diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2225078923,"Apoptosis of osteocytes and osteoblasts precedes bone resorption and bone loss with reduced mechanical stimulation, and receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) expression is increased with unloading in mice. Because osteocytes are major RANKL producers, we hypothesized that apoptotic osteocytes signal to neighboring osteocytes to increase RANKL expression, which, in turn, increases osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. The traditional bisphosphonate (BP) alendronate (Aln) or IG9402, a BP analog that does not inhibit resorption, prevented the increase in osteocyte apoptosis and osteocytic RANKL expression. The BPs also inhibited osteoblast apoptosis but did not prevent the increase in osteoblastic RANKL. Unloaded mice exhibited high serum levels of the bone resorption marker C-telopeptide fragments of type I collagen (CTX), elevated osteoclastogenesis, and increased osteoclasts in bone. Aln, but not IG9402, prevented all of these effects. In addition, Aln prevented the reduction in spinal and femoral bone mineral density, spinal bone volume/tissue volume, trabecular thickness, mechanical strength, and material strength induced by unloading. Although IG9402 did not prevent the loss of bone mass, it partially prevented the loss of strength, suggesting a contribution of osteocyte viability to strength independent of bone mass. These results demonstrate that osteocyte apoptosis leads to increased osteocytic RANKL. However, blockade of these events is not sufficient to restrain osteoclast formation, inhibit resorption, or stop bone loss induced by skeletal unloading.

These results demonstrate that osteocyte apoptosis leads to increased osteocytic RANKL. However, blockade of these events is not sufficient to restrain osteoclast formation, inhibit resorption, or stop bone loss induced by skeletal unloading. Mechanical forces have a positive effect on the skeleton and, in contrast, conditions under which decreased strain is imposed on bone lead to loss of bone mass and an increased risk of fractures (1Turner C.H. Warden S.J. Bellido T. Plotkin L.I. Kumar N. Jasiuk I. Danzig J. Robling A.G. Mechanobiology of the skeleton.Sci. Signal. 2009; 2: pt3Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Such conditions include prolonged bed rest, physical inactivity, motor paralysis because of denervation, and reduced gravity. With the rise in the aging population, the predominance of a sedentary life style, and the prospective of commercialization of space flights, there is an increased need for understanding the mechanisms underlying the loss of bone with skeletal unloading and for new approaches to combat it. Osteocytes are recognized mechanosensory cells of bone that detect the need for bone augmentation or reduction in response to changes in mechanical stimulation (2Bonewald L.F. The amazing osteocyte.J. Bone Miner. Res. 2011; 26: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). Recent advances in osteocyte biology demonstrate that osteocytes produce molecules that regulate the generation and activity of both osteoblasts and osteoclasts (3Bellido T. Osteocyte-driven bone remodeling.Calcif. Tissue Int. 2014; 94: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The protein sclerostin encoded by the gene Sost is secreted by osteocytes and inhibits bone formation by osteoblasts, providing the first example of a molecular mediator produced by matrix-embedded osteocytes that regulate the activity of cells on the bone surface (4Baron R. Kneissel M. WNT signaling in bone homeostasis and disease: from human mutations to treatments.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). Sost/sclerostin expression is down-regulated by mechanical stimulation, an event that is required for the anabolic response of the skeleton to loading (5Tu X. Rhee Y. Condon K.W. Bivi N. Allen M.R.

Further, sclerostin expression is increased with unloading, potentially explaining the decreased bone formation that ensues with disuse osteoporosis (6Robling A.G. Niziolek P.J. Baldridge L.A.

Loss of osteocyte integrity in association with microdamage and bone remodeling after fatigue in vivo.J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Furthermore, apoptosis of osteocytes precedes temporally and spatially osteoclast-mediated resorption because apoptotic osteocytes are found in bone before any detectable increase in osteoclasts and accumulate in areas that will be subsequently resorbed (14Aguirre J.I. Plotkin L.I. Stewart S.A. Weinstein R.S. Parfitt A.M. Manolagas S.C. Bellido T. Osteocyte apoptosis is induced by weightlessness in mice and precedes osteoclast recruitment and bone loss.J.

Moreover, the targeted ablation of osteocytes by genetic means is sufficient to increase RANKL and to induce osteoclast recruitment and bone resorption (17Tatsumi S. Ishii K. Amizuka N. Li M.

However, whether the increase in osteocyte apoptosis and RANKL expression induced by unloading are mechanistically linked remains unknown. In addition, whether preserving osteocyte viability alters RANKL expression, osteoclast generation, and/or bone resorption in unloaded bones has not been explored before. In this study, we addressed these questions using two bisphosphonate (BP) analogs that, as we showed previously, effectively block osteocyte and osteoblast apoptosis in vitro and apoptosis induced by glucocorticoid excess in vivo (18Plotkin L.I.

Traditional BPs such as alendronate also inhibit the mevalonate pathway and intoxicate osteoclasts, thereby inhibiting resorption (23Rogers M.J. Crockett J.C. Coxon F.P. Mönkkönen J. Biochemical and molecular mechanisms of action of bisphosphonates.Bone. 2011; 49: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In contrast, the unique BP analog IG9402 only acts on osteocytes and osteoblasts and does not inhibit the mevalonate pathway or bone resorption (19Plotkin L.I. Manolagas S.C. Bellido T. Dissociation of the pro-apoptotic effects of bisphosphonates on osteoclasts from their anti-apoptotic effects on osteoblasts/osteocytes with novel analogs.Bone. 2006; 39: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 21Plotkin L.I.

Quantitative structure-activity relationships for γδ T cell activation by bisphosphonates.J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Furthermore, daily injections with alendronate decreases bone formation as a consequence of its antiresorptive activity (21Plotkin L.I. Bivi N. Bellido T. A bisphosphonate that does not affect osteoclasts prevents osteoblast and osteocyte apoptosis and the loss of bone strength induced by glucocorticoids in mice.Bone. 2011; 49: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This was evidenced by reduced plasma levels of CTX and osteocalcin and mineralizing surface/bone surface (MS/BS), mineral apposition rate (MAR), and bone formation rate/bone surface (BFR/BS) and osteoblast number in cancellous bone. On the other hand, IG9402 did not affect any of these parameters in vehicle-treated mice. Moreover, IG9402 prevented the decrease in bone formation and osteoblast number in glucocorticoid-treated mice. Using these two pharmacologic tools, we dissected the contribution of osteocyte and osteoblast apoptosis to the changes in RANKL and OPG expression and to the increased resorption triggered by skeletal unloading. We found that both BPs inhibited osteocyte and osteoblast apoptosis and decreased RANKL expression in osteocytes. In contrast, even when osteoblast apoptosis induced by unloading was inhibited by the bisphosphonates, the increased RANKL expression in osteoblasts was not reversed by the drugs. Alendronate also prevented the elevation in osteoclasts, bone resorption, and bone loss induced by unloading. In contrast, IG9402 did not prevent the increase in osteoclasts or bone resorption or the decrease in bone mass. These findings show that osteocyte apoptosis does indeed control osteocytic RANKL expression and that maintaining osteocyte viability is not sufficient to restrain resorption or prevent the loss of bone induced by unloading. Therefore, RANKL derived from non-osteocytic sources (likely osteoblasts) mediates osteoclastogenesis and the bone loss resulting from lack of mechanical forces. Female 4-month-old C57BL/6 mice (Harlan) were used. Mice were kept in cages under standard laboratory conditions with a 12-h dark, 12-h light cycle, a constant temperature of 20 °C, and a humidity of 48% for 2 weeks for acclimation. Mice were fed a standard rodent diet (Purina FormulaLab Diet 5008) with water ad libitum. Skeletal unloading was achieved using the tail suspension model described previously (14Aguirre J.I. Plotkin L.I. Stewart S.A. Weinstein R.S. Parfitt A.M. Manolagas S.C. Bellido T. Osteocyte apoptosis is induced by weightlessness in mice and precedes osteoclast recruitment and bone loss.J. Bone Miner. Res. 2006; 21: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The height was adjusted to maintain the mice in an ∼30° head-down tilt. Two tail-suspended animals were housed per cage. Fully ambulatory control mice were caged in groups of five and pair-fed with the tail-suspended mice. All protocols were approved by the Indiana University School of Medicine. CTX were measured using an enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (RatLaps, Immunodiagnostic Systems Inc., Fountain Hills, AZ), as published previously (21Plotkin L.I. Bivi N. Bellido T.

Bone marrow cells collected from tibiae and femora of six mice of each group were combined and seeded in triplicates at a density of 50 × 103 cells/cm2. Cells were cultured in the presence of 30 ng/ml macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and 30 ng/ml soluble RANKL for 4 days.

Res. 2012; 27: 374-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Consecutive 5-μm-thick sections were used for osteocyte apoptosis and for analysis of protein expression by immunohistochemistry. For apoptosis, a modified version of a commercial TUNEL kit (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) was used, and sections were counterstained with 2% methyl green, as described previously (20Plotkin L.I.

Immunohistochemistry was performed in consecutive sections using goat anti-RANKL and anti-OPG antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) with prior antigen retrieval (DeCal Retrieval Solution, BioGenex, San Ramon, CA) and followed by signal amplification (ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Non-immune IgG was used as a negative control. Cells were score as either positive (brown staining) or negative (blue/green staining) for each antigen. To visualize osteoclasts on the cancellous bone surface, sections were stained for TRAP and counterstained with toluidine blue, as described previously (25Bivi N. Condon K.W. Allen M.R. Farlow N.

For gene analysis and trypan blue uptake, cells were treated with vehicle or 10−7 m alendronate or IG9402 for 1 h, followed by addition of vehicle, dexamethasone (10−6 m), etoposide (20 μM), or H2O2 (100 μM) in growing medium or with medium without serum for the indicated time points. Cells were then trypsinized to determine the percentage of dead cells by trypan blue uptake or lysed to isolate mRNA, as published previously (26Bivi N. Lezcano V. Romanello M. Bellido T.

For the experiments using conditioned medium, cells were treated with vehicle or bisphosphonate for 1 h, followed by addition of H2O2 or by changing the medium to remove the serum. 6, 24, and 48 h later, culture supernatants were collected and added to cells plated the day before (together with growing medium, 1:1). 6 and 24 h later, cells were lysed to collect mRNA. RNA was isolated from MLO-Y4 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), as described previously (27Bivi N. Pacheco-Costa R. Brun L.R. Murphy T.R. Farlow N.R. Robling A.G. Bellido T. Plotkin L.I.

Quantitative PCR was performed using the housekeeping gene ribosomal protein S2 (ChoB) and the ΔCt method. Primers and probes were designed using the Assay Design Center (Roche Applied Science) or were available commercially (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). BMD of the total body (excluding the head), spine (L1-L6), and femur was determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry using a PIXImus II densitometer (GE Medical Systems, Lunar Division, Madison, WI), as described previously (28O'Brien C.A.

Control of bone mass and remodeling by PTH receptor signaling in osteocytes.PLoS ONE. 2008; 3e2942 Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). For microCT analysis, L5 vertebrae were dissected, cleaned of soft tissue, fixed, and stored in 70% ethanol until analyzed at 6-μm resolution using a Skyscan 1172 microCT (SkyScan, Kontich, Belgium) (28O'Brien C.A.

Control of bone mass and remodeling by PTH receptor signaling in osteocytes.PLoS ONE. 2008; 3e2942 Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Analyses were conducted on cancellous bone to measure bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb.N), spacing (Tb.Sp), and thickness (Tb.Th); on cortical bone to measure the thickness of the posterior shell (cortical thickness); and on cortical and cancellous combined normalized to total area (total BV/TV). Compression strength was measured in lumbar vertebrae (L6) using a single-column material testing machine and a calibrated tension/compression load cell (model 5542, Instron Corp., Norwood, MA) (21Plotkin L.I. Bivi N. Bellido T. A bisphosphonate that does not affect osteoclasts prevents osteoblast and osteocyte apoptosis and the loss of bone strength induced by glucocorticoids in mice.Bone. 2011; 49: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Bone dimensions were measured with a digital caliper at a resolution of 0.01 mm (Mitutoyo, catalog no. 500-196, Ace Tools, Wantagh, NY). Statistical analysis was performed using SigmaStat (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL). Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA, and, if a significant main effect or interaction was found, we examined it closely by performing pairwise multiple comparisons with Bonferroni correction (29Riffenburgh R.H. Statistics in Medicine.2nd Ed. Academic Press, Burlington, MA2006Google Scholar). All values are reported as the mean ± S.D. Our previous work has shown that tail suspension consistently decreases bone mass and strength and increases osteoblast and osteocyte apoptosis in lumbar vertebral bone of Swiss Webster and C57BL/6 mice (14Aguirre J.I. Plotkin L.I. Stewart S.A. Weinstein R.S. Parfitt A.M. Manolagas S.C. Bellido T. Osteocyte apoptosis is induced by weightlessness in mice and precedes osteoclast recruitment and bone loss.J. Bone Miner. Res. 2006; 21: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of BP administration on vertebral bone of unloaded mice. Tail suspension induced an increase in the prevalence of apoptotic osteocytes and osteoblasts in cancellous bone of the lumbar vertebra (Fig. 1). As found previously for glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis (21Plotkin L.I. Bivi N. Bellido T. A bisphosphonate that does not affect osteoclasts prevents osteoblast and osteocyte apoptosis and the loss of bone strength induced by glucocorticoids in mice.Bone. 2011; 49: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), daily injections of alendronate or IG9402 preserved both osteoblast and osteocyte viability. The prevalence of RANKL-positive osteocytes was increased significantly in vertebral bone from ∼7% in controls to 14% in mice subjected to tail suspension (Fig. 2A). This increase was completely prevented by daily administration of alendronate or IG9402. Tail suspension also increased the prevalence of RANKL-positive osteoblasts from ∼13% in controls to 23% in mice subjected to tail suspension, but neither alendronate nor IG9402 administration prevented this effect. The prevalence of OPG-positive osteocytes, which ranged from 19–25% in ambulatory control mice, was decreased by tail suspension (10–12%), independent of whether the animals received saline, alendronate, or IG9402 (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, the prevalence of OPG-positive osteoblasts was decreased in mice subjected to tail suspension and receiving vehicle or IG9402 (∼37 and 17% OPG-positive osteoblasts for control and tail-suspended mice, respectively), whereas alendronate administration reversed the decrease in OPG-expressing osteoblasts (∼25 and 38% OPG-positive osteoblasts for alendronate-treated control and tail-suspended mice, respectively). On the other hand, OPG expression in the bone marrow was not altered by any of the treatments. Taken together, this evidence suggests that signals from apoptotic osteocytes increase RANKL expression in osteocytes without modifying OPG expression and that the regulation of RANKL and OPG expression in osteoblasts is independent of changes in cell survival.FIGURE 2.Prevention of osteocyte apoptosis is associated with reduced prevalence of RANKL-positive osteocytes and no change in OPG-positive osteocytes in immobilized mice.

https://openalex.org/W1953225064,"Although cancer cell fusion has been suggested as a mechanism of cancer metastasis, the underlying mechanisms defining this process are poorly understood. In a recent study, apoptotic cells were newly identified as a type of cue that induces signaling via phosphatidylserine receptors to promote fusion of myoblasts. The microenvironment of breast tumors is often hypoxic, and because apoptosis is greatly increased in hypoxic conditions, we decided to investigate whether the mechanism of breast cancer cell fusion with mesenchymal stem/multipotent stromal cells (MSCs) involves apoptosis. We used a powerful tool for identification and tracking of hybrids based on bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and found that breast cancer cells fused spontaneously with MSCs. This fusion was significantly enhanced with hypoxia and signaling associated with apoptotic cells, especially between nonmetastatic breast cancer cells and MSCs. In addition, the hybrids showed a significantly higher migratory capacity than did the parent cells. Taken together, these findings describe a mechanism by which hypoxia-induced apoptosis stimulates fusion between MSCs and breast tumor cells resulting in hybrids with an enhanced migratory capacity that may enable their dissemination to distant sites or metastases. In the long run, this study may provide new strategies for developing novel drugs for preventing cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W1832095457,"Hepatosteatosis is associated with the development of both hepatic insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes. Hepatic expression of Cd36, a fatty acid transporter, is enhanced in obese and diabetic murine models and human nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and thus it correlates with hyperinsulinemia, steatosis, and insulin resistance. Here, we have explored the effect of hyperinsulinemia on hepatic Cd36 expression, development of hepatosteatosis, insulin resistance, and dysglycemia. A 3-week sucrose-enriched diet was sufficient to provoke hyperinsulinemia, hepatosteatosis, hepatic insulin resistance, and dysglycemia in CBA/J mice. The development of hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in CBA/J mice on a sucrose-enriched diet was paralleled by increased hepatic expression of the transcription factor Pparγ and its target gene Cd36 whereas that of genes implicated in lipogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and VLDL secretion was unaltered. Additionally, we demonstrate that insulin, in a Pparγ-dependent manner, is sufficient to directly increase Cd36 expression in perfused livers and isolated hepatocytes. Mouse strains that display low insulin levels, i.e. C57BL6/J, and/or lack hepatic Pparγ, i.e. C3H/HeN, do not develop hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, or dysglycemia on a sucrose-enriched diet, suggesting that elevated insulin levels, via enhanced CD36 expression, provoke fatty liver development that in turn leads to hepatic insulin resistance and dysglycemia.

NAFLD covers a spectrum of conditions associated with lipid accumulation in hepatocytes ranging from fatty liver, i.e. hepatosteatosis, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis (1Kim C.H.

Several independent factors, including (i) increased free fatty acid (FFA) uptake, (ii) de novo lipogenesis, (iii) decreased FA oxidation, and (iv) reduced VLDL secretion, may contribute to hepatic fat accumulation (2Postic C.

Hepatosteatosis is associated with development of hepatic insulin resistance and T2D and, vice versa, T2D is an established risk factor for the development of NAFLD (4Birkenfeld A.L. Shulman G.I.

Development of T2D is initially characterized by decreased insulin sensitivity, manifested by ensuing hyperglycemia and a compensatory response where pancreatic β-cells produce and secrete more insulin, which in turn results in hyperinsulinemia. Thus, hyperinsulinemia, which is associated with both T2D and NAFLD, is generally considered a consequence of insulin resistance. Accumulating data suggest, however, that hyperinsulinemia may actually drive and/or perpetuate insulin resistance (12Shanik M.H. Xu Y. Skrha J. Dankner R. Zick Y. Roth J.

Here, we provide evidence that hyperinsulinemia triggers fatty liver development and insulin resistance by stimulating hepatic expression of Cd36. A 3w sucrose-enriched diet was sufficient to provoke hyperinsulinemia, increased hepatic Pparγ and Cd36 expression, hepatosteatosis, hepatic insulin resistance, and dysglycemia in CBA/J mice. We also show that high levels of insulin alone directly enhance Cd36 expression in perfused livers and isolated hepatocytes and that insulin stimulation of hepatic Cd36 expression is Pparγ-dependent. Our data suggest a direct and sufficient role for hyperinsulinemia in Pparγ-mediated enhancement of hepatic Cd36 expression and thus the subsequent development of hepatosteatosis.

Animals were fed standard diet (CRM (E), Special Diet Service) and maintained on a 12:12-h light/dark cycle in a temperature/humidity-controlled (22 °C/50% humidity) room. For the sucrose-rich diet (SRD) regime, 10-week-old CBA/J, C57BL/6J, or C3H/HeN mice were given regular chow and 32% sucrose (Sigma) drinking water. The animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Umeå University. Animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Blood/plasma samples were collected from 6-h fasted CBA, B6, and C3H mice. Blood glucose was measured using glucometer (Ultra 2, One Touch), and plasma insulin was analyzed by an ultrasensitive mouse insulin ELISA kit (Crystal Chem Inc.). Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), glucose tolerance test (GTT), and insulin tolerance test (ITT) was performed as described in (15Steneberg P. Rubins N. Bartoov-Shifman R.

Area under the curve was calculated according to the trapezoid rule. The homeostasis model for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated from the fasting blood glucose (mmol/liter) × fasting plasma insulin (microunits/liter) divided by 22.5. Oil-red-O staining of liver sections and determination of liver triglycerides were performed as described previously (15Steneberg P. Rubins N. Bartoov-Shifman R. Walker M.D. Edlund H.

To address hepatic insulin signaling, we performed intraperitoneal injections of insulin (0.1 milliunits/μl in 1× PBS) or equal volume control solution (1× PBS) in conscious mice (1.5 milliunits/kg). 20 min after injection, mice were killed, and livers were rapidly (within 30 s) dissected. Liver pieces were immediately put into liquid nitrogen and then stored at −80 °C for Western blot analysis. Livers of 10-week-old male B6 or C3H mice were perfused with a 37 °C control (EBSS, E3024, Sigma, + 0.1% BSA) or insulin solution (10 nm insulin, Actrapid, in EBSS + 0.1% BSA) at flow rate of 100 ml/h by inserting a 27-gauge syringe in the portal vein and cutting open the right atrium of the heart. After 1 h, the liver was dissected into pieces that were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for Western blot analysis. Primary hepatocytes were isolated from CBAxB6 F1 mice, following the protocol described previously (29Nilsson S.K. Anderson F. Ericsson M. Larsson M. Makoveichuk E. Lookene A. Heeren J. Olivecrona G. Triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins protect lipoprotein lipase from inactivation by ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1821: 1370-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Isolated primary hepatocytes were seeded on 12-l or 6-well collagen I-coated plates (BD Biosciences) and cultured in a 37 °C/5% CO2 incubator. Primary hepatocytes were incubated for 4 h in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS, 1× GlutaMAX (Life Technologies, Inc.), and penicillin/streptomycin to promote cell adhesion to the wells, followed by a change of media to serum-free Medium 199 (Gibco, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 100 nm dexamethasone and penicillin/streptomycin, and incubated overnight. The hepatocytes were then exposed to fresh media with or without 10 nm insulin (Actrapid) and incubated for 5 and 45 min. At the end time point, the hepatocytes were harvested for Western blot analysis. In each biological replicate, the experiment for the 45-min time point was performed in duplicate/triplicate wells. Liver tissue whole cell lysates containing an equal amount of protein were run on 4–15% polyacrylamide gels. For PKCϵ translocation experiment, 100 mg of liver tissue was used as starting material, and subcellular fractionation was performed with the subcellular protein fractionation kit for tissues (Pierce). Antibodies used for immunoblotting analysis are listed in Table 1. Semi-quantitative densitometry analysis of signals was performed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Quantification values were normalized against GAPDH (cytoplasmic fractions and whole liver lysates) or Na/K-ATPase (membrane proteins), and the relative mean protein expression ratio of control samples was arbitrarily set to 1. For PKCϵ translocation, the membrane (normalized to Na/K-ATPase)/cytosolic (normalized to GAPDH) fraction ratio was calculated (arbitrary units) (11Samuel V.T. Liu Z.-X. Qu X. Elder B.D. Bilz S.

MISSION siRNA universal negative control 1 (Sigma) was used as control siRNA. HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes were transfected using Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the reverse transfection protocol. HepG2 cells were transfected with control and PPARγ siRNA (final concentration 10 nm) and were seeded in 24-well plates (50,000 cells/well). Primary hepatocytes were transfected with control and PPARγ siRNA (final concentration 10 nm) and were seeded in 12-well collagen-coated plates (100,000 cells/well). 24 h after transfection, cell culture medium was replaced with either control medium or medium containing 100 mm insulin, and cells were incubated for 2 h (HepG2 cells) or 100 min (primary hepatocytes). 30 h after transfection, HepG2 cells serum-containing culture medium was replaced with serum-free culture medium. 48 h after transfection, cell culture medium was replaced with control medium or medium containing 10 nm insulin, and cells were incubated for 2 h (HepG2 cells) or 100 min (primary hepatocytes). After this incubation period, cells were harvested for RNA preparation. All data are presented as mean ± S.E. In all experiments, n refers to the number of biological replicates. Data were analyzed and graphs were generated using Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism 6. A two-tailed Student's t test was used for all analyses between the two groups or the two treatments, and the following p values were considered to be statistically significant: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001. To investigate a potential correlation between hyperinsulinemia and development of hepatosteatosis, we established an in vivo model for early onset hyperinsulinemia by exposing CBA/J (CBA), i.e. high insulin secreting, and C57BL6/J (B6), i.e. low insulin secreting, mice to a standard diet (CD) or standard diet plus 32% sucrose in the drinking water (sucrose-rich diet (SRD)) during a 3w period. Under these regimes, fasted insulin levels were significantly increased in 3w SRD CBA as compared with 3w CD CBA mice (Fig. 1A), whereas fasted insulin levels were overall lower in B6 mice and did not increase on a sucrose-rich diet, not even at 3w (Fig. 1A). Thus, a 3w SRD provokes early onset hyperinsulinemia in CBA but not B6 mice. In both CBA and B6 mice on SRD, the fasted blood glucose levels were slightly increased during the 3w period (Fig. 1B). SRD B6 mice showed a modest increase in body weight at 2 and 3w as compared with age-matched CD B6 mice, although there was no difference in body weight between the CD and SRD group of CBA mice (Fig. 1C). Nonetheless, total body fat content was increased already after 1 week in SRD CBA mice compared with CD CBA mice (Fig. 1D). In contrast, total body fat content was generally lower in B6 mice and did not increase in response to SRD (Fig. 1D). GTT confirmed the hyperinsulinemic phenotype of 3w SRD CBA mice; thus, in addition to fasting hyperinsulinemia, GSIS was significantly increased at 30 min following glucose injection (Fig. 1E). Consistent with the development of hyperinsulinemia and enhanced GSIS, CBA mice on 3w of SRD were glucose-intolerant (Fig. 1F). In contrast, 3w SRD B6 mice did not show enhanced GSIS or glucose intolerance during a GTT (Fig. 1, E and F). Taken together, these data show that, regardless of diet, nonstimulated and stimulated insulin levels were markedly higher in CBA mice than in B6 mice. In addition, 3w of SRD provoked hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance, and increased body fat content in CBA mice. In contrast, B6 mice have lower basal levels of insulin compared with CBA mice and did not develop hyperinsulinemia nor glucose intolerance on increased body fat mass, in response to the 3w of SRD. The hyperinsulinemia in 3w SRD CBA mice was paralleled by hepatic lipid accumulation as evidenced by increased accumulation of fat droplets and increased TG levels (Fig. 2, A and B), providing evidence of hepatosteatosis. In contrast, hepatic TG content was not increased in B6 mice following 3w of SRD (Fig. 2, A and B). Notably, the TG content of CD B6 livers were considerably lower than that of CD CBA mice, thus paralleling the overall lower basal insulin levels of B6 mice compared with CBA mice. Hepatic fat accumulation is frequently associated with hepatic insulin resistance (30Liu Q. Bengmark S. Qu S.

Both silk fibroin (SF) and chitosan (CS) are non-toxic and have good biocompatibility, but are poor biological scaffolds when used alone. In this study, the microscopic structure and related properties of SF/CS composite scaffolds with different component ratios were examined. The scaffold material most suitable for osteoblast growth was determined, and these results offer an experimental basis for the future reconstruction of bone defects. First, via freeze-drying and chemical crosslinking methods, SF/CS composites with different component ratios were prepared and their structure was characterized. Changes in the internal structure of the SF and CS mixture were observed, confirming that the mutual modification between the two components was complete and stable. The internal structure of the composite material was porous and three-dimensional with a porosity above 90%. We next studied the pore size, swelling ratio, water absorption ratio, degradation and in vitro cell proliferation. For the 40% SF-60% CS group, the pore size of the scaffold was suitable for the growth of osteoblasts, and the rate of degradation was steady. This favors the early adhesion, growth and proliferation of MG-63 cells. In addition to good biocompatibility and satisfactory cell affinity, this material promotes the secretion of extracellular matrix materials by osteoblasts. Thus, 40% SF-60% CS is a good material for bone tissue engineering."

S. gordonii expresses a putative arginine-ornithine antiporter (ArcD) whose function has not been investigated despite relevance to the ADS and potential influence on inter-bacterial communication with periodontal pathogens that utilize amino acids as a main energy source. Here, we generated an S. gordonii ΔarcD mutant to explore the role of ArcD in physiological homeostasis and bacterial cross-feeding. First, we confirmed that S. gordonii ArcD plays crucial roles for mediating arginine uptake and promoting bacterial growth, particularly under arginine-limited conditions. Next, metabolomic profiling and transcriptional analysis of the ΔarcD mutant revealed that deletion of this gene caused intracellular accumulation of ornithine leading to malfunction of the ADS and suppression of de novo arginine biosynthesis. The mutant strain also showed increased susceptibility to low pH stress due to reduced production of ammonia. Finally, accumulation of Fusobacterium nucleatum was found to be significantly decreased in biofilm formed by the ΔarcD mutant as compared with the wild-type strain, although ornithine supplementation restored fusobacterium biovolume in dual-species biofilms with the ΔarcD mutant and also enhanced single species biofilm development by F. nucleatum. Our results are the first direct evidence showing that S. gordonii ArcD modulates not only alkali and energy production but also interspecies interaction with F. nucleatum, thus initiating a middle stage of periodontopathic biofilm formation, by metabolic cross-feeding.

The data presented herein demonstrate that mRNA knockdowns of APLP2, sortilin, or both in the human hepatocyte cell lines HepG2 and Huh7 do not affect the ability of extracellular PCSK9 to enhance the degradation of the LDLR. Furthermore, mice deficient in APLP2 or sortilin do not exhibit significant changes in liver LDLR or plasma total cholesterol levels. Moreover, cellular overexpression of one or both proteins does not alter PCSK9 secretion, or its activity on the LDLR. We conclude that PCSK9 enhances the degradation of the LDLR independently of either APLP2 or sortilin both ex vivo and in mice. Interestingly, when co-expressed with PCSK9, both APLP2 and sortilin were targeted for lysosomal degradation. Using chemiluminescence proximity and co-immunoprecipitation assays, as well as biosynthetic analysis, we discovered that sortilin binds and stabilizes APLP2, and hence could regulate its intracellular functions on other targets.

https://openalex.org/W1493492753,"Overview Eight years of octopus fishery records from southwest Madagascar reveal significant positive impacts from 36 periodic closures on: (a) fishery catches and (b) village fishery income, such that (c) economic benefits from increased landings outweigh costs of foregone catch. Closures covered ~20% of a village’s fished area and lasted 2-7 months. Fishery Catches from Each Closed Site Octopus landings and catch per unit effort (CPUE) significantly increased in the 30 days following a closure’s reopening, relative to the 30 days before a closure (landings: +718%, p<0.0001; CPUE: +87%, p<0.0001; n = 36). Open-access control sites showed no before/after change when they occurred independently of other management (“no ban”, n = 17/36). On the other hand, open-access control sites showed modest catch increases when they extended a 6-week seasonal fishery shutdown (“ban”, n = 19/36). The seasonal fishery shutdown affects the entire region, so confound all potential control sites. Fishery Income in Implementing Villages In villages implementing a closure, octopus fishery income doubled in the 30 days after a closure, relative to 30 days before (+132%, p<0.001, n = 28). Control villages not implementing a closure showed no increase in income after “no ban” closures and modest increases after “ban” closures. Villages did not show a significant decline in income during closure events. Net Economic Benefits from Each Closed Site Landings in closure sites generated more revenue than simulated landings assuming continued open-access fishing at that site (27/36 show positive net earnings; mean +$305/closure; mean +57.7% monthly). Benefits accrued faster than local fishers’ time preferences during 17-27 of the 36 closures. High reported rates of illegal fishing during closures correlated with poor economic performance.

Here, we interrogated the importance of IDE-mediated catabolism on insulin clearance in vivo. Using a structure-based design, we linked two newly identified ligands binding at unique IDE exosites together to construct a potent series of novel inhibitors.

Because one of these inhibitors (NTE-1) was determined to have pharmacokinetic properties sufficient to sustain plasma levels >50 times its IDE IC50 value, studies in rodents were conducted. In oral glucose tolerance tests with diet-induced obese mice, NTE-1 treatment improved the glucose excursion. Yet in insulin tolerance tests and euglycemic clamp experiments, NTE-1 did not enhance insulin action or increase plasma insulin levels. Importantly, IDE inhibition with NTE-1 did result in elevated plasma amylin levels, suggesting the in vivo role of IDE action on amylin may be more significant than an effect on insulin.

https://openalex.org/W1545243303,"Our understanding of the mechanism of cancer dormancy is emerging, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we analyzed mouse xenograft tumors derived from human breast cancer tissue and the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 to identify the molecules associated with cancer dormancy. In immunohistological examination using the proliferation marker Ki-67, the tumors included both proliferating and dormant cancer cells, but the number of dormant cells was remarkably increased when they metastasized to the lung. In the gene expression analysis of the orthotopic cancer cells by a single-cell multiplex real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR followed by flow cytometric analysis, restrained cellular proliferation was associated with downregulation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4. In the immunohistological and flow cytometric analyses, the expression level of CXCR4 in the metastasized cancer cells was decreased compared with that in the cancer cells in orthotopic tumors, although the expression level of the CXCR4 ligand CXCL12 was not reduced in the lung. In addition, the proliferation of the metastasized cancer cells was further decreased by the CXCR4 antagonist administration. In the ex vivo culture of the metastasized cancer cells, the expression level of CXCR4 was increased, and in the xenotransplantation of ex vivo cultured cancer cells, the expression level of CXCR4 was again decreased in the metastasized cancer cells in the lung. These findings indicate that CXCR4 is downregulated in metastasized breast cancer cells and implicated in their dormancy."

Nitration of the pro-survival chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) in position 33 and 56 induces motor neuron death through a toxic gain-of-function. Here we show that nitrated Hsp90 regulates mitochondrial metabolism independently of the induction of cell death. In PC12 cells, a small fraction of nitrated Hsp90 was located on the mitochondrial outer membrane and down-regulated mitochondrial membrane potential, oxygen consumption, and ATP production. Neither endogenous Hsp90 present in the homogenate nor unmodified and fully active recombinant Hsp90 was able to compete with the nitrated protein for the binding to mitochondria. Moreover, endogenous or recombinant Hsp90 did not prevent the decrease in mitochondrial activity but supported nitrated Hsp90 mitochondrial gain-of-function. Nitrotyrosine in position 33, but not in any of the other four tyrosine residues prone to nitration in Hsp90, was sufficient to down-regulate mitochondrial activity. Thus, in addition to induction of cell death, nitrated Hsp90 can also regulate mitochondrial metabolism, suggesting that depending on the cell type, distinct Hsp90 nitration states regulate different aspects of cellular metabolism. This regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis by nitrated Hsp90 could be of particular relevance in cancer cells.

In mammalian cells, Hsp90 plays a role in targeting and translocation of preproteins to mitochondria (19Young J.C. Hoogenraad N.J. Hartl F.U.

In cancer cells, Hsp90 participates in a chaperone network that regulates mitochondrial integrity and homeostasis. Organelle-specific inhibition of this network causes the disruption of mitochondrial integrity and stimulates apoptosis (20Kang B.H. Plescia J. Dohi T. Rosa J. Doxsey S.J. Altieri D.C.

Here we show that nitrated Hsp90 associates with mitochondria and regulates mitochondrial activity without inducing the release of cytochrome c. Site-specific nitration of tyrosine 33 on Hsp90 confers a gain-of-function responsible for the regulation of mitochondrial activity. Peroxynitrite was synthesized by rapidly mixing acidified hydrogen peroxide with sodium nitrite and quenching the reaction with sodium hydroxide as previously described (21Robinson K.M. Beckman J.S. Synthesis of peroxynitrite from nitrite and hydrogen peroxide.Methods Enzymol. 2005; 396: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Undifferentiated PC12 cells were cultured as previously described (3Franco M.C. Ye Y. Refakis C.A. Feldman J.L. Stokes A.L. Basso M. Melero Fernández de Mera R.M. Sparrow N.A. Calingasan N.Y.

For subcellular fractionation, 1 × 107 cells were washed twice with warm phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and resuspended in 10 ml of 50 mm PBS. The cells were gently vortexed, and peroxynitrite was slowly added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. The cells were then incubated for 3 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2/air and immediately processed for subcellular fractionation, or the buffer was replaced by complete RPMI medium, and the cells were incubated for an additional 2 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2/air before performing the subcellular fractionation. For high content imaging, 2 × 104 cells were plated per well in a 96-well glass-bottom plate and incubated overnight under normal culture conditions. After three washes with warm PBS, the cultures were incubated with peroxynitrite (0.5 mm) for 3 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2/air. The buffer was replaced by complete RPMI medium, and the cells were incubated for an additional 2 h before fixation and staining for high content imaging. For the reverse order addition treatment, peroxynitrite was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C before being added to the cells (decomposed peroxynitrite). PC12 cell homogenates were obtained by disruption of PC12 cells in ice-cold MT buffer (0.3 m mannitol, 10 mm HEPES) using a glass and Teflon Potter S Homogenizer (Sartorius, Bohemia, NY). The disrupted cells were centrifuged at 600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was centrifuged again at 600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The final supernatant corresponds to PC12 cell homogenates. For the experiments where cell homogenates were used, the amount of protein in the homogenates was assayed using the Qubit Fluorometer (Invitrogen), and the concentration was adjusted to 1 mg/ml with ice-cold MT buffer. To obtain the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions, the cell homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was centrifuged for an additional 20 min at 12,000 × g, 4 °C. The pellet (mitochondrial fraction) was resuspended in ice-cold MT buffer and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g, 4 °C. The mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were then prepared for Western blot analysis. PC12 cell homogenates (200 μg) were incubated with 2.5 μg of either recombinant unmodified or nitrated Hsp90 for 2 h at 37 °C with the addition of 0.5 mm potassium phosphate and in the presence of 4.2 mm succinate. The mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were obtained by subcellular fractionation as detailed above and prepared for Western blot analysis.

Recombinant wild type and mutant Hsp90β were purified from the bacterial cultures using the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid purification system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two microliters of a freshly prepared peroxynitrite dilution were slowly added to 30 μl of recombinant Hsp90 (1 mg/ml in PBS) under gentle vortexing to a final concentration of 0.5 mm peroxynitrite. The intracellular delivery of Hsp90 and nitrated Hsp90 was performed as described before (3Franco M.C. Ye Y. Refakis C.A. Feldman J.L. Stokes A.L. Basso M. Melero Fernández de Mera R.M. Sparrow N.A.

Briefly, a mixture containing 10 μg of the protein and 4 μl of the lipophilic Chariot (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) was prepared. A pellet corresponding to 1 × 106 PC12 cells was gently resuspended in the protein/Chariot mixture and RPMI 1640. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2/air, RPMI medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics was added, and the cells were incubated for an additional hour. After incubation, the cells were plated at the indicated concentrations. The oxygen consumption rate (OCR) 2The abbreviations used are: OCRoxygen consumption rateFCCPp-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazoneSODsuperoxide dismutaseANOVAanalysis of variance. was measured in adherent PC12 cells using a XF24 extracellular flux analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, Billerica, MA). After intracellular delivery of nitrated Hsp90, the cells were seeded in a XF24- well cell culture microplate (Seahorse Bioscience) at a density of 7 × 104 cells per well and incubated for 5 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Then, the medium was replaced by 700 μl of seahorse running media (DMEM, 5.6 mm glucose, 1 mm pyruvate, 4 mm l-glutamine), and the cells were incubated for an additional hour. The OCR was determined under basal conditions and after the sequential addition of previously titrated oligomycin (3 μm), carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP, 10 μm), and antimycin A (10 μm) as previously described (24Dranka B.P.

Gibb A.A. Hill B.G. Comprehensive measurement of respiratory activity in permeabilized cells using extracellular flux analysis.Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9: 421-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Briefly, after intracellular delivery of the recombinant proteins, PC12 cells were seeded at 3 × 104 cells per well in a XF-96-well plate (Seahorse Biosciences). The optimal cell density and concentration of permeabilizing agent (saponin, 25 μg/ml) was determined before assessing complex activities. Before measuring, the medium was removed and replaced with MAS buffer (70 mm sucrose, 220 mm mannitol, 10 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.2). In addition to saponin and ADP (1 mm), specific substrates were added to measure complex activities. Complex I was 5 mm pyruvate, 2.5 mm malate. The addition of 1 μm rotenone was used to determine complex I rotenone-sensitive activity. Complex II was 10 mm succinate. Inhibition of complex III by the addition of 10 μm antimycin A was used to subtract the OCR not related to complex II activity. Complex III was 0.5 mm duroquinol. The addition of 10 μm antimycin A was used to determine complex III specific activity. Complex IV was 0.5 mm N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD) and 2 mm ascorbate. The OCR measured in the presence of 20 mm azide was subtracted to complex IV activity. Cell number per well was comparable across the plate. The complex activities were calculated as: maximal OCR minus OCR in the presence of the specific inhibitors. To determine the presence of nitrated Hsp90 in mitochondria of PC12 cells, 20,000 cells per well were plated in a 96-well plate and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2/air. The cells were then treated with 0.5 mm peroxynitrite or the products of peroxynitrite decomposition. The cultures were incubated for 2 min at room temperature and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde plus 0.1% glutaraldehyde (Sigma) on ice for 20 min before the staining was performed. The cells were incubated with an anti-nitrated Hsp90 monoclonal antibody (1:2000), as previously described (3Franco M.C. Ye Y. Refakis C.A. Feldman J.L. Stokes A.L. Basso M.

The localization of nitrated Hsp90 was determined by high content imaging and compartmental analysis using the Cellomics ArrayScan VTI (ThermoFisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Nitrated Hsp90 levels in cytosol or mitochondria were measured as the average mean intensity in a ring around DAPI-stained nuclear areas (ring) or spots in a ring around the nuclear areas (ring spots), respectively.

All Western blots were visualized, and the bands were quantified using the Odyssey System (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Quantification of endogenous Hsp90 was performed by loading 10 μg of total protein from PC12 cell homogenates together with a standard curve of recombinant human Hsp90 in a gel followed by SDS-PAGE, protein transfer to a PVDF membrane, and infrared detection using an anti-Hsp90 antibody (1:1,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Detection of recombinant human Hsp90 was performed using an anti-myc-tag antibody (1:2,000, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) or anti-V5-tag antibody (1:5,000, Invitrogen) and normalized using an anti-mitochondrial Complex I NDUFA9 subunit antibody (1:5,000, Molecular Probes/ThermoFisher Scientific, Eugene, OR) or anti-tubulin antibody (1:10,000, Sigma). PC12 cell mitochondrial content after intracellular delivery of the recombinant proteins was assayed by infrared Western blot for mitochondrial Complex I NDUFA9 subunit and MnSOD (anti-MnSOD antibody, 1:1000, EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) and by measuring MitoTracker Green fluorescence according with the manufacturer's instructions (100 nm, Molecular Probes/ThermoFisher Scientific) using a Plate Runner (Trophos, Marseilles, France) and a Synergy H1 multi-mode reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT). When indicated, 10 μm FCCP was added to the cells together with the MitoTracker Green. After intracellular delivery of the recombinant proteins, PC12 cells were plated (50,000 cells per well) and incubated for 2.5 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2/air before adding the probe JC-1 (1 μm, Molecular Probes/ThermoFisher Scientific). The cells were then incubated for an extra 30 min followed by a wash with Dulbecco's PBS. Fluorescence was measured at 560ex/590em (red) and 485ex/530em (green), and the data are expressed as the ratio of red/green signals. When indicated, 10 μm FCCP was added to the cells together with the JC-1. PC12 cell homogenates (1 mg/ml) were incubated with 5 and 50% recombinant unmodified Hsp90 (0.26 and 2.6 μg of recombinant protein per 200 μg of cell homogenate, respectively), peroxynitrite-treated Hsp90, or site-specific nitrated Hsp90 (3NT33, 3NT56, 3NT276, 3NT484, and 3NT596) for 30 min at 37 °C with the addition of 0.5 mm potassium phosphate, 4.2 mm succinate, and in the presence or absence of 2 μm FCCP. The probe JC-1 (75 nm) was then added, and the homogenate was incubated at 37 °C for additional 30 min. Fluorescence (560ex/590em) was read on a 96-well plate with 50 μg of total protein per well. For the measurement of isolated mitochondria, the cell homogenates (1 mg/ml) were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C before incubating with the recombinant proteins. The supernatant was replaced with the same volume of MT buffer supplemented with 0.5 mm potassium phosphate and in the presence or absence of 4.2 mm succinate. The pellet (isolated mitochondria) was gently resuspended and incubated with the recombinant proteins as described above. When indicated, mitochondria pellets were resuspended in their corresponding cytosolic fractions or supplemented with the same amount of recombinant Hsp90 as endogenous Hsp90 present in the original cell homogenate (5.2 μg of recombinant protein added to isolated mitochondria from 200 μg of cell homogenate). PC12 cell homogenates (1 mg/ml) were incubated with 5 and 50% recombinant unmodified or nitrated Hsp90 for 45 min at 37 °C with the addition of 0.5 mm potassium phosphate, 4.2 mm succinate, and in the presence or absence of 2 μm FCCP. After incubation, the ATP production was stopped by the addition of 2 μm FCCP, and the ATP levels were measured in 10 μg of total protein from cell homogenates using the ATP Bioluminescence Assay kit HS II (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To assay the ATP produced during incubation with the recombinant proteins, the ATP level from cell homogenates incubated in the presence of 2 μm FCCP was used as basal level. PC12 cell homogenates (200 μg) or isolated mitochondria (50 μg) were incubated with 2.6 μg of either recombinant unmodified Hsp90, peroxynitrite-treated Hsp90, or site-specific nitrated Hsp90(3NT33) for 1 h at 37 °C with the addition of 0.5 mm potassium phosphate and in the presence or absence of 4.2 mm succinate or 2 μm FCCP. The mitochondrial fraction was then recovered by centrifuging at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C followed by two washes with ice-cold MT buffer. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 10 μl MT buffer with protease inhibitors for Western blot analysis. To determine the submitochondrial location of nitrated Hsp90, the mitochondrial fraction was resuspended in 50 μl of MT buffer and incubated with proteinase K (5 μg/ml) for an additional 25 min on ice. Proteinase K activity was then inhibited by the addition of 30 μm PMSF. For the competition assay, cell homogenates (200 μg) were incubated with 2 μg of peroxynitrite-treated Hsp90 or site-specific nitrated Hsp90(3NT33) and increasing concentrations of unmodified Hsp90 (0.2–20 μg) for 1 h at 37 °C. The measurement of complex I, II+III, and IV activities was performed in disrupted mitochondria as previously described (28Franco M.C. Antico Arciuch V.G. Peralta J.G. Galli S. Levisman D. López L.M.

https://openalex.org/W1810364666,"In mammalian cells, signal peptide-dependent protein transport into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is mediated by a dynamic polypeptide-conducting channel, the heterotrimeric Sec61 complex. Previous work has characterized the Sec61 complex as a potential ER Ca2+ leak channel in HeLa cells and identified ER lumenal molecular chaperone immunoglobulin heavy-chain-binding protein (BiP) as limiting Ca2+ leakage via the open Sec61 channel by facilitating channel closing. This BiP activity involves binding of BiP to the ER lumenal loop 7 of Sec61α in the vicinity of tyrosine 344. Of note, the Y344H mutation destroys the BiP binding site and causes pancreatic β-cell apoptosis and diabetes in mice. Here, we systematically depleted HeLa cells of the BiP co-chaperones by siRNA-mediated gene silencing and used live cell Ca2+ imaging to monitor the effects on ER Ca2+ leakage. Depletion of either one of the ER lumenal BiP co-chaperones, ERj3 and ERj6, but not the ER membrane-resident co-chaperones (such as Sec63 protein, which assists BiP in Sec61 channel opening) led to increased Ca2+ leakage via Sec6 complex, thereby phenocopying the effect of BiP depletion. Thus, BiP facilitates Sec61 channel closure (i.e. limits ER Ca2+ leakage) via the Sec61 channel with the help of ERj3 and ERj6. Interestingly, deletion of ERj6 causes pancreatic β-cell failure and diabetes in mice and humans. We suggest that co-chaperone-controlled gating of the Sec61 channel by BiP is particularly important for cells, which are highly active in protein secretion, and that breakdown of this regulatory mechanism can cause apoptosis and disease.

Therefore, gating of the Sec61 channel has to be tightly regulated by its allosteric effectors, ER lumenal immunoglobulin heavy-chain-binding protein (BiP) and cytosolic Ca2+-calmodulin (CaM). In addition, the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) counteracts Ca2+ leakage from the ER (15Camello C. Lomax R. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A.V.

By combining siRNA-mediated gene silencing and live cell Ca2+ imaging, it was observed in HeLa cells that reduced levels of BiP lead to increased Ca2+ leakage from the ER via the Sec61 complex. This increased leakage was seen in imaging of both cytosolic and ER lumenal Ca2+ when cells were challenged with thapsigargin in the presence of extracellular EGTA (16Schäuble N. Lang S. Jung M. Cappel S. Schorr S. Ulucan Ö. Linxweiler J. Dudek J. Blum R. Helms V. Paton A.W. Paton J.C. Cavalié A. Zimmermann R. BiP-mediated closing of the Sec61 channel limits Ca2+ leakage from the ER.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 3282-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that BiP binds to loop 7 of Sec61α in order to facilitate Sec61 channel closure. The action of BiP was highly specific (i.e. it could not be compensated by other abundant ER lumenal chaperones (PDI, Grp94, or calreticulin) or even its yeast ortholog, Kar2p) (16Schäuble N. Lang S. Jung M. Cappel S. Schorr S. Ulucan Ö. Linxweiler J. Dudek J. Blum R. Helms V. Paton A.W. Paton J.C. Cavalié A. Zimmermann R. BiP-mediated closing of the Sec61 channel limits Ca2+ leakage from the ER.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 3282-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Strikingly, mutant variant BiPR197E, which is deficient in its ability to cooperate with Hsp40-type co-chaperones, was also unable to mediate Sec61 channel closure, pointing toward the involvement of an Hsp40-type co-chaperone in Sec61 channel closure (16Schäuble N.

Furthermore, it was shown with a similar experimental approach that Ca2+-CaM can bind to an IQ motif present in the cytosolic amino terminus of the α-subunit of the heterotrimeric Sec61 complex and, with the help of ER membrane protein Sec62, limit Ca2+ leakage from the ER after Ca2+ has started to leak out (13Erdmann F.

Of note, a mouse model for diabetes has indicated that a single amino acid exchange in the ER lumenal loop 7 of murine Sec61α leads to a partially deficient Sec61 complex and to β-cell death as well as diabetes (19Lloyd D.J. Wheeler M.C. Gekakis N. A point mutation in Sec61α1 leads to diabetes and hepatosteatosis in mice.Diabetes. 2010; 59: 460-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). When wild type Sec61α was replaced with the corresponding mutant Sec61αY344H in human cells, Ca2+ leakage from the ER was increased and was no longer affected by manipulation of the BiP concentration (16Schäuble N. Lang S. Jung M. Cappel S. Schorr S. Ulucan Ö. Linxweiler J. Dudek J. Blum R. Helms V. Paton A.W. Paton J.C. Cavalié A. Zimmermann R. BiP-mediated closing of the Sec61 channel limits Ca2+ leakage from the ER.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 3282-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was suggested that failure of BiP to facilitate Sec61 channel closure in the homozygous SEC61A1Y344H mouse contributes to apoptosis of cells with high secretory activity, such as pancreatic β-cells. It is interesting to note that various other mutations and knockouts of resident ER proteins can cause diabetes in mice, such as deletion of the Hsp40-type co-chaperones of BiP ERj4 and ERj6 (20Ladiges W.C.

Cell. 2001; 7: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). However, diabetes can also be caused in humans and mice by mutations in genes coding for non-ER proteins, such as the insulin gene. We asked whether the Hsp40-type co-chaperones of BiP that are involved in Sec61 channel closure can be identified and whether the mechanism of Sec61 channel closure by BiP can be further elucidated. For the latter question, we addressed the questions of whether artificial ligands of Sec61α loop 7 (i.e. specific antibodies or Fab fragments thereof) can substitute for BiP in mediating Sec61 channel closure in single channel measurements. We identified ERj3 (also termed DnaJB11) and ERj6 (also termed DnaJC3 or p58IPK) as the BiP co-chaperones that are involved in Sec61 channel closure in HeLa cells. Furthermore, we observed that Fabs, directed against Sec61α loop 7, can indeed trigger Sec61 channel closing in single channel recordings. In various tumor cells, inefficient Sec61 channel closure after SEC62 gene silencing or CaM inhibition is associated with reduced migratory potential (18Linxweiler M. Schorr S. Jung M. Schäuble N.

In our current study, we observed that ERJ3 and ERJ6 silencing causes the similar phenomenon, confirming their significance in the regulation of the Sec61 channel.

Fabs were analyzed by reductive or non-reductive (with or without β-mercaptoethanol in the sample buffer) SDS-PAGE. HeLa cells (ATCC catalog no.

For live cell calcium imaging, cells were grown on 25-mm glass coverslips pretreated with poly-l-lysine (1 mg/ml) for 1 h. Cell growth was monitored using the Countess® automated cell counter (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A HeLa cell line that stably expresses the FRET-based calcium sensor D1ER (HeLa-D1ER) was generated to measure the lumenal calcium concentration in the ER. D1ER was kindly provided by R. Y.

HeLa-D1ER cells were maintained in culture under selection with G418 (minimal essential medium (Gibco), 10% FBS, 0.5 mg/ml G418) and transferred to poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips previous to silencing and live cell calcium imaging experiments, as described below for naive HeLa cells. For gene silencing, 5.2 × 105 HeLa cells were seeded per 6-cm culture plate in normal culture. The cells were transfected with targeting siRNA (Table 1) or control siRNA (AllStars Negative Control siRNA, Qiagen) using HiPerFect Reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions (typical final concentration of siRNAs was 20 nm).

Cells were harvested, and total RNA was isolated by using the RNA blood kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription was performed with Superscript II RT (Invitrogen) and olgigo(dT) primers (Eurofins Genomics), and the cDNA was purified using the PCR purification kit (Qiagen). TaqMan® gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems) were used for quantitative real-time PCR of SEC61A1 (Hs00273698_m1), ERJ3 (Hs00212527_m1), ERJ4 (Hs00202448_m1), ERJ6 (Hs00534483_m1), CHOP (Hs99999174_m1), and BIP (Hs99999174_m1) in a StepOne Plus 96-well system (Applied Biosystems). ΔCt values were calculated using ACTB (Hs00357333_m1) as a standard, and the values were then normalized to control siRNA-treated cells. Alternatively, XBP1 was amplified in the same cDNA with Pfu polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and established primers (CACCTGAGCCCCGAGGAG and TTAGTTCATTAATGGCTTCCAGC) (31DuRose J.B. Tam A.B.

The PCR products were subjected to gel electrophoresis in the presence of GelRED and visualized with the GelDoc XR imaging system (Bio-Rad). Cells were seeded on glass coverslips and treated as indicated. After 96 h, the glass slides were removed and washed twice with cold PBS. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 4 °C. Fixed cells were permeabilized and blocked with PSS (PBS plus 0.1% saponin and 10% FCS) for 1 h at room temperature. To improve the antigen accessibility, RNase A (Roche Applied Science) was added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. After washing with PSS, indirect immunofluorescence staining with an affinity-purified rabbit antipeptide antibody directed against the COOH-terminal undecapeptide of human Sec62 protein (plus an amino-terminal cysteine) and Alexa Fluor 594-coupled secondary antibody from goats (Invitrogen) was performed. We note that the anti-Sec62 antibody is specific for Sec62 under denaturing as well as native conditions (i.e. Western blot and fluorescence microscopy signals were quenched after silencing of the SEC62 gene) (22Harding H.P.

The microscope was equipped with a plan-apochromat oil differential interference contrast lens with ×63 magnification and 1.4 numerical aperture (Carl Zeiss) and an iXonEM+885 EMCCD camera (Andor Technology). The mounting medium was Roti®-Mount FluorCare DAPI (Carl Roth), and the oil was Immersol 518F (Carl Zeiss). Precursor polypeptides were synthesized in reticulocyte lysate (nuclease-treated; Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) plus buffer or semipermeabilized cells, resulting in a final concentration between 3,200 and 12,800 cell equivalents/μl, for 60 min at 30 °C (co-translational transport experiment) (32Johnson N.

Alternatively, precursor polypeptides were synthesized in reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine for 16 min at 30 °C. After 5 min of incubation with RNase A (final concentration, 80 μg/ml) and cycloheximide (final concentration, 100 μg/ml) at 30 °C, buffer or semipermeabilized cells, resulting in a final concentration of 12,800 cell equivalents/μl, were added, and the incubation was continued for 30 min (post-translational transport experiment).

The p63 isoforms ΔNp63α, ΔNp63β, and ΔNp63γ were ectopically expressed in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs). The epithelial or mesenchymal state was determined by morphological changes and altered expression of various markers, e.g. fibronectin, E-Cadherin, and keratin 14. Overexpression of ΔNp63α and ΔNp63β but not ΔNp63γ isoforms led to morphological changes consistent with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, only ΔNp63α overexpression was able to maintain the morphological changes and molecular phenotype consistent with EMT. Interestingly, knockdown of all p63 isoforms by transfection of p63 siRNA also led to the EMT phenotype, further confirming the role of p63 in regulating the epithelial phenotype in NHEKs. EMT in NHKs accompanied loss of Grainyhead-Like 2 (GHRL2) and miR-200 family gene expression, both of which play crucial roles in determining the epithelial phenotype. Modulation of GRHL2 in NHKs also led to congruent changes in p63 expression. ChIP revealed direct GRHL2 binding to the p63 promoter. GRHL2 knockdown in NHK led to impaired binding of GRHL2 and changes in the histone marks consistent with p63 gene silencing. These data indicate the presence of a reciprocal feedback regulation between p63 and GRHL2 in NHEKs to regulate epithelial plasticity.

EMT is a process by which epithelial cells exhibit morphologic and molecular changes consistent with the mesenchymal phenotype and is involved in tissue and organ development and repair (7Hay E.D. Zuk A. Transformations between epithelium and mesenchyme: normal, pathological, and experimentally induced.Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1995; 26: 678-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Cells with the EMT phenotype exhibit loss of epithelial morphology and development of an elongated, spindled, mesenchymal morphology (8Grille S.J. Bellacosa A. Upson J. Klein-Szanto A.J. van Roy F.

The protein kinase Akt induces epithelial mesenchymal transition and promotes enhanced motility and invasiveness of squamous cell carcinoma lines.Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2172-2178PubMed Google Scholar). EMT is facilitated by the loss of cell-cell adhesion mediated by E-Cadherin (E-Cad), and loss of E-Cad expression serves as a marker for EMT (9Moreno-Bueno G. Peinado H. Molina P. Olmeda D.

GRHL2 is a novel transcription factor involved with epithelial morphogenesis, cell proliferation, and differentiation (12Chen W. Xiao Liu Z. Oh J.E. Shin K.H. Kim R.H. Jiang M. Park N.H. Kang M.K. Grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2) inhibits keratinocyte differentiation through epigenetic mechanism.Cell Death Dis. 2012; 3: e450Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Our recent studies have shown that GRHL2 transcriptionally regulates a broad spectrum of target genes, including the human telomerase (hTERT) gene, proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene, and epidermal differentiation complex genes (12Chen W. Xiao Liu Z. Oh J.E. Shin K.H. Kim R.H. Jiang M. Park N.H. Kang M.K.

Phenotypically, GRHL2 promotes epithelial cell proliferation and inhibits keratinocyte differentiation in NHEKs (12Chen W. Xiao Liu Z. Oh J.E. Shin K.H. Kim R.H. Jiang M. Park N.H. Kang M.K.

Other studies suggest its inhibitory role in EMT and apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines, demonstrating its involvement in cancer progression (14Xiang X. Deng Z. Zhuang X. Ju S. Mu J. Jiang H. Zhang L. Yan J. Miller D. Zhang H.G. Grhl2 determines the epithelial phenotype of breast cancers and promotes tumor progression.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7e50781 Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, GRHL2 down-regulates zinc finger E-box binding protein 1 (ZEB1), which triggers EMT through suppressing E-Cad expression (15Wellner U. Schubert J. Burk U.C. Schmalhofer O. Zhu F. Sonntag A. Waldvogel B. Vannier C. Darling D. zur Hausen A. Brunton V.G. Morton J. Sansom O. Schüler J. Stemmler M.P. Herzberger C. Hopt U. Keck T. Brabletz S. Brabletz T. The EMT-activator ZEB1 promotes tumorigenicity by repressing stemness-inhibiting microRNAs.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 1487-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). Therefore, GRHL2 is a determinant of epithelial phenotype through a transcriptional network of its target genes. Our previous study has demonstrated that ectopic ΔNp63α expression in NHEKs yields the EMT phenotype in a TGF-β-dependent manner (4Oh J.E. Kim R.H. Shin K.H. Park N.H. Kang M.K. DeltaNp63-alpha triggers epithelial-mesenchymal transition and confers stem cell properties in normal human keratinocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 38757-38767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that the induced EMT phenotype is specific to ectopic overexpression of ΔNp63α among the p63 isoforms. Alternatively, knockdown of all isoforms of p63 also led to the EMT phenotype through loss of GRHL2 and miR-200 family genes. Last, we found that GRHL2 directly binds to the p63 promoter and that p63 and GRHL2 regulate their mutual expression. This reciprocal feedback loop between p63 and GRHL2 may be critical in determining epithelial plasticity. Primary cultured single-cell suspensions of NHEKs were isolated from discarded foreskin epidermal tissues and grown in EpiLife medium supplemented with growth factors (Invitrogen), as described elsewhere (16Kang M.K. Bibb C. Baluda M.A. Rey O. Park N.H. In vitro replication and differentiation of normal human oral keratinocytes.Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Normal human oral keratinocytes (NHOKs) isolated from separated keratinizing oral epithelial tissues were prepared similar to NHEKs. NHEKs were serially subcultured and passed at 70% confluence until they reached replicative senescence. Replication kinetics were recorded as described previously (16Kang M.K. Bibb C. Baluda M.A. Rey O. Park N.H. In vitro replication and differentiation of normal human oral keratinocytes.Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Normal human oral fibroblasts (NHOFs) were obtained from discarded gingival connective tissue and cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen). Bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells and dental pulp stem cells were cultured in α-minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) and 5 mg/ml gentamicin sulfate (Gemini Bio-Products, West Sacramento, CA). The SCC4 and SCC9 cancer cell lines were cultured in DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen) and supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.4 pg/ml hydrocortisone, as described elsewhere (17Kang M.K. Guo W. Park N.H. Replicative senescence of normal human oral keratinocytes is associated with the loss of telomerase activity without shortening of telomeres.Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 85-95PubMed Google Scholar). Immortalized keratinocyte cell line HaCaT cells were grown in EpiLife medium supplemented with growth factors (Invitrogen). Cells were maintained at 37 °C at 5% CO2 in a humidified chamber. We constructed retroviral vectors expressing human wild-type ΔNp63α, ΔNp63β, and ΔNp63γ. Full-length cDNAs of ΔNp63 were cloned from the cDNA library obtained from primary human keratinocytes by PCR amplification. ΔNp63α, ΔNp63β, and ΔNp63γ cDNAs were subcloned into the pLXSN retroviral expression vector (Clontech, Mountainview, CA) at XhoI/BamHI restriction sites, and isoforms were confirmed by sequencing. Retroviral construction and infection were performed as described elsewhere (18Kang M.K. Park N.H. Extension of cell life span using exogenous telomerase.Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 151-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the infected cells were selected with 200 μg/ml G418 (Sigma). G418-resistant cells were continually maintained by serial subculture as outlined above. Transwell chambers with polycarbonate membranes were used to measure cell migration (Corning Inc., Corning, NY), according to methods described previously (19Giannelli G. Falk-Marzillier J. Schiraldi O. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quaranta V. Induction of cell migration by Matrix Metalloprotease-2 cleavage of Laminin-5.Science. 1997; 277: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). NHEK/LXSN, NHEK/ΔNp63α, NHEK/ΔNp63β, and NHEK/ΔNp63γ cells were cultured in EpiLife (Invitrogen) and seeded in the upper chamber of the transwell. Cells were allowed to migrate for 24 h, and the transwell was washed with 1× PBS and fixed in 10% formalin for 10 min. Cells were then stained with 1% crystal violet dissolved in 10% formalin for a duration of 1 h. Non-migratory cells were removed from the chamber, and the transwells were photographed. Cells were fixed for 15 min in 3.7% formaldehyde prior to permeabilization with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Cells were then blocked in 10% normal goat serum for 1 h. Antibodies against p63 (A4A), E-Cad, β-catenin, ZEB1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), GRHL2 (Abnova, Taipei City, Taiwan), and anti-FN (Sigma) were used as primary antibodies, and Alexa Fluor 488 IgG (Invitrogen) was used as a secondary antibody. Cells were counterstained with DAPI, and an Olympus BH2-RFCA fluorescence microscope was used to obtain images. NHEKs were transfected with nonspecific, scrambled siRNA (Si-SCR) or siRNA targeting human p63 (Si-p63) at a concentration of 10 nm using Lipofectamine reagents (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. NHEKs were transfected with Si-p63 once every 3 days over the course of 9 days. NHEK growth medium was replaced with mesenchymal growth medium (α-minimum essential medium/10% FBS and 5 mg/ml gentamicin sulfate) upon morphological transition to the mesenchymal phenotype. Whole cell extracts were isolated from the cultured cells, fractionated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to Immobilon membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Antibodies against p63 (A4A), p63 (H129), E-Cad, K14, ZEB1, N-Cad, GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), GRHL2 (Abnova), FN, and Snail (Sigma) were used. The chemiluminescence signal was detected using HyGLO chemiluminescent HRP antibody detection reagent (Denville Scientific, South Plainfield, NJ). Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using the RNeasy Plus mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Reverse transcription was performed with 5 μg of RNA by using the method described elsewhere (20Kang M.K. Kameta A. Shin K.H. Baluda M.A. Park N.H. Senescence occurs with hTERT repression and limited telomere shortening in human oral keratinocytes cultured with feeder cells.J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 199: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). qRT-PCR was performed for the relative mRNA expression of TAp63, ΔNp63, and GRHL2; relative microRNA expression of miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-141, and miR-429; and enrichment of GRHL2, trimethylated histone 3 at lysine 4, and trimethylated histone 3 at lysine 27 in triplicates for each sample with LC480 SYBR Green I Master Mix (Roche) using LightCycler 480 (Roche). The second derivative quantitation cycle (Cq) value was calculated after running a total of 50 cycles to compare the relative change in mRNA and microRNA expression. The primer sequences and the PCR conditions are available upon request. Cells were fixed for 10 min in 3.7% formaldehyde prior to permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 594 Phalloidin (Invitrogen) for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were counterstained with DAPI, and an Olympus BH2-RFCA fluorescence microscope was used to obtain images. The lentiviral vector expressing shRNA against GRHL2 (Sh-GRHL2) and the control vector expressing enhanced GFP were constructed as described previously (21Kang X. Chen W. Kim R.H. Kang M.K. Park N.H. Regulation of the hTERT promoter activity by MSH2, the hnRNPs K and D, and GRHL2 in human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells.Oncogene. 2009; 28: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Endogenous GRHL2 was knocked down with Sh-GRHL2. All lentiviral vectors used allow the identification of infected cells by a GFP signal under an epifluorescence microscope. The promoter regions of GRHL2 and p63 were cloned into the pGL3B-Luc reporter plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) expressing firefly luciferase. The promoter-luciferase constructs were transfected into SCC4 or SCC9 using Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) along with pRL-SV40 containing Renilla luciferase cDNA under the control of the SV40 enhancer/promoter. 48 h post-transfection, cells were collected, and the lysates were prepared using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using a luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). Renilla luciferase activity was used to control for the varied transfected efficiency. Gene promoter activity, reflected by firefly luciferase activity, was determined as the mean of at least triplicates per experiment. A ChIP assay was performed as described previously (12Chen W. Xiao Liu Z. Oh J.E. Shin K.H. Kim R.H. Jiang M. Park N.H. Kang M.K. Grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2) inhibits keratinocyte differentiation through epigenetic mechanism.Cell Death Dis. 2012; 3: e450Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins were cross-linked to DNA by adding 10% formaldehyde for 10 min, and 0.15 m glycine was used to stop cross-linking. The cells were then collected in ice-cold PBS supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture and lysed in buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1)). Genomic DNA was sonicated to produce DNA fragments 300–1000 bp in length. Cellular lysates were diluted 1:10 in ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm NaCl, protease inhibitors, and 16.7 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1)). Chromatin solutions were incubated with 5 μl of p63 or GRHL2 primary antibody (or 5 μl of mouse IgG) overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Immunocomplexes were precipitated with 30 μl of a protein G-agarose slurry (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) and eluted in 500 μl of buffer (1% SDS and 100 mm NaHCO3). Precipitated DNA was recovered by phenol extraction and used for PCR amplification to check the enrichment of p63, GRHL2, trimethylated histone 3 at lysine 4, or trimethylated histone 3 at lysine 27 in the gene promoter regions. qPCR was performed with the purified DNA using LightCycler 480 (Roche). Samples pulled down with IgG were included as the negative control. The qPCR readout was normalized relative to the amount of amplification from the input. The promoter regions analyzed in this study for p63 or GRHL2 enrichment were near transcription start sites (available upon request) that contribute to core promoter activity, and our previous data have shown that GRHL2 binds to these regions to regulate gene expression (12Chen W. Xiao Liu Z. Oh J.E. Shin K.H. Kim R.H. Jiang M. Park N.H. Kang M.K. Grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2) inhibits keratinocyte differentiation through epigenetic mechanism.Cell Death Dis. 2012; 3: e450Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Exogenous δNp63 isoforms were transduced in NHEK using retroviral vectors. Primary NHEK were infected with LXSN-δNp63α, LXSN-δNp63β, LXSN-δNp63γ, or LXSN control vector. Among the transduced cells, cells expressing the ΔNp63α and ΔNp63β isoforms showed morphological changes indicative of EMT, e.g. an elongated, flattened, and spindle-like morphology (Fig. 1A, left panel). However, we observed that, in NHEKs expressing the ΔNp63β isoforms, few mesenchymal-like cells were formed, and they were not able to be maintained in culture. A transwell migration assay also showed enhanced cellular motility, a hallmark of EMT (22Xu J. Lamouille S. Derynck R. TGF-β-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition.Cell Res. 2009; 19: 156-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar) in NHEK/ΔNp63α cells, whereas NHEK/ΔNp63β, NHEK/ΔNp63γ, and NHEK/LXSN cells showed limited transwell migration (Fig. 1A, right panel). To further determine the molecular phenotype of EMT in NHEKs transduced with various ΔNp63 isoforms, we performed Western blotting for the markers of the epithelial or mesenchyme state. Cells transduced with ΔNp63α, ΔNp63β, and ΔNp63γ were harvested at two different population doubling (PD) levels at PD24 and PD28. The EMT phenotype occurred between these two PD levels (Fig. 1C). We used both a pan-p63 antibody (p63 A4A) and a ΔNp63α-specific antibody (p63 H129) to assess protein expression of the ΔNp63 isoforms. We observed specific bands corresponding to the α, β, and γ isoforms of ΔNp63 that were distinctly visible at 60, 50, and 40 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1, B and C). We also noted that the high molecular weight p63 band denoted by the asterisk disappeared with occurrence of EMT only in the culture infected with LXSN-ΔNp63α at PD28, concomitant with the appearance of the EMT phenotype. We also found that only prolonged subculture of NHEK/ΔNp63α led to reduced protein expression of the epithelial markers E-Cad and K14 and increased expression of the mesenchymal marker FN (Fig. 1, B and C). Prolonged subculture of NHEK/ΔNp63α also led to down-regulation of GRHL2, a transcriptional regulator and EMT inhibitor that regulates epithelial proliferation and differentiation (12Chen W. Xiao Liu Z. Oh J.E. Shin K.H. Kim R.H. Jiang M. Park N.H. Kang M.K. Grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2) inhibits keratinocyte differentiation through epigenetic mechanism.Cell Death Dis. 2012; 3: e450Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Loss of E-Cad and enhanced FN expression in NHEK/ΔNp63α cells were also confirmed in situ (Fig. 2). In this particular culture, both cell types exhibiting the mesenchymal or epithelial phenotype were visible. Cells with the mesenchymal morphology also demonstrated an enhanced FN and reduced E-Cad signal. Collectively, these data indicate that ectopic expression of ΔNp63α, but not ΔNp63β and ΔNp63γ, in NHEKs triggers the EMT phenotype. Because EMT occurrence by ΔNp63α overexpression was accompanied by loss of the major p63 band (Fig. 1, B and C, asterisk), we asked whether the loss of all p63 isoforms would lead to EMT. NHEKs were transiently transfected with Si-SCR or Si-p63. To assess phenotypic and morphological changes upon p63 knockdown, we examined the changes in protein expression of p63, E-Cad, and FN 3, 6, and 10 days post-transfection with Si-SCR or Si-p63. 10 days post-transfection, NHEK/Si-p63 cells exhibited a complete loss of p63 and E-Cad protein expression, whereas FN expression was notably enhanced (Fig. 3A). These cells also exhibited a mesenchymal cell morphology after 17 days compared with NHEK/Si-SCR cells (Fig. 3B). We confirmed successful knockdown of p63 by qRT-PCR (Fig. 3C). In the control cells (Si-SCR), the levels of ΔNp63 and GRHL2 were substantially higher than those in NHOFs. Upon Si-p63 transfection, p63 was almost completely knocked down to a level similar to those of NHOFs. The TAp63 expression level was negligible in all tested samples. Concomitantly, we found that the GRHL2 level was also reduced drastically by p63 knockdown, indicating a link between p63 and GRHL2 in the epithelial phenotype. We also determined mesenchymal cell surface markers (e.g. CD44, CD73, CD90, and CD105) in NHEK/Si-p63 cells with the EMT phenotype. For comparison, we included bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells, dental pulp stem cells, and parental NHEKs. NHEK/Si-p63 cells with EMT the phenotype showed elevated CD44, CD90, and CD105 expression compared with the parental NHEKs, whereas the level of CD73 was reduced, consistent with other MSC cell types (Fig. 4), further supporting EMT in cells after loss of p63 expression. EMT is a process by which epithelial cells lose cell-to-cell contact adhesion and associated protein expression and exhibit a mesenchymal phenotype, including stress fiber formation and migration (22Xu J. Lamouille S. Derynck R. TGF-β-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition.Cell Res. 2009; 19: 156-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar). As additional evidence of EMT, NHEK/Si-p63 cells demonstrated stress fiber formation with organized F-actin (Fig. 3D). We also performed fluorescence microscopy to determine changes in EMT marker expression upon p63 knockdown in NHEKs. NHEK/Si-p63 cells showed loss of p63 and GRHL2 expression, reduced expression of E-Cad and β-catenin, and enhanced expression of ZEB1 and FN (Fig. 3E). We used NHEKs treated for 10 days with 5 ng/ml TGF-β as a positive control for EMT, which, similarly, showed reduced GRHL2, p63, K14, and β-catenin expression and enhanced FN expression by immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 5). Collectively, these data indicate that knockdown of all p63 isoforms in NHEKs led to EMT. In the next experiments, we investigated the mechanism underlying p63-associated EMT. In both NHEK/ΔNp63α and NHEK/Si-p63 cells, EMT occurred with enhanced expression of ZEB1 and N-Cad, which are linked with mesenchymal and stem cell characteristics (23Gandarillas A. Watt F.M. c-Myc promotes differentiation of human epidermal stem cells.Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2869-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6A). We also found that both NHEK/ΔNp63α and NHEK/Si-p63 cells exhibiting the EMT phenotype lost GRHL2 and E-Cad expression. Because GRHL2 is a direct upstream regulator of E-Cad (24Varma S. Cao Y. Tagne J.B. Lakshminarayanan M. Li J. Friedman T.B. Morell R.J. Warburton D. Kotton D.N. Ramirez M.I. The transcription factors Grainyhead-like 2 and NK2-homeobox 1 form a regulatory loop that coordinates lung epithelial cell morphogenesis and differentiation.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 37282-37295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), our data suggest that p63 modulation could lead to EMT through loss of GRHL2. Recent studies have shown that GRHL2 suppresses EMT by up-regulating miR-200 family genes (25Cieply B. Riley 4th, P. Pifer P.M. Widmeyer J. Addison J.B. Ivanov A.V. Denvir J. Frisch S.M. Suppression of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition by Grainyhead-like-2.Cancer Res. 2012; 72: 2440-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), which then down-regulate ZEB1 (26Korpal M. Lee E.S. Hu G. Kang Y. The miR-200 family inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer cell migration by direct targeting of E-cadherin transcriptional repressors ZEB1 and ZEB2.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14910-14914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). In this study, acquisition of the EMT phenotype in NHEK/ΔNp63α and NHEK/Si-p63 cells resulted in strong down-regulation of miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-141, and miR-429 microRNA expression (Fig. 6B). To test whether p63 directly binds to and regulates the expression of miR-200 family genes, we performed a ChIP assay. NHEK/ΔNp63α and NHEK/Si-p63 cells with the EMT phenotype showed a loss of p63 enrichment on the promoter regions of the miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, and miR-429 loci compared with those of parental NHEKs (Fig. 6C). No change in p63 enrichment on miR-141 was observed between NHOFs, parental NHEKs, and NHEK/ΔNp63α and NHEK/Si-p63 cells. These data suggest that p63 may regulate the epithelial phenotype in keratinocytes by direct regulation of GRHL2 and miR-200 family genes, although miR-141 may be bound and regulated by other factors downstream of p63. In another experiment, we induced EMT in SCC4 and HaCaT epithelial cell lines by exposure to TGF-β. In a time-dependent manner after TGF-β treatment, protein expression of p63 and GRHL2 was reduced, and the expression of FN, N-Cad, ZEB-1, and Snail was enhanced in SCC4 compared with the untreated cells (Fig. 7A). Similarly, HaCaT cells showed reduced expression of GRHL2, p63, and E-Cad and enhanced expression of FN and ZEB-1 upon TGF-β treatment in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 7B). These data further confirm the regulatory relationship between p63 and GRHL2 in EMT. Because GRHL2 is a transcription regulator for diverse gene targets, including those in the epidermal differentiation complex (12Chen W. Xiao Liu Z. Oh J.E. Shin K.H. Kim R.H. Jiang M. Park N.H. Kang M.K. Grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2) inhibits keratinocyte differentiation through epigenetic mechanism.Cell Death Dis. 2012; 3: e450Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we tested whether p63 itself would be under the regulation of GRHL2. GRHL2 was ectopically expressed in NHOFs and NHOKs by using retroviral vectors. Overexpression of GRHL2 resulted in a weak but notable up-regulation of p63 and E-Cad in NHOFs and very strong up-regulation in NHOKs (Fig. 7C). Also, GRHL2 overexpression in SCC9 cells, which lack endogenous GRHL2 gene expression, led to a visible p63 band and enhanced mRNA expression. Knockdown of GRHL2 in SCC4 cells, which express high endogenous GRHL2, almost completely abolished p63 expression (Fig. 7, C and E). Furthermore, in situ staining for GRHL2, p63, and β-catenin revealed protein expression only in SCC9 cells transduced with GRHL2, and not in control cells (Fig. 7D). Notably, there was heterogeneity in the level of p63 staining in SCC9 cells expressing exogenous GRHL2, presumably because of the varied level of GRHL2 expression in cells. Because our prior data indicated that p63 was necessary for GRHL2 expression (Fig. 3C), the above data indicate a reciprocity in the regulation between p63 and GRHL2 in determining the epithelial phenotype. We explored this possibility by performing a Dual-Luciferase reporter assay. Knockdown of GRHL2 in SCC4 cells resulted in diminished p63 promoter activity, whereas GRHL2 overexpression in SCC9 cells resulted in enhanced p63 promoter activity (Fig. 7F). Interestingly, knockdown of p63 in SCC4 cells also led to a notable reduction of GRHL2 promoter activity. Therefore, GRHL2 and p63 mutually regulate their promoter activity through a reciprocal feedback loop. To examine whether GRHL2 binds directly to the promoter region of p63, a ChIP assay was performed with SCC4 and NHEK cells. In both cell types, GRHL2 pulldown coimmunoprecipitated the p63 promoter fragment near the transcription start site. Also, GRHL2 enrichment on the p63 promoter was altered according to the level of GRHL2 protein, i.e. GRHL2 knockdown in SCC4 cells or overexpression in NHEKs (Fig. 8, A and B). As a positive control, we included GRHL2 binding to the promoter region of the hTERT gene, which is a known transcriptional target of GRHL2 (21Kang X. Chen W. Kim R.H. Kang M.K. Park N.H. Regulation of the hTERT promoter activity by MSH2, the hnRNPs K and D, and GRHL2 in human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells.Oncogene. 2009; 28: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). ChIP revealed a concordant GRHL2 binding signal to the hTERT promoter according to the GRHL2 protein level (Fig. 8C). ChIP-qPCR quantitatively showed the altered GRHL2 binding to the p63 promoter in concordance with the GRHL2 protein levels in SCC4 cells and NHEKs (Fig. 8, D and E). Furthermore, ChIP-qPCR analysis revealed reduced enrichment of trimethylated histone 3 at lysine 4, indicative of active chromatin on the p63 promoter, when GRHL2 was knocked down in SCC4 cells (Fig. 8F), in keeping with the loss of p63 expression in SCC4 cells with GRHL2 silencing. On the contrary, the repressive mark (trimethylated histone 3 at lysine 27) was slightly elevated with GRHL2 knockdown. Because p63 modulation showed regulatory effects on GRHL2 expression, these data indicate a reciprocal regulation between GRHL2 and p63 to establish the epithelial phenotype. Our laboratory has shown previously that overexpression of the ΔNp63α isoform conferred the EMT phenotype in NHEKs in a TGF-β-dependent manner (4Oh J.E. Kim R.H. Shin K.H. Park N.H. Kang M.K. DeltaNp63-alpha triggers epithelial-mesenchymal transition and confers stem cell properties in normal human keratinocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 38757-38767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This study also shows that ΔNp63β and ΔNp63γ do not fully transform NHEKs to the mesenchymal state, although there was morphological transition by ΔNp63β expression in NHEKs. One of the speculations from our prior study was that the ΔNp63α isoforms abolished the expression of the high molecular weight (∼75 kDa, Fig. 1, B and C, asterisk) p63 protein with unknown identity, which invariably occurred during EMT (4Oh J.E. Kim R.H. Shin K.H. Park N.H. Kang M.K. DeltaNp63-alpha triggers epithelial-mesenchymal transition and confers stem cell properties in normal human keratinocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 38757-38767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As an alternative approach, in this study we knocked down all p63 isoforms using pan-p63 siRNA. This transient knockdown of p63 isoforms led to the EMT phenotype 10 days post-transfection. Acquisition of the EMT phenotype in NHEK/ΔNp63α and NHEK/Si-p63 cells was assessed by altered morphology and expression of the EMT markers, e.g. loss of E-Cad, K14, and β-catenin expression and enhanced FN and ZEB1 expression. Although NHEK/ΔNp63α cells required serial subculture and several passages to induce molecular and phenotypic EMT-associated changes, NHEK/Si-p63 cells readily acquired these altered phenotype within 10 days after gene knockdown (Figs. 1C and 3A). In our previous paper, we showed that NHEK/ΔNp63α cells with the EMT phenotype acquired stemness characteristics and expressed high levels of reprogramming factors, e.g. Lin28 and Nanog (4Oh J.E. Kim R.H. Shin K.H. Park N.H. Kang M.K. DeltaNp63-alpha triggers epithelial-mesenchymal transition and confers stem cell properties in normal human keratinocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 38757-38767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Likewise, NHEK/Si-p63 cells showed stem characteristics, e.g. the ability to transdifferentiate into osteogenic and adipocytic lineages (data not shown). We also found that NHEK/Si-p63 cells expressed the cell surface markers CD44, CD73, CD90, and CD105, which are characteristically expressed in the MSC population (Fig. 4) (27Pittenger M.F. Mackay A.M. Beck S.C. Jaiswal R.K. Douglas R. Mosca J.D. Moorman M.A. Simonetti D.W. Craig S. Marshak D.R. Multilineage potential of adult human mesenchymal stem cells.Science. 1999; 284: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (17993) Google Scholar, 28Dominici M. Le Blanc K. Mueller I. Slaper-Cortenbach I.

Minimal criteria for defining multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells: the International Society for Cellular Therapy position statement.Cytotherapy. 2006; 8: 315-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12492) Google Scholar). Therefore, our studies demonstrate that EMT in NHEKs is associated with the acquisition of stem characteristics, whether it is triggered by overexpression of ΔNp63α or knockdown of all p63 isoforms. We coined the term “induced mesenchymal stem cells” to describe epithelial cells that have acquired multipotency through EMT to distinguish them from endogenous MSCs or induced pluripotent stem cells, which acquire embryonic stem cell characteristics after stable transduction of the reprogramming factors (29Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors.Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18970) Google Scholar). These induced mesenchymal stem cells may be derived from cultured primary epithelial cells from skin via transient transfection of p63 siRNA and may have tissue engineering potential for cases requiring an autologous cell transplantation approach. This study reveals GRHL2 as the regulatory partner of p63, which is critical for epithelial cell identity and embryonic morphogenesis (30Barbareschi M. Pecciarini L. Cangi M.G. Macrì E. Rizzo A. Viale G. Doglioni C. p63, a p53 homologue, is a selective nuclear marker of myoepithelial cells of the human breast.Am. J. Surg.

GRHL2 is a transcription factor responsible for regulating epithelial proliferation (12Chen W. Xiao Liu Z. Oh J.E. Shin K.H. Kim R.H. Jiang M. Park N.H. Kang M.K.

This study shows that EMT in NHEK/ΔNp63α and NHEK/Si-p63 cells accompanied down-regulation of GRHL2 and E-Cad and up-regulation of ZEB1 and N-Cad expression (Fig. 6A). GRHL2 has also been shown to suppress EMT in breast cancer cells by suppressing ZEB1 signaling, and a reciprocal feedback loop has been found between GRHL2 and ZEB1 in regulating EMT (25Cieply B. Riley 4th, P. Pifer P.M. Widmeyer J. Addison J.B. Ivanov A.V. Denvir J. Frisch S.M.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumor suppression are controlled by a reciprocal feedback loop between ZEB1 and Grainyhead-like-2.Cancer Res. 2013; 73: 6299-6309Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Furthermore, GRHL2 has been found to inhibit ZEB1 expression and EMT by activating miR-200b and miR-200c (32Cieply B. Farris J. Denvir J. Ford H.L. Frisch S.M. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumor suppression are controlled by a reciprocal feedback loop between ZEB1 and Grainyhead-like-2.Cancer Res. 2013; 73: 6299-6309Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We found that NHEK/ΔNp63α and NHEK/Si-p63 resulted in down-regulation of miR-200 family gene expression, including miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-141, and miR-429 (Fig. 6B) and that p63 binds directly to the promoter of miR-200 family genes (Fig. 6C). It is important to note that p63 did not bind to the promoter of miR-141 and that miR-141 may be bound and regulated by a downstream target of p63. Therefore, p63 modulation may alter miR-200 family gene activation and induce EMT by facilitating up-regulation of ZEB1 expression. These findings indicate a novel role for p63 in the GRHL2-mediated regulation of EMT. In addition, GRHL2 was found to be required and necessary for the expression of p63. In NHOFs, NHOKs and SCC9 cells, GRHL2 overexpression led to a notable increase in the p63 expression level. Also, GRHL2 knockdown in SCC4 cells abolished the expression of p63, suggesting p63 regulation by GRHL2. This was confirmed by ChIP analyses showing direct GRHL2 binding on the p63 gene promoter and concordant alteration of the histone mark at the gene promoter. We also demonstrated, through a Dual-Luciferase reporter assay, that GRHL2 is required for p63 promoter activity and vice versa. Therefore, we propose a model in which p63 and GRHL2 regulate the expression of each other through direct promoter binding, and this reciprocal regulatory loop between GRHL2 and p63 is critical for maintaining the epithelial phenotype through transcriptional regulation of their target genes (Fig. 9). This model may provide a framework to study the molecular mechanism that regulates epithelial plasticity, a key player in physiologic and disease processes, including cancer metastasis, epithelial wound healing, and tissue damage response to environmental insults.

As a consequence, DNA hypomethylating agents, such as 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (decitabine), have been developed for targeted therapy in different cancers (16Blum W. Garzon R. Klisovic R.B. Schwind S. Walker A. Geyer S. Liu S. Havelange V. Becker H. Schaaf L. Mickle J. Devine H. Kefauver C. Devine S.M. Chan K.K. Heerema N.A. Bloomfield C.D. Grever M.R. Byrd J.C. Villalona-Calero M. Croce C.M.

Oncol. 2013; 3: 188Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Decitabine is a deoxycytidine analog that induces a covalent entrapment of DNMT1 to decitabine-substituted DNA leading to a significant loss of maintenance DNMT activity followed by a reduction of DNA methylation (18Jüttermann R. Li E. Jaenisch R. Toxicity of 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine to mammalian cells is mediated primarily by covalent trapping of DNA methyltransferase rather than DNA demethylation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Another mechanism underlying decitabine-induced DNA hypomethylation likely involves ubiquitin-dependent DNMT1 degradation. Regardless, the therapeutic effects of decitabine are limited in against cancers, like NSCLC, because decitabine displays cell cycle-dependent activity (20Müller C.I. Rüter B. Koeffler H.P. Lübbert M. DNA hypermethylation of myeloid cells, a novel therapeutic target in MDS and AML.Curr. Pharm. Biotechnol. 2006; 7: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar); thus quiescent/slow proliferating lung tumor cell subpopulations could escape from decitabine-induced cell killing. Further, it is reported that the genomic DNA becomes remethylated in patients at the end of decitabine therapy, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are transmembrane proteins translating extracellular signals into active intracellular cues. Under physiological conditions, these receptors are activated only by ligand binding. In cancers, such ligand-dependent activation can be bypassed because of RTK overexpression or activating mutations. In particular, RTK overexpression increases the dynamics of homo/heterodimerization without ligand (21Wang R. Kobayashi R. Bishop J.M.

However, PKC412 failed to achieve long term therapeutic efficacy, and resistant mechanisms against PKC412 occurred even from the very beginning of treatment. The molecular processes underlying the onset of chemoresistance are believed to be the acquired mutations, but kinase gene overamplification could be essential in developing drug resistance (33Liu S.

In the present study, we have generated drug-resistant cells by chronic exposure of lung cancer cells to decitabine or PKC412 in vitro. Compared with parental cells, both decitabineR and PKC412R exhibited a higher proliferation rate in vitro and stronger tumorigenicity in xenograft models when the inhibitor treatment was discontinued. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the enhanced proliferative potential in both decitabineR and PKC412R was ascribed to the reactivated kinase signaling and a DNA hypermethylation profile. Our findings offer mechanistic insight into decitabine and PKC412 resistance, and they illustrate how reciprocal application of inhibitors for DNMT1 and KIT oncogenic pathways may improve the anticancer responses of decitabine and PKC412, and potentially, other types of DNA methylation and RTK inhibitors in lung cancer therapy. H1975 and A549 cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS (Life Technologies) at 37 °C under 5% CO2. For the drug treatment, cells were treated with the following reagents used at concentrations, times, and schedules indicated under “Results.” PKC412 (Midostaurin) was obtained from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA), and decitabine (5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine or Dacogen) was from Sigma-Aldrich. H1975 and A549 cells were cultured continuously with a stepwise increase of decitabine or PKC412 concentrations for 6 weeks. Parental cells were cultured in parallel without decitabine or PKC412 and served as control. Resistant cells were maintained in medium containing 0.5 μm of decitabine or PKC412. 1 × 106 cells were seeded into 6-well plates overnight before transfection. ON-TARGETplus Smart pool siRNAs containing a mixture of four oligonucleotides against KIT, DNMT1, and Sp1, as well as the scramble oligonucleotides were obtained from Dharmacon (Thermo Scientific).

In this first-of-its-kind study, we used adoptive transfer of T-cell receptor transgenic OT-II CD4 T cells to track an in vivo antigen-specific immune response that was induced during the course of spaceflight. Experimental mice destined for spaceflight and mice that remained on the ground received transferred OT-II cells and cognate peptide stimulation with ovalbumin (OVA) 323-339 plus the inflammatory adjuvant, monophosphoryl lipid A. Control mice in both flight and ground cohorts received monophosphoryl lipid A alone without additional OVA stimulation. Numbers of OT-II cells in flight mice treated with OVA were significantly increased by 2-fold compared with ground mice treated with OVA, suggesting that tolerance induction was impaired by spaceflight. Production of proinflammatory cytokines were significantly increased in flight compared with ground mice, including a 5-fold increase in IFN-γ and a 10-fold increase in IL-17. This study is the first to show that immune tolerance may be impaired in spaceflight, leading to excessive inflammatory responses."

https://openalex.org/W1528468185,"The transcription factors glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1), a primary marker of Hedgehog pathway activation, and Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) are aberrantly activated in a wide range of malignancies, including glioma. However, the mechanism of nuclear localization of GLI1 and whether FOXM1 regulates the Hedgehog signaling pathway are poorly understood. Here we found that FOXM1 promotes nuclear import of GLI1 in glioblastoma multiforme cells and thus increases the expression of its target genes. Conversely, knockdown of FOXM1 expression with FOXM1 siRNA abrogated its nuclear import and inhibited the expression of its target genes. Also, genetic deletion of FOXM1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts abolished nuclear localization of GLI1. We observed that FOXM1 directly binds to the importin-7 (IPO7) promoter and increases its promoter activity. IPO7 interacted with GLI1, leading to enhanced nuclear import of GLI1. Depletion of IPO7 by IPO7 siRNA reduced nuclear accumulation of GLI1. In addition, FOXM1 induced nuclear import of GLI1 by promoting IPO7 expression. Moreover, the FOXM1/IPO7/GLI1 axis promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro. Finally, expression of FOXM1 was markedly correlated with that of GLI1 in human glioblastoma specimens. These data suggest that FOXM1 and GLI1 form a positive feedback loop that contributes to glioblastoma development. Furthermore, our study revealed a mechanism that controls nuclear import of GLI1 in glioblastoma multiforme cells. The transcription factors glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1), a primary marker of Hedgehog pathway activation, and Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) are aberrantly activated in a wide range of malignancies, including glioma. However, the mechanism of nuclear localization of GLI1 and whether FOXM1 regulates the Hedgehog signaling pathway are poorly understood.

Jagani Z. Dorsch M. Unraveling the therapeutic potential of the Hedgehog pathway in cancer.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 1410-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Although this pathway is silenced in normal adult mature cells, it is aberrantly activated in a wide range of malignancies, including glioma (2Ng J.M. Curran T. The Hedgehog's tale: developing strategies for targeting cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2011; 11: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 3Rubin L.L. de Sauvage F.J. Targeting the Hedgehog pathway in cancer.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 1026-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). The central components of the mammalian Hh pathway include three secreted ligands (Sonic hedgehog, Indian hedgehog, and Desert hedgehog), a negative regulatory receptor (PTCH), a positive regulatory protein (SMO), and the glioma-associated oncogene transcription factors (glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1), GLI2, and GLI3) (4Varjosalo M. Taipale J. Hedgehog: functions and mechanisms.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2454-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). In particular, the zinc finger transcription factor GLI1 is the primary marker of Hh pathway activation. Without Hh ligands, PTCH inhibits the activity of SMO to keep it from transmitting the Hh signal. Upon ligand binding, this inhibition of SMO by PTCH is relieved, and the Hh signal is activated. Activated SMO orchestrates a signaling cascade that eventually results in activation and release of the glioma-associated oncogene transcription factors from a protein complex (2Ng J.M. Curran T.

Activated glioma-associated oncogenes translocate into the nucleus to regulate the expression of various context-specific genes. However, the mechanism of the nuclear localization of GLI1 is poorly understood.

Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) is a member of the Forkhead family of transcription factors (5Alvarez-Fernández M. Medema R.H. Novel functions of FoxM1: from molecular mechanisms to cancer therapy.Front Oncol. 2013; 3: 30Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Many studies have demonstrated that FOXM1 is involved in different aspects of tumorigenesis, including angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis (6Kalin T.V. Ustiyan V. Kalinichenko V.V. Multiple faces of FoxM1 transcription factor: lessons from transgenic mouse models.Cell Cycle. 2011; 10: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 7Li Y. Zhang S. Huang S. FoxM1: a potential drug target for glioma.Future Oncol. 2012; 8: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). FOXM1 is often overexpressed in various human malignancies. For example, high expression of FOXM1 in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) correlates with tumorigenicity of the GBM cells (8Liu M. Dai B. Kang S.H. Ban K. Huang F.J. Lang F.F. Aldape K.D. Xie T.X. Pelloski C.E. Xie K. Sawaya R. Huang S. FoxM1B is overexpressed in human glioblastomas and critically regulates the tumorigenicity of glioma cells.Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 3593-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Authors have reported FOXM1 to be a downstream target of GLI1 in the Hh pathway that contributes to tumorigenesis (9Teh M.T. Wong S.T. Neill G.W. Ghali L.R. Philpott M.P. Quinn A.G. FOXM1 is a downstream target of Gli1 in basal cell carcinomas.Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4773-4780PubMed Google Scholar). However, how FOXM1 regulates the Hh signaling pathway remains unknown. Given that both FOXM1 and GLI1 are activated in many cancers, including glioma, we investigated the potential relationship between these two key transcriptional factors in GBM cases. We found that FOXM1 is essential for nuclear import of GLI1 by promoting importin-7 (IPO7) expression. We also demonstrated that IPO7 binds to GLI1 and thus leads to enhanced nuclear import of GLI1. These data suggest that FOXM1 and GLI1 form a positive feedback loop that contributes to GBM development. Additionally, this study revealed a mechanism that controls nuclear import of GLI1 in GBM cells. FOXM1 knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts and HEK 293T human kidney, Hs683 glioma, SW1783 anaplastic astrocytoma, HFU251 glioblastoma, and U87 glioblastoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). HEK 293T cells were transfected with FuGENE HD (Roche Applied Science). FOXM1 knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts and Hs683, HFU251, and U87 cells were transfected with X-tremeGENE HP (Roche Applied Science). HFU251 and U87 cells were transfected with siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). Human FOXM1 and FOXM1 mutants were generated via PCR and using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Expression vectors encoding FLAG-GLI1 were obtained from Dr. Mien-Chie Hung (The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). The IPO7 human promoter reporter was obtained from Dr. Moshe Oren (Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel) (10Golomb L. Bublik D.R. Wilder S. Nevo R. Kiss V. Grabusic K. Volarevic S. Oren M.

Human IPO7 (plasmid 26682) was obtained from Addgene (Cambridge, MA). SMARTpool siRNA duplexes specific for FOXM1, IPO7, and a nontargeting siRNA (siControl) were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Leptomycin B (LMB) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. An anti-FLAG tag antibody (F1804; 1:1000 immunoblot (IB), 2-μg immunoprecipitation (IP)) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The GLI1 antibody (2553; 1:1000 IB) was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). The following antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA): FOXM1 (sc-500; 1:1000 IB), IPO7 (sc-55235; 1:1000 IB, 2-μg IP), GLI1 (sc-20687; 1:100 immunofluorescence, 1:100 immunohistochemistry), lamin B (sc-6216; 1:1000 IB), normal mouse IgG (sc-2025; 2 μg-IP), and β-actin (sc-47778; 1:10,000 IB). The following antibodies were obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, UK): FOXM1 (ab83097; 1:100 immunohistochemistry), IPO8 (ab72109; 1:1000 IB), IPO9 (ab52605; 1:1000 IB), and IPO13 (ab95993; 1:1000 IB). Cells were harvested, and nuclear protein fractions were separated using a CelLytic nuclear extraction kit (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's recommended procedures. For co-IP, cells were grown in 10-cm dishes and transfected with the appropriate plasmids. Cell lysates were incubated with 2 μg of antibody on a rotator overnight at 4 °C. Protein-antibody-protein A/G-agarose complexes were prepared by adding 50 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing with radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer, immunoprecipitated complexes were resuspended in a reducing sample buffer and boiled for 10 min. After centrifugation to pellet the agarose beads, supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE and IB analysis as described previously (11Xue J. Chen Y. Wu Y. Wang Z. Zhou A. Zhang S. Lin K. Aldape K. Majumder S. Lu Z. Huang S. Tumour suppressor TRIM33 targets nuclear β-catenin degradation.Nat. Commun. 2015; 66156Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Cells were rinsed twice with PBS, fixed with 4% buffered paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min. Cells were then incubated with a primary antibody overnight at 4 °C and then with a secondary antibody conjugated to FITC (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then examined using a deconvolutional microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) as described previously (11Xue J. Chen Y. Wu Y. Wang Z. Zhou A. Zhang S. Lin K. Aldape K. Majumder S. Lu Z. Huang S. Tumour suppressor TRIM33 targets nuclear β-catenin degradation.Nat. Commun. 2015; 66156Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis was performed using total RNA and SYBR Green reagent with an ABI Prism 7000HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA). The sequences of the PCR primers were as follows: Ptch1 forward, 5′-AATGGGTCCACGACAAAGCCGACTA-3′; Ptch1 reverse, 5′-TCCCGCAAGCCGTTGAGGTAGAAAG-3′; Ptch2 forward, 5′-TCTTTCTGGGACTGTTGGCCTTTGG-3′; Ptch2 reverse, 5′-CCTCCCCCAGCTTCTCCTTGGTGTA-3′; CCND2 forward, 5′-CTGTGTGCCACCGACTTTAAGTT-3′; CCND2 reverse, 5′-GATGGCTGCTCCCACACTTC-3′; IL-6 forward, 5′-AGACAGCCACTCACCTCTTCAG-3′; IL-6 reverse, 5′-TTCTGCCAGTGCCTCTTTGCTG-3′; GAPDH forward, 5′-AATCCCATCACCATCTTCCA-3′; and GAPDH reverse, 5′-TGGACTCCACGACGTACTCA-3′. The results were obtained using the comparative Ct method with the housekeeping gene GAPDH as a control. Cells were transfected with the IPO7 human promoter reporter plasmid together with pRL-TK and analyzed as described previously (11Xue J. Chen Y. Wu Y. Wang Z. Zhou A. Zhang S. Lin K. Aldape K. Majumder S. Lu Z. Huang S. Tumour suppressor TRIM33 targets nuclear β-catenin degradation.Nat. Commun. 2015; 66156Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was measured using a Dual-Luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). U87 cells (2 × 106) were prepared for a ChIP assay using a ChIP assay kit (Cell Signaling Technology) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The resulting precipitated DNA specimens were analyzed using PCR to amplify a 215-bp region of the human IPO7 promoter with the primers 5′-ACTCCAAATCTCACCATCCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-ATCACTCTGCCTCTGAAGAG-3′ (reverse), a 147-bp region of the human IPO7 promoter with the primers 5′-TCAACAGGAGGATTACGCCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-AATCCAGGAGGTGGAGCTTG-3′ (reverse), and a 184-bp region of the human IPO7 promoter with the primers 5′-TCCGTGTTATTGCCTTAGGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGAGGCAGGAGAATCGCTTG-3′ (reverse). The PCR products were resolved electrophoretically on a 2% agarose gel and visualized using ethidium bromide staining. For a cell proliferation assay, after transfection, U87 cells (5 × 103) were plated in 96-well plates. Cell growth was assessed using a standard 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. For a colony formation assay, after transfection, cells were trypsinized and reseeded in 6-well plates at a density of 5 × 103 cells per well. For crystal violet staining, plates were washed once each with PBS and cold methanol and then incubated in a crystal violet solution for 5 min. The plates were subsequently washed twice with double-distilled water, air-dried, and scanned using an Epson (Long Beach, CA) scanner. Following transfection, U87 cells were plated overnight to achieve a subconfluent cell layer in 6-well plates. The cell layer was scratched with a micropipette tip, and cultures were washed twice with a serum-free medium to remove floating cells. Wound healing was visualized by comparing photographs of the cell layer taken at 0 and 24 h and processed using the Photoshop CC software program (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). Differences in cell migration distances were determined using a Student's t test for comparing mean values. An invasion assay was carried out in Transwell chambers containing polycarbonate filters (8-μm pore size; BD Biosciences) in which the upper surfaces of the filters in the invasion chambers were coated with a growth factor-reduced Matrigel matrix. Following transfection, U87 cells (5 × 104) in a 500-μl volume of serum-free medium were placed in the upper chambers and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h for the invasion assay. The cells that penetrated through the Matrigel-coated filters were counted at a magnification of ×200 in 15 randomly selected fields, and the mean number of cells per field was recorded. Sections of paraffin-embedded human GBM specimens were stained with antibodies against GLI1 and FOXM1. Immunohistochemical analysis of GBM tissue arrays was performed using a standard immunostaining protocol as described previously (11Xue J. Chen Y. Wu Y. Wang Z. Zhou A. Zhang S. Lin K. Aldape K. Majumder S. Lu Z. Huang S. Tumour suppressor TRIM33 targets nuclear β-catenin degradation.Nat. Commun. 2015; 66156Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The use of human brain tumor specimens was approved by the MD Anderson Institutional Review Board. The significance of the data on the patient specimens was determined using the Pearson correlation coefficient. The significance was determined using the Student's t test (two-tailed). p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. We analyzed the expression of nuclear FOXM1 and GLI1 protein in Hs683, SW1783, HFU251, and U87 cells. We observed markedly higher FOXM1 expression in HFU251 and U87 cells than in Hs683 and SW1783 cells (Fig. 1A). Also, the expression of nuclear GLI1 was positively correlated with the expression of nuclear FOXM1 in these cell lines. Because GLI1 is a nuclear cytoplasmic shuttling protein (12Kogerman P. Grimm T. Kogerman L. Krause D. Undén A.B. Sandstedt B. Toftgård R. Zaphiropoulos P.G. Mammalian suppressor-of-fused modulates nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of Gli-1.Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), we attempted to determine whether FOXM1 modifies the nuclear translocation of GLI1. As nuclear export of GLI1 is dependent on chromosome region maintenance homolog 1 (12Kogerman P. Grimm T. Kogerman L. Krause D. Undén A.B. Sandstedt B. Toftgård R. Zaphiropoulos P.G. Mammalian suppressor-of-fused modulates nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of Gli-1.Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), we examined GLI1 localization in the presence of LMB, a chromosome region maintenance homolog 1-dependent export inhibitor. We found that exposure to LMB increased the nuclear localization of GLI1, which was partially attenuated by knockdown of FOXM1 expression, confirming that FOXM1 is essential for nuclear import of GLI1 (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, deletion of FOXM1 in Foxm1fl/fl mouse embryonic fibroblasts virtually abolished nuclear localization of GLI1 (Fig. 1C), further confirming that FOXM1 is required for nuclear import of GLI1. Next, we induced overexpression of FOXM1 without a DNA-binding domain, the FOXM1 mutant R286A/H287A (which destroys the DNA binding ability of FOXM1), and WT FOXM1 in Hs683 cells. WT FOXM1 increased endogenous nuclear GLI1 levels, whereas the other two proteins did not (Fig. 1D), suggesting that FOXM1 promotes nuclear import of GLI1 in a DNA binding-dependent manner. Conversely, depletion of FOXM1 by siRNA in U87 cells decreased the level of nuclear GLI1 (Fig. 1E). To investigate the changes in mRNA expression of the GLI1 target genes in the presence of FOXM1, we performed quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis of Hs683 cells overexpressing FOXM1. As shown in Fig. 1F, FOXM1 increased the expression of Ptch1, Ptch2, CCND2, and IL-6. In contrast, knockdown of FOXM1 expression decreased the expression of these genes in U87 cells (Fig. 1G). Taken together, these results suggested that FOXM1 promotes nuclear import of GLI1 in a DNA binding-dependent manner. IPO protein plays a key role in moving other proteins into the nucleus (13Powers M.A. Forbes D.J. Cytosolic factors in nuclear transport: what's importin?.Cell. 1994; 79: 931-934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The nuclear import pathway of GLI1 has yet to be fully elucidated. To understand the molecular mechanism of FOXM1 regulation in nuclear import of GLI1, we screened Hs683 cells to determine whether FOXM1 regulated the expression of several IPOs. As shown in Fig. 2A, overexpression of FOXM1 markedly increased IPO7 expression but did not change IPO8, IPO9, or IPO13 expression in Hs683 cells. Next, we analyzed the sequence of the human IPO7 promoter using the FOXM1 consensus sequences. We identified three putative FOXM1-binding sites in the human IPO7 promoter (Fig. 2B). All of the FOXM1-binding regions of the IPO7 promoter bound to endogenous FOXM1 protein in U87 cells in our ChIP assays (Fig. 2C). Moreover, we examined whether FOXM1 transactivates the IPO7 promoter using a human IPO7 promoter luciferase reporter. Overexpressed WT FOXM1 but not FOXM1 without a DNA-binding domain or the FOXM1 mutant R286A/H287A up-regulated IPO7 promoter activity in HEK 293T and Hs683 cells (Fig. 2, D and E). In comparison, IPO7 promoter activity decreased in U87 and HFU251 cells with FOXM1 siRNA (siFOXM1) (Fig. 2, F and G). Collectively, these results indicated that IPO7 is a direct transcriptional target of FOXM1 and that FOXM1 transactivates the IPO7 promoter in a DNA binding-dependent manner. To determine whether nuclear import of GLI1 by IPO7 is mediated by interaction between the two, we performed a co-IP assay. In HEK 293T cells transfected with a FLAG-GLI1 fusion construct, FLAG-GLI1 protein was coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous IPO7 (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, we examined the interaction of endogenous GLI1 and IPO7 at the physiological level. As shown in Fig. 3B, endogenous GLI1 was associated with IPO7 in U87 cells in a co-IP assay. Next, we analyzed the effect of IPO7 knockdown by siRNA on localization of endogenous GLI1 as detected via immunostaining. In contrast with control siRNA, IPO7 siRNA reduced nuclear accumulation of GLI1 (Fig. 3C). Consistent with these results, knockdown of IPO7 expression decreased GLI1 target gene expression according to quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 3D). These results demonstrated that IPO7 is a key nuclear transporter for GLI1 by interacting with GLI1 protein. We examined whether FOXM1 increases nuclear import of GLI1 via up-regulation of IPO7 expression. U87 cells exhibited reduced nuclear accumulation of GLI1 in the presence of siFOXM1, but overexpression of IPO7 rescued nuclear localization of GLI1 in these cells according to immunofluorescent staining (Fig. 4A). Using Western blotting of U87 cells, we found that knockdown of FOXM1 expression resulted in decreased nuclear localization of GLI1, which was abrogated by IPO7 overexpression (Fig. 4B). Moreover, knockdown of FOXM1 expression decreased GLI1 target gene expression, and IPO7 overexpression rescued the inhibitory effect of FOXM1 depletion (Fig. 4C). Taken together, these results demonstrated that FOXM1 induces nuclear import of GLI1 by promoting IPO7 expression. Next, we examined whether the FOXM1/IPO7/GLI1 axis has a role in the proliferation, migration, and invasion of U87 cells. We found that U87 cells with FOXM1 depletion proliferated much more slowly than control cells did. Furthermore, the siFOXM1-transfected U87 cells were much less able to form colonies than were control cells; however, IPO7 and GLI1 overexpression rescued siFOXM1-transfected U87 cell proliferation and increased the number of colonies of these cells (Fig. 5, A and B). We also performed wound healing and Transwell invasion assays to determine whether FOXM1 affects GLI1-mediated cell migration and invasion. The results demonstrated that FOXM1 down-regulation inhibited the migration of U87 cells more than control cells. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of siFOXM1 on the migration of U87 cells was rescued by IPO7 and GLI1 overexpression (Fig. 5C). In addition, knockdown of FOXM1 expression decreased the invasion of U87 cells relative to that of control cells, and expression of IPO7 or GLI1 restored the invasion of these cells (Fig. 5D). Taken together, these results demonstrated that FOXM1 increases IPO7 expression and thus promotes nuclear import of GLI1, which results in increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Finally, to determine whether our findings are clinically relevant, we examined the FOXM1 and GLI1 expression levels in serial sections of 40 human primary GBM specimens via immunohistochemical analysis. The expression of FOXM1 correlated positively with that of GLI1 in the specimens (Fig. 6A). Quantification of staining demonstrated that this correlation was statistically significant in all 40 specimens (r = 0.803; p < 0.001) (Fig. 6B). These results further supported a critical role for FOXM1 in induction of nuclear import of GLI1 in human GBM cells. Our study demonstrated strong evidence supporting a critical role for FOXM1 in regulation of GBM development. We showed that FOXM1 enhances the growth and invasion of human glioma cells via the Hh signaling pathway. Specifically, FOXM1 stimulates transcription of IPO7 by binding directly to its promoter at three sites, which in turn leads to nuclear localization of the transcription factor GLI1, which is the most important indicator of Hh pathway activation. We also found that the level of FOXM1 expression is highly correlated with that of GLI1 expression in human GBM specimens. Because GLI1 may up-regulate FOXM1 expression (9Teh M.T. Wong S.T. Neill G.W. Ghali L.R. Philpott M.P. Quinn A.G. FOXM1 is a downstream target of Gli1 in basal cell carcinomas.Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4773-4780PubMed Google Scholar), the regulatory feedback between FOXM1 and GLI1 in our study may represent a critical mechanism of the proliferation and invasion of human brain tumors (Fig. 6C). FOXM1 is a member of the Forkhead family of transcription factors, whose members promote tumorigenesis and tumor metastasis by activating a series of oncogenes (14Cai Y. Balli D. Ustiyan V.

In the present study, we found that FOXM1 regulated nuclear localization of GLI1 in a DNA binding-dependent manner, a crucial finding suggesting that the transcriptional activity of FOXM1 is necessary for nuclear localization of GLI1. Also, we analyzed the mechanism by which GLI1 may be transported into the nucleus. Specific knockdown of IPO7 expression using siRNA resulted in reduced nuclear accumulation of GLI1, indicating the dependence of nuclear import of GLI1 on IPO7. Previous studies demonstrated that several molecules may affect nuclear localization of GLI1 (22Szczepny A. Wagstaff K.M. Dias M. Gajewska K. Wang C. Davies R.G. Kaur G. Ly-Huynh J. Loveland K.L.

In our study, functional experiments using gain- or loss-of-function studies demonstrated that the FOXM1/IPO7/GLI1 axis promotes GBM cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. A well known characteristic of GLI1 is that it is often overexpressed in human glioma cells (30Infante P. Mori M. Alfonsi R. Ghirga F. Aiello F. Toscano S. Ingallina C. Siler M. Cucchi D. Po A.

We found that FOXM1 expression correlated directly with GLI1 expression in human GBM specimens, further confirming that these two important transcriptional factors have potential clinical relevance. We also discovered that FOXM1 and GLI1 form a novel positive regulatory feedback loop. Such loops are common mechanisms of consecutive activation of factors and signaling pathways in tumor progression. Specifically, we found that FOXM1 activates the Hh pathway by stimulating nuclear localization of GLI1 via up-regulation of IPO7 expression. Moreover, a previous study demonstrated that GLI1 activates FOXM1 expression (13Powers M.A. Forbes D.J. Cytosolic factors in nuclear transport: what's importin?.Cell. 1994; 79: 931-934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Therefore, this regulatory feedback loop made up of FOXM1 and GLI1 maintains consecutive activation of the Hh signaling pathway, which may be a critical mechanism of brain tumor progression. In summary, our findings demonstrated cross-talk between FOXM1 and the Hh signaling pathway in human glioma cells. Because of the great importance of the FOXM1/IPO7/GLI1 axis to development of human cancers, our findings strongly suggest that targeting FOXM1 is a therapeutic strategy for GBM. J.

We show that this structural motif, a minimal Pro314–Trp316 turn, is essential for HCV RNA replication, and its disruption alters the subcellular distribution of NS5A. We demonstrate that this Pro-Trp turn is required for proper interaction with the host cyclophilin A and influences its peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity on residue Pro314 of NS5A-D2.

It thereby constitutes a serious global health challenge, because infection can lead to severe liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (1Gravitz L. A smouldering public-health crisis.Nature. 2011; 474: S2-S4Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The HCV genome encodes for 10 mature proteins: the structural proteins Core, E1, and E2; the viroporin p7; and the nonstructural (NS) proteins NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B. NS proteins are involved in polyprotein processing and viral genome replication (2Moradpour D. Penin F. Rice C.M. Replication of hepatitis C virus.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Because of increased molecular knowledge about the HCV life cycle, the treatment of HCV infection has been largely improved in recent years, with the approval of efficient direct acting antivirals targeting the viral protease NS3/4A, the RNA polymerase NS5B, and the NS5A protein (3Bartenschlager R.

Future HCV regimens will most probably include a combination of direct acting antivirals and/or host-targeted antivirals to treat all HCV genotypes and to increase the genetic barrier to resistance mutations (6Lange C.M.

IDRs indeed can establish numerous interactions (thereby acting as hub proteins), can cope with high mutation rates (caused by error-prone RNA-polymerases), can evade host immune system, and can adapt to different environments (inside and outside the cell). Whereas it is now well recognized that IDPs/IDRs are functional despite the lack of three-dimensional fold, the identification of the features that carry the function(s) remains challenging (34Uversky V.N.

Current knowledge of IDPs/IDRs features is still limited and must be improved to decipher their multiple functionalities.

This motif, a Pro314–Trp316 turn denoted PW turn, pre-exists in the isolated protein domain prior to binding to any potential target. Using NMR spectroscopy, we determined the structure of this PW turn, which explains the sequence conservation in this region, as well as the absolute requirement for these peculiar residues in the RNA replication process. We show that this NS5A-D2 PW turn is directly involved in the binding of host CypA (27Hanoulle X. Badillo A. Wieruszeski J.M. Verdegem D. Landrieu I. Bartenschlager R. Penin F. Lippens G.

To produce 15N- or 15N,13C-labeled NS5A-D2 (WT o I315G) the cells were grown at 37 °C in a M9-based semi-rich medium (M9 medium supplemented with [15N]-NH4Cl (1 g/liter), d-[13C6]-glucose (2 g/liter) (for 13C labeling only), Isogro [15N], or [13C,15N] powder growth medium (1 g/liter, 10%; Sigma-Aldrich). At an A600 nm of 0.8, the protein production was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 h postinduction. Following cell lysis and subsequent removal of cell debris by centrifugation, the resulting supernatant was heated at 75 °C for 15 min and then cooled down on ice. Precipitated material was removed by centrifugation. The clarified supernatant, which contains soluble NS5A-D2, was submitted to Ni2+ affinity chromatography (HisTrap column, 1 ml; GE Healthcare Europe). Following SDS-PAGE analysis, selected fractions containing NS5A-D2 were pooled and dialyzed against 30 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 6.8, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm THP (Tris(hydroxypropyl)phosphine), 2 mm EDTA. The protein was concentrated up to 200–400 μm using a Vivaspin 15 concentrator (cutoff, 5 kDa) (Satorius Stedim Biotech, Aubagne, France), filtered at 0.2 μ, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was estimated based on UV absorbance at A280 nm. The production and purification of both unlabeled and 15N-labeled CypA were performed as previously described in Hanoulle et al. (27Hanoulle X. Badillo A. Wieruszeski J.M. Verdegem D. Landrieu I. Bartenschlager R. Penin F. Lippens G. Hepatitis C virus NS5A protein is a substrate for the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity of cyclophilins A and B.J. Biol.

Unlabeled synthetic peptides, PepD2-WT (KFPRAMPIWARPDYNPPLLE) and PepD2-I315G (KFPRAMPGWARPDYNPPLLE), corresponding to residues 308–327 of NS5A-D2 Con1 were obtained from GenCust (Luxembourg). The purity was checked by reverse phase HPLC and mass spectrometry as >95%. 15N,13C-labeled PepD2-WT and PepD2-I315G peptides were produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) using a modified pET32a expression vector (Novagen). Briefly, the peptides were each produced at the C terminus of a fusion protein harboring a N-terminal histidine tag, the thioredoxin protein, and a linker containing both a thrombin (LVPRGS) and a chemical (DP) cleavage sites. Recombinant bacteria were grown in [15N,13C]-M9-based semi-rich medium (see above), and protein production was induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Following cells lysis, the fusion protein was first purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography (HisTrap column, 1 ml; GE Healthcare Europe) and dialyzed against buffer 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 200 mm NaCl. The acid-sensitive Asp-Pro cleavage site was cleaved by the addition of 0.1% TFA and heating at 75 °C for 4.5 h, thereby releasing the peptide of interest from the fusion protein. The cleavage was checked by SDS-PAGE analysis. After pH neutralization, the His-TrxA moiety was then removed from the peptide sample by incubation with Ni2+-loaded chelating Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) and filtration (0.2 μ). The clarified sample was acidified with 0.1% TFA and loaded on a preparative C18 reverse phase column (Zorbax 300SB C18 9.4/250; Agilent). The purified 15N,13C-labeled peptide was eluted using an acetonitrile gradient and then analyzed by mass spectrometry. Following lyophilization, the peptide was dissolved in 30 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 6.8, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm THP, 2 mm EDTA. The resulting 15N,13C-labeled PepD2 and PepD2-I315G peptides thus contain an extra N-terminal proline residue resulting from the DP chemical cleavage site. The NS5A-D2 sequence (residues 248–341) from HCV Con1 strain (AJ238799; genotype 1b) is numbered as in the full-length NS5A protein. The amino acid repertoire was deduced from the ClustalW multiple alignments of 28 representative NS5A sequences from all confirmed HCV genotypes and subtypes (see the European HCV Database (38Combet C.

Amino acids observed at a given position in less than two distinct sequences are not included. The degree of amino acid conservation at each position can be inferred from the extent of variability (with the observed amino acid listed in decreasing order of frequency from top to bottom) together with the similarity index according to ClustalW convention (asterisk, invariant; colon, highly similar; dot, similar). Spectra were acquired at 298 K on either a Bruker Avance 600 MHz or a Bruker 900 MHz NMR spectrometer, both equipped with a cryogenic triple resonance probe (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany). The proton chemical shifts were referenced using the methyl signal of sodium 3-trimethylsillyl-[2,2,3,3-d4]propionate at 0 ppm. Spectra were processed and analyzed with the Bruker TopSpin software package 2.1. Assignments of NS5A-D2 Con1 (WT) backbone resonances were achieved using the product plane method (40Verdegem D. Dijkstra K. Hanoulle X. Lippens G. Graphical interpretation of Boolean operators for protein NMR assignments.J. Biomol. NMR. 2008; 42: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) with two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC and three-dimensional 1H,15N,13C HNCO, HNCACO, HNCACB, HNCOCACB, and HNCANNH spectra acquired at 600 MHz on a 180 μm 15N,13C-labeled NS5A-D2 Con1 sample at 298 K. NMR data (assignments and structural constraints) corresponding to the peptide PepD2-WT (residues 308–327) were acquired as three data sets. The two first sets, which contain 1H-1H TOCSY, 1H-1H NOESY, 1H-15N HSQC, and 1H-13C HMQC spectra at 600 MHz and 1H-13C HMQC, 1H-13C HMQC-TOCSY, and 1H-13C HMQC-NOESY spectra at 900 MHz, were acquired on the unlabeled peptide at natural abundance. The last data set was acquired on a uniformly 15N,13C-labeled peptide and comprises 1H-15N HSQC and three-dimensional HNCACB, HN(CO)CACB, HNCO, and HNHA sequences. On the mutant peptide PepD2-I315G (residues 308–327), two data sets were recorded at 600 MHz. The first one, acquired on unlabeled peptide, contains 1H-1H TOCSY, 1H-1H NOESY, and 1H-13C-HMQC spectra, whereas the second one was acquired on a uniformly 15N,13C-labeled peptide and comprises 1H-15N HSQC and three-dimensional HNCACB, HNCO, and HNHA spectra. From the different NMR data sets acquired both on unlabeled and 15N,13C-labeled peptide PepD2-WT (residues 308–327, Con1), distance-based (NOEs) and backbone dihedral angle-based experimental restraints were derived. NOE intensities used as input for structure calculations were obtained from the NOESY spectrum recorded with a 400-ms mixing time. NOEs were partitioned into three categories of intensity that were converted into distances ranging from a common lower limit of 1.8 Å to upper limits of 2.8, 3.9, and 5.0 Å, respectively. Protons without stereospecific assignments were treated as pseudoatoms, and correction factors were added to the upper distance constraints (41Wüthrich K. NMR of proteins and nucleic acids. The George Fisher Baker Non-resident Lectureship in Chemistry at Cornell University, Wiley, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Additionally dihedral angle constraints calculated with Talos (42Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. Protein backbone angle restraints from searching a database for chemical shift and sequence homology.J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar) from 1H, 15N, and 13C chemical shifts were introduced. Three-dimensional structures were generated from NOE distances and dihedral angles with the standard torsion angle molecular dynamics protocol in the XPLOR-NIH 2.30 program (43Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Marius Clore G. Using Xplor: NIH for NMR molecular structure determination.Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 2006; 48: 47-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (619) Google Scholar) using the standard force field and default parameter set. A set of 50 structures was initially calculated to widely sample the conformational space, and the structures with no distance restraint violations were retained. The 28 final selected structures were compared by pairwise root mean square deviation over the backbone atom coordinates (N, Cα, and C′). Statistical analyses, superimposition of structures, and structural analyses were performed with MOLMOL (44Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. MOLMOL: a program for display and analysis of macromolecular structures.J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6487) Google Scholar) and the PDB Validation Server. Ramachandran analysis performed on the 28 final structures (560 residues with 364 non-glycine and non-proline residues) showed that 51.9, 44.2, 1.4, and 2.5% of the residues were in most favored, allowed, generously allowed, and disallowed regions, respectively. The PyMOL software (PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, version 1.5.0.4; Schrödinger) was used for molecular graphics. To detect the CypA-catalyzed PPIase activity directly on proline resonances, we used a proline-directed zz-exchange experiment. Briefly, the pulse sequence corresponds to a two-dimensional 1H,15N-Hα(Cα)N experiment with an additional CαZ·NZ magnetization transfer period (150 ms). During this period, the magnetization (along the z-axis) can transfer between the 1Hα-15N resonances corresponding to the different conformers (trans, cis) of a given proline residue. This method has the advantage of detecting a PPIase activity directly on proline resonances and not on resonances from neighboring residues, thus avoiding the possibility of misinterpreting exchange signals in proline-rich regions.

We found that inactivation of SsTGase significantly reduced the virulence of Ss2 in a pig infection model and impaired its antiphagocytosis in human blood. We further solved the crystal structure of the N-terminal portion of the protein in homodimer form at 2.1 Å.

However, genetic studies and sequence analyses revealed that this protein was a transmembrane protein with a single transmembrane segment at the C terminus, suggesting that this protein was released into culture supernatant. Moreover, a highly conserved eukaryotic-like transglutaminase (TGase) 5The abbreviations used are: TGasetransglutaminaseSs2S. suis serotype 2FTGfish-derived transglutaminasePMNpolymorphonuclear leukocyteNTDN-terminal domainCTDC-terminal TGase-like domain. domain (residues 247–348) was found at the N terminus. The TGase domain belongs to the TGase-like superfamily (PF01841 in the PFAM database) (11Punta M. Coggill P.C. Eberhardt R.Y. Mistry J. Tate J. Boursnell C. Pang N. Forslund K. Ceric G. Clements J.

Therefore, we named this protein as SsTGase in Ss2. TGases, also named protein-glutamine γ-glutamyltransferase, constitute a large superfamily of enzymes widely distributed in eukaryotes and prokaryotes and have been extensively studied because they were first extracted from animal liver (12Folk J.E.

Previous studies have mainly focused on the biochemical characteristics of TGases in mammals, but the roles of TGases played in microorganisms remain largely unknown. Among microorganisms, only TGases from Streptoverticillium mobaraense (microbial TGase) and Phytophthora have been studied, and they represent a completely different structure fold compared with those in mammals (27Kashiwagi T. Yokoyama K. Ishikawa K. Ono K. Ejima D. Matsui H. Suzuki E. Crystal structure of microbial transglutaminase from Streptoverticillium mobaraense.J. Biol.

Therefore, bacterial TGases of the PF01841 superfamily are currently largely unknown for their structural features and specific activities. In the present study, we showed that the SsTGase was secreted by Ss2 and developed strong antiphagocytic activity. Inactivation of SsTGase significantly reduced virulence in a pig infection model and impaired antiphagocytic resistance of Ss2 in human blood. To further investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of SsTGase in Ss2, we determined the crystal structure of the N-terminal portion of SsTGase (residues 38–437; referred to as SsTGase-N hereafter) that also included the TGase domain at 2.1 Å. The structure reveals that although the C-terminal domain of SsTGase-N contains a catalytic core region similar to other TGases its N-terminal domain displays a new structural fold. The overall folding of the SsTGase-N homodimer was novel and different from other known structures of TGases. Inactivation of the protein directly resulted in the loss of its antiphagocytic ability, indicating that antiphagocytic ability of SsTGase-N was dependent on its TGase activity. Furthermore, structure-based mutagenesis and biochemical studies suggested that dimerization of the protein was critical for its activation and antiphagocytic ability. These observations provide a novel insight into the activation mechanism and functions of SsTGase that would be valuable for the development of novel antibiotic strategies targeting SsTGase. The ΔSsTGase mutant was obtained from the 05ZYH33 WT by in-frame deletion of the sstgase gene (SSU05_1815) as described previously (9Pian Y. Gan S. Wang S. Guo J. Wang P. Zheng Y. Cai X. Jiang Y.

Immun. 2012; 80: 2402-2413Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, DNA fragments corresponding to the upstream and downstream regions of the sstgase gene were amplified using primer pairs sstgase KOP1/sstgase KOP2 and sstgase KOP5/sstgase KOP6, respectively (Table 1). The chloramphenicol cassette was amplified from plasmid pSET1 with primers CM-F and CM-R (Table 1). The primer pairs sstgase KOP2/CM-F and CM-R/sstgase KOP5 were designed to be fused as an intact fragment by overlap extension PCR. PCR amplicons were cloned into the temperature-sensitive S. suis-Escherichia coli shuttle vector pSET4s, giving rise to the knock-out vector pSET4s::sstgase. The procedures for the selection of mutants by double crossover were described previously (32Takamatsu D. Osaki M. Sekizaki T. Thermosensitive suicide vectors for gene replacement in Streptococcus suis.Plasmid. 2001; 46: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The resulting mutant strain was verified by PCR using three pairs of primers, sstgase IN1/sstgase IN2, sstgase-F/sstgase-R, and sstgase KOP1/sstgase KOP6 (Table 1), and direct DNA sequencing analysis of the mutation sites using genomic DNA as the template. For complementation assays, a DNA fragment containing the entire sstgase gene and its upstream promoter was amplified using primers CΔsstgase-F and CΔsstgase-R. The amplicon was subsequently cloned into the E. coli-S. suis shuttle vector pAT18 (33Trieu-Cuot P. Carlier C. Poyart-Salmeron C. Courvalin P.

This plasmid was transformed into the ΔSsTGase mutant, and the complemented ΔSsTGase strain was screened on Todd-Hewitt broth agar with selective pressure by erythromycin. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analyses of the CΔSsTGase, 05ZYH33, and ΔSsTGase strains were used to further identify transcription of the gene sstgase in CΔSsTGase.TABLE 1Summary of cloning primers in generation of the mutant strain ΔSsTGase and the complemented strain CΔSsTGasePrimersSequenceaThe underlined bold sequences are the restriction sites.

Open table in a new tab A rabbit SsTGase antibody was generated against recombinant SsTGase-N protein. 05ZYH33, ΔSsTGase, and CΔSsTGase samples were separated on a 12% (v/v) polyacrylamide vertical slab gel with a 5% (v/v) stacking gel. Then the proteins were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (GE Healthcare). The membrane was blocked with 5% skimmed milk followed by incubation with 1:200 diluted preimmune rabbit serum/rabbit anti-SsTGase-N serum at room temperature for 1 h. The membrane was then washed with TBST buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG (heavy + light)-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (1:8000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at room temperature for 1 h. After washing, the membrane was developed in SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Diluted strains of the wild type (05ZYH33), ΔSsTGase, and CΔSsTGase (50 μl; 2 × 104 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml) were added to fresh human blood (450 μl), and the mixtures were rotated at 20 rpm at 37 °C under 5% CO2 after which aliquots were incubated with a final concentration of 0.1% (w/v) saponin on ice for 15 min to lyse cells. Viable bacterial counts were determined by plating diluted samples onto Todd-Hewitt broth agar. The percentage of live bacteria was subsequently calculated as (cfu on plate/cfu in original inoculum) × 100%. After being isolated from heparinized venous blood, PMNs were infected with S. suis serotype 2 at a multiplicity of infection of 1:15 in 50% nonimmune human serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Samples were taken at time points and analyzed immediately. Colonies were counted, and the percentage of surviving bacteria was calculated as follows: (cfuPMN+/cfuPMN−) × 100%. The data are presented as means ± S.D. from three or four separate experiments. To evaluate the effects of deletion of sstgase on the virulence of 05ZYH33, specific pathogen-free piglets (4 weeks old; six piglets/group) were challenged with 05ZYH33, ΔSsTGase, and CΔSsTGase strains and the avirulent strain 1330 (dose of 2 × 108 cfu/piglet), respectively. Survival time, clinical signs, and bacterial loads in blood and tissue samples were recorded for 12 days postinoculation. To have a better understanding of the difference between 05ZYH33 and ΔSsTGase and to reduce the individual differences in infection, groups of four specific pathogen-free piglets were inoculated intravenously with a 1:1 mixture of 05ZYH33/ΔSsTGase (dose of 108 cfu/piglet). When the infected piglets showed typical Ss2 infection symptoms, the capability of 05ZYH33/ΔSsTGase surviving in blood and colonizing the various tissues of piglets was analyzed by plating samples on plates without antibiotics or with chloramphenicol resistance selection. All animal experiments were performed in a biosafety level 3 facility and were approved by the local ethics committee. The healthy donors who provided the blood in this study gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Approval was obtained from the medical ethics committee of the 307 hospital. This research was approved by the ethics committee on Animal Experimentation of the Chinese Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animals Care, including the relevant local animal welfare bodies in China. In addition, the permit number of all animal work was SCXK-(JUN) 2013-008, approved by the animal ethics committee of Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology. All efforts were made to minimize suffering of animals used in this study. TGase (EC 2.3.2.13) activity was assayed by a transglutaminase colorimetric microassay kit (TCM kit, Covalab), which uses immobilized N-carbobenzoxy-Gln-Gly as amine acceptor and biotin-conjugated cadaverine as amine donor. Protein samples were incubated in a 96-well microtiter plate coated with N-carbobenzoxy-Gln-Gly at 37 °C for 15 min with calcium, DTT, and biotinylated cadaverine both in the presence and the absence of EDTA supplied in the kit. The wells were washed three times with phosphate buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20. To assay the formation of cadaverine covalently linked to N-carbobenzoxy-Gln-Gly (γ-glutamyl-cadaverine-biotin) by TGase, the wells were filled with streptavidin-labeled HRP and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Following three washes with phosphate buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20, the wells were filled with HRP substrate/chromogen solution containing H2O2 as the substrate and tetramethylbenzidine as the electron acceptor (chromogen). After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, 50 μl of reaction blocking reagent was added, and the mixture was quantified by measuring A450. As a reference for the TGase activity, the kit includes the purified guinea pig TGase with a specific activity of 0.1 unit/mg. By definition, 1 unit of TGase catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of hydroxamate/min at pH 6.0 at 37 °C using l-glutamic acid γ-monohydroxamate as the standard. For CD spectroscopic analysis, the purified proteins from peak 1 and peak 2 solubilized in buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5 and 200 mm NaCl were concentrated to 1 mg/ml. CD spectroscopy was carried out using an Applied Photophysics Chirascan Plus spectropolarimeter with a 10-mm-path length cell and a bandwidth of 1.0 nm. Spectra were recorded from 260 to 180 nm at an interval of 1 nm and were repeated three times. All resultant spectra were obtained by subtraction of the spectrum of the buffer. The coding sequence of sstgase-N (residues 39–437) was cloned into the pGEX6p-1 vector (Novagen), generating an N-terminal PreScission protease cleavage site following the GST tag that was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Overexpression of SsTGase-N was induced in E. coli BL21(DE3) strain by 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside when the cell density reached an A600 nm of 1.2. After growth for 6 h at 30 °C, the cells were collected, resuspended in buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl), and lysed by sonication. Recombinant GST-tagged protein was purified by glutathione affinity chromatography and gel filtration chromatography with buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 2 mm DTT. Notably, the GST tag of purified homodimer was cleaved off by PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) before gel filtration. The selenomethionine (Se-Met)-substituted SsTGase-N derivative was expressed in E. coli B834 strain, grown in selenomethionine medium (Molecular Dimensions Ltd.), and purified similarly (34Doublié S. Preparation of selenomethionyl proteins for phase determination.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). According to procedures described previously (35Good L. Nazar R.N. An improved thermal cycle for two-step PCR-based targeted mutagenesis.Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 204934 Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), point mutations (C302S, H333S, D348S, T215A, and R311A) of SsTGase-N were generated by two-step PCR and confirmed by DNA sequencing. All the mutants were purified in the same way as wild-type protein. Crystals of SsTGase-N were generated by mixing 1 μl of protein solution with 1 μl of well buffer using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 18 °C. Crystals appeared after 2 weeks in the reservoir solution (0.2 m sodium chloride, 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.2, 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000). The crystals were cryoprotected in reservoir solution plus 15–20% (v/v) glycerol and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to data collection. All the data were collected at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility BL17U beamline and integrated and scaled using the HKL2000 package (36Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of x-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38523) Google Scholar). Further processing was carried out using programs from the CCP4 suite (37Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4The CCP4 suite: programs for protein crystallography.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19747) Google Scholar). Data collection statistics are summarized in Table 2. The selenium sites were located using SHELXD from Bijvoet differences in the selenium single wavelength anomalous diffraction data (38Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Substructure solution with SHELXD.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). Heavy atom positions were defined, and the phases were calculated with the single wavelength anomalous diffraction experimental phasing module of Phaser (39McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D.

The real space constraints were applied to the electron density map in density modification. The final model rebuilding was performed with Coot (40Emsley P. Cowtan K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

To investigate the specific roles of the protein, we constructed a mutant strain (ΔSsTGase) and a complemented strain (CΔSsTGase) derived from wild-type strain 05ZYH33 (WT). First, we identified that SsTGase was secreted by Ss2 through Western blotting despite the fact it contained a predicted transmembrane segment (Fig. 1, A and B). This secreted form was possibly produced through proteolysis of the full-length protein during biological processes. The results from the PMN killing assay suggested that the survival rates of the ΔSsTGase strain were much lower than those of the WT and CΔSsTGase strains by 1–3 h (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, to investigate the antiphagocytic activity of SsTGase, we carried out a blood survival assay with the culture supernatant of the WT, CΔSsTGase, and ΔSsTGase strains. The results showed that culture supernatant of WT and CΔSsTGase, but not that of ΔSsTGase, improved the survival rates of the three strains of Ss2 (WT, ΔSsTGase, and CΔSsTGase) in human blood (Fig. 2A). In addition, the survival rate of the ΔSsTGase strain was also improved significantly after incubating the strain with different amounts of SsTGase-N (residues 39–437) protein in human blood (Fig. 2B), which suggested that both SsTGase and SsTGase-N possessed significant antiphagocytic activity.FIGURE 2.SsTGase was a new virulence factor of Ss2. A, SsTGase developed strong antiphagocytic ability. The culture supernatant (Sup) of the WT and CΔSsTGase strains markedly enhanced Ss2 survival in human blood.

https://openalex.org/W1928173106,"The Bardet-Biedl syndrome protein complex (BBSome) is an octameric complex that transports membrane proteins into the primary cilium signaling organelle in eukaryotes and is implicated in human disease. Here we have analyzed the 99-kDa human BBS9 protein, one of the eight BBSome components. The protein is composed of four structured domains, including a β-stranded N-terminal domain. The 1.8 A crystal structure of the 46-kDa N-terminal domain reveals a seven-bladed β-propeller. A structure-based homology search suggests that it functions in protein-protein interactions. We show that the Bardet-Biedl syndrome-causing G141R mutation in BBS9 likely results in misfolding of the β-propeller. Although the C-terminal half of BBS9 dimerizes in solution, the N-terminal domain only does so in the crystal lattice. This C-terminal dimerization interface might be important for the assembly of the BBSome."
https://openalex.org/W1533236969,"Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is an important cytokine for the immunomodulatory effects of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Using murine immune cells, we previously reported that the RNA of Enterococcus faecalis EC-12, a LAB strain exerting probiotic-like beneficial effects, is the major IL-12-inducing immunogenic component. However, it was recently revealed that bacterial RNA can be a ligand for Toll-like receptor (TLR) 13, which is only expressed in mice. Because TLR13 is not expressed in humans, the immuno-stimulatory and -modulatory effects of LAB RNA in human cells should be augmented excluding TLR13 contribution. In experiment 1 of this study, the role of LAB RNA in IL-12 induction in human immune cells was studied using three LAB strains, E.faecalis EC-12, Lactobacillus gasseri JCM5344, and Bifidobacterium breve JCM1192. RNase A treatment of heat-killed LAB significantly decreased the IL-12 production of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells on stimulation, while RNase III treatment revealed virtually no effects. Further, IL-12 production against heat-killed E. faecalis EC-12 was abolished by depleting monocytes. These results demonstrated that single stranded RNA (ssRNA) of LAB is a strong inducer of IL-12 production from human monocytes. In experiment 2, major receptor for ssRNA of E. faecalis EC-12 was identified using THP-1 cells, a human monocytic cell line. The type of RNA molecules of E. faecalis EC-12 responsible for IL-12 induction was also identified. IL-12 production induced by the total RNA of E. faecalis EC-12 was significantly reduced by the treatment of siRNA for TLR8 but not for TLR7. Furthermore, both 23S and 16S rRNA, but not mRNA, of E. faecalis EC-12 markedly induced IL-12 production from THP-1 cells. These results suggested that the recognition of ssRNA of E. faecalis EC-12 was mediated by TLR8 and that rRNA was the RNA molecule that exhibited IL-12-inducing ability in human cells."

Members of the Hha family contribute to gene silencing by binding to the N-terminal dimerization domain of H-NS and modifying its selectivity. Hha-like proteins and the H-NS N-terminal domain are unusually rich in charged residues, and their interaction is mostly electrostatic-driven but, nonetheless, highly selective. The NMR-based structural model of the complex between Hha/YmoA and the H-NS N-terminal dimerization domain reveals that the origin of the selectivity is the formation of a three-protein charge zipper with interdigitated complementary charged residues from Hha and the two units of the H-NS dimer. The free form of YmoA shows collective microsecond-millisecond dynamics that can by measured by NMR relaxation dispersion experiments and shows a linear dependence with the salt concentration. The number of residues sensing the collective dynamics and the population of the minor form increased in the presence of H-NS.

In the first group, 162 patients with DTC received total thyroidectomy, and then 131I therapy. The second group consisted of 84 patients with benign thyroid nodules, who received partial thyroidectomy. The third group was 78 normal healthy control cases. PSQI was used to assess the sleep quality. Inter-group differences were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis test or independent samples T test. χ2 test was also used to check prevalence differences of poor sleep quality among the groups. Differences of PSQI score and poor sleep quality prevalence before and after 131I therapy in the same group of DTC participants were analyzed by paired T test and Mcnemar's test.Higher PSQI score (7.59 ± 4.21) and higher rate of poor sleep quality (54.32%) were shown in DTC patients than in any other group. After 131I therapy, PSQI score and prevalence of poor sleep quality in DTC patients increased significantly to 8.78 ± 4.72 and 70.99%. Then DTC patients were divided into two subgroups based on their metastatic status. DTC patients with metastasis (87/162 cases, 53.70%) had significantly higher PSQI score (10.87 ± 5.18) and higher prevalence of poor sleep quality (79.31%).DTC patients suffer from sleep disturbance, 131I therapy and awareness of metastatic status could worsen sleep problem. Psychological fear of cancer, nuclear medicine therapy and metastasis could be one major underlying reason. Longitude and interventional studies are necessary for further investigations."

Open table in a new tab In contrast to the thorough understanding of its biosynthesis, the enzymology and biological relevance of WTA degradation have not been well studied. Evidence of such enzymatic activity was first reported more than 40 years ago by Wise and co-workers (12Wise Jr., E.M. Glickman R.S. Teimer E. Teichoic acid hydrolase activity in soil bacteria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1972; 69: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), with the discovery that B. subtilis is capable of utilizing its cell wall as a phosphate source. This was attributed to expression of a so-called teichoicase with glycerophosphodiesterase activity specific for WTA. It was later speculated that the expression of this enzyme may be induced by phosphate starvation (13Grant W.D. Cell wall teichoic acid as a reserve phosphate source in Bacillus subtilis.J. Bacteriol. 1979; 137: 35-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), enabling the procurement of necessary phosphate from WTA. In line with this, during phosphate-limited growth of B. subtilis, much of the WTA in the cell wall is replaced by the phosphate-free polymer teichuronic acid (14Lang W.K. Glassey K. Archibald A.R. Influence of phosphate supply on teichoic acid and teichuronic acid content of Bacillus subtilis cell walls.J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 367-375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Soldo B. Lazarevic V. Pagni M. Karamata D. Teichuronic acid operon of Bacillus subtilis 168.Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 795-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Apart from the potential importance in the phosphate starvation response, a role for WTA degradation in the regulation of cell wall structure and composition can be envisioned. For instance, WTAs have been shown to direct bacterial peptidoglycan hydrolases (16Park J.T. Uehara T.

Also, as much as 50% of the wall is recycled during bacterial cell division (20Mauck J. Chan L. Glaser L. Turnover of the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria.J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1820-1827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Glaser L. Lindsay B. Relation between cell wall turnover and cell growth in Bacillus subtilis.J. Bacteriol. 1977; 130: 610-619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), implying a need perhaps for enzymes capable of processing the very large quantities of WTA in peptidoglycan. Through activity-guided purification, Kusser and Fielder (22Kusser W. Fiedler F. Purification, Mr-value and subunit structure of a teichoic acid hydrolase from Bacillus subtilis.FEBS Lett. 1982; 149: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 23Kusser W. Fiedler F. Teichoicase from Bacillus subtilis Marburg.J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 302-310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) achieved some enrichment of the wall teichoicase activity from B. subtilis and later from Bacillus pumilus (24Kusser W. Fiedler F. A novel glycerophosphodiesterase from Bacillus pumilus.FEBS Lett. 1984; 166: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), yet these studies were limited in two important aspects. First, the enzyme preparations were never linked to a gene or protein sequence. Second, the substrates used were poorly defined, consisting of crude cell wall preparations or partially purified WTAs. Thus, bacterial teichoicases remain obscure, as are the mechanistic details of their biochemical activity. Although bacterial enzymes that degrade WTA and their corresponding genes have yet to be identified in any bacterium, the GP12 protein produced by the B. subtilis bacteriophage ϕ29 is thought to possess this activity. GP12 is an appendage protein found in the neck region of ϕ29 that is involved in host cell recognition and entry (25Xiang Y. Morais M.C. Battisti A.J. Grimes S. Jardine P.J. Anderson D.L. Rossmann M.G. Structural changes of bacteriophage ϕ29 upon DNA packaging and release.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5229-5239Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). During phage maturation, GP12 forms homotrimers that undergo autoproteolysis mediated by an intramolecular chaperone domain (26Schulz E.C. Ficner R. Knitting and snipping: chaperones in β-helix folding.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2011; 21: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), prior to forming the 12 appendages attached to the neck of phage particles (25Xiang Y. Morais M.C. Battisti A.J. Grimes S. Jardine P.J. Anderson D.L. Rossmann M.G. Structural changes of bacteriophage ϕ29 upon DNA packaging and release.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5229-5239Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 27Xiang Y.

Cell. 2009; 34: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As part of a crystallographic investigation of this large (92 kDa) multifunctional protein, Xiang et al. (27Xiang Y. Leiman P.G. Li L. Grimes S. Anderson D.L. Rossmann M.G. Crystallographic insights into the autocatalytic assembly mechanism of a bacteriophage tail spike.Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) showed that GP12 could drastically reduce the apparent molecular size of poly(glycerol phosphate) WTA extracted from B. subtilis 168, suggesting that the protein has inherent wall teichoicase activity. The activity was noted to be highly dependent on divalent metal ions, two of which (Ca2+ and Mg2+) were observed bound at the proposed WTA-degrading active site in a pectin lyase domain (28Jones P. Binns D. Chang H.-Y. Fraser M. Li W. McAnulla C. McWilliam H. Maslen J. Mitchell A. Nuka G. Pesseat S. Quinn A.F. Sangrador-Vegas A. Scheremetjew M. Yong S.-Y. Lopez R. Hunter S. InterProScan 5: genome-scale protein function classification.Bioinformatics. 2014; 30: 1236-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (3853) Google Scholar), prompting the suggestion of a two-metal ion mechanism for catalysis of WTA phosphodiester bond hydrolysis (27Xiang Y. Leiman P.G. Li L. Grimes S. Anderson D.L. Rossmann M.G. Crystallographic insights into the autocatalytic assembly mechanism of a bacteriophage tail spike.Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Analogous mechanisms for phosphate ester hydrolysis involving a bimetallated active center are known for enzymes from the binuclear metallophosphatase family, which includes glycerophosphodiesterases and purple acid phosphatases (29Schenk G. Mitić N. Gahan L.R. Ollis D.L. McGeary R.P. Guddat L.W. Binuclear metallohydrolases: complex mechanistic strategies for a simple chemical reaction.Acc. Chem. Res. 2012; 45: 1593-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and interestingly, GP12 is structurally unrelated to this family. In light of the previous qualitative examination, GP12 represents an ideal candidate for the study of enzyme-catalyzed WTA degradation. To that end, we have performed in-depth investigations on this prototypic wall teichoicase (GP12) using chemically defined and soluble WTA substrate analogs. Indeed, the study of WTA biosynthetic enzymes has been greatly enabled by chemoenzymatic syntheses of analogs for the biosynthetic intermediates. In place of the 55-carbon undecaprenyl chain, such analogs feature a more tractable lipid moiety that facilitates manipulation in aqueous systems (8Allison S.E. D'Elia M.A. Arar S.

Moreover, soluble poly(glycerol phosphate) polymer is accessible through the polymerization of glycerol phosphate onto CDP-glycerol (34Schertzer J.W. Brown E.D. Use of CDP-glycerol as an alternate acceptor for the teichoic acid polymerase reveals that membrane association regulates polymer length.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 6940-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Equipped with chemically defined substrates, we developed HPLC-based assays for poly(glycerol phosphate) hydrolysis that were used to meticulously characterize the wall teichoicase activity of GP12. We found that polymer glycosylation led to an enhanced rate of polymer degradation, and also appeared to influence the mode of GP12 action. Further interrogation of GP12 catalytic activity suggested that the enzyme utilizes phosphodiesterase and phosphomonoesterase activity in its reaction with WTA polymers.

The amplicon was cloned into pET28b plasmid using NcoI and HindIII restriction sites to generate pΔN88GP12. Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL transformed with pΔN88GP12 was grown at 25 °C in Luria Bertani (LB) media supplemented with 20 μg/ml of chloramphenicol and 50 μg/ml of kanamycin to an A600 of 0.6 before inducing protein expression with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. Expression was continued for 20 h at 16 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (8500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C) and washed with 0.85% NaCl, prior to resuspension in a buffer containing Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 25 mm imidazole. EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Diagnostics, Laval, Québec, Canada) was added to the suspension and the cells were lysed by two consecutive passages through a cell disruptor (Constant Systems, Daventry, Northants, UK) at 30,000 p.s.i. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation (40,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C) prior to loading on a 1-ml HisTrapHP column (GE Life Sciences) pre-equilibrated with resuspension buffer. GP12 was eluted over a 25 to 400 mm imidazole gradient, and fractions containing pure protein were pooled and the buffer exchanged for 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 15% glycerol (v/v), using a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column (GE Life Sciences). Protein concentration was determined according to the method of Gill and von Hippel (36Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Calculation of protein extinction coefficients from amino acid sequence data.Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5048) Google Scholar). Lipid α, β, and ϕ.1 analogs were synthesized as described previously (30Ginsberg C. Zhang Y.-H. Yuan Y. Walker S.

[14C]ManNAc-labeled lipid β analog (1 mm stock solution; 20 mCi/mmol) was synthesized by including 20 mCi of UDP-N-acetyl-d-[1-U-14C]glucosamine in the reaction. 1.2 μCi of [14C]ManNAc lipid β was then used to prepare [14C]ManNAc lipid ϕ.1 analog (0.3 mm stock solution; 20 mCi/mmol). Reaction progress was assessed from substrate consumption (monitoring absorbance at 261 nm for uridine containing reagents and at 271 nm for cytidine containing reagents) by reversed phase HPLC using a Waters HPLC system (Waters 1525 HPLC pump and 2998 PDA detector; Waters, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), or by scintillation counting with an in-line 150TR Flow Scintillation Analyzer (PerkinElmer). Upon reaction completion, enzymes were removed using a centrifugal filter with a 10,000 Da molecular mass cut-off (Pall Life Sciences, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). The chemoenzymatic approach for the preparation of soluble tricecyl-linked WTA analogs is summarized in Scheme 1. Lipid ϕ.40 analog was synthesized using TagF according to established methods, with the lipid ϕ.1 analog and CDP-glycerol as the glycerol phosphate acceptor and donor, respectively (32Pereira M.P. Schertzer J.W. D'Elia M.A. Koteva K.P. Hughes D.W. Wright G.D. Brown E.D.

To incorporate 14C into the glycerol phosphate polymer chain, 0.91 μCi of CDP-[U-14C]glycerol (98.7 mCi/mmol) was included in the reaction and the analogswere prepared at 91 mCi/mmol. [14C]ManNAc lipid ϕ.40 analog was similarly prepared at 20 mCi/mmol, by the inclusion of 0.2 μCi of [14C]ManNAc lipid ϕ.1 analog to the reaction. Reaction progress was monitored by anion exchange HPLC using a DNA PAC PA200 anion exchange column (Thermo Fisher Scientific), with visualization by in-line scintillation counting. The solvents used were: A, 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) containing 10% acetonitrile (v/v) and B, 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) containing 1 m NaCl and 10% acetonitrile (v/v). Substrates and products were separated over the following gradient condition for solvent B: 0–30% (3 min), 30–45% (10 min), 45–100% (5 min), and finally 100% for 5 min. Upon reaction completion, enzymes and low molecular weight by-products were removed using centrifugal filters with molecular mass cut-offs of 30,000 and 3000 Da, respectively (Pall Life Sciences). Polymer glycosylation reactions were performed as described previously (8Allison S.E. D'Elia M.A. Arar S. Monteiro M.A. Brown E.D.

The progress of glycosylation reactions was assessed by anion exchange HPLC using chromatographic conditions identical to those for the non-glycosylated analog, or by UDP-glucose consumption with ion-paired reversed phase HPLC (8Allison S.E.

Unless otherwise stated, GP12 reactions with WTA analogs were performed at room temperature in a buffer comprised of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 30 mm MgCl2. Reactions were initiated by addition of GP12 and terminated at specified time points by the addition of urea to a final concentration of 6 m. Radioactive reaction products were separated by anion exchange HPLC as described above. Initial rate analyses for GP12 degradation of 14C-labeled WTA analogs were performed with varying concentrations of GP12 and fixed amounts of WTA substrate. The amount of fully polymeric starting substrate remaining after specific time points was quantified by peak integration. Reactions (30 μl) between GP12 and non-radioactive lipid ϕ.40 analogs were quenched with an equal volume of methanol, and product mixtures were analyzed by normal phase liquid chromatography ESI-QTOF mass spectrometry, as described previously (37Bulat E. Garrett T.A. Putative N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine synthase from Arabidopsis thaliana is a lysoglycerophospholipid acyltransferase.J. Biol.

The catalytic activity of GP12 with pNPP or bis-pNPP was assayed by monitoring the production of para-nitrophenol (pNP). Unless otherwise stated, reactions (100 μl) were performed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 30 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm CaCl2. After initiation with GP12, the absorbance at 400 nm was measured continuously on a SpectraMax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). pNP generated was quantified by interpolation to a standard curve. Assays for the determination of kinetic parameters contained substrate concentrations ranging between 40.0 and 0.625 mm for pNPP, and from 28.50 to 0.44 mm for bis-pNPP. Initial rates of pNP production (substrate consumption <10%) were plotted as a function of substrate concentration and the data fit by non-linear regression (Prism 6.0; GraphPad, La Jolla, CA) to Equation 1.

The ERCC1 point mutation F231L, located at the hydrophobic interaction interface of ERCC1 (excision repair cross-complementation group 1) and XPF (xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group F), leads to severe NER pathway deficiencies. Here, we analyze biophysical properties and report the NMR structure of the complex of the C-terminal tandem helix-hairpin-helix domains of ERCC1-XPF that contains this mutation. The structures of wild type and the F231L mutant are very similar. The F231L mutation results in only a small disturbance of the ERCC1-XPF interface, where, in contrast to Phe231, Leu231 lacks interactions stabilizing the ERCC1-XPF complex. One of the two anchor points is severely distorted, and this results in a more dynamic complex, causing reduced stability and an increased dissociation rate of the mutant complex as compared with wild type. These data provide a biophysical explanation for the severe NER deficiencies caused by this mutation."

It is the third most common cause of death in Germany where it claims 60,000 lives a year (2Engel C. Brunkhorst F.M. Bone H.G. Brunkhorst R. Gerlach H. Grond S. Gruendling M. Huhle G. Jaschinski U.

The inflammatory cascade at the onset of septic shock can be caused by the presence of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is shed from the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (4Buttenschoen K.

We now report binding data and crystal structures of unliganded and liganded antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) for two anti-lipid A mAbs, S1–15 and A6, to elucidate the reason these antibodies do not bind intact LPS. Furthermore, we present a structure of S1–15 in complex with ssDNA fragments that supports the polyspecific potential of anti-lipid A antibodies toward ssDNA. ELISA against the immobilized neoglycoconjugates was performed as described earlier (29Brade L. Engel R. Christ W.J. Rietschel E.T.

For the binding assay, BBP and B4P were conjugated in a 5 m excess to BSA, which had been activated by divinylsulfone, were then immobilized at concentrations of 2.5, 5.0, 10, and 20 pmol of ligand per well, and reacted with mAbs A6 and S1–15, which were titrated 1:1 over 12 steps starting from 2 μg/ml concentration.

For large scale preparation, mAb S1–15 was isolated from ascites by affinity chromatography on BBP conjugated to AH-Sepharose (80 mg of ligand/2.5 ml of packed beads) followed by elution with 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 3.2 (29Brade L. Engel R. Christ W.J. Rietschel E.T. A nonsubstituted primary hydroxyl group in position 6′ of free lipid A is required for binding of lipid A monoclonal antibodies.Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3961-3965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions were adjusted to pH 4 by addition of 1 m NaHCO3. Antibody A6 was isolated and purified in the same manner as S1–15. Fab fragments of each antibody were prepared by digestion of the intact immunoglobulin with papain (Sigma). IgG was dialyzed into 25 mm HEPES (Sigma), pH 7.5, diluted to a concentration of 1.0–0.8 mg/ml, 2 mm EDTA (Sigma), and 5–6 mm DTT (Sigma). The digestion reaction was carried out at room temperature using a papain/IgG ratio of 1:200 molar eq for 2–3 h. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 10 mm iodoacetamide (Sigma) and dialyzed overnight into 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4. Fab fragment was purified by cation-exchange chromatography on a Shodex CM-825 column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) using a linear gradient of 0.0 to 0.5 m NaCl in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Purified Fab was concentrated to 10–12 mg/ml stock and stored at 4.0 °C. The Fabs of A6 and S1–15 mAbs were mixed with 3 mm lipid A backbone bisphosphate: βGlcN4P(1→6)αGlcN1P, designated BBP (28Brade L. Holst O. Brade H. An artificial glycoconjugate containing the bisphosphorylated glucosamine disaccharide backbone of lipid-A binds lipid-A monoclonal antibodies.Infect.

Several crystals (0.25 × 0.35 × 0.30 mm3) were obtained for S1–15 in the presence of BBP after 2 months in a 16 °C room from hanging drop setup in PEG II suite crystal screen (Qiagen, Toronto, Canada), under condition 13 (0.1 m sodium chloride, 0.1 m bicine, pH 9.0, and 30% (w/v) PEG 550 methyl ether) using a 1:1 reservoir-to-protein ratio. Approximately cubic crystals (0.1 × 0.15 × 0.15 mm3) of A6 were grown initially at a hanging drop setup in a 16 °C room in the presence of BBP using Index crystal screen (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA) under condition 44 (0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, and 25% (w/v) PEG 3350) in 1:1 reservoir-to-protein ratio. Larger crystals (0.4 × 0.4 × 0.2 mm3) were obtained using a 1:1.5 reservoir-to-protein ratio. Fresh papain digests of intact S1–15 and A6 were used by applying the protocol as above, for crystallization screening of unliganded Fabs and S1–15 Fab in the presence of oligonucleotides. Conditions were set using an Art Robbins Gryphon Xtallization Robot (San Jose, CA), with each 96-well sitting drop plate incubated in a 16 °C room. S1–15 unliganded crystals (0.4 × 0.3 × 0.25 mm3) were grown under condition 21 (25% (w/v) PEG 2000 MME) of the PEG II suite screen. Initial crystals of variable sizes for unliganded A6 Fab were grown under condition 16 (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and 30% (w/v) PEG 1000) of PEG II suite crystal screen, and subsequently optimized (for diffraction quality) using 35% (w/v) PEG 1000. S1–15 Fab (12 mg/ml) was mixed with the deoxythymidine oligonucleotides of sequence 5′P-TTTTT-3′P (both ends phosphorylated) referred to as p5(dT)p and 5′-TTTTT-3′P (lacking the 5′-phosphate) referred to as 5(dT)p, in a 1:2 molar ratio. Crystals in presence of p5(dT)p oligonucleotides were initially obtained after a few days using the sitting drop method under condition 55 (0.075 m MgCl2, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 28% (v/v) PEG 550 MME) of the index screen (Hampton Research). Larger crystals (0.35 × 0.3 × 0.3 mm3) were obtained via the hanging drop method and using 1:2–1:3 reservoir-to-protein ratios. A large crystal (0.7 × 0.4 × 0.4 mm3) was obtained in presence of 5(dT)p antigen, after a few days under condition 22 (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 25% (v/v) PEG 550 MME) of the PEG suite crystal screen using sitting drop method. Crystallization conditions for S1–15 liganded and unliganded, as well as A6 unliganded structures already contained levels of cryoprotectant suitable to form a glass upon freezing. Liganded A6 crystals were carefully dehydrated in a 16 °C room until the concentration of cryoprotectant (PEG 3350) reached appropriate levels. All crystals were flash-frozen to −160 °C using an Oxford Cryostream 700 crystal cooler (Oxford Cryosystems, Oxford, UK). The x-ray diffraction data sets were collected at the Canadian Macromolecular Crystallography Facility on beamline 08ID-1 of the Canadian Light Source (Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada) at 0.979 Å wavelength, with a Marmosaic CCD300 detector, and processed using HKL2000 (HKL Research Inc., Charlottesville, VA).

Mia40 is the oxidoreductase that inserts two disulfide bonds into the substrate simultaneously. However, Mia40 has one redox-active cysteine pair, resulting in ambiguity about how Mia40 accepts numerous electrons during substrate oxidation. In this study, we have addressed the oxidation of Tim13 in vitro and in organello. Reductants such as glutathione and ascorbate inhibited both the oxidation of the substrate Tim13 in vitro and the import of Tim13 and Cmc1 into isolated mitochondria. In addition, a ternary complex consisting of Erv1, Mia40, and substrate, linked by disulfide bonds, was not detected in vitro. Instead, Mia40 accepted six electrons from substrates, and this fully reduced Mia40 was sensitive to protease, indicative of conformational changes in the structure. Mia40 in mitochondria from the erv1–101 mutant was also trapped in a completely reduced state, demonstrating that Mia40 can accept up to six electrons as substrates are imported. Therefore, these studies support that Mia40 functions as an electron sink to facilitate the insertion of two disulfide bonds into substrates.

The substrate is subsequently released in an oxidized form, leaving reduced Mia40. For additional rounds of import, Mia40 is reoxidized by Erv1 (11Mesecke N. Terziyska N. Kozany C. Baumann F.

Finally, electrons from cytochrome c are donated to Ccp1 or the respiratory chain, and electrons from oxygen yield hydrogen peroxide (22Dabir D.V. Leverich E.P. Kim S.K. Tsai F.D. Hirasawa M.

The midpoint potentials of the reactive cysteine centers in proteins of the disulfide relay are poised to favor the transfer of electrons from the substrate to the terminal electron acceptors (19Tienson H.L.

Cell. 2009; 20: 3481-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The twin CX3C protein Tim13 acquires two disulfide bonds simultaneously when equilibrated in buffers with different redox potentials and has a single midpoint potential of −310 mV (19Tienson H.L. Dabir D.V. Neal S.E. Loo R. Hasson S.A. Boontheung P. Kim S.K. Loo J.A. Koehler C.M. Reconstitution of the Mia40-Erv1 oxidative folding pathway for the small tim proteins.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 3481-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Coordinated insertion of two disulfide bonds requires four electrons to be transferred at one time. However, the mechanism by which Mia40 with its single CPC active site can simultaneously transfer four electrons is not evident; several mechanisms have been suggested. A small molecule such as oxygen or glutathione may insert the second disulfide bond. Oxygen, however, is likely slow and cannot explain how substrate oxidation proceeds under anaerobic conditions (25Banci L. Bertini I. Cefaro C. Cenacchi L. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Felli I.C. Gallo A. Gonnelli L. Luchinat E. Sideris D. Tokatlidis K. Molecular chaperone function of Mia40 triggers consecutive induced folding steps of the substrate in mitochondrial protein import.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 20190-20195Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Glutathione has been shown to increase the efficiency of import into isolated mitochondria and to function in quality control by preventing the formation of partially oxidized intermediates (18Bien M. Longen S. Wagener N. Chwalla I. Herrmann J.M. Riemer J. Mitochondrial disulfide bond formation is driven by intersubunit electron transfer in Erv1 and proofread by glutathione.Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 516-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a ternary complex of the substrate, Mia40, and Erv1 may facilitate substrate oxidation by channeling electrons (26Bourens M. Dabir D.V. Tienson H.L. Sorokina I. Koehler C.M. Barrientos A. Role of twin Cys-Xaa9-Cys motif cysteines in mitochondrial import of the cytochrome C oxidase biogenesis factor Cmc1.J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, as the substrate and Erv1 both transfer electrons through the CPC site of Mia40, the logistics of moving four electrons simultaneously has not been resolved. One potential mechanism is that Mia40 may serve as an electron sink by transferring electrons to the twin CX9C motif, resulting in oxidation of the substrate in one step. Excess Mia40 can oxidize substrates in vitro (18Bien M. Longen S. Wagener N. Chwalla I. Herrmann J.M. Riemer J.

Whereas these studies show that Mia40 is reduced, the specific redox state of Mia40 has not been determined. Here, we report that Mia40 can be fully reduced both in vitro and in mitochondria, indicating that Mia40 has the capacity to serve as an electron sink to collect electrons during the oxidation of imported substrates.

The oxidation of reduced Tim13 (15 μm) was tested in the presence of 5 and 10 mm GSH, 1 μm Erv1, and 1 μm Mia40 (Fig. 1, B, C, and E), using a reconstitution assay with purified recombinant proteins (19Tienson H.L. Dabir D.V. Neal S.E. Loo R. Hasson S.A. Boontheung P. Kim S.K. Loo J.A. Koehler C.M. Reconstitution of the Mia40-Erv1 oxidative folding pathway for the small tim proteins.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 3481-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The oxidation state of Tim13 was monitored by the addition of AMS, which covalently binds to reduced thiols and causes an increase in molecular mass of 500 daltons per addition; up to four AMS molecules can add to reduced Tim13. A set of Tim13 standards was included to calibrate the gel system (Fig. 1, A, lanes 1–6, and B, lanes 1–4). Reduced wild-type (WT) Tim13 was left untreated (−AMS) or treated with AMS (+AMS), resulting in the addition of four AMS molecules (Fig. 1, A, lanes 1 and 4, and B, lanes 1 and 2). Two reduced mutant versions of Tim13 with the 1st and 4th or 2nd and 3rd cysteines changed to serines (Tim13 C1,4S and Tim13 C2,3S, respectively) were left untreated (−AMS) or treated with AMS (+AMS), resulting in the addition of two AMS molecules (Fig. 1A, lanes 2, 3, 5, and 6). Similarly, a reduced mutant version of Tim13 with the 2nd and 4th cysteine residues mutated to serine residues (Tim13 C2,4S) was left untreated (−AMS) or treated with AMS (+AMS), resulting in the addition of two AMS molecules (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4). Mutant Tim13 that had only two AMS additions migrated at an intermediate molecular mass, between Tim13 with zero and four AMS additions, which can be detected in this gel system. In our experimental conditions, we have not identified a state in which Tim13 shows partial oxidation, which is in agreement with a single midpoint potential of −310 mV. However, nonspecific bands that migrated just above the Tim13 band (highlighted by an asterisk in lanes 2 and 4 of Fig. 1B) were sometimes detected; we do not know the specific reason for this band, but it may be an artifact from the polyclonal antibody detecting additional proteins in this molecular mass region. Tim13 was oxidized in ∼1–2 h in the presence of Mia40, Erv1, and oxygen (Fig. 1, B, lanes 10–13, C, lanes 3–6, and E). Analysis of the migration of Tim13 in the 1st h of the time course (i.e. Fig. 1B, lanes 10 and 11) in comparison with the aforementioned Tim13 standards indicated that four AMS molecules added to the reduced Tim13 and an intermediate oxidation state in which Tim13 had only one disulfide bond were not detected. Whereas this time course is long, Tim13 does not spontaneously oxidize (Fig. 1B, lanes 5–7) nor does Mia40 or Erv1 alone (Fig. 1B, lanes 8 and 9) oxidize Tim13. Based on the addition of four AMS molecules simultaneously, Tim13 was oxidized in one step by Mia40 and Erv1; a partially oxidized intermediate was not observed. However, 5 mm GSH addition slowed Tim13 oxidation, with ∼50% of Tim13 oxidized over the 4-h time course (Fig. 1, C, lanes 7–10, and E). Moreover, the addition of 10 mm GSH inhibited Tim13 oxidation, with ∼95% remaining reduced after 4 h (Fig. 1C, lanes 17–20). Based on calibration of the gel system, a Tim13 intermediate that acquired one disulfide bond was not detected (Fig. 1A). We tested whether the general reductant ascorbate acted similarly. Addition of 5 mm ascorbate inhibited Tim13 oxidation by 95% (Fig. 1, D, lanes 6–9, and E). As shown previously, Tim13 was not oxidized spontaneously or by Mia40 or Erv1 (Fig. 1D, lanes 1–5). Under these in vitro conditions, the addition of reductants impaired Tim13 oxidation in the presence of Mia40, Erv1, and oxygen. We subsequently investigated the effect of reductants on the import of Tim13 and the CX9C substrate Cmc1 into isolated mitochondria (34Horn D. Al-Ali H. Barrientos A. Cmc1p is a conserved mitochondrial twin CX9C protein involved in cytochrome c oxidase biogenesis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 4354-4364Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), as described previously (18Bien M. Longen S. Wagener N. Chwalla I. Herrmann J.M. Riemer J. Mitochondrial disulfide bond formation is driven by intersubunit electron transfer in Erv1 and proofread by glutathione.Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 516-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were incubated with 2 and 5 mm GSH or ascorbate for 10 min followed by the addition of the precursor (Fig. 2, A–D). Again, the addition of reductants strongly inhibited Tim13 and Cmc1 import (Fig. 2, A and B), differing from results published by Herrmann and co-workers (18Bien M. Longen S. Wagener N. Chwalla I.

In contrast, GSH and ascorbate addition did not interfere with the import of the TIM23 substrate Su9-DHFR (Fig. 2, C and D). Thus, GSH and ascorbate impair both the in vitro oxidation and in organello import of Mia40 substrates. Another mechanism for oxidation of Mia40-dependent substrates is through the formation of a ternary complex of substrate, Mia40, and Erv1 in which the"
