An earlier communication from this laboratory (1) de- scribed the enzymatic synthesis and isolation of 5’-nucleotides of a number of purine analogues. The present report is con- cerned with the preparation of the polyphosphate nucleosides. This has been accomplished chemically by use of the carbodi- imide procedure (2) and enzymatically with enzymes from beef liver and pork kidney. Most of the studies described below employ the unnatural nucleotide, 8azaguanosine 5’-phosphate."

The product was identified as sedoheptulose phos- phate after sedoheptulose (as sedoheptulosan) was isolated fol- lowing hydrolysis with phosphatase. Its resistance to the ac- 1. 2. 3. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. tion of muscle aldolase strongly suggests a monophosphate ester probably at position 7. Its chemical and physical properties matched those of authentic sedoheptulosan monohydrate. The relative ability of rat tissues to accomplish this transformation is as follows: lung, spleen, kidney, liver, heart, brain, and blood he- molysates. Purine nucleosides were better substrates than pyrimidine nucleosides. Optimal conditions of pH, concentra- tion of substrate, phosphate, and enzyme have been studied. Heavy metals, glyceraldehyde, dihydroxyacetone, iodoacetate, and deoxynucleosides are strong inhibitors of this system. Two striking features of the nucleoside-sedoheptulose mono- phosphate transformation were its dependence and the apparent utilization of only 1 pentose molecule for each mole- cule of sedoheptulose monophosphate formed.
