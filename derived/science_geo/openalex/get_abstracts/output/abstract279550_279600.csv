https://openalex.org/W2072542791,"Novel materials have been obtained by restacking single-layer molybdenum disulfide (MoS(2)) with organic molecules included between the layers. A large variety of organic molecules can be included between layers of MoS(2) and other transition-metal dichalcogenides. The films with the included organics are formed at the interface between an aqueous suspension of the MoS(2) and a water-immiscible organic liquid. The organic molecules are not necessarily electron donors. A highly oriented, conducting film of restacked MoS(2) containing ferrocene is presented as an example."

These faunas have a widespread distribution, and many taxa have pronounced longevity. Among the components appear to be survivors of the preceding Ediacaran assemblages and a suite of bizarre forms that give unexpected insights into morphological diversification. Microevolutionary processes, however, seem adequate to account for this radiation, and the macroevolutionary patterns that set the seal on Phanerozoic life are contingent on random extinctions. They weeded out the morphological spectrum and permitted rediversification among surviving clades. Although the predictability of which clades will play in successive acts of the Phanerozoic theater is low, at least the outlines of the underlying ecological plot are already clear from the opening of the drama."

An associative memory Hamiltonian based on hydrophobicity patterns is shown to have a large capacity for recall and to be capable of recognizing tertiary structure for moderately variant sequences.

Recognized styles of volcanism include large volcanic edifices on the Beta and Eisila rises related to regional structural trends, plains with multiple source vents and a mottled appearance due to the ponding of volcanic flows, and plains with bright features surrounded by extensive quasi-circular radar-dark halos. The high density of volcanic vents in the plains suggests that heat loss by abundant and widely distributed plains volcanism may be more significant than previously recognized. The low density of impact craters greater than 15 km in diameter in this region compared to the average density for the higher northern latitudes suggests that the plains have a younger age."

Urey (1893-1981) on the origin of the moon are discussed in relation to earlier ideas, especially George Howard Darwin's fission hypothesis. Urey's espousal of the idea that the moon had been captured by the earth and has preserved information about the earliest history of the solar system led him to advocate a manned lunar landing. Results from the Apollo missions, in particular the deficiency of siderophile elements in the lunar crust, led him to abandon the capture selenogony and tentatively adopt the fission hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2090461039,"Since the original theoretical insights of Bardeen and Shockley about 40 years ago, the progress of solid-state electronics has been paced by the ability to control chemical bonding structures, particularly at surfaces and interfaces. The functioning of solid-state devices depends on being able to produce interfacial structures with a minimum number of defective chemical bonds. A series of chemical discoveries and insights, on germanium (Ge) and silicon (Si) surfaces and gallium arsenide-aluminum arsenide (GaAs-AlAs) interfaces, has brought the electronics revolution to its present state of development. In most cases, the technological consequences of these accidental discoveries could not be accurately foreseen. With that caution, the technological prognosis for some current research is also reviewed."

He clearly distinguishes what is gener- ally accepted from what is conjectural and controversial, however, and in the process he flags areas needing more research. Ex- perts might question details in their own areas of expertise, but I doubt that many will disagree about the usefulness and impor- tance of this book. KEITH A.

Competition, Predation and Other Interactions JOANNA BURGER, Ed. Columbia University Press, New York, 1989. x, 339 pp., illus. $45. Joanna Burger has assembled an eclectic set of papers that examine a variety of ecological interactions. The value of the book is in its diverse coverage; it is not a tightly integrated collection with a clear theme. Four chapters examine interactions between marine birds and mammals, two the impact of fisheries, and others seabird community structure and the relation be- tween birds, their prey, and predatory fish. An introductory chapter reviews t11e marine biology of seabirds. The strongest focus is on interactions of marine birds and mammals. Pierotti offers useful observations of birds foraging in the vicinity of whales and pinnipeds. He shows that bird attendance varies with the species of mammal, that some whales may use birds as cues to the availability of prey, and that when feeding in association witil whales, herring gulls (Larus argentatus) have a higher success rate in capturing prey than when foraging without cetaceans present. An un- fortunate aspect of the chapter is tile prolif- eration of categories of bird aggregations; the reader must keep in mind up to a possible 20 types. Warheit and Lindberg examine how presumed competition be- tween pinnipeds and marine birds since the Miocene has shaped the evolution of seabird commumaes. Present competition for breeding sites on some islands is docu- mented, but the authors make what seems to be an unwarranted extrapolation that such competition has shaped whole regional avi- faunas. Their data are not convincing, and the authors ignore the possibility that changes in seawater temperarure could have accounted for the loss of fauna! elements. Au and Pitman, expanding on a recent publication, provide an excellent overview of the at-sea ecology of tropical Pacific seabirds and their dependence on tuna for access to prey, a topic also discussed by Hulsman. An interesting finding is the lack of association of seabirds with small dol- phins in the absence of tuna. Au and Pitman suggest that born the birds and tile mam- mals cue on tile tuna for access to prey and that birds ignore dolphins unaccompanied by tuna. Unfonunately, they had to rely on the number of birds present to indicate the presence of tuna, no independent measure of tuna abundance being available, so tile discussion has a degree of circularity. The contribution of Safina and Burger is an expansion of two recently published pa- pers and as such seems disproportionately long at 79 pages. T he authors show that bluefish (Pomatomus saltatris), while compet- ing with terns for prey, also were important in increasing the accessibility of prey. Of particular interest is the result that a non- significant correlation between tern density and prey density found in the early years of their study became significant witil addi- tional sampling in later years. T his result suggests that time as well as spatial scales of measurement are important in identifying the extent to which tile abw1dance of sea- birds reflects tile abundance of prey. Furness, Hudson, and Ensor exanline tile interactions between various species of birds as they compete for offal (discarded portions of commercially valuable fish) and discarded fish (unused whole fish) available from boats fishing near the northern British Isles. They find mat the importance of offal versus discarded fish differs between bird species and hypothesize mat successful dominance for access to offal may have had important consequences for the population size of one or more species o f seabird. They show mat variations in fish year-class size and in fisher- ies regulations can affect the population dynamics of tilese bird species. Jones and DeGange focus on the horrific rates (possi- bly more than half a million birds annually) of seabird mortality in gill nets in the North Pacific. Of particular concern is the loss of breeding adults from the seabird fauna . More careful editing might have reduced some of the problems mentioned above, but in toto tile book is attractively produced and is a worthwhile addition to tile library of those interested in tile ecology and conser- vation of marine birds and mammals. Those seeking examples of interspecific competi- tion and commensualism will also find inter- esting material in this book. G EORGE L. HUNT, JR.
