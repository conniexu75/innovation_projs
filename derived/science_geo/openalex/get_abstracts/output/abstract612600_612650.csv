Pharmacological inhibition of the histone 3 Lys-27 (H3K27) methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) in WT mice enhances osteogenesis and stimulates bone formation. However, conditional genetic loss of Ezh2 early in the mesenchymal lineage (i.e. through excision via Prrx1 promoter–driven Cre) causes skeletal abnormalities due to patterning defects. Here, we addressed the key question of whether Ezh2 controls osteoblastogenesis at later developmental stages beyond patterning. We show that Ezh2 loss in committed pre-osteoblasts by Cre expression via the osterix/Sp7 promoter yields phenotypically normal mice. These Ezh2 conditional knock-out mice (Ezh2 cKO) have normal skull bones, clavicles, and long bones but exhibit increased bone marrow adiposity and reduced male body weight. Remarkably, in vivo Ezh2 loss results in a low trabecular bone phenotype in young mice as measured by micro-computed tomography and histomorphometry. Thus, Ezh2 affects bone formation stage-dependently. We further show that Ezh2 loss in bone marrow–derived mesenchymal cells suppresses osteogenic differentiation and impedes cell cycle progression as reflected by decreased metabolic activity, reduced cell numbers, and changes in cell cycle distribution and in expression of cell cycle markers. RNA-Seq analysis of Ezh2 cKO calvaria revealed that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Cdkn2a is the most prominent cell cycle target of Ezh2. Hence, genetic loss of Ezh2 in mouse pre-osteoblasts inhibits osteogenesis in part by inducing cell cycle changes. Our results suggest that Ezh2 serves a bifunctional role during bone formation by suppressing osteogenic lineage commitment while simultaneously facilitating proliferative expansion of osteoprogenitor cells.

https://openalex.org/W2807753813,"Antigen-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) A plays a major role in host defense against infections in gut mucosal tissue. Follicular helper T (Tfh) cells are located in germinal centers and promote IgA production via interactions with germinal center B cells. Several studies have demonstrated that some lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains activate the host’s acquired immune system, inducing IgA secretion in the intestine. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of LAB on IgA production and Tfh cells are not fully resolved. Lactobacillus paracasei MCC1849 is a probiotic strain isolated from the intestine of a healthy adult. In this study, we investigated the effects of orally administered heat-killed MCC1849 on IgA production in the intestine and on Tfh cell induction in vivo. We found that orally administered MCC1849 induced antigen-specific IgA production in the small intestine, serum and lungs. We also observed that MCC1849 increased the proportion of IgA+ B cells and Tfh cells in Peyer’s patches (PPs). In addition, MCC1849 increased the gene expression of IL-12p40, IL-10, IL-21, STAT4 and Bcl-6 associated with Tfh cell differentiation. These results suggest that orally administered MCC1849 enhances antigen-specific IgA production and likely affects Tfh cell differentiation in PPs."

Fifteen players were allocated into the control (U15C = 9, age: 13.9±0.5 years; U17C = 6, age: 16.1±0.7 years) and the experimental (U15E = 9, age: 14.2±0.8 years; U17E = 6, age: 15.8±0.5 years) groups. The experimental groups participated in 10-weeks of a complementary training program based on differential learning approach to improve physical literacy and players' tactical behavior. Variables studied encompassed: motor (vertical jump, speed and repeated change-of direction), technical (pass, dribble and shot), creative (fluency, attempts, versatility) and positioning-related variables (stretch index, spatial exploration index and regularity of the lateral and longitudinal movements). Results revealed that U15E improved both the jump and repeated change-of-direction performance, while the U17E have only improved the jump performance. The U15E showed improvements in all technical variables (small to large effects), and in the fluency and versatility (moderate effects), while the U17 have only improved the successful shots (large effects). From a positional perspective, there was a moderate increase in the stretch index, and decreased longitudinal and lateral regularity (small to moderate effects) in the U15E compared to the U15C. In turn, the U17E revealed a moderate increase of the spatial exploration index and a small decrease in the stretch index. Overall, the results suggest that the complementary training program was effective for the development of the overall performance of the U15E attackers, while more time and/or variability may be needed for older age groups. Nevertheless, the overall higher values found in experimental groups, may suggest that this type of complementary training program improves performance."

Between May 2014 and July 2016, 412 patients >18 years-old consecutively admitted to the ICU of a university hospital were included. LQTS was defined as a QT interval on the admission electrocardiogram corrected using Bazett's formula (QTc) >460 ms for men and >470 ms for women. All medications administered within 24 hours before admission were recorded. Logistic regression was used.LQTS prevalence was 27.9%. In LQTS patients, 70.4% had ≥ 1 LQTS-inducing drug prescribed in the 24 hours prior to ICU admission versus 70.4% in non-LQTS patients (p = 0.99). Bradycardia and Charlson morbidity index score are independent risk factors for LQTS. Haloperidol (OR 4.416), amiodarone (OR 2.509) and furosemide (OR 1.895) were associated with LQTS, as well as another drug not yet described, namely clopidogrel (OR 2.241).The LQTS is highly prevalent in critically ill patients, ICU patients are often admitted with LQTS-inducing medications, and patients with slow heart rate or with high Charlson comorbidity index should be evaluated for LQTS."
https://openalex.org/W2807739614,"This study aimed to identify lifestyle factors associated with cognitive change and to explore whether the effect of lifestyle varies by socioeconomic status (SES). Participants aged 65 years and older were recruited from elderly health checkup programs from 2011 to 2013 in Taiwan. Neuropsychological tests, including tests of global cognition, logical memory, executive function, verbal fluency and attention, were administered at baseline (N = 603) and 2 years later (N = 509). After literature review, 9 lifestyle factors and 3 SES indicators were chosen and their effects on cognitive change were evaluated using linear regression adjusting for age, sex, education, APOE ε4 status, and baseline cognitive score. Five lifestyle factors (high vegetable and fish intake, regular exercise, not smoking, and light to moderate alcohol consumption) and 3 SES indicators [annual household income (> 33,333 USD vs. less), occupational complexity (high vs. low mental demanding job), and years of education (> 12 years vs. less)] were found to be protective against cognitive decline (P < 0.1 in any cognitive domains, ß ranging from 0.06 to 0.38). After further adjusting for all the lifestyle and SES factors, fish intake, higher income and occupational complexity remained protective. Significant interactions were found between a healthful lifestyle (defined as having ≥ 3 healthful lifestyle factors) and income on changes of global cognition and verbal fluency (Pinteraction = 0.02 and 0.04). The protective effect of a healthful lifestyle was observed only among participants with lower income in global cognition and logical memory [ß = 0.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.07–0.26; ß = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.14–0.46]. To the best of our knowledge, this study for the first time explored how the interactions of lifestyle and SES affect cognitive change. Our findings will aid in developing dementia prevention programs and reduce health inequalities."
https://openalex.org/W2807860058,"There is little consensus on the amount of worldwide food waste generation because many current estimates are indirect and link back to the same limited primary datasets, with much of the data originating from fieldwork undertaken in the 1970s and 1980s. Direct measurement of waste streams, through waste composition studies, can be used to develop accurate estimates of food waste disposal. In Ontario, Canada, municipalities that undertake household waste composition studies all use a common direct measurement methodology that includes a broad range of waste categories, including food waste. The purpose of this research was to estimate the quantity of food waste disposed, in the garbage stream, by households in southern Ontario, Canada, and determine if this common methodology could be expanded and serve as the basis of a standardized and rigorous household food waste measurement methodology. Household waste composition study data (2012–2015), including a single “food waste” category, were gathered from 9 Ontario municipalities, aggregated and analyzed to develop estimates of food waste in the garbage stream. On average, households disposed 2.40 kg/week of food waste in the garbage, which comprised 35.4% of this waste stream. This does not include any food waste otherwise disposed (e.g., sink) or recycled (e.g., composted). Urban households disposed significantly greater amounts of food waste compared to rural households in the spring (p = 0.01) and summer (p = 0.02). Households with access to a green bin program disposed significantly less food waste than those with no access to a green bin program in the spring (p = 0.03) and summer (p<0.01). The common methodology used to develop these estimates shows promise as the basis of a household food waste measurement methodology. This future methodology would include dividing food waste into avoidable and unavoidable food waste categories, as well as adding subcategories (e.g., avoidable fruits and vegetables)."
https://openalex.org/W2808350658,"Financial status is thought to be an important determinant of psychological well-being. We investigate this relationship, and the effect of other factors, using a parametric mixed modelling approach for panel data, controlling the problem of unobservable heterogeneity. Two nationally representative surveys, the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) and the Understanding Society Survey (USS), were used to construct a unified data set which measured psychological well-being and associated factors using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). The GHQ-12 score for the head of the household was used as the dependant variable and its relationship with multiple independent demographic and financial status variables was investigated. Following assessment of growth curve characteristics with linear, curvilinear and higher-order polynomial modelling; several variance-covariance structures were tested to assess the error covariance structure of the longitudinal data. The random intercept and random slope were allowed to vary across participants, and methods such as natural splines and B-splines were used to improve the fit of some variables. Our final model demonstrated the most important variables affecting self-reported psychological well-being, as determined by GHQ-12, were perception and expectation of future financial situation and problems meeting household expenditure. Gender, age, marital status, number of children at home, highest qualification and job status were also significantly implicated. Unlike previous studies however we did not find that size of income was significant. These results provide further strong evidence of the impact that financial concerns have on self-reported measures of psychological well-being."
https://openalex.org/W2808487038,"Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is among the most prevalent of the adult-onset muscular dystrophies. FSHD causes a loss of muscle mass and function, resulting in severe debilitation and reduction in quality of life. Currently, only the symptoms of FSHD can be treated, and such treatments have minimal benefit. The available options are not curative, and none of the treatments address the underlying cause of FSHD. The genetic, epigenetic, and molecular mechanisms triggering FSHD are now quite well-understood, and it has been shown that expression of the transcriptional regulator double homeobox 4 (DUX4) is necessary for disease onset and is largely thought to be the causative factor in FSHD. Therefore, we sought to identify compounds suppressing DUX4 expression in a phenotypic screen using FSHD patient–derived muscle cells, a zinc finger and SCAN domain–containing 4 (ZSCAN4)-based reporter gene assay for measuring DUX4 activity, and ∼3,000 small molecules. This effort identified molecules that reduce DUX4 gene expression and hence DUX4 activity. Among those, β2-adrenergic receptor agonists and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, both leading to increased cellular cAMP, effectively decreased DUX4 expression by >75% in cells from individuals with FSHD. Of note, we found that cAMP production reduces DUX4 expression through a protein kinase A–dependent mode of action in FSHD patient myotubes. These findings increase our understanding of how DUX4 expression is regulated in FSHD and point to potential areas of therapeutic intervention.

https://openalex.org/W2808678463,"Macrophages are essential for innate immunity and inflammatory responses and differentiate into various functional phenotypes. Tribbles homolog 1 (Trib1), a member of the mammalian Tribbles homolog pseudokinase family, has been implicated in regulation of cell differentiation, proliferation, and metabolism, but its role in macrophage biology has not been fully elucidated. Here, we investigated the consequences of Trib1 deficiency on macrophage functions and M1/M2 polarization. Bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDMs) from Trib1-deficient (Trib1−/−) mice exhibited elevated phagocytic capacity, correlating with up-regulation of several scavenger receptors. Concomitantly, uptake of modified low-density lipoprotein was increased in Trib1−/− BMDMs. Trib1−/− macrophages also exhibited diminished migration in the presence of the chemokine MCP-1, associated with reduced expression of the MCP-1 receptor Ccr2. Furthermore, Trib1 deficiency attenuated the response of BMDMs to both M1 and M2 stimuli; induction of the M1-marker genes Il6, Il1b, and Nos2 upon LPS/IFNγ stimulation and of the M2-marker genes Cd206, Fizz1, and Arg1 upon IL-4 stimulation was reduced. Functionally, Trib1 deficiency decreased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNFα, IL-1β, and CXCL1) and reduced nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species production in M1-polarized macrophages. Supporting the attenuated M2 phenotype, IL-4–stimulated Trib1−/− macrophages secreted less IL-10 and TGFβ. Mechanistically, Trib1−/− BMDMs displayed lower levels of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), resulting in reduced activation of LPS/IFNγ-mediated STAT1 signaling. Likewise, decreased levels of JAK1 along with lower activation of STAT6 and STAT3 were observed in M2-polarized Trib1−/− BMDMs. Our findings suggest that Trib1 extensively controls macrophage M1/M2 polarization via the JAK/STAT signaling pathway.

Macrophages are an essential part of innate immunity, inflammatory response, and tissue modulation and remodeling. It is well-established that macrophages possess a remarkable plasticity (1.Mosser D.M. Edwards J.P. Exploring the full spectrum of macrophage activation.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8 (19029990): 958-96910.1038/nri2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (6233) Google Scholar). Depending on the microenvironment, macrophages can transform into different functional phenotypes with classically activated (M1) macrophages and alternatively activated (M2) macrophages representing the extremes of the phenotypic spectrum (2.Sica A. Mantovani A. Macrophage plasticity and polarization: in vivo veritas.J. Clin. Invest. 2012; 122 (22378047): 787-79510.1172/JCI59643Crossref PubMed Scopus (3907) Google Scholar). Macrophages are polarized toward the M1 phenotype, when they are exposed to proinflammatory Th1 cytokines (e.g. TNFα, IFNγ) 2The abbreviations used are: TNFtumor necrosis factorBMDMbone marrow–derived macrophageJAKJanus kinaseIFNinterferonLPSlipopolysaccharideNOnitric oxideROSreactive oxygen speciesPPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptorC/EBPCCAAT enhancer-binding proteinFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateLDLlow-density lipoproteinacLDLacetylated LDLMCPmonocytotic chemoattractant proteinTGFtransforming growth factorSOCSsuppressors of cytokine signalingqPCRquantitative PCR. or microbial products like lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Phenotypically, M1 macrophages express high levels of major histocompatibility complex II and produce high levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and NO. Hence, M1 macrophages are efficient in eliminating pathogens, infected cells and tumor cells. In contrast, M2 macrophages are polarized by anti-inflammatory Th2 cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13 and are characterized by high expression of M2 marker genes like the mannose receptor Cd206 and Resistin-like β (Retnlb, Fizz1). M2 macrophages produce anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) and high levels of arginase 1 and functionally facilitate angiogenesis, tissue remodeling, and parasite defense (3.Wang N. Liang H. Zen K.

M1 and M2 polarization of macrophages is regulated by several distinct signaling pathways. M1 polarization is triggered by activation of Toll-like receptor signaling, especially Toll-like receptor 4, by LPS and other microbial ligands, resulting in the activation of the NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (JNK, p38, and ERK1/2) signaling cascades (5.Piras V.

MAP kinases in immune responses.Cell. Mol. Immunol. 2005; 2 (16212907): 20-27PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, IFNγ stimulates the JAK/STAT pathway, resulting in activated STAT1 binding to the promoter regions of the hallmark M1-associated genes Nos2 and Il12 (7.Lawrence T. Natoli G.

On the other hand, macrophages can be driven toward the M2 phenotype by IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13. Binding of IL-4 or IL-13 to IL-4 receptors results in activation and translocation of STAT6 into the nucleus (10.Wills-Karp M. Finkelman F.D.

Instead of direct phosphorylation of target proteins, the three members of the Tribbles family (TRIB1, TRIB2, TRIB3) appear to act as adapter or scaffolding proteins mediating the interaction with signaling molecules and/or protein degradation (16.Eyers P.A.

Mice lacking Trib1 exhibited a reduced number of M2-like macrophages in several organs. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to impaired M2 polarization have not been elucidated in detail, and a putative function of Trib1 in M1 polarization has not been addressed as of now. Here, we investigated whether Trib1 deficiency alters the main macrophage functions. Therefore we analyzed the capability for phagocytosis, migration, and polarization. We report increased phagocytosis and diminished migration in Trib1−/− BMDMs. Furthermore, Trib1−/− BMDMs showed an impaired M1 and M2 polarization phenotype with a reduced activity of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Collectively, our data indicate an important role for Trib1 in controlling both M1 and M2 polarization. We first characterized the consequences of Trib1 deficiency on major macrophage functions. One of the most important functions of macrophages is the uptake and degradation of pathogens by scavenger receptors. To clarify whether the absence of Trib1 influences phagocytosis capacity, we treated WT and Trib1−/− BMDMs with FITC-labeled Escherichia coli particles and determined the engulfed fluorescence. Trib1-deficient macrophages showed a 1.9-fold mean increase of engulfed E. coli particles as compared with WT cells (Fig. 1A). To examine whether the elevated uptake resulted from higher expression of scavenger receptors, we analyzed the expression profile of 10 common scavenger receptors. We found that seven of the tested scavenger receptors (Cd36, Cd68, Srb1, Scarf1, Cxcl16, Stab1, and Marco) were consistently up-regulated in Trib1−/− BMDMs (Fig. 1B). The expression of Sra, Cd163, and Lox1 was not changed (Fig. S1). To further corroborate the functional significance of increased scavenger receptor expression, we analyzed whether uptake of modified low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was also enhanced in Trib1−/− BMDMs. When WT and Trib1−/− BMDMs were incubated with DiI-labeled acetylated LDL (acLDL), uptake of acLDL was significantly increased by 30% in Trib1−/− as compared with WT BMDMs (Fig. 1C). Activation of macrophages induces migration toward a presenting stimulus. To investigate the role of Trib1 in macrophage migration, we performed cell migration assays in a modified Boyden chamber using monocytotic chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) as the most important chemokine for migration regulation. BMDMs from Trib1−/− mice showed no difference under basal conditions compared with the WT control group. The presence of MCP-1 significantly increased the numbers of migrated WT BMDMs by 57%. In contrast, the migration of Trib1−/− BMDMs was attenuated, with an increase of only 33% (Fig. 1D). Concomitantly, we observed a 2.2-fold lower expression of the MCP-1 receptor (Ccr2) in Trib1−/− BMDMs, which could contribute to the impaired migratory response (Fig. 1E). We further analyzed the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory genes in naïve BMDMs. Interestingly, we found lower expression levels of proinflammatory Il6 and Il1b, as well as lower expression levels of anti-inflammatory Cd206 and Arg1 in naïve Trib1−/− BMDMs (Fig. 1F), indicating an influence of Trib1 on basal activation status. To investigate whether Trib1 is regulated in response to M1 and M2 polarizing stimuli, we treated BMDMs from C57/BL6 mice with either LPS/IFNγ (for M1) or IL-4 (for M2) over a time course of up to 24 h and measured Trib1 mRNA expression levels. Trib1 expression was significantly induced under both M1 and M2 polarizing conditions. In M1-stimulated BMDMs, we found the highest induction (10.6-fold) of Trib1 expression after 1 h (Fig. 2A). Likewise, in M2 stimulated BMDMs, we observed a 5.6-fold increase after 1 h (Fig. 2B). Given the significant induction of Trib1 expression in response to M1 and M2 polarization stimuli, we next investigated the consequences of Trib1 deficiency on M1 and M2 polarization. Macrophage activation in response to LPS/IFNγ (M1) or IL-4 (M2) treatment was validated by substantial shifts in gene expression of M1 (Il1b, Nos) and M2 (Arg1, Fizz1) markers between nonpolarized and M1 and M2 polarized BMDMs (Fig. S2). Comparing the M2 polarization status of WT and Trib1−/− BMDMs after stimulation with IL-4 over 48 h, we observed lower expression of all tested M2 signature marker genes (Arg1, Fizz1, Cd206) in Trib1−/− BMDMs (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, gene and protein expression of PPARγ, which is activated during M2 polarization and important for the acquisition and maintenance of the M2 phenotype (14.Chawla A. Control of macrophage activation and function by PPARs.Circ. Res. 2010; 106 (20508200): 1559-156910.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.216523Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 31.Odegaard J.I.

Impaired M2 polarization of Trib1−/− BMDMs was also functionally corroborated by lower secretion of the M2 associated cytokines TGFβ (1.48 ± 0.06 versus 1.19 ± 0.08 pg/ml, WT versus Trib1−/−; Fig. 3B) and IL-10 (6.30 ± 1.21 versus 2.84 ± 0.31, pg/ml, WT versus Trib1−/−; Fig. 3C). To clarify the impact of Trib1 deficiency on M1 polarization, we examined characteristic properties of M1 polarized macrophages in response to LPS/IFNγ stimulation. The expression of M1 marker genes Il6, Il1b, and Nos2 remained significantly lower in Trib1−/− BMDMs as compared with WT controls (Fig. 3D). To ensure that the changes in M1 marker expression were also reflected at a functional level, the secretion of proinflammatory M1 cytokines was quantified. In agreement with the gene expression data, we detected significantly lower levels of TNFα, IL-6, IL-1β, and CXCL1 in the supernatant of Trib1−/− BMDMs (TNFα: 68.2 ± 18.3 versus 14.8 ± 0.9; IL-6: 51.7 ± 1.5 versus 24.7 ± 7.8; IL-1β: 7.3 ± 2.5 versus 1.8 ± 0.2; CXCL1: 22.5 ± 5.5 versus 5.0 ± 0.5; pg/ml, WT versus Trib1−/−; see Fig. 3E). In addition, we verified the effects of Trib1 deficiency to reduce M1 activation by detecting NO production. Production of NO was determined by the accumulation of nitrite (the first stable metabolite of NO) in the supernatant of nonpolarized (M0) and M1 polarized macrophages. Nitrite levels were not detectable in the supernatant of M0 macrophages but were abundantly detectable in M1-stimulated macrophages, reflecting the induction of inducible nitric-oxide synthase enzymatic activity during M1 polarization. In agreement with lower Nos2 mRNA expression (Fig. 3D), nitrite levels were 39% lower in the supernatant of M1 polarized Trib1−/− BMDMs (6.6 ± 0.7 versus 4.0 ± 0.7 μmol/L, WT versus Trib1−/−; Fig. 3F). Likewise, the production of ROS, another hallmark of M1 macrophages, was significantly reduced in M1 stimulated Trib1−/− BMDMs as compared with WT controls (Fig. 3G). Collectively, these data indicate that Trib1 plays an as yet underappreciated function in both M1 and M2 polarization of macrophages. Because Trib1 deficiency impaired response to both LPS/IFNγ– and IL-4–induced polarization, we tested whether increasing concentrations of stimuli could equalize the induction of M1 and M2 polarization markers. However, the blunted response of Trib1−/− macrophages was not dose-dependent and maintained across the entire range of tested concentrations (Fig. S4). These data suggest that Trib1 does not merely alter the activation threshold to M1 and M2 stimuli. To address potential underlying molecular mechanisms leading to impaired macrophage polarization in Trib1−/− BMDMs, we evaluated the activation of major signaling pathways in response to M1 and M2 stimuli. Given the known interaction of Trib1 and C/EBPs, we first reassessed the C/EBP pathway, which has previously been shown to modulate both M1 and M2 polarization of macrophages (32.Lee B. Qiao L. Lu M. Yoo H.S. Cheung W. Mak R. Schaack J. Feng G.-S. Chi N.-W. Olefsky J.M. Shao J. C/EBPα regulates macrophage activation and systemic metabolism.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2014; 306 (24691027): E1144-E115410.1152/ajpendo.00002.2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). C/EBPα was only modestly increased in Trib1−/− BMDMs, whereas C/EBPβ was comparable to WT controls (Fig. S5, A and B). Next, we examined whether Trib1 deficiency alters response to LPS/IFNγ–induced signal transduction: LPS-mediated initiation of M1 polarization activates the MAP kinases p38, ERK1/2, and JNK, as well as the NF-κB cascade. However, Trib1−/− BMDMs did not show differences in the activation of the NF-κB subunit p65 and the MAP kinases p38, ERK1/2, and JNK as compared with controls (Fig. S6, A–D). Furthermore, binding of IFNγ to its receptor activates the JAK/STAT pathway, resulting in the phosphorylation and dimerization of STAT1 molecules, which is crucial for M1 macrophage polarization (7.Lawrence T. Natoli G. Transcriptional regulation of macrophage polarization: enabling diversity with identity.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 11 (22025054): 750-76110.1038/nri3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in response to LPS/IFNγ treatment, Trib1−/− BMDMs exhibited significantly lower levels of phosphorylated STAT1 and a reduced pSTAT1/STAT1 ratio (Fig. 4A). Activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway also promotes M2 macrophage polarization via phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT6 proteins. To investigate STAT signaling under M2 polarizing conditions, Trib1−/− and WT control BMDMs were stimulated with IL-4. We detected a profound reduction of phosphorylated STAT6 and the pSTAT6/STAT6 ratio in Trib1−/− BMDMs (Fig. 4B). Further, Trib1−/− BMDMs also displayed diminished phosphorylation of STAT3 and a reduced pSTAT3/STAT3 ratio as compared with WT controls (Fig. 4C). Collectively, these data strongly suggest that attenuated activation of STAT signaling pathways may underlie the impaired response to both M1 and M2 stimuli in Trib1−/− BMDMs. Given the reduced STAT activation in Trib1−/− BMDMs, we hypothesized that the common upstream regulator JAK may cause the diminished STAT activation. Therefore, we analyzed abundance and activation of the different JAKs according to the polarization status. Under M1 polarizing conditions JAK1 and JAK2 are responsible for transmitting the activation signal to STAT1 molecules (33.Hu X. Ivashkiv L.B. Cross-regulation of signaling pathways by interferon-γ: implications for immune responses and autoimmune diseases.Immunity. 2009; 31 (19833085): 539-55010.1016/j.immuni.2009.09.002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Interestingly, LPS/IFNγ–treated Trib1−/− BMDMs demonstrated significantly lower levels of total JAK1 protein but a comparable JAK1 activation, evidenced by an equal pJAK1/JAK1 ratio as compared with WT controls (Fig. 4D). Trib1 deficiency did not alter phosphorylated or total JAK2 (Fig. 4E). In macrophages stimulated with IL-4, M2 polarization is initiated by phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK3 (34.Nelms K. Keegan A.D. Zamorano J. Ryan J.J. Paul W.E. The IL-4 receptor: signaling mechanisms and biologic functions.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17 (10358772): 701-73810.1146/annurev.immunol.17.1.701Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). Similar to the observation in M1-stimulated macrophages, abundance of JAK1 protein was significantly reduced in Trib1−/− BMDMs stimulated with IL-4 (Fig. 4F). Here, we also observed a modest reduction in the pJAK1/JAK1 ratio (Fig. 4F). Trib1−/− BMDMs treated with IL-4 also displayed a tendency to lower total JAK3 levels and lower phosphorylated JAK3 (Fig. 4G). Together, these data support the notion that Trib1 deficiency in macrophages leads to lower JAK abundance, which attenuates subsequent activation of STAT signaling in response to M1 and M2 stimuli. To investigate whether the lower abundance of JAKs in Trib1−/− BMDMs is due to lower gene expression, we determined mRNA expression of Jak1 and Jak3. Levels of Jak1 and Jak3 mRNA were only modestly redu"

We aimed to identify whether prostate cancer survivors resident in New South Wales Australia are at higher risk of suicide and if so, who is most at risk. Methods Data were obtained from the New South Wales (NSW) Cancer Registry for all men diagnosed with prostate cancer in NSW during 1997 to 2007. These were linked by the Centre for Health Record Linkage (CHeReL) to Australian Bureau of Statistics Mortality Data to the end of 2007 to determine vital status and cause of death. We compared the number of suicides observed for prostate cancer survivors with the expected number of suicides based on age- and calendar year- specific rates for the NSW male population using standardised mortality ratios (SMRs). Suicide rate ratios (RR) by disease and patients’ characteristics were estimated using multivariable negative binomial regression to determine the most at risk groups. Results During the study period 51,924 NSW men were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Forty nine of these men were subsequently recorded as committing suicide up to 10 years after diagnosis with an SMR of 1.70 (95% CI:1.26–2.25). Twenty six (53%) of these suicides occurred within 12 months after diagnosis. Risk diminished over time since diagnosis (RR in 1–2 years after diagnosis = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.12–0.71, 2–4 years RR = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.14–0.16 and 4+ years RR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.11–0.60 compared with <1 year since diagnosis). Men with non-localised disease had a higher risk of suicide compared to men with localised disease (RR = 2.68, 95% CI: 1.15–6.23). Men living outside major cities had lower risk of suicide compared to those resident in major cities (rate ratio = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.20–0.87). Single, divorced, widowed or separated men were more likely to commit suicide than married men (RR = 4.18, 95% CI: 2.36–7.42). Conclusion Risk of suicide is higher for NSW men diagnosed with prostate cancer than the general age matched male population. Vulnerable or lonely men and those with pre-existing depression or suicidal ideation who are diagnosed with prostate cancer should be offered additional psychological support."
https://openalex.org/W2808323932,"Background Children living on farms experience exceptionally high risks for traumatic injury. There is a large body of epidemiological research documenting this phenomenon, yet few complementary studies that have explored the deep underlying reasons for such trends. Fundamental to this is understanding the decision-making processes of parents surrounding their choice to bring children, or not, into the farm worksite. Objectives To (1) document farm parent views of the risks and benefits of raising children on a family farm, and, (2) understand more deeply why children are brought into the farm worksite. Methods Interviews were conducted as part of a larger cohort study, The Saskatchewan Farm Injury Cohort. Subsequent to an initial mail-out question focused on parental decision-making, 11 semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with rural Saskatchewan farm parents. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim, then thematically analyzed using interpretive description methodology. Findings This parental decision-making process on farms fundamentally involves weighing the risks vs. benefits of bringing children into the worksite, as if on a balance scale. One side of this scale holds potential risks such as exposure to physical and chemical farm hazards, in the absence of full supervision. The other side holds potential benefits such as meeting family needs for childcare, labour, and family time; building work ethic and pride; and the positive impacts of involvement and responsibility. Decision-making 'tips the scales', in part dependent upon parental perceptions of the risk-benefit trade-off. This 'perceptual lens' is influenced by factors such as: the agricultural way of life, parents' prior knowledge and past experience, characteristics of children, and safety norms. Conclusions This novel qualitative study provides deep insight into how Saskatchewan farm parents approach a fundamental decision-making process associated with their parenting. The proposed model provides insight into the etiology of pediatric farm injuries as well as their prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2807919985,"Assessing the perception of key stakeholders within the forest sector is critical to evaluating their readiness to engage in adapting to climate change. Here, we report the results of the most comprehensive survey carried out in the Canadian forestry sector to date regarding perceptions of climate change. A total of 1158 individuals, representing a wide range of stakeholders across the five most important forestry provinces in Canada, were asked about climate change, its impact on forest ecosystems, and the suitability of current forest management for addressing future impacts. Overall, we found that respondents were more concerned about climate change than the general population. More than 90% of respondents agreed with the anthropogenic origins of climate change, and > 50% considered it a direct threat to their welfare. Political view was the main driver of general beliefs about the causes of climate change and its future consequences, while the province of origin proved to be the best predictor of perceived current impacts on forest ecosystems and its associated risks; and type of stakeholder was the main driver of perceived need for adaptation. Industrial stakeholders were the most skeptical about the anthropogenic cause(s) of climate change (18% disagreed with this statement, compared to an average of 8% in the other stakeholders), its impacts on forest ecosystems (28% for industry vs. 10% for other respondents), and the need for new management practices (18% vs. 7%). Although the degree of awareness and the willingness to implement adaptive practices were high even for the most skeptical groups, our study identified priority sectors or areas for action when designing awareness campaigns. We suggest that the design of a strategic framework for implementing climate adaptation within the Canadian forest sector should focus on the relationship between climate change and changes in disturbance regimes, and above all on the economic consequences of these changes, but it should also take into account the positions shown by each of the actors in each province."
https://openalex.org/W2808317893,"Organic agriculture (OA) is considered a strategy to make agriculture more sustainable. Bhutan has embraced the ambitious goal of becoming the world's first 100% organic nation. By analysing recent on-farm data in Bhutan, we found organic crop yields on average to be 24% lower than conventional yields. Based on these yield gaps, we assess the effects of the 100% organic conversion policy by employing an economy-wide computable general equilibrium (CGE) model with detailed representation of Bhutan's agricultural sector incorporating agroecological zones, crop nutrients, and field operations. Despite a low dependency on agrochemicals from the onset of this initiative, we find a considerable reduction in Bhutan's GDP, substantial welfare losses, particularly for non-agricultural households, and adverse impacts on food security. The yield gap is the main driver for a strong decline in domestic agricultural production, which is largely compensated by increased food imports, resulting in a weakening of the country's cereal self-sufficiency. Current organic by default farming practices in Bhutan are still underdeveloped and do not apply the systems approach of organic farming as defined in the IFOAM organic farming standards. This is reflected in the strong decline of nitrogen (N) availability to crops in our simulation and bears potential for increased yields in OA. Improvement of soil-fertility practices, e.g., the adoption of N-fixing crops, improved animal husbandry systems with increased provision of animal manure and access to markets with price premium for organic products could help to lower the economic cost of the large-scale conversion."
https://openalex.org/W2808563674,"Monocytes differentiate into macrophages, which deactivate invading pathogens. Macrophages can be resistant to cell death mechanisms in some situations, and the mechanisms involved are not clear. Here, using mouse immune cells, we investigated whether the differentiation of macrophages affects their susceptibility to cell death by the ripoptosome/necrosome pathways. We show that treatment of macrophages with a mimetic of second mitochondrial activator of caspases (SMAC) resulted in ripoptosome-driven cell death that specifically depended on tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) expression and the receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 1 (RipK1)–RipK3–caspase-8 interaction in activated and cycling macrophages. Differentiation of macrophages increased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines but reduced RipK1-dependent cell death and the RipK3–caspase-8 interaction. The expression of the anti-apoptotic mediators, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) and caspase-like apoptosis regulatory protein (cFLIPL), also increased in differentiated macrophages, which inhibited caspase activation. The resistance to cell death was abrogated in XIAP-deficient macrophages. However, even in the presence of increased XIAP expression, inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 and MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) made differentiated macrophages susceptible to cell death. These results suggest that the p38/MK2 pathway overrides apoptosis inhibition by XIAP and that acquisition of resistance to cell death by increased expression of XIAP and cFLIPL may allow inflammatory macrophages to participate in pathogen control for a longer duration.

https://openalex.org/W2808578515,"As access to antiretroviral therapy increases, more HIV-infected patients in sub-Saharan Africa may desire fertility. We conducted a cross-sectional study of reproductive health knowledge, attitudes and practices to identify factors associated with desired fertility among women and men receiving care at two large public HIV clinics in Lilongwe, Malawi. Research assistants administered questionnaires to participants. We performed descriptive, bivariable and multivariable analysis of factors related to desired fertility and of factors related to contraceptive non-use among participants who did not desire fertility. One-third of participants desired future children. Having a partner who desired fertility and having lower parity were associated with desiring children among both genders. For women, believing that pregnancy was unhealthy was associated with decreased fertility desire. Fifty-five percent of women and 69% of men who did not want children in the future reported using contraception at last intercourse. Increasing age, lower parity, and making the decision to use contraception herself were associated with contraceptive non-use among women who did not desire fertility. Having discussed family planning with his partner was associated with contraceptive use among men who did not desire fertility. Knowledge of these factors can guide reproductive health counseling and service provision."

It is not known at what stage of development and differentiation, AVM vessels became aberrant. To address this, we have analysed the expression of vascular differentiation, vascular maturation and brain capillary specific genes in AVM nidus.We performed immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis of vascular differentiation (HEY2, DLL4, EFNB2, and COUP-TFII), vascular maturation (ENG and KLF2) and brain capillary specific genes (GGTP and GLUT1) on ten surgically excised human brain AVMs and ten normal human brain tissues.Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that AVM vessels co-express both artery and vein differentiation genes. H-score analysis revealed that there is statistically significant (P < 0.0001) increase in expression of these proteins in AVM vessels compared to control vessels. These findings were further confirmed by western blot analysis and found to be statistically significant (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.001) for all proteins except Hey2. Both immunostaining and western blot analysis revealed that AVM vessels express GGTP and GLUT1, markers specific to brain capillaries. Immunofluorescent staining demonstrated that expression of KLF2, a vascular maturation marker is significantly (P <0.001) decreased in AVM vessels and was further confirmed by western blot analysis (P < 0.001). Immunohistochemical and western blot analysis demonstrated that another vascular maturation protein Endoglin had high expression in AVM vessels compared to control vessels. The results were found to be statistically significant (P < 0.0001).Our findings suggest that vascular structures of AVMs co-express markers specific for arteries, veins and capillaries. We conclude that AVM nidus constitutes of aberrant vessels which are not terminally differentiated and inadequately matured."

Perturbations of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis activate the unfolded protein response (UPR), which contributes to the development of metabolic alterations. Our aim was to evaluate liver UPR in an animal model of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). A significantly increased expression of X-box binding protein-1 spliced (XBP1s) mRNA (p<0.01), Endoplasmic Reticulum-localized DnaJ homologue (Erdj4) mRNA (p<0.05) and Bip/GRP78-glucose-regulated protein 78 (Bip) mRNA (p<0.05) was observed in the liver of IUGR rats at birth. Furthermore, the expression of gluconeogenesis genes and lipogenesis genes were significantly upregulated (p<0.05) in IUGR pups. At 105 d, IUGR male rats showed significantly reduced glucose tolerance (p<0.01). A significant decreased expression of XBP1s mRNA (p<0.01) and increased expression of double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK) and Asparagine synthetase (ASNS) (p<0.05) was observed in the liver of IUGR male adult rats. Liver focal steatosis and periportal fibrosis were observed in IUGR rats. These findings show for the first time that fetal exposure to uteroplacental insufficiency is associated with the activation of hepatic UPR and suggest that UPR signaling may play a role in the metabolic risk."

While we have succeeded in obtaining the culture supernatant extract (CSE) rich in DNJ from microorganism source, information regarding its anti-hyperglycemic effect and safety were still limited. Therefore, this study was aimed to evaluate the anti-hyperglycemic effect and safety of microorganism DNJ. Oral sucrose tolerance test was performed, and the result showed that CSE was able to significantly suppress the blood glucose elevation and suggested DNJ as the main active compound. To determine its safety, the absorption and excretion of microorganism DNJ were evaluated using 15N labeling method. Our findings investigated the recovery rate of 15N from DNJ reached 80% up to 48 hours after oral administration, suggesting its rapid excretion, suggesting the safety of DNJ. This study verified the functional properties and safety of DNJ from microorganisms, suggesting its potential use for functional purpose."
https://openalex.org/W2808388104,"Antibodies are essential biochemical reagents for detecting protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) in complex samples. However, recent efforts in developing PTM-targeting antibodies have reported frequent nonspecific binding and limited affinity of such antibodies. To address these challenges, we investigated whether directed evolution could be applied to improve the affinity of a high-specificity antibody targeting phosphothreonine 231 (pThr-231) of the human microtubule-associated protein tau. On the basis of existing structural information, we hypothesized that improving antibody affinity may come at the cost of loss in specificity. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel approach using yeast surface display to quantify the specificity of PTM-targeting antibodies. When we affinity-matured the single-chain variable antibody fragment through directed evolution, we found that its affinity can be improved >20-fold over that of the WT antibody, reaching a picomolar range. We also discovered that most of the high-affinity variants exhibit cross-reactivity toward the nonphosphorylated target site but not to the phosphorylation site with a scrambled sequence. However, systematic quantification of the specificity revealed that such a tradeoff between the affinity and specificity did not apply to all variants and led to the identification of a picomolar-affinity variant that has a matching high specificity of the original phosphotau antibody. In cell- and tissue-imaging experiments, the high-affinity variant gave significantly improved signal intensity while having no detectable nonspecific binding. These results demonstrate that directed evolution is a viable approach for obtaining high-affinity PTM-specific antibodies and highlight the importance of assessing the specificity in the antibody engineering process.

The analysis is conducted separately for households, financial, and non-financial institutions. Our results indicate that spanning tree measures for households reflected the boom and crisis: the maximum spanning tree measures had a clear upward tendency in the bull markets when the bubble was building up, and, even more importantly, the minimum spanning tree measures pre-reacted the burst of the bubble. At the same time, we find less clear reactions in the minimal and maximal spanning trees of non-financial and financial institutions around the bubble, which suggests that household investors can have a greater herding tendency around bubbles."
https://openalex.org/W2783149721,"Some female moths attract male moths by emitting series of pulses of pheromone filaments propagating downwind. The turbulent nature of the wind creates a complex flow environment, and causes the filaments to propagate in the form of patches with varying concentration distributions. Inspired by moth navigation capabilities, we propose a navigation strategy that enables a flier to locate a pulsating odor source in a windy environment using a single threshold-based detection sensor. The strategy is constructed based on the physical properties of the turbulent flow carrying discrete puffs of odor and does not involve learning, memory, complex decision making or statistical methods. We suggest that in turbulent plumes from a pulsating point source, an instantaneously measurable quantity referred as a ""puff crossing time"", improves the success rate as compared to the navigation strategy based on ""internal counter"" that does not use this information. Using computer simulations of fliers navigating in turbulent plumes of the pulsating point source for varying flow parameters: turbulent intensities, plume meandering and wind gusts, we obtained trajectories qualitatively resembling male moths flights towards the pheromone sources. We quantified the probability of a successful navigation as well as the flight parameters such as the time spent searching and the total flight time, with respect to different turbulent intensities, meandering or gusts. The concepts learned using this model may help to design odor-based navigation of miniature airborne autonomous vehicles."
https://openalex.org/W2808662984,"Sexual reproduction remains an understudied feature of oomycete biology. To expand our knowledge of this process, we used RNA-seq and quantitative proteomics to examine matings in Phytophthora infestans. Exhibiting significant changes in mRNA abundance in three matings between different A1 and A2 strains compared to nonmating controls were 1170 genes, most being mating-induced. Rising by >10-fold in at least one cross were 455 genes, and 182 in all three crosses. Most genes had elevated expression in a self-fertile strain. Many mating-induced genes were associated with cell wall biosynthesis, which may relate to forming the thick-walled sexual spore (oospore). Several gene families were induced during mating including one encoding histidine, serine, and tyrosine-rich putative wall proteins, and another encoding prolyl hydroxylases which may strengthen the extracellular matrix. The sizes of these families vary >10-fold between Phytophthora species and one exhibits concerted evolution, highlighting two features of genome dynamics within the genus. Proteomic analyses of mature oospores and nonmating hyphae using isobaric tags for quantification identified 835 shared proteins, with 5% showing >2-fold changes in abundance between the tissues. Enriched in oospores were β-glucanases potentially involved in digesting the oospore wall during germination. Despite being dormant, oospores contained a mostly normal complement of proteins required for core cellular functions. The RNA-seq data generated here and in prior studies were used to identify new housekeeping controls for gene expression studies that are more stable than existing normalization standards. We also observed >2-fold variation in the fraction of polyA+ RNA between life stages, which should be considered when quantifying transcripts and may also be relevant to understanding translational control during development."
https://openalex.org/W2807723051,"Rocio virus (ROCV) was the causative agent of an unprecedented outbreak of encephalitis during the 1970s in the Vale do Ribeira, Sao Paulo State, in the Southeast region of Brazil. Surprisingly, no further cases of ROCV infection were identified after this outbreak; however, serological surveys have suggested the circulation of ROCV among humans and animals in different regions of Brazil. Cross-protective immunity among flaviviruses is well documented; consequently, immunity induced by infections with other flaviviruses endemic to Brazil could potentially be responsible for the lack of ROCV infections. Herein, we evaluated the cross-protection mediated by other flaviviruses against ROCV infection using an experimental C57BL/6 mouse model. Cross-protection against ROCV infection was observed when animals had prior exposure to Ilheus virus or Saint Louis encephalitis virus, suggesting that cross-reactive anti-flavivirus antibodies may limit ROCV disease outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W2808652299,"Brucellosis is a serious infectious disease that continues to be a significant cause of morbidity worldwide and across all ages. Despite early diagnosis and treatment, 10-30% of patients develop chronic brucellosis. Although there have been recent advances in our knowledge of Brucella virulence factors and hosts' immune response to the infection, there is a lack of clear data regarding how the infection bypasses the immune system and becomes chronic. The present study investigated immunological factors and their roles in the transition of brucellosis from an acute to a chronic infection in CD4+ T cells. CD4+ T cells sorted from peripheral blood samples of patients with acute or chronic brucellosis and healthy controls using flow cytometry as well as more than 2000 miRNAs were screened using the GeneSpring GX (Agilent) 13.0 miRNA microarray software and were validated using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Compared to acute cases, the expression levels of 28 miRNAs were significantly altered in chronic cases. Apart from one miRNA (miR-4649-3p), 27 miRNAs were not expressed in the acute cases (p <0.05, fold change> 2). According to KEGG pathway analysis, these miRNAs are involved in the regulation of target genes that were previously involved in the MAPK signalling pathway, regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, endocytosis, and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum. This indicates the potential role of these miRNAs in the development of chronic brucellosis. We suggest that these miRNAs can be used as markers to determine the transition of the disease into chronicity. This is the first study of miRNA expression that analyses human CD4+ T cells to clarify the mechanism of chronicity in brucellosis."
https://openalex.org/W2807774590,"Major sporting events may influence attendance levels at hospital emergency departments (ED). Previous research has focussed on the impact of single games, or wins/losses for specific teams/countries, limiting wider generalisations. Here we explore the impact of the Euro 2016 football championships on ED attendances across four participating nations (England, France, Northern Ireland, Wales), using a single methodology. Match days were found to have no significant impact upon daily ED attendances levels. Focussing upon hourly attendances, ED attendances across all countries in the four hour pre-match period were statistically significantly lower than would be expected (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.94–0.99) and further reduced during matches (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.91–0.97). In the 4 hour post-match period there was no significant increase in attendances (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.99–1.04). However, these impacts were highly variable between individual matches: for example in the 4 hour period following the final, involving France, the number of ED attendances in France increased significantly (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.13–1.42). Overall our results indicate relatively small impacts of major sporting events upon ED attendances. The heterogeneity observed makes it difficult for health providers to predict how major sporting events may affect ED attendances but supports the future development of compatible systems in different countries to support cross-border public health surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W2807873686,"Introduction Breast cancer in young women tends to be more aggressive, but timely treatment may not be always available, particularly to those without health insurance. We aim to examine whether the dependent coverage expansion under the Affordable Care Act (ACA-DCE) implemented in 2010 was associated with changes in time to treatment among women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer. Methods A total of 7,176 patients diagnosed with early stage breast cancer in 2007–2009 (pre-ACA) and 2011–2013 (post-ACA) were identified from the National Cancer Database. A quasi-experimental design difference-in-differences (DD) approach was used, with patients aged 19–25 (targeted by the policy) considered as the intervention group, and patients aged 26–34 years (not affected by the policy) as the control group. Changes in the following treatment outcomes were examined: time from diagnosis to surgery, time from surgery to adjuvant chemotherapy, and time from adjuvant chemotherapy to radiation. Results Compared with the control group of patients aged 26–34, young patients aged 19–25 experienced a statistically nonsignificant decrease of 2.7 percentage points (95% CI [-1.2, 6.5]) in the uninsured rate. This did not translate into more reduction in delays to surgery (DD = 2.7 days, 95% CI [-3.2, 8.3]), chemotherapy (DD = -1.0 days, 95% CI [-7.2, 5.2]) or radiation (DD = 5.3 days, 95% CI [-15.6, 26.3]) in the younger cohort than the older cohort. Conclusions and Relevance No significant changes in time to treatment were found among young women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer after the implementation of the ACA-DCE. Future studies examining impacts of health care policy reform on breast cancer care are warranted to include patients from low-income families and to consider effects from Medicaid expansion."
https://openalex.org/W2808511456,"Either metformin or liraglutide has been reported to have anti-tumor effects on pancreatic cancer cells. However, it is not clear whether their combined treatment has additive or synergistic anti-tumor effects on pancreatic cancer cells. In this study, the human pancreatic cancer cell line MiaPaca-2 was incubated with liraglutide and/or metformin. The cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), colony formation, flow cytometry, and wound-healing and transwell migration assays were used to detect cell viability, clonogenic survival, cell cycle and cell migration, respectively. RT-PCR and western blot analyses were used to determine the mRNA and protein levels of related molecules. Results showed that combination treatment with liraglutide (100 nmol/L) and metformin (0.75 mmol/L) significantly decreased cell viability and colony formation, caused cell cycle arrest, upregulated the level of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and cleaved caspase-3, and inhibited cell migration in the cells, although their single treatment did not exhibit such effects. Combination index value for cell viability indicated a synergistic interaction of liraglutide and metformin. Moreover, the combined treatment with liraglutide and metformin could activate the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) more potently than their single treatment in the cells. These results suggest that liraglutide in combination with metformin has a synergistic anti-tumor effect on the pancreatic cancer cells, which may be at least partly due to activation of AMPK signaling. Our study provides new insights into the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes and pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2808038919,"Several studies have shown an increased accumulation of terminally differentiated T cells during HIV infection, suggestive of exhaustion/senescence, causing dysregulation of T cell homeostasis and function and rapid HIV disease progression. We have investigated whether long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART), which controls viremia and restores CD4 T cell counts, is correlated with reduction in terminally differentiated T cells, improved ratios of naïve to memory and function of T cells in 100 virologically controlled HIV-infected patients. We show that while the median frequencies of terminally differentiated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (CD28-, CD27-, CD57+ and CD28-CD57+), were higher in the virologically controlled HIV-infected patients' cohort compared with uninfected individuals' cohort, the frequencies of these cells significantly decreased with increasing CD4 T cell counts in HIV-infected patients. Although, the naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were lower in HIV patients' cohort than uninfected cohort, there was a significant increase in both naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with increasing CD4 T cell counts in HIV-infected patients. The underlying mechanism behind this increased naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in HIV-infected patients was due to an increase in recent thymic emigrants, CD4+CD31+, as compared to CD4+CD31-. The CD4+ T cells of HIV-infected patients produced cytokines, including IL-2, IL-10 and IFN-γ comparable to uninfected individuals. In conclusion, virologically controlled HIV-infected patients on long-term ART show a significant reduction in terminally differentiated T cells, suggestive of decreased exhaustion/senescence, and improvement in the ratios of naïve to memory and function of T cells."

To enable transcriptional responses, intra- or extracellular signals need to be transmitted to the nucleus; nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of transcription factors is a mechanism involved in this process (15.Cartwright P. Helin K. Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of transcription factors.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57 (11028912): 1193-120610.1007/PL00000759Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Nuclear pore complexes allow passive diffusion of ions and small proteins (<40 kDa) through the nuclear envelope, but passage of larger molecules is restricted to those containing appropriate targeting signals recognized by specific carrier proteins known as karyopherins. Karyopherins engaged in nuclear import are known as importins, and those engaged in export from the nucleus are known as exportins (16.Lange A. Mills R.E. Lange C.J. Stewart M. Devine S.E. Corbett A.H. Classical nuclear localization signals: Definition, function, and interaction with importin alpha.J. Biol.

Subcellular localization and shuttling of proteins between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments are consequences of a dynamic balance between operational strengths of nuclear localization signals (NLS) and nuclear export signals (NES) (14.Kumar S.

It has been shown that leptomycin B (LMB) inhibits protein transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by interacting with exportin 1, which depends on a leucine-enriched sequence known as the classical NES (17.Gerace L.

The subcellular localization of NPAS4 was first reported in a study examining full-length NPAS4 48 h after transfecting COS-7 cells, revealing a strict nuclear localization of this protein (2.Moser M. Knoth R. Bode C. Patterson C. LE-PAS, a novel Arnt-dependent HLH-PAS protein, is expressed in limbic tissues and transactivates the CNS midline enhancer element.Mol.

Analyses performed in HEK293 cells 48 h after transfection yielded a similar result (20.Shamloo M. Soriano L. von Schack D. Rickhag M. Chin D.J. Gonzalez-Zulueta M. Gido G. Urfer R. Wieloch T.

MAGED1 is a novel regulator of a select subset of bHLH PAS transcription factors.FEBS J. 2016; 283 (27472814): 3488-350210.1111/febs.13824Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) show by immunofluorescent staining of fixed HEK293T cells 24 h after transfection that NPAS4 even though most staining was nuclear, some staining was also presented in the cytoplasm. Additionally, Western blot analysis of samples obtained by subcellular fractionation of rat coronal brain tissue reveal NPAS4 expression not only in the nucleus but also in the cytoplasm of cells. Ischemic insult resulted in partial translocation of NPAS4 from the cytoplasm to intracellular membranes. Moreover, in that study, NPAS4 was also detected in microsomal and synaptosomal fractions (20.Shamloo M. Soriano L. von Schack D. Rickhag M. Chin D.J. Gonzalez-Zulueta M. Gido G. Urfer R. Wieloch T. Nikolich K. Npas4, a novel helix-loop-helix PAS domain protein, is regulated in response to cerebral ischemia.Eur. J.

These findings suggest that NPAS4 contains motifs that direct its localization to different cellular compartments. In our present study, we sought to perform a detailed characterization of the subcellular localization motifs of NPAS4 protein. We found that 24 h after transfection, NPAS4 was exchanged between the nucleus the and cytoplasm in COS-7 and Neuro 2a (N2a) cells. However, 48 h after transfection, we observed a dominantly nuclear distribution of NPAS4, especially under high-glucose medium conditions. We showed that NPAS4 contains NLSs and NESs in different regions of its protein structure. Interestingly, the NLSs and NESs of NPAS4 appear as partially overlapping pairs or in close proximity. This finding raises the possibility of alternating the activity of these signals and suggests that the interaction of the NLS of NPAS4 with importin prevents the interaction of the NES of NPAS4 with exportin and vice versa. This dynamic may play a role in the regulation of NPAS4 cellular shuttling. We suggest glucose concentration as one of factors that putatively influences the transport of NPAS4 protein. Additionally, in this study, experiments with LMB revealed that the activities of NESs are exportin-dependent. Chalfie et al. (22.Chalfie M. Tu Y. Euskirchen G. Ward W.W. Prasher D.C. Green fluorescent protein as a marker for gene expression.Science. 1994; 263 (8303295): 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (5487) Google Scholar) describe that green fluorescent protein (GFP) can be used to monitor protein expression and localization in living organisms. Labeling proteins with different fluorescent proteins is currently a widely popular method that not only affects the localization but also the function of fused protein (23.Chudakov D.M. Matz M.V. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K.A. Fluorescent proteins and their applications in imaging living cells and tissues. 2010; 90 (20664080): 1103-116310.1152/physrev.00038.2009Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after transfecting COS-7 and N2a cells, we analyzed the subcellular localization of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)–tagged full-length NPAS4 and its derivatives by confocal and fluorescence microscopy. The expression of YFP-tagged NPAS4 and its derivatives in COS-7 cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis using an anti-GFP antibody (Fig. S1). In our experiments using low-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), we noticed that the distribution of full-length NPAS4 in COS-7 and N2a cells 24 h after transfection was not exclusively nuclear. In particular, we observed more fluorescent protein in the cytoplasm (over 80% in COS-7 cells and 90% in N2a cells) than in the nucleus (less than 20% in COS-7 cells and 10% in N2a cells) (Figs. 1A, a and b, and S2A). Repeating the experiments under high-glucose conditions, the proportion of cells with nuclear localization of NPAS4 to cells with cytoplasmic localization of NPAS4 increased to 80/20 among COS-7 cells (Fig. 1B, a) and 30/70 among N2a cells 24 after transfection (Figs. 1C, a and a′, and S2A). Forty-eight hours after transfection, this proportion reached 90/10 in COS-7 cells and 50/50 in N2a cells (Fig. S2A). Expression of YFP resulted in ubiquitous localization in analyzed COS-7 cells independent of glucose concentration (Figs. 1D and S2B). Our results suggested that NPAS4 possess motifs that function as NLSs and NESs. First, we used LMB, a known classical NES-dependent transport inhibitor (17.Gerace L. Nuclear export signals and the fast track to the cytoplasm.Cell. 1995; 82 (7634321): 341-34410.1016/0092-8674(95)90420-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 18.Kudo N. Wolff B.

Because we observed a decreasing number of live cells expressing YFP-NPAS4 after 48 h, we decided to perform further imaging experiments 24 h after transfection. Additional experiments in N2a cells were performed only in high-glucose medium, whereas additional experiments in COS-7 cells were performed in both high- and low-glucose medium. The addition of LMB to COS-7 and N2a cells resulted in strictly nuclear localization of NPAS4 (Figs. 1B, b, 1C, b, and S3A), indicating the inhibition of protein shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. To prove that methanol (LMB solvent) is not responsible for changes in protein localization after LMB addition, we used methanol alone, and we observed variable localization of NPAS4 similar to the results without LMB addition (Figs. 1B, c, 1C, c, and S3A). Interestingly, we did not observe a simultaneous localization of full-length NPAS4 in both the cell nucleus and cytoplasm. Retention of NPAS4 in the nucleus after LMB addition suggested the presence of an active NLS in this protein. To confirm that the influence of LMB on NPAS4 subcellular localization was specific, we expressed YFP alone in COS-7 and N2a cells and observed a ubiquitous distribution of YFP fluorescence that was independent of the presence or absence of LMB or methanol (Figs. 1D and S3A). Based on our results, we hypothesized that NPAS4 contains a sequence (or several sequences) that is responsible for its translocation to the nucleus (NLS) and a sequence (or several sequences) responsible for its translocation to the cytoplasm. To test this hypothesis, we performed a set of in silico analyses of the NPAS4 sequence using various NLS and NES predictors. Detailed results of predictions are presented in Fig. 2. NucPred and SeqNLS did not predict any putative NLS sequence. NLStradamus, using a cut-off value of 0.1, predicted two potential NLS sequences encompassing amino acid (aa) residues Gly7–Arg13 in the bHLH domain and Glu196–Gly211 in the PAS-2 domain (Fig. 2, top and middle). When using a low cut-off value, cNLS Mapper identified five putative bipartite NLSs located in the following different regions of NPAS4: Lys10–Tyr39 and Glu19–Thr50 (bHLH domain), Arg158–Phe192 (region adjacent to PAS-2), Arg222–Trp252 (PAS-2), Arg285—Ile316 (PAC), and Gln593–Phe622 (C-terminal region) (Fig. 2, top and middle). NetNES predicted residues Leu37, Ile42, and Leu45 as part of a putative NES (bHLH domain); Ile232, Glu234, and Leu247 as a second NES (PAS-2); and Gly596 as part of a third NES (C-terminal region) (Fig. 2, top and bottom). LocNES predicted residues Pro28–Ile42 as the first NES (bHLH) and Met218–Val236 or Ala228–Phe242 as the second NES (PAS-2) (Fig. 2, top and bottom). NESFinder predicted residues Ile20–Leu29 (bHLH domain) and Leu591–Leu604 and Gly664–Leu674 (C-terminal region) (Fig. 2, top and bottom). ValidNES predicted putative NES residues Leu23–Leu29 (bHLH domain), Leu227–Ile232 or Leu237–Phe242 (PAS-2), and Leu594–Val600 and Leu668–Leu674 (C-terminal region) (Fig. 2, top and bottom). However, the results obtained by the different predictors were not fully consistent. Nevertheless, the in silico analysis suggested the presence of NLSs in the bHLH domain, the PAS-2 domain, and the C-terminal region of NPAS4. Accordingly, putative NESs were expected to be located in the bHLH domain, the PAS-2 domain, and the C-terminal region of NPAS4. Interestingly, the predicted NLS and NES motifs seemed to be located within a very close distance, and thus we next verified these results experimentally. To identify the putative NLS and NES motifs in the bHLH domain, we generated N-terminally YFP-tagged derivatives of the NPAS4 bHLH domain. To ensure that we did not disrupt structural motifs within the NPAS4 sequence, truncation mutants were designed according to the domain architecture (1.Ooe N. Saito K. Mikami N. Nakatuka I. Kaneko H.

We used Draq5 DNA dye to visualize the nuclei and nucleoli. In contrast to full-length NPAS4, the YFP-labeled bHLH domain (Fig. 3A, YFP-NPAS4/1–59) presented a nuclear and nucleolar distribution in COS-7 cells in low-glucose DMEM (Fig. 3B, a and a′) and in N2a cells in high-glucose DMEM (Fig. S4). Interestingly, expression of the bHLH domain in COS-7 cells in high-glucose conditions resulted in the appearance of few (<5%) cells presenting both cytoplasmic and nucleolar fluorescence (Fig. S4). We performed an in silico prediction of the nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) in NPAS4 with the nucleolar localization sequence detector (NoD) and found that the bHLH domain was negative for any NoLS (score of 0.75). However, previously performed in silico predictions of NLSs and NESs in NPAS4 showed that a partially overlapping NLS and NES could be present in this region (Fig. 2). To confirm these overlapping signals experimentally, we prepared constructs including aa 1–40 and 26–59 (Fig. 3A). Deletion of aa 41–59 resulted in a weakening of the fluorescence signal of YFP-NPAS4/1–40 in the nucleoli. Additionally, although this protein fragment could still enter the nucleus, it also appeared in the cytoplasm of COS-7 and N2a cells, indicating weak NLS signal activity, probably due to the absence of the basic amino acids Arg51 and Lys52 (Figs. 3B, b and b′, and S5). As NLS activity typically depends on the presence of basic amino acid residues (16.Lange A. Mills R.E. Lange C.J. Stewart M. Devine S.E. Corbett A.H. Classical nuclear localization signals: Definition, function, and interaction with importin alpha.J. Biol.

Controlling protein compartmentalization to overcome disease.Pharm. Res. 2007; 24 (16969692): 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we prepared a mutant including a 1–40–aa fragment, where Arg21 and Lys24 were substituted by Ala (Fig. 3A). The localization of this mutant shifted from predominantly nuclear for the unmodified fragment (Figs. 3B, b, and S5) to only slightly predominantly nuclear. Additionally, this mutant was unequivocally excluded from the nucleoli (Figs. 3B, c, and S5), presenting reasonably low NLS activity and no NoLS activity in the nucleoli. Based on the results from cNLS Mapper (Fig. 2B) and our experiments, we concluded that the bHLH domain contains multipartite NLS motifs comprising aa 10–52 (10KARRDQINAEIRNLKELLPLAEADKVRLSYLHIMSLACIYTRK52, where bold are basic residues and bold and underlined are basic substituted residues). Additionally, this sequence was found to be linked directly to the NoLS, in which aa 51RK52 are indispensable for NoLS activity. The YFP-NPAS4/26–59 truncation mutant was predominantly cytoplasmic (Figs. 3B, d, and S5) because of the predicted NES. We then used LMB to verify the presence of NES in this fragment. Although we observed a clear shift in localization from cytoplasmic to predominantly nuclear (Fig. 3B, e), the addition of methanol as a control did not influence localization (Fig. 3B, f). As classical NES activity depends on the presence of hydrophobic residues (usually Leu) (25.Davis J.R. Kakar M. Lim C.S. Controlling protein compartmentalization to overcome disease.Pharm. Res. 2007; 24 (16969692): 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we next substituted Leu27 and Leu29 with Ala in the 26–50–aa bHLH fragment tagged with YFP (Fig. 3A, YFP-NPAS4/26–50/L27A/L29A). Expression of this point mutant resulted in fluorescence in both the nucleus and cytoplasm as opposed to the diffuse cytoplasmic fluorescence of the unmodified truncated mutant. Interestingly, although protein aggregates appeared around the nuclear membrane in some cells (Fig. 3B, g and g′), these aggregates in other cells were visible throughout the whole cell (Fig. 3B, h and h′). This experiment proved that residues Leu27 and Leu29 are crucial for leucine-rich NES activity in the bHLH domain. Additionally, dominant nuclear localization of the YFP-NPAS4/1–40 mutant (Fig. 3B, b) lacking Leu45 indicated the importance of this amino acid residue for NES activity. Based on results from the NetNES and LocNES predictors (Fig. 2C), we concluded that the bHLH domain contains the sequence 26LLPLAEADKVRLSYLHIMSL45 (where bold are hydrophobic residues and bold and underlined are hydrophobic substituted residues) and exhibits NES activity. Altogether, our results show that the bHLH domain contains two overlapping sequences that are active NLS and NES motifs. Additionally, nuclear and nucleolar localization motifs of the bHLH domain of NPAS4 are directly linked. To identify putative NLS and NES motifs in the PAS-1 a"

A cis-alkene permitted the conformational flexibility of the A-chain N-terminal helix necessary for high-affinity IR binding, resulting in surprisingly rapid activity in vivo. Here, we show that, unlike the rapidly acting LysB28ProB29 insulin analogue (KP insulin), cis-dicarba insulin is not inherently monomeric. We also show that cis-dicarba KP insulin lowers blood glucose levels even more rapidly than KP insulin, suggesting that an inability to oligomerize is not responsible for the observed rapid activity onset of cis-dicarba analogues. Although rapid-acting, neither dicarba species is stable, as assessed by fibrillation and thermodynamics assays. MALDI analyses and molecular dynamics simulations of cis-dicarba insulin revealed a previously unidentified role of the A6–A11 linkage in insulin conformational dynamics. By controlling the conformational flexibility of the insulin B-chain helix, this linkage affects overall insulin structural stability. This effect is independent of its regulation of the A-chain N-terminal helix flexibility necessary for IR engagement.

https://openalex.org/W2807939345,"Purpose A fast and accurate intraoperative registration method is important for Computer-Aided Orthopedic Surgery (CAOS). A-mode ultrasound (US) is able to acquire bone surface data in a non-invasive manner. To utilize A-mode US in CAOS, a suitable registration algorithm is necessary with a small number of registration points and the presence of measurement errors. Therefore, we investigated the effects of (1) the number of registration points and (2) the Ultrasound Point Localization Error (UPLE) on the overall registration accuracy. Methods We proposed a new registration method (ICP-PS), including the Iterative Closest Points (ICP) algorithm and a Perturbation Search algorithm. This method enables to avoid getting stuck in the local minimum of ICP iterations and to find the adjacent global minimum. This registration method was subsequently validated in a numerical simulation and a cadaveric experiment using a 3D-tracked A-mode US system. Results The results showed that ICP-PS outperformed the standard ICP algorithm. The registration accuracy improved with the addition of ultrasound registration points. In the numerical simulation, for 25 sample points with zero UPLE, the averaged registration error of ICP-PS reached 0.25 mm, while 1.71 mm for ICP, decreasing by 85.38%. In the cadaver experiment, using 25 registration points, ICP-PS achieved an RMSE of 2.81 mm relative to 5.84 mm for the ICP, decreasing by 51.88%. Conclusions The simulation approach provided a well-defined framework for estimating the necessary number of ultrasound registration points and acceptable level of UPLE for a given required level of accuracy for intraoperative registration in CAOS. ICP-PS method is suitable for A-mode US based intraoperative registration. This study would facilitate the application of A-mode US probe in registering the point cloud to a known shape model, which also has the potential for accurately estimating bone position and orientation for skeletal motion tracking and surgical navigation."
https://openalex.org/W2808080211,"Gene editing protocols often require the use of a subcloning step to isolate successfully edited cells, the behavior of which is then compared to the aggregate parental population and/or other non-edited subclones. Here we demonstrate that the inherent functional heterogeneity present in many cell lines can render these populations inappropriate controls, resulting in erroneous interpretations of experimental findings. We describe a novel CRISPR/Cas9 protocol that incorporates a single-cell cloning step prior to gene editing, allowing for the generation of appropriately matched, functionally equivalent control and edited cell lines. As a proof of concept, we generated matched control and osteopontin-knockout Her2+ and Estrogen receptor-negative murine mammary carcinoma cell lines and demonstrated that the osteopontin-knockout cell lines exhibit the expected biological phenotypes, including unaffected primary tumor growth kinetics and reduced metastatic outgrowth in female FVB mice. Using these matched cell lines, we discovered that osteopontin-knockout mammary tumors were more sensitive than control tumors to chemotherapy in vivo. Our results demonstrate that heterogeneity must be considered during experimental design when utilizing gene editing protocols and provide a solution to account for it."
https://openalex.org/W2808406503,"In the late stage of anthocyanin biosynthesis, dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR) and anthocyanidin synthase (ANS) mediate a formal tautomerization. However, such oxidation/reduction process requires high energy and appears to be unnecessary, as the oxidation state does not change during the transformation. Thus, a non-enzymatic pathway of tautomerization has also been proposed. To resolve the long-standing issue of whether this non-enzymatic pathway is the main contributor for the biosynthesis, we carried out density functional theory (DFT) calculations to examine this non-enzymatic pathway from dihydroflavonol to anthocyanidin. We show here that the activation barriers for the proposed non-enzymatic tautomerization are too high to enable the reaction to proceed under normal aqueous conditions in plants. The calculations also explain the experimentally observed requirement for acidic conditions during the final step of conversion of 2-flaven-3,4-diol to anthocyanidin; a thermodynamically and kinetically favorable concerted pathway can operate under these conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2808436617,"The principal finding from this study was the recognition that the α-adrenergic antagonist, phenoxybenzamine, possesses histone deacetylase inhibitory activity. Phenoxybenzamine is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of hypertensive crises associated with tumors of the adrenal medulla, pheochromocytomas. It has several ""off label"" indications relative to its capacity to relax vascular smooth muscle and smooth muscle of the urogenital tract. The drug also has a long history of apparent efficacy in ameliorating, and perhaps reversing, the severe symptoms of neuropathic pain syndromes. Our interest in this feature of the drug relates to the fact that certain types of neuropathic pain, in particular complex regional pain syndrome, demonstrate a proliferative nature, with the capacity to spread from an injured limb, for example, to a non-injured limb and perhaps to essentially the entire body. Sensory neuronal sprouting in the spinal cord has been observed under conditions where there is a high sensory input from painful stimuli. Searches of gene expression signatures in the BroadBuild02 Molecular Signature Database using their connectivity map software suggested that phenoxybenzamine may have histone deacetylase inhibitory activity. Studies by others have reported inhibitory effects of phenoxybenzamine on growth, invasion and migration of human tumor cell cultures and, in one study, inhibition of tumor expansion in animal experiments. Inhibitory effects on human tumor cell cultures are also reported in the present study. Phenoxybenzamine was also found to have histone deacetylase inhibitory activity; histone deacetylase isoforms 5, 6, and 9 were the most sensitive to inhibition by phenoxybenzamine. The importance of elevated levels of these isoforms as biomarkers of poor prognosis in human malignant disease, and the recognized suppression of tumor growth that may accrue from their inhibition, opens consideration of possible translation of phenoxybenzamine to new clinical applications. This might be facilitated by the fact that phenoxybenzamine is already an approved drug entity. There appears to be no previous report of the activity of phenoxybenzamine as a histone deacetylase inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W2808574487,"Purpose To assess and improve the effectiveness of ICU care, in-hospital mortality rates are often used as principal quality indicator for benchmarking purposes. Two other often used, easily quantifiable, quality indicators to assess the efficiency of ICU care are based on readmission to the ICU and ICU length of stay. Our aim was to examine whether there is an association between case-mix adjusted outcome-based quality indicators in the general ICU population as well as within specific subgroups. Materials and methods We included patients admitted in 2015 of all Dutch ICUs. We derived the standardized in-hospital mortality ratio (SMR); the standardized readmission ratio (SRR); and the standardized length of stay ratio (SLOSR). We expressed association through Pearson’s correlation coefficients. Results The SMR ranged from 0.6 to 1.5; the SRR ranged from 0.7 to 2.1; and the SLOSR ranged from 0.7 to 1.3. For the total ICU population we found no significant associations. We found a positive, non-significant, association between SMR and SLOSR for admissions with low-mortality risk, (r = 0.25; p = 0.024), and a negative association between these indicators for admissions with high-mortality risk (r = -0.49; p<0.001). Conclusion Overall, we found no association at ICU population level. Differential associations were found between performance on mortality and length of stay within different risk strata. We recommend users of quality information to take these three outcome indicators into account when benchmarking ICUs as they capture different aspects of ICU performance. Furthermore, we suggest to report quality indicators for patient subgroups."
https://openalex.org/W2949253103,"Carotenoids are organic pigment molecules that play important roles in signalling, control of oxidative stress, and immunity. Fish allocate carotenoids to their eggs, which gives them the typical yellow to red colouration and supports their resistance against microbial infections. However, it is still unclear whether carotenoids act mainly as a shield against infection or are used up during the embryos’ immune defence. We investigated this question with experimental families produced from wild-caught brown trout (Salmo trutta). Singly raised embryos were either exposed to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas fluorescens or sham-treated at one of two stages during their development. A previous study on these experimental families reported positive effects of egg carotenoids on embryo growth and resistance against the infection. Here, we quantified carotenoid consumption, i.e. the active metabolization of carotenoids into compounds that are not other carotenoid types, in these infected and sham-infected maternal sib groups. We found that carotenoid contents mostly decreased during embryogenesis. However, these decreases were neither linked to the virulence induced by the pathogen nor dependent on the time point of infection. We conclude that egg carotenoids are not significantly used up by the embryos’ immune defence."
https://openalex.org/W2790521354,"The current research examined whether carriers of the short 5-HTTLPR allele (in SLC6A4), who have been shown to selectively attend to negative information, exhibit a bias towards negative self-referent processing. The self-referent encoding task (SRET) was used to measure self-referential processing of positive and negative adjectives. Ratcliff’s diffusion model isolated and extracted decision-making components from SRET responses and reaction times. Across the initial (N = 183) and replication (N = 137) studies, results indicated that short 5-HTTLPR allele carriers more easily categorized negative adjectives as self-referential (i.e., higher drift rate). Further, drift rate was associated with recall of negative self-referential stimuli. Findings across both studies provide further evidence that genetic variation may contribute to the etiology of negatively biased processing of self-referent information. Large scale studies examining the genetic contributions to negative self-referent processing may be warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2808057205,"Regional citrate anticoagulation has been associated with enhanced biocompatibility in hemodialysis, but the optimal dose of citrate remains to be established. Here, we compared parameters related to cellular activation during in vitro dialysis, using two doses of citrate.Human whole blood, anticoagulated with either 3 mM or 4 mM of citrate, was recirculated in an in vitro miniaturized dialysis setup. Complement (C3a-desArg), soluble platelet factor 4 (PF4), thromboxane B2 (TXB2), myeloperoxidase (MPO), as well as platelet- and red blood cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) were quantified during recirculation. Dialyzer fibers were examined by scanning electron microscopy after recirculation to assess the activation of clotting and the deposition of blood cells.Increases in markers of platelet and leukocyte activation, PF4, TXB2, and MPO were comparable between both citrate groups. Complement activation tended to be lower at higher citrate concentration, but the difference between the two citrate groups did not reach significance. A strong increase in EVs, particularly platelet-derived EVs, was observed during in vitro dialysis for both citrate groups, which was significantly less pronounced in the high citrate group at the end of the experiment. Assessment of dialyzer clotting scores after analysis of individual fibers by scanning electron microscopy revealed significantly lower scores in the high citrate group.Our data indicate that an increase in the citrate concentration from 3 mM to 4 mM further dampens cellular activation, thereby improving biocompatibility. A concentration of 4 mM citrate might therefore be optimal for use in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2808169467,"Recent studies have highlighted the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in the regulation of muscle satellite cell behavior. Herein we report preclinical studies designed to characterize the effects of a novel JAK/STAT inhibitor on plantar flexor skeletal muscle function, morphology, and satellite cell content.The compound, SGI-1252, was administered orally (400mg/kg) in a 10% dextrose solution to wild type mice (n = 6) 3 times per week for 8 weeks. A control group (n = 6) received only the dextrose solution.SGI-1252 was well tolerated, as animals displayed similar weight gain over the 8-week treatment period. Following treatment, fatigue in the gastrocnemius-soleus-plantaris complex was greater in the SGI-1252 mice during a 300 second tetanic contraction bout (p = 0.035), though both the rate of fatigue and maximal force production were similar. SGI-1252 treated mice had increased type II myofiber cross-sectional area (1434.8 ± 225.4 vs 1754.7 ± 138.5 μm2), along with an increase in wet muscle mass (125.45 ± 5.46 vs 139.6 ± 12.34 mg, p = 0.032) of the gastrocnemius relative to vehicle treated mice. SGI-1252 treatment reduced gastrocnemius STAT3 phosphorylation 53% (94.79 ± 45.9 vs 44.5 ± 6.1 MFI) and significantly increased the concentration of Pax7+ satellite cells (2589.2 ± 105.5 vs 2859.4 ± 177.5 SC/mm3) in the gastrocnemius. SGI-1252 treatment suppressed MyoD (p = 0.013) and Myogenin (p<0.0001) expression in human primary myoblasts, resulting in reduced myogenic differentiation (p = 0.039).Orally delivered SGI-1252 was well tolerated, attenuates skeletal muscle STAT3 activity, and increases satellite cell content in mouse gastrocnemius muscle, likely by inhibiting myogenic progression."
https://openalex.org/W2808308408,"In vehicle dynamics, it is commonly understood that there is an inverse relationship between stability and maneuverability. However, animal studies have found that stability and maneuverability can coincide. In this study, we examine humans running a reactive agility obstacle and consider the relationship between observational perceived agility and balance, as well as the relationship between quantified surrogates of agility and balance. Recreational athletes (n = 18) completed the agility task while wearing inertial measurement units (IMUs) on their body. The task was also video-recorded. An observational study was completed by a separate group of adults (n = 33) that were asked to view the videos and score each athlete on a Likert scale for balance and for agility. The data from the body-worn IMUs were used to estimate quantified surrogate measures for agility and balance, and to assess if the relationship between the quantified agility and balance was in the same direction as the perceived relationship from the Likert scale responses. Results indicate that athletes that were given a higher Likert agility score were also given a higher balance score (rs = 0.75,p < 0.001). Quantitative surrogates of agility and balance also showed this same relationship. Additional insights on technique for this reactive agility task were informed by the quantitative surrogates. We observed the importance of stepping technique in achieving the faster completion times. The fast performing athletes spent a greater proportion of the task in double support and lower overall time in single support indicating increased periods of static stability. The fast performing athletes did not have a higher body speed, but performed the task with a more efficient technique, using foot placement to enable heading changes, and thus may have had a more efficient path. Similar to animal studies, people use technique to enable agile strategies while also enabling increased balance across the task."
https://openalex.org/W2807881084,"Amino acid mutations in proteins are random and those mutations which are beneficial or neutral survive during the course of evolution. Conservation or co-evolution analyses are performed on the multiple sequence alignment of homologous proteins to understand how important different amino acids or groups of them are. However, these traditional analyses do not explore the directed influence of amino acid mutations, such as compensatory effects. In this work we develop a method to capture the directed evolutionary impact of one amino acid on all other amino acids, and provide a visual network representation for it. The method developed for these directed networks of inter- and intra-protein evolutionary interactions can also be used for noting the differences in amino acid evolution between the control and experimental groups. The analysis is illustrated with a few examples, where the method identifies several directed interactions of functionally critical amino acids. The impact of an amino acid is quantified as the number of amino acids that are influenced as a consequence of its mutation, and it is intended to summarize the compensatory mutations in large evolutionary sequence data sets as well as to rationally identify targets for mutagenesis when their functional significance can not be assessed using structure or conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2808106466,"Evolution in the Hawaiian Islands has produced a unique avian assemblage. Unfortunately, many of these bird species are highly endangered or extinct. Despite numerous and increasing threats and great effort aimed at saving endemic birds, we lack basic science necessary for understanding many species of concern. One such species is the critically endangered Puaiohi (Myadestes palmeri), a rare songbird endemic to the island of Kaua‘i and the only remaining native thrush on the island. At present, the Puaiohi’s breeding population is estimated to be ~500 birds restricted to the Alaka‘i Wilderness Preserve. We collected demographic data from 2007–2012 and supplemented it with published sources. Using Vortex, we developed stochastic population models to represent Puaiohi population dynamics under current and potential management scenarios to determine management’s potential efficacy in aiding species recovery. Management scenarios modeled included rat control, habitat improvement, general survival facilitation, and provision of nest boxes. The model indicated a decline in abundance with a growth rate (r) of -0.267 under baseline conditions. Female and juvenile survival appeared to be the most influential parameters related to population growth and persistence, so management should focus on increasing female and juvenile Puaiohi survival. Rat control, even at more conservative levels, appeared to be the most effective method of increasing Puaiohi abundance. Our results indicate that practical, attainable management activities can increase Puaiohi and bring the species back from the brink of extinction. Such findings provide an example for other endangered species conservation efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2807776371,"Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) is a polyfunctional cytokine, involved in numerous regulatory effects in vivo and in vitro, varying from cell proliferation to differentiation, and has therapeutic potential for treating various diseases. In the current study, a COS-1 cell line overexpressing recombinant Buffalo LIF (rBuLIF) was established. The rBuLIF was purified to homogeneity from the total cell lysate of COS-1 cells using a two-step affinity chromatography. The purified LIF was confirmed by western blot and mass spectrometer (MS/MS). Particularly, high-resolution MS has identified the rBuLIF with 73% of sequence coverage with highest confidence parameters and with the search engine score of 4580. We determined the molecular weight of rBuLIF protein to be 58.99 kDa and 48.9 kDa with and without glycosylation, respectively. Moreover, the purified rBuLIF was verified to be functionally active by measuring the growth inhibition of M1 myeloid leukemia cells, revealing a maximum inhibition at 72 hours and half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 0.0555 ng/ml, corresponding to a specific activity of >1.6×107 units/mg. Next, we evaluated the effect of rBuLIF on buffalo mammary epithelial cell lines for its role in involution and also identified the IC50 value for BuMEC migrating cells to be 77.8 ng/ml. Additionally, the treatment of MECs (BuMEC and EpH4) displayed significant (P < 0.05) reduction in growth progression, as confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis, suggesting its strong involvement in the involution of the mammary gland in vivo. Thus, we conclude that the glycosylated rBuLIF, purified from COS-1 cells was found to be functionally active as its natural counterpart."
https://openalex.org/W2807830698,"Several studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of statins in Korean and Asian patients. However, most previous studies only observed the percent reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and did not consider the effects of various patient conditions simultaneously, such as abnormal test results, patient demographics, and prescribed drugs before taking a statin. Moreover, the characteristics of the patients whose percent reduction in LDL-C was higher than expected were not provided. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to derive meaningful phenotypes by using tensor factorization to observe the characteristics of the patients whose percent reduction in LDL-C was higher than expected among patients taking moderate-intensity statins. In addition, we used the derived phenotypes to predict how much the LDL-C levels of new patients decreased. We consequently identified eight phenotypes that represented the characteristics of the patients whose percent reduction in LDL-C was higher than expected. Moreover, the latent representations of the derived phenotypes achieved prediction performance similar to that obtained using the raw data. These results demonstrate that the derived phenotypes and latent representations are useful tools for observing the characteristics of patients and predicting LDL-C levels. Additionally, our findings provide direction on how to conduct clinical studies in the future."

An adapted version of the ""Anxiety Due to Territory and Space Intrusion Questionnaire"" was applied with patients hospitalized in the internal medicine and maternity wards and in the ward for patients with private health insurance of a university hospital in the state of São Paulo.The sample consisted of 300 patients. The mean total score of the questionnaire administered was 143.58 (SD = 18.88). The mean subscale scores for territorial space and personal space invasion were 89.10 (SD = 15.29) and 54.48 (SD = 10.58), respectively. The invasion of territorial space differed significantly between patients with and without children (p = 0.02) and for the number of people living in the residence (p < 0.01).Attitudes of the nursing staff, such as touching the patient's possessions without permission and exposing the patient, caused discomfort and violated patient privacy. Patients who were lonelier and had more privacy at home perceived greater invasion of their territorial space by the nursing professionals."
https://openalex.org/W2808676994,"The effectiveness of infectious disease control depends on the ability of health managers to act in a coordinated way. However, with regards to non-notifiable animal diseases, farmers individually decide whether or not to implement control measures, leading to positive and negative externalities for connected farms and possibly impairing disease control at a regional scale. Our objective was to facilitate the identification of optimal incentive schemes at a collective level, adaptive to the epidemiological situation, and minimizing the economic costs due to a disease and its control. We proposed a modelling framework based on Markov Decision Processes (MDP) to identify effective strategies to control PorcineReproductive andRespiratorySyndrome (PRRS), a worldwide endemicinfectiousdisease thatsignificantly impactspig farmproductivity. Using a stochastic discrete-time compartmental model representing PRRS virus spread and control within a group of pig herds, we defined the associated MDP. Using a decision-tree framework, we translated the optimal policy into a limited number of rules providing actions to be performed per 6-month time-step according to the observed system state. We evaluated the effect of varying costs and transition probabilities on optimal policy and epidemiological results. We finally identifiedan adaptive policy that gave the best net financial benefit. The proposed framework is a tool for decision support as it allows decision-makers to identify the optimal policy and to assess its robustness to variations in the values of parameters representing an impact of incentives on farmers' decisions."

TSPO has been linked to a number of disorders, and it is recognised as a promising drug target with a range of potential medical applications. Structural and biochemical characterisation of a mammalian TSPO requires expression and purification of the protein of high quality in sufficiently large quantities. Here we describe detailed procedures for heterologous expression and purification of mammalian TSPO in HEK293 cells. We demonstrate that the established procedures can be used for untagged TSPO as well as for C-terminally fused TSPO constructs. Our protocol can be routinely used to generate high-quality TSPO preparations for biochemical and structural studies."

Based on SA samples collected in 2016, SA was divided into the ""dwarf"" form (DF) and ""medium"" form (MF). To understand the changes in gastrointestinal function in SA during sexual maturation, we undertook transcriptomic analyses of the stomach and intestine tissues of the mature and immature DF and MF of SA using the deep-sequencing platform Illumina HiSeq™. We exploited a high-throughput method to delineate differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the DF and MF of SA. A total of 135464 unigenes (68627 unigenes of the DG and 66837 unigenes of the MF) were generated. We identified 7965 and 4051 relative DEGs in the intestine and stomach tissues of the mature DF of SA compared with those of the immature DF of SA; and 22138 and 18460 DEGs in the intestine and stomach of the mature MF of SA compared with those of the immature MF of SA. Gastrointestinal function related to the metabolism of lipids, amino acids, glucose, and energy were changed in SA during sexual maturation. This work is the first to identify a set of genes associated with gastrointestinal function during sexual maturation in SA."
https://openalex.org/W2808636303,"In this paper, we report data on the development of Korean infants’ perception of a rare fricative phoneme distinction. Korean fricative consonants have received much interest in the linguistic community due to the language’s distinct categorization of sounds. Unlike many fricative contrasts utilized in most of the world’s languages, Korean fricatives (/s*/-/s/) are all voiceless. Moreover, compared with other sound categories, fricatives have received very little attention in the speech perception development field and no studies thus far have examined Korean infants’ development of native phonology in this domain. Using a visual habituation paradigm, we tested 4‒6-month-old and 7‒9-month-old Korean infants on their abilities to discriminate the Korean fricative pair in the [a] vowel context, /s*a/-/sa/, which can be distinguished based on acoustic cues, such as the durations of aspiration and frication noise. Korean infants older than 7 months were able to reliably discriminate the fricative pair but younger infants did not show clear signs of such discrimination. These results add to the growing evidence that there are native sound contrasts infants cannot discriminate early on without a certain amount of language exposure, providing further data to help delineate the specific nature of early perceptual capacity."
https://openalex.org/W2808021401,"This paper proposes a discrete particle model based on the random-walk theory for simulating cement infiltration within open-cell structures to prevent osteoporotic proximal femur fractures. Model parameters consider the cement viscosity (high and low) and the desired direction of injection (vertical and diagonal). In vitro and in silico characterizations of augmented open-cell structures validated the computational model and quantified the improved mechanical properties (Young's modulus) of the augmented specimens. The cement injection pattern was successfully predicted in all the simulated cases. All the augmented specimens exhibited enhanced mechanical properties computationally and experimentally (maximum improvements of 237.95 ± 12.91% and 246.85 ± 35.57%, respectively). The open-cell structures with high porosity fraction showed a considerable increase in mechanical properties. Cement augmentation in low porosity fraction specimens resulted in a lesser increase in mechanical properties. The results suggest that the proposed discrete particle model is adequate for use as a femoroplasty planning framework."
