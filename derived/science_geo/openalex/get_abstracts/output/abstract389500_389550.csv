https://openalex.org/W2048720598,"THE proteolytic activity displayed by malignant tumour cells in vitro has often been the main hindrance to cultivating permanent strains of these cells. The liquefaction of the culture medium by the malignant cells, which has attracted much attention, suggested to me years ago1 that the proteolytic activity of the tumour cells was fully, or in part, responsible for their malignant properties. By the liquefaction the healthy tissue cells in the neighbourhood are deprived of their solid supports, and consequently the way is prepared for further infiltration deep into the normal tissues."

https://openalex.org/W2074923209,"OF late there has been an intense search for antibacterial substances effective against acid-fast bacteria, particularly Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Apart from the chemotherapeutic work on sulphones and related compounds, a number of antibiotics of fungal origin have been reported1–7. However, antibacterials from the higher plants do not appear to have been tested against Mycobacterium tuberculosis."

https://openalex.org/W2036240055,"A COMPOUND between sucrose and sodium chloride has been described by a number of investigators, the most complete account being that of Gill1, who ascribed to it the formula C12H22O11.NaCl.2H2O. Gill also obtained addition compounds with sodium bromide and sodium iodide, to which he ascribed the formulæ 2C12H22O11.2NaBr.3H2O and 2C12H22O11.3NaI.3H2O. In the course of an investigation of sucrose by the methods of X-ray crystallography, it became of interest to investigate these compounds more fully."

https://openalex.org/W1987045692,"IN a recent communication from Australia by Dick and Bull1, the view was expressed that “an increase in the molybdenum content of the pasture may possibly explain the seeming anomaly of a copper deficiency in sheep, for example, grazing on pastures which show by ordinary chemical analysis a copper concentration within normal limits”. Since the references are to work in Britain in connexion with a disease of lambs known as swayback, the following may be of interest."
https://openalex.org/W2004357346,THE usual methods of studying the water metabolism of the red corpuscles always change the salt concentration of the surrounding medium. It has not yet been possible to follow the passage of water in and out under normal isotonic conditions. This can be done now by using heavy water.

https://openalex.org/W2394491350,"ALCOHOLIC extracts of fresh spleen from cattle contain high amounts, up to 10 µgm. adrenaline equivalents per gm. tissue, of a cardio-accelerator and blood-pressure raising substance, showing the characteristic properties of a sympathomometic catechol compound1. The active substance was taken up in an ether solution of organ lipids and extracted from this with a 5–10 per cent solution of sodium sulphate. A further purification was attained by treatment with sublimate in alcohol, which left the active substance in the filtrate. The purified extract was found to differ from adrenaline in the following respects. Ergotamine, in a dose which inhibited or reversed the action of adrenaline, was not equally effective in inhibiting the pressor action on the cat's blood-pressure ; the isolated uterus of the virgin or non-pregnant cat was rather less inhibited than by an equipressor dose of adrenaline, and the same applied to the isolated intestine of the rabbit. The relative dilating effect on the iris was considerably greater with adrenaline. Whereas equipressor doses of adrenaline and the spleen pressor substance gave similar catechol reactions with ferric chloride, the fluorescence reaction in alkaline solution2 was absent in purified spleen extracts. The active substance in spleen thus conforms better with an amino-base, such as nor-adrenaline, than with adrenaline."
https://openalex.org/W1984151437,"THE study of selective feeding2-5 of soil protozoa, especially amœbæ on a large number of bacterial strains, led to the development of an improved method6 of counting soil Protozoa. In the past, dilution methods7 of estimating Protozoa numbers have suffered, first from having too few replicates, and secondly from the use of unspecified bacterial food. These two difficulties have been met in the method described, the first by making a number of separate cultures enclosed by glass rings in each petri dish, and the second by using, as food supply, pure cultures of bacteria known to be edible to Protozoa. These food bacteria have in the past6 been spread on the surface of washed agar made up with 0.5 percent sodium chloride. It has been found, however, that silica jelly may be more advantageously used for two main reasons. First, it further reduces the growth of organisms coming in with the inoculum ; and secondly, it has another advantage over agar because it does not allow the growth of agar-liquefying organisms which may be abundantly present in certain substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2027912402,"Astwood and Jones1, and Talbot et al.2, have shown that not more than about 70 per cent of the theoretical amount of pregnanediol can be obtained from sodium pregnanediol glucuronidate after hydrolysis with hydrochloric acid. Using a colorimetric method of determining pregnanediol involving the development of a yellow colour on treatment with concentrated sulphuric acid, which is essentially similar to the method employed by Talbot et al., we have confirmed this finding. In the belief that the low yield of pregnanediol obtainable from the glucuronide was due to partial destruction in side-reactions during the hydrolysis, we decided to attempt the isolation and identification of the destruction products."
https://openalex.org/W2049043164,"THE ionic composition of the circulating fluids is very uniform throughout the animal kingdom: it shows especially a marked excess of sodium over potassium ions. The insects were the only supposed exception. According to the analyses of several authors1, their coelomic fluid was thought to contain an excess of potassium, the Na/K ratio being less than unity."

https://openalex.org/W2033056806,"PENICILLIN was first obtained from nutrient broth medium by Sir Alexander Fleming. For systematic investigation of this important antibacterial substance, modified Czapek-Dox medium, with glucose as the sole source of carbon, was used by Clutterbuck, Lovell and Raistrick in 1932. Since then, various modifications of Czapek-Dox medium have been tried either to enhance the growth of the mould or to increase the yield of penicillin. But in all these modifications, either sugar or carbohydrate has been chosen as the principal source of carbon. In our experiments with different synthetic liquid media for producing penicillin, we have observed that glycerine can effectively replace either sugar or carbohydrate, hitherto exclusively employed in the liquid media. This observation has an important bearing on commercial production, as glycerine is much cheaper than either glucose or lactose; if it could be suitably adopted for large-scale manufacture, it would eventually reduce considerably the cost of penicillin."

https://openalex.org/W2044584608,"DURING the drying of vegetables in a hot-air current, a loss in the ascorbic acid contents will generally be found. This is largely due to the action of oxidizing enzymes, which must therefore be destroyed if the losses are to be diminished. This can be dope by treating the vegetables in hot water or steam (so-called scalding or blanching), but by this process the non-enzymic oxidation of the ascorbic acid is accelerated on account of the rise in temperature, and so the treatment must be followed immediately by drying."

Using this property for a process of purification, a quantitative method has been developed for the estimation of vitamin B1 in wheat products."

Many isomerides of sulphapyridine have been made and it has been found that the three isomeric derivatives from 3-aminopyridine (3-(o-, m- and p-aminobenzenesulphonamido)pyri-dine) are stable to hot mineral acids. All but one of the derivatives of 2- and 4-aminopyridine which were tested were found to be more or less easily broken down to the corresponding aminopyridine and an aminobenzene sulphonic acid as is shown below: Conditions, sulphonamide refluxed for 30 min. with 15 percent aqueous hydrochloric acid. 2-(o-aminobenzenesulphonamido)pyridine 35 percent unchanged 2-(p-aminobenzenesulphonamido)pyridine Complete hydrolysis. 4-(p-aminobenzenesulphonamido)pyridine Complete hydrolysis."

https://openalex.org/W4247586278,"THE phenomenon of obligate parasitism is well known among the fungi, particularly the rusts and the powdery mildews. That the rust derives its nutrients from the host has been accepted a priori, since no other source of food for the fungus was possible. Yet the fact that the nutrients from the soil were furnished to the fungus through the plant system has not been demonstrated. Radio-phosphorus, P32, which is not changed by the plant, furnished a simple means of showing that the nutrient actually comes through the host plant."
