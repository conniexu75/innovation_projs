https://openalex.org/W2076743180,"An empirical model of variations in the total solar irradiance caused by observed changes in photospheric magnetic activity between 1874 and 1988 is presented. The model provides a remarkably good representation of the irradiance variations observed by satellite-borne radiometers between 1980 and 1988. It suggests that the mean total irradiance has been rising steadily since about 1945, with the largest peak so far at about 1980 and another large peak expected during the current solar cycle 22. But it is doubtful whether even this rise can contribute significantly to global warming, unless the temperature increase of about 0.02 degrees C that it produces in current energy balance models seriously underestimates the sensitivity of climate to solar irradiance changes."

This relation is apparently due to extinction, which is more rapid the smaller the island. The turnover resulting from extinction and replacement appears to be far more rapid than hitherto suspected."
https://openalex.org/W1969225013,"Pristane (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane) has been isolated from two recent marine sediments. Unlike their ancient counterparts, these sediments contain no detectable phytane. These two facts suggest a biochemical origin for at least a fraction of the sedimentary pristane and a later, geochemical formation of phytane. Commercial reagent-grade solvents (pentane, isooctane, methanol) contain appreciable quantities of fossil pristane and probably phytane."
https://openalex.org/W2010837109,"Research begun in the early 1970s on geonium is reviewed. Genoium is a man-made atom, created at liquid-helium temperature in ultrahigh vacuum from an individual electron in magnetic and electric trapping fields. For this atom the electron gyromagnetic ratio g = 2. 000 000 000 110(60) has been measured in microwave spectroscopy experiments after subtraction of quantum electrodynamics shifts. The g - g(Dirac) = 11 x 10(-11) excess over the value g(Dirac) = 2 for the theoretical Dirac point electron suggests for the electron of nature a corresponding excess radius R(e) - R(Dirac) over the Dirac radius R(Dirac) = 0 and a spatial structure. From a plot of measured g and R values for the near-Dirac particles electron, proton, triton, and helium-3 an electron radius R(e) approximately 10(-20) centimeter is extrapolated. In a speculation, the triton-proton-quark model has been extended to the electron, to a succession of subquarks, and finally to the ""cosmon."" Rapid decay of a cosmon-anticosmon pair created from the ""nothing"" state in a spontaneous quantum jump initiated the Big Bang."

No change in host DNA was found within 6 days after inoculation, but there were decreases in histones and marked increases in RNA and acidic proteins as early as 2 days after inoculation."
https://openalex.org/W1975776376,"Nonenzymatic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide proceeded more rapidly in ice than in liquid water. At 5 × 10-7M ferric chloride or 10-8M cupric chloride, breakdown of hydrogen peroxide was significant at -11° and -18° but negligible at +1°C. Ascorbic acid oxidation was faster in ice both with or without added metal ion. Nonparallel effects of metals and pH indicate mechanism changes in ice."
https://openalex.org/W2026018980,High hydrostatic pressure applied to the naupliar larval stages of the marine copepod Tigriopus californicus converts some individuals that would have become males into females. The copepodid stages are not sensitive to pressure-induced conversion.

The heat-induced phloem callose appears to have been responsible for part of this decrease; we conclude, therefore, that lateral movement from sieve tubes was along protoplasmic connections."
https://openalex.org/W2039365551,"Direct observations of CuO(2) sheet defect structures in superconducting La(2-x)Sr(x)CuO(4), with x in the range 0.05 </= x </= 0.15, are reported. Electron microscopy shows that extended line defects are generated in {010} planes, along <206> crystallographic directions, by a pure shear mechanism along the edge of the octahedral copper-oxygen units. The line defects are partial screw dislocations, with characteristic displacement vectors of the type <(a/2), 0, (c/6)>, bounding the stacking faults. The existence of this type of defect demonstrates that there is an oxygen deficiency within the CuO(2) layers. However, unlike the open ReO(3) type-related structures, the packing density of the K(2)NiF(4) structure necessarily requires that anion defects be accompanied by the loss of cations of the A type (lanthanum, strontium). Under identical synthesis conditions, no defects are observed in the parent compound La(2)CuO(4)."

This radioactive tag, introduced into the river by nuclear reactors at Hanford, Washington, promises to provide a useful oceanographic tool for determining rates of transport and mixing, and for identifying plume waters in the presence of other sources of fresh water."

https://openalex.org/W2066141377,"Nineteen eight-nine ranks as one of the warmest years on record despite the chill of unusually cool water in the tropical Pacific. The continued robustness of the warming trend that began in the mid-1970s lends support to claims that an intensifying greenhouse effect is behind it all, although that case has not yet been made definitively. Even at the current rate of global warming it will take another 10 years or so to be confident that the greenhouse effect is with us. Although the global warming trend is consistent with an increasing contribution by the greenhouse effect, direct signs that the greenhouse effect is intensifying are still hard to come by in the temperature record. Greenhouse models agree that if that is happening, the temperature increase should be most pronounced around the Arctic. Alaska, northwestern Canada, and northern Siberia warmed sharply in the 1980s, but the region from eastern Canada through Greenland and into Scandinavia cooled markedly."
