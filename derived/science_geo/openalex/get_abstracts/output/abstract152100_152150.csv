https://openalex.org/W2062570379,"The adipocyte-derived hormone leptin signals the status of body energy stores by activating the long form of the leptin receptor (LRb). Activation of LRb results in the activation of the associated Jak2 tyrosine kinase and the transmission of downstream phosphotyrosine-dependent signals. We have investigated the signaling function of mutant LRb intracellular domains under the control of the extracellular erythropoietin (Epo) receptor. By using this system, we confirm that two tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain of murine LRb become phosphorylated to mediate LRb signaling; Tyr(985) controls the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2, and Tyr(1138) controls STAT3 activation. We furthermore investigated the mechanisms by which LRb controls downstream ERK activation and c-fos and SOCS3 message accumulation. Tyr(985)-mediated recruitment of SHP-2 does not alter tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 or STAT3 but results in GRB-2 binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated SHP-2 and is required for the majority of ERK activation during LRb signaling. Tyr(985) and ERK activation similarly mediate c-fos mRNA accumulation. In contrast, SOCS3 mRNA accumulation requires Tyr(1138)-mediated STAT3 activation. Thus, the two LRb tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated during receptor activation mediate distinct signaling pathways as follows: SHP-2 binding to Tyr(985) positively regulates the ERK --> c-fos pathway, and STAT3 binding to Tyr(1138) mediates the inhibitory SOCS3 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2074045859,"We used muscle contraction, which increases fatty acid oxidation, as a model to determine whether fatty acid transport is acutely regulated by fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36). Palmitate uptake by giant vesicles, obtained from skeletal muscle, was increased by muscle contraction. Kinetic studies indicated that muscle contraction increased V max, butKm remained unaltered. Sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate, a specific inhibitor of FAT/CD36, fully blocked the contraction-induced increase in palmitate uptake. In giant vesicles from contracting muscles, plasma membrane FAT/CD36 was also increased in parallel with the increase in long chain fatty acid uptake. Further studies showed that like GLUT-4, FAT/CD36 is located in both the plasma membrane and intracellularly (endosomally). With muscle contraction, FAT/CD36 at the surface of the muscle was increased, while concomitantly, FAT/CD36 in the intracellular pool was reduced. Similar responses were observed for GLUT-4. We conclude that fatty acid uptake is subject to short term regulation by muscle contraction and involves the translocation of FAT/CD36 from intracellular stores to the sarcolemma, analogous to the regulation of glucose uptake by GLUT-4.

In addition, LCFAs represent an important source of energy for tissues such as skeletal muscle and the heart (for review, see Refs. 6.van der Vusse G.J. Glatz J.F.C. Stam H.C.G. Reneman R.S. Physiol.

LCFAs can enter cells via both passive diffusion and a protein-mediated mechanism (for review, see Ref. 8.Abumrad N.A. Harmon C. Ibrahimi A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2309-2318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the past few years a number of putative LCFA transporter proteins have also been identified. Fatty acid translocase, the rat homolog of human glycoprotein IV or CD36 (FAT/CD36) (9.Abumrad N.A. El-Maghrabi M.R. Amri E.-Z. Lopez E. Grimaldi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17665-17668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and fatty acid transport protein (FATP) (5.Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar) are integral membrane proteins, whereas the plasma membrane-bound fatty acid-binding protein (FABPpm) (10.Isola L.M.

Each of these proteins can increase LCFA uptake when expressed in various cell lines (5.Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 10.Isola L.M. Zhou S.L. Kiang C.L. Stump D.D. Bradbury M.W. Berk P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lopez E. Grimaldi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17665-17668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The physiologic function and regulation of these putative fatty acid transporters remain largely unknown. A recent study has shown that FATP mRNA and mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase mRNA (identical to FABPpm; see Ref. 10.Isola L.M. Zhou S.L. Kiang C.L. Stump D.D. Bradbury M.W. Berk P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

But no changes in fatty acid uptake were observed in hepatocytes in these animals (13.Berk P.D. Zhou S.-L. Kiang C.-L. Stump D. Bradbury M. Isola L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8830-8835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We have shown recently that chronic muscle contraction (7 days) results in the overexpression of FAT/CD36 along with a concomitant increase in LCFA uptake into giant sarcolemmal vesicles (14.Bonen A. Dyck D.J. Ibrahimi A. Abumrad N.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E642-E649PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, in transgenic mice that overexpress FAT/CD36, LCFA oxidation is increased (15.Ibrahimi A. Bonen A. Blinn W.D. Hajri T. Li X. Zhong K. Cameron R. Abumrad N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26761-26766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). These studies (13.Berk P.D. Zhou S.-L. Kiang C.-L. Stump D. Bradbury M. Isola L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8830-8835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 14.Bonen A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 26761-26766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) indicate that fatty acid uptake is a physiologically regulatable process involving tissue-specific and LCFA transporter-specific responses. Whether LCFA uptake can also be regulated acutely (i.e.within minutes) by LCFA transport proteins is not known. However, this can be examined in skeletal muscle. LCFAs are a key oxidizable substrate for skeletal muscle (see Ref. 7.van der Vusse G.J. Reneman R.S. Rowell L.B. Shepherd J.T. Handbook of Physiology. Exercise: Regulation and Integration of Multiple Systems. American Physiological Society, Bethesda, MD1996: 952-994Google Scholar), and because of its mass (40% of body weight) and highly variable metabolic rate, skeletal muscle is a principal site for the removal of LCFAs from the circulation. Moreover, LCFA uptake and metabolism can be increased rapidly in contracting muscle (16.Dyck D.J. Bonen A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E888-E896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Gorski J. Bonen A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 166: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This is unlikely to be caused by an increased rate of diffusion because the LCFA gradient across the plasma membrane is very high, even in resting muscles (18.van der Vusse G.J. Roemen T.H.M. J. Appl. Physiol. 1995; 78: 1839-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It would seem therefore that a rapid increase in LCFA uptake may be mediated, in an unknown manner, by one or more of the LCFA transporters. It is well known that glucose uptake is increased when GLUT-4 is translocated to the plasma membrane. Whether a similar mechanism can promote LCFA uptake is not known. However, it is possible that FAT/CD36 can be translocated because this protein was present in the plasma membrane as well as in high and low density microsomal fractions in Ob17PY fibroblasts that overexpressed FAT/CD36 (11.Ibrahimi A. Sfeir Z. Magharaine H. Amri E.Z. Grimaldi P. Abumrad N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2646-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that the rapid, contraction-induced increase in LCFA uptake by intact muscle (17.Gorski J. Bonen A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 166: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) may have been mediated by the translocation of FAT/CD36, analogous to the contraction-stimulated translocation of GLUT-4 to the surface of this tissue (19.Goodyear L.J. Hirshman M.F. Horton E.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: E795-E799PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Roy D. Johannsson E. Bonen A. Marette A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E688-E694PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we have examined the acute (1–30 min) contraction-induced uptake of palmitate by giant sarcolemmal vesicles, a preparation that divorces LCFA uptake from its metabolism and is suitable for the study of LCFA transport across the sarcolemma (20.Roy D. Johannsson E. Bonen A. Marette A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E688-E694PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Bonen A. Luiken J.J.F.P. Lui S. Dyck D.J. Kiens B. Kristiansen S. Turcotte L. van der Vusse G.J. Glatz J.F.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E471-E478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we have used a muscle fractionation procedure to detect surface and intracellular pools of FAT/CD36. These studies have shown, for the first time, that LCFA uptake in muscle tissue is subject to short term regulation by muscle contraction and involves the translocation of FAT/CD36 from intracellular stores to the sarcolemma, analogous to the regulation of glucose uptake by GLUT-4. Female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were used in all experiments (200–250 g). Animals were housed in a controlled environment on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and fed Purina rat chow ad libitum. All procedures were approved by the animal care committee at the University of Waterloo. Animals were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (6 mg/100 g of body mass) prior to all experimental procedures. To examine the transport of fatty acids across the plasma membranes, giant sarcolemmal vesicles were obtained from resting and contracting rat hind limb skeletal muscles. While the animal was under anesthesia a small incision was made in one hind limb, and stimulating electrodes were placed on the exposed sciatic nerve. The contralateral muscles in the same animal served as resting controls in all experiments. Muscle contraction consisted of stimulating the sciatic nerve in one hind limb (10–20 V; 100 Hz, 100-ms trains, 20 tetani/min for 30 min (unless otherwise noted). Immediately after the contraction (unless otherwise noted) the contracting muscles and the contralateral resting muscles were removed for the preparation of giant sarcolemmal vesicles (see below). Several different experiments were performed. In one series of experiments we examined palmitate uptake into giant sarcolemmal vesicles at selected times during muscle contraction (min 1, 5, and 30) as well as 20 and 45 min after the muscle contraction had ceased. In other experiments we examined the effects of different rates of muscle contraction (0, 20, and 40 tetani/min) on palmitate uptake by giant sarcolemmal vesicles. We also examined the effects of muscle contraction (20 tetani/min) on the kinetics of palmitate uptake into giant sarcolemmal vesicles. Finally, we examined whether the contraction-induced increases in vesicular palmitate uptake were altered by sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate (SSO), a nonpermeable sulfosuccinimidyl derivative of LCFA which binds covalently to FAT/CD36 (11.Ibrahimi A. Sfeir Z. Magharaine H. Amri E.Z. Grimaldi P. Abumrad N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2646-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 23.Harmon C.M. Luce P. Beth A.H. Abumrad N.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 121: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) (purity > 90%, gift from Dr. N. A. Abumrad, SUNY Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY). Vesicles from resting and contracting muscles were prepared as we have described recently (21.Bonen A. Luiken J.J.F.P. Lui S. Dyck D.J. Kiens B. Kristiansen S. Turcotte L. van der Vusse G.J. Glatz J.F.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E471-E478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Luiken J.J.F.P. Turcotte L.P. Bonen A. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1007-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, rat hind limb muscles were cut into thin layers (∼1–3 mm thick) and incubated for 1 h at 34 °C in 140 mm KCl and 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 150 units/ml collagenase, and 0.01 g/ml aprotinin. The muscle was then washed with KCl/MOPS and 10 mm EDTA, and the supernatant was collected. Percoll (final concentration 16%) and aprotinin were added to the supernatant. This supernatant was placed at the bottom of a density gradient consisting of a 3-ml middle layer of 4% Nycodenz (w/v) and a 1-ml KCl/MOPS upper layer. The samples were spun at 60 ×g for 45 min at room temperature. After centrifugation the vesicles were harvested from the interface of the two upper solutions. The vesicles were diluted in KCl/MOPS and recentrifuged at 800 ×g for 30 min. Vesicles were used immediately for transport experiments. Vesicles were also prepared and stored at −80 °C for protein and marker enzyme analysis. Palmitate uptake was measured by the addition of unlabeled palmitate (Sigma) and 0.3 μCi of [3H]palmitate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 0.06 μCi of [14C]mannitol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a 0.1% bovine serum albumin KCl/MOPS solution to 40 μl of vesicles (∼80 μg of protein). Mannitol served as an extracellular space marker. The reaction was carried out at room temperature for 15 s unless otherwise noted. Palmitate uptake was terminated by the addition of 1.4 ml of ice-cold KCl/MOPS containing 2.5 mm HgCl and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The sample was centrifuged quickly at maximal speed in a microcentrifuge for 1 min. The supernatant was discarded, and radioactivity was determined in the tip of the tube. Nonspecific uptake was measured by adding the stop solution to the membrane before the addition of the isotopes. When we examined the effects of the FAT/CD36 inhibitor SSO, vesicles were preincubated with optimal quantities of SSO (50 μg; see Ref. 22.Luiken J.J.F.P. Turcotte L.P. Bonen A. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1007-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 30 min and low concentrations of bovine serum albumin (0.05%). Thereafter, vesicles were washed before palmitate uptake studies were performed. To determine the subcellular location of FAT/CD36 and its redistribution in contracting muscles we fractionated resting and contracting (30 min) skeletal muscle homogenates using procedures to separate surface and intracellular compartments of this tissue (20.Roy D. Johannsson E. Bonen A. Marette A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E688-E694PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Dombrowski L. Roy D. Marcotte B. Marette A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E667-E676PubMed Google Scholar) as well as modification of a continuous Percoll gradient procedure used previously (25.Luiken J.J.F.P. Aerts J.M.F.G. Meijer A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 564-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, control and 30-min contracting hind limb muscles (1.2–1.5 g) were minced for 5 min in 10 mm NaHCO3 (pH 7.0), 0.25m sucrose, 5 mm NaN3, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer A). The minced muscles were homogenized (1 g/15-ml dilution) using a Polytron (Brinkmann Instruments) at a low setting of 3 for 5 × 1 s. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 1,300 × gfor 10 min. The supernatant was saved, and the low speed pellets were resuspended in buffer A (2 g/15 ml), homogenized, and centrifuged again. Both supernatant fractions were pooled. The low-speed pellet was resuspended in 0.5 m LiBr, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.5), and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer B) at a ratio of 1 g of tissue/25 ml and stirred for 4 h. The pooled 1,300 × g supernatant fractions were centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 10 min. The 9,000 × gpellet was saved, and the supernatant was spun at 190,000 ×g for 1 h. The 190,000 × g pellet was resuspended in 800 μl of buffer A by five strokes using a tightly fitting Potter-Elvehjem glass homogenizer and subjected to a continuous Percoll gradient as described below. The LiBr-treated membranes were centrifuged first at 1,200 × g for 5 min and then at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The LiBr-10,000 ×g pellet was saved. The supernatant fraction was centrifuged at 190,000 × g for 1 h. The LiBr-190,000 ×g pellet was resuspended in 1.2 ml of buffer A by 40 strokes using a tightly fitting Potter-Elvehjem glass homogenizer. 500 μl of both the 190,000 × g pellet and the LiBr-190,000 × g pellet were layered on top of a 7-ml Percoll suspension (60%) in 120 mm KCl, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 5 mm NaN3, and 0.5 mm EGTA (initial density 1.12 g/ml), resting on a cushion of 1 ml of 1.25 msucrose. The resulting gradients were centrifuged at 62,000 ×g for 1 h. After centrifugation, 0.5-ml fractions were collected starting from the top of the tubes. All procedures were performed at 0 °C. The fractions were stored at −80 °C and upon thawing, used for enzyme assays (5′-nucleotidase) and for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting. Prior to electrophoresis, Percoll particles were removed by alkalinizing aliquots of the fractions to pH 12.0 by the addition of NaOH, followed by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 2 min. The supernatant was then neutralized to pH 7–8 by the addition of HCl. In the resulting Percoll-free fraction samples, the protein content was determined by the BCA method, and 5 μg of each fraction was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. We examined the effects of muscle contraction and the recovery from muscle contraction on the appearance of the fatty acid transport protein FAT/CD36 in the plasma membrane of the giant sarcolemmal vesicles. For these purposes we separated proteins using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting as we have described recently (21.Bonen A. Luiken J.J.F.P. Lui S. Dyck D.J. Kiens B.

Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1007-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To detect FAT/CD36 we used MO-25 produced by one of our laboratories (26.Matsuno K. Diaz-Ricard M. Montgomery R.R. Aster T. Jamieson G.A. Tandon N.N. Br. J. Haematol. 1996; 92: 960-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We also used antibodies to the monocarboxylate transporter protein 1 (MCT1) (a gift from Dr. A. P. Halestrap, University of Bristol, Bristol, U. K.) (27.McCullagh K.J.A. Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. O'Brien M. Bonen A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E143-E150PubMed Google Scholar,28.McCullagh K.J.A. Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Tipton K.F. O'Brien M. Bonen A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E239-E246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the glucose transporters GLUT-1 and GLUT-4 (East Acres Biologicals) to ascertain that the modified fractionation procedures could detect the well known contraction-induced GLUT-4 translocation and the lack of GLUT-1 translocation, because GLUT-1 is confined to the surface of the muscle (for review, see Refs. 29.Goodyear L.J. Kahn B.B. Annu. Rev. Med. 1998; 49: 235-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar and 30.Hayashi T. Wojtaszewski J.F.P. Goodyear L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E1039-E1051PubMed Google Scholar). MCT1 is also confined to the plasma membrane and is not altered by muscle contraction. 2A. Bonen, unpublished data. Uptake of palmitate by giant vesicles prepared from contracting muscles was increased (Fig. 1 A,p < 0.05). An increase was already apparent by 1 min (+20%), and after 5 min the transport rate was increased significantly (+29%) from that observed in control muscles (p < 0.05, Fig. 1 A). By the end of the 30-min contraction period the palmitate uptake had increased even further (+75%) (p < 0.05). After muscle contraction was terminated the rate of palmitate uptake was reduced in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1 A) (p < 0.05). 50 min after the contraction had ended, palmitate uptake had returned to levels observed at rest (p > 0.05). To examine the relationship between the rate of muscle contraction and vesicular palmitate uptake, muscles remained at rest, or they were stimulated to contract at either 20 or 40 tetani/min. The increase in palmitate uptake increased in direct proportion to the rate of muscle stimulation (Fig. 1 B). At 20 and 40 tetani/min the palmitate uptake rates were increased 28% (p < 0.05) and +56% (p < 0.05), respectively, compared with the uptake rates in resting control muscles (Fig. 1 B). To examine the effects of muscle contraction on the kinetics of palmitate uptake, rat hind limb muscles remained at rest or were stimulated at 20 tetani/min. Palmitate uptake (V max), by vesicles prepared from contracting muscles, was increased ∼40% (p < 0.05). The Km (∼ 15 nm) was not altered (Fig. 2). To determine if the contraction-induced increase in palmitate uptake was protein-mediated we compared palmitate uptake at rest and at the end of the 30-min contraction, either in the absence or presence of SSO, which binds covalently (23.Harmon C.M. Luce P. Beth A.H. Abumrad N.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 121: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 31.Harmon C.M. Luce P. Abumrad N.A. Biochem. Soc.

Biol. 1993; 133: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and specifically only to FAT/CD36 (22.Luiken J.J.F.P. Turcotte L.P. Bonen A. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1007-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For these purposes vesicles were obtained from resting and contracting muscles. The vesicles from each treatment were then subdivided into two pools, those that were pretreated with SSO and those that were not. In the absence of SSO there was a contraction-induced increase in palmitate uptake (+47%,p < 0.05) (Fig. 3). In vesicles from resting muscles, SSO reduced vesicular palmitate uptake by 30% (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3). In vesicles obtained from contracting muscles, SSO reduced palmitate uptake by 58% (p < 0.05). Palmitate uptake rates did not differ (p > 0.05) in SSO-treated vesicles obtained from resting and contracting muscles (Fig. 3). Thus, SSO was able to block completely the increase in the contraction-induced vesicular palmitate uptake (Fig. 3). To compare the changes in palmitate palmitate uptake with the changes in FAT/CD36, each of these parameters was determined in giant vesicles obtained from muscles at rest, at the end of 30-min contraction, and after recovery from muscle contraction (Fig.4). After 30 min of contraction there was a marked increase in palmitate uptake (+65%, p < 0.05) and in FAT/CD36 (+40%, p < 0.05). At the end of the recovery period palmitate uptake and FAT/CD36 had both returned to levels observed in vesicles obtained from resting muscles (Fig. 4,p > 0.05). During these experiments there were no changes in the membrane-associated MCT1 (data not shown). Fractions of the muscle samples obtained by continuous Percoll density gradients were characterized immunologically and enzymatically (Table I and Fig.5). GLUT-1, MCT1, and 5′-nucleotidase were most prominently present in the surface muscle fractions and not detected in the intracellular fractions (Table I). The transferrin receptor has been used as a marker of the light microsomal/endosomal compartment (33.Davis R.J. Corvera S. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8708-8711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Tanner L.I. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1537-1545Google Scholar). In the present studies, The transferrin receptor was present both in the intracellular fraction and at the surface of the membrane (Table I). GLUT-4 was present in greater quantities in the intracellular fraction than at the surface of the muscle (Fig. 5). As expected, insulin reduced the intracellular GLUT-4 and increased the surface GLUT-4 (Fig. 5). The fractions obtained from resting muscle showed a large pool of FAT/CD36 at the surface of the muscle as well as an intracellular pool of FAT/CD36 (Fig. 5).Table ICharacterizations of fractions corresponding to surface and intracellular membranes in control and electrically stimulated musclesControlStimulatedSurfaceIntracellularSurfaceIntracellular5′-NucleotidaseaFor 5′-nucleotidase the data are expressed as a percent of the enzyme activity in the control plasma membrane.100 ± 9.0bp < 0.05 surface versusintracellular.4.4 ± 0.799.8 ± 8.6bp < 0.05 surface versusintracellular.2.7 ± 0.5GLUT-1cFor GLUT-1, MCT1, and transferrin receptor, data are expressed as arbitrary units.152 ± 15.3bp < 0.05 surface versusintracellular.6.9 ± 0.7133.1 ± 38bp < 0.05 surface versusintracellular.NDdND, not detected.MCT1cFor GLUT-1, MCT1, and transferrin receptor, data are expressed as arbitrary units.143 ± 7.7bp < 0.05 surface versusintracellular.4.9 ± 2.9131 ± 7.0bp < 0.05 surface versusintracellular.1.6 ± 0.9Transferrin receptorcFor GLUT-1, MCT1, and transferrin receptor, data are expressed as arbitrary units.220 ± 9.5274 ± 31272 ± 15239 ± 21The data are the mean ± S.E. based on three to six independent preparations.a For 5′-nucleotidase the data are expressed as a percent of the enzyme activity in the control plasma membrane.b p < 0.05 surface versusintracellular.c For GLUT-1, MCT1, and transferrin receptor, data are expressed as arbitrary units.d ND, not detected. Open table in a new tab The data are the mean ± S.E. based on three to six independent preparations. Our primary aim was to examine the effects of muscle contraction on the subcellular redistribution of FAT/CD36. As a positive control for these studies we also examined the effects of electrically induced muscle contraction on GLUT-1, MCT1, transferrin receptor (Table I), and GLUT-4 (Fig. 5). The GLUT-1, MCT1, and transferrin receptor distributions were not altered by muscle contraction (Table I), whereas GLUT-4 was reduced in the intracellular pool (p < 0.05; Fig. 5) and was increased in muscle surface fractions (p < 0.05; Fig. 5). These results for GLUT-1 and GLUT-4 are consistent with previous reports (20.Roy D. Johannsson E. Bonen A. Marette A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E688-E694PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Goodyear L.J.

With 30 min of electrically induced muscle contraction the intracellular FAT/CD36 was reduced, and the surface FAT/CD36 was increased (Fig. 5). There was a significant reduction in intracellular FAT/CD36 and an increase in surface FAT/CD36 (p < 0.05; Fig. 5). This paralleled the responses of GLUT-4 (Fig. 5). There are a number of novel observations in the present studies. First, by using a muscle contraction model we have shown, for the first time, that fatty acid uptake can be acutely regulated. Second, FAT/CD36, one of the fatty acid transport proteins, is present both at the plasma membrane and in an intracellular pool in skeletal muscle. Third, with muscle contraction FAT/CD36 is translocated from an intracellular pool to the cell surface. Finally, SSO, which binds covalently to FAT/CD36 (23.Harmon C.M. Luce P. Beth A.H. Abumrad N.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 121: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), inhibited the contraction-induced increase in LCFA uptake. Thus, our studies have shown that the uptake"

Core 20 S proteasomes (abbreviated 20 S below) have two binding sites for the regulatory particles, PA700 and PA28. PA700–20 S-PA700 complexes are known as 26 S proteasomes and are ATP-dependent machines that degrade cell proteins.

We refer to the latter as “hybrid proteasomes.” The relative amounts of the various types of proteasomes in HeLa extracts were determined by a combination of immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Hybrid proteasomes accounted for about a fourth of all proteasomes in the extracts. Association of PA28 and proteasomes proved to be ATP-dependent. Hybrid proteasomes catalyzed ATP-dependent degradation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) without ubiquitinylation, as do 26 S proteasomes. In contrast, the homo-PA28 complex (PA28–20 S-PA28) was incapable of degrading ODC. Intriguingly, a major immunomodulatory cytokine, interferon-γ, appreciably enhanced the ODC degradation in HeLa and SW620 cells through induction of the hybrid proteasome, which may also be responsible for the immunological processing of intracellular antigens. Taken together, we report here for the first time the existence of two types of ATP-dependent proteases, the 26 S proteasome and the hybrid proteasome, which appear to share the ATP-dependent proteolytic pathway in mammalian cells.

Initially, it was found as a latent protease complex with a sedimentation coefficient of 20 S and termed the 20 S proteasome (here simply called 20 S or proteasome). Before long, the latent 20 S proteasome was demonstrated to act as a catalytic core of a large multisubunit proteolytic complex. The 20 S proteasome with a molecular mass of approximately 750 kDa is a barrel-like particle appearing as a stack of four rings made up of two outer α-rings and two inner β-rings. The α- and β-rings are each made up of seven structurally similar α- and β-subunits, respectively. Latency of the proteasome may be explained by the tertiary structure since the center of the α-ring is almost closed, preventing penetration of proteins into the inner aspect of the β-ring on which the proteolytically active sites are located (3.Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar, 4.Bochtler M. Ditzel L. Groll M. Hartmann C. Huber H. Annu. Rev. Biophysc. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 295-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The 20 S proteasome possesses a variety of catalytic centers that presumably contribute to the hydrolysis of multiple peptide bonds in single polypeptide substrates by a coordinated mechanism (1.Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2226) Google Scholar). To date, two protein factors that stimulate the latent 20 S proteasome activity have been described (reviewed in Ref. 5.DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22123-22126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). One is PA700 (also known as the 19 S complex) (6.Chu-Ping M. Vu J.H. Proske R.J. Slaughter C.A.

Chem. 1992; 267: 22369-22377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They are attached to both ends of the central 20 S proteasome, forming enzymatically active proteasomes. PA700 can associate with the 20 S proteasome in an ATP-dependent manner to form the 26 S proteasome with a molecular mass of ∼2500 kDa, a eukaryotic ATP-dependent protease, capable of degrading mainly proteins tagged with a polyubiquitin (Ub)1 chain, which functions as a degradation signal (2.Rechsteiner M. Peters J.-M. Harris J.R. Finley D. Ubiquitin and the Biology of the Cell. Plenum Press, New York1998: 147-189Crossref Google Scholar, 3.Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). In addition, recent analyses revealed the existence of a 300-kDa modulator complex that promotes ATP-dependent association of the 20 S proteasome and PA700 to form the 26 S proteasome (10.Adams G.M. Falke S. Goldberg A.L. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. Gogol E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 646-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). PA28 was identified as a novel activator of the latent 20 S proteasome, which greatly stimulated multiple peptidase activities of the latent 20 S proteasome (8.Ma C.-P. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10515-10523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Dubiel W. Pratt G. Ferrell K. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22369-22377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it fails to enhance hydrolysis of large protein substrates with native or denatured structures, even when the proteins have been already ubiquitinylated. Thus, PA28 appeared not to play a central role in the initial cleavage of protein substrates. It presumably has a stimulating effect on the degradation of polypeptides of intermediate size that are generated by the 26 S proteasome, implying that the 26 S proteasome and the PA28-proteasome complex may function sequentially on the same substrate molecules. PA28 is composed of two related proteins, named PA28α and PA28β, with an overall identity of approximately 50% (11.Ahn J.Y. Tanahashi N. Akiyama K. Hisamatsu H. Noda C. Tanaka K. Chung C.H.

They assemble into a heterohexamer (α3β3) with alternating α and β subunits (12.Song X. Mott J.D. von Kampen J. Pramanik B. Tanaka K. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol.

Krutchinsky A. Endicott S. Realini C. Rechsteiner M. Standing K.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5651-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). PA28 has been implicated in immune response, because PA28α and PA28β are found to be induced greatly by a major immunomodulatory cytokine, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (reviewed in Refs. 15.Tanaka K. Kasahara M. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 161-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 16.Fruh K. Yang Y. Curr. Opin.

Indeed, PA28 is known to contribute to the production of antigenic peptidesin vivo and in vitro (19.Dick T.P. Ruppert T. Groettrup M. Kloetzel P.M. Kuehn L. Koszinowski U.H. Stevanovi′c S. Schild H.

Recently, we reported that an antibody against p45 ATPase, a subunit of the PA700 complex, immunoprecipitates not only a set of 26 S proteasome components, but also PA28α and PA28β, indicating a simultaneous binding of PA28 and PA700 activators to the 20 S proteasome, in a PA700–20 S-PA28 complex (23.Hendil K.B. Khan S. Tanaka K. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 749-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear how PA28 is involved in the ATP-dependent proteolytic pathway in cells. The purpose of this work, therefore, is to clarify whether or not PA28 is functionally linked to proteasome-mediated proteolysis requiring ATP. It is difficult to prepare large amounts of ubiquitinylated proteins for use as substrates for the 26 S proteasome, because ubiquitinylation requires E1 (Ub-activating), E2 (Ub-conjugating), and E3 (Ub-ligating) enzymes, most of which have not yet been characterized for use inin vitro reconstituted proteolytic systems (24.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6829) Google Scholar). Therefore, for quantitative and sensitive measurement of ATP-dependent proteolysis activity in vitro, we used ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) as a substrate. ODC is a sole known natural substrate of the 26 S proteasome not requiring ubiquitinylation. Antizyme (AZ), an ODC inhibitory protein, is needed for the process instead of Ub (25.Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Kameji T. Hayashi S. Igarashi K. Tamura T. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Nature. 1992; 360: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar) but both ODC and AZ, required for this in vitro degradation assay, are available as recombinant proteins (26.Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Hayashi S. Tanahashi N. Tanaka K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7216-7227Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Using this convenient assay system, we here report for the first time that PA28 is actually involved in the ATP-dependent proteolytic pathway by forming a heterocomplex of the proteasome containing both PA28 and PA700. We named this complex the hybrid proteasome. We also provide evidence that the hybrid proteasome is induced in mammalian cells in response to IFN-γ. Possible roles of the hybrid proteasome in the immune response as well as in general intracellular proteolysis are discussed. 20 and 26 S proteasomes, PA28, and PA700 were purified from rat liver as described (27.Tanaka K. Tanahashi N. Celis J.E. Cell Biology : A Laboratory Handbook. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, New York1997: 129-134Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of the synthetic peptide succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Suc-LLVY-AMC) was measured as described previously (28.Tanaka K. Yoshimura T. Kumatori A. Ichihara A. Ikai A. Nishigai M. Kameyama K. Takagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16209-16217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Detection of Suc-LLVY-AMC-degrading enzymes after electrophoretic separation was carried out as described before (29.Ugai S. Tamura T. Tanahashi N. Takai S. Komi N. Chung C.H. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 754-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were subjected to non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) at 4 °C before the gels were overlaid with 0.1 mm Suc-LLVY-AMC for 10 min at room temperature. Fluorescence was then detected under ultraviolet light. The degradation of the recombinant 35S-labeled ODC (2000–3000 cpm) was assayed in the presence of ATP, an ATP-regenerating system, and AZ (25.Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Kameji T. Hayashi S. Igarashi K.

Biol. 1999; 19: 7216-7227Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). After incubation for 60 min at 37 °C, the amount of trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity of the reaction mixture was measured, and the activity was expressed as percentage of total ODC added. 35S-ODC was produced by the in vitrotranslation system using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Wako) containing rat ODC mRNA, 35S-labeled methionine, and35S-labeled cysteine (NEN Life Science Products). It was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography (26.Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Hayashi S. Tanahashi N. Tanaka K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7216-7227Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were grown to 80–100% confluence. Each 15-cm dish was washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and the cells lysed by sonication in 0.5 ml of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol with or without 2 mm ATP. The homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was subjected to glycerol density gradient centrifugation with 10–40% glycerol in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 2 mm ATP. After centrifugation at 83,000 × gfor 22 h in a Hitachi SRP28SA1 rotor, the gradient was separated into 30 fractions of 1 ml (29.Ugai S. Tamura T. Tanahashi N. Takai S. Komi N. Chung C.H. Tanaka K.

Polyclonal antibodies against human 20 S proteasomes and recombinant human PA28α, TBP1, p27, and p42, expressed in Escherichia coli, were raised in rabbits. Monoclonal antibodies against human proteasome C2 and p45 ATPase were produced as described elsewhere (23.Hendil K.B. Khan S. Tanaka K. Biochem.

For immunoprecipitation, cell extracts (100 μg of protein) were incubated in a total volume of 150 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 2 mm ATP at 4 °C for 2 h with anti-C2, anti-PA28α, anti-p45 antibodies, or control IgG. Twenty μl of 50% Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added and the suspensions were shaken gently at 4 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation, supernatants were used for proteolytic assay and Western blot analysis. One hundred and twenty μl of Tris-buffered saline buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mmNaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin were added to the pellet. The suspension was shaken for 1 h at 4 °C, after which the pellets were collected by centrifugation. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed five times with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. The pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Band intensities were determined quantitatively with an Image Master 1D (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). SDS-PAGE was carried out using 12.5% or 10–20% gradient slab gels (31.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206658) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford (32.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214515) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. When the cytoplasmic extracts from HeLa cells that had been prepared with ATP were fractionated by glycerol density gradient centrifugation, active enzyme catalyzing the degradation of the fluorogenic substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC was sedimented with a sedimentation coefficient of approximately 26 S, but low activity was found in slowly sedimenting fractions corresponding to the sedimentation position of the purified 20 S proteasome (Fig.1 A). Addition of 0.05% SDS, which is a potent artificial activator of the latent 20 S proteasome, caused marked activation of the enzyme sedimenting like the 20 S proteasome, as reported previously (33.Orino E. Tanaka K. Tamura T. Sone S. Ogura T. Ichihara A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 284: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, when the ATP level in the extracts was reduced by incubation with an ATP-depleting system, the SDS-insensitive Suc-LLVY-AMC degrading activity of the 26 S proteasome was lost almost completely, and the SDS-augmented activity in the 20 S proteasome was greatly increased (Fig. 1 B). The ATP-dependent degradation of 35S-ODC in the presence of AZ was only detected in 26 S fractions prepared from extracts with ATP, but no appreciable activity of 35S-ODC degradation was observed in those from ATP-depleted extracts (Fig. 1). Western blot analysis showed that the 20 S proteasome and PA700, detected by antibodies to the anti-C2 proteasome α-subunit and anti-p45 ATPase, respectively, shifted from fast sedimenting fractions, containing the 26 S proteasome, to slowly sedimenting fractions after depletion for ATP (Fig. 1, lower panels). It was therefore concluded that ATP depletion caused almost complete dissociation of the 26 S proteasome complex into its constituents, the latent 20 S proteasome and PA700, as reported previously (33.Orino E. Tanaka K. Tamura T. Sone S. Ogura T. Ichihara A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 284: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, in extracts with ATP most S5a, a poly(Ub)-binding subunit, (34.Deveraux Q. van Nocker S. Mahaffey D. Vierstra R. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29660-29663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) was found to be associated with 26 S proteasomes and PA700 without being detected in its free form. This is in marked contrast to the observation that the yeast orthologue Rpn10/Mcb1/Sun1 is present not only associated with PA700 or the 26 S proteasome but also in the free form (35.van Nocker S.

However, ATP depletion resulted in partial dissociation of S5a from PA700 and/or the 26 S proteasome (Fig.1, lower panels), implying that S5a subunit may be responsible for the assembly of the functional 26 S proteasome in the presence of ATP. On the other hand, the 300-kDa modulator complex consisting of p27, TBP1, and p42 (10.Adams G.M. Falke S. Goldberg A.L. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. Gogol E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 646-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and appearing in fractions 4–8, remained unchanged irrespective of the presence or absence of ATP in the extracts. After depletion for ATP, the latter two ATPases, which are subunits of PA700, also co-fractionate with p45 in rapidly sedimenting fractions (Fig. 1,lower panels). However, the third component of the modulator, p27, was present solely in the modulator complex irrespective of alteration of the ATP level. These observations are consistent with a previously proposed model that these two ATPase subunits are shared in two distinct complexes, PA700 and the modulator, and that the modulator is not assembled into the 26 S proteasome complex (10.Adams G.M. Falke S. Goldberg A.L. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. Gogol E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 646-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 (lower panels), both PA28α and PA28β were distributed in both rapidly and slowly sedimenting fractions in the presence of ATP. PA28 in the former fractions is thought to be associated with the 20 S proteasome, whereas the latter is most likely free PA28, which appears in fractions 2–10. ATP depletion resulted in almost complete loss of the rapidly sedimenting PA28. This was unexpected because the in vitro interaction between the 20 S proteasome and purified or recombinant PA28α does not require ATP (8.Ma C.-P. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10515-10523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Dubiel W. Pratt G. Ferrell K. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 26410-26417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We next examined whether ATP is needed for generation of the PA28-proteasome complex. To check this possibility, ATP-depleted extracts were prepared after treatment of living HeLa cells with 2,4-dinitrophenol and 2-deoxyglucose instead of glucose, causing an almost complete loss of 26 S proteasomes (Fig.2 A). With addition of ATP and an ATP-regenerating system, a marked assembly of 26 S proteasomes was observed, and ATP- and AZ-dependent 35S-ODC degrading activity was almost fully restored (Fig. 2 B). The generation of the active proteasome was also confirmed by degradation of Suc-LLVY-AMC in complexes, separated by non-denaturing PAGE (Fig. 2,inset; for the two active bands observed, see next section). These changes of activities were also consistent with movement of the 20 S proteasome C2 subunit and p45 ATPase PA700 subunit from slowly sedimenting fractions to rapidly sedimenting fractions, in response to ATP regeneration (Fig. 2, lower panels). Intriguingly, Western blot analysis revealed that both PA28α and PA28β were also shifted to heavier fractions (Fig. 2,lower panels), depending on the regeneration of ATP. These findings strongly suggest that PA28 became reversibly associated with the 20 S proteasome in an ATP-dependent manner, analogous to the formation of the 26 S proteasome complex. To clarify the unexpected finding of the ATP-dependent reversible association of PA28 to the proteasome, we explored more carefully the properties of the proteasome complex with PA28. It is known that adsorptive chromatographic steps, such as on DEAE-cellulose or hydroxylapatite, result in dissociation of most PA28 and some of PA700 from their proteasome complexes. In order to avoid such detachment of the regulatory particles, the enzymes were isolated under very mild conditions in the presence of 2 mmATP to stabilize the ATP-dependent proteases. For isolation of the apparently intact proteasome complexes, rat liver cytosol, enriched by ultracentrifugation at 70,000 × g for 5 h, were fractionated by Bio-Gel A-1.5m molecular sieve chromatography, as reported previously (29.Ugai S.

Subsequently the peak fractions with 35S-ODC degrading activity were pooled and applied to a hydroxylapatite column, equilibrated with phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) with 5 mm ATP. Under these conditions, most 20 S proteasomes are adsorbed to hydroxylapatite, whereas 26 S proteasomes are not (29.Ugai S. Tamura T. Tanahashi N. Takai S. Komi N. Chung C.H. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 754-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Proteasomes complexes, recovered in the flow-through, were fractionated by glycerol density gradient centrifugation. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the sedimentation profiles for activities degrading Suc-LLVY-AMC or35S-ODC were essentially the same as for Fig.1 A, except that the 26 S proteasome was enriched considerably, judging from very fast ATP-dependent35S-ODC degradation. In the slowly sedimenting fractions, the SDS-activated 20 S proteasomes and free PA28 were also detected. The latter was detected as the increase in enzyme activity of purified latent 20 S proteasome added to the fractions. Electrophoretic analysis showed that the active fractions contained multiple subunits ranging from 20 to 110 kDa, and resembling the pattern obtained with purified 26 S proteasomes (2.Rechsteiner M. Peters J.-M. Harris J.R. Finley D. Ubiquitin and the Biology of the Cell. Plenum Press, New York1998: 147-189Crossref Google Scholar, 29.Ugai S. Tamura T. Tanahashi N. Takai S. Komi N. Chung C.H. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 754-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 B). Fractions degrading35S-ODC contained both p45 ATPase and PA28α, as shown by Western blotting (Fig. 3 B, lower panel). Samples of these fractions were subjected to non-denaturing PAGE, and Suc-LLVY-AMC degrading activity was detected by soaking the gel with a solution containing a fluorogenic substrate. As shown in Fig.3 C (upper panel), hydrolysis of Suc-LLVY-AMC was seen in two bands from fractions 16–26. The activity in the upper band was sedimented somewhat faster than that in the lower band. Moreover, additional weaker activity appeared in slowly sedimenting complexes in fractions 14–20, and these had faster and slower electrophoretic mobility than the purified 26 and 20 S proteasomes, respectively. To characterize these active enzymes, samples separated by non-denaturing PAGE were analyzed by Western blotting. An anti-p45 ATPase antibody reacted with the two slowly migrating bands (Fig.3 C, middle panel, 26 S and hybrid). On the other hand, anti-PA28α antibody stained strongly a band with fast electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 3 C, lower panel), corresponded to the position of free PA28 (Fig.3 A, fractions 10–12). Moreover, anti-PA28α antibody also stained the two lower bands with enzymatic activity (fractions 16–22) (Fig. 3 C,upper and lower panels). These results clearly indicate the existence of three types of proteasomes as follows: the homo-PA700 proteasome (PA700–20 S-PA700 complex or 26 S proteasome) containing p45 without PA28α, the PA700–20 S-PA28 complex that simultaneously contains both PA28 and PA700 (“hybrid proteasome,” denoted by hybrid in Fig. 3 C), and the homo-PA28 proteasome (PA28–20 S-PA28 complex) containing PA28α but not p45 (denoted by homo-PA28 in Fig.3 C). To confirm the existence of these multiple forms of proteasomes, we analyzed fraction 20 further. As shown in Fig. 3 D, Suc-LLVY-AMC hydrolysis was again found in two strongly staining bands corresponding to the 26 S proteasome and the hybrid proteasome, and in a more weakly staining band with fast electrophoretic mobility (left lane). Anti-20 S proteasome polyclonal antibody stained these three bands, indicating that all three Suc-LLVY-AMC degrading activities were due to the proteasome (right lane). This is substantiated by the observation that Suc-LLVY-AMC degrading activities in soluble extracts were entirely lost by immunoprecipitation with anti-proteasomal antibodies (see belo"

Using a similar sequence that we found in the expressed sequence tag data base, we cloned and characterized of a fourth, high affinity, rat brain sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor, Edg-8. When HEK293T cells were co-transfected with Edg-8 and G protein DNAs, prepared membranes showed sphingosine 1- phosphate-dependent increases in [<sup>35</sup>S]guanosine 5′-(3-<i>O</i>-thio)triphosphate binding with an EC<sub>50</sub>of 90 nm. In a rat hepatoma Rh7777 cell line that exhibits modest endogenous responses to sphingosine 1-phosphate, this lipid mediator inhibited forskolin-driven rises in cAMP by greater than 90% when the cells were transfected with Edg-8 DNA (IC<sub>50</sub> 0.7 nm). This response is blocked fully by prior treatment of cultures with pertussis toxin, thus implicating signaling through G<sub>i/o</sub>α proteins. Furthermore, <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes exhibit a calcium response to sphingosine 1-phosphate after injection of Edg-8 mRNA, but only when oocytes are co-injected with chimeric G<sub>q/i</sub>α protein mRNA. Membranes from HEK293T and Rh7777 cell cultures expressing Edg-8 exhibited high affinity (<i>K</i> <sub>D</sub> = 2 nm) binding for radiolabeled sphingosine 1-phosphate. Rat Edg-8 RNA is expressed in spleen and throughout adult rat brain where <i>in situ</i> hybridization revealed it to be associated with white matter. Together our data demonstrate that Edg-8 is a high affinity sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor that couples to G<sub>i/o</sub>α proteins and is expressed predominantly by oligodendrocytes and/or fibrous astrocytes in the rat brain."

The phenotype of cardiac hypertrophy stimulated by Gs-coupled βAR is similar, if not identical, to that by agonists for Gqα-coupled receptors, such as angiotensin II, phenylephrine (PE), and endothelin-1,2despite the fact that the intracellular signaling mechanism activated by Gsα and that by Gqα are substantially different. We have shown that increases in the protein content and transcription of ANF induced by βAR stimulation are predominantly mediated by the β1AR subtype and that both Gsα and Gβγ in concert mediate βAR-stimulated ANF transcription.2 The intracellular signaling mechanism remains unclear, however, as to how stimulation of the β1AR causes cardiac hypertrophy. Many protein kinases and protein phosphatases are activated by hypertrophic stimuli in the heart, and a series of protein phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation events are responsible for induction of specific phenotypes in cardiac hypertrophy. Among them, growing lines of evidence suggest that members of the MAP kinase family, including ERKs, JNKs, and p38-MAPK, play an important role in formation of cardiac hypertrophy caused by many stimuli (10.Sugden P.H.

It is unclear at present, however, whether these previously well studied signaling mechanisms play a major role in βAR-stimulated cardiac hypertrophy. By contrast with the wealth of knowledge as to the role of MAP kinases, the role of signaling molecules regulated by 3′-phosphorylated phosphatidylinositides (3 phosphoinositides) in cardiac hypertrophy has been less well understood. Akt (also called as protein kinase B) is a serine/threonine protein kinase activated by many growth factors, including platelet-derived growth factor and insulin (reviewed in Refs.20.Franke T.F.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar). Interestingly, GSK3β phosphorylates NF-AT3, thereby causing its nuclear exit in COS cells. By contrast, calcineurin dephosphorylates NF-AT3 and causes its nuclear accumulation, which in turn mediates cardiac hypertrophy (18.Olson E.N. Molkentin J.D. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 623-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 19.Molkentin J.D. Lu J.-R. Antons C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that GSK3β may counteract the effect of calcineurin in the heart, and more importantly, Akt-induced inhibition of GSK3β may serve as an alternative mechanism to stimulate transcriptional events promoting cardiac hypertrophy. Little information is available, however, with regard to the role of the Akt-GSK3β pathway in cardiac hypertrophy. The present investigation was conducted to elucidate signaling mechanisms of cardiac hypertrophy induced by βAR stimulation. We studied the mechanism of ANF transcription, because ANF transcription in ventricular myocytes is frequently activated in many types of cardiac hypertrophy, and the result of this investigation may be compared with those of previous studies regarding the mechanism of ANF transcription by stimulation of the Gq-coupled receptors. In particular, we examined the role of MAP kinases, the Akt-GSK3β pathway, and other signaling mechanisms in βAR-mediated ANF transcription. Our results suggest that members of the MAP kinase family, including ERKs, JNKs, and p38-MAPK, do not play a central role in βAR-mediated ANF transcription. By contrast, a signaling molecule activated by both Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase II) and 3 phosphoinositides, namely Akt, plays a critical role in βAR-stimulated ANF transcription. Furthermore, we provide evidence that phosphorylation and subsequent inhibition of GSK3β by Akt is essential for βAR-stimulated ANF transcription.

Res. 1998; 81: 666-676Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In brief, cardiac myocytes were dispersed from the ventricles by digestion with collagenase type IV(Sigma), 0.1% trypsin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 15 μg/ml DNase I (Sigma). Cell suspensions were applied on a discontinuous Percoll gradient (1.060/1.086 g/ml) made up in Ads buffer (116 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mmNaH2PO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4, pH 7.35) and subjected to centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 30 min (4.Iwaki K. Sukhatme V.P. Shubeita H.E. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13809-13817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

We obtained myocyte cultures in which more than 95% were myocytes, as assessed by immunofluorescence staining with a monoclonal antibody against sarcomeric myosin (MF20). Culture media were changed to serum-free at 24 h. Myocytes were cultured in serum-free conditions for 48 h before experiments.

Plasmid encoding the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) was purchased from Stratagene. Plasmids encoding an epitope-tagged Akt (HA-Akt), constitutively active Akt (HA-myr Akt and HA-Akt(E40K)), and dominant negative Akt (HA-Akt(K179M) and HA-CAAX-Akt) have been described (40.Bellacosa A.

For some experiments, recombinant adenovirus harboring constitutively active Akt (Ad5·CMV 6-myr-Akt) was used. Adenovirus harboring lacZ (Ad5·CMV-β-galactosidase) was used as control. Plasmids expressing constitutively active PI3K (p110*) and its kinase-deficient mutant (p110*Δkin) (41.Klippel A. Reinhard C. Kavanaugh W.M. Apell G. Escobedo M.A. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4117-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) were provided by Dr. L.T. Williams (Chiron Corporation). GSK3β was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from the rat skeletal muscle mRNA, subcloned into pCR3.1 (Invitrogen) and the entire open reading frame was sequenced to confirm the correct sequence. Kinase-inactive GSK3β (GSK3βKI, K85M, and K86I) (42.He X. Saint-Jeannet J.P. Woodgett J.R. Varmus H.E. Dawid I.B. Nature. 1995; 374: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) and GSK3β(S9A) were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis using a Quick Change mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. PTEN and PDK1 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a human heart cDNA library (CLONTECH) subcloned into pCR3.1, and the entire open reading frame was sequenced. For transient transfection, myocytes were plated at a density of 1 × 106 per well in six-well plates. Twenty-four h after plating, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium without supplement. Transfections were carried out using 10 μl/ml of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 1 ml/well Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium medium. To determine whether the MAP kinases are activated by a given stimulus, the PathDetectTM in vivo signal transduction pathway trans-reporting system (Stratagene) was used, in which a plasmid (1 μg/ml) containing five tandem repeats of the yeast GAL4 binding sites linked to firefly luciferase (pFR-Luc) and another plasmid (50 ng/ml), consisting of the activation domain of a transcription factor, Elk1, c-Jun, ATF2, or CHOP fused with the DNA binding domain of the yeast GAL4, were cotransfected. To determine the activity of the ANF promoter, a plasmid (1 μg/ml) containing a 638- or 3003-base pair fragment of the rat ANF promoter linked to firefly luciferase (ANF-Luc (638), courtesy of Dr. K. R. Chien, University of California, San Diego, CA (4.Iwaki K. Sukhatme V.P. Shubeita H.E. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13809-13817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or ANF-Luc (3003)2) was used. In some experiments, myocytes were co-transfected with various doses of expression plasmid encoding signaling molecules. Total amounts of DNA were adjusted to 2 μg/ml by adding an empty vector. Twenty-four h after the transfection, the culture medium was changed to the cardiac myocyte culture medium without serum. Myocytes were further cultured in the presence or absence of isoproterenol (ISO) (10 μm), PE (10 μm), or fetal bovine serum (20%) for an additional 24 h. Myocytes were then lysed with the Reporter lysis buffer (Promega) and luciferase activities measured. An SV40 promoter-driven β-galactosidase construct (SV40-β-gal, 0.5 μg/ml) was co-transfected, and the β-gal activity was determined by using Lumi-Gal 530 (Lumigen). The luciferase values were divided by the β-gal values to correct for differences in the transfection efficiency. Cardiac myocytes were grown in six-well plates (1 × 106 cells/well). Myocytes were lysed with 100 μl of lysis buffer. For Akt, lysis buffer contained 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmEGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm AEBSF. For GSK3β, lysis buffer contained 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm EGTA, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm AEBSF. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were probed with anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473) (New England BioLabs) or anti-phospho-GSK3β (Ser-9) (Oncogene Research Product) antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies were used as secondary antibodies. The bound secondary antibody was detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The activity of Akt and GSK3β was measured by the immune complex kinase assay. For Akt, the cells were lysed with 1 ml of a lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris (pH 7.4), 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm AEBSF, 20 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate). Akt was immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-Akt antibody coupled to protein A-Sepharose (New England BioLabs). After washing the immune complex, kinase activities were assayed with GSK3 fusion protein (GSK3α peptide 7–25 fused to paramyosin) (New England BioLabs) as a substrate, in a reaction buffer, containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 μm ATP. The phosphorylation reactions were allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30 °C and then were stopped by adding 20 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer. The samples were loaded on SDS-PAGE gel (15%). The extent of GSK3 phosphorylation caused by immunoprecipitated Akt was determined by Western blot analyses using anti-phospho-GSK3α/β (Ser-21/Ser-9) antibody (New England BioLabs). For GSK3β kinase activity assays, the cells were lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm EGTA, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin,1 mm AEBSF) (43.Ueki K. Yamamoto-Honda R. Kaburagi Y. Yamauchi T. Tobe K. Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Komuro I. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. J. Biol.

GSK3β was immunoprecipitated with anti-mouse GSK3β antibody (Calbiochem) coupled to protein G-Sepharose. After washing the immune complex, the kinase activity was assayed by using 1 μg of GS peptide-2 (Upstate Biotechnology) as a substrate in a reaction buffer containing 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm protein kinase inhibitory peptide (rabbit sequence), 50 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After 20 min of incubation at 30 °C, 15 μl of radiolabeled peptide was spotted onto Whatman P81 filter papers. Samples were washed five times for 5 min each in a large volume of 180 mm of phosphoric acid and then once for 3 min in 99% ethanol. After drying, the samples were counted using a beta counter. Myocytes were grown on gelatin-coated glass coverslips. Twenty-four h after plating, myocytes were transfected with either HA-Akt (E40K) or HA-myrAkt and cultured for 48 h in serum-free conditions. Myocytes were then fixed with paraformaldehyde (3.6%) for 10 min. Double staining was performed by using affinity purified anti-HA monoclonal antibody (3F10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at a 1:200 dilution and anti-ANF polyclonal antibody (Peninsula) at a 1:100 dilution. Rhodamine-conjugated anti-rat IgG and FITC conjugated anti-rabbit IgG were used as secondary antibodies. The myocyte surface area and ANF expression in HA staining-positive myocytes were compared with those in HA-negative myocytes. To determine the myocyte surface area, microscope images (× 400) were captured by a digital camera, and analyses were performed by using Adobe Photoshop. Cardiac myocytes were plated on six-well plates and cultured in a serum-free condition for 48 h before experiments. Myocytes were infected with adenovirus harboring myr Akt or β-gal and further cultured for 48 h. After stimulation, each well was rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The cell layer was scraped with 1 ml of 1x standard sodium citrate containing 0.25% (w/v) SDS and vortexed extensively. The total cell protein and the DNA content were determined by the Lowry method and the Hoechst dye method, as described previously (44.Sadoshima J. Jahn L. Takahashi T. Kulik T.J. Izumo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10551-10560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein content was normalized by the DNA content to correct for differences in the cell number. Data are given as mean ± S.D. Statistical analyses were performed using the analysis of variance. The posttest comparison was performed by the method of Tukey. Significance was accepted at p < 0.05 level. Because the Ras-MAP kinase (ERKs, JNKs, and p38-MAPK) pathways mediate cardiac hypertrophy initiated by many growth factors (10.Sugden P.H. Clerk A. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 45.Sugden P.H. Clerk A. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1998; 38: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we examined whether these mechanisms are critical for ANF transcription by βAR stimulation. We first asked whether stimulation of the βAR activates MAP kinases sufficiently enough to affect nuclear transcription factors. We used sensitive reporter gene assays, which detect transcriptional activities of GAL4-Elk1, c-Jun, ATF2, and CHOP fusion proteins. Activation domains of Elk1, c-Jun, ATF2, and CHOP are phosphorylated by distinct members of the MAP kinase family (Elk1: ERKs, JNKs, and p38-MAPK; c-Jun: JNKs; ATF2: JNKs, p38-MAPK; CHOP: p38-MAPK), which in turn increases their transcriptional activities (46.Karin M. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 747-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). As expected, these transcription factors were strongly activated by upstream regulators of MAP kinases, including constitutively active Ras, MEKK1, and MKK3, in cardiac myocytes (Fig.1 A). By contrast, stimulation of the βAR by ISO only modestly increased transcriptional activities of GAL4-Elk1 and GAL4-ATF2 and decreased those of GAL4-cJun and GAL4-CHOP (Fig. 1 A). The effect of PE, an agonist for the α1 adrenergic receptor and a hypertrophic stimulus, was also examined. PE potently activated GAL4-Elk1 and GAL4-cJun. PE only modestly stimulated ATF2-GAL4, whereas it slightly decreased GAL4-CHOP. These results suggest that ligand binding to the βAR stimulates some members of the MAP kinase family only modestly to affect activities of the nuclear transcription factors. We have previously shown that stimulation of the βAR increases ANF expression through increases in transcription.2 Selective inhibition of MAP kinases by co-transfection of dominant negative MEK, dominant negative MEKK1, or dominant negative p38-MAPK failed to significantly inhibit βAR-stimulated increases in activities of the ANF promoter, which is determined by using the ANF-Luc reporter gene (Fig. 1 B). SB203580, a specific inhibitor for p38-MAPK/p38β1-MAPK and some isoforms of JNK (47.Clerk A. Sugden P.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) also failed to significantly inhibit ISO-induced increases in ANF transcription (10 μm ISO alone, 4.57 ± 1.63; 10 μmSB203580 + 10 μm ISO 4.25 ± 0.81, n= 6). Furthermore, inhibition of Ras, an upstream regulator of MAP kinases by dominant negative Ras (N17Ras) failed to inhibit βAR-stimulated increases in ANF transcription (Fig. 1 B). We have recently shown that dominant negative MEK and N17Ras significantly suppresses ANF transcription stimulated by angiotensin II, whereas dominant negative MEKK1, SB203580, and N17Ras significantly suppress ANF transcription stimulated by phenylephrine in cardiac myocytes (17.Aoki H. Richmond M. Izumo S. Sadoshima J. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the Ras-MAP kinase pathway is not required for increases in ANF transcription by βAR stimulation. It has been shown that CaM kinase II is able to stimulate ANF transcription (48.Ramirez M.T. Zhao X.L. Schulman H. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31203-31208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Because stimulation of the βAR enhances Ca2+ influx throughl-type Ca2+ channels, we examined whether Ca2+-dependent mechanisms are involved in ANF transcription by βAR stimulation. Both nicardipine, a Ca2+ channel antagonist, and KN93, a specific inhibitor for CaM kinase II (48.Ramirez M.T. Zhao X.L. Schulman H. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31203-31208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), inhibited increases in ANF transcription by βAR stimulation (Fig. 2 A). Thus, Ca2+-dependent mechanisms play an important role in βAR-stimulated ANF transcription. Because stimulation of the βAR increases cAMP and activates PKA in cardiac myocytes, we tested whether or not stimulation of PKA activates ANF transcription in"

LIGHT is a homotrimer that activates proapoptotic and integrin-inducing pathways. Receptor binding residues via LIGHT were identified by introducing point mutations in the A′ → A“ and D → E loops of LIGHT, which altered binding to LTβR and HveA. One mutant of LIGHT exhibits selective binding to HveA and is inactive triggering cell death in HT29.14s cells or induction of ICAM-1 in fibroblasts. Studies with HveA- or LTβR-specific antibodies further indicated that HveA does not contribute, either cooperatively or by direct signaling, to the death pathway activated by LIGHT. LTβR, not HveA, recruits TNF receptor-associated factor-3 (TRAF3), and LIGHT-induced death is blocked by a dominant negative TRAF3 mutant. Together, these results indicate that TRAF3 recruitment propagates death signals initiated by LIGHT-LTβR interaction and implicates a distinct biological role for LIGHT-HveA system.

Signaling by TNF-related cytokines is initiated by aggregation of specific cell surface receptors. TNF, lymphotoxin α (LTα), and LTβ and the recently identified protein LIGHT exhibit distinct but overlapping patterns of binding to four cognate cell surface receptors that together define a core group within the larger TNF superfamily. TNF and LTα are homotrimeric ligands that bind two receptors, TNFR1 (55–60 kDa; CD120a) and TNFR2 (75–80 kDa; CD120b) (1.Smith C.A. Farrah T. Goodwin R.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1835) Google Scholar). LTα also forms heterotrimers with LTβ (2.Browning J.L. Ngam-ek A. Lawton P. DeMarinis J. Tizard R. Chow E.P.

The shared receptor binding patterns among these cytokines are observed with LIGHT binding LTβR and HveA binding LTα but not TNF or LTαβ heterotrimer. Although the complexity of receptor cross-utilization suggests functional redundancy of these cytokines, gene deletion studies in mice have revealed unique and cooperating roles for the LTαβ and TNF ligand-receptor systems in the development and function of the immune system. The LTαβ-LTβR system is required for the formation of lymphoid tissue (lymph nodes and Peyer's patches) as well as the segregation of T and B-lymphocytes into distinct compartments in the spleen and the formation of germinal centers (7.Fu Y.-X. Chaplin D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 399-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Lymphoid tissue is largely unaffected by deletion of TNF, TNFR1, or TNFR2; however, TNF and TNFR1 are important for correct formation of germinal centers (8.Matsumoto M. Mariathasan S. Nahm M.H.

However, the relative contribution of HveA and LTβR to these LIGHT-mediated effects has not been established.

Whitbeck, manuscript in preparation. Sheep anti-mouse IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Full-length LIGHT was cloned from activated II23.D7 T cell hybridoma cells by reverse transcriptase-PCR using the following primer: forward, 5′-TATAAGCTTGAGGTTGAAGGACCCAGG-3′; reverse, 5′-CAGGGATCCCTTCCTTCACACCATGAAAGC-3′ (6.Mauri D.N.

The extracellular domain (encoding Gly66 to Val240) was amplified from pCDNA3-LIGHT by PCR using the following primers: forward, 5′-GTAGGAGAGATGGTCACCCGCCT-3′; reverse, 5′-GGAACGCGAATTCCCACGTGTCAGACCCATGTCCAAT-3′. The amplified LIGHT product was digested with EcoRI and ligated into theSnaB1 and EcoRI sites of pCDNA3.1-VCAM-FLAG, which contains the VCAM1 signal sequence fused to the FLAG epitope, 5′ of the FLAG epitope. HEK293 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method, and stable clones were selected with G418 and screened for LIGHT production. LIGHTt66 was purified from culture supernatants of cells grown in DMEM containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum. LIGHTt66 was purified by ion exchange chromatography with an SP Hitrap column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and affinity chromatography with anti-FLAG (M2) coupled to Affi-Gel (Bio-Rad). LIGHTt66 was eluted from the column using 20 mm glycine, 150 mm NaCl, pH 3.0, and pH-neutralized immediately by collection into 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Protein concentration was determined by amino acid analysis and absorbency at 280 nm. Primer-introduced sequence modification was used to generate soluble LIGHT with the following single amino acid substitutions: G119E, L120Q, Q117T, and Y173F. Briefly, internal primers were designed to introduce a restriction site at the mutation location. Forward and reverse primers containing the mutations were used in separate PCRs to amplify two regions of soluble LIGHT. Primers were as follows: Q117T, 5′-ACGCTGGGCCTGGCCTTCCTGA-3“ and 5′-ACTCTCCCATAACAGCGGCC-3′; G119E, 5′-GAGCTGGCCTTGCTGAGGGGCCT-3” and 5′-CAGCTGAGTCTCCCATAACA-3′; L120Q, 5′-CAGGCCTTCCTGAGGGGCCTCA-3′ and 5′-GCCCAGCTGAGTCTCCCATAA-3′; Y173F, 5′-TTCCCCGAGGAGCTGGAGCT-3′ and 5′-GCGGGGTGTGCGCTTGTAGA-3′. The PCR products were ligated at the primer-introduced restriction enzyme site to create soluble LIGHT starting at amino acid Gly66 and containing one of the 4-amino acid substitutions. The LIGHTt66 mutants were excised and ligated into VCAM-FLAG-pCDNA3.1. The VCAM FLAG-LIGHT mutant inserts were cloned into pCDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). All constructs were sequenced (ABI310 automated sequencer) for unambiguous verification of the mutation. LIGHTt66 mutants were produced by calcium phosphate transient transfection of 293T cells. Mutant proteins were purified from 100 ml of culture supernatant in a one-step immunoaffinity procedure using an affinity matrix of anti-FLAG antibody (M2). Protein-containing fractions were dialyzed against PBS and sterilized after dilution in medium. Soluble LIGHT was measured using a capture ELISA method. The capture molecule (HveA-Fc or LTβR-Fc) was coated on wells of a microtiter plate (150 ng/well in 50 μl of 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 9.6) at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, 0.5% Tween 20, purified ligands diluted in PBS, 3% BSA were added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, mouse mAb anti-FLAG (M2) (10 μg/ml in PBS/BSA) was added for 1 h at room temperature, washed, and incubated with goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (1:1500) for 1 h at room temperature. Color was developed with 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenz-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (Sigma), and the OD was measured at 415 nm in a SpectraMax plate reader (Molecular Devices, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). LIGHT was cross-linked by the addition of bis[2-(succinimidooxycarbonyloxy)ethyl]sulfone (BSOCOES) (Pierce) at final concentrations of 5 mm or by the addition of glutaraldehyde (0.1%) for 30 min at 4 °C, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of Tris (20 mm, pH 8.0). After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Blots were incubated in PBS, 0.1% Tween containing 10% milk protein, 0.2% sodium azide) for 30 min. The blot was incubated with anti-FLAG M2 (5 μg/ml) and washed, and then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (sheep anti-mouse IgG; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 1:1000) was added for 1 h. The blot was developed using chemiluminescent detection reagents (Supersignal; Pierce). The molecular weight of native LIGHTt66 was analyzed by gel filtration on a Superose 12 column using a FPLC 500 system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with collection of 0.5-ml fractions. LIGHT was detected by ELISA and by Western blot with anti-FLAG. The elution volumes of calibration proteins (blue dextran (2000 kDa), apoferitin (443 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and cytochrome c (12 kDa) were measured by absorbency at 280 nm. HT29.14s cells (5000/well) in DMEM were incubated at 37 °C with serial dilutions of LIGHTt66 and other cytokines in a total volume of 100 μl of DMEM in the presence or absence of 80 units/ml of human IFN-γ. After 72 h, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) was added, and the plate was incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. The medium was then aspirated, and 100 μl of acidified 70% isopropyl alcohol was added to dissolve the formazan product. TheA 570 was measured in multiwell spectrophotometer (Spectra Max 250, Molecular Devices, Inc.). The data represent the mean ± S.D. of triplicate wells. LIGHTt66 was modeled using the SwissModel server, version 3.0 (available on the World Wide Web) using 12TUN.pdb and 1TUN.pdb as the templates (42.Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9503) Google Scholar) and visualized using Rasmol (version 2.6). Association and dissociation rates of the interaction of LIGHTt66 and mutants with human HveA-Fc and LTβR-Fc were determined by surface plasmon resonance using a BIA-core X (BIA-core Inc., Piscataway, NJ). The capture molecule (50 μg/ml) was coupled to a CM5 sensor chip by amine coupling at pH 5.0. The sensor surface was equilibrated with PBS (20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), and sensorgrams were collected at 25 °C and a flow rate of 5 μl/min. A 10-μl injection of LIGHTt66 or mutant proteins were passed over the sensor surface, and after the association phase, 800 s of dissociation data were collected. The sensor surface was regenerated after each cycle with a 10-μl pulse of 10 mm glycine pH 2.0. Sets of five analyte concentrations, 100–500 nm, were collected and analyzed by nonlinear regression using the BIAevaluation software (version 2.1). Association and dissociation data were fitted on the basis of the simple AB ↔ A + B model. HT29.14s cells or NHDF (DMEM, 3% BSA) were incubated with mouse monoclonal antibodies in a total volume of 50 μl for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were stained with goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to R-phycoerythrin for 30 min at 4 °C, and 5 × 103 cells were analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). One day post-transfection, 293T cells were seeded in eight-well chamber slides (Lab-Tek) at 3 × 104 cells/well and cultured for 18–36 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed for 10 min at room temperature in freshly prepared 2% paraformaldhyde in PBS (pH 7.0), washed twice with PBS, and then permeabilized in methanol for 2 min at room temperature. Cells were washed in PBS and then blocked for 10 min at room temperature in PBS containing 3% BSA. Polyclonal goat anti-LTβR IgG (28.VanArsdale T.L. VanArsdale S.L. Force W.R. Walter B.N. Mosialos G.

Primary antibodies were added to the wells to a final volume of 120 μl/well and incubated in a humidified chamber at room temperature for 1 h. Wells were then washed three times in PBS/BSA/Triton buffer. FITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), in combination with Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) or donkey anti-rat IgG-Texas Red, was diluted to a final concentration of 1:200 in PBS/BSA/Triton in a final volume of 120 μl/well. Slides were incubated in a humidified chamber at room temperature in the dark for 1 h and then washed three times in PBS/BSA/Triton. The slides were mounted in 80% glycerol in PBS, sealed, and kept at 4 °C in the dark for 1–7 days before visualization. Cells were observed with a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal microscope with a krypton/argon ion laser and a × 60 Nikon objective. Images were acquired using the LaserSharp operation system and were analyzed and manipulated in Adobe PhotoShop. Empty vector-transfected cells or cells stained with normal goat serum or mouse isotype-specific IgG were used for negative controls. Neither control exhibited background staining. Representative staining patterns were based on counting 200 cells. 293T cells individually transfected with FLAG-tagged TRAF2, -3, or -5 alone or co-transfected with either HveA or LTβR were washed once with PBS and then lysed with 600 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 9, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C for 30 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 3 min. Goat anti-HveA or goat anti-LTβR was added to the lysates at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml, and then protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added and mixed at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed, and proteins were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Whole cell lysates were prepared by direct extraction of cell pellets into heated SDS-PAGE sample buffer and clarification by centrifugation (1500 × g for 10 min). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by blotting. In order to investigate cellular responses initiated by LIGHT, a soluble form (LIGHTt66) was engineered by truncation of the N-terminal 65 amino acids, which removes the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains. An N-terminal FLAG epitope was added for detection and purification of the cytokine. This construct was expressed in HEK293 cells and purified to homogeneity by ion exchange and immunoaffinity chromatography. The final yield of protein was 80%, and the purity was >99% (Fig.1 A). Soluble LIGHTt66 behaved as an oligomer in SDS-PAGE following treatment with bifunctional cross-linkers (Fig. 1 B). Additionally, LIGHTt66 eluted in native gel filtration chromatography as a single narrow peak with a molecular mass of ∼76 kDa, which is consistent with a stable trimeric structure, characteristic of this family of cytokines. LIGHT contains two cysteines in the extracellular domain at positions 154 and 187; however, no evidence was found that a disulfide bond was necessary for the formation or stability of the trimer. Purified LIGHTt66 was active at inducing the death of adenocarcinoma HT29.14s cells with comparable efficiency to LTα1β2 (Fig.2 A). Cytotoxicity was dependent on IFN-γ (Fig. 2 B), as is characteristic of this cell line for induction of apoptosis by LTα1β2, TNF, Fas ligand, and TRAIL, and was maximal after 72 h (data not shown). Over a range of experiments, 50% loss of cell viability was achieved with doses of 10–100 pm LIGHT. LIGHTt66-induced death was blocked in a dose-dependent manner by receptor, LTβR-Fc, or HveA-Fc; however, a combination of Fas-Fc, TNFR1-Fc, and TRAILR2-Fc did not inhibit death in this system (Fig. 2 C). This latter observation demonstrates specificity of the Fc fusion proteins but also indicates that the death inducing activity of LIGHT is not dependent on induction of a secondary mediator, such as TNF, which was recently shown to occur when CD40 or TNFR2 are activated to induce cell death (22.Grell, M., Zimmerman, G., Gottfried, E., Chen, C., Grunwald, U., Huang, D. C. S., Lee, Y. H. W., Durkop, H., Engelmann, H., Scheurich, P., Wajant, H., and Strasser, A. (1999) EMBO J. 3034–3043Google Scholar). A three-dimensional model of LIGHT based on the crystallographic structure of LTα and TNF was generated to predict residues that are likely to be involved in receptor binding (42.Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9503) Google Scholar) (Fig.3 A). The primary receptor-binding residues in LTα are located in the connecting loops of the A → A“ and the D → E β-strands, which are located on opposite sides of the LIGHT subunit. The receptor binding site, located at the cleft formed between adjacent subunits, is formed as a composite of residues contributed by the A → A” loop from one subunit and the D → E loop of the neighboring subunit. Residues within these loops are not conserved between LIGHT and LTα, although significant conservation is apparent"
https://openalex.org/W2140019924,"Binding of a series of synthetic multivalent carbohydrate analogs to the Man/Glc-specific lectins concanavalin A andDioclea grandiflora lectin was investigated by isothermal titration microcalorimetry. Dimeric analogs possessing terminal α-D-mannopyranoside residues, and di-, tri-, and tetrameric analogs possessing terminal 3,6-di-O-(α-d-mannopyranosyl)-α-d-mannopyranoside residues, which is the core trimannoside of asparagine-linked carbohydrates, were selected in order to compare the effects of low and high affinity analogs, respectively. Experimental conditions were found that prevented precipitation of the carbohydrate-lectin cross-linked complexes during the isothermal titration microcalorimetry experiments. The results show that the value of n, the number of binding sites on each monomer of the lectins, is inversely proportional to the number of binding epitopes (valency) of each carbohydrate. Hence,n values close to 1.0, 0.50, and 0.25 were observed for the binding of mono-, di-, and tetravalent sugars, respectively, to the two lectins. Importantly, differences in the functional valency of a triantennary analog for concanavalin A and D. grandifloralectin are observed. The enthalpy of binding, ΔH, is observed to be directly proportional to the number of binding epitopes in the higher affinity analogs. For example, ΔH of a tetravalent trimannoside analog is nearly four times greater than that of the corresponding monovalent analog. Increases inK a values of the multivalent carbohydrates relative to monovalent analogs, known as the “multivalency effect,” are shown to be due to more positive entropy (TΔS) contributions to binding of the former sugars. A general thermodynamic model for distinguishing binding of multivalent ligands to a single receptor with multiple, equal subsitesversus binding to separate receptor molecules is given.

Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (4963) Google Scholar, 2.Lis H. Sharon N. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 637-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar). The specificity of these interactions has been an active area of research due, in part, to efforts at designing therapeutic analogs of carbohydrates (3.Witczak Z.J. Witczak Z.J. Nieforth K.A.

However, attempts to design high affinity analogs for specific carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectins) have been difficult due to the intrinsic low affinity of carbohydrates in many cases (5.Quiocho F.-A. Pure Appl. Chem. 1989; 61: 1293-1299Crossref Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 6.Toone E.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 719-728Crossref Scopus (311) Google Scholar). For example, the affinity constants (K a) for the binding of simple mono- and oligosaccharides to most lectins are between 103 and 106m−1 (7.Lemieux R.U. Acc. Chem. Res. 1996; 29: 373-380Crossref Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 8.Mandal D.K. Kishore N. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1149-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). This range ofK a values is too low for effective drug design. However, many naturally occurring carbohydrates and glycoconjugates including glycoproteins and glycolipids are multivalent (2.Lis H. Sharon N. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 637-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar) which results in their increased avidity for lectins (9.Lee Y.C.

As a consequence, there has been considerable interest in designing multivalent or “clustered” carbohydrate analogs for high affinity binding to target lectin receptors (10.Roy R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 692-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 11.Kiessling L.L. Pohl N. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 71-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Thus, it is important to understand the thermodynamic basis of the enhanced binding of multivalent glycoconjugates to lectins.Binding of multivalent carbohydrates (and glycoconjugates) to lectins, which themselves are generally multivalent (2.Lis H. Sharon N. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 637-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar), may or may not lead to the formation of lectin-carbohydrate cross-linked complexes (12.Brewer C.F. Chemtracts Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 6: 165-179Google Scholar). This depends on the valencies of the two molecules, and the structural arrangement of the carbohydrate epitopes and binding sites (subunits) of the lectin. In cases where cross-linking occurs, several different types of complexes can result. When both the carbohydrate and lectin are divalent, one-dimensional soluble cross-linked complexes may form. However, when the valencies of the carbohydrate and lectin are greater than two for either molecule, two- and three-dimensional cross-linking can occur resulting in highly ordered complexes. In the latter case, precipitation of the ordered cross-linked complex generally occurs, and occasionally crystals of the complex may result. This type of cross-linked complex has been extensively described by Brewer and co-workers (12.Brewer C.F. Chemtracts Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 6: 165-179Google Scholar, 13.Olsen L.R. Dessen A. Gupta D. Sabesan S. Sacchettini J.C. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15073-15080Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Importantly, high affinity binding occurs in this type of cross-linked complex since both the carbohydrate and lectin simultaneously bind to neighboring molecules in the lattice.Multivalent binding between carbohydrates and lectins can also occur without cross-linking interactions, as in the case where the binding sites of a lectin are clustered together or face the same direction (14.Drickamer K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 437-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). An example of clustered binding sites is the hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor (9.Lee Y.C. FASEB J. 1993; 6: 3193-3200Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Binding of a monoantennary complex oligosaccharide gives an inhibition constant, (I)50, of ∼103m−1, while a triantennary complex oligosaccharide possesses an (I)50 of ∼109m−1 (15.Lee Y.C. Townsend R.R. Hardy M.R. Lonngren J. Arnarp J. Haraldsson M. Lonn H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 199-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of subsites for each arm of the trivalent oligosaccharide on three clustered subunits of the receptor is known to be responsible for the large increase in the affinity of the triantennary carbohydrate (9.Lee Y.C. FASEB J. 1993; 6: 3193-3200Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The ∼106 increase in affinity of the trivalent carbohydrate relative to the monovalent sugar is essentially the theoretical limit of the sum of the exponentials of the binding constants of the individual subsites (i.e. 103× 103 × 103 = 109).More recently, clustered or “dendritic” multivalent carbohydrate analogs have been synthesized in order to obtain enhanced affinity for lectins with binding sites well separated on adjacent monomers of the protein. For example, clustered or dendritic GlcNAc-based synthetic analogs with valencies of two, four, and eight were prepared on a scaffolding of l-lysine (16.Zanini D. Roy R. Bioconjug. Chem. 1997; 8: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The binding potencies of the dendrimers derived from IC50 mm values for inhibiting wheat germ agglutinin binding to porcine stomach mucin relative to a monomeric analog were 5-fold for the divalent derivative, 25-fold for the tetrameric derivative, and 170-fold for the octameric derivative. Thus, significant enhancements in the affinities of multivalent carbohydrates for multivalent lectins have been observed. However, the thermodynamic basis for these increased affinities are not understood.Isothermal titration microcalorimetry (ITC)1 has recently been used to study the binding interactions between carbohydrates and lectins. ITC measurements provide direct determinations of the value ofn, the number of binding sites of the protein, ΔH, the enthalpy of binding, and K a, the association constant. From measurements of K a, the free energy of binding, ΔG, can be calculated, and hence the entropy of binding, ΔS, determined. Thus, ITC measurements can determine the complete thermodynamics of binding of a carbohydrate to a lectin. As examples, the binding of mono- and oligosaccharides to the Man/Glc-pecific lectin concanavalin A (ConA) and the seed lectin from Dioclea grandiflora (DGL) have been investigated using ITC measurements (8.Mandal D.K. Kishore N. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1149-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 17.Chervenak M.C. Toone E.J.

A large increase in the -ΔH value of 3,6-di-O-(α-d-mannopyranosyl)-α-d-mannopyranose, which is present in the “core” region of all asparagine-linked carbohydrates, relative to that of methyl-α-d-mannopyranoside (Me-αMan), for both lectins suggested extended binding sites in both proteins for the trimannoside (19.Dam T.K. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32812-32817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Importantly, these results were confirmed by x-ray crystallographic studies of ConA (20.Naismith J.H. Field R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 972-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and DGL (21.Rozwarski D.A. Swami B.M. Brewer C.F. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32818-32825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, ITC measurements can provide thermodynamic as well as structural information on carbohydrate-lectin interactions. However, to date ITC measurements have not extensively been applied to the study of multivalent carbohydrate-lectin interactions.In the present study, we report ITC measurements of the binding of synthetic multivalent carbohydrates to ConA and DGL. Synthetic dimeric analogs of α-d-mannopyranoside (Figs.1 and 2) and di-, tri-, and tetrameric analogs of 3,6-di-O-(α-d-mannopyranosyl)-α-d-mannopyranoside (Figs. 3 and4) were used in the study. The results show that ITC can be used to determine the functional valence of multivalent carbohydrates for ConA and DGL, and the thermodynamic basis for the enhanced affinities of the multivalent sugars.Figure 2Structures of multivalent analogs 4–6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Structures of multivalent analogs 7 and 8.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Structures of multivalent analogs 9 and 10.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)MATERIALS AND METHODSDGL was isolated from D. grandiflora seeds obtained from North Eastern Brazil (Albano Ferreira Martin Ltd., Rua Teodoreto Souto, 718 (cambuci) 01634-000 Sao Paulo, Brazil) as described previously (22.Moreira R.A.

The concentration of DGL was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using A1 cm1% = 12.0 at pH 5.2 and expressed in terms of monomer (M r = 25,000) (22.Moreira R.A. Barros A.C.H. Stewart J.C. Pusztai A. Planta. 1983; 158: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). ConA was prepared from Jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis) seeds (Sigma) according to the method of Agrawal and Goldstein (23.Agrawal B.B.L. Goldstein I.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 147: 262-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The concentration of ConA was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using A1 cm1% = 12.4 at pH 5.2 (24.Goldstein I.J. Poretz R.D. Liener I.E. Sharon N. Goldstein I.J. The Lectins.

The synthesis of carbohydrate analogs 1 and 2 has previously been reported (25.Roy R. Das S.K. Donimique R. Trono M.C. Mateo F.H. Gonzalez F.S. Pure Appl. Chem. 1999; 71: 565-571Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar), as have analogs 4, 5, and 6(26.Page D. Roy R. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The synthesis of analogs 7, 8, 9, and 10 has also been previously described (27.Roy R. Page D. Perez S.F. Bencomo V.V. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 251-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Synthesis of 3 will be reported elsewhere. The concentrations of the carbohydrates were determined by modification of the Dubois phenol/sulfuric acid method using appropriate monosaccharides as standards (28.Saha S.K. Brewer C.F. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 254: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar).Isothermal Titration MicrocalorimetryITC experiments were performed using a model MCS instrument from Microcal, Inc. (Northampton, MA). Injections of 4 μl of carbohydrate solution were added from a computer controlled 250- or 100-μl microsyringe at an interval of 4 min into the sample solution of lectin (cell volume = 1.358 ml) with stirring at 350 rpm. An example of an ITC experiment is shown in Fig. 5 for tetravalent trimannoside 10 with ConA at 27 °C. Control experiments performed by making identical injections of saccharide into a cell containing buffer without protein showed insignificant heats of dilution. The concentration of lectins were 0.015–0.14 mmand the sugars were 0.16–4.0 mm, respectively. Titrations were done at pH 5.0–5.2 and at NaCl concentrations from 0 to 0.15m. The experimental data were fitted to a theoretical titration curve using software supplied by Microcal, with ΔH (enthalpy change in kcal mol−1),K a (association constant in M−1) andn (number of binding sites per monomer), as adjustable parameters. The quantity c = K a M t(0), where M t(0) is the initial macromolecule concentration, is of importance in titration microcalorimetry (29.Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandt J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed with c values 1 < c < 200. The instrument was calibrated using the calibration kit containing ribonuclease A (RNase A) and cytidine 2′-monophosphate supplied by the manufacturer. Thermodynamic parameters were calculated from the equation, ΔG=ΔH−TΔS=−RT lnKaEquation 1 where ΔG, ΔH, and ΔS are the changes in free energy, enthalpy, and entropy of binding.T is the absolute temperature and R = 1.98 cal mol−1 K−1.Figure 5ITC profile of ConA (0.020 mm) with analog 10 (0.24 mm) at 27 °C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 32812-32817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) are close to 1.0 for both lectins. For example, the values of n are 1.0 for the binding of both Me-αMan and Tri-Man to ConA (TableI) and DGL (TableII). These values agree with the x-ray crystal data for the number of binding sites on each monomer of ConA for Me-αMan (30.Naismith J.H. Emmerich C. Habash J. Harrop S.J. Helliwell J.R. Hunter W.N.

Open table in a new tab However, n values less than 1.0 have been reported for the binding of multivalent carbohydrates to ConA. An n value of 0.59 was reported by Brewer and co-workers (8.Mandal D.K. Kishore N. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1149-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) for the binding of a Man9 oligomannose glycopeptide to acetyl-ConA, which is a dimer at pH 7.0 (31.Gunther G.R. Wang J.L. Yahara I. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 1012-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). An n value of 0.64 was also reported for the binding of a Man5 oligomannose to acetyl-ConA (8.Mandal D.K. Kishore N. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1149-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Both of these carbohydrates were previously shown to be divalent for ConA (32.Bhattacharyya L. Brewer C.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 178: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), with one binding site on the α(1–3) arm of the core Man residue, and the second site on the α(1–6) arm of the core Man residue. Both carbohydrates are also known to bind and precipitate tetrameric ConA at pH 7.2 (32.Bhattacharyya L. Brewer C.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 178: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, the Man5 oligosaccharide has also been shown to bind and precipitate with tetrameric DGL at pH 7.2 (33.Gupta D. Oscarson S. Raju T.S. Stanley P. Toone E.J. Brewer C.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Brewer and co-workers (8.Mandal D.K. Kishore N. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1149-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) concluded that the relatively low n values associated with binding of the Man5 and Man9 carbohydrates to acetyl-ConA were due to the formation of soluble one-dimensional cross-linked complexes between the divalent lectin and the divalent carbohydrate(s).ITC derived values of n less than 1.0 have also been reported for the binding of synthetic divalent analogs to ConA. Then values for binding of two divalent C-glycoside analogs possessing terminal Glc or Man residues to tetrameric ConA and succinyl-ConA, which is also reported to be a dimer (31.Gunther G.R. Wang J.L. Yahara I. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 1012-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), were reported to be close to 0.50 for both forms of the lectin (34.Weatherman R.V. Mortell K.H. Chervenak M. Kiessling L.L. Toone E.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3619-3624Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The results in the present study suggest that divalent cross-linking by the sugars is responsible for their low n values.Structures of the Carbohydrate AnalogsSynthetic analogs1–6 in Figs. 1 and 2 possess terminal α-d-mannopyranoside residues in each molecule. The structures of dimeric analogs 1-3 differ in terms of the flexibility and length of the spacer groups in each molecule. Analog 1 has a relatively rigid, linear spacer group, a phenyl ring with para-substituted acetylenic groups, between the two terminal Man residues. Analog 2 possesses a shorter, rigid, linear spacer group, with the absence of one of the acetylene groups found in 1. Analog 3 possesses a hexyl chain as a spacer group, and hence is close to the length of2 but more flexible than either 1 or2.The structures of analogs 4-6 differ from those of 1-3 in having even longer spacer groups. These groups are derived from a para-substituted phenylthiourea group that is connected to ethyl and hexyl chains in 5 and6, respectively. Thus, the distance separating the terminal Man residues in 4-6 is progressively increased.Synthetic analogs 7–10 in Figs. 3 and 4 possess terminal 3,6-di-O-(α-d-mannopyranosyl)-α-d-mannopyranoside residues.Previous ITC studies have shown that the individual trimannoside epitope (Tri-Man) binds with much higher affinity than Me-αMan to ConA (8.Mandal D.K. Kishore N. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1149-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and DGL (19.Dam T.K. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32812-32817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), as shown in Tables I and II, respectively. The spacer groups in analogs 7 and8 are based on a 3,5-disubstituted benzoic acid ring in which the two thiourea moieties on the phenyl ring are coupled to glycosidically linked alkyl ether chain. Thus, 7 and8 are biantennary analogs of the trimannoside moiety, differing only in a methyl group on the benzoic acid moiety (ester) of8. Analog 9 possesses three thiourea-substituted chains terminating in the trimannoside moiety. Analog 10possesses two trisubstituted phenyl rings with each ring possessing two thiourea-linked alkyl either chains coupled to a terminal trimannoside moiety. Hence, 10 possesses four terminal trimannoside groups.Experimental Conditions for ITC MeasurementsAt pH 7.2 and NaCl concentrations greater than 0.15 m where ConA and DGL are tetramers, analogs 1-10 are observed to bind and precipitate with both proteins at lectin concentrations between 25 and 60 μm and at nearly stoichiometric ratios of the sugars. Quantitative precipitation profiles of the lectins with the sugars confirmed their ability to precipitate the proteins (data not shown). The precipitation reactions were inhibited by the presence of Me-αMan or dissolved upon addition of the monosaccharide. Thus, the multivalent binding activities of the sugars were confirmed, since tetrameric ConA (12.Brewer C.F. Chemtracts Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 6: 165-179Google Scholar) and tetrameric DGL (33.Gupta D. Oscarson S. Raju T.S. Stanley P. Toone E.J. Brewer C.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) are known to precipitate with multivalent carbohydrates and glycoproteins. ITC measurements, however, require the presence of soluble complexes during the titration experiment (∼1–2 h), and thus conditions in which the sugar complexes with ConA and DGL remained soluble were investigated.The dimer-tetramer equilibrium of ConA has been reported to be sensitive to pH, so that the tetramer exist at pH 7 while the dimer is reported to predominate at pH 5.0 (35.McKenzie G.H. Sawyer W.H. Nichol L.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 263: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 36.Huet M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 59: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Acetylation or succinylation of the amino groups of ConA is reported to produce dimeric derivatives of ConA (31.Gunther G.R. Wang J.L. Yahara I. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 1012-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). We have observed that at concentrations between 15 and 140 μm ConA and DGL, both lectins at room temperature are dimers at pH 5.0 and low salt concentrations (less than 0.15 mNaCl). 2T. K. Dam, R. Roy, S. K. Das, S. Oscarson, and C. F. Brewer, unpublished results. Under these conditions, precipitation of both lectins by analogs1-10 either is not observed or considerably slowed. Dimeric ConA and DGL do not precipitate with divalent sugars1-7, since they apparently form linear cross-linked complexes with the sugars that are soluble. On the other hand, analogs 9 and 10 are potentially tri- and tetravalent, respectively, and capable of forming two- and three-dimensional cross-linked complexes even with dimeric ConA and DGL. However, using concentrations of ∼15 μm ConA and DGL at pH 5.0 and low salt concentration, complexes of 9 and10 with both lectins are observed to be stable during the ∼1 h required for the ITC experiments. Time-dependent precipitation of the complex occurred after the run. Thus, the ITC experiments reported in the present study were performed under conditions in which cross-linked complexes between the sugars and lectins were soluble.ITC Measurements of Ka and n Values of the Multivalent CarbohydratesTables I and II show data for the binding of1–10 to ConA and DGL, respectively.

Earlier studies established that MIC2 is secreted into the culture medium by extracellular parasites and that release is coincident with proteolytic modification. Since little is known about proteolytic processing of proteins secreted by T. gondii, we undertook this study to investigate the proteolytic events that accompany secretion of MIC2. We demonstrate that the C-terminal domain of MIC2 is removed by a protease, termed MPP1, when MIC2 is released into the culture supernatant. Additionally, prior to release, a second protease, termed MPP2, trims the N terminus of MIC2, resulting in the release of heterogeneously sized species of MIC2. Although MPP1 activity was unaffected by any of the protease inhibitors tested, MPP2 activity was blocked by a subset of serine and cysteine protease inhibitors. These results establish that MIC2 is proteolytically modified at multiple sites by two distinct enzymes that probably operate on the parasite surface.

Additionally, prior to release, a second protease, termed MPP2, trims the N terminus of MIC2, resulting in the release of heterogeneously sized species of MIC2. Although MPP1 activity was unaffected by any of the protease inhibitors tested, MPP2 activity was blocked by a subset of serine and cysteine protease inhibitors. These results establish that MIC2 is proteolytically modified at multiple sites by two distinct enzymes that probably operate on the parasite surface. human foreskin fibroblast polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane cytochalasin D l-1-chloro-3-[4-tosylamido]-7-amino-2-heptanone HCl N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-methioninal monoclonal antibody excretory secretory antigen Cell invasion is a critical step during infection of susceptible hosts by intracellular protozoan parasites. Although the mechanisms of parasite invasion vary considerably, a common theme includes the participation of parasite-derived proteases that have been described inLeishmania (1.Russell D.G. Wilhelm H. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 2613-2620PubMed Google Scholar), Trypanosoma cruzi (2.Caler E.V. Vaena de Avalos S. Haynes P.A. Andrews N.W.

Parasitol. 1986; 62: 416-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In contrast, apart from a recent description of the effects of serine protease inhibitors (6.Conseil V. Soete M. Dubremetz J.-F. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1358-1361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), little is known regarding the involvement of proteases in host cell invasion by the related apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. T. gondii is a widely distributed intracellular protozoan that parasitizes virtually all warm-blooded vertebrates, including humans. T. gondii tachyzoites (a rapidly dividing stage responsible for acute infection) actively invade host cells in several discrete steps. First, the parasite uses gliding motility to emerge from an infected cell, to move across the substratum, and to reach adjacent host cells (7.Hakansson S. Morisaki H. Heuser J. Sibley L.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3539-3547Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Second, the parasite adheres via its apical (anterior) pole to the host cell (8.Aikawa M. Komata Y. Asai T. Midorikawa O. Am. J. Pathol. 1977; 87: 285-296PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Nichols B.A. O'Connor G.R. Lab. Invest. 1981; 44: 324-335PubMed Google Scholar). Third, using contractile proteins, including actin and myosin, the parasite penetrates the host cell (10.Dobrowolski J.M. Sibley L.D. Cell. 1996; 84: 933-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 11.Dobrowolski J.M. Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) to form a parasitophorous vacuole, in which it rapidly proliferates to produce additional infective tachyzoites. Notably,T. gondii is capable of invading a wide variety of host cells in vitro, suggesting that it expresses ligands that recognize receptors commonly expressed on the surface of vertebrate cells. Consistent with this idea, recent studies suggest that T. gondii uses ubiquitously expressed glycosaminoglycans as one of its receptors for invasion of host cells (12.Ortega-Barria E. Boothroyd J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1267-1276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). 1V. B. Carruthers and L. D. Sibley, unpublished data. 1V. B. Carruthers and L. D. Sibley, unpublished data. Although ligands used by T. gondii to attach to host cells have yet to be characterized in detail, recent studies suggest that some adhesins may be released from apical secretory organelles called micronemes. For example, MIC1 possesses two degenerate adhesive sequences related to a domain of thrombospondin, and it is capable of binding host cells in vitro (13.Fourmaux M.N. Achbarou A. Mercereau-Puijalon O. Biderre C. Briche I. Loyens A. Odberg-Ferragut C. Camus D. Dubremetz J.-F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 83: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Similarly, the 115-kDa antigen MIC2 harbors several thrombospondin-like repeat sequences (M-domain) and an integrin-like adhesive domain (I-domain) (14.Wan K.-L. Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Ajioka J.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). One or both of these adhesive domains may be responsible for the host cell binding activity recently demonstrated for MIC2 (15.Carruthers, V. B., Giddings, O. K., and Sibley, L. D. (2000) Cell. Microbiol., in pressGoogle Scholar). MIC2 is mobilized from the micronemes to occupy the parasite apical surface at the time of attachment to host cells (16.Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 114-123PubMed Google Scholar). Thereafter, MIC2 relocates to the posterior end of the tachyzoite as the parasite penetrates into the host cell (15.Carruthers, V. B., Giddings, O. K., and Sibley, L. D. (2000) Cell. Microbiol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Collectively, these findings suggest that while on the cell surface, MIC2 participates in adhesion. Consistent with this model, a homologue of MIC2 expressed by Plasmodiumsporozoites is essential for invasion of host cells (17.Sultan A.A. Thathy V. Frevert U. Robson K.J. Crisanti A. Nussenzweig V. Nussenzweig R.S. Menard R. Cell. 1997; 90: 511-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Although we have previously shown that MIC2 is shed into the culture medium as several similarly sized species (14.Wan K.-L. Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Ajioka J.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 18.Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), the molecular details of this presumed proteolytic processing remain obscure. Here we show that two distinct parasite-derived proteases, denoted MPP1 and MPP2, process MIC2 at its C and N termini, respectively. We show here that MPP1 cleaves MIC2 proximal to its transmembrane anchor, releasing the adhesive domains of MIC2 into the culture medium, whereas MPP2 functions by trimming the N terminus of MIC2 down to the beginning of the integrin-like adhesive domain. T. gondii strain 2F was propagated in human foreskin fibroblast (HFF)2 cells as described (10.Dobrowolski J.M. Sibley L.D. Cell. 1996; 84: 933-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Tachyzoites were harvested from lysed out HFF cells after a 2-day passage by twice passing them through a 20-gauge needle followed by filtration through a 3-μm pore size membrane to remove host cell debris. Tachyzoites were washed twice by centrifugation (1000 ×g, 10 min, room temperature) in invasion medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 3% fetal bovine serum, and 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5) prior to use in experiments. For protease inhibitor experiments, tachyzoites (4 × 107/ml of invasion medium) were incubated for 3 min at 37 °C with 1% (v/v) ethanol to stimulate microneme secretion. For all other analytical secretion experiments, tachyzoites were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C before they were cooled to 0 °C to stop further secretion. Tachyzoites were removed by centrifugation (twice at 1000× g, 10 min, 4 °C) and supernatants were mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 2.0% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (see below). To measure the effect of pH on MIC2 processing, tachyzoites were pelleted and resuspended in invasion medium containing 25 mm Tris and 25 mm bis-Tris propane at pH 5.75, 6.00, 6.25, 7.4, 8.5, 8.75, or 9.00 before assaying for secretion as described above. For cytochalasin D (CytD) and protease inhibitor experiments, tachyzoites were preincubated for 10 min at room temperature with 1% Me2SO (solvent control); 1 μm CytD; 5 μm pepstatin; 10 mm EDTA (sodium salt); 10 mm EGTA (sodium salt); 2 mm1,10-phenanthroline; 50 μg/ml matrix metalloprotease-1 inhibitor (MMP-1); 1, 10, or 50 μm 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin; 100 μm TLCK; 100 μm(4-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride; 10, 100, or 200 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl)fluoride hydrochloride; 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride; 10 μg/ml chymostatin; 23 mm leupeptin; 10 μmE-64; and 40 μg/ml calpain inhibitor I (N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN)) or 40 μg/ml calpain inhibitor II (N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-methioninal (ALLM)) before being assayed for secretion as described above. Protease inhibitors were purchase from either Sigma or Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Except where otherwise noted, proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and semidry-transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blotting. Western blotting was performed as described previously (14.Wan K.-L. Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Ajioka J.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) using mAb 6D10 (ascites, 1:10,000), mouse anti-C-terminal domain antibody (MαC-dom; 1:10,000), rabbit anti-SAG1 antibody (1:5000), rabbit anti-Tg actin antibody (1:10,000), or mouse anti-H4 antibody (1:5:000). A subcellular fraction enriched in micronemes was prepared using a hybrid protocol derived from two previous studies (19.Dubremetz J.-F. Dissous C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1980; 1: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 20.Kawazoe U. Tomley F.M. Frazier J.A. Parasitology. 1992; 104: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼4 × 109 tachyzoites were harvested and resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 mm HEPES and 1 mm EGTA (HHE buffer ) at 0 °C. The parasite suspension was sonicated (2 × 15-s pulses, setting 35 on a Biosonik III sonicator (Bronwill Scientific) equipped with a microprobe) on ice. Lysis was determined to be >90% by microscopic examination. Unbroken parasites and large cellular debris were removed by successive centrifugation steps at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and at 8000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Intact micronemes were recovered by centrifugation at 30,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. Most secretory proteins from other secretory organelles (dense granules and rhoptries) remained in the 30,000 × g supernatant (data not shown). The 30,000 × g pellet was rinsed once with HHE buffer and resuspended in bis-Tris propane (25 mm, pH 6.0)-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl) containing 100 μm TLCK, 100 μm (4-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride, 2.3 mm leupeptin, 10 μm E-64, and 40 μg/ml ALLN. Saponin (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 0.01% (w/v), and the fraction was incubated for 10 min at 4 °C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant containing the enriched microneme protein fraction was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Western blot analysis demonstrated that this fraction was enriched >20-fold for micronemal antigens over most other secretory antigens (i.e.from dense granules or rhoptries) or surface antigens. For large-scale ESAs, ∼3 × 109 tachyzoites were resuspended in HHE buffer and preincubated for 10 min at room temperature with 1% Me2SO, 40 μg/ml ALLN, or 1 μm CytD. Microneme secretion was stimulated by incubation at 37 °C for 10 min with 1% (v/v) ethanol (21.Carruthers V.B. Moreno S.N.J. Sibley L.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Tachyzoites were removed by centrifugation (1200 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and culture supernatants containing ESAs were concentrated 20-fold in Centricon-10® concentrators (Amicon, Inc.), aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. The enriched microneme fraction and large-scale ESA preparations were mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 2.0% 2-mercaptoethanol and heated at 95 °C for 3 min. Proteins (∼5 μg/lane) were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to Immobilon® PSQ membranes (Millipore Corp.), and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Bands were excised and subjected to Edman degradation on a Perkin-Elmer Biosystems Model 477A Gas-Phase Protein Sequencer. For determining the membrane topology of surface MIC2 during invasion, HFF monolayers grown in Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nunc, Inc.) were pulse-infected with tachyzoites and stained as described previously (16.Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 114-123PubMed Google Scholar). Where indicated, saponin (0.05%) was used to permeabilize parasites. Parasites were stained with affinity-purified RαrM2 (1:10) (14.Wan K.-L. Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Ajioka J.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and MαC-dom (1:200; see below for description) followed by fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). Slides were examined and photographed on a Zeiss Axioscope equipped for phase-contrast and epifluorescence microscopy. Preparation of recombinant MIC2 (ectodomain) has been described previously (14.Wan K.-L. Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Ajioka J.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). DNA encoding the C-terminal domain of MIC2 (residues 727–769) was polymerase chain reaction-amplified (94 °C for 5 min and then 20 cycles of 94 °C for 40 s, 65 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min) from a tachyzoite cDNA library (22.Wan K.-L. Blackwell J.M. Ajioka J.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 75: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) using Klentaq polymerase (Invitrogen) and primers MICW.721.F (5′-AGTTACCACTACTATTTGAGCT-3′) and MICW.2306.R (5′-GATCCTCGAGCTACTCCATCCACATATCACT-3′). The resulting polymerase chain reaction product was gel-purified and digested withSacI (which cleaved a natural restriction site present at nucleotide 2182 relative to the first nucleotide of the initiator methionine) and XhoI (which cleaved at a site engineered into MICW.2306.R). The restricted polymerase chain reaction product was then gel-purified again and ligated intoSacI/XhoI-digested and gel-purified pScreen1b (Novagen). This resulted in a translational fusion of the T7 phage gene 10 product (encoded by pScreen1b) to the C-terminal domain of MIC2. The ligation mixture was electrotransformed into Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue, and the resulting transformants were screened for inserts. A randomly chosen clone bearing the C-terminal domain insert was transferred to E. coli strain BL21 for expression. Gene 10/C-terminal domain fusion protein was purified by nickel chelation chromatography using a His-Bind column (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gene 10 protein (expressed by pScreen1b) was also purified in the same manner. For production of antisera to gene 10 protein and gene 10/C-terminal domain fusion protein, Balb/c mice were immunized with 30 μg of each protein in Freund's complete adjuvant. At 2-week intervals, mice were twice boosted with 8 μg of protein, and blood was collected by cardiac puncture 3 weeks after the final boost. Antiserum to the fusion protein is referred to as MαC-dom. Freshly harvested tachyzoites (∼5 × 108) were resuspended in invasion medium containing 1 μm CytD and used to infect monolayers of HFFs by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C with CO2. Following infection, monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 at room temperature and treated with Me2SO (negative control) or 50 μg/ml sulfosuccinimidobiotin (Pierce) in Me2SO for 30 min at room temperature. Monolayers were washed and solubilized (1 h, 0 °C) in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA (sodium salt)) supplemented with 10 μg/ml RNase A, 20 μg/ml DNase I, and protease inhibitors (see above). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). After adjustment to pH 8.0 with 1 m NaOH, streptavidin-agarose (Sigma) was added (50% slurry in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with agitation. Streptavidin-agarose beads were pelleted by centrifugation (1000 × g, 1 min, room temperature), and proteins in the supernatant (SA-S) were acetone-precipitated and solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Streptavidin-agarose beads were washed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and proteins in the pellet (SA-P) were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were aliquoted and stored at −20 °C. We have previously shown that MIC2 is released into the culture medium from extracellular tachyzoites as a secreted/excreted antigen (ESA) (14.Wan K.-L. Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Ajioka J.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar,18.Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The released forms of MIC2 (MIC295–100) were 15–20 kDa smaller than cellular MIC2 (MIC2115) when analyzed by SDS-PAGE, suggesting that the released forms are proteolytically processed. To examine this further, we used a mAb (6D10) specific to the M-domain of MIC2 (Fig. 1 A) and a mouse anti-C-terminal domain antibody (MαC-dom) to determine if they could recognize the released forms of MIC2 (MIC295–100). The results (Fig. 1 B) indicate that although mAb 6D10 recognized both the cellular and released forms (MIC2115 and MIC295–100, respectively), MαC-dom recognized only the cellular form (MIC2115). These results imply that the released forms (MIC295–100) were produced by proteolytic removal of the C-terminal domain from the cellular form (MIC2115) and that this event was coincident with release of MIC295–100 into the supernatant (ESA). These experiments were carried out in the absence of host cells, suggesting that a parasite-derived protease was responsible for generating the released forms (MIC295–100). We named this protease MPP1 (microneme proteinprotease 1). The 15–20-kDa size reduction we observed for MIC2 after release is also consistent with cleavage occurring just N-terminal to the transmembrane sequence. Although the released forms (MIC295–100) were easily detectable in the ESA fraction, we failed to detect the C-terminal peptide either in the parasites or in the ESA fraction, even after long exposures. We also failed to detect the C-terminal peptide after briefly treating parasites with highly effective stimulators of microneme secretion, including A23187 (18.Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and ethanol (21.Carruthers V.B. Moreno S.N.J. Sibley L.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) (data not shown). These results suggest that the C-terminal peptide is rapidly degraded after removal from the cellular form (MIC2115). In a previous study, we showed that MIC2 is secreted onto the apical surface of the parasite during attachment, and then it redistributes to the posterior end as the parasite penetrates into the host cell (15.Carruthers, V. B., Giddings, O. K., and Sibley, L. D. (2000) Cell. Microbiol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Having demonstrated that the released forms of MIC2 (MIC295–100) do not possess the C-terminal domain, we wanted to determine whether surface MIC2 retains the C-terminal domain. To do this, we used immunofluorescence microscopy and antibodies specific to the extracellular adhesive domains (RαrM2) and the C-terminal domain (MαC-dom). In the presence of saponin, both antibodies exclusively stained the apical region of extracellular parasites (Fig. 2, first row), indicating that they specifically recognize the micronemes by immunofluorescence. Consistent with the results of a previous study (16.Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 114-123PubMed Google Scholar), little or no detectable fluorescence staining for MIC2 was observed on the surface of extracellular parasites in the absence of detergent (data not shown). During invasion of host cells, RαrM2 detected MIC2 on the posterior surface of the parasite regardless of whether the cells were permeabilized (Fig. 2, second andthird rows), consistent with the presence of MIC2 on the surface of the parasite during invasion as described previously (15.Carruthers, V. B., Giddings, O. K., and Sibley, L. D. (2000) Cell. Microbiol., in pressGoogle Scholar). In contrast, MαC-dom recognized only MIC2 on the posterior end of parasites that were permeabilized with saponin (Fig. 2, second row). Collectively, these results indicate that the C-terminal domain remains associated with MIC2 as it translocates toward the posterior end of the parasite. Since MIC2 possesses a hydrophobic sequence of sufficient length to span a membrane (14.Wan K.-L. Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Ajioka J.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), these results suggest that MIC2 is a transmembrane protein while on the parasite surface. Several lines of evidence suggest that the C-terminal cleavage of MIC2 is a functionally important event both prior to and during invasion. Prior to invasion, extracellular parasites secrete MIC2 at a low basal rate, mobilizing it from the micronemes to the parasite surface as an integral membrane protein (this study and Ref. 18.Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Since no evidence of re-internalization has been observed, it appears that C-terminal cleavage serves to remove MIC2 from the parasite surface, thereby preventing its accumulation and limiting its vulnerability as a target for neutralizing antibodies. During invasion, microneme secretion is significantly up-regulated (16.Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 114-123PubMed Google Scholar), and an increased amount of MIC2 is discharged onto the parasite's surface, where some of it localizes to the moving junction (15.Carruthers, V. B., Giddings, O. K., and Sibley, L. D. (2000) Cell. Microbiol., in pressGoogle Scholar), which is a zone of tight apposition of the parasite and host cell membranes formed at the time of apical attachment. The moving junction is thought to be the site of parasite ligand and host receptor engagement (23.Dubremetz J.-F. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 27-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Recent binding studies suggest that MIC2 is capable of binding to host cell receptors (15.Carruthers, V. B., Giddings, O. K., and Sibley, L. D. (2000) Cell. Microbiol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Interestingly, full-length MIC2 (MIC2115) readily bound to host cells, whereas the C-terminally processed forms (MIC295–100) failed to bind. These data suggest that C-terminal cleavage reduces the affinity of the adhesive domains for host cell receptors. Thus, C-terminal cleavage may be responsible for disengaging receptors just prior to completing invasion. This is probably a key event since receptor disengagement at the terminal stage of penetration is likely a prerequisite for fission of the parasitophorous vacuole and the host plasma membrane. To further characterize the surface form of MIC2, we treated parasites with CytD, which arrests parasites at the stage of apical attachment. Immunofluorescence staining of CytD-arrested parasites confirmed that MIC2 was present on the apical surface of attached parasites (Fig.3 A). To specifically label surface MIC2, we used the non-membrane-permeable, amine-reactive compound sulfosuccinimidobiotin. After surface biotinylation, infected monolayers were detergent-solubilized and incubated with streptavidin-agarose. Centrifugation was used to partition biotinylated proteins into the streptavidin pellet fraction (SA-P) and unlabeled proteins into the supernatant (SA-S). Although we expected to detect the full-length cellular form of MIC2 (MIC2115) on the parasite surface (SA-P fraction), surprisingly little of this form was detected. Instead, a species migrating at 110 kDa (MIC2110) was apparent (Fig. 3 B). This ∼5-kDa reduction in apparent molecular mass was not due to biotin labeling because other labeled parasite proteins (e.g. SAG1) did not exhibit a change in mobility. The sharp appearance and slower mobility of the MIC2110 band clearly distinguished it from the released forms (MIC295–100) detected in an ESA preparation. Also, unlike the released forms (MIC295–100), surface MIC2 (MIC2110) possessed at least some portion of the C-terminal domain, based on reactivity with MαC-dom (Fig. 3 B). It is possible that the surface form (MIC2110) was generated by limited proteolysis of the C-terminal domain, leaving at least one epitope recognized by MαC-dom. However, since removal of ∼5 kDa from the C terminus of the cellular form (MIC2115) would likely eliminate the entire C-terminal domain, these results suggest that MIC2 is instead processed at its N terminus while on the parasite surface. As controls for labeling and partitioning, we probed Western blots with antibodies to SAG1, a well characterized surface antigen, and actin, a cytosolic marker. As expected, SAG1 was mainly in SA-P, whereas parasite actin was exclusively in SA-S (Fig. 3 B). Similarly, unlabeled cellular MIC2 (MIC2115) from micronemal stores was detected in SA-S (Fig. 3 B). Since studying proteolytic processing of surface MIC2 is limited by the low amounts of material, we decided to further characterize the protease(s) that act upon MIC2 by monitoring the proteolytic products present in ESA (i.e. MIC295–100). To examine the sensitivity of the MIC2 protease(s) to protease inhibitors, we treated extracellular tachyzoites with inhibitors effective against each class of protease. As shown in Fig.4 A, proteolytic processing of MIC2 was affected by a subset of protease inhibitors, including chymostatin and two calpain inhibitors, ALLN and ALLM. These compounds inhibited the formation of the smallest species of MIC2 (MIC295). Although they partially inhibited microneme secretion (based on detection of a control unprocessed microneme protein, H4 (24.Johnson A.M. Illana S. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 99: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)), chymostatin, ALLN, and ALLM did not substantially affect the release of MIC2 from the surface of the parasite, suggesting that they inhibit a protease that is distinct from MPP1. Thus, we will hereafter call the MIC295-forming protease MPP2. Although calpain-like proteases typically require calcium for high level activity, chelating calcium with EGTA had little or no effect on the formation of MIC295. Furthermore, calpain proteases are sensitive to leupeptin and E-64 (25.Kumar A. Shafiq S. Wadgaonkar R. Stracher A. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1992; 38: 477-483PubMed Google Scholar), which had no effect on MPP2 activity. Thus, despite the effectiveness of calpain inhibitors, these observations suggest that MPP2 may not be a calpain-like enzyme. Rather, based on its inhibition by chymostatin, MPP2 may be a chymotrypsin-like serine protease. Several other protease inhibitors affected the amount of MIC2 in ESA by inducing parasite lysis or by affecting microneme secretion directly. For example, EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline produced partial lysis of parasites based on detection of a control cytoplasmic protein, β-galactosidase. Despite inducing some parasite lysis, the main effect of 1,10-phenanthroline was an inhibition of microneme secretion based on reduced abundance of MIC2 and H4 in ESA. Independently, 1,10-phenanthroline was observed to inhibit the secretion of MIC2 and MIC4 by extracellular parasites. 3J. L. Lovett and L. D. Sibley, unpublished data. The highest concentration of dichloroisocoumarin tested (50 μm) also inhibited microneme secretion, whereas lower concentrations had an inducing effect. Notably, high concentrations of dichloroisocoumarin were recently found to inhibit tachyzoite invasion of host cells (6.Conseil V. Soete M. Dubremetz J.-F. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1358-1361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since microneme secretion is likely required for invasion of host cells (15.Carruthers, V. B., Giddings, O. K., and Sibley, L. D. (2000) Cell. Microbiol., in pressGoogle Scholar), our current results suggest that the inhibitory effects of dichloroisocoumarin on parasite invasion may be related to an inhibition of microneme secretion rather than an effect of proteolysis. On the other hand, we found that 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl)fluoride hydrochloride actually stimulated microneme secretion, yet it markedly inhibited tachyzoite invasion (6.Conseil V. Soete M. Dubremetz J.-F. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1358-1361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that a serine protease(s) activity (unrelated to MIC2 processing) may indeed be required for efficient invasion of host cells. In an experiment to determine the pH optimum for proteolytic processing of MIC2, we found that MPP2 was inactive below pH 6.25 (Fig.4 B). MPP2 activity also appeared to be inhibited at pH >8.5, although the total amount of released MIC2 also declined above this pH. These results suggest that MPP2 is likely a neutral protease. Previously, we demonstrated that the posterior re-localization of MIC2 occurs in the absence of host cells and is blocked by CytD (18.Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), suggesting that MIC2 is associated with the actin cytoskeleton of the parasite. To determine if CytD affects MIC2 processing, we preincubated extracellular tachyzoites with CytD before preparing an ESA fraction from the treated parasites. As shown in Fig. 5, CytD treatment resulted in preferential accumulation of the smallest released form of MIC2 (MIC295) in the ESA fraction. CytD did not directly alter migration of MIC2 on SDS-polyacrylamide gels since addition of CytD to ESAs prepared from untreated tachyzoites failed to produce the same effect (data not shown). A possible explanation for these results is that MPP2 may be restricted to the apical surface of the tachyzoite and that CytD treatment traps surface MIC2 in the same vicinity, thereby facilitating processing before release into the supernatant. As described above, two species of MIC2 (MIC2115 and MIC2110) were detectable on the surface of apically attached parasites. Also, since MIC2110 has an intact C terminus, it is likely the product of N-terminal proteolytic processing of MIC2115. Since the size differential between the surface forms of MIC2 (∼5 kDa) is the same as that between the secreted forms (MIC2100 and MIC295), we hypothesized that MIC295 is also a product of N-terminal processing. To test this hypothesis, we determined the N-terminal sequences of MIC2115 and the secreted forms of MIC2 using large-scale ESA preparations and a subcellular fraction of tachyzoites that is enriched in micronemal antigens (Fig.6 A). Unambiguous sequences were obtained for each species of MIC2, and these were found to match sequences in the N-terminal region of MIC2 (Fig. 6 B) (14.Wan K.-L. Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Ajioka J.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). An 8-residue N-terminal sequence (SIVDALRK) from cellular MIC2 (MIC2115) matched a sequence adjacent to the predicted secretory leader peptide, indicating that cellular MIC2 is not secondarily processed during transit through the secretory pathway or storage in micronemes. These data are consistent with earlier data from pulse-chase metabolic labeling experiments showing that MIC2 does not change in size for at least 1 h after it is synthesized (26.Achbarou A. Mercereau-Puijalon O. Autherman J.M. Fortier B. Camus D. Dubremetz J.-F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 47: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The same N-terminal sequence (SIVDALRK) was also obtained from the largest released form (MIC2100), enriched by ALLN treatment, confirming that this form corresponds to MIC2115 minus the C-terminal domain. The smallest released form (MIC295, CytD-enriched) yielded an N-terminal sequence (AAEGCTNQL) that began 38 amino acids downstream of the N terminus of cellular MIC2 (MIC2115). A mixture of sequences (one primary and one secondary) was obtained from the species of MIC2 present in the 95–98-kDa region of ESA prepared in the absence of drug. No obvious tertiary or quaternary sequences were observed during analysis of the 95–98-kDa species, suggesting that two incompletely processed species predominated. Since their production was inhibited by ALLN, these species (MIC295–98) are likely the result of N-terminal processing by MPP2. Taken together, these results suggest that MPP2 cleaves MIC2 at several sites in its N terminus, culminating in the production of MIC295, which is the fully processed species. The functional significance of MPP2 processing of MIC2 is unclear since only a fraction of the secreted MIC2 is N-terminally processed. Furthermore, chymostatin or ALLN failed to significantly reduce tachyzoite invasion of host cells in vitro (data not shown). Further experiments will be required to determine whether N-terminal processing of MIC2 has a subliminal effect on invasion, perhaps by increasing the affinity of MIC2 for receptors or by altering its interaction with other parasite proteins. We demonstrate here that MIC2 is modified by two parasite-derived proteases, MPP1 and MPP2, following its secretion from the micronemes. MPP1 and MPP2 are likely active on the surface of the parasite based on the following observations. 1) In tachyzoite lysates, MIC2 is a single species of 115 kDa, suggesting that MIC2 is not proteolytically modified during storage in micronemes. 2) On the surface of apically attached tachyzoites, N-terminal truncation of MIC2 reduces its size by ∼5 kDa, which is consistent with modification by MPP2. 3) Kinetic analysis (data not shown) of MIC2 species in ESA suggests that MPP2 does not act upon MIC2 after it is released from the parasite. 4) The C-terminal domain of MIC2 is not detectable on the released forms of MIC2 (MIC295–100), suggesting that MPP1 acts upon MIC2 coincident with its release from the tachyzoite. Based on the above evidence, we constructed a model that depicts the most likely genesis of each of the MIC2 species observed (Fig.7). We propose that cellular MIC2 (MIC2115) is mobilized from the micronemes to the tachyzoite surface membrane, where it experiences one of two alternative fates. If cellular MIC2 immediately encounters MPP2, MPP2 cleaves its N terminus to generate the predominant surface form of MIC2 (MIC2110). Subsequent C-terminal cleavage of surface MIC2 by MPP1 then generates the smallest released form of MIC2 (MIC295). Alternatively, if cellular MIC2 encounters MPP1 first, MPP1 cleaves the C terminus of MIC2, generating the largest released form of MIC2 (MIC2100). However, the presence of multiple species of MIC2 (MIC295–100) in the culture supernatants indicates that N-terminal processing by MPP2 is often incomplete at the time of C-terminal cleavage by MPP1. We observed that CytD, which prevents the posterior re-localization of MIC2 (18.Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), enhanced N-terminal processing of MIC2 by MPP2. This indicates that MPP2 may be restricted to the apical surface of the parasite since CytD treatment would effectively trap MIC2 with MPP2, thereby increasing the likelihood of N-terminal processing. Although it remains uncertain where MPP1 is located, the observation that surface MIC2 retains its C-terminal domain as it translocates rearward during parasite invasion suggests that MPP1 may cleave MIC2 on the posterior surface of the parasite. However, MPP1 may not be strictly limited to the posterior surface since CytD treatment does not affect MPP1-mediated release of MIC2 from the parasite in the absence of host cells (e.g.Fig. 5). Together with this work, earlier studies suggest that proteolytic processing may be a common mechanism for releasing adhesive proteins from invasive apicomplexan parasites. For example, the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of Plasmodium knowlesi DBP-1 (Duffy-bindingprotein-1) is proteolytically removed upon release of the DBP-1 ectodomains into the culture medium (27.Adams J.H. Hudson D.E. Torii M. Ward G.E. Wellems T.E. Aikawa M. Miller L.H. Cell. 1990; 63: 141-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Also, the 235-kDa erythrocyte-binding antigen of Plasmodium yoeliiis a transmembrane protein that is proteolytically processed upon release into the culture supernatant (28.Ogun S.A. Holder A.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 76: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Finally, MSP-1 (major surfaceprotein-1) of Plasmodium falciparumis proteolytically released from the surface of merozoites during invasion of erythrocytes (29.Blackman M.J. Holder A.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 50: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Since adhesive proteins play a key role in attachment and invasion of target host cells, inhibition of these processing events may therefore inhibit parasite invasion, offering a potential target for therapeutic intervention. Future studies involving the molecular characterization of parasite-derived proteases such as MPP1 and MPP2 should shed light upon the precise role of proteases in invasion of host cells by T. gondii.

Görlich D. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Moreover, the Sec61 complex is involved in the recognition of the signal sequence regulating the insertion of the nascent polypeptide chain into the translocation channel (8.Jungnickel B.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The ribosome-bound Sec61 complex is in spatial proximity to several other membrane components that interact with the nascent polypeptide chain during its co-translational translocation. These components include the translocating chain-associated membrane protein (TRAM) (10.Görlich D. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), the signal peptidase complex (SPC) (11.Evans E.A. Gilmore R. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Whereas the functions of the SPC and the oligosaccharyltransferase complex are well established, the role of the other components is at best poorly understood or completely unknown. Vectorial co-translational protein translocation into the ER can be reconstituted in the absence of chaperones using proteoliposomes consisting exclusively of the SRP receptor (essential for the SRP-dependent targeting step (17.Gilmore R. Blobel G. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 195: 463-469Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar)), the Sec61 complex, and TRAM (4.Görlich D. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 615-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). However, other data suggest that chaperones in the ER lumen play a stimulatory role during translocation in vitro (18.Nicchitta C.V. Blobel G.

Zimmermann R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6931-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Moreover, the Hsp70 homolog BiP is likely involved in the formation of a tight seal that blocks ion transport across the Sec61 complex in the absence of protein translocation (20.Hamman B.D. Hendershot L.M. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 747-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar).In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in the absence of tightly bound ribosomes, the trimeric Sec61p complex is found associated with other polypeptides (Sec62p, Sec63p, Sec71p, and Sec72p) (21.Deshaies R.J. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 22.Hartmann E. Sommer T. Prehn S. Görlich D. Jentsch S. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 1994; 367: 654-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), which together form the Sec complex (23.Deshaies R.J. Sanders S.L. Feldheim D.A. Schekman R. Nature. 1991; 349: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The yeast Sec complex is essential and sufficient for the post-translational protein translocation into the ER (24.Panzner S. Dreier L. Hartmann E. Kostka S. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 561-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Sec63p has a DnaJ-like domain located in the ER lumen (25.Feldheim D. Rothblatt J. Schekman R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3288-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), which recruits the Hsp70 homolog Kar2p to the translocation sites. The DnaJ domain of Sec63p and Kar2p form a molecular ratchet that is responsible for the ATP-dependent vectorial movement of the polypeptide into the ER lumen (26.Matlack K.E. Misselwitz B. Plath K. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 553-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In contrast to Sec62p, Sec63p, and Kar2p, neither Sec71p nor Sec72p are essential for post-translational translocation (27.Rothblatt J.A. Deshaies R.J. Sanders S.L. Daum G. Schekman R. J.

It is possible that components of the Sec complex are also involved in other cellular processes. Mutations in Kar2p, Sec71p, Sec72p, and Sec63p affect karyogamy in yeast (30.Rose M.D. Misra L.M. Vogel J.P. Cell. 1989; 57 (Correction (1989) 58, 801): 1211-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 31.Ng D.T. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and there is genetic evidence that Sec61p, Sec63p, and Kar2p are involved in the ubiquitin- and proteasome-dependent degradation of proteins at the ER (32.Pilon M. Schekman R. Römisch K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4540-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 33.Plemper R.K. Bohmler S. Bordallo J. Sommer T. Wolf D.H.

Chem. 1999; 274: 3453-3460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar).In mammalian cells it is also the case that not all Sec61 complexes are tightly associated with ribosomes (35.Görlich D. Prehn S. Hartmann E. Kalies K.U. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 489-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). To date, however, homologs of neither the yeast Sec62-Sec63 subcomplex nor other membrane components found preferentially associated to ribosome-free Sec61 complexes have been identified. We therefore set out to identify and characterize such proteins of the mammalian ER.We show here, that the mammalian ER contains proteins that display structural homology to the yeast Sec62p and Sec63p. Both proteins are expressed ubiquitously, and their abundance is similar to that of known components of the ER translocation machinery. To gain an indication as to the function of these proteins, we analyzed their molecular environment in the ER using different biochemical methods. We found that Sec62 and Sec63 are associated with Sec61 complexes, indicating that these proteins might be involved in transport processes similar to those performed by the yeast Sec complex. The association was only detectable in the absence of tightly bound ribosomes. This suggests that the function of Sec62 and Sec63 is most likely not directly linked to the co-translational protein translocation across the mammalian ER.DISCUSSIONThe data presented here demonstrate that the mammalian Sec61α can be found in a protein complex with structural similarity to the yeast Sec complex. In addition to the components of the trimeric Sec61 complex, Sec61α, Sec61β, and Sec61γ, this larger complex contains at least two other membrane proteins. These proteins, Sec62 and Sec63, display homology to the yeast proteins Sec62p and Sec63p, respectively. Remarkably, for both proteins, regions with significant homology were those exposed to the ER lumen or located close to the cytosolic surface of the membrane. The more distal cytosolic parts were very divergent. While this manuscript was in preparation, Skowronek et al.(40.Skowronek M.H. Rotter M. Haas I. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1999; 380: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) also published the existence of the mammalian Sec63 and showed that it has the same membrane topology as the yeast protein. Both Sec62 and Sec63 were ubiquitously expressed in the rough ER of mammals, and the expression level of Sec62 in a particular tissue is roughly the same in all species tested. However, we cannot exclude that the abundance of Sec63 differs between species, because the epitope recognized by our anti-Sec63 antibodies is not conserved among mammals. Sec62 was also very abundant in smooth membranes that are essentially free of Sec61 complex. This is in agreement with our observation that Sec62 is expressed at high levels in the adrenal gland 2H. Grau and E. Hartmann, unpublished information. and that the mRNA is abundant not only in liver and pancreas but also in muscle tissues (39.Daimon M. Susa S. Suzuki K. Kato T. Yamatani K. Sasaki H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).Although Sec62 and Sec63 were abundantly expressed, the actual concentration of Sec61-Sec62-Sec63 complexes in the ER appears to be relatively low. Regardless of the detergent used, and whether the purification started with RM or with PK-RM, only about 5% of Sec61 and about 30% of Sec63 were found in a complex. In each case the molar ratio between Sec61α and Sec63 in the complex appeared to be 1:1 to 1:2. The binding of Sec63 to the complex was stable, whereas the association of Sec62 with this complex was much weaker. Under optimized purification conditions, we found about 15% of the Sec62 co-purified with Sec61β. However, in the cross-linking experiment 30% of the Sec62 was linked to Sec61β. In the same samples less than 5% of the Sec61β was in proximity to Sec62, similar to that found with Sec63. Therefore the amount of Sec62 and Sec63 in these complexes was likely to be the same. If one assumes that 3 to 4 pentameric Sec61-Sec62-Sec63 units form a translocation pore as it has been shown for the trimeric complex (5.Hanein D. Matlack K.E. Jungnickel B. Plath K. Kalies K.U. Miller K.R. Rapoport T.A. Akey C.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), then not more than 5% of all pores in the mammalian rough ER have a Sec-like structure.What could be the function of the mammalian Sec61-62-63 complexes? Despite the clear differences between the cytosolic domains of this complex and the yeast Sec complex, one may speculate that the mammalian Sec61-62-63 may also perform post-translational protein translocation into the ER. However, so far no efficient post-translational translocation has been observed in mammals. Proteins that translocate post-translationally across yeast membranes in vitro, like the prepro-α-factor or the prepro-OmpA, do not do so across mammalian RM (46.Wiedmann M. Wiedmann B. Voigt S. Wachter E. Muller H.G. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1763-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The only natural substrates known to enter the mammalian ER after termination of their synthesis in a signal sequence-dependent manner are short membrane protein precursors such as M13 procoat (41.Watts C. Wickner W. Zimmermann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2809-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) or short precursors of hydrophobic secretory proteins like prepro-cecropin (42.Zimmermann R. Mollay C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12889-12895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Zimmermann R. Sagstetter M. Schlenstedt G. Biochimie (Paris). 1990; 72: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that these proteins may require membrane proteins for their translocation (42.Zimmermann R. Mollay C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12889-12895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Klappa P. Zimmermann M. Zimmermann R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 281-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, it remains possible that their transport is independent of membrane components as has been found for M13 procoat in Escherichia coli (45.Wolfe P.B. Rice M. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1836-1841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We were not able to identify Sec62 or Sec63 in association with ribosome-bound Sec61 complexes. However, this does not exclude that the Sec61-Sec62-Sec63 complexes translocate nascent polypeptide chains that are in the process of being synthesized by ribosomes not tightly bound to the translocation site. Another possibility is that the Sec61-Sec62-Sec63 complex performs the backward transport of ER proteins that are subject to the ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation pathway as it has been suggested for the yeast Sec complex (32.Pilon M. Schekman R. Römisch K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4540-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 33.Plemper R.K. Bohmler S. Bordallo J. Sommer T. Wolf D.H.

These populations could represent a pool that under appropriate conditions form Sec61-Sec62-Sec63 complexes. Alternatively, these molecules may perform functions while loosely associated with a subset of co-translational translocation sites. For example, they could recruit BiP molecules to resting trimeric Sec61 complexes in order to seal the pores, in alignment with a previous suggestion (20.Hamman B.D. Hendershot L.M. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 747-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). They may also assist in the release of the translocational pausing of polypeptides such as the apolipoprotein B (47.Chuck S.L. Yao Z. Blackhart B.D. McCarthy B.J. Lingappa V.R. Nature. 1990; 346: 382-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).The identification of a Sec-like complex in mammals again demonstrates the high degree of evolutionary conservation of the translocation machinery in the ER among eukaryotic organisms. However, the extent to which this structural similarity results in functional homology remains to be determined. The mammalian Sec61 complex consisting of Sec61α, Sec61β, and Sec61γ has been identified as a crucial membrane component involved in the signal recognition particle (SRP)1-dependent co-translational protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (for review see Ref. 2.Rapoport T.A. Jungnickel B. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 271-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The Sec61 complex forms the hydrophilic pore in the membrane through which the nascent polypeptide is translocated (3.Simon S.M. Blobel G. Cell. 1991; 65: 371-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 4.Görlich D. Rapoport T.A.

Science. 1997; 278: 2123-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), and it is responsible for the tight binding of the ribosome to the ER membrane during the co-translational transport process (7.Kalies K.U. Görlich D. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Moreover, the Sec61 complex is involved in the recognition of the signal sequence regulating the insertion of the nascent polypeptide chain into the translocation channel (8.Jungnickel B. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 261-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 9.Mothes W. Jungnickel B. Brunner J. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The ribosome-bound Sec61 complex is in spatial proximity to several other membrane components that interact with the nascent polypeptide chain during its co-translational translocation. These components include the translocating chain-associated membrane protein (TRAM) (10.Görlich D. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), the signal peptidase complex (SPC) (11.Evans E.A. Gilmore R. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1992; 69: 55-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), the translocon-associated protein (TRAP) complex (15.Wiedmann M. Kurzchalia T.V. Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 1987; 328: 830-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and the ribosome-associated membrane protein 4 (RAMP4) (4.Görlich D. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 615-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 16.Schröder K. Martoglio B. Hofmann M. Holscher C. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. Dobberstein B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4804-4815Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Whereas the functions of the SPC and the oligosaccharyltransferase complex are well established, the role of the other components is at best poorly understood or completely unknown. Vectorial co-translational protein translocation into the ER can be reconstituted in the absence of chaperones using proteoliposomes consisting exclusively of the SRP receptor (essential for the SRP-dependent targeting step (17.Gilmore R. Blobel G. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 195: 463-469Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar)), the Sec61 complex, and TRAM (4.Görlich D. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 615-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). However, other data suggest that chaperones in the ER lumen play a stimulatory role during translocation in vitro (18.Nicchitta C.V. Blobel G. Cell. 1993; 73: 989-998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 19.Dierks T. Volkmer J. Schlenstedt G. Jung C. Sandholzer U. Zachmann K. Schlotterhose P. Neifer K. Schmidt B. Zimmermann R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6931-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Moreover, the Hsp70 homolog BiP is likely involved in the formation of a tight seal that blocks ion transport across the Sec61 complex in the absence of protein translocation (20.Hamman B.D. Hendershot L.M. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 747-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in the absence of tightly bound ribosomes, the trimeric Sec61p complex is found associated with other polypeptides (Sec62p, Sec63p, Sec71p, and Sec72p) (21.Deshaies R.J. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 22.Hartmann E. Sommer T. Prehn S. Görlich D. Jentsch S. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 1994; 367: 654-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), which together form the Sec complex (23.Deshaies R.J. Sanders S.L. Feldheim D.A. Schekman R. Nature. 1991; 349: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The yeast Sec complex is essential and sufficient for the post-translational protein translocation into the ER (24.Panzner S. Dreier L. Hartmann E. Kostka S. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 561-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Sec63p has a DnaJ-like domain located in the ER lumen (25.Feldheim D. Rothblatt J. Schekman R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3288-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), which recruits the Hsp70 homolog Kar2p to the translocation sites. The DnaJ domain of Sec63p and Kar2p form a molecular ratchet that is responsible for the ATP-dependent vectorial movement of the polypeptide into the ER lumen (26.Matlack K.E. Misselwitz B. Plath K. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 553-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In contrast to Sec62p, Sec63p, and Kar2p, neither Sec71p nor Sec72p are essential for post-translational translocation (27.Rothblatt J.A. Deshaies R.J. Sanders S.L. Daum G. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2641-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 28.Vogel J.P. Misra L.M. Rose M.D. J.

It is possible that components of the Sec complex are also involved in other cellular processes. Mutations in Kar2p, Sec71p, Sec72p, and Sec63p affect karyogamy in yeast (30.Rose M.D. Misra L.M. Vogel J.P. Cell. 1989; 57 (Correction (1989) 58, 801): 1211-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 31.Ng D.T. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and there is genetic evidence that Sec61p, Sec63p, and Kar2p are involved in the ubiquitin- and proteasome-dependent degradation of proteins at the ER (32.Pilon M. Schekman R. Römisch K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4540-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 33.Plemper R.K. Bohmler S. Bordallo J. Sommer T. Wolf D.H.

Chem. 1999; 274: 3453-3460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells it is also the case that not all Sec61 complexes are tightly associated with ribosomes (35.Görlich D. Prehn S. Hartmann E. Kalies K.U. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 489-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). To date, however, homologs of neither the yeast Sec62-Sec63 subcomplex nor other membrane components found preferentially associated to ribosome-free Sec61 complexes have been identified. We therefore set out to identify and characterize such proteins of the mammalian ER. We show here, that the mammalian ER contains proteins that display structural homology to the yeast Sec62p and Sec63p. Both proteins are expressed ubiquitously, and their abundance is similar to that of known components of the ER translocation machinery. To gain an indication as to the function of these proteins, we analyzed their molecular environment in the ER using different biochemical methods. We found that Sec62 and Sec63 are associated with Sec61 complexes, indicating that these proteins might be involved in transport processes similar to those performed by the yeast Sec complex. The association was only detectable in the absence of tightly bound ribosomes. This suggests that the function of Sec62 and Sec63 is most likely not directly linked to the co-translational protein translocation across the mammalian ER. DISCUSSIONThe data presented here demonstrate that the mammalian Sec61α can be found in a protein complex with structural similarity to the yeast Sec complex. In addition to the components of the trimeric Sec61 complex, Sec61α, Sec61β, and Sec61γ, this larger complex contains at least two other membrane proteins. These proteins, Sec62 and Sec63, display homology to the yeast proteins Sec62p and Sec63p, respectively. Remarkably, for both proteins, regions with significant homology were those exposed to the ER lumen or located close to the cytosolic surface of the membrane. The more distal cytosolic parts were very divergent. While this manuscript was in preparation, Skowronek et al.(40.Skowronek M.H. Rotter M. Haas I. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1999; 380: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) also published the existence of the mammalian Sec63 and showed that it has the same membrane topology as the yeast protein. Both Sec62 and Sec63 were ubiquitously expressed in the rough ER of mammals, and the expression level of Sec62 in a particular tissue is roughly the same in all species tested. However, we cannot exclude that the abundance of Sec63 differs between species, because the epitope recognized by our anti-Sec63 antibodies is not conserved among mammals. Sec62 was also very abundant in smooth membranes that are essentially free of Sec61 complex. This is in agreement with our observation that Sec62 is expressed at high levels in the adrenal gland 2H. Grau and E. Hartmann, unpublished information. and that the mRNA is abundant not only in liver and pancreas but also in muscle tissues (39.Daimon M. Susa S. Suzuki K. Kato T. Yamatani K. Sasaki H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).Although Sec62 and Sec63 were abundantly expressed, the actual concentration of Sec61-Sec62-Sec63 complexes in the ER appears to be relatively low. Regardless of the detergent used, and whether the purification started with RM or with PK-RM, only about 5% of Sec61 and about 30% of Sec63 were found in a complex. In each case the molar ratio between Sec61α and Sec63 in the complex appeared to be 1:1 to 1:2. The binding of Sec63 to the complex was stable, whereas the association of Sec62 with this complex was much weaker. Under optimized purification conditions, we found about 15% of the Sec62 co-purified with Sec61β. However, in the cross-linking experiment 30% of the Sec62 was linked to Sec61β. In the same samples less than 5% of the Sec61β was in proximity to Sec62, similar to that found with Sec63. Therefore the amount of Sec62 and Sec63 in these complexes was likely to be the same. If one assumes that 3 to 4 pentameric Sec61-Sec62-Sec63 units form a translocation pore as it has been shown for the trimeric complex (5.Hanein D. Matlack K.E. Jungnickel B. Plath K. Kalies K.U. Miller K.R. Rapoport T.A. Akey C.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), then not more than 5% of all pores in the mammalian rough ER have a Sec-like structure.What could be the function of the mammalian Sec61-62-63 complexes? Despite the clear differences between the cytosolic domains of this complex and the yeast Sec complex, one may speculate that the mammalian Sec61-62-63 may also perform post-translational protein translocation into the ER. However, so far no efficient post-translational translocation has been observed in mammals. Proteins that translocate post-translationally across yeast membranes in vitro, like the prepro-α-factor or the prepro-OmpA, do not do so across mammalian RM (46.Wiedmann M. Wiedmann B. Voigt S. Wachter E. Muller H.G. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1763-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The only natural substrates known to enter the mammalian ER after termination of their synthesis in a signal sequence-dependent manner are short membrane protein precursors such as M13 procoat (41.Watts C. Wickner W. Zimmermann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2809-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) or short precursors of hydrophobic secretory proteins like prepro-cecropin (42.Zimmermann R. Mollay C. J. Biol.

The body of CaM KIIα is gear-shaped, consisting of six slanted flanges, and has six foot-like processes attached by narrow appendages to both ends of the flanges. Truncated CaM KIIα that lacks functional domains has a structure that is very similar to the body of CaM KIIα. Thus, the functional domains reside in the foot-like processes, and the association domain comprises the gear-shaped core. The ribbon diagram of the bilobate structure of CaM KI fits nicely in the envelope of the foot-like component and indicates that the crevice between the two lobes comprising the functional domains is near the middle portion of the foot. The clustering of the functional domains provides a favorable arrangement for the autophosphorylation reaction, and the unusual arrangement of the catalytic domain on extended tethers appears to be significant for the remarkable functional diversity of CaM KIIα in cellular regulation. Studies of the structural organization of calcium/ calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα (CaM KIIα) and truncated CaM KIIα by three-dimensional electron microscopy and protein engineering show that the structures consist of 12 subunits that are organized in two stacked hexameric rings with 622 symmetry.

Its relatively high concentration in brain tissue and its lack of specificity indicate that it has an important role as a kinase in many aspects of neuronal function. Its substrates are involved in neurotransmitter synthesis and release; carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism; transcriptional, translational, and cytoskeletal regulation; calcium homeostasis; and receptor and channel function (for reviews, see Refs. 1.Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar and 2.Braun A.P. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). At least four distinct genes that encode isozymes of CaM KII are selectively expressed in different tissues (2.Braun A.P. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Expression of the α and β isoforms is restricted primarily to the nervous system, and the α isoform is found only in neurons. The abundance of α and β isoforms is both anatomically and developmentally regulated in the nervous system (3.Kelly P.T. Vernon P. Brain Res. 1985; 350: 211-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 4.Burgin K.E. Waxham M.N. Rickling S. Westgate S.A. Mobley W.C. Kelly P.T. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1788-1798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that the subunit composition of holoenzymes may influence the targeting of the enzyme to distinct subcellular sites, such as the postsynaptic density (5.Kennedy M.B. Bennett M.K. Erondu N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7357-7361Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 6.Miller S.G. Kennedy M.B. J. Biol.

A. 1984; 81: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). For example, recent investigations have shown that the β isoform is preferentially bound to F-actin in dendritic spines and in the cell cortex and that the α isoform is targeted to these locations when it is co-expressed with the β isoform (8.Shen K. Meyer T. Science. 1999; 284: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Studies have implicated the α isoform of CaM KII in neuronal cell function. Electrophysiological and behavioral tests in mice carrying a null mutation for the α isoform showed that this enzyme has a major role in control of neuronal excitability (9.Butler L.S. Silva A.J. Abeliovich A. Watanabe Y. Tonegawa S. McNamara J.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6852-6855Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and spatial learning (10.Silva A.J. Paylor R. Wehner J.M. Tonegawa S. Science. 1992; 257: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). Indeed, this isoform is thought to have a key role in the long lasting synaptic enhancement denoted long term potentiation (11.Silva A.J. Stevens C.F. Tonegawa S. Wang Y. Science. 1992; 257: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar, 12.Lledo P.-M. Hjelmstad G.O. Mukherji S. Soderling T.R. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

CaM KII is dependent on Ca2+/calmodulin for activation, and its autophosphorylation has an important role in regulating its activity. Autophosphorylation involves Thr-286 in the autoregulatory domain of the enzyme that results in a Ca2+/calmodulin-independent activity (14.Thiel G. Czernik A.J. Gorelick F. Nairn A.C. Greengard P.

Neuron. 1988; 1: 593-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and a major increase in Ca2+/calmodulin binding affinity (16.Meyer T. Hanson P.I. Stryer L. Schulman H.

These phenomena may provide for the unique functions of CaM KII for signal processing in neurons (17.Hanson P.I. Meyer T. Stryer L. Schulman H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 943-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 19.Lisman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this regard, a point mutation at Thr-286 blocked the autophosphorylation of CaM KIIα, and the mice containing this mutation exhibited deficits in long term potentiation and spatial learning similar to those exhibited by mice bearing the null mutation of this isoform (23.Giese K.P. Fedorov N.B. Filipkowski R.K. Silva A.J. Science. 1998; 279: 870-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequences of the α and β isoforms show that they have extensive homology; the primary difference between them is the addition of two variable inserts in the β subunit C-terminal to the calmodulin-binding domain (24.Bulleit R.F. Bennett M.K. Molloy S.S. Hurley J.B. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1988; 1: 63-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Enzymatic studies of the α and β isozymes of CaM KII indicate that they have similar functions and show little difference in substrate specificity (1.Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Initial biophysical studies indicated that CaM KII isolated from either rat forebrain or cerebellum is a multisubunit complex that contains varying ratios of the α and β subunits. The forebrain (M r 650,000) and cerebellar (M r 508,000) enzymes consist predominantly of the α and β isoform, respectively (6.Miller S.G. Kennedy M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9039-9046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.McGuinness T.L. Lai Y. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1696-1704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and electron microscopy studies support this distribution (26.Kanaseki T. Ikeuchi Y. Sugiura H. Yamauchi T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The images produced by rotary shadowing indicated that the holoenzyme consists of 8–10 spokes radiating from a central core 100 Å in diameter to give an overall dimension of 330 Å. The distal ends of the spokes had a bulbous shape, and these features were described as “lollipops.” It has been proposed that these lollipops comprise the regulatory/catalytic region because they were reported to bind Ca2+/calmodulin. It was proposed from visual analysis of the individual images that CaM KII isolated from the cerebellum and forebrain is organized as octamers and decamers, respectively. In addition, immune electron microscopy studies employing α-specific antibodies indicated that only the decamers were labeled and, consequently, that the two oligomeric complexes are comprised of either α or β subunits (26.Kanaseki T. Ikeuchi Y. Sugiura H. Yamauchi T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, this proposal is at variance with other studies that indicated that the holoenzyme is comprised of a mixture of both subunits (6.Miller S.G. Kennedy M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9039-9046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Brocke L. Chiang L.W. Wagner P.D. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22713-22722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that stain images of the homo-oligomeric skeletal muscle CaM KII consist of hexameric rings 100 Å in diameter, but these images did not display the lollipops. From electron microscopy studies and biophysical data, it was proposed that the structure is a dodecamer consisting of two stacked hexameric rings (28.Woodgett J.R. Davison M.T. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 136: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Even though the studies of Kanaseki et al. (26.Kanaseki T. Ikeuchi Y. Sugiura H. Yamauchi T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) indicate that there might be significant structural differences between these isoforms, it is not possible to relate these differences to the three-dimensional structure of the complexes. In this regard, the proposed binding of calmodulin at the distal ends of the lollipops was not supported by a difference map analysis, and the noisy particle images are difficult to interpret and do not permit an unambiguous location of calmodulin. Moreover, the proposed distribution of the two forms in specific regions of the brain is uncertain because the distribution may be influenced by the relative affinity of the two forms for the carbon support. Unfortunately, the functional diversity of CaM KII cannot be related to its structure. As part of our initial structural studies of the CaM KII isoforms, we have determined the three-dimensional structures of the CaM KIIα and truncated CaM KIIα (residues 315–478) complexes employing three-dimensional electron microscopy. The latter subunit lacking the catalytic and regulatory domains was previously shown to self-associate into an oligomeric complex (29.Kolb S.J. Hudmon A. Ginsberg T.R. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31555-31564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Comparisons of the reconstructions reveal a unique organization of the structural core and functional domains of CaM KIIα that appear to contribute to its remarkable functional attributes. The cDNA of the coding sequence of the rat CaM KIIα subunit was cloned into the pBakPak baculovirus expression vector (CLONTECH). Recombinant baculovirus was prepared and recombinant enzyme was purified as described previously (18.Putkey J.A. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29619-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 29.Kolb S.J. Hudmon A. Ginsberg T.R. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31555-31564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). CaM KIIα prepared in this manner is an oligomer with a sedimentation coefficient of 17 S and a Stokes radius of 85 Å (29.Kolb S.J. Hudmon A. Ginsberg T.R. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31555-31564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The specific activity of CaM KIIα preparations utilized in the present study was approximately 19 μmol/min/mg, and the protein was >90% pure when analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. To construct the association domain, a polymerase chain reaction fragment was produced beginning at amino acid 315 and extending to the native stop codon of the α subunit (amino acid 478). This fragment was cloned into the Hta version of the Bac-to-Bac vector (Life Technologies, Inc.), and recombinant virus was produced as described (29.Kolb S.J. Hudmon A. Ginsberg T.R. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31555-31564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The truncated α protein is fused to an N-terminal His tag and linker sequence that increases the predicted molecular mass to 22,189 from 18,477 Da. The proteins isolated from infected Sf21 cells were concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation (29.Kolb S.J. Hudmon A. Ginsberg T.R. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31555-31564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and purified by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen). The His-tagged fusion protein was eluted from the Ni2+-NTA resin with 100 mm imidazole and used immediately for imaging. The oligomer purified by this means had a sedimentaion coefficient of 10 S and a Stokes radius of 49 Å (29.Kolb S.J. Hudmon A. Ginsberg T.R. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31555-31564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The Ni2+-NTA purification provided protein that was >90% pure as analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and was at suitable concentrations (15 μg/ml) for electron microscopy imaging. A 6-μl sample of CaM KIIα (15 μg/ml) in 10% (w/v) glycerol, 50 mm Hepes, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 500 mm KCl (pH 7.4) was added to the carbon side of a freshly prepared carbon-coated Formvar grid, and the excess was removed by wicking with bibulous paper. The bound particles were washed 3 times with 6 μl of 0.25% methylamine tungstate stain containing 10 μg/ml bacitracin as a wetting agent; the excess stain solution was removed by wicking with bibulous paper. Stain images were acquired at × 50,000 with a JEOL JEM 1200 electron microscope operating at 100 kV using conventional irradiation procedures. The 50° tilted images were recorded with an underfocus of ∼1 μm at the center of the stage, and the corresponding untilted images were obtained at ∼0.5 μm underfocus. Non-tilted images for the three-dimensional projection alignment method and iterative reconstruction were obtained by applying the preparation at 15 μg/ml to the carbon grid and recorded at ∼1 μm underfocus as described above. tCaM KIIα in 20 mmTris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, 100 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% (w/v) glycerol (pH 8.5) was added to the carbon film as described above, and the non-tilted images were recorded at an underfocus of ∼0.5 μm as described previously. For cryo-electron microscopy, a 3-μl sample of CaM KIIα (70 μg/ml) in 50 mm HEPES, 500 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol (pH 7.4) was deposited on a glow-discharged carbon-coated holey grid, and the excess was removed by blotting with filter paper. The grid was rapidly cooled in liquid ethane, specimens were kept below −170 °C in a Gatan cold holder, and the images were recorded at × 50,000 with ∼1.7 μm underfocus at an exposure of ∼9 e/Å2 using Kodak SO 163 film. Micrographs were digitized using an Eikonix 1412 scanner with a 12-bit dynamic range and a pixel size of 5.7 Å on the specimen scale. Power spectra from the micrograph were analyzed for astigmatism and drift. Micrographs showing significant frost, astigmatism, or drift were rejected. Particles were selected in 64 × 64-pixel boxes using the SUPRIM software package (30.Schroeter J.P. Bretaudiere J.-P. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The particle data sets consisted of 5166 CaM KIIα (stain), 4758 CaM KIIα (frozen hydrated), and 2914 tCaM KIIα (stain) particle images. These latter images were digitized with a Zeiss SCAI scanner at a pixel size of 2.8 Å on the specimen scale. Average images of the characteristic views were obtained by extracting particles representative of the 6-fold and the two 2-fold views and subjecting them to a reference-free alignment using the SPIDER software (31.Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P.A. Zhou J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar). A random conical tilt (RCT) reconstruction was performed using the 50°-tilted images corresponding to the 6-fold view by the weighted back projection of a random conical tilt series (32.Radermacher M. J. Electron Microsc. Technol. 1988; 9: 359-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) using the SUPRIM image processing system (30.Schroeter J.P. Bretaudiere J.-P. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Symmetry was not applied to the reconstruction. The approach developed by Kolodziej et al. (33.Kolodziej S.J. Penczek P.A. Stoops J.K. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 120: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) using three-dimensional projection alignment and iterative reconstruction was employed to compute the structure from untilted stain and ice images. A set of quasi-uniformly distributed reference projections (34.Penczek P.A. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1994; 53: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) using the non-symmetrized RCT reconstruction as the initial model was generated within θ = 0–90° and Φ = 0–360° with angular steps of 2°. After the initial angular alignment, a reference-based translation alignment of the boxed images was performed by cross-correlating the particle images with the projection of the preliminary structure to the orientation of the particle image (35.Zhou Z.H. He J. Jakana J. Tatman J.D. Rixon F.J. Chiu W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1026-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The newly computed structure that appeared to have 622 symmetry was used in the subsequent alignment and iterative reconstructions. The resulting stain structure of CaM KIIα was used as the model to generate the reference projections for the initial frozen hydrated reconstruction. tCaM KIIα projection images were generated from the stain CaM KIIα model to which a three-dimensional mask was applied to remove the exterior foot processes. Two passes of refinement achieved a stable resolution value for the reconstructions. The resolution values of the reconstructions were measured by the Fourier shell correlation with a Fourier ring criterion of 0.67 (36.Unser M. Trus B.L. Stevens A.C. Ultramicroscopy. 1987; 23: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The structures were Fermi-filtered with a temperature parameter of 0.01 (37.Frank J. Uerschoor A. Wagenknecht T. Wu T.T. New Methodologies in Studies of Protein Conformation. Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York1985: 36-86Google Scholar) to the resolution value of the reconstruction, and the frozen hydrated reconstruction was corrected for the contrast transfer function of the electron microscope (38.Stoops J.K. Baker T.S. Schroeter J.P. Kolodziej S.J. Niu X.-D. Reed L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24769-24775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The solid shaded structures were thresholded to a volume that corresponds to their approximate molecular weight, and the images were rendered using the Explorer software (NAG Inc., Downer's Grove, IL). The wire frame presentation of tCaM KIIα was obtained using SYNU software (39.Hessler D. Young S.J. Carragher B. Martone M. Hinshaw J. Milligan R. Masliah E. Whittaker M. Lamont S. Ellisman M. Layman C.E. Peachey L.D. Fisher R.M. Microscopy: The Key Research Tool. EMSA, Milwaukee, WI1992: 73-82Google Scholar). A gallery of the molecular images shows the 6-, 2-, and 2-fold views and their corresponding average images for CaM KIIα in stain (Fig.1 A) and ice (Fig.1 B) and for tCaM KIIα (Fig. 1 C). The 6-fold views have the shape of a hexagonal ring consisting of six blobs of higher density. The two 2-fold side views of the molecule consist of two side-by-side rings or a single ring similar to that in the 6-fold view (Fig. 1). It is apparent that the images are noisy and of low contrast, making it difficult to distinguish between the views for the purpose of selecting the 6-fold views of CaM KIIα for the initial stain RCT reconstruction. The second row of images was enhanced by applying a Butterworth filter (40.Gonzalez R.C. Wintz P. Digital Image Processing. 2nd Ed. Addison-Wesley, London1987: 170-171Google Scholar) to the corresponding “raw” images above. Consequently, the arrangement of the peripheral density adjacent to the higher contrast central image becomes more apparent, making it possible to distinguish between the ring-like 6- and 2-fold views. The 6-fold and 2-fold views have peripheral density that forms a ring or brackets above and below the central ring, respectively (Fig.1 A). The tCaM KIIα also exhibits similarly shaped images of central density as CaM KIIα but lacks the peripheral density (Fig.1 C). Accordingly, the RCT structure was used as a model to align the non-tilted stain specimen, and the corresponding structure was similarly employed as a model to compute the structure of the frozen hydrated specimen. Finally, the peripheral density associated with the stain structure was truncated with a three-dimensional mask to give a core structural model to align the images of tCaM KIIα. The obtainment of these structures using an initial stain RCT model to align non-tilted stain and ice images (33.Kolodziej S.J. Penczek P.A. Stoops J.K. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 120: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) further extends the utility of this approach in three-dimensional electron microscopy (41.Kolodziej S.J. Penczek P.A. Schroeter J.P. Stoops J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28422-28429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 42.Qazi U. Gettins P.G.W. Stoops J.K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 8137-8142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The stain and ice structures, their projections (Fig. 2), and their corresponding average images (Fig. 1) show good concordance, indicating that the reconstructions are reliable. Even though the non-symmetrized RCT structure is noisy because of the limited number of 6-fold views in the data set (Fig. 2 A), this model produced a structure that appeared 622 symmetric, and consequently, 622 symmetry was imposed on the model-based reconstructions (Fig. 2,B–D). The CaM KIIα structures consist of a gear-shaped body that is approximately 140 Å in diameter with a height of 100 Å. There are six openings on the 2-fold axis that lead into a central cavity that traverses the length of the core. The six slanted cogs of the gear (flanges) have 12 foot-like processes attached by a narrow appendage (six each to the outer edge at the top and bottom of the flanges). The heel of the foot is tilted approximately 30° away from the 6-fold axis of the structure so that the foot resides peripheral to the core. The appendages double the height of the core to 200 Å. These appendages are responsible for the ring of density surrounding the central core and extend the diameter of the image in 6-fold view to ∼200 Å (Fig. 1, A and B). The lollipop extensions were reported to form a ring with a diameter of 330 Å in images of CaM KII isolated from the brain (26.Kanaseki T. Ikeuchi Y. Sugiura H. Yamauchi T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The significant size difference of the length of these extensions may be related to differences in the structures of the wild type and α isoform. The protein density distributions in the projections of the CaM KIIα central core and tCaM KIIα are similar and indicate that the structures consist of 12 subunits arranged in two sets of six subunits that form stacked hexagonally shaped rings in agreement with the structure proposed for the skeletal muscle complex (28.Woodgett J.R. Davison M.T. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 136: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The structure of tCaM KIIα (M r 221,000), which lacks the N-terminal catalytic and calmodulin-binding domains (Fig.3), is very similar to the central core structure of CaM KIIα (compare Fig. 2, B andD). Consequently, we conclude that the core structure of CaM KIIα comprises the association domain and that the foot processes comprise the catalytic domain (Fig. 3). The foot-like extensions at the top and bottom of the CaM KIIα core indicate that the subunits are arranged in a tail-to-tail fashion in both structures (Fig. 3). A gallery of 1-pixel thick (5.7 Å) slices cut normal to the 6-fold axis of the structures shows their protein density distribution (Fig. 4). The six triangular to rod-shaped components that comprise the slices of the strands in the core structure have their highest density and connectivity in slices that reside about halfway toward the middle of the core, and the strands rotate approximately 60° from the top to the bottom of the complex. At an increased threshold the lower density middle slice disappears, indicating that two subunits are juxtapositioned near the middle of the core (data not shown). We propose that the CaM KIIα dodecamer may form as a hexamer of dimers. The structures of CaM KIIα and tCaM KIIα are consistent with the physicochemical characterization of these complexes (29.Kolb S.J. Hudmon A. Ginsberg T.R. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31555-31564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Gel filtration chromatography, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and sedimentation velocity studies showed that the subunits form stable complexes of 600 kDa (CaM KIIα) and 204 kDa (tCaM KIIα) with subunit composition of approximately 11 and 9 for the intact structure and its core, respectively. Our reconstructions indicate that both complexes are dodecameric (Fig. 2), leading to calculatedM r of 649,000 (CaM KIIα) and 221,000 (tCaM KIIα) from their residue composition. The Stokes radii of tCaM KIIα and CaM KIIα are 49 and 85 Å, respectively, showing that the intact subunit forms a complex that is significantly larger than that formed by the truncated subunit. The size difference between tCaM KIIα (100 Å) and CaM KIIα (200 Å) is consistent with the different values of the Stokes radii for the two structures (Fig. 2). This study and previous studies (29.Kolb S.J. Hudmon A. Ginsberg T.R. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31555-31564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) show that the C-terminal residues 315–478 (Fig. 3) are responsible for the oligomer formation of CaM KIIα, and this study shows that the structure of tCaM KIIα forms the core of CaM KIIα (Figs. 2 and5 A) and that the N-terminal catalytic domain (residues 1–309, Fig. 3) is associated with the foot-like extensions of the core. The sequence identity between the catalytic and calmodulin domains of CaM KI and CaM KIIα is 45%, indicating that this portion of the two structures is likely to be similar (45.Goldberg J. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 84: 875-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Indeed, a comparison of the low resolution filtered x-ray structure of CaM KI and the foot-like extension of CaM KIIα shows that they have a similar morphology (Fig. 5 B). Because it was noted previously that all eukaryotic protein kinases share a conserved catalytic core that has a characteristic bilobate architecture with the active site situated at the interface between the two lobes (45.Goldberg J. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 84: 875-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), we propose that the active site is located near the middle portion of the foot, which also accommodates the catalytic and calmodulin-binding domains (Fig. 5 B). A three-dimensional structure of CaM KIIα with calmodulin bound will better define the location of these components in the foot-like appendages. The N- and C-terminal functional and association domains of the α and β isozymes exhibit >90% and 76% amino acid sequence identity, respectively (24.Bulleit R.F. Bennett M.K. Molloy S.S. Hurley J.B. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1988; 1: 63-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 29.Kolb S.J. Hudmon A. Ginsberg T.R. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31555-31564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Consequently, we predict that the β isozyme has a dodecameric core that is very similar to the gear-shaped core of tCaM KIIα (Fig. 2 D) and that its N-terminal functional domain is similar to the foot-like appendage of CaM KIIα (Fig. 2, B and C). In support of this notion, the molecular masses of the α and β isozymes are similar (α, 600 kDa and β, 663 kDa) (29.Kolb S.J. Hudmon A. Ginsberg T.R. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31555-31564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and their average images of the central hexagon-shaped ring of the 6-fold views are indistinguishable (data not shown). The unique domain in the β subunit (residues 314–387) is positioned between the association and functional domains, which would appear to place it in the neck region of CaM KIIα between its core and foot-like appendages. Such an arrangement may result in a different orientation for this functional component in the β complex that may be significant in its targeting to distinct subcellular sites in neurons (5.Kennedy M.B. Bennett M.K. Erondu N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7357-7361Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 6.Miller S.G. Kennedy M.B. J. Biol.

The location of the functional components (the catalytic, calmodulin-binding domains and the Thr-286) on extended tethers at each end of the core complex is an unusual macromolecular architecture. In contrast, most enzyme structures are organized so that their functional components are an integral part of the molecule. Yet this organization appears well suited for the function of the complex. The clustering of six functional domains appears to optimize the autophosphorylation reactions of the Thr-286 that require the juxtaposition of two of the foot processes so that the catalytic domain of one may phosphorylate the Thr-286 on the other. Even though the significant distance between the foot-like extensions does not permit the close encounter required for the autophosphorylation reaction, the binding of calmodulin to these components may optimize their orientation for the autophosphorylation. In this regard, Ca2+/calmodulin, which is required to bind to proximate subunits for autophosphorylation (46.Rich R.C. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28424-28429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), is known to undergo a significant conformational change upon interaction with the binding domain of CaM KII (47.Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). This interaction could also affect the conformation of the catalytic domains so that pairs of foot processes are in the proper orientation. Because there are three pairs of juxtapositional catalytic domains, we propose that the initial autophosphorylation event involves nearest neighbors followed by the autophosphorylation of the remaining three domains. The structure shows that the two sets of catalytic centers 200 Å removed presumably function independently of each other. A considerable body of evidence implicates CaM KIIα as an essential component of the long lasting synaptic enhancement denoted long term potentiation (reviewed in Ref. 13.Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Science. 1999; 285: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the long term potentiation involves the phosphorylation of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor by CaM KIIα (48.Barria A. Muller D. Derkach V. Griffith L.C. Soderling T.R. Science. 1997; 276: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). The arrangement of six catalytic domains clustered in close proximity seems well suited for the kinase to phosphorylate the predicted five subunits of the AMPA receptor simultaneously or in rapid succession. The extended arrangement of the catalytic domains may serve to promote access to the sites of phosphorylation on the receptor. Because the N-methyl-d-aspartate and AMPA receptors are juxtapositioned on the dendritic spine (13.Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Science. 1999; 285: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar), the arrangement of the two catalytic centers, one at each end of the CaM KIIα structure, may be optimally arranged to phosphorylate the receptors in response to Ca2+ influx. Furthermore, the interdigitation of the gear-shaped cores would permit a close packing arrangement of the CaM KIIα complexes with the receptors that may be important in the postsynaptic signaling system. As indicated previously, CaM KII is involved in numerous biological processes, and the present example of its putative role in the neuronal dendritic spine is just one example of how its unusual architecture appears to be well suited to meet its multifunctional requirements in biology. We have determined the structure of CaM KIIβ, and even though its structure is slightly more extended than CaM KIIα, their architectures are very similar. We recognize the invaluable aid of Amy Parada in the production of the manuscript and of Dr. Hong Zhou in the production of some of the figures."
https://openalex.org/W2023681929,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an epithelial Cl− channel whose activity is controlled by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation. We found that CFTR immunoprecipitates from Calu-3 airway cells contain endogenous PKA, which is capable of phosphorylating CFTR. This phosphorylation is stimulated by cAMP and inhibited by the PKA inhibitory peptide. The endogenous PKA that co-precipitates with CFTR could also phosphorylate the PKA substrate peptide, Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (kemptide). Both the catalytic and type II regulatory subunits of PKA are identified by immunoblotting CFTR immunoprecipitates, demonstrating that the endogenous kinase associated with CFTR is PKA, type II (PKA II). Phosphorylation reactions mediated by CFTR-associated PKA II are inhibited by Ht31 peptide but not by the control peptide Ht31P, indicating that a protein kinase A anchoring protein (AKAP) is responsible for the association between PKA and CFTR. Ezrin may function as this AKAP, since it is expressed in Calu-3 and T84 epithelia, ezrin binds RII in overlay assays, and RII is immunoprecipitated with ezrin from Calu-3 cells. Whole-cell patch clamp of Calu-3 cells shows that Ht31 peptide reduces cAMP-stimulated CFTR Cl− current, but Ht31P does not. Taken together, these data demonstrate that PKA II is linked physically and functionally to CFTR by an AKAP interaction, and they suggest that ezrin serves as an AKAP for PKA-mediated phosphorylation of CFTR.

Rev. 1999; 79 Suppl. 1: 3-22Crossref Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In secretory epithelia, CFTR is often the rate-determining step in salt and water transport, accounting for impairments in fluid secretion observed in patients having CFTR mutations. To date, more than 800 mutations in CFTR have been observed in patients with cystic fibrosis, but relatively few of these (∼5%) are found in the regulatory domain of CFTR (CFTR data base, available on the World Wide Web), perhaps because of its functional importance. The key regulatory pathway determining CFTR activity involves elevation of cAMP and activation of protein kinase A (PKA) (2.Gadsby D.C. Nairn A.C Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79 Suppl. 1: 77-107Crossref Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Nine consensus sites for PKA phosphorylation lie in the central R domain region of CFTR. An important issue in the regulation of epithelial cell secretion has been the specificity of this process. The receptors for cAMP-mediated secretory agonists as well as the associated adenylate cyclase are localized to the basolateral membrane, yet the principal target of activated PKA, the CFTR, is apically localized. In recent years, it has become apparent that the selective actions of signaling mediators that do not inherently possess substrate specificity (e.g. PKA) are conferred by the formation of regulatory complexes that provide privileged access of regulators to their substrates (3.Pawson T. Scott J.D Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1891) Google Scholar). Indeed, it is now appreciated that different PKA isoforms are compartmentalized in the soluble and particulate cell fractions and that the association of PKA with cytoskeletal or membrane structures is mediated primarily by a physical association between the type II regulatory subunits (RII subunits) of PKA and protein kinase A anchoring proteins (AKAPs). AKAPs are thought to sequester the regulatory and catalytic components of PKA in proximity to their substrates and thereby confer the needed specificity. Indeed, a model Cl− secretory epithelium, T84, was found to express both RI and RII isoforms of PKA; and in these cells, about 23 of total PKA activity was due to RII that was localized on cellular structures (4.Singh A.K. Tasken K. Walker W. Frizzell R.A. Watkins S.C. Bridges R.J. Bradbury N.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C562-C570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings raise the possibility that PKA may regulate CFTR via compartmental restrictions that are based on protein interactions and that this arrangement may lead to phosphorylation of CFTR at specific sites within the protein. PDZ domain proteins are emerging as important organizing centers for regulatory complexes, and these scaffold-based regulatory proteins are often polarized to specific sites in polarized epithelial cells (5.Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). For example, the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF, also termed ezrin-binding phosphoprotein 50 or EBP50) was identified initially from its ability to confer PKA-mediated inhibition of the apical Na+/H+ exchanger in rabbit renal brush border membranes (6.Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Wang Y. Shenolikar S J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The human homologue of NHERF, EBP50, binds to members of the ERM (ezrin-radixin-moesin) family of proteins (7.Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The C terminus of CFTR corresponds to a PDZ interaction motif (TRL), and it binds to the first PDZ domain of EBP50 with high affinity (8.Short D.B. Trotter K.W. Reczek D. Kreda S.M. Bretscher A.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the EBP50-CFTR association, together with other proteins that are sequestered in a regulatory complex through these physical interactions, may provide the basis for functional interactions observed between CFTR and other ion channels (11.Schwiebert E.M. Benos D.J. Egan M.E. Stutts M.J. Guggino W.B Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79 Suppl. 1: 145-166Crossref Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Recently, Mohler et al. (12.Mohler P.J. Kreda S.M. Boucher R.C. Sudol M. Stutts M.J. Milgram S.L J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 879-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). have provided evidence that a Yes-kinase-associated protein interacts with the second PDZ domain of EBP50. Accordingly, CFTR may bring other regulators, such as this Src family kinase, into its vicinity though these interactions. The functional impact of CFTR-EBP50 interactions is not fully understood, but the interaction of this PDZ domain protein with ezrin is of interest concerning its possible role in the regulation of CFTR by PKA. The PKA-dependent regulation of NHE3 is mediated by EBP50/NHERF (13.Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Tate K. Hall R.A. Spurney R.F. Shenolikar S J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2199-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), which is a known ezrin-binding protein. In addition, protein overlay methods have implicated an interaction between ezrin and the regulatory subunit of PKA (14.Dransfield D.T. Bradford A.J. Smith J. Martin M. Roy C. Mangeat P.H. Goldenring J.R EMBO J. 1997; 16: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Accordingly, ezrin's interaction with EBP50 may localize PKA in close proximity to CFTR. The purpose of this study was to examine this hypothesis using both protein interaction assays and functional measurements of CFTR activity. Our findings show that CFTR is part of a regulatory complex in human airway cells and that this complex contains ezrin and both the catalytic and regulatory subunits of PKA. Disruption of these interactions blocks CFTR- and PKA-specific substrate phosphorylation reactions. Ezrin was found at the apical membrane domain of both airway and intestinal secretory epithelia, and it bound RII in protein overlay and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Finally, in patch clamp experiments, the functional activation of CFTR by PKA could be disrupted by conditions that interfere with ezrin binding of RII. These findings provide physical and functional evidence that PKA regulation of CFTR is AKAP-mediated, and they suggest that ezrin is a CFTR-associated AKAP in secretory epithelial cells.

Protein A/G-agarose beads and molecular weight markers were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. PKA catalytic subunit, cAMP, and cAMP-agarose were purchased from Sigma. Renaissance Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. PKA inhibitor peptide (residues 5–24) (PKI) and the SignaTECTTM cAMP-dependent protein kinase assay system were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Protease inhibitor tablets and restriction endonucleases were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Phosphatase inhibitors were from Alomone (Jerusalem, Israel). Other reagent grade chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-PKA catalytic subunit antibody was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Polyclonal antibody against PKA type IIα regulatory subunit (RIIα) was purchased form Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-CFTR antibodies were from Genzyme (Framingham, MA). Monoclonal anti-GST and anti-ezrin antibodies were obtained from Sigma. Calu-3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum. Cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. T84 cells were grown under similar conditions, except that the medium contained 10% fetal bovine serum. For confocal microscopy, Calu-3 or T84 cells were seeded onto Costar Transwell cell culture inserts, and the culture media were changed every 2 days. The apical medium bathing Calu-3 cells was removed after several days in culture, and the cells were maintained at an air interface until use. Confocal microscopy (see below) was performed after 14–21 days in culture. Confluent cell monolayers were scraped into buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors) and homogenized using a Dounce type homogenizer. Postnuclear supernatants were obtained by centrifugation (14,000 × g for 1 min), and from this supernatant, cytosolic and membrane fractions were obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. Cytosolic proteins were concentrated by precipitation using 10% trichloroacetic acid and then resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol). Membrane fractions were resuspended in lysis buffer directly. Full-length ezrin cDNA (a gift from Dr. T. Hunter, Salk Institute) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the following primers: 5′-GAATTCCCGAAACCAATCAATGTC and 5′-GATATCTTACAGGGGCCTCGAACTCGTC, which resulted in the generation of an EcoRI site at the N terminus and an EcoRV site at the C terminus of ezrin (sites indicated by underlining). The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). Fidelity of the polymerase chain reaction product was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Ezrin cDNA was released by digestion of pCREzrin with EcoRI and EcoRV and then inserted into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) atEcoRI and SmaI sites. Expression and purification of GST-ezrin fusion protein or GST protein in bacteria followed the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In attempts to detect endogenous protein kinase activity associated with CFTR, precleared Calu-3 cell lysates (∼3 mg of protein) were mixed with 1 μg of anti-CFTR R domain antibody or control antibody (anti-GST) for 1.5 h at 4 °C in lysis buffer. Twenty μl of washed protein G-Sepharose beads were added to each immunoprecipitation and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. Immunocomplexes with protein G-Sepharose beads were precipitated by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 10 s and washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and once with phosphorylation buffer (50 mmTris·HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Where indicated, 4 μm Ht31 was added to CFTR immunoprecipitates to disrupt AKAP-RII subunit interactions (3.Pawson T. Scott J.D Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1891) Google Scholar). The control peptide, Ht31P, inserts a proline to disrupt the helical structure of Ht31; it was used at the same concentration. Samples were immediately subjected to phosphorylation reactions. For other co-precipitation experiments, Calu-3 cell lysates or subfractions (∼500 μg) were mixed with appropriate experimental or control antibodies at 4 °C for 1.5 h in lysis buffer with gentle rotation. Twenty μl of washed protein A- or protein G-Sepharose beads were then added to each immunoprecipitate and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 s and washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. Pellets were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated CFTR was performed as described previously (17.Bradbury N.A. Clark J.A. Watkins S.C. Widnell C.C. Smith H.S.T. Bridges R.J Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L659-L668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, immunoprecipitated CFTR was phosphorylated by endogenous kinase or by adding 5 units of PKA catalytic subunit in the presence of 0.15 μm[γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). Phosphorylation reactions were performed in the presence or absence of 10 μm cAMP and incubated at 37 °C in phosphorylation buffer for 10 min followed by two washes with lysis buffer. Phosphorylation reaction products were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and processed for autoradiography or phosphor imaging (Bio-Rad). Phosphorylation of biotinylated kemptide (amino acid sequence LRRASLG) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). 32P incorporation was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Expression, purification, and radiolabeling of RIIα were performed as described previously (18.Hausken Z.E. Coghlan V.M. Hastings C.A. Reimann E.M. Scott J.D J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24245-24251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a plasmid containing the mouse RIIα cDNA (a gift of Dr. J. D. Scott, Vollum Institute) was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) competent cells (Novagen). Expression of RIIα was achieved by adding a final concentration of 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to the bacterial culture, with incubation for 4 h at 37 °C. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in PBS with protease inhibitors. Resuspended bacteria were lysed by nitrogen cavitation and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was mixed with 10 g of ammonium sulfate at 4 °C for 15 min. Precipitated proteins were separated from soluble material by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min and then resuspended in PBS containing protease inhibitors. The resuspended material was mixed with 5 ml of cAMP-agarose for 16 h at 4 °C. Nonspecific binding was removed by washing with high salt buffer. Bound RIIα was eluted with a solution containing 25 mm cAMP. Purified RIIα was radiolabeled by incubation with [γ-32P]ATP and the catalytic subunit of PKA in phosphorylation buffer for 1 h at 30 °C. Separation of labeled RIIα from free ATP was achieved using desalting columns (Pierce). 10 μg of GST-ezrin fusion protein and GST protein were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane. The membrane was blocked in blocking buffer (5% nonfat milk, 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl) containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 3 h at room temperature and then incubated for 4 h with 100,000 cpm/ml of 32P-labeled RIIα in blocking buffer containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. For competition assays, the membrane was incubated with labeled RIIα and 4 μm of Ht31 or Ht31P peptide. Membrane was washed three times in TBST (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mmNaCl, 0.05% Tween 20), and the label was visualized by autoradiography. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Unbound sites were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% (w/v) skim milk powder in TBS (TBST lacking Tween 20). Membranes were incubated 1 h at room temperature with the appropriate primary antibodies. The membranes were then washed four times for 5 min each with TBST and incubated for 1 h with 2 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) in TBST with 10% fetal bovine serum. The blots were washed five times for 5 min each with TBST, and reactive bands were visualized by Renaissance Chemiluminescence (NEN Life Science Products). Samples were exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Calu-3 cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and used 1–3 days after seeding. Coverslips were placed in a chamber that was perfused at a rate of 7–15 ml/min with a solution of the following composition 120 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 0.4 mmKH2PO4, 1.6 mmK2HPO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm glucose. This solution was gassed with 5% CO2, 95% O2 and heated to 37 °C. The perfusion chamber was mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Nikon Diaphot). Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass tubing (Warner Instrument Corp., Hartford, CT) and filled with a solution composed of 95 mm potassium gluconate, 30 mm KCl, 1.2 mmNaH2PO4, 4.8 mmNa2HPO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm ATP, and 0.1 mm GTP. Average pipette resistance was 2–4 megaohms. Pipettes were mounted to the headstage of an EPC7 patch clamp amplifier (List Medical Instruments, Darmstadt, Germany) and advanced by a mechanical micromanipulator (Narishige, Japan). After establishing the whole-cell configuration, membrane voltage was measured in the current clamp mode of the amplifier. Then the cells were voltage-clamped to −40 mV, and the whole-cell current was recorded. To precisely measure membrane conductance, G m, impedance analysis was performed. For this purpose, four sine waves (203.45, 406.9, 813.8, and 1627.6 Hz) were superimposed onto the clamp voltage. The resulting currents were fed into a four channel lock-in amplifier (Quad synchron detector; Physiologisches Institut, Freiburg, Germany), and the respective real (R i) and imaginary (I i) parts of the currents were sampled onto a computer's hard disc. On-line analysis was performed using the program Biocap (Physiologisches Institut, Freiburg). The use of four frequencies allowed us to closely monitor changes in four parameters: pipette capacitance, access conductance, membrane conductance, and membrane capacitance. Here, we report on changes in G m. Filter-grown Calu-3 or T84 cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min followed by a permeabilization with a mixture of 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. The cells were then washed three times in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.15% glycine at pH 7.4 (buffer A). This was followed by a 30-min incubation with purified goat serum at 25 °C and three additional washes with buffer A. Cells were incubated for 1 h with a primary antibody (monoclonal IgG1 against ezrin) followed by three washes in buffer A and an incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody (Alexa 488; Molecular Probes, Inc.). The cells were then washed six times in buffer A and mounted on a glass coverslip using a synthetic resin (Gelvatol, Mosanto). Coverslips were placed on a horizontal stage and imaged using a Leica TCS-NT confocal microscope. Images were collected using a 100× plan-apochromatic oil immersion objective; pixel size in the x, y, andz axes were calibrated to satisfy Nyquist sampling (0.1-μmx/y, 0.2-μm z). Serial scans were collected using a 488-nm laser line to optimally excite the Alexa 488 fluorochrome used for labeling. Image stacks were exported to ImageSpace (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.) for subsequent reconstruction and processing. Final presentation of images uses a pseudocolor representation encompassing the black and white intensity range 0–255 as illustrated with the final images. CFTR was immunoprecipitated from Calu-3 cell lysates with an antibody against the CFTR regulatory domain (CFTR-RD). The immunoprecipitate was incubated under phosphorylation conditions with [γ-32P]ATP, which included the addition of phosphatase inhibitors (see “Experimental Procedures”), separated on SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. In the presence of cAMP, a major diffuse band (characteristic of CFTR) with a molecular mass of ∼180 kDa was phosphorylated by a protein kinase that was co-immunoprecipitated with CFTR (Fig. 1,lane 3). We examined the effect of cAMP on the endogenous kinase activity by incubating the CFTR immunoprecipitate with [γ-32P]ATP and 10 μm cAMP. The addition of cAMP promoted the phosphorylation of CFTR relative to control experiments performed in its absence (Fig. 1, comparelanes 3 and 4). The increase in γ-32P incorporation into CFTR with the addition of cAMP was ∼50% as determined by densitometry. As is routine procedure for CFTR identification (19.Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar), this band was strongly phosphorylated by the addition of the catalytic subunit of PKA to the immunoprecipitate (Fig.1, lane 1). In contrast, a Calu-3 cell immunoprecipitate generated using an irrelevant antibody (anti-GST monoclonal) did not reproduce this phosphoprotein signal (Fig. 1,lane 2). To confirm that the band phosphorylated by the endogenous kinase was CFTR, we also probed the immunoprecipitate with an anti-CFTR C terminus antibody; this immunoblot identified a similar 180-kDa diffuse band (data not shown). Next, we used a PKA-specific substrate peptide and PKI to determine whether the endogenous kinase associated with CFTR is PKA. Two experiments were performed. First, we tested whether the endogenous kinase associated with CFTR is able to phosphorylate the PKA-specific substrate peptide, kemptide. As shown in Fig.2 A, the endogenous kinase precipitated by anti-CFTR-RD phosphorylated kemptide. This phosphorylation was also stimulated by cAMP (Fig. 2 B). The PKA activity associated with the CFTR immunoprecipitate was about 4-fold higher than that of the immunoprecipitate obtained with a control antibody (Fig. 2 A). Second, we tested the effect of PKI on the ability of the endogenous kinase to phosphorylate kemptide. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the phosphorylation of kemptide by the endogenous kinase associated with CFTR was blocked by PKI. PKI-insensitive phosphorylation (∼10% of total phosphorylation) may reflect background activity of contaminating kinases. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the kinase activity associated with CFTR is PKA. To determine whether PKA is physically associated with CFTR, we performed co-immunoprecipitations in which a CFTR-RD antibody was mixed with Calu-3 cell lysates and then precipitated with protein G-agarose beads. After SDS-PAGE and transfer to PVDF membrane, this immunoprecipitate was probed with anti-PKA antibodies. Fig.3 A shows that RIIα of PKA was present in the CFTR immunoprecipitate. In contrast, Calu-3 cell lysates immunoprecipitated with an irrelevant antibody did not yield a positive signal on RII immunoblots (Fig. 3 A). A similar experiment was done to probe for the catalytic subunit of PKA (PKAc) in CFTR immunoprecipitates. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the PKAc subunit was also identified in the CFTR immunoprecipitate. Since both immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed using antibodies raised in mice, the heavy and light chains of the precipitating antibody were also detected. These results demonstrate that protein kinase A type II is physically associated with CFTR. Cell fractionation was employed to investigate the distribution of CFTR, RIIα, and PKAc expression in Calu-3 and T84 epithelia. In these experiments, cells were homogenized and subjected to centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 1 min. The resultant postnuclear supernatant was further separated at 100,000 × g for 60 min. A membrane fraction was prepared by suspending the pellet in lysis buffer, while a cytosolic fraction was made by concentration of the supernatant (See “Experimental Procedures”). As expected, CFTR was identified predominantly in the membrane fraction of Calu-3 and T84 cells (Fig. 4). The CFTR expression level is much higher in Calu-3 cells than that in T84 cells (Fig. 4, compareupper and lower panels), consistent with previous biochemical observations (17.Bradbury N.A. Clark J.A. Watkins S.C. Widnell C.C. Smith H.S.T. Bridges R.J Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L659-L668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RIIα and PKAc were mainly present in the membrane fraction of Calu-3 and T84 cells, although these proteins could be also detected in the cytosolic fraction. These results provide evidence that PKAII co-immunoprecipitates with CFTR and that CFTR is a substrate for this kinase. Since the association of PKAII with subcellular structures is generally mediated by AKAP(s) (20.Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 467-479PubMed Google Scholar), we reasoned that an AKAP might link PKAII to CFTR. To test this hypothesis, we used Ht31, an amphipathic peptide that corresponds to the RII binding motif of a human thyroid AKAP (15.Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D. Bishop S.M. Acott T.S. Brennan R.G. Scott J.D J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14188-14192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to determine whether a similar RII binding motif is responsible for linking PKAII to CFTR. CFTR immunoprecipitation from Calu-3 cell lysates was performed in the presence or absence of Ht31. Fig.5 shows that preincubation of the immunoprecipitate with Ht31 decreased the phosphorylation level of CFTR that was due to endogenous PKA activity. The control peptide, Ht31P, did not alter CFTR phosphorylation. These data suggest that one or more AKAPs mediate the observed association of protein kinase activity with CFTR. Previous studies (14.Dransfield D.T. Bradford A.J. Smith J. Martin M. Roy C. Mangeat P.H. Goldenring J.R EMBO J. 1997; 16: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar,21.Lamprecht G. Weinman E.J. Yun C.-H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29972-29978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) have suggested that ezrin, a cytoskeleton-associated protein with a molecular mass of about 80 kDa, is an RII-binding protein. To determine whether ezrin can function as an AKAP in Calu-3 cells, we performed RIIα overlay assays in which 10 μg of GST-ezrin fusion protein and GST protein alone were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and probed with 32P-labeled RIIα. Fig.6 A shows that RIIα binds GST-ezrin but not GST. This binding could be blocked by the addition of 4 μm Ht31 in the overlay (Fig. 6 A,right panel). To function as an AKAP, ezrin should also interact with RIIα in vivo. To assess this, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using ezrin and RIIα antibodies. In Calu-3 cell lysates, however, we were unable to detect the regulatory subunit of PKA in an ezrin immunoprecipitate (data not shown). This lack of consistency between the RIIα overlay of ezrin and the RIIα co-precipitation with ezrin prompted us to examine other cell fractions. Using the cytosolic fraction, we could detect RIIα in the ezrin immunoprecipit"

L. (1997) Hum. Genet. 99, 550–557). Nm3-H4 was synthesized in escherichia coli as the full-length protein and as a truncated form missing the N-terminal extension characteristic of mitochondrial targeting. The truncated form possesses NDP kinase activity, whereas the full-length protein is inactive, suggesting that the extension prevents enzyme folding and/or activity. X-ray crystallographic analysis was performed on active truncated Nm23-H4. Like other eukaryotic NDP kinases, it is a hexamer. Nm23-H4 naturally possesses a serine residue at position 129, equivalent to the K-pn mutation of theDrosophila NDP kinase. The x-ray structure shows that the presence of Ser129 has local structural effects that weaken subunit interactions. Site-directed mutagenesis shows that the serine is responsible for the lability of Nm23-H4 to heat and urea treatment, because the S129P mutant is greatly stabilized. Examination of human embryonic kidney 293 cells transfected with green fluorescent protein fusions by confocal microscopy shows a specific mitochondrial localization of Nm23-H4 that was also demonstrated by Western blot analysis of subcellular fractions of these cells. Import into mitochondria is accompanied by cleavage of the N-terminal extension that results in NDP kinase activity. Submitochondrial fractionation indicates that Nm23-H4 is associated with mitochondrial membranes, possibly to the contact sites between the outer and inner membranes.

Agarwal R.P. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 8. Academic Press, New York1973: 307-333Google Scholar). The catalytic reaction follows a ping-pong mechanism in which the enzyme is transiently phosphorylated on a histidine residue conserved in all nucleoside diphosphate kinases. NDP kinases are crucial for the homeostasis of cellular nucleoside di- and triphosphate composition and may control many cellular functions. More than 60 NDP kinases primary sequences and a number of x-ray structures from prokaryotes to eukaryotes have been reported. Except in a few bacterial species, NDP kinases are hexamers. All have very similar three-dimensional structures, and their subunits retain a characteristic fold with five helices packed on a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (2.Dumas C. Lascu I. Moréra S.

In humans, six nm23 genes coding for NDP kinases or for homologous isoforms have been identified:nm23-H1 (3.Rosengard A.M. Krutzsch H.C. Shearn A. Biggs J.R. Barker E. Margulies I.M.K. King C.R.

It codes for NDP kinase A, which is 88% identical to NDP kinase B, encoded by nm23-H2. NDP kinase B, also known as PuF (10.Postel E.H. Berberich S.J. Flint S.J. Ferrone C.A. Science. 1993; 261: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), binds to the promoter of the c-myc proto-oncogene and activates its expression in vitro and in vivo (10.Postel E.H.

Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2343-2347PubMed Google Scholar), independently of the NDP kinase activity (12.Postel E.H. Ferrone C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8627-8630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isoforms A and B can form homo- or heterohexamers, resulting in different ratios of the respective subunits (13.Gilles A.M. Presecan E. Vonica A. Lascu I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8784-8789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The product of the third gene, DR-nm23,inhibits granulocyte differentiation and induces apoptosis of 32Dc13 myeloid cells (5.Venturelli D. Martinez R. Melotti P. Casella I. Peschle C. Cucco C. Spampinato G. Darzynkiewicz Z. Calabretta B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7435-7439Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The nm23-H4 gene was identified in our laboratory (6.Milon L. Rousseau-Merck M. Munier A. Erent M. Lascu I. Capeau J. Lacombe M.L. Hum. Genet. 1997; 99: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and the Nm23-H4 protein, the object of the present study, possesses characteristics for mitochondrial targeting. Recently, we also identified another nm23 homologous gene,nm23-H5, specifically expressed in testis germinal cells (7.Munier A. Féral C. Milon L. Phung-Ba V. Gyapay G. Capeau J. Guellaen G. Lacombe M.L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). nm23-H6 is ubiquitously expressed and does not possess a specific signal sequence for organelle import or vesicular trafficking (8.Mehus J.G. Deloukas P. Lambeth D.O. Hum. Genet. 1999; 104: 454-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Regulatory functions have been attributed to these enzymes, in particular in differentiation, normal and tumoral development (reviewed in Ref. 14.De La Rosa A. Williams R. Steeg P.S. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and apoptosis (5.Venturelli D. Martinez R. Melotti P. Casella I. Peschle C. Cucco C. Spampinato G. Darzynkiewicz Z. Calabretta B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7435-7439Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In Drosophila melanogaster, NDP kinase is the product of awd (abnormal wing discs), which is essential for development as mutations lead to larval lethality (15.Dearolf C.R. Hersperger E. Shearn A. Dev. Biol. 1988; 129: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A natural point mutation in awd is called K-pn (Killer of prune). It inducesDrosophila lethality in a dominant manner when associated with a null mutation of the prune gene involved in the fly eye pigment synthesis (16.Biggs J. Tripoulas N. Hersperger E. Dearolf C. Shearn A. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1333-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The K-pn mutation substitutes a serine for a proline in a surface loop, named for this reason the K-pn loop, that makes subunit contacts in the hexamer and plays an important part in the stability of the hexamers (17.Lascu I. Chaffotte A. Limbourg-Bouchon B. Véron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12775-12781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Karlsson A. Mesnildrey S. Xu Y. Moréra S. Janin J. Véron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19928-19934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The proline residue is conserved in most NDP kinases, but it is a serine in Nm23-H4 (6.Milon L. Rousseau-Merck M. Munier A. Erent M. Lascu I. Capeau J. Lacombe M.L. Hum. Genet. 1997; 99: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and in the NDP kinase of pigeon liver mitochondria (19.Lambeth D.O. Mehus J.G. Ivey M.A. Milavetz B.I. J. Biol.

NDP kinases have been found associated to different cellular compartments, such as the cytosol (1.Parks Jr., R.E. Agarwal R.P. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 8. Academic Press, New York1973: 307-333Google Scholar), the nucleus (20.Kraeft S.-K. Traincart F. Mesnildrey S. Bourdais J. Véron M. Chen L.B. Exp.

Most studies have concerned the cytosolic isoforms, products of the nm23-H1 and -H2 genes, and little is known about the mitochondrial enzyme(s). Studies based on measurement of activity point to a mitochondrial NDP kinase preferentially located in the matrix or in the intermembrane space depending on the tissues and the species (24.Jacobus W.E. Evans J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4232-4241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Muhonen W.W. Lambeth D.O. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1995; 110: 211-223Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the intermembrane space, NDP kinase couples ATP formation through the respiratory chain to the synthesis of the other nucleoside triphosphates (26.Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3956-3962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the matrix, NDP kinase plays a role in the availability of nucleotides necessary for the Krebs cycle succinyl thiokinase and the catabolism of short chain fatty acids (27.Krebs H.A. Wiggins D. Biochem. J. 1978; 174: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The presence of NDP kinase would also be required for the synthesis of nucleoside triphosphates as precursors of mitochondrial nucleic acids, of the GTP necessary for the protein synthesis machinery, and of ATP used to fuel Hsp70 and to generate a pulling force for protein import (28.Voisine C. Craig E.A. Zufall N. von Ahsen O. Pfanner N. Voos W. Cell. 1999; 97: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Up to now, three cDNAs encoding mitochondrial NDP kinases have been identified. In the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, a gene encoding a mitochondrial NDP kinase has been described (29.Troll H.

Chem. 1990; 265: 10012-10018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Characteristics of the N-terminal extension prompted the authors to propose localization to the intermembrane space of mitochondria (29.Troll H. Winckler T. Lascu I. Müller N. Saurin W. Véron M. Mutzel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25469-25475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A mitochondrial NDP kinase was reported in pigeon liver, specifically associated to the matrix (19.Lambeth D.O. Mehus J.G. Ivey M.A. Milavetz B.I. J. Biol.

We have reported the identification ofnm23-H4 cDNA encoding a protein homologous to NDP kinases that presents characteristics suggesting targeting to mitochondria (6.Milon L. Rousseau-Merck M.

The present study was aimed at demonstrating the NDP kinase activity of the nm23-H4 gene product and its specific mitochondrial localization and investigating the role of the serine residue at position 129 of Nm23-H4 homologous to the Drosophila K-pn mutation by x-ray analysis and by site-directed mutagenesis. Transformed human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were obtained from the ATCC. Human recombinant A and B NDP kinases were purified as described previously (21.Phung-Ba Pinon V. Millot G. Munier A.

We chose to express the full-length protein (Nm23-H4) and a truncated form (Nm23-H4Δ33) missing the first 33 amino acids that was designed to correspond to the length of the A and B NDP kinases (Ser34 and Tyr35 were changed to Met and Gly, respectively). Primers were designed to introduce NdeI and BamHI sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, of the coding sequence allowing for subcloning of inserts at the corresponding sites into pET-21b and pET-28a(+) expression vectors (both from Novagen) for the expression of Nm23-H4 either native or fused to a hexahistidine tag at its N terminus, respectively. The fragment corresponding to the full-length protein (187 amino acids) was obtained using the two following primers: 5′-GAGCTAGACATATGGGCGGCCTCTTCTGG-3′ and 5′-CATTGGATCCTTCAGGCTGG GTGGATGCT-3′. An insert corresponding to the truncated isoform (Nm23-H4Δ33) was obtained using the 5′ primer 5′-GGGCTATACATATGGGGACCCGGGAGCGGACC-3′. The pEGFP-N1 vector (CLONTECH) was used to express the full-length Nm23-H4 protein fused to the N terminus of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the HEK 293 cell line. Thenm23-H4 cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotide primers that contained BamHI (5′-TTGGATCCCAGGCTGGGTGGATGCTGCTGTGCTG-3′) and EcoRI (5′-ATGAATTC GCGTCATGGGCGGCCTCTTCTGG-3′) sites, and the amplified DNA fragment was cloned into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of the pEGFP-N1 plasmid. The pEGFP-N1 plasmid expressing the native EGFP protein was used as a control. Mutant constructs with a proline residue instead of a serine at position 129 were generated using the TransformerTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH). The mutagenesis was performed on the pET-28a(+) and on the pEGFP-N1 constructs to express the Nm23-H4Δ33S129P and the full-length Nm23-H4S129P/EGFP mutant proteins, respectively. The mutagenic primer designed to produce the desired point mutation was 5′-CAGCCTCAGCCGGGTCGGTGTGTC-3′ (the altered nucleotide is in boldface type). Plasmids were purified using purification kits from Qiagen and were endotoxin-free when used for transfection in mammalian cells. The construct sequences were verified by automatic sequencing in both directions using an Applied Biosystems sequencing apparatus (Genome Express, Grenoble, France). The Nm23-H4 proteins were expressed in either native form (Nm23-H4Δ33) or fused to a hexahistidine tag (full-length and Nm23-H4Δ33). The plasmid constructs were transferred into the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen). A single colony was inoculated into LB culture medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin (pET-21b) or 30 μg/ml kanamycin (pET-28a(+)). The bacteria were grown to an optical density of 0.5 at 600 nm, and protein expression was induced by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation. The full-length and the truncated Nm23-H4 proteins, either tagged or untagged, were expressed as inclusion bodies and as soluble proteins, respectively. The Nm23-H4Δ33 protein (tagged or untagged) was purified under native conditions, whereas only the tagged form of the full-length Nm23-H4 protein was purified under denaturating conditions (8 m urea). For purification of the untagged Nm23-H4Δ33, the bacterial pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.7, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the antiprotease mixture tablet from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (at the concentration indicated by the manufacturer) and was lysed by sonication. After centrifugation to remove the bacterial debris, the supernatant was loaded onto a DEAE-Sephacel column equilibrated with the same buffer. The flow-through, devoid of E. coli NDP kinase, was collected and dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, and loaded onto a hydroxylapatite column. The Nm23-H4Δ33 protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 10–400 mm sodium phosphate. The fractions containing NDP kinase activity were pooled, dialyzed in phosphate-buffered saline, and concentrated using an Amicon cell equipped with a Diaflo YM10 filter. For storage at −20 °C, glycerol was added to a final concentration of 50%. The His-tagged proteins were purified to near homogeneity by chromatography through a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose column following the procedure provided by Qiagen under native (Nm23-H4Δ33) or denaturing (with 8 m urea for Nm23-H4) conditions. The eluted fractions containing the recombinant protein were equilibrated in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8, buffer containing 5 mmdithiothreitol and 5 mm EDTA by chromatography on a PD10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For storage at −20 °C, glycerol was added to a final concentration of 50%. The purity of the recombinant proteins were 90–95% as checked by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining performed according to Laemmli (34.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations were estimated using the following extinction coefficients, calculated from the amino acid composition (35.Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar), at 280 nm for 1 mg/ml solutions: 1.25 for the untagged Nm23-H4Δ33 protein and 1.11 and 1.43 for the tagged Nm23-H4Δ33 and Nm23-H4 proteins, respectively. Unless otherwise specified, the recombinant proteins used in the experiments were the His-tagged proteins. NDP kinase activity was measured using a coupled pyruvate kinase-lactate dehydrogenase assay (36.Agarwal R.P. Robison B. Parks Jr., R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 376-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The assays were performed at 25 °C in a 1-ml reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 75 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.1 mm NADH, 1 mm ATP, 0.2 mm dTDP, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 2 units of pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. To assay the NDP kinase activity of the full-length Nm23-H4 after renaturation, the protein eluted from the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column in urea containing buffer (Qiagen) was incubated overnight at room temperature after a 100-fold dilution in the NDP kinase reaction buffer devoid of pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and dTDP. The reaction was started by the addition of the coupled enzymes and 0.2 mm dTDP. As a control for correct renaturation conditions, the Nm23-H4Δ33 protein previously denatured in 8 m urea was similarly treated. To detect the autophosphorylated intermediate, wild-type and mutant Nm23-H4Δ33 proteins (100 ng) were incubated in the presence of 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 8, containing 1 mm EDTA and 0.5 mmMgCl2. After 5 min at 4 °C, half of the sample volume was removed and added with the gel sample buffer described by Laemmli (34.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). GDP (0.2 mm) was added to the other half and incubated further for 5 min at 4 °C before addition of gel sample buffer. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE without boiling and then transferred to an Immobilon membrane, which was autoradiographed. The thermal stability of the NDP kinases was analyzed by measuring residual NDP kinase activity after 15 min of incubation at the indicated temperatures and cooling at 4 °C. The human NDP kinases were diluted to a final concentration of 4–13 μg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. T m was the temperature corresponding to a 50% loss in activity. To determine the stability upon urea treatment, the enzymes were diluted at the same concentration as above in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8, 10% glycerol and 0.1m NaCl containing the indicated concentrations of urea and were incubated for 16 h at room temperature. Residual activity after both heat and urea treatments was measured by the coupled assay after a 100-fold dilution in the reaction buffer. Urea did not interfere with the assay. The protein sample (tagged Nm23-H4Δ33) was dialyzed against 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 100 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5. Hanging drops were prepared by adding 0.7 mLi2SO4 to this protein solution over pits containing 1.4 m Li2SO4 in the same buffer. The protein concentration in the drops was 4 mg/ml. Crystals grew within one week. They have cubic symmetry with cell parametersa = b = c = 112.96 Å, α = β = γ = 90°. A single crystal of size 200 μm in each direction kept at 4 °C was used in the x-ray data collection at the wavelength of 0.965 Å on the W32 station of the LURE-DCI synchrotron radiation center (Orsay, France) using a MAResearch image plate system. Data were processed and reduced with DENZO and SCALEPACK (37.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38572) Google Scholar).

The solution was compatible with the space group P213, giving two subunits per asymmetric unit. The resulting model was then fitted to the electron density with the TURBO graphics program (64.Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory.

HEK 293 cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biological Industries) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Biological Industries) containing 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The different GFP constructs (80 ng of plasmid DNA) were transiently transfected into the cells cultured in eight-well Lab-TekR plates (2.5.105 cells/well) using the LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. GFP fluorescence could be observed 24–48 h after transfection. Just before examination, mitochondria were stained for 15 min at 37 °C (5% CO2) with 250 nm MitoTracker. Fluorescence in the living cells was examined by confocal microscopy with a TCS SP Leica microscope (Lasertechnik, GmbH) equipped with a × 63 objective (plan apo; numeric aperture = 1.4). A focal series was collected for each specimen with a focus step of 1 μm. For each optical section, double fluorescence was acquired simultaneously using a krypton-argon mixed-gas laser adjusted to 488 nm for EGFP and to 568 nm for MitoTracker. Variable windows of spectrophotometers were adjusted to recover green (500–550 nm) and red (580–630 nm) fluorescence. The signal was treated with line averaging to integrate the signal collected over four lines in order to reduce noise. Selected paired sections were then processed to produce single overlay images (color merged) using a Power Mac G3 equipped with Photoshop software (version 5.0). The polyclonal antibodies against the Nm23-H4 NDP kinase were obtained by immunizing rabbits with the purified tagged Nm23-H4Δ33 recombinant protein. The reactivity and specificity of the antibodies were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting.

The mode of binding for one such toxin-receptor complex was investigated by extensive toxin mutagenesis, followed by real-time receptor binding analysis using an optical biosensor (BIAcore). Wild-type Cry1Ac, a three-domain, lepidopteran-specific toxin, bound purified gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) aminopeptidase N (APN) biphasically. Site 1 displayed fast association and dissociation kinetics, while site 2 possessed slower kinetics, yet tighter affinity. We empirically determined that two Cry1Ac surface regions are involved in in vivo toxicity and APN binding. Mutations within domain III affected binding rates to APN site 1, whereas mutations in domain II affected binding rates to APN site 2. Furthermore, domain III contact is completely inhibited in the presence of N-acetylgalactosamine, indicating loss of domain III binding eliminates all APN binding. Based upon these observations, the following model is proposed. A cavity in lectin-like domain III initiates docking through recognition of anN-acetylgalactosamine moiety on L. dispar APN. Following primary docking, a higher affinity domain II binding mechanism occurs, which is critical for insecticidal activity.

Biol. 1999; 287: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Based on homology modeling studies between Cry1Aa and Cry1Ac, it is proposed GalNAc docks in a surface cavity (46.Jenkins J.L. Lee M.K. Sangadala S. Adang M.J. Dean D.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this cavity is non-conserved in Cry1Aa and Cry1Ab, and the binding of these toxins to APN is not inhibited by preincubation with sugars (4.Masson L. Lu Y. Mazza A. Brousseau R. Adang M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20309-20315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 6.Luo K. Sangadala S. Masson L. Mazza A. Brousseau R. Adang M.J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To the contrary, Cry1Ac binding to L. dispar APN-1 is almost completely inhibited by preincubation with GalNAc (5.Valaitis A.P. Mazza A. Brousseau R. Masson L. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 529-539Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar), indicating carbohydrate recognition is essential for this toxin-receptor interaction. This suggests Cry1Ac domain III has a sugar-dependent mechanism of binding (47.Knowles B.H. Knight P.J. Ellar D.J. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1991; 245: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) unique to Cry1A toxins. In fact, Cry1Ac domain III sequence is notably divergent from all other Cry toxins (48.Thompson M.A. Schnepf H.E. Feitelson J.S. Genetic Engineering, Principles and Methods. 17. Broohaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY1995: 99-117Google Scholar, 49.Bravo A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2793-2801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The requirement of sugar recognition for binding, however, is common among many intestinal pathogens (50.St. Hilaire P.M. Boyd M.K. Toone E.J.

APN-binding epitopes were localized to specific residues in domain II and III. Our results suggest that Cry1Ac bindsL. dispar APN in sequential steps, first by domain III, then domain II. Here we present an empirical determination of both contact sites and a model for sequential receptor-binding steps by Cry1Ac insecticidal δ-endotoxin.DISCUSSIONToxicity and receptor binding studies with our Cry1Ac mutants provided evidence of functional epitopes on Cry1Ac domains II and III. Each domain contributed its own set of rate constants during binding. Biosensor analysis of domain II and III mutant toxins indicated domain III binds and releases quickly (k a1 andk d1), while domain II binds slower and tighter (k a2 and k d2). Loss of domain III binding by mutagenesis or domain-exchanges eliminates APN binding, demonstrating the dependence of secondary domain II binding on initial domain III binding. Domain III binding is specifically inhibited by GalNAc. Given these results and the 1:1 binding stoichiometry of Cry1Ac to APN, we propose a two-step, or sequential binding, model rather than a two-site model. In this model, APN recognition is determined by Cry1Ac domain III binding through a GalNAc moiety, followed by contact of domain II loop residues (Fig.10).Previously, we have observed that, under our experimental conditions, the effects of mass transport and analyte rebinding do not contribute to Cry1Ac's deviation from simple bimolecular binding.2 We note that there are some possible alternative explanations of our findings. First, a heterogeneous surface of APN molecules may result from amine coupling. However, it is unlikely that our two sets of rate constants are induced by constrained receptor positions since mutations in separate domains of Cry1Ac affect both toxicity and APN binding. Two separate structural and functional regions make monophasic binding improbable, and thus, amine coupling is an unlikely source of heterogeneity. Second, the two Cry1Ac domains could bind independently to APN. Such bivalency is also seen in antibody-antigen interactions, but separate antibody fragments are monovalent (12.Muller K.M. Arndt K.M. Pluckthun A. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 261: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Cry1Ac is different from an antibody since the second binding site depends on the first one. In addition, the bivalent analyte model did not fit our biosensor curves as well as the sequential binding model (data not shown). A third alternative is that APN receptors dimerize on the biosensor surface in a sequential fashion, like the human growth hormone interaction with its receptor hGHbp (67.Cunningham B.C. Ultsch M. de Vos A.M. Mulkerrrin M.G. Clauser K.R. Wells J.A. Science. 1991; 254: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). This could occur by domain III binding to one APN and domain II binding to a second APN. Curve fittings with a receptor dimerization model (see “Materials and Methods”) did not fit better than the sequential binding model (data not shown), and our predicted 1:1 stoichiometry does not suggest dimerization occurs. Additionally, our apparent kinetic rate constants do not vary with different densities of receptor immobilized, indicating ligand interactions do not affect complex formation.2 One final possibility is that a conformational change actually occurs upon APN binding. It has been suggested that Cry1Ac does undergo a conformational change upon binding to M. sexta APN in a lipid monolayer (7.Cooper M.A. Carroll J. Travis E.R. Williams D.H. Ellar D.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This would initiate membrane insertion of domain I α-helices involved in pore formation. It remains to be determined if binding to a functional toxin receptor, alone, can trigger this event.Pathogenic bacterial toxins that target cell membranes appear to possess a similar functional construction. It has been observed in well characterized toxins, such as cholera and shigella, that a “B” domain functions in binding to cell surface receptors, while an “A,” or activity, domain exerts the toxin's specific biological activity (68.Middlebrook J.L. Kohn L.D. Receptor-mediated Binding and Internalization of Toxins and Hormones. Academic Press, Inc., New York1981: 95Crossref Google Scholar, 52.Herrmann M.S. Behnke W.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 621: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A and B domains may be synthesized together or separately. It is further postulated that regions of hydrophobicity on one of the domains or on a separate domain called “E” (entry domain), plays a role in facilitating insertion of the toxin after receptor binding (68.Middlebrook J.L. Kohn L.D. Receptor-mediated Binding and Internalization of Toxins and Hormones. Academic Press, Inc., New York1981: 95Crossref Google Scholar). The ABE model of toxin structure may be analogous to the domains of Cry1Ac. Our data suggest that L. dispar APN specificity is determined by sugar binding of domain III. Mutations around the domain III cavity affect initial binding rates. This lectin-like, jellyroll structure acts like a B domain. Domain II mutations affect rate constants of the subsequent step. It is tempting to speculate secondary domain II binding is critical for facilitating entry into the membrane, acting as an E domain. It is not known if this would involve binding to a second receptor site or initiating a conformational change. However, the loss of exposed, hydrophobic Phe440 caused the most dramatic effects onk d2, fitting with its potential role as an E domain. Interestingly, changing charged arginine residues to alanine resulted in slower on-rates during the second step. Positively charged arginines might serve to orient hydrophobic loops to an APN binding site or toward the membrane surface. Finally, the ability of domain I α-helices to form membrane pores suggests it may be an A domain.A comparison of mutant toxicity and APN binding affinity in this study yields a strikingly contradictory result. Complete loss of APN binding caused by domain III mutation W545A only results in 50-fold decreased activity. Cry1Ac appears to retain slight toxicity to L. dispar without APN or GalNAc binding capability. On the other hand, domain II loop 3 mutations cause greater decreases in toxicity (>600-fold) than can be accounted for by loss of APN binding. One explanation for this contradiction is that during toxicity bioassays (5-day time period), the domain III mutations that weakened APN recognition in SPR studies (4-min association time) are less critical than domain II mutations, which affect adherence to APN. If insertion into the membrane depends on step 2 adherence to the APN, domain II mutations may affect toxicity more than domain III mutations over time. A second possibility is that other receptors in vivo may compensate for loss of domain III binding. Like APN, these receptor sites may be affected by domain II mutations, resulting in greater toxicity losses for mutations such as F440A in domain II than for W545A in domain III. The possibility of other Cry1Ac receptors agrees with a previous study that showed APN competes for Cry1Ac binding to L. dispar BBMV, but does not eliminate all binding (69.Lee M.K. You T.H. Young B.A. Cotrill J.A. Valaitis A.P. Dean D.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 2845-2849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, Cry1Ac inhibition of short circuit current in L. dispar midgut was reduced by APN cleavage, but some inhibition still remained (69.Lee M.K. You T.H. Young B.A. Cotrill J.A. Valaitis A.P. Dean D.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 2845-2849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting other receptors were involved. In another insect, M. sexta, Carroll et al. (70.Carroll J. Wolfersberger M.G. Ellar D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3099-3104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found evidence that a GalNAc-independent mechanism of Cry1Ac BBMV permeabilizing activity occurs. Complete loss of APN binding in this insect caused only slightly decreased Cry1Ac toxicity (45.Burton S.L. Ellar D.J. Li J. Derbyshire D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 46.Jenkins J.L. Lee M.K. Sangadala S. Adang M.J. Dean D.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 62.Lee M.K. You T.H. Gould F.L. Dean D.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 4513-4520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another Cry1A-binding receptor, a cadherin-like glycoprotein called BT-R1, has previously been identified in M. sexta (71.Vadlamudi R.K. Ji T.H. Bulla Jr., L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12334-12340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which may compensate for loss of APN binding (46.Jenkins J.L. Lee M.K. Sangadala S. Adang M.J. Dean D.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Such a receptor in L. dispar could contribute to the residual toxicity of our domain III mutants that lost APN binding. For example, a glycosylated Cry1Aa/b toxin receptor was recently identified in L. dispar, with relatively low affinity for Cry1Ac (72.Valaitis, A. P., Lee, M. K., and Dean, D. H. (1999) in Society for Invertebrate Pathology XXXII Meeting Program & Abstracts, Irvine, August 23–27, 1999, p. 76Google Scholar). Taken together, these results implicate APN is a major receptor for Cry1Ac in L. dispar, but not necessarily the only receptor. A final possibility for the toxicity contradiction is that a domain II mechanism is critical for all binding events at the brush border membrane. It is conceivable domain II is involved in insertion or initiates a conformational change necessary for insertion. This is consistent with the idea of domain II as an E domain, facilitating entry. Liang et al. (34.Liang Y. Patel S. Dean D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24719-24724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) observed that irreversible binding of Cry1A toxins to L. dispar BBMVs was more directly related to toxicity than initial binding. Domain II has previously been implicated in both initial and irreversible binding of Cry1A toxins (35.Rajamohan F. Alcantara E. Lee M.K. Chen X.J. Curtiss A. Dean D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2276-2282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Rajamohan F. Cotrill J.A. Gould F. Dean D.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25220-25226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For this reason, mutating amino acids in domain II is potentially more detrimental than altering receptor-specifying residues in domain III.Understanding the division of Cry1Ac domain III as a receptor-recognition domain and the role of domain II in facilitating binding and toxicity helps direct continuing efforts in engineering insect specificity or improved toxicity of Bt toxins. Bacillus thuringiensis(Bt)1 insecticidal crystal proteins (or Cry toxins) have been used worldwide in a number of transgenic crops and in sprays as a safer alternative to chemical pesticides (1.Dean D.H. Adang M.J. Plant Protein Engineering. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1992Google Scholar). Upon ingestion by a feeding insect, the crystal proteins are solubilized in the midgut and activated by midgut proteases (2.Aronson A.I. Beckman W. Dunn P. Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 50: 1-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activated toxins then target molecules lining the epithelial cell membrane and disrupt membrane ionic potential (3.Harvey W.R. Wolfersberger M.G. J. Exp. Biol. 1979; 83: 293-304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by forming pores. Understanding the mechanism of binding of Cry toxins to the midgut receptors is important for engineering Bt toxins with higher toxicity and insect specificity. The binding kinetics of several Bt toxins with midgut receptors has been observed using optical biosensors (4.Masson L. Lu Y. Mazza A. Brousseau R. Adang M.J. J. Biol.

Biosensors, such as the BIAcore (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden), measure the affinity of a flowing molecule for another molecule immobilized on a surface as they form a real-time complex. As the molecule in solution is adsorbed by ligand, changes in mass on the surface are monitored using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (9.Malmqvist M.

SPR studies conducted using Cry1A toxins specific for lepidopteran receptors have reported that Cry1Ac binds to two sites on purified Manduca sexta aminopeptidase N (APN) (4.Masson L. Lu Y. Mazza A.

In one of the earliest studies designed to identify cellular receptors for LPA, the extension of a receptor affinity-labeling method to serum proteins in one experiment detected interactions of LPA with proteins of 15, 28, and 80 or more kDa as well as serum albumin (7.van der Bend R.L.

However, these proteins were not resolved or characterized further, and no studies ever were conducted of equilibrium binding of LPA to serum albumin or any other protein. Extensive investigations have determined the fatty acid and phospholipid binding properties of serum albumin, which include equilibrium dissociation constants as low as 10 nm for some fatty acids and as high as 300 to 1,000 nm for larger and more polar fatty acids with limited access to the high affinity pockets (8.Spector A.A.

However, these studies using classical techniques did not include analyses of binding of LPA to serum albumin, in part due to the high levels of unspecific binding attributable to the amphipathic nature of LPA. It was discovered recently that one or more proteins secreted into serum-free medium of cultured rat cardiac myocytes (RCMs) delivered LPA, but not S1P, to RCMs and some other cells more effectively than fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (faf-BSA) (11.Goetzl, E.

LPA regulates the actin-binding and -severing activities of gelsolin, an approximately 85-kDa cytosolic constituent of myocytes and a myocyte-derived plasma protein, by mechanisms similar to those ofl-α-phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), which binds to two distinct sites of gelsolin (12.Meerschaert K.

This raised the possibility that gelsolin, which normally is present in plasma and extracellular fluids at a concentration of 100 to 250 μg/ml, may be one of the RCM-derived proteins capable of binding LPA and then either sequestering it or delivering it to cellular receptors.

At nanomolar concentrations of ligands, Edg-2, -4, and -7 receptors are specific for LPA and Edg-1, -3, and -5 receptors for S1P. This study was designed to quantify equilibrium binding of LPA to gelsolin and faf-BSA, characterize the gelsolin binding sites for LPA in relation to those for PIP2, and investigate the capacity of gelsolin to deliver LPA to RCMs and elicit RCM nuclear, biochemical, and functional responses.

Mouse monoclonal antibodies against substituent peptides of human Edg-3 (amino acids 1–21), Edg-4 (amino acids 9–27), and Edg-5 (amino acids 303–322) with high interspecies homology were purified and used for Western blots at 0.1–0.3 μg/ml (26.Goetzl E.J.

A rabbit polyclonal antiserum to rodent and human Edg-2 was kindly provided by Dr. Jerold Chun (University of California San Diego). The cross-reactivity of each antibody with heterologous Edg proteins was less than 1%. Mouse monoclonal anti-human gelsolin antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Rat cardiac myocytes (RCMs) of 90% purity with up to 10% fibroblasts from 1-day-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rat pups were cultured in Dulbecco's modified minimal Eagle's medium with penicillin and streptomycin (DMEM+) and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2 (29.Li H.T.

Res. 1982; 52: 101-116Crossref Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Replicate layers of RCM were preincubated with pertussis toxin for 6 h and C3 exoenzyme for 30 h. RCMs were serum-deprived 24 h before each study in DMEM+ or DMEM+ containing 1–100 μg/ml faf-BSA or 0.1–100 μg/ml of gelsolin, and the medium was replaced just before RCM stimulation at the beginning of a study. To quantify incorporation of [3H]leucine into proteins by RCM, replicate monolayers of 3–4 × 103 RCM were serum-deprived and cultured in 12-well plates for 72 h with removal of medium and readdition of antagonists and stimuli in fresh medium every 24 h. In these and all other studies, LPA was added in an aliquot of 100 μg/ml faf-BSA equal to 1/50 the volume of medium in each well. This prevents LPA binding to non-cellular surfaces even at aqueous concentrations far below the critical micellar level of approximately 1 mm (5.Thumser A.E.A. Voysey J.E. Wilton D.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). One μCi of [3H]leucine was added to wells, and incubation was continued for 12 h. RCM then were washed twice with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 0.5 ml/well of trichloroacetic acid at 5 g/100 ml of distilled water, held at room temperature for 15 min, and solubilized by incubation at 37 °C for 2 h in 0.2 ml of 5 g % sodium dodecyl sulfate for determination of radioactivity. Replicate suspensions of 1 × 107 RCMs, fibroblasts from preparations of RCMs, and HTC4 cell transfectants were washed three times with 10 ml of ice-cold Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 0.3 ml of cold 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 0.12 msucrose, and 5% glycerol (v:v), and proteins were extracted (27.Goetzl E.J. Kong Y. Mei B. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2049-2056PubMed Google Scholar). In initial analytical gels, aliquots of supernatant containing 1–100 μg of protein were electrophoresed, transferred, and immunostained (27.Goetzl E.J. Kong Y. Mei B. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2049-2056PubMed Google Scholar). Two polished lucite 8-cm diameter × 12-mm thickness disks with eight 10-mm diameter half-wells in each held a 10-kDa pore cut-off middle layer of acetylated dialysis membrane between the half-wells of each chamber. One half-well received 200 μl of either 5 μm faf-BSA or 2 μm gelsolin in phosphate-buffered saline with Ca2+ and Mg2+, and the other received 200 μl of [3H]LPA (150,000 dpm or 800,000 dpm in competition studies) in Ca2+- and Mg2+-containing phosphate-buffered saline with 20 μg/ml (0.3 μm) faf-BSA. Non-radioactive LPA at 0.1 nm–1 μm or a range of concentrations of binding inhibitors were added at equal concentrations to both half-wells of some sets. After 48 h of incubation with rolling at 4 °C, replicate aliquots of 50 μl were counted to determine the difference between dpm in a protein-containing half-well and in the non-protein half-well of each compartment. After normalization for recovery, which ranged from 49% to 70%, each difference was expressed as a percentage of dpm in the reference set lacking any inhibitor (100%). Plots of % of control binding versus LPA concentration were used to derive K d values by the MacLigand program of Dr. Robert E. Williams (UCLA) and for corroboration by the LIGAND program of Biosoft (Cambridge, MA). Plots of % of control binding versus inhibitor concentration permitted calculation of IC50 values. Binding data were analyzed for statistical significance by one-way analysis of variance and Fisher's protected least significant difference (StatView, Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA). Replicate monolayers of 0.3–1 × 105 RCMs in 12-well plates of DMEM+ were lipotransfected with 100 ng/well of an SRE firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (16.An S. Dickens M.A. Bleu T. Hallmark O.G. Goetzl E.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and 5 ng/well of pRL-CMVRenilla luciferase vector (Promega) using FuGENE 6. After 24 to 30 h, the RCM were washed and covered with 1 ml of DMEM+ before stimulation by LPA or a combination of monoclonal anti-Edg-4 antibody and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Each firefly luciferase luminometric value was corrected for process differences by division with the Renilla luciferase luminometric signal from the same well (31.An S. Bleu T. Zheng Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Direct nuclear signaling by LPA recruits the transcription proteins serum response factor and ternary complex factor to form a ternary complex with the SRE in promoters of numerous immediate-early growth-related genes. RCM transfected with an SRE luciferase reporter, permitting quantification of direct nuclear signaling, responded modestly only to 10−6m LPA in protein-free medium, only to 10−6m LPA in 1 and 10 μg/ml faf-BSA, and to 10−7m and 10−6m LPA in 100 μg/ml faf-BSA (Fig.1). In contrast, delivery of LPA to RCM by 1, 3, and 10 μg/ml gelsolin resulted in significant responses at 10−9–10−6m LPA, with maximal mean increases in signal of 3- to 4-fold. The effectiveness of purified gelsolin was steeply dependent on concentration, with no responses at 0.3 μg/ml, maximum signals at 1–10 μg/ml, and lower than maximum responses at 30 μg/ml (Fig. 1). In two studies that included 100 μg/ml purified gelsolin, SRE luciferase signals were not significantly higher or lower than medium control values at 10−8–10−6m LPA. In limited studies, 10−8m and 10−7m LPA delivered by 3 μg/ml human recombinant gelsolin elicited respective mean increases (±S.D.) in SRE luciferase signals to 312 ± 48% and 274 ± 60% of control (bothp < 0.01). The presentation of LPA to RCMs by gelsolin thus attained a peak at concentrations lower than 10% that in plasma and decreased at levels 20% or more of that in plasma. In contrast, gelsolin did not enhance S1P-evoked SRE luciferase responses in parallel experiments (data not shown). Furthermore, neither purified or recombinant gelsolin nor faf-BSA alone evoked SRE luciferase responses (Fig. 1). As RCM do not proliferate in culture, when assessed by increases in cell counts, the functional consequences of their activation by LPA were investigated by measuring enhancement of protein synthesis characteristic of myocyte hypertrophy, as quantified by uptake of [3H]leucine into trichloroacetic acid-precipitated cellular proteins. The level of protein synthesis by RCM was increased by LPA delivered by purified plasma gelsolin (Fig.2). The increases in incorporation of [3H]leucine were significant at 10−8–10−6m LPA with 3 μg/ml and 10 μg/ml gelsolin and attained a peak at 10−7m and 10−6m with 3 μg/ml and 10−8m and 10−7mwith 10 μg/ml gelsolin. In limited studies, 10−8m and 10−7m LPA delivered by 3 μg/ml human recombinant gelsolin elicited respective mean increases (±S.D.) in incorporation of [3H]leucine to 194 ± 44% and 236 ± 18% (p < 0.05 and <0.01, respectively) of control. There was a marginally significant increase in RCM protein synthesis with 10−6m LPA delivered by 100 μg/ml faf-BSA. In contrast, LPA delivered by 1 μg/ml gelsolin or by 1 μg/ml or 10 μg/ml faf-BSA had no effect on RCM protein synthesis (Fig. 2). The maximal responses to gelsolin-LPA far exceeded in magnitude those evoked by faf-BSA-LPA. Neither gelsolin nor faf-BSA alone altered RCM protein synthesis. The identity of gelsolin as the protein delivering LPA to RCM was confirmed by the suppression of SRE luciferase responses with a neutralizing mouse monoclonal antibody to human gelsolin. RCM SRE luciferase responses similar in magnitude to those described in Fig. 1were again evoked when LPA was delivered by gelsolin or faf-BSA (Fig.3). In contrast, neither gelsolin alone or gelsolin with the monoclonal anti-gelsolin antibody increased SRE luciferase reports. The responses elicited by gelsolin-LPA, but not faf-BSA-LPA, were suppressed significantly by means of more than 70% with mouse anti-gelsolin antibody (Fig. 3). Monoclonal antibodies to the EdgRs that bind and transduce signals from LPA recently were shown to elicit growth-related responses of some cells when introduced with PMA (32.Goetzl E.J. Dolezalova H. Kong Y. Hu Y.-L. Jaffe R.B. Kalli K.R. Conover C.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3051-3056Google Scholar). Thus the EdgRs of RCM were analyzed immunochemically first and then for their capacity to transduce antibody-induced signals to determine if gelsolin influenced any receptor or post-receptor elements of RCM responses in addition to LPA delivery. RCM expression of Edg-2 and -4 receptors for LPA and Edg-3 and -5 receptors for S1P was examined in Western blots developed with the monoclonal antibodies to human and rodent Edg-3, -4, and -5 receptors and rabbit IgG polyclonal antibodies to human and rodent Edg-2Rs with stimulatory potential (Fig.4). One predominant protein antigen was observed with each anti-EdgR antibody in extracts of RCM that was the same size as the protein detected by that antibody in extracts of HTC4 rat hepatoma cell transfectants bearing the corresponding recombinant EdgR (21.An S. Bleu T. Zheng Y. Goetzl E.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 881-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 31.An S. Bleu T. Zheng Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The apparent quantity of each EdgR antigen extracted from purified cardiac fibroblasts, which represent up to 10% of the cells in RCM preparations, was lower than that in RCMs despite the application of 2.5 times more protein from the fibroblasts (Fig. 4). RCMs thus appear to be the principal cells in fresh preparations that express EdgRs and can respond by EdgR-dependent mechanisms both to LPA and anti-EdgR antibodies combined with PMA. Two toxins active against transductional components required for EdgR signaling were employed to determine if RCM EdgRs signal by the expected mechanisms. Both pertussis toxin and C3 exoenzyme separately significantly suppressed the increases in SRE luciferase activity induced by LPA delivered to RCM by either 100 μg/ml faf-BSA or 3 μg/ml gelsolin (Table I). Application of pertussis toxin and C3 exoenzyme together inhibited SRE luciferase reporter responses to 10−7m LPA with 3 μg/ml gelsolin by a mean of 83% (n = 2).Table IInhibition by selective toxins of SRE-luciferase responses to LPAfaf-BSAPurified gelsolin10−7mLPA + pertussis toxin62 ± 361 ± 810−7m LPA + C3 exoenzyme70 ± 1158 ± 7Protein concentrations were 100 μg/ml faf-BSA and 3 μg/ml gelsolin.

As Edg-4R was one of the most prominent LPA receptors of RCMs and monoclonal anti-Edg-4R antibody with PMA has evoked SRE luciferase responses in other cells (32.Goetzl E.J. Dolezalova H. Kong Y. Hu Y.-L. Jaffe R.B. Kalli K.R. Conover C.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3051-3056Google Scholar), concentrations of anti-Edg-4R antibody and PMA, which alone did not elicit signals, were applied to RCM in several combinations (Table II). These combinations of monoclonal anti-Edg-4R antibody and PMA evoked mean SRE luciferase responses of RCM from 194% to 235%, which were similar in magnitude to those induced by LPA with gelsolin. However, gelsolin did not significantly modify the signals attained by anti-Edg-4R antibody-based stimulation (Table II). Thus gelsolin does not appear to have major effects on post-EdgR cellular elements of signaling of RCMs.Table IILack of effect of gelsolin on anti-Edg-4 receptor monoclonal antibody stimulation of nuclear responses in rat cardiac myocytes[Anti-Edg-4 MoAb][PMA]Purified gelsolin (μg/ml)310μg/mlng/ml% gelsolin-free control response0.10.3125 ± 24108 ± 50.11.0106 ± 16105 ± 281.00.3101 ± 3106 ± 181.01.0113 ± 20101 ± 6Each value is the mean ± S.D. of three separate studies.

The same concentrations of a similar anti-Edg-3 monoclonal antibody plus PMA did not stimulate SRE luciferase responses despite expression of Edg-3Rs (Fig. 4). Open table in a new tab Each value is the mean ± S.D. of three separate studies. In the absence of gelsolin, anti-Edg-4 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) plus PMA at respective concentrations of 0.1/0.3, 0.1/1.0, 1.0/0.3, and 1.0 μg/ml/1.0 ng/ml increased SRE-luciferase responses significantly to corresponding levels of 194 + 45%, 235 + 55%, 216 + 63%, and 228 + 56% (mean ± S.D.) of medium controls, which were set at 100% for quantification of the effects of gelsolin. The same concentrations of a similar anti-Edg-3 monoclonal antibody plus PMA did not stimulate SRE luciferase responses despite expression of Edg-3Rs (Fig. 4). The capacity of concentrations of gelsolin lower than 10% that of normal plasma to deliver LPA to RCMs with optimal efficiency suggested high affinity binding of LPA to gelsolin. The results of analyses of equilibrium binding of [3H]LPA to gelsolin and faf-BSA showed greater displacement from the former by all concentrations of non-radioactive LPA but especially large differences between gelsolin and faf-BSA at 3 × 10−8m to 3 × 10−7m (Fig. 5). Both recombinant and purified human gelsolin demonstrated similarly greater displacement of [3H]LPA at low LPA concentrations. Purified and recombinant gelsolin had respective meanK d values ± S.E. (n = 3) of 6.2 ± 2.5 nm and 32 ± 7.8 nm, as contrasted with 357 ± 64 nm for faf-BSA. Assessment of valences of the binding proteins indicated a range of 1.2 to 1.8 for gelsolin and 3.2 to 5.6 for faf-BSA. S1P and lysophosphatidylcholine at 10−6m both failed to displace [3H]LPA from gelsolin. A relationship between gelsolin binding of LPA and of PIP2 was examined by PIP2 competitive inhibition of both gelsolin binding of [3H]LPA and cellular presentation of LPA by gelsolin. A 300-fold molar excess of PIP2 inhibited LPA binding to gelsolin by a mean of 31% (Fig. 6 A), and a 100-fold molar excess of PIP2 inhibited LPA presentation to RCM by a mean of 56% for nuclear signaling (Fig. 6 B) and 38% for protein synthesis (Fig. 6 C). In contrast, there was no significant inhibition of LPA binding to faf-BSA or of faf-BSA enhancement of LPA effects on cardiomyocytes by PIP2 (data not shown). Substituent peptides of gelsolin (gel P1 and gel P2), each of which represents one of the two PIP2-binding sites of intact gelsolin and of another actin-binding protein termed villin (villin P), were used as gelsolin competitive inhibitors at concentrations 3–300-fold higher than 0.03–0.3 μm intact gelsolin (13.Yu F.-X. Sun H.-Q. Janmey P.A. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14616-14621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Sun H.Q. Yamamoto M. Mejillano M. Yin H.L. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1759-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Gel P1 and gel P2 significantly suppressed binding of [3H]LPA to 0.3 μm intact gelsolin at 3-fold and 30-fold higher molar concentrations (Fig. 6 A). Gel P1 and gel P2 significantly suppressed signaling of SRE luciferase by LPA-0.03 μmgelsolin at 30-fold and 300-fold higher molar concentrations (Fig.6 B). The two gelsolin peptide sites of PIP2 binding also significantly inhibited induction of RCM protein synthesis by LPA with 0.03 μm gelsolin at a 300-fold higher molar concentration (Fig. 6 C). In contrast, a control nonsense sequence gelsolin peptide 2 had no effect on intact gelsolin binding or delivery of LPA (Fig. 6). Villin P, which is structurally homologous to gelsolin PIP2 binding peptides, also inhibited gelsolin binding and cellular presentation of LPA at similar molar concentration ratios with intact gelsolin. None of the gelsolin inhibitory peptides significantly altered faf-BSA binding or delivery of LPA. The expression of one or more EdgRs by all but a few types of mammalian cells has suggested that the activities of LPA and S1P are regulated principally by alterations in their effective local concentrations. The relative roles of production, non-receptor protein binding, and biodegradation in the determination of concentrations of LPA at cell-surface EdgRs have not been elucidated in physiological settings. The amount of LPA generated is a function of membrane perturbation of cellular sources and recruitment of a sequence of phospholipases, which are induced by diverse stimuli (1.Spiegel S. Milstein S. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 146: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 2.Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. Postma F.R. Zondag G. Curr. Opin.

Many lysophospholipases with different cellular localization, substrate specificity, and susceptibility to stimulation and inhibition may degrade or otherwise inactivate LPA (33.Wang A. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12723-12730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, LPA is produced and biodegraded at sites of tissue reactions in the course of many physiological responses and pathological processes. Less is known of the mechanisms for stabilization of LPA in tissues and specific cellular delivery of LPA. Plasma gelsolin, which is derived principally from myocytes (14.Sun H.Q. Yamamoto M. Mejillano M. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33179-33182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 34.Kwiatkowski D.J. Mehl R. Izumo S. Nadal-Ginard B. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8239-8243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), binds LPA with an affinity similar to that of EdgRs and, exceeding, that of serum albumin or other known plasma proteins (Fig. 5). The identity of gelsolin as the LPA-binding protein of purified plasma preparations was verified by the similar activity of recombinant gelsolin (Fig. 5) and the neutralizing effect of monoclonal anti-gelsolin antibody (Fig. 3). This implies that LPA derived from any primary cellular source first will bind with low affinity to the much greater density of serum albumin sites and then may be captured effectively by high affinity binding to gelsolin. The present data suggest that gelsolin could serve two functions in regulating expression of LPA activity. Gelsolin concentrations in plasma normally are 150 to 250 μg/ml and rarely decrease to lower than 60 μg/ml even in cases of extensive trauma, where there is extreme dilution and actin-trapping (35.Grinnell F. Baxter C.R. Zhu M. Yin H.L. Wound Repair Regen. 1993; 1: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 36.Suhler E. Lin W. Yin H.L. Lee W.M. Crit.

Care Med. 1999; 160: 1673-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). At such high plasma concentrations, therefore, the first function of gelsolin may be as a high affinity plasma carrier, which protects a portion of circulating LPA from biodegradation, prevents LPA from binding to numerous possible low affinity proteins, and suppresses LPA activation of endothelial cells, platelets, and circulating leukocytes (Figs. 1 and 2). At the lower concentrations of gelsolin observed in fluids of injured or inflamed tissues, which range from 1% to 10% of that in plasma, 2M. May, C. Lilly, K. Haley, M. Sunday, C. Sheils, P. Allen, T. P. Stossel, and J. M. Drazen, personal communication. its second function may be delivery of LPA to myocytes and some other types of cells with a greater effectiveness than that characteristic of serum albumin (Figs. 1 and2). Confirming investigations by Stossel and co-workers2have characterized delivery of LPA to Swiss 3T3 cells by recombinant human gelsolin added to plasma from mice genetically totally deficient in gelsolin. LPA stimulation of the formation of actin stress fibers in 3T3 cells was enhanced maximally by gelsolin at approximately 1% normal plasma levels and was suppressed by normal plasma concentrations. The delivery of LPA to specific EdgRs by low concentrations of gelsolin may be driven by gradients of gelsolin concentration, which would be higher at the surface of cells producing gelsolin, as well as gradients of LPA affinity. That delivery of LPA to cellular receptors is the principal function of gelsolin in this context was shown by its lack of effect on immunospecific stimulation. RCMs express functional EdgRs for both LPA and S1P (Fig. 4; Table I). The nuclear signaling to SRE by a combination of phorbol ester and monoclonal anti-Edg-4 antibody at separately inactive concentrations was unaffected by gelsolin, which is consistent with the absence of any direct receptor or post-receptor effect of gelsolin (Table II). Maximum stimulation of nuclear responses and enhancement of protein synthesis in RCM were attained when LPA was delivered by gelsolin at concentrations of 10% or lower than that in normal plasma (Figs. 1 and2). Leakage of cytoplasmic gelsolin from ischemic or otherwise injured RCM and exudation of plasma gelsolin from permeabilized vasculature into inflamed myocardium at low concentrations thus initially would enhance locally the capacity of LPA to suppress cardiomyocyte apoptosis (40.Umansky S.R. Shapiro J.P. Cuenco G.M. Foehr W.M. Bathurst I.C. Tomei L.D. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 608-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and to evoke restorative events. Under different myocardial conditions, low levels of gelsolin may enhance LPA induction of greater contractility and/or promote LPA stimulation of myocardial hypertrophy. Of note, the fold increase in protein synthesis evoked by 100 nm LPA with 3 μg/ml gelsolin is greater than that induced by 1 μm norepinephrine or 1% fetal calf serum in other studies (29.Li H.T. Long C.S. Rokosh D.G. Honbo N.Y. Karliner J.S. Circulation. 1995; 92: 918-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, at gelsolin concentrations above 20% those in normal plasma, later in the evolution of tissue responses plasma gelsolin may trap LPA, prevent effective delivery to EdgRs, and thereby diminish many of the biological effects of LPA. Thus gelsolin has the capacity to enhance and suppress the effects of LPA on myocytes and possibly other types of cells. Molar excesses of PIP2 and substituent peptides of gelsolin constituting the PIP2-binding sites blocked LPA binding to gelsolin by 50% or more and inhibited LPA stimulation of both nuclear responses and protein synthesis (Fig. 6). This is consistent with a previous report of LPA regulation of the actin- binding, and -cleaving activity of gelsolin, which was similar to the effect of PIP2 and presumed to be attributable to LPA interactions with PIP2 sites (12.Meerschaert K. DeCorte V. DeVille Y. Vanderkerckhove K. Gettemans J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5923-5932Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Gelsolin did not bind S1P nor deliver S1P to RCMs. Other plasma and non-receptor cellular proteins may bind S1P with effects similar to those of gelsolin for LPA but have not yet been identified. The mechanisms by which gelsolin delivers LPA to cells effectively remain to be elucidated but may include a gelsolin-selective docking site as well as bivalent and, thus, higher net affinity presentation. Also remaining for future studies are questions of any protective or carrier functions of gelsolin for LPA and any ability of gelsolin to facilitate transport of LPA into cells or across tissue boundaries.

Using truncated recombinant HBHA forms and hybrid proteins containing HBHA repeats grafted onto theEscherichia coli maltose-binding protein (MBP), we found that these repeats are responsible for heparin binding. Immunofluorescence microscopy studies revealed that their deletion abrogates binding of HBHA to human pneumocytes. Conversely, when fused to MBP, the HBHA repeats confer pneumocyte adherence properties to the hybrid protein. Treatment of pneumocytes with glycosaminoglycan-degrading enzymes showed that HBHA binding depends on the presence of heparan sulfate chains on the cell surface. The epitope of a monoclonal antibody that inhibits mycobacterial adherence to epithelial cells was mapped within the lysine-rich repeats, confirming their involvement in mycobacterial adherence to epithelial cells. Surface plasmon resonance analyses showed that recombinant HBHA binds to immobilized heparin with fast association kinetics (ka = 5.62 (± 0.10) × 105m−1 s−1), whereas the dissociation kinetics were slower (kd = 0.015 (± 0.002) s−1), yielding a KD value of 26 nm. Similar analyses with grafted MBP indicated similar kinetic constants, indicating that the carboxyl-terminal repeats contain the entire heparin-binding site of HBHA. The molecular characterization of the interactions of HBHA with epithelial glycosaminoglycans should help to better understand mycobacterial adherence within the lungs and may ultimately lead to new approaches for therapy or immunoprophylaxis.

Mycobacterium tuberculosisinfects over one-third of the population in the world, causing annually 10 million new cases of active tuberculosis and 3 million deaths (1.Bloom B.R. Murray C.L.

Leprosy, caused by Mycobacterium leprae, remains a major health problem in developing countries (3.Noordeen S.K. Bravo L.L. Sundaresan T.K. Bull. W. H. O. 1992; 70: 7-10PubMed Google Scholar), whereas members of theMycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex are among the most frequent opportunistic pathogens infecting patients suffering from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (4.Horsburgh C.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 324: 1332-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of mycobacterial diseases, their molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood. One of the initial and crucial events in any infectious process is the adherence of the microorganism to its target tissues (5.Finlay B.B. Falkow S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 136-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). Mycobacteria exhibit a tropism for the lungs, and interactions of the tubercle bacillus with alveolar macrophages have been extensively documented (6.Schlesinger L.S. Bellinger-Kawahara C.G. Payne N.R. Horwitz M.A. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2771-2780PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Stokes R.W. Haidl I.D. Jefferies W.A. Speert D.P. J.

However, mycobacterial adhesins interacting with respiratory epithelial cells or extracellular matrix may also play a role in the infection, because these are the first host tissues encountered by mycobacteria when they are transmitted by aerosol.

Because of its capability to agglutinate rabbit erythrocytes, this adhesin was called heparin-binding hemagglutinin (HBHA).1 HBHA is a 199-residue glycoprotein that also induces bacterial autoaggregation (15.Menozzi F.D.

Recombinant HBHA (rHBHA) produced by Escherichia coli is not glycosylated and, in contrast to the native protein, is highly sensitive to proteolytic degradation affecting essentially its carboxyl-terminal end. This part of the protein contains two different lysine-rich repeated motifs (16.Menozzi F.D. Bischoff R. Fort E. Brennan M.J. Locht C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12625-12630Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), named R1 and R2. R1 (KKAAPA) is directly repeated thrice between residues 160 and 177, whereas R2 (KKAAAKK) is repeated twice between amino acids 178 and 194. In this report, we show that these repeats constitute the high affinity heparin-binding site of HBHA and that they are responsible for the binding of HBHA to heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) present on the surface of human pneumocytes. Growth conditions for Mycobacterium bovis BCG (strain 1173P2; World Health Organization, Stockholm, Sweden) have been previously described (15.Menozzi F.D. Rouse J.H. Alavi M. Laude-Sharp M.

Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and other molecular biology reagents were purchased from New England Biolabs, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, or Promega (Madison, WI). Polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were performed using a Perkin-Elmer thermal cycler model 480 (Perkin-Elmer) with 100 ng of purified plasmid DNA and 1 μg of each primer (Table I). All the PCR fragments were sequenced using an ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit and an ABI PRISM 377 sequencer (Perkin-Elmer).

Bischoff R. Fort E. Brennan M.J. Locht C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12625-12630Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) was introduced intoNcoI/HindIII-restricted pET-24d(+) (Novagen), and the resulting plasmid, pET-HBHA, was used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3). The gene coding for a truncated HBHA (rHBHAΔC) lacking amino acids 161–199 was generated by PCR using pKK-HBHA as template and the oligonucleotides HBHA (5′) and HBHAΔC as primers (Table I). The 492-base pair PCR fragment was digested with NcoI and SacI and ligated intoNcoI/SacI-restricted pKK388–1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and pET24d(+) to generate pKK-HBHAΔC and pET-HBHAΔC, respectively. pKK-HBHAΔC was used to transform E. coli XL1-Blue, and pET-HBHAΔC was introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3). Genes coding for HBHA with one (rHBHAΔC+1R1), two (rHBHAΔC+2R1), or three (rHBHAΔC+3R1) R1 motifs were generated by PCR using pKK-HBHA as template and oligonucleotides HBHA (5′) with HBHAΔC+1R1 or HBHAΔC+2/3R1 as primers. After purification and restriction by NcoI and SacI, the PCR fragments were inserted into NcoI/SacI-restricted pET-24d(+), generating pET-HBHAΔC+1R1, pET-HBHAΔC+2R1, and pET-HBHAΔC+3R1, respectively. These plasmids were used to transformE. coli BL21(DE3). Genes encoding maltose-binding protein (MBP) containing various combinations of HBHA repeats (MBP+3R1+2R2 and MBP+1R1+2R2) were generated as follows. First, the 3′-region of the HBHA gene coding for the repeats was amplified by PCR using pKK-HBHA and oligonucleotides E4 (5′) and E4 (3′). Oligonucleotide E4 (5′) has three hybridization sites on the template DNA. However, the PCR generated only two products of 222 base pairs and 186 base pairs that correspond to amino acids 161–199 (3R1+2R2) and amino acids 173–199 (1R1+2R2), respectively. After digestion with EcoRI andPstI, the PCR fragments were ligated intoEcoRI/PstI-digested pMAL-c (New England Biolabs) to generate pMAL+3R1+2R2 and pMAL+1R1+2R2. These plasmids were then used to transform E. coli B834 and E. coliXL1-Blue. Recombinant HBHA with or without the carboxyl-terminal truncations, as well as MBP, MBP+3R1+2R2, and MBP+1R1+2R2 (Table II) were produced in E. coli. After transformation with the appropriate recombinant plasmid, E. coli cells were grown at 37 °C in 250 ml of LB broth supplemented with ampicillin or kanamycin. At an A 600 of 0.5, isopropylthiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and incubations were continued for 4 h. The cultures were then centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C and 7000 ×g. The supernatants were discarded, and the cells were resuspended into 20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 20 mmNa2HPO4, 3.5 mmKH2PO4). Cell suspensions were stored at −20 °C until further use.Table IISchematic representation of HBHA-based recombinant constructsRecombinant proteinsC-terminal sequencesrHBHA-KKAAPA KKAAPA KKAAPA KKAAAKK APA KKAAAKK VTQKrHBHAΔC-rHBHAΔC + 1R1-KKAAPArHBHAΔC + 2R1-KKAAPA KKAAPArHBHAΔC + 3R1-KKAAPA KKAAPA KKAAPArMBP + 3R1 + 2R2-KKAAPA KKAAPA KKAAPA KKAAAKK APA KKAAAKK VTQKrMBP + 1R1 + 2R2-KKAAPA KKAAAKK APA KKAAAKK VTQK Open table in a new tab To purify the rHBHA, frozen recombinant E. coli cell suspensions were thawed and sonicated twice for 5 min at 4 °C using a Branson Sonifier at an output of 5 delivered to a microtip. The bacterial lysates were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were diluted to 100 ml with PBS and then applied onto a heparin-Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (1 × 4 cm) previously equilibrated with 100 ml of PBS. The bound material was eluted with a 0–500 mm NaCl linear gradient prepared in 80 ml of PBS. The column was regenerated by washing the gel with 30 ml of PBS containing 3 m NaCl. All chromatographic steps were carried out at room temperature using a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Native M. bovis BCG HBHA was purified by heparin-Sepharose chromatography as described previously (15.Menozzi F.D. Rouse J.H. Alavi M. Laude-Sharp M. Muller J. Bischoff R. Brennan M.J. Locht C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 993-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). To purify rHBHAΔC, cells from a 250-ml culture of E. coliBL21(DE3)(pET-HBHAΔC) were resuspended into 50 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and sonicated twice for 5 min at 4 °C. The soluble fraction obtained after centrifugation (7000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C) was loaded at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min onto a DEAE-cellulose (DE 52, Whatman, Maidstone, United Kingdom) column (1 × 8 cm) equilibrated with 150 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). rHBHAΔC was eluted using a linear 0–1 m NaCl gradient in 100 ml of 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0). The material eluted between 150 and 200 mm NaCl was collected, diluted twice with 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 4 m NaCl, and finally loaded at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min onto a Phenyl Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (1 × 5 cm) equilibrated with 100 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 m NaCl. rHBHAΔC was eluted with a negative linear 2–0 m NaCl gradient in 100 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The fractions eluted between 0.8 and 0.6 m NaCl contained purified rHBHAΔC, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) performed according to Laemmli (20.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) by using a 4% stacking and 12 or 15% separating gels. After electrophoresis, gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Merck). Protein concentrations were determined according to the method of Bradford (21.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. The BIAcore 2000 apparatus (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was used for real time analysis of molecular interactions between rHBHA, rHBHAΔC, MBP, or MBP+3R1+2R2 and heparin. Biotinylated heparin with an average molecular mass of 5 kDa (Biotinylated-Ardeparin, Celsus Laboratories, Cincinnati, OH) was immobilized onto a streptavidin-coated sensor chip (CM5 Sensor Chip, BIAcore AB). Briefly, the streptavidin was covalently bound to the sensor chip after activation of the chip with a mixture ofN-hydroxysuccinimide andN-ethyl-N′-dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide according to the manufacturer's instructions. 10 μl of biotinylated heparin solution at 5 μg/ml in PBS were injected onto the streptavidin-coated chip, generating an immobilization signal of 250 resonance units. The protein solutions in PBS were then injected at a flow rate of 10 μl/min for 3 min at 25 °C, and binding of soluble proteins to immobilized heparin was measured in resonance units. Concentrations of purified proteins used in the SPR analyses were determined after acid hydrolysis (24 h at 110 °C in 6 N HCl) by total amino acid quantitation performed with a Beckman 6300 amino acid analyzer coupled to a high pressure liquid chromatography detection system (Beckman Gold System). The association (ka) and the dissociation rate constants (kd) were calculated according to the BIAevaluation software 3.0. The affinity constants were calculated from the equation K D=kd /ka . rHBHA, rHBHAΔC, MBP, or MBP+3R1+2R2 did not bind directly to streptavidin bound to the sensor chip. The human lung pneumocyte A549 cell line (CCL185) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% decomplemented fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). 18 h before use, the cells were seeded on glass coverslips at ∼105 cells/12-mm diameter coverslip. After two washes with 1 ml of PBS, the coverslips were incubated with 400 μl of 1 μm rHBHA, rHBHAΔC, MBP, or MBP+3R1+2R2 solution in PBS. After 1 h at 37 °C, the cells were washed three times with 1 ml of PBS containing 0.01% Tween 80, fixed for 10 min with 400 μl of 2% paraformaldehyde, and washed again three times with PBS containing 0.01% Tween 80. The cells were then incubated for 30 min with 400 μl of rabbit anti-rHBHA serum (diluted 500-fold) or rabbit anti-MBP serum (diluted 10,000-fold). After three washes with PBS containing 0.01% Tween 80, 400 μl of 1000-fold-diluted rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were added for 30 min. The cells were washed again three times with PBS containing 0.01% Tween 80 and analyzed using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope. Cells incubated with rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies alone served as a negative control. A549 pneumocytes were propagated in suspension using 293 SFM growth medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 4 mml-glutamine. After 48 h of culture, 5 × 105 cells were collected by low speed centrifugation, washed once with PBS, and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS supplemented with 0.1% BSA (PBS/BSA). Following the addition of 1 unit of chondroitinase ABC (Sigma) or heparinase III (Sigma), the cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, washed twice with PBS/BSA, and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS containing 1 μm rHBHA. After 30 min of incubation at 4 °C followed by 3 washes with PBS/BSA, the cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 1 ml of rabbit anti-rHBHA serum diluted 500-fold. The cells were then washed thrice with PBS/BSA and incubated for 20 min at room temperature in 1 ml of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) diluted 500-fold. After 3 final washes with PBS/BSA, the cells were fixed with 500 μl of 4% paraformaldehyde, and cell-associated fluorescence (percentage of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled pneumocytes) was quantified by flow cytometry using an EPICS Elite cytometer (Coulter, Hialeah, FL). Fluorescence associated with pneumocytes that were not incubated with rHBHA was used to determine nonspecific signals. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (BA 85; Schleicher & Schuell) as described by Towbin et al. (22.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). Immobilized native HBHA, rHBHA, and truncated versions of rHBHA, MBP, or MBP-HBHA hybrid proteins were then probed with purified anti-HBHA monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4057D2 or 3921E4 (23.Rouse D.A. Morris S.L. Karpas A.B. Mackall J.C. Probst P.G. Chaparas S.D. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 2595-2600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 500-fold diluted anti-HBHA rat serum (15.Menozzi F.D. Rouse J.H. Alavi M. Laude-Sharp M. Muller J. Bischoff R. Brennan M.J. Locht C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 993-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), or 10,000-fold diluted rabbit anti-MBP serum (New England Biolabs). mAb 4057D2 was purified by cryoprecipitation (24.Gagnon P. Purification Tools For Monoclonal Antibodies, Validated Biosystems Edition, Tucson, AZ1996Google Scholar), and mAb 3921E4 as purified by protein A-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) chromatography. Immune complexes were developed with alkaline phosphatase-linked goat anti-mouse, anti-rat, or anti-rabbit IgG (ProtoBlot System; Promega, Madison, WI). To investigate the influence of dextran (500 kDa, Sigma), dextran sulfate (500 kDa, Sigma), and heparin (3 kDa, Sigma) on the immunoreactivities, nitrocellulose membranes bearing immobilized antigens were incubated at room temperature for 1 h in PBS containing 500 μg/ml of the polysaccharide to be tested. After two washes with PBS, the membranes were probed with mAb 3921E4 or anti-MBP serum and developed as described above. Unglycosylated rHBHA produced in E. coliundergoes rapid proteolytic degradation affecting its carboxyl-terminal lysine-rich repeats (16.Menozzi F.D. Bischoff R. Fort E. Brennan M.J. Locht C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12625-12630Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This degradation correlates with a reduction of affinity for heparin, raising the possibility that these repeats are involved in heparin binding by HBHA. To test this hypothesis, dextran sulfate (500 kDa) or dextran (500 kDa) was added at 500 μg/ml to anE. coli XL1-Blue(pKK-HBHA). As shown in Fig.1, dextran sulfate but not dextran partially protected rHBHA from proteolysis during incubation at 37 °C. A decrease in dextran sulfate concentration correlated with a reduction of the protective effect (data not shown). These observations suggest that the sulfated polysaccharide masked proteolytic cleavage sites through its binding to the carboxyl terminus of rHBHA. Low molecular mass heparin (3 kDa) did not protect rHBHA, even at concentrations up to 2 mg/ml, indicating that the length of the sulfated polysaccharide may be important to protect rHBHA from proteolytic degradation. To circumvent the degradation of rHBHA, the protein was produced under the control of the T7 promoter in E. coliBL21(DE3), a protease-deficient strain. No significant rHBHA degradation was observed during the first 4 h in an E. coli BL21(DE3)(pET-HBHA) lysate incubated at 37 °C, whereas under the same conditions all rHBHA expressed in E. coliXL1-Blue was cleaved into a 19-kDa polypeptide (16.Menozzi F.D.

After 24 h of incubation, less than 50% of the rHBHA was cleaved into a 25-kDa polypeptide in the E. coli BL21(DE3)(pET-HBHA) lysate (data not shown). These results show that a protease-deficient E. coli strain allows for stable production of rHBHA. Moreover, the use of the T7 promoter instead of the trc promoter permitted a ∼10-fold increase in rHBHA production, as determined by densitometric analysis of the Coomassie-stained electrophoresis gels. The production of rHBHAΔC in E. coliXL1-Blue(pKK-HBHAΔC) and in E. coliBL21(DE3)(pET-HBHAΔC) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Similar to full-length rHBHA, the production of rHBHAΔC was strongly enhanced when the recombinant gene was under the control of the T7 promoter (Fig. 2, compare lanes E and G). In both expression systems, the apparent molecular mass of rHBHAΔC was ∼25.4 kDa, whereas its calculated molecular mass is 17.4 kDa. This difference is similar to that observed for full-length rHBHA (16.Menozzi F.D. Bischoff R. Fort E. Brennan M.J. Locht C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12625-12630Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), indicating that the deletion of the repeated motifs does not abolish the aberrant electrophoretic migration. Incubation of E. coli XL1-Blue(pKK-HBHAΔC) lysates for 1 day at 37 °C revealed that rHBHAΔC does not undergo degradation (data not shown), consistent with the notion that the proteolytic susceptibility of full-length rHBHA concerns the lysine-rich repeats. mAb 3921E4, which blocks the heparin-inhibitable binding of M. tuberculosis to epithelial cells (15.Menozzi F.D.

A. 1998; 95: 12625-12630Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), failed to recognize rHBHAΔC (Fig. 2, lanes E), indicating that at least part of its epitope is located within the HBHA repeats. To determine whether these repeats are involved in the interaction of HBHA with heparin, an E. coli BL21(DE3)(pET-HBHAΔC) lysate was applied onto a heparin-Sepharose column. All the rHBHAΔC was recovered in the flow-through fraction, whereas under the same conditions, full-length rHBHA produced by E. coliBL21(DE3)(pET-HBHA) remained bound to the column. These observations indicate that the lysine-rich motifs of HBHA are involved in the interaction with heparin. To assess the contribution of the R1 repeats to the HBHA-heparin-binding activity and to further map the epitope of mAb 3921E4, rHBHAΔC+1R1, rHBHAΔC+2R1, and rHBHAΔC+3R1 were produced in E. coli BL21(DE3). Recombinant protein production was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using mAb 3921E4 (Fig.3). This antibody failed to recognize rHBHAΔC+1R1 and reacted only faintly with rHBHAΔC+2R1, whereas its reactivity with rHBHAΔC+3R1 was comparable to that observed with rHBHA, suggesting that the mAb 3921E4 epitope overlaps two successive R1 motifs. Interestingly, compared with rHBHA, the rHBHAΔC with 1–3 R1 motifs was less stable in E. coli BL21(DE3), suggesting that the missing carboxyl-terminal amino acids, perhaps the terminal VTQK sequence, may shield from proteolysis (Fig. 3, lanes C–E). When tested for their ability to interact with heparin, rHBHAΔC+1R1 was found unable to bind to heparin-Sepharose, and rHBHAΔC+2R1 bound weakly because it could be eluted with 20 mm NaCl. The presence of the third R1 motif strengthened the interaction with heparin because elution of rHBHAΔC+3R1 required 100 mmNaCl. These results indicate that the R1 motifs are involved in heparin binding, but they are not sufficient for the high affinity binding observed for full-length rHBHA, suggesting that the missing 21 residues, perhaps the R2 motifs, also play a role in the interaction with heparin. To investigate whether the carboxyl-terminal repeats are sufficient for heparin binding, amino acids 161–199 (3R1+2R2) or 173–199 (1R1+2R2) of HBHA were fused to the carboxyl end of MBP. Production of the hybrid proteins MBP+3R1+2R2 and MBP+1R1+2R2 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Both proteins were equally well recognized by mAb 3921E4, confirming that its epitope is located within the repeats. When produced in E. coli XL1-Blue, MBP+3R1+2R2 and MBP+1R1+2R2 were rapidly degraded into polypeptides of 41.5 and 40 kDa, respectively, which were resistant to further degradation and no longer recognized by mAb 3921E4 (data not shown). The capacity of the MBP hybrid proteins to bind to sulfated polysaccharides was investigated by immunoblotting and heparin-Sepharose chromatography. As shown in Fig.4, pretreatment of nitrocellulose membranes bearing MBP+3R1+2R2 with dextran sulfate but not with unsulfated dextran impeded the subsequent recognition by mAb 3921E4 but not that of anti-MBP antibodies, suggesting that the sulfated polysaccharide bound to the hybrid protein and masked the 3921E4 epitope. The size of the sulfated polysaccharide appeared to be important as low molecular weight heparin did not inhibit 3921E4 reactivity (data not shown). To determine whether the fusion of the HBHA repeats to MBP induces its binding to heparin,E. coli B834(pMAL-c), E. coliB834(pMAL+3R1+2R2), and E. coli B834(pMAL+1R1+2R2) lysates were subjected to heparin-Sepharose chromatography. Whereas MBP was unable to bind to heparin, MBP+3R1+2R2 bound to the column and was eluted with 300 mm NaCl (Fig.5), a condition similar to that required for the elution of rHBHA. MBP+1R1+2R2 also bound to heparin-Sepharose but less strongly because it was eluted with 100 mm NaCl. These results indicate that the molecular determinants required for the heparin-binding activity of HBHA are all located within the carboxyl-terminal repeats and that the heparin-binding activity of HBHA can be transferred to an heterologous protein by tagging with the HBHA repeats.Figure 5Heparin-Sepharose chromatography of anE. coli B834(pMAL+3R1+2R2) lysate.

We examined the possible function of the PPAR-γ pathway in osteoclast (Ocl) formation from CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (CD34+ HSCs), using a co-culture system comprised of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and CD34+ HSCs, both derived from bone marrow. Ocl formation in this co-culture system is enhanced by the addition of exogenous osteoprotegerin ligand (OPGL), an essential Ocl differentiation factor, and macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF). The data indicate that soluble OPGL (sOPGL) and M-CSF stimulate Ocl formation in the co-cultures up to 4-fold compared with CD34+ HSCs alone treated with sOPGL and M-CSF. CD34+ HSCs, but not hMSCs, express PPAR-γ, and 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin-J2 (15d-PG-J2), a PPAR-γ agonist, completely blocked the effects of sOPGL and M-CSF on Ocl formation and activity. The inhibitory effect of 15d-PG-J2 is specific to the Ocl lineage in both human and mouse models of osteoclastogenesis. Accordingly, parallel experiments demonstrate that sOPGL activates the NF-κB pathway within mouse Ocl progenitors, and this effect was abolished by 15d-PG-J2. These data establish a link between PPAR-γ and OPGL signaling within Ocl progenitors, and support a role for PPAR-γ pathway in the modulation of osteoclastogenesis.

These cells are targets for therapies designated to retard or abolish metabolic bone loss, such as osteoporosis. Abnormal levels of cytokines and growth factors in the bone marrow microenvironment contribute to pathological resorption of bone by the Ocls (1.Mundy G.R. Boyce B.F. Yoneda T. Bonewald L.F.

Because the Ocls and their progenitors are sensitive to cytokines, uncovering the regulatory mechanisms of the actions of key cytokines is important to identifying new drug targets to prevent excessive bone resorption. One candidate in regulating cytokine effects is the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors expressed in adipose tissue, adrenal gland, spleen, endothelium, and hematopoietic tissue (8.Kliewer S.A.

Treatment of monocytes or HL-60 monocytic leukemia cells with PPAR-γ agonists results in the conversion of these into foam cells (12.Tontonoz P. Nagy L. Alvarez J.G.A. Thomazy V.A. Evans R.M.

Cell. 1998; 93: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). Treatment of activated monocytes/macrophages with PPAR-γ agonists reduces the expression of inflammatory molecules (e.g. inducible nitric oxide synthase, gelatinase B, scavenger receptor A, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)) in response to phorbol ester stimulation (9.Ricote M.

Nature. 1998; 391: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Thus, PPAR-γ appears to regulate several functions of lineage-committed hematopoietic cells. Following ligand binding, PPAR-γ heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptor, and serves as a transcriptional regulator of target genes. PPAR-γ cooperates with members of the CAAT/enhancer-binding protein family to promote adipocyte differentiation in certain cell types (14.Mandrup S. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5367-5370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), and it inhibits gene expression in monocytes/macrophages, in part by antagonizing the activity of other transcription factors, including NF-κB and AP-1 (9.Ricote M. Li A.C. Willson T.M. Kelly C.J. Glass C.K. Nature. 1998; 391: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3271) Google Scholar). The NF-κB family of transcriptional activators regulates the expression of a variety of cytokines involved in Ocl differentiation, including IL-1, TNF-α, IL-6, and granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (15.Reddy S.V. Roodman G.D. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1998; 8: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, mice with a deletion of the gene encoding p50/p52 heterodimer of the NF-κB/Rel family exhibited osteopetrosis due to a deficiency in Ocl differentiation (16.Franzoso G.

However, the relationship between Ocl-regulating factors and PPAR-γ has not been investigated.

To test the involvement of PPAR-γ in Ocl formation, we employed a co-culture system in which the promotion of Ocl formation from CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (CD34+ HSCs) by human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) is enhanced by exogenous cytokines, including OPGL. hMSCs are multipotent, adult stem cells that are isolated from bone marrow and can give rise to various structural and connective tissue types, including bone marrow stroma, osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes (21.Pittenger M.F. Mackay A.M. Beck S.C. Jaiswal R.K. Douglas R. Mosca J.D. Moorman M.A. Simonetti D.W. Craig S. Marshak D.R. Science. 1999; 284: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (18139) Google Scholar). We found that CD34+ HSCs, but not hMSCs, expressed PPAR-γ and that activation of PPAR-γ pathway in Ocl precursors inhibited sOPGL-induced NF-κB activation, and consequently, blocked sOPGL-induced Ocl formation and activity. Ciglitazone, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin-J2 (15d-PG-J2), and PG-J2 were purchased from Biomol Research Laboratory (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Dexamethasone, indomethacin, and insulin were obtained from Sigma. Collagenase was purchased from Wako Chemicals (Richmond, VA). Dispase was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN), M-CSF and sOPGL were purchased from PeproTech, Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). Human bone marrow aspirates were purchased from Poietics, a division of BioWhittaker (Gaithersburg, MD). The hMSCs were isolated from fresh bone marrow aspirates and culture expanded as described previously (21.Pittenger M.F. Mackay A.M. Beck S.C. Jaiswal R.K. Douglas R. Mosca J.D. Moorman M.A. Simonetti D.W. Craig S. Marshak D.R. Science. 1999; 284: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (18139) Google Scholar). Culture medium for hMSCs consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-low glucose (DMEM; Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% (v/v) of selected lots of fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone, Salt Lake City, UT) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Adipogenic differentiation of hMSCs was induced as described previously (21.Pittenger M.F. Mackay A.M. Beck S.C. Jaiswal R.K. Douglas R. Mosca J.D. Moorman M.A. Simonetti D.W. Craig S. Marshak D.R.

Cultures were then maintained for 72 h in adipogenic medium (MDII) containing DMEM-high glucose, 10% (v/v) FBS, 10 μg/ml insulin, 1 μm dexamethasone, 0.1 mm indomethacin, and 0.5 mmisobutylmethylxanthine. The medium was changed and cultures were then incubated for 24 h with adipogenic maintenance medium containing DMEM-high glucose with 10% (v/v) FBS and 10 μg/ml insulin. This sequence was repeated three times, after which the cultures were maintained in adipogenic maintenance medium for 1 week. Medium was changed every 3–4 days. Half of the cultures were then fixed and stained with Oil-Red O (21.Pittenger M.F. Mackay A.M. Beck S.C. Jaiswal R.K. Douglas R. Mosca J.D. Moorman M.A. Simonetti D.W. Craig S. Marshak D.R.

Briefly, passage-1 hMSCs were treated with an osteogenic supplement (OS) containing 100 nm dexamethasone, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 50 μml-ascorbic acid-2-phosphate for 4, 8, or 16 days. CD34+HSCs were immunoaffinity purified (purity >95%) from healthy human bone marrow by Poietics (Gaithersburg, MD). Aliquots (5 × 104/cm2) of cryopreserved CD34+HSCs were added to monolayers of hMSCs from passage 1 to 3. These co-cultures were maintained in DMEM-low glucose supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in the presence or absence of PPAR-γ agonists, 40 ng/ml sOPGL, and/or 25 ng/ml M-CSF for 1 week at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere. Every 3 days, half of the culture medium was gently removed, to minimize loss of nonadherent cells, and replaced with an equal volume of fresh medium. Cells were fixed and stained for TRAP activity as described below. Mouse Ocl precursors were isolated from the bone marrow of 4–6-week-old mice (22.Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. McHugh K.P. Livolsi A.

Cells were then treated with vehicle or 5 μm 15d-PG-J2. After 2 days cultures were fed with fresh medium containing M-CSF and sOPGL. At day 4 the cells were fixed and stained for TRAP activity as described below. To examine the effects of sOPGL and 15d-PG-J2 on IL-6 production in mouse Ocl precursors, cells were cultured for 3 days as previously described (22.Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. McHugh K.P. Livolsi A.

Conditioned media were harvested 2 h after treatment, and IL-6 production was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Proteins were measured using BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL). At the end of the culture period, the medium was removed and the cells were fixed by the addition of a 60% (v/v) acetone solution prepared in sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.4) for 30 s. The fixed cells were washed twice with distilled water and air dried. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive (TRAP+) cells were detected using a TRAP staining kit (Sigma). TRAP+ multinucleated cells (three or more nuclei) (Ocls) were counted manually using a light microscope (23.Mbalaviele G. Nishimura R. Myoi A. Niewolna M. Reddy S.V. Chen D. Feng J. Roodman G.D.

Bone resorption by the Ocls in vitro was assessed using smoothened elephant tusk slices (4 × 4 × 0.1 mm) as described previously (24.Mbalaviele G. Jaiswal N. Meng A. Cheng L. van Den Bos C. Thiede M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3736-3743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Briefly, co-cultures were washed twice with PBS, treated twice with collagenase and dispase (1 mg/ml each diluted in PBS) for 15 min at 37 °C. The supernatants containing hMSCs were discarded. Adherent cells consisting of Ocls and Ocl precursor cells were washed vigorously 3 times with PBS, and detached from the dishes by incubating with 0.05% (w/v) trypsin for 3 min at 37 °C (this last step was repeated). The detached cells were recovered by centrifugation, washed twice with hMSC medium, and plated onto sterile tusk slices on which confluent hMSCs were pre-seeded. Co-cultures were maintained for 24 h in the absence or presence of sOPGL, M-CSF, and 15d-PG-J2. At the end of the co-culture period, cells were stained for TRAP activity to visualize Ocls as described above. Tusk slices were subsequently incubated with 0.1 m NaOH solution followed by ultrasonication for 2 min, then placed in 1% (w/v) aqueous toluidine blue solution containing 1% (w/v) sodium borate for 5 min to stain (26.Prallet B.

RT-PCR was performed using single-stranded cDNA prepared from total RNA (1 μg) using a GeneAmp RT-PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer, Foster City, CA). The upstream primer (up) and downstream primer (dp) were designed as follows: PPAR-γ: up 5′-ATGGGTGAAACTCTGGGAGA-3′ and dp 5′- GTACTCTTGAAGTTTCAGGTC-3′, expected size = 399 base pairs. OPG: up 5′-ACCACTACTACACAGACAGC-3′ and dp 5′-AGGAGACCAAAGACACTGCA-3′, expected size = 438 base pairs. OPGL: up 5′-TTCTATTTCAGAGCGCAGAT-3′ and dp 5′-AGTCATGTTGGAGATCTTGG-3′, expected size = 316 base pairs. Competitive RT-PCR was performed in the presence of decreasing amounts (10 to 0 ng) of an homologous competitor DNA fragment. The up 5′-TTCTATTTCAGAGCGCAGATACCACTACTACACAGACAGC-3 and the dp 5′-AGGAGACCAAAGACACTGCAAGTCATGTTGGAGATCTTGG-3′ of the competitor (expected size = 380 base pairs) were complementary to sequences within both OPG and OPGL cDNAs as well as the competitor DNA fragment. The sizes of the DNA amplicons were selected to be approximately the same order to avoid preferential amplification of any fragment based on its size. Cells were maintained in either hMSC medium or adipogenic medium MDII for 1, 2, 3, or 5 days. Total RNA was isolated by guanidinium lysis and separated by density centrifugation using a SW 40-Ti rotor. Lysates (9.0 ml) were spun at 100,000 × g for 23 h through a 2.5-ml cushion of 5.7 m CsCl and 0.1 m EDTA at pH 7.0. RNA (10 mg) was separated in formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred onto nylon modified membranes (Hybond). Mouse PPAR-γ cDNA (a gift from Dr. Jeffrey Gimble, Oklahoma City, OK) was labeled by the random primer method using [α-32P]dATP and [α-32P]dCTP. Membranes were hybridized for 16 h at 42 °C, washed with Tris buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.6, 1m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) SDS) at 42 °C, then with citrate buffer (30 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) SDS) at 42 °C, and again with citrate buffer at 60 °C. Membranes were exposed to x-ray films (Kodak BioMax MS film) at −80 °C in the presence of intensifying screens. Nuclear extracts were prepared from cultured cells following Abu-Amer et al. (27.Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. Edwards J. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In brief, mouse Ocl precursors were plated in 100-mm tissue culture dish (7 × 106/dish) in α-MEM in the presence of 10 ng/ml M-CSF. On day 3, cells were treated with vehicle or 5 μm 15d-PG-J2 for 30 min followed by treatment with 20 ng/ml sOPGL for the indicated time points. Control plates were treated with ethanol, 5–10 ng/ml TNF-α, or 100 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide for 30 min. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and treated with 5 mm EDTA and 5 mm EGTA in PBS for 30 min. Cells were then resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer A (10 mmHEPES, pH 7.8, 1.5 mm MgCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin) and incubated on ice for 15 min. Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.64% (w/v), and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 × g. The supernatant was removed, and nuclei were resuspended in nuclear extraction buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 420 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm MgCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml leupeptin) and rotated for 30 min at 4 °C. The extracts were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was transferred to a tube. The protein concentration was measured using standard BCA kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Aliquots (10 μg) of nuclear extracts were incubated with 5′-32P-end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probes. The oligonucleotide sequence (5′-AAACAGGGGGCTTTCCCTCCTC-3′) was derived from the Kappa B3 site of the TNF promoter. The reaction was performed at room temperature for 30–60 min in a total of 20 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 10% glycerol). Samples (10 μl) were fractionated on a 4–20% gradient TBE gel and the proteins were visualized by autoradiography. All data were analyzed by a pairedt test. Samples were run in triplicates and data represent the mean ± S.E. Independent experiments were performed at least twice. We showed previously that hMSCs promote osteoclastogenesis while hMSCs treated with substances that promote osteogenic (osteoblast) differentiation failed to support Ocl formation in vitro (24.Mbalaviele G. Jaiswal N. Meng A. Cheng L. van Den Bos C. Thiede M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3736-3743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the first part of this study, we wanted to validate hMSC-based osteoclastogenesis model by determining the expression of OPG and OPGL, two key regulators of osteoclastogenesis (3.Lacey D.L.

Gene Dev. 1998; 12: 1260-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar). Using RT-PCR we found that both OPG and OPGL mRNA were expressed by hMSCs, and that osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs was associated with a decline in OPGL mRNA levels (Fig.1 A, top panel) and a concomitant increase in OPG mRNA levels (Fig. 1 A, middle panel). Quantitative competitive RT-PCR was used to demonstrate that levels of OPGL mRNA in hMSCs were 10 times higher than those of OPG mRNA (Fig. 1 B, − OS), while in osteogenic hMSCs (Fig. 1 B, + OS) OPG mRNA levels were 100 times higher than those of OPGL mRNA. These data indicate that in vitro differentiation of hMSCs into the osteogenic lineage is associated with a decrease in OPGL/OPG ratio. To determine further the role of OPGL in hMSC-based osteoclastogenesis, CD34+ HSCs and hMSC co-cultures were treated for 1 week with purified, recombinant sOPGL. Co-cultures treated with sOPGL had ∼3 times more Ocls than untreated co-cultures (Fig.2). M-CSF, another osteoclastogenic factor is also expressed by hMSCs (24.Mbalaviele G. Jaiswal N. Meng A. Cheng L. van Den Bos C. Thiede M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3736-3743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Majumdar M.K. Thiede M.A. Mosca J.D. Moorman M. Gerson S.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar); addition of this factor alone to hMSCs and CD34+ HSC co-cultures had no effect on Ocl formation. In contrast, the addition of both sOPGL and M-CSF significantly stimulated Ocl formation over control or M-CSF alone. Addition of both sOPGL and M-CSF to the cultures of CD34+HSCs without hMSCs induced Ocl formation (102 ± 22 Ocls/5 × 104 CD34+ HSCs). However, the numbers of Ocls produced in these cultures were lower than those produced in sOPGL- and M-CSF-treated co-cultures with hMSCs (440 ± 16 versus102 ± 22, in the presence or absence of hMSCs, respectively). These data suggest that the sOPGL and M-CSF are not sufficient to induce maximal Ocl differentiation from CD34+ HSCs without hMSCs. Evidence that PPAR-γ antagonizes NF-κB transcriptional activity (9.Ricote M. Li A.C. Willson T.M. Kelly C.J. Glass C.K. Nature. 1998; 391: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3271) Google Scholar), and that the signaling pathway of OPGL also known as RANKL/TRANCE involves NF-κB (29.Darnay B.G. Haridas V. Ni J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20551-20555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) led us to examine the expression of this nuclear receptor by hMSCs and CD34+HSCs. We used RT-PCR and Northern blotting to demonstrate that CD34+ HSCs expressed PPAR-γ mRNA (Fig.3 A). The hMSCs that were induced to differentiate into adipocytes (≥90%) upon treatment with adipogenic medium MDII also expressed PPAR-γ mRNA (Fig. 3,A and B). However, using RT-PCR and Northern techniques, all attempts failed to show the expression of PPAR-γ mRNA in hMSCs not treated with MDII). The sequence of the DNA amplicons exhibited 100% identity to PPAR-γ2 (30.Mukherjee R. Jow L. Croston G.E. Paterniti Jr., J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8071-8076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Our finding that PPAR-γ is expressed by CD34+ HSCs led us to examine the effects of PPAR-γ agonists on the ability of sOPGL to stimulate Ocl formation in the co-cultures. Addition of relatively low concentrations of 15d-PG-J2 (1–5 μm) blocked sOPGL-induced Ocl formation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4, left bottom panel). The addition of 15d-PG-J2 inhibited the formation of TRAP+ mononucleated cells (i.e. Ocl precursors) suggesting that this PPAR-γ agonist interfered with early events in Ocl differentiation. Dose-response experiments (Fig.5) showed that 15d-PG-J2 is at least 5-fold more potent than PG-J2 in inhibiting Ocl formation in CD34+ HSCs and hMSC co-cultures.Figure 5PPAR-γ agonists inhibit Ocl formation.

To be able to effectively treat HIV infection in the future, further new drugs with activity against the emerging drug-resistant viruses will be required. The non-nucleoside inhibitors of reverse transcriptase (NNRTIs) are now established as part of multidrug combinations for treating HIV infection (4.De Clercq E. Antiviral Res. 1998; 38: 153-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 5.Gazzard B.G. Int. J. Clin. Pract. 1999; 53: 60-64PubMed Google Scholar). So-called “first generation” NNRTI drugs, such as nevirapine and delavirdine (U-90152), are generally very susceptible to the effects of single point resistance mutations within RT (6.Richman D.

Crystallographic and kinetic studies indicate the mechanism of inhibition of NNRTIs is via a distortion of the catalytic aspartate residues in the polymerase active site (19.Esnouf R. Ren J. Ross C. Jones Y. Stammers D. Stuart D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar,20.Spence R.A. Kati W.M. Anderson K.S. Johnson K.A. Science. 1995; 267: 988-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). More recently structural studies have revealed some common factors that contribute to the second generation properties of UC-781 (21.Ren J. Esnouf R.M. Hopkins A.L. Warren J. Balzarini J. Stuart D.I. Stammers D.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14394-14403Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Such factors include a combination of a nonaromatic moiety of optimal size that contacts the aromatic residues Tyr-181, Tyr-188, and Trp-229 at the top of the NNRTI pocket. Additionally, the presence of main chain hydrogen bonding and an overall small compound bulk, thereby allowing rearrangement within a mutated drug binding site, appear to be important. A new NNRTI S-1153 (also now referred to as AG1549) has recently been described (Scheme FS1), which appears to have better resilience properties than any previously reported compound (22.Fujiwara T. Sato A. el-Farrash M. Miki S. Abe K. Isaka Y. Kodama M. Wu Y. Chen L.B. Harada H. Sugimoto H. Hatanaka M Y H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 1340-1345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). S-1153 is also structurally distinct from other second generation inhibitors such as efavirenz (8.Young S.D. Britcher S.F. Tran L.O. Payne L.S. Lumma W.C. Lyle T.A. Huff J.R. Anderson P.S. Olsen D.B.

Antiviral Res. 1995; 27: 219-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (Scheme FS1). S-1153 retains full activity against the clinically most common NNRTI resistance mutation, Lys-103 → Asn, compared with the 47-fold loss of activity seen for nevirapine (Table I). Almost full activity is also retained for mutations at codons 106, 188, 190, and 227, whereas nevirapine shows ≫74-fold weaker binding to these mutants (22.Fujiwara T. Sato A. el-Farrash M. Miki S.

High level resistance to S-1153 requires at least two mutations (e.g. Val-106 → Ala and Phe-227 → Leu, or Lys-103 → Thr, Val-106 → Ala and Leu-234 → Ile (22.Fujiwara T. Sato A. el-Farrash M. Miki S.

Indeed even some double mutations have only a limited effect, thus Val-106 → Ala and Tyr-181 → Cys result in only an 8-fold loss of activity (TableI).Table IComparison of sensitivities of HIV-I containing mutations within the reverse transcriptase to NNRTIs S-1153 and nevirapineHIV-1 mutantEC50 (mutant)/EC50(wild type)aEC50 is defined as the concentration of compound required to inhibit syncytia formation in HIV-infected cells (adapted from Ref. 22).S-1153NevirapineLeu-100 → Ile3.02.1Lys-103 → Asn1.044.1Val-106 → Ala4.5≫74Tyr-181 → Cys13.5≫74Tyr-188 → Cys1.5≫74Gly-190 → Ala1.1≫74Phc-227 → Leu1.54.1Leu-234 → Ile21.90.5Pro-236 → Leu3.53.1Val-106 → Ala & Tyr-181 → Cys8.1≫74a EC50 is defined as the concentration of compound required to inhibit syncytia formation in HIV-infected cells (adapted from Ref. 22.Fujiwara T.

Open table in a new tab To investigate the structural basis of this remarkable resilience, we have determined a crystal structure of S-1153 in complex with its molecular receptor HIV-1 RT. Knowledge derived from this study should be of value in the design of novel inhibitors that are active against drug-resistant HIV strains. Further, such drugs will be of importance for the continued effective treatment of HIV infection and AIDS. Crystals of the complex of HIV-1 RT with S-1153 (synthesized at Shionogi and Co. Ltd.) were grown and treated prior to data collection as described previously (23.Stammers D.K. Somers D.O.N. Ross C.K. Kirby I. Ray P.H. Wilson J.E. Norman M. Ren J.S. Esnouf R.M. Garman E.F.

Table II shows the statistics on the refinement and quality of the structure. All figures were produced using BOBSCRIPT (29.Esnouf R.M. J. Mol.

An “omit” electron-density map for S-1153 unambiguously revealed the orientation and conformation of the inhibitor in the NNRTI binding site (Fig. 1). A comparison of the bound conformation of S-1153 with the first generation NNRTI, nevirapine, is shown in Fig. 2 a, whereas an overlap of S-1153 with the second generation NNRTI, UC-781, is shown in Fig. 2 b. There is mutual overlap between the cyclopropyl group of nevirapine, part of the furanyl ring of UC-781, and the isopropyl group of S-1153. These structural features position the side chain of Tyr-181 so as to give tight binding (15.Hopkins A.L. Ren J. Esnouf R.M. Willcox B.E. Jones E.Y. Ross C. Miyasaka T. Walker R.T. Tanaka H. Stammers D.K. Stuart D.I. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 1589-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). For S-1153, the 3,5-dichlorophenyl ring is situated further toward the “top” of the NNRTI pocket than the equivalent aromatic ring for nevirapine, TNK-651 (15.Hopkins A.L. Ren J. Esnouf R.M. Willcox B.E. Jones E.Y. Ross C. Miyasaka T. Walker R.T. Tanaka H. Stammers D.K. Stuart D.I. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 1589-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), or GCA-186 (32.Hopkins A.L. Ren J. Tanaka H. Baba M. Okamato M. Stuart D.I. Stammers D.K. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 4500-4505Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This reflects the close association of the 3,5-dichlorophenyl ring with the side chain of Trp-229, which appears to be repositioned higher in the pocket because of a conformational change in the β9-β10-β11 strands, caused by the interaction between the pyridyl and carbamate groups of S-1153 with Pro-236 in the β10-β11 loop (Fig. 2 a). As a result the β9-β10-β11 strands are pushed away from the pocket giving a more open pocket entrance (16.Esnouf R.M. Ren J. Hopkins A.L. Ross C.K. Jones E.Y. Stammers D.K. Stuart D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3984-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and allowing the side chain of Trp-229 to sit higher. The magnitude of this conformational change is exemplified by the mean displacement of α-carbon positions for residues 227–241 in different RT/NNRTI complexes. For RT/nevirapine and RT/UC-781 this is 1.3 Å, whereas for RT/S-1153 and RT·nevirapine this displacement is 3.2 Å, and for RT/S-1153 and RT/UC-781 it is 3.6 Å. The carbamoyloxymethyl group of S-1153 has little overlap with groups in other RT/NNRTIs complexes except for delavirdine, where the carbonyl oxygen is in a similar position (16.Esnouf R.M. Ren J. Hopkins A.L. Ross C.K. Jones E.Y. Stammers D.K. Stuart D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The Cα backbone and side chains of RT/nevirapine and RT/UC-781 are shown in light gray, and those of RT/S-1153 are in dark gray. The superimpositions were carried out using residues 94–118, 156–215, and 317–319 of the p66 subunit and 137–139 of the p51 subunit. Because of the large movements of residues in the β9-β11 sheet, these were not used in the superposition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The interactions of S-1153 with HIV-1 RT are shown in Figs.3 and 4. As with all other NNRTIs there are a wide range of hydrophobic contacts between inhibitor and protein. The 3,5-dichlorophenyl group is positioned edge on to the plane of the indole ring of Trp-229, making extensive favorable contacts with a closest approach of 3.7 Å. There are also contacts between the 3,5-dichlorophenyl group and the aromatic rings of Tyr-181 and Tyr-188 (the latter also contacts the sulfur atom of the inhibitor). The other substituents of the imidazole ring make many interactions with the protein. The pyridyl group contacts the side chain of Phe-227 and the main chain of His-235; this group is positioned parallel with the side chain of Pro-236 but approaches no closer than 4.5 Å. The isopropyl group contacts the main chain of Tyr-188 and in addition the side chain of Val-106. The methyl carbamoyloxymethyl group contacts a number of residues at the base of the pocket including Lys-101, Lys-102, and Lys-103 (Fig. 3.).Figure 4Stereo view of S-1153 positioned in the NNRTI binding pocket. Hydrogen bonds that form interactions between S-1153 and the RT main chain either directly or via a water molecule are shown as dashed yellow lines. The inhibitor is shown in standard atom colors. The protein main chain backbone and side chains are shown in cyan and gray, respectively. Water molecules are represented as magenta spheres.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The most surprising feature of the interaction of S-1153 with the NNRTI binding site is the series of three hydrogen bonds with the protein main chain of RT (Figs. 3 and 4). The carbamoyloxymethyl group of S-1153 forms two direct hydrogen bonds with the protein main chain: from its nitrogen to the main chain carbonyl of Pro-236 and from the terminal oxygen to the main chain nitrogen of Lys-103. The conformational rearrangement of the β9-β10-β11 strands described above results in Pro-236 shifting by about 3.5 Å, breaking a main chain hydrogen bond from its carbonyl to Lys-103, and positioning it instead to hydrogen bond to the carbamate nitrogen of S-1153. A final hydrogen bond is mediated via a water molecule from an imidazole nitrogen of S-1153 to the main chain carbonyl of Lys-101 (Fig. 4). Given the substantial data base of structures of RT/NNRTI complexes, we are in a position to dissect out structural features responsible for the resilience of S-1153 to drug resistance mutations within RT. The most remarkable feature of the interaction of S-1153 with HIV RT is the network of three hydrogen-bonding interactions with the main chain, two of which are direct to the protein, whereas one is mediated by a water molecule. The presence of an appropriately positioned carbamate group provides two of these hydrogen bonds (to residues 103 and 236). This is entirely unprecedented for an RT/NNRTI complex. Some inhibitors for example, nevirapine, α-APA (12.Ren J. Esnouf R. Garman E. Somers D. Ross C. Kirby I. Keeling J. Darby G. Jones Y. Stuart D. Stammers D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), and BM+21.1326(17) bind to RT without any main chain hydrogen bonding. There are several examples of NNRTIs with single hydrogen-bonding interactions with the main chain. Thus in the case of Cl-TIBO, emivirine (MKC-442), TNK-651, UC-10, UC-38, UC-84, UC-781, each inhibitor has an interaction with the main chain carbonyl of Lys-101 (13.Ren J. Esnouf R. Hopkins A. Ross C. Jones Y. Stammers D. Stuart D. Structure. 1995; 3: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 15.Hopkins A.L. Ren J. Esnouf R.M. Willcox B.E. Jones E.Y.

Balzarini J. Stuart D.I. Stammers D.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14394-14403Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Delavirdine (U-90152) has a pair of hydrogen bonds from its carbonyl oxygen and indole nitrogen groups to the main chain of Lys-103 (16.Esnouf R.M. Ren J. Hopkins A.L. Ross C.K. Jones E.Y. Stammers D.K. Stuart D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3984-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bonding to the main chain of Pro-236 as observed here for S-1153 has not been previously reported for any other NNRTI. The rearrangement of the β9-β10-β11 sheet reported here, which is necessary for the Pro-236 main chain hydrogen bonding interaction with S-1153, is facilitated by the great flexibility of this part of the NNRTI pocket that we have previously characterized through the substantial differences in conformation observed for complexes with TNK-651 (15.Hopkins A.L. Ren J. Esnouf R.M. Willcox B.E. Jones E.Y. Ross C. Miyasaka T. Walker R.T. Tanaka H. Stammers D.K. Stuart D.I. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 1589-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) and delavirdine (16.Esnouf R.M. Ren J. Hopkins A.L. Ross C.K. Jones E.Y. Stammers D.K. Stuart D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3984-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Such flexibility presents additional opportunities for favorable interactions but also makes the job of predicting inhibitor interactions with RT from modeling studies problematic. It seems likely that the extensive network of main chain inhibitor hydrogen bonds observed contribute substantially to the free energy of binding for the inhibitor. In this case we would expect them to confer favorable resilience properties to mutation within the protein, because side chain changes will generally have no direct effect on such interactions. Indeed tissue culture experiments show that for HIV to escape S-1153, multiple mutations in RT are required (22.Fujiwara T. Sato A. el-Farrash M. Miki S. Abe K. Isaka Y. Kodama M. Wu Y. Chen L.B. Harada H. Sugimoto H. Hatanaka M Y H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 1340-1345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Examples of this include the double mutation of Val-106 → Ala and Phe-227 → Leu (both of these side chains make significant contacts with the inhibitor) and a triple mutant with Lys-103 → Thr, Val-106 → Ala, and Leu-234 → Ile. This second clone has Val-106 → Ala in common with the double mutant and this change presumably acts directly. Model building studies indicate that the Leu-234 → Ile mutation gives unfavorable contacts with the S-1153 pyridyl group as a result of the close approach of the CG2 methyl moiety of the isoleucine side chain. The mutation at 103 is, however, more intriguing; a change at codon 103 from lysine to asparagine is the most commonly observed NNRTI resistance mutation in the clinic, giving wide cross-resistance to most NNRTIs (7.Schinazi R.F. Larder B.A. Mellors J.W. Int. Antiviral News. 1997; 5: 129-135Google Scholar). We have suggested that this may be because of the stabilization of the unliganded enzyme by the formation of a hydrogen bond between the asparagine side chain and the hydroxyl group of Tyr-188 (19.Esnouf R. Ren J. Ross C. Jones Y. Stammers D. Stuart D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). S-1153, however, shows no loss of potency for the Lys-103 → Asn mutation (22.Fujiwara T. Sato A. el-Farrash M. Miki S. Abe K. Isaka Y. Kodama M. Wu Y. Chen L.B. Harada H. Sugimoto H. Hatanaka M Y H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 1340-1345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and modeling indicates that a hydrogen bond might be formed between the carbonyl moiety of the asparagine side chain and the imidazole nitrogen of S-1153, canceling out the effect of stabilization of the unliganded enzyme. It is not entirely clear why, in the presence of S-1153, threonine is selected as a mutation at codon 103 rather than asparagine, because its shorter side chain would be unable to make this interaction, and it is unclear that it could stabilize the unliganded enzyme. A second possible source of resilience in the RT/S-1153 interactions may be the relative flexibility of the inhibitor itself, which might allow it to adapt to a mutated drug pocket more readily than, for example, the rigid fused ring structure of the first generation compound nevirapine. Further structural work on mutant RT/S-1153 complexes is required to test this possibility. Other features in the interactions of S-1153 with RT set it aside from second generation NNRTIs such as UC-781. Thus UC-781 has a small nonaromatic dimethylallyl group occupying the “top” of the NNRTI pocket, whereas S-1153 has a more bulky phenyl ring, reminiscent of many first generation compounds. However, the presence of the 3,5-dichloro substituents results in more extensive contacts with the highly conserved Trp-229 side chain, when compared with the unsubstituted phenyl ring of a first generation compound such as TNK-651 (15.Hopkins A.L. Ren J. Esnouf R.M. Willcox B.E. Jones E.Y. Ross C. Miyasaka T. Walker R.T. Tanaka H. Stammers D.K. Stuart D.I. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 1589-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Indeed direct support for this explanation comes from a study where 3,5-dimethyl substitution of the phenyl ring of the emivirine analogue GCA-186 results in the compound being substantially less affected by the Tyr-181 → Cys mutation (32.Hopkins A.L. Ren J. Tanaka H. Baba M. Okamato M. Stuart D.I. Stammers D.K. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 4500-4505Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Thus an appropriately substituted phenyl ring provides an alternative route to resilience to this mutation compared with the small nonaromatic moieties of other second generation NNRTIs. Second generation NNRTIs can employ alternative strategies to minimize the effects of many drug resistance mutations within RT. S-1153 has distinctive features, when compared with second generation compounds such as UC-781, in its interactions with RT. This leads to the hope that a range of further NNRTIs can be designed to progressively counter newly emerging resistant HIV strains resulting from the strong selective pressure of effective chemotherapy.

However, based on an in vitro system that reconstitutes homotypic fusion of yeast vacuoles, Ungermann and co-workers (30.Ungermann C. Sato K. Wickner W. Nature. 1998; 396: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) deduced that the formation of the SNARE complex is only an intermediate step in the overall fusion reaction. According to this view, SNARE molecules are involved only in docking between donor and acceptor membranes, whereas another set of proteins participates in subsequent stages of the fusion process. A variety of cell-free systems that reconstitute specific transport steps was used to identify many proteins implicated in intracellular vesicular transport. A well studied transport system that reconstitutes transport of proteins between early Golgi cisternae was originally developed by Rothman and co-workers (31.Balch W.E. Dunphy W.G. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 405-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). This assay measures the glycosylation of a cargo protein (vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G protein), present in one Golgi membrane population, by glycosyltransferase present in another stack of Golgi that does not contain the cargo protein. By using this assay, it has been shown that COPI-coated transport vesicles are formed in a reaction that utilizes a small GTPase, termed ARF1, and a complex of cytosolic coat protein termed coatomer (32.Orci L. Palmer D.J. Amherdt M. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 364: 732-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Docking and fusion in this assay require a set of membrane and cytosolic factors. NSF, SNAP, p115, GATE-16, phosphatidylinositol transfer protein α, and a 13 S Golgi transport complex were isolated as cytosolic factors that are essential for this assay (17.Waters M.G. Clary D.O.

By using this intra-Golgi cell-free transport assay, we describe in this study the identification of a novel, soluble factor that participates in intra-Golgi transport in vitro. We have purified this transport activity 2500-fold using conventional chromatography steps, testing each fraction for its capability to stimulate intra-Golgi transport in the presence of all complementary cytosolic factors. The purification procedure described here resulted in a highly enriched fraction containing two polypeptides, identified as phosphoglucomutase (PGM) and a 56-kDa selenium-binding protein (SBP56). The transport activity was attributed to SBP56, originally discovered as a cytosolic protein that binds exogenously administered radioactive selenium (43.Bansal M.P. Oborn C.J. Danielson K.G. Medina D. Carcinogenesis. 1989; 10: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 44.Bansal M.P. Mukhopadhyay T. Scott J. Cook R.G. Mukhopadhyay R. Medina D. Carcinogenesis. 1990; 11: 2071-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To date, however, the physiological role of SBP56 has not been elucidated. The data presented in the present study suggest that SBP56 participates in late stages of intra-Golgi transport. Most solutions used in this work are coded as follows: T, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, at room temperature; K, KCl, with the adjacent number indicating the concentration in mm; βm, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol; G, 10% v/v glycerol; and M, 5 mm MgCl2. Thus, 50 KTβmGM contains 50 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 10% v/v glycerol, and 5 mmMgCl2. In cases where sodium phosphate was used, NaPi indicates 10 mm sodium hydrophosphate. Bovine brain and rat liver cytosols were prepared as described by Malhotra et al. (8.Malhotra V. Serafini T. Orci L. Shepherd J.C. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1989; 58: 329-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and Waters et al. (17.Waters M.G. Clary D.O. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), respectively. Fraction β was prepared as described previously (35.Legesse-Miller A. Sagiv Y. Porat A. Elazar Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3105-3109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). P115 and Rab-GDI were purified from bovine liver cytosol as described previously (17.Waters M.G. Clary D.O. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 45.Elazar Z. Mayer T. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 794-797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The standard intra-Golgi transport was performed as described previously (31.Balch W.E. Dunphy W.G. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 405-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). The Iα-dependent intra-Golgi transport assay (25 μl) contained 0.4 μCi of UDP-[3H]N-acetylglucosamine, 5 μl of a 1:1 mixture of donor and acceptor Golgi membranes (2–3 μg of protein), 2.5 μl (10 μg) of β cytosolic fraction, 2.5 μl (6 μg) of IIα cytosolic fraction, 0.25 μl (6.25 ng) of His6NSF, 0.25 μl (30 ng) of His6αSNAP, 1.25 μl (0.5 μg) of p115, 10 μm palmitoyl-coenzyme A, and ATP- and UTP-regenerating systems. To test for the transport activity of Iα, different cytosolic fractions were added to the Iα-dependent assay mixture. The transport reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 2 h. [3H]N-acetylglucosamine incorporated into VSV-G protein was determined as described previously (35.Legesse-Miller A. Sagiv Y. Porat A. Elazar Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3105-3109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Each of the transport assay experiments shown in this study represents at least three independent assays performed in duplicate. Background (200–310 cpm) detected in the absence of cytosolic fraction was subtracted from all experiments. For the glycosylation assay, “wild-type donor” membranes were prepared as described by Taylor et al. (46.Taylor T.C. Kanstein M. Weidman P. Melancon P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 237-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, Golgi membranes were isolated from wild-type CHO cells infected with VSV, after which the isolated wild-type donor membranes were treated with NEM (1 mm) for 15 min on ice, at which time DTT (2 mm) was added to quench any remaining NEM. The glycosylation assay was performed under identical conditions described for either the standard transport assay or the Iα-dependent assay described above. Starting with 8.4 g of bovine brain cytosol, the cytosol concentration was adjusted to 12 mg/ml by dilution with 50 KTβmM, pH 7.4. Ammonium sulfate was slowly added while stirring until a final concentration of 40% saturation at 4 °C was reached. The solution was stirred for additional 30 min and centrifuged in a Sorvall GS3 rotor at 8,500 rpm for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in 120 ml of 50 KTβmGM and dialyzed against 50 KTβmM, and the insoluble material was removed by ultracentrifugation in a Beckman 45Ti rotor at 35,000 rpm for 1 h. This material was designated AS precipitate. The AS precipitate was adjusted to 5 mg/ml with 100 KTβmGM, pH 7.4, and loaded at 5 ml/min onto a 300-ml Fast-flow Q column equilibrated with 100 KTβmGM. The column was washed with 400 ml of equilibration buffer, and the flow-through material (1.2 mg/ml) was collected. This material was designated α. The bound material of this column was used for preparing the cytosolic fraction β. The α material was dialyzed against NaPiβmM, pH 6.8, centrifuged in a Sorvall GS3 rotor at 8,500 rpm for 10 min, and then loaded at 5 ml/min onto a 150-ml Fast-flow Carboxyl Methyl (CM) column equilibrated in NaPiβmGM, pH 6.8. The column was washed with 150 ml of the same buffer, and the flow-through material, designated Iα, was collected. This material had a protein concentration of 0.7 mg/ml. Recently, a 16-kDa novel protein (GATE-16) involved in transport was purified from the bound material of this column (35.Legesse-Miller A. Sagiv Y. Porat A. Elazar Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3105-3109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 59.Sagiv Y. Legesses-Miller A. Porat A. Elazar Z. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1494-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The bound material containing p16 was used for preparing the cytosolic fraction IIα. The Iα was dialyzed extensively against NaPiβmM, pH 5.0, and centrifuged in a Sorvall GS3 rotor at 8,500 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellets were discarded, and supernatants were pooled. This material, designated IαpH 5.0, had protein concentration of 0.085 mg/ml. The conductivity of IαpH 5.0 was adjusted to that of NaPiβmGM buffer, pH 5.0, by dilution with the same buffer to a final volume of 750 ml. IαpH 5.0 was then loaded at 2 ml/min onto a 20-ml Mono-S column (fast performance liquid chromatography) and equilibrated in NaPiβmGM, pH 5.0. The column was washed with 24 ml of the equilibration buffer, and proteins were eluted with a 170-ml gradient of 0–500 mm KCl in NaPiβmGM buffer (2.94 mm/ml gradient). Fractions of 4 ml were collected throughout, and 10-μl samples were tested for their transport activity using the Iα-dependent transport assay. Fractions exhibiting significant intra-Golgi transport activity, eluted at about 150–350 mm KCl, were pooled and collectively designated IαMS. This material had protein concentration of 0.093 mg/ml. The conductivity of IαMS was adjusted to 1500 mm KCl by the addition of solid KCl, and the pH was adjusted to 7.4 by Tris base titration. IαMS was then loaded at 0.3 ml/min onto 1-ml phenyl-Superose column (fast performance liquid chromatography) equilibrated in 1500 KTβmGM. The column was washed with 8 ml of equilibration buffer, and proteins were eluted with a 20-ml decreasing gradient of 1500 to 0 mm KCl in KTβmGM (−37.5 mm/ml gradient), followed by 20-ml elution of 0 KTβmGM. Fractions of 1 ml were collected throughout, and 10-μl samples were tested for their transport activity using the Iα-dependent transport assay. Fractions showing transport activity, eluted at 80–0 mm KCl, were pooled and collectively designated IαPS. This material had protein concentration of 0.02 mg/ml. IαPS was dialyzed against NaPiβmGM, pH 6.8, and loaded at 2 ml/min onto ∼1-ml hydroxylapatite column equilibrated in the dialysis buffer. The column was washed with 5 ml of equilibration buffer and then subjected to a 10-ml phosphate gradient from 10 to 225 mmNaPiβmGM (21.5 mm/ml gradient), followed by a steeper phosphate gradient of 225–400 mmNaPiβmGM (35 mm/ml gradient). Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected throughout, and 10-μl samples were tested for their transport activity using the Iα-dependent transport assay. Fractions showing transport activity, eluted at about 15–50 mm NaPi, were pooled and collectively designated IαHA. This material had protein concentration of 0.0045 mg/ml. To obtain the amino acid sequence of the proteins found in IαHA, ∼10 μg were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE. Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained protein bands were excised, digested in situwith trypsin, and the resultant fragments were separated by reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography. Peptides were sequenced with automated sequencer at the MicroSequencing Unit, the Protein Center, the Technion, Israel. For most analyses, electrophoresis was performed on 10% polyacrylamide gels (8 × 10 cm), after which proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose. Antibody incubations were carried out in 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline. The source of antibodies and dilutions for Western blots are indicated specifically for each assay. All antibodies were reacted either by peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit, followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection. Proteins were visualized on polyacrylamide gels by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The full-length SBP56 cDNA in pRc/CMV plasmid was received as a gift from the laboratory of Dr. P. R. Harrison, the Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, Glasgow, UK. The full-length SBP56 cDNA was subcloned using HindIII into pQE11 (Qiagen) plasmid containing His6 tag in the N terminus.Escherichia coli JM109 (DE3), transformed by the pQE11-SBP56 construct, was grown in 12 liters of Luria-Bertani (LB) broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C to an A 600 of 0.90, induced with 1 mm IPTG for 4 h, and centrifuged in Sorvall GS3 rotor at 8,500 rpm for 15 min. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in a breaking buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm KCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm imidazole, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μm pepstatin A. Resuspended bacteria cells were lysed by the French press technique and clarified by centrifugation at 35,000 rpm (119,000 × g av) for 90 min, using 45Ti rotor (Beckman). Clarified supernatant was loaded over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-agarose column (Qiagen) and washed with 50 ml of breaking buffer, and His6-SBP56 protein was eluted by linear gradient of 20–300 mmimidazole. Fractions of 5 ml, containing recombinant SBP56 (rSBP56), were collected, dialyzed against 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, and 10% (v/v) glycerol, and stored in aliquots at −80 °C until use. His6-tagged SBP56 was purified as described above and used to raise polyclonal antibodies in rabbits by the animal service unit at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Specific anti-SBP56 polyclonal antibodies were affinity-purified on a cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose column coupled to His6-SPB56. Eluted fractions containing antibodies were pooled and concentrated on Centricon-30 filters (Amicon). The buffer was then changed to phosphate-buffered saline using 5-ml HiTrap™ Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Aliquots were stored at −20 °C until use. Affinity-purified anti-SBP56 polyclonal antibodies (1 mg) were bound to protein A-agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and covalently coupled to the matrix by dimethyl pimelimidate-2HCl (Pierce). Rat liver cytosol (30 mg/ml) was diluted 6-fold with 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mmDTT, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. Immunodepletion of SBP56 was performed by two successive incubations with protein A-agarose (32 μg IgG per mg of cytosol proteins per incubation), each for 6 h, followed by overnight continuous mixing at 4 °C. Rat liver lysates were fractionated over sucrose gradients as described previously (47.Taylor R.S. Jones S.M. Dahl R.H. Nordeen M.H. Howell K.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1911-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) with several modifications. Briefly, fresh rat livers (25 g) were washed with a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 320 mm sucrose. The tissue was then homogenized with a Teflon homogenizer in 150 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (0.1 m KPi, pH 6.8, 0.5m sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μmpepstatin A). The homogenate was centrifuged in an SS-34 rotor (Sorvall) at 1360 × g av for 10 min. The post-nuclear supernatant was decanted, and 18 ml were layered over each of four 0.86/1.25 m sucrose step gradients (10 ml each step) in SW-28 centrifuge tubes (all sucrose solutions were buffered with 0.1 m KPi, pH 6.8, 5 mmMgCl2). Gradients were centrifuged at 4 °C in an SW-28 rotor (Beckman) at 25,000 rpm (82,700 ×g av) for 90 min. The 0.86/1.25 minterface was adjusted to 1.6 m sucrose by 2 msucrose solution, and 10 ml were loaded onto each of two SW-28 centrifuge tubes. This layer was overlaid with 1.25, 1.0, 0.86, and 0.5m sucrose layers (each of 7 ml). The gradients were centrifuged at 4 °C in a SW-28 rotor (Beckman) at 25,000 rpm (82,700 × g av) for 2.5 h with slow acceleration and deceleration. All fractions from the second gradient were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE. Fractionated proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis with affinity-purified anti-SBP56 (1:5000 dilution), anti-GOS28 monoclonal antibodies (1:20 dilution), and anti-PDI monoclonal antibodies (SPA-891 1:1000 dilution). Several cytosolic and peripheral membrane proteins involved in vesicular transport were previously identified using an in vitro system that reconstitutes intra-Golgi transport (2.Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar). In this system the requirement for crude cytosol can be replaced by a complementation assay in which a signal is observed only upon the addition of the protein of interest in the presence of saturating levels of all known cytosolic factors. Following this rationale, we have recently developed a purification scheme for the isolation of a novel cytosolic transport factor, GATE-p16 (35.Legesse-Miller A. Sagiv Y. Porat A. Elazar Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3105-3109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 59.Sagiv Y. Legesses-Miller A. Porat A. Elazar Z. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1494-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In the process of cytosol fractionation, we identified two crude fractions, Iα and β, that are required for a successful reconstitution of intra-Golgi transport (see scheme in Fig.1 A). To focus on the activity found in fraction Iα, we developed a specific Iα-dependent transport assay in which NSF, αSNAP, p115, fraction IIα, and fraction β are required to replace crude cytosol (Fig. 1 B). However, these cytosolic proteins were not sufficient to reconstitute intra-Golgi transport, unless fraction Iα was added. The reconstitution brought about by Iα (Fig. 1 B, right panel) was somewhat less efficient than transport obtained with crude cytosol (Fig. 1 B, left panel). The Iα-dependent transport assay was found sensitive to NEM, and the transport activity could be partly restored with recombinant NSF, similar to the assay reconstituted with crude cytosol (Fig.1 C). Hence, it appears that Iα acts as part of the known transport machinery. This assay was therefore used in the present study to purify and characterize the active factor present in Iα. Vesicular transport was shown to be blocked by GTPγS, a nonhydrolyzable analogue of GTP (48.Melancon P. Glick B.S. Malhotra V. Weidman P.J. Serafini T. Gleason M.L. Orci L. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1987; 51: 1053-1062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). GTPγS fails to block the observed signal when (i) either the small GTPase, an ADP-ribosylation factor, or coatomer is removed from the cytosol (42.Elazar Z. Orci L. Ostermann J. Amherdt M. Tanigawa G. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 46.Taylor T.C. Kanstein M. Weidman P. Melancon P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 237-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), or (ii) when their function is blocked by brefeldin A (BFA) (49.Orci L. Tagaya M. Amherdt M. Perrelet A. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott S.J. Klausner R.D. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1991; 64: 1183-1195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), conditions that uncouple fusion from budding (42.Elazar Z. Orci L. Ostermann J. Amherdt M. Tanigawa G. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, sensitivity of the transport assay to GTPγS and BFA indicates whether the obtained signal results from a fusion reaction coupled to vesicles budding. As shown in Fig.2, GTPγS inhibited transport reconstituted with crude cytosol, an inhibition that could be reversed by BFA. In contrast, the Iα-dependent assay was stimulated by GTPγS and remained resistant to BFA (Fig. 2), suggesting that Iα is involved in the uncoupled fusion process, namely docking or f"

Similar to the concept of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, these conjugates are regulated by a large number of deconjugating enzymes. Here, we report the cloning of a 2,141-base pair DNA fragment from human placenta cDNA library by a strategy that involves expressed sequence tag data base searching, polymerase chain reaction, and rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the cloned cDNA contains an open reading frame of 1,143 base pairs encoding a novel protease, USP21, which is composed of 381 residues with a calculated molecular mass of 43 kDa. The humanUSP21 gene is located on chromosome 1q21 and encodes a member of the ubiquitin-specific protease family with highly conserved Cys and His domains. The activity and specificity of USP21 were determined by using a COS cell expression system in vivo.We showed that USP21 is capable of removing ubiquitin from ubiquitinated proteins as expected. Furthermore, USP21 is capable of removing NEDD8 from NEDD8 conjugates but has no effect on Sentrin-1 conjugates. As expected from its biochemical activity, overexpression of USP21 has a profound growth inhibitory effect on U2OS cells. Thus, USP21 is the first ubiquitin-specific protease shown to have dual specificity for both ubiquitin and NEDD8 and may play an important role in the regulation of cell growth.

The activated Ub is then transferred to the SH group of a Cys residue in the active site of a Ub-conjugating enzyme (E2 or Ubc). Finally, in the presence of a Ub-protein ligase (E3), the C-terminal Gly residue of Ub is conjugated via an isopeptide bond to the ε-amino group of a Lys residue on the target protein. Sequential conjugation of Ub to a previously conjugated Ub by linking the ε-amino group of one Ub lysine residue to the C terminus of another Ub results in the formation of polyubiquitin chain, which targets proteins for degradation by the 26 S proteasome (3.Pickart C.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1055-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 4.DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22123-22126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Regulation of these processes requires precise timing and specific recognition of different substrates at appropriate cellular milieu, thought to be mediated by a combinatorial usage of different E2 and E3 enzymes and by a large family of deubiquitinating enzymes (5.Wilkinson K.D. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 6.D'Andrea A. Pellman D. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 337-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Deubiquitinating enzymes are ubiquitin-specific thiol-proteases that cleave either linear ubiquitin precursor proteins or ubiquitin conjugates. Some deubiquitinating enzymes appear to perform an editing function, which controls the fidelity of the conjugation process, thus preventing inappropriate degradation of cellular proteins. Two families of deubiquitinating enzymes have been identified on the basis ofin vitro activities and/or sequence identity. The ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs) are small (approximately 25 kDa) thiol proteases that share amino acid sequence identity and cleave esters and amids from the C terminus of ubiquitin (5.Wilkinson K.D. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Unrelated in sequence to the UCHs are the ubiquitin-specific proteases (UBPs), a large family of proteins differing greatly in length but characterized by sequence similarity in several regions: the Cys box, the His box, and six other blocks of amino acid sequence identity (5.Wilkinson K.D. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). In recent years, ubiquitin-like proteins, such as UCRP/ISG15, Sentrin-1, and NEDD8, have greatly expanded the scope of post-translational protein modification (7.Yeh, E. T.

These ubiquitin-like proteins are translated in precursor form, with one or more amino acids following a Gly-Gly dipeptide that forms the C terminus of the mature protein. The proteases specific for Sentrin-1 and Smt-3 are structurally different from the Ubiquitin-specific UBPs and the UCHs (14.Gong L. Millas S. Maul G. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3355-3359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 15.Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). UCH-L3, originally identified as a ubiquitin-specific hydrolase, has been shown by our laboratory to possess a C-terminal hydrolase activity for NEDD8 (8.Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J.

Commun. 1998; 251: 688-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, the isopeptidase responsible for NEDD8 deconjugation has not been identified. Here, we report the identification of a novel protease, USP21 (ubiquitin-specific protease21), which is not only specific for ubiquitin conjugates but also functions as a NEDD8-specific isopeptidase. To clone USP21, we used a similar strategy as previous described (14.Gong L. Millas S. Maul G. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3355-3359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 18.Gong L. Li B. Millas S. Yeh E.T.H.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12036-12042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). We first performed a TBLASTN search of the human EST data base using the conserved sequences previously identified as the Cys and His boxes (5.Wilkinson K.D. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). This search identified 59 positive EST clones. After further analysis, three EST clones (R25480, F11440, and W79945) were found to have highly conserved Cys box sequences differing from known UBPs. Further search of the human EST data base using the nucleotide sequence of R25480 revealed two additional EST clones (D31406 and DS1281) that partially overlap with R25480. PCR amplification was then used to confirm that bothD31406 and R25480 were from the same cDNA fragment. RACE was performed to extend the cDNA sequence toward the 5′ direction. Finally, using a pair of redesigned 5′ and 3′ primers compatible with the sequence revealed in the 5′ extension and cloned PCR fragment, we amplified a 2195-base pair cDNA fragment by PCR reaction. The nested primers were synthesized on the basis of the information obtained from the positive EST clones. These primers were used to amplify the novel protease gene fragments by PCR from a human placenta cDNA library. Both PCR and RACE were performed as described previously (14.Gong L. Millas S. Maul G. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3355-3359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 18.Gong L. Li B. Millas S. Yeh E.T.H.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12036-12042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences were determined using dye terminator sequencing and an automated sequencer from Applied Biosystems Inc. (Foster City, CA). To study the expression pattern of the USP21 gene, a commercially available Northern blot (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) containing ∼2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from eight different tissues was used. The full-length coding region for UNSP1 was used as template. The cDNA probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the random primers DNA labeling system (Life Technologies, Inc.), and unincorporated nucleotide was removed by chromatography on a NucTrap column (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Prehybridization and hybridization were performed under conditions recommended by the supplier. The blot was dried and autoradiographed with an x-ray film and intensifying screen at −70 °C for 3 days. COS-M6 cells were grown to approximately 80% confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mml-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). 5 μg of plasmid and 25 μg of lipid were added to 500 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (serum- and antibiotic-free) and then incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After this time, the lipid/DNA mix was diluted 5-fold with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% antibiotics) for 2 days. The cells were harvested in lysis buffer, and the proteins were separated on a 15% acrylamide gel and subsequently transferred to a nitrocellulose polyvinyl difluoride membrane. After blocking for 1 h in 5% skim milk, the filters were incubated with anti-RH antibody (used at dilution 1:4000; Qiagen) for 1 h. After five 5-min washes in TBST (0.5 n NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% Tween 20), filters were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C with goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:2000). Blots were developed by the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cysteine residue of USP21 that lies within the conserved UBP Cys domain (Cys37) was mutated to alanine using deoxyoligonucleotides and the Stratagene QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's specifications. The plasmid pcDNA3-USP21 was used as a template. Mutation was confirmed through DNA sequencing. U2OS cells (8 × 105) were plated in a 10-cm dish and transfected by LipofectAMINE either with 5 μg of control empty pcDNA3 vector or of the same vector containing the USP21 sequence in the same orientation. After 24 h, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with fresh 10% serum-containing medium. After incubation for another 24 h, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, rinsed off the plates with 0.05% trypsin, 0.2% EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline, collected in 10% serum-containing medium, and then split at different dilutions and subcultured into medium containing 500 μg/ml G418. After 14 days of incubation drug-resistant colonies were counted after trypan blue staining. Using a combined PCR cloning and EST data base search technique described previously (14.Gong L. Millas S. Maul G. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3355-3359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 18.Gong L. Li B. Millas S. Yeh E.T.H.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12036-12042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), a 2141-base pair cDNA fragment was cloned from a human placenta cDNA library. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of the cloned cDNA are shown in Fig.1. The cloned cDNA has the following features: 1) a translation initiation codon (ATG) is located at nucleotide positions 727–729, preceded by a 726-base pair 5′-untranslated sequence. The ATP triplet is preceded by an in-frame stop codon at nucleotide positions 514–516. (2.Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar) A translation termination codon TGA is located at nucleotide positions 1869–1872, followed by a 3′-untranslated region of 269 nucleotides. At the 3′ terminus a potential polyadenylation signal, AATAAA, is present at nucleotide 2128. (3.Pickart C.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1055-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) The cloned fragment encodes a 381-amino acid polypeptide, called USP21 (approved by the Human Genome Nomenclature Committee). The calculated molecular mass for USP21 is 43,031 Da. The amino acid sequence of USP21 was compared with sequences in several data bases using the BLAST network service at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The results indicated that USP21 is a novel member in the ubiquitin-specific protease family as shown in Fig.2. Similar to DUB-1, a deubiquitinating enzyme with growth-suppressing activity, USP21 contains all eight conserved sequence motifs originally identified in the yeast ubiquitin-specific proteases (5.Wilkinson K.D. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). These domains include a conserved cysteine residue and two histidine residues, respectively, that presumably form part of the active site of these thiol proteases (Fig.2).Figure 2A, sequence alignment of DUB-1 and USP21. The numbers correspond to the sequence of USP21.B, sequence alignment of the Cys box and the His box in the members of the UBP family. Identical amino acids are in bold type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To study the expression of USP21, we designed a probe that has little homology to the other UBP genes. On a Northern blot analysis, a single transcript of approximately 2.2 kilobases was detected in all the tissues, indicating that the isolated cDNA was likely to be full length (Fig. 3). In addition,USP21 was expressed at different levels in the tissues examined. The highest level of USP21 expression was found in the heart, pancreas, and skeletal muscle. USP21 messages could also be detected in the brain, placenta, liver, and kidney but are very low in the lung. The human USP21 cDNA sequence was used to search the human EST data base using the BLASTN program, and 42 positive EST clones were identified. All of these EST clones were used to check the Human Gene Map data base. 11 of them (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTM accession numbers T33337, T33359,T16677, R54635, H42874, W74194, R45549, R56564, H17877, N64752, andR76797) have been mapped to chromosome 1 between D1S484 and D1S426 microsatellite markers at 173–181 centimorgans (National Center for Biotechnology Information). Thus, the USP21 gene is located in chromosome 1q21. We first tested the activity of USP21 in vivousing DUB-1 as a comparison. DUB-1 contains all eight conserved sequence motifs as shown in Fig. 2 A, and the glutathioneS-transferase-DUB-1 fusion protein has been shown to cleave ubiquitin from a ubiquitin-β-galactosidase protein in vitro (20.Zhu Y. Carroll M. Papa F. Hochstrasser M. A'Andrea A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3275-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A COS cell expression system was used to demonstrate the activity of USP21 in vivo. Briefly, plasmid containing His-tagged ubiquitin was introduced into COS-M6 cells by liposome-mediated transfection as described previously (8.Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 9.Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14001-14004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Total cell lysates were prepared 16 h after transfection for Western blot analysis using anti-RH antibody. As shown in Fig.4, lysates prepared from COS cells expressing RH-tagged Ub revealed a ladder of ubiquitin monomer, multimers, and ubiquitin-conjugated proteins (lanes 2 and5). When RH-tagged Ub was co-expressed with HA-tagged USP21 in the COS cells, the higher molecular weight ubiquitin conjugates were completely removed (lane 3). The disappearance of the high molecular weight ubiquitin conjugates also coincided with the accumulation of either a 38-kDa band (lane 3) or free ubiquitin monomers (lane 6). However, when RH-tagged Ub was co-expressed with HA-tagged DUB-1 in COS cells, no significant change in the pattern of ubiquitination was observed (lane 4). These data suggest that USP21 is capable of deconjugating most ubiquitinated proteins, whereas DUB-1 may be more limited in its substrate selection. Both USP21 and DUB-1 have a conserved Cys box (72% identity) as shown in Fig. 2. The Cys60 in DUB-1 has been shown to be required for ubiquitin-specific thiol protease activity (20.Zhu Y. Carroll M. Papa F. Hochstrasser M. A'Andrea A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3275-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). When the conserved cysteine residue (Cys37) of USP21 was mutated to alanine (C37A), the activity of USP21 was completely abolished (Fig. 4, lane 7), suggesting that the activity of USP21 is critically dependent on the conserved cysteine residue, as are other UBP family members. We next tested the activity of USP21 against other ubiquitin-like proteins using the COS cell expression system described above. As shown in Fig. 5, when RH-tagged NEDD8 was expressed in COS cells, a series of bands in a ladder-like pattern representing NEDD8-conjugated proteins were observed (lanes 1 and 4). However, when RH-tagged NEDD8 was co-expressed with HA-tagged USP21 in the COS cells, the higher molecular weight NEDD8 conjugates were completely removed (lane 5). The disappearance of the high molecular weight NEDD8 conjugates also coincided with the accumulation of free NEDD8 monomers (lane 5). As expected, the (C37A)USP21 point mutant also lost its activity against NEDD8 conjugates (lane 6). Furthermore, USP21 has no effect on Sentrin conjugates, demonstrating that USP21 is not a generalized isopeptidase for all ubiquitin-like proteins (lanes 10–12). These results are consistent with the previous observation that the Sentrin-specific protease, SENP1, is structurally different from UBPs (14.Gong L. Millas S. Maul G. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3355-3359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). NEDD8 is 60% identical and 80% homologous to ubiquitin, whereas sentrin is only 18% identical and 48% similar to ubiquitin. Thus, it is not entirely surprising that NEDD8 and ubiquitin could share similar UBPs. To test whether other UBPs may also be active against NEDD8 conjugates, we tested the effect of DUB-1 on NEDD8 (lane 2) or Sentrin conjugates (lane 8). As shown in Fig. 5, DUB-1 has no activity against either NEDD8 or Sentrin conjugates. This observation suggests that USP21 is a unique UBP with dual specificity for NEDD8 and ubiquitin. Naviglio et al.(21.Naviglio S. Matteucci C. Matoskova B. Nagase T. Nomura N. Di Fiore P. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3241-3250Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) have previously shown that UBPY(USP8), another UBP family member, inhibits U2OS cell growth. We asked whether USP21 also have similar biological property. As shown in Fig. 6, USP21 inhibited cell growth by up to 80% as compared with control in two separate experiments. In contrast, SENP1, a Sentrin-specific protease, only showed 15% inhibition of cell growth. These data suggest that USP21 has a profound effect on cell growth regulation similar to UBPY. In conclusion, USP21 is an novel member of the UBP family that appears to possess dual specificity for both NEDD8 and ubiquitin conjugates and may play important role in the regulation of cell growth.

https://openalex.org/W2002344485,"Receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins are linked to activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) via receptor- and cell-specific mechanisms. We have demonstrated recently that gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor occupancy results in activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) through a mechanism requiring calcium influx through L-type calcium channels in αT3-1 cells and primary rat gonadotropes. Further studies were undertaken to explore the signaling mechanisms by which the GnRH receptor is coupled to activation of another member of the MAPK family, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). GnRH induces activation of the JNK cascade in a dose-, time-, and receptor-dependent manner in clonal αT3-1 cells and primary rat pituitary gonadotrophs. Coexpression of dominant negative Cdc42 and kinase-defective p21-activated kinase 1 and MAPK kinase 7 with JNK and ERK indicated that specific activation of JNK by GnRH appears to involve these signaling molecules. Unlike ERK activation, GnRH-stimulated JNK activity does not require activation of protein kinase C and is not blocked after chelation of extracellular calcium with EGTA. GnRH-induced JNK activity was reduced after treatment with the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA-AM (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester), whereas activation of ERK was not affected. Chelation of intracellular calcium also reduced GnRH-induced activation of JNK in rat pituitary cells in primary culture. GnRH-induced induction and activation of the JNK target c-Jun was inhibited after chelation of intracellular calcium, whereas induction of c-Fos, a known target of ERK, was unaffected. Therefore, although activation of ERK by GnRH requires a specific influx of calcium through L-type calcium channels, JNK activation is independent of extracellular calcium but sensitive to chelation of intracellular calcium. Our results provide novel evidence that GnRH activates two MAPK superfamily members via strikingly divergent signaling pathways with differential sensitivity to activation of protein kinase C and mobilization of discrete pools of calcium.

Three major MAPK family members are known to exist: ERKs (p42 and p44 MAPKs), JNK, and p38 MAPK (1.Cobb M.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). ERKs are often activated by growth factors and have been shown to regulate growth and differentiation in many cells (2.Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). JNK and p38 are often activated by stress stimuli such as ultraviolet irradiation or osmotic shock and, in many cases, inhibit cell growth or cause apoptosis (3.Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F85-F104PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is becoming increasingly more obvious that these three MAPKs have diverse functions in differentiated cells and that the balance of their concurrent activation may be regulated in a complex manner and instrumental in the control of differentiated cell function. Definition of MAPK signaling pathway architecture and regulation is necessary for examining the consequences of concurrent activation of multiple MAPK superfamily members. G protein-coupled receptors activate MAPK signaling pathways through mechanisms that vary with specific ligand-receptor interactions, heterotrimeric G protein subtypes, and cellular phenotype (1.Cobb M.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). The hypothalamic decapeptide GnRH is coupled to concurrent activation of all three family members of the MAPK superfamily. Activation of the Gq/11-coupled receptor for GnRH in the clonal gonadotrope αT3-1 cell line or in pituitary cells in primary culture results in stimulation of a complex signaling cascade that includes activation of phospholipase C, production of IP3 and diacylglycerol, and subsequent activation of PKC (4.Horn F.

In addition, GnRH receptor occupancy is linked with an increase in intracellular calcium through mobilization of two distinct pools in both αT3-1 cells and rat pituitary gonadotrophs (4.Horn F. Bilezikjian L.M. Perrin M.H. Bosma M.M. Windle J.J. Huber K.S. Blount A.L. Hille B. Vale W. Mellon P.L. Mol.

Extracellular calcium enters the cell through VGCCs in the plasma membrane while IP3 releases calcium from intracellular stores. The IP3-released calcium has been shown to be the critical signal required for secretion of the gonadotropic hormones, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone (7.Marian J. Conn P.M.

Influx of calcium through L- and T-type VGCCs is initiated independently from the IP3-mediated signal, but calcium influx through the plasma membrane is ultimately required for replenishment of intracellular stores (9.Hille B. Tse A. Tse F.W. Bosma M.M. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1995; 50: 75-95PubMed Google Scholar). We have demonstrated recently that calcium influx through VGCCs is absolutely required for activation of ERK by the GnRH receptor agonist buserelin in both αT3-1 cells and pituitary cells maintained in primary culture (10.Mulvaney J.M. Zhang T. Fewtrell C. Roberson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29796-29804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Further, stimulation of VGCCs was a sufficient signal for activation of ERK in the absence of hormone. IP3-released calcium did not appear to be involved in the signaling cascade linking the GnRH receptor to ERK activation. Activation of ERK by GnRH in αT3-1 cells required PKC (11.Sundaresan S. Colin I.M. Pestell R.G. Jameson J.L. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 12.Reiss N. Llevi L.N. Shacham S. Harris D. Seger R. Naor Z. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1673-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and our results led to the hypothesis that the GnRH-induced VGCC signal required for activation of ERK may be located downstream of PKC activation (10.Mulvaney J.M. Zhang T. Fewtrell C. Roberson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29796-29804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The goal of the experiments described here was to investigate possible differences in mechanisms integrating activation of the ERK and JNK pathways induced by GnRH receptor occupancy. We report that the signaling cascade linking the GnRH receptor to JNK may involve Cdc42-, PAK1- and MKK7-like molecules. In contrast to the signaling pathway for activation of ERK, GnRH-induced activation of JNK occurs independently of both PKC activation and extracellular calcium. Activation of JNK, but not ERK, by GnRH was inhibited by chelation of intracellular calcium. Inhibition of GnRH-induced JNK activity by chelation of intracellular calcium was also observed in studies using rat pituitary cells in primary culture. Our results support the conclusion that there is divergence in the signaling pathways coupling the GnRH receptor to multiple MAPKs with selective requirements for classical downstream signaling molecules as well as PKC and pharmacologically distinct calcium signals. Defining specific elements that are critical for activating MAPKs is fundamental to the understanding of GnRH-mediated regulation of immediate early and late response genes that control gonadotrope function. αT3-1 cells, an immortalized mouse pituitary cell line of the gonadotrope lineage, were cultured in monolayer in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 5% horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were grown to approximately 70% confluence before use in studies. For kinase assays and immunoblot studies, cells were serum starved for 2 h before receiving hormone. Some experiments were carried out using EGTA to chelate extracellular calcium. The ionic concentration of calcium chloride in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium is 1.8 mm. The GnRH agonist buserelin ((d-SER(tBU)6,Pro9-ethylamide)GnRH) was applied to the cells at 10 nm for various lengths of time. Drugs (nifedipine, PMA, BAPTA-AM, H-89, staurosporine, BIM 1, and BIM 5) were prepared as stock solutions in Me2SO, acetone, or ethanol and applied to the cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were never exposed to > 0.1% Me2SO, acetone, or ethanol, and these concentrations of vehicle had no effect on responses of αT3-1 cells. Pituitary cells for primary cultures were taken from the anterior pituitary of adult female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats. Pituitaries were placed in filter-sterilized dissociation medium consisting of 137 mm NaCl, 25 mm Hepes, 1 mm KCl, 2 mm glucose, pH 7.3. The pituitaries were sliced into small fragments and digested with collagenase type II (1 mg/ml) and hyaluronidase type V (1 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. After digestion, cells were triturated, collected, and placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 5% horse serum. This procedure was repeated three times, and cells were collected after each trituration. Cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated dishes and maintained in culture for 48 h before treatment with hormone. For immunoprecipitations, cells were treated with drugs for specified time periods and then washed with ice-cold buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl and 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.5). The cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm sodium vanadate, 5 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride on ice for 10 min. The cell lysates were collected, and debris was cleared by centrifugation. For Western blotting, proteins were resolved using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinyldiene membrane by electroblotting. Polyclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and phospho-specific (Promega) antibodies to ERKs were used according to the manufacturers' instructions. Immunostained proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (NEN Life Science Products). C-Fos and c-Jun antisera were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The c-Fos antibody is specific to p62 c-Fos and, according to the manufacturer, is not cross-reactive with other c-Fos family members. Polyvinylidene membranes were stripped by soaking for 30 min at 55 °C in a solution containing 62.5 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, and 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. For immunoprecipitation, JNK-1 was immunoprecipitated by adding JNK-1 antibody (0.5 μg; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 25 μl of protein G- and A-agarose beads. Samples were rotated gently for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed once in 1 ml of lysis buffer, twice in 1 ml of ice-cold wash buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm sodium vanadate, 5 mmbenzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and once in 0.5 ml of a kinase buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 20 mm MgCl2, 25 mmβ-glycerol phosphate, 100 μm sodium vanadate, 20 μm ATP, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction mixture (50 μl) contained the agarose beads suspended in kinase buffer, [γ-32P]ATP and substrate GST-ATF2 for JNK assay. Samples were subjected to kinase assay for 30 min at 30 °C with frequent mixing. After kinase assay the reaction was stopped with the addition of SDS loading buffer, then samples were boiled for 2 min, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and visualized by autoradiography. All of the experiments presented were conducted at least three times with equivalent results. The expression vector for Gal4 DNA binding domain c-Jun and the luciferase reporter containing 5 Gal4 DNA binding sites upstream of the E1B TATAA box and luciferase coding sequences have been described previously (13.Roberson M.S. Misra-Press A. Laurance M.E. Stork P.J. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3531-3539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MKK7 was a gift from Lynn Heasley (University of Colorado, Health Sciences Center), PAK1 was a gift from Melanie Cobb (University of Texas, Southwestern), and Cdc42N17 was a gift from Dr. Rick Cerione (Cornell University). All plasmids used in transfection studies were prepared by centrifugation through cesium chloride using standard methods. Prior to all studies, cells were split to fresh medium and cultured to approximately 60–70% confluence. Transient transfections were accomplished using the calcium phosphate method (Life Technologies, Inc.) for Gal4-c-Jun studies, as there was a requirement for adherent cells immediately after transfection. Overexpression of dominant negative molecules was accomplished by electroporation as described previously (13.Roberson M.S. Misra-Press A. Laurance M.E. Stork P.J. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3531-3539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, for transient transfection studies with dominant negative and kinase-defective molecules, cells were transfected by electroporation using a single electrical pulse at 220 V and 950 microfarads. Some transfected cells received the calcium chelator BAPTA-AM (20 μm) approximately 8 h after electroporation. Cells were collected by scraping 6 h after the final administration of inhibitors, lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles, and luciferase activity was determined as described (13.Roberson M.S. Misra-Press A. Laurance M.E. Stork P.J. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3531-3539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All whole cell recordings were made at room temperature with the whole cell perforated patch technique (14.Horn R. Marty A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 145-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). Whole cell recordings were performed 1–2 days after cells were plated. Patch-clamp recordings were done on cells that were not in contact with other cells and had no cell processes to avoid possible cell-cell coupling artifacts and to maintain good space clamp. Patch clamp electrodes were made with soft capillary glass and adjusted to obtain a tip resistance of approximately 2–4 megohms. Amphotericin B (Sigma) was added from a stock solution to obtain a final concentration of 200 μG/ml. Applying a 1-mV square pulse of 10 ms at 10 Hz monitored the electrode tip resistance. Once a high resistance seal (>5 gigohms) was formed between the recording pipette and the cell, the access resistance was monitored until it reached values less than 30 megohms. Capacitance was monitored before and after each experiment. All voltage clamp protocols were generated and currents recorded using an Axopatch 1-C amplifier and pClamp 5.51 acquisition system (Axon Instruments). The extracellular solution was exchanged continuously during recordings to add/wash out drugs. Bath perfusion was be performed by exchanging the content of the 35-mm culture dish with recording solutions at a rate of ∼2 ml/min using a gravity flow system. Drugs were added in the extracellular solution. For recording currents through VGCCs, barium was used as the charge carrier and the solutions were, in mm, external: 30 BaCl2, 109N-methyl-d-glucamine, 2.5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 Hepes, and 8 mm glucose (pH 7.2 with NaOH) and internal: 120 CsCl, 3 MgCl2, and 25 Hepes (pH 7.2 with CsOH). Currents were recorded from cells stepped for 90 ms from a holding potential of −60 mV to test potentials between −50 and +40 mV (10-mV increments). αT3-1 cells were treated with trypsin and resuspended in the standard physiological saline solution (see above) at a density of 106 cells/ml. Cells were loaded with 1 μm indo-1 acetoxymethyl ester (indo-1 AM, purchased from Molecular Probes, Junction City, OR) for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 0.1% bovine serum albumin. After loading, cells were washed and used within 2 h. 3-ml aliquots of cell suspension were placed in acrylic cuvettes and maintained at 37 °C with constant stirring. Indo-1 fluorescence at 405 nm was monitored with a Perkin-Elmer LS-5 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Indo-1 was excited at 355 nm for measurement of free ionized calcium. All of the experiments presented were conducted at least three times with equivalent results. αT3-1 cells were treated with multiple doses of buserelin, a specific GnRH receptor agonist, to determine the optimal dose of buserelin for activation of JNK (Fig.1 A). Cell lysates were collected and assayed for JNK activity via an immune complex kinase assay using GST-ATF2 as a substrate. For all subsequent experiments, buserelin was administered at 10 nm. The time course of JNK activation was examined by stimulating αT3-1 cells with buserelin for multiple time points ranging from 15 min to 2 h. Buserelin stimulated an increase in JNK activity by 15 min, which persisted for up to 1 h and was decreased by 2 h (Fig. 1 B). To provide evidence that GnRH receptor occupancy was required for JNK activation, the cells were pretreated with the specific GnRH receptor antagonist, antide. Antide was applied to αT3-1 cells 30 min before and during exposure to buserelin for 5, 15, or 30 min. Buserelin-induced JNK activity was blocked by antide (Fig.1 C), providing direct evidence that the observed buserelin-induced increase in JNK activity was GnRH receptor-mediated. Consistent with results observed in studies using αT3-1 cells, stimulation of rat pituitary cells in primary culture with buserelin for 0, 15, or 30 min induced a time-dependent increase in JNK activity (Fig. 1 D). This observation suggests that the αT3-1 cell model accurately reflects fully differentiated pituitary cells in primary culture. One reported signaling cascade leading to activation of JNK consists of Cdc42, PAK1, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase, and JNK kinase (MKK7) (3.Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F85-F104PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S.

To determine whether the buserelin signal to JNK involves these signaling molecules, αT3-1 cells were cotransfected with 1 μg of wild type JNK, 1 μg of wild type ERK2, and 5 μg of either dominant negative Cdc42 (Cdc42N17), truncated PAK1(1–231) molecule, or kinase-defective MKK7. Transfected cells were stimulated with buserelin for 0, 15, or 30 min, lysed, and divided for examination by kinase assay for JNK activity and by Western blot for ERK activation. Overexpression of either Cdc42 or PAK1 reduced buserelin-stimulated JNK activity but had no affect on activation of ERK (Fig. 2 A). Overexpression of dominant negative MKK7 also reduced buserelin-induced JNK activity, whereas ERK activation was not influenced (Fig. 2 B). Similar results were observed at higher doses of dominant negative or kinase-defective expression vectors (data not shown), suggesting that the doses used provided maximal responses. αT3-1 cells express multiple PKC isozymes, including PKC-α, -ε, and -ζ (11.Sundaresan S. Colin I.M. Pestell R.G. Jameson J.L. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 18.Roberson M.S. Zhang T. Li H.L. Mulvaney J.M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1310-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that activation of both GnRH-induced ERK and JNK in αT3-1 cells requires PKC (12.Reiss N. Llevi L.N. Shacham S. Harris D. Seger R. Naor Z. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1673-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 13.Roberson M.S. Misra-Press A. Laurance M.E. Stork P.J. Maurer R.A.

Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 815-824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Initial studies comparing the PKC requirement for buserelin-induced ERK and JNK activation were performed using the PKC inhibitor BIM 1 (GF 109203X) and its structurally related but functionally inactive negative control, BIM 5. Cells were pretreated for 30 min with control vehicle (Me2SO), 2 μm BIM 1, or 2 μmBIM 5 before buserelin application for 0, 15, or 30 min. After hormone treatment cells were lysed and analyzed for JNK activity by kinase assay or ERK activation by Western blot. As expected, buserelin-induced ERK activation was reduced in the presence of BIM 1 and essentially unaffected by treatment with BIM 5 (Fig.3 A). Surprisingly, both BIM 1 and the negative control BIM 5 reduced buserelin-induced JNK activity (Fig. 3 A). These results suggest that the reduction of JNK activity by the BIM drugs is likely not caused by PKC inhibition but by a nonspecific effect of the drugs. Therefore, contribution of PKC isozymes to JNK activation by GnRH was examined further by treating αT3-1 cells with 100 nm PMA for 16–20 h to deplete diacylglycerol-dependent PKC isozymes. Chronic treatment with PMA results in nearly a complete loss of detectable PKC-α and PKC-ε isozymes (18.Roberson M.S. Zhang T. Li H.L. Mulvaney J.M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1310-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Depletion of PKC isozymes in the current studies resulted in no obvious reduction in the magnitude of JNK activation at 15 and 30 min, whereas buserelin-induced activation of ERKs was blocked completely by PKC depletion at all time points (Fig. 3 B). Similar results were obtained after treatment with the PKC inhibitor staurosporine (Fig. 3 C) and H-89 at doses previously shown to inhibit PKC activity (20; data not shown). These results indicate that upstream effectors of ERK and JNK diverge at the level of PKC activity. PKC is absolutely required for ERK activation, whereas activation of JNK is not affected remarkably by pharmacological inhibition of PKC inhibition or depletion of isozymes after chronic administration of PMA. It has been shown that PMA increases the current flow through αT3-1 cell VGCCs at a magnitude similar to that of the current increase observed after GnRH treatment (21.Bosma M.M. Hille B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3411-3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). One likely scenario is that buserelin-stimulated PKC may mediate an increase in current flow through VGCCs (10.Mulvaney J.M. Zhang T. Fewtrell C. Roberson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29796-29804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) in αT3-1 cells, as has been described in other cells (22.Izumi S. Stojilkovic S.S. Iida T.

Romanin C. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We demonstrated in a recent report that treatment with the VGCC channel blocker nifedipine inhibits buserelin-induced activation of ERK but not JNK (10.Mulvaney J.M. Zhang T. Fewtrell C. Roberson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29796-29804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and in the current paper we present evidence indicating that buserelin-induced ERK but not JNK activation requires PKC activity. To gain additional insight into the role of PKC in buserelin-stimulated cells, we performed a direct examination of the buserelin-induced increase in current influx through VGCCs in the absence or presence of the PKC inhibitor staurosporine using the perforated patch method of whole cell recording (Fig. 3 D). Barium was used as the charge carrier, and the peak current was observed at −10 mV. The peak voltage-activated barium current in control cells was −62.9 ± 7.3 pA, whereas in the presence of 100 nm buserelin the peak current was −86.1 ± 6.8 pA (n = 10 cells). Our data are similar to results reported in a previous study examining GnRH-stimulated barium current through VGCCs using the standard method of whole cell recording (21.Bosma M.M. Hille B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3411-3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We report that buserelin induced an approximately 20–25% increase in the barium current through VGCCs. This increase was abolished completely in buserelin-stimulated αT3-1 cells pretreated for 30 min with 500 nm staurosporine (n = 4, Fig. 3 D). Data shown are from a representative cell. In addition, we have shown that ERK can be activated by the VGCC activator Bay K 8644 in control or PKC-depleted cells, suggesting that PKC action is upstream of calcium influx through VGCCs (10.Mulvaney J.M. Zhang T. Fewtrell C. Roberson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29796-29804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This evidence supports the hypothesis that PKC functions to mediate the buserelin-induced increase in calcium influx through VGCCs and provides additional insight into the mechanism by which the GnRH receptor is coupled to ERK, but not JNK, activation. Activation of the GnRH receptor results in IP3-mediated increases in intracellular calcium which have been shown to be the primary signal for exocytosis in αT3-1 cells and primary gonadotropes (7.Marian J. Conn P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 16: 196-201Google Scholar, 8.Naor Z. Capponi A.M. Rossier M.F. Ayalon D. Limor R. Mol.

Comparing litter-matched mice with control mice, we found that, in contrast to heterologous expression studies, the loss of γ1 significantly increased the amplitude of peak dihydropyridine-sensitive ICa in isolated myotubes. Whereas the activation kinetics of the current remained unchanged, inactivation of the current was slowed in γ1-deficient myotubes and, correspondingly, steady state inactivation of ICa was shifted to more positive membrane potentials.

Up to now, functional data on the γ1 subunit were only obtained in expression systems. Coexpression of γ1 with α1S, β1, and α2/δ-1 in Xenopus oocytes (12.Ren D. Hall L.M. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1996; 431: 461-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In these studies, coexpression of the γ1 subunit shifted the steady state inactivation of α1C-induced IBa to more negative membrane potentials, accelerated current activation and inactivation, and, in one study (17.Wei X.Y. Perez-Reyes E. Lacerda A.E. Schuster G. Brown A.M. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21943-21947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), increased peak currents. Considering the discrepancies obtained through coexpression of γ1 with either α1C or α1S and the considerable structural and functional diversity of α1S and α1C (1.Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Powell J.A. Numa S. Nature. 1988; 336: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 19.Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Adams B.A. Niidome T. Numa S. Nature. 1990; 346: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), it does not appear feasible to simply transfer the results obtained with α1C to the “correct” subunit α1S. To determine directly the role of the γ1 subunit in L-type channel activity in skeletal muscle in vivo, we therefore used gene targeting to inactivate the γ1 gene. In the absence of the γ1 subunit, peak Ca2+ current amplitudes in skeletal muscle myotubes were increased and the steady state inactivation was shifted to more positive potentials. These results demonstrate that a specific modulatory function of the skeletal muscle L-type Ca2+channel can be assigned to the γ1 subunit, which contributes to tissue-specific differences between high voltage activated L-type Ca2+ channels. γ1 DNA was isolated from a 129 SvJ murine genomic library (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO), and the structure of the murine γ1 gene has been characterized (9.Wissenbach U. Bosse-Doenecke E. Freise D. Ludwig A. Murakami M. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The replacement type targeting vector was constructed as follows. The multiple cloning site of the pBluescript-SK vector (Stratagene) was replaced by the multiple cloning sites 5′-CGC GCA ATC GAT TTG GAT CCA ACT CGA GAT CCA TGG CCG TCG ACG TGC GGC CGC AAC CGC GGA GCG CG-3′ (plasmid pCON1) and 5′-CGC GCA AGC GGC CGC AAG AGC TCC CGT CGA CCT GGT ACC TGA AGC TTA TCC GCG GAG CGC G-3′ (plasmid pCON2). To obtain the vector pKO3, the 5.1-kb1 BamHI/NcoI fragment, representing the 5′ non-translated region of the γ1 gene and nucleotides 1–73 encoding the initial 24 amino acid residues of γ1, and the 1.8-kbSalI/NotI fragment from pGEM7 (KJ1) (20.McBurney M.W. Sutherland L.C. Adra C.N. Leclair B. Rudnicki M.A. Jardine K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5755-5761Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) comprising the neomycin resistance gene, were subcloned in pCON1. The 3.75-kb SalI/Asp718 fragment containing intron sequence 3′ of exon 1 of the γ1 gene and the herpes simplex thymidine kinase cassette from pNTK (21.Mortensen R.M. Conner D.A. Chao S. Geisterfer L.A. Seidman J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2391-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) were subcloned in pCON2 to yield pKO5. The targeting vector pKOγ was obtained by subcloning the 5.9-kbNotI/SstII fragment from pKO5 into the pKO3 vector 3′ of the neomycin resistance gene. About 1.1 × 107 R1 embryonic stem (ES) cells (22.Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar) were electroporated with ClaI-linearized pKOγ (25 μg; setting of 800 V and 3 μF, Bio-Rad Gene Pulser) and plated on irradiated G418-resistant embryonic feeder cells (23.Fässler R. Meyer M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1896-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Recombinant clones were selected with G418 (0.5 mg/ml) and 1- (2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro-β-d-arabinofuranosyl-)-5-iodouracil (0.2 μm), and 11 out of 334 double-resistant colonies showed correct homologous recombination with the targeting vector as confirmed by screening with both the 5′- and 3′-probes. Germline chimeras were obtained by injecting mutant ES cells of the clone 212 into C57Bl/6 blastocysts and transferring the blastocysts into the uteri of pseudopregnant recipients. Chimeric mice were mated with C57Bl/6 females to test for germline transmission or with 129/SvJ females to obtain inbred lines carrying the mutated γ1 gene. For Southern blot analysis genomic DNA from ES cells or mouse tails (24.Laird P.W. Zijderveld A. Linders K. Rudnicki M.A. Jaenisch R. Berns A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar) were digested withEcoRV or SstI, respectively, electrophoresed on a 0,6% agarose gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N). Hybridizations were carried out with 32P-labeled 5′- and 3′-probes (Fig. 1 A) for 12 h at 62 °C as described (25.Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (7264) Google Scholar). After hybridizations, the blots were washed in 2× SSC, 1% (w/v) SDS for 15 min at 65 °C, followed by a second wash in 0.4× SSC, 1% (w/v) SDS at 65–70 °C for 30 min, and exposed to x-ray films at −80 °C for 2 days. A polymerase chain reaction-based assay was developed for rapid offspring genotyping using primer pairs to produce 370- and 570-bp fragments, representing the wild-type and the mutant allele, respectively. Northern blot analysis was carried out as described (26.Hullin R. Singer-Lahat D. Freichel M. Biel M. Dascal N. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) using a polymerase chain reaction-amplified 437-bp fragment consisting of the γ1 cDNA (9.Wissenbach U. Bosse-Doenecke E. Freise D. Ludwig A. Murakami M. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) 3′ of the deleted sequence of exon 1. Preparation of skeletal muscle microsomes and immunoblot analysis were performed as described (9.Wissenbach U. Bosse-Doenecke E. Freise D. Ludwig A. Murakami M. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Primary cultures of mouse skeletal myotubes were prepared essentially as described before (27.Beam K.G. Knudson C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 91: 781-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, after decapitation of neonatal mice and removal of skin from fore- and hindlimbs, muscles were minced (∼350 μm) using a McIlwain tissue chopper. The tissue was then digested at 37 °C for 30–40 min in Rodent Ringer solution (in mm): NaCl 146, KCl 5, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 1, glucose 11, HEPES 10, pH 7.4) with added 2 mg/ml collagenase I (Sigma). The tissue was pressed through a 177-μm mesh to remove clumps of tissue. After addition of an equal amount of Rodent Ringer solution, cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 200 × g for 10 min. Cells were resuspended in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma). To reduce the number of fibroblasts in the culture, cells were preplated for 1–1.5 h before finally plating them in 35-mm plastic Petri dishes (Falcon). The next day, the medium was replaced, and the following day, replaced by DMEM with 10% horse serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Myotubes were used between 4 and 9 days in vitro. Ca2+ currents were recorded with the whole-cell patch-clamp configuration of the patch-clamp technique (28.Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15119) Google Scholar) at room temperature. Patch pipettes were fabricated from Kimax-51 borosilicate glass (inner diameter, 1.5 mm; outer diameter, 1.8 mm). After heat-polishing, pipette resistances varied between 1.5 and 3 megohms with the solution used. For recording, cells were bathed in (in mm): tetra methylammonium-chloride 146, CaCl2 10, MgCl2 1, glucose 10, HEPES 10, adjusted to pH 7.4 with CsOH. The pipette solution contained (in mm): cesium aspartate 145, MgCl2 5, EGTA 20, Mg-ATP 5, HEPES 10, adjusted to pH 7.2 with CsOH. Currents were recorded with a EPC9 patch-clamp amplifier (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany), filtered at 1.5 kHz, and digitized at 5 kHz. A 10-mV liquid junction potential correction was applied to all voltages. Cell capacitance and series resistance were cancelled electronically prior to each pulse. To determine current-voltage (IV) relationships, Ca2+ currents were activated every 5 s by 200-ms step depolarization from a holding potential of −90 mV to potentials between −70 and +50 mV in 10-mV increments. L-type Ca2+ currents were measured at the end of each depolarizing pulse. For measuring steady state inactivation, the cell was depolarized for 5 s to potentials from −100 mV to 0 mV (20-mV increments) and subsequently to potentials from −40 mV and +15 mV (5-mV increments). Ca2+ current amplitude was then measured at the end of a 200-ms test pulse to +20 mV. For linear leak and capacitance subtraction, a P/4 protocol (leak holding potential −120 mV) was used in all measurements preceding the test pulse. Individual IV curves were fitted with a modified Boltzman equation of the form I = g max(V − E rev)/(1 + exp(−V −V ½)/k)) (29.Pearson H.A. Dolphin A.C. Pflügers Arch. 1993; 425: 518-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) withg max being the maximal whole-cell conductance,E rev the reversal potential,V ½ the voltage for half-maximal activation, and k the slope factor. For comparison of the activation kinetics of the L-type Ca2+ channel current in γ1+/+ cells and γ1−/− cells, current traces at a depolarization of +20 mV were averaged and fitted with a double exponential (normalized to the beginning of the test pulse). To compare steady state inactivation of γ1+/+ cells and γ1−/− cells, current amplitudes at the end of the 20-mV test pulse were normalized to the current at the end of the 20-mV test pulse following the prepulse to −100 mV. The data were fitted with a Boltzman equation of the formI/I max = 1/(1 + exp((V −V ½)/k), withV ½ being the voltage of half-inactivation and k a measure for the steepness. In some experiments, cells were depolarized to +20 mV for 350 ms every 5 s. After a control recording of approximately 60–80 s when the current had reached a steady amplitude, (−)-BayK 8644 (1, 3, 5, or 5.6 μm) (a gift from Bayer, Germany, or purchased from RBI) was added into the bath to stimulate the L-type Ca2+channels. Currents were analyzed at the end of the pulse. Cell-attached single-channel recordings were carried out to compare the single-channel conductance of L-type Ca2+ channels in wild-type and γ1-deficient cells. For cell-attached single-channel recordings, the pipette resistance varied between 4 and 8 megohms. The pipette solution contained (in mm): barium acetate 90, TEA-acetate 30, HEPES 10, tetrodotoxin 0.001, adjusted to pH 7.4 with BaOH. The membrane potential was zeroed using a bath solution containing (in mm): potassium aspartate 140, MgCl2 1, EGTA 10, HEPES 10, adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH. 1 μm (−)-BayK 8644 was included in the bath solution in order to prolong the L-type channel open time. To obtain the single-channel conductance, Ca2+ channels were activated by voltage ramps from −100 mV to +100 mV and returned to −100 mV at a rate of 1 mV/ms before returning to the holding potential (−90 mV or −40 mV). Patches were depolarized every 5 s. Current traces were filtered off-line at 1 kHz before leak subtraction in IGOR Pro, WaveMetrics, Inc. Leak subtraction was carried out by fitting a polynomial to a blank sweep or averaging several blank sweeps, which were then subtracted from the sweep containing channel activity. A linear fit for the prolonged channel openings was used to obtain the single-channel conductance. Hindlimb muscles were dissected from wild-type and mutant mice, immediately homogenized in 20 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm phenanthroline, 1 mm iodoacetamide, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μm pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml antipain, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin (protease inhibitor mix) and centrifuged at 6000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was rehomogenized in the same buffer and centrifuged twice. The combined supernatants were then centrifuged at 42,000 ×g for 40 min at 4 °C. The pellet containing microsomal membranes was rehomogenized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, containing the protease inhibitor mix and used for equilibrium binding of (+)[3H]isradipine ((+)-[methyl-3H]PN 200-110, 82 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Assays were performed in duplicate using microsomal membranes obtained from two independent preparations for both muscle from wild-type mice and and γ1−/− mice, respectively. Microsomes (15–23 μg of microsomal protein) were incubated in 250 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2 in the presence of 0.035–9.81 nm [3H]isradipine and in the presence or absence of 1 μm (±)-isradipine. Incubation was stopped after 90 min at 4 °C by the addition of 3 ml of ice-cold solution A (8.5% (mass/volume) polyethylene glycol 6000, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). The suspension was immediately poured on GF/C filters. After washing twice with solution A, the filter was subjected to liquid scintillation counting. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA method (Pierce). One allele of the γ1 gene was mutated by replacing the 3′-part of its first translated exon and the adjacent splice donor site (Fig. 1 A) with the neomycin resistance gene (neor) in murine embryonic stem cells. Chimeric males were obtained that transmitted the mutant allele to their progeny. These heterozygous F1 offspring were intercrossed to produce F2 homozygous γ1−/− mice, as confirmed by Southern blot analysis of tail DNA (Fig. 1 B). The mutation was transmitted at Mendelian ratio, suggesting normal fetal and embryonic development of homozygous mutant mice. γ1−/− mice grew and reproduced normally and were indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates. The deletion of the γ1 gene and the lack of expression was confirmed by Northern and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1,C and D). No transcripts could be detected in poly(A)+ RNA prepared from γ1−/− skeletal muscle using as probes either the mouse γ1 cDNA covering the translated exons 2, 3, and 4 (Fig. 1 C) or the 160-bp fragment of exon 1 which has been replaced by neor (data not shown). Using polymerase chain reactions, γ1 transcripts encoding the complete γ1 protein could be amplified from γ1+/+ and γ1+/− poly(A)+ RNA but not from poly(A)+ RNA isolated from γ1−/− skeletal muscle. In addition, the DNA fragments encoding exon 2 or exons 3 and 4 could be amplified from γ1+/+ and γ1+/− poly(A)+ RNA but not from γ1−/− poly(A)+RNA (data not shown), indicating that the replacement of part of exon 1 and of the adjacent intron completely prevents expression of γ1-specific transcripts. Accordingly, the γ1 protein (∼32 kDa) is recognized by a γ1 subunit-specific polyclonal antibody (9.Wissenbach U. Bosse-Doenecke E. Freise D. Ludwig A. Murakami M. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) in skeletal muscle microsomes prepared from γ1+/+ mice and γ1+/− mice but not in microsomes prepared from γ1−/− mice (Fig.1 D). No transcripts of the neuronal γ2 subunit (10.Letts V.A. Felix R. Biddlecome G.H. Arikkath J. Mahaffey C.L. Velanzuela A. Bartlett F.S. Mori Y. Campbell K.P. Frankel W.N. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 340-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) could be detected in skeletal muscle RNA from wild-type or γ1-deficient mice. To study the function of the γ1 subunit in skeletal muscle, primary cultures were obtained from fore- and hindlimb muscles of 1–3-day-old wild-type and γ1−/− litter-matched mice. Both γ1+/+ and γ1−/− myotubes exhibited spontaneous contractions after day 4 in culture and were used for electrophysiological recordings up to 9 days. Fig. 2 shows representative recordings of Ca2+ channel activity at different test potentials from γ1+/+ and γ1−/− myotubes of litter-matched mice. At positive test potentials, a large sustained L-type inward Ca2+ current was observed in γ1+/+ and γ1−/− cells (Fig. 2 A). In all cells, the activation threshold was around −20 mV and the peak amplitude of the current was at +20 mV (Fig.2 B). In addition to L-type currents, additional transient Ca2+ currents at test potential >−60 mV (present at −20 mV in Fig. 2 A, right panel) were observed representing T-type Ca2+ channels (27.Beam K.G. Knudson C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 91: 781-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This channel type was not consistently observed in all cells but, when present, was not obviously altered by the γ1 subunit deletion (data not shown). The peak whole-cell current through L-type Ca2+channels was found to be significantly larger in γ1−/− cells compared with γ1+/+ cells, as evident from the representative examples and the averaged current-voltage (IV) relationship (Fig. 2,A and B). Individual IV curves were fitted with a Boltzman equation, resulting in a significantly different whole-cell conductance g of 0.45 ± 0.07 nS/pF for γ1−/− cells compared with 0.37 ± 0.05 nS/pF for γ1+/+ cells (n = 11, p < 0.05). This effect is not due to a difference of cell cultivation length, as γ1+/+ and γ1−/− myotubes were prepared on the same day and measured in a paired fashion. Furthermore, expression of L-type Ca2+currents did not vary between days 5 and 9 in γ1-deficient or wild-type cells (data not shown). To look for differences between γ1+/+ and γ1−/− myotubes concerning selectivity, gating properties, and activation kinetics of L-type Ca2+channels, we analyzed the experiments in more detail. The apparent reversal potential E rev (65.7 ± 2.2 mV for γ1+/+ and 66.3 ± 1.8 mV for γ1−/−) as well as the half-maximal voltage for activation V ½(8 ± 1 mV for γ1+/+ and 7 ± 1 mV for γ1−/−) and the slope factor for activation k (5.8 ± 0.4 mV for γ1+/+ and 6.2 ± 0.3 mV for γ1−/−) remained unchanged. Activation kinetics of the L-type Ca2+ current were also not altered by the elimination of the γ1 subunit as shown in Fig.2 C. Depicted are averaged (n = 11 for γ1+/+ and n = 13 for γ1−/−), normalized current traces (test pulse to +20 mV) from γ1-deficient and wild-type mice fitted with a double exponential function (time constants of 67.9 and 4.2 ms for γ1+/+ and 58.1 and 5.7 ms for γ1−/−). Together, these measurements indicate that Ca2+ selectivity, gating, and activation kinetics of L-type Ca2+ channels in skeletal muscle are not significantly influenced by the γ1 subunit. The increased L-type Ca2+ current amplitude can in principle be explained in one of three ways. 1) The single-channel conductance is increased. 2) The open probability is increased. 3) The number of functional Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane is increased. Because the open probability of skeletal muscle L-type Ca2+ channels is rather low and open times can be extremely short, we used the calcium channel agonist (−)-BayK 8644 to increase open times of the channels. (−)-BayK 8644 (at 1 μm) did increase the peak current amplitude of L-type currents at +20 mV by 64% in both γ1+/+ and γ1−/− myotubes (γ1+/+: from −13.4 ± 1.6 to −22.9 ± 2.3 pA/pF, n = 9; γ1−/−: from −22.1 ± 2.1 to −39.6 ± 4.7 pA/pF, n = 9), indicating a comparable sensitivity of native and γ1-deficient skeletal calcium channels toward dihydropyridines. The effect of (−)-BayK 8644 was already saturated at this concentration, as higher concentrations (between 3 and 5.6 μm) did not increase the peak current any further in either γ1+/+ or γ1−/− myotubes (n= 22). Thus, the relative difference of current amplitude of L-type channels between γ1+/+ and γ1−/− myotubes was not changed by application of (−)-BayK 8644. Therefore, we were able to compare single-channel properties in the presence of (−)-BayK 8644. To measure single-channel conductances, a voltage ramp protocol as shown in Fig.3 A was used. Typical examples of current responses from γ1+/+ and γ1−/− myotubes with no single-channel activity and with channel activity are overlaid in Fig.3 B. Subtracting blank traces from a trace with channel activity, we could fit a line to the current traces shown in Fig.3 C to get the single-channel conductance of each experiment. On average, there was no significant difference between recordings form γ1+/+ and γ1−/− cells (γ1+/+: 13.0 ± 0.8 pS,n = 4; γ1−/−: 12.3 ± 0.3 pS,n = 3). These values are very similar to the ones (14.5 pS) from a previous study measured under slightly different conditions (30.Dirksen R.T. Beam K.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 227-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Next, we tested whether a difference in the amount of α1S protein in γ1+/+ and γ1−/− skeletal muscle might be responsible for the difference in current densities by binding studies using the dihydropyridine isradipine as a ligand. However, the densities of isradipine binding sites were not significantly different in γ1+/+ and γ1−/− muscles (γ1+/+: B max, 1150 ± 192 fmol/mg protein; KD , 0.53 ± 0.04 nm; n = 3; γ1−/−:B max, 1236 ± 175 fmol/mg protein;KD , 0.51 ± 0.02 nm;n = 3), implicating that no significant differences in the amount of functional α1S protein exist. Because both single-channel conductance and amount of α1S protein do not account for the difference in current densities, we conclude that loss of the γ1 subunit increases the open probability of L-type Ca2+ channels in skeletal muscle. To compare inactivation kinetics of L-type Ca2+ channels, long depolarizations to test potentials between −20 and +20 mV were applied to wild-type and γ1-deficient cells. In the absence of the γ1 subunit, L-type Ca2+ currents inactivated more slowly than in wild-type myotubes from litter-matched control mice, as illustrated by the representative current traces in Fig.4 A. At the end of the 5-s depolarization to −5 mV, 60.0 ± 5.8% of the current was inactivated in wild-type cells (n = 11)"
https://openalex.org/W2154773687,"Eukaryotic replication factor C (RF-C) is a heteropentameric complex that is required to load the replication clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen onto primed DNA. Saccharomyces cerevisiae RF-C is encoded by the genes RFC1–RFC5. The RFC1 gene was cloned under control of the strong inducible bacteriophage T7 promoter, yet induction did not yield detectable Rfc1p. However, a truncated form of RFC1 deleted for the coding region for amino acids 3–273, rfc1-ΔN, did allow overproduction. The other four RFC genes were cloned into the latter plasmid to yield a single plasmid that overproduced RF-C to moderate levels. Overproduction of the complex was further enhanced when the Escherichia coli argU gene encoding the rare arginine tRNA was also overproduced. The enzyme thus produced in E. coli was purified to homogeneity through three column steps, including a proliferating cell nuclear antigen affinity column. This enzyme, as well as the enzyme purified from yeast, is prone to aggregation and inactivation, and therefore, light scattering was used to determine conditions stabilizing the enzyme and preventing aggregation. Broad-range carrier ampholytes at about 0.05% were found to be most effective. In some assays, the Rfc1-ΔN containing RF-C from E. coli showed an increased activity compared with the full-length enzyme from yeast, likely because the latter enzyme exhibits significant nonspecific binding to single-stranded DNA. Replacement of RFC1 byrfc1-ΔN in yeast shows essentially no phenotype with regard to DNA replication, damage susceptibility, telomere length maintenance, and intrachromosomal recombination.

However, a truncated form of RFC1 deleted for the coding region for amino acids 3–273, rfc1-ΔN, did allow overproduction. The other four RFC genes were cloned into the latter plasmid to yield a single plasmid that overproduced RF-C to moderate levels. Overproduction of the complex was further enhanced when the Escherichia coli argU gene encoding the rare arginine tRNA was also overproduced. The enzyme thus produced in E. coli was purified to homogeneity through three column steps, including a proliferating cell nuclear antigen affinity column. This enzyme, as well as the enzyme purified from yeast, is prone to aggregation and inactivation, and therefore, light scattering was used to determine conditions stabilizing the enzyme and preventing aggregation. Broad-range carrier ampholytes at about 0.05% were found to be most effective. In some assays, the Rfc1-ΔN containing RF-C from E. coli showed an increased activity compared with the full-length enzyme from yeast, likely because the latter enzyme exhibits significant nonspecific binding to single-stranded DNA. Replacement of RFC1 byrfc1-ΔN in yeast shows essentially no phenotype with regard to DNA replication, damage susceptibility, telomere length maintenance, and intrachromosomal recombination. single-stranded single-stranded binding protein DNA polymerase δ proliferating cell nuclear antigen replication factor C RF-C with the rfc1-ΔNp subunit 2′-deoxyadenyl-5′-yl imidodiphosphate methylmethane sulfonate kilobase pair polymerase chain reaction N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine 2′-deoxyadeny-5′-yl-imidodiphosphate adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) DNA replication in eukaryotes is a complex process involving a large number of proteins. In yeast, processive DNA synthesis is performed by DNA polymerase δ (Pol δ)1 and DNA polymerase ε. Two accessory factors are also required for processivity, the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and replication factor C (RF-C) (1.Prelich G. Tan C.K. Kostura M. Mathews M.B. So A.G.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It functions by encircling the DNA and interacting with Pol δ or Pol ε to maintain highly processive DNA replication (4.Krishna T.S. Kong X.-P. Gary S. Burgers P.M. Kuriyan J.

PCNA also interacts with several other replication and repair proteins, including the replication inhibitor p21, the flap-specific endonuclease FEN-1, and DNA ligase 1 (reviewed in Ref. 8.Kelman Z. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). RF-C is a multisubunit complex that binds preferentially to the 3′-end of template-primer junctions and is essential for loading PCNA onto DNA (9.Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1023-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). RF-C has an associated single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity that is stimulated by the presence of primer termini and PCNA (9.Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1023-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 10.Yoder B.L. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22689-22697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Fien K. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which RF-C loads PCNA onto DNA is not well understood. RF-C may recognize and bind to template-primer junctions and subsequently load PCNA in an ATP-dependent manner (12.Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1950-1960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, RF-C may form an ATP-dependent complex with PCNA, open the trimeric ring, and, upon binding a template-primer junction, close the ring around the DNA with hydrolysis of ATP (13.Gerik K.J. Gary S.L. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1256-1262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Yeast RF-C consists of a large subunit with a molecular mass of 95 kDa and four smaller subunits of 36–40 kDa (10.Yoder B.L. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22689-22697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Fien K. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The genes encoding all five subunits have been cloned, and all are essential (14.Li X. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21880-21884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Li X.

All five subunits show sequence similarity to each other, and in fact, the sequences of all Rfc subunits are conserved among eukarya. This homology is localized in seven regions known as RF-C boxes II–VIII (Fig. 1 A) (reviewed in Ref. 18.Cullmann G. Fien K. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4661-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). RF-C boxes III and V contain sequences that show homology to nucleotide-binding proteins (20.Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4234) Google Scholar). RFC1 contains an additional box (I) in the N-terminal region that shows homology to prokaryotic DNA ligases and poly(ADP)-ribose polymerases (21.Bunz F. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11014-11018Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The role of the other RF-C boxes is unknown. The C termini of all five subunits are unique and are required for complex formation (22.Uhlmann F. Gibbs E. Cai J. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10065-10071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 23.Uhlmann F. Cai J. Gibbs E. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10058-10064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Deletion studies with human Rfc1 (p140) have identified at least two DNA-binding domains, one in an N-terminal domain of the protein (amino acids 369–480, analogous to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rfc1p amino acids 150–230) that contains the ligase homology box I and one broadly mapped to the C-terminal half of the protein between homology box IV and the C terminus (Fig. 1 A) (23.Uhlmann F. Cai J. Gibbs E. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10058-10064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 24.Fotedar R. Mossi R. Fitzgerald P. Rousselle T. Maga G. Brickner H. Messier H. Kasibhatla S. Hubscher U. Fotedar A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4423-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Although binding to double-stranded DNA by the C-terminal domain is much weaker than that by the N-terminal domain, only the C-terminal activity is required for RF-C function in vitro. In fact, deletion of the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–555, approximately analogous toS. cerevisiae amino acids 1–275) results in a human RF-C preparation with increased replication activity, indicating an inhibitory contribution of the N-terminal domain, perhaps by nonspecific binding to non-template-primer junctions (23.Uhlmann F. Cai J. Gibbs E. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10058-10064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 25.Podust V.N. Tiwari N. Stephan S. Fanning E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31992-31999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The role of the N-terminal domain remains unclear. Substrate specificity binding studies with human Rfc1(1–555) show that this domain preferentially binds to partially double-stranded DNA substrates in which at least one of the 5′-ends is phosphorylated and the phosphate is either recessed or at a blunt end, suggesting functional significance of this domain in Okazaki fragment maturation or at DNA ends (26.Allen B.L. Uhlmann F. Gaur L.K. Mulder B.A. Posey K.L. Jones L.B. Hardin S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3877-3882Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Human Rfc1 shows a significant binding preference to 5′-phosphorylated double-stranded human telomeric repeat DNA, and a deletion analysis implicates homology domain I in this activity, again suggesting the possible importance of this domain for DNA end metabolism (27.Uchiumi F. Watanabe M. Tanuma S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 482-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the overexpression in Escherichia coli of yeast RF-C lacking the ligase homology domain of Rfc1p. Optimization of the overproduction conditions allowed us to obtain, after purification, 1 mg of pure RF-C from 1 liter of cells, as well as 5 mg of the four-subunit Rfc2–5p subcomplex lacking the large subunit. In addition, we have analyzed the phenotype of a yeast mutant carrying the truncated RFC1 gene as the only source ofRFC1. Our in vitro data are in agreement with those obtained by others for human RF-C, but, surprisingly, no significant DNA metabolic defect could be ascribed to the lack of the ligase homology domain in vivo. Wild-type RF-C and Pol δ were purified from yeast overproduction strains, and PCNA and replication protein A were purified from E. coli overproduction strains as described (13.Gerik K.J. Gary S.L.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4420-4429Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). E. coli SSB was a gift from Dr. T. Lohman of this department. All other enzymes and oligonucleotides were obtained commercially. Single-stranded mp18 DNA was singly primed with a synthetic 36-mer (position 6330–6294). Plasmid pSBETa (pA15-ori, kanR, ArgU) was a gift from Dr. Hans-Henning Steinbiss (30.Schenk P.M. Baumann S. Mattes R. Steinbiss H.H. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 196-198PubMed Google Scholar). dAMP-PNP was a gift from Dr. Bruce Alberts. The proper sequences of all plasmids obtained by ligation of PCR products or synthetic oligonucleotides were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Plasmid pBL472 (colE1-ori, AmpR, T7-RFC2, T7-RFC3, T7-RFC4,T7-RFC5) was assembled from four plasmids (pBL456, pBL555, pBL565, and pBL609), each of which has a small RFC gene cloned into expression vector pPY55 (colE1-ori, AmpR, T7 promoter-leader sequence cassette) in such a way that the native amino acid sequence was maintained and the methionine was optimally located behind a cassette containing a tandem repeat of the bacteriophage T7 gene 10 promoter followed by a single copy of the gene 10 ribosome binding site and leader sequence. All four RFC genes in pBL472 are arranged in a counterclockwise orientation and have retained the T7 expression cassette. pBL456 (pPY55, T7-RFC3), pBL555 (pPY55, T7-RFC4), and pBL609 (pPY55, T7-RFC5) have been described (14.Li X. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21880-21884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Li X. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 868-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 19.Gary S.L. Burgers P.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4986-4991Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The RFC2 gene was amplified with primers RFC2-1 (CCTTGACATGTTTGAAGGGTTTGGTCC) and RFC2-2 (GGGAAGCTTGTATATTAGAGTTGGGATATT), which introduce an AflIII site at the initiating methionine and a HindIII site at the stop codon, respectively. The PCR product was digested withAflIII and HindIII and ligated into vector pPY55, in which the single AflIII site in a nonessential region had previously been destroyed by filling in and digested withNcoI and HindIII to give pBL565 (pPY55, T7-RFC2). A 0.38-kb fragment of the RFC1 gene was amplified with primers RFC1-1 (GAGACCATGGTCAATATTTCTGATTTC), which introduces aNcoI site at the initiating methionine, and RFC1-2 (GAACACCTGTGAAGACAATTGTTAG) just past an internal BamHI site in the RFC1 gene. The PCR product was made blunt-ended with DNA polymerase I, Klenow fragment plus dNTPs, digested withNcoI, and ligated into vector pPY55 that had been digested with ClaI, filled in with DNA polymerase I, Klenow fragment plus dNTPs and then digested with NcoI. The resulting plasmid was cut with AatII, filled in with DNA polymerase I, Klenow fragment plus dNTPs, and then digested with BamHI, and the remaining portion of the RFC1 gene was ligated in as a BamHI to filled-in XhoI fragment obtained from plasmid pBL411 to give plasmid pBL614 (pPY55 colE1-ori, AmpR, T7-RFC 1) (13.Gerik K.J. Gary S.L. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1256-1262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To obtain an expression plasmid with a truncated RFC1 gene, pBL614 was digested withNcoI and HinDIII, and the linear fragment was isolated. A double-stranded oligonucleotide made by hybridization of oligonucleotides CATGGTGCATCATCACCATCACCACCATA and AGCTTATGGTGGTGATGGTGATGATGCAC was ligated into the linearized vector. The resulting plasmid, pBL480 (pPY55 colE1-ori, AmpR, T7-RFC1-ΔN) contains a deletion of residues 3–273 ofRFC1 and an addition of seven histidines between amino acids 2 and 274. Plasmid pBL472 was digested with HinDIII andPvuII and treated with DNA polymerase I, Klenow fragment plus dNTPs, and the resulting fragment containing the four smallRFC genes was ligated into plasmid pBL480 digested withSmaI. The resulting plasmid, pBL481, contains all fiveRFC genes in a counterclockwise orientation, each under the control of the T7 cassette (Fig. 1 B). Plasmids pBL641 (pRS316, RFC1, URA3) and pBL642 (pRS314, RFC1, TRP1) are complementing centromere plasmids containing the entire RFC1 sequence (31.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pBL642-2 (pRS314, RFC1, TRP1) was created using site directed mutagenesis in order to introduce a NcoI restriction site at the N terminus of RFC1. This mutation did not alter the amino acid sequence of the RFC1 gene. Plasmid pBL642-3 (pRS314, RFC-1ΔN,TRP1) was constructed by replacing the 1.5-kbNcoI-BglII RFC1 fragment in pBL642-2 with the 0.8-kb NcoI-BglII truncatedRFC1 fragment from plasmid pBL480. This swap deletes residues 3–273 and adds seven histidine residues between amino acids 2 and 274. The E. coli strain used for general cloning purposes was DH5α, whereas BL21(DE3) was used for overproduction studies. Diploid yeast strain W303 (MATa/MATα ade2-1/ade2-1 ura3-1/ura3-1 his3-11/his3-11 trp1-1/trp1-1 leu2-3,112/leu2-3,112 can1-100/can1-100) was used for the genetic studies withRFC1. The entire RFC1 gene was disrupted by transformation of strain W303 with a PCR-generated fragment spanning from ∼500 nucleotides upstream to ∼500 nucleotides downstream of the RFC1 gene and in which the entire RFC1 coding sequence was replaced by the KanMX6 resistance marker (32.Wach A. Yeast. 1996; 12: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). G418 resistant transformants were examined by PCR to verify disruption of the RFC1 gene in one of the two RFC1 alleles. The G418 resistant cells were transformed with plasmid pBL641 (pRS316,RFC1, URA3) and sporulated. Haploid progeny carrying the disruption of the RFC1 gene and complementing plasmid pBL641 were identified by standard genetic techniques and PCR analysis. Strain PY171 (MATarfc1-Δ::KanMX6 ade2-1 ura3-1 his3-11 trp1-1 leu2-3,112 can1-100 + pBL641 (pRS316, RFC1,URA3)) was transformed with the pBL642 series of plasmids, and transformants that had lost pBL641 were identified by growth on 5-fluoroorotic acid medium to give strain PY173-X (MATarfc1-Δ::KanMX6 ade2-1 ura3-1 his3-11 trp1-1 leu2-3,112 can1-100 + pBL642-x (pRS314, rfc1-x,TRP1)). Standard media were used (33.Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). YPDA is YPD plus 20 μg/ml of adenine. DNA damage sensitivity measurements were carried out on YPDA solid media to which was added, after autoclaving, 0.05% of methylmethane sulfonate (MMS) or 110 mm hydroxyurea. Strains PY173 and PY173-X were transformed with HpaI-cut pRS305-URA3 (Bluescript LEU2 URA3) to target integration in the LEU2 locus (34.Eissenberg J.C. Ayyagari R. Gomes X.V. Burgers P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6367-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determineURA3 pop-out frequencies, a fluctuation analysis was carried. Two transformants of each strain were grown to saturation in complete minimal SC medium, diluted in SC to 100 cells/ml, divided into 10 cultures for each transformant, and grown for 3 days to saturation. 4 × 106 cells were plated on SC medium plus 5-fluoroorotic acid to score for URA3 pop-outs. Median values were obtained and averaged over the two independent transformants of each strain. Frequencies were corrected for residual growth on the selection plates. The telomere analysis was performed essentially as described (35.Adams A.K. Holm C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4614-4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Colonies from two successive 5-fluoroorotic acid selection plates, as described above, were diluted in YPDA medium and grown to saturation at 30 °C. This corresponds to approximately 30 generations of cell growth of the RFC1mutants. Successive 1000-fold dilutions in YPDA and growth to saturation corresponded to additional steps of 10 generations each. Genomic DNA was isolated from cultures after 30, 70, and 120 generations of growth, digested with XhoI, and subjected to Southern blot analysis. The probe was a XhoI-SalI fragment from plasmid pJH345 (a gift of Michael McAlear), which contains a telomere-associated Y′ sequence and ∼300 nucleotides of poly(G1–3T) sequences. HEG buffer contains 30 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 5 μm pepstatin A, 5 μm leupeptin, and 0.5 mm p-methylphenylsulfonyl fluoride. Where indicated, the buffer was supplemented with 7 mm magnesium acetate and 1 mm ATP. Added NaCl is indicated in mm with a subscript, e.g. buffer HEG200 contains 200 mm NaCl. Ampholytes 3.5–9 (0.05%) are added to all steps after the PCNA-agarose column, and p-methylphenylsulfonyl fluoride was omitted from the MonoS step. Plasmid pBL481 was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells and selected on LB + Amp plates. If the strain also contained pSBETa, selection was on LB+Amp+Kan plates. A few colonies were used to inoculate a 50-ml culture of “terrific” broth (containing, per liter, 12 g of tryptone, 24 g of yeast extract, 0.4% glycerol, and 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, and required antibiotics at 50 μg/ml). Standard media were used for yeast genetics and grown for 8–10 h at 24 °C with vigorous shaking (300 rpm). A 5–10-ml inoculum was used to inoculate 1 liter of terrific broth (A 600 = 0.01), and the flask was incubated overnight at 24 °C with vigorous shaking (300 rpm) toA 600 = 2. The cells were then induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and shaking was continued for an additional 4–6 h. The cells were harvested and resuspended in 10 ml of HEG200 buffer and stored frozen at –70 °C. All steps were carried out at 0–4 °C unless indicated otherwise. The thawed cells were lysed by sonication, polymin P was added to 0.5% to precipitate nucleic acids, and after stirring for 5 min, cell debris and the precipitate were removed by centrifugation at 18,000 rpm for 30 min. Ammonium sulfate (0.28 g/ml) was added to the supernatant, and after 30 min, the precipitated proteins were collected at 38,000 rpm for 60 min and resuspended in 10 ml of HEG buffer. The fraction was then dialyzed against HEG buffer to a conductance of HEG100 and loaded onto a 10-ml S-Sepharose column equilibrated in HEG100. The column was washed subsequently with 30 ml of HEG200, and eluted with a 75-ml linear gradient of HEG200–HEG600, followed by a 10-ml wash with HEG1000. The four-subunit Rfc2–5p complex elutes at ∼HEG250, and RF-C-1ΔN elutes at ∼HEG400. Further purification was only carried out with complexes overproduced in pSBETa-containing cells. ATP and magnesium acetate were added to RF-C containing fractions to final concentrations of 1 and 7 mm, respectively, and the fraction was diluted with HEG buffer to a conductance of HEG200 and loaded onto a 15-ml PCNA-agarose column equilibrated in buffer HEG200. The column was washed with 30 ml of buffer HEG300 containing magnesium acetate-ATP, and the bound proteins were eluted with HEG300 buffer containing 3 mm EDTA. To fractions containing RF-C-1ΔN, ampholytes 3.5–9 were added to a final concentration of 0.05%. The RF-C-1ΔN containing fractions were diluted with HEG buffer containing 0.05% ampholytes to a conductance of HEG150 and injected onto a 1-ml Mono S column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in HEG150, washed with 5 ml of HEG150 buffer, and eluted with a 10-ml linear gradient from 150 to 600 mm NaCl in HEG buffer containing 0.05% ampholytes. RF-C-1ΔN eluted at ∼350 mm NaCl. The yield of RF-C was ∼0.8 mg/liter of culture. The Rfc2–5 complex from the S-Sepharose column was dialyzed against HEG buffer to a conductivity of HEG100 and loaded onto a 1-ml MonoQ column. The column was washed with 3 ml of HEG100 and eluted by a 10-ml gradient of HEG200-HEG500. Rfc2–5p eluted at ∼150 mm NaCl. The RF-C subcomplex containing fractions were diluted 2-fold with HEG buffer and loaded onto a 1-ml MonoS column. The column was washed with 3 ml of HEG100 and eluted by a 10-ml gradient of HEG100–HEG500. The Rfc2–5 complex eluted at ∼250 mm NaCl. The yield of Rfc2-5 was ∼5 mg/liter of culture. A 16 cm × 20 cm × 0.75 mm, 7.5% acrylamide, 0.25% bisacrylamide, 0.1% SDS gel was cast containing 0.16%N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED). The gel was run in the cold room with prechilled buffer at 25 mA constant current until the dye front had progressed 23 of the way through the stacking gel. The current was then increased to 50 mA until the dye front had entered the resolving gel by 1–2 cm. At this time, the gel was run at a constant voltage of 260–300 V. Standard 30-μl replication assays contained 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8; 8 mmmagnesium acetate; 50 mm NaCl; 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin; 1 mm dithiothreitol; 100 μm each of dATP, dCTP, and dGTP; 25 μm [3H]dTTP (100 cpm/pmol dNTP); 1 mm ATP; 100 ng of singly primed single-stranded mp18 DNA (0.04 pmol of circles); 0.85 μg of E. coli SSB or 0.6 μg of yeast replication protein A; 100 ng of PCNA (1.1 pmol of trimers); 25 ng of Pol δ (0.05 pmol); and RF-C as indicated. Incubations were at 37 °C for 4 min, and acid-precipitable radioactivity was determined. In some assays dNTP-PNPs replaced dNTPs, meaning that 100 μm dAMP-PNP replaced dATP in an otherwise identical assay. [α-32P]dTTP (1000 cpm/pmol nucleotide) replaced [3H]dTTP when products were analyzed by alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis. After electrophoresis, the gel was neutralized, dried, and exposed to film for autoradiography or exposed to a phosphor screen for phosphor imaging and quantitation. Replication of poly(dA) with an average chain length of 300 nucleotides was carried out in a 30-μl assay in the same buffer system containing 200 ng of poly(dA)-(dT)22 (40:1 nucleotide ratio; 1.7 pmol of template molecules and 0.7 pmol of primers) with 40 μm[3H]dTTP, 1 mm ATP, 50 mm NaCl, 1.3 μg of SSB, 2.2 pmol of PCNA, 0.1 pmol of Pol δ, and RF-C as indicated. Incubations were at 30 °C for 8 min, and the reactions were processed as described above. Complexes were formed in a 60-μl reaction containing 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 8 mm MgAc2, 50 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.65 μg of singly primed SS mp18 DNA (0.7 pmol of circles), 14 μg of E. coli SSB, 0.5 mm ATP, 100 μm each dCTP and dGTP, 10 pmol of PCNA, 2 pmol of RF-C or RF-C-1ΔN, and 1 pmol of Pol δ. The SSB-coated DNA was incubated with PCNA and RF-C or RF-C-1ΔN in the assay mix for 30 s at 30 °C, Pol δ was added, and the reaction was incubated further for 30 s. The reaction was then cooled on ice and filtered through a 2-ml Biogel A-5m (Bio-Rad) column, equilibrated in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 8 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm NaCl, and 25 μm dCTP and dGTP. Three drop fractions were collected. DNA predominantly eluted in fractions 8–10, free protein in fractions 15–22, and free nucleotides in fractions 25–30. The void volume fractions (fractions 8–10) from the Biogel column were pooled, and 40 μl of complex, corresponding to approximately 0.1 pmol of DNA complexes, were assayed in a 65-μl reaction containing 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8; 8 mm magnesium acetate; 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin; 100 μm each of dCTP, dGTP, and dATP; and 12.5 μm [α-32P]dTTP. The reaction was incubated at 14 °C for 1 min, at which time 1.5 pmol of RF-C or RF-C-1ΔN was added to the reaction or RF-C storage buffer was added in a control assay. At various time intervals, 20-μl aliquots were removed into 5 μl of 50 mm EDTA, 50% glycerol, and 2% SDS. The products were separated on an 1% alkaline agarose gel as described above. PCNA containing the N-terminal phosphorylatable tag (phPCNA, MRRASVGS-PCNA) was32P-labeled using cAMP-dependent protein kinase and purified as described (34.Eissenberg J.C. Ayyagari R. Gomes X.V. Burgers P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6367-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Complexes were assembled with RF-C or RF-C-1ΔN and isolated by Biogel A-5m filtration as described above, except that 300 fmol of 32P-phPCNA replaced PCNA. The void volume fractions (fractions 8–10) from the Biogel column were pooled, and 55 μl of complex, corresponding to approximately 0.1 pmol of DNA, were assayed in a 65-μl reaction containing 30 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8; 8 mm magnesium acetate; 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin; 100 μm each of dCTP, dGTP, dAMP-PNP, and dTTP; and 0.5 mm ATP as indicated. The reaction was incubated at 14 °C for 1 min, at which time 1.5 pmol of RF-C or RF-C-1ΔN was added to the reaction or RF-C storage buffer was added in a control assay. After 20 min at 14 °C the reaction was cooled on ice and filtered through a second 2-ml Biogel A-5m (Bio-Rad). Three-drop fractions were collected and counted in a scintillation counter. Measurements were performed using a DynaPro-801 molecular sizing instrument. Approximately 1 mg/ml of RF-C or RF-C-1ΔN in HEG300 buffer was filtered through a Whatman Anatop 10 filter (0.1 μm) and measured at 20 °C in the absence or presence of various osmolytes. Twenty independent measurements were determined from each sample. The data were analyzed with the software provided by the manufacturer to obtai"

We report the identification and characterization of a novel CK2-interacting protein, designated CKIP-1, that interacts with CK2α, but not CK2α′, in the yeast two-hybrid system.

CK2 has been reported to phosphorylate a broad range of cellular proteins located in a variety of cellular compartments (mainly the nucleus and cytoplasm) and is involved in important cellular processes such as transcription, translation, morphogenesis, and cell cycle progression (reviewed in Refs. 1.Pinna L.A.

These observations support an important role for CK2 in a variety of cellular functions; however, its specific roles and mode of regulation in cells remain poorly understood. Moreover, these results suggest that CK2 is involved in a complex array of interactions with a wide selection of cellular proteins that are present in a broad variety of cellular locations. CK2 is a tetrameric protein comprised of two regulatory subunits (CK2β) and two catalytic subunits (CK2α and/or CK2α′). CK2α and CK2α′ are the products of separate genes, and their amino acid sequences are highly conserved between higher eukaryotes (reviewed in Ref. 7.Litchfield D.W. Lüscher B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127/128: 187-199Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In fact, in mammals and birds, CK2α and CK2α′ exhibit greater than 90% identity over their 330 amino-terminal amino acids (7.Litchfield D.W. Lüscher B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127/128: 187-199Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This amino-terminal sequence identity is in stark contrast to the unrelated carboxyl-terminal sequences of CK2α and CK2α′ that exhibit no obvious similarity (8.Meisner H. Heller-Harrison R. Buxton J. Czech M.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4072-4076Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 9.Lozeman F. Litchfield D.W. Piening C. Takio K. Walsh K.A. Krebs E.G.

This sequence divergence between the carboxyl-terminal domains of CK2α and CK2α′ suggests that important functional differences that exist between the two different catalytic isozymes result from these unique sequences (11.Vilk G. Saulnier R.B. St. Pierre R. Litchfield D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14406-14414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Previous studies have failed to demonstrate significant catalytic differences between CK2α and CK2α′ in vitro (12.Bodenbach L. Fauss J. Robitzki A. Krehan A. Lorenz P. Lozeman F. Pyerin W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), a result that likely reflects the high similarity exhibited by the catalytic domains of CK2α and CK2α′ (12.Bodenbach L. Fauss J. Robitzki A. Krehan A. Lorenz P. Lozeman F. Pyerin W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). By comparison, there is mounting evidence in support of functional specialization of CK2α and CK2α′ in cells (11.Vilk G. Saulnier R.B. St. Pierre R. Litchfield D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14406-14414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 13.Yu I.J. Spector D.L. Bae Y.S. Marshak D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For example, in HeLa cells, differences in the localization of CK2α and CK2α′ have been observed, with further indications that the localization of both CK2α and CK2α′ may be altered in a cell cycle-dependent manner (13.Yu I.J. Spector D.L. Bae Y.S. Marshak D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, these differences in subcellular localization may be cell type-specific, since major differences in the localization of CK2α and CK2α′ have not been observed in all cells where they have been examined (14.Krek W. Maridor G. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 15.Penner C.G. Wang Z. Litchfield D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that CK2α, but not CK2α′, is phosphorylated in mitotic cells of mammalian and avian origin (16.Litchfield D.W. Lüscher B. Lozeman F.J. Eiseman R.N. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13943-13951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the functions of the two isoforms are independently regulated during cell division. The mitotic sites of phosphorylation of CK2α were identified as Thr344, Thr360, Ser362, and Ser370, all of which are located within the carboxyl-terminal domain of CK2α (17.Bosc D.G. Slominski E. Sichler C. Litchfield D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25872-25878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). There is also a “PXXP” motif adjacent to two of the phosphorylation sites. Interestingly, “PXXP” motifs have been implicated in protein-protein interactions, most notably with SH3 domains of a variety of regulatory proteins (18.Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar, 19.Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have localized CK2 activity within the cytoplasm, the nucleus, and with other cellular structures including the plasma membrane (1.Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 2.Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 123-164PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Tawfic S.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1403: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence studies have confirmed that CK2 is localized in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm (13.Yu I.J. Spector D.L. Bae Y.S. Marshak D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 14.Krek W. Maridor G. Nigg E.A. J.

The factors or mechanisms that regulate the subcellular distribution of CK2 remain poorly understood. In this regard, it may be notable that there is mounting evidence demonstrating that CK2 interacts with a variety of cellular proteins. For example, CK2β has been reported to interact with FGF-2 (24.Bonnet H. Filhol O. Truchet I. Brethenou P. Cochet C. Amalric F. Bouche G. J. Biol.

CK2α and CK2α′ have also been observed to interact with specific protein partners. For instance, both CK2α and CK2α′ have been shown to interact with nucleolin (34.Li D. Dobrowolska G. Krebs E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15662-15668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), ATF1 (35.Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Kawase H. Hiramoto M. Ferdous A. Takayama M. Lee K.A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3854-3861Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), whereas only CK2α has been shown to interact with HSP90 (37.Shi Y. Brown E.D. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2767-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 38.Miyata Y. Yahara I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8123-8129Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and with PP2A (39.Hériché J.-K. Lebrin F. Rabilloud T. Leroy D. Chambaz E.M. Goldberg Y. Science. 1997; 276: 952-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the domain of CK2α implicated in the interaction with PP2A was localized to the sequence 166HEHRKL (human and chicken CK2α), which is one of the few regions of non-identity between CK2α and CK2α′ (HQQKKL). Collectively, these observations suggest that the subcellular localization of CK2, and presumably its ability to phosphorylate a number of its target proteins, may be regulated by interactions with specific protein partners. The resulting compartmentalization of CK2 could provide a mechanism for regulating CK2 activity in cells. In fact, this mode of regulation could reconcile the observations that although CK2 is a predominantly nuclear enzyme, it can also phosphorylate cytoplasmic proteins, as well as nuclear proteins. The possible regulation of CK2 through its interactions with specific protein partners in cells together with the observed functional differences between CK2α and CK2α′ led us to hypothesize that the catalytic subunits of CK2 are involved in isozyme-specific protein-protein interactions and that these interactions may be mediated through the unique carboxyl-terminal domains of CK2α or CK2α′. To examine this hypothesis, we used a yeast two-hybrid system to screen an Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human B-cell library using GAL4 DNA-binding domain fusions encoding full-length CK2α or CK2α′, as well as their respective carboxyl-terminal domains, as bait. In this study, we report the isolation and identification of a novel protein, designated casein kinase interacting protein 1 (i.e.CKIP-1), that binds CK2α but not CK2α′. In addition to providing further indications of functional specialization for CK2α and CK2α′, the identification of this novel protein may provide new insights for understanding how the access of CK2 to some of its cellular targets is regulated. Examination of the predicted amino acid sequence of CKIP-1 reveals the presence of a pleckstrin homology domain that could mediate interactions between CKIP-1 and cellular membranes or proteins as well as motifs (including a leucine zipper and PXXP) that could be involved in protein-protein interactions. Overall, our results raise the possibility that CKIP-1 is a non-enzymatic regulator of CK2 that could play a role in controlling the access of CK2α to specific cellular targets through its ability to sequester CK2 or to recruit CK2 to specific cellular locations. Human osteosarcoma Saos-2 cells and SV40 large T-transformed green monkey kidney COS-7 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Anti-HA antibodies (i.e. 12CA5 monoclonal antibodies) were obtained from Babco; biotinylated rat anti-HA antibodies (clone 3F10) were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse monoclonal anti-biotin antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.; and anti-GFP antibodies were obtained fromCLONTECH or were a generous gift from Dr. L. Berthiaume (University of Alberta). Rabbit antibodies against CK2β were described previously (40.Litchfield D.W. Lozeman F.J. Cicirelli M.F. Harrylock M. Ericsson L.H. Piening C.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20380-20389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose and polyvinylidene difluoride for immunoblots as well as reagents for the colorimetric development of immunoblots were obtained from Bio-Rad. Reagents for enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other reagents were of reagent grade. Full-length cDNAs encoding CK2α or CK2α′ were subcloned into the BamHI site of the pGBT9 vector. Appropriate orientation was verified by DNA sequencing. To prepare constructs encoding the carboxyl-terminal domains of CK2α or CK2α′ (i.e. CK2α-(332–391) and CK2α′-(333–350)), the cDNAs encoding the respective carboxyl-terminal domains were amplified by PCR with restriction sites (EcoRI andBamHI) at either end to facilitate subcloning. A 217-base pair fragment representing the carboxyl-terminal domain of CK2α (i.e. CK2α-(332–391)) was amplified from an sk+/CK2α template using the following primers: 5′ CCG GAA TTC GCT CGA ATG GGT TCA TCT 3′ (sense primer with EcoRI site) and 5′ CGG ATC CAC CTC TGC TCA GGC ATC 3′(antisense primer withBamHI site). Similarly, a 190-base pair fragment containing the carboxyl-terminal domain of CK2α′ (i.e.CK2α′-(333–350)) was amplified from an sk+/CK2α′ template using the following primers: 5′ CCG GAA TTC TCC CAG CCT TGT GCA GAC 3′(sense primer with EcoRI site) and 5′ GTA AAA CGA CGG CCA GT 3′ (M13–20 primer). The amplified fragments were directly cloned into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The sequences of all amplified fragments were confirmed by sequencing the double-stranded pCRII vector with the 5′ CAT TTA GGT GAC ACT ATA G 3′ primer (Sp6 promoter) using a T7 sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The respectiveEcoRI/BamHI fragments were then subcloned intoEcoRI- and BamHI-digested pGBT9 vector. To generate CK2α-(332–391)(4D), the nucleotides coding for the amino acid residues representing the four mitotic sites of phosphorylation at amino acid residues (Thr344, Thr360, Ser362, and Ser370) within CK2α (17.Bosc D.G. Slominski E. Sichler C. Litchfield D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25872-25878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) were mutated to replace each of the phosphorylation sites with aspartic acid. These mutations were engineered in order to mimic the charges brought on by phosphorylation of the four residues. By using two rounds of PCR amplification, we produced the CK2α-(332–391)(4D) mutant. In the first round of PCR, two products were made using the following primers: 5′ CCT GAG CTA CTT GTA GAC TA 3′ (sense primer for the 1st product), 5′ TGG CAC TGA AGA AAT CCC TGA CAT CAT ATT GGC GCT GCT GGG ATC ACT GCC CCC 3′ (antisense primer for the 1st product that introduces the Thr344/Asp mutation), 5′ GGG ATT TCT TCA GTG CCA GAT CCT GAT CCC CTT GGA CCT GCA GGC GAT CCA GTG 3′ (sense primer for the 2nd product that introduces Thr360/Asp, Ser362/Asp, and Ser370/Asp mutations), and 5′ TCC CCC ACC TCT GCT CAG 3′ (antisense primer for the 2nd product). After amplification, the DNA fragments of interest were gel-purified, denatured, allowed to anneal, and then subjected to a second round of PCR using the sense primer from the 1st product in the first round of PCR and the antisense primer from the 2nd product in the first round of PCR as primers. The PCR products from the second round of amplification were directly cloned into the pCRII vector and sequenced. AnEcoRI/SphI fragment from the resultant plasmid encoding the 4D variant of the carboxyl-terminal domain of CK2α was then used to replace a similar fragment in pGEX-CK2α (17.Bosc D.G. Slominski E. Sichler C. Litchfield D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25872-25878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). By using this construct as a template, EcoRI and BamHI sites were generated with PCR using the following primers: 5′ CCG GAA TTC GCT CGA ATG GGT TCA TCT 3′ (sense primer with EcoRI site) and 5′ CGG ATC CAC CTC TGC TCA GGC ATC 3′ (antisense primer withBamHI site). The plasmid pGBT9-CK2α-(332–391) (4D) construct was derived from this construct using the strategy described above for pGBT9-CK2α-(332–391) and pGBT9-CK2α′-(333–350). The constructs were sequenced to confirm identity and to ensure that no mutations were introduced during amplification. The two deletion constructs of CK2 (i.e. CK2α-(2–330) and CK2α-(2–350)) were generated using PCR. Briefly, both constructs were amplified using the same sense primer (5′ GCC ATG GGA AAA AGT TGT TGT TAA AAT TCT C 3′) and the following antisense primers: 5′ CCT CTA GAG TCG ACT CAC TGG TCC TTC ACA ACA GTG 3′ which introduces a stop codon after residue 330 followed by a SalI site for CKα-(2–330), or 5′ GGT CTA GAG TCG ACT CAA TTG GCG CTG CTG ACG GG 3′ which introduces a stop codon after residue 350 followed by aSalI site for CK2α-(2–350). Amplified products were subcloned into pCR-Blunt, sequenced, and then digested withNcoI and SalI. The respectiveNcoI/SalI fragments were subcloned intoSalI/NcoI-digested pGBT9-CK2α to replace the 3′-coding region of CK2α. These constructs were transformed into yeast as described below to ensure that they did not autonomously activate transcription and to verify that the truncated CK2α hybrid proteins still exhibited interactions with pACTII-CK2β. The latter test ensures that the deleted proteins maintain the overall integrity of CK2α that is required to interact with CK2β. To generate constructs for the expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein fusions of CKIP-1, a 1.5-kbBglII fragment encoding the entire open reading frame encoded by the two-hybrid positive was subcloned into theBglII site of the pEGFP-C2 vector (CLONTECH) to yield the pEGFP-C2-CKIP-1. Alternatively, the purified BglII fragment was further digested with BamHI, and the resulting 300-bp fragment was gel-purified and then subcloned into the BamHI site of pEGFP-C2 vector to yield an EGFP fusion protein encoding the carboxyl-terminal 102 amino acids of CKIP (designated pEGFP-C2-CKIP-1-(308–409)). Orientation for pEGFP-C2-CKIP-1 was confirmed by SacI digest, whereas orientation for pEGFP-C2- CKIP-1-(308–409) was confirmed by StuI and BamHI double digest. An EGFP fusion construct lacking the pleckstrin homology domain of CKIP-1 was generated as follows. A fragment encoding residues 133–409 (i.e. CKIP-1-(133–409)) was generated using the following primers: 5′ TGA TCA GAA TTC CCC GAG CCA AGA ACC GTA TCT TGG 3′ (sense primer with BclI and EcoRI sites) and 5′ GAA TTC GTC GAC CCC ACC CTG CCC TCA CAT CAG G 3′ (antisense primer with EcoRI and SalI sites). This fragment was subcloned into pCR-Blunt (Invitrogen) and sequenced. ABclI/BamHI fragment of the insert was then isolated and subcloned into pEGFP-C2-CKIP-1-(308–409) that had been digested with BglII and BamHI to generate pEGF-C2-CKIP-1-(133–409). A strategy similar to that described in the preceding section was used to subclone the 1.5-kb BglII fragment and the 300-bp BamHI/BglII fragment into pGEX-3X to generate glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins encoding the entire open reading frame (designated GST-CKIP-1) and a GST fusion protein encoding the carboxyl-terminal 102 residues of CKIP-1 (designated GST-CKIP-1-(308–409)). A plasmid encoding a GST fusion protein of CK2α was constructed by subcloning theBamHI fragment encoding full-length CK2α into theBamHI site of pGEX-3X. Constructs encoding CK2 subunits with HA epitope tags in pRc/CMV (Invitrogen) were previously described (14.Krek W. Maridor G. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Briefly, HA-CK2α and HA-CK2α′ encode amino-terminally tagged CK2α and CK2α′, respectively, whereas CK2α-HA encodes CK2α with a carboxyl-terminal HA tag. The construct designated HA-CK2α′/α encodes an amino-terminally tagged chimera where the carboxyl-terminal domain of CK2α has been attached to the amino-terminal domain of CK2α′ as described (14.Krek W. Maridor G. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Anti-CKIP-1 antibodies were raised in rabbits by Babco (Richmond, CA) using a GST fusion protein encoding the carboxyl-terminal 102 residues of CKIP (i.e.GST-CKIP-(308–409)) as the antigen. To characterize these antibodies, lysates were prepared from human osteosarcoma Saos-2 cells using Laemmli sample buffer and were analyzed on Western blots that were developed with pre- or post-immune serum from either of the two immunized rabbits in the presence or absence of GST-CKIP-(308–409) or GST. Antiserum from either of the two immunized rabbits, but not the pre-immune serum, recognized a band of approximately 50 kDa in extracts of Saos-2 cells that was blocked by the inclusion of GST-CKIP-(308–409), but not by GST, during the incubation with antibody. Affinity-purified anti-GST antibodies were obtained from this rabbit serum by passing the serum through a GST-affinity column that was made by coupling purified GST to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Once this serum had been depleted of anti-GST antibodies, it was passed through a GST-CKIP-1-(308–409) affinity column that was similarly prepared to isolate affinity-purified anti-CKIP-1 antibodies. Antibodies were recovered from affinity columns as described (45.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 511-552Google Scholar). The yeast strain PJ69-4a (MATa, ade2, trp1–901, leu 2–3, 112 his3–200, gal4, gal80, ura3–52, GAL7-lacZ::met1, GAL2-ADE2::ADE2, GAL1-HIS3::LYS2 (courtesy of Dr. Philip James, University of Wisconsin)) was transformed with the various pGBT9-CK2 constructs using the method of Schiestl and Gietz (41.Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar). The transformants were selected on plates of synthetic complete medium minus Trp (Trp−) after growth for 3–5 days at 30 °C. Separate transformants containing each of the different pGBT9-CK2 constructs were further grown in liquid medium (Trp−) and then transformed with a MATCHMAKER cDNA library (CLONTECH) derived from Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human lymphocytes (B-cell population). Transformants were plated on synthetic complete medium minus Trp and minus Leu (Trp−Leu−), as well as on complete medium minus Trp, minus Leu, minus His, and minus Ade (Trp−Leu−His−Ade−) and grown for 3–6 days at 30 °C. Colonies that grew under the latter conditions were selected for further characterization. Since we had previously demonstrated that interactions between CK2α (or CK2α′) and CK2β can be detected using the two-hybrid system (42.Gietz R.D. Graham K.C. Litchfield D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13017-13021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), we utilized a PCR strategy to examine positive colonies from the screens performed using CK2α or CK2α′ as the bait for the presence of the cDNA encoding CK2β. For this analysis, yeast were grown overnight at 30 °C in liquid culture. Yeast were disrupted by vortexing with glass beads, and plasmid DNA was isolated as described previously (43.Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2057) Google Scholar). The primers used for PCR were 5′GCG GGG ATC CTG AGC AGC TCA GAG GAG 3′ (sense primer located within the domain of CK2β that interacts with CK2α) and 5′CTA CCA GAA TTC GGC ATG CCG GTA GAG GTG TGG TCA 3′ (antisense primer located within the ADH-terminator of pACT) (46.Litchfield D.W. Slominski E. Lewenza S. Narvey M. Bosc D.G. Gietz R.D. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Colonies that were positive for CK2β were not further analyzed. After excluding all of the positives that encoded CK2β, one positive from the screen with CK2α was further characterized. Plasmid DNA was obtained from yeast by glass bead preparation and electroporated into the KC8 strain of Escherichia coli. To select for those bacteria that harbored the pACT plasmid, bacteria were selected on −Leu plates. Plasmid DNA was then isolated and used to re-test for interactions with Gal4 DNA binding domain fusions of CK2α or CK2α′ in yeast, as described above. Transformations were also performed with a number of control constructs (as indicated). Plasmid DNA was also used as a template for sequencing manually using T7 polymerase or by automated sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). A Human Multiple Tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) was probed as recommended in the accompanying manual. Probes that were labeled with 32P were as follows: an XhoI fragment of the CKIP-1 cDNA, or the full-length cDNAs encoding CK2α, CK2α′ or CK2β. A GST fusion protein encoding full-length CK2α or GST itself were expressed in bacteria and purified using glutathione-agarose as described previously (17.Bosc D.G. Slominski E. Sichler C. Litchfie"

A set of 42 x-ray and neutron solution scattering curves from hybrid Escherichia coli ribosomes was obtained, where the proteins and rRNA moieties in the subunits were either protonated or deuterated in all possible combinations. This extensive data set is analyzed using a novel method. The volume defined by the cryoelectron microscopic model of Frank and co-workers (Frank, J., Zhu, J., Penczek, P., Li, Y.

Simulated annealing is employed to assign each sphere to solvent, protein, or rRNA moieties to simultaneously fit all scattering curves. Twelve independent reconstructions starting from random approximations yielded reproducible results. The resulting model at a resolution of 3 nm represents the volumes occupied by rRNA and protein moieties at 95% probability threshold and displays 15 and 20 protein subvolumes in the 30 S and 50 S, respectively, connected by rRNA. 17 proteins with known atomic structure can be tentatively positioned into the protein subvolumes within the ribosome in agreement with the results from other methods. The protein-rRNA map enlarges the basis for the models of the rRNA folding and can further help to localize proteins in high-resolution crystallographic density maps.

Each of the two unequal ribosomal subunits is a complicated assembly of proteins and nucleic acids. Thus, the prokaryotic 70 S ribosome from Escherichia coli has a total molecular mass of about 2.3 × 106 Da and consists of a 30 S and 50 S subunit (1.Wittmann H.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 155-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The 30 S subunit contains 21 individual proteins and a single 16 S rRNA molecule, and the 50 S subunit, 33 proteins and two rRNA molecules (5 S rRNA + 23 S rRNA). In both subunits the rRNA moieties account for about two-thirds of the mass. A better description of the interactions between proteins and rRNA in the ribosome is of paramount importance for the understanding of the structural mechanism of protein synthesis. The structure of the ribosome has been extensively studied for decades using various methods. In the last years, cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM)1yielded models of the overall shape of the ribosome at a resolution of 1.5 nm (2.Frank J. Zhu J. Penczek P. Li Y.H. Srivastava S. Verschoor A.

Recent tremendous progress in the x-ray crystallography provided electron density maps down to 0.78 nm for ribosomal complexes containing tRNAs (6.Cate J.H. Yusupov M.M. Yusupova G.Z. Earnest T.E. Noller H.F. Science. 1999; 285: 2095-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) and to 0.45 nm for the individual ribosomal subunits (7.Tocilj A. Schlünzen F. Janell D. Glühmann M.

Despite these remarkable achievements, limited information has so far been obtained about the spatial distribution of rRNA and proteins in the ribosome. Using the x-ray maps, six ribosomal proteins were positioned in the small (7.Tocilj A. Schlünzen F. Janell D. Glühmann M. Hansen H.A.S. Harms J. Bashan A. Bartels H. Agmon I. Franceschi F.

Nature. 1999; 400: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The low contrast between ribosomal proteins and rRNA for both electrons and x-rays makes it difficult to distinguish between the two components even at relatively high resolution. Moreover, disordered or flexible domains do not show up in the electron density maps obtained by the x-ray crystal analysis (6.Cate J.H. Yusupov M.M. Yusupova G.Z. Earnest T.E. Noller H.F. Science. 1999; 285: 2095-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 8.Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Capel M. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 400: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Neutron scattering in solution, although yielding only low-resolution information (11.Feigin L.A. Svergun D.I. Structure Analysis by Small-angle X-ray and Neutron Scattering. Plenum Press, New York1987Crossref Google Scholar), is a powerful tool to study complexes of proteins and nucleic acids. Scattering from a particle or its component is proportional to the squared contrast (difference between the scattering density of the particle/component and that of the solvent), and measurements at different contrasts provide additional information about the object (12.Stuhrmann H.B. Kirste R.G. Z. Phys. Chem. Neue. Folge. 1965; 46: 247-250Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). As the neutron scattering lengths of hydrogen and deuterium differ drastically, isotopic H/D substitution is widely employed for the contrast variation. In earlier studies using H2O/D2O mixtures (13.Stuhrmann H.B. Koch M.H.J. Parfait R. Haas J. Ibel K. Crichton R.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 119: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 14.Koch M.H.J. Stuhrmann H.B. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 59: 670-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), integral parameters of the protein and rRNA moieties were established. Yet more information is provided by selective deuteration of the ribosomal components. Triangulation of labeled protein pairs in the ribosomal subunits so far provided the most comprehensive information about the protein positions (15.Capel M.S. Engelman D.M. Freeborn B.R. Kjeldgaard M. Langer J.A. Ramakrishnan V. Schindler D.G. Schneider D.K. Schoenborn B.P. Sillers I.-Y. Yabuki S. Moore P.B.

In a recent study (17.Svergun D.I. Burkhardt N. Pedersen J.S. Koch M.H.J. Volkov V.V. Kozin M.B. Meerwinck W. Stuhrmann H.B. Diedrich G. Nierhaus K.H. J. Mol.

J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 602-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), 42 solution scattering curves from the hybrid E. coli ribosomes were measured, where the proteins and rRNA moieties in the subunits were selectively deuterated. This is probably the most extensive set of consistent x-ray and neutron contrast-variation data collected on a single object. The curves permitted to validate cryo-EM models of the ribosome (2.Frank J. Zhu J. Penczek P. Li Y.H. Srivastava S. Verschoor A. Radermacher M. Grassucci R. Lata R.K. Agrawal R.K.

Structure. 1995; 3: 815-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and they were further interpreted in terms of a solid body model constructed from the envelopes of the subunits and those of the rRNA moieties. Here, we exploit the data set further using a new analysis method (19.Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar), where an overall shape of the object provided by cryo-EM is filled by densely packed small spheres. The algorithm assigns each sphere to the rRNA or protein moieties (or to the solvent) to simultaneously fit the available scattering data. Its efficiency was illustrated (19.Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar) by anab initio restoration of a model structure representing the envelope of the 30 S ribosomal subunit with several embedded proteins. The application of the new method significantly improves the resolution of the neutron-scattering maps of the ribosomal structure. A three-dimensional map of the protein-rRNA distribution is established which, in particular, reveals the likely positions of individual ribosomal proteins or protein complexes in the 70 S E. coliribosome. The sample preparation and scattering experiments are described in detail elsewhere (17.Svergun D.I. Burkhardt N. Pedersen J.S. Koch M.H.J. Volkov V.V. Kozin M.B. Meerwinck W. Stuhrmann H.B.

The 70 S samples of the E. coli ribosome were made by in vitro association of selectively deuterated ribosomal subunits and checked for structural integrity and biological activity. The neutron experiments were performed at the Risø Laboratory (Roskilde, Denmark (20.Lebech B. Neutron News. 1990; 1: 7-13Google Scholar)) and at the GKSS Research Center (Geesthacht, Germany (21.Stuhrmann H.B.

Using two sample-detector distances (“low angle” and “high angle” setting), the range of momentum transfer 0.09 < s < 2.3 nm−1 was covered (s = (4π/λ)sinθ, where λ is the wavelength, and2θ is the scattering angle).

The 70 S ribosome consists of four components representing the total proteins (TP) and the rRNA moieties in the 30 S and 50 S subunits (denoted below as TP30, TP50, RNA30, and RNA50, respectively). The search volume was defined by drawing a regular grid of points in space corresponding to dense hexagonal packing of spheres of radius r 0 = 0.5 nm inside a parallelepiped determined by the gabarites of the cryo-EM reconstruction of the 70 S E. coli ribosome (2.Frank J. Zhu J. Penczek P. Li Y.H. Srivastava S. Verschoor A. Radermacher M. Grassucci R. Lata R.K. Agrawal R.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). If the distance between a point and the closest pixel in the EM reconstruction did not exceed 1.5 r 0, a dummy atom is placed at this point. This procedure expands the original model and thus reduces the bias and allows for deviations from the EM shape. The structure of the four component dummy atoms model (DAM) is defined by assigning a number (component index) 0 ≤ X j ≤ 4 to each dummy atom. As the subunits are well resolved in the cryo-EM model, the 30 S and 50 S subvolumes are defined where the dummy atoms may have the component index 0,1,2 (solvent, TP30 or RNA30) and 0,3,4 (solvent, TP50 or RNA50), respectively. The atoms at the subunit interface can belong to any component. The DAM in Fig. 1 contains 2644 atoms in the 30 S subvolume, 5020 atoms in the 50 S subvolume, 196 atoms at the interface, and encloses the volume of 5560 nm3 (that of the original cryo-EM model is 3920 nm3). In keeping with the low resolution of the solution scattering data, the model must be constrained to have low resolution with respect tor 0. For this, a list of neighbors (i.e atoms at an offset 2r 0) is defined for each dummy atom. Looseness (degree of isolation) of a non-solvent atom is calculated asP(N e) = exp(−0.5N e) − exp(−0.5N c), where N e is the number of neighbors having the same index and N c = 12 is the coordination number for hexagonal packing. Looseness of the configuration X (i.e. its non-compactness) is characterized by the average value P(X) = <P(N e)> over all non-solvent atoms. Another condition requires connectivity, i.e. a possibility to connect two arbitrarily selected atoms belonging to a component by successively connecting neighboring atoms belonging to this component. The measure of connectivity of the k-th component is computed as Gk(X) = ln(N k/M k)≥0, whereN k and M k are the numbers of dummy atoms in the entire component and in the longest connected fragment, respectively. Using the multipole expansion, the scattering intensity from a four component ribosomal DAM in solution is (17.Svergun D.I. Burkhardt N. Pedersen J.S. Koch M.H.J. Volkov V.V. Kozin M.B. Meerwinck W.

Equations 1 and 2 permit one to rapidly compute the scattering curves from the DAM for an arbitrary configuration X under the given contrasts of the components.

Starting from a random configuration X 0, the assignment of a single atom is changed randomly (a move fromX to X′). If Δ =f(X′) − f(X) < 0, the move is accepted, if not, it can be accepted with a probability exp(-Δ/T), where T is annealing temperature. The latter is held constant for 70N moves or 7N accepted moves, whichever occurs first, then it is decreased (T′ = 0.9T). The procedure starts at a sufficiently high temperature T ≅ 101 and runs down toT ≅ 10−3 until no further reduction inf(X) is observed. A complete run takes about 3 weeks CPU time on a 180 MHz SGI machine. After preliminary calculations, the penalty weight α ≅ 20 was selected so that the penalty term amounted to about 5–10% of f(X) at the end of minimization (independent runs yielded discrepancy about χ ≅ 4.1 and looseness P(X) ≅ 0.08). Each of the dummy atoms filling the search volume in Fig.1 was assigned to a specific component (solvent, TP30, TP50, RNA30, or RNA50) by simultaneously fitting the available scattering curves in Table I. Already preliminary computations without using connectivity constrain yielded well separated volumes for the protein and rRNA moieties. For all independent restorations starting from random initial approximations, proteins in both subunits converged to several isolated subvolumes, whereas the distribution of the dummy atoms belonging to the rRNAs was more uniform and featureless (see example in Fig.2, top). To further constrain the model, the connectivity requirement was imposed on the rRNA moieties in both subunits and also on the entire subunit (see details under “Experimental Procedures”). Corresponding connectivity factorsG k(X) were added to the looseness penaltyP(X) during minimization and 12 independent restorations yielded very consistent results. The positions of the individual protein subvolumes differ slightly in different restorations (typical deviations are illustrated in Fig. 2, bottom). Given that the restorations provide the same overall discrepancy χ ≅ 4.1 (typical fit to the experimental data is presented in Fig.3), this uncertainty has to be attributed to the low resolution of the solution scattering data. A similar ambiguity has been observed in model calculations on a ribosome-like structure (19.Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar).Figure 3Typical fit of the neutron (A) and x-ray (B) scattering data by the SA models. Successive curves are displaced up by one logarithmic unit corresponding to the distance between theordinate tick marks (in panel A, also by Δs = 0.05 nm−1 along theabscissa) for better visualization. For the neutron scattering data in panel A, fits to the low angle and high angle settings are displayed separately, and the sequence of curves, from bottom to top, corresponds to that in TableI.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The reliability of the results is assessed by the analysis of the 12 independently obtained configurations. For each dummy atom, the number of repetitions (i.e. the number of times a given position was attributed to the same specific component) was counted. The frequency histogram (numbers of atoms having the given number of repetitions) is presented in Fig. 4 along with the histogram computed from 12 randomly generated DAMs. The two distributions are principally different and that obtained from the SA has much higher proportion of atoms with high repetition rates. In particular, the random generations indicate that the probability for a dummy atom to be occasionally assigned to one and the same component 12 times out of 12 is about 2 × 10−6. Alone the fact that the frequency histogram contains 1755 such atoms underlines the statistical significance and reproducibility of the results. The uncertainty illustrated in Fig. 2 (bottom), indicates that the assignment of the dummy atoms close to the protein-rRNA interface or to the subunit border may differ in different reconstructions. Given also that closely positioned proteins may be joined in single globules at low resolution, the method does not yield exact positions and shapes of all individual proteins. Nevertheless, the analysis of the independent reconstructions permits one to distinguish between the volumes occupied by proteins and rRNA in the ribosomal subunits with a reasonable probability. For each of the four ribosomal components (TP30, RNA30, TP50, and RNA50) we build a volume from the atoms that were ascribed to a specific component at least once in the 12 reconstructions. It is conceivable that these 4 volumes enclose the true volumes of the corresponding ribosomal components. In each of these volumes we now discard the atoms that appeared only once and keep those atoms ascribed to the given component twice and more. Simulations with randomly generated structures show that the remaining volumes would enclose the true volumes with the probability of 95%. The rRNA and protein moieties thus obtained are well separated in both subunits: the overlap (relative number of dummy atoms found in the two moieties simultaneously) is less than 17 and 20% in the 30 S and 50 S subunit, respectively. The overlapping positions are resolved by selecting the component with higher number of repetitions. The final map of the protein-rRNA distribution in the ribosome at a resolution of about 2π/s max ≅ 3 nm is presented in Fig. 5. Given that no distinction is made between proteins and rRNA at the first stage (see Fig. 2,top), the mere fact that the proteins reproducibly converge to separated volumes connected by the rRNA moiety underlines the soundness of the restoration. The integral parameters of the ribosomal components in Table II are in a good agreement with those reported in (17.Svergun D.I. Burkhardt N. Pedersen J.S. Koch M.H.J. Volkov V.V. Kozin M.B.

The ribonucleoprotein enzyme telomerase directs the synthesis of telomeric repeat units onto this G-rich strand, thereby counteracting the loss of sequence that occurs at each cell division (3.Greider C.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 337-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). It is thought that the G-rich strand will then serve as substrate for the synthesis of the complementary strand by DNA primase followed by conventional DNA polymerases (7.Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H.

The presence of a 3′ overhang of the G-rich strand suggests that single-stranded DNA binding activities will play an important role in telomere function. Proteins that can bind to single-stranded telomeric repeats include protein α of Oxytricha,Stylonychia, and Euplotes. The 56-kDa protein α of Oxytricha exists as an heterodimer with the 41-kDa protein β (9.Gottschling D.E. Zakian V.A.

In vertebrates, several proteins can interact with single-stranded G-rich extensions in vitro. For example, the chicken MF3 protein and the Xenopus XTEF protein share this property (23.Gualberto A.

However, there has been no demonstration that these proteins bind to telomeres in vivo or that their expression influences the structure of telomeres. Mammalian hnRNP1 proteins have been reported to associate with RNA and DNA oligonucleotides carrying telomeric repeats (25.McKay S.J. Cooke H.

Wellinger R.J. Chabot B. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The only mammalian hnRNP protein for which genetic evidence of a function in telomere biogenesis has been obtained is the hnRNP A1 protein. Ectopic expression of A1 promotes telomere elongation in mammalian cells (29.LaBranche H. Dupuis S. Ben-David Y. Bani M.R. Wellinger R.J. Chabot B. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Although hnRNP A1 is a well known modulator of alternative pre-mRNA splicing (30.Blanchette M. Chabot B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1939-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 31.Mayeda A. Munroe S.H. Caceres J.F. Krainer A.R.

A. 1994; 91: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), several observations are consistent with the notion that the function of A1 in telomere control may be direct and therefore independent of its role in alternative splicing. First, a shortened derivative of A1 (UP1) that has no intrinsic activity in alternative splicing (31.Mayeda A. Munroe S.H. Caceres J.F. Krainer A.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5483-5495Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), but which can antagonize the modulatory activity of A1 in splicing extracts (30.Blanchette M. Chabot B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1939-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), also promotes telomere elongation (29.LaBranche H. Dupuis S. Ben-David Y. Bani M.R. Wellinger R.J. Chabot B. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Second, UP1 and A1 can interact specifically with single-stranded telomeric repeats in vitro(29.LaBranche H. Dupuis S. Ben-David Y. Bani M.R. Wellinger R.J. Chabot B. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Third, UP1 may interact with telomerase, as judged by its ability to recover telomerase activity from a cell lysate (29.LaBranche H. Dupuis S. Ben-David Y. Bani M.R. Wellinger R.J. Chabot B. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Although we do not yet know whether A1 binds to single-stranded telomeric extensionsin vivo, here we present further evidence consistent with a direct role for A1 in telomere biogenesis. We show that the binding of A1 and UP1 to a long single-stranded oligonucleotide protects DNA from endonuclease and exonuclease attack. Moreover, A1/UP1 binding to telomeric repeats represses telomerase extension and rNTP-dependent DNA synthesis. Thus, our results suggest that A1/UP1 can contribute to telomere protection and can modulate telomere replication in vitro. DNA oligonucleotides (see TableI) were purified on acrylamide/urea gels. For binding assays, oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled by incubation with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and purified using MicroSpin™ G-25 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Table IList of oligonucleotidesOligonucleotideSequenceaTGGCCTAGTGTCCTGGTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTbTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTGGTCCTGTGATCCGGb′CCGGATCACAGGACCa′CCAGGACACTAGGCCTS10(TTAGGG)10TS8A(TTAGGG)8TGAAGAAAATTAGTSAATCCGTCGAGCAGAGTTTS1AATCCGTCGAGTAGGGTTNe4GGGGGTGGGAGCAGGGGAGGC5(CCCTAA)5C6(CCCTAA)6MS2CGAAGTCGACTGCAGCGTACCCTGATGGTGTACGTel2(GGTTAG)3Tel3(GGTTAG)4Tel3m(TTTGGG)4 Open table in a new tab pGEX-A1 was constructed by inserting the mouse A1 cDNA (33.Ben-David Y.

The UP1 fragment was produced as described by LaBranche et al. (29.LaBranche H. Dupuis S. Ben-David Y. Bani M.R. Wellinger R.J. Chabot B. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and was inserted into the EcoRI site of pGEX-2T. pGEX-UP1ΔRRM1 was produced by deleting thePvuII–NdeI fragment. pGEX-UP1ΔRRM2 was produced by cutting pGEX-UP1 with BglII, filling with Klenow before religation. Recombinant A1, UP1, and protein derivatives were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 or DH5α. Cells were grown 2–3 h at 37 °C until reaching an OD between 0.5–2.0 at 600 nm. Induction with 100 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was performed for 4 h. Cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 5 ml of PBS per 100 ml of culture, to which was added 10 μl of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 m) and 25 μl of DTT (1 m). Cells were sonicated 30 s and left on ice for 30 s. This cycle was repeated another three times. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature on a nutator. Following centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C, 250 μl of glutathione-Sephadex (from a 50% slurry in phosphate-buffered saline) was added to the supernatant. The mixture was incubated 30 min at 4 °C, spun, and washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline. GST-A1 was eluted with 500 μl of 20 mm glutathione-reduced, 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.5) and 120 mm NaCl. GST-UP1 was eluted with 500 μl of 20 mm glutathione-reduced, 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 120 mm NaCl. To obtain proteins devoid of the GST moiety, bound proteins were treated with thrombin, and the released proteins were collected. The concentration of proteins was determined by Bradford staining or by staining gels containing bovine serum albumin standards. 5′-Radiolabeled oligonucleotides were incubated 30 min at 30 °C with various amounts of proteins in a 10-μl final volume of 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 75 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Samples were loaded onto a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (115 V), and complexes were visualized by autoradiography. DNase I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), exonuclease I (U.S. Biochemical Corp.), and Bal31 (Promega) protection assays were set up with 5′-labeled oligonucleotides incubated with recombinant proteins in the binding buffer described above. Following a 30-min incubation at 30 °C, each sample was split into two sets. One set was tested for binding in a native gel, as above. Nuclease was added to the other set (5 units of DNase I, 1 unit of exonuclease I, or 1 unit of Bal31), and the mixtures were incubated for 10 min at room temperature (DNase I), 1 min at 37 °C (exonuclease I), or 10 min at 30 °C (Bal31). Ten pmol of oligonucleotides was added to proteins (G-UP1, G-A1, UP1, G-UP1Δ1, G-UP1Δ2, and gene 32 protein (gp32)), 1 μl of [α-32P]dGTP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 5 μl of Telomix B (200 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.2), 20 mm dATP, 20 mm dTTP, 4 μm dGTP, 4 mm MgCl2, 8 mm EGTA, 8 mm DTT, 1 μl of RNAguard (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 4 mm spermidine, 0.4 mmspermine) to a final volume of 10 μl. Ten μl of HeLa S100 extract was added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 25 μl of RNase mix (20 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mg/ml RNase A) and incubation for 15 min at 37 °C. After treatment with proteinase K (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5% SDS, 0.3 mg/ml proteinase K (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 25 μl per reaction), extension products were purified by two phenol-chloroform extractions and ethanol precipitation. Products were fractionated onto 8% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel. To test whether the effect of UP1 can be observed after telomerase loading onto the template, the reaction was incubated in telomix B lacking dNTPs for 10 min at 30 °C without UP1. dNTPs were then added to start elongation by telomerase with or without the addition of UP1, and the mixture was incubated at 30 °C for an additional 1 h. In competition experiments, TS8A or MS2 oligonucleotides were incubated with UP1 for 15 min at 25 °C. S100 extract was then added and incubated for another 15 min at room temperature. Last, template oligonucleotides, [α-32P]dGTP, and Telomix B were added to the mixture. To test RNA-dependent elongation, RNase A (final concentration: 0.25 mg/ml) was added to the S100 extract before incubation with TS10. The assay was performed essentially as described by Froelich-Ammon et al. (13.Froelich-Ammon S.J. Dickinson B.A. Bevilacqua J.M. Schultz S.C. Cech T.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1504-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). 0.83 pmol of oligonucleotides (TS10 or TS) was added to UP1 or gp32 protein in 1× TdT buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.). The mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C or 1 h at 30 °C. TdT (5 units; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 0.5 μl of dTTP (400 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added to a final volume of 40 μl and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by incubation for 2 h at 45 °C in 200 μl of stop solution (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 15 mm EDTA, 0.6% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K). Labeled extension products were purified by two extractions with phenol-chloroform and ethanol precipitation and were fractionated onto a 8% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel. The procedure described by Reveal et al. (38.Reveal P.M. Henkels K.M. Turchi J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11678-11681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) was used. HeLa nuclear extract, HeLa S100, and CB3 nuclear extract were prepared according to the procedure of Dignam et al. (34.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9147) Google Scholar) and dialyzed in 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 7.5 mm DTT. Essentially, 5 pmol of TS10 oligonucleotide was incubated in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mmMgCl2, 7.5 mm DTT with a 1 mmconcentration each of rATP, rCTP, rUTP, dATP, and dTTP; 10 μm dCTP; 100 nm [α-32P]dCTP (3 μCi; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); and 1 μl of HeLa nuclear extract for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 mm EDTA, and the products were purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Reaction products were loaded onto a 20% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel and revealed by autoradiography. When exogenous proteins were added to the assay, they were incubated with TS10, dNTPs, and [α-32P]dCTP for 30 min at 30 °C before the addition of rNTPs and the nuclear extract. CB3 nuclear extract and HeLa postcytoplasmic S100 extract were also used but without pre-dialysis of the extracts. For competition experiments, the TS10/protein mixture was co-incubated with the indicated amounts of Tel2, Ne4, or TS10 oligonucleotides. We reported that recombinant forms of the A1 and UP1 proteins (GST-A1 and GST-UP1) can bind directly and specifically to short single-stranded oligonucleotides carrying 2–4 contiguous vertebrate TAGGGT telomeric repeats (29.LaBranche H. Dupuis S. Ben-David Y. Bani M.R. Wellinger R.J. Chabot B. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). As monitored by gel shift assays, A1 and UP1 did not bind to a 22-nucleotide yeast telomeric sequence (data not shown). Because mammalian chromosomes end with G-rich single-stranded overhangs, we tested the influence of nontelomeric sequences flanking the telomeric repeats. Binding assays using UP1 and oligonucleotides carrying nontelomeric sequences upstream or downstream of the telomeric cassette indicated a slight preference for telomeric repeats located at the 3′-end (Fig. 1 A, comparelanes 1–3 with lanes 9–11). Likewise, UP1 bound slightly more efficiently to oligonucleotides carrying a double-stranded portion at the 5′-end rather than at the 3′-end (Fig. 1 A, compare lanes 5–7 with lanes 13–15). Binding assays performed in the presence of an excess of unlabeled competitor oligomers confirmed that UP1 interacts slightly better with an oligomer that contains telomeric sequences at the 3′ terminus (Fig.1 B). Because the length of single-stranded G-rich overhangs in human and mouse telomeres ranges from 50 to 150 nucleotides (4.Makarov V.L. Hirose Y. Langmore J.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 5.McElligott R. Wellinger R.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3705-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 6.Wright W.E. Tesmer V.M. Huffman K.E. Levene S.D. Shay J.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2801-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), we examined the binding of A1/UP1 to a more natural substrate (TS10) containing 10 contiguous telomeric TTAGGG repeats and, hence, nine complete A1 binding sites (TAGGGT). A mobility shift assay performed with GST-UP1 revealed the assembly of three complexes with TS10 (Fig.2, lanes 1–6). A similar result was obtained with GST-A1, and no complex was formed when GST-A1 or GST-UP1 was incubated with a control oligonucleotide of similar length (data not shown). The profile of complex formation on TS10 was different when a preparation of UP1 lacking the GST moiety was used (Fig. 2, lanes 8–10). In this case, a small complex appeared at a low concentration of UP1, several complexes of intermediate mobility appeared as the concentration of UP1 was increased, and a single highly retarded complex was detected at the highest concentration of UP1. Thus, although the presence of a bulky GST domain does not dramatically affect the affinity of UP1 to TS10, it influences the architecture of the complex. To determine whether the binding of UP1 to telomeric sequences requires both nucleic acid binding domains, we tested the binding activity of UP1 molecules deprived of either RRM2 or part of RRM1 (Fig. 3, A andB). The UP1 derivative lacking the C-terminal RRM2 domain (UP1Δ2) was almost as efficient as the complete UP1 protein at binding to TS10 (Fig. 3 C). The binding of UP1Δ2 remained specific, since short oligonucleotides carrying mutated telomeric repeats were bound less efficiently by UP1Δ2 (Fig. 3 D). A UP1 derivative lacking most of RRM1 (UP1Δ1) was considerably less efficient than UP1 and UP1Δ2 at binding to TS10 (Fig. 3 C). These results indicate that the N-terminal portion of UP1 that contains RRM1 is sufficient for stable and specific binding. Since stable UP1 binding requires a minimum of two TAGGGT units (29.LaBranche H. Dupuis S. Ben-David Y. Bani M.R. Wellinger R.J. Chabot B. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), each unit may be bound by the RRM1 domain of one UP1 molecule. We next examined whether UP1 binding could protect telomeric sequences against nucleolytic activities. Incubation of naked TS10 with DNase I yielded a profile indicative of preferential cleavage after each G in every repeat (Fig.4A, lane 7;B, lane 6; and C,lane 9). The sites of cleavage were confirmed by comparison with a profile obtained by DMS treatment, which generates cuts at all G nucleotides (data not shown). At the lowest concentrations of GST-A1, DNase I cleavage occurred preferentially at the T↓T of each repeat (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1–3). Complete protection of TS10 was observed at higher concentrations of GST-A1 (lanes 4–6). An assay performed with GST-UP1 and a higher level of DNase I yielded similar results (Fig. 4 B). Likewise, a preparation of UP1 lacking the GST moiety offered a level of protection that was equivalent to the level obtained with GST derivatives (Fig. 4 C,lanes 1–8). In contrast, incubation of GST-A1 or UP1 with an oligonucleotide (C6) not bound by these proteins offered little or no protection against DNase I (Fig. 4 A,lanes 8–14; C, lanes 10–18). Thus, low concentrations of A1 or UP1 changed the cleavage profile obtained with DNase I, consistent with the notion that TAGGGT is the unit bound by A1 and UP1. At high concentrations of A1 or UP1, complete protection was observed. The binding of A1 and UP1 to single-stranded telomeric sequences can therefore promote the assembly of a complex that is highly resistant to endonuclease attack. The derivative UP1Δ1, which binds weakly to TS10, did not offer significant protection against DNase I (Fig. 4 D,lanes 8–10). Although UP1Δ2 binds to TS10 nearly as efficiently as UP1, it was less efficient at protecting TS10 against DNase I (Fig. 4 D, lanes 5–7). Thus, strong binding is not sufficient to confer full protection, suggesting that portions of UP1 help prevent access of the endonuclease to DNA. Protection assays were also performed with the E. coli 3′ exonuclease I, which carries out nucleotide removal on naked TS10 or C6 to yield a ladder of products (Fig. 4 E, lanes 3 and 6). It is unclear why no products shorter than 35 nucleotides are detected with TS10. The highest concentration of UP1 decreased the level of TS10 ExoI products by 2-fold while providing no protection to the C6 oligonucleotide (lanes 2 and 5, respectively). A similar experiment performed with Bal31 exonuclease showed that the addition of increasing amounts of UP1 protects oligonucleotide TS10 but not C6 against Bal31 activity (data not shown). The efficiency of UP1 binding to the oligonucleotides correlated well with the level of protection from Bal31 (Fig. 4 F). Our results clearly indicate that UP1 binding to a long telomeric substrate provides protection against the activity of endo- and exonucleases. We next investigated whether A1 or UP1 could affect the ability of telomerase to extend telomeric DNA in vitro. Recombinant UP1 lacking the GST moiety was prebound to TS10, and the complex was incubated in a HeLa S100 extract. In this conventional telomerase assay, the extension products are monitored directly following fractionation in a denaturing gel. In the absence of UP1, telomerase added multiple repeats to TS10, indicative of high processivity (Fig.5 A, lane 1). No activity was detected when the S100 extract was treated with RNase A (lane 2). Preincubation with increasing amounts of UP1 led to a gradual reduction in telomerase activity (lanes 3–5) such that few products were made at concentrations of UP1 that shifted TS10 into low mobility complexes (Fig. 5 B, lanes 1–4). A similar result was obtained with GST-A1 (Fig. 5 A,lanes 6–8). Inhibition appeared A1/UP1 protein-specific, since preincubation with the single-stranded DNA-binding gp32 was less efficient at inhibiting telomerase (Fig.5 A, lanes 9–11) despite the fact that gp32 assembled TS10 into low mobility complexes as efficiently as UP1 (Fig. 5 B, lanes 5–7). Inhibition of telomerase activity by UP1 was less apparent when a short substrate was used. The appearance of the shorter extension products derived from oligonucleotide TS was not compromised by large amounts of UP1 (Fig. 5 C, lane 2). However, UP1 promoted a small but reproducible decrease in the appearance of the largest (+20) extension product (lane 3). While oligonucleotide TS is a common substrate in telomerase (TRAP) assays (35.Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. West M.D. Ho P.L. Coviello G.M. Wright W.E. Weinrich S.L. Shay J.W. Science. 1994; 266: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (6509) Google Scholar), it does not contain a complete telomeric repeat and is not bound by UP1 (not shown). Because the largest TS extension product carries three complete A1 binding sites (TAGGGT), the product carrying two sites is the first substrate sensitive to the addition of UP1. This is consistent with our observation that at least two TAGGGT units are required for stable UP1 binding (29.LaBranche H. Dupuis S. Ben-David Y. Bani M.R. Wellinger R.J. Chabot B. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). We also tested a derivative carrying one complete telomeric repeat (TS1). While TS1 can be extended in a S100 extract, the addition of UP1 compromised the appearance of a shorter (+14) extension product (Fig. 5 C, lane 4), again consistent with the notion that at least two TAGGGT units are required for UP1 binding. To confirm that UP1 binding to the telomerase substrate was responsible for the inhibition, we preincubated UP1 with a molar excess of an oligonucleotide bound by UP1 (TS8A) or an oligonucleotide not bound by UP1 (MS2). TS8A and MS2 are not efficiently extended by telomerase (data not shown). Preincubating UP1 with TS8A stimulated extension of TS10 (Fig. 5 D, lanes 3 and4), while preincubation with MS2 had little effect (lanes 5 and 6). Overall, these results show that inhibition of telomerase activity by UP1 is specific to substrates carrying high affinity A1 binding sites. The inhibitory activity of UP1 derivatives lacking either RRM1 or RRM2 was also tested. Although UP1Δ2 binds to TS10 as efficiently as the complete UP1 protein, it did not inhibit telomerase extension of TS10 (Fig. 5 E). UP1Δ1, which does not bind efficiently to TS10, also did not affect telomerase extension (data not shown). To determine whether UP1 could affect the activity of other DNA polymerases, we first tested the activity of calf thymus terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT), which like telomerase carries out extension on a 3′-end. Unlabeled TS10 oligomer was incubated with TdT in the presence of UP1 and radiolabeled TTP. Nucleotide addition was monitored on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. As shown in Fig.6, UP1 strongly inhibited extension of TS10 (lanes 2–4). UP1Δ2 also efficiently repressed TdT activity (lanes 5–7), while UP1Δ1 had little effect (lanes 8–10). The inhibitory effect of UP1 was specific, since an oligonucleotide lacking an A1 binding site (TS oligo) was efficiently extended by TdT in the presence of a high concentration of UP1 (data not shown). Notably, the addition of gp32 also prevented extension of TS10 by TdT (lanes 11–14). Thus, although UP1Δ2 and gp32"

In contrast, little is known about the mechanisms required for lipid transport within eukaryotic cells. Multiple mechanisms for lipid transport have been proposed including (a) vesicle packaging and routing, (b) phospholipid transfer proteins, and (c) zones of apposition between donor and acceptor organelle compartments (3.Trotter P.J. Voelker D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 241-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 4.Voelker D.R. Vance D.E. Vance J. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. 31. Elsevier, Paris1996: 391-423Google Scholar). Some experimental evidence exists in support of each of the above proposed mechanisms. However, the current results suggest considerable diversity, rather than a simple set of unifying principles, is involved in the process of lipid transport. In an effort to address the problem of lipid transport, this laboratory has focused upon the metabolism of PtdSer1 in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae (5.Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Voelker D.R. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 13189-13196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The lipid, PtdSer, provides a number of advantages for examining transport because the multiple events in its conversion to phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) occur within different organelle domains and provide discrete biochemical indicators of transport steps. The topology of PtdSer metabolism and the basis of the genetic strategy used in this study are outlined in Fig. 1. PtdSer is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum or closely related membranes by PtdSer synthase (10.Gaigg B. Simbeni R. Hrastnik C. Paltauf F. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1234: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Following its synthesis, the lipid is disseminated throughout the cell. Upon arrival at the mitochondria or the Golgi/vacuole, PtdSer is decarboxylated to form PtdEtn (8.Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Yates R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6071-6080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 11.Kuchler K. Daum G. Paltauf F. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 901-910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mitochondrial decarboxylase is Psd1p, and the Golgi/vacuole enzyme is Psd2p (5.Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21416-21424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Trotter P.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6062-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Following its formation in either the mitochondria or the Golgi/vacuole, PtdEtn is transported to the endoplasmic reticulum for the synthesis of PtdCho (5.Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21416-21424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Atkinson K.D. Fogel S. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6653-6661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The methyltransferase enzymes Pem1p and Pem2p catalyze the formation of PtdCho from PtdEtn usingS-adenosylmethionine as the methyl donor (13.Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. Henry S.A. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 415-500Google Scholar). In this study, we have used cells harboring the null allele,psd1Δ::TRP1, to force all PtdSer metabolism through the Golgi/vacuolar compartments (5.Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21416-21424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Trotter P.J. Wu W. Pedretti J.P. Yates R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13189-13196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In this genetic background, we reason that it should be possible, after mutagenesis, to isolate new strains with defects in metabolic steps between PtdSer formation and PtdEtn methylation. Included in these steps are vectorial lipid transport events between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi/vacuole for PtdSer and between the Golgi/vacuole and endoplasmic reticulum for PtdEtn. Our approach follows from the observations that cells with inactivating mutations in PtdSer synthase (PSS) or both PSD1 and PSD2 genes remain viable if supplemented with ethanolamine (Etn) (7.Trotter P.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6062-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 8.Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Yates R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1980; 255: 6653-6661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Etn rescues the aforementioned strains by providing PtdEtn via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway. These latter findings imply that specific defects in PtdSer and PtdEtn transport may be identifiable and amenable to rescue by Etn supplementation. This general approach has been applied in a previous study and has identified the PtdIns 4-kinase, Stt4p, as an important component in PtdSer metabolism in steps between its synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum and decarboxylation in the Golgi/vacuole (9.Trotter P.J. Wu W. Pedretti J.P. Yates R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13189-13196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Our goals in this study were to: 1) identify new Etn auxotrophs among mutagenized populations of strains with apsd1Δ::TRP1 allele, 2) characterize the Etn auxotrophs genetically and biochemically, and 3) identify and characterize the gene complementing the defect. In this report we identify a new strain, designated pstB2, with interesting properties in aminoglycerophospholipid metabolism. The strain is an Etn auxotroph with pronounced defects in phospholipid metabolism. The defects in lipid metabolism include the accumulation of high levels of PtdSer in the Golgi fraction and a light membrane fraction. The gene complementing the growth and biochemical defect encodes a protein of previously unknown biochemical function with structural similarity to the PtdIns/PtdCho transfer protein, Sec14p. All chemicals, including amino acids for yeast media, were purchased from either Sigma or Fisher Scientific. Other components for yeast and bacterial growth media were purchased from Difco. Phospholipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. Thin layer silica gel H plates were purchased from Analtech Corp. The radioisotopes [3-3H]serine and [1-14C]serine were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and ICN, respectively. The lipid 1-acyl,2-(6-[(7-nitro-2–1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]caproyl-Ptd-[1′-14C]Ser (referred to as NBD-Ptd-[1′-14C]Ser) was synthesized from [1-14C]serine and NBD-CDP-diacylglycerol usingEscherichia coli PtdSer synthase (14.Ohta A. Waggoner K. Louie K. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2219-2225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reagents for protein determination were either from Pierce or Bio-Rad. Pre-cast SDS-polyacrylamide gels were purchased either from NOVEX or FMC. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against the V5 epitope tag of the PstB2p fusion protein were obtained from Invitrogen. Other reagents used for ligand blotting were obtained from Bio-Rad and Sigma. Yeast were cultured in synthetic complete or YPDAUE (standard YPD medium plus additional adenine, uracil, and ethanolamine) media (9.Trotter P.J. Wu W. Pedretti J.P. Yates R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13189-13196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). When the PstB2p fusion protein was overexpressed in yeast under GAL1 promoter regulation, the cells were grown in uracil-free synthetic medium containing ethanolamine, with 2% galactose and 1% raffinose as the carbon sources. The parental strain, RYY52 (MATα lys2 trp1 ura3 his3 leu2 suc2 psd1Δ-1::TRP1), was constructed from the wild type strain, SEY6210 (MATα lys2 trp1 ura3 his3 leu2 suc2), as described previously (5.Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21416-21424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thepsd2Δ strain, PTY43 (MATa ura3 leu2 his3 trp1 ade2 suc2 psd2Δ-1::HIS3), used to examine complementation by the ethanolamine auxotrophs was constructed directly from wild typeSEY6211 (MATa ura3 leu2 his3 trp1 ade2 suc2) as described previously (8.Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Yates R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6071-6080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The pss mutant strain PTY70 (MATa his3 cho1–1) used to identify mutants carrying a defect inPSS by complementation analysis was obtained from a cross ofKA101, generously provided by Dr. Susan A. Henry (Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA) (12.Atkinson K.D. Fogel S. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6653-6661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with X1049 (Yeast Genetic Stock Center). In this paper we use the simplifying terminologyPSS and pss, respectively, to identify the wild type and mutant alleles of phosphatidylserine synthase in place of the original CHO1 and cho1 designations (15.Letts V.A.

ThepstB2 mutant strain, WWY54, was isolated as an ethanolamine auxotroph from the ethylmethane sulfonate-mutagenized (18.Lawrence C.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) parental strain RYY52. RYY57 and WWY71 are twopsd1Δ::TRP1 strains used to outcross the original pstB2 mutant. WWY71 was obtained from a cross between PTY40 (MATa ura3 his3 trp1 met14 psd1Δ-1::TRP1) and PTY41 (MATα ura3 leu2 trp1 his3 lys2 psd1Δ-1::TRP1). Thesec14 strain used was CTY1–1A (MATa ura3–52 Δhis3–200 lys2–801 s14–3 ts). The YCp50 yeast genomic library was generously provided by Dr. Vytas Bankaitis (University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL). The YEp352 plasmid was obtained from Dr. Alex Franzushoff (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO). The pUC18-HIS3 construct was a gift from Dr. Rodney Rothstein (Columbia University, NY). Yeast cell-free extract was prepared as described previously (9.Trotter P.J. Wu W. Pedretti J.P. Yates R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13189-13196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The total membranes were collected from the cell-free extract by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting membranes were resuspended using a Potter-Elvehjem device. The microsomes were also prepared from the cell-free extract by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min to remove dense membranes followed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to sediment the low density membranes. The protein concentrations of the total membranes and the microsomes were determined using a bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce) or the Bradford method (19.Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218584) Google Scholar). PSD2 activity was measured as described previously (8.Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Yates R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6071-6080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, the activity was assayed by trapping14CO2 released from NBD-Ptd (1′-14C]Ser on 2 m KOH-impregnated filter paper at 30 °C. PtdSer synthase activity was determined by monitoring the incorporation of either [3H]serine or [14C]serine into PtdSer as described by Carman and Bae-Lee (20.Carman G. Bae-Lee M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All strains were grown in synthetic complete medium plus ethanolamine at 30 °C until reaching mid-log phase. Cultures were then washed and diluted to an A 600 nm of 0.2 in a volume of 2 ml with synthetic complete medium (SC) containing 10 μCi/mll-[3H]serine (50 μCi/nmol). These cultures were incubated at 30 °C with shaking for 4 h. Trichloroacetic acid (5% (w/v) final concentration) was added to each culture at the end of the incubation, and cells were washed twice with ice-cold water. Lipids were isolated by ethanol extraction (21.Hanson B.A. Lester R.L. J. Lipid. Res. 1980; 21: 309-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) on Silica Gel H plates using a solvent system containing chloroform, methanol, 2-propanol, 0.25% KCl, triethylamine (30:9:25:6:18, v/v). Phospholipids were identified by co-chromatography with authentic standards and visualized by staining the TLC plates with 0.1% 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid and exposure to ultraviolet light. Individual lipid spots were scraped from the TLC plates into 0.5 ml of water plus 4.5 ml of scintillation mixture (Fisher Scientific). The radioactivity of each lipid sampled was determined in a liquid scintillation counter. The Etn auxotrophic mutant,pstB2, was transformed with a YCp50 yeast genomic library using the YEASTMAKER kit purchased from CLONTECH. Cells harboring plasmids were first selected for the presence of the plasmid marker, URA3, by growth on synthetic complete medium plus ethanolamine lacking uracil. The transformants were then screened for ethanolamine prototrophic growth on SC medium lacking uracil. The complementing plasmids were recovered from the positive transformants and amplified in E. coli as described previously (22.Strathern J.N. Higgins D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Amplified plasmids were isolated from the E. coli and retransformed into the pstB2 mutant to confirm their ability to complement the growth defect of the mutant strains. Further confirmation of the activity of the complementing plasmid was obtained from experiments that demonstrated concordant loss of Etn prototrophy and the linked plasmid uracil prototrophy. For plasmid loss studies, the pstB2 mutant carrying complementing plasmids was cultured under nonselective conditions for greater than 30 generations and then monitored for both ethanolamine and uracil auxotrophy. The original YCp50 PSTB2 clones were sequenced from both ends of the insert using primers that annealed to the plasmid sequences adjacent to opposite ends of the insertion site. Sequencing was performed utilizing the ABI prism Ready Dye Deoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit. Cycle sequencing products were purified with Centricep Spin Columns (Princeton Separations, Adelphia, NJ) and then analyzed on an ABI 377 automated sequencer at the Molecular Resource Center of the National Jewish Medical and Research Center. The resulting sequences were used to identify the genomic location of the insert by searching the S. cerevisiae Genome Data base (23.Cherry J.M. Adler C. Ball C. Chervitz S.A. Dwight S.S. Hester E.T. Jia Y. Juvik G. Roe T. Schroeder M. Weng S. Botstein D. Nucleic Acid Res. 1998; 26: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). Predicted open reading frames (ORFs) within the insert were either individually subcloned or subcloned as a cluster containing two to three ORFs into a YCp50 or YEp352 vector depending on the available restriction sites. The subclones were retransformed into the pstB2 mutant to test their complementation of the Etn auxotrophy. The pYES plasmid encoding a galactose inducible, V5His6epitope-tagged form of PstB2p (PstB2V5His6p) was obtained from Invitrogen and used for expression in yeast. A plasmid encoding the epitope-tagged version of the protein for expression in insect cells was constructed by excising the DNA encoding PstB2V5His6p from the pYES plasmid using SspI and XbaI restriction enzymes and ligating the fragment into PCR 2.1. Ligation of the DNA into PCR 2.1 was performed after A-tailing the insert with Taq polymerase. The desired insert was excised by EcoRI digestion and subsequently ligated into a pVL1392 vector for expression in Sf9 cells. The PSTB2 gene was disrupted in a YEp352 vector by inserting a 1.8-kb BamHI DNA fragment containing the HIS3 gene at the BclI site within the PSTB2 coding region. ThepstB2::HIS3 allele was removed from YEp352 bySacI/XbaI digestion and then subcloned into theE. coli vector pGEM4Z. The chromosomal PSTB2 gene was disrupted by one-step gene replacement (24.Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar) using the YEASTMAKER system (CLONTECH) with the linearSacI/XbaI fragment containingpstB2::HIS3 from the pGEM4Z plasmid construct. Recombinants were selected for the presence of His+prototrophy. The disruption of the chromosomal PSTB2 gene was confirmed by PCR (25.Mullis K.B. Faloona F.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 335-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3892) Google Scholar). Primers flanking the disruption or complementing theHIS3 marker gene were constructed such that the primer pairs annealed to the 5′- and 3′-end of the PSTB2 gene would yield a 1.9-kb fragment for the wild type allele, whereas the HIS3internal primer and the 3′-flanking primer of PSTB2 gene would result in a 1.5-kb fragment for the disrupted allele. The transforming DNA did not contain the sequence corresponding to the 5′- or the 3′-PCR primer to ensure that the appropriate PCR products could only be generated after integration into the PSTB2 locus. Genomic DNA was prepared from strains by standard methods (26.Philippsen P. Stotz A. Scherf C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), and the PCR reaction was performed using the Taq DNA polymerase in a Perkin-Elmer DNA Thermalcycler. Amplified fragments were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis and staining with ethidium bromide (27.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Both Sec14p and PstB2p were overexpressed as amino-terminal His6 fusion proteins under control of the lac operator in E. coli using a pQE30 vector (Qiagen). An E. coli lysate containing the fusion protein was prepared from isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced cells by sonicating in lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.3 m NaCl. 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm NaN3, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 7 μg/ml DNase I) on ice for a total of 3 min in 1 min bursts with 1 min pauses on ice between each burst. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min followed by a 30,000 ×g centrifugation for 20 min at 4 °C to obtain cytosol containing His6PstB2p or His6Sec14p. PtdIns and PtdSer transfer activity of the recombinant His6PstB2p was determined as described previously (28.Aitken J. van Heusden G.P.H. Temkin M. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4711-4717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Bankaitis V.A. Aitken J.R. Cleves A.E. Dowhan W. Nature. 1990; 347: 561-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The PSTB2 gene was expressed in yeast under the GAL1 promoter as a fusion protein with a V5His6 epitope at its 3′-end. Epitope-tagged PstB2p was expressed in the pstB2 strain grown in SC medium containing galactose and raffinose as the carbon sources. Cells were harvested at mid-log phase. For expression in Sf9 cells a pVL1392 construct harboring the coding sequence of PstB2V5His6p was cotransfected with BaculoGoldTM Autographa californica DNA (Pharmingen) into a monolayer of Sf9 cells using the CaCl2 method. The Sf9 cells were routinely grown in Trichoplusia ni medium (30.O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors. A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992: 109-215Google Scholar) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. General procedures for the growth, maintenance, and infection of Sf9 cells followed the methods described by O'Reilly et al. (30.O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors. A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992: 109-215Google Scholar). For expressing PstB2V5His6p, 4 × 107 Sf9 cells grown in 150-mm dishes were infected at a viral multiplicity of 10 for 60 h. The cells were gently scraped off the culture dish and collected by centrifugation at 4 °C. The harvested cells were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The final cell pellet was snap frozen over dry ice and stored at −80 °C. The uninfected Sf9 cells or cells infected with recombinant virus containing the S. cerevisiae DPP1 gene (31.Toke D.A. Bennett W.L. Dillon D.A. Wu W.-I. Chen X. Ostrander D.B. Oshiro J. Cremesti A. Voelker D.R. Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3278-3284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) were used as controls. The PstB2V5His6p expressed either in yeast or in Sf9 cells was detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting using the mouse monoclonal IgG directed against the V5 epitope. For yeast preparations, cytosols and membranes were isolated as described earlier, in a buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.3 msucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Sf9 cells were disrupted by probe sonication in an ice water bath for 15 s followed by a 30-s pause in ice water. The burst-pause cycle was repeated five times resulting in the suspension becoming translucent. This homogenate was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant (cytosol) was collected, and the pellet (membranes) was resuspended in the homogenization buffer. When yeast or Sf9 membranes were examined for membrane binding of PstB2V5His6p, the total membrane fractions were resuspended in homogenization buffer containing 2 m KCl at 4 °C for 1 h to strip off peripheral membrane proteins and subsequently centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. This washing step was repeated once before the resulting membrane pellet was resuspended in buffer without KCl. To test PSTB2V5His6p binding, the KCl- washed membranes were mixed with the appropriate yeast or Sf9 cytosols in a final volume of 200 μl of homogenization buffer. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, shifted to an ice bath, and finally subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g. The resultant membrane pellets were washed twice by resuspension in cold homogenization buffer and recentrifuged. The final membrane pellets were resuspended in the sample loading buffer for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immediately boiled, and then electrophoresed on an 8–16% Tris-glycine slab gel. Proteins separated on the gel were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblot analysis. An anti-V5 monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) was used for detection of the fusion protein and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse polyclonal antibody (Bio-Rad) was used as a secondary antibody. Color development of the immunoblot used a diaminobenzamidine substrate. The nitrocellulose blots were blocked for 30 min with 5% skim milk and 1% Triton X-100 in PBS and then incubated with monoclonal antibody in 1% skim milk in PBS buffer for 2 h. Unbound primary antibody was removed by washing the blot three times with blocking buffer. Secondary antibody was incubated with the blot for 1 h in blocking buffer followed by two washes with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The blot was washed two additional times in PBS and placed in a PBS solution containing 0.03% hydrogen peroxide and 0.1% (w/v) daminobenzidine. Color development was stopped by washing the blot with distilled water. In some experiments immunoreactive material was detected by chemilumenescence using a 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, solution containing 225 μm courmaric acid, 1.25 mm luminol, and 0.003% hydrogen peroxide. The His6 epitope-tagged Sec14p and PstB2p were detected in cytosolic fractions from E. coliusing high affinity anti-His6 antibody (CLONTECH). The cytosolic fractions were subjected to electrophoresis and ligand blotting as described above except that the anti-His6 antibody was used as the primary antibody. Permeabilized yeast cells were prepared as described previously (32.Achleitner G. Zweytick D. Trotter P.J. Voelker D.R. Daum G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29836-29842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). [3H]serine was incorporated into the permeabilized cells in a reaction volume of 3 ml including 8 mm HEPES, 22 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.6 mm MnCl2, 0.8 mm magnesium acetate, 60 mm potassium acetate, 0.1 m KCl, 8.5 mm β-chloro-alanine, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.4 mm MgCTP, 0.28 m sorbitol, 0.27 mmannitol, 50 μml-serine, 100 μCi of [3H]serine, and the permeabilized cells equivalent to 2.7 mg of protein. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 100 min and then immediately homogenized gently on ice with 15 strokes using the B pestle of a Dounce homogenizer. Cell debris was removed from the homogenate by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min. The supernatant (S1.5) was further centrifuged at 30,000 ×g for 15 min to remove dense membranes.

https://openalex.org/W2044097681,"Src homology 3 domain (SH3)-containing proline-rich protein kinase (SPRK)/mixed-lineage kinase (MLK)-3 is a serine/threonine kinase that upon overexpression in mammalian cells activates the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase pathway. The mechanisms by which SPRK activity is regulated are not well understood. The small Rho family GTPases, Rac and Cdc42, have been shown to bind and modulate the activities of signaling proteins, including SPRK, which contain Cdc42/Rac interactive binding motifs. Coexpression of SPRK and activated Cdc42 increases SPRKs activity. SPRKs Cdc42/Rac interactive binding-like motif contains six of the eight consensus residues. Using a site-directed mutagenesis approach, we show that SPRK contains a functional Cdc42/Rac interactive binding motif that is required for SPRKs association with and activation by Cdc42. However, experiments using a SPRK variant that lacks the COOH-terminal zipper region/basic stretch suggest that this region may also contribute to Cdc42 binding. Unlike the PAK family of protein kinases, we find that the activation of SPRK by Cdc42 cannot be recapitulated in an in vitro system using purified, recombinant proteins. Comparative phosphopeptide mapping demonstrates that coexpression of activated Cdc42 with SPRK alters the in vivo serine/threonine phosphorylation pattern of SPRK suggesting that the mechanism by which Cdc42 increases SPRKs catalytic activity involves a change in thein vivo phosphorylation of SPRK. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstrated example of a Cdc42-mediated change in the in vivo phosphorylation of a protein kinase. These studies suggest an additional component or cellular environment is required for SPRK activation by Cdc42.

Phosphorylation is rendered reversible in vivo by the action of protein phosphatases. Since phosphorylation is highly regulated in virtually all physiological processes, it follows that the activities of the protein kinases, themselves, should be highly regulated. Binding of activating or inhibitory molecules, including lipids, cyclic nucleotides, or proteins, can modulate the activity of protein kinases. In addition, post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and proteolysis, can regulate protein kinase activity. These regulatory events may alter the specific activity of a protein kinase or may change its stability. Finally, access to physiological substrates may be limited by restricted subcellular localization or translocation of a protein kinase. Small GTPases regulate certain protein kinases. For instance, by binding and recruiting the serine/threonine kinase Raf to the plasma membrane, GTP-bound, farnesylated Ras contributes to the activation of Raf, and consequently activates the extracellular-regulated protein kinase (ERK)1-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (1.Stokoe D.

One well characterized target of Cdc42 and Rac is the p21-activated kinase (PAK) (21.Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z. Lim L.

CRIB-dependent interaction of PAK with GTP-bound Rac/Cdc42 induces PAK autophosphorylation and activation both in vitro andin vivo. Diverse proteins, including the tyrosine kinase, activated Cdc42HS-associated kinase (ACK) (27.Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Tan L. Lim L.

Likewise, not all protein kinases which interact with Cdc42 and Rac do so through a CRIB motif. For instance, both the 70-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (30.Chou M.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1996; 85: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and MAPK kinase kinase-1 (31.Fanger G.R. Johnson N.L. Johnson G.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4961-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), which lack CRIB motifs, have been shown to interact with GTP-bound Cdc42 and Rac. Furthermore, MAPK kinase kinase-4 contains a modified CRIB motif whose deletion only partially diminishes binding to Cdc42 and Rac, indicative of a CRIB-independent GTPase binding determinant (31.Fanger G.R. Johnson N.L. Johnson G.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4961-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Thus the role of CRIB motifs and the mechanisms by which many protein kinases are activated by small GTPases remains largely unexplored. Src homology 3 domain (SH3)-containing proline-rich protein kinase (SPRK) (35.Gallo K.A. Mark M.R. Scadden D.T. Wang Z. Gu Q. Godowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15092-15100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also called mixed-lineage kinase-3 (MLK-3) (36.Ing Y.L. Leung I.W.L. Heng H.H.Q. Tsui L.-C. Lassam N.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1745-1750PubMed Google Scholar), or protein-tyrosine kinase-1 (37.Ezoe K. Lee S.T. Strunk K.M. Spritz R.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 935-938PubMed Google Scholar), is a member of the so-called “mixed-lineage” kinases. SPRK contains a CRIB motif bearing six of the eight consensus amino acids, as well as other domains that may mediate protein-protein interactions including an NH2-terminal SH3 domain, a leucine/isoleucine zipper motif, and a large COOH-terminal region that is rich in serine, threonine, and proline residues (Fig. 1). Upon overexpression in mammalian cell lines SPRK activates c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activating protein kinase through phosphorylation and activation of the dual specific kinase, MAPK kinase-4 (MKK-4/SEK1) (38.Rana A.

Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), and binds the JNK scaffold proteins, JNK interacting protein (JIP)-1 and JIP-2 (39.Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C.

Biol. 1999; 19: 7245-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). In some cell types, SPRK has been reported to activate the MAPK p38/reactivating kinase via MKK-3/6 (40.Tibbles L.A. Ing Y.L. Kiefer F. Chan J. Iscove N. Woodgett J.R. Lassam N.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7026-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) as well as ERK (41.Hartkamp J. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2195-2202PubMed Google Scholar). SPRK associates with Rac and Cdc42 in filter binding assays (26.Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) and coexpression of SPRK, activated Cdc42, and JNK increases SPRK and JNK activity (42.Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Miyata H. Igishi T. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27225-27228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Whether activation by Cdc42 of the distantly related PAK and SPRK involves mechanistically analogous processes is unknown. SPRK is functionally homologous to Raf, and thus mechanistic aspects of Cdc42-SPRK and Ras-Raf activation may be shared. Here we show that SPRK contains a functional CRIB motif that is absolutely required for Cdc42 binding to and activation of SPRK. The zipper region and adjacent basic sequences of SPRK may also contribute to Cdc42 binding. Binding of Cdc42 to SPRK does not require SPRK catalytic activity. Interestingly, GTP-bound Cdc42 has no effect on the activity of purified, catalytically active SPRK, suggesting that an additional cellular component is required for kinase activation. These studies point to an important distinction between PAK and SPRK in the mode of GTPase-induced kinase activation. Comparative phosphopeptide mapping revealed that coexpression of activated Cdc42 with SPRK alters thein vivo phosphorylation sites on SPRK. This change in serine/threonine phosphorylation correlates with increased SPRK activity. These studies represent the first case where a Cdc42-mediated change in the in vivo phosphorylation sites of a protein kinase has been documented and provide evidence for the involvement ofin vivo phosphorylation of SPRK for Cdc42-induced activation. Thus, the Cdc42-mediated activation of SPRK is clearly distinct from the mechanism previously described for Cdc42-induced activation of PAK. Construction of the cytomegalovirus-based expression vectors carrying the cDNAs for wild type SPRK (pRK5-sprk), and for the kinase-defective variant of SPRK (pRK5-sprk K144A) has been described elsewhere (35.Gallo K.A. Mark M.R. Scadden D.T. Wang Z. Gu Q. Godowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15092-15100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression plasmids encoding NH2-terminal Flag epitope-tagged wild type Cdc42 (pRK5-Nflag.cdc42) and the constitutively active variant (pRK5-Nflag.cdc42 Val-12) of Cdc42 were kindly provided by Avi Ashkenazi (Genentech, Inc.). Variants of SPRK containing point mutations in the CRIB motif were constructed by a modified recombinant polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method described in detail elsewhere (45.Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1990: 177-183Google Scholar). For each mutation two different PCRs were performed, one containing a left mutagenesis primer and a left outside primer, and one containing a right mutagenesis primer and a right outside primer. The left and right outside primers used for all mutations were 5′-GATGAGTCATCTGAATCCAGG-3′ and 5′-CTGTGGCCTATGGCGTAGCTG-3′, respectively. To obtain the three different CRIB mutants the following left and right mutagenesis primers were used, respectively: SPRK F498A, 5′-GGTGCTTGGCGTCGAGTGGCAT-3′ and 5′-ACTCGACGCCAAGCACCGCATC-3′; SPRK H500A, 5′-CTTCAAGGCCCGCATCACCGT-3′ and 5′-GGTGATGCGGGCCTTGAAGTCG-3′; SPRK I492A/S493A, 5′-GAAGTCGAGTGGCATGGCGGCACGCTCG-3′ and 5′-CGAGCGTGCCGCCATGCCACTCGAC-3′. The presence of the desired mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing using the Sanger method, and the absence of PCR-introduced errors was verified by automated sequencing. Deletion of amino acids 430 through 486 of SPRK to yield SPRKΔzip was accomplished by digestion of the expression vector pRK5-sprkwith BssHII, followed by ligation with T4 DNA ligase. DNA modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs or Life Technologies, Inc. AnNcoI-HindIII fragment, containing the full-length SPRK cDNA, was subcloned from pRK5-sprk into the pFastBac HTb baculovirus expression vector (Life Technologies, Inc.) which contains a hexahistidine tag. Recombinant histidine-tagged SPRK was expressed in Sf21 cells and purified by nickel affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's protocol. Fractions containing histidine-tagged SPRK, as determined by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining, were pooled and concentrated using a Centriprep concentrator (Amicon). Human fetal kidney 293 cells were maintained in Ham's F-12/low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (1:1) (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mmglutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Plasmids (5 μg each for 60-mm dishes; 10 μg each for 100-mm dishes) were used to transfect 293 cells using the calcium phosphate technique (46.Gorman C. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Washington, D. C.1990: 143-190Google Scholar). Cell monolayers were incubated with the DNA precipitate for 4 h, then washed once with PBS (phosphate-buffered saline), and cultured in the medium described above. After 18 h cells were harvested. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed for 5 min on ice by the addition of 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm Na4PPi, 100 μmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.15 units/ml aprotinin). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 4 °C. Rabbit polyclonal antiserum was raised against a peptide corresponding to the COOH-terminal 8 amino acids of SPRK and was purified by Protein A-Sepharose chromatography. Antibodies against the proteins of interest were prebound to Protein A-agarose beads (SPRK antiserum (0.25 μg/μl slurry), M2 monoclonal antibody (Kodak IBI) directed against the Flag epitope (0.45 μg/μl slurry), and JNK C-17 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (50 ng/μl slurry)) as described previously (35.Gallo K.A. Mark M.R. Scadden D.T. Wang Z. Gu Q. Godowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15092-15100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clarified lysate (300 μl) was incubated with 20 μl of antibody-bound Protein A-agarose for 90 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed with HNTG buffer (20 mmHEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol). Immunoprecipitates used for kinase assays were washed three times with HNTG buffer containing 1 m LiCl, three times with HNTG buffer, and twice with kinase assay buffer (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmMnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm Na3VO4). Lysates and immunoprecipitates of SPRK and Cdc42 were resolved by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (47.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted using either SPRK antiserum (1 μg/ml) or M2 Flag monoclonal antibody (9 μg/ml), followed by the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Life Technologies, Inc.). Western blots were developed by chemiluminescence. Multiple exposures of the Western blots were developed, and densitometry (NIH Image) of unsaturated films was used to determine relative expression levels. Statistics were compiled using an unpaired Student's t test. A p value smaller than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Kinase assays were performed in 20 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 50 μm ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) (NEN Life Science Products). For the SPRK kinase assay 10 μg of mixed histones (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used as the substrate and the reaction was carried out for 30 min at room temperature. Independent experiments showed that the reaction was linear within this time range. The reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 2 × SDS sample buffer (100 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 1% β-mercaptoethanol) containing 50 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). For the kinase assays involving purified kinases, recombinant SPRK or PAK-2 (1 and 2 μg, respectively) was incubated in 50 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 4 μg of GST (glutathioneS-transferase)-Cdc42 that had been preloaded with GTPγS or GDP and assay was performed as above. GST-Cdc42 (19 μm) was preloaded with GTPγS or GDP (4 mm) in buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The mixture was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. The nucleotide loading reaction was quenched by the addition of 10 mm MgCl2. Purified GST-Cdc42 was obtained from an Escherichia coli overexpression system; and purified PAK-2, obtained using the baculovirus expression system, was kindly provided by Dr. Arie Abo (Onyx Pharmaceuticals) (23.Martin G.A. Bollag G. McCormick F. Abo A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1970-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). For the JNK assays, 8 μg of GST-c-Jun was used as the substrate, and the reaction was carried out for 15 min at room temperature. The pGEX-c-Jun (1–115) vector was kindly provided by Dr. Ajay Rana (Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). GST-c-Jun was expressed in XL-1 Blue E. coli and purified by glutathione-Sepharose chromatography. Following the kinase assay, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were rinsed in PBS, dried, and incorporation of radioactivity into kinase or substrates was determined by PhophorImaging (Molecular Dynamics). To detect JNK expression, proteins were transferred from an SDS-polyacrylamide gel to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and immunoblotted using the JNK C-17 antibody (0.5 μg/ml). The predicted leucine zipper coiled coil domain of the SPRK cDNA encoding amino acids 386–477 was generated by PCR amplification of the pRK5-sprk plasmid using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-TCAGAATTCGGATCCGAAATGCCGCGGGACTCCTTC-3′ and 5′-ATTGAAGCTTCATGTCCCGCGGCGGCGGCG-3′. The leucine zipper fragment was cloned into the pMAL-c2 vector (New England Biolabs) at theEcoRI and HindIII sites, in-frame with themalE gene, which encodes the monomeric maltose-binding protein (MBP). An MBP control construct was generated using the following linker oligonucleotides encoding a stop codon: 5′-AATTCGGATCCTAATAGCGA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTCGCTATTAG GATCCG-3′. The first of these oligonucleotides was phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase. The two oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated into the pMAL-c2 vector which had been digested withEcoRI and HindIII. Both constructs were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing using Sequenase enzyme (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DH5α derivatives of E. coli containing the recombinant plasmids were grown at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and 2% glucose. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.3 mm isopropylthiogalactoside for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 20 min. Cells were lysed by two passes through a French pressure cell. MBP proteins were purified by amylose affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's protocol. Fractions containing the MBP-zips or MBP, as determined by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining, were pooled and concentrated to about 1 mg/ml using a Centriprep concentrator (Amicon). One day following transfection of 293 cells with cDNAs encoding SPRK and SPRKΔzip, the cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer as described above. Amylose resin (30 μl) was incubated with 10 μg of purified MBP or MBP-zips for 60 min at 4 °C, and then washed twice with column buffer (20 mmTris (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). Cellular lysate from transfected 293 cells (200 μl) was added to the amylose resin and incubated at 4 °C with mixing for 90 min. After removal of the lysate, the resin was washed twice with HNTG buffer. The binding of SPRK or SPRKΔzip to MBP or MBP-zips was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using the SPRK antiserum. Coomassie Blue staining verified equal amounts of MBP-containing proteins in the assays. After a 24-h transfection with pRK5-sprk in the presence or absence of pRK5-Nflag.cdc42 Val-12, 293 cells were washed five times with phosphate-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Summit Biotechnology)), and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The cells were then incubated in phosphate-free medium containing 3 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (carrier free; NEN Life Science Products) for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed five times with ice-cold PBS and then lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 15 min at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 4 °C. SPRK was immunoprecipitated with SPRK antiserum as described above. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Radiolabeled bands that comigrated with SPRK, as judged by Western blotting, were excised from the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After washing three times with methanol and three times with water, the radioactive piece of membrane was blocked with 1 ml of 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidine-360 (Sigma) containing 100 mm acetic acid for 30 min at 37 °C, and then washed five times with water. Tryptic digestion was performed with 10 μg of sequencing grade trypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 2 h in 200 μl of 50 mmNH4HCO3 (pH 8.3) at 37 °C. An additional 10 μg of trypsin was added and the digestion mixture was incubated for an additional 2 h at 37 °C. The membrane was then sonicated for 3 min in 300 μl of water to remove additional tryptic peptides. The solution containing the released tryptic peptides was concentrated in a SpeedVac (Savant Instruments). The peptides were separated on cellulose thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates (Kodak, 20 × 20 cm) by thin layer electrophoresis (TLE) in the first dimension in pH 1.9 buffer (formic acid (88% w/v)/glacial acetic acid/water, 25:78:897, v/v) at 0 °C and 1000 V for 30 min, and separated in the second dimension by TLC in phosphochromatography buffer (n-butanol/pyridine/glacial acetic acid/water, 15:10:3:12, v/v). The radiolabeled phosphopeptides were visualized and quantitated using a PhosphorImager. The tryptic peptides were hydrolyzed in 200 μl of 6 m HCl for 1 h at 100 °C. The phosphoamino acids were concentrated in a SpeedVac. Unlabeled phosphoamino acid standards (Sigma) and xylene cyanol FF marker dye (Sigma) were added to each sample. The phosphoamino acids were separated by one-dimensional TLE in pH 2.5 buffer (66.7% pH 3.5 buffer (glacial acetic acid/pyridine/water, 50:5:945, v/v) and 33.3% pH 1.9 buffer on cellulose TLC plates at 0 °C and 500 V for 1.5 h. Unlabeled phosphoamino acid standards were visualized by ninhydrin staining and the 32P-labeled phosphoamino acids derived from the SPRK peptides were visualized by PhosphorImaging. Recently Hall and co-workers have shown that several proteins, including SPRK, associate with GTP-bound Cdc42 and Rac in filter binding assays (26.Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). All of these proteins contain a 14–16-amino acid sequence that includes eight consensus residues, which has been coined the CRIB motif. The CRIB motif of SPRK contains six of the eight consensus amino acids (Fig.2). In this study we examined the structural requirements and mechanism of Cdc42 binding and activation of SPRK. SPRK and Flag epitope-tagged Cdc42 expression vectors were transiently transfected in 293 cells. To mimic the GTP-bound state of Cdc42 we used a constitutively active mutant of the GTPase, i.e.Cdc42Val-12. Cellular lysates from 293 cells were immunoprecipit"
https://openalex.org/W2043952964,"We have cloned a new P2X ligand-gated ion channel receptor from embryonic chick skeletal muscle, which is tentatively named as chick P2X8 (cP2X8) receptor. The cloned cDNA encodes a protein with 402 amino acids. Electrophysiological study of the recombinant cP2X8receptor expressed in Xenopus oocytes showed that 10 μm ATP induced a fast inward current followed by rapid and long lasting desensitization in medium containing 1.8 mm Ca2+. In medium with 0.3 mmCa2+ ATP induced a bi-phasic response as follows: a slower inward current succeeded the initial fast one. 2-Methylthio-ATP, α,β-methylene-ATP, and adenosine 5′-O-(thio)triphosphate were potent agonists, whereas ADP was a very weak agonist. ATP-induced currents were blocked by 100 μm suramin and pyridoxal phosphate 6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid. Northern blot analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed that cP2X8RNA transcripts were mainly expressed in skeletal muscle, brain, and heart of Day 10 chick embryos. A moderate level of expression was also detected in gizzard and retina. Whole mount in situhybridization showed that cP2X8 RNA transcripts were expressed mainly in neurotube, notochord, and stomach in Day 3 embryos. In Day 4 and Day 6 embryos, the cP2X8 RNA transcripts were highly expressed in the myotome and premuscle mass. The physiological role of this receptor in the establishment of the skeletal muscle innervation will be studied.

J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1975; 247: 145-162Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and potentiates the acetylcholine-induced response in adult neuromuscular junction (2.Ewald D.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1976; 29: 47-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 3.Akasu T. Hirai K. Koketsu K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1981; 74: 505-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), although the underlying mechanism is not yet fully understood. It has been observed that external application of ATP can induce cation influx and increase of intracellular Ca2+ concentration (4.Henning R.H. Duin M. van Popta J.P. Nelemans A. den Hertog A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 1785-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The latter is partially due to the release of calcium from intracellular stores via second messenger mechanisms. In cultured chick myotubes, ATP was reported to induce the formation of inositol triphosphate via a G protein-coupled receptor (5.Häggblad J. Heilbronn E. Neurosci. Lett. 1987; 74: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In mouse C2C12 myotubes, P2Y receptor subtypes mediated activation of the phospholipase C pathway (6.Henning R.H. Duin M. den Hertog A. Nelemans A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 747-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and the formation of cAMP (7.Henning R.H. Duin M. den Hertog A. Nelemans A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The expression of cP2Y1 subtype has been demonstrated in chick myotome (8.Meyer M.P. Clarke J.D.W. Patel K. Townsend-Nicholson A. Burnstock G. Dev. Dyn. 1999; 214: 152-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Apart from the P2Y receptor-mediated responses via G proteins, ATP was reported to activate cation channels in cultured chick myoblasts and myotubes (9.Kolb H.-A. Wakelam M.J.O. Nature. 1983; 303: 621-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A detailed study by Hume and Honig (10.Hume R.I. Honig M.G. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 681-690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that ATP induced depolarization and contraction in chick myotubes. However, the depolarization declined during prolonged application of ATP and did not recover for at least 20 min after the removal of ATP. This was recognized as a unique feature of this P2X receptor and has not been observed previously for the known P2X receptor subtypes. A study on the contractile responses of embryonic skeletal muscle to ATP during development revealed that the response disappeared after Day 17 (11.Wells D.G. Zawisa M.J. Hume R.I. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, denervation of the muscle in newly hatched chicks led to the reappearance of ATP responsiveness, which suggests that the expression of ATP receptors is regulated by innervation. So far, cDNAs for seven P2X receptor subtypes (or subunits) have been cloned (12.Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). All known P2X receptor subunits can form functional homomeric ATP-gated ion channels (13.Buell G. Collo G. Rassendren F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 2221-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The seven P2X receptor subtypes have different tissue distributions. For example, P2X3 and P2X2 receptor subtypes are highly expressed in sensory neurons (14.Vulchanova L. Riedl M.S. Shuster S.J. Buell G. Surprenant A. North R.A. Elde R. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1229-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 15.Xiang Z. Bo X. Burnstock G. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 256: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), whereas the P2X1 and P2X2receptor subtypes appear to be the main ones in smooth muscle cells (16.Vulchanova L. Arvidsson U. Riedl M. Wang J. Buell G. Surprenant A. North R.A. Elde R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8063-8067Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 17.Bo X. Sexton A. Xiang Z. Nori S.L.

Res. 1998; 35: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In adult skeletal muscle, most P2X receptor subtypes were reported absent, although a moderate level of P2X7 mRNA was detected in human skeletal muscle using Northern blot hybridization (19.Rassendren F. Buell G.N. Virginio C. Collo G. North R.A. Surprenant A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5482-5486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). A human P2XM receptor, which shares 80% identity with rat P2X6 receptor, was reported to be predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle (20.Urano T. Nishimori H. Han H.J. Furuhata T. Kimura Y. Makamura Y. Tokino T. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3281-3287PubMed Google Scholar). However, no functional study has been carried out on this subtype. The pharmacological character of the ATP-induced response in chick embryonic skeletal muscle, i.e. the prolonged desensitization, is not present in any of the cloned P2X receptors, suggesting the existence of another P2X receptor subtype in this tissue. This receptor subtype may play an important role in establishment of the skeletal muscle innervation. Therefore, it is of great interest to clone and characterize this receptor subtype and study its role in skeletal muscle innervation. Skeletal muscles from the leg and chest of six Day 10 White Leghorn chick embryos were isolated and pooled. The FastTrack 2.0 kit (Invitrogen BV, Leek, The Netherlands) was used to isolate the poly(A)+mRNA according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two degenerated oligonucleotide primers (sense, ACCTGTGAGATSTBKRSYTGGTGCCC, and antisense, ARTRHKTGGCDRWCCTGAARTTGTASC) based on the sequences of the seven cloned rat P2X receptors were designed and ordered from Sigma. First strand cDNAs were synthesized with oligo(dT) and random primers using Superscript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Touch-down PCR was performed on the first strand cDNAs using the degenerated primers. The annealing temperature was reduced from 65 to 55 °C in 20 cycles (−0.5 °C per cycle) and a further 30 cycles were run at an annealing temperature of 55 °C. PCR fragments of the predicted sizes were purified and subcloned into pCR II using TOPO TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen BV) and sequenced with a cycle sequencing kit and ABI 377 sequencer from Applied Biosystems Inc. A cDNA library construction kit from Stratagene Europe (The Netherlands) was used. cDNAs were synthesized from 5 μg of poly(A)+ mRNA and inserted into Lambda ZAP II vectors that contain the sequence of pBluescript SK(−) phagemid vector. The total plaque-forming units obtained was 5.77 × 106 with insert sizes ranging from 0.7 to 9 kb (estimate of 20 excised inserts from randomly selected clones). the cDNA library was screened with 32P-labeled probe derived from the PCR fragment. The probe was labeled using Prime-IT II kit (Stratagene Europe, The Netherlands), and unincorporated nucleotides were removed with a QIAquick Nucleotides Removal kit (Qiagen Ltd., Crawley, UK). Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C in a buffer containing 20% formamide. Low stringency washing was controlled by the final wash in 1× SSPE at 45 °C. Positive clones were subjected to secondary screening. Totally isolated clones were obtained, and the phagemid pBluesrcipt SK(−) containing cDNA inserts was excised from Lambda ZAP II vector with a helper phage and transformed intoEscherichia coli for amplification. cDNA inserts were sequenced in both directions. cRNA was synthesized as run-off transcripts. Xenopus oocytes (stage V) were isolated and treated with collagenase (type V, Sigma) (33 μg/ml, shaken lightly for 45 min at room temperature). Oocytes were then defolliculated manually and injected (Drummond Injector) with 23 nl of cRNA (approximately 5 μg/ml). The oocytes were incubated in modified Barth's solution (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.33 mmCa(NO3)2, 0.82 mmMgSO4, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, supplemented with 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin) at 19 °C for 2 days. Injected oocytes were analyzed in the two-electrode voltage clamp configuration (TEC05 amplifier, NPI Electronics, Tamm, Germany) perfused with NFR (115 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, supplemented with 1.8 mm CaCl2 unless otherwise noted). Data were recorded simultaneously to a chart recorder and to a computer hard disc (CELLworks, NPI Electronics, Tamm, Germany). For chart-like digital data recording, data were typically filtered at 100 Hz, digitized at 300 Hz (oversampling), and reduced to 5 Hz before storage. Application of perfusion solutions as well as clamp voltage was computer-controlled. Poly(A)+ mRNAs were isolated from fresh tissues of Day 10 chick embryos using the FastTrack 2.0 kit from Invitrogen. Poly(A)+ mRNAs (3 μg) were size-separated through a 1.5% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and transferred onto nylon membranes (Hybond N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A 400-bp cDNA fragment starting from the start cordon was radiolabeled as described above and used as probe. Hybridization was carried out in a buffer with 50% formamide overnight at 42 °C, and the stringency was controlled by a final wash of the membrane in 0.3× SSPE at 65 °C. The membrane was exposed to x-ray film for 3 days. The first strand cDNAs were synthesized with Superscript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) from 0.8 μg of poly(A)+ mRNAs. A sense primer with the sequence of CATGCCATGGGGCAGGTGTCCTGGAAG and an antisense primer with a sequence of GGCTTGGATCTTTTCTCCAC were used to amplify the cDNAs. PCR was performed using the touch-down method with an initial annealing temperature of 70 °C and a drop of 0.5 °C per cycle (10 cycles for the first stage). The second stage was performed with an annealing temperature of 65 °C for 20 cycles. After PCR reaction, 10 μl of reaction mixture was withdrawn and run in a 1.5% agarose gel. The first 530 bp of the cDNA open reading frame was subcloned into pCRII vector (Invitrogen). Both sense and antisense cRNA probes were synthesized with the DIG-RNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Day 3, Day 4, and Day 6 chick embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. Whole mount in situ hybridization was performed according to the protocol described by Nieto et al. (21.Nieto M.A. Patel K. Wilkinson D.G. Methods Cell Biol. 1996; 51: 219-235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prehybridization was carried out in a buffer containing 50% formamide at 55 °C for 4 h, followed by overnight hybridization at 55 °C for Day 3 and Day 4 embryos and 3 days for Day 6 embryos. Final wash was in 2× SSC with 50% formamide at 55 °C twice for 60 min. Hybridization signals were revealed with anti-DIG-alkaline phosphatase antibody staining (DigNucleic acid detection kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Whole embryos were photographed and then embedded in gelatin-albumin gel. Sections of the embryos (100 μm thick) were cut with a vibratome. RT-PCR with degenerated primers produced a cDNA fragment of 421 bp. Alignment of this cDNA fragment with the cloned P2X receptors showed that it was related to this receptor family. Screening of an embryonic chick skeletal muscle cDNA library identified three full-length cDNA clones with 4308 bp (including the poly(A)+ tail) (Fig.1). The open reading frame encodes a protein of 402 amino acids. The calculated molecular mass of the protein is 45.1 kDa. We have tentatively named this protein chick P2X8 (cP2X8) receptor. The cP2X8receptor sequence has the two putative transmembrane domains, and the 10 conserved cysteine residues in the extracellular loop are considered as characteristics for this gene family. The identity of the amino acid sequence of cP2X8 with other cloned rat P2X receptors is 43% for P2X1, 39% for P2X2, 43% for P2X3, 53% for P2X4, 59% for P2X5, 47% for P2X6, and 24% for P2X7. The low percentage of identity of cP2X8 with other P2X receptors indicates this receptor is a new member of the P2X receptor family. Rat P2X5 receptor (22.Collo G. North R.A. Kawashima E. Merlo-Pich E. Neidhart S. Surprenant A. Buell G. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2495-2507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a partial human P2X receptor which was believed to be the human homologue of rP2X5 (23.Lê K.-T. Paquet M. Nouel D. Babinski K. Séguéla P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) are two of the closest to cP2X8 among the cloned P2X receptors. The alignment of their amino acid sequences is shown in Fig.2. The percentage of identity of cP2X8 with hP2X5 is 59% by direct alignment; however, the percentage should be increased to 62% if the missing segment in hP2X5 is excluded.Figure 2Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of cP2X8 receptor with rP2X5 and hP2X5 receptors. The two putative transmembrane domains are indicated by bars underneath. The 10 conserved cysteines on the extracellular loop are marked by *.

Application of 10 μm ATP induced a large and fast inward current with an average amplitude of 600 nA, which fully desensitized the receptors (Fig.3 A). The desensitization of cP2X8 receptor showed a prolonged period for recovery (run-down), only 7% of initial amplitude in 5 min after the removal of ATP, 31% in 30 min, and 65% in 1 h (Fig. 3 A). Therefore, it was impossible to build a concentration-response curve of ATP and calculate the EC50 value. Application of a lower concentration of ATP, such as 0.1 μm, could induce a small inward current of about 20–30 nA, which was also followed by significant run-down. Replacement of Ca2+ in the perfusion buffer with Ba2+ did not change the character of the ATP-induced inward currents. However, when the Ca2+ concentration in the perfusion buffer was reduced from 1.8 to 0.6 or 0.3 mm, the oocytes became unstable. Application of ATP in 0.3 mmCa2+ medium for 90 s produced a bi-phasic response curve, an initial fast depolarization, and partial desensitization followed by a slow increase of inward current. The current slowly recovered after the removal of ATP but remained below the rest level until restoration of 1.8 mm Ca2+ medium (Fig.3 B). If ATP was not removed, the current continued to increase, and finally the oocyte died. In addition to ATP, several other ATP receptor active compounds were also tested. The average amplitude of inward currents induced by 10 μm 2-methylthioATP was about the same as that by ATP. α,β-Methylene-ATP and ATPγS were also potent agonists, but at 10 μm the inward currents induced by these two compounds were smaller than that by ATP (Fig. 3 C). ADP at 100 μm produced a very small, but detectable, inward current (data not shown). β,γ-Methylene-ATP, UTP, GTP, TTP, AMP, adenosine, and diadenosine tetraphosphate did not produce detectable responses at concentrations up to 100 μm. Suramin and PPADS, both at 100 μm, did not cause any detectable response in oocytes expressing cP2X8 receptors. However, they almost completely blocked ATP-induced currents (Fig.3 D). The presence of expressed cP2X8 receptors in the oocytes was confirmed by the appearance of ATP responsiveness 15 min after the removal of the antagonists. PPADS at 1 μmwas able to block partially the ATP-induced currents, whereas 10 μm PPADS produced significant blockade. Nevertheless, it is not possible to calculate the IC50 values of antagonists due to the prolonged desensitization. Northern blot hybridization analysis revealed the expression of cP2X8 RNA transcripts of about 4.3–4.6 kb in Day 10 chick embryos tissues (Fig.4 A). The skeletal muscle and brain showed the highest level of expression, followed by heart, retina, and gizzard. No band was detectable in the lane loaded with liver mRNA. RT-PCR assays revealed a similar pattern of expression (Fig. 4 B). However, a very low level of cP2X8RNA was detected in the liver. Whole mount in situ hybridization on Day 3, Day 4, and Day 6 chick embryos showed discrete distribution of cP2X8 RNA transcripts (Fig. 5). In Day 3 embryo, the hybridization signals were observed in the brain and the ventral part of the neural tube. They were also present in retina, notochord, stomach, duodenum, and heart (Fig. 5, panel I). In Day 4 embryos, the hybridization signals were still present in the structures shown in Day 3 embryos (Fig. 5, panel II). However, the distinctive difference was the appearance of myotome, which was labeled by the probe (Fig. 5, panel II, C and D). In Day 6 embryos, the hybridization signal in myotome was still strong (Fig. 5, panel III). Premuscle mass appeared in the wing bud, which showed high level expression of cP2X8 receptor RNA. The hybridization signal was no longer obvious in the neural tube, and no signal was detectable in the notochord at this stage (Fig. 5,panel III, D). In parallel experiments using sense probes, no hybridization signal was detected in the embryos. Although seven P2X receptor subtypes have been cloned, previous electrophysiological and pharmacological studies indicated the existence of another subtype in the embryonic chick skeletal muscle cells (10.Hume R.I. Honig M.G. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 681-690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Wells D.G. Zawisa M.J. Hume R.I. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this study, we have cloned a new P2X cDNA from embryonic chick skeletal muscle. We propose to name the novel P2X receptor cloned from chick embryos in this study as cP2X8receptor. Recombinant cP2X8 receptor showed a pharmacological behavior that matches that observed in isolated chick myotubes. The deduced amino acid sequence of this receptor protein shares the common features of the P2X receptor family, like the presence of two putative transmembrane domains and the 10 conserved cysteine residues on the extracellular loop. The cP2X8receptor has a low identity of amino acid sequence with most other members of the P2X receptor family, which is another feature of P2X receptor family. Although hP2XM was reported to be highly expressed in skeletal muscle, it shares only 44% identity with the cP2X8 receptor. In 1998, a mouse P2XM homologue was reported (24.Nawa G. Urano T. Tokino T. Ochi T. Miyoshi Y. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 43: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) which shares an identity of 93% with the rat P2X6 receptor, and they are quite likely to be P2X6 receptor homologues. We have also cloned a chick P2X4 cDNA at the same time from the same chick embryonic skeletal muscle cDNA library, 2X. Bo, R. Schoepfer, and G. Burnstock, manuscript in preparation. which is identical to the one recently cloned from embryonic chick heart (25.Ruppelt A. Liang B.T. Soto F. Prog. Brain Res. 1999; 120: 81-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The chick P2X4 and rat P2X4 receptors share an identity of 75%, suggesting that the difference between avian and mammalian P2X receptor homologues should be close to this percentage. The cP2X8 receptor shares an identity of 59% with rP2X5. The polypeptide chain of cP2X8 receptor protein is significantly shorter than rP2X5 (402versus 445 amino acids). The most striking difference in amino acid sequences between these two receptor subtypes lies in the C termini, where they share almost no homology. If the C termini were excluded, the percentage of identity would be increased to 70%, which does raise the question whether cP2X8 is a homologue of rP2X5. However, it should be noted that the C termini of P2X receptors are the most variable parts among the subtypes, which may play an important role in designating the differences among the subtypes. Taken together, the significant differences in their polypeptide length, in their C-terminal sequences, in the electrophysiological and pharmacological characteristics of the recombinant receptors, and in their tissue distribution pattern indicate that cP2X8 is not a homologue of rP2X5. The cP2X8 receptor shares 62% identity with hP2X5 if the missing exon is excluded. In a sense, cP2X8 is slightly closer to hP2X5 than to rP2X5. The C-terminal of cP2X8 is 42 amino acids shorter than that of hP2X5 and shares 21% identity (40% if the extra 42 amino acids are excluded), which may result in quite different electrophysiological and pharmacological properties in these two receptor proteins. As a full-length functional hP2X5 receptor has not been cloned, the comparison of their electrophysiological and pharmacological characteristics cannot be carried out. It should be noted that hP2X5 and rP2X5receptors also have significantly different C termini. For other P2X subtypes like P2X1, P2X3, P2X4, and P2X7 receptors, the rat and human homologues have the same number of amino acids in their polypeptide chains and share identities of 80–93%. Their C termini also share a high level of identity ranging from 75 to 88%. hP2X5 also have a different pattern of tissue distribution from rP2X5. It would be interesting to see whether a real hP2X5 exists or not. It is possible that rP2X5, hP2X5, and cP2X8 receptors are all derived from the same ancient gene. During evolution, alternative splicing has created three receptors with significantly different C termini, and consequently, they have acquired different electrophysiological and pharmacological properties and have different tissue distribution and biological functions. Further cloning and genomic structure analysis of P2X receptors in different species will shed more light on this issue. Recombinant cP2X8 receptors expressed in Xenopusoocytes showed rapid desensitization after being activated by ATP. They were also sensitive to α,β-methylene-ATP and could be blocked by suramin and PPADS. These features are quite similar to those of rP2X1 and rP2X3 and can be included in one subgroup of the P2X receptor family. rP2X5 and rP2X2 subtypes share many common features like α,β-methylene-ATP insensitivity, non-desensitization, and blockade by suramin and PPADS. These two members may be included in another subgroup, whereas P2X4 and P2X6 subtypes fall into a third group (insensitivity to α,β-methylene-ATP, non-blockade by suramin and PPADS, and partial desensitization). A unique feature of cP2X8 receptor is its prolonged period of recovery from desensitization. A similar phenomenon was observed by Hume and Honig (10.Hume R.I. Honig M.G. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 681-690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) when studying the ATP-induced currents in chick embryonic myotubes. In a later study, it was found that a full recovery of ATP responsiveness took 7 h at 37 °C (26.Thomas S.A. Hume R.I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1990; 430: 373-388Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Preincubation of myotubes with a glycosylation inhibitor, tunicamycin, prevented the recovery from desensitization, indicating that the recovery process is due to the insertion of new P2X receptors into the membrane (26.Thomas S.A. Hume R.I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1990; 430: 373-388Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It was assumed that after the opening of P2X receptor-coupled channels, they became inactivated and could not recover. The inactivated receptors might be internalized and re-processed to be inserted into membrane again. The exact mechanism for such a phenomenon is unclear at the moment. It is also unclear why cP2X8 receptors behave in such a way. Another feature of cP2X8 receptor-coupled ion channel is that prolonged ATP application in low Ca2+ perfusion medium produced a rapid inward current followed by a slower current, which did not reach a peak until the application of ATP was stopped. Continuous application of ATP would finally cause the death of oocytes. A similar phenomenon has been reported on recombinant rat P2X4receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes and HEK 293 cells in Ca2+-free medium (27.Khakh B.S. Bao X.R. Labarca C. Lester H.A. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). It was suggested that the slower second currents were due to the change of ion selectivity during sustained exposure to ATP, and the occurrence and kinetics were regulated by Ca2+ concentration. If extracellular Ca2+ concentration dropped significantly in pathological conditions, sustained release of ATP from nerve terminals or damaged cells may lead to cell death. rP2X7 receptors have also been reported to change ion selectivity upon prolonged exposure to 2′,3′-(O)-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)ATP in low divalent cation concentration, which leads to cytolysis following the formation of large pores on membrane (28.Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar). It may be worthwhile to explore further the relationship between cP2X8 receptor activation and cell death under pathological conditions such as hypoxia. The recombinant cP2X8 receptors expressed inXenopus oocytes and P2X receptors in cultured myotubes (29.Thomas S.A. Zawisa M.J. Lin X. Hume R.I. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 103: 1963-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) showed similarity in pharmacological profiles. ATP, ATPγS, and 2-methylthio-ATP are potent agonists, and ADP is a weak agonist. Other nucleotides, di-adenosine tetraphosphate, β,γ-methylene-ATP, AMP, and adenosine are inactive. The only difference is that α,β-methylene-ATP is a potent agonist for the cP2X8receptor, whereas it failed to elicit inward currents in myotubes. The difference might be because the native P2X receptors are heteromultimers combining P2X8 and other P2X receptor subunits. cP2X4 was expressed in embryonic skeletal muscle and was insensitive to α,β-methylene-ATP. We tried to co-express cP2X4 and cP2X8 receptors in Xenopusoocytes; however, because a much higher amount of cRNA for cP2X4 was required to produce detectable responses, the expression of cP2X8 receptors was suppressed. Therefore, the recorded responses were typical of cP2X4 receptors. Fine-tuning of the co-expression of these two receptor subtypes may resolve the problem. Northern blot hybridization and RT-PCR revealed that cP2X8receptors were highly, but not exclusively, expressed in embryonic skeletal muscle. They were also expressed in the brain, heart, gizzard, and retina in Day 10 embryos. These tissues mainly consist of excitable cells, indicating the role of ATP as a fast transmitter in these tissues. The expression of cP2X8 in liver was very low. Whole mount in situ hybridization revealed more details of tissue distribution of cP2X8 receptors during development. In an earlier stage of development (Day 3 and Day 4), they are predominantly expressed in nerve tissues such as brain and neurotube. In Day 6 embryos the expression in nerve tissues is no longer so distinctive, although the expression in skeletal muscle becomes very obvious. A further detailed study on the expression of cP2X8 receptor during the whole embryo developmental process is being carried out. The physiological significance of cP2X8 receptors in the innervation of skeletal muscle during development is unknown and will be studied. Information about P2X receptors in chick tissues is very limited. The P2X8receptor is the only subtype that has been identified in chick tissues and characterized in pharmacological and electrophysiological experiments. More studies on P2X receptors in chick tissues are required considering the importance of chick embryos as a tool for the study of the development. In conclusion, we have cloned and characterized a novel subtype of P2X receptor from embryonic chick skeletal muscle, which we have tentatively termed cP2X8. The electrophysiological and pharmacological features of the recombinant cP2X8 receptor are very close to the ATP-induced responses in cultured chick myotubes. cP2X8 receptors are highly expressed in embryonic chick skeletal muscle, but they are also expressed in other tissues such as brain, neurotube, heart, gizzard, and retina. The expression of cP2X8 receptors in developing skeletal muscle may play a significant role in the establishment of the innervation of skeletal muscle. The editorial work by R. Jordan in the preparation of the manuscript is greatly appreciated. We also thank A. J. Pendjiky for help in the preparation of the electronic illustrations."

In fact, the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin induces dephosphorylation of mammalian BiP. The stress-induced phosphorylation state of plant BiP has not been examined. Here, we demonstrated that soybean BiP exists in interconvertible phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms, and the equilibrium can be shift to either direction in response to different stimuli. In contrast to tunicamycin treatment, water stress condition stimulated phosphorylation of BiP species in soybean cultured cells and stressed leaves.

We also compared the induction of the soybean BiP gene family, which consists of at least four members designated soyBiPA, soyBiPB,soyBiPC, and soyBiPD, by tunicamycin and osmotic stress. Although all soybean BiP genes were induced by tunicamycin, just the soyBiPA RNA was up-regulated by osmotic stress.

Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1996; 34: 197-205Google Scholar, 2.Galili G. Sengupta-Gopalam C. Ceriotti A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 1-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr.

A set of ER-resident proteins, including molecular chaperones and folding enzymes, associates with newly synthesized polypeptides to assist proper folding and assembly of oligomeric secretory proteins (reviewed in Refs. 1.Denecke J. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1996; 34: 197-205Google Scholar, 3.Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, and 5.Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3607) Google Scholar). The binding protein (BiP) represents one of the best-characterized molecular chaperones from the ER. The mechanism of BiP binding to and release from nascent polypeptide is believed to be analogous to that described for the cytosolic HSP70 protein (6.Ellis R.J. van der Vies S.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 321-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.-U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). HSP70-related proteins exist in equilibrium between self-assembled forms and monomers in which the binding site is either free or associated with other proteins (8.Benaroudj N. Triniolles F. Ladjimi M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18471-18476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This equilibrium is regulated by cycles of ADP/ATP binding and hydrolysis as well as cycles of protein substrate binding and release (9.Knittler M.R. Haas I.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). BiP also exists in interconvertible oligomeric and monomeric forms and is post-translationally modified and regulated by ADP-ribosylation and phosphorylation (10.Carlsson L. Lazarides E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4664-4668Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 11.Hendershot L.M. Ting J. Lee A. J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4250-4256Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). These modifications occur upon the ATP-dependent release of BiP from associated proteins and can be reversed under stress conditions that increase the level of unfolded polypeptides in the ER. Because phosphorylation and ADP-ribosylation appear to be restricted to oligomeric forms of mammalian BiP that are not bound to nascent polypeptides, the monomeric, unmodified form of BiP is thought to be the biologically active species (12.Freiden P.J. Gaut J.R. Hendershot L.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In spinach, three forms of BiP, the 85-kDa monomer, a 280-kDa multimeric form, and a 650-kDa oligomeric form, have been described (13.Anderson J.V. Li Q.B. Haskell D.W. Guy C.L. Plant Physiol. (Rockv). 1994; 104 (1370): 1395Google Scholar). However, only the oligomeric form of BiP is phosphorylated in vitro, suggesting that, like mammals, the level of functional plant BiP is regulated by post-translational modification. The ER molecular chaperone proteins are expressed constitutively at low levels in all cells but are induced upon accumulation of unfolded protein in the lumen of the ER (5.Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3607) Google Scholar, 7.Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.-U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). The expression of folding-defective mutant secretory proteins or treatment of cells with agents that impair protein folding activates a signaling cascade to allow communication between the ER and nucleus (14.Lee A.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). This signal transduction pathway, designated the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, is characterized by the coordinated transcriptional up-regulation of BiP and other ER proteins that are involved in folding and assembly of nascent proteins. The inter-organelle signaling cascade, which has been elucidated in yeast, involves an ER transmembrane kinase and a basic leucine zipper transcription factor, Hac1p, whose level is modulated by a regulated spliceosome-independent mRNA splicing event (reviewed in Ref. 15.Shamu C.E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 67-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In plants, like mammals and yeast, the expression of BiP is regulated according to cellular requirements for chaperone activity. Thus, both the increase of secretory activity and the accumulation of unfolded proteins within the ER result in the induction of BiP synthesis in plants (reviewed in Refs. 1.Denecke J. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1996; 34: 197-205Google Scholar and 16.Boston R.S. Viitanen P.V. Vierling E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 34: 191-222Crossref Scopus (512) Google Scholar). In the floury-2 mutant of maize, the synthesis of a zein-like storage protein variant, which contains an uncleavable signal sequence, is associated with increased accumulation of BiP (17.Boston R.S. Fontes E.P.B. Shank B.B. Wrobel R.L. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 18.Fontes E.P.B. Shank B.B. Wrobel R.L. Moose S.P. O'Brian G.R. Wurtzel E.T. Boston R.S.

(Rockv). 1997; 114: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Expression of an assembly-defective mutant of the bean storage protein phaseolin also induces BiP synthesis in tobacco leaf protoplasts (21.Pedrazzini E. Giovinazzo G. Bollini R. Ceriotti A. Vitale A. Plant J. 1994; 5: 103-110Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, tunicamycin, a potent activator of the UPR pathway, efficiently induces BiP expression at both mRNA and protein level in several plant systems (18.Fontes E.P.B. Shank B.B. Wrobel R.L. Moose S.P. O'Brian G.R. Wurtzel E.T. Boston R.S. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 483-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 22.D'amico L. Valsania B. Daminati M.G. Fabrini M.S. Nitti G. Bollini R. Ceriotti A. Vitale A. Plant J. 1992; 2: 443-445PubMed Google Scholar). These results have led to the conclusion that, like mammals and yeast BiP, plant BiP is most likely regulated through an unfolded protein response pathway. This idea is supported by the observation that, as in mammalian cells, overexpression of BiP in tobacco leaf protoplasts attenuates ER stress caused by tunicamycin and prevents activation of the unfolded protein response pathway (23.Leborgne-Castel N. Jelitto-Van Dooren E.P.W.M. Crofts A.J. Denecke J. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 459-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 24.Morris J.A. Dorner A.J. Edwards C.A. Hendershot L.M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4327-4334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). However, in some plant species, specific stress conditions and developmental events alter BiP mRNA and protein levels to different extents, suggesting that post-transcriptional mechanisms are also involved in the regulation of BiP synthesis in plants (13.Anderson J.V. Li Q.B. Haskell D.W. Guy C.L. Plant Physiol. (Rockv). 1994; 104 (1370): 1395Google Scholar, 25.Kalinski A. Rowley D.L. Loer D.S. Foley C. Buta G. Herman E.M. Planta. 1995; 195: 611-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Alternatively or additionally, these discrepancies between the level of BiP mRNA and protein may reflect differential expression and regulation of plant BiP gene families, since the genome of several plant species is represented by multiple BiP genes (25.Kalinski A. Rowley D.L. Loer D.S. Foley C. Buta G. Herman E.M. Planta. 1995; 195: 611-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 26.Denecke J. Goldman M.H.S. Demolder J. Seurinck J. Botterman J.

Both alternatives support the argument that multiple, complex regulatory mechanisms control BiP gene expression in plants. In soybean, three distinct BiP cDNAs have been isolated from a leaf library (25.Kalinski A. Rowley D.L. Loer D.S. Foley C. Buta G. Herman E.M. Planta. 1995; 195: 611-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and one has been identified in a seed cDNA expression library (28.Figueiredo J.E.F. Cascardo J.C.M. Carolino S.M.B. Alvim F. Fontes E.P.B. Rev. Bras. Fisiol. Veg. 1997; 9: 103-110Google Scholar). In this paper, we used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays to examine the potential BiP regulatory mechanisms in plants. We compared the mechanisms controlling BiP up-regulation by tunicamycin treatment and water stress as well as the phosphorylation state of the induced BiP forms. Soybean plants (Glycine max cv. Cristalina) were germinated in 5-liter pots containing a mixture of soil, sand, and dung (3:1:1) and grown in standardized greenhouse conditions. Plant tissues were harvested, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Water stress condition was induced in 40-day-old plants by withholding watering for 8 days before harvesting of leaves. Half of the leaves were used to measure the relative water content (29.Catsky J. Slavik N. Methods of Studying Plant Water Relations. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1974: 136-151Google Scholar), and the other half was frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cotyledons cells from the soybean variety IAC-12 were cultured as described previously (30.Finer J.J. Nagasawa A. Plant Cell Tissue Organ. Cult. 1988; 15: 125-136Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Tunicamycin was added to cultures at 4 days after passage by dilution of a 5 mg/ml stock in Me2SO into normal growth medium to 10 μg/ml and incubated for the intervals indicated in the figure legends. For water stress, the cells were washed and then cultured with normal growth medium containing 10% (w/v) PEG-8000 (polyethylene glycol), which corresponds to a water potential of −1.4 megapascals for the indicated intervals. For two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, SDS-PAGE, and RT-PCR assays, the cells were filtered under vacuum and washed with an isotonic solution (0.25 m NaCl) to remove any adhered medium and PEG. The cells were then frozen in liquid nitrogen before protein and RNA extractions. Total protein was extracted from an acetone dry powder, as described (31.Görg A. Postel W. Günther S. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 531-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, plant tissues (cells and leaves) were crushed in liquid nitrogen, and 2 g of the powder were homogenized with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid in acetone containing 0.07% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. Total protein was precipitated for 40 min at −20 °C, recovered by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min, and washed 2–3 times with acetone containing 0.07% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. The pellet was dried under vacuum, and 30 mg of the acetone dry powder were resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (9 m urea, 2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.8% (v/v) Ampholines (pH 5–7), 0.2% (v/v) Ampholines (pH 3.5–10), 8 mm PMSF) followed by ultrasonication on ice. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 15 min, and protein concentration was determined as described (32.Hill H.D. Straka J.G. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed as described (33.O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the first dimension, 30–50 μg of protein were loaded on isoelectric focusing tube gels (Bio-Rad) in which the pH gradient was established with 80% pH 5–7 and 20% pH 3.5–10 Ampholines (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After electrophoresis at 750 V for 3.5 h, the gels were equilibrated with buffer A (5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 6 m urea, 30% (v/v) glycerol, and 2% (w/v) SDS) and stored at −80 °C. Prior to the second dimension, the gels were re-equilibrated for 15 min with buffer A containing 65 mmdithiothreitol and then for 15 min with buffer A containing 65 mm dithiothreitol and 260 mm iodoacetamide. SDS-PAGE was carried out as described previously (34.Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and the proteins were transferred from 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting. Immunoblot analyses were performed using polyclonal anti-BiP-carboxy antibodies (28.Figueiredo J.E.F. Cascardo J.C.M. Carolino S.M.B. Alvim F. Fontes E.P.B. Rev. Bras. Fisiol. Veg. 1997; 9: 103-110Google Scholar) at a 1:1000 dilution and a goat anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma) at a 1:5000 dilution. Alkaline phosphatase activity was assayed using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Life Technologies, Inc.) andp-nitro blue tetrazolium (Life Technologies, Inc.). The pH gradient of the isoelectric focusing gels was determined by incubating 0.2-cm mock-loaded gel slices in 2 ml of H2O at room temperature for 12 h with shaking. The pH of each gel slice was measured and plotted as a function of the distance from the anode. Pre-stained molecular markers were electrophoresed in the second dimension and served as a reference point for comparison of the different gels. For the dephosphorylation assays, total protein extracts were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 50 mm potassium acetate, and 4 mm PMSF and treated with 4 units of alkaline phosphatase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 37 °C. After phosphatase treatment, the proteins were dialyzed against 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm PMSF, concentrated by freeze-drying, and resuspended in lysis buffer. The integrity of the proteins was monitored by SDS-PAGE. Total RNA from cells was extracted as described (35.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar) or using an RNAeasy kit (Qiagen). The RNA was treated with 2 units of RNase-free DNase (Promega) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, and 2 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C for 1 h and recovered by ethanol precipitation. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 2–5 μg of total RNA using the SuperScript II Kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR assays were performed withsoyBiPA-, soyBiPB-, soyBiPC- (25.Kalinski A. Rowley D.L. Loer D.S. Foley C. Buta G. Herman E.M. Planta. 1995; 195: 611-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), orsoyBiPD- (28.Figueiredo J.E.F. Cascardo J.C.M. Carolino S.M.B. Alvim F. Fontes E.P.B. Rev. Bras. Fisiol.

A typical reaction consisted of 2 μl of the reverse transcription reaction, 200 μm each dNTP, 100 nm each sense and antisense gene-specific primers, 1 × PCR buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2), and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a total volume of 30 μl. The presence of contaminating DNA was assessed in control reactions conducted without reverse transcriptase. The reactions were performed for 35 cycles (30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 52 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C), with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. For RNA abundance assays, the number of cycles was reduced to 25. The reaction products were separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose, Tris borate-EDTA gels and visualized with ethidium bromide-staining under UV transillumination.Table IGene-specific primersPrimerSequenceAnnealing sequenceAnnealing position (cognate cDNA)BiPABiPBBiPCBiPD% identityBiPAFCGAGCTCTAGAGATGTTGTTGCTT10046.2ND41.72044BiPARTACGTAGACGGCTGTAGTTCC1000ND02317BiPBFTGAGCTCTAGTTAGTCGGAGTCTG45.8100ND58.32080BiPBRCGATCGGCACGAGGAAGTTG40100ND452259BiPCFCGAGCGCACCTTCAACTTAACC22.727.3100912BiPCRCAACATGGCCATTCTTGTAAACACCG924610092260BiPDFATCTGGAGGAGCCCTAGGCGGTGG62.9100ND1001966BiPDRCTTGAAGAAGCTTCGTCGTAAAACTAAG4470ND1002184The annealing position corresponds to the nucleotide position in the cognate cDNA in which the 5′ nucleotide of the primer sequence anneals.

PCR assays were also carried out with soybean Actin 3 gene-specific primers (GenBank™ accession number J01297) to assess the quantity and quality of the cDNA.

RNA for gel blot analysis was isolated from control, tunicamycin, and water-stressed cells as described (35.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). Equal amounts of total RNA were denatured by formamide/formaldehyde and resolved on 1% agarose gels containing formaldehyde (36.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane by capillary transfer and immobilized by UV cross-linking (Stratalinker, Stratagene). The membrane was hybridized at high stringency conditions (18.Fontes E.P.B. Shank B.B. Wrobel R.L. Moose S.P. O'Brian G.R. Wurtzel E.T. Boston R.S.

The hybridization probe was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random primed labeling (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Autoradiography was performed at −80 °C using a Lightning-Plus intensifying screen (Sigma). The amount of RNA and the integrity of ribosomal RNA were monitored by rehybridizing the membranes with a pea 18 S rDNA probe. All of the procedures were conducted at 4 °C. Protein extracts were prepared by homogenization of water-stressed leaves with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, and 2 units/ml apyrase or 2 mm ATP at a ratio of 1 g of the tissue/2 ml of extraction buffer. After incubation of the protein extracts for 10 min, cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described (37.Li X. Su R.T.C. Hsu H. Sze H. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Protein extracts (1 ml) were precleared by incubating with 100 μl of 50% (v/v) protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and goat anti-rabbit IgG-agarose (Sigma) suspensions in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 140 mm NaCl for 1 h. After incubation, proteins that bound nonspecifically to protein A or anti-IgG were removed by centrifugation. The precleared supernatant was then incubated with 100 μl of anti-BiP-carboxy antibodies (28.Figueiredo J.E.F. Cascardo J.C.M. Carolino S.M.B. Alvim F. Fontes E.P.B. Rev. Bras. Fisiol.

The immunocomplexes were recovered by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 5 min. Pelleted Sepharose beads were washed extensively with 1 ml of 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 1 mm PMSF and resuspended in 40 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (34.Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using a chicken anti-WSBiP antibody and a rabbit anti-chicken IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma). The chicken anti-WSBiP antibody was raised against a BiP fraction that was purified from water-stressed leaves essentially as described (18.Fontes E.P.B. Shank B.B. Wrobel R.L. Moose S.P.

About 50 μg of BiP preparations from water-stressed leaves were emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant and injected subcutaneously under the wing of a chicken. For subsequent injections at 14-day intervals, incomplete Freund's adjuvant was used. After the third injection, eggs were collected daily, and the anti-WSBiP antibody was purified from egg yolk as described (38.Carroll S.B. Stollar B.D. J. Biol.

For microsomal membrane isolation, normal and water-stressed leaves were homogenized with 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 250 mm sucrose, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgSO4, 0.5% (w/v) gelatin, and 0.5 mm PMSF (40.Ripp K.G. Viitanen P.V. Hitz W.D. Franceschi V.R. Plant Physiol. (Rockv). 1988; 88: 1435-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The homogenate was filtered and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Microsomal preparations were isolated by centrifugation at 80,000 ×g for 45 min (37.Li X. Su R.T.C. Hsu H. Sze H. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and subsequently by density gradient centrifugation (41.Chrispeels M.J. Planta. 1983; 158: 140-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 42.Helm K.W. Lafayette P.R. Nagao R.T. Key J.L. Vierling E. Mol. Cell.

(Rockv). 1999; 121: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Previously we showed that soybean BiP is induced by water stress (28.Figueiredo J.E.F. Cascardo J.C.M. Carolino S.M.B. Alvim F. Fontes E.P.B. Rev. Bras. Fisiol. Veg. 1997; 9: 103-110Google Scholar). In water-stressed leaves, BiP synthesis is up-regulated to the same extent as in nutritionally stressed leaves and in pathogen-infected leaves. However, the synthesis of spinach BiP, which is a product of a single gene, is unaffected by water stress (13.Anderson J.V. Li Q.B. Haskell D.W. Guy C.L. Plant Physiol. (Rockv). 1994; 104 (1370): 1395Google Scholar). In fact, in spinach, water stress resulted in disappearance of the BiP mRNA, although the level of protein remained unaltered. To characterize the water stress regulation of the soybean BiP family, we examined the BiP isoforms in control (relative water content 85%) and in water-stressed (relative water content 50%) soybean leaves by immunoblotting assays of two-dimensional gels (Fig. 1). The pI range of the BiP species detected in water-stressed leaves was more acidic than that of the BiP isoforms from control leaves (compare Fig.1, B and A). To identify whether water stress resulted in the appearance of phosphorylated BiP isoforms or caused the induction of more acidic, distinct BiP species, the leaf protein extract was treated with phosphatase before electrophoresis (Fig.1 C). Dephosphorylation of BiP caused a shift in the isoelectric focusing migrations of the water-stressed-induced forms (pI 5.4–5.8) toward a less acidic pI cluster (pI 6.1–6.25) and a single acidic species, pI 6.5 (Fig. 1, B and C). The effectiveness of the alkaline phosphatase treatment was confirmed by complete removal of radiolabeled phosphate incorporated into the protein (data not shown). These results indicated that water stress stimulated phosphorylation of the induced BiP species. Although our result may suggest that phosphorylation of BiP is part of the ER stress response in plants, it would be in marked contrast with the stress-mediated dephosphorylation of mammalian BiP by tunicamycin treatment of cultured cells (11.Hendershot L.M. Ting J. Lee A. J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4250-4256Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To directly compare the induction and phosphorylation state of the water stress- and tunicamycin-induced BiP forms of soybean, we used cultured soybean cells treated with either 10% (w/v) PEG or tunicamycin. After the treatments, the cells were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and whole cell protein extracts were displayed in two-dimensional gels and immunoblotted with an anti-BiP serum (Fig. 2). Apparently all the BiP forms were induced upon treatment of suspension cells with tunicamycin, because the cross-reactive induced proteins were resolved in several isoelectric states ranging from pI 5.8 to 6.5 (compare Fig.2, A and C, Bs and In). In contrast, treatment of the cells with PEG promoted the induction of a subset of BiP forms, which were resolved in a more acidic isoelectric focusing position cluster, pI 5.4–5.7 (Fig. 2 E,Ac). The relative differences in the isoelectric focusing migrations between the water stress- and tunicamycin-induced forms prompted us to examine whether their phosphorylation state changed following stress conditions. In untreated control cells (Fig. 2 A), BiP occurred in several isoelectric states that resolved as an acidic cluster (3–4 forms, pI 5.8–6.1, In) and a more basic species, pI 6.5 (Bs). The acidic cluster represents different phosphorylated forms of the same protein because dephosphorylation assays caused their co-migration as a less acidic single species (compare BiP forms under In in Fig. 2,A and B). In contrast, phosphatase treatment of the samples did not cause a shift in the isoel"

The torque of the rotation is invariably ∼40 pN·nm for actin filaments with various lengths, and at low ATP concentrations, rotation driven by a single ATP hydrolysis was observed as a discrete 120° step (12.Yasuda R.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the mechanism of how ATP hydrolysis on the β subunits drives rotation of the γ subunit has attracted keen interest. It is obvious that torque should be generated at the interface between the γ subunit and the α3β3 ring. In the crystal structure of F1 from bovine mitochondria (MF1), three β subunits are in different states; one β (βTP) has an ATP analog, Mg-AMP-PNP, at its catalytic site, another β (βDP) has Mg-ADP, the third βE has none. The structures of βTP and βDP are very similar to each other and they are in the “closed” conformation, in which the carboxyl-terminal helical domain is lifted close to the nucleotide binding domain and in contact with the γ subunit. In contrast, βE adopts the “open” conformation, in which the crevice for substrate binding is open and the carboxyl-terminal domain is apart from the γ subunit. It was shown that this structure of F1, characterized by two closed and one open β subunits, is generated as intermediate(s) during the catalytic cycle (19.Tsunoda S.P. Muneyuki E. Amano T. Yoshida M. Noji H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 274: 5701-5706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20.Ren H. Dou C. Stelzer M.S. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31366-31372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It seems plausible that the dynamic open-closed motion of the carboxyl-terminal domain of the β subunit caused by the binding of nucleotide may drive the rotation of the γ subunit. The carboxyl-terminal domain of the β subunit contains the acidic cluster sequence, known as the DELSEED motif. This sequence has been well conserved in all F1s with minor variations; for example, DELSDED in TF1-β, DELSEED in MF1-β, and DELSEED in the β subunit of F1from Escherichia coli (EF1). In the closed conformation of the β subunit, this region has contact with the γ subunit. The counterpart contact region of the γ subunit is mainly in the short helix that forms a small protrusion from the straight coiled-coil structure (residues 81–98 in TF1-γ, 73–90 in MF1-γ, and 82–99 in EF1-γ) (Fig. 1). Based on these facts, the β-DELSEED motif has been assumed to play an essential role in the rotation of the γ subunit and hence coupling between catalysis and transport (21.Ketchum C.J. Al-Shawi M.K. Nakamoto R.K. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To examine this, we have replaced the DELSDED sequence of TF1-β and the counterpart contact positions of TF1-γ with alanine and observed the rotation as well as ATP hydrolysis. E. coli strains used were JM109 (22.Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene. 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11410) Google Scholar) for preparation of plasmids, CJ236 (23.Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) for generating uracil-containing single-stranded plasmid for site-directed mutagenesis, and JM103Δ (uncB-uncC) (24.Monticello R.A. Angov E. Brusilow W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3370-3376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for expression of the mutant α3β3γ complexes of TF1. The uracil-containing single-stranded plasmid was generated from M13mp18 containing the inserted fragment encoding α(C193S), β(10H), and γ(S107C) in which αCys-193 was replaced with serine, a 10-histidine tag was attached to the amino terminus of the β subunit, and γSer-107 was replaced with cysteine (11.Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1925) Google Scholar). The expression plasmid for the α(C193S)3β(10H)3γ(S107C) complex was made by exchanging the fragment encoding the above subunits into the plasmid (pKAGB1) for the expression of wild-type α3β3γ complex (9.Matsui T. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The mutations were introduced into the uracil-containing single-stranded plasmid by using synthetic oligonucleotides. The MluI-PstI fragment from the M13 plasmid was exchanged by that from the expression plasmid to generate mutants with replaced or deleted residues in the βDELSDED sequence. The mutants with replaced residues in γ-short helix were generated by exchanging the BglII-MluI fragment. The mutant α3β3γ complexes were purified as described previously (9.Matsui T. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured at 25 °C in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system in 10 mmMOPS-KOH (pH 7.0) buffer containing 50 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 50 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, 50 μg/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 mm NADH, and 2 mm ATP. The rate of ATP hydrolysis was determined between 3 and 13 s after addition of the enzyme. To observe the rotation of the γ subunit under a microscope, we fixed mutant α3β3γ complexes on a surface-bound bead (0.2 μm in diameter) through 10-histidine tags of the β subunits (12.Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). A fluorescently labeled actin filament was attached to the γ subunit through streptavidin (11.Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1925) Google Scholar). The ATP concentration was fixed at 2 mm in an ATP-regenerating system containing 0.2 μg/ml creatine kinase and 2.5 mm creatine phosphate. Rotation was observed at 25 °C on an inverted fluorescence microscope (IX70, Olympus), and images were recorded with an ICCD camera (ICCD-350F, Video scope) on an 8-mm video tape. The rotation angle of the filament was estimated from the circular movement of the centroid of the filament image calculated using a software that we provided. The frictional torque for the rotation of the γ subunit is given, in the simplest approximation, by (4π/3)ωη{L 13/[ln(L 1/2r) − 0.447] +L 23/[ln(L 2/2r) − 0.447]}. ω, the angular velocity; η, the viscosity of the medium (10−3 N·s·m−2);L 1, L 2, the length from the center of rotation to the end of the actin filament; r(5 nm), the radius of the filament. We generated seven mutant α3β3γ complexes of TF1 in which residues in the βDELSDED sequence of the β subunits were individually replaced with alanine (alanine scanning mutation). The mutations were introduced into the wt′ complex, α(C193S)3β(10H)3γ(S107C), which we have routinely used for observation of rotation. As described (11.Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1925) Google Scholar), ATPase activity of the wt′ complex is nearly the same as that of the wild-type α3β3γ complex. ATPase activities at 2 mm ATP were examined for the mutants. Among seven mutants, only one mutant α3β3γ complex containing the E391A mutation in the β subunit (βE391A complex) showed significantly impaired ATPase activity, ∼20% of that of the wt′ complex. The ATP-driven proton pumping activity of F0F1-ATP synthase reconstituted from the βE391A complex and other components was also impaired to a similar extent (data not shown). ATPase activities of other mutant complexes were less impaired or nearly intact (TableI). Next, rotation of the γ subunit, visualized by attached fluorescently labeled actin filaments, was examined at 2 mm ATP. All of the mutant complexes showed continuous rotation in a manner apparently indistinguishable from the rotation of the wt′ complex. As expected, the rotations were anti-clockwise when viewed from the membrane side. The calculated rotary torques of mutant complexes are all similar to that of the wt′ complex (Table I). As described (12.Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar), the apparent discrepancy between the decreased V max values and the unaffected torque results from the difference in rates of catalytic turnover with or without load. 2In rotation assay at high ATP concentrations, the maximum rate of rotation (and hence ATP hydrolysis) is limited by frictional load of filament rotation in the water. In the ATPase assay, the rate of ATP hydrolysis by free α3β3γ complex (without actin filament and without immobilization) is not limited by the frictional load but by the intrinsic catalytic nature of the enzyme. The change of maximum rotational rate of a 1-μm filament should become apparent only when the V max of the mutant complex decreases to less than 10% of theV max of the wt′ complex. The results of the alanine scanning mutation described above indicate that no single residue in the βDELSDED sequence is essential for ATPase and rotation.Table IEffect of mutations in the β-DELSDED sequence and counterpart residues of the γ subunit on ATP hydrolysis and torque valueMutationATP hydrolysisTorqueμmol/min/mgpN · nmwt′27 ± 137 ± 2βD390A24 ± 127 ± 5βE391A5 ± 130 ± 4βL392A17 ± 334 ± 5βS393A19 ± 139 ± 4βD394A33 ± 643 ± 6βE395A27 ± 233 ± 6βD396A17 ± 237 ± 3γL85A13 ± 428 ± 5γR95A27 ± 328 ± 6βAALSAAA10 ± 034 ± 4Each value of ATP hydrolysis was the mean of three measurements.

The alanine scanning mutations of the βDELSDED sequence described above, however, indicate that these interactions may not be critical for the catalysis and rotation. To confirm this indication, we replaced γGly-84, γLeu-85, and γArg-95 individually with alanine. The γG84A mutant did not form a stable α3β3γ complex and was expressed only as inclusion bodies. Therefore, γGly-84 appears to be essential to form the structure of the γ subunit required for stable interaction with the surrounding α3β3 ring. The γL85A and γR95A mutants formed stable α3β3γ complexes. The ATPase activity of the γR95A complex was almost unaffected, but the activity of the γL85A complex decreased to about one-half that of the wt′ complex (Table I). Nevertheless, torque generated by the γL85A and γR95A complexes was nearly equal to that by the wt′ complex (Table I). Even though γLeu-85 and γArg-95 in the short helix of the γ subunit interact directly with the βDELSDED sequence, these interactions by themselves are not necessary for the function. Despite the above results, there is a possibility that the βDELSDED sequence plays an essential role for the torque generation, not through specific residue-residue interaction but as a cluster of negative charges. Then, a quintuple alanine mutant in which all five acidic residues in the βDELSDED sequence were replaced with alanines (βAALSAAA mutant) was expressed and purified as a stable α3β3γ complex. ATPase activity of the βAALSAAA complex decreased to 37% of that of the wt′ complex, but this mutant complex still showed continuous rotation in a manner apparently indistinguishable from the rotation of the wt′ complex (Fig.2) and exerted rotational torque in normal range (Fig. 3). We also made βAALSDED, βDALSAED, and βDELSAAA mutant complexes, and the results were the same; they showed normal rotation (data not shown). Thus, the negative charge cluster in the βDELSDED sequence does not play an essential role in the rotation of the γ subunit.Figure 3Rotational rate versuslength of the actin filaments. Rotational rates were estimated by least square linear fitting on the time courses for more than five revolutions and expressed in revolutions per s (r.p.s.). Closed and open circlesindicate results of the wt′ complex and βAALSAAA mutant complex, respectively. Solid and dotted lines represent the calculated rotational rate of the filaments with varying lengths, which gives a constant torque value of 40 and 20 pN·nm, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although the DELSEED motif is well conserved in all F1s and has a direct contact with γ subunit, our results presented here indicate that the side chains of this motif do not contribute to the rotation of the γ subunit. This motif contains five acidic residues, and a negative charge cluster has been assumed to contribute to the catalysis (26.Kagawa Y. Hamamoto T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, even a single negative charge is not necessary for the catalysis and rotation. Now several possibilities on the function of the DELSEED motif are worth examining. (i) A possibility should be considered that torque is generated at other β-γ intersubunit contact sites including the portions that have not been solved by x-ray crystallography. (ii) The function of the DELSEED motif could be a steric one; the helix-turn-helix structure including the DELSEED motif acts as a solid protruding “bar” that dynamically moves and pushes the short helix of the γ subunit through the physical contact but not through specific interactions between residues. The motion of the bar is caused by the open-closed motion of the β subunits. We tried to remove this bar by deleting whole DELSDED sequence of TF1-β, but this mutant failed to assemble into α3β3γ complex. (iii) The role of the DELSEED motif in the enzyme function could be structural. A mutant in which all seven residues in the βDELSDED sequence were replaced with alanine did not assemble. Interestingly, addition of higher negative charge to this region destabilized the complex because a mutant, βDEEEDED, failed to assemble, and the mutant complexes were expressed as inclusion bodies. (iv) The conservation of the DELSEED motif implicates another role of this sequence. An amphipathic cationic reagent binds to this region and inactivates the ATPase activity (27.Bullough D.A. Ceccarelli E.A. Verburg J.G. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9155-9163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In EF1, the ε subunit with cysteines introduced is cross-linked to the βE391C residues of two β subunits (28.Dallmann H.G. Flynn T.G. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18953-18960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Aggeler R. Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol.

Interaction with the ε subunit to regulate the catalysis is one of the possible functions of the DELSEED motif."

The extracellular region of KDR is comprised of seven immunoglobulin-like domains, of which the first three have been shown to be required for ligand binding. We have previously described antibodies directed against the extracellular region of KDR, including MAB383 and MAB664, which were shown to block the binding of VEGF to the receptor and to inhibit both VEGF-induced mitogenesis of human endothelial cells in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Here we generated a series of KDR deletion mutants consisting of truncated extracellular regions and mapped out the domain(s) responsible for binding to VEGF and the neutralizing anti-KDR antibodies. All neutralizing antibodies were found to require domain 3 for efficient binding. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of domain 3 identified two different sets of five residues, Ile256, Asp257, Glu261, Leu313, and Thr315 and Tyr262, Pro263, Ser264, Ser265, and Lys266, that were critical for binding to MAB383 and MAB664, respectively. Combination of alanine mutations affecting both MAB383 and MAB664 binding resulted in a variant that also lost binding to VEGF. These results suggest that the residues within this region of domain 3 are critical for VEGF binding.

There is compelling evidence to suggest that VEGF/KDRs play an important role in tumor angiogenesis, a process essential for both tumor growth and metastasis (for reviews see Refs.4.Ferrara N.

Antagonists to VEGF and/or KDR, therefore, may have broad applications in the treatment of a variety of human diseases where pathological angiogenesis is involved. VEGF is a member of the cysteine-knot growth factor family that also includes several other factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor β, and nerve growth factor (12.Sun P.D. Davies D.R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 269-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VEGF exists as a homodimer held together by two intermolecular disulfide bonds. A high resolution crystal structure of VEGF has been recently determined (13.Keyt B.A. Nguyen H.V. Berleau L.T. Duarte C.M. Park J. Chen H. Ferrara N. J. Biol.

Each VEGF homodimer possesses two symmetrical binding surfaces, one located at each pole of the molecules, and is composed of binding determinants contributed by both subunits in the homodimer. Within each binding surface eight residues form two “hot spots”; the larger one consists of Ile43, Ile46, Ile83, Lys84, and Pro85 from one subunit, along with one residue, Glu64, from the other subunit, and the smaller one contains one residue from each subunit, Gln79 and Phe17(13.Keyt B.A. Nguyen H.V.

Recent studies have demonstrated that a single VEGF homodimer binds two molecules of KDR, which is followed by receptor dimerization and activation (13.Keyt B.A. Nguyen H.V. Berleau L.T. Duarte C.M.

The extracellular region of KDR consists of seven immunoglobulin-like domains, and deletion studies have shown that domains 1–3 are sufficient and necessary for high affinity binding to VEGF (16.Fuh G.

Dougher-Vermazen M. Terman B.I. Growth Factors. 1997; 14: 243-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Deletion of domain 3 alone reduced the binding to VEGF by >1000-fold, indicating a critical functional role for this domain in VEGF/KDR interaction (16.Fuh G. Li B. Crowley C. Cunningham B. Wells J.

Growth Factors. 1997; 14: 243-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Because no detailed structural information on KDR is available to date, the molecular basis of VEGF/KDR interaction is poorly understood. We previously described a panel of antibodies that recognize various epitopes on the extracellular region of KDR (18.Witte L. Hicklin D.J. Zhu Z. Pytowski B. Kotanides H. Rockwell P. Bohlen P. Cancer Met. Rev. 1998; 17: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). All eight neutralizing antibodies that block VEGF/KDR interaction, including MAB383, MAB664, and IMC-1C11, were found to require domain 3 for efficient binding, whereas all nonblocking antibodies recognize epitopes that are located outside this domain. 2Z. Zhu, unpublished observations. It is noteworthy that none of our neutralizing anti-KDR antibodies cross-reacts with fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk-1), the mouse homolog of KDR, despite high sequence identity (∼85%) between the two molecules. Both KDR and Flk-1, however, bind and can be activated by human VEGF. Taken together, these observations suggest that our neutralizing anti-KDR antibodies interact with distinct epitopes on KDR molecule. Using alanine-scanning mutagenesis, we have characterized the functional epitopes within KDR domain 3 for binding to neutralizing anti-KDR antibodies and to the natural ligand, VEGF. Our studies indicate that two neutralizing anti-KDR antibodies, MAB383 and MAB664, bind to nonoverlapping epitopes within domain 3. Further, we have identified a subset of residues within this domain important for binding to VEGF. Taken together, our data provide a basis for the mechanism of action of our anti-KDR antibodies and for developing other classes of antagonists to the receptor. A panel of anti-KDR antibodies were generated from mice immunized with a fusion protein consisting of the full extracellular region of KDR fused to human alkaline phosphatase (AP), using both conventional hybridoma technique and antibody phage display library as described previously (19.Zhu Z. Rockwell P. Lu D. Kotanides H. Pytowski B. Hicklin D.J. Bohlen P. Witte L. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3209-3214PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, MAB383, MAB664, and MAB413 are hybridoma-derived murine monoclonal antibodies (18.Witte L. Hicklin D.J. Zhu Z. Pytowski B. Kotanides H. Rockwell P. Bohlen P. Cancer Met.

For VEGF binding, the KDR deletion mutants were incubated with VEGF coated plates, followed by detection with a rabbit anti-AP antibody-HRP conjugate (21.Lu D. Kotanides H. Zhou Q. Jimenez X.

A gene segment encoding KDR domain 3 (from Tyr221to Ser334) was amplified by PCR using the following primers: The DNA fragment (∼400 base pairs) was purified on agarose gel, digested with SfiI and NotI, and ligated into the pCANTAB 5E phagemid vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to create the construct phKDR-D3. In this construct KDR domain 3 is inserted between the leader sequence and the encoding sequence of the M13 gene III for displaying on phage surface (see Fig. 3, top panel). For assay purposes, a short DNA segment encoding a factor Xa cleavage site and a 13-amino acid-long polypeptide tag, the E tag (19.Zhu Z. Rockwell P. Lu D. Kotanides H. Pytowski B. Hicklin D.J. Bohlen P. Witte L. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3209-3214PubMed Google Scholar), were inserted between the C terminus of KDR and the gene III sequence. Mutations in phKDR-D3 were made by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using the QuickChangeTM kit (Strategene, La Jolla, CA), following the manufacturer's instructions and were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Escherichia coli strain TG1 cells were transformed with the phagemid and selected on 2× YTAG plates (2× YT plus ampicillin at 100 μg/ml and 2% glucose) as described previously (19.Zhu Z. Rockwell P. Lu D. Kotanides H. Pytowski B. Hicklin D.J. Bohlen P. Witte L. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3209-3214PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare monovalent phage, individual TG1 colonies were grown at 37 °C in 2× YTAG medium to log phase, infected with M13 KO7 helper phage (Strategen), and grown overnight at 30 °C in 2× YTAK medium (2× YTA plus kanamycin at 50 μg/ml) to produce phage particles. TheE. coli cells were removed by centrifugation, and the culture supernatant was mixed with 15 volume of 25% PEG (molecular weight, 8000)/2.5 m NaCl and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min to precipitate the phage particles. The phage pellet was resuspended in PBS, and the phage titer was determined (23.Cabilly S. Heldman J. Heldman E. Katchalski-Katzir E. Cabilly S. Combinatorial Peptide Library Protocol. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1998: 175-183Google Scholar). 96-well Maxi-sorp plates (Nunc) were coated with either anti-E tag antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or various anti-KDR antibodies (100 μl/well at 1 μg/ml in PBS) overnight at 4 °C. The plates were washed twice with PBS and incubated with blocking buffer (3% fat-free milk in PBS) at 37 °C for 2 h. The amplified phage were blocked with 16 volume of 18% milk/6× PBS at room temperature for 2 h and serially diluted in blocking buffer and then transferred to the antibody-coated plates. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, the plates were washed three times with PBS/0.2% Tween-20, followed by incubation with an anti-M13 antibody-HRP conjugate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 1:5000 dilution) in blocking buffer for an additional 1 h. The plates were washed four times with PBS/0.2% Tween-20, developed using the TMB peroxidase substrate (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD), stopped with 1m H2SO4, and read spectrophotometrically at 450 nm (19.Zhu Z.

Binding of each alanine mutant to anti-KDR antibodies was calculated as a relative value to that of the wild type domain 3 following the formula: Relative binding of alanine mutant = R(mut)/R(wt), where R(mut)=Mutant binding (A450 nm)to anti­KDR antibodyMutant binding (A450 nm)to anti­E tag antibodyEquation 1 R(wt)=Wild­type binding (A450 nm)to anti­KDR antibodyWild­type binding (A450 nm)to anti­E tag antibodyEquation 2 Mutations within domain 3 were generated by overlapping PCR using KDR (1.Terman B.I.

The conditioned media were collected at 48 and 96 h after transfection, pooled, and concentrated using Centricon-10 (Amicon Corp., Beverly, MA). The concentration of each protein variant was determined by Western blot analysis using an anti-AP antibody as the detecting agent. 96-well Maxi-sorp plates were coated with VEGF165 or various anti-KDR antibodies (100 μl/well at 1 μg/ml in PBS) overnight at 4 °C.

A model of KDR domain 3 of was constructed using the crystal structure of telokin, an abundant smooth muscle protein with an amino acid sequence identical to that of the C-terminal region of smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (Protein Data Bank identification number 1TLK) (24.Holden H.M. Ito M. Hartshorne D.J. Rayment I. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 840-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) as a template. The crystal structure of Fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (Flt-1) domain 2 (Protein Data Bank identification number 1FLT) (25.Wiesmann C. Fuh G. Christinger H.W. Eigenbrot C. Wells J. de Vos A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) was used as a reference for model building. The sequences of telokin and KDR domain 3 were aligned based on conserved amino acids according to the guidelines described by Harpaz and Chothia (27.Harpaz Y. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) for immunoglobulin domains. The three-dimensional model was built using the program O (26.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). The KDR domain 3 side chains were substituted on the telokin template maintaining similar orientation. In the two sites where KDR domain 3 had an insertion relative to telokin, a two-residue loop extension was built manually, and a seven-residue strand-loop-strand segment was modeled using the O search algorithm of Protein Data Bank-derived structures. To determine the minimal domain requirements for VEGF binding and to map out the binding domains for various antibodies, a series of KDR deletion mutants were produced. Each of the seven domains of KDR was deleted from the C terminus of the extracellular region (Fig.1 A). Additional two mutants were made by removing the first or the first plus the second domains from the N terminus of the extracellular region (Fig. 1 A"

Microbiol. 1997; 23: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The preeminent mode of regulation is that exerted by Ure2p, which inhibits the ability of the GATA activators, Gln3p and Gat1p, to function during times of nitrogen excess (3.ter Schure E.G. van Riel N.A. Verrips C.T. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 13.Cooper T.G. Marzluf G. Bambrl R. Mycota III.

The second mode, whose function we consider to be one of fine tuning, is proposed to depend upon the GATA repressors Dal80p and Deh1p competing with Gln3p and Gat1p for binding to their DNA targets (13.Cooper T.G. Marzluf G. Bambrl R. Mycota III. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1994: 139-169Google Scholar, 17.Cunningham T.S. Dorrington R.A. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4718-4725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Success of the regulatory mechanism hypothesized above requires the relative amounts of Gln3p, Gat1p, Dal80-p, and Deh1p to be rigorously and finely controlled. Such fine control has been proposed to be achieved through autogenous and cross-regulation of GATA factor production (6.Cunningham T.S. Cooper T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6205-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 11.Coffman J.A. Rai R. Loprete D.M. Cunningham T. Svetlov V. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3416-3429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a view supported by (i) the presence of multiple UASNTR elements situated upstream of the DAL80,DEH1, and GAT1 genes and (ii) effects ofgln3Δ, gat1Δ,dal80::hisG, and deh1Δ mutations on expression of the three genes (3.ter Schure E.G. van Riel N.A.

Microbiol. 1997; 23: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although the model fits existing data, its central tenant has not been tested experimentally,i.e. that expression of one GATA factor, GAT1, influences expression of another, DAL80. The purpose of this work was to test the above proposal by determining the effects of varying GAT1 expression on that ofDAL80. The data obtained demonstrate that DAL80expression is tightly linked to that of GAT1 and furthermore that NCR can be tightly linked to the relative production of Gat1p and Ure2p, i.e. that changing the relative levels ofGAT1 and URE2 expression concomitantly changes the sensitivity of DAL80 expression to NCR. We also find that the intracellular localization of EGFP-Gat1p is influenced by the levels of GAT1 and URE2 expression. When Gat1p-dependent transcription is high, EGFP-Gat1p is predominantly nuclear, whereas when it is inhibited by overproduction of Ure2p, Gat1p is cytoplasmic. The strains used are: TCY1 (Matα lys2 ura3), TCY5 (Matα lys2 ura3 trp1::hisG), TCY29 (Matα lys2 ura3 trp1::hisGdal80::hisG), TCY46 (Matα lys2 ura3 trp1::hisG GAL1,10-GAT1), TCY48 (Matα lys2 ura3 trp1::hisG dal80::hisG GAL1,10-GAT1), TCY57 (Matα lys2 ura3 trp1::hisG leu2::hisG GAL1,10-URE2), TCY60 (Matα lys2 ura3 trp1::hisG leu2::hisG dal80::hisG GAL1,10-GAT1 GAL1,10-URE2), RRJ715 (Matα, lys2, ura3, his3, gat1Δ::hisG), RTC57 (Matα, lys2,trp1,his3,ura3,URE2-GAL1–10), and GYC86 (Mata, his3,leu2,trp1,ura3/Matα, his3,leu2,trp1,ura3). Minimal medium was 0.17% YNB without amino acids or (NH4)2SO4 (Difco) with indicated carbon and nitrogen sources and auxotrophic requirements. Yeast cultures for RNA analysis (see Figs. 2 and 4 A) were grown in minimal proline galactose (2%) medium with glucose added to the final concentration indicated in the figure.

For GAT1, the 0.8-kbSalI-XhoI promoter fragment was cloned into pBSKS(+) (Stratagene) yielding pTSC613. The 0.8-kbApaI-SalI GAT1 fragment of pTSC613 was cloned into pLitmus38 yielding pTSC614. pTSC614 was digested withBsgI, and the backbone was isolated, deleting the 0.3-kbGAT1 BsgI fragment containing clustered GATAs. A blunt-ended polylinker (BsrGI to MfeI) from pLitmus38 was cloned into the BsgI site of the plasmid backbone, following Klenow treatment of the linearized DNA, yielding pTSC620. A Klenow-treated, EcoRI TRP1 fragment from YRp7 was digested with PstI and cloned into pTSC620 digested withHindIII, treated with Klenow, and then digested withPstI, yielding pTSC627. The GAL1,10 promoter fragment was generated by Pwo PCR with oligonucleotide primers, 5′-GATCGCCGGCCCTTCTCTTTGGAACTTTCAGTAAT-3′ and 5′-GATCGCCGGCTCGCTGATTAATTACCCAGAA-3′, and pEG(KG) (20.Mitchell D.A.

Because the URE2 promoter lacks a TATA box, the above PCR product included the GAL1,10 TATA box and transcription start site(s) (22.Johnston M. Davis R. Mol. Cell.

ASalI-XhoI LEU2 fragment (2.Wiame J.-M. Grenson M. Arst H. Adv. Microb.

The SalI-XhoI andSalI-ApaI fragments of pTSC645 and pTSC657, respectively, were purified and used to transform the relevant strains. Integrants were verified by Southern blot analysis using multiple restriction endonucleases (data not shown). A BamHI oligonucleotide (10-mer) was ligated into GAT1 pTSC645 digested with XhoI and treated with Klenow polymerase. The 0.9-kb XbaI-BamHI fragment containing the 5′ end of TRP1, GAL1,10 UAS and the 5′ end of GAT1 (to position +193) was isolated and ligated into plasmid pHP41 (23.Park H.-D. Luche R.M. Cooper T.G.

The 0.7-kbXhoI-BamHI fragment (containing the GAL1,10 UAS and the 5′ end of URE2 to position +103) was ligated into pHP41 treated with SalI and BamHI, yielding pTSC668 (Fig. 1). For GAL1,10-DAL80, the 0.9-kbAsp718-PvuII fragment from pTSC674 was cloned into Litmus 28 to yield pTSC678. A BamHI oligonucleotide (10-mer) was ligated onto the blunt ends of pTSC678 digested withPvuII. The 0.9-kb XbaI-BamHI fragment from this plasmid (containing the 3′ end of HIS3,GAL1,10 UAS and DAL80 5′ end to position +46) was isolated and ligated into pHP41, yielding pTSC679 (Fig. 1).

Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). All fusion junctions were sequenced to ensure they were in frame. Cytological experiments were performed as described elsewhere (25.Scott S. Dorrington R. Svetlov V. Beeser A.E. Distler M. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7198-7204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The distribution of fluorescent material was the same whether cells were grown in Wickerham's or YNB minimal medium. Dissecting the regulatory relationships of the GATA transcription factors is hampered by their extensive autogenous- and cross-regulation (11.Coffman J.A. Rai R. Loprete D.M. Cunningham T. Svetlov V. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3416-3429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Soussi-Boudekou S. Vissers S. Urrestarazu A. Jauniaux J.-C. Andre B. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To overcome this, we replaced the genomic GAT1 promoter with a GAL1,10 fragment (UAS GAL), thereby removing GAT1expression from nitrogen and GATA factor control and placing it under galactose regulation. Because our experiments depended upon the transcription profile of the GAL1,10-GAT1 construct, we measured steady-state levels of GAT1-specific mRNA following three different glucose additions to the medium.GAT1 mRNA increased as glucose decreased (Fig.2 A). Next, we substituted thelacZ open reading frame for the GAT1 open reading frame in CEN-based GAL1,10-GAT1 pTSC666, measured β-galactosidase production under conditions similar to those in Fig.2 A, and found β-galactosidase activity decreased as the amount of glucose added to the medium increased (Fig. 2 B). The inverse of the glucose addition was plotted on the abscissa throughout this work to facilitate visualization of the effects ofGAL1,10 driven GAT1 or URE2expression. As expected, GAL1,10-GAT1 expression is NCR-insensitive (Fig. 2 B). In fact,GAL1,10-GAT1-lacZ expression is 2- and 4-fold higher, respectively, with glutamine and ammonia compared with proline. This effect probably derives from ammonia and glutamine being significantly better nitrogen sources than proline and hence supporting higher synthetic capacities (26.Kovari L. Sumrada R. Kovari I. Cooper T.G. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 5087-5097Google Scholar). A predicted consequence of the cross-regulation model of GATA factor control (11.Coffman J.A. Rai R. Loprete D.M. Cunningham T. Svetlov V. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3416-3429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is that the level of GAT1expression influences DAL80 expression. We tested this prediction using a DAL80-lacZ reporter. We recognized from the outset that interpretation of our results could be compromised by: (i) down-regulation of DAL80-lacZ expression by Dal80p derived from the genomic DAL80 gene responding to increased Gat1p (6.Cunningham T.S. Cooper T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6205-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and (ii) secondary effects of growing cells with galactose as carbon source. We eliminated the first complication by performing our experiments in dal80::hisG disruption strain TCY48. To evaluate the second potential complication, we compared β-galactosidase production in wild type (TCY5) anddal80::hisG disruption (TCY29) strains transformed using DAL80-lacZ pTSC572. The only difference in theDAL80-lacZ expression profile was a 20–30% decrease with galactose as carbon source (Fig. 2 C), a relatively modest effect relative to that of NCR. With the experimental system established, we determined the effect of varying GAT1 expression on DAL80-lacZ expression in TCY48. As the glucose concentration decreased (GAT1 expression increased), DAL80-lacZ expression increased (Fig.3). In addition to the DAL80expression expected when proline was provided as nitrogen source, increasing GAT1 expression unexpectedly increasedDAL80-lacZ expression with ammonia and glutamine as nitrogen sources as well (Fig. 3). To place this result in perspective,DAL80-lacZ expression with ammonia as nitrogen source in Fig. 3 (3,969 units) is about 300-fold greater than normal (glutamine, 12 units) (11.Coffman J.A. Rai R. Loprete D.M. Cunningham T. Svetlov V. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3416-3429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In short, increasing GAT1 expression overcomes the repressive effects of preferred nitrogen sources onDAL80-lacZ expression. The current model of NCR proposes that the binding of Ure2p to Gln3p inhibits its ability to function as a transcriptional activator (27.Blinder D. Coschigano P. Magasanik B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4734-4736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because Ure2p also regulates Gat1p-dependent NCR-sensitive transcription (9.Coffman J.A. Rai R. Cunningham T. Svetlov V. Cooper T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 847-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), we determined whether increasing URE2 and GAT1expression simultaneously would inhibit the ability of GAT1to suppress the NCR sensitivity of DAL80-lacZ expression. Because the GAL1,10-URE2 construct could not be made in exactly the same way as GAL1,10-GAT1, we first determined whether the overall GAL1,10-URE2 transcription profile was similar to that of GAL1,10-GAT1 (Fig. 2). Fig.4 (A and B) shows that it was, except for a modest decrease in β-galactosidase production at the highest levels of URE2 expression; the reason for this decrease is unknown. We found that increasingURE2 and GAT1 expression together (Fig.5 A, solid lines) dramatically suppressed the ability of GAT1 overexpression (Fig.5 A, dotted lines) to support high level DAL80-lacZ expression with proline or ammonia as nitrogen source. Moreover, DAL80-lacZ expression with GAT1 andURE2 both overexpressed was fully NCR-sensitive. These data show that high level URE2 expression neutralizes the effects of overexpressing GAT1. Furthermore, increasingGAL1,10-URE2 expression (in TCY57) abrogated the need of an excess nitrogen “signal,” i.e. as URE2expression increased in a culture provided with a nonrepressive nitrogen source (proline), β-galactosidase production (DAL80-lacZ expression) correspondingly decreased (Fig.5 B). We previously showed a correlation between intracellular distribution of a GATA factor, Gln3p, and NCR-sensitive gene expression. 2Cox, K. H., Rai, R., Distler, M., Daugherty, J. R., Coffman, J., and Cooper, T. G. (2000) J. Biol. Chem., in press. Therefore, we wanted to determine whether DAL80 expression correlated with the localization of Gat1p. We constructed ADH1-EGFP-GAT1pRA27 and used it to transform gat1Δ (RRJ715) cells. In this strain Ure2p is produced at wild type levels, and GAT1is constitutively overexpressed. DAL80 was highly expressed in the transformants (Fig. 4 C, lane B). When the experiment was repeated in strain RTCY57, which overproduces Ure2p, noDAL80 expression was detected (Fig. 4 C), confirming the observations in Fig. 5 A. When similarly prepared cultures were viewed microscopically, EGFP-Gat1p fluorescence was predominantly nuclear when URE2 was expressed at wild type levels (Fig. 6, K–Y) and co-localized with DAPI-stained material (panels a–i). On the other hand, no nuclear localization was observed whenURE2 was overexpressed and DAL80 expression was inhibited (Fig. 4 C). Fluorescence rather appeared in the cytoplasm as punctate spots (Fig. 6, A–J) similar to those observed when cultures were transformed with GFP-URE2 pNVS22 (data not shown, but it appears as in Fig. 9 of Cox et al. 2 and as reported earlier by Wickner's laboratory (28.Edskes H.K. Gray V., T. Wickner R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1498-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar)). The cross-regulation model (11.Coffman J.A. Rai R. Loprete D.M. Cunningham T. Svetlov V. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3416-3429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of GATA factor regulation inS. cerevisiae posits that GAT1 expression directly regulates the level of DAL80 expression and hence Dal80p production. To test this prediction we circumvented the complex normal cross-regulation observed among GATA factor genes and their products by substituting GAL1,10 for the GAT1 and/orURE2 promoters and demonstrated that we could obtain cultures containing differing amounts of GAT1 andURE2 expression and mRNA, which implies they also produced differing amounts of Gat1p and Ure2p. Using this experimental system, we demonstrated that DAL80-lacZ expression (i) depended upon GAT1 expression, (ii) became significantly insensitive to NCR when GAT1 was overexpressed, and (iii) regained NCR sensitivity when URE2 was simultaneously overexpressed with GAT1. To further evaluate the relationship between GAT1 andDAL80 expression, we plotted GAL1,10-GAT1-lacZexpression data from Fig. 2 B as a function ofDAL80-lacZ expression (Fig. 3). A linear relationship exists at all but the highest levels of GAT1 expression with proline as nitrogen source (Fig. 7). This linear relationship is not observed with glutamine as nitrogen source until GAL1,10-GAT1-lacZ expression was much higher (Fig.7 B). A similar relationship was also observed with ammonia (Fig. 7 C). These data are expected of a situation in which functional Gat1p is “titrating” an inhibitor with ammonia or glutamine as nitrogen sources, and increased DAL80-lacZexpression is not observed until Gat1p excedes a critical level, thereafter overcoming inhibition. Data in Fig. 5 suggest that the molecule Gat1p is likely titrating is Ure2p, because the effects of increased GAT1 expression are suppressed whenURE2 expression is simultaneously increased. These results are consistent with the possibility that Gat1p forms a complex with Ure2p as has been suggested for Gln3p (27.Blinder D. Coschigano P. Magasanik B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4734-4736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Microscopic evidence extended the relationship between Gat1p and Ure2p by demonstrating that Gat1p is localizes predominantly to the nucleus when Gat1p-dependent transcription is occurring and is cytoplasmic when this transcription is inhibited by overproduction of Ure2p. In other words, Ure2p prevents Gat1p from reaching its physiological target, the GATA elements in NCR-sensitive gene promoters. A similar conclusion was reached for control of Gln3p operation from analysis of CAN1 expression.2 Taken together, the data lead us to suggest that expression of GATA factor-regulated genes depends upon binding of the transcriptional activators Gln3p and Gat1p to their promoter targets and that once bound the activators are able to mediate transcriptional activation and gene expression. Although a negative observation, the finding that Gln3p tethered to DNA by LexAp mediates reporter gene transcription that exhibits little if any NCR-sensitive control (29.Cunningham T.S. Svetlov V. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 178: 3470-3479Crossref Google Scholar) is consistent with this proposal. From this perspective, GATA factor regulation is achieved by regulating its binding to its promoter targets. At a coarse level this most likely occurs by regulating Gln3p and Gat1p access to the nucleus that is regulated by Ure2p. At a fine level, once the transcriptional activators have gained access to the nucleus, their overall level of operation is regulated by competition with the transcriptional repressors Dal80p and Deh1p for DNA binding. The fluidity and fine nature of the overall regulation is then achieved by the fact that production of three of the four GATA factors is autogenously and cross-regulated. Data in Fig. 5 B highlight an important characteristic of Ure2p participation in the NCR regulatory cascade. Increasing the intracellular concentration of Ure2p appears to eliminate the need for the physiological signal that intracellular nitrogen is in excess. This observation is consistent with the ideas that: (i) Ure2p exists as an inactive form that is activated in response to a signal indicating nitrogen excess and (ii) Ure2p exists in an active form that is inactivated in response to a signal indicating nitrogen limitation. By this reasoning, signal(s) generated in response to intracellular nitrogen excess or limitation can be circumvented by increasing the concentration of Ure2p or neutralizing negative control exerted by Ure2p by increasing the concentration of at least one of the GATA activators, in this case Gat1p. The simplest basis for such concentration-dependent control is protein-protein complex formation among the constituents of the regulatory circuit. As this manuscript was being written, four reports simultaneously appeared reaching conclusions to which ours are both similar and complementary (30.Beck T. Hall M.N.

Although there is not full agreement on the mechanistic details, all propose that Ure2p complexes with one form or another of Gln3p, thereby preventing its entry into the nucleus when cells are grown in rich medium, and one of them demonstrated the proposed Gln3p nuclear and cytoplasmic localization (30.Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). A similar model was proposed for Gat1p, although the investigators were unable to show any interaction between Gat1p and Ure2p. Our work points to such an interaction and contributes to filling this missing link in the proposed models. We thank Dr. R. Rai for pRR351 (T7–7-GAT1), Tim Higgins for preparing the artwork, and the UT Yeast Group for suggested improvements to the manuscript."

The search for new molecules has led to the study of naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides as a foundation on which to target the lysis of microorganisms by mechanisms that do not aid in the proliferation of resistant strains (1.Hancock R.E.W. Lancet. 1997; 349: 418-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar, 2.Hancock R.E.W. Lehrer R.

Synthetic Aspects of Biologically Active Cyclic Peptides: Gramicidin S and Tyrocidines. Halsted Press, New York1979: 49-89Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanism of antimicrobial action is uncertain at present, evidence suggests that peptide accumulation in the bacterial membrane results in a permeability increase and loss of barrier function (2.Hancock R.E.W. Lehrer R. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 82-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar, 5.La Rocca P. Shai Y. Sansom M.S. Biophys.

Since these molecules target the cell membrane, the development of resistance is unlikely, as this would require multiple mutations in the metabolic pathways leading to cell membrane synthesis and also necessitate structural rearrangements of the membrane itself. To define the mechanism of action of these peptides in greater detail, it is first essential to delineate the structural features of the molecules that are requisite for their functional behavior. An understanding of the structure-function relationship should not only allow the development of more efficacious molecules, but may also give an indication of how the membrane can be targeted in a more productive manner. The structure-function relationship is also essential for the purposes of determining the factors that specify the toxicity of the gramicidin S derivatives for higher eukaryotic cells and thus for decoupling the deleterious side effects of these compounds from their useful therapeutic benefit.At present, a series of recently reported peptides based on the 14-residue gramicidin S derivative (GS14) show considerable potential for development of novel antimicrobial agents since they have high specificity as indicated by high antimicrobial activity and low hemolytic function (7.Kondejewski L.H. Jelokhani-Niaraki M. Farmer S.W. Lix B. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Hancock R.E.W. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13181-13192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). GS14 is a 14-residue head-to-tail cyclic molecule that possesses a poor therapeutic index (ratio of antimicrobial action to hemolytic activity). The NMR structure of GS14 has been previously determined and shown to exist as a completely amphipathic antiparallel β-sheet structure, i.e. with the 6 hydrophobic residues on one face of the β-sheet and the 4 hydrophilic basic residues on the opposite face (8.Gibbs A.C.

Structure-function analysis of these analogs and of other types of antimicrobial peptides suggests that the requisite features for antimicrobial activity include a defined secondary structure in conjunction with amphipathic separation of hydrophobic residues on one face and basic residues on the opposing face (1.Hancock R.E.W.

Further studies have also shown that high amphipathicity, in addition to high hydrophobicity, contributes to elevated hemolytic activity, whereas an inverse correlation has been observed between these properties and antimicrobial action for a variety of antimicrobial peptides (9.Kondejewski L.H.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). A recent study in particular illustrated this for a series of diastereomeric peptides of GS14 in which each residue in the molecule was systematically replaced by its enantiomer (7.Kondejewski L.H. Jelokhani-Niaraki M. Farmer S.W. Lix B. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Hancock R.E.W. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13181-13192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The results demonstrated that the RP-HPLC1 measure of amphipathicity was directly correlated with hemolytic activity and inversely correlated with antimicrobial activity. Thus, the diastereomers possessing some of the lowest amphipathicities possessed the greatest specificity for microbes over erythrocytes as measured using a therapeutic index defined as the ratio of hemolytic activity to antimicrobial activity. These data, coupled with CD experiments, indicate that disruption of the β-sheet structure of the GS14 molecule by the incorporation of enantiomeric substitutions reduces the amphipathic character of the parent molecule and results in more desirable functional activity. Despite the understanding in terms of relative amphipathicity and the indication of structural perturbation by CD analysis, a precise conformational analysis of the diastereomeric analogs is not at present available. Structure determination using NMR is currently the only method by which the detailed conformational features of these peptides can be assessed and is essential for the development of a structure-function profile for this potential new class of antimicrobial therapeutic agents. This study therefore reports on the use of NMR techniques to study the solution structure of GS14 peptides to elucidate the structural changes induced by introduction of enantiomeric substitutions and thus to characterize at the molecular level the basis for the decreased amphipathicity of the potential therapeutic analogs. Furthermore, on the basis of the derived structural information, we have designed a novel analog that possesses similar desirable properties to the best GS14 diastereomer, with the exception that it exists in a preformed β-sheet structure.RESULTSRationale for Structural Analysis of GS14 AnalogsThe systematic replacement of each of the residues of GS14 by its enantiomeric counterpart revealed that a gradated profile exists for disruption of the β-sheet and the amphipathic nature compared with the parent molecule (7.Kondejewski L.H. Jelokhani-Niaraki M. Farmer S.W. Lix B. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Hancock R.E.W. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13181-13192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). From this series of diastereomers, GS14K4 was selected for structure determination since it displayed the highest efficacy in terms of maximizing antimicrobial activity and minimizing hemolytic action, i.e. it exhibited the highest therapeutic index. As shown in Table I, the creation of GS14K4 by the incorporation of an enantiomeric substitution at position 4 of the GS14 framework resulted in a significantly lower retention time on RP-HPLC compared with GS14 itself. Peptide interaction with reversed-phase matrices is mediated primarily through hydrophobic interactions. In the case of GS14, which exists as a highly amphipathic β-sheet compound, interaction occurs with the large hydrophobic face of the molecule. Since GS14 and GS14K4 have exactly the same residue composition and sequence and thus identical intrinsic hydrophobicities, any differences in their behavior on RP-HPLC are due to differences in their structure and, more specifically, differences in their amphipathicity. Thus, the decreased retention time of GS14K4 relative to GS14 is due to decreased amphipathicity of this analog. The decreased amphipathicity of GS14K4 relative to GS14 results in decreased hemolytic activity, as shown in Table I. Whereas GS14 is highly hemolytic at both 10 and 100 μg/ml, GS14K4 exhibits negligible hemolysis at these concentrations. As shown in TableII, the decreased amphipathicity of GS14K4 also results in increased antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms. GS14 is essentially inactive against the Gram-negative microorganisms shown, with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 128 μg/ml, whereas GS14K4 exhibits moderate activity against these microorganisms, with a minimum inhibitory concentration on the order of 10-fold lower than that of GS14. Similarly, whereas GS14 exhibits moderate activity against the Gram-positive microorganisms shown in Table II, GS14K4 is significantly more active against these microorganisms.Table IAmphipathicity and hemolytic activity of GS14 analogsPeptideSequenceaShown are the linear sequences of cyclic peptides.

Open table in a new tab The structural basis for the decreased amphipathicity of the GS14 diastereomers was not directly apparent from the CD studies of this series of peptides in water since most of the peptides exhibited similar CD spectra under aqueous conditions (7.Kondejewski L.H. Jelokhani-Niaraki M. Farmer S.W. Lix B. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Hancock R.E.W. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13181-13192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). However, in the corresponding TFE analyses, significant differences were observed with each analog. Of the diastereomeric series, next to GS14, GS14K4 displayed the most negative ellipticity at 220 nm, and the spectrum of this analog indicated an inducement of structure in TFE that was not observed with any of the other analogs. The CD spectra of GS14 and GS14K4 in aqueous and aqueous/TFE environments are shown in Fig.1. It has been shown by NMR spectroscopy that both gramicidin S and GS14 possess a similar β-sheet conformation and that they also exhibit similar CD spectra with large negative ellipticities at 206 and 223 nm (7.Kondejewski L.H. Jelokhani-Niaraki M. Farmer S.W. Lix B. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Hancock R.E.W. Hodges R.S. J. Biol.

The atypical β-sheet spectra exhibited by these cyclic peptides can be attributed to a combination of β-sheet structure, aromatic residues, and type II′ β-turns (25.Woody R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 34-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar).Under aqueous conditions (Fig. 1 A), the two large negative minima at 208 and 220 nm exhibited by GS14 are indicative of β-sheet structure, whereas the substantial decrease in molar ellipticity at 220 nm exhibited by GS14K4 indicates that the β-sheet structure of this peptide has been disrupted (7.Kondejewski L.H. Jelokhani-Niaraki M. Farmer S.W. Lix B. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Hancock R.E.W. Hodges R.S. J. Biol.

In the presence of TFE, however, GS14K4 exhibits a substantial increase in secondary structure, as is apparent from the greatly increased molar ellipticity at 220 nm (Fig.1 B). From the CD and HPLC analyses of the diastereomers (7.Kondejewski L.H. Jelokhani-Niaraki M. Farmer S.W. Lix B. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Hancock R.E.W. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13181-13192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), it is apparent that lowered amphipathicity and TFE-induced structural change are requisite features for the development of high antimicrobial activity and low hemolytic toxicity. The apparent conformational properties of GS14K4 and the specificity of its functional activity set it apart from the other diastereomers and predicate its study via structure determination by NMR spectroscopy. To this end, a series of NMR spectra were acquired for GS14K4, both under aqueous conditions and in varying concentrations of TFE.NMR Spectroscopy and Structure Determination of GS14K4Data Analysis under Aqueous ConditionsA complete assignment of most proton resonances of GS14K4 was made in H2O and TFE using standard two-dimensional experiments, and an initial examination of amide and α-proton shifts was used on a comparative basis as an indication of the structural differences between this diastereomer and the GS14 parent molecule (8.Gibbs A.C. Kondejewski L.H. Gronwald W. Nip A.M. Hodges R.S. Wishart D.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These are illustrated in Fig.2 for the aqueous data and indicate thatd-lysine for l-lysine substitution at position 4 of GS14 has the greatest effect on residues that constitute the opposite strand of the β-sheet, which is composed of residues 8–12. The residues that exhibit the greatest perturbation are Lys9 and Lys11, which have Δδ values of 0.27 and 0.15 ppm, respectively. All of the changes were to lower frequency, indicating that the β-sheet of GS14 is destabilized by placement of the d-lysine at position 4, although the chemical shift index of this analog (data not shown) suggests that the α-proton values still fall within the range expected for this type of secondary structure (22.Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 311-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1780) Google Scholar, 23.Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar). Further examination of the experimental NMR parameters such as amide proton temperature coefficients and cross-strand NOEs implies that GS14K4 is dynamic in aqueous solution. To determine the nature of the conformational change, ensembles of solution structures were calculated for GS14K4 under aqueous conditions. From the data sets collected for the peptide in water, 102 NOESY distance restraints (13 non-sequential NOEs of which 6 were cross-strand) and seven torsion angle restraints were obtained and used in X-PLOR simulated annealing calculations to generate a family of structures that satisfied the experimental data. From superposition of the structural ensemble, it is apparent that significant flexibility of the molecule exists in the aqueous environment, at least in part because of a limited number of experimental restraints; however, a major and minor family of structures are present. From observation of the major conformation, it is evident that under these conditions, GS14K4 partially exists in a β-sheet-like secondary structure as evidenced by the φ and ψ torsion angles that fall within the range for a antiparallel sheet. There is also evidence from the ensemble for proximity of cross-strand atoms, including the α-protons of residues 4 and 9 and residues 2 and 11, and for the expected cross-strand hydrogen bonds between Leu3 and Val10, Lys5 and Leu8, and Val1 and Leu12, thus further indicating that this diastereomer exists in a β-sheet-like conformation. In addition, the two type II′ β-turns that are present in GS14 are also observed in a similar conformation in GS14K4 and therefore allow the two strands to be brought into proximity to form the antiparallel sheet. Comparison of the average structures for GS14 (8.Gibbs A.C. Kondejewski L.H. Gronwald W. Nip A.M. Hodges R.S. Wishart D.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and GS14K4 in water indicates that they adopt similar backbone conformations in this environment. The two peptides also adopt similar side chain conformations, with the exception of Lys4 in GS14K4, which is no longer on the hydrophilic face of the sheet, but is now placed on the opposite face along with the 6 hydrophobic residues. The presence of thed-amino acid on this face confirms previous suggestions and gives a strong indication of the reduced amphipathicity of this analog compared with GS14. The significant changes in the α-proton chemical shifts between the two analogs for lysines 9 and 11 (Fig. 2) are most probably the consequence of movements in the backbone conformation required to accommodate the interchange of lysine 4 from the hydrophilic face to the hydrophobic side of the molecule.Figure 2Plot of the α-proton chemical shift differences between GS14 and GS14K4. Positive bars represent upfield changes in the chemical shifts of the α-protons of GS14K4 from those observed with GS14 and indicate disruption of β-sheet structure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Data Analysis in Aqueous TrifluoroethanolTo examine the structure of GS14K4 in a structure-promoting solvent and also in a membrane-mimicking environment, a series of NMR spectra were acquired for this analog in varying concentrations of TFE/H2O. As shown in Fig. 3, which depicts the amide proton region of the one-dimensional spectra at the TFE concentrations indicated, addition of TFE and increasing its concentration resulted in a significant increase in the dispersion of the amide proton chemical shifts. This result suggests the induction of β-sheet secondary structure, and further evidence is provided by examination of the α-proton resonance chemical shifts, which underwent dramatic downfield shifts from 0 to 50% TFE at the expected positions for the close contact of the α-protons across the strands of the β-sheet. Lysines 2, 4, 9, and 11 have Δδ values between water and TFE environments of 0.51, 0.71, 0.58, and 0.43 ppm, respectively, in addition to the smaller but significant shifts for the other residues involved in the two β-strands. Interpretation of the NOESY cross-peaks for GS14K4 in 30% TFE reveals that there is a substantial increase over the data acquired in water in the number and intensity of cross-strand NOEs corresponding to those expected for the β-sheet structure, as shown in Fig. 4. The evident inducement of secondary structure with the addition of TFE warranted further investigation, and to this end, structure calculations were performed using the 194 NOE-derived distances (including 31 non-sequential NOEs of which 23 were cross-strand) and eight coupling constant-derived dihedral restraints for the data set collected at 30% TFE/water. After refinement of the solution ensemble, a major family of structures was identified and demonstrated to adopt a similar but better defined structure compared with that observed under aqueous conditions. The backbone exhibits high definition with a root mean square deviation of 0.610 ± 0.105 Å; however, it is quite flexible at residues 4 and 5 due to the absence of a dihedral restraint for the d-lysine. The backbone dihedrals all fall within the range of values expected for an antiparallel β-sheet, with the exception of the turn residues and Lys4. The φ and ψ values for Lys4 are shifted by 180o relative to the other strand residues, which is an expected result for thed-amino acid configuration. The backbone dihedral angles for the structure generated for GS14K4 in 30% TFE/H2O are shown in Table III.Figure 3Amide region of the one-dimensional NMR spectrum of GS14K4 acquired at 600 MHz under aqueous conditions and in varying concentrations of TFE.

As shown in Fig. 5, the d-lysine at position 4 projects onto the hydrophobic face of the β-sheet, whereas the other 3 lysine residues occupy the same positions on the hydrophilic face as observed in GS14. The orientation of lysine 4 on the same face as the valines and leucines gives an obvious structural rationale for the reduced amphipathicity and directed hydrophobicity of this diastereomer relative to GS14. In addition, the side chain of Val5 is rotated away from the hydrophobic face to accommodate the d-lysine projecting onto this surface. This is illustrated in Fig. 6, where the Connolly surface diagrams of the average NMR structures of GS14 and GS14K4 are presented. From this molecular surface representation of GS14K4, it is apparent that the surface of Val5 is no longer contiguous with the hydrophobic face and that the side chain of Lys4 projects onto this face. The rotation of the Val side chain away from the hydrophobic face gives further insight into the reduction in the amphipathicity and directed hydrophobicity of this analog.Figure 5Ensemble of NMR solution structures calculated for GS14K4 with the program X-PLOR using restraints obtained from the NOESY and coupling constant information acquired in 30% TFE.

Estevez R. Bertran J. Zorzano A. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 969-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The b0,+ amino acid transport system is Na+-independent and accepts zwitterionic amino acids as well as cationic amino acids as substrates (1.Palacin M. Estevez R. Bertran J. Zorzano A. Physiol.

We observed that the cloned b0,+AT interacts with 4F2hc to induce the Na+-independent transport of the zwitterionic amino acid alanine and that rBAT is unable to substitute for 4F2hc under similar conditions (10.Rajan D.P.

The 4F2hc·b0,+AT complex-induced alanine transport is inhibitable by zwitterionic amino acids as well as cationic amino acids, confirming the identity of the induced transport activity as system b0,+. Here we report an interesting finding that both 4F2hc and rBAT can interact independently with b0,+AT to induce the Na+-independent transport of the cationic amino acid arginine. Of even greater significance of the present study are the findings that although the amino transport activities induced by the two heteromeric complexes 4F2hc·b0,+AT and rBAT·b0,+AT have similar substrate specificity and represent system b0,+, there are marked differences in substrate affinities between the two complexes. The current prevailing notion is that 4F2hc and rBAT function to chaperone the associated proteins (LAT1, LAT2, y+LAT1, y+LAT2, xCT, and b0,+AT) by covalent interaction to bring the heteromeric complex to the plasma membrane, and available the evidence strongly supports such a function (3.Mastroberardino L.

Our present studies suggest that 4F2hc and rBAT also influence the catalytic function of the heteromeric complexes by modulating the substrate affinities. The studies reported here thus unravel a novel function of the heavy chains 4F2hc and rBAT in the transport activity of the heteromeric b0,+ amino acid transporter.

The cDNAs of the mouse and human b0,+ATs, human 4F2hc, and human rBAT were all cloned into pSPORT such that the sense transcription was under the control of the T7 promoter. The cDNAs were transfected into HRPE or COS-1 cells grown in 24-well tissue culture plates using Lipofectin, and the functional expression of the cDNAs was analyzed 12 h later by measuring the uptake of 3H-amino acids. One microgram of the plasmid carrying the specific cDNA (b0,+AT, 4F2hc, or rBAT) was used/well. Sister wells transfected identically with vector alone served as control. All transport measurements were made in parallel under identical conditions in cells transfected with vector alone and in cells expressing the cloned heteromeric complexes 4F2hc·b0,+AT and rBAT·b0,+AT. The transport values measured in vector-transfected cells represented the endogenous activity mediated by the amino acid transport systems expressed constitutively in these cells. These values were subtracted from the transport values measured in cells expressing the 4F2hc·b0,+AT complex or the rBAT·b0,+AT complex to calculate the transport activities attributed specifically to these complexes. The transport buffer was composed of 25 mm Hepes/Tris (pH 7.5), supplemented with 140 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine chloride, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, and 5 mm glucose. The incubation time for the transport measurements was 15 min at 37 °C following which the uptake medium was aspirated off, and the cells were washed with 2 × 2 ml of ice-cold transport buffer. The cells were then solubilized in 0.5% SDS in 0.2 N NaOH and transferred to vials, and radioactivity associated with the cells was quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The experiments were repeated two to three times with independent transfections, each done in duplicate or triplicate. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. of these replicate measurements. Adult mouse kidneys were collected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Unfixed 12-μm serial sections were prepared on a cryostat, mounted on 2% 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane-coated slides, air-dried for 10 min, and then stored at −70 °C until required. Nonradioactive in situ hybridization using digoxigenin-UTP-labeled probes was performed on tissue sections as described previously (18.Wu X. Kekuda R. Huang W. Fei Y.J. Leibach F.H. Chen J.

Riboprobes (sense and antisense) were prepared from partial fragments of mouse b0,+AT cDNA, mouse 4F2hc cDNA, and mouse rBAT cDNA. The mouse b0,+AT cDNA fragment (∼1.2 kilobase pairs) was obtained by digestion of the full-length cDNA with SalI/KpnI and subcloned into pSPORT vector. The mouse 4F2hc cDNA fragment (∼0.7 kilobase pairs) and the mouse rBAT cDNA fragment (∼1.0 kilobase pairs) were generated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction based on published nucleotide sequences of these clones (19.Parmacek M.S.

The clones were sequenced to confirm their identity and also to determine their orientation. Sense (negative control) and antisense probes were synthesized with appropriate RNA polymerases after linearization of the plasmids with suitable restriction enzymes. The riboprobes were labeled using a digoxigenin-labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The murine b0,+AT cDNA is 1795 base pairs long with an open reading frame coding for a protein of 487 amino acids (GenBankTM accession no. AF192310). The predicted amino acid sequence is highly homologous to rabbit b0,+AT with 85% identity and 93% similarity. Our previous studies have shown that rabbit b0,+AT interacts with human 4F2hc to induce Na+-independent transport of alanine and that human or rat rBAT cannot substitute for human 4F2hc in inducing alanine transport (10.Rajan D.P.

In the present study, we co-expressed mouse b0,+AT with either human 4F2hc or human rBAT and assessed the ability of these two heteromeric complexes to induce the transport of six different amino acids (Fig. 1). The concentration of the amino acids was 1 μm. The 4F2hc·b0,+AT complex was able to mediate the transport of the neutral amino acids alanine, glutamine, serine, threonine, and leucine as well as the transport of the cationic amino acid arginine. These results are similar to those reported previously with rabbit b0,+AT (10.Rajan D.P. Kekuda R. Huang W. Wang H. Devoe L.D. Leibach F.H. Prasad P.D. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29005-29010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In contrast, the rBAT·b0,+AT complex was unable to induce the transport of the neutral amino acids. Interestingly, the complex was able to mediate the transport of arginine. We then compared the substrate specificity of the transport processes associated with the 4F2hc·b0,+AT and rBAT·b0,+AT complexes. This was done by assessing the ability of unlabeled amino acids (2 mm) to inhibit the transport of [3H]glutamine (1 μm) mediated by the 4F2hc·b0,+AT complex and the transport of [3H]arginine (1 μm) mediated by the rBAT·b0,+AT complex under identical conditions (TableI). The 4F2hc·b0,+AT complex-mediated [3H]glutamine transport was completely inhibited by the neutral amino acids alanine, glutamine, and leucine as well as by the cationic amino acids arginine and lysine. The anionic amino acid glutamate and the methylated amino acid methylaminoisobutyric acid had no or minimal effect on this transport. Interestingly, the inhibitory pattern was identical in the case of rBAT·b0,+AT complex-mediated [3H]arginine transport. This transport also was almost completely abolished by neutral amino acids and cationic amino acids but not affected by glutamate and methylaminoisobutyric acid. These data show that the 4F2hc·b0,+AT complex as well as the rBAT·b0,+AT complex induce amino acid transport activities with substrate specificity similar to that of system b0,+.Table ISubstrate specificity of 4F2hc · b0,+ AT and rBAT · b 0,+ AT complexesUnlabeled amino acid4F2hc · b0,+ATrBAT · b0,+AT[3H]Glutamine uptake[3H]Arginine uptakepmol/10 6 cells/15 min%pmol/10 6 cells/15 min%None54.6 ± 2.110074.3 ± 8.1100Alanine1.6 ± 0.636.2 ± 0.68Glutamine2.1 ± 0.2411.2 ± 5.215Leucine0.7 ± 0.2111.8 ± 2.616Arginine0.5 ± 0.312.0 ± 0.13Lysine0.7 ± 0.510.4 ± 0.11Glutamate37.0 ± 2.06877.7 ± 11.7105Methylaminoisobutyric acid50.6 ± 7.69374.9 ± 7.8101HRPE cells were transfected with either human 4F2hc cDNA plus mouse b0,+ AT cDNA or human rBAT cDNA plus mouse b0,+AT cDNA. Uptake of either [3H]glutamine (4F2hc · b0,+AT complex) or [3H]arginine (rBAT · b0,+AT complex) was measured for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 2 mm unlabeled amino acids. Concentration of radiolabeled amino acids was 1 μm. Parallel uptake measurements were made in cells transfected with vector alone. These uptake values were subtracted from the uptake values obtained in cDNA-transfected cells to calculate uptake that was specific to the 4F2hc · b0,+AT complex or to the rBAT · b0,+AT complex. Open table in a new tab HRPE cells were transfected with either human 4F2hc cDNA plus mouse b0,+ AT cDNA or human rBAT cDNA plus mouse b0,+AT cDNA. Uptake of either [3H]glutamine (4F2hc · b0,+AT complex) or [3H]arginine (rBAT · b0,+AT complex) was measured for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 2 mm unlabeled amino acids. Concentration of radiolabeled amino acids was 1 μm. Parallel uptake measurements were made in cells transfected with vector alone. These uptake values were subtracted from the uptake values obtained in cDNA-transfected cells to calculate uptake that was specific to the 4F2hc · b0,+AT complex or to the rBAT · b0,+AT complex. HRPE cells possess considerable transport activity for several amino acids mediated by transport systems that are expressed constitutively in these cells. These activities were detectable in cells transfected with vector alone. We did not attempt to characterize in detail these endogenous transport activities. However, when the transport of amino acids in vector-transfected cells was analyzed, there was evidence for the expression of a b0,+-like transport activity in these cells. The evidence included the inhibition of the Na+-independent glutamine transport by various neutral amino acids as well as by cationic amino acids and also the inhibition of the Na+-independent arginine transport by various neutral amino acids as well as by cationic amino acids. There was also evidence for the expression of a transport system belonging to the cationic amino acid transport family. This was suggested by the findings that the Na+-independent transport of radiolabeled arginine was completely inhibited by unlabeled arginine, whereas neutral amino acids showed only a partial inhibitory effect. Whereas the interaction of the 4F2hc·b0,+AT complex with cationic and neutral amino acids was evident from actual transport measurements as well as from competition experiments, it was not the case with the rBAT·b0,+AT complex. The interaction of the rBAT·b0,+AT complex with cationic and neutral amino acids was demonstrable with competition experiments, whereas when actual transport measurements were made, only the transport of cationic amino acids was detectable. To determine if this difference is related to differences in substrate affinities between the two complexes, we compared the dose-response relationship for the inhibition of 4F2hc·b0,+AT complex-mediated [3H]glutamine (1 μm) transport and rBAT·b0,+AT complex-mediated [3H]arginine (1 μm) transport by three neutral amino acids (alanine, glutamine, and leucine), two cationic amino acids (arginine and lysine), and cystine (Fig. 2). The IC50 values (i.e. concentration of the amino acid causing 50% inhibition) calculated from these studies are given in TableII. These IC50 values are almost equal to K i values (i.e.inhibition constant) under the experimental conditions because the concentration of radiolabeled glutamine and arginine used in these competition experiments is 1 μm, a value severalfold lower than the known Kt values of system b0,+ for glutamine and arginine (11.Deves R. Boyd C.A.R. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 487-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). A comparison of these values indicates that the affinities of the rBAT·b0,+AT complex for neutral amino acids are three to seven times lower than the corresponding affinities of the 4F2hc·b0,+AT complex. A similar difference is seen in the case of arginine (∼10-fold difference), lysine (∼2-fold difference), and cystine (∼3-fold difference). In accordance with these findings, the rBAT·b0,+AT complex-mediated transport of the neutral amino acids alanine and glutamine became detectable when the concentration of the amino acids during uptake measurements was 50 μm instead of 1 μm (data not shown).Table IIComparison of Ki values for the inhibition of transport mediated by 4F2hc · b 0,+ AT and rBAT · b 0,+ AT complexesAmino acidK i values4F2hc · b0,+ATrBAT · b0,+ATArginine12.2 ± 1.8115.8 ± 17.9 (9.5)Alanine56.5 ± 9.2367.9 ± 43.8 (6.5)Glutamine83.2 ± 8.0413.8 ± 27.8 (5.0)Leucine26.5 ± 6.073.6 ± 8.6 (2.8)Cystine155.2 ± 27.4414.1 ± 75.9 (2.7)Lysine37.1 ± 11.672.2 ± 17.2 (2.0)Uptake measurements were made as described in Table I, except that the inhibition was assessed over a range of concentrations of unlabeled amino acids.

Open table in a new tab Uptake measurements were made as described in Table I, except that the inhibition was assessed over a range of concentrations of unlabeled amino acids.

Values in parentheses represent the ratio ofK i for rBAT · b0,+AT to the corresponding K i for 4F2hc · b0,+AT. Because the transport function of the 4F2hc·b0,+AT complex and the rBAT·b0,+AT complex was detectable with arginine as the substrate, we determined directly the affinity of the two complexes for this amino acid (Fig.3). The transport of arginine mediated by the 4F2hc·b0,+AT complex was saturable over the arginine concentration range of 2.5–60 μm. The Michaelis-Menten constant (Kt) for the transport activity was 12.4 ± 1.1 μm. This value is comparable to theK i value calculated for this amino acid (12.2 ± 1.8 μm) to inhibit glutamine transport mediated by the complex. The transport of arginine mediated by the rBAT·b0,+AT complex was also saturable but at a much higher concentration range of arginine (10–400 μm). TheKt value for the transport activity was 88.3 ± 8.7 μm. This value is comparable to theK i value for this amino acid (unlabeled form) to inhibit the transport of radiolabeled arginine mediated by the complex (115.8 ± 17.9 μm). These results are very interesting as they provide evidence for the first time that 4F2hc and rBAT actually influence the functional characteristics of the heteromeric complexes in which 4F2hc or rBAT is associated with b0,+AT as a common component. This is a novel finding because it is presently believed that 4F2hc and rBAT are only responsible for proper trafficking of the heteromeric amino acid transport complexes to the plasma membrane. These complexes consist of either 4F2hc or rBAT as the heavy chain and one of a multitude of transport proteins as the light chain. Neither the heavy chain nor the light chain is competent of amino acid transport when expressed independently. However, when co-expressed, the heavy chain and the light chain constitute a functional transport complex. The currently held notion is that the light chain is the actual transporter and that the heavy chain is obligatory to chaperone the light chain to the plasma membrane. Present studies show that the heavy chains have additional functions in the transport complexes. These subunits modulate the transport function of the complexes by influencing the substrate affinity. We were able to detect this novel function of 4F2hc and rBAT because of the fortuitous observation that b0,+AT can interact with either of these heavy chains. Apparently, this is not the case with LAT1, LAT2, y+LAT1, y+LAT2, and xCT that are assumed to interact with only 4F2hc (2.Kanai Y. Segawa H. Miyamoto K. Uchino H. Takeda E. Endou H. J. Biol.

The possible influence of 4F2hc in these transport systems could not be investigated because the light chains do not have detectable transport activity when expressed alone. In contrast, b0,+AT is able to associate with either 4F2hc or rBAT to constitute a transport-competent heteromeric complex. This made it possible to detect the influence of the heavy chains on the substrate affinity of the transport system by comparing the characteristics of the two heteromeric complexes containing either 4F2hc or rBAT as the heavy chain. While this manuscript was in preparation, there were two reports on the cloning and functional characterization of human b0,+AT (22.The International Cystinuria ConsortiumNat. Genet. 1999; 23: 52-57PubMed Google Scholar) and rat b0,+AT (21.Chairoungdua A. Segawa H. Kim J.Y. Miyamoto K.I. Haga H. Fukui Y. Mizoguchi K.I. Ito H. Takeda E. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28845-28848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These reports showed that human b0,+AT as well as rat b0,+AT were able to associate only with rBAT. 4F2hc was unable to substitute for rBAT. These results contrast with the data from our previous (10.Rajan D.P. Kekuda R. Huang W. Wang H. Devoe L.D. Leibach F.H. Prasad P.D. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29005-29010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and current studies. The functional expression of human b0,+AT and rat b0,+AT, reported by other investigators, was carried out in COS-1 or COS-7 cells (21.Chairoungdua A. Segawa H. Kim J.Y. Miyamoto K.I. Haga H.

In contrast, our studies employed HRPE cells. To determine whether the observed differences could be explained on the basis of the different cell lines used, we investigated the transport function of the 4F2hc·b0,+AT complex by co-expressing 4F2hc and mouse b0,+AT in COS-1 cells (Fig.4 A). We found that the complex was able to induce the transport of alanine, glutamine, and arginine even in COS-1 cells. An alternative possibility is that the observed differences could be because of species-dependent variations in the ability of b0,+AT to interact with 4F2hc and/or rBAT. Although mouse b0,+AT is able to associate with 4F2hc as well as rBAT, it is possible that human and rat b0,+ATs may interact only with rBAT. To test this possibility, we isolated the b0,+AT cDNA from a Caco-2 cell cDNA library and investigated its transport function when co-expressed with either 4F2hc or rBAT in HRPE cells (Fig.4 B). These studies show that human b0,+AT also is able to interact with 4F2hc as well as rBAT to constitute a functionally competent heteromeric transporter complex. Therefore, we do not have an explanation at present for the data from other groups of investigators showing that b0,+AT interacts with rBAT and not with 4F2hc. Because b0,+AT associates with 4F2hc as well as with rBAT, we investigated the regional distribution of mRNA for these three proteins in the mouse kidney by in situ hybridization (Fig.5). b0,+AT-specific mRNA was detectable in the cortex and also in the outer layer of the medulla. The hybridization signal was, however, higher in the cortex than in the outer layer of the medulla. An exactly identical pattern of expression was seen in the case of 4F2hc mRNA. In both cases, the signal was abundant in proximal convoluted tubules, but proximal straight tubules were also clearly positive for the signal. In contrast, the distribution pattern of rBAT mRNA was clearly different. The hybridization signal was more prominent in the outer layer of the medulla than in the cortex. The proximal straight tubules showed a very strong hybridization signal, but proximal convoluted tubules were also clearly positive for the signal. Even though the distribution pattern of b0,+AT mRNA was similar to that of 4F2hc mRNA but was different from that of rBAT mRNA, there were regions in the kidney where the expression of all three mRNAs overlapped with one another. It is therefore very likely that the 4F2hc·b0,+AT complex as well as the rBAT·b0,+AT complex mediate the b0,+-like amino acid transport activity in the kidney. Interestingly, there were also regions in the kidney where only the expression of rBAT mRNA was detectable with no evidence for the expression of b0,+AT mRNA and 4F2hc mRNA. The different distribution pattern of rBAT mRNA from that of b0,+AT mRNA suggests that there may be other proteins, hitherto unidentified, that interact with rBAT. We speculated in our previous paper that b0,+AT is a candidate gene for cystinuria (10.Rajan D.P. Kekuda R. Huang W. Wang H. Devoe L.D. Leibach F.H. Prasad P.D. Ganapathy V. J. Biol.

The specificity and regulation of these interactions are critical to many biological processes, including cell adhesion, angiogenesis, tumor progression, and migration (for reviews, see Refs. 1.Timpl R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar and 2.Timpl R. Brown J.C. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). The laminin family contains at least 11 chains (5α, 3β, 3γ). The newly discovered α5 chain is expressed in many fetal and adult tissues, and it is believed to be the major α chain in the adult basement membrane (3.Miner J.H. Patton B.L. Lentz S.I. Gilbert D.J.

Elimination of the laminin α5 gene has been shown to cause embryonic lethality in mice due to multiple defects, including exencephaly, syndactyly, and placental dysmorphogenesis, suggesting that the laminin α5 chain has a multifunctional role during development (4.Miner J.H. Cunningham J. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1713-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The α5 chain associates with the γ1 chain and either β1 or β2 chains to form laminin-10 and laminin-11, respectively (3.Miner J.H. Patton B.L. Lentz S.I. Gilbert D.J. Snider W.D. Jenkins N.A.

Laminin-11 has been shown to inhibit neurite outgrowth in vitro, whereas laminin-1, -2, and -4 promotes neurite outgrowth, suggesting a unique role of the α5 chain in neural development (5.Patton B.L.

The five laminin α chains share a large domain at their C-terminal region (G domain), which consists of five homologous G modules (LG1–5), each of about 200 amino acids. The LG module belongs to a superfamily and is also found in a number of other extracellular matrix proteins, including perlecan and agrin (9.Beckmann G. Hanke J. Bork P. Reich J.G. J. Mol.

Furthermore, binding sites for the heparan sulfate cell surface receptors α-dystroglycan and syndecan-1 have also been localized to this region. Relatively low sequence identity (about 28%) between the five known laminin α chains is found for these modules, and mutagenesis analysis has revealed that residues important for heparin binding are located on different LG modules in the laminin α1 and α2 chains (11.Talts J.F. Andac Z. Gohring W. Brancaccio A. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 12.Andac Z. Sasaki T. Mann K. Brancaccio A. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, functional studies of the laminin LG modules in the laminin α5 chain have not yet been carried out. In the present work, we have expressed recombinant LG4, LG5, and LG4–5 modules of the mouse laminin α5 chain. We demonstrate that the LG4 module is a major heparin and cell binding module. In addition, a heparin-binding sequence (F4, AGQWHRVSVRWG) within the LG4 module was identified by competition assays with synthetic peptides. Furthermore, we observed no direct influence of the carbohydrate moieties of the tandem module on heparin and cell binding. Mouse cDNA was used as a template in polymerase chain reaction to amplify sequences encoding the laminin α5 LG4, LG5, and LG4–5 tandem modules. Polymerase chain reaction was performed withPfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the following primers: 1) GAG AGA CTC GAG AGC CAG GAC CTT GCC TGC ACG A; 2) GAG AGA GGA TCC GGT TCC TGA GGG GCA TCC GCG; 3) GAG AGA GGA TCC TTC CAG GGG GCC TGA GAC ACA G; and 4) GAG AGA CTC GAG GTC TCA GGC CCC CTG GAA GAT G. Primers 1 and 2 were used for the tandem module (Ser3237–Thr3610), 1 and 3 for the LG4 module (Ser3237–Glu3434), and 2 and 4 for the LG5 module (Val3429–Thr3610). These primers contained the coding sequences, a XhoI site at the 5′ end (primers 1 and 4) or a BamHI site at the 3′ end (primers 2 and 3). The polymerase chain reaction products were ligated into the expression vector pBFX (15.Watanabe H. Cheung S.C. Itano N. Kimata K. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28057-28065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), a modified pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). All expression constructions were sequenced before use. The resulting expression vectors encode the interleukin 2 receptor leader sequence, a FLAG-tagged laminin α5 LG module, a factor Xa cleavage site, and the C-terminal portion of the laminin γ1 chain. The fusion to the C terminus of the laminin γ1 chain (207 amino acids) often allows stable expression of a domain or a truncated protein by the pBFX vector, and this portion does not have activity for cell and heparin binding (15 and this work). The expression plasmids were transfected into human embryonal kidney 293 cells (CRL-1573, ATCC) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and stable transfected 293 cells were established by cloning and selection with 400 μg/ml of G418 (Geneticin Liquid, Life Technologies, Inc.). Secretion of recombinant laminin modules was analyzed by Western blotting of serum-free, conditioned medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Life Technologies, Inc.) using an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma). For protein production, confluent cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and grown in serum-free medium for 1–2 days, after which the medium was harvested and replaced with serum-containing medium. Conditioned, serum-free medium was cleared of detached cells and debris through centrifugation, and proteinase inhibitors were added to final concentrations of 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The conditioned medium was applied onto an anti-FLAG M2 column (Sigma), and the column was washed with 50 mmTris-HCl, 1 m NaCl, pH 7.5, followed by 50 mmTris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. The FLAG-tagged proteins were eluted with 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 3.5, and neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, immediately after elution. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as standard (Pierce). Peptides were synthesized as described previously (16.Nomizu M. Kuratomi Y. Malinda K.M. Song S.Y. Miyoshi K. Otaka A. Powell S.K. Hoffman M.P. Kleinman H.K. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32491-32499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) or obtained from the Facility for Biotechnology Resources (United States Food and Drug Administration). The peptides were prepared with a C-terminal amide. All peptides were purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and characterized by mass spectrometry. N-Glycanase F (1.4 unit) (Oxford Glycosciences Inc., Bedford, MA), endoglycosidase H (10 milliunits) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), andN-acetylneuraminidase III (25 milliunits) (Glyco, Novata, CA) were used to investigate the presence of N-linked carbohydrates, high mannose sugars, and sialic acids, respectively. Samples were incubated for 18 h at 37 °C. The presence ofO-glycosylation was examined by treatment withN-glycanase F (5 units) with the addition of 15 milliunits of N-acetylneuraminidase III after 18 h, and then 2 milliunits of O-glycosidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added after 3 h, and the incubation was continued for another 12 h at 37 °C. All samples were subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE.1 Recombinant laminin α5 LG4–5 tandem module (5 μg) in 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, was digested with 200 milliunits of N-glycanase F (Oxford Glycosciences, Inc.) or with 10 milliunits of N-acetylneuraminidase III for 18 h at 37 °C. Samples (1 μg) of digested and undigested tandem module incubated in parallel were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The affinities for the deglycosylated and control tandem module for heparin were determined using surface plasmon resonance, as described below. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate wells were coated with 100 μl of heparin-BSA (10 mg/ml) (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. Wells were blocked at room temperature (2 h) with 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl (Tris-buffered saline), 1% BSA and then washed and incubated with recombinant proteins serially diluted in the same buffer overnight at 4 °C. After washing (Tris-buffered saline including 0.05% Tween), bound FLAG-tagged recombinant proteins were detected with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibodies. After a further wash, bound antibody was detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Pierce) and PNPP phosphatase substrate kit (Pierce). For competition experiments, biotinylated heparin (0.16 μm) (Celsus Laboratories, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) was mixed with synthetic peptides serially diluted in Tris-buffered saline, including 0.05% Tween and 1% BSA, and incubated in wells coated with recombinant laminin α5 tandem module (60 ng/50 μl, 19 nm). After 2 h at room temperature, wells were washed, and bound biotinylated heparin was detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (Pierce). Biotinylated heparin (Celsus Laboratories, Inc.) at 40 μg/ml in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% surfactant P20 was immobilized on a streptavidin-coated sensor chip (Sensor Chip SA, BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) at 10 μl/min for 4 min to an immobilization level of 300 resonance units. In the affinity measurements, recombinant proteins, at different concentrations, were injected on the heparin-coated surface at 30 μl/min (in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% surfactant P20, 25 °C), and the binding and dissociation were registered (2 min each) in a BIAcoreTM 1000 instrument (BIAcore, Inc.). The streptavidin-heparin surface was regenerated by two successive injections of 30 μl of 20 mm NaOH containing 1 m NaCl between each run. In control experiments with the same concentrations of recombinant proteins, but with a blank streptavidin sensor chip, no binding was seen. The obtained sensorgrams were analyzed by nonlinear least square curve fitting using BIAevaluation 2.1 software assuming single-site association and dissociation models. The human submandibular gland (HSG) cell line was cultured as described previously (13.Hoffman M.P. Nomizu M. Roque E. Lee S. Jung D.W. Yamada Y. Kleinman H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28633-28641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Cells were detached with 0.02% EDTA, washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% BSA, and resuspended to a concentration of 3.5 × 105/ml. Assays were performed in 96-well round-bottomed microtiter plates (Immulon-2HB, Dynex Technologies, Inc., Chantilly, VA). Wells were coated overnight at 4 °C with recombinant proteins or human laminin-10/11 (Life Technologies, Inc., catalog no. 12163-010) that was diluted with phosphate-buffered saline and then blocked with 3% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C. After wash (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.1% BSA), cells were added and incubated for 45–60 min at 37 °C. Attached cells were stained for 10 min with 0.2% (w/v) crystal violet (Sigma) in 20% (v/v) methanol. After a wash with H2O, cells were dissolved in 10% SDS (w/v), and the absorbance at 600 nm was measured. For experiments determining the effects on cell binding of synthetic peptides, EDTA, or an inhibitory monoclonal antibody against the human β1integrin subunit (monoclonal antibody 13, a generous gift from Dr. K. Yamada, National Institutes of Health), cells were incubated with inhibitors at room temperature for 10 min before being added to the wells. For experiments examining the effects of heparin and heparin-like glycosaminoglycans, substrate-coated and preblocked wells were incubated with inhibitors for 30 min at 37 °C and washed before cells were added. Constructs were generated for expression of mouse laminin α5 LG modules in 293 cells with a FLAG-tag and a portion of the C-terminal of the laminin γ1 chain at the N- and C-terminal ends, respectively (Fig.1 A). The recombinant proteins were purified by anti-FLAG affinity chromatography. From 1 liter of serum-free culture medium, 0.4–2.5 mg of pure recombinant proteins were recovered. The preparations of the recombinant proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 B). The apparent molecular masses for the tandem module and the LG5 module were slightly higher than the predicted sizes from the DNA coding sequence, suggesting the presence of posttranslational modifications. The sequence of the tandem module has two consensus motifs for N-linked carbohydrate (Asn-Xaa-(Ser/Thr)) located in the LG5 region. To address the possible presence of N-linked carbohydrate, the tandem module was treated with N-glycanase F and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.1 C). The apparent molecular mass afterN-glycanase F treatment was decreased by approximately 10 kDa (Fig. 1 C, lane 3), which was very close to the predicted mass from the DNA sequence. The tandem module was insensitive to treatment with endoglycosidase H (data not show), suggesting that theN-linked carbohydrate is of the complex type. After treatment with N-acetylneuraminidase III, which removes sialic acid, the molecular mass of the tandem module was decreased 1–2 kDa (Fig. 1 C, lane 2). The possible presence ofO-linked carbohydrate was examined byO-glycosidase following treatments withN-glycanase F and N-acetylneuraminidase III. However, there was no difference in apparent molecular masses between tandem module treated by N-glycanase F alone and tandem module treated with N-glycanase F,N-acetylneuraminidase III, and O-glycosidase (data not shown). These results suggest that the tandem module is modified only by N-linked carbohydrate. The proteolytic fragment E3 of the laminin α1 chain, which corresponds to the laminin α1 LG4–5 tandem module, has previously been shown to promote binding of HSG cells (13.Hoffman M.P. Nomizu M. Roque E. Lee S. Jung D.W. Yamada Y. Kleinman H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28633-28641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). These cells were used to analyze the adhesive properties of the recombinant laminin α5 LG modules and laminin containing the α5 chain (laminin-10/11). HSG cells showed similar binding to the LG4 module and the tandem module (Fig. 2). Weak cell binding was observed to the LG5 module. A recombinant control protein containing a FLAG-tagged portion of the C-terminal of the laminin γ1 chain had no cell binding activity, showing that the cell binding activities reside in the laminin α5-specific LG modules. Furthermore, removal of the FLAG and γ1 sequences by enterokinase and factor Xa, respectively, did not affect cell binding activity of the LG4–5 tandem module (data not shown). Similar binding activities for the recombinant laminin α5 modules were observed for other cell lines, including mouse neural crest cells and mouse B16-F10 melanoma cells (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the laminin α5 tandem module is active for cell binding and that the LG4 module contains the major site for cell binding activity. Cell binding to the recombinant laminin α5 LG4–5 protein and to laminins containing either the α5 chain (laminin-10/11) or the α1 chain (laminin-1) was examined in the presence of EDTA and a blocking monoclonal antibody against the β1 integrin subunit. The antibody against the β1 integrin subunit and 10 mm EDTA showed only partial inhibition of HSG binding to laminin-10/11 (Fig.3 A) but complete inhibition of cell binding to laminin-1 (data not shown and Ref. 13.Hoffman M.P. Nomizu M. Roque E. Lee S. Jung D.W. Yamada Y. Kleinman H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28633-28641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). These results suggest that different cellular receptors mediated binding to laminin-1 and laminin-10/11. The antibody against the β1 integrin subunit showed no effect on binding to the tandem module (Fig.3 B). Furthermore, EDTA showed no inhibition, suggesting that HSG cell binding to the laminin α5 tandem module is not mediated by β1 integrins (Fig. 3 B). Because heparin binding activity has been localized to the tandem modules of the laminin α1 and α2 chains (11.Talts J.F. Andac Z. Gohring W. Brancaccio A. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), cell binding to the recombinant laminin α5 LG4–5 tandem module was also examined in the presence of heparin and some other heparin-like glycosaminoglycans. Heparin and heparan sulfate showed no inhibition of HSG cell binding to laminin-10/11 (Fig.4 A) and laminin-1 (data not shown), consistent with previously reported results (13.Hoffman M.P. Nomizu M. Roque E. Lee S. Jung D.W. Yamada Y. Kleinman H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28633-28641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Heparin and heparan sulfate were found to partly inhibit cell binding to the tandem module, whereas keratan sulfate was noninhibitory (Fig. 4 B). These results suggest that HSG cell binding to the LG4–5 tandem module of the laminin α5 chain is mediated by heparan sulfate proteoglycans. The interactions with heparin were analyzed in a solid-phase assay using immobilized heparin-albumin and various concentrations of the recombinant laminin α5 LG modules. The highest binding activity was observed for the LG4 module (half-maximum at 10 nm) and the tandem module (half-maximum at 3 nm), whereas much lower binding activity was observed for the LG5 module (half-maximum not observed at concentrations up to 300 nm) (Fig.5). No binding was observed for the fusion protein. Thus, the heparin binding activity correlated with the observed cell binding activity of the modules described above. The binding kinetics between immobilized biotinylated heparin and the laminin α5 tandem module and individual modules were measured directly by real-time biomolecular interaction analysis using surface plasmon resonance on a BIAcoreTM system. Similar equilibrium dissociation constants (K D = 1.7–2 nm) were obtained for the interactions of the LG4 module and the tandem module with heparin (TableI). Binding of the tandem module to the immobilized biotinylated heparin was inhibited with an excess of unlabeled heparin (not shown). The binding affinity of the LG5 module to heparin was 16-fold weaker (K D = 46.2 nm). These results are consistent with the binding profiles determined by the heparin solid-phase assay and demonstrate that the major heparin binding site within the tandem module is located in the LG4 module.Table IKinetic and affinity constants for interactions between recombinant laminin α5 LG modules and immobilized heparinModulek diss × 103k ass × 10−3K Dμms −1m −1 · S −1nmLG4–5 (0.1–0.2)0.54 ± 0.2192 ± 632.8 ± 1.4aExperimental variation is shown as standard deviation.LG4–5/NAN (0.1–0.2)0.58 ± 0.1172 ± 243.4 ± 0.9LG4–5/GlyF (0.1–0.2)0.17 ± 0.170 ± 142.4 ± 1.3LG4 (0.1–0.3)0.26 ± 0.1149 ± 551.7 ± 0.3LG5 (0.4–1)0.32 ± 0.17 ± 0.146.2 ± 14.6Data were obtained by surface plasmon resonance analysis.

The apparent dissociation constants (K D) for the preparations were calculated from the ratio of the corresponding rate constants,k diss/k ass. NAN and GlyF represent treatment with neuraminidase-III and N-glycanase F, respectively. The extent of deglycosylation of the molecules was assessed by SDS-PAGE.a Experimental variation is shown as standard deviation.

NAN and GlyF represent treatment with neuraminidase-III and N-glycanase F, respectively. The extent of deglycosylation of the molecules was assessed by SDS-PAGE. To determine whether glycosylation is required for heparin and cell binding, recombinant laminin α5 LG4–5 tandem module was treated with neuraminidase and N-glycanase and tested for its heparin- and cell binding activity. The binding kinetics between immobilized biotinylated heparin and the deglycosylated tandem module were measured directly by surface plasmon resonance (Table I). The association and dissociation rate constants measured for the interaction between the tandem module and heparin corresponded to a dissociation constant of approximately 2.8 nm. Enzymatic removal of the sialic acids and the entire N-linked carbohydrate on the tandem module by neuraminidase andN-glycanase treatment, respectively, did not change the binding kinetics significantly (K D = 3.4–2.4 nm). Furthermore, the removal of N-linked carbohydrate showed no effect on the cell binding properties (data not shown). These data suggest that N-linked glycosylation is not critical for receptor interactions involved in cell binding to the LG4–5 tandem module. Protein interactions with heparin-like ligands are based on contacts between positively charged residues and negatively charged groups of heparin. In a number of protein domains (e.g.fibronectin repeats), the structure of the heparin-binding surfaces has been shown to consist of several Arg and Lys residues (17.Sharma A. Askari J.A. Humphries M.J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1468-1479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three possible heparin-binding sequences that contain clusters of Arg and Lys residues are located within the LG4 module sequence. We prepared a panel of LG4 module peptides derived from these sequences (TableII). Initially, we screened these peptides for direct heparin and cell binding activity using solid-phase assays. The peptide F4 (AGQWHRVSVRWG) was active both for HSG cell and heparin binding, whereas the peptide F1 showed weak cell binding activity but no heparin binding activity (data not shown). Next, we tested all the peptides to determine whether they affected the binding of biotinylated heparin to immobilized tandem module. Only peptide F4 was found to inhibit binding of heparin to the tandem module (Fig.6), whereas none of the other peptides had any effect on the tandem module-heparin interaction, even when the peptides were almost 1000-fold molar excess over heparin (152 mm peptide, 0.16 mm biotin-heparin conjugate). Half-maximum inhibition was seen at 10–20 mm for the inhibitory peptide. The ability of the synthetic peptides to inhibit the binding of the tandem module to heparin was also studied using surface plasmon resonance. Only peptide F4 prevented the binding of the tandem module to immobilized heparin on the sensor chip, which supports the solid-phase data (data not shown).Table IISynthetic peptides from the sequence of the LG4 module of the mouse laminin α5 chainNotationSequenceResiduesF1RNRLHLSMLVRP3275–3286F2GPGPRLQVQSRQ3322–3333F3VQSRQHSRAGQW3329–3340F4AGQWHRVSVRWG3337–3348F5TWSQKALHHRVP3361–3372F6HRVPRAERPQPY3369–3380F7LKKLQLDKQPLRT3406–3418Underlined sequence is active for heparin and cell binding.

Inhibition of cell binding to the laminin α5 LG4–5 tandem module and laminin-10/11 by the cell-binding peptides was also examined. Peptide F4 inhibited HSG cell binding to the tandem module, whereas peptide F1 exhibited no significant inhibition (Fig.7). None of the peptides inhibited cell binding to laminin-10/11, indicating that other cell binding sites are available on the intact molecule (data not shown). Together, these results suggest that the AGQWHRVSVRWG sequence is a major site for heparin and cell binding within the laminin α5 LG4–5 tandem module.

https://openalex.org/W2080843858,"Cytokinesis and septation in the fission yeastSchizosaccharomyces pombe are studied as a model for mammalian cell division. In fission yeast, septation is positively regulated by Spg1, a Ras family GTPase that localizes to spindle-pole bodies (SPBs) throughout the cell cycle. As cells enter mitosis, Spg1 accumulates in an active, GTP-bound form and binds the Cdc7 protein kinase to cause Cdc7 translocation to SPBs. Cdc7 disappears from one SPB in mid-anaphase and from the second SPB in late mitosis. Byr4 plus Cdc16 negatively regulate septation by forming a two-component GTPase-activating protein for Spg1. These results led us to hypothesize that Byr4 localization to SPBs regulated the nucleotide state of Spg1, due to its ability to form Spg1GAP activity with Cdc16 and thus the binding of Cdc7 to Spg1 at SPBs. To test this hypothesis, Byr4 localization was determined using indirect immunofluorescence. This analysis revealed that Byr4 was localized to SPBs that did not contain Cdc7. In byr4 − mutants, Cdc7 localized to interphase SPBs and only symmetrically localized to mitotic SPBs. In contrast, Byr4 overexpression prevented Spg1 and Cdc7 localization to SPBs. These results suggest that Byr4 localization to SPBs maintains Spg1 in an inactive form, presumably by stimulating Spg1 GTPase activity with Cdc16, and that loss of Byr4 from mitotic SPBs increases the active fraction of Spg1 and thereby increases Spg1-Cdc7 binding. Byr4 localization to SPBs was decreased in spg1,cdc16, sid4, and cdc11 mutants as well as in several mutants that affect medial F-actin structures, suggesting that multiple pathways regulate Byr4 localization to SPBs.

Like many eukaryotes, the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombedivides by constricting an actomyosin ring that is perpendicular to the mitotic spindle (reviewed in Ref. 1.Gould K. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2939-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In fission yeast, a medial ring composed of F-actin and other proteins forms at the future site of cell division as cells enter mitosis. Following anaphase, this actomyosin ring constricts, a primary septum is deposited, secondary septa form on both sides of the primary septum, and the primary septum is degraded to yield two cells. Since mammals also divide by constriction of a medial actomyosin ring, fission yeast is a good model for mammalian cell division.Several fission yeast mutants perturb the temporal control of actomyosin ring constriction and septation without affecting the location or structure of the actomyosin ring (1.Gould K. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2939-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 2.Balasubramanian M. McCollum D. Chang L. Wong K. Naqvi N. He X. Sazer S. Gould K. Genetics. 1998; 149: 1265-1275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of these mutants,spg1, cdc7, byr4, and cdc16are most important for this study. spg1 − andcdc7 − mutants form a medial ring, but do not constrict this ring or deposit a septum, leading to elongated, multinucleate cells (2.Balasubramanian M. McCollum D. Chang L. Wong K. Naqvi N. He X. Sazer S. Gould K. Genetics. 1998; 149: 1265-1275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Fankhauser C. Simanis V.

These mutant phenotypes suggest that Spg1 and Cdc7 are positive regulators of septation, while Byr4 and Cdc16 are negative regulators. Consistent with this notion, Spg1 or Cdc7 overexpression causes cell cycle arrest with multiple septa, while Byr4 overexpression causes multinucleate cells (3.Fankhauser C. Simanis V.

Overexpression of Spg1 mutants that probably increase GTP-bound Spg1 cause higher levels of septation than wild-type Spg1, while overexpression of Spg1 mutants that probably decrease GTP-bound Spg1 do not induce septation (4.Schmidt S. Sohrmann M. Hofmann K. Woollard A. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1519-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Hence, Spg1-GTP is the active form like most Ras family GTPases (7.Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1824) Google Scholar). GTP-bound Spg1 binds the Cdc7 protein kinase (8.Sohrmann M. Schmidt S. Hagan I. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Spg1-Cdc7 binding is important for septation, because an Spg1 effector mutant, which perturbs a region of Spg1 used by many Ras family GTPases to interact with their targets, interacts poorly with Cdc7 and does not cause septation when overexpressed (4.Schmidt S. Sohrmann M. Hofmann K. Woollard A. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1519-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Byr4 and Cdc16 form a two-component GTPase-activating protein (GAP)1 for the Spg1 GTPase that explains their roles as negative regulators of septation (9.Furge K. Wong K. Armstrong J. Balasubramanian M. Albright C.F. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 947-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in Spg1GAP activity, Byr4 binds Cdc16 and Spg1 in a nucleotide-independent manner. Cdc16 does not bind or affect the nucleotide bound to Spg1 in the absence of Byr4.Spg1 is constitutively localized to spindle-pole bodies (SPBs) (8.Sohrmann M. Schmidt S. Hagan I. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). As cells enter mitosis, Cdc7 translocates to both SPBs in an Spg1-dependent manner. Surprisingly, Cdc7 disappears from one SPB in mid-anaphase and from the second SPB in late mitosis as cells septate. While the reason for asymmetric SPB localization of Cdc7 is unknown, SPB asymmetry appears important for regulation of septation because Cdc7 remains at both SPBs in cdc16 −mutants that undergo repeated rounds of septation. Asymmetric localization of Cdc7 to mitotic SPBs probably depends upon Spg1 regulators, because Spg1 is asymmetrically activated at mitotic SPBs incdc7 − mutants (8.Sohrmann M. Schmidt S. Hagan I. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar).Based on these results, we hypothesized that Byr4 localization to SPBs regulated the nucleotide state of Spg1, due to its ability to form Spg1GAP activity with Cdc16, and thus the binding of Cdc7 to Spg1 at SPBs. We find that Byr4 is localized to SPBs that do not contain Cdc7. While this manuscript was in preparation, another study found similar, but not identical, regulation of Byr4 localization during the cell cycle (10.Cerutti L. Simanis V. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2313-2321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This localization pattern, which depends upon the proper function of several genes that affect septation, probably explains the cell cycle regulation of Cdc7 localization, an event important for normal septation.DISCUSSIONThis study showed that Byr4 localized to SPBs in a cell cycle-regulated manner to control Cdc7 localization to SPBs. A model summarizing known or hypothesized events is shown (Fig.5). Byr4 localization to SPBs probably decreases Spg1-GTP, presumably due to the Spg1GAP activity of Byr4 plus Cdc16, and Spg1-Cdc7 binding is thereby decreased. In contrast, Spg1-GTP probably increases when Byr4 disappears from mitotic SPBs, presumably due to decreased Spg1GAP activity, and Spg1-Cdc7 binding is thereby increased. These results are consistent with previous studies of Cdc7 localization to SPBs during the cell cycle, which suggested that the Cdc7 localization pattern resulted from changes in the nucleotide state of Spg1 (8.Sohrmann M. Schmidt S. Hagan I. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Our results are also largely consistent with a study of Byr4 localization that was published recently (10.Cerutti L. Simanis V. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2313-2321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both this study and our work agree that Byr4 is asymmetrically localized to SPBs in late mitosis. We disagree, however, on the amount of Byr4 that is localized to SPBs in early mitosis. Cerutti and Simanis (10.Cerutti L. Simanis V. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2313-2321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found Byr4 on SPBs in early mitosis although this amount was consistently less than that found on SPBs in late mitosis. In contrast, we did not detect Byr4 on SPBs in early mitosis. This difference could result from differences in the assay, strain, or growth conditions. Despite these quantitative differences, though, both studies find a strong inverse correlation between the amount of Byr4 and Cdc7 at SPBs.The need for Spg1 and Cdc16 to localize Byr4 to SPBs was not surprising, since Byr4 binds Spg1 and Cdc16. If Cdc16 were localized to SPBs in a Byr4-independent manner, then the formation of a ternary complex between Byr4, Cdc16, and Spg1 at SPBs could explain Byr4 localization to SPBs (Fig. 5). Isolation of such a ternary complexin vitro is consistent with this model. Other models could also explain the need for Cdc16 in Byr4 localization to SPBs. For instance, Cdc16 binding to Byr4 could induce a conformational change that allows Byr4 or Cdc16 to bind another SPB protein. Such a conformational change could result from Spg1 GTP hydrolysis induced by Byr4 plus Cdc16. While our data do not exclude these or some other models, we favor the model that Byr4, Cdc16, and Spg1 form a ternary complex at the SPB that is essential for Byr4 localization to SPBs. In this model, Spg1 serves both as a substrate for Byr4-Cdc16 GAP activity and as part of the SPB anchor for Byr4. Stable binding of the Byr4-Cdc16 GAP to Spg1 contrasts with the binding of most other GAPs to Ras family GTPases. Usually, a GAP-GTPase complex can only be isolated if a transition state analog of the GTPase reaction is formed using aluminum fluoride and GDP (22.Mittal R. Ahmadian M. Goody R. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1996; 273: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 23.Ahmadian M. Mittal R. Hall A. Wittinghofer A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Perhaps, the need to form a ternary complex between Byr4, Cdc16, and Spg1 explains why Spg1GAP activity is divided between two proteins. The binding of GAPCenA to Rab6 is another exception to the usual GTPase-GAP binding (24.Cuif M. Possmayer F. Zander H. Bordes N. Jollivet F. Couedel-Courteille A. Janoueix-Lerosey I. Langsley G. Bornens M. Goud B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1772-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Like Byr4, GAPCenA has a binding site for Rab6 that is outside the region required for GAP activity, and GAPCenA is localized to centrosomes, the mammalian equivalent of SPBs. It will be interesting to test whether there are additional similarities between GAPCenA and Byr4-Cdc16.The analysis of Byr4 localization to SPBs in other mutants that perturb septation led to several interesting findings. First,cdc11–123 mutants had decreased levels of Byr4 at a single SPB per cell, and sid4-A1 mutants failed to localize Byr4 to SPBs, suggesting that Cdc11 and Sid4 function near Byr4 in the signaling pathway. For instance, the sid4-A1 results are consistent with Sid4 serving to anchor Cdc16 to SPBs and thecdc11–123 results are consistent with Cdc11 playing an important role in Byr4 binding to SPBs in mid-anaphase. Clearly, other functions are possible, and biochemical experiments will be needed to determine the exact roles for Sid4 and Cdc11 in regulating septation. Second, Byr4 was usually localized to one SPB per cell in strains with mutations in sid1, sid2, cdc7, andcdc14, suggesting that Sid1, Sid2, Cdc7, and Cdc14 are not required to localize Byr4, Spg1, Cdc16, Sid4, or Cdc11 to SPBs. These results do not, however, prove these hypotheses for reasons previously discussed; in particular, these mutant proteins may function normally with respect to the control of negative regulators of septation while being defective with respect to control of positive regulators of septation. Byr4 localization to a single SPB per cell in these mutants shows that Byr4 localization to SPBs can be uncoupled from the cell cycle, at least in these mutants. This finding also suggests that cells establish SPB asymmetry in mitosis by modifying one SPB to cause Byr4 localization to this SPB instead of preventing Byr4 localization to other SPBs. Finally, mutants that perturbed the medial F-actin ring, including cdc3–124, cdc4–8,cdc8–110, and cdc15–136, resulted in a dramatic decrease in Byr4 localization to SPBs. Since Byr4 does not colocalize with or bind to these proteins that affect F-actin structures, these results suggest that the Spg1 pathway is regulated at least partially by medial F-actin structures. For instance, cells with reduced medial F-actin structures may cause Spg1 to remain activated by preventing Byr4 localization to SPBs. Since activated Spg1 can induce medial F-actin structures (4.Schmidt S. Sohrmann M. Hofmann K. Woollard A. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1519-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), hyperactivated Spg1 would give the cell the greatest likelihood of forming the proper medial F-actin structures that are required for septation.Regulation of Byr4 or proteins required for Byr4 localization to SPBs could control the cell cycle-dependent localization of Byr4 (Fig. 5). Regulation of these binding interactions by phosphorylation is an appealing possibility, since Byr4 is a phosphoprotein. 2K. A. Furge and C. F. Albright, unpublished observation. Furthermore, the Plo1 kinase is an attractive candidate for a kinase that causes Byr4 to disappear from SPBs in early mitosis, since Plo1 translocates to SPBs as cells enter mitosis (25.Bahler J. Steever A. Wheatley S. Wang Y. Pringle J. Gould K. McCollum D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1603-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), Plo1 is essential for septation, and Plo1 overexpression induces septa (26.Ohkura H. Hagan I. Glover D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1059-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Based on our studies of Byr4 localization, Plo1 could phosphorylate and regulate Byr4, Spg1, Cdc16, Cdc11, or Sid4 to regulate Byr4 localization to SPBs. As mitosis progresses, decreased Plo1 localization to SPBs could allow Byr4 or Byr4-binding proteins to return to SPBs in mid-anaphase or late mitosis. Even this model, though, requires another regulated event to fully explain the cell cycle regulation of Byr4 localization to SPBs. Asymmetric SPB activation of Plo1 or localization of Cdc16 are candidates for such regulated events. We were, unfortunately, unable to test these models with existing plo1 temperature-sensitive mutants (25.Bahler J. Steever A. Wheatley S. Wang Y. Pringle J. Gould K. McCollum D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1603-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), since the karyokinesis defects of these mutants overwhelmed their effects on septation (data not shown).Cdc7 localization to interphase and both mitotic SPBs increased dramatically as Byr4 was depleted, but subsequently decreased as cells underwent multiple rounds of septation. This decrease in Cdc7 localization to SPBs raises two points. First, regulatory mechanisms other than Byr4 localization, such as decreased exchange factor activity or Spg1-Cdc7 binding affinity, may also control Spg1-Cdc7 binding. Feedback regulation of these activities could explain the decrease in Cdc7 localization to SPBs. Second, Cdc7 need not remain at SPBs for septation to continue once septation is initiated. These data suggest that Cdc7 localization to SPBs is required to initiate, but not to maintain, septation and that Byr4 localization to SPBs in late mitosis may be needed to cause Cdc7 disappearance from SPBs and to inhibit additional rounds of septation.The analysis of Byr4 overexpressing cells suggests that Byr4 overexpression can negatively regulate septation by two mechanisms. At low levels of Byr4 overexpression, the amount of Cdc7 at SPBs decreased dramatically. Since Spg1 was localized to SPBs in these cells, Byr4 probably negatively regulated septation due to its Spg1GAP activity with Cdc16. This mechanism is probably the predominant means by which Byr4 regulates septation in actively growing cells. At high levels of Byr4 overexpression, most cells contained neither Cdc7 nor Spg1 at SPBs. In these cells, Byr4 was dispersed throughout the cytoplasm in both diffuse and punctate structures. These results suggest that high levels of Byr4 negatively regulate septation by sequestering Spg1 in cytosolic complexes. In contrast to the role of Byr4 in Spg1GAP activity, the physiologic significance of Spg1 loss from SPBs is unclear. This mislocalization might be an artifact of Byr4 overexpression or a mechanism by which Byr4 negatively regulates septation is some circumstances. Proper cell division is essential for genome integrity. Like many eukaryotes, the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombedivides by constricting an actomyosin ring that is perpendicular to the mitotic spindle (reviewed in Ref. 1.Gould K. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2939-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In fission yeast, a medial ring composed of F-actin and other proteins forms at the future site of cell division as cells enter mitosis. Following anaphase, this actomyosin ring constricts, a primary septum is deposited, secondary septa form on both sides of the primary septum, and the primary septum is degraded to yield two cells. Since mammals also divide by constriction of a medial actomyosin ring, fission yeast is a good model for mammalian cell division. Several fission yeast mutants perturb the temporal control of actomyosin ring constriction and septation without affecting the location or structure of the actomyosin ring (1.Gould K. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2939-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 2.Balasubramanian M. McCollum D. Chang L. Wong K. Naqvi N. He X. Sazer S. Gould K. Genetics. 1998; 149: 1265-1275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of these mutants,spg1, cdc7, byr4, and cdc16are most important for this study. spg1 − andcdc7 − mutants form a medial ring, but do not constrict this ring or deposit a septum, leading to elongated, multinucleate cells (2.Balasubramanian M. McCollum D. Chang L. Wong K. Naqvi N. He X. Sazer S. Gould K. Genetics. 1998; 149: 1265-1275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Fankhauser C. Simanis V. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3011-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 4.Schmidt S. Sohrmann M. Hofmann K. Woollard A. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1519-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In contrast, cdc16 −and byr4 − mutants undergo repeated rounds of septation (5.Minet M. Nurse P. Thuriaux P. Mitchison J. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 137: 440-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Song K. Mach K.E. Chen C.Y. Reynolds T. Albright C.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These mutant phenotypes suggest that Spg1 and Cdc7 are positive regulators of septation, while Byr4 and Cdc16 are negative regulators. Consistent with this notion, Spg1 or Cdc7 overexpression causes cell cycle arrest with multiple septa, while Byr4 overexpression causes multinucleate cells (3.Fankhauser C. Simanis V. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3011-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 4.Schmidt S. Sohrmann M. Hofmann K. Woollard A. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1519-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 6.Song K. Mach K.E. Chen C.Y. Reynolds T. Albright C.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Spg1, Cdc7, Byr4, and Cdc16 interact to regulate actomyosin ring constriction and septation. Spg1 is a GTPase of the Ras superfamily (4.Schmidt S. Sohrmann M. Hofmann K. Woollard A. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1519-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Spg1 mutants that probably increase GTP-bound Spg1 cause higher levels of septation than wild-type Spg1, while overexpression of Spg1 mutants that probably decrease GTP-bound Spg1 do not induce septation (4.Schmidt S. Sohrmann M. Hofmann K. Woollard A. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1519-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Hence, Spg1-GTP is the active form like most Ras family GTPases (7.Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1824) Google Scholar). GTP-bound Spg1 binds the Cdc7 protein kinase (8.Sohrmann M. Schmidt S. Hagan I. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Spg1-Cdc7 binding is important for septation, because an Spg1 effector mutant, which perturbs a region of Spg1 used by many Ras family GTPases to interact with their targets, interacts poorly with Cdc7 and does not cause septation when overexpressed (4.Schmidt S. Sohrmann M. Hofmann K. Woollard A. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1519-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Byr4 and Cdc16 form a two-component GTPase-activating protein (GAP)1 for the Spg1 GTPase that explains their roles as negative regulators of septation (9.Furge K. Wong K. Armstrong J. Balasubramanian M. Albright C.F. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 947-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in Spg1GAP activity, Byr4 binds Cdc16 and Spg1 in a nucleotide-independent manner. Cdc16 does not bind or affect the nucleotide bound to Spg1 in the absence of Byr4. Spg1 is constitutively localized to spindle-pole bodies (SPBs) (8.Sohrmann M. Schmidt S. Hagan I. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). As cells enter mitosis, Cdc7 translocates to both SPBs in an Spg1-dependent manner. Surprisingly, Cdc7 disappears from one SPB in mid-anaphase and from the second SPB in late mitosis as cells septate. While the reason for asymmetric SPB localization of Cdc7 is unknown, SPB asymmetry appears important for regulation of septation because Cdc7 remains at both SPBs in cdc16 −mutants that undergo repeated rounds of septation. Asymmetric localization of Cdc7 to mitotic SPBs probably depends upon Spg1 regulators, because Spg1 is asymmetrically activated at mitotic SPBs incdc7 − mutants (8.Sohrmann M. Schmidt S. Hagan I. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Based on these results, we hypothesized that Byr4 localization to SPBs regulated the nucleotide state of Spg1, due to its ability to form Spg1GAP activity with Cdc16, and thus the binding of Cdc7 to Spg1 at SPBs. We find that Byr4 is localized to SPBs that do not contain Cdc7. While this manuscript was in preparation, another study found similar, but not identical, regulation of Byr4 localization during the cell cycle (10.Cerutti L. Simanis V. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2313-2321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This localization pattern, which depends upon the proper function of several genes that affect septation, probably explains the cell cycle regulation of Cdc7 localization, an event important for normal septation. DISCUSSIONThis study showed that Byr4 localized to SPBs in a cell cycle-regulated manner to control Cdc7 localization to SPBs. A model summarizing known or hypothesized events is shown (Fig.5). Byr4 localization to SPBs probably decreases Spg1-GTP, presumably due to the Spg1GAP activity of Byr4 plus Cdc16, and Spg1-Cdc7 binding is thereby decreased.

These results are consistent with previous studies of Cdc7 localization to SPBs during the cell cycle, which suggested that the Cdc7 localization pattern resulted from changes in the nucleotide state of Spg1 (8.Sohrmann M.

Cerutti and Simanis (10.Cerutti L. Simanis V. J.

Perhaps, the need to form a ternary complex between Byr4, Cdc16, and Spg1 explains why Spg1GAP activity is divided between two proteins. The binding of GAPCenA to Rab6 is another exception to the usual GTPase-GAP binding (24.Cuif M. Possmayer F. Zander H. Bordes N. Jollivet F. Couedel-Courteille A. Janoueix-Lerosey I. Langsley G.

It will be interesting to test whether there are additional similarities between GAPCenA and Byr4-Cdc16.The analysis of Byr4 localization to SPBs in other mutants that perturb septation led to several interesting findings.

Based on our studies of Byr4 localization, Plo1 could phosphorylate and regulate Byr4, Spg1, Cdc16, Cdc11, or Sid4 to regulate Byr4 localization to SPBs. As mitosis progresses, decreased Plo1 localization to SPBs could allow Byr4 or Byr4-binding proteins to return to SPBs in mid-anaphase or late mitosis. Even this model, though, requires another regulated event to fully explain the cell cycle regulation of Byr4 localization to SPBs.

These results suggest that high levels of Byr4 negatively regulate septation by sequestering Spg1 in cytosolic complexes. In contrast to the role of Byr4 in Spg1GAP activity, the physiologic significance of Spg1 loss from SPBs is unclear. This mislocalization might be an artifact of Byr4 overexpression or a mechanism by which Byr4 negatively regulates septation is some circumstances. This study showed that Byr4 localized to SPBs in a cell cycle-regulated manner to control Cdc7 localization to SPBs. A model summarizing known or hypothesized events is shown (Fig.5). Byr4 localization to SPBs probably decreases Spg1-GTP, presumably due to the Spg1GAP activity of Byr4 plus Cdc16, and Spg1-Cdc7 binding is thereby decreased. In contrast, Spg1-GTP probably increases when Byr4 disappears from mitotic SPBs, presumably due to decreased Spg1GAP activity, and Spg1-Cdc7 binding is thereby increased. These results are consistent with previous studies of Cdc7 localization to SPBs during the cell cycle, which suggested that the Cdc7 localization pattern resulted from changes in the nucleotide state of Spg1 (8.Sohrmann M. Schmidt S. Hagan I. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Our results are also largely consistent with a study of Byr4 localization that was published recently (10.Cerutti L. Simanis V. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2313-2321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both this study and our work agree that Byr4 is asymmetrically localized to SPBs in late mitosis. We disagree, however, on the amount of Byr4 that is localized to SPBs in early mitosis. Cerutti and Simanis (10.Cerutti L. Simanis V. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2313-2321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found Byr4 on SPBs in early mitosis although this amount was consistently less than that found on SPBs in late mitosis. In contrast, we did not detect Byr4 on SPBs in early mitosis. This difference could result from differences in the assay, strain, or growth conditions. Despite these quantitative differences, though, both studies find a strong inverse correlation between the amount of Byr4 and Cdc7 at SPBs. The need for Spg1 and Cdc16 to localize Byr4 to SPBs was not surprising, since Byr4 binds Spg1 and Cdc16. If Cdc16 were localized to SPBs in a Byr4-independent manner, then the formation of a ternary complex between Byr4, Cdc16, and Spg1 at SPBs could explain Byr4 localization to SPBs (Fig. 5). Isolation of such a ternary complexin vitro is consistent with this model. Other models could also explain the need for Cdc16 in Byr4 localization to SPBs. For instance, Cdc16 binding to Byr4 could induce a conformational change that allows Byr4 or Cdc16 to bind another SPB protein. Such a conformational change could result from Spg1 GTP hydrolysis induced by Byr4 plus Cdc16. While our data do not exclude these or some other models, we favor the model that Byr4, Cdc16, and Spg1 form a ternary complex at the SPB that is essential for Byr4 localization to SPBs. In this model, Spg1 serves both as a substrate for Byr4-Cdc16 GAP activity and as part of the SPB anchor for Byr4. Stable binding of the Byr4-Cdc16 GAP to Spg1 contrasts with the binding of most other GAPs to Ras family GTPases. Usually, a GAP-GTPase complex can only be isolated if a transition state analog of the GTPase reaction is formed using aluminum fluoride and GDP (22.Mittal R. Ahmadian M. Goody R. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1996; 273: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 23.Ahmadian M. Mittal R. Hall A. Wittinghofer A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Perhaps, the need to form a ternary complex between Byr4, Cdc16, and Spg1 explains why Spg1GAP activity is divided between two proteins. The binding of GAPCenA to Rab6 is another exception to the usual GTPase-GAP binding (24.Cuif M. Possmayer F. Zander H. Bordes N. Jollivet F. Couedel-Courteille A. Janoueix-Lerosey I. Langsley G. Bornens M. Goud B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1772-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Like Byr4, GAPCenA has a binding site for Rab6 that is outside the region required for GAP activity, and GAPCenA is localized to centrosomes, the mammalian equivalent of SPBs. It will be interesting to test whether there are additional similarities between GAPCenA and Byr4-Cdc16. The analysis of Byr4 localization to SPBs in other mutants that perturb septation led to several interesting findings. First,cdc11–123 mutants had decreased levels of Byr4 at a single SPB per cell, and sid4-A1 mutants failed to localize Byr4 to SPBs, suggesting that Cdc11 and Sid4 function near Byr4 in the signaling pathway. For instance, the sid4-A1 results are consistent with Sid4 serving to anchor Cdc16 to SPBs and thecdc11–123 results are consistent with Cdc11 playing an important role in Byr4 binding to SPBs in mid-anaphase. Clearly, other functions are possible, and biochemical experiments will be needed to determine the exact roles for Sid4 and Cdc11 in regulating septation. Second, Byr4 was usually localized to one SPB per cell in strains with mutations in sid1, sid2, cdc7, andcdc14, suggesting that Sid1, Sid2, Cdc7, and Cdc14 are not required to localize Byr4, Spg1, Cdc16, Sid4, or Cdc11 to SPBs. These results do not, however, prove these hypotheses for reasons previously discussed; in particular, these mutant proteins may function normally with respect to the control of negative regulators of septation while being defective with respect to control of positive regulators of septation. Byr4 localization to a single SPB per cell in these mutants shows that Byr4 localization to SPBs can be uncoupled from the cell cycle, at least in these mutants. This finding also suggests that cells establish SPB asymmetry in mitosis by modifying one SPB to cause Byr4 localization to this SPB instead of preventing Byr4 localization to other SPBs. Finally, mutants that perturbed the medial F-actin ring, including cdc3–124, cdc4–8,cdc8–110, and cdc15–136, resulted in a dramatic decrease in Byr4 localization to SPBs. Since Byr4 does not colocalize with or bind to these proteins that affect F-actin structures, these results suggest that the Spg1 pathway is regulated at least partially by medial F-actin structures. For instance, cells with reduced medial F-actin structures may cause Spg1 to remain activated by preventing Byr4 localization to SPBs. Since activated Spg1 can induce medial F-actin structures (4.Schmidt S. Sohrmann M. Hofmann K. Woollard A. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1519-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), hyperactivated Spg1 would give the cell the greatest likelihood of forming the proper medial F-actin structures that are required for septation. Regulation of Byr4 or proteins required for Byr4 localization to SPBs could control the cell cycle-dependent localization of Byr4 (Fig. 5). Regulation of these binding interactions by phosphorylation is an appealing possibility, since Byr4 is a phosphoprotein. 2K. A. Furge and C. F. Albright, unpublished observation. Furthermore, the Plo1 kinase is an attractive candidate for a kinase that causes Byr4 to disappear from SPBs in early mitosis, since Plo1 translocates to SPBs as cells enter mitosis (25.Bahler J. Steever A. Wheatley S. Wang Y. Pringle J. Gould K. McCollum D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1603-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), Plo1 is essential for septation, and Plo1 overexpression induces septa (26.Ohkura H. Hagan I. Glover D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1059-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Based on our studies of Byr4 localization, Plo1 could phosphorylate and regulate Byr4, Spg1, Cdc16, Cdc11, or Sid4 to regulate Byr4 localization to SPBs. As mitosis progresses, decreased Plo1 localization to SPBs could allow Byr4 or Byr4-binding proteins to return to SPBs in mid-anaphase or late mitosis. Even this model, though, requires another regulated event to fully explain the cell cycle regulation of Byr4 localization to SPBs. Asymmetric SPB activation of Plo1 or localization of Cdc16 are candidates for such regulated events. We were, unfortunately, unable to test these models with existing plo1 temperature-sensitive mutants (25.Bahler J. Steever A. Wheatley S. Wang Y. Pringle J. Gould K. McCollum D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1603-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), since the karyokinesis defects of these mutants overwhelmed their effects on septation (data not shown). Cdc7 localization to interphase and both mitotic SPBs increased dramatically as Byr4 was depleted, but subsequently decreased as cells underwent multiple rounds of septation. This decrease in Cdc7 localization to SPBs raises two points. First, regulatory mechanisms other than Byr4 localization, such as decreased exchange factor activity or Spg1-Cdc7 binding affinity, may also control Spg1-Cdc7 binding. Feedback regulation of these activities could explain the decrease in Cdc7 localization to SPBs. Second, Cdc7 need not remain at SPBs for septation to continue once septation is initiated. These data suggest that Cdc7 localization to SPBs is required to initiate, but not to maintain, septation and that Byr4 localization to SPBs in late mitosis may be needed to cause Cdc7 disappearance from SPBs and to inhibit additional rounds of septation. The analysis of Byr4 overexpressing cells suggests that Byr4 overexpression can negatively regulate septation by two mechanisms. At low levels of Byr4 overexpression, the amount of Cdc7 at SPBs decreased dramatically. Since Spg1 was localized to SPBs in these cells, Byr4 probably negatively regulated septation due to its Spg1GAP activity with Cdc16. This mechanism is probably the predominant means by which Byr4 regulates septation in actively growing cells. At high levels of Byr4 overexpression, most cells contained neither Cdc7 nor Spg1 at SPBs. In these cells, Byr4 was dispersed throughout the cytoplasm in both diffuse and punctate structures. These results suggest that high levels of Byr4 negatively regulate septation by sequestering Spg1 in cytosolic complexes. In contrast to the role of Byr4 in Spg1GAP activity, the physiologic significance of Spg1 loss from SPBs is unclear. This mislocalization might be an artifact of Byr4 overexpression or a mechanism by which Byr4 negatively regulates septation is some circumstances. We thank K. Gould, M. Balasubramanian, and V.

They are required for cell growth and are reported to have various functions in stabilizing DNA or membrane structure, and in resistance to oxidative stress. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC)1catalyzes the conversion of ornithine to putrescine and is the first and rate-limiting step in polyamine biosynthesis in most organisms (4.Pegg A.E. Biochem.

Control of fungal disease in humans and plants has relied on compounds that specifically interdict fungal metabolic pathways, in particular, ergosterol biosynthesis. Resistance to such fungicides generally arises within a few years either as a result of mutation in the native population or because of the introduction of resistant strains from other areas. Many effective fungicides are being withdrawn from use due to public concern about their toxicity. The search for new classes of fungicide is becoming increasingly urgent due to the limited number of targets for fungicide action so far identified. Most fungi (including the economically important plant pathogens, Rhizoctonia solani, Botrytis cinerea, Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici, Verticillium dahliae, Cochliobolus carbonum, and Phytophthora infestans) are prevented from growing by low concentrations of DFMO (10.Walters D.R. Mycol. Res. 1995; 99: 129-139Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 12.West H.M. Walters D.R. Mycol. Res. 1989; 92: 453-457Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 13.Davis R.H. Brambl R. MarAuL S. The Mycota III, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Springer Verlag, Berlin1996: 347-356Google Scholar). The same concentration of DFMO does not inhibit plant growth, because plants can synthesize polyamines from arginine (14.Kumar A. Altabella T. Taylor M.A. Tiburicio A.Y. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 124-130Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (330) Google Scholar). For example, DFMO applied to R. solani-infected tomato plants markedly reduced disease severity without adversely affecting plant growth. Polyamine biosynthesis (and in particular ODCase) has therefore been proposed as a good candidate target for developing a new type of fungicidal chemical. Although DFMO is not toxic to plants per se, its toxicity to animals and high cost make it unsuitable for development as a fungicide. Moreover, certain important fungal plant pathogens, such asSeptoria tritici, Stagonospora nodorum,Pyrenophora avenae, and Ophiostoma ulmi, are reportedly insensitive to DFMO (10.Walters D.R. Mycol. Res. 1995; 99: 129-139Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 15.Smith T.A. Barker L.K.A. Owen W.J. Mycol. Res. 1992; 96: 395-400Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar), suggesting the presence of divergent ODCase enzymes or an alternative route to polyamine biosynthesis in these organisms. Beneficial soil fungi, such as mycorrhiza, are reportedly insensitive to DFMO due to the presence of the agmatine route to polyamine biosynthesis (10.Walters D.R. Mycol. Res. 1995; 99: 129-139Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar) but other ODCase inhibitors have not been tested. In theory, plants contain sufficient polyamines to support fungal growth. It is possible that, even after inhibition of ODC, pathogenic fungi may be able to obtain enough polyamines from the plant to support invasion of plant tissues. The ability to disrupt chromosomal gene loci in haploid fungi is well established and allows a direct test of gene function in growth and pathogenicity. ODC genes have been isolated and disrupted in yeast (16.Fonzi W.A. Sypherd P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10127-10133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Neurospora crassa (17.Williams L.J.

Ruiz-Herrera J. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 2237-2245Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Yeast and N. crassa are non-pathogens and disruption in U. maydis prevents formation of the diploid state, which is a pre-requisite for pathogenicity. A recent paper describes an ODC gene knockout in Leishmania(19.Jiang Y. Roberts C. Jardim A. Carter N.S. Shih S. Ariyanayagam M. Fairlamb A.H. Ullmann U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3781-3788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) but does not describe effects of the lesion on pathogenicity, hence it is not yet known whether ODC is required for virulence of any pathogen. We have now isolated ODC gene sequences from the ascomycete fungus, S. nodorum, which is one of the major causes of cereal crop loss throughout the world. To define the role of ODC in polyamine biosynthesis and pathogenicity in this pathogen, gene function was tested genetically by gene disruption. Disruptants demonstrated the essential function of ODC in polyamine metabolism, growth, and pathogenesis. This provides the first demonstration for the requirement for ODC in disease development. The following fungal isolates were used in this work: S. nodorum BS171, and Aspergillus nidulans G0171. Septoria nodorum was maintained at 25 °C on Czapek minimal agar with the addition of V8 juice at 5% (v/v) (Cz-V8). A. nidulans was maintained at 37 °C onAspergillus minimal medium agar (26.Mattern I.E. Punt P.J. Fungal Genet. Newsl. 1988; 35: 25Google Scholar) with appropriate supplements. For DNA isolation, the fungi were grown in liquid culture with shaking. Where appropriate, wheat varieties Avalon and Cadenza were used for pathogenicity studies. Fungi were transformed using standard methods (20.Hynes M.J. J. Genet. 1996; 75: 297-311Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 21.Cooley R.N. Shaw R.K. Franklin F.C.H. Caten C.E. Curr.

Cultures were routinely maintained as plug inocula from master plates or frozen conidial suspensions in water or 15% glycerol. ODC mutants were grown on Czapek agar medium supplemented with trace elements (46 mg MnSO4·7H2O, 65.9 mg of ZnSO4·7H2O, 59 mg of CuSO4·5H2O, 75 mg of FeSO4·7H2O, 37.8 mg of Na2MoO4·2H2O added to 1000 ml of H2O), and 60 μm putrescine. For mycelial suspensions, plugs were inoculated into Czapek Dox (Oxoid)/V8 (Cz-V8) media and grown in a shaking incubator for 2 days at 18 °C and 250 rpm. A. nidulans strain G0171 (puA2;biA1) was grown on complete media (20.0 g of Difco malt extract. 1.0 g of Bacto-Peptone, 20.0 g of glucose, 20.0 g of Bacto-agar, and appropriate supplements in 1000 ml of H2O). Leaf 3 of 14-day-old wheat seedlings was attached to horizontal plastic sheet using double-sided sticky tape. Inoculum consisting of 105fresh fungal spores was applied to leaves in 20-μl water drops at 5 drops per leaf. Inoculated plants were sealed in large plastic bags to maintain humidity and incubated at 20 °C with a 16-h photoperiod. Disease severity was scored after 7 days as described previously (23.Benedikz P.W. Mappledoram C.J. Scott P.R. Trans. Br. Mycol. Soc. 1981; 77: 667-669Crossref Google Scholar). For PCR, 100 ng of genomic DNA of S. nodorum was used in a “hot-start” PCR reaction. The amplification conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 5 min, 75 °C for 5 min, then 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 52 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 3 min. The degenerate primers were used at a final concentration of 2.5 μm. One-hundredth of the first-round product was used in the second-round PCR with the inner pair of nested primers, under identical amplification conditions. The outer pair of primers were the 5′-primer (5′-CCNT(T/C)TA(T/C)GCNGTNAA(A/G)TG(T/C)AA-3′), representing the amino acid sequence PFYAVKCN, and the 3′-primer (5′-CC(A/G)TC(A/G)CANGTNGGNCCCCA-3′), representing the sequence (W)GPTCDG. The second-round internal pair of primers were the 5′-primer (5′-TNATNT(T/A)(T/C)GCNAA(T/C)CCNTG-3′), representing the amino acid sequence I(F/Y)ANPC, and the 3′-primer (5′-TNCC(A/G)TANACNCCA(A/G)TC(A/G)TT-3′), representing the sequence NDGVYG(S/N). The products of several PCRs were pooled and size-fractionated on a 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel. After the second round of PCR, only one distinct band of the right size was visible after ethidium bromide staining and DNA from that band was isolated and cloned as a blunt-ended fragment into the EcoRV site of the vector pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene). The identity of the cloned fragment was determined by sequencing the PCR product. 50,000 clones from a S. nodorum λ GEM11 genomic library were screened with the ODC PCR product radioactively labeled using the High Prime Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The labeled DNA was separated from unincorporated nucleotides by running the reaction mixture over a small gel filtration column (Nick Column; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All sequencing reactions were performed on double-stranded plasmid DNA using a Perkin-Elmer ABI PRISM Dye Terminatior Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit. The sequence of both strands of the genomic ODC clone was determined by a combination of oligonucleotide primer walking and subcloning into pUC18. Sequence determination was carried out with an ABI377 automated sequencer and analyzed using the GCG package (24.Genetics Computer GroupWisconsin Package Version 8. Madison, WI1994Google Scholar). The plasmids used in the transformation of S. nodorum were as follows: pST28 was constructed by ligating a 1.4-kb HpaI fragment from pCB1004 (25.Carroll A.M. Sweigard J.A. Valent B. Fungal Genet. Newsl. 1994; 41: 23Google Scholar), containing the hygromycin resistance gene from Escherichia coli under control of the TrpC promoter from A. nidulans, into pLitmus28 (New England Biolabs). Plasmid pAN7-1 contains the hygromycin resistance gene from E. coli flanked by the highly expressed A. nidulans gpd promoter and the terminator region of the A. nidulans trpC gene (26.Mattern I.E. Punt P.J. Fungal Genet. Newsl. 1988; 35: 25Google Scholar). A 4.8-kb XmnI fragment of genomic DNA containing the complete open reading frame of ODC was cloned into pUC18 to form pXmnI. Construction of plasmids for disruption of the S. nodorumODC gene is illustrated in Fig. 2 A. To construct vectors for replacement of ODC a 1011-bp SalI-HindIII fragment containing ODC promoter sequences was cut from pXmnI and cloned into pBluescript SK+ to form plasmid pFRONT2. A 1062-bp fragment containing 3′-non-coding sequences was amplified by PCR from pXmnI using primers odcA 5′-GCGGATCCGTACCACATTGGCGTC and a standard pBluescript SK+ flanking primer. The resulting PCR product was cloned as a SacI-BamHI fragment into pBluescript SK+ to form plasmid pBACK2. TheSalI-HindIII fragment from pFRONT2 was then cloned into SalI-HindIII cut pBACK2 to form plasmid pDIS3. The hygromycin resistance cassette from pAN7-1 was excised with BglII and HindIII and cloned intoBamHI-HindIII digested pDIS3 to form plasmid pSNODCDIS. This plasmid was linearized with KpnI prior to transformation into S. nodorum. Plasmid DNA was isolated by a modification of the alkaline lysis method (27.Birnboim H.C. Doly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1513-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (9899) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was purified by a modification of the method by Specht et al.(28.Specht C.A. DiRusso C.C. Novotny C.P. Ullrich R.C. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 158-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Liquid cultures were collected on Miracloth in a funnel and washed with TSE (150 mm NaCl, 100 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8). The washed mycelia were subsequently freeze-dried. Mycelium (1 g dry weight) was ground to a fine powder and transferred to a 250-ml conical flask; 25 ml of extraction buffer (TSE + 2% SDS) and 0.2 volumes of toluene was added. The flask was shaken very slowly on a rotary shaker for 3 days. The DNA was separated from the toluene by spinning at 15,000 × g for 15 min in a SS34 rotor. The DNA is concentrated in the interphase between the water and the toluene phase. The DNA was removed and spun again to remove the toluene. 0.25 volumes of 7.5 m NH4Ac was added and the polysaccharides were precipitated overnight at 4 °C. Polysaccharides were pelleted at 39,000 × g for 30 min in a SS34 rotor. The DNA was precipitated with 0.7 volumes of isopropyl alcohol. The precipitate was removed with a sealed-off Pasteur pipette and resuspended in 750 μl of TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) and 50 μg/ml RNase. The RNase digestion was performed at 37 °C for 30 min. Proteinase K was added to 100 μg/ml and left to incubate for another 2 h at 37 °C. The DNA solution was extracted with phenol/CHCl3. The DNA was once more precipitated and resuspended in TE. For Southern analysis, 5 μg of genomic fungal DNA was digested with appropriate restriction enzymes overnight at the appropriate temperature. The DNA was separated on a 0.8% agarose gel and standard techniques (29.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) were employed for treating and blotting the DNA onto a Nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Pre-hybridization and hybridization solutions were 5 × Denhardts (2% gelatin, 2% Ficoll 400, 2% polyvinylpyrolidone 360, 10% SDS), 100 μg/ml denatured calf thymus DNA, 0.2% SDS, and 1 × HSB (3 m NaCl, 0.1 m PIPES, 20 mm EDTA, pH 6.8). Hybridization was performed overnight at 65 °C. All washes were performed at high stringency: 0.1 × SSC and 0.5% SDS at 65 °C (twice for 30 min). S. nodorum was transformed essentially as described by Cooley et al. (25.Carroll A.M. Sweigard J.A. Valent B. Fungal Genet. Newsl. 1994; 41: 23Google Scholar). After transformation, the plates were incubated overnight at 18 °C and the next day overlaid with Cz-V8 agar containing 1 mmputrescine and 100 μg/ml hygromycin B or 500 μg/ml zeacin (Invitrogen), as appropriate. The plates were incubated at 18 °C under near UV light until the first emerging colonies were visible; these were transferred weekly to new selective media. The method was essentially as reported by De Graaff (30.De Graaff L.H. The Structure and Expression of the Pyruvate Kinase Gene of Aspergillus nidulans and Aspergillus niger Ph.D. thesis. Agricultural University Wageningen, Netherlands1989Google Scholar). Plates of transformed protoplasts were incubated at 37 °C in the dark until the first emerging colonies were visible. Spores from these were removed and streaked out to single colonies on MM plates (MM, 1.2% agar and appropriate supplements). Spores from a single colony were transferred into 100 μl of water and subsequently propagated and tested for complementation of putrescine auxotrophy. Fungal ODC activity was measured by following the release of 14CO2 from [1-14C]ornithine in a protocol adapted from Stevenset al. (31.Stevens L. McKinnon I.M. Winther M. Biochem. J. 1976; 158: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Spores were harvested from confluently sporulating Cz-V8 plates and washed extensively with sterile distilled water. They were suspended in Cz-Dox liquid media (100 ml) at 1 × 107/ml and incubated at 25 °C with shaking. Material was harvested by filtration through Miracloth (Calbiochem). Samples were ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen with glass beads, then resuspended in 2–3 ml of extraction buffer (10 mmpotassium phosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmpyridoxal phosphate, pH 7.6) and briefly vortexed. The resulting extract was centrifuged at 25,000 × g to remove cell debris then desalted to remove other decarboxylase substrates by buffer exchange in a Nap 10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturers instructions. Reactions (0.4 ml) containing 50 mm Tris, 0.05 mm ornithine, 0.32 mmpyridoxal phosphate, 4.625 MBq (0.125 mCi) of [14C]ornithine, pH 8.0, and 0.2 ml of extract were carried out in 14-ml snap-top Falcon tubes. CO2 was captured in suspended 0.5 ml of Eppendorf tubes containing 50 μl of 2-methoxyethanol/ethanolamine (2:1, v/v). Reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min and stopped by addition of 0.1 ml of 50% trichloroacetic acid then left for an additional 1 h to trap released CO2. Trapped CO2 was measured in a scintillation counter. Protein was measured in 0.2-ml samples using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Degenerate oligonucleotides designed against conserved amino acids within the ODC proteins of human (32.Hickok N.J. Seppanen P.L. Gunsalus G.L. Janne O.A. DNA J. Mol. Cell.

Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) were used as PCR primers to amplify an internal fragment of theS. nodorum ODC gene. A product of 609 bp was obtained usingS. nodorum DNA as a template and this was cloned into pBluescript SK− (Stratagene) and sequenced to confirm its identity. The fragment was purified, labeled with [32P]dCTP and then used as a hybridization probe to screen a genomic DNA library of S. nodorum in the vector λGEM11. 20 Positive plaques were identified, purified by a further two rounds of screening and DNA purified. Digested DNA was electrophoresed, blotted onto nylon membranes, and probed to identify those fragments corresponding to the ODC gene. These were subcloned into pUC18 and sequenced. A 4.8-kb region was fully sequenced (GenBank accession number AJ249387). This contained an open reading frame that encoded a protein of 462 amino acids and was interrupted by a single intron of 51 bp. The intron is bounded by sequences typical of fungal introns (34.Gurr S.J. Unkles S.E. Kinghorn J.R. Kinghorn J.R. Gene Structure in Eukaryotic Microbes. IRL Press, Oxford1988: 93-139Google Scholar). The predicted amino acid sequence of this protein is shown in Fig.1. The protein encoded by this gene is typical of ornithine decarboxylase proteins and contains all of the motifs conserved in those of other species. However, analysis of the sequence failed to reveal the PEST sequences which are believed to be important for the rapid protein degradation (35.Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1959) Google Scholar) observed in ODCs from some other species. The mRNA of ODC from N. crassa has a long 450-bp 5′-leader sequence and it has been suggested that this may allow for post-transcriptional control of ODC by enabling regulation of mRNA stability (36.Pitkin J. Perriere M. Kaneh I.A. Ristow J.L. Davis R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Although we have not precisely determined the transcription start site for S. nodorum ODC, reverse transcriptase-PCR using primer pairs from the ODC promoter region has shown that this occurs within a region 470–600-bp upstream of the predicted methionine initiation codon, so it is possible that theS. nodorum ODC is also regulated in the same manner (data not shown). The identity of the cloned gene was confirmed by co-transforming the 4.8-kb genomic fragment containing the proposed S. nodorum ODC gene, pXmnI, with pGM32 a plasmid containing pyr-4 into an ODC minuspyrG mutant (puA, pyrG) of A. nidulans that is auxotrophic for putrescine and uridine (37.Sneath P.H.A. Nature. 1955; 175: 818Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Transformants were recovered on the basis of their ability to grow in the absence of uridine. A number of these transformants were able to grow in the absence of exogenous polyamine demonstrating that theS. nodorum ODC gene was capable of complementing thepuA mutation. Although the transformed colonies had the same radial growth rate as wild-type A. nidulans, they exhibited delayed and reduced conidiation. It is known that high levels of polyamines are needed for conidiation in A. parasiticus and that conidiation can be prevented by the addition of diamino butanone (a polyamine biosynthesis inhibitor) at concentrations that do not inhibit mycelial growth (38.Guzman-de-Pena D. Ruiz-Herera J. Fungal Genet. Cell Biol. 1997; 21: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This suggested that although sufficient putrescine was being produced for mycelial growth, there was not enough polyamine synthesized to fully support sporulation and so presumably this heterologous gene was not properly regulated or fully functional. In order to examine the effect of ODC mutation in S. nodorum, a two-step gene disruption strategy was devised. Having cloned the gene, it was necessary to make a construct suitable for gene disruption. A 1-kb region from upstream of the N-terminal methionine and 1 kb from downstream of the stop codon were isolated, and ligated into pUC19 along with the hygromycin resistance cassette so that they flanked the hygromycin gene (Fig.2 A). This construct was transformed into S. nodorum using standard protocols (21.Cooley R.N. Shaw R.K. Franklin F.C.H. Caten C.E. Curr. Genet. 1988; 13: 383-389Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and transformants recovered on media containing both 100 μg/ml hygromycin and 100 μm putrescine. The transformants were purified and tested for putrescine-dependant growth. Of 150 transformants tested, numbers 26, 128, 132, and 143 were unable to grow in the absence of exogenous putrescine and so were presumably devoid of ODC activity. DNA was isolated from these transformants and analyzed to confirm that the ODC gene had indeed been deleted from these isolates. Fig. 2 B shows a Southern blot of DNA from wild-type and candidate disruptant colonies probed with the ODC encoding region. The ODC coding region has been deleted from three of the candidate disruptants, 26, 128, and 135; these strains have been renamed mutants Δ26, Δ128, and Δ135, respectively. Transformant 143 has a complex rearrangement at this locus. This confirms that the colonies that were unable to grow without putrescine have indeed lost the ODC coding sequence, and that a functional ODC gene is required for growth when no exogenous polyamines are available. Since deletion of a single copy of the ODC gene from this haploid organism removes all hybridizing bands on this Southern blot, this result also confirms the presence of a single copy of the ODC gene in the S. nodorum genome. ODC enzyme activity was determined in wild-type and ODC− S. nodorum. As ODC activity was difficult to detect in mycelia we determined activity in germinating spores where activity was expected to be high. The highest level of ODC activity is observed at the same time as germination occurs (Fig. 3). No ODC activity could be detected in any ODC− mutant strain. This observation agrees well with a role for polyamines in the differentiation of fungi. To test the ability of different polyamines to restore growth of the ODC− mutant, strains were grown on minimal agar medium containing 60 μm putrescine, spermine, and spermidine, with or without the addition of DFMO. We note that DFMO has been reported to be a poor inhibitor of growth for a number of fungal species, among them S. nodorum. These inhibition experiments relied on measurements of growth rate on rich media, such as potato dextrose agar (PDA) or Czapek Malt agar (CMA). Therefore, growth rates for wild-type and ODC− S. nodorum were determined using PDA, CMA, and a defined minimal medium (MM) in combination with added polyamines and DFMO to determine the effects of ODC inhibition. DFMO is a potent inhibitor of wild-type S. nodorum growth on defined minimal medium but not on rich medium such as PDA or CMA (Fig. 4 A). However, the ODC− mutant is restored to wild-type growth rate on MM with the addition of 60 μm putrescine, spermine, or spermidine (Fig. 4 B). The antagonistic effects of DFMO on growth on defined minimal medium can be completely reversed by addition of 60 μm putrescine, spermine, or spermidine, which suggests that the PDA and CMA media contain sufficient amounts of polyamines to counteract the effects of DFMO. This may explain the poor inhibition of fungal growth previously reported on these media. It would be interesting to re-examine the inhibitory effects of DFMO on “insensitive” fungi using defined minimal media. Furthermore, interesting questions are raised concerning polyamine uptake and ODC turnover in those fungi which were DFMO-sensitive on rich media. Spores isolated from wild-type and mutant strains of S. nodorum were used to inoculate wheat plants in our standard bioassay procedure and the strains were assessed for virulence (23.Benedikz P.W. Mappledoram C.J. Scott P.R. Trans. Br. Mycol. Soc. 1981; 77: 667-669Crossref Google Scholar). Disease scores after 7 days are shown in Fig. 5; ODC disruptants are severely reduced in their ability to cause disease. After 10 days, it was clear that the ODC mutants were still able to infect and could occasionally produce lesions which were much smaller than those formed by the wild-type strain. This demonstrated that the ODC-disrupted strains have reduced virulence and thus, presumably cannot obtain sufficient polyamines from the plant during infection to support normal growth and disease development. We have cloned and sequenced the ODC gene from S. nodorum and shown that it is functional in A. nidulansby restoring putrescine prototrophy to a putrescine auxotroph. Sporulation of the A. nidulans transformants was reduced compared with the wild-type; this may indicate that the S. nodorum gene cannot provide sufficient putrescine to support the normal levels of conidiation of A. nidulans. It may be because the heterologous enzyme is expressed at a reduced rate, is not assembled correctly, cannot be fully induced in the heterologous host, or that some control regions were not present in the construct used for complementation. It does, however, confirm that a supply of polyamines is essential for the sporulation process and that even if normal vegetative growth can proceed, sporulation and, hence, disease dissemination may be impaired by inhibition of the polyamine pathway in a fungus. Targeted gene replacement of ODC in S. nodorumdemonstrates the essential housekeeping function of this enzyme in this species. These mutants are strict auxotrophs, showing germination but almost no growth on minimal medium in the absence of exogenous polyamines. These ODC disruptants grow at a rate similar to the wild-type when supplemented with sufficient exogenous putrescine. Putrescine, spermine, and spermidine were equally able to complement the polyamine auxotrophy in the ODC null mutant cells, suggesting that there is no strict requirement for putrescine in growth. ODC−-deficient mutants of N. crassa, A. nidulans, and mammals also require polyamines for growth suggesting a similarly vital role for ODC in these organisms. This result also confirms that ODC is the sole route to polyamine biosynthesis in S. nodorum. Together with the observation that previous reports of ODC inhibitor insensitivity may well have arisen from unintentional contamination of media with polyamines, this suggests that inhibition of polyamine biosynthesis may be a useful therapeutic target for this class of pathogens. It is not known whether the fungus has a strict requirement for spermidine in growth and disease development. A S. nodorum spermidine synthase genomic clone has been isolated and work is underway to create spermidine synthase knockout mutants to test the validity of this enzyme as a therapeutic target. Deletion of the ODC genes from Leishmania donovani (19.Jiang Y. Roberts C. Jardim A. Carter N.S. Shih S. Ariyanayagam M. Fairlamb A.H. Ullmann U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3781-3788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) results in a requirement for either putrescine or spermidine but not for spermine, hence, this protozoan seems to lack a catabolic pathway for spermine. Spermine is the major polyamine in mammals and, thus, ODC null mutants of this parasite are unlikely to be able to scavenge usable polyamines from their host. Plants contain significant amounts of spermidine and putrescine. ODC-deficient S. nodorum and other fungi can utilize all three polyamines to maintain growth suggesting that ODC mutants could scavenge sufficient polyamine from the plant host to maintain growth during disease development. Pathogenicity assays of the mutant strains using spore inoculum resulted in greatly reduced lesions compared with the wild-type. This shows that although the strains are still pathogenic, their virulence is greatly reduced. We believe this to be the first demonstration of a role for ODC in pathogenesis of any organism. The limited growth of the ODC disruptants in planta is presumably sustained by utilizing plant-derived polyamines. The possibility that spores used in the assay have reserves of polyamines that allow limited growth within the plant cannot be disregarded. Attempts to produce polyamine-starved spores were unsuccessful, because continued growth of ODC mutants in the absence of polyamines did not occur. Progressive reduction of polyamine levels in the medium also resulted in greatly reduced sporulation, preventing reliable pathogenicity tests. If it were possible to find a compound that completely inhibited fungal ODC activity during plant infection, mimicking the effects of the mutation, then presumably the same degree of reduction in lesion development would be observed. It would be interesting to investigate whether ODC− strains are more sensitive to toxic polyamine analogues (39.Havis N.D. Walters D.R. Foster S.A. Martin W.P. Cook F.M. Robins D.J. Pestic. Sci. 1994; 41: 61-69Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 40.Havis N.D. Walters D.R. Martin W.P. Cook F.M. Robins D.J. Pestic.

Phytopathol. 1997; 145: 43-45Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar) than the wild-type, since they must be utilizing a polyamine uptake system to supply their requirement, raising the possibility of a dual control approach. It is also noteworthy that a number of plant defense compounds are polyamine conjugates. Due to the need for uptake of exogenous polyamines, it is possible that the mutants would be more sensitive to such compounds. Our work has demonstrated that ornithine decarboxylase is essential for virulence of a fungal pathogen and that inhibition of ODC may be a valid approach to the design of new fungicides. This disease is a prime target for chemical or biological control in winter cereals and the demonstration of a requirement for ODC in virulence and growth has important implications in the consideration of polyamine biosynthesis as a fungicide target."

The prodomain of caspase-9 is necessary for its activation through binding of Apaf-1, which then associates with cytochrome c (30.Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X.

It also has been reported that several inhibitory molecules of the FADD-death effector domain homology regions, such as FLAME-1 and p14.1 of adenovirus, enable extensive recruitment of apoptotic effector molecules and apoptosis (32.Srinivasula S.M.

Thus, the prodomains of the caspases can function to physically link the death receptors or intracellular apoptotic mediators to downstream caspase activation pathways.Caspase-1, first known as IL-1β converting enzyme, is a member of the group of caspases with large prodomains. The prodomain of caspase-1 (Pro-C1) represents the 11.5-kDa amino acid terminal portion of the 45-kDa caspase-1 precursor. Pro-C1 is produced as a residual component after proteolytic cleavage of the precursor generates the functional caspase-1 subunits of molecular masses 20 and 10 kDa, known as the p20 and p10 subunits, respectively (Fig. 1). Active caspase-1, a (p20/p10)2 tetramer, is necessary and sufficient for cleavage of precursor IL-1β as well as for induction of apoptosis in some cell lines (34.Alnemri E.S. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4312-4317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 35.Tatsuta T. Cheng J. Mountz J.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3949-3957PubMed Google Scholar). Although the role of p20/p10 subunits has been well characterized, the function of the residual 11.5-kDa Pro-C1 has not been clarified.In this study, using a yeast two-hybrid system, Pro-C1 is shown to exhibit self-association but does not appear to associate with the other subunits of caspase-1 or caspase-3. Pro-C1 facilitates Fas apoptosis signaling and activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 but does not affect activation of caspase-1.DISCUSSIONIt has been established that the prodomains of caspase-8 and caspase-9 are functional; we therefore undertook a study of the function of Pro-C1. Because of the key role of the caspases in apoptosis, we investigated the role of Pro-C1 in apoptosis using HeLa cells that were transfected with Pro-C1 (HeLa/Pro-C1 cells). We found that HeLa cells transfected with Pro-C1 (HeLa/Pro-C1) are more susceptible to Fas-mediated apoptosis than HeLa or HeLa/vec cells and that this enhanced susceptibility to apoptosis in HeLa/Pro-C1 cells is specific for apoptosis triggered by Fas because apoptosis triggered by etoposide was unaffected and the cells remained resistant to TNF-α-induced cytotoxicity. Overexpression of Pro-C1 did not induce apoptosis in the absence of a trigger, suggesting that Pro-C1 does not act as an initiator of apoptosis but rather facilitates Fas-mediated apoptosis specifically.It has been reported previously that, in some cell lines, susceptibility to Fas-mediated apoptosis is correlated with the amount of Fas antigen expressed on the cell surface (39.Sumimoto S. Ishigami T. Horiguchi Y. Yonehara S. Kanazashi S. Heike T. Katamura K. Mayumi M. Cell Immunol. 1994; 153: 184-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). There was, however, no significant difference in the levels of Fas expression in HeLa/Pro-C1 cells and HeLa cells, suggesting that Pro-C1 acts to enhance the apoptotic process by affecting a component of the apoptotic pathway that lies downstream of Fas ligation.Prime candidates for the regulation of apoptosis are the caspases that play a critical role in the apoptosis signal transduction cascade and the execution of apoptosis-related functions. Notably, caspase-1 was not activated in either the transfected cell line or the vector control cell line. In contrast, the activity of caspase-3 and caspase-8 was significantly higher in HeLa/Pro-C1 cells than in HeLa/vec cells, suggesting that the facilitation of Fas apoptosis by Pro-C1 depends on the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-8 but not caspase-1. This was substantiated by the finding that DEVD-cho or IETD-fmk, inhibitors for caspase-3 and caspase-8, almost completely abolished the enhancement of Fas-mediated apoptosis in HeLa/Pro-C1 cells, whereas YVAD-cmk, an inhibitor for caspase-1, did not affect the enhancement of Fas-mediated apoptosis. Although the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-8 is known to be important in apoptotic signal transduction (40.Miura M. Zhu H. Rotello R. Hartwieg E.A. Yuan J. Cell. 1993; 75: 653-660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar), the hierarchy, interactions, and regulation of the caspases have not been elucidated fully. In some cell lines, activation of caspase-8 and caspase-1 precedes that of caspase-3, whereas caspase-3 and caspase-8 appear to be activated simultaneously during apoptosis in other cell lines receiving the same stimuli (20.Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2617) Google Scholar, 40.Miura M. Zhu H. Rotello R. Hartwieg E.A. Yuan J. Cell. 1993; 75: 653-660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). It also has been reported that caspase-8 activates caspase-3 through proteolysis (27.Duan H. Dixit V.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 28.Muzio M. Stockwell B.R. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2926-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar), and several intracellular components have been identified as substrates for caspase-3 (25.Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4103) Google Scholar). Taken together, these reports suggest that caspase-8 plays a role in the initial amplification of caspase activation, whereas caspase-3 plays a pivotal role during the final execution of apoptosis. We were therefore able to analyze the potential interactions of Pro-C1 by comparing the time course of activation in the presence and absence of specific caspase inhibitors in the transfected cells. We found that the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-8 occurred more rapidly in the Pro-C1/HeLa cells. The activation of caspase-3 was inhibited by the inhibitor of caspase-8 (IETD-fmk), whereas the activation of caspase-8 was not inhibited by the inhibitor of caspase-3 (DEVD-cho) in HeLa/Pro-C1 cells treated with CH-11. These results suggest that caspase-8 is activated upstream of caspase-3 in Fas-mediated apoptosis of HeLa cells and that Pro-C1 accelerates the activation of caspase-8 in signal transduction of Fas-mediated apoptosis.The present experiments indicate that overexpression of Pro-C1 specifically enhances Fas apoptosis signaling as well as activation of caspase-8 and, thereby, caspase-3 activation but not caspase-1 activation in HeLa cells. The specificity for Fas apoptosis signaling is likely because of unique interactions of Pro-C1 not with the TNF receptor 1-associated death signaling complex but with the Fas-associated death signaling complex. Caspase-1 is synthesized initially as a single inactive polypeptide zymogen consisting of the p20 and p10 subunits connected to a long N-terminal prodomain of 119 amino acids, which is cleaved off before or during the formation of the active protease tetramer (p10/p20)2 (25.Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4103) Google Scholar, 34.Alnemri E.S. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. J. Biol.

It has been proposed that the prodomains of caspases could prevent premature protease activation or participate in the complex process of cis- and trans-cleavage at internal Asp residues resulting in the release of the small and large subunits and their realignment to form the active tetramer (25.Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4103) Google Scholar, 42.Gu Y. Wu J. Faucheu C. Lalanne J-L. Diu A. Livingston D.J. Su M.-S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1923-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Overexpression of caspase-7 that lacks the short prodomain causes apoptosis, whereas expression of pro-caspase-7 does not, implying that this prodomain may play a role in silencing the caspase activity (43.Duan H. Chinnaiyan A.M. Hudson P.L. Wing J.P. He W.-W. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1621-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Here, we have shown that Pro-C1 exhibits binding affinity for itself, but not for the other components of either caspase-1 or caspase-3 and that facilitation of Fas apoptosis by Pro-C1 is independent of the activity of caspase-1. These were surprising findings as the amino acid sequences that are known to be necessary for association with the other caspases or regulatory molecules, such as caspase-8 or FADD, have not been identified in Pro-C1 (26.Ahmad H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar), which would suggest that the most likely mechanism by which Pro-C1 would affect the activation of caspase-1 would be through its ability to self-associate. Thus, the ability of Pro-C1 to act by indirectly enhancing the activity of caspase-8 differs from the previously described activities of the caspase prodomains.The prodomain of caspase-1 has been shown to play a role in nuclear translocation of caspase-1 with the amino acids 4–11 of this domain representing the KVLKEKRK nuclear localization signal. Increased expression of the Pro-C1 resulted in activation of caspase-1 and apoptosis of 293 T cells, whereas expression of p20-IL-1β-converting enzyme or p10-IL-1β-converting enzyme did not induce apoptosis (44.Mao P-L. Jiang Y. Wee B-Y. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23621-23624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that Pro-C1-mediated apoptosis in 293 T cells may involve the sequential activation of caspases including caspase-1 as well as caspase-3 and caspase-8. It is not clear, however, whether the nuclear localization of Pro-C1 is related to the activation of caspase-8 in apoptosis signaling.The question remains as to how Pro-C1 facilitates the activation of caspase-8. It has been reported that a novel protein with caspase recruitment domains interacts with components of death receptor signaling pathways, such as TRAIL receptor 1 (DR4) and TRADD, and activates nuclear factor-κB (45.Costanzo A. Chantal G. Vito P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20127-20132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that Pro-C1 may suppress anti-apoptotic signaling, such as that mediated by activation of nuclear factor-κB, and then facilitates activation of caspase-8 through interaction with regulatory molecules.In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the prodomain of caspase-1 specifically enhances Fas-mediated apoptosis through facilitated activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3. An understanding of the function of Pro-C1 as an accelerator of apoptosis, as well as an improved understanding of the functions of the prodomains of the other caspases, could provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in signal transduction of apoptosis. Fas (apo-1/CD95) can induce apoptosis and is a member of an extensive family of cell surface molecules involved in the signaling of cell death including TNF-R1,1TNF-R2, the neutrophin receptor, CD27, CD30, CD40, OX40, death receptor 3, and death receptor 4 (1.Yonehara S.

Caspase-1 (interleukin-1 β (IL-1β) converting enzyme) is a member of this family and most likely is involved in the apoptosis pathway downstream of caspase-8. Although the details of the molecular processes downstream of FADD and caspase-8 have not been elucidated fully, it is likely that upstream caspases, such as caspase-8, induce sequential activation of the downstream caspases, which include caspase-1 and caspase-3 (19.Enari M.

We assessed whether constitutive activation of SREBPs also influenced the CDP-choline pathway for phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) biosynthesis. Relative to control CHO 7 cells, SRD 4 cells displayed increased PtdCho synthesis and degradation as indicated by a 4–6-fold increase in [3H]choline incorporation into PtdCho and 10–15-fold increase in intracellular [3H]glycerophosphocholine. [3H]Phosphocholine levels in SRD 4 cells were reduced by over 10-fold, suggesting enhanced activity of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase α (CCTα). CHO-SCAP and CHO-SCAP D443N cells displayed modest increases in [3H]choline incorporation into PtdCho (2-fold) and only a 2-fold reduction in [3H]phosphocholine. Elevated PtdCho metabolism in SRD 4, compared with SCAP-overexpressing cells, was correlated with fatty acid synthesis. Inhibition of fatty acid synthesis by cerulenin resulted in almost complete normalization of PtdCho synthesis and choline metabolite profiles in SRD 4 cells, indicating that fatty acids or a fatty acid-derived metabolite was responsible for up-regulation of PtdCho synthesis. In contrast to apparent activation in vivo, CCTα protein, mRNA, and in vitro activity were reduced in SRD 4 cells and unchanged in SCAP transfected cells. Unlike control and SCAP transfected cells, CCTα in SRD 4 cells was localized by immunofluorescence to the nuclear envelope, suggesting that residual enzyme activity in these cells was in an active membrane-associated form. Translocation of CCTα to the nuclear envelope was reproduced by treatment of CHO 7 cells with exogenous oleate. We conclude that the SREBP/SCAP pathway regulates PtdCho synthesis via post-transcriptional activation of nuclear CCTα by fatty acids or a fatty acid-derived signal.

Unlike control and SCAP transfected cells, CCTα in SRD 4 cells was localized by immunofluorescence to the nuclear envelope, suggesting that residual enzyme activity in these cells was in an active membrane-associated form. Translocation of CCTα to the nuclear envelope was reproduced by treatment of CHO 7 cells with exogenous oleate. We conclude that the SREBP/SCAP pathway regulates PtdCho synthesis via post-transcriptional activation of nuclear CCTα by fatty acids or a fatty acid-derived signal. phosphatidylcholine acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase Chinese hamster ovary cholinephosphotransferase CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase glycerophosphocholine sterol regulation-defective sterol regulatory element-binding protein SREBP cleavage-activating protein phosphate-buffered saline polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis calcium-independent phospholipase A2 Eukaryotic cell membranes are composed of a complex array of proteins, phospholipids, sphingolipids, and cholesterol. The relative proportions and fatty acyl composition of these components dictate the physical properties of membranes, such as fluidity, surface potential, microdomain structure, and permeability (1.Cullis P.R. Fenske D.B. Hope M.J. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. New Comprehensive Biochemistry: Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. 31. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1996: 1-33Google Scholar). This in turn regulates the localization and activity of membrane-associated proteins (2.Yeagle P.L. Biochimie (Paris). 1991; 73: 1303-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Assembly of membranes necessitates the coordinate synthesis and catabolism of phospholipids, sterols, and sphingolipids to create the unique properties of a given cellular membrane. This must be an extremely complex process that requires coordination of multiple biosynthetic and degradative enzymes and lipid transport activities. There is evidence from different experimental models showing coordinate synthesis of sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho),1 and cholesterol (reviewed in Refs. 3.Kolesnick R.N. Prog. Lipid Res. 1991; 30: 138-150Crossref Scopus (256) Google Scholar and 4.Ridgway N.D. Byers D.M. Cook H.W. Storey M.K. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 38: 337-360Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In several cases the affected enzymes in each pathway have been identified, but the mediators and mechanism for co-regulation remain unknown. A potentially important pathway for coordinate regulation of membrane composition involves the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs); transcription factors with a dual role in controlling fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis (5.Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2959) Google Scholar, 6.Bennett M.K. Lopez J.M. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. J. Biol.

Biol. 1993; 13: 4753-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). SREBPs are tethered to nuclear/endoplasmic reticulum membranes by two transmembrane segments and undergo two proteolytic reactions that release the soluble, nuclear-localized N-terminal transcription factor domain. The first proteolysis step is sterol-regulated, requires SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), and is catalyzed by a unique membrane-bound protease (5.Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2959) Google Scholar). The second proteolytic step is constitutive and occurs at a site within the first transmembrane domain (5.Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2959) Google Scholar). Results from transgenic and cell models demonstrated that SREBP-2 and -1a stimulated transcription of numerous cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes and the low density lipoprotein receptor, whereas SREBP-1c/ADD-1 (adipocyte determination anddifferentation factor-1) isoforms are exclusively involved in the transcription of several key genes in fatty acid biosynthesis and desaturation (8.Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Shimano H. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). This specificity is not exclusive because both SREBP-1a and -2 appear to stimulate expression of both cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthetic genes. SREBPs also regulate expression of a series of genes involved in the production of NADPH and acetyl-CoA required for fatty acid biosynthesis (10.Shimomura I. Shimano H. Korn B.S. Bashmakov Y. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35299-35306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Recently, SREBP-1c/ADD-1 expression was demonstrated to be insulin-dependent (11.Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Horton J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13656-13661Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar) and required for insulin regulation of gene expression (12.Foretz M. Guichard C. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12737-12742Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 13.Foretz M. Pacot C. Dugail I. Lemarchand P. Guichard C. Le Liepvre Berthelier-Lubrano C. Spiegelman B. Kim J.B. Ferre P Foufelle F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3760-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). In addition to regulation of cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis, SREBP/SCAP could potentially regulate the synthesis of phospholipids and sphingolipids by direct or indirect mechanisms. For example, SREBP 1 was shown to regulate the transcription of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase in cultured cells (14.Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Kim J.B. Spiegalman B.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7298-7305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and transgenic mouse models (10.Shimomura I. Shimano H. Korn B.S. Bashmakov Y. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35299-35306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase is the initial enzyme in the synthesis of phosphatidic acid and diglyceride, two important precursors of phospholipids. Other evidence suggests that SREBPs influence phospholipid synthesis by indirect mechanisms. PtdCho synthesis was reduced in sterol-regulatory-defective (SRD) cells 6 (15.Storey M.K. Byers D.M. Cook H.W. Ridgway N.D. J. Lipid. Res. 1997; 38: 711-722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that have reduced cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis as a consequence of defective SREBP processing (5.Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2959) Google Scholar, 16.Evans M.J. Metherall J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5175-5185Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The absence of active SREBPs in SRD 6 cells did not affect the activity of the first and last enzymes in the CDP-choline pathway, choline phosphotransferase (CPT) and choline kinase. Instead, the activity of CCTα, the rate-limiting enzyme in the CDP-choline pathway (17.Kent C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), was reduced as the result of insufficient activation by fatty acids or a related derivative (15.Storey M.K. Byers D.M. Cook H.W. Ridgway N.D. J. Lipid. Res. 1997; 38: 711-722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sphingomyelin synthesis was also decreased in SRD 6 cells, but again the in vitro activity of biosynthetic enzymes in the pathway was unaffected (18.Storey M.K. Byers D.M. Cook H.W. Ridgway N.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Reduced sphingomyelin synthesis in SRD 6 cells could have been secondary to a relative deficiency in PtdCho, which provides the phosphocholine headgroup to sphingomyelin. Collectively, these results suggest that SREBPs regulate PtdCho and sphingomyelin synthesis indirectly by modifying the supply of precursors or lipid activators for CCT. We have now examined PtdCho synthesis in SRD 4 cells (19.Metherall J.E. Ridgway N.D. Dawson P.A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12734-12740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Nohturfft A. Hua X. Brown M.S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13709-13714Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and CHO cell lines expressing wild-type or a sterol-resistant SCAP mutant (D443N). SRD 4 cells express a SCAP allele with a point mutation (D443N) in the putative “sterol sensing” domain that renders it insensitive to suppression by sterols, resulting in constitutive proteolysis of SREBP 1 and SREBP-2 to the mature transcription factors (20.Nohturfft A. Hua X. Brown M.S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13709-13714Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 23.Hua X. Nofturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). As expected, these cell lines had elevated cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis but also displayed a 2–6-fold increase in PtdCho synthesis because of increased CCTα activity in vivo. In SRD 4 cells, activation of PtdCho synthesis (6-fold) was correlated with increased fatty acid synthesis and CCTα localization to the nuclear envelope. The modest increase in PtdCho and fatty acid synthesis in SCAP transfected cells (2-fold) was not accompanied by changes in CCTα expression or localization. Nuclear envelope localization of CCTα in control cells was reproduced by exogenous oleate, suggesting that elevated synthesis of this CCTα activator (or a derivative thereof) stimulated PtdCho synthesis in sterol regulation-defective cells. [methyl-3H]Choline, CDP-[methyl-3H]choline, [1-14C]acetate, [α-32P]dATP, [32P]phosphate, and [methyl-3H]phosphocholine were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Choline, CDP-choline, phosphocholine, and cerulenin were from Sigma. Lovastatin was provided by Merck. Silica gel 60 TLC plates were from BDH. Monoclonal antibodies against HSV and T7 epitope tags were purchased from Novagen. The SCAP polyclonal antibody R-139 was kindly provided by Dr. Axel Nohturfft (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas TX; Ref. 21.Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Cheng D. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S.

Lipoprotein-deficient serum was prepared from fetal calf serum by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 32 h, followed by extensive dialysis against 10 mm phosphate (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl (PBS) (22.Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). Cell culture medium, fetal calf serum, S1 nuclease (from Aspergillus oryzae), and G418 were from Life Technologies, Inc. SRD 4 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum, 33 μg/ml proline (medium A), and 0.3 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol at 37 °C in CO2/air (1:19). CHO 7 cells were maintained in medium A without 25-hydroxycholesterol. For experiments, SRD 4 and CHO 7 cells were subcultured in 60-mm dishes in medium A without 25-hydroxycholesterol (refer to figure legends for specific details). CHO 7 cells overexpressing SCAP and SCAP D443N were prepared by calcium phosphate transfection with pTK-HSV-SCAP-T7, pTK-HSV-SCAP-T7 (D443N), or empty vector (23.Hua X. Nofturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in medium A with 600 μg/ml G418 until individual colonies were evident at 12–14 days. SCAP transfected cells were trypsinized and cultured in medium A containing 600 μg/ml G418 and 0.5 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol. After 10 days, thirty G418 and 25-hydroxycholesterol resistant colonies were harvested, expanded in culture for 10–14 days, and screened for expression of SCAP and SCAP D443N by immunoblotting of total cell extracts with monoclonal antibodies specific for T7 or HSV epitope tags. Mock transfected cells were selected after growth in G418. Four transfected cell lines expressing epitope-tagged SCAP, SCAP D443N, or empty vector were selected for further characterization. Stock cultures of SCAP transfected cells were maintained in medium A with 300 μg/ml G418 and 0.3 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol and were subcultured for experiments in medium A without G418 or 25-hydroxycholesterol. After labeling with [3H]choline (see figure legends for specific conditions), cells were rinsed once with cold PBS and scraped in 1 ml of methanol-water (5:4, v/v). The culture dish was rinsed with 1 ml of methanol-water, and the extracts were combined in a glass screw cap tube. [3H]PtdCho and aqueous [3H]choline metabolites were separated by extraction with chloroform as described previously (15.Storey M.K. Byers D.M. Cook H.W. Ridgway N.D. J. Lipid. Res. 1997; 38: 711-722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Labeled PtdCho was resolved by TLC in chloroform-methanol-water (65:25:4, v/v/v), whereas aqueous metabolites were separated in a solvent system of ethanol-water-ammonia (48:95:6, v/v/v). In some experiments, [3H]PtdCho was measured by scintillation counting of an aliquot of the chloroform phase (>98% of the radioactivity was in PtdCho). Sterol and fatty acid synthesis was measured by [14C]acetate labeling (24.Brown M.S. Faust J.R. Goldstein J.L. Kandeko I. Endo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1121-1128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with 5 μCi/ml [14C]acetate for 2 h, cell monolayers were dissolved in 1 ml of 0.5 n NaOH, transferred to screwcap tubes, and saponified in 3 ml of ethanol and 0.5 ml of 50% (w/v) KOH for 1 h at 60 °C. The sterol fraction was extracted with 4 ml of hexane and resolved by TLC in petroleum ether-diethyl ether-acetic acid (60:40:1, v/v/v). The zone corresponding to cholesterol was scraped into vials, and radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. Fatty acids were extracted from the hydrolysate with 4 ml of hexane after acidification (pH <3) with HCl. Radioactivity in an aliquot was measured by scintillation counting (>99% of the radioactivity in this fraction were in fatty acids). Total cellular phosphocholine levels were determined by thin layer chromatography and phosphate analysis (15.Storey M.K. Byers D.M. Cook H.W. Ridgway N.D. J. Lipid. Res. 1997; 38: 711-722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by scraping in cold PBS, sedimented at 2,000 × g for 5 min, and homogenized in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride by 20 passages through a 23-gauge needle. The homogenates were centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 ×g, the soluble fraction was collected, and the particulate (total membrane) fraction was resuspended in the same buffer containing 250 mm sucrose. CCT activity in the membrane and soluble fractions was measured by conversion of [3H]phosphocholine to CDP-[3H]choline in the presence or absence of PtdCho-oleate (1:1, mol/mol) vesicles as described previously (15.Storey M.K. Byers D.M. Cook H.W. Ridgway N.D. J. Lipid. Res. 1997; 38: 711-722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9077-9082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CPT activity in membranes was measured by conversion of CDP-[3H]choline to [3H]PtdCho in the presence of 1 mmdioleoylglycerol/0.015% Tween-20 (26.Cornell R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Protein was measured by the method of Lowry et al. (27.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Soluble and total membrane fractions from cells were prepared as described above. Membranes were treated with 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 on ice for 15 min, and the detergent-soluble fraction was isolated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. A total cell Nonidet P-40 soluble fraction was prepared in a similar manner. Equivalent amounts of protein from Nonidet P-40-solubilized cells, Nonidet P-40 solublilized membranes, and cytosol were resolved by SDS-10% PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The filter was incubated with a polyclonal antibody against 45 amino acids of the C-terminal phosphorylation domain of CCTα (provided by Martin Post, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada; Ref. 28.Yang J. Wang J. Tseu I. Kuliszewski M. Lee W. Post M. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), followed by a goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and developed by the chemiluminescence method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All antibody incubations were in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5% (w/v) skim milk powder, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20. This antibody does not cross-react with the CCTβ isoforms because of sequence divergence in the C-terminal phosphorylation domain (29.Lykidis A. Murtis K.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14022-14029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 30.Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of CCTα was measured by labeling cells for 15 h in phosphate-free medium A containing 25 μCi/ml [32P]phosphate. Soluble and total membrane fractions were prepared in buffer A as described previously (15.Storey M.K. Byers D.M. Cook H.W. Ridgway N.D. J. Lipid. Res. 1997; 38: 711-722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane fraction was treated with 0.3% Triton X-100 on ice for 15 min, and the detergent-soluble fraction was recovered after centrifugation at 400,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. [32P]CCTα was immunoprecipitated from cytosol and solubilized membranes (50 μg) in buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100 with a 1:400 dilution of an antibody against the membrane binding region of CCTα (kindly provided by Rosemary Cornell, Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, Canada; Ref. 31.Johnson J.E. Aebersold R. Cornell R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1324 (184): 273Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose was added for 45 min at 20 °C, followed by 6–8 washes with 0.5 ml of PBS containing 1% Triton X-100. Samples were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE in 10% gels. Dried gels were exposed to film at −70 °C. CCTα mRNA was quantitated by S1 nuclease protection assays using a [α32P]dATP-labeled antisense probe corresponding to a 86-base pairHindIII-EcoRI fragment of the rat cDNA as described previously (18.Storey M.K. Byers D.M. Cook H.W. Ridgway N.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The CCTα S1 probe is against the 5′ end of the mRNA and will not hybridize to CCTβ mRNA because of limited sequence similarity in that region (29.Lykidis A. Murtis K.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14022-14029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 30.Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was used as an internal load control. Our previous results showing reduced PtdCho synthesis in cholesterol auxotrophic SRD 6 cells prompted an analysis of PtdCho synthesis in SRD 4 cells, which display elevated cholesterol synthesis that is resistant to down-regulation by 25-hydroxycholesterol (19.Metherall J.E. Ridgway N.D. Dawson P.A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12734-12740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Nohturfft A. Hua X. Brown M.S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc.

Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). PtdCho synthesis and turnover was measured in SRD 4 cells, as well as parental CHO 7 cells, by pulse labeling with [3H]choline for 1 h followed by 4 h of chase in medium containing unlabeled choline (Fig. 1). Following a 1-h pulse, choline incorporation into PtdCho was 4-fold higher in SRD 4 cells relative to controls. The increase in PtdCho synthesis in SRD 4 cells after the 1-h choline pulse was accompanied by a 12-fold decrease in [3H]phosphocholine and 3-fold increase in [3H]CDP-choline, indicative of increased CCT activity. [3H]Phosphocholine was gradually lost from CHO 7 cells, because of conversion to PtdCho, and by 4 h was similar to SRD 4 cells. Phosphocholine pool size in CHO 7 and SRD 4 cells were similar (6.9 ± 1.2 versus 4.6 ± 0.7 nmol/mg protein (n = 3), respectively), indicating that diminished precursor pool size in SRD 4 cells cannot account for rapid synthesis and turnover of radiolabeled PtdCho. In SRD 4 cells, [3H]glycerophosphate (GPC), a product of PtdCho catabolism by phospholipase A, was elevated over 10-fold at the end of the pulse and increased during the chase period. Elevated [3H]GPC in SRD 4 cells during the chase period was accompanied by progressive decay of [3H]PtdCho. However, the loss of radioactivity from PtdCho in SRD 4 cells from 0 to 4 h was not entirely accounted for by increased intracellular GPC. The difference (approximately 500 dpm/mg protein × 10−3) was recovered in the cell culture medium as [3H]choline (results not shown). [3H]Choline pulse experiments showed that SRD 4 cells had elevated PtdCho synthesis and degradation (Fig. 1). Consistent with this observation, PtdCho mass in SRD 4 cells was not significantly different than CHO 7 controls (60.9 ± 4.7 nmol/mg protein in CHO 7 cells (n = 3) versus 53.4 ± 8.1 nmol/mg protein in SRD 4 cells (n = 3)). The mass of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and sphingomyelin in SRD 4 cells was also similar to controls. In addition to the SCAP D443N mutation, SRD 4 cells have a single point mutation in the ACAT gene that renders the enzyme inactive (32.Cao G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14642-14648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although chronic ACAT inhibition by 58–035 in CHO 7 or SCAP transfected CHO cells (see below) did not affect PtdCho synthesis (results not shown), we could not rule out the possibility that reduced ACAT activity or another mutation in the SRD 4 cells contributed to the results shown in Fig. 1. To address this question, CHO 7 cells were stably transfected with the cDNA for wild-type SCAP or the SCAP D443N mutant and PtdCho synthesis was examined. Initially, four clones resistant to killing by 0.5 μg of 25-hydroxycholesterol/ml and expressing epitope-tagged SCAP or SCAP D443N (hereafter referred to as CHO-SCAP or CHO-SCAP D443N) were isolated, and PtdCho synthesis was measured by a 1-h [3H]choline pulse. The average rate of PtdCho synthesis in four mock transfected cell lines was 122.5 ± 32.4 dpm/μg protein, compared with 221.1 ± 22.8 and 206.2 ± 22.0 dpm/μg protein in four CHO-SCAP and CHO-SCAP D443N cells, respectively. Increased PtdCho synthesis in SCAP transfected cells was also accompanied by a 2–3-fold reduction in [3H]phosphocholine. Because all four SCAP- and SCAP D443N-overexpressing cell lines appeared to have a similar phenotype with respect to increased PtdCho synthesis, one cell line from each group was examined in detail. The expression of epitope-tagged and endogenous SCAP and SCAP D443N in the two cell lines is shown in Fig. 2. Immunoblotting with a HSV monoclonal antibody detected a protein doublet of approximately 140–150 kDa in the Nonidet P-40 extracts of CHO-SCAP and CHO-SCAP D443N cell membranes but not in mock transfected controls (Fig. 2 A). It appeared that higher expression of wild-type SCAP compared with the D443N mutant was required to maintain 25-hydroxycholesterol resistance. The cell extracts from Fig.2 A, as well as those from CHO 7 and SRD 4, were also probed with antibody R-139 to detect both endogenous and overexpressed SCAP (21.Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Cheng D. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20213-20221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). This antibody also detected a 140–150-kDa protein doublet in all cells. As expected, expression was highest in the CHO-SCAP and CHO-SCAP D443N cells relative to mock, CHO 7, and SRD 4 cells (Fig.2 B). Irrespective of differences in expression, both CHO-SCAP and CHO-SCAP D443N cells displayed a 2-fold increase in [14C]acetate incorporation into cholesterol relative to mock transfected controls (Fig. 3). Cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis in SRD 4 cells was increased 3-fold above CHO 7 cells. Unlike that of SRD 4 cells, [14C]acetate incorporation into fatty acids in the SCAP-overexpressing cell lines was not significantly increased. PtdCho synthesis was examined in the SCAP-overexpressing cells by [3H]choline labeling followed by 4-h chase in medium containing unlabeled choline (Fig. 4). At the end of the 1-h [3H]choline pulse (0 h) and throughout the 4-h chase, PtdCho synthesis was increased 1.5–2.5-fold in CHO-SCAP and CHO-SCAP D443N cells. Increased PtdCho synthesis in these cells was accompanied by a 2-fold reduction in [3H]phosphocholine levels, a 2–3-fold increase in [3H]CDP-choline, and a 2-fold elevation in [3H]GPC production. Our previous results in SRD 6 cells showed that decreased PtdCho synthesis was not correlated with changes in cellular cholesterol levels but rather with the availability of fatty acids (15.Storey M.K.

https://openalex.org/W1980694674,"We created a novel mutated form of human interleukin-13 (IL-13) in which a positively charged arginine (R) at position 112 was substituted to a negatively charged aspartic acid (D). This mutant, termed IL-13R112D, was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to near homogeneity. IL-13R112D was found to be a potent IL-13 agonist with 5–10-fold improved binding affinity to IL-13 receptors compared with wild-type IL-13 (wtIL-13). The conclusion of IL-13 agonist activity was drawn on the basis of approximately 10-fold improved activity over wtIL-13 in several assays: (a) inhibition of CD14 expression in primary monocytes; (b) proliferation of TF-1 and B9 cell lines; and (c) activation of STAT6 in Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized B cells, primary monocytes, and THP-1 monocytic cell line. Furthermore, mutant IL-13R112D neutralized the cytotoxic activity of a chimeric fusion protein composed of wtIL-13 and a Pseudomonasexotoxin A (IL-13-PE38) approximately 10 times better than wtIL-13. Based on these results, it was concluded that IL-13R112D interacts with much stronger affinity than wtIL-13 on all cell types tested and that Arg-112 plays an important role in the interaction with its receptors (IL-13R). Thus, these results suggest that IL-13R112D may be a useful ligand for the study of IL-13 interaction with its receptors or, alternatively, in designing specific targeted agents for IL-13R-positive malignancies.

Immunother. 1999; 22: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). IL-13 also plays a major role in B cells. It can up-regulate CD23, CD72, major histocompatibility complex class II and surface IgM on B cells, drive IgE class switch, and induce production of immunoglobulins by B cells (6.Punnonen J.

The function of IL-13 is accomplished through interaction with its plasma membrane receptors (7.Obiri N.I. Debinski W. Leonard W.J. Puri R.K. J. Biol.

In type I IL-13R, IL-13 forms a complex with IL-4Rβ chain (also known as IL-4Rα), IL-13Rα′ (also known as IL-13Rα1), and IL-13Rα (also known as IL-13Rα2). This type of receptor complex is expressed in some non-hematopoietic tumor cell lines such as renal cell carcinoma, AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma, and glioblastoma multiforme (7.Obiri N.I.

Med. 1998; 1: 551-557PubMed Google Scholar). In type II IL-13R complex, IL-13Rα chain is not present, and IL-13 binds to IL-4Rβ and IL-13Rα′ chains. Type II IL-13R complex is expressed on some non-hematopoietic malignant cells such as A431, PA-1, and HT-29 (13.Murata T. Obiri N.I. Debinski W. Puri R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Debinski W. Puri R.K. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 756-764PubMed Google Scholar). In the third type of IL-13R complex, IL-4Rβ and IL-13Rα′ chains may associate with IL-2Rγ chain (termed γc), shared between the IL-4R, IL7R, IL9R, and IL15R system (16.Sugamura K. Asao H. Kondo M. Tanaka N. Ishii N. Ohbo K. Nakamura M. Takeshita T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 179-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Type III IL-13Rs are present on hematopoietic cells such as human erythroleukemia cell line TF-1 and healthy human primary monocytes (7.Obiri N.I. Debinski W. Leonard W.J. Puri R.K. J. Biol.

Debinski W. Puri R.K. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 756-764PubMed Google Scholar). Although γc does not interact with IL-13 directly, it modulates IL-13R function through down-regulation IL-13Rα and, to some extent, IL-13Rα′ chains (17.Obiri N.I. Murata T. Debinski W. Puri R.K. J.

In type I IL-4R, IL-4Rβ chain forms a complex with γc. In type II IL-4R, IL-4Rβ chain forms a complex with IL-13Rα′ chain, and in type III IL-4R, all three chains are present (7.Obiri N.I.

These studies suggested that IL-4Rβ and IL-13Rα′ chains are shared between IL-4R and IL-13R systems (23.Murata T. Taguchi J. Puri R.K. Blood. 1998; 91: 3884-3891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously reported that a variety of human solid tumor cells express elevated levels of IL-13Rs (7.Obiri N.I. Debinski W. Leonard W.J. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8797-8804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 10.Puri R.K. Leland P. Obiri N.I. Husain S.R. Kreitman R.J. Haas G.P. Pastan I. Debinski W.

To target these receptors, we produced a chimeric protein (IL-13-PE38QQR) composed of wtIL-13 and a mutated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE38QQR). This cytotoxin is highly cytotoxic to IL-13R-expressing cells (10.Puri R.K. Leland P. Obiri N.I. Husain S.R. Kreitman R.J. Haas G.P. Pastan I. Debinski W. Blood. 1996; 87: 4333-4339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Husain S.R. Obiri N.I. Gill P. Zheng T. Pastan I. Debinski W. Puri R.K. Clin.

However, the binding affinity of IL-13-PE38QQR was 10 times lower than wtIL-13 (10.Puri R.K. Leland P. Obiri N.I. Husain S.R. Kreitman R.J. Haas G.P. Pastan I. Debinski W. Blood. 1996; 87: 4333-4339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To improve the binding affinity of IL-13, we proposed to generate IL-13 muteins by site-directed mutagenesis in which single amino acid substitutions were introduced in the critical region of IL-13 molecule. The selection of single amino acid substitutions was based on structural similarities and reported mutations in a similar cytokine, IL-4. We created and purified human IL-13R112D (in which arginine 112 was changed to aspartic acid) and analyzed its various activities on a variety of cell types. We also tested the capability of IL-13 mutant to inhibit cytotoxicity mediated by IL-13 cytotoxin, IL-13-PE38. We conclude on the basis of these results that IL-13R112D is approximately 5–10 times superior to wtIL-13 in all respects. Restriction endonucleases and DNA ligase were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), Life Technologies, Inc., Panvera (Madison, WI), and Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Fast protein liquid chromatographic columns and media were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Sequence specific oligonucleotide primers were synthesized at Bioserve Biotechnologies (Laurel, MD). Advantage-HF polymerase chain reaction (PCR) kit was fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The pET based expression vector with ampR gene was used for construction of mutein clone. Plasmids were amplified inEscherichia coli (DH5α high efficiency transformation) (Life Technologies, Inc.), and DNA was extracted using Qiagen kits (Chatsworth, CA). TF-1 human erythroleukemia cell line was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and were grown in human granuclocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. B9 mouse plasmacytoma cell line was a kind gift of Giovana Fosato (Center for Biologies Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, Bethesda, MD) and were grown in human IL-6. PM-RCC renal cell carcinoma cell line was established in our laboratory (19.Obiri N.I. Hillman G.G. Haas G.P. Sud S. Puri R.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). THP-1 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Ray Donnelly (Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, Bethesda, MD). Monocytes were isolated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of donors seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis viruses after leukapheresis and purified by countercurrent centrifugal elutriation. A computer program, GCG (Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI) was used for a homology search, data base search, and prediction of secondary structure of IL-13 on Silicon Graphics Workstation in Human Genome Center, the Institutes of Medical Science, University of Tokyo (Tokyo, Japan) and the Center for Information Technology, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). The protein sequence of mouse (IL-13_mouse.swissprot), rat (l26913.gb_ro), Homo sapiens(Caf043334_1.gp_main), and Bos taurus(bta132441_1.gp_main) were obtained from Swiss Prot and GenBankTM. Since l26913.gb_ro is not a protein sequence but a cDNA sequence, it was used for a homology search after translation into a protein sequence. The IL-13 sequences are shown after deletion of predicted signal sequence of Homo sapiensor the equivalent (see Fig. 1). Hydrophobicity and secondary structure of IL-13 was predicted by the Kyte-Doolittle method and Chou-Fasman method, respectively (24.Chou P. Fasman G. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 222-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (2541) Google Scholar).

After subcloning the polymerase chain reaction products into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen®, Carlsbad, CA), the plasmid was digested withNdeI and EcoRI. The fragment was inserted into a prokaryotic pET-based expression vector digested with same restriction enzymes. We confirmed the existence of mutation and restriction sites by sequencing of the plasmid. Expression and purification of IL-13R112D and wtIL-13 was carried out by essentially similar techniques as previously reported for IL-4 (25.Kreitman R.J. Puri R.K. McPhie P. Pastan I. Cytokine. 1995; 7: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the present set of experiments, we used BL21(λDE3)pLys E. coli that contains T7 RNA polymerase under the lac promoter operator in its genome. The protein expression was induced by adding 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. WtIL-13 and IL-13R112D were produced in inclusion bodies. After washing, inclusion bodies were solubilized, refolded, and purified by fast protein ion-exchange liquid chromatography. The purified protein showed a single band at 13 kDa in Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 2). In this study, we used IL-13-PE38 fusion protein, which was expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (26.Debinski W. Obiri N.I. Pastan I. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16775-16780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). 2Bharat. H. Joshi, and Raj K. Peri, unpublished results. Proliferation assays were performed as described previously (27.Leland P. Obiri N. Aggarwal B.B. Puri R.K. Oncol. Res. 1995; 7: 227-235PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, TF-1 and B9 cells were washed 2–3 times to remove granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and IL-6, and then 1 × 103 to 5 × 103 cells were cultured in 96-well plates in RPMI complete medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Varying concentrations of wtIL-13 and IL-13R112D were added to the wells, and the cells were cultured for 1–2 days. Tritiated thymidine (0.5 μCi) was added to each well 6–9 h before the plates were harvested in a Skatron cell harvester (Skatron, Inc., Sterling, VA). Filter mats were counted in a β plate counter (Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD). Protein synthesis inhibition assay was performed as described previously (28.Puri R.K. Ogata M. Leland P. Feldman G.M. Fitzgerald D. Pastan I. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3011-3017PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 1 × 103 PM-RCC cells were cultured in leucine-free medium (Biofluids, Rockville, MD) for 4 h to allow adherence to flat-bottomed microtiter plates. These cells then received various concentrations of IL-13-PE38 incubated for 20–24 h at 37 °C and then 1 μCi of [3H]leucine (NEN Life Science Products) was added to each well and cultured for an additional 4 h. For blocking experiments, 2 μg/ml of wtIL-13 or IL-13R112D was added before the addition of IL-13-PE38. Finally, cells were washed and harvested on a fiberglass filter mat, and cell-associated radioactivity was measured in a β plate counter. The concentration of IL-13-PE38 at which 50% inhibition of protein synthesis (IC50) occurred was calculated. Recombinant human IL-4 and rhIL-13 were labeled with 125I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by using IODO-GEN reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The specific activity of radiolabeled IL-4 and IL-13 ranged from 21.0 to 22.0 μCi/μg and 17.6 to 18.0 μCi/μg, respectively. The equilibrium binding studies were carried out as described elsewhere (7.Obiri N.I. Debinski W. Leonard W.J. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8797-8804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 19.Obiri N.I. Hillman G.G. Haas G.P. Sud S. Puri R.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 106 cells in 100 μl of binding buffer were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with [125I]IL-4 (500 pm) or [125I]IL-13 (500 pm) in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations (10 pm-200 nm) of unlabeled wtIL-13 or IL-13R112D. Duplicate samples of cells associated with [125I]IL-4 or [125I]IL-13 were separated from free [125I]IL-4 or [125I]IL-13 by centrifugation through a cushion of phthalate oils. The cell pellets were counted in a γ counter (Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD). Flow cytometric analysis of monocytes were performed as described elsewhere (4.Cosentino G. Soprana E. Thienes C.P. Siccardi A.G. Viale G. Vercelli D. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3145-3151PubMed Google Scholar). Primary monocytes were cultured at 1 × 107 cells/ml in polypropylene tubes for 72 h with various concentrations of wtIL-13 or IL-13R112D. Cells were washed and incubated at 4 °C for 60 min in fluorescence-activated cell sorter staining buffer (Hanks1balanced salt solution plus 0.5% fetal bovine serum, 0.1% sodium azide) containing fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-human CD14 (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) antibodies as per the manufacturer's recommendations. For controls, cells were either incubated in fluorescence-activated cell sorter staining buffer alone or with isotype control antibody, mouse IgG2a, and then antimouse Ig fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated was used as secondary antibody for staining. The cells were subsequently washed, and fluorescence data were collected on a FACScan/C32 equipment (Becton Dickinson). The results were analyzed with a WinList software program, and fluorescence intensity was expressed as mean channel number on 256 channel/104 log scale. EMSA was performed as described before (21.Murata T. Obiri N.I. Puri R.K. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 70: 230-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 23.Murata T. Taguchi J. Puri R.K. Blood. 1998; 91: 3884-3891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation with various concentrations of wtIL-13 or IL-13R112D for 10 min, THP-1 cells, primary monocytes, and Tory EBV-immortalized B cells (a gift from Dr. Giovanna Tosato, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration) were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized with cold whole-cell extraction buffer (1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 20% glycerol). DNA-protein interactions were assessed by EMSA using the bandshift kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Briefly, 40 μg of sample proteins were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 1 ng of32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe STAT-binding element-1 (sense oligo 5′-gat cgc tct tct tcc cag gaa ctc aat g-3′, antisense oligo 5′-tcg aca ttg agt tcc tgg gaa gaa gag c-3′) in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiotheitol, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.05 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)2). In some experiments, a 200-fold excess of cold SBE-1 probe was added as a competitor, and 2 μl of loading dye was added to samples that were then electrophoresed in a 5% nonreducing polyacrylamide gel at 150 V for 2 h. Gels were dried for 2 h and autoradiographed overnight at room temperature. The crystal structure of IL-13 is not known. According to the conventional prediction algorithm, which predicts approximately 56% accuracy, there may be four major α-helices (A, B, C, and D) in the IL-13 molecule. The secondary structure of IL-13 was predicted based on the homology with IL-4 (1.Minty A. Chalon P. Derocq J.M. Dumont X. Guillemot J.C. Kaghad M. Labit C. Leplatois P. Liauzun P. Miloux B. Minty C. Casellas P. Loison G. Lupker J. Shire D. Ferrara P. Caput D. Nature. 1993; 362: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar) and multiple alignments between human IL-4, human IL-2, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor, and growth hormone (29.Bamborough P. Duncan D. Richards W.G. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1077-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Based on these predictions, the locations of α-helices A and D were found to be at similar positions, whereas the location of α-helices B and C could not be accurately predicted in these models. The sequence homology alignment of IL-13 between species revealed that human IL-13 sequence is prominently conserved between four species (Fig. 1 A). For example, the consensus sequence shows that a total of 87 amino acid residues are highly conserved between species. It has been shown that a cluster of amino acid residues in α-helix A, B, and C of IL-4 binds to IL-4Rβ chain, whereas a functional cluster that interacts with γc is suggested to be located in helix A and D, particularly amino acids Ile-11, Asn-15, Arg-121, Tyr-124, and Ser-125 (30.Hage T. Sebald W. Reinemer P. Cell. 1999; 97: 271-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 31.Kruse N. Tony H.P. Sebald W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3237-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 32.Shanafelt A.B. Forte C.P. Kasper J.J. Sanchez-Pescador L. Wetzel M. Gundel R. Greve J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9454-9458Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Since most (approximately 70%) of the conserved and charged residues are located in predicted α-helix regions of IL-13, it is hypothesized that these residues may be essential in IL-13 binding to its receptors. Because IL-4Rβ chain and IL-13Rα′ chains are shared between IL-4R and IL-13R systems and IL-2Rγ chain does not interact with IL-13 (15.Obiri N.I. Leland P. Murata T. Debinski W. Puri R.K. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 756-764PubMed Google Scholar,23.Murata T. Taguchi J. Puri R.K. Blood. 1998; 91: 3884-3891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was predicted that amino acids in helix D interact with IL-13Rα′ chain. We further hypothesized that 1) hydrophilic residues (with acidic or basic side chains) are usually exposed at the surface of a protein that might be expected to be involved in receptor binding and 2) highly conserved residues between species might be important for IL-13 to be an IL-13. Based on these hypotheses and the fact that the residue R112 of human IL-13 is hydrophilic and positive charge at this position is conserved between three species, we decided to mutate this amino acid and test the biological activities (Fig.1 B). WtIL-13 and IL-13R112D were expressed and purified in an identical manner. As shown in Fig. 2 (lanes 1 and 2 in A and B), isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induced protein expression very efficiently. Purification of proteins from inclusion bodies revealed a major band of 13 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 3 ofA and B). Upon purification on cation exchange chromatography, a highly purified protein (>95% pure) was obtained. (Fig. 2, lane 4 of A and B). Thus, one-step purification provided highly purified proteins. One liter of each bacterial culture yielded several milligram of each type of pure proteins. To confirm the identity, the protein was shown to react with anti-human IL-13 antibodies on Western blot analysis (results not shown). In some purifications, we also observed a minor 26-kDa protein in SDS-gel that is regarded as dimerized IL-13R112D or wtIL-13 (results not shown). After purification of wtIL-13 and IL-13R112D, the goal was to compare their biological activities on various cell types that express different types of IL-13R. First we tested their mitogenic activity. wtIL-13 has been shown to induce proliferation of TF-1 human erythroleukemia cell line (26.Debinski W. Obiri N.I. Pastan I. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16775-16780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 33.Kitamura T. Tojo A. Kuwaki T. Chiba S. Miyazono K. Urabe A. Takaku F. Blood. 1989; 73: 375-380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We tested the proliferative activity of IL-13R112D on TF-1 cell line. As shown in Fig.3 A, proliferative activity of IL-13R112D was more than 10 times better than induced by wtIL-13. The concentration of wtIL-13 that produced half-maximal proliferation (ED50) was about 2 ng/ml compared with less than 0.2 ng/ml for IL-13R112D. Similarly, IL-13R112D stimulated mouse plasmacytoma cell line B9 much stronger than wtIL-13. IL-13R112D was 5.7–19-fold better than wtIL-13 in proliferation assays. Thus, proliferation activity of IL-13R112D on hematopoietic cells that express type III IL-13R is about one log greater than wtIL-13. Since IL-13 has been shown to down-regulate CD14 expression on monocytes (4.Cosentino G. Soprana E. Thienes C.P. Siccardi A.G. Viale G. Vercelli D. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3145-3151PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether IL-13R112D mutant has stronger activity compared with wtIL-13. As shown in Fig.4, IL-13R112D and wtIL-13 suppressed CD14 expression on monocytes in a dose-dependent manner. IL-13R112D was 10 times superior to wtIL-13 in down-regulation of CD14. For example, 1 ng/ml IL-13R112D induced down-regulation of CD14, which was similar to that induced by 10 ng/ml wtIL-13. IL-13 has been shown to phosphorylate and activate STAT6 protein for signal transduction in various cell types (21.Murata T. Obiri N.I. Puri R.K. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 70: 230-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 23.Murata T. Taguchi J. Puri R.K. Blood. 1998; 91: 3884-3891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Murata T. Noguchi P.D. Puri R.K. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2972-2978PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Murata T. Husain S.R. Mohri H. Puri R.K. Int. Immunol. 1998; 10: 1103-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared the strength of wtIL-13 and IL-13R112D in the stimulation of STAT6 in monocytic cell line THP-1, primary monocytes, and EBV-immortalized B cell line, which express type III IL-13R (13.Murata T. Obiri N.I. Debinski W. Puri R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar,14.Murata T. Obiri N.I. Puri R.K. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 1: 551-557PubMed Google Scholar). The cytokine concentration at which IL-13R112D and wtIL-13 stimulated maximal activation of STAT6 in primary monocytes (Fig.5 A) or EBV-immortalized B cells (Fig. 5 C) were 10 ng/ml and 50 ng/ml, respectively. However, one-tenth of IL-13R112D could easily stimulate STAT6 in THP-1 cells as compared with wtIL-13 (Fig. 5 B). These studies demonstrate that IL-13R112D has approximately 5–10 times better activities than wtIL-13 on human monocytic cells and B lymphocytic cells. The activity of the IL-13 mutant to compete for [125I]IL-13 and [125I]IL-4 binding was next tested in PM-RCC cells, which express type I IL-13R. The concentration of IL-13R112D that inhibited [125I]IL-13 binding by 50% (ED50) was 150 pm as compared with 650 pm by wtIL-13 (Fig.6 A). Similar results were obtained in another solid tumor cell line (U251) (data not shown). On the other hand, the ED50 of wtIL-13 and IL-13R112D to replace [125I]IL-4 binding was 800 pm and 100 pm, respectively (Fig. 6 B). Thus, IL-13R112D interacted with higher affinity with IL-4R and IL-13R than wtIL-13. We previously demonstrated that IL-13 toxin (IL-13-PE38QQR) is specifically highly cytotoxic to the PM-RCC cell line (10.Puri R.K. Leland P. Obiri N.I. Husain S.R. Kreitman R.J. Haas G.P. Pastan I. Debinski W. Blood. 1996; 87: 4333-4339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the superiority of IL-13R112D over wtIL-13, we compared the activity of wtIL-13 and IL-13R112D as it displaced cytotoxicity mediated by IL-13-PE38 in PM-RCC cells. As shown in Fig.7 A, IL-13R112D appeared to be better than wtIL-13 in blocking the cytotoxicity of IL-13-PE38. IL-13-PE38 was highly cytotoxic to these cells with a concentration that inhibited protein synthesis by 50% (IC50) was less than 0.1 ng/ml. In the presence of 2 μg/ml wtIL-13, the IC50 increased to 60 ng/ml, whereas in the presence of IL-13R112D, the IC50 reached to 105 ng/ml. To carefully determine the extent of superiority of IL-13R112D in blocking cytotoxicity of IL-13-PE38, we used varying concentrations of cytokines in the presence of a fixed concentration of IL-13-PE38 (Fig. 7 B). In this assay, IL-13R112D appeared to be approximately 10 times better than wtIL-13 in blocking the cytotoxicity (Fig. 7 B). IL-13 is a central mediator of asthma and may play a major role in cancer biology, because a variety of solid tumor cells express abundant numbers of receptors for IL-13 (3.Wills-Karp M. Luyimbazi J.

We hypothesize that elimination of IL-13R-expressing cells may provide therapeutic benefit for disease processes where IL-13 and IL-13R are involved. To achieve that goal, we produced a IL-13 cytotoxin that eliminated IL-13R-expressing cells, but this molecule had 10-times lower binding affinity to IL-13R than wtIL-13 (10.Puri R.K. Leland P. Obiri N.I. Husain S.R. Kreitman R.J. Haas G.P. Pastan I. Debinski W. Blood. 1996; 87: 4333-4339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To improve the binding affinity, in the current study we made IL-13R112D that not only bound better than wtIL-13 to IL-13R but turned out to be a IL-13 agonist with improved biological activities on various cell types that express different types of IL-13R. These results suggest that Arg-112 is involved in IL-13 binding to its receptors. Since IL-13R112D had agonistic activity in cell types that expressed type I, type II, or type III IL-13R, it could not be concluded whether this amino acid residue is responsible for binding to IL-13Rα or IL-13Rα′ chains or both. Because IL-13R112D also displaced IL-4 binding more effectively than wtIL-13 and since IL-13Rα′ chain but not IL-13Rα is shared with IL-4R system, it is presumed that amino acid residue Arg-112 more likely interacts with IL-13Rα′ chain. Additional studies are ongoing to determine specific interaction with different receptor subunits. In conclusion, we produced a novel IL-13 agonist with improved binding affinity to IL-13R. This molecule may be useful in the study of IL-13 function, for example in the activation of potent antigen-presenting dendritic cells, its interaction with IL-13R and its role in inflammatory diseases, and in designing IL-13 cytotoxins with improved binding activity and cytotoxicity to IL-13R-expressing cells.

The Ras superfamily consists of the Ras, Rho, Rab, and Arf families, which are classified according to their sequence similarities and functions (1.Lamarche N. Hall A. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 436-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 2.Kjoller L. Hall A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 166-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). These proteins cycle between two guanine-nucleotide bound states, the GTP-bound form, which is active, and the inactive GDP-bound form. Activation occurs as a result of a change in the conformation of discrete “switch regions” in these proteins that allow them to interact with their appropriate effector proteins. The GTP/GDP-regulated proteins possess a low intrinsic activity for hydrolyzing GTP to GDP, but for efficient physiological catalysis, they associate with other proteins, which can enhance their GTPase activity further. These proteins are termed GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs),1 and they have been recognized by conserved amino acid sequence motifs that are characteristic of each family (3.Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar).The Rho subfamily of GTPases, which includes RhoA, RhoB, RhoC, RhoE, RhoG, Rac1, Rac2, Cdc42, and TC10, is involved in various aspects of cytoskeletal organization, cell polarity, and motility (4.Chant J.

Cancer. 1999; 80 Suppl 1: 25-27PubMed Google Scholar). For example, RhoA is involved in the regulation of stress fibers and focal adhesion formation (7.Chardin P. Boquet P. Modaule P. Popoff M.R.

Furthermore, all three can activate the Jun amino-terminal kinase, affect the transcription of certain target genes, and regulate the progression of the cell cycle (12.Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X.

Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Structural and biochemical studies show that all GAPs, although bearing no close overall sequence homology to each other, exert their effect either by contributing catalytic residuesin-trans, by lowering the activation energy for GTP hydrolysis, or by stabilizing the conformation of the inherent GTPases. These mechanisms are employed by 120-kDa RasGAP and the 50-kDa RhoGAP/Cdc42GAP through a highly conserved arginine “finger” catalytic motif and by similar binding topology (3.Scheffzek K.

Recently, however, the crystal structure of rna1p, the Schizosaccharomyces pombe ortholog of the mammalian GAP of Ran, revealed a completely different folding pattern that nevertheless contributed to both the catalysis and the stabilization effect on Ran (23.Hillig R.C. Renault L. Vetter I.R. Drell T., IV Wittinghofer A. Becker J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 781-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).GAPs have been identified that act preferentially on members of the Rho subfamily. It is interesting to note that two different catalytic domains have been described for GAPs acting on Cdc42. The 50-kDa Cdc42GAP was shown in various crystallographic studies to possess the conventional arginine finger that interacted closely with the Switch I domain from Cdc42 to affect catalysis. The second type of catalytic domain, albeit of unproven physiological relevance, was identified when Cdc42 forms a homodimer. In this circumstance, one molecule can act as a GAP toward the other partner, with catalysis being mediated by a conserved arginine patch in the carboxyl terminus (24.Zhang B. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25728-25733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 25.Zhang B. Zhang Y. Collins C.C. Johnson D.I. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2609-2612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).We have recently shown BNIP-2, a previously cloned Bcl-2 interacting protein, to be a putative substrate of the FGF receptor tyrosine kinase and to bind both Cdc42GAP and Cdc42 when not tyrosine-phosphorylated. Interestingly, BNIP-2 was also shown to possess a “GAP-like” activity toward Cdc42 (26.Low B.C. Lim Y.P. Lim J. Wong E.S.M. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33123-33130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This protein contains no sequence homology to the canonical catalytic domain of a GAP, but it shares a highly conserved sequence with a region in the amino-terminal, noncatalytic half of Cdc42GAP (26.Low B.C. Lim Y.P. Lim J. Wong E.S.M. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33123-33130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 27.Boyd J.M. Malstrom S. Subramanian T. Venkatesh L.K. Schaeper U. Elangovan B. D'Sa-Eipper C. Chinnadurai G. Cell. 1994; 79: 341-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). We wished to determine the sequences in BNIP-2 that were responsible for the binding to Cdc42 and for the catalysis. To do this, we used a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and molecular modeling based on both the known biochemistry and structural topology of the catalytic Cdc42GAP domains. It enabled a hypothetical model to be constructed that formed the basis for the mutational studies. Using this approach, we have found that theBNIP-2 and Cdc42GAP homology (BCH) domain contains the GAP activity in BNIP-2, but not in Cdc42GAP. Within this novel domain, there are two critical arginine residues that are important for conferring the GAP activity. This arginine patch shares reasonable similarity to those residues that mediate the homodimerization-induced GAP activity seen with Cdc42 homodimers (24.Zhang B. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25728-25733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar,25.Zhang B. Zhang Y. Collins C.C. Johnson D.I. Zheng Y. J. Biol.

Other discrete regions likely to be important for the BNIP-2 and Cdc42 interaction were also identified.DISCUSSIONWe have identified several arginines as key residues within the BNIP-2 BCH domain that are responsible for the GAP activity of the protein. This region containing the arginines bears no similarity to the arginine motifs employed by the “cradle-fold” structural topology in the RasGAP or Cdc42GAP/RhoGAP catalytic structures (3.Scheffzek K.

Although not required for the formation of dimers, this polybasic patch in Cdc42 was identified to be responsible for its GAP-like activity when homodimers are formed (24.Zhang B. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25728-25733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 25.Zhang B. Zhang Y. Collins C.C. Johnson D.I. Zheng Y. J. Biol.

Of particular interest is that in this local alignment, the Arg-238 in BNIP-2 matches the critical arginine residue that is indispensable for the homodimer-enhanced GAP activity. In those members of the Rho subfamily that fail to display GAP activity when homodimerized, i.e.RhoA and the yeast form of Cdc42 (25.Zhang B. Zhang Y. Collins C.C. Johnson D.I. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2609-2612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), this arginine is absent, as it is from the BCH domain of Cdc42GAP, which is also catalytically inactive (Fig. 2 D). Although it lacks GAP activity, the BCH domain of Cdc42GAP can still bind to Cdc42 (data not shown).Despite the varying degrees of the loss of GAP activity displayed by the R238K, R235K, and R236K mutants, BNIP-2 still retains its ability to bind Cdc42, indicating that these residues are not involved in the binding to Cdc42. The conserved arginine fingers in the GAP domains of Cdc42GAP (34.Graham D.L. Eccleston J.F. Lowe P.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 985-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) or RasGAP (18.Ahmadian M.R. Stege P. Scheffzek K. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct.

In both Cdc42GAP and RasGAPs, catalytic enhancement is likely to be the result of stabilization of the conformation most complementary to the transition state and from ground state destabilization (3.Scheffzek K.

It is most likely that the reactive “arginine patch” in BNIP-2 would confer one or more of the residues in-trans for the catalysis. In this regard, we observed that Arg-235 and Arg-238 are potent residues. The current work utilizes semiquantitative measurements to demonstrate the involvement of such arginine fingers in the BCH domain of BNIP-2. The actual relative contribution from each arginine residue or combination of arginines 235, 236, and 238 awaits a more thorough kinetic determination.In some of the most efficient phosphoryl-transferring enzymes, such as adenylate kinase and uridylate kinase (38.Abele U. Schulz G.E. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1262-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 39.Scheffzek K. Kliche W. Wiesmuller L. Reinstein J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9716-9727Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), several arginine residues are located in the active sites and they catalyze the reaction by stabilizing developing negative charges in the transition state. Although the involvement of multiple neighboring polybasic residues had not been tested in the similar arginine patches in Cdc42 and other Rho family members, it is tempting to speculate that these tandem arginine residues in BNIP-2 would provide a positive-charge interface to stabilize the negative charges that develop during the transition state of GTP hydrolysis in Cdc42. In Cdc42GAP, the Arg-305 within the classical GAP domain has been identified both structurally and biochemically as the key catalytic residue in promoting GTP hydrolysis in Cdc42. It does not account, however, for the full GAP activity. Recently, its adjacent arginine residue, Arg-306, was identified to be necessary to further augment its GAP activity (40.Leonard D.A. Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16210-16215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Similarly, the p120-RasGAP and the other RasGAP, neurofibromin NF1, both require at least the input of Arg-789 and Arg-903 (for p120-RasGAP (17.Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Wiesmuller L.

Nature. 1996; 384: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar)) or Arg-1276 and Arg-1391 (for NF1 (42.Sermon B.A. Lowe P.N. Strom M. Eccleston J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9480-9485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)) for optimal catalysis. Therefore, it appears that although the BCH domain of BNIP-2 shows no clear sequence homology to any of these molecules, it too could utilize the same means to facilitate GTP hydrolysis by Cdc42.Recently, evidence has begun accumulating that demonstrates that various GTPases are the preferred eukaryotic substrates of diverse bacterial toxins and exoenzymes (43.Aktories K. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 282-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 44.Fu Y. Galan J.E.

Chem. 1999; 274: 36369-36372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Several of these bacterial products have been shown to interfere with Rho family GTPase activity by means of chemical modifications on important residues (46.Sekine A. Fujiwara M. Narimuya M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8602-8605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47.Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar) or increasing the lifetime of the active GTP-bound form of the Rho proteins (48.Horiguchi Y. Inoue N. Masuda M. Kashimoto T. Katahira J. Sugimoto N. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11623-11626Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Recently, the amino-terminal domain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exoenzyme S was shown to activate the GTPase activity of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 (45.Goehring U.-M. Schmidt G. Pederson K.J. Aktories K. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36369-36372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). It was interesting to note that the catalytic domain on this protein had no strong sequence homology to any canonical Rho-GAPs, thus providing evidence that dissimilar primary sequences are capable of performing a similar catalytic function when folded in the appropriate conformation.Based on modeling, we attempted to identify the candidate regions for interaction between BNIP-2 and Cdc42. We observed that at least three sites on each protein are involved in interprotein binding. We showed that the region 288EYV290 on BNIP-2 together with the Switch I or Insert region of Cdc42 synergistically caused a 50% loss in binding, suggesting that they include at least three of these binding sites. These data differ from those derived from studies on the “classical” GAP domain of Cdc42GAP, in which deletion of the Switch I region on Cdc42 alone was already sufficient to markedly reduce the binding to this domain.More than 10 direct interacting partners of Cdc42 have been identified to date (Ref. 26.Low B.C. Lim Y.P. Lim J. Wong E.S.M. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33123-33130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar and references therein). It remains a major issue as to how the incoming signals determine the specificity of functional coupling between this molecule and its effectors/regulators. Recently, Li et al. (49.Li R. Debreceni B. Jia B. Gao Y. Tigyi G. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274 (27654): 29648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) utilized a mutational and chimeric approach and mapped unique regions on Cdc42 responsible for binding to three different target proteins. They showed that the Switch I and the immediate neighboring region on Cdc42 contain all the necessary determinants for PAK1 binding, whereas WASP and IQGAP1 did not bind the same sequence. Two distantly located regions on Cdc42, residues 155–184 and residues 83–120, constitute the WASP- and IQGAP1-binding regions, respectively. Furthermore, it was shown that the Rho family-unique Insert region of Cdc42 is dispensable for PAK1 and WASP binding but is required for high affinity binding by IQGAP1. Recently, solution structures for the complex of Cdc42 binding to ACK (50.Mott H.R. Owen D. Nietlispach D. Lowe P.N. Manser E. Lim L. Laue E.D. Nature. 1999; 399: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and Cdc42 binding to WASP (51.Abdul-Manan N. Aghazadeh B. Liu G.A. Majumdar A. Ouerfelli O. Siminovitch K.A. Rosen M.K. Nature. 1999; 399: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) have highlighted the involvement of unique regions within Cdc42 and the respective effectors in mediating the specificity in the binding. Our results show that the binding of BNIP-2 to Cdc42 was mainly mediated by the Switch I and the Insert region. It will be interesting to test how BNIP-2 affects the binding of other effectors to Cdc42 and to what extent this would affect cellular functions. We have recently shown that BNIP-2, when tyrosine-phosphorylated, failed to bind Cdc42 (26.Low B.C. Lim Y.P. Lim J. Wong E.S.M. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33123-33130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation could conceivably act as an additional switch to regulate the formation/dissociation of the complex.Based on our model, the BCH domain of BNIP-2 was predicted to display folding similar to that of the classical GAP domain of Cdc42GAP. Nevertheless, the refined structure is likely to be different from that of the predicted structure. As noted previously, BNIP-2 binds equally well to each form of Cdc42, whereas Cdc42GAP recognizes only the GDP or GTP-bound form of Cdc42 (26.Low B.C. Lim Y.P. Lim J. Wong E.S.M. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33123-33130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 52.Lancaster C.A. Taylor-Harris P.M. Self A.J. Brill S. van Erp H.E. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1137-1142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This difference in binding selectivity is further supported by our observations that a deletion in the Switch I region of Cdc42 caused severe loss of binding to Cdc42GAP but not to BNIP-2, suggesting that this region alone is not sufficient to confer tight binding to BNIP-2.The identification of the BCH domain as a binding domain for Cdc42 in BNIP-2 and Cdc42GAP has further implications. Whereas the BCH domain of BNIP-2 acts as a GAP, the corresponding region in Cdc42GAP does not, partly because of its lack of Arg-236 and Arg-238 (see Fig.2 D). This raises an interesting issue as to what role this region may play in the physiological function of Cdc42GAP. Most previous biochemical and functional studies involving the interaction of various GAPs with their binding partners were performed using the minimal GAP domains, and any potential regulation via the non-GAP domains would have been overlooked. We have evidence that suggests that the BCH domain is also involved in homophilic and heterophilic interactions involving BNIP-2 and Cdc42GAP. The discrete regions that mediate these interactions are different from those involved in the binding to Cdc42.2 It therefore seems likely that, because of this binding specificity, this domain will have some regulatory function.In conclusion, our present work has shown that the BCH domain of BNIP-2 define a new catalytic GAP domain that contains an arginine patch similar to that found in certain members of the Rho subfamily when they form homodimers. Although the actual mechanism of GAP catalysis by either BNIP-2 or Cdc42 has yet to be determined by x-ray or NMR structural analyses, current evidence suggests that strategically placed arginine residues may represent GAP domains in different primary sequences and tertiary structures. This notion is supported by the recent identification of the arginine finger of rna1p/RanGAP present in a novel folding structure that is mediated by leucine-rich repeats (23.Hillig R.C. Renault L. Vetter I.R. Drell T., IV Wittinghofer A. Becker J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 781-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Ras superfamily GTPase proteins act as molecular switches for signal transduction pathways to control cell growth, differentiation, and motility. The Ras superfamily consists of the Ras, Rho, Rab, and Arf families, which are classified according to their sequence similarities and functions (1.Lamarche N. Hall A. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 436-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 2.Kjoller L. Hall A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 166-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). These proteins cycle between two guanine-nucleotide bound states, the GTP-bound form, which is active, and the inactive GDP-bound form. Activation occurs as a result of a change in the conformation of discrete “switch regions” in these proteins that allow them to interact with their appropriate effector proteins. The GTP/GDP-regulated proteins possess a low intrinsic activity for hydrolyzing GTP to GDP, but for efficient physiological catalysis, they associate with other proteins, which can enhance their GTPase activity further. These proteins are termed GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs),1 and they have been recognized by conserved amino acid sequence motifs that are characteristic of each family (3.Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The Rho subfamily of GTPases, which includes RhoA, RhoB, RhoC, RhoE, RhoG, Rac1, Rac2, Cdc42, and TC10, is involved in various aspects of cytoskeletal organization"

This peptide can form a triple helix at acidic and basic pH, but is insoluble around neutral pH. The formation of a triple helix can be used to covalently oxidize the cysteine residues into a disulfide knot. Three disulfide bonds are formed between the three chains as has been found at the carboxyl-terminal end of the type III collagen triple helix. This is a new method to covalently link collagen-like peptides with a stereochemistry that occurs in nature. The peptide undergoes a reversible, cooperative triple helix ⇌ coil transition with a transition midpoint (T m) of 17 to 20 °C at acidic pH and 32 to 37 °C at basic pH. At acidic pH there was little influence of the T m on the salt concentration of the buffer. At basic pH increasing the salt concentration reduced theT m to values comparable to the stability at acidic pH. These experiments show that the tripeptide unit GER which occurs frequently in collagen sequences can form a triple helical structure in the absence of more typical collagen-like tripeptide units and that charge-charge interactions play a role in the stabilization of the triple helix of this peptide.

At present count, 19 different types of vertebrate collagens have been identified which share the defining structural element of the triple helix. The triple helical conformation consists of three left-handed polyproline II helices that twist around each other to form a right-handed superhelix (1.Brodsky B. Shah N.K. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1537-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 2.Brodsky B. Ramshaw J.A.M. Matrix Biol. 1997; 15: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Each chain is staggered by one residue relative to each other to allow hydrogen bond formation between glycine of one chain with a residue following glycine in a neighboring chain (3.Li M.H. Fan P. Brodsky B. Baum J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7377-7387Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Steric restraints necessitate that every third residue be glycine and the amino acid sequence of a collagenous domain can be represented as (G-X-Y)n, where X andY can be any residue but are frequently proline and hydroxyproline (Z), respectively. In type I collagen, 12% of the tripeptide units are G-P-Z making it the most frequently occurring tripeptide unit. G-P-Y and G-X-Z together account for 44% of the tripeptide units, while G-X-Ytripeptide units with no imino acid constitute the remaining 44%. It had been postulated that imino acids transmit significant stability to the structure of the triple helix by conformational constraint and via inter- and intrachain hydrogen bonds involving water molecules (4.Josse J.

Several methods have been used to cross-link synthetic collagen-like peptides. Initially dilysine cross-links were used (14.Roth W. Heidemann E. Biopolymers. 1980; 19: 1909-1917Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15.Fields C.G. Grabe B. Lauer J.L. Fields G.B. Anal.

More recently Goodman's group (17.Goodman M. Feng Y. Melacini G. Taulane J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5156-5157Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar) showed that Kemp's triacid is a useful cross-linker for collagen-like peptides. However, in both cases the stereochemistry of the covalently linked peptide does not coincide with the natural staggering of the three chains. Here we introduce a cysteine cross-link that is found at the carboxyl-terminal end of the triple helix of type III collagen (18.Glanville R.W. Allman H. Fietzek P.P. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1976; 357: 1663-1665PubMed Google Scholar). This cross-link allows all potential hydrogen bonds to form between the chains without creating flexible loops or strain between the chains. The cross-link stabilizes the triple helical conformation substantially and makes the triple helix ⇌ coil transition a monomolecular reaction. Electrostatic interactions between the ionizable residues have been proposed to provide additional stabilizing forces for the collagen triple helix (19.Katz E.P. David C.W.

Approximately 40% of all tripeptide units contain at least one charged residue, especially the positively charged residues lysine and arginine. These charged residues are asymmetrically distributed with glutamic acid and aspartic acid predominately in theX position and arginine and lysine most often found in theY position (21.Fietzek P.P. Kuhn K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1975; 8: 141-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 22.Salem G. Traub W. FEBS Lett. 1975; 51: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 23.Ala-Kokko L. Kontusaari S. Baldwin C. Kuivaniemi H. Prockop D.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). All the residues in the Xand Y position are partially exposed to solvent (24.Jones E.Y. Miller A. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and can form intra-chain or inter-chain interactions or interact with solvent molecules. We have tested the role of electrostatic interactions in determining the stability of the collagen triple helix by synthesizing a peptide composed of 15 repeating units of G-E-R. We chose this tripeptide unit specifically because it is the fifth most frequently occurring tripeptide sequence in collagens I, II, III, V, and XI (25.Bächinger H.P. Davis J.M. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1991; 13: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cross-linked [(GER)15GPCCG]3 is shown to adopt a pH-dependent triple helical conformation and exhibits salt dependent stability at alkaline pH. Peptides were synthesized usingN α-9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry on a Milligen/Biosearch 9050 peptide synthesizer. Cleavage and deprotection were performed in trifluoroacetic acid, thioanisole, ethanedithiol, and anisole (90:5:3:2 volume %, 12 h, room temperature) which was thoroughly degassed with nitrogen before mixing with the peptide resin to ensure that cysteine residues remained reduced after removal of the trityl protection groups. The cleaved peptide was separated from the resin by filtration through a medium sintered glass filter. The filtrate was precipitated overnight in ethyl ether at 4 °C and recovered by centrifugation for 10 min at 3,000 × g. The soft pellet was dissolved in 20 volumes of water, degassed, and lyophilized. The dried peptide was suspended in 1% trifluoroacetic acid and purified on a Vydac C-18 reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography column (22 mm × 25 cm) with a mobile phase of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and a linear 60-min gradient of 0 to 75% acetonitrile. A typical initial chromatogram yielded a major peak elution at 20% acetonitrile with 14 subsequent shoulders indicating incomplete deprotection of the 4-methoxy-2,3,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonyl group off the arginine. These peaks were pooled, re-deprotected in the same reagent for 12 h, and rechromatographed. Peptide eluting at the correct position was dissolved (2 mg/ml) in 50 mm N-ethylmorpholine acetate, pH 8.3, the cysteine residues were reduced with 50 mm dithiothreitol for 2 h at 55 °C under nitrogen, and the peptide was rechromatographed and characterized by amino acid analysis, Edman sequencing, and mass spectrometry. From a theoretical yield of 500 mg, approximately 100 mg of peptide was pure and utilized for stability studies. 100 mm buffers ranging from pH 1 to 13 were prepared using appropriate combinations of hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, sodium phosphate, and sodium hydroxide. Once the pH range of solubility was established, different buffer compositions were tried in these pH ranges and the relative amount of triple helix formation was analyzed by circular dichroism. Freshly reduced peptide was suspended in degassed 50 mm glycine, pH 8.6, at 4 °C under N2 in a Hydravoid Cabinet (air Control). Upon any exposure to oxygen, soluble peptide at this pH quickly formed a visible precipitate. This precipitate also formed in buffers around pH 5, but over a period of days rather than minutes. Disulfide bonds were formed via a multitude of strategies in an effort to optimize the yield of cross-linked association products. After triple helix formation under N2, the sample was removed from the Hydravoid cabinet, exposed to atmospheric O2, and the pH was raised to 8.5 with saturated Tris. Alternatively, attempts were made to mimic natural oxidation mechanisms with the addition freshly prepared stock solutions of reduced and oxidized glutathione in a 10:1 ratio to final concentrations ranging from 5 to 0.1 mm. Protein-disulfide isomerase purified from 15-day-old chick embryos (26.Lambert N. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1983; 213: 213-235Google Scholar) was also added to a final concentration of 0.01 to 0.10 μm in the presence of reduced and oxidized glutathione to catalyze the formation of correct disulfides. The formation of disulfide bonded trimers was monitored and the products separated by a semi-preparative Vydac C-18 column (10 mm × 25 cm). To increase resolution of oxidation reaction products, the gradient was expanded over time between 10 and 25% acetonitrile. The reaction mixtures and fractions of chromatography runs were run on 16% Tricine SDS-PAGE1 gels (Novex) and stained with 0.02% Coomassie Blue (Serva). Measurements were performed on a Jasco J500 instrument. After suspension in buffer overnight at 4 °C, the spectra of each peptide were recorded in a 100-μm cell from 260 to 180 nm also at 4 °C. The temperature of the solution was measured in the cell with a thermistor and a digital thermometer (Omega Engineering). The temperature of the circulator (Lauda, RCS20D) was raised 10 °C/h with an automatic temperature programmer (Lauda, PM350). The CD signal at 217 nm and the temperature were recorded in the X-Y mode with an HP7090A measurement plotting system. The synthetic collagen model peptide (GER)15GPCCG is able to form a pH-dependent triple helix. The CD spectrum of this peptide is typical for collagen-like structures. A triple helix is usually indicated by a positive maximum at 221 nm and a negative minimum at 198 nm. The spectra of [(GER)15GPCCG]3 shows a positive maximum at a slightly lower wavelength of 217 nm (Δε = 5m−1 cm−1 at pH 4.0; Δε = 3 m−1 cm−1 at pH 9.0) and a negative minimum at 192 nm (Δε = −33m−1 cm−1 at pH 4.0; Δε = -12 m−1 cm−1 at pH 9.0). Depending on the buffer used, the peptide was generally insoluble at pH 5.5–8.0 and soluble in aqueous solutions below and above this range. The chemical composition of the buffer as well as the pH seemed to influence the extent of triple helical formation. At pH 8.5–9.0 several buffer systems were utilized with the most stabilizing being 50 mm glycine/HCl, pH 8.6. Less stabilizing environments were Tricine, sodium borate, and sodium phosphate buffers. The formation and purification of the cross-linked species was monitored by Tricine SDS-PAGE. Fig. 1shows non-reduced [(GER)15GPCCG]3 and reduced (GER)15GPCCG. The cross-linked species migrates to a position of about 17 kDa while the reduced monomer migrates to 6 kDa. The molecular weight of the monomer calculated from the sequence is 5569.85 and was verified by mass spectroscopy. The solubility of the peptide in HCl/acetic acid/phosphate/NaOH buffers at various pH values is shown in Fig. 2. Equal amounts of peptide were dissolved in the buffer and after cooling overnight in the refrigerator the sample was spun in a table top centrifuge and the supernatant loaded under reducing conditions on a 16% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Between pH 5 and 9 no peptide was detected in the supernatant.Figure 2Solubility of [(GER)15 GPCCG]3 at various pH values.A 16% SDS-polyacrylamide gel is shown. Molecular weight markers are shown on the left and the corresponding molecular weights indicated. Equal amounts of peptide were dissolved in 100 mm buffer at the indicated pH.

The increase in thermal stability due to cross-linking is quite large (15 °C) and the T m increases with increasing pH. The sigmoidal shape of the thermal transition indicates that the peptide undergoes a cooperative unfolding (27.Heidemann E. Roth W. Adv. Polymer. Sci. 1982; 43: 143-203Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This transition is reversible with 100% refolding obtained upon a 10 °C/h decrease of the temperature and concentration independent in a concentration range from 0.3 to 3.5 mg/ml. The thermal transition is also reproducible in 50 mm glycine/HCl buffer, pH 8.6, however, with high temperature and increasing pH the sample deteriorates via base hydrolysis and disulfide exchange. The relative thermal stability of [(GER)15GPCCG]3 as a function of pH is given in Table I. At acidic pH the thermal stability of [(GER)15GPCCG]3 is marginal with a T m of 17–20 °C whereas at alkaline pH theT m rises to 32–37 °C.Table IThe dependence of the transition temperature Tm of [(GER)15GPCCG]3 on pH and solvent compositionSolventpHT m°C100 mm AcOH/PO4/NaOH1.1172.0153.0174.01910.03311.03312.03413.03250 mm Glycine/HCl8.63750 mm Tricine/HCl8.02150 mmTricine/HCl, 1 m NaCl8.02250 mmCHAPS9.03650 mm CHAPS, 1 mNaCl9.020 Open table in a new tab Ionic strength was varied from 0 to 2 m NaCl in both high and low pH environments. Triple helix formation occurs in 75 mm acetic acid pH 3.5 over the entire range of ionic strength, however, it is only able to form in 50 mmglycine, pH 8.6, at ionic strengths up to 600 mm. In salt concentrations above 600 mm the peptide becomes insoluble. Fig. 4 show the salt dependence of the triple helix formed by [(GER)15GPCCG]3 in these buffers. At pH 3.5 the T m is 21 °C without any salt and lowers slightly to 17 °C with 2 m NaCl. A more dramatic effect is seen at pH 8.6 where the thermal stability of [(GER)15GPCCG]3 decreases from 37 to 20 °C when the NaCl concentration is increased from 0 to 600 mm. The effect of urea and guanidinium hydrochloride on the formation of the triple helix of [(GER)15GPCCG]3 was studied. A triple helix was able to form in 2 m guanidinium hydrochloride but was unstable with a T m of 10 °C (data not shown). No triple helical structure could be obtained at higher concentrations of guanidinium hydrochloride or at any concentration of urea. It is well known that the presence of prolines and hydroxyprolines in the X and Y positions, respectively, serve to stabilize the triple helical structure. The present results with a substantially proline- and hydroxyproline-free peptide, however, show that imino acids are not necessary for the formation of a triple helix. We have successfully shown that (GER)15GPCCG can form a stable triple helix which indicates that charged amino acids can effectively confer the triple helical structure. It is possible that the nature of the forces which serve to stabilize the triple helix formed by [(GER)15GPCCG]3 differ from that of collagen model peptides containing a high content of imino acids which have a higher thermal stability. These studies of [(GER)15GPCCG]3 are of significance because they help clarify the nature of the minor contribution made by charged residues to the composite stability of a native collagen molecule. The ability of (GER)15GPCCG to solubilize and the stability of its triple helix varies with pH. The thermal stability of naturally occurring collagen also shows a pH dependence with the greatest stability seen when all side chains are ionized (28.Dick Y.P. Nordwig A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 117: 466-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Collagen has a basic isoelectric point with a net excess of basic over acidic residues and forms fibrils at neutral pH. (GER)15GPCCG precipitates at neutral pH and this could be a result of reciprocal cancellation of the positive and negative charges contributed by the arginine and glutamic acid. Synthetic collagen model peptides are known to trimerize in a parallel rather than an anti-parallel manner (29.Berg R.A. Olsen B.R. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5759-5763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) even though this manner of association brings together like-charge end chain repulsion. It could be that before (GER)15GPCCG could reach the free energy minimum of parallel trimerization, it either self-associated in a anti-parallel manner, end to end, or maybe in a ordered three-dimensional array. Once associated in any structure other than a triple helix, if the pH was above 7.5, disulfide bonds between any cysteine in proximity with each other will rapidly form and thus prohibit any subsequent trimerization opportunities. (GER)15GPCCG is soluble and triple helical in both an acidic and basic environment but shows more stability at high pH. The carboxyl group on the glutamic acid has a pK a of around 4.5 therefore the triple helix formed in the pH range of 1–4 consists of positively ionized glutamic acid and arginine. Although the secondary amine of arginine has strong ionization capabilities, the three carbon linker between the peptide backbone and the reactive amine undoubtedly modulates its behavior in solution. In contrast to proline, the arginine side chain has significant rotational flexibility because of the aliphatic nature of the carbon chain and does not provide stabilizing energy by steric constraints. Side chains may therefore form hydrophobic interactions between the long aliphatic side chains and hydrogen bond between the guanidine groups. At low pH self-repulsion of positive charges may be minimized in the triple helical conformation in which the side chains point outward from the central axis. At high pH ionic interactions of arginine provide some increase in stability that can be shielded by increasing salt concentrations in the buffer. Previous studies on (GERGPP)6 showed similar results (30.Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). This peptide was soluble and random coiled at pH 7.2, but was able to form a triple helix at pH 2.5 and 9.5. In a more recent study on positional preferences of ionizable residues in the G-X-Y tripeptide repeat, it was shown that Ac-(G-P-Z)3-G-E-R-(G-P-Z)4-G-G-NH2is more stable at pH 12.2 with a T m of 39.1 °C than at pH 2.7 with a T m of 37.3 °C (31.Chan V.C. Ramshaw J.A.M. Kirkpatrick A. Beck K. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31441-31446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). At neutral pH this peptide had a T m of 40.4 °C which is the highest value of the eight guest triplet combinations of oppositely charged residues. The relative position of the glutamic acid and arginine in the triplet seems also to be important in determining the stability because the peptide with the guest triplet G-E-R was 6 °C more stable that the peptide with G-R-E. The relatively small dependence of stability on pH and ionic strength support only minor contributions of salt bridges at acid and neutral pH. Such interactions become somewhat stronger at basic pH. This was also observed for charged groups in coiled-coil structures (32.Dames S.A. Kammerer R.A. Moskau D. Engel J. Alexandrescu A.T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 33.Lumb K.J. Kim P.S. Science. 1995; 268: 436-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 34.Beck K. Gambee J. Kamawal A. Bächinger H.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3767-3777Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The existence of GER tripeptide units in many collagen sequences seems to be a compromise of using charged residues that allow the triple helical conformation with the need of charged residues required in interactions between individual collagen molecules in fibrils. The formation of fibrils was shown to be much more sensitive to pH and ionic interactions than the stability of individual collagen molecules (35.Ripamonti A. Roveri N. Braga D. Hulmes D.J.S. Miller A. Timmins P.A. Biopolymers. 1980; 19: 965-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 36.Leikin S. Rau D.C. Parsegian V.A. Nat. Struc.

In the presence of denaturant and thiol initiator, the native PCI denatures by shuffling its native disulfide bonds and converts to form a mixture of scrambled PCI that consists of 9 out of a possible 14 isomers. The denaturation curve is determined by the fraction of native PCI converted to scrambled isomers under increasing concentrations of denaturant. The concentration of guanidine thiocyanate, guanidine hydrochloride, and urea required to denature 50% of the native PCI was found to be 0.7, 1.45, and 8 m, respectively. The PCI unfolding curve was constructed through the analysis of structures of scrambled isomers that were denatured under increasing concentrations of denaturant. These results reveal the existence of structurally defined unfolding intermediates and a progressive expansion of the polypeptide chain. The yield of thebeads-form isomer (Cys8–Cys12, Cys18–Cys24, and Cys27–Cys34) as a fraction of total denatured PCI was shown to be directly proportional to the strength of the denaturing condition. Furthermore, the PCI sequence was unable to fold quantitatively into a single native structure.

The measured parameter is usually a physicochemical property such as UV absorbance, fluorescence, or circular dichroism of the protein of interest (1.Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar, 2.Pace C.N. Shirley B.A. Thomson J.A. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure. IRL Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1989: 311-329Google Scholar). Whereas denaturation of a protein can be assessed by many different parameters, most conventional approaches are not able to determine the degree of unfolding of a protein in a given denatured state, the presence and concentration of intermediates, or the characteristics of the denatured state. There is growing evidence that within the ensemble of conformations that constitute the denatured states of a protein, there is a population of molecules that still possess residual structure (3.Dill K.A. Shortle D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 795-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar, 4.Neri D. Billeter M. Wider G. Wütrich K.

Fiebig K.M. Schwalbe H. Dobson C.M. Fold. Des. 1996; 1: 95-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), i.e. the denatured state does not imply a completely unfolded conformation. Characterizing the denatured state of proteins is a subject of increasing interest for the understanding of protein folding and stability (8.Shortle D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 66-74Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 9.Wüthrich K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 93-99Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 10.Shortle D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Recently, we have proposed a new methodology for studying stability toward denaturants and the unfolding pathway of disulfide-containing proteins (11.Chang J-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 69-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 12.Chang J-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 123-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This approach is based on the observation that when disulfide-containing proteins are treated with denaturants in the presence of a trace amount of a thiol initiator, proteins can reversibly shuffle their disulfide bonds, leading to a mixture of native and disulfide-scrambled species (fully oxidized species that have at least two non-native disulfide bridges) (13.Chang J-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25661-25666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The composition of this mixture depends on the type of denaturant and its concentration. The trapping of such scrambled species and its analysis by chromatographic methods permit not only an evaluation of the extent of protein denaturation by measuring the amount of native protein converted into disulfide-scrambled form, but also gives insight into the degree of unfolding of the protein through the relative composition of the different scrambled species. This novel methodology has been used to characterize the unfolding mechanism of several disulfide-containing proteins such as hirudin, tick anticoagulant peptide, RNase A (11.Chang J-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 69-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and cardiotoxin III (14.Chang J-Y. Kumar T.K.S. Yu C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6745-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and to characterize the denatured states of tick anticoagulant peptide (12.Chang J-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 123-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and insulin-like growth factor (15.Chang J-Y. Maerki W. Lai P-H. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1463-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) under different denaturant conditions. These studies demonstrate the potential of this approach for comparing the stability of disulfide-containing proteins and characterizing the extent of unfolding of the denatured proteins. The present work describes a study of the conformational stability and the unfolding pathway of the potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor (PCI),1 using disulfide-scrambling methodology. This 39-residue protein inhibitor has a central globular structure stabilized by three disulfide bridges (16.Clore G.M. Groneborn A.M. Nilges M. Ryan C.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8012-8023Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar,17.Rees D.C. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 160: 475-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). PCI was recovered from Escherichia coli by expression of a synthetic gene constructed from the sequence of the mature protein (18.Molina M.A. Avilés F.X. Querol E. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 116: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and the inhibitory determinants at the C-terminal tail were mapped by protein engineering (19.Molina M.A. Marino C. Oliva B. Avilés F.X. Querol E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21467-21472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PCI shares a peculiar disulfide-stabilized loop scaffold, known as the cystine knot or T-knot (20.Lin S.L. Nussimov R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 835-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), with other plant protease inhibitors and with animal peptidic growth factors. In particular, we have recently shown that PCI displays structural homology with epidermal growth factor, which makes this molecule an epidermal growth factor antagonist of potential interest as an antitumoral agent (21.Blanco-Aparicio C. Molina M.A. Fernández-Salas E. Frazier M.L. Mas J.M. Querol E. Avilés F.X. de Llorens R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12370-12377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22.Mas J.M. Aloy P. Martı́-Renom M.A. Oliva B. Blanco-Aparicio C. Molina M.A. de Llorens R. Querol E. Avilés F.X. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The disulfide-folding pathway of PCI, which was described in a previous work (23.Chang J-Y. Canals F. Schindler P. Querol E. Aviles F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22087-22094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resembles that of hirudin (24.Chatrenet B. Chang J-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20988-20996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or tick anticoagulant peptide (25.Chang J-Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11702-11709Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The common mechanism for the refolding of these proteins consists of the initial stage of nonspecific packing that leads to the formation of scrambled species followed by the final stage, where scrambled species reshuffle disulfide bridges and consolidate to form the native structure. Some peculiar features were observed in the case of PCI. On the one hand, a rather slow consolidation stage was observed, which may be attributed to the lower number of noncovalent interactions guiding the folding when compared with other proteins. Moreover, the refolding of PCI cannot be driven to completion even under optimized redox conditions or in the presence of protein-disulfide isomerase; some scrambled species inevitably remain in the refolding mixture. The present study of the stability and unfolding of PCI using the technique of disulfide scrambling facilitates a greater understanding of these features and readdresses the question of whether native proteins have a unique conformational state. Recombinant PCI was obtained by heterologous expression in E. coli and purified by ion-exchange chromatography on a TSK-DEAE column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), followed by reverse-phase HPLC (18.Molina M.A. Avilés F.X. Querol E. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 116: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The protein was more than 99% pure, as judged by HPLC and N-terminal sequence analysis. Urea, guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl), and guanidine thiocyanate (GdnSCN), with purities of greater than 99%, were obtained from Merck. Standard scrambled PCI refers to those forms that exist as folding intermediates along the folding pathway of the fully reduced PCI (23.Chang J-Y. Canals F. Schindler P. Querol E. Aviles F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22087-22094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These are prepared by allowing the folding to proceed in alkaline buffer without the addition of redox agent. The native PCI (0.5 mg/ml) was first reduced with dithiothreitol (30 mm) in Tris-HCl buffer (0.1m, pH 8.4) containing 6 m GdnHCl. Reduction was carried out at 23 °C for 90 min. Reduced and denatured PCI was separated from denaturant and dithiothreitol with a NAP-5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in Tris-HCl buffer (0.1m, pH 8.4). PCI was then allowed to refold in the same Tris-HCl buffer for 20 h at 23 °C at a final protein concentration of 0.25 mg/ml. Under these conditions, the end product consisted of 20% native PCI and 80% scrambled isomers that were detected in nine fractions. The HPLC profiles are shown in Fig.1, chromatogram Std. X-PCI. Native PCI (0.5 mg/ml) was dissolved in Tris-HCl buffer (0.1m, pH 8.4) or sodium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4) containing varying concentrations of 2-mercaptoethanol (0.05–0.3 mm). The incubation was carried out at 23 °C for 20 h. The end products were then quenched with equal volumes of 4% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and analyzed by HPLC. A parallel control experiment was performed with incubation of native PCI in Tris-HCl buffer without thiol agent. Native PCI (0.5 mg/ml) was dissolved in Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.4) containing 0.25 mm2-mercaptoethanol and selected concentrations of denaturants (urea, GdnHCl, and GdnSCN). The reaction was allowed to reach equilibrium and was typically performed at 23 °C for 20 h. 2-Mercaptoethanol (0.15 mm) was replenished twice at 4 and 8 h. To monitor the kinetics of unfolding, aliquots of the sample were removed at defined time intervals, quenched with 4% trifluoroacetic acid, and analyzed by HPLC. The denatured sample was subsequently acidified with an equal volume of 4% trifluoroacetic acid and stored at −20 °C. The GdnSCN-denatured samples were further purified by gel filtration (NAP-5 columns) prior to HPLC analysis. The fluorescence spectrum of PCI was measured with an LS-50B spectrofluorometer (Perkin-Elmer) scanning from 300 to 450 nm, with excitation at 278 nm. PCI (0.5 mg/ml) was dissolved in Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.4) containing 0.25 mm2-mercaptoethanol and selected concentrations of denaturants (urea and GdnHCl). Denaturation of PCI was performed at 23 °C for 24 h. Each sample was then diluted 50 times with the same concentration of the denaturant to a final PCI concentration of 10 μg/ml shortly before measurement. Blank samples containing equivalent concentrations of the denaturant were also analyzed. Fluorescence intensities of the blank samples were subtracted from readings of the PCI samples. Each measurement was repeated, and fluorescence intensity was monitored at 354.5 nm (see Fig. 4). The PCI denaturation curve was constructed according to conventional formulas (1.Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar, 2.Pace C.N. Shirley B.A. Thomson J.A. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure. IRL Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1989: 311-329Google Scholar). The fraction denatured (Fd) was determined by Fd = (yn -y)/(yn - yd), where yn is the fluorescence reading of the native protein, y is the fluorescence reading of the sample, and yd is the fluorescence reading of the fully denatured protein. The native and scrambled PCI (0.5 mg/ml) were treated with selected concentrations of dithiothreitol in Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.4). The reaction was analyzed either in a time course with fixed concentrations of dithiothreitol, or at fixed time points with varying concentrations of dithiothreitol (0.2–100 mm). The reaction was quenched by mixing the sample with an equal volume of 4% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. Isolated fractions of scrambled PCI (∼20 μg) were treated with 2 μg of thermolysin (Sigma, P-1512) in 30 μl of N-ethylmorpholine/acetate buffer (50 mm, pH 6.4), or digested with 2 μg of Lys-C endopeptidase in 30 μl of ammonium bicarbonate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.9). Digestions were carried out at 37 °C for 16 h. Peptides were then isolated by HPLC and analyzed by amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry to identify the disulfide-containing peptides. The amino acid sequence of disulfide-containing peptides was analyzed by automated Edman degradation using a Perkin-Elmer Procise sequencer (model 494) equipped with an on-line phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analyzer. The molecular mass of disulfide-containing peptides was determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Perkin-Elmer, Voyager-DE STR). Denaturation of native PCI is defined by the conversion of the native structure to scrambled isomers. The denaturation curve was therefore determined by the fraction percent of native PCI converted to scrambled isomers under increasing concentrations of a selected denaturant. In contrast, unfolding describes the state of the denatured PCI and is structurally defined by the composition of scrambled isomers. The PCI unfolding curves are determined by the relative concentration of different scrambled isomers that exist along the unfolding pathway under increasing concentrations of a selected denaturant. Calculation of the yield of scrambled isomers was based on peak area integration. The data has a standard deviation of ±5%. After native PCI was incubated in buffer (pH 7.4–8.4) containing trace amounts of thiol agent, a minute fraction of the protein shuffled its native disulfide bonds and isomerized to form scrambled structures. This spontaneous reaction eventually reached a state of equilibrium with a K′ eq of 0.04 ± 0.004, which corresponds to a standard free energy change of 1.9 kcal/mol. Both 2-mercaptoethanol (0.05–0.3 mm) and reduced glutathione (0.2–1 mm) were effective as thiol initiators to “jump start” this spontaneous conversion. In the absence of thiol agent (control), the native disulfides of PCI remained stable (see Fig. 1, chromatograms A andAx15). The scrambled isomers were detectable by HPLC in nine distinct fractions (Fig. 1, chromatograms B andBx15). The compositions were indistinguishable from those observed along the folding pathway of fully reduced PCI (Fig. 1,chromatogram Std. X-PCI). These experiments were also performed with [15N]PCI, and similar results were observed. About 3–4% of scrambled isomers of [15N]PCI exist in equilibrium with the native structure under the pH range of 7.4–8.4 in the presence of thiol agent. These results therefore suggest that [15N]- and [14N]PCI possess comparable conformational stability. In both cases, about 4% of the protein was unable to form the native conformation. In the presence of denaturant and thiol initiator, native PCI was denatured to form scrambled isomers. Fig.2 displays HPLC chromatograms of PCI denatured under increasing concentrations of urea, GdnHCl, and GdnSCN. The denatured PCI was composed of at least nine scrambled isomers marked alphabetically in Fig. 2. The extent of denaturation was clearly dependent upon the strength of denaturant. The denaturation curves, calculated from the fraction percent of PCI converted to the scrambled isomers, are shown in Fig. 3. Based on the concentration that is required to achieve the same extent of PCI denaturation, GdnSCN is about 2- and 12-fold more potent than GdnHCl and urea, respectively. Indeed, urea is unable to fully denature the native PCI. Even at 8 m urea, only 44% of the native PCI was denatured. The significant difference of potency between urea and GdnHCl, while expected (1.Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar), contrasts sharply to that observed for the tick anticoagulant peptide (12.Chang J-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 123-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), where urea and GdnHCl exhibit nearly indistinguishable denaturing potency.Figure 3PCI denaturation curves. Fractions denatured is the percentage of PCI that is converted to scrambled isomers. The denaturants are GdnSCN (▪), GdnHCl (▴), and urea (●). Denaturation was carried out at 23 °C for 24 h in Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.4) containing 2-mercaptoethanol (0.25 mm) and the indicated concentration of the denaturant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PCI contains two tryptophan residues at sequence positions 22 and 28. The native and scrambled (denatured) PCI exhibit distinct fluorescence intensities. These signals were used to plot the PCI denaturation curves in the conventional manner, where the signal of the native protein and that of the denatured sample (5 mGdnHCl, representing the fully denatured structure) are required. Fig.4 displays the fluorescence spectra of native PCI and urea- and GdnHCl-denatured PCI. The fraction of PCI denatured with increasing concentrations of urea was calculated from the differential intensities monitored at 354.5 nm. The urea denaturation curve (Fig. 4, inset) was compared with that obtained from HPLC analysis of the native and scrambled species (Fig.3). The denaturation curves derived from both techniques are similar. Scrambled PCI isomers were isolated in nine fractions (Fig.2) from reverse-phase HPLC with a linear acetonitrile gradient. Two of the fractions, X-PCI-a and X-PCI-h (X refers to scrambled; a and h to fractions marked in Fig. 2), were further isolated for structural characterization. These two fractions were selected because the relative concentrations correlate with the strength of the denaturing conditions. These fractions were digested by thermolysin and Lys-C endopeptidase. Peptides were isolated by HPLC (Fig.5) and characterized by Edman sequencing and mass spectrometry to identify the peptides that contain disulfides. The results, summarized in Table I, unambiguously demonstrate that X-PCI-h contains Cys8–Cys27, Cys12–Cys18, and Cys24–Cys34 bonds and X-PCI-a adopts the disulfide pairings of Cys8–Cys12, Cys18–Cys24, and Cys27–Cys34 (the beads-form isomer) (Fig. 6). The structure of X-PCI-h was deduced from the identification of two major thermolytic peptides, h-4 and h-10 (Table I). Peptide h-10 contains Cys24–Cys34. Peptide h-4 contains two disulfides which can be either (Cys8–Cys27, Cys12–Cys18), (Cys8–Cys18, Cys12–Cys27), or (Cys8–Cys12, Cys18–Cys27). The first disulfide structure was assigned because further digestion of h-4 by Lys-C endopeptidase generates two distinct fragments, one with molecular mass of 1077 Da (1059 plus 18 because of cleavage at Lys–Thr) corresponding to residues 11–20 (Cys12–Cys18). The other structure (M r 666) is consistent with Ala–Cys and Ile–Cys–Asn–Lys linked by Cys8–Cys27. In the case of X-PCI-a, the presence of Cys18–Cys24 and Cys27–Cys34 was confirmed by the structures of thermolytic peptides a-5, a-6, and a-11 (Table I). The third disulfide, Cys8–Cys12, was found in the peptide a-1 generated by Lys-C digestion. Two minor peptides (a-7 and a-8) containing Cys27–Cys34 were also found within the Lys-C digest of X-PCI-a. This is because of nonspecific cleavage, possibly by a contaminant in thermolysin.Table IStructures of disulfide containing peptides derived from the thermolysin and Lys-C digestion of scrambled PCIPeptideSequenceSequence positionCys–CysM f found (exp.)h-2EQHADP1–6No cystine695.54 ( 695.29)h-4AC26–27Cys8 –Cys271707.93 (1707.65)ICNKPCKTHDDCSG7–20Cys12–Cys18h-5WNS28–30No cystine405.12 ( 405.16)h-7ADPICNKPCKTHDDCSG4–20Cys12 –Cys181991.45 (1992.08)AC26–27Cys8 –Cys27h-9AW21–22No cystine275.11 ( 275.13)h-10FCQ23–25Cys24–Cys341160.28 (1160.48)ARTCGPY31–37a-2EQHADP1–6No cystine695.54 ( 695.29)a-5WNS28–30No cystine405.12 ( 405.16)THDDCSG14–20Cys18–Cys241127.96 (1127.37)FCQ23–25a-6THDDCSG14–20Cys18–Cys24999.31 ( 999.31)FC23–24a-9AW21–22No cystine275.11 ( 275.13)a-11ACW26–28Cys27–Cys341142.48 (1142.47)ARTCGPY31–37a-1EQHADPICNKPCK1–13Cys8–Cys121479.91 (1479.66)a-7CWNSARTCGPYVG27–39Cys27 –Cys341410.75 (1410.58)a-8ACWNSARTCGPYVG26–39Cys27–Cys341481.61 (1481.62)a-12THDDCSGAWFCQACWNS14–39Cys18–Cys242831.71 (2832.09)ARTCGPYVGCys27 –Cys34 Open table in a new tab Figure 6Disulfide structures of the native and scrambled PCI.

Pavı́a and J-Y. Chang, unpublished data. (23.Chang J-Y. Canals F. Schindler P. Querol E. Aviles F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22087-22094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the beads-form isomer X-PCI-a could not be identified in the mixture of scrambled forms generated upon refolding of PCI in the absence of denaturants,2 presumably because of its low relative concentration under these conditions. Denatured PCI may adopt different degrees of unfolding with its structure characterized by the composition of scrambled species. The plotting of the PCI unfolding curve was based on the relative concentration among scrambled isomers of denatured PCI. The results, observed in the presence of increasing concentrations of urea, GdnHCl, and GdnSCN, are presented in Fig.7. The relative concentrations of eight scrambled PCI isoforms are shown here. These curves display two important features concerning the unfolding mechanism of PCI. 1) With low concentrations of denaturant, two species of scrambled PCI, X-PCI-f and X-PCI-h, were well populated and constitute about 28 and 26% of the total scrambled PCI, respectively. The predominance of X-PCI-f persisted along the unfolding pathway, but the concentration of X-PCI-h diminished precipitously as the strength of the denaturing condition increased. This phenomenon was observed with the three different denaturants. Under 8 m GdnHCl and 6 m GdnSCN, X-PCI-h accounted for only 4 and 5%, respectively, of the total scrambled PCI. 2) The concentration of X-PCI-a was proportional to the strength of the denaturing condition. This phenomenon was most evident with samples denatured with GdnHCl and GdnSCN. As the concentration of GdnHCl increased to 8 m, the yield of X-PCI-a as a fraction of the total denatured protein (X-PCI) increased from 5 to 33%. The same trend was found with samples denatured with GdnSCN. Between 1m and 6 m GdnSCN, the recovery of X-PCI-a increased from 6 to 32%. Aside from X-PCI-a and X-PCI-h, the concentrations of the remaining scrambled PCI remained relatively constant over the range of denaturing conditions. Reduction of the native PCI was performed at a fixed time point (20 min) with increasing concentrations of dithiothreitol (0.2–50 mm) and at a fixed concentration of dithiothreitol over a time course. Under these conditions, reduction of the three native disulfide bonds of PCI followed an “all-or-none” mechanism with little accumulation of partially reduced species (Fig.8). The rate constants for the reduction of PCI using 1 and 20 mm dithiothreitol were 0.004 and 0.037 min−1, respectively. Kinetic analysis further revealed that less than 1.5% of the native PCI was converted to the fully reduced PCI after 5 min of reduction with 1 mmdithiothreitol. By contrast, similar experiments indicate that scrambled PCI could be fully reduced by 1 mm dithiothreitol within 5 min (Fig. 8). Tris[2-carboxyethyl]phosphine is 2.5-fold less potent than dithiothreitol in reducing the disulfide bonds of native PCI, although a similar manner of reduction was observed (data not shown). The mechanism of “all-or-none” disulfide reduction has been shown in numerous single domain proteins (11.Chang J-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 69-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The dramatic difference in stability between the native and non-native (scrambled) disulfide bonds has also been demonstrated in other proteins. Unlike the native disulfide bonds that are stabilized by noncovalent interactions, non-native disulfide bonds of scrambled proteins are considerably more fragile and can be readily reduced by 0.5–1 mmdithiothreitol within 5–10 min of incubation at room temperature. This phenomenon has been shown with scrambled isomers of RNase A (26.Chang J-Y. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 268: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), hirudin, and tick anticoagulant peptide (11.Chang J-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 69-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The unfolding mechanism and conformational stability of PCI were investigated using the technique of disulfide scrambling between the native and non-native (scrambled) structures (13.Chang J-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25661-25666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Jensen E.V. Science. 1959; 130: 1319-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This method permits distinction between denaturation and unfolding and enables analysis of the extent of unfolding of the denatured protein (12.Chang J-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 123-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,15.Chang J-Y. Maerki W. Lai P-H. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1463-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The conformational stability of PCI is represented by its denaturation curves. These curves were determined by the fraction of the native PCI converted to the scrambled species under increasing concentrations of denaturants. GdnHCl and GdnSCN were shown to denature PCI quantitatively. The denaturation curves exhibit a conventional two-stage mechanism in which the phase of rapid denaturation occurs at 1–2 m GdnHCl and 0.5–1 m GdnSCN, respectively. Urea is a much weaker denaturant. Less than 50% of the native PCI was denatured with 8 m urea, and at concentrations of 0–8 m urea, the denaturation curve was close to linear. The stability of PCI can be compared with a number of disulfide-containing proteins that were analyzed by the same method. These proteins include hirudin (28.Bulychev A. Chang J-Y. J. Protein Chem. 1999; 18: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), insulin-like growth factor (15.Chang J-Y. Maerki W. Lai P-H. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1463-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), tick anticoagulant peptide (12.Chang J-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 123-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and RNase A (26.Chang J-Y. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 268: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Their stabilities are defined by the concentration of denaturants that are required to achieve 50% denaturation of the protein (TableII). Two crucial aspects of these data need to be emphasized. 1) The relative stability of these five proteins, as characterized by their ability to resist denaturation, is dependent upon the nature of denaturant. Based on the denaturation curves of GdnHCl and GdnSCN, PCI appears to possess the least stable structure because it requires the lowest concentration of GdnHCl (or GdnSCN) to reach 50% denaturation. However, the order of stability differs in the case of urea denaturation, which indicates that PCI is far more stable against this denaturant than insulin-like growth factor, tick anticoagulant peptide, and RNase A (Table II). 2) As a denaturant, GdnHCl is generally more potent than urea, although the relative potencies vary from protein to protein. For instance, GdnHCl is about 6- and 2-fold more potent than urea in denaturing PCI and RNase A, respectively. However, in the case of tick anticoagulant peptide, GdnHCl is actually less effective than urea. These discrepancies are intriguing and most likely attributed to the differential mode of action between GdnHCl and urea (1.Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar, 29.Tanford C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 121-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar, 30.Pace C.N.

Open table in a new tab This was determined by the method of disulfide scrambling between the native and scrambled isomers. The data has a standard deviation of ±5%. The denatured PCI was found to comprise at least nine scrambled isomers (Fig. 2). (PCI may adopt 14 possible scrambled species.) The unfolding pathway of PCI was determined by the composition of its scrambled isomers generated under increasing concentrations of a denaturant. There are two distinct features of the PCI unfolding pathway. One is the accumulation of X-PCI-h as an intermediate under mild denaturing conditions. As the strength of the denaturing conditions increased and unfolding progressed, the yield of X-PCI-h decreased precipitously. It is likely that X-PCI-h was stabilized by noncovalent interactions, either native or non-native, which were sensitive to denaturant. In this respect, it is relevant to mention that X-PCI-h was cross-linked by Cys8–Cys27, Cys12–Cys18, and Cys24–Cys34, none of them native disulfide bonds. Another unique feature was the increased recovery of X-PCI-a (beads-form isomer). Along the pathway of unfolding, the yield of X-PCI-a as a fraction of the total scrambled PCI increased from 5 to 32% (Fig. 7). Among the 14 possible scrambled isomers of PCI, X-PCI-a contained the smallest disulfide loops and presumably was one of the most extensively unfolded isomers. PCI is not alone in displaying this property. The predominance of beads-formscrambled isomer under strong denaturing conditions is similarly observed with the unfolding behavior of tick anticoagulant peptide (12.Chang J-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 123-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and insulin-like growth factor (15.Chang J-Y. Maerki W. Lai P-H. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1463-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For example, in the presence of 6m GdnSCN, more than 63% of the denatured tick anticoagulant peptide was found to be the beads-form isomer. In the case of insulin-like growth factor-1, the content of thebeads-form isomer also rises from 5 to 30% as the concentration of GdnSCN increases from 1–6 m. These data taken together indicate a common pathway for the unfolding of small disulfide-containing proteins that encompasses a gradual expansion and relaxation of the polypeptide conformation toward the shape of linear structure. This study also demonstrates that the sequence of PCI folds into multiple structures under physiological pH. This property was first observed during our previous folding experiments of the fully reduced PCI (23.Chang J-Y. Canals F. Schindler P. Querol E. Aviles F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22087-22094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetics and efficiency of PCI folding can be accelerated by the presence of selected redox buffers that includes reduced/oxidized glutathione and protein-disulfide isomerase (32.Chang J-Y. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, the end products of PCI folding have always been found to comprise 4–5% of scrambled isomers that are unable to convert to the native conformation even under optimized folding conditions. Our data here confirm that these non-native structures indeed exist in a state of equilibrium with the native structure. There are similar examples. The insulin-like growth factor-1 folds into two distinct disulfide isomers, one native and one scrambled, with a molar ratio of 60:40 under physiological conditions (15.Chang J-Y. Maerki W. Lai P-H. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1463-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 33.Raschdorf F. Dahinden R. Maerki W. Richter W.J. Merryweather J.P. Biomed.

The inability of PCI to refold quantitatively to the native state could be related to the fact that this protein is synthesized in vivo as a precursor protein, which has both N-terminal and C-terminal proregions (37.Villanueva J. Canals F. Prat S. Ludevid D. Querol E. Avilés F.X. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The presence of these could play a role in facilitating the in vivo folding of the protein (38.Shinde U. Inouye M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 25-29Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Whereas the mature form of PCI and insulin-like growth factor-1 may represent unique cases, the phenomenon of “one-sequence multiple structures” is probably far more common that we thought. As a matter of fact, in the view of thermodynamic considerations, one can probably speculate that no sequence will fold mathematically 100% into one single structure (native). Whether or not non-native scrambled isomers are noticeable or detectable will depend on the relative concentration of the isomer with respect to the native (predominant) species and on the sensitivity of methods available for detection. For the majority of proteins that do fold into multiple structures, the non-native species may constitute less than 0.1% of the total protein under physiological conditions. Most chromatographic systems simply do not pick up fractions that are less than 0.1–0.5% of the predominant one unless the sample is heavily overloaded. This finding with the PCI study may have far reaching implications. For instance, one of the major models (39.Brown P. Goldfarb L.G. Gajdusek D.C. Lancet. 1991; 337: 1019-1022Abstract PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 40.Jarrett J.T. Lansbury P.T.

The aggregation of monomer leads to infectivity and the formation of amyloid. The oligomerization behavior or the proteolytic turnover of many proteins (with or without disulfides) could be affected by an equilibrium between multiple structures. We thank Dr. C.

https://openalex.org/W2064000845,"The tumor necrosis factor-α-responsive region of the human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) promoter (−114 to −31) encompasses binding sites for NF-κB, CBF, AP-1, ETS, and NFAT families of transcription factors. We show both here and previously that mutation of any one of these binding sites greatly reduces tumor necrosis factor-α induction of the GM-CSF promoter. Interspersed between these elements are sequences that when mutated lead to an increase in GM-CSF promoter activity. We have previously shown that two of these repressor elements bind proteins known as cold shock domain (CSD) factors and that overexpression of CSD proteins leads to repression of GM-CSF promoter activity in fibroblasts. CSD proteins are single strand DNA- and RNA-binding proteins that contact 5′-CCTG-3′ sequences in the GM-CSF repressor elements. We show here that two newly identified repressor sequences in the proximal promoter can also bind CSD proteins. We have characterized the CSD-containing protein complexes that bind to the GM-CSF promoter and identified a novel protein related to mitochondrial single strand binding protein that forms part of one of these complexes. The four CSD-binding sites on the promoter occur in pairs on opposite strands of the DNA and appear to form an ordered array of binding elements. A similar ordered array of CSD sites are present in the promoters of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-3 genes, implying a common mechanism for negative regulation of these myeloid growth factors. The tumor necrosis factor-α-responsive region of the human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) promoter (−114 to −31) encompasses binding sites for NF-κB, CBF, AP-1, ETS, and NFAT families of transcription factors. We show both here and previously that mutation of any one of these binding sites greatly reduces tumor necrosis factor-α induction of the GM-CSF promoter. Interspersed between these elements are sequences that when mutated lead to an increase in GM-CSF promoter activity. We have previously shown that two of these repressor elements bind proteins known as cold shock domain (CSD) factors and that overexpression of CSD proteins leads to repression of GM-CSF promoter activity in fibroblasts. CSD proteins are single strand DNA- and RNA-binding proteins that contact 5′-CCTG-3′ sequences in the GM-CSF repressor elements. We show here that two newly identified repressor sequences in the proximal promoter can also bind CSD proteins. We have characterized the CSD-containing protein complexes that bind to the GM-CSF promoter and identified a novel protein related to mitochondrial single strand binding protein that forms part of one of these complexes. The four CSD-binding sites on the promoter occur in pairs on opposite strands of the DNA and appear to form an ordered array of binding elements. A similar ordered array of CSD sites are present in the promoters of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-3 genes, implying a common mechanism for negative regulation of these myeloid growth factors. granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor tumor necrosis factor cold shock domain granulocyte colony-stimulating factor interleukin chloramphenicol acetyl transferase human papillomavirus mitochondrial single strand binding protein heparin-Sepharose Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)1 is one of a family of hematopoietic growth factors that control the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of hemopoietic progenitor cells as well as the functional activation of mature cells. GM-CSF functions in particular to regulate hematopoietic cells of the myeloid lineage. GM-CSF expression is normally tightly regulated, and it is produced by a number of cell types following appropriate stimulation. These include myeloid, mesenchymal (fibroblast and endothelial cells), and lymphoid cells (1.Gasson J.C. Blood. 1991; 77: 1131-1145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Nimer S. Uchida H.

Inappropriate or constitutive expression of GM-CSF is implicated in a number of disease states, including myeloid leukemia, prostate and colorectal cancers, arthritis, and asthma (1.Gasson J.C.

Because the GM-CSF gene is primarily regulated at the level of transcription, it is important to investigate the mechanisms of repression as well as activation of this gene. Such studies are necessary to define the means by which the GM-CSF gene is maintained in a strictly silent state in the absence of stimulation and also to determine the mechanisms of rapid derepression of the gene and subsequent activation upon stimulation. This will then allow identification of defective regulatory pathways in diseases where GM-CSF disregulation is important. Numerous transcriptional activators bind to and regulate the proximal GM-CSF promoter, which can be divided into two functional domains (see Fig. 1). Domain 1 (−114 to −71) contains the CK-1 and CK-2 elements conserved in a number of cytokine genes and binds a number of transcription factors including NF-kB, Sp1, and the CD28-responsive complex (1.Gasson J.C.

The CBF, AP1, and ETS/NFAT transcription factor-binding sites have been shown to be essential for T cell receptor signaling in conjunction with the domain 1 NF-kB site (10.Jenkins F. Cockerill P.N.

In addition to the activators described above, we have identified nuclear complexes called NF-GMa, NF-GMb, and NF-GMc that bind to domain 1 of the GM-CSF promoter (13.Coles L.S. Occhiodoro F. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4276-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 14.Coles L.S. Diamond P. Occhiodoro F. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F.

A. 1988; 85: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The NF-GMa complex was found to also bind to the CK-1/CK-2 equivalent regions of the genes for two other myeloid growth factors, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and IL-3 (23.Kuczek E.S.

The GM-CSF gene is coordinately regulated with the G-CSF gene in fibroblasts (25.Demetri G.D. Griffin J.D. Blood. 1991; 78: 2791-2808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and with the IL-3 gene in T cells (2.Nimer S. Uchida H. Stem Cells. 1995; 13: 324-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), respectively, in response to certain stimuli. This complex was found to be TNF-α-inducible in fibroblasts and was implicated in G-CSF promoter activation (23.Kuczek E.S. Pell L.M. Occhiodoro F.S. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F. Molecular and Cellular Biology of Cytokines. Wiley-Liss Inc., New York1990: 63-68Google Scholar, 24.Shannon M.F. Pell L.M. Lenardo M.J. Kuczek E.S. Occhiodoro F.S. Dunn S.M. Vadas M.A. Mol. Cell.

The protein composition of this complex was not determined. In contrast, the NF-GMb/c complexes are implicated in repression. These complexes bound to two repressor sites in domain 1 that were functional in fibroblasts (3.Shannon M.F. Himes S.R. Coles L.S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 4.Shannon M.F Coles L.S. Vadas M.A. Cockerill P.N. Crit. Rev.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2311-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). NF-GMb contains two separate complexes, one containing a 42-kDa protein and the other containing a dimer of a 22-kDa protein, whereas NF-GMc represents the binding of a single 22-kDa protein. We identified these proteins as cold shock domain (CSD) proteins (4.Shannon M.F Coles L.S. Vadas M.A. Cockerill P.N. Crit. Rev.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2311-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). An interesting property of these proteins is that they bind to single-stranded DNA and in the case of the GM-CSF sites, to two repeated 5′-CCTG-3′ elements on the noncoding (−) strand of domain 1 (13.Coles L.S. Occhiodoro F. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4276-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 14.Coles L.S. Diamond P. Occhiodoro F. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2311-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). CSD factors are expressed in all cell types, and consistently we have observed NF-GMb/c complexes in all cell types examined, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells, T cells, and myeloid cells (13.Coles L.S. Occhiodoro F. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4276-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 14.Coles L.S. Diamond P. Occhiodoro F. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2311-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). 2L. S. Coles, P. Diamond and M. F. Shannon, unpublished data. CSD factors in addition to binding to single strand DNA can bind to double strand DNA and RNA. By virtue of their varied binding activities, these proteins are observed to be involved in transcriptional repression and activation and also in translational regulation (27.Wolffe A.P. Tafuri S. Ranjan M. Familari M. New Biol. 1992; 4: 290-298PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Wolffe A.P. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 29.Ladomery M. Sommerville J.

In particular CSD factors appear to play a role in the strict regulation of expression of genes involved in growth regulation and stress responses (13.Coles L.S. Occhiodoro F. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F.

Endocrnol. 1996; 10: 76-89Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of CSD protein function on hematopoietic growth factor genes is at present restricted to the GM-CSF gene, where we found that overexpression of recombinant CSD proteins led to repression of domain 1 activity (14.Coles L.S. Diamond P. Occhiodoro F. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2311-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, overexpression of CSD proteins was also shown to directly repress domain 2 in the absence of a similar arrangement of CSD-binding sites (14.Coles L.S. Diamond P. Occhiodoro F. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2311-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The reason for this repression was unknown. We now report the identification of two new CSD sites across domain 2 of the GM-CSF promoter that function as repressor elements in fibroblasts. We also define the TNF-α-responsive sequences in domain 2 and find that they flank the CSD sites. The CSD-binding sites across domains 1 and 2 form an ordered regularly spaced array of repressor elements across the entire TNF-α-responsive proximal GM-CSF promoter. We also find a similar array of CSD sites across the promoter regions of the G-CSF and IL-3 genes. We performed a detailed analysis of the protein composition of NF-GMb/c and NF-GMa complexes and find that distinct nuclear complexes bind to the different CSD sites across the GM-CSF promoter and determine that NF-GMa is also composed of CSD proteins. We propose mechanisms by which the different CSD complexes regulate growth factor promoter expression. The human GM-CSF promoter constructs pGM41 and pGM43 have previously been described and were constructed by cloning the oligonucleotides GM41 (−65 to −31) and GM43 (−114 to −31), respectively, into the pBLCAT2 reporter vector (13.Coles L.S. Occhiodoro F. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4276-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The construct pGM93 (−70 to −31) and the mutant constructs pGMm89, pGMm87, pGMm81, pGMm85, and pGMm95 were constructed by cloning respective oligonucleotides (with HindIII 5′ andBamHI 3′ ends) into pBLCAT2. Oligonucleotide sequences are shown in Fig. 1 c. The bacterial expression vector pGEXBT contains the large EcoRI fragment from the B5 λgt11 DbpB CSD cDNA expression clone (14.Coles L.S. Diamond P. Occhiodoro F. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2311-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) inserted into pGEX-4T-1 (Promega). This construct expresses a protein lacking the last 10 amino acids of DbpB CSD protein. It has previously been demonstrated that these last 10 amino acids do not affect recombinant DbpB binding to single strand DNA (37.Kolluri R. Torey T.A. Kinniburgh A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 38.Horwitz E.M. Maloney K.A. Ley T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14130-14139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 381A DNA synthesizer. Full-length oligonucleotides for retardations or cloning into reporter vectors (see Fig. 1, b and c) were purified from nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (39.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Single strand DNA probes for gel retardation assays were prepared by end-labeling coding (+) or noncoding (−) strand oligonucleotides with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase followed by gel purification. The Escherichia coli strain JM109 transformed with pGEXBT was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to produce recombinant GST-DbpB fusion protein, which was purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads as described by the manufacturer (Promega). Crude nuclear extracts were prepared from HUT78 T cells as previously reported by us for extraction of NF-GMb/CSD complexes (13.Coles L.S. Occhiodoro F. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F.

Crude HUT 78 nuclear extracts were heparin-Sepharose (HS) enriched for either NF-GMb/c or NF-GMa complexes as described previously (22.Shannon M.F. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). HS fractions enriched for NF-GMb/c (HSGMb; see Figs. 3 and 5) contained no detectable NF-GMa, and conversely fractions enriched for NF-GMa (HSGMa; see Fig. 5) were free of NF-GMb/c (13.Coles L.S.

DNA affinity chromatography was carried out as described (40.Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5889-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar) except that the ligated oligonucleotides were coupled to Affi-Gel 15 matrix (Bio-Rad) in 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5. The oligonucleotide contains the IL-3 CK-1/CK-2 region, which is homologous to the GM-CSF CK-1/CK-2 domain 1 region (24.Shannon M.F. Pell L.M. Lenardo M.J. Kuczek E.S. Occhiodoro F.S. Dunn S.M.

Of the three myeloid growth factor genes, GM-CSF, G-CSF, and IL-3, we previously found that the IL-3 region has the best affinity for NF-GMa (24.Shannon M.F. Pell L.M. Lenardo M.J. Kuczek E.S.

Specifically bound protein was eluted from the column with TM buffer containing 1m KCl and rerun on a second affinity column.

We have used site-directed mutagenesis to identify a specific residue in the rat β2 subunit that is involved in high affinity agonist binding. Tyrosine residues at positions 62 and 74 were mutated to either phenylalanine or serine and the effects on ligand binding and ion channel activation were investigated after the expression of mutant subunits with wild-type α1 and γ2 subunits in tsA201 cells or in Xenopus oocytes. None of the mutations affected [3H]Ro15–4513 binding or impaired allosteric interactions between the low affinity GABA and benzodiazepine sites. Although mutations at position 74 had little effect on [3H]muscimol binding, the Y62F mutation decreased the affinity of the high affinity [3H]muscimol binding sites by ∼6-fold, and the Y62S mutation led to a loss of detectable high affinity binding sites. After expression in oocytes, the EC50 values for both muscimol and GABA-induced activation of Y62F and Y62S receptors were increased by 2- and 6-fold compared with the wild-type.

Bateson A.N. Martin I.L. Bradley R.C. Harris R.A. International Review of Neurobiology. 35. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 51-96Google Scholar). The GABAAR carries binding sites for a number of therapeutic agents including the benzodiazepines, barbiturates, neurosteroids, some general anesthetics, and possibly also alcohol (1.Dunn S.M.J. Bateson A.N. Martin I.L. Bradley R.C. Harris R.A. International Review of Neurobiology. 35. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 51-96Google Scholar). In brain membranes, there are at least two classes of binding sites for the endogenous neurotransmitter, which differ by more than an order of magnitude in their affinity for GABA or its structural analogues (2.Olsen R.W. Bergman M.O. Van Ness P.C. Lummis S.C. Watkins A.E. Napias C. Greenlee D.V. Mol. Pharmacol. 1981; 19: 217-227PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Olsen R.W. Yang J. King R.G. Dilber A. Stauber G. Ransom R.W.

This heterogeneity in binding was originally thought to reflect the diversity of GABAAR subtypes in brain tissue. However, the presence of both classes of sites in a stable cell line expressing a specific subtype (5.Davies M. Steele J. Hadingham K.L. Whiting P.J. Dunn S.M.J. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1994; 72: 337Google Scholar) suggests that both exist in a single receptor molecule. On the basis of biochemical studies, the reasonable correlation between the concentration of agonist required to elicit ion flux and to potentiate the binding of benzodiazepine ligands suggested that the low affinity sites are important for channel gating (see Ref. 6.Sieghart W. Pharmacol. Rev. 1995; 47: 181-233PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role(s) of the high affinity binding sites in receptor function remains unclear.All members of this receptor family are believed to be pentameric complexes formed by homologous subunits assembled to form a central ion channel (7.Nayeem N. Green T.P. Martin I.L. Barnard E.A. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Recent models (see Ref. 8.Changeux J.-P. Edelstein S.J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 959-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) predict that ligand binding sites occur at subunit-subunit interfaces. This was first demonstrated in the nAChR in which the α-γ and α-δ interfaces were implicated in forming nonequivalent binding sites for d-tubocurarine (9.Pedersen S.E. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2785-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In the GABAAR, low affinity GABA sites (i.e. those that have been implicated in channel activation) are thought to be located at the interfaces between the β and α subunits (10.Smith G.B. Olsen R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20380-20387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Amin J. Weiss D.S. Nature. 1993; 366: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 12.Sigel E. Baur R.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4847-4854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the benzodiazepine binding site is predicted to occur at the homologous α-γ interface (14.Duncalfe L.L. Carpenter M.R.

Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). More detailed analyses of the properties of these sites have led to a “loop model” of ligand binding sites (see Ref. 20.Smith G.B. Olsen R.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 162-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) in which amino acid residues from at least three discontinuous regions (denoted “loops” A-C) of one subunit together with residues from at least one region of the adjacent subunit (“loop” D) form the binding pocket (see Fig. 1 A).In the GABAAR, evidence for the location of the high affinity agonist site(s) is derived from a number of experimental approaches. Photoaffinity labeling studies first suggested that the β subunit is a major determinant of high affinity binding, because this was the principle site of photoincorporation of [3H]muscimol (21.Deng L. Ransom R.W. Olsen R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1986; 138: 1308-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 22.Casalotti S.O. Stephenson F.A. Barnard E.A. J. Biol.

Comm. 1988; 153: 1006-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), although another report has given some indication that the α subunit can also be labeled (10.Smith G.B. Olsen R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20380-20387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heterologous expression of different GABAAR subunit combinations indicates that coexpression of α and β subunits is required for high affinity binding, and the α1β3, α1β3γ2, α1β2, and α1β2γ2 combinations have all been shown to form high affinity binding sites for [3H]muscimol (24.Zezula J. Slany A. Sieghart W. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 301: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar,25.Pregenzer J.F. Im W.B. Carter D.B. Thomsen D.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 801-806PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of a tandem construct in which the C terminus of α6 was covalently linked to the N terminus of the β2 subunit produced high affinity binding sites (26.Im W.B. Pregenzer J.F. Binder J.A. Dillon G.H. Alberts G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26063-26066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), although the receptors were nonfunctional.Based on the above observations and homology considerations, we speculated that a high affinity agonist site in the GABAAR may be located at the α-β subunit interface, in which the β subunit would contribute residues in loop D according to the model described above (see Fig. 1 A). Candidate tyrosine residues (at positions 62 and 74) of the β2 subunit were identified by amino acid sequence alignment (Fig.1 B) based on previous work that residues in the homologous positions to Tyr-62 in the α and γ subunits have been implicated in (low affinity) GABA and benzodiazepine binding, respectively (10.Smith G.B. Olsen R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20380-20387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Sigel E. Baur R. Kellenberger S. Malherbe P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2017-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 18.Buhr A. Schaerer M.T. Sigel E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 676-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Both tyrosine residues were mutated to phenylalanine and to serine to evaluate the relative contributions of the aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups of these tyrosine residues to high affinity muscimol binding.In this report, we demonstrate that Tyr-62 of the β subunit is an important determinant of high affinity muscimol binding. Substitution of phenylalanine at this position decreased the affinity for both mucimol and GABA, whereas substitution by serine led to a loss of detectable high affinity binding sites. In functional assays, both mutations increased the EC50 for channel activation. These results suggest that Tyr-62 of the β subunit is an important determinant for high affinity agonist binding and that although this residue may play some role in receptor activation, high affinity binding per se is not a requirement for channel gating.DISCUSSIONThe elucidation of the mechanisms underlying GABAAR function is important for the understanding of inhibitory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. The aim of the present study was to identify residues within a specific domain of the β2 subunit of the GABAAR that contribute to high affinity muscimol binding and to define, in part, potential roles of this site in receptor function. Although the subunit stoichiometry of native receptors is unknown, most recent evidence indicates that the recombinant α1β2γ2 GABAAR contains 2α, 2β, and 1γ subunits (39.Farrar S.J. Whiting P.J. Bonnert T.P. McKernan R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10100-10104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 40.Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Chang Y. Wang R. Barot S. Weiss D.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5415-5424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One likely arrangement of these subunits within the pentamer has been suggested to be α-β-α-γ-β (40.Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,42.Sigel E. Buhr A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 425-429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). This arrangement (see Fig. 1 A) provides one α-γ interface where the benzodiazepine site is thought to be located and two β-α interfaces, each of which may carry a low affinity agonist site (11.Amin J. Weiss D.S. Nature. 1993; 366: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 12.Sigel E. Baur R. Kellenberger S. Malherbe P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2017-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The presence of two low affinity sites would be consistent with a Hill coefficient of ∼2 for channel activation (43.Macdonald R.L. Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 569-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1780) Google Scholar). This leaves two additional interfaces (α-β and γ-β), which could potentially form high affinity muscimol/GABA sites. According to the popular loop model (see Introduction), loop D contributing to these sites would be found in the N-terminal domain of the β2 subunit. Previous work has shown that residues within this domain of the γ and α subunits are determinants of benzodiazepine (17.Buhr A. Baur R. Malherbe P. Sigel E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 1080-1084PubMed Google Scholar) and low affinity GABA (10.Smith G.B. Olsen R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20380-20387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Sigel E. Baur R. Kellenberger S. Malherbe P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2017-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) binding, respectively. This provided the rationale for targeting homologous residues in the β2 subunit (Tyr-62 and Tyr-74) to investigate their role in high affinity muscimol binding.The major finding reported here is that Tyr-62 of the β2 subunit is a determinant of high affinity agonist binding. Its substitution by phenylalanine reduced the affinity for both muscimol and GABA (6-fold), whereas its substitution by serine resulted in a dramatic reduction in affinity (>30-fold) such that no high affinity binding was measurable in this mutant. However, receptors containing the Y62S mutation were still functional, albeit with an increased EC50 for channel activation by about 6-fold. Thus high affinity agonist binding does not appear to be obligatory for receptor activation.In a previous study, Sigel et al. (12.Sigel E. Baur R. Kellenberger S. Malherbe P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2017-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) also mutated residue Tyr-62 of the β2 subunit. Although these authors did not investigate receptor binding properties, they found that the Y62L mutation reduced the maximum current elicited by GABA by ∼5-fold, leading to the conclusion that the mutation had disrupted receptor assembly. In the present study, we did not observe any reduction of the maximum current as a result of either phenylalanine or serine substitution at this position, suggesting that there were no major effects on receptor synthesis and expression.There is no general consensus as to the number of agonist binding sites on a single GABAAR (44.Hevers W. Lüddens H. Mol. Neurobiol. 1998; 18: 35-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). There is, however, abundant evidence for the presence of high affinity sites in addition to one or more classes of sites having lower affinity (see Refs. 1.Dunn S.M.J. Bateson A.N. Martin I.L. Bradley R.C. Harris R.A. International Review of Neurobiology. 35. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 51-96Google Scholar and 6.Sieghart W. Pharmacol. Rev. 1995; 47: 181-233PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that there are approximately twice as many high affinity sites for muscimol as for flunitrazepam (45.Sigel E. Barnard E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7219-7223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that there are two high affinity sites/receptor. As described above, we predict that these sites are located at the α-β and γ-β interfaces, which by their nature are nonequivalent. Although we have detected no heterogeneity in high affinity [3H]muscimol binding, the bicuculline displacement experiments (Table II) suggest that in the wild type receptor, this antagonist may discriminate between the two putative high affinity agonist sites. Although the Y62F mutation caused a significant decrease in affinity for the agonist, bicuculline binding was apparently unaltered. This result is in agreement with the previous observation that the Y62L mutation did not affect the IC50 values for functional antagonism of GABA-mediated chloride conductance by bicuculline (12.Sigel E. Baur R. Kellenberger S. Malherbe P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2017-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Conversely, neither of the Tyr-74 mutations reported here affected agonist binding, but they did alter the characteristics of [3H]muscimol displacement by bicuculline. These observations suggest that although muscimol and bicuculline compete for the same binding sites, different subsets of amino acids may be involved in the recognition of the different ligands. Alternatively, the Tyr-74 mutations may have produced changes in the conformation of the receptor, which indirectly affect the binding of bicuculline. Further complexity arises from the apparent preference of bicuculline for binding to the low affinity agonist sites (46.Möhler H Okada T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1978; 14: 256-265PubMed Google Scholar, 47.Enna S.J. Snyder S.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1977; 13: 442-453PubMed Google Scholar, 48.Olsen R.W. Snowman A.M. J. Neurochem. 1983; 41: 1653-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 49.Maksay G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 386-390PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies to explore this novel observation will be required to identify the specific residues with which bicuculline interacts.The presence of multiple agonist binding sites in the GABAA receptor raises the question of their roles in receptor function. Discrepancies between the concentrations of agonists that are required to activate the receptor and agonist affinities that are measured in equilibrium binding assays are generally thought to reflect differences in receptor conformation (i.e. between the activated and desensitized states). In this and many other studies (11.Amin J. Weiss D.S. Nature. 1993; 366: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 12.Sigel E. Baur R. Kellenberger S. Malherbe P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2017-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 13.Boileau A.J. Evers A.R. Davis A.F. Czajkowski C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4847-4854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) it has been found that micromolar concentrations of GABA and muscimol are required to open the ion channel (Fig. 6), suggesting that the sites involved in channel activation are of intrinsically low affinity, indeed lower than can be measured in direct equilibrium binding studies. In recent functional studies, we have found that the concentrations of GABA and muscimol that induce receptor desensitization are in good agreement with the lower affinity binding component measured directly. 2J. G. Newell and S. M. J. Dunn, unpublished observations. The role of the high affinity sites, however, is less clear.The Tyr-62 mutations disrupted high affinity agonist binding and also increased the EC50 values for channel activation. It is likely, therefore, that the high affinity binding sites may play a role in the efficiency of channel activation. The EC50 value is a macroscopic constant that depends on several microscopic processes, including ligand binding and channel gating (50.Colquhoun D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 924-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, difficult to discriminate among the various contributing factors on the basis of concentration-response curves alone. This is particularly true when complications arising from multiple classes of agonist sites are introduced. One possibility is that the high affinity sites are allosterically coupled to other domains intimately involved in channel activation and that their occupancy at low concentrations of agonists increases the affinity of the latter sites to enhance the efficiency of synaptic transmission. It has been theorized that two nonequivalent sites, in nAChR, provide an ideal kinetic mechanism to enhance and potentially accelerate receptor activation, which may satisfy physiological requirements for rapid activation and termination of response (51.Jackson M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2199-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).In the present study, substitution of the tyrosine residue at position 62 by serine had a more dramatic effect than the phenylalanine substitution. Although we have not made multiple amino acid substitutions at this position, the aromaticity of the residue in this position appears to be particularly important in agonist binding. As has been previously reported for agonist binding to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (52.Dougherty D.A. Stauffer D.A. Science. 1990; 250: 1558-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) and for benzodiazepine binding to the GABAAR (32.Davies M. Bateson A.N. Dunn S.M.J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2188-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), aromatic residues may be involved in a π-π stacking interaction with the ligand.Detailed analyses of structure-function relationships without knowledge of the crystal structure of the protein should be interpreted with caution (53.Ward W.H.J. Timms D. Fresht A.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 280-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As with all site-directed mutagenesis studies, the major limitation of the present study is that we cannot state with any degree of certainty that implicated residues are directly or indirectly involved in ligand binding. However, the mutations do appear to be specific for the high affinity agonist site and this study provides the first evidence for the structural basis of high affinity binding that has been noted for more than 20 years.In conclusion, we have identified residue Tyr-62 of the β2 subunit as a determinant of high affinity [3H]muscimol binding in the recombinant α1β2γ2 GABAAR. Further, we have shown that the reduction in affinity of high affinity binding site(s) does not have a large effect on receptor activation (54.Im W.B. Pregenzer J.P. Binder J.A. Alberts G.L. Im H.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It has previously been suggested that the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor carries sites of low and high affinity, and although the former are involved in channel activation, the latter may be important in mediating receptor desensitization (55.Dunn S.M.J. Conti-Tronconi B.M. Raftery M.A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2512-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). By analogy to the nAChR, the high affinity site(s) of GABAAR may fulfill the same role. Other investigators have likewise suggested that two molecules of GABA are required for activation, and two independent molecules of neurotransmitter are required for desensitization (56.Cash D.J. Subbarao K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26 (7270): 7526Google Scholar). Experiments to examine the consequences of the above mutations on the desensitization of GABAAR are currently in progress. The GABAAR1is a member of a superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels that includes the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), the glycine receptor, and the serotonin type 3 receptor (1.Dunn S.M.J. Bateson A.N. Martin I.L. Bradley R.C. Harris R.A. International Review of Neurobiology. 35. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 51-96Google Scholar). The GABAAR carries binding sites for a number of therapeutic agents including the benzodiazepines, barbiturates, neurosteroids, some general anesthetics, and possibly also alcohol (1.Dunn S.M.J. Bateson A.N. Martin I.L. Bradley R.C. Harris R.A. International Review of Neurobiology. 35. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 51-96Google Scholar). In brain membranes, there are at least two classes of binding sites for the endogenous neurotransmitter, which differ by more than an order of magnitude in their affinity for GABA or its structural analogues (2.Olsen R.W. Bergman M.O. Van Ness P.C. Lummis S.C. Watkins A.E. Napias C. Greenlee D.V. Mol. Pharmacol. 1981; 19: 217-227PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Olsen R.W. Yang J. King R.G. Dilber A. Stauber G. Ransom R.W. Life Sci. 1986; 39: 1969-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 4.Agey M.W. Dunn S.M.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4200-4208Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This heterogeneity in binding was originally thought to reflect the diversity of GABAAR subtypes in brain tissue. However, the presence of both classes of sites in a stable cell line expressing a specific subtype (5.Davies M. Steele J. Hadingham K.L. Whiting P.J. Dunn S.M.J. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1994; 72: 337Google Scholar) suggests that both exist in a single receptor molecule. On the basis of biochemical studies, the reasonable correlation between the concentration of agonist required to elicit ion flux and to potentiate the binding of benzodiazepine ligands suggested that the low affinity sites are important for channel gating (see Ref. 6.Sieghart W. Pharmacol. Rev. 1995; 47: 181-233PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role(s) of the high affinity binding sites in receptor function remains unclear. All members of this receptor family are believed to be pentameric complexes formed by homologous subunits assembled to form a central ion channel (7.Nayeem N. Green T.P. Martin I.L. Barnard E.A. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Recent models (see Ref. 8.Changeux J.-P. Edelstein S.J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 959-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) predict that ligand binding sites occur at subunit-subunit interfaces. This was first demonstrated in the nAChR in which the α-γ and α-δ interfaces were implicated in forming nonequivalent binding sites for d-tubocurarine (9.Pedersen S.E. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2785-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In the GABAAR, low affinity GABA sites (i.e. those that have been implicated in channel activation) are thought to be located at the interfaces between the β and α subunits (10.Smith G.B. Olsen R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20380-20387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Amin J. Weiss D.S. Nature. 1993; 366: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 12.Sigel E. Baur R.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4847-4854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the benzodiazepine binding site is predicted to occur at the homologous α-γ interface (14.Duncalfe L.L. Carpenter M.R.

Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). More detailed analyses of the properties of these sites have led to a “loop model” of ligand binding sites (see Ref. 20.Smith G.B. Olsen R.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 162-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) in which amino acid residues from at least three discontinuous regions (denoted “loops” A-C) of one subunit together with residues from at least one region of the adjacent subunit (“loop” D) form the binding pocket (see Fig. 1 A). In the GABAAR, evidence for the location of the high affinity agonist site(s) is derived from a number of experimental approaches. Photoaffinity labeling studies first suggested that the β subunit is a major determinant of high affinity binding, because this was the principle site of photoincorporation of [3H]muscimol (21.Deng L. Ransom R.W. Olsen R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1986; 138: 1308-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 22.Casalotti S.O. Stephenson F.A. Barnard E.A. J. Biol.

Comm. 1988; 153: 1006-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), although another report has given some indication that the α subunit can also be labeled (10.Smith G.B. Olsen R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20380-20387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heterologous expression of different GABAAR subunit combinations indicates that coexpression of α and β subunits is required for high affinity binding, and the α1β3, α1β3γ2, α1β2, and α1β2γ2 combinations have all been shown to form high affinity binding sites for [3H]muscimol (24.Zezula J. Slany A. Sieghart W. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 301: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar,25.Pregenzer J.F. Im W.B. Carter D.B. Thomsen D.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 801-806PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of a tandem construct in which the C terminus of α6 was covalently linked to the N terminus of the β2 subunit produced high affinity binding sites (26.Im W.B."

Alkaliphilic bacteria (alkaliphiles), which grow optimally in an alkaline medium, acidify the cytoplasm by Na+/H+ antiporter system and consequently exhibit ΔpH in the opposite direction to that in neutralophiles (5.Mandel K.G.

It has been suggested that a facultatively anaerobic alkaliphile BL77/1, a strain of Exiguobacterium aurantiacum, possesses a Na+-stimulated P-type ATPase in the membrane, which is expected to function as a sodium pump (20.Koyama N. Curr. Microbiol. 1999; 39: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In this study, purification and some characterization of the ATPase were attempted. The enzyme appears to consist of a single polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 100 kDa. The reconstituted vesicles of the enzyme exhibited a significant uptake of 22Na+. The enzyme is likely to be a P-type Na+-transport ATPase, which might be first identified in procaryotes (17.Dimroth P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 11-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). E. aurantiacum BL77/1 was grown aerobically at 37 °C as described previously except that 0.5 m NaCl was added to the medium (20.Koyama N. Curr. Microbiol. 1999; 39: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The cells were collected at a late logarithmic phase, and the membranes were prepared according to the procedure described previously (6.Koyama N. Nosoh Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 206-212Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21.Ohta K. Kiyomiya A. Koyama N. Nosoh Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1975; 86: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The freshly prepared membranes (about 60 mg of protein) were treated with 10 mm EDTA to remove loosely bound membrane proteins. After treatment, the membranes were suspended in 20 ml of a buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8), 200 mm KCl, and 1 mmMgCl2, and then 2.9 ml of 20 mm deoxy-BIGCHAP was added under magnetic stirring at 4 °C. To the supernatant obtained by the centrifugation for 20 min at 90,000 ×g, ammonium sulfate was added to 85% saturation. The floating precipitate was collected by centrifugation and then resolved in 0.5 ml of H2O. The sample thus obtained was applied on a Sepharose S-300 column (2 × 20 cm), which was equilibrated with a buffer (pH 8) containing 20 mm Tris, 20% ammonium sulfate, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm deoxy-BIGCHAP, and soybean lecithin (0.5 mg/ml), and then fractions of 1 ml were collected. Active fractions (14.Heise R. Müller V. Gottschalk G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 15.Smigan P. Majernik A. Polak P. Hapala I. Greksak M.

The solution was applied to a column (2 × 6 cm) of hydroxyapatite (Gigapite Biochemicals, Tokyo, Japan), which was equilibrated with a buffer containing 25 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) and 1 mmdeoxy-BIGCHAP. The column was washed with 5 ml of the same buffer, and the enzyme was eluted with a 30-ml linear gradient of 25 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 7.5) and 700 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.5). About 30 fractions of 1 ml were collected, and to each of them, 0.5 mg of soybean lecithin was immediately added. The most active fractions (24.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar, 25.Dame J.B. Scarborough G.A.

Chem. 1983; 258: 7611-7617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were combined and dialyzed against 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.5), 200 mm KCl, and 1.0 mmMgCl2 (Buffer A) for the characterization of the enzyme. The ATPase activity was assayed by the two different procedures. Routinely, the release of inorganic phosphate by the hydrolysis of ATP at 30 °C was measured as described previously (22.Koyama N. Koshiya K. Nosoh Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 199: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out in a final volume of 1 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) containing 2 mmATP, 3 mm MgCl2 and 200 mm NaCl unless otherwise stated. One enzyme unit was defined as 1 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed/min. When the activity of the fractions from hydroxyapatite chromatography was measured, the coupled enzyme assay was employed. The assay was carried out by continuously monitoring the oxidation of NADH at 340 nm with a linked enzyme system as described previously (23.Koyama N. Anaerobe. 1996; 2: 123-128Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The reaction medium contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm ATP, 3 mmMgCl2, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 mm NADH, 10 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 10 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase in a final volume of 1.5 ml. The reaction was started by the addition of 0.1 ml of sample. 0.1% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out at 10% gel concentration by the method of Laemmli (24.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Rainbow marker (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used as a molecular weight marker. Phosphorylation was conducted as described previously (20.Koyama N. Curr. Microbiol. 1999; 39: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Briefly, the purified enzyme (about 1 μg of protein) was incubated at 0 °C in a total volume of 50 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2), 100 mm KCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP (111 TBq/mmol). After 60 s, the reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid containing 1 mm sodium phosphate. The precipitated material was washed with water and then subjected to acidic lithium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (25.Dame J.B. Scarborough G.A. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2931-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) followed by autoradiography. Some precipitated materials were subjected to 0.1 mNa2CO3 at 0 °C for 5 min and to 0.25m hydroxylamine at 25 °C and pH 5.2 for 20 min, respectively, followed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Further treatment was the same as for the untreated samples. Reconstitution was carried out as described previously (20.Koyama N. Curr. Microbiol. 1999; 39: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Briefly, to 200 μl of Buffer A containing 1.6 mg of soybean lecithin, which was dissolved by sonication from a dried film deposited in the tube from an ether solution, was added 67 μl of 20 mm CHAPS. The suspension was mixed with 1 ml of the purified enzyme (about 6 μg), and then 160 mg of SM-2 Bio-Beads (Bio-Rad), which was previously washed by the procedure of Holloway (26.Holloway P.W. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 53: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar), was added. After 30–60 min of a continuous stirring at room temperature, the turbid sample was applied instantly for the assay. The assay of22Na+ transport was conducted by the same procedure described previously (20.Koyama N. Curr. Microbiol. 1999; 39: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Membrane potential was measured by using Oxonol V at excitation and emission wavelengths of 595 and 640 nm, respectively, in a final volume of 2 ml of Buffer A containing 500 μl of the reconstituted sample. Protein concentration was determined by the Lowry assay (27.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. For the recovery of Na+-stimulated ATPase activity in a soluble fraction from the membranes, it was necessary to use detergent, suggesting that the enzyme is an integral membrane protein. Several detergents, such as Triton X-100, heptyl thioglucoside, polyoxyethylene 9-lauryl ether (C12E9), decanoyl N-methylglucamide,n-nonyl-β-d-thiomaltoside, sucrose monocaprate, sodium cholate, CHAPS, BIGCHAP, and deoxy-BIGCHAP were tested for the solubilization. Among them, deoxy-BIGCHAP and CHAPS were most effective. Because CHAPS, an ionic detergent, is inadequate to the application to ion-exchange chromatography for purification, a nonionic deoxy-BIGCHAP was used for solubilization. Fig. 1 A depicts the results of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at different stages of the purification procedure. A 100-kDa polypeptide appeared as a major band, although there are still some faint bands, the number of which varied from one preparation to the next. Incubation of the purified sample with [γ-32P]ATP demonstrated the existence of phosphorylated intermediate with a molecular mass of 100 kDa by acidic gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1 B, lane 1). Treatment of the labeled samples with 0.1 m Na2CO3and 0.25 m hydroxylamine, respectively, released the radioactive phosphates (lanes 2 and 3), indicating the acylphophate intermediate (28.Hugentobler G. Heid I. Solioz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7611-7617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the purified enzyme is a P-type ATPase that consists of a single polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 100 kDa. The purified enzyme utilized ATP as the best substrate among the nucleotides tested. The rates of hydrolysis of CTP, ITP, dTTP, UTP, ADP and AMP relative to ATP were 8, 5, 5, 4, 0, and 0%, respectively. The enzyme is likely to hydrolyze only triphosphates of nucleosides. Fig. 2 depicts the effect of pH on the ATPase activity. The enzyme exhibited an optimum pH for activity at around 9. Fig. 3 depicts the concentration effect of vanadate on the ATPase activity. When vanadate concentration in the reaction medium was increased, ATPase activity was decreased sharply in the concentration range of 0.1–10 μm, and a half-maximal inhibition occurred at 3 μm, which was slightly higher than that of the membrane-bound ATPase (20.Koyama N. Curr. Microbiol. 1999; 39: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of the purified enzyme depended on NaCl concentration (Fig. 4). When measured in the presence of various concentration of NaCl, the activity was increased with increasing NaCl concentration, with near-saturation at around 100 mm. The reconstituted vesicles of enzyme exhibited a significant uptake of22Na+ when ATP was added, which was completely inhibited by gramicidin (Fig. 5). The ATP-dependent uptake of Na+ is likely to be accompanied with generation of an interior positive membrane potential, which was suggested by quenching of Oxonol V, a fluorescent dye, when NaCl was added (data not shown). Similarly to the ATPase activity, the initial rate of quenching was increased with increasing NaCl concentration (Fig. 4). The membrane potential could be dissipated by gramicidin, whereas the ATPase activity was accelerated about 3-fold by 10−7m gramicidin. Addition of LiCl, KCl, and RbCl caused essentially no quenching, suggesting that the quenching by NaCl is specific effect of Na+. These facts may indicate an electrogenic transport of Na+ by the enzyme. The result obtained in this study revealed that E. aurantiacum BL77/1 possesses a P-type Na+-transport ATPase. The growth medium of the bacterium contained approximately 0.5m Na+. When Na+ in the medium was replaced by K+, essentially no growth was observed. The bacterium exhibited Na+-dependent uptake of amino acids such as leucine and serine, 2N. Koyama, unpublished results. which suggests that Δμ̄Na+ is utilized as a driving force of active transport of the amino acids. The purified ATPase may contribute to the generation of Δμ̄Na+. Na+/K+-ATPase, a sodium pump in the plasma membrane of animal cells, is a typical P-type ATPase. In a preliminary experiment, the purified enzyme did not cross-react with an antiserum against porcine Na+/K+-ATPase. The enzyme might possess no common epitope with animal sodium pump. We are now attempting to isolate the structural gene of the enzyme for further characterization. We are grateful to Dr. Y. Hara, Tokyo Medical and Dental University School of Medicine, for a kind gift of an antiserum against porcine Na+/K+-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1985894522,"C1 inhibitor, a plasma proteinase inhibitor of the serpin superfamily involved in the regulation of complement classical pathway and intrinsic blood coagulation, has been shown to bind to several components of the extracellular matrix. These reactions may be responsible for C1 inhibitor localization in the perivascular space. In the study reported here, we have examined whether C1 inhibitor could function as a substrate for plasma (factor XIIIa) or tissue transglutaminase. We made the following observations: 1) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography showed that C1 inhibitor exposed to tissue transglutaminase (but not to factor XIIIa) incorporated the radioactive amine donor substrate [3H]putrescine in a calcium-dependent manner; 2) the maximum stoichiometry for the uptake of [3H]putrescine by C1 inhibitor was 1:1; 3) proteolytic cleavage and peptide sequencing of reduced and carboxymethylated [3H]putrescine-C1 inhibitor identified Gln453(P′9) as the single amine acceptor residue; 4) studies with125I-labeled C1 inhibitor showed that tissue transglutaminase was also able to cross-link C1 inhibitor to immobilized fibrin; and 5) C1 inhibitor cross-linked by tissue transglutaminase to immobilized fibrin had inhibitory activity against its target enzymes. Thus, tissue transglutaminase-mediated cross-linking of C1 inhibitor to fibrin or other extracellular matrix components may serve as a mechanism for covalent serpin binding and influence local regulation of the proteolytic pathways inhibited by C1 inhibitor.

Like other serpins, C1 inhibitor inhibits its target proteinases by a suicide substrate mechanism that leads to the formation of inactive and covalent bimolecular serpin-enzyme complexes (3.Patston P.A. Gettins P. Beechem J. Schapira M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8876-8882Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 4.Gettins P. Patston P.A. Schapira M.

For C1 inhibitor, these target enzymes include serine proteinases of the complement classical pathway (C1r and C1s) and the blood coagulation intrinsic pathway/plasma kallikrein-kinin system (α- and β-factor XIIa, plasma kallikrein) (7.Davis III, A.E. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 425: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Thus, reduced levels of C1 inhibitor or the presence of a mutated dysfunctional serpin (as seen in type I and type II hereditary angioedema, respectively) lead to unregulated activation of these proteolytic pathways and increased production of the vasoactive mediator bradykinin (2.Agostoni A. Cicardi M. Medicine. 1992; 71: 206-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 7.Davis III, A.E. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 425: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 8.Nussberger J.

A particularity of hereditary angioedema attacks is that they have a marked tendency to be restricted to three specific sites, which include the subcutaneous space, the gut, and the upper airway (2.Agostoni A. Cicardi M. Medicine. 1992; 71: 206-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 9.Osler W. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1888; 95: 362-367Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, localized rather than systemic unregulated activation of C1 inhibitor-dependent proteolytic pathways with subsequent site-specific augmentation of vascular permeability is likely to be a key pathophysiologic event at the origin of hereditary angioedema attacks. Moreover, the focal pattern of vascular permeability changes seen during these attacks suggests a role for local concentrations of functional C1 inhibitor. Previous studies have shown that C1 inhibitor can bind to various ligands including heparin (10.Sim R.B. Arlaud G.J. Colomb M.G. Biochim. Biophys.

However, although these reactions may provide a mechanism for C1 inhibitor localization in the perivascular space, it is likely that additional factors may also be involved. In the present study, we have examined whether C1 inhibitor could function as a substrate for plasma (factor XIIIa) or tissue transglutaminase, two enzymes that are abundant in the perivascular space where they have the ability of fortifying protein-protein interactions by catalyzing the formation of isopeptide bonds that are stable, covalent, and resistant to proteolysis (16.Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 17.Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). High purity reagents were obtained from Sigma and Bio-Rad. [1,4-3H]Putrescine dihydrochloride (25 Ci/mmol), [125I]iodine (>16 Ci/mg of iodide) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), IODO-GEN™ precoated tubes and trifluoroacetic acid (Pierce), H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (Bachem), acetonitrile hypergrade (Merck), and Ultima Gold™ scintillation liquid (Packard) were obtained from the designated suppliers. Purified C1 inhibitor, kindly provided by Behring, was chromatographed on Bio-Gel HTP (Bio-Rad) as described previously (18.Schapira M. de Agostini A. Colman R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 163: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin, guinea pig liver tissue transglutaminase, human IgG, α2-antiplasmin, thrombin and fibrinogen (Sigma), TPCK-treated trypsin (Worthington), sequencing grade chymotrypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), human C1s and plasma kallikrein (Kordia), and factor XIII (American Diagnostica) were obtained from the designated suppliers. Tissue transglutaminase was dialyzed against 100 mm Tris, pH 8.3, containing 5 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol before use. Human factor XIII was activated by human thrombin (0.5 NIH unit/mg of factor XIII) for 30 min at 37 °C; thrombin was then inhibited by adding 5 μmH-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone. Discontinuous analytical SDS-PAGE1 was carried out using vertical slab gels according to Laemmli (19.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685sCrossref PubMed Scopus (207123) Google Scholar). Samples were reduced before electrophoresis. Acrylamide concentrations were 4% in stacking gels and 7.5 or 15% in separating gels. Molecular weight standards were from Bio-Rad (broad range set for Coomassie Blue staining and kaleidoscope prestained set for autoradiography). Gels were either stained with Coomassie Blue or revealed by autoradiography. For autoradiography, [3H]putrescine-containing gels were soaked in Entensify™ (NEN Life Science Products) and dried;125I-containing gels were dried without prior treatment. Dried gels were exposed for autoradiography using X-Omat™ AR films (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −80 °C. Preparative SDS-PAGE was performed using a model 491 Prep Cell (Bio-Rad) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Acrylamide concentration was 4% in the stacking gel and 5% in the separating gel. [3H]Putrescine incorporation was carried out in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.3, containing 5 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol. C1 inhibitor, bovine serum albumin, and human IgG (1.0 μm) were incubated with tissue transglutaminase (0.1 μm) in the presence of [3H]putrescine (1.0 μm). In experiments employing α2-antiplasmin (1 μm), the ratio between tissue transglutaminase and α2-antiplasmin was 1:20. C1 inhibitor and α2-antiplasmin (1 μm) were incubated with factor XIIIa in the presence of [3H]putrescine at a factor XIIIa/serpin ratio of 1:10 and 1:30, respectively. Samples with transglutaminase alone were prepared in the same way, but acceptor proteins were absent. For control experiments, samples were supplemented with 20 mm EDTA before the addition of transglutaminase. Unless otherwise indicated, reactions were carried out for 6 h at 37 °C and then stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer or trichloroacetic acid solution. Reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE or liquid scintillation counting. Incorporation of [3H]putrescine into C1 inhibitor was performed as described above. For time course analyses, transglutamination was stopped at various times by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. For stoichiometry determination, reactions were carried out at 37 °C in the presence of a fixed concentration of [3H]putrescine (10 μm) and increasing concentrations of unlabeled putrescine. C1 inhibitor concentration was 10 μm, while tissue transglutaminase was 1.0 μm. After 6 h of incubation, reaction mixture aliquots were withdrawn, mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and submitted to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. For quantitative analysis, autoradiograms were scanned using a Personal Densitometer equipped with ImageQuant 5.0 software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Other reaction mixture aliquots were supplemented with 500 μg of bovine serum albumin in cold phosphate-buffered saline buffer and precipitated with 1 volume of cold aqueous 20% trichloroacetic acid. After vigorous mixing, these solutions were incubated overnight on ice. Trichloroacetic acid-precipitated proteins were then sedimented by centrifugation. After two washes with cold aqueous 10% trichloroacetic acid, pellets were dissolved in scintillation liquid and counted in a Packard Liquid Scintillation Analyzer 2500 TR. [3H]Putrescine-C1 inhibitor was prepared by incubating C1 inhibitor (35 μm) with tissue transglutaminase (4 μm) in the presence of [3H]putrescine (8 μm) at 37 °C. After a 3-h incubation, unlabeled putrescine (300 μm) was added, and incubation was continued for 3 h. After supplementation with guanidinium hydrochloride (final concentration 5.0 m) and dithiothreitol (final concentration 5 mm), reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Following the addition of a neutral aqueous solution of iodoacetic acid (50 mm; 0.1 (v/v)), samples were further incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and reexposed to dithiothreitol and iodoacetic acid. After extensive dialysis against ammonium hydrogen carbonate (25 mm), samples were submitted to preparative SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing the 95-kDa [3H]putrescine-C1 inhibitor complex (as assessed by 7.5% analytical SDS-PAGE and autoradiography) were pooled, extensively dialyzed against 10 mm ammonium hydrogen carbonate, and freeze-dried. The solid material was dissolved into ammonium hydrogen carbonate (0.1 m) and digested with trypsin (1:100, w/w) overnight at 37 °C or with chymotrypsin (1:100, w/w) for 2 h at 37 °C. Tryptic and chymotryptic peptides were separated on a μRPC C2/C18 reverse phase column (2.1 × 10 mm) connected to a SMART system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the solvents being 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 80% acetonitrile (solvent B), and using a linear gradient (from 0 to 100%) of solvent B. Peptides were detected at 214 nm and collected for further analysis. One-tenth volume of each fraction was mixed with scintillation liquid and counted for 3H radioactivity. Tritiated tryptic and chymotryptic peptides were characterized by Edman degradation, amino acid analysis, mass determination, and localization within the known amino acid sequence of C1 inhibitor (20.Bock S.C. Skriver K. Nielsen E. Thogersen H.C. Wiman B. Donaldson V.H. Eddy R.L. Marrinan J. Radziejewska E. Huber R. Shows T.B. Magnusson S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4292-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) at the Protein Analytical Service of the University of Berne, Switzerland. C1 inhibitor, α2-antiplasmin, plasma kallikrein, and C1s (50 μg) were radiolabeled with 125I using the IODO-GEN method (Pierce) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Specific radioactivities of iodinated proteins ranged from 3.0 to 5.0 mCi/mg. A modification of the method of Valnickova and Enghild was employed (21.Valnickova Z. Enghild J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27220-27224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Immobilized fibrin was prepared by incubating 100 μl of 500 μg/ml fibrinogen in 20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.6 (TBS buffer) with 10 μl of human thrombin (5 NIH units/ml) for 1.0 h at 37 °C in MaxiSorb™ polystyrene tubes (Nunc). The fibrin gel was then dried overnight at 45 °C in a ventilated oven. Thereafter, the tubes were blocked for 5 h at 37 °C with 1 ml of bovine serum albumin (1%) in TBS buffer and washed three times with TBS buffer containing 10 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol (buffer A). Cross-linking was performed by incubating125I-C1 inhibitor (0.2 μg) or125I-α2-antiplasmin (0.2 μg) overnight at 37 °C with increasing amount of tissue transglutaminase in 50 μl of buffer A. After four washes with 1 ml of TBS buffer containing 0.5% SDS, the tubes were counted for 125I radioactivity. For control experiments, CaCl2 in buffer A was replaced by EDTA. C1 inhibitor crossed-linked to fibrin was prepared as described above using unlabeled C1 inhibitor and 0.25 μg of tissue transglutaminase. After the last wash with TBS, 0.5% SDS, the tubes were washed three times with 1 ml of TBS buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 and three times with TBS buffer alone. Binding studies were performed using 125I-plasma kallikrein or125I-C1s in 40 μl of TBS buffer. Test tubes were incubated overnight at 37 °C, washed four times with 1 ml of TBS buffer containing 0.5% SDS and then counted for 125I radioactivity. Binding experiments were also carried out using PMSF-inactivated 125I-plasma kallikrein or125I-C1s. Inactivation of 125I-plasma kallikrein or 125I-C1s by PMSF was verified by demonstrating that radiolabeled PMSF-treated serine proteinases did not form covalent bimolecular enzyme-serpin complexes with C1 inhibitor, as assessed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The hypothesis that C1 inhibitor could function as a substrate for tissue transglutaminase or factor XIIIa was examined in experiments evaluating tissue transglutaminase-mediated and factor XIIIa-mediated incorporation of radiolabeled [3H]putrescine into this serpin. α2-Antiplasmin, a serpin that is a well characterized amine acceptor substrate (22.Tamaki T. Aoki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14767-14772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used as a positive control. Reaction mixtures resulting from serpin incubation with [3H]putrescine in the presence of each transglutaminase were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining and autoradiography. Under reducing conditions, C1 inhibitor had an apparent molecular mass of 95 kDa (Fig.1 A, lanes 1 and 5) and α2-antiplasmin of 65 kDa (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3 and7). Autoradiographic analysis showed, as expected, that tissue transglutaminase and factor XIIIa catalyzed the incorporation of [3H]putrescine into α2-antiplasmin (Fig.1 B, lanes 3 and 7). The pattern seen with C1 inhibitor was different, since incorporation of [3H]putrescine into this serpin was observed with tissue transglutaminase but not with factor XIIIa (Fig. 1 B,lanes 1 and 5). Several samples, in particular those treated with tissue transglutaminase, contained high molecular weight radioactive bands at the border between the stacking and separating gels (see, for example, Fig. 1 B,lanes 1 and 3). These bands, which were also seen, although more faintly, when tissue transglutaminase was incubated with [3H]putrescine in the absence of acceptor serpin (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and4), probably reflected the formation of homo- or heteropolymers involving tissue transglutaminase and C1 inhibitor. Additional experiments were conducted to assess the specificity of the reaction between tissue transglutaminase and C1 inhibitor (Fig.2). Consistent with the notion that tissue transglutaminase requires the presence of calcium ions for expressing catalytic activity (17.Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), EDTA completely prevented tissue transglutaminase-mediated incorporation of [3H]putrescine into C1 inhibitor (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). Moreover, exposure to [3H]putrescine and tissue transglutaminase of bovine serum albumin (Fig. 2 A,lane 4) or human IgG (Fig. 2 A,lane 5), two proteins that have not been reported to contain amine acceptor sites, was not accompanied by radioactive amine incorporation (Fig. 2 B, lanes 4and 5).Figure 2SDS-PAGE analysis (7.5%, reduced) of tissue transglutaminase-mediated [3H]putrescine incorporation into C1 inhibitor, bovine serum albumin, or human IgG.

A time course analysis of tissue transglutaminase-catalyzed [3H]putrescine incorporation into C1 inhibitor showed maximal uptake of the radioactive amine after 4–6 h of incubation at 37 °C (data not illustrated). The number of acceptor sites in C1 inhibitor was determined by experiments in which tissue transglutaminase-mediated cross-linking of [3H]putrescine to C1 inhibitor was performed under saturation conditions. These experiments were done in the presence of a constant amount of [3H]putrescine and increasing amounts of unlabeled putrescine. After 6 h of incubation at 37 °C, an aliquot of each sample was collected for SDS-PAGE analysis, while the rest of the material was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and counted for 3H radioactivity. Correction factor F, the fraction of [3H]putrescine associated with C1 inhibitor at 95 kDa was determined by densitometric analysis of SDS-PAGE autoradiograms. The stoichiometry of the reaction between amine and serpin was derived from total radioactivity measurements in trichloroacetic acid precipitates and correction factor F. As shown in Fig. 3, 1 mol of C1 inhibitor incorporated approximately 1 mol of [3H]putrescine when saturating concentrations of putrescine were used, an observation indicating that C1 inhibitor contains a single amine acceptor site. C1 inhibitor, cross-linked to [3H]putrescine by tissue transglutaminase, was reduced and carboxymethylated under denaturing conditions. Reduced and carboxymethylated [3H]putrescine-C1 inhibitor was then purified by preparative SDS-PAGE. The modified radiolabeled serpin, a single component of 95 kDa as assessed by analytical SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, was subjected to tryptic or chymotryptic digestion. Two major radioactive peptides were obtained upon reverse phase HPLC elution of the tryptic digest (Fig.4 A). These peptides were characterized by determination of the amino-terminal 5 residues (by the Edman degradation) and mass spectroscopy. The first radioactive peptide corresponded to Thr445–Ala478 of C1 inhibitor (20.Bock S.C. Skriver K. Nielsen E. Thogersen H.C. Wiman B. Donaldson V.H. Eddy R.L. Marrinan J. Radziejewska E. Huber R. Shows T.B. Magnusson S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4292-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and the second to Thr445–Arg472. Thus, the site of incorporation of [3H]putrescine was localized in the C-terminal domain of C1 inhibitor, a protein loop released from the serpin upon cleavage of the P1-P′1(Arg444-Thr445) reactive site peptide bond. Four glutamine residues (Gln452, Gln453, Gln462, and Gln463) are present in these two peptides and constitute potential sites for [3H]putrescine incorporation. The elution profile of modified C1 inhibitor chymotryptic digest displayed a single radioactive peak (Fig. 4 B), which was isolated upon rechromatography (Fig. 4 C). This peak was formed by the tripeptide X-Pro-Phe, as assessed by Edman degradation and amino acid analysis. Liquid scintillation counting of the successive degradation cycles yielded a mean value of 33,103 cpm for the first cycle, while mean values for the next two cycles were 3615 and 1552 cpm, respectively. It was concluded that X was formed by [3H]putrescine covalently bound to Gln453, since Gln453 is the only Gln in C1 inhibitor that is followed by Pro and Phe. This observation that Gln453 can function as an amine acceptor site implies that its side chain is exposed at the surface of C1 inhibitor, where it can be accessible to covalent modification. It should be mentioned that earlier studies on monoclonal autoantibodies from patients with acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency and the angioedema phenotype (23.He S Tsang S. North J. Chohan N. Sim R.B. Whaley K. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2009-2013PubMed Google Scholar) and on a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 448–459 of C1 inhibitor (24.He S. Sim R.B. Whaley K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) also supported the notion that Gln453 is located on a protein loop exposed at the surface of the serpin. Two cleavages are detectable during the early phase of C1 inhibitor proteolysis by bovine pancreatic trypsin. The first cleavage takes place at P1 and generates a major fragment (444 residues with Arg444 at the new carboxyl terminus) termed here I′ and a minor fragment (34 residues with Thr445 at the new amino terminus) (25.Harpel P.C. Cooper N.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1975; 55: 593-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 26.Patston P.A. Hauert J. Michaud M. Schapira M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The second cleavage, which takes place near the amino-terminal end of fragment Asn1–Arg444, generates a large product of about 400 residues termed here I“ and a minor component (25.Harpel P.C. Cooper N.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1975; 55: 593-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 26.Patston P.A. Hauert J. Michaud M. Schapira M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). I′ and I”, which are readily detectable by SDS-PAGE analysis of native C1 inhibitor, were also generated upon tryptic cleavage of 95-kDa [3H]putrescine-C1 inhibitor (7.5% SDS-PAGE; Fig.5 A). Autoradiographic analysis showed that the radioactive label, which migrated at the front of the gel when the acrylamide concentration in the separating gel was 7.5% (Fig. 5 B), was associated with a component having an apparent molecular mass of 3.9 kDa when the acrylamide concentration was increased to 15% (Fig. 5 C). This result provides a confirmation that the site where [3H]putrescine is cross-linked by tissue transglutaminase is located within the Thr445–Ala478 C-terminal domain of C1 inhibitor. The possibility that C1 inhibitor could be cross-linked to a lysine donor protein via a transglutaminase-mediated reaction was examined by studying the effect of various concentrations of tissue transglutaminase on 125I-C1 inhibitor or125I-α2-antiplasmin covalent binding to an immobilized fibrin film. Both 125I-C1 inhibitor and125I-α2-antiplasmin were cross-linked to immobilized fibrin by tissue transglutaminase in a calcium-dependent reaction (Fig.6). Radiolabeled serpin binding to fibrin was dependent of the concentration of tissue transglutaminase, and it was comparable for 125I-C1 inhibitor and125I-α2-antiplasmin. However, when the specific radioactivities of the two serpins were taken into account, it appeared that the amount of 125I-C1 inhibitor bound to the immobilized fibrin gel was about 4 times lower than that of125I-α2-antiplasmin. Additional experiments were designed to assess whether C1 inhibitor cross-linked to fibrin retained inhibitory activity against its target serine proteinases, as assessed by the formation of covalent and immobilized bimolecular complexes between serpins and their target serine proteinases. As shown in Table I, C1 inhibitor cross-linked to fibrin was very efficient in covalently binding catalytically active125I-plasma kallikrein or 125I-C1s. In contrast, binding of these two proteinases was dramatically decreased in experiments employing plasma kallikrein or C1s that had been inactivated by PMSF to form active site-blocked phenylmethanesulfonyl-125I-kallikrein or -C1s. Furthermore,125I-plasma kallikrein and 125I-C1s covalent binding was also nearly abolished in control experiments where tissue transglutaminase-mediated C1 inhibitor cross-linking to immobilized fibrin was prevented by EDTA, demonstrating absent direct firm attachment of these serine proteinases to a fibrin matrix.Table IBinding of radioiodinated plasma kallikrein or C1s to C1 inhibitor cross-linked to fibrinSurfaceC1 inhibitor cross-linked to fibrinControlcpm125I-Kallikrein128,930 ± 93205562 ± 2263125I-Kallikrein treated with PMSF1726 ± 318492 ± 115125I-C1s32,073 ± 53493671 ± 1917125I-C1s treated with PMSF8764 ± 25101882 ± 333Values are mean ± S.D.

Test tube surfaces were prepared by cross-linking unlabeled C1-inhibitor to fibrin film using tissue transglutaminase. Binding of active or PMSF-treated 125I-plasma kallikrein or 125I-C1s was determined after 4 h of incubation at 37 °C. For control experiments, C1 inhibitor cross-linking to fibrin was prevented by EDTA. The results of this study demonstrate that C1 inhibitor is a substrate for tissue transglutaminase and that C1 inhibitor cross-linked to a fibrin matrix retains inhibitory activity against its target serine proteinases C1s and plasma kallikrein. However, several issues need to be addressed before one can understand the full biological implication of this observation. Histochemical studies will be required to assess whether C1 inhibitor is present in a cross-linked form in certain perivascular regions and to identify the components with which this serpin might be associated. If it is observed that C1 inhibitor can be cross-linked in vivo, experiments will have to be designed to establish whether this reaction takes place as a part of matrix normal make up or as a response to some challenge such as the inflammatory reaction. In addition, the impact of being cross-linked to a lysine donor protein such as fibrin on C1 inhibitor inhibitory specificity and reactivity needs to be examined in detailed kinetic studies. The study reported here has shown that C1 inhibitor cross-linked to immobilized fibrin can inhibit C1s and plasma kallikrein; however, this study has not determined whether cross-linked C1 inhibitor is more, equally, or less efficient in inhibiting these serine proteinases than the free serpin or whether the cross-linking reaction modifies the inhibitory specificity. If cross-linked C1 inhibitor is equally active or more active than the native form against its target enzymes, this would suggest that transglutaminase-mediated cross-linking of C1 inhibitor to matrix components provides a critical mechanism for the local control of vascular permeability. Importantly, if this scenario is operative in vivo, then diminished perivascular C1 inhibitor cross-linking (e.g. because of mutation of C1 inhibitor Gln453 or altered tissue transglutaminase binding or activity) could represent a hitherto unrecognized pathophysiological mechanism in certain cases of hereditary angioedema. However, it could also be possible that cross-linked C1 inhibitor is less active against its target serine proteinases than the free serpin, i.e. that serpin transglutamination reduces and/or modifies its inhibitory activity. If that is the case, then cross-linking of C1 inhibitor to extracellular matrix components could lead to reduced inhibition of the serine proteinases of complement classical pathway and intrinsic blood coagulation/plasma kallikrein-kinin system and therefore to increased bradykinin production with subsequent increase of vascular permeability."

Previous experiments identified a nonconsensus TATA element, with the sequence TAGAAAA, as crucial for accurate and efficient transcription from the LRP-2 promoter. Here we show that, in addition to the TAGA element, promoter sequences downstream of the transcription start site contribute significantly to transcription both in vitro and in transfected cells. Deletion and point mutational analyses reveal that the promoter region located between positions +5 and +11 (sequence TTTTGGC) is of particular importance. Complementation experiments in nuclear extracts lacking transcription factor IID (TFIID) activity show that TATA-binding protein-associated factors of TFIID are essential for the function of LRP-2 downstream promoter sequences. Interestingly, DNase I footprinting studies show that the downstream region between positions +5 and +11 does not significantly affect overall TFIID affinity to the promoter but that it profoundly affects the topology of the TFIID·promoter complex not only downstream of the transcription start site, but in particular in the TATA box region. Our observations suggest a model for a novel downstream sequence function, in which TATA-binding protein-associated factor-promoter interactions downstream of the transcription start site modulate TFIID-DNA interactions in the TATA box region.

The establishment of cell-free systems, some 20 years ago, has permitted biochemical fractionation and purification of a set of six general transcription factors, denoted TFIIA,1 -B, -D, -E, -F, and -H, that, in addition to RNA polymerase II, are minimally required for low (basal) levels of accurate transcription initiation in vitro. The activity of the general transcription machineryin vivo is regulated by gene- and cell type-specific transcription activators and repressors as well as various cofactors that are thought to function as mediators between regulatory proteins and individual components of the general transcription machinery (reviewed in Refs. 1.Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar and 2.Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). A key step in the formation of functional transcription initiation complexes is the recognition of promoter sequences by components of the general transcription machinery. Indeed, it has become evident that the core promoter sequence context has a significant influence on both the overall efficiency of gene transcription and the ability of individual genes to respond to various transcription activators (1.Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 3.Verrijzer C.P. Tjian R. Trends Biochem Sci. 1996; 21: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Functional core promoter sequence elements identified to date include the TATA box, the initiator (Inr), the downstream promoter element (DPE), and the TFIIB recognition element. The best characterized core promoter elements are the TATA box, an A/T-rich sequence located about 25–30 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site that is recognized by the TATA-binding subunit of TFIID (reviewed in Ref. 4.Burley S.K. Roeder R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 769-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), and the Inr element, a pyrimidine-rich sequence with the consensus YYA+1N(T/A)YY at the start site of transcription (5.Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar, 6.Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Both TATA and Inr elements are sufficient to independently direct accurate transcription initiation in vitro but can also function in concert in a synergistic manner (see Ref. 7.Martinez E. Chiang C.M. Ge H. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3115-3126Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar and references therein). The DPE was recently identified as a sequence element in many TATA-less, Inr-containing promoters, located some 25–30 nucleotides downstream of the transcription start site with the consensus (A/G)G(A/T)CGTG (8.Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 9.Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3020-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Finally, the TFIIB recognition element was identified, by binding site selection, as a GC-rich sequence located immediately upstream of the TATA box, which can enhance both binding of TFIIB to the TBP·DNA complex and promoter activity (10.Lagrange T. Kapanidis A.N. Tang H. Reinberg D. Ebright R.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). While the functions of the TATA box and the TFIIB recognition element sequences correlate well with their relative affinities to their cognate binding proteins TBP and TFIIB (10.Lagrange T. Kapanidis A.N. Tang H. Reinberg D. Ebright R.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 11.Wobbe C.R. Struhl K. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 1996; 383: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 15.Shen W.C. Green M.R. Cell. 1997; 90: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) have established a general requirement for TAFIIs in the function of promoter regions downstream of the TATA element as well as for the transcription of TATA-less genes (7.Martinez E. Chiang C.M. Ge H. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3115-3126Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) where the TATA box-binding activity of TBP is largely dispensable (16.Martinez E. Zhou Q. L'Etoile N.D. Oelgeschläger T. Berk A.J. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11864-11868Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). More specifically, functional studies with partially reconstituted recombinantDrosophila TFIID complexes have shown a minimal requirement of TBP, TAFII250, and TAFII150 for promoter-specific downstream sequence function (13.Verrijzer C.P. Chen J.L. Yokomori K. Tjian R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1115-1125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). DNase I footprinting studies had demonstrated earlier that the human TFIID multiprotein complex, but not TBP alone, can make contact with promoter sequences downstream of the TATA element and the transcription start site of certain core promoter sequences (17.Nakajima N. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4028-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 18.Nakatani Y. Horikoshi M. Brenner M. Yamamoto T. Besnard F. Roeder R.G. Freese E.

More recently, UV cross-linking experiments have examined the relative disposition of DNA and TFIID subunits within a human TFIID·promoter complex and have identified several human and Drosophila TFIID subunits in close proximity of promoter DNA. These studies suggest thatDrosophila and human TAFII250 and TAFII150 might directly interact with the Inr element and promoter regions downstream of certain promoters (13.Verrijzer C.P. Chen J.L. Yokomori K. Tjian R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1115-1125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 20.Verrijzer C.P. Yokomori K. Chen J.L. Tjian R. Science. 1994; 264: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 21.Oelgeschläger T. Chiang C.M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1996; 382: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and that the histone-like Drosophila TFIID subunits TAFII60 and TAFII40 may contact the DPE (9.Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3020-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it has been proposed that downstream promoter elements function in part by increasing TFIID·promoter complex formation and/or stability through direct interactions with TAFIIs. Furthermore, dependent on the presence of TFIIA, TAFII interactions with downstream promoter regions may be concomitant with the formation of a stereospecific TFIID·promoter complex (21.Oelgeschläger T. Chiang C.M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1996; 382: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), consistent with a general requirement for TFIIA in core promoter- and TAFII-dependent transcription (22.Hansen S.K. Tjian R. Cell. 1995; 82: 565-575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23.Emami K.H. Jain A. Smale S.T.

Biol. 1998; 18: 6571-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Finally, a recent study has identified novel TAFII- and initiator-dependent cofactors (TICs) that are, in addition to TFIIA and TAFIIs, required for core promoter-specific functions of TFIID through the initiator region of TATA-containing and TATA-less promoters (24.Martinez E. Ge H. Tao Y. Yuan C.X. Palhan V. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6571-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that quantitative or qualitative core promoter sequence-dependent effects on TFIID promoter binding may constitute one important step for the functional readout of downstream core promoter sequence elements. We previously identified a weak, atypical TATA box (TAGAAAA) as necessary for transcription of the human megalin/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 2 (LRP-2) gene promoter (25.Knutson A. Hellman P. Akerstrom G. Westin G. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that efficient LRP-2 transcription additionally requires promoter sequences downstream of the transcription start site. Deletion and point mutation analyses indicate that stimulatory LRP-2 downstream promoter functions are conferred to a large extent by core promoter sequences located between positions +5 and +11, with no apparent sequence similarities to the Inr and DPE consensus sequences. DNase I footprinting experiments reveal that the presence of this sequence does not significantly affect the overall affinity of TFIID binding. Instead, TFIID interactions with the +5 to +11 region induce dramatic qualitative changes in TFIID interactions in the LRP-2 TATA box region, suggesting the formation of a conformationally distinct TFIID·promoter complex. A previously described fragment of the human LRP-2 promoter, containing sequences between positions −120 and +52, cloned into the pGL-3 basic vector (25.Knutson A. Hellman P. Akerstrom G. Westin G. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), was used as polymerase chain reaction template for construction of the deletion and point mutants outlined in Fig. 1 A. Deletion of the LRP-2 promoter in the −120/+11 and −120/+4 constructs replaced the wild type LRP-2 sequence+3GCTTTTGGCCACTAGGAGCTGGCGGAGG+30 with+3GCTTTTGGCGCTAGCCCGGGCTCGAGAT +30and+3GCGCTAGCCCGGGCTCGAGATCTGCGAT +30, respectively (vector sequences in boldface type; +3 and +30 refers to nucleotide positions relative to the transcription start site). To generate the −120/+52(mut4–10) construct, the wild type sequence+3GCTTTTGGC+11 was changed to GTCTCGGTC, while for construction of the −120/+11(mut5–8), the same wild type sequence was changed to GCGCTAGGC. For analysis of promoter activity in vivo by RNase protection assay, a fragment containing the SV40 enhancer was inserted downstream of the luciferase gene in some of the reporters, as outlined in the text (see Fig.1 D). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. HeLa nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Dignam et al. (26.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). HeLa nuclear extract lacking TBP and TAFIIs NE[ΔD] was prepared as described (27.Oelgeschläger T. Tao Y. Kang Y.K. Roeder R.G. Mol Cell. 1998; 1: 925-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Highly purified (Fig. 2 A) recombinant, bacterially expressed human six-histidine-tagged TBP (6His:TBP), highly purified (Fig. 2 A) FLAG epitope-tagged human TFIID (f:TFIID), and partially purified human TFIIA were prepared as described previously (19.Chiang C.M. Ge H. Wang Z. Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2749-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 21.Oelgeschläger T. Chiang C.M. Roeder R.G.

Mol Cell. 1998; 1: 925-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The TBP content of f:TFIID was determined by quantitative immunoblot analysis. JEG-3 cells were maintained and transfected as described previously (25.Knutson A. Hellman P. Akerstrom G. Westin G. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For luminometric determination of promoter activity, cells were transfected in 60-mm plates with 5 μg of luciferase reporter and 1 μg of CMV-LacZ in 10 μg of total DNA. Cells were harvested 36 h post-transfection, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined luminometrically. For analysis of RNA, cells were transfected in 90-mm plates, with 10 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid/SV40, 100 ng of OVEC-REF (28.Westin G. Gerster T. Muller M.M. Schaffner G. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 6787-6798Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and calf thymus DNA to 18 μg total per plate. RNA was isolated 36 h after transfection, by the Nonidet P-40 lysis method (29.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.12-7.15Google Scholar). RNase protection analysis was performed as described (30.Forsberg M. Westin G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2543-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), utilizing probes specific for the RNAs derived from the different mutant promoters. Products were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. Numbers were normalized for differences in product content of the radiolabeled ribonucleotide ([32P]UTP) and for differences in transfection efficiency, as determined by the signal obtained from the co-transfected OVEC-REF. In vitro transcription experiments in untreated HeLa nuclear extracts were performed as described previously (7.Martinez E. Chiang C.M. Ge H. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3115-3126Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Products were quantified by primer extension using the GL-2 sequencing primer (Promega). DNase I footprinting was done essentially as described (21.Oelgeschläger T. Chiang C.M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1996; 382: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Templates containing the respective LRP-2 promoter inserts and flanking vector sequences, were radiolabeled on the noncoding strand, using polynucleotide kinase. Similar molar amounts (2.4 fmol/15 μl) of different templates were used in the binding reactions. Products were analyzed on 6% (primer extension) or 8% (footprinting) sequencing gels and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis, and results were documented by autoradiography. We have shown previously that LRP-2 promoter activity is dependent on a weak nonconsensus TATA element with the sequence TAGAAAA located 30 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site (25.Knutson A. Hellman P. Akerstrom G. Westin G. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Earlier studies demonstrated that introduction of a G·C base pair at position 3 of the TATAAAA consensus sequence reduces TFIID promoter activity 50-fold (11.Wobbe C.R. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3859-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that additional core promoter sequences downstream of the TATA element may contribute to the LRP-2 promoter activity. Since the LRP-2 promoter appears to lack an initiator element (consensus YYA+1N(T/A)YY; Ref. 6.Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), we examined the functional contribution of LRP-2 promoter sequences downstream of the transcription start site. Two 3′-deletion LRP-2 promoter mutants, encompassing nucleotides −120 to +11 and −120 to +4 (Fig. 1 A), were constructed, and their transcription activities were compared with that of the full-length promoter (−120/+52; Ref. 25.Knutson A. Hellman P. Akerstrom G. Westin G. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) in vitro and in transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 1 B, RNA polymerase II-dependent LRP-2 transcription (compare lanes 1 and2) was moderately reduced by deletion of the promoter region between +11 and +52 (compare lanes 1 and3). Further deletion of sequences to +4, however, resulted in a dramatic reduction of LRP-2 promoter activity, almost to background level (Fig. 1 B, compare lanes 3 and 4). Importantly, introduction of clustered point mutations between +5 and +11 in constructs carrying LRP-2 promoter sequences either from −120 to +52 (yielding −120/+52 mut(4–10)) or from −120/+11 (yielding −120/+11 mut(5–8); Fig.1 A) also strongly reduced LRP-2 promoter activity (Fig.1 B, compare lane 1 withlane 5, and compare lane 3with lane 6). These observations demonstrate that core promoter sequences downstream of the transcription start site significantly contribute to efficient LRP-2 transcription in HeLa nuclear extracts and that a major proportion of LRP-2 downstream promoter function is conferred by the DNA sequence 5′-TTTTGGC-3′ located between +5 and +11. To study the function of LRP-2 downstream promoter regions in living cells, we co-transfected JEG-3 cells, which express LRP-2, with reporter plasmids containing the LRP-2 promoter variants fused to a luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 1 A) and a β-galactosidase reference plasmid. As shown in Fig. 1 C, deletion of LRP-2 promoter sequences from +11 to +52 reduced luciferase activities in the respective cell extracts by 50%, while further deletion of sequences from +11 to +4 resulted in an additional 2–3-fold reduction of LRP-2 promoter activity. Importantly, and in agreement with our in vitro data, clustered point mutation of promoter sequences between +5 and +11 affected LRP-2 transcription to the same extent as the deletion of promoter sequences between +5 and +11 (Fig. 1 C). We confirmed that changes in luciferase activity in these assays indeed reflected changes in intracellular luciferase mRNA levels by performing RNase protection assays (Fig. 1 D) on total RNA from cells co-transfected with derivatives of our luciferase reporter gene constructs carrying the SV40 enhancer upstream of the LRP-2 promoter and the OVEC-REF plasmid as a reference (28.Westin G. Gerster T. Muller M.M. Schaffner G. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 6787-6798Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings demonstrate a requirement of core promoter sequences downstream of the transcription start site for efficient LRP-2 transcription in vitro and in transfected cells. Our data also suggest that a major proportion of LRP-2 downstream promoter function is conferred by the DNA sequence 5′-TTTTGGC-3′ located between positions +5 and +11. This sequence appears not to be related to a functional initiator element (consensus YYA+1N(T/A)YY; Ref. 6.Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) or to the recently described DPE inDrosophila (consensus (A/G)G(A/T)CGT; Refs. 8.Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar and 9.Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3020-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) and may therefore contain a novel downstream core promoter element. Work from a number of laboratories has clearly established that TAFIIs perform critical functions in the binding and the functional readout of core promoter elements distinct from the TATA element (reviewed in Refs. 1.Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar,3.Verrijzer C.P. Tjian R. Trends Biochem Sci. 1996; 21: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, and 4.Burley S.K. Roeder R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 769-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). To test for a role of TAFIIs in LRP-2 downstream promoter sequence function, we examined the function of LRP-2 downstream promoter sequences between +5 and +52 on transcription in a HeLa nuclear extract immunodepleted of TFIID activity (NE[ΔD]; Ref.27.Oelgeschläger T.

As shown in Fig. 2 B, transcription from the LRP-2 promoter in this extract was completely dependent on the addition of either highly purified recombinant human 6His:TBP or equivalent amounts (TBP content) of immunoaffinity-purified f:TFIID (Fig. 2 A; Refs. 19.Chiang C.M. Ge H. Wang Z. Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2749-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar and 27.Oelgeschläger T. Tao Y. Kang Y.K. Roeder R.G. Mol Cell. 1998; 1: 925-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the presence of f:TFIID, the relative levels of transcription from the parental −120/+52 constructs and the two deletion mutants in NE[ΔD] were comparable with those observed in untreated extract (comparelanes 3, 6, and 9 of Fig.2 B with lanes 1, 3, and4 of Fig. 1 B). Thus, the addition of highly purified f:TFIID (Fig. 2 A) was sufficient to restore LRP-2 downstream sequence functions in NE[ΔD]. Importantly, transcription levels from the LRP-2 promoter containing downstream promoter sequences up to +52 was significantly higher (>5-fold) with f:TFIID than with similar amounts of human 6His:TBP (Fig. 2 B, comparelane 2 with lane 3). This was also true for the −120/+11 construct (lanes 5 and 6), although the difference in absolute transcription levels was somewhat lower (3.4-fold). Despite the very weak absolute transcription levels, transcription from the −120/+4 template was reproducibly higher with 6His:TBP than with f:TFIID (lanes 8 and 9). Taken together, these results demonstrate that LRP-2 downstream sequence function is TAFII-dependent. They also indicate that TAFIIs may actually inhibit TBP function in the absence of LRP-2 downstream promoter sequences, consistent with earlier observations with other core promoters (13.Verrijzer C.P. Chen J.L. Yokomori K. Tjian R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1115-1125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 27.Oelgeschläger T. Tao Y. Kang Y.K. Roeder R.G.

Similar results were obtained in analogous experiments using heat-treated HeLa nuclear extracts that lack TFIID activity (Ref. 17.Nakajima N. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4028-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar; data not shown). To further investigate the role(s) of TAFIIs in LRP-2 downstream promoter sequence function, we carried out DNase I footprinting experiments using radiolabeled DNA fragments containing various LRP-2 promoter variants, immunoaffinity-purified f:TFIID, and partially purified human TFIIA (21.Oelgeschläger T. Chiang C.M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1996; 382: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Binding of f:TFIID to a DNA fragment containing LRP-2 promoter sequences from −120 to +52 was relatively weak, presumably due to the low affinity TATA box sequence present in the LRP-2 promoter (Ref. 11.Wobbe C.R. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3859-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar; see below). However, detectable DNase I protection extended over a broad promoter region from about position −40 to +30 (Fig. 3,lanes 1–4). Importantly, f:TFIID binding induced strong DNase I hypersensitivity centered around positions −50 and −60 upstream of the TAGA element, as well as within the LRP-2 downstream promoter region at positions +7 and +8. Removal of LRP-2 downstream sequences from +11 to +52 resulted in a modest reproducible reduction of overall f:TFIID binding to the LRP-2 promoter but did not affect DNase I hypersensitivity upstream from the TATA element and downstream from the transcription start site (Fig. 3, compare lanes 1–4 with lanes 5–8), in agreement with the modest, yet reproducible impairment of transcription observed in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 1, B, C, and D). Importantly, and in contrast to our observations with the −120/+52 and −120/+11 constructs, further deletion of LRP-2 promoter sequences to +4 did not significantly reduce overall f:TFIID binding but instead completely abolished the induction of DNase I hypersensitivity upstream from the TATA element and downstream from the transcription start site (Fig. 3, compare lanes 9–12 withlanes 5–8). These results suggest that LRP-2 promoter sequences from +5 to +11 are major determinants of f:TFIID·DNA complex formation, consistent with their importance for efficient LRP-2 transcription in vitro and in transfected cells (Fig. 1, B, C, and D). Finally, we assessed the contribution of the nonconsensus LRP-2 TATA element in f:TFIID promoter binding by performing DNase I footprinting assays with a promoter construct containing LRP-2 sequences from −10 to +52, lacking the TAGA element. Surprisingly, we were able to detect weak f:TFIID binding, protecting a region from DNase I digestion downstream of the transcription start site and to around position −40 (Fig. 3, lanes 13–15). Thus, although the TAGA element at position −30 is required for detectable LRP-2 transcription in vitro (25.Knutson A. Hellman P. Akerstrom G. Westin G. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), LRP-2 downstream promoter sequences between positions −10 and +52 appear to be sufficient for low affinity f:TFIID binding. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that DNA sequences downstream of the transcription start site contribute to efficient f:TFIID binding. Interestingly, the presence of the downstream region between +5 and +11 did not significantly increase the overall affinity of f:TFIID binding to the LRP-2 promoter (Fig. 3, lanes 5–12) but rather induced strong DNase I hypersensitivity upstream of the TATA element and downstream of the LRP-2 transcription start site. This indicated to us that this particular part of the LRP-2 downstream region may affect the overall topology of the f:TFIID·LRP-2 promoter complex (see below). We attempted unsuccessfully to identify the component(s) of TFIID that contact the LRP-2 downstream promoter region by a photocross-linking method (data not shown) using promoter constructs modified"
https://openalex.org/W2143162088,"The African trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei has a digenetic life cycle that involves the insect vector and the mammalian host. This is underscored by biochemical switches in its nutritional requirements. In the insect vector, the parasite relies on amino acid catabolism, but in the mammalian host, it derives its energy exclusively from blood glucose. Glucose transport is facilitated, and constitutes the rate-limiting step in ATP synthesis. Here, we report the cloning of a novel glucose transporter-related gene by heterologous screening of a λEMBL4 genomic library of T. brucei EATRO 164 using a rat liver glucose transporter cDNA clone. Genomic analysis shows that the gene is present as a single copy within the parasite genome. The gene encodes a protein with an estimated molecular mass of 55.9 kDa, which shares only segmental homology with members of the glucose transporter superfamily. Several potential post-translational modification sites including phosphorylation, N-glycosylation, and cotranslational myristoylation sites also punctuate the sequence. It is distinguished from classical transporter proteins by the absence of putative hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains. However, this protein was capable of complementing Schizosaccharomyces pombe glucose transporter mutants. The rescued phenotype conferred the ability of the cells to grow on a broad range of sugars, both monosaccharides and disaccharides. The kinetics of glucose uptake reflected those in T. brucei.

Krebs-Ringer-Hepes yeast extract and supplements trypanosome glucose transporter-related protein The bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei are absolutely dependent on peripheral glucose supply and derive their energy by glycolysis (1.Vickerman K. Br. Med. Bull. 1985; 41: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 2.Durieux P.O. Schütz Brun R. Köhler P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 45: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The glycosome is the major site for glycolysis, and most glycolytic enzymes are compartmentalized here (3.Opperdoes F.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 127-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). There is evidence suggesting the differential expression of glycolytic enzymes in the bloodstream forms (4.Parsons M. Alexander K. Hill T. Neilsen B. Dovey H.F. Wang C.C. Parasites: Molecular Biology, Drug and Vaccine Design. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1990: 247-261Google Scholar). This may be indicative of a differentially expressed glucose transporter, assuming that the two systems operate in tandem. In order to be shunted into the glycolytic pathway, glucose must therefore cross the plasma membrane and then pass through the glycosomal membrane. It might appear that both compartments are equipped with glucose transporters, although it is suggested that the flagellar pocket may serve in solute uptake by endocytosis (5.Coppens I. Opperdoes F.R. Courtroy P.J. Baudhiun P. J. Protozool. 1987; 34: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Glucose uptake by bloodstream forms is mediated by a facilitated glucose transporter (6.Eisenthal R. Game S. Holman G.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 985: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 7.Gruenberg J. Sharma P.R. Deshusses J. Eur. J.

Kinetic measurements indicate that there are substantial differences between this transporter and that of the mammalian host. Some of these differences include a 20–50-fold higher rate of glucose metabolism than the mammalian host cells (9.von Brand T. Lwoff A. Biochemistry and Physiology of Protozoa. 1. Academic Press, New York1951: 177-234Crossref Google Scholar); insensitivity to cytochalasin B (unpublished observations), and the ability to transport fructose (10.Fry A.J. Towner P. Holman G.D. Eisenthal R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 60: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Some work has shown that several glucose transporters are present in the kinetoplastids, which differ largely in the stage specificity of expression (11.Bringaud F. Baltz T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 52: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 12.Bringaud F. Baltz T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1146-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 13.Cairns B.R.

Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 55: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These transporters showed apparent homology to members of the facilitative glucose transporters including the presence of putative transmembrane segments. The kinetics of glucose uptake and sensitivity to known inhibitors of transport were also similar in many respects. However, because those transporters were identified either with variant surface glycoprotein gene probes (11.Bringaud F. Baltz T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 52: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) or based on developmental expression (13.Cairns B.R. Collard M.W. Landfear S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7682-7686Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we reasoned that other unidentified transporters still exist inT. brucei. By heterologous probing with a rat liver glucose transporter cDNA, we isolated and cloned a trypanosome protein that is distinct from any previously reported. Although it has only residual homology to the classical glucose transporters, it was able to rescue fission yeast glucose transporter mutants by supporting growth on sugars, both disaccharides and monosaccharides. This protein may therefore belong to a new class of transporters, or it may be tightly associated with glucose uptake and metabolism. T. brucei clone MiTat 1.1 was grown in Wistar rats and purified from blood on a DEAE-cellulose column based on the method of Lanham (15.Lanham S.M. Nature. 1968; 218: 1273-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer model 318A. A genomic λEMBL4 library of T. brucei EATRO 164 was used to infect Q359 cells and plated on 20 × 20-cm agar dishes to yield a confluent lawn of plaques. Plaque lifts were performed according to standard techniques (16.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using Hybond N+ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The immobilized bacteriophage DNA was screened with a rat liver glucose transporter cDNA (17.Thorens B. Sarkar H.K. Kaback H.R. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1988; 55: 281-290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) labeled with [α-32P]dATP by random priming using the Multiprime DNA labeling system as directed (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridizations were performed in 50% deionized formamide, 1% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution, 5× SSC, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 200 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, at 42 °C for 18 h. Posthybridization treatment included a moderate stringency wash at 55 °C for 1 h in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. The membranes were exposed overnight to Fuji film for autoradiography. Positive isolates were purified by two cycles of screening at decreasing plaque densities. DNA was purified from the positive clones and restriction mapped by Southern blotting and hybridization with the rat cDNA probe. A single strongly hybridizing EcoRI/HindIII fragment from clone LT-10 was gel-purified and directionally cloned into pUC18 to give pTGT-4. Transformants of pTGT-4 in TG1 cells were selected on agar/ampicillin plates. Plasmid DNA for sequencing was isolated from large scale cultures by alkaline lysis and CsCl equilibrium centrifugation. The gene was also cloned into theEcoRI/HindIII sites in M13mp18 and M13mp19 and sequenced (18.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52650) Google Scholar) using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). DNA sequences were analyzed using the Staden software program (19.Staden R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 2951-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignments were performed using the HOMED program of Stockwell (20.Stockwell P.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 332-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Data bases were searched using the FASTP program of Lipman and Pearson (21.Lipman D.J. Pearson W.R. Science. 1985; 227: 1435-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (2546) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was digested to completion with restriction endonucleases that have only one recognition site within or flanking the gene. Restriction fragments were electrophoresed on 0.8% agarose gels and blotted onto Hybond N+. The insert from pTGT-4 was random-primed and used to probe the blot. Hybridization conditions were similar to the above except that a final high stringency wash at 65 °C with 1× SSC, 0.05% SDS was included. Total RNA was isolated from bloodstream forms of the parasite according to the method of Chomczynski and Saachi (22.Chomczynski P. Saachi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63169) Google Scholar). Approximately 10 μg was electrophoresed on a 1% formaldehyde agarose gel and transferred to Hybond N+. The blot was probed with pTGT-4 as described above. Hybridization and posthybridization conditions were similar to those employed above. mRNA was isolated from the parasite using the Poly(A) Quik mRNA isolation kit (Stratagene). 2 μg of mRNA was annealed to 10 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP-labeled oligonucleotide C4 (AATTCCAGTGCCTAACCCCTA), complementary to nucleotides 853–873. Primer extension was performed using the avian myeloblastosis virus primer extension system as instructed (Promega). Oligonucleotide C4 was also used to sequence pTGT-4. Both sequencing reaction and primer extension products were co-electrophoresed on 8% polyacrylamide gel (National Diagnostics). TheEcoRI and HindIII cloning sites of the gene were filled in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase and cloned into the SmaI site of the eukaryotic expression vector pSVL to give pSVL2.5. Insert orientation was determined by restriction mapping and confirmed by sequencing. DNA was isolated from the appropriate clone. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 3.5-cm dishes at 37 °C, 5% CO2. At 80–90% confluence, the cells were transfected separately with 10 μg each of pSVL2.5 and pSVL, using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 72 h, the cells were washed twice with Krebs-Ringer-Hepes (KRH)1buffer, pH 7.6 (10 mm Hepes, 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm KH2PO4, 1 mmCaCl2) equilibrated at 37 °C. They were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 500 μl of fresh KRH. This was replaced with a 500-μl mixture of 100 μmd-glucose and 2 μCi of [3H]2-deoxy-d-glucose (6.6 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After an appropriate incubation time, glucose uptake was terminated by adding 2 ml of ice-cold KRH containing 100 μg/ml phloridzin, which was then aspirated. The cells were washed two more times. To control for background or nonspecific binding, the stopping buffer was added to the cells before adding the radiolabeled 2-deoxyglucose. l-[3H]leucine (166 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) uptake control assays were also performed as above, and uptake was terminated with ice-cold KRH. All time points were run in duplicate. The cells were then solubilized in 500 μl 1% SDS at room temperature for 30 min and transferred to a vial containing 10 ml of scintillation mixture and counted in an LKB Wallac counter. This was performed according to Milbradt and Höfer (23.Milbradt B. Höfer M. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 2617-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The insert from pTGT-4, previously cloned into theHindIII/EcoRI site of pGEM7 to give pGEM2.5, was subcloned as a HindIII/XhoI fragment into the yeast shuttle vector pCMVL predigested with HindIII andXhoI. Recombinants were identified and verified by restriction analysis. The new construct, pCMVLTGT, was used to transform the fission yeast glucose transporter mutant YGS-5 (leu1–32 ght1 h +), by the lithium acetate/PEG method (24.Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on synthetic minimal medium, pH 4.5 (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 4.7% gluconic acid (potassium salt), 1.5% agar supplemented with leucine drop-out medium (Bio 101, Inc.)) after 2–3 days of growth at 30 °C. These were replica-plated on minimal agar medium lacking gluconic acid but supplemented with 3% glucose, fructose, and maltose or 0.05% 2-deoxyglucose/gluconic acid, with or without leucine. Alternatively, the cells were also grown on YES/agar medium (0.5% yeast extract, 1.5% agar supplemented with 0.01% each of uracil, adenine, leucine, lysine, and histidine) also containing each of the above sugars. Cultures were incubated at 30 °C for 2–3 days to assess growth. YGS-5 cells and SP-Q01 (wild type; (leu1–32 h −) Stratagene) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C in YES medium and harvested at midlog phase. The culture was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 rpm in a Sorvall centrifuge. They were washed twice with PBS and then resuspended in the same buffer at 2–3A 600 units. Glucose uptake was initiated using 2 ml of cell suspension in universal polystyrene tubes (Bibi Sterilin) by adding 5 μCi of [3H]2-deoxy-d-glucose (8.8 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and rapidly mixed by pipetting. Aliquots of 200 μl were taken at various time intervals and rapidly centrifuged through spin filters (Qiagen) at 13,000 rpm (10–20 s). Radioactivity was measured in an LKB Wallac liquid scintillation counter. Logarithmic phase cultures of YGS-5 cells and Tgtrep-transformed cells were diluted to anA 600 of 0.2 in minimal medium supplemented with 25 mm sugars. For YGS-5, leucine was also added to the medium. The cultures were grown at 30 °C, and optical densities of these cultures were measured at various time points at 600 nm. A permissive growth medium, YEL/gluconate (0.5% yeast extract, 0.2% casamino acids, 4.7% gluconate, pH 4.5) was also used to ensure that both cultures had equivalent growth rates. To identify the putative glucose transporter, we used the rat liver glucose transporter cDNA to screen a genomic library of T. brucei EATRO 164 in λEMBL4. A single strongly hybridizing clone (LT-10) was selected for further characterization. Restriction mapping coupled with Southern blotting using the cDNA probe identified a 2.5-kilobase pairEcoRI/HindIII insert (Fig.1). This was subcloned into pUC18 to yield pTGT-4 and sequenced by dideoxy chain termination. One open reading frame with a coding capacity of 55.9 kDa was identified. A Kozak consensus sequence and clusters of purine residues, which are the basic requirements for efficient mRNA translation, flank the translation initiation codon (25.Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 5233-5252Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). No in-frame methionines were identified upstream of this codon. Using this gene to probe Southern blots of genomic fragments generated with enzymes that have unique restriction sites within the gene, single bands were observed in all cases. Similar results were obtained using restriction sites that flank the gene. A unique band corresponding in size to the fragment from LT-10 was also detected in a HindIII/EcoRI digest (Fig. 2). These results probably suggest that the gene is present as a single copy within the parasite genome. To further confirm that the gene was trypanosome-derived, primers based on the nucleotide sequence of the gene were synthesized and used to amplify genomic and cDNA fragments by polymerase chain reaction. DNA sequencing showed that the genomic and cDNA clones were identical both to the λEMBL4 clone and to a clone obtained from an enriched genomic library (data not shown). Northern blot analysis using the gene as a probe showed a transcript of about 6.2 kilobase pairs (Fig. 3 A). This is larger than the coding capacity of the gene but the size may be due to the presence of untranslated sequences or to the transcript being part of a polycistron. To identify the 5′-end of the mRNA, we performed primer extension. The putative transcription start site (+1) was located within a PvuII site 19 base pairs from the translation start codon (Fig. 3, B and C).Figure 3Transcription analysis of the gene. A, 10 μg of total RNA from bloodstream forms were electrophoresed on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to Hybond N+.

This homology improves if conservative substitutions are taken into account. These are grouped as follows: Ala and Gly; Val, Leu, Ile, and Met; Phe, Tyr, and Trp; Lys and Arg; Glu and Asp; Gln and Asn; and Ser and Thr. However, five of the six most highly conserved motifs (26.Maiden M.C.J. Davis E.O. Baldwin S.A. Moore D.C.M. Henderson P.J.F. Nature. 1987; 325: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) are represented (Fig. 4, A–C). This suggests that although the sequences are divergent, there are diagnostic motifs in the trypanosome sequence that may be used to identify it with related members of the family. We also compared the sequence of this protein with glucose transporters that have been isolated from T. brucei and a developmentally regulated glucose transporter gene in Leishmania but found very little sequence homologies. In both cases, multiple isoforms of the transporter have been found (11.Bringaud F. Baltz T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 52: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 12.Bringaud F.

Parasitol. 1992; 55: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), in marked contrast to the single copy gene identified for Tgtrep. Hydrophobicity analysis based on the Kyte-Doolittle algorithm (27.Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17208) Google Scholar) showed that the protein lacks typical membrane-spanning domains, due to a preponderance of charged residues punctuating the sequence. Only four potential α-helix nucleation sites could be identified, and a significant β-sheet component is also indicated (data not shown). Several potential post-translational modification sites also punctuate the sequence, notablyN-glycosylation and phosphorylation, and cotranslational myristoylation sites (data not shown). COS-7 cells were transfected with the gene by lipofection. RNA analysis of the transfected cells by primer extension using oligonucleotide C4 as described above showed that the gene was efficiently transcribed (data not shown). Glucose uptake assays showed that the gene enhanced glucose accumulation up to 4-fold above background endogenous transport (Fig.5 A). The pattern of uptake showed rapid initial rates and sensitivity to phloridzin. As a control for specific glucose transport, the activity of the l-amino acid transporter system (28.Segawa H. Fukasawa Y. Miyamoto K. Takeda E. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19745-19751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) was measured in cells transfected with the pSVL2.5 and pSVL using l-[3H]leucine. In this instance, there was no difference in l-amino acid uptake (Fig. 5 B). Specific glucose uptake assays were also performed in the yeast mutant YGS-5. Cells transformed with the gene also showed enhanced uptake compared with the YGS-5 background (Fig.5 C). The uptake profile showed very high initial rates, consistent with glucose uptake in trypanosomes or reconstituted trypanosome membrane vesicles. 2H. K. Bayele, R. S. Eisenthal, and P.

The ability of the gene to reconstitute glucose transport in the fission yeast YGS-5, which is defective in sugar uptake, was assessed by cloning it into the yeast shuttle expression vector pCMVL. YGS-5 cells transformed with the gene were monitored on their ability to grow on monosaccharides and disaccharides. The gene was able to confer growth on gluconic acid, glucose, fructose, and maltose minimal medium (Fig. 6, A–D). Growth was rapid (within 24 h) and profuse. YGS-5 was able to grow only on gluconic acid but not on the other sugars. Dead-end nonmetabolizable substrates such as 2-deoxyglucose could not support the growth of Tgtrep-transformed YGS-5 cells on minimal medium (data not shown). To assess the ability of Tgtrep-transformed cells to utilize various sugars for growth, diluted logarithmic phase cultures were monitored for increase in growth/optical density over time. Whereas YGS-5 cells showed a prolonged lag phase of growth (>6 h), transformed cells showed a diminished lag phase (<2 h). Growth in these cells was relatively more rapid. The kinetics of growth were similar for all sugars tested, with both monosaccharides and disaccharides (Fig.7, A–D). Similar profiles of growth were also observed when the cultures were grown in glycerol (3%) or 25 mm rhamnose, arabinose, galactose, xylose, sorbitol, or glucosamine (data not shown). To ensure that the observed differences in growth rates were not due to an altered growth cycle in YGS-5, a permissive medium was used for both sets of cultures. In this instance, the growth rate was equal in both cases (Fig.7 E). The working assumption in our approach to use a rat liver glucose transporter probe to isolate the trypanosome homologue was that the two transporters would be structurally similar. Due to the evolutionary distance between the rat and the trypanosome, however, the genomic library was screened at a low to moderate stringency. Subsequent hybridization with isolated clones was performed at increasing stringency until a single hybridizing clone was picked and characterized. The structure of the gene contained within this clone is typical of trypanosome genes in terms of nucleotide content, codon usage, and dinucleotide frequencies (29.Michels P.A.M. J. Mol. Evol. 1986; 24: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The sequence composition also shares local homologies with the cDNA probe. An additional feature includes polypyrimidine tracts and oligo(dT)-rich sequences, which have been implicated in trans-splicing in the kinetoplastids and higher eukaryotes (30.Curotto de Lafaille M.A. Laban A. Wirth D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2703-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 31.Patton J.G. Mayer S.A. Tempst P. Nadal-Ginard B. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1237-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). A putative transcription initiation site was also identified, but this may be a result of artifactual termination of transcription possibly due to mRNA secondary structure. It may also suggest that this mRNA is processed by a novel mechanism that is yet to be identified. Because of the polycistronic nature of transcription in trypanosome genes (32.Borst P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 701-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 33.VanHamme L. Pays E. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 223-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this finding is treated conservatively until further information is available. The poor global homology between this protein and the glucose transporter superfamily may suggest a weak evolutionary parsimony, consistent with the evolutionary distance between trypanosomes and other organisms (29.Michels P.A.M. J. Mol. Evol. 1986; 24: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This notwithstanding, the presence of highly conserved modules and residues within the protein, both in sequence content and spatial arrangement, establishes some functional relatedness. This is supported by two lines of evidence. The gene enhanced glucose transport when transfected into COS-7 cells. Because there was a possibility that endogenous glucose transporters in the COS-7 cells could confound our observations, we sought another heterologous expression system to confirm our results. We therefore chose the fission yeast S. pombe YGS-5, which is defective in glucose transport. The rationale for the use of S. pombewas based on a number of factors. In both T. brucei andS. pombe, transport or uptake is the rate-limiting step in glucose metabolism. Like T. brucei, S. pombe is a unicellular eukaryote and historically has been used successfully in gene complementation (34.Lee M.G. Nurse P. Nature. 1987; 327: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 35.Zhao Y. Lieberman H.B. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). S. pombe also has only one sugar transporter; therefore, complementation for glucose uptake should be all-or-nothing. Our data show that expression of Tgtrep in the yeast mutant could rescue the glucose transporter phenotype. Transformed cells could utilize both monosaccharides and disaccharides for growth. The rate of growth of these transformants in sugar medium (except gluconate medium) was faster than the mutants. Because S. pombe has a separate transporter for gluconate (36.Hoever M. Milbradt B. Höfer M. Arch. Microbiol. 1992; 157: 191-193Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the mutant was able to grow on this medium but not on the other sugars. Glucose uptake in complemented cells showed very high initial rates, consistent with observations in transport using trypanosomes or reconstituted trypanosome membrane vesicles. 3H. K. Bayele, R. S. Eisenthal, and P. Towner, unpublished data. The differences in kinetics of transport reflected the growth differences in various sugars. The prolonged lag phase in the mutant compared with the complemented cells may be attributed to a lower affinity of the transporter for the sugar and therefore a lower rate of transport or may be due to a slower rate of metabolism. However, since the activity of hexokinase in the mutant is comparable with the wild type (23.Milbradt B. Höfer M. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 2617-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that different rates of metabolism accounted for the differences in growth kinetics. Therefore, the more plausible reason is a difference in the rate of sugar transport. Our failure to identify putative transmembrane domains using the prediction algorithms suggests that this protein is structurally distinct. On the other hand, a narrower running window may be required to identify short α-helices. In other words, it is possible that the protein has shorter transmembrane segments not identifiable by using the present criteria for assignment. Since these algorithms were derived mainly from x-ray crystal structures of soluble proteins, it is uncertain whether they apply to all (membrane) proteins, and indeed their validity is questionable (37.Lodish H.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 332-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For example, some putative membrane-spanning domains in fact contain helix-breaking residues such as proline. The archetypal polytopic glucose transporter of the red blood cell has its α-helices oriented perpendicular to the plane of the lipid bilayer, i.e a significant proportion of the transporter (30–50%) lies outside the membrane. It has also been shown to contain a substantial β-sheet component (38.Chin J.J Chen E.K.Y. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7101-7104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Alvarez J. Lee D.C. Baldwin S.A. Chapman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3502-3509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is also evidence that an effective lipid-interacting amphipathic α-helix needs only 8–10 residues in length (37.Lodish H.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 332-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 40.McLean L.R. Hagaman K.A. Owen T.J. Krstenansky J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 41.Guy H.R. Seetharamulu P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 508-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). A criterion other than α-helicity or hydrophobicity may need to be applied in order to rationalize the structure of Tgtrep, such as β-segments. In particular, it has been shown that a stretch of six residues in β-sheet structure can span the membrane (42.Paul C. Rosenbusch J.P. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1593-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). It is also possible that charged residues are spatially arranged in such a way as to form salt bridges to confer stability to the protein within the membrane. This is a strong possibility if viewed within the context of the seven putative myristoylation signals within Tgtrep. It is known that clusters of basic residues enhance the localization of myristoylated proteins to the plasma membrane. This is the proposed mechanism for membrane association of the Src family and other related membrane proteins (43.Resh M.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). The presence of potential myristoylation sites within Tgtrep may therefore indicate membrane association, although there is no evidence to suggest that these sites may be myristoylated in vivo. An alternative proposition is that the protein is probably located elsewhere other than the plasma membrane such as the flagellar pocket, where it may participate in solute or substrate sensing and uptake. In this regard, it is worth adding that this protein shares identities at its N terminus with the N-terminal sequence of GLUT4 (data not shown), which has been implicated as the targeting signal for its localization to cytoplasmic vesicles (44.Piper R.C. Tai C. Slot J.W. Hahn C.S. Rice D. Huang H. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 729-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This motif is homologous to the endocytic signal of cell surface receptors (44.Piper R.C. Tai C. Slot J.W. Hahn C.S. Rice D. Huang H. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 729-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 45.James D.E. Piper R.C. Slot J.W. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 607-617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Considering that GLUT4 is normally sequestered in intracellular compartments and only translocated or recruited in response to insulin, it is tempting to speculate that a similar mechanism may hold true for the trypanosome protein. It is also not clear whether the predictions of membrane protein topology would apply if the protein is on the glycosomal membrane, which is surrounded by the cytosol. Since the enzymes of glycolysis are compartmentalized within the glycosome, it is probable that this organelle has its own glucose transporter. Another plausible proposition for this protein's structural uniqueness is that it may be a regulatory protein that acts upstream or downstream of the transport step; i.e. it may act as a glucose sensor or rheostat for glucose uptake and/or metabolism rather than being directly involved in sugar uptake by itself. In this regard, it is remarkable that there are several potential protein kinase C, cyclic AMP-dependent, casein kinase II, and tyrosine kinase phosphorylation sites within the protein. The idea of a glucose sensor is appealing in so far as it underscores the exquisite nature of trypanosome reliance on glucose and the coupling of its energy metabolism to its life cycle. It is also probably informative that the rat GLUT2 probe used to isolate Tgtrep has been proposed as a glucose sensor in pancreatic β-cells (17.Thorens B. Sarkar H.K. Kaback H.R. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1988; 55: 281-290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 46.Johnson N.H. Newgard C.B. Milburn J.L. Lodish H.F. Thorens B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6548-6551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The global effect of glucose on cellular metabolism suggests that glucose transporters may interact with a plethora of other proteins, especially the glycolytic enzymes. Thus, Tgtrep may form an integral part of a multiprotein complex, where it may contribute to glucose homeostasis in the parasite. We have shown in this report the presence of a unique protein inT. brucei, which is encoded by a single copy gene that appears to be related to the glucose transporter superfamily. Although it was capable of rescuing yeast glucose transporter mutants and restoring growth on a variety of sugars, it is distinct from classical glucose transporters by the absence of canonical membrane-spanning domains. Differences between biochemical targets in parasite and host are often exploited in drug design. The structural uniqueness of this putative transporter or sensor may therefore be invaluable for the rational design and targeting of potent trypanocides. We thank Professor Harvey F. Lodish (Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and Department of Biology, MIT, Cambridge, MA) for the rat liver glucose transporter cDNA; Dr. David Barry for the T. brucei EATRO 164 λEMBL4 genomic library; Dr. Adrian Wolstenholme for helpful discussions; and Dr. Phil Harris for oligodeoxynucleotide synthesis.

https://openalex.org/W2010715445,"In the present study, we used an expression cloning strategy to identify transcription factors that bind specifically to a limited region of the inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER) promoter and regulate transcription. Murine thyrotroph embryonic factor (mTEF) was isolated and was shown to bind to a site located at nucleotides –117 to –108 from the transcriptional start site. Transient expression of reporter constructs containing either a consensus TEFRE or the <i>icer</i>TEF binding site demonstrated that TEF-dependent transcription correlated with relative binding affinities, <i>i.e.</i> the consensus TEFRE bound TEF more tightly and was more responsive to TEF than the <i>icer</i>TEFRE. Because the <i>icer</i>TEFRE overlapped a cAMP response element, the responsiveness of these sequences to either cAMP or Ca<sup>2+</sup> was tested. Although TEF expression had no effect on the cAMP-regulated transcriptional response of the ICER promoter, TEF did confer calcium responsiveness to these sequences. Calcium also modestly increased the TEF-mediated transcription from a consensus TEFRE. Additional studies using Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated kinases indicate that Ca<sup>2+</sup>/TEF/TEFRE-regulated transcription may be mediated through Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMK) IV. Moreover, studies with the <i>icer</i>TEFRE in a CaMK IV-deficient cell line demonstrated that these cells were transcriptionally unresponsive to thapsigargin; however, responsiveness was restored by co-expression of the active CaMK IV. These studies are the first to demonstrate that TEF is a calcium-responsive transcription factor, and they suggest that there are two classes of TEF-regulated genes. One class, represented by a consensus TEFRE, is regulated by TEF in the resting cell; the second class, represented by<i>icer</i>TEFRE, is regulated by TEF in the calcium-activated cell."
