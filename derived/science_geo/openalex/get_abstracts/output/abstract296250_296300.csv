https://openalex.org/W2028321694,"A new method for evaluating the ""Ph.D. productivity"" of undergraduate institutions was applied to a sample of 265 institutions. It was found that a college's actual Ph.D. output can be predicted relatively accurately from an ""expected"" output based on the sex, major fields, and intelligence level of its students. Public institutions were found to be significantly overproductive, and eastern men's colleges and universities were found to be significantly underproductive. Previous findings indicating that the faculty had a causative effect on productivity were not confirmed. These results suggest that Ph.D. productivity may not be a sensitive measure of the effectiveness of undergraduate institutions."

Although two of these subjects fulfilled the usual diagnostic criteria for this disorder, they oxidized the intravenously administered sugar to C(14)O(2) in a nearly normal fashion."

The action of tyrosinase on poison ivy toxicants occurs both in vitro and on the human skin."

An analytical method is used to calculate the derivatives X' and X'' from the collected data, X, and t."
