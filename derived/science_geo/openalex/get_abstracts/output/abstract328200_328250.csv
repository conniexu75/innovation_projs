https://openalex.org/W2073080433,"Novel intercalation complexes of many of the layered transition-metal dichalcogenides incorporating the metallocenes of cobalt and chromium have been prepared. Evidence is presented indicating a configuration in which the five-membered rings of the metallocene guest are situated perpendicular to the slabs of the dichalcogenide host. In the complexes the metallocenes apparently behave as pseudo-alkali metals, transferring an electron to the chalcogenide."

Recent analysis of ten river basins in the southeastern United States indicates that of the material eroded from upland slopes since European settlement, only about 5 percent has been exported. The remainder, alluvium and colluvium, will probably not be exported because of extensive reservoir impoundments."
https://openalex.org/W2074672425,"Oxygen-18 analyses of pelagic and benthic foraminifera from core K 11 indicate that during the last glaciation Norwegian Sea bottom waters were warmer than in modern times and had the same physical parameters (temperature, oxygen isotope ratio, and salinity) as the North Atlantic deep water. This result indicates that the glacial Norwegian Sea was not a sink for dense surface water, as it is now, and that during glacial times North Atlantic deep water invaded the deep Norwegian basin."

https://openalex.org/W2095370851,"Relatively simple atmospheric electrical instrumentation carried on a small aircraft constitutes a flexible and sensitive system for detecting organized convection. Data can be obtained close to the sea surface, and low-velocity flight enhances the spatial resolution. With a slow-flying airplane or powered glider, it may be possible to trace the circulation of individual convection cells and to investigate the trajectory of air which forms cumulus clouds, one of the major unsolved problems in tropical meteorology. Since space charge near the ocean surface was found on some days to be organized on a horizontal scale equivalent to the cumulus cloud scale, this suggests that some of the air which forms maritime cumulus clouds may come from within a few meters of the ocean and that atmospheric electrical instrumentation may have the potential for tracing air from the sea surface to the clouds."

https://openalex.org/W1979324090,"Radar cross-section measurements indicate that Ganymede scatters to Earth 12 percent of the power expected from a conducting sphere of the same size and distance. This compares with 8 percent for Mars, 12 percent for Venus, 6 percent for Mercury, and about 8 percent for the asteroid Toro. Furthermore, Ganymede is considerably rougher (to the scale of the wavelength used, 12.6 centimeters) than Mars, Venus, or Mercury. Roughness is made evident in this experiment by the presence of echoes away from the center of the disk. A perfectly smooth target would reflect only a glint from the center, whereas a very rough target would reflect power from over the entire disk."

https://openalex.org/W2082610973,"The mean bulk magnetic susceptibility (χ̅) and the intensity of remanent magnetization (J̅) of deep-sea sediments vary systematically, but in an opposite sense, for a distance of 600 kilometers downwind from the Azores. Beyond the distance both J̅ and χ̅ diminish for at least another 600 kilometers. The dominant type of magnetic particle in the sediments is interpreted to be atmospherically transported volcanic dust."
