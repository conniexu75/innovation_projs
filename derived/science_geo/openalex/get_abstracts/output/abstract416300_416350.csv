https://openalex.org/W1988756388,"Both genome-wide genetic and epigenetic alterations are fundamentally important for the development of cancers, but the interdependence of these aberrations is poorly understood. Glioblastomas and other cancers with the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) constitute a subset of tumours with extensive epigenomic aberrations and a distinct biology. Glioma CIMP (G-CIMP) is a powerful determinant of tumour pathogenicity, but the molecular basis of G-CIMP remains unresolved. Here we show that mutation of a single gene, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), establishes G-CIMP by remodelling the methylome. This remodelling results in reorganization of the methylome and transcriptome. Examination of the epigenome of a large set of intermediate-grade gliomas demonstrates a distinct G-CIMP phenotype that is highly dependent on the presence of IDH mutation. Introduction of mutant IDH1 into primary human astrocytes alters specific histone marks, induces extensive DNA hypermethylation, and reshapes the methylome in a fashion that mirrors the changes observed in G-CIMP-positive lower-grade gliomas. Furthermore, the epigenomic alterations resulting from mutant IDH1 activate key gene expression programs, characterize G-CIMP-positive proneural glioblastomas but not other glioblastomas, and are predictive of improved survival. Our findings demonstrate that IDH mutation is the molecular basis of CIMP in gliomas, provide a framework for understanding oncogenesis in these gliomas, and highlight the interplay between genomic and epigenomic changes in human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2154313451,"Recurrent mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and IDH2 have been identified in gliomas, acute myeloid leukaemias (AML) and chondrosarcomas, and share a novel enzymatic property of producing 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) from α-ketoglutarate. Here we report that 2HG-producing IDH mutants can prevent the histone demethylation that is required for lineage-specific progenitor cells to differentiate into terminally differentiated cells. In tumour samples from glioma patients, IDH mutations were associated with a distinct gene expression profile enriched for genes expressed in neural progenitor cells, and this was associated with increased histone methylation. To test whether the ability of IDH mutants to promote histone methylation contributes to a block in cell differentiation in non-transformed cells, we tested the effect of neomorphic IDH mutants on adipocyte differentiation in vitro. Introduction of either mutant IDH or cell-permeable 2HG was associated with repression of the inducible expression of lineage-specific differentiation genes and a block to differentiation. This correlated with a significant increase in repressive histone methylation marks without observable changes in promoter DNA methylation. Gliomas were found to have elevated levels of similar histone repressive marks. Stable transfection of a 2HG-producing mutant IDH into immortalized astrocytes resulted in progressive accumulation of histone methylation. Of the marks examined, increased H3K9 methylation reproducibly preceded a rise in DNA methylation as cells were passaged in culture. Furthermore, we found that the 2HG-inhibitable H3K9 demethylase KDM4C was induced during adipocyte differentiation, and that RNA-interference suppression of KDM4C was sufficient to block differentiation. Together these data demonstrate that 2HG can inhibit histone demethylation and that inhibition of histone demethylation can be sufficient to block the differentiation of non-transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W2069994241,"Analysis of stability criteria for different types of complex ecological network shows key differences between predator–prey interactions, which are stabilizing, and competitive and mutualistic interactions, which are destabilizing. Writing in Nature 40 years ago, Robert May questioned a central belief in ecology. The accepted wisdom was that complex ecosystems were more stable than simpler ones, but May proved that sufficiently large or complex ecological networks tend towards instability. Since then, much work in theoretical ecology has centred on learning why specific non-random networks are stable in practice. Stefano Allesina and Si Tang have analysed stability criteria for different types of realistic networks, and found key differences between predator–prey interactions, which are stabilizing, and competitive and mutualistic interactions, which are destabilizing. Forty years ago, May proved1,2 that sufficiently large or complex ecological networks have a probability of persisting that is close to zero, contrary to previous expectations3,4,5. May analysed large networks in which species interact at random1,2,6. However, in natural systems pairs of species have well-defined interactions (for example predator–prey, mutualistic or competitive). Here we extend May’s results to these relationships and find remarkable differences between predator–prey interactions, which are stabilizing, and mutualistic and competitive interactions, which are destabilizing. We provide analytic stability criteria for all cases. We use the criteria to prove that, counterintuitively, the probability of stability for predator–prey networks decreases when a realistic food web structure is imposed7,8 or if there is a large preponderance of weak interactions9,10. Similarly, stability is negatively affected by nestedness11,12,13,14 in bipartite mutualistic networks. These results are found by separating the contribution of network structure and interaction strengths to stability. Stable predator–prey networks can be arbitrarily large and complex, provided that predator–prey pairs are tightly coupled. The stability criteria are widely applicable, because they hold for any system of differential equations."
https://openalex.org/W2166599924,"Mechanotransduction has an important role in physiology. Biological processes including sensing touch and sound waves require as-yet-unidentified cation channels that detect pressure. Mouse Piezo1 (MmPiezo1) and MmPiezo2 (also called Fam38a and Fam38b, respectively) induce mechanically activated cationic currents in cells; however, it is unknown whether Piezo proteins are pore-forming ion channels or modulate ion channels. Here we show that Drosophila melanogaster Piezo (DmPiezo, also called CG8486) also induces mechanically activated currents in cells, but through channels with remarkably distinct pore properties including sensitivity to the pore blocker ruthenium red and single channel conductances. MmPiezo1 assembles as a ∼1.2-million-dalton homo-oligomer, with no evidence of other proteins in this complex. Purified MmPiezo1 reconstituted into asymmetric lipid bilayers and liposomes forms ruthenium-red-sensitive ion channels. These data demonstrate that Piezo proteins are an evolutionarily conserved ion channel family involved in mechanotransduction."
https://openalex.org/W2142898716,"The identification of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), fumarate hydratase (FH) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations in human cancers has rekindled the idea that altered cellular metabolism can transform cells. Inactivating SDH and FH mutations cause the accumulation of succinate and fumarate, respectively, which can inhibit 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG)-dependent enzymes, including the EGLN prolyl 4-hydroxylases that mark the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) transcription factor for polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. Inappropriate HIF activation is suspected of contributing to the pathogenesis of SDH-defective and FH-defective tumours but can suppress tumour growth in some other contexts. IDH1 and IDH2, which catalyse the interconversion of isocitrate and 2-OG, are frequently mutated in human brain tumours and leukaemias. The resulting mutants have the neomorphic ability to convert 2-OG to the (R)-enantiomer of 2-hydroxyglutarate ((R)-2HG). Here we show that (R)-2HG, but not (S)-2HG, stimulates EGLN activity, leading to diminished HIF levels, which enhances the proliferation and soft agar growth of human astrocytes. These findings define an enantiomer-specific mechanism by which the (R)-2HG that accumulates in IDH mutant brain tumours promotes transformation and provide a justification for exploring EGLN inhibition as a potential treatment strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2020275122,"Free fatty acids provide an important energy source as nutrients, and act as signalling molecules in various cellular processes. Several G-protein-coupled receptors have been identified as free-fatty-acid receptors important in physiology as well as in several diseases. GPR120 (also known as O3FAR1) functions as a receptor for unsaturated long-chain free fatty acids and has a critical role in various physiological homeostasis mechanisms such as adipogenesis, regulation of appetite and food preference. Here we show that GPR120-deficient mice fed a high-fat diet develop obesity, glucose intolerance and fatty liver with decreased adipocyte differentiation and lipogenesis and enhanced hepatic lipogenesis. Insulin resistance in such mice is associated with reduced insulin signalling and enhanced inflammation in adipose tissue. In human, we show that GPR120 expression in adipose tissue is significantly higher in obese individuals than in lean controls. GPR120 exon sequencing in obese subjects reveals a deleterious non-synonymous mutation (p.R270H) that inhibits GPR120 signalling activity. Furthermore, the p.R270H variant increases the risk of obesity in European populations. Overall, this study demonstrates that the lipid sensor GPR120 has a key role in sensing dietary fat and, therefore, in the control of energy balance in both humans and rodents."
https://openalex.org/W2108615748,"The extent to which the three-dimensional organization of the genome contributes to chromosomal translocations is an important question in cancer genomics. We generated a high-resolution Hi-C spatial organization map of the G1-arrested mouse pro-B cell genome and used high-throughput genome-wide translocation sequencing to map translocations from target DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) within it. RAG endonuclease-cleaved antigen-receptor loci are dominant translocation partners for target DSBs regardless of genomic position, reflecting high-frequency DSBs at these loci and their colocalization in a fraction of cells. To directly assess spatial proximity contributions, we normalized genomic DSBs via ionizing radiation. Under these conditions, translocations were highly enriched in cis along single chromosomes containing target DSBs and within other chromosomes and subchromosomal domains in a manner directly related to pre-existing spatial proximity. By combining two high-throughput genomic methods in a genetically tractable system, we provide a new lens for viewing cancer genomes."
https://openalex.org/W1979892065,"Differential methylation of the two parental genomes in placental mammals is essential for genomic imprinting and embryogenesis. To systematically study this epigenetic process, we have generated a base-resolution, allele-specific DNA methylation (ASM) map in the mouse genome. We find parent-of-origin dependent (imprinted) ASM at 1,952 CG dinucleotides. These imprinted CGs form 55 discrete clusters including virtually all known germline differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and 23 previously unknown DMRs, with some occurring at microRNA genes. We also identify sequence-dependent ASM at 131,765 CGs. Interestingly, methylation at these sites exhibits a strong dependence on the immediate adjacent bases, allowing us to define a conserved sequence preference for the mammalian DNA methylation machinery. Finally, we report a surprising presence of non-CG methylation in the adult mouse brain, with some showing evidence of imprinting. Our results provide a resource for understanding the mechanisms of imprinting and allele-specific gene expression in mammalian cells."

Here, we present the crystal structures of constitutive proteasomes and immunoproteasomes from mouse in the presence and absence of the epoxyketone inhibitor PR-957 (ONX 0914) at 2.9 Å resolution. Based on our X-ray data, we propose a unique catalytic feature for the immunoproteasome subunit β5i/LMP7. Comparison of ligand-free and ligand-bound proteasomes reveals conformational changes in the S1 pocket of β5c/X but not β5i, thereby explaining the selectivity of PR-957 for β5i. Time-resolved structures of yeast proteasome:PR-957 complexes indicate that ligand docking to the active site occurs only via the reactive head group and the P1 side chain. Together, our results support structure-guided design of inhibitory lead structures selective for immunoproteasomes that are linked to cytokine production and diseases like cancer and autoimmune disorders.

These peptides may be derived from intracellular self-proteins or have foreign viral or bacterial origin, but all are products of protein degradation by the 20S proteasome core particle (CP) (Grant et al., 1995Grant E.P.

Med. 1988; 168: 1211-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). When a cytotoxic T cell binds to an immunogenic foreign peptide, embedded in the groove of MHC-I molecules, it is activated to kill the infected antigen-presenting cell (Rock and Goldberg, 1999Rock K.L.

The T cell subsequently releases cytokines, particularly tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ, that induce the expression of three specialized, catalytically active proteasomal β-subunits, designated β1i/LMP2, β2i/MECL-1, and β5i/LMP7 (Aki et al., 1994Aki M.

These immunoproteasome subunits (i-subunits) cooperatively assemble into nascent CPs, effectively substituting their constitutive counterparts (c-subunits) β1c/Y, β2c/Z, and β5c/X, respectively. Consequently, the de novo synthesis of CPs in inflamed tissues is largely in the form of immunoproteasomes (iCPs) (Griffin et al., 1998Griffin T.A. Nandi D. Cruz M. Fehling H.J. Kaer L.V. Monaco J.J.

Whereas iCP expression is inducible in most tissues, it is constitutive in hematopoetic cells, especially lymphocytes and monocytes. Moreover, in cortical thymic epithelial cells, a third class of mammalian proteasome, the so-called thymoproteasome (tCP), is expressed, which bears the subunit β5t and is involved in the positive selection of developing T cells (Murata et al., 2007Murata S. Sasaki K. Kishimoto T. Niwa S. Hayashi H. Takahama Y. Tanaka K. Regulation of CD8+ T cell development by thymus-specific proteasomes.Science. 2007; 316: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). As a result of their different subunit compositions, constitutive proteasomes (cCPs), iCPs, and tCPs are endowed with different cleavage specificities; for example, iCPs preferentially hydrolyze proteins after nonpolar amino acids (Gaczynska et al., 1994Gaczynska M. Rock K.L. Spies T. Goldberg A.L. Peptidase activities of proteasomes are differentially regulated by the major histocompatibility complex-encoded genes for LMP2 and LMP7.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1994; 91: 9213-9217Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The peptides produced by iCPs further stimulate the immune system, as their hydrophobic C termini are perfect anchor motifs for binding to MHC-I molecules (Romero et al., 1991Romero P. Corradin G. Luescher I.F. Maryanski J.L. H-2Kd-restricted antigenic peptides share a simple binding motif.J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, it has been shown in gene-targeted mice that the i-subunits are not essential for epitope presentation in general, implying that the cCP is also to a considerable extent competent in antigen processing (Van den Eynde and Morel, 2001Van den Eynde B.J.

MHC-encoded proteasome subunits LMP2 and LMP7 are not required for efficient antigen presentation.J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1163-1170PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies reported that β5i plays a pivotal role in cytokine production, and that small-molecule inhibitors of this subunit have therapeutic activity in mouse models of autoimmune diseases and inflammatory disorders (Basler et al., 2010Basler M. Dajee M. Moll C. Groettrup M. Kirk C.J. Prevention of experimental colitis by a selective inhibitor of the immunoproteasome.J.

Med. 2009; 15: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Thus, selective inhibition of the iCP subunit β5i represents a promising therapeutic alternative to the approved proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, which often causes neurotoxicity (Badros et al., 2007Badros A. Goloubeva O. Dalal J.S. Can I. Thompson J. Rapoport A.P. Heyman M. Akpek G. Fenton R.G. Neurotoxicity of bortezomib therapy in multiple myeloma: a single-center experience and review of the literature.Cancer. 2007; 110: 1042-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Currently, the irreversibly acting epoxyketone PR-957 is the most potent β5i-selective inhibitor (Muchamuel et al., 2009Muchamuel T. Basler M. Aujay M.A. Suzuki E. Kalim K.W. Lauer C. Sylvain C. Ring E.R. Shields J. Jiang J. et al.A selective inhibitor of the immunoproteasome subunit LMP7 blocks cytokine production and attenuates progression of experimental arthritis.Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), but the molecular basis for its selectivity has remained elusive up to now. Here, we examine the murine cCP and iCP at the molecular level and provide structural explanations for the enhanced MHC-I antigen generation by iCPs. Moreover, X-ray structures of the mouse cCP and iCP as well as the CP from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yCP) in the presence and absence of PR-957 (ONX 0914) revealed the basis for the β5i selectivity of this compound. Preparations of iCPs were isolated from livers of BALB/c mice 8 days after infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), and cCPs were purified from livers of uninfected β2i−/− β5i−/− gene-targeted mice (Khan et al., 2001Khan S. van den Broek M.

After assessment of their purity by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Figure S1 available online), both proteins were crystallized from conditions containing 2,4-methyl-pentanediol (MPD). Diffraction data of native crystals and crystals soaked with the epoxyketone inhibitor PR-957 were recorded to a maximum resolution of 2.9 Å.

Electron density maps proved that each subunit was well defined and that all catalytically active sites of both cCP and iCP showed full occupancy of PR-957. Positive and negative Fo-Fc maps clearly depicted expected sequence changes from c- to i-subunits, allowing us to assign amino acid side chains unambiguously (Figure 2). Residue numbers were allocated on the basis of the alignment to the β-subunit of Thermoplasma acidophilum (Figure 1 and Data S1) (Löwe et al., 1995Löwe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W.

(C) Alignment of β5-subunits according to (A). See also Data S1. To explore the docking and the two-step reaction mechanism of epoxyketones, yCP crystals were soaked with two different concentrations of PR-957, and X-ray data were evaluated as previously reported (Groll and Huber, 2005Groll M. Huber R. Purification, crystallization, and X-ray analysis of the yeast 20S proteasome.Methods Enzymol. 2005; 398: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (Table S2). The quaternary structures of the cCP and iCP differ only in the substitution of the c-subunits β1c, β2c, and β5c by their i-counterparts β1i, β2i, and β5i (Figure 3A). The entry gates to the central proteolytic chambers are closed by the N termini of the α-subunits, and superposition of the α-rings from cCP and iCP reveals high structural similarity (rmsd Cα-rings < 0.59 Å) (Figure S2). Thus, we speculate that regulation of the gating mechanism by activator complexes such as 19S, 11S (PA28), and PA200 is similar in cCPs and iCPs. Structural superposition of identical α-subunits and inactive β-subunits from both proteasome types shows an rmsd of <0.35 Å for the Cα backbone. Remarkably, the main chain tracings of exchangeable c- and i-β-subunits also match almost perfectly (rmsd < 0.72 Å) (Figure 3B), despite the differences in their primary structures (sequence identity of β1c/β1i: 63.3%; β2c/β2i: 58.9%; β5c/β5i: 72.4%). Most amino acid substitutions between murine c- and i-subunits are surface exposed, and comparison of the primary sequences of all known c- and i-subunits reveals that only a few substitutions occur in all species (β1i: 13.6%; β2i: 5.1%; β5i: 9.8%; Data S1B, S1D, and S1F). Moreover, the number of interactions that create contact surfaces between neighboring subunits varies from cCP to iCP (Table S3), but their influence on the overall stability of the complexes cannot be clarified from a structural point of view. Substrate affinities toward proteasome active sites are solely determined by enthalpic interactions with the primed and unprimed substrate-binding channels (Figure 3C). Whereas subunits β2i and β2c are identical with respect to their primed pockets, subunit β1i is shortened by one residue in the region 113–124 compared to β1c (Figure 2A ). This deletion is consistent among all β1i-subunits sequenced thus far and represents a hallmark feature that changes the possible contact sites for bound substrates. Similarly, the substitutions S115D and E116N in subunit β5i may affect cleavage preferences, but these residues are not conserved among species. Compared to the primed pockets, the unprimed substrate-binding channels are far better characterized and can be subdivided in S1, S2, and S3 specificity sites (Figure 3C ). Subunit β2i is the only i-subunit that is not encoded on the MHC cluster; interestingly, its substrate-binding channel was found to be identical with that of β2c, except for the substitution of Asp53 (β2c) with Glu (β2i). Furthermore, no differences were observed in the ligand-free and ligand-bound states (Figures S3A–S3D ). Thus, the rationale for the incorporation of subunit β2i into the iCP remains elusive, and β2-subunits may play an additional functional role that has yet to be described.Figure S3Structural Insights into the Substrate-Binding Channels of the Murine Active c- and i-Subunits, Related to Figure 4Show full captionResidues Thr1 and Gly47 are colored in black and amino acid changes compared to the c-/i-counterpart are highlighted in magenta.

In contrast to the consistent character of subunits β2c and β2i, several important distinctions were observed upon comparison of β1c and β1i. The conserved substitutions T20V, T31F, R45L, and T52A in β1i increase the hydrophobicity of the S1 pocket and diminish it in size (Figure S3E). Consequently, peptide bond hydrolysis preferentially occurs after small, hydrophobic, and branched residues and more epitopes with nonpolar C termini, such as Ile, Leu, or Val, are generated for the presentation on MHC-I molecules (Cardozo and Kohanski, 1998Cardozo C. Kohanski R.A. Altered properties of the branched chain amino acid-preferring activity contribute to increased cleavages after branched chain residues by the “immunoproteasome”.J. Biol.

This agrees with the specific cleavage of the fluorogenic model substrate Ac-PAL-AMC (Acetate-Pro-Ala-Leu-7-amino-methylcoumarin) by β1i (Blackburn et al., 2010Blackburn C. Gigstad K.M. Hales P. Garcia K. Jones M. Bruzzese F.J. Barrett C. Liu J.X. Soucy T.A.

J. 2010; 430: 461-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Apart from the S1 pocket, the amino acid substitutions T22A and A27V in β1i, as well as Y114H in the adjacent β2i-subunit, collectively shape, downsize, and polarize the S3 site of the β1i entity (Figure S3E). In the S1 pockets of the subunits β5c and β5i, the residues that give rise to chymotrypsin-like (ChTL) activity, Ala20, Met45, Ala49, and Cys52, are unchanged. Only amino acid 31 is variable in size but conserved in its hydrophobic character (Figure S3I and Data S1F). In contrast to β5c-subunits, all known β5i entities harbor a shallow S2 pocket in position 48 formed by Cys or Ser. The substitution of Ala27 (β5c) by Ser (β5i) restricts the size of the S3 pocket of murine and human β5i and endows it with a more hydrophilic character compared to subunit β5c (Figure S3I). In addition to these amino acid changes, the S1 pockets of β5c and β5i vary in their size. Distinct conformations of Met45 result in a spacious S1 pocket in β5i and a significantly smaller one in β5c (Figure S3I). Formation of a large S1 pocket, similar to chymotrypsin, is favored by strong van der Waals interactions of Met45 with the aliphatic side chain of Gln53. Whereas Gln53 is conserved in β5i-subunits, it is replaced in β5c-subunits by Ser, which cannot stabilize Met45 by hydrophobic interactions. As a result, β5c harbors a much smaller S1 pocket and thereby resembles elastase-like activity rather than ChTL activity. In addition, residue Lys32 (β5c)/Asn32 (β5i) may also be crucial for the distinct architecture of the S1 pocket in β5c and β5i. Although the yCP contains Gln53 in yβ5, its interaction with Met45 is less dominant than in β5i; hence, Met45 adopts the same conformation as observed in β5c. From a structural perspective, yβ5 represents a chimera between β5c and β5i, as for example Lys32 is conserved in β5c-subunits and Gln53 in β5i entities. The hydrophilicity surrounding the active site nucleophilic Thr1Oγ and the oxyanion hole of subunit β5i is increased by the strictly conserved amino acid exchanges A46S and V127T. This elevated polarity might favor peptide bond hydrolysis by attracting water molecules. Moreover, the electron density displays a unique hydrogen bond network involving Gly47NH, as well as Ser46Oγ and Thr127Oγ (Figures 4C, 4E , and S3I). Because Ser46Oγ is directly hydrogen bridged to the oxyanion hole Gly47NH (3.1 Å), it may contribute to the stabilization of the tetrahedral transition state during catalysis. This molecular feature is unique to β5i and could kinetically favor its proteolytic activity. In contrast to prominent proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma and equally targeting the active sites of both β5c and β5i, PR-957 preferentially inhibits subunit β5i of iCPs (Muchamuel et al., 2009Muchamuel T. Basler M. Aujay M.A. Suzuki E. Kalim K.W. Lauer C. Sylvain C. Ring E.R. Shields J.

Med. 2009; 15: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) (Figures 4A, 5, and S4). However, elucidation of the molecular basis for the selectivity of PR-957 requires the structural comparison of its binding to all active c- and i-subunits. Using inhibitor concentrations in the mM range for crystal soaking experiments, PR-957 targeted all active sites of the iCP and cCP (Muchamuel et al., 2009Muchamuel T. Basler M. Aujay M.A. Suzuki E. Kalim K.W. Lauer C. Sylvain C. Ring E.R. Shields J.

Notably, although subunit β7 was suggested to harbor an active site in the bovine cCP apo-crystal structure (Unno et al., 2002Unno M. Mizushima T. Morimoto Y. Tomisugi Y. Tanaka K. Yasuoka N.

https://openalex.org/W2019523818,"Repetitive activation of specific circuitry in the motor cortex during motor learning can induce new clusters of dendritic spines to form, which are preferentially stabilized during prolonged learning sessions. Learning and memory are thought to involve physical and functional changes to neuronal connections, but relatively little is known about structural changes to behaviour-relevant circuits. Two new studies highlight some of the physical alterations and mechanisms that may underlie learning and neural plasticity. Lai et al. analysed neurons participating in fear circuits: they found that fear learning induced a loss of dendritic spines, and that extinction of the fear caused a regrowth of spines in the same areas. Fu et al. reveal that repetitive activation of specific circuitry during motor learning can induce formation of new clusters of dendritic spines, which remain throughout prolonged learning sessions. Many lines of evidence suggest that memory in the mammalian brain is stored with distinct spatiotemporal patterns1,2. Despite recent progresses in identifying neuronal populations involved in memory coding3,4,5, the synapse-level mechanism is still poorly understood. Computational models and electrophysiological data have shown that functional clustering of synapses along dendritic branches leads to nonlinear summation of synaptic inputs and greatly expands the computing power of a neural network6,7,8,9,10. However, whether neighbouring synapses are involved in encoding similar memory and how task-specific cortical networks develop during learning remain elusive. Using transcranial two-photon microscopy11, we followed apical dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the motor cortex while mice practised novel forelimb skills. Here we show that a third of new dendritic spines (postsynaptic structures of most excitatory synapses) formed during the acquisition phase of learning emerge in clusters, and that most such clusters are neighbouring spine pairs. These clustered new spines are more likely to persist throughout prolonged learning sessions, and even long after training stops, than non-clustered counterparts. Moreover, formation of new spine clusters requires repetition of the same motor task, and the emergence of succedent new spine(s) accompanies the strengthening of the first new spine in the cluster. We also show that under control conditions new spines appear to avoid existing stable spines, rather than being uniformly added along dendrites. However, succedent new spines in clusters overcome such a spatial constraint and form in close vicinity to neighbouring stable spines. Our findings suggest that clustering of new synapses along dendrites is induced by repetitive activation of the cortical circuitry during learning, providing a structural basis for spatial coding of motor memory in the mammalian brain."
https://openalex.org/W2051899340,"Transduction of mechanical stimuli by receptor cells is essential for senses such as hearing, touch and pain. Ion channels have a role in neuronal mechanotransduction in invertebrates; however, functional conservation of these ion channels in mammalian mechanotransduction is not observed. For example, no mechanoreceptor potential C (NOMPC), a member of transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel family, acts as a mechanotransducer in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans; however, it has no orthologues in mammals. Degenerin/epithelial sodium channel (DEG/ENaC) family members are mechanotransducers in C. elegans and potentially in D. melanogaster; however, a direct role of its mammalian homologues in sensing mechanical force has not been shown. Recently, Piezo1 (also known as Fam38a) and Piezo2 (also known as Fam38b) were identified as components of mechanically activated channels in mammals. The Piezo family are evolutionarily conserved transmembrane proteins. It is unknown whether they function in mechanical sensing in vivo and, if they do, which mechanosensory modalities they mediate. Here we study the physiological role of the single Piezo member in D. melanogaster (Dmpiezo; also known as CG8486). Dmpiezo expression in human cells induces mechanically activated currents, similar to its mammalian counterparts. Behavioural responses to noxious mechanical stimuli were severely reduced in Dmpiezo knockout larvae, whereas responses to another noxious stimulus or touch were not affected. Knocking down Dmpiezo in sensory neurons that mediate nociception and express the DEG/ENaC ion channel pickpocket (ppk) was sufficient to impair responses to noxious mechanical stimuli. Furthermore, expression of Dmpiezo in these same neurons rescued the phenotype of the constitutive Dmpiezo knockout larvae. Accordingly, electrophysiological recordings from ppk-positive neurons revealed a Dmpiezo-dependent, mechanically activated current. Finally, we found that Dmpiezo and ppk function in parallel pathways in ppk-positive cells, and that mechanical nociception is abolished in the absence of both channels. These data demonstrate the physiological relevance of the Piezo family in mechanotransduction in vivo, supporting a role of Piezo proteins in mechanosensory nociception."
https://openalex.org/W1974798136,"Medulloblastoma, the most common malignant paediatric brain tumour, arises in the cerebellum and disseminates through the cerebrospinal fluid in the leptomeningeal space to coat the brain and spinal cord. Dissemination, a marker of poor prognosis, is found in up to 40% of children at diagnosis and in most children at the time of recurrence. Affected children therefore are treated with radiation to the entire developing brain and spinal cord, followed by high-dose chemotherapy, with the ensuing deleterious effects on the developing nervous system. The mechanisms of dissemination through the cerebrospinal fluid are poorly studied, and medulloblastoma metastases have been assumed to be biologically similar to the primary tumour. Here we show that in both mouse and human medulloblastoma, the metastases from an individual are extremely similar to each other but are divergent from the matched primary tumour. Clonal genetic events in the metastases can be demonstrated in a restricted subclone of the primary tumour, suggesting that only rare cells within the primary tumour have the ability to metastasize. Failure to account for the bicompartmental nature of metastatic medulloblastoma could be a major barrier to the development of effective targeted therapies."

We carried out a genome-wide siRNA-based screen in human cells. Among positive regulators of HR we identified networks of DNA-damage-response and pre-mRNA-processing proteins, and among negative regulators we identified a phosphatase network. Three candidate proteins localized to DNA lesions, including RBMX, a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein that has a role in alternative splicing. RBMX accumulated at DNA lesions through multiple domains in a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1-dependent manner and promoted HR by facilitating proper BRCA2 expression. Our screen also revealed that off-target depletion of RAD51 is a common source of RNAi false positives, raising a cautionary note for siRNA screens and RNAi-based studies of HR."

We report on the identification of an adamantyl urea compound that shows potent bactericidal activity against M. tuberculosis and a unique mode of action, namely the abolition of the translocation of mycolic acids from the cytoplasm, where they are synthesized to the periplasmic side of the plasma membrane and are in turn transferred onto cell wall arabinogalactan or used in the formation of virulence-associated, outer membrane, trehalose-containing glycolipids.

https://openalex.org/W2129692964,"Human neurodegenerative diseases have the temporal hallmark of afflicting the elderly population. Ageing is one of the most prominent factors to influence disease onset and progression, yet little is known about the molecular pathways that connect these processes. To understand this connection it is necessary to identify the pathways that functionally integrate ageing, chronic maintenance of the brain and modulation of neurodegenerative disease. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are emerging as critical factors in gene regulation during development; however, their role in adult-onset, age-associated processes is only beginning to be revealed. Here we report that the conserved miRNA miR-34 regulates age-associated events and long-term brain integrity in Drosophila, providing a molecular link between ageing and neurodegeneration. Fly mir-34 expression exhibits adult-onset, brain-enriched and age-modulated characteristics. Whereas mir-34 loss triggers a gene profile of accelerated brain ageing, late-onset brain degeneration and a catastrophic decline in survival, mir-34 upregulation extends median lifespan and mitigates neurodegeneration induced by human pathogenic polyglutamine disease protein. Some of the age-associated effects of miR-34 require adult-onset translational repression of Eip74EF, an essential ETS domain transcription factor involved in steroid hormone pathways. Our studies indicate that miRNA-dependent pathways may have an impact on adult-onset, age-associated events by silencing developmental genes that later have a deleterious influence on adult life cycle and disease, and highlight fly miR-34 as a key miRNA with a role in this process."

Although natural selection operating on cancers favors the outgrowth of malignant clones with replicative immortality, the continued survival of a cancer is generally restricted by the life span of its host. Tasmanian devil facial tumor disease (DFTD) is an unusual cancer that has survived beyond the death of the individual that spawned it by acquiring adaptations for transmission between hosts. This cancer has spread through the Tasmanian devil population and is threatening the species with extinction (Hawkins et al., 2006Hawkins C.E. Baars C. Hesterman H. Hocking G.J. Jones M.E. Lazenby B.

The genomes of the Tasmanian devil and its transmissible cancer, DFTD, are thus of interest both from the perspective of conservation of a threatened species as well as for the insights they may provide into the origins, somatic evolution and population genetics of an extraordinarily divergent neoplastic clonal lineage. The Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) is a marsupial carnivore endemic to the island of Tasmania, Australia. Tasmanian devils are solitary nocturnal scavengers that weigh up to 12 kg and generally live for 5 or 6 years in the wild (Owen and Pemberton, 2005Owen D. Pemberton D. Tasmanian Devil: A Unique and Threatened Animal. Allen & Unwin, Crows Nest, Australia2005Google Scholar). They are seasonal breeders and females rear a maximum of four pouch young each year (Owen and Pemberton, 2005Owen D. Pemberton D. Tasmanian Devil: A Unique and Threatened Animal. Allen & Unwin, Crows Nest, Australia2005Google Scholar). The species has limited genetic diversity, although three genetically distinct geographically defined subpopulations have been described (Jones et al., 2004Jones M.E. Paetkau D. Geffen E. Moritz C.

The mechanism whereby the clone avoids immune rejection during colonization of allogeneic hosts remains unknown. Although low genetic diversity may contribute to DFTD susceptibility, experiments have indicated that devils are normally capable of mounting immune reactions to allogeneic grafts (Kreiss et al., 2011Kreiss A.

DFTD is one of two known naturally occurring clonally transmissible cancers, the other being the canine transmissible venereal tumor (CTVT) of dogs (Murchison, 2009Murchison E.P. Clonally transmissible cancers in dogs and Tasmanian devils.Oncogene. 2009; 27: S19-S30Google Scholar). CTVT is a sexually transmitted lineage that is found around that world and that may have first arisen thousands of years ago from the cells of a wolf or East Asian breed of dog (Murgia et al., 2006Murgia C.

Genetic analysis of the global diversity of CTVT cancers has indicated that the lineage has achieved considerable heterogeneity, with substantial lineage diversity present worldwide (Murgia et al., 2006Murgia C.

Divergence time estimates suggest that modern CTVT may represent a recent global sweep of an ancient lineage (Rebbeck et al., 2009Rebbeck C.A. Thomas R. Breen M. Leroi A.M. Burt A. Origins and evolution of a transmissible cancer.Evolution. 2009; 63: 2340-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In contrast to CTVT, little is known of the population diversity of DFTD or the dynamics of its spread through its host population. Cancer genomes are characterized by somatic changes including single-base substitution mutations, small insertions and deletions (indels), structural rearrangements, and copy number alterations. Analysis of the catalog of somatic mutations in cancer genomes can lead to greater understanding of the mutational events that triggered clonal outgrowth and the exposures or DNA repair defects that were responsible for the mutations in the first place (Pleasance et al., 2010aPleasance E.D. Cheetham R.K. Stephens P.J. McBride D.J. Humphray S.J. Greenman C.D. Varela I. Lin M.L. Ordóñez G.R.

DFTD is a transmissible clone that has spread through the devil population in a process similar to metastasis. Its widely divergent lineage as a malignant clone make it an almost unique model for studying the genomic stability and long term evolution of cancer cells. We have sequenced, assembled, and annotated the normal genome of the Tasmanian devil, and we have used this reference to analyze the genomes of a second normal Tasmanian devil and two geographically distant DFTD cancer subclones. In addition, we have analyzed the genetic diversity present in 104 DFTD tumors collected from distant locations throughout Tasmania over a period of 7 years. Our analysis has led to the identification of genetic features of the original devil that gave rise to DFTD, a description of the underlying mutational processes that have characterized DFTD progression, annotation of gene variants that may have contributed to DFTD pathogenesis, and a map of the clonal dynamics of the disease during its spread through Tasmania. To generate a reference genome for the Tasmanian devil, we sequenced and assembled the genome of a 5-year-old female Tasmanian devil. Sequencing libraries were prepared from genomic DNA extracted from a cell line derived from normal fibroblasts. These were sequenced from both ends, yielding 2.87 × 109 pairs of 100 bp sequence reads. Additional “mate pair” libraries, produced by circularising genomic DNA fragments of between 3 kilobase pairs (kb) and 10 kb in length, were generated and 50 bp was sequenced from both ends in order to assist with genome assembly. The genome was assembled with the Phusion2 assembly pipeline (Mullikin and Ning, 2003Mullikin J.C. Ning Z. The phusion assembler.Genome Res. 2003; 13: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and assembly features are summarized in Table 1. We estimated the size of the Tasmanian devil genome to be between 2.89 and 3.17 gigabase pairs (Gb) using both sequencing and flow cytometry data (Table S1 and Figure S1 available online). This is comparable with previous estimates of the Tasmanian devil and other marsupial genome sizes (Mikkelsen et al., 2007Mikkelsen T.S. Wakefield M.J. Aken B. Amemiya C.T. Chang J.L. Duke S.

The Tasmanian devil genome has a G+C content of 36.4%, similar to that of the opossum (37.8%) but lower than that of humans (45.2%).Table 1Tasmanian Devil Genome Assembly FeaturesContigsSupercontigsTotal number237,29135,974Total number of bases2.93 Gb3.17 GbN50 contig/supercontig size20,139 bp1,847,186 bpLargest contig/supercontig189,866 bp5,315,556 bpAverage size12,354 bp88,254 bpSee also Table S1 and Figure S1 for further details of Tasmanian devil genome size estimates and Table S2 for a summary of in silico chromosome assignment. Open table in a new tab See also Table S1 and Figure S1 for further details of Tasmanian devil genome size estimates and Table S2 for a summary of in silico chromosome assignment. To determine the chromosomal locations of our assembled contigs, we individually sorted each of the seven Tasmanian devil chromosomes from the female devil fibroblast cell line using a flow cytometer. Fifty thousand copies of each devil chromosome were collected, amplified, and sequenced. Alignment of the chromosome reads with the assembled contigs was used to assign the contigs to chromosomes; in addition, this method was used to detect and correct assembly errors by identifying contigs with homology to more than one chromosome. Using this method, we were able to assign 35,534 supercontigs (99%) to chromosomes. The number of bases assigned to each chromosome correlated with the flow cytometry measurement of chromosome DNA content (Table S2). Tasmanian devil chromosomes were named according to the system described by Pearse and Swift (Pearse and Swift, 2006Pearse A.M. Swift K. Allograft theory: transmission of devil facial-tumour disease.Nature. 2006; 439: 549Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), which differs in the naming of chromosomes 1 and 2 to a previous karyotype nomenclature for devils (Eldridge and Metcalf, 2006Eldridge M.D.B.

Quantitative comparisons between the karyotypes of Australian marsupials from three different superfamilies.Chromosoma. 1967; 20: 290-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We used cross-species chromosome painting to determine the homology between devil and opossum chromosomes (Figure S2). We then used conservation with the opossum genome as a template for ordering supercontigs on each devil chromosome. Tasmanian devil genes were identified using the Ensembl genome annotation pipeline (Curwen et al., 2004Curwen V. Eyras E. Andrews T.D. Clarke L. Mongin E. Searle S.M. Clamp M. The Ensembl automatic gene annotation system.Genome Res. 2004; 14: 942-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, Potter et al., 2004Potter S.C. Clarke L. Curwen V. Keenan S. Mongin E. Searle S.M. Stabenau A. Storey R. Clamp M. The Ensembl analysis pipeline.Genome Res. 2004; 14: 934-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), modified to incorporate devil transcriptome data. In total 18,775 protein-coding gene models were constructed, 1,213 of which did not have orthologs in the human or opossum genomes. We specifically searched the Tasmanian devil genome for a set of 451 genes that have been causally linked with cancer in humans (Futreal et al., 2004Futreal P.A. Coin L. Marshall M. Down T. Hubbard T. Wooster R. Rahman N. Stratton M.R. A census of human cancer genes.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (2418) Google Scholar). Orthologs for 398 of these genes could be detected in the Tasmanian devil genome. Three hundred sixty-three microRNAs (miRNAs) were annotated in the Tasmanian devil genome by aligning small RNA sequence reads (Murchison et al., 2010Murchison E.P. Tovar C. Hsu A. Bender H.S. Kheradpour P. Rebbeck C.A. Obendorf D. Conlan C. Bahlo M. Blizzard C.A. et al.The Tasmanian devil transcriptome reveals Schwann cell origins of a clonally transmissible cancer.Science. 2010; 327: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). One hundred nineteen predicted miRNAs were devil orthologs of previously identified miRNAs and 244 were predicted novel miRNAs. We conducted cytogenetic analyses and sequenced the genomes of two DFTD cell lines, 87T and 53T, from geographically different regions of Tasmania (Figure 2A ). 87T is derived from a tumor from a devil captured in 2007 in southeast Tasmania, and 53T was established in 2007 from a lung metastasis in a devil from the north coast of Tasmania. Alignment of the DFTD cancer cell line genomes with the reference genome yielded 691,328 and 699,156 single base substitutions in 87T and 53T, respectively, and 317,240 and 307,613 indels in 87T and 53T, respectively (Figure 2B). The number of variants in the DFTD genomes was somewhat higher than the number of variants observed in the normal female devil, and in a second normal male genome sequenced to assess normal variation (Figure 2B). This is not surprising, given that the DFTD genome contains variants that were present in the constitutional genome of the devil that first gave rise to the DFTD clone (the founder devil), as well as somatic variants that have arisen since DFTD has been a malignant clonal lineage (Figure 2B). These estimates are consistent with previous studies (Miller et al., 2011Miller, W., Hayes, V.M., Ratan, A., Petersen, D.C., Wittekindt, N.E., Miller, J., Walenz, B., Knight, J., Qi, J., Zhao, F., et al. (2011). Genetic diversity and population structure of the endangered marsupial Sarcophilus harrisii (Tasmanian devil). Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.Google Scholar). Cytogenetic analyses indicated that the two DFTD subclones have differences in their karyotypes (Figure 2A). 87T is pseudodiploid with 13 chromosomes, whereas 53T is pseudotetraploid with 32 chromosomes. We used labeled flow-sorted chromosomes derived from a normal devil cell line as probes for forward chromosome painting of 87T. This experiment revealed several cytogenetic changes in DFTD (Figures 2C and 2D). Reverse chromosome painting, using labeled DNAs derived from flow-sorted chromosomes from 87T, provided further insights into the translocations in 87T and revealed heterozygous deletions on chromosomes 1, 2, and 3, as well as trisomy 5p (Figure 2E). Copy number analysis indicated that 87T has few detectable hemizygous deletions and no detectable high-level amplifications (Figure 2F and Figure S3). These analyses indicate that the DFTD genome contains substitutions, indels, copy number changes, and rearrangements. We next devised methods to identify subsets of variants of germline origin (i.e., those that were present in the constitutional genome of the founder devil) and those of somatic origin (i.e., those that arose during clonal proliferation of the DFTD lineage) in order to investigate the origin and somatic evolution of the DFTD clone. DFTD was first observed in 1996 in northeast Tasmania (Hawkins et al., 2006Hawkins C.E. Baars C. Hesterman H. Hocking G.J. Jones M.E. Lazenby B. Mann D. Mooney N. Pemberton D. Pyecroft S. et al.Emerging disease and population decline of an island endemic, the Tasmanian devil Sarcophilus harrisii.Biol. Conserv. 2006; 131: 307-324Crossref Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Previous studies have indicated that the cancer is derived from the cells of one devil (the DFTD founder), and has subsequently spread through the devil population as a clone (Pearse and Swift, 2006Pearse A.M. Swift K. Allograft theory: transmission of devil facial-tumour disease.Nature. 2006; 439: 549Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). We do not have DNA from the founder's normal genome, as this animal was a wild Tasmanian devil that lived and probably died prior to 1996. However, variants from this devil's constitutional genome remain within the DFTD cells that make up the tumors of thousands of devils. We sought to reconstruct the genome of the founder devil by searching for common variants between the genomes of the two DFTD subclones, 87T and 53T. These variants will include normal variation that was present in the founder's genome as well as somatic variants in DFTD that arose prior to divergence of the 87T and 53T lineages. We found 700,436 common single base substitutions and 251,257 common indels between 87T and 53T (Figure 2B). At least 563,877 single-base substitution variants and 235,610 indels are likely to be the founder's germline variants, as we also found them in either the female or male normal devil genomes. The remaining 136,559 substitutions and 14,647 indels will include private germline variants that were specific to the founder devil and not found in the two normal genomes that we sequenced as well as somatic mutations that have been acquired by the DFTD lineage. The gender of the founder devil is unknown. Like other marsupials, Tasmanian devils have X and Y sex chromosomes, and males are the heterogametic sex. Previous studies have indicated that neither of the sex chromosomes is cytogenetically identifiable in DFTD (Pearse and Swift, 2006Pearse A.M. Swift K. Allograft theory: transmission of devil facial-tumour disease.Nature. 2006; 439: 549Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). It is possible that the sex chromosomes initially present in the constitutional genome of the founder devil have been lost during DFTD carcinogenesis or that these chromosomes have been rearranged in the DFTD genome such that they are not cytogenetically identifiable. We first searched for the presence of the Y chromosome gene SRY in DFTD. As expected, the SRY gene could be amplified from the genome of a male devil but not from a female devil; however, our assays could not detect SRY in the DFTD genome (Figure 3A ). We next searched for evidence of the X chromosome in the DFTD genome. Reverse chromosome painting experiments and copy number analysis of 87T indicated that the X chromosome is present in approximately two copies in this genome (Figure 2 and Figure S3). These are likely to be a homologous pair rather than recent duplicates, as the number of single-base substitution variants mapping to the X chromosome in the two DFTD genomes was comparable to the number of variants found on the X chromosome in the female normal devil genome and approximately double the number of X chromosome variants found in the male normal genome (Figure 3B). The data therefore suggest that the DFTD founder devil was a female. DFTD was first observed in northeast Tasmania (Hawkins et al., 2006Hawkins C.E. Baars C. Hesterman H. Hocking G.J. Jones M.E. Lazenby B. Mann D. Mooney N. Pemberton D. Pyecroft S. et al.Emerging disease and population decline of an island endemic, the Tasmanian devil Sarcophilus harrisii.Biol. Conserv. 2006; 131: 307-324Crossref Scopus (272) Google Scholar). To explore further the geographic origin of the founder devil we sequenced the mitochondrial genomes (excluding the control region) of 92 Tasmanian devils from 25 locations in Tasmania and constructed a phylogenetic tree based on their sequences (Figure 3C). We found evidence for six mitochondrial haplotypes among normal devils. Three of these had widespread distributions throughout Tasmania and three were confined to locations in the northwest of Tasmania, consistent with other studies (Miller et al., 2011Miller, W., Hayes, V.M., Ratan, A., Petersen, D.C., Wittekindt, N.E., Miller, J., Walenz, B., Knight, J., Qi, J., Zhao, F., et al. (2011). Genetic diversity and population structure of the endangered marsupial Sarcophilus harrisii (Tasmanian devil). Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.Google Scholar). The 87T and 53T DFTD mitochondrial genomes were most closely related to one of the widespread devil haplotypes. There is evidence of horizontal transfer of mitochondrial genomes between hosts and cancers in another transmissible cancer lineage, CTVT, which has led to multiple distinct clades of CTVT mitochondrial haplotypes (Rebbeck et al., 2011Rebbeck C.A. Leroi A.M. Burt A. Mitochondrial capture by a transmissible cancer.Science. 2011; 331: 303Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To test whether horizontal transfer of mitochondria occurs in DFTD, we sequenced the mitochondrial genomes of 104 DFTD tumors and included their haplotypes on the phylogenetic tree (Figure 3C). All of the DFTD mitochondria were either identical to or apparently derived from a single devil haplotype, suggesting that they are clonally derived from the founder devil. These analyses suggest that mitochondrial horizontal transfer does not occur or is not widespread in DFTD, and indicate that the founder devil belonged to a haplogroup that i"
https://openalex.org/W2058376258,"Tissue stromal cells interact with leukaemia cells and profoundly affect their viability and drug sensitivity. Here we show a biochemical mechanism by which bone marrow stromal cells modulate the redox status of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cells and promote cellular survival and drug resistance. Primary CLL cells from patients exhibit a limited ability to transport cystine for glutathione (GSH) synthesis owing to a low expression level of Xc-transporter. In contrast, bone marrow stromal cells effectively import cystine and convert it to cysteine, which is then released into the microenvironment for uptake by CLL cells to promote GSH synthesis. The elevated level of GSH enhances leukaemia cell survival and protects them from drug-induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, disabling this protective mechanism significantly sensitizes CLL cells to drug treatment in the stromal environment. This stromal–leukaemia interaction is critical for CLL cell survival and represents a key biochemical pathway for effectively targeting leukaemia cells to overcome drug resistance in vivo. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cells depend on glutathione to counteract their high reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. However, their ability to synthesize this antioxidant is compromised by inefficient cystine uptake. Huang and colleagues now show that bone marrow stromal cells promote leukaemia cell survival by metabolizing cystine to cysteine and releasing it into the microenvironment to be taken up by leukaemia cells."
https://openalex.org/W2151457918,"Colon cancers frequently harbor KRAS mutations, yet only a subset of KRAS mutant colon cancer cell lines are dependent upon KRAS signaling for survival. In a screen for kinases that promote survival of KRAS-dependent colon cancer cells, we found that the TAK1 kinase (MAP3K7) is required for tumor cell viability. The induction of apoptosis by RNAi-mediated depletion or pharmacologic inhibition of TAK1 is linked to its suppression of hyperactivated Wnt signaling, evident in both endogenous and genetically reconstituted cells. In APC mutant/KRAS-dependent cells, KRAS stimulates BMP-7 secretion and BMP signaling, leading to TAK1 activation and enhancement of Wnt-dependent transcription. An in vitro-derived ""TAK1 dependency signature"" is enriched in primary human colon cancers with mutations in both APC and KRAS, suggesting potential clinical utility in stratifying patient populations. Together, these findings identify TAK1 inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy for a treatment-refractory subset of colon cancers exhibiting aberrant KRAS and Wnt pathway activation."
https://openalex.org/W2168203939,"To assess telomerase as a cancer therapeutic target and determine adaptive mechanisms to telomerase inhibition, we modeled telomerase reactivation and subsequent extinction in T cell lymphomas arising in Atm(-/-) mice engineered with an inducible telomerase reverse transcriptase allele. Telomerase reactivation in the setting of telomere dysfunction enabled full malignant progression with alleviation of telomere dysfunction-induced checkpoints. These cancers possessed copy number alterations targeting key loci in human T cell lymphomagenesis. Upon telomerase extinction, tumor growth eventually slowed with reinstatement of telomere dysfunction-induced checkpoints, yet growth subsequently resumed as tumors acquired alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) and aberrant transcriptional networks centering on mitochondrial biology and oxidative defense. ALT+ tumors acquired amplification/overexpression of PGC-1β, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and function, and they showed marked sensitivity to PGC-1β or SOD2 knockdown. Genetic modeling of telomerase extinction reveals vulnerabilities that motivate coincidental inhibition of mitochondrial maintenance and oxidative defense mechanisms to enhance antitelomerase cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2020625439,"Mutations in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway occur in most colorectal cancers (CRCs), and these mutations lead to increased nuclear accumulation of the β-catenin transcriptional co-activator. In the nucleus, β-catenin associates with TCF/LEF sequence specific transcription factors to activate target gene expression. The Hippo pathway restricts cellular growth by preventing nuclear accumulation of the Yes-associated protein (YAP) transcriptional co-activator. YAP expression is elevated in CRCs suggesting that, like Wnt/β-catenin signaling, the Hippo pathway may contribute to colorectal carcinogenesis. Regulation of YAP at the post-translational level has been well studied but the transcription factors that control YAP gene expression are unknown. Here we demonstrate that β-catenin/TCF4 complexes bind a DNA enhancer element within the first intron of the YAP gene to drive YAP expression in CRC cells. As such, reducing β-catenin expression in CRC cells using shRNAs leads to decreased YAP mRNA and protein levels. YAP is abundantly expressed in the cytoplasm and nuclei of several established human colon cancer cell lines and this localization pattern is insensitive to plating density. Finally, we show that YAP expression is elevated in the majority of a panel of primary human colorectal tumors compared with its expression in uninvolved colonic mucosa, and that YAP and β-catenin localize to the nuclear compartment of tumor cells.

The pathway was discovered in D. melanogaster using screens designed to identify genes that negatively regulated tissue growth (9Harvey K.F. Pfleger C.M. Hariharan I.K.

Hippo encodes a Ste-20 family protein kinase that restricts cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis in conjunction with salvador and warts.Cell. 2003; 114: 445-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Mutations in a Ste-20 family protein kinase resulted in cell overgrowth and decreased cell death, and this protein was named Hippo because of the phenotype observed in mosaic flies. YAP is a key effector protein in the Hippo pathway, and its subcellular localization is controlled by phosphorylation. When the Hippo pathway is engaged, activation of a core kinase complex containing Hippo (Mst1/2 in mammals), Lats1/2 kinases, Mob, and Salvador, leads to YAP phosphorylation, and its retention in the cytoplasm through interactions with 14-3-3 proteins. When the Hippo pathway is disengaged, YAP is translocated into the nucleus where it associates with members of the TEA domain containing transcription factors (TEADs). YAP/TEAD complexes activate expression of growth promoting genes including connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and the EGF family member amphiregulin (AREG) (12Zhao B. Ye X. Yu J. Li L. Li W. Li S. Lin J.D. Wang C.Y. Chinnaiyan A.M. Lai Z.C. Guan K.L.

The Hippo/YAP pathway is highly conserved in mammals and as in D. melanogaster, it is required for proper control of organ size. In the mouse, YAP overexpression or conditional deletion of Mst1/2 leads to hepatomegaly (14Camargo F.D. Gokhale S. Johnnidis J.B. Fu D. Bell G.W. Jaenisch R. Brummelkamp T.R.

YAP expression is elevated in human primary colonic tumors compared with its expression in uninvolved tissue and YAP expression is increased in the intestinal tumors that arise in the adenomatous polyposis coli multiple intestinal neoplasia (APCmin) mouse (14Camargo F.D. Gokhale S. Johnnidis J.B. Fu D. Bell G.W. Jaenisch R. Brummelkamp T.R. YAP1 increases organ size and expands undifferentiated progenitor cells.Curr.

Whether YAP is required for increased tumorigenesis in the APCmin mouse model has not been tested; however, YAP is required for growth of human colon cancer cells in colonies (17Zhou D. Zhang Y. Wu H. Barry E. Yin Y. Lawrence E. Dawson D. Willis J.E. Markowitz S.D. Camargo F.D. Avruch J. Mst1 and Mst2 protein kinases restrain intestinal stem cell proliferation and colonic tumorigenesis by inhibition of Yes-associated protein (Yap) overabundance.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: E1312-E1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). While these studies indicate that increased YAP expression correlates with tumorigenesis, mutations in components of the Hippo pathway have not been identified in the colon cancers examined to date. Thus, the molecular mechanisms that explain YAP overexpression in intestinal tumors are incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that β-catenin/TCF4 complexes directly associate with the YAP gene locus and that β-catenin is required for YAP expression in CRC cells. β-Catenin/TCF4 complexes bind a site within the first intron of YAP and a DNA element that harbors this site increased expression of luciferase reporter plasmids in transient assays. We show that YAP promotes CRC cell metabolism, anchorage independent growth in soft agar and tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model. We also find that YAP expression is elevated in primary and metastatic human colorectal tumors. Together, our findings suggest that Wnt/β-catenin and Hippo/YAP signaling pathways converge to promote colon cancer. These results shed light on the potential to target the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway for the development of therapeutics to treat individuals affected by this disease. The human CRC cell lines HCT116, SW620, SW480, RKO, LS174, and HT29 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). HEK293FT cells were obtained from Invitrogen. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 units/ml penicillin, 2 mm Glutamax, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. HEK293FT cells were grown in media supplemented with 500 μg/ml neomycin. ChIP analysis was performed as described (7Bottomly D. Kyler S.L. McWeeney S.K. Yochum G.S. Identification of {β}-catenin binding regions in colon cancer cells using ChIP-Seq.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 5735-5745Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) using 3 μg of anti-β-catenin (BD Transduction, 610154), anti-TCF4 (Millipore, 05–511), and anti-RNAP (Covance, 8WG16/MMS-126R) antibodies. Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by real-time PCR as described (7Bottomly D. Kyler S.L. McWeeney S.K. Yochum G.S. Identification of {β}-catenin binding regions in colon cancer cells using ChIP-Seq.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 5735-5745Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) using primer sequences listed in supplemental Table S1. Data are presented as relative levels obtained using a standard curve generated from formaldehyde fixed, sonicated, and purified input DNA. RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and quantitative PCR (qPCR) were performed as described (7Bottomly D. Kyler S.L. McWeeney S.K. Yochum G.S. Identification of {β}-catenin binding regions in colon cancer cells using ChIP-Seq.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 5735-5745Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) except that cDNA was diluted 1:100 for qPCR. Primer sequences are listed in supplemental Table S1. Relative expression was measured using the 2ΔCT method, and data are represented as fold levels over control. HCT116 genomic DNA was isolated using a DNeasy kit (Qiagen, 69504). A 624 bp element within the first intron of the YAP gene was amplified in a standard PCR reaction containing 300 ng of genomic DNA, and 0.6 μm of the forward and reverse primers listed in supplemental Table S1. The PCR products were subcloned into the pGL3 promoter vector as KpnI- NheI fragments (Promega E1761) using standard molecular biology techniques. The pGL3-YAP mutant (Mut.) construct was derived from pGL3-YAP wild-type (WT) by mutating the TCF motif from CTTTGAT to CGCTGAT using the Stratagene Lightning Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit. For luciferase assays, HCT116 cells were seeded in a 12-well dish in triplicate, and were then transfected the following day using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Each transfection contained 250 ng of the firefly luciferase reporter plasmid, 12.5 ng of pRL-SV40 Renilla luciferase, and the total DNA was adjusted to 2 μg with pBlueScript. Where indicated, 250 ng of pcDNA3-mycDNTCF4 (Addgene, kindly deposited by B. Vogelstein) was included in the transfection mix. Where indicated, 2 μm BIO (6-bromoindirubin-3′-oxime, Calbiochem 361550) was added for 12 h prior to measuring luciferase levels. The next day, cells were lysed in 200 μl of 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase levels were measured using a Dual-Glo Luciferase kit (Promega, 2920) on a GloMax 20/20 luminometer (Promega). A set of 28 bp oligonucleotides that centered on the TCF4 motif within the YAP DNA enhancer element were synthesized with the 5′ nucleotide biotinylated. A second set of oligonucleotides was synthesized and contained a mutated TCF4 site and the oligonucleotide sequences are available in supplemental Table S1. The oligonucleotides were diluted to 1.5 μm in annealing buffer (50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA pH 8.0), heated to 95° for 5 min and then slowly cooled to room temperature. Double-stranded DNA (500 ng) was bound to 50 μl streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Promega, Z5481) in 1× binding buffer (1 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) at room temperature. HCT116 nuclear lysates were prepared as described (20Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Accurate transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II in a soluble extract from isolated mammalian nuclei.Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar), and 100 μg were preincubated in buffer B (20 mm Tris pH 7.9, 15% glycerol, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 50 μg of salmon sperm DNA. The proteins were incubated with the DNA/Bead mixture for 1 h at room temperature in buffer B, and the complexes were captured on a magnetic stand. Following three washes in buffer B, the proteins were eluted in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-TCF4 or anti-β-catenin antibodies. Lentiviral plasmids (pLKO.1) encoding the β-catenin shRNA and a scrambled shRNA control were obtained from Open Biosystems (21Yochum G.S. Sherrick C.M. Macpartlin M. Goodman R.H. A beta-catenin/TCF-coordinated chromatin loop at MYC integrates 5′ and 3′ Wnt responsive enhancers.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Four independent sequences that target the YAP gene were identified using guidelines provided in the pLKO.1 product insert and oligonucleotides corresponding to these sequences were annealed and subcloned into pLKO.1 (supplemental Table S1). To generate lentiviruses, ∼5 × 106 HEK293FT cells seeded in a 10 cm dish were transfected with 3.0 μg of the pLKO.1 shRNA plasmid, 3 μg each of the pLP1 and pLP2 packaging plasmids, and 3 μg of the pLP/VSVG envelope plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Media containing virus particles was harvested at 24 and 48 h following transfection and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 5 min at room temperature. The media was supplemented with 6 μg/ml hexadimethrine bromide and was added to HCT116 and SW620 cells. The next day, 1 μg/ml puromycin was added. The efficiency of knockdown was assessed by RT-PCR, and Western blot analysis at 3 and 5 days following infection. Preparation of protein extracts and Western blot analysis were conducted as described (22Yochum Multiple Wnt/ß-catenin responsive enhancers align with the MYC promoter through long-range chromatin loops.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e18966Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) using the following antibodies and dilutions: anti-β-catenin (BD Transduction, 610154, 1:1000), anti-YAP1 (Santa Cruz SC15407X, 1:1000), anti-α-tubulin (Sigma T9026, 1:1000), and anti-histone H3 (Millipore 07–690, 1:25,000). In each well of a 24-well plate, 10,000 cells were seeded in 0.5 ml of DMEM containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were seeded into quadruplicate wells for each experimental condition. At one and 5 days after seeding, 50 μl of MTT salt solution (5 mg/ml, Sigma M5655) was added and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. An equal volume of solubilization buffer (3% Triton X, 0.008% HCl in isopropanol) was added, and the samples were incubated on a rocker for 10 min. The solubilized crystals were collected and measured using a spectrophotometer at an absorbance of 570 nm. In each well of a 6-well dish, 5000 HCT116 or SW620 cells were seeded in 0.3% agar atop a 0.5% agar underlay. Agar layers contained DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. The cells were incubated for 21 days and were then fixed with 10% methanol/10% acetic acid and stained with 0.01% crystal violet. Images were taken with an EC3 Imaging system (Ultra Violet Products) and colonies were counted using the particle analyzing function of ImageJ software. Minimum colony sizes of 50 pixels2 and 20 pixels2 were used to score HCT116 and SW620 colonies, respectively. SW620 cells were infected with control shRNA or YAP shRNA2 lentivirus and transduced cells were selected by supplementing growth media with 1 μg/ml puromycin. Two days after infection, 5 × 106 cells were suspended in 200 μl of 1× PBS and injected subcutaneously into both flanks of athymic nude mice. Tumor growth was monitored every 3 days and volumes were measured using standard calipers. Upon completion of the experiment (d21), tumors were isolated, photographed, and weighed. HCT116 and SW480 cells were seeded on glass coverslips, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS for 2 min at room temperature. Cells were blocked in 5% goat serum for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies and dilutions used were β-catenin (BD transduction, BD610154, 1:1000) and YAP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology SC15407X, 1:100). The slides were rinsed in 1X PBS and incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The secondary antibodies and dilutions used were goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen, A11001, 1:2500) and donkey anti-rabbit Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 711–166-152, 1:1000). Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Slides were mounted using Fluoro-Gel (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 17983–20) and visualized with a Nikon microscope. Colon cancer tumor arrays were purchased from Imgenex (IMH-359). Immunohistochemistry was performed as described (19Steinhardt A.A. Gayyed M.F. Klein A.P. Dong J. Maitra A. Pan D. Montgomery E.A.

The samples were blocked in 5% goat serum for YAP or 5% horse serum for β-catenin and treated with the Avidin/Biotin blocking kit (Vector Laboratories, SP-2001). Primary antibodies in 5% serum were added and following an overnight incubation at 4 °C, the slides were washed in 1× TBST and then incubated with a 1:400 dilution of biotinylated anti-rabbit (Vector Laboratories, BA-1000) or anti-mouse (Vector Laboratories, BA-2000) secondary antibodies for 1 h. Slides were washed with 1× TBST and then treated with Vectastain ABC Elite reagents (Vector Laboratories, PK-6100). Color was developed using a DAB peroxidase kit (Vector Laboratories, SK-4100), and the samples were counterstained with hematoxylin (Fisher Scientific, CS401-1D). Slides were dehydrated and mounted with cytoseal 60 (Thermo Scientific, 8310-16). Images were taken on a Nikon microscope and two independent investigators scored cells within tumor sections for nuclear β-catenin or nuclear YAP staining. Three fields per section were evaluated and each section was assigned a score of 1–3. Sections with scores of 1–3 were considered positive and the results were used to generate the pie charts in Fig. 6B.

Kyler S.L. McWeeney S.K. Yochum G.S. Identification of {β}-catenin binding regions in colon cancer cells using ChIP-Seq.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 5735-5745Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A peak of 40 read sequences aligned near the transcript start site of YAP suggesting that this region harbored a β-catenin binding site (Fig. 1A). To confirm the ChIP-seq results, we conducted ChIP assays using β-catenin specific antibodies and an irrelevant immunoglobulin as a control. Oligonucleotides that spanned the YAP proximal promoter and putative binding site were designed (see gray bars Y1-Y4, Fig. 1A), and these primer sets were used to detect β-catenin-precipitated DNA using quantitative and real-time PCR. Strong β-catenin binding was detected at region Y3 with little or no binding at regions Y1 and Y4 (Fig. 1B). Intermediate binding was seen at region Y2, and background levels of β-catenin binding were observed at control regions in the GAPDH or Tubulin genes. Because β-catenin is recruited to chromatin through interactions with TCF4, we next tested whether TCF4 bound to the YAP gene using ChIP assays. As was the case for β-catenin, TCF4 binding was detected at region Y3 with little or no binding detected at regions Y1, Y4, or GAPDH or Tubulin controls (Fig. 1C). To determine whether β-catenin/TCF4 bound a transcriptionally active YAP gene locus, we precipitated RNA polymerase II (RNAP) in ChIP assays and found that RNAP bound YAP (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that β-catenin/TCF4 complexes associate with a transcriptionally active YAP gene locus in CRC cells. In CRC cells, constitutive β-catenin/TCF4 complexes drive target gene expression. Regulatory DNA elements that assemble β-catenin/TCF complexes and recruit RNAP have been described as Wnt responsive elements (WREs) (24Archbold H.C. Yang Y.X. Chen L. Cadigan K.M.

https://openalex.org/W2089419574,"Local protein synthesis plays a key role in regulating stimulus-induced responses in dendrites and axons. Recent genome-wide studies have revealed that thousands of different transcripts reside in these distal neuronal compartments, but identifying those with functionally significant roles presents a challenge. We performed an unbiased screen to look for stimulus-induced, protein synthesis-dependent changes in the proteome of Xenopus retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons. The intermediate filament protein lamin B2 (LB2), normally associated with the nuclear membrane, was identified as an unexpected major target. Axonal ribosome immunoprecipitation confirmed translation of lb2 mRNA in vivo. Inhibition of lb2 mRNA translation in axons in vivo does not affect guidance but causes axonal degeneration. Axonal LB2 associates with mitochondria, and LB2-deficient axons exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction and defects in axonal transport. Our results thus suggest that axonally synthesized lamin B plays a crucial role in axon maintenance by promoting mitochondrial function."

Constitutive telomerase deficiency and associated telomere dysfunction constrained cancer progression. In contrast, telomerase reactivation in the setting of telomere dysfunction alleviated intratumoral DNA-damage signaling and generated aggressive cancers with rearranged genomes and new tumor biological properties (bone metastases). Comparative oncogenomic analysis revealed numerous recurrent amplifications and deletions of relevance to human prostate cancer. Murine tumors show enrichment of the TGF-β/SMAD4 network, and genetic validation studies confirmed the cooperative roles of Pten, p53, and Smad4 deficiencies in prostate cancer progression, including skeletal metastases. Thus, telomerase reactivation in tumor cells experiencing telomere dysfunction enables full malignant progression and provides a mechanism for acquisition of cancer-relevant genomic events endowing new tumor biological capabilities."

The A1555G mtDNA mutation that causes maternally inherited deafness disrupts mitochondrial ribosome function, in part, via increased methylation of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA by the methyltransferase mtTFB1. In patient-derived A1555G cells, we show that 12S rRNA hypermethylation causes ROS-dependent activation of AMP kinase and the proapoptotic nuclear transcription factor E2F1. This retrograde mitochondrial-stress relay is operative in vivo, as transgenic-mtTFB1 mice exhibit enhanced 12S rRNA methylation in multiple tissues, increased E2F1 and apoptosis in the stria vascularis and spiral ganglion neurons of the inner ear, and progressive E2F1-dependent hearing loss.

In patient-derived A1555G cells, we show that 12S rRNA hypermethylation causes ROS-dependent activation of AMP kinase and the proapoptotic nuclear transcription factor E2F1. This retrograde mitochondrial-stress relay is operative in vivo, as transgenic-mtTFB1 mice exhibit enhanced 12S rRNA methylation in multiple tissues, increased E2F1 and apoptosis in the stria vascularis and spiral ganglion neurons of the inner ear, and progressive E2F1-dependent hearing loss. This mouse mitochondrial disease model provides a robust platform for deciphering the complex tissue specificity of human mitochondrial-based disorders, as well as the precise pathogenic mechanism of maternally inherited deafness and its exacerbation by environmental factors. Mitochondrial stress promotes a proapoptotic E2F1 signaling cascade E2F1 activation is mediated by mitochondrial ROS-dependent AMP kinase signaling Hearing loss in Tg-mtTFB1 mice models deafness caused by a human mtDNA mutation Deafness involves tissue-specific E2F1-driven apoptosis in critical inner ear cells Mitochondria are multi-functional cellular organelles involved in oxidative metabolism, ion homeostasis, signal transduction, and apoptosis and hence contribute to human disease by a variety of mechanisms. Mitochondrial pathogenesis is complex and involves maternally inherited diseases due to mutations in mtDNA, as well as Mendelian-inherited disease due to mutations in nuclear genes required for mitochondrial function (DiMauro and Schon, 2003DiMauro S. Schon E.A. Mitochondrial respiratory-chain diseases.N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 2656-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in more common disorders such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer, neurodegeneration, and aging (Wallace, 2005Wallace D.C.

Pathol. 2008; 172: 1445-1456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), making efforts to better understand how mitochondria cause and exacerbate human disease pathology imperative and of broad significance. A major hurdle in understanding mitochondrial disease pathogenesis is the current lack of understanding of the often-extreme tissue specificity involved (DiMauro and Schon, 2003DiMauro S. Schon E.A. Mitochondrial respiratory-chain diseases.N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 2656-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). Because defective oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) per se can be pathogenic, this is often attributed to variable energetic thresholds in different cell types. However, defective OXPHOS is also frequently associated with increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are a major cause of pathology because they promote molecular damage, oxidative stress, and cell death. Finally, mitochondria and ROS are involved in signal transduction pathways (Hamanaka and Chandel, 2010Hamanaka R.B. Chandel N.S. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species regulate cellular signaling and dictate biological outcomes.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 505-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) that are likely an underappreciated downstream cause of pathology due to mitochondrial dysfunction. For example, a major signaling node that reacts to mitochondrial dysfunction is the AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, which responds to cellular energy decline that can occur when OXPHOS is disrupted (Hardie, 2007Hardie D.G. AMP-activated/SNF1 protein kinases: conserved guardians of cellular energy.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 774-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar) and is regulated by ROS (Emerling et al., 2009Emerling B.M. Weinberg F. Snyder C. Burgess Z. Mutlu G.M. Viollet B. Budinger G.R. Chandel N.S. Hypoxic activation of AMPK is dependent on mitochondrial ROS but independent of an increase in AMP/ATP ratio.Free Radic. Biol.

Mitochondria as signaling organelles in the vascular endothelium.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 5379-5384Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). A hallmark case of tissue-specific mitochondrial disease pathology is maternally inherited deafness caused by the A1555G mutation in human mtDNA (Prezant et al., 1993Prezant T.R. Agapian J.V. Bohlman M.C. Bu X. Oztas S. Qiu W.Q. Arnos K.S. Cortopassi G.A. Jaber L. Rotter J.I. et al.Mitochondrial ribosomal RNA mutation associated with both antibiotic-induced and non-syndromic deafness.Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). This relatively common mutation (Vandebona et al., 2009Vandebona H. Mitchell P. Manwaring N. Griffiths K. Gopinath B. Wang J.J. Sue C.M. Prevalence of mitochondrial 1555A—>G mutation in adults of European descent.N. Engl. J. Med. 2009; 360: 642-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) causes nonsyndromic and/or aminoglycoside-induced deafness and occurs in the 12S rRNA gene, encoding the RNA component of the small (28S) mitochondrial ribosome subunit. It is also in close proximity to an evolutionarily conserved stem-loop that contains two tandem adenine residues that are methylated by the site-specific rRNA adenine N6-di-methyltransferase, h-mtTFB1/TFB1M (McCulloch et al., 2002McCulloch V. Seidel-Rogol B.L. Shadel G.S. A human mitochondrial transcription factor is related to RNA adenine methyltransferases and binds S-adenosylmethionine.Mol. Cell.

Human mitochondrial transcription factor B1 methylates ribosomal RNA at a conserved stem-loop.Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 23-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This methylation occurs during ribosome biogenesis in bacteria (Pulicherla et al., 2009Pulicherla N. Pogorzala L.A. Xu Z. O Farrell H.C. Musayev F.N. Scarsdale J.N. Sia E.A. Culver G.M. Rife J.P.

Hearing loss caused by the A1555G mutation is irreversible (Prezant et al., 1993Prezant T.R. Agapian J.V. Bohlman M.C. Bu X. Oztas S. Qiu W.Q. Arnos K.S. Cortopassi G.A. Jaber L.

Genet. 1993; 4: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar), implying death of critical, irreplaceable cells in the inner ear by an unknown pathogenic cell-death pathway. The A1555G mutation alters mitochondrial ribosome function and translation (Cotney et al., 2009Cotney J. McKay S.E. Shadel G.S.

USA. 2008; 105: 3244-3249Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), which in turn causes OXPHOS defects that are thought to contribute to deafness pathology. However, mitochondrial translation and OXPHOS defects observed in patient-derived primary and cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) cell lines are mild and highly dependent on the nuclear genetic background (Guan et al., 1996Guan M.X. Fischel-Ghodsian N. Attardi G. Biochemical evidence for nuclear gene involvement in phenotype of non-syndromic deafness associated with mitochondrial 12S rRNA mutation.Hum. Mol.

Genet. 2000; 9: 1787-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), suggesting that other aspects of mitochondrial dysfunction may also be operative. Finally, polymorphisms near the TFB1M gene encoding h-mtTFB1 are nuclear modifiers of the A1555G deafness phenotype (Bykhovskaya et al., 2004Bykhovskaya Y. Mengesha E. Wang D. Yang H. Estivill X. Shohat M. Fischel-Ghodsian N. Human mitochondrial transcription factor B1 as a modifier gene for hearing loss associated with the mitochondrial A1555G mutation.Mol. Genet. Metab. 2004; 82: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), suggesting a connection between 12S rRNA methylation and hearing loss (Shadel, 2004bShadel G.S. A dual-function mitochondrial transcription factor tunes out deafness.Mol. Genet. Metab. 2004; 82: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We recently showed that patient-derived A1555G cybrids are hypermethylated at the 12S rRNA stem-loop methylated by h-mtTFB1 (Cotney et al., 2009Cotney J. McKay S.E. Shadel G.S. Elucidation of separate, but collaborative functions of the rRNA methyltransferase-related human mitochondrial transcription factors B1 and B2 in mitochondrial biogenesis reveals new insight into maternally inherited deafness.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 2670-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These A1555G cybrids exhibit defective mitochondrial biogenesis and membrane potential and heightened sensitivity to stress-induced apoptosis (Cotney et al., 2009Cotney J. McKay S.E. Shadel G.S. Elucidation of separate, but collaborative functions of the rRNA methyltransferase-related human mitochondrial transcription factors B1 and B2 in mitochondrial biogenesis reveals new insight into maternally inherited deafness.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 2670-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), apparently due to disrupted coordination of overall mitochondrial biogenesis with the assembly of mitochondrial ribosomes (Cotney et al., 2007Cotney J. Wang Z. Shadel G.S. Relative abundance of the human mitochondrial transcription system and distinct roles for h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 in mitochondrial biogenesis and gene expression.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 4042-4054Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Remarkably, these phenotypes are shared by HeLa cells with wild-type mtDNA that instead have hypermethylated 12S rRNA due to overexpression of h-mtTFB1, leading us to conclude that hypermethylation of mitochondrial ribosomes per se is a key molecular defect driving the apoptotic phenotype (Cotney et al., 2009Cotney J. McKay S.E. Shadel G.S. Elucidation of separate, but collaborative functions of the rRNA methyltransferase-related human mitochondrial transcription factors B1 and B2 in mitochondrial biogenesis reveals new insight into maternally inherited deafness.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 2670-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that this hypermethylation of mitochondrial ribosomes instigates a unique form of mitochondrial stress signaling involved in the deafness pathology of the A1555G mutation. We show that increased mitochondrial ROS generated in A1555G cybrids activate the proapoptotic nuclear transcription factor E2F1 in an AMPK-dependent manner, and that overexpression of mtTFB1 in mice (to model pathogenesis due to increased mitochondrial 12S rRNA methylation) is sufficient to cause progressive hearing loss associated with tissue-specific upregulation of E2F1 and apoptosis of critical cells of the inner ear. We hypothesized that mitochondrial defects due to 12S rRNA hypermethylation elicit a mitochondrial retrograde stress signal (Butow and Avadhani, 2004Butow R.A. Avadhani N.G. Mitochondrial signaling: the retrograde response.Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 1-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar) that explains the apoptotic susceptibility we documented previously in A1555G and h-mtTFB1 methyltransferase overexpression cell lines (Cotney et al., 2009Cotney J. McKay S.E. Shadel G.S. Elucidation of separate, but collaborative functions of the rRNA methyltransferase-related human mitochondrial transcription factors B1 and B2 in mitochondrial biogenesis reveals new insight into maternally inherited deafness.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 2670-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed microarray analysis on these cell lines, which exhibit 12S hypermethylation for different reasons (i.e., due to the A1555G point mutation or overexpression of the h-mtTFB1), reasoning that this would define a common transcriptional signature, which, in turn, would allow elements of this mitochondrial stress-response pathway to be deciphered. Expression microarrays were performed on A1555G cybrids, using analogous 143B cybrids containing the corresponding wild-type mtDNA (“A” at position 1555) as the negative control, and on HeLa cells overexpressing h-mtTFB1 compared to those expressing a methyltransferase-deficient G65A mutant of h-mtTFB1 as a negative control (Figure 1A ). We identified genes that were significantly upregulated or downregulated in the hypermethylation cell lines (Table S1 available online), which we reasoned would include genes that were responding specifically to 12S hypermethylation. We then analyzed the promoters of this set of hypermethylation-responsive genes (Figure 1B) for transcription factor binding sites and found that E2F1 sites were the most frequently overrepresented in genes upregulated in 12S hypermethylation (Table 1). We next crossed our microarray dataset with a published dataset identifying E2F1-responsive genes and found significant overlap (Table S2), again supporting E2F1 induction in our experimental system. We also prepared a list of E2F1 targets by selecting human genes whose promoter is predicted to contain cis-elements for E2F1, and found that there is a significant enrichment of E2F1 targets in the transcripts induced by 12S rRNA hypermethylation (Table S2), again suggesting an increase in E2F1 transcriptional activity.Table 1Transcription Factors Whose cis-Elements Are Detected in the Promoters of Transcripts Upregulated in Response to 12S rRNA Hypermethylation, but Not in the Promoters of the Downregulated TranscriptsTranscription FactorUpregulated Target GenesDownregulated Target Genesp ValueE2F15000.00010CEBPA4300.00012RUNX1T11500.0010IRF31300.0018E2F2900.0128The p value was calculated using Fisher's exact test. Open table in a new tab The p value was calculated using Fisher's exact test. E2F1 is one of a family of eight E2F transcription factors that are involved in cell cycle regulation through their cyclin-dependent interactions with pocket proteins, including the tumor suppressor Rb (DeGregori and Johnson, 2006DeGregori J. Johnson D.G. Distinct and Overlapping Roles for E2F Family Members in Transcription, Proliferation and Apoptosis.Curr. Mol. Med. 2006; 6: 739-748PubMed Google Scholar). Of particular significance, E2F1 is involved in proapoptotic signaling (Field et al., 1996Field S.J. Tsai F.Y. Kuo F. Zubiaga A.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Livingston D.M. Orkin S.H. Greenberg M.E.

Cancer. 2009; 9: 738-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). This connection to cell death, in conjunction with our microarray results, made E2F1 a likely candidate for a stress-responsive protein that is responding to mitochondrial dysfunction caused by the A1555G mutation and perhaps also the causative factor in the observed apoptosis susceptibility in the 12S hypermethylation cell lines (Cotney et al., 2009Cotney J. McKay S.E. Shadel G.S.

Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 2670-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Entirely consistent with this concept, we confirmed E2F1 transcriptional induction in cells with 12S rRNA hypermethylation by q-PCR (Figure S1A ), and found that the steady-state level of E2F1 protein was increased in A1555G cybrids and in HeLa cells that overexpress h-mtTFB1 compared to appropriate control lines (Figure 2A ; Figure S1B). In addition, we observed a decrease in the steady-state amount of Rb (Figure 2A; Figure S1B) and/or its increased phosphorylation (Figure 2A; Figure S1B), either of which is consistent with increased E2F1 activity in the 12S hypermethylated cell lines.Figure 2Hypermethylation of Mitochondrial 12S rRNA Leads to Activation of E2F1- and E2F1-Dependent ApoptosisShow full caption(A) Western blot analysis of whole-cell extracts for E2F1, Rb and phosphorylated-Rb, (Rb[T826]-P) in HeLa cells that overexpress h-mtTFB1 (mtTFB1-OE) compared to cell containing an empty-vector negative control (pcDNA), and in human 143B cybrids containing wild-type (wt) or A1555G mtDNA.

E2F1, full-length (PARP) and caspase-3-cleaved forms of PARP are shown, with tubulin probed as a loading control. Quantification is shown in Figure S1D. Given the association of active E2F1 with apoptosis, we next tested whether the upregulation of E2F1 per se in A1555G cybrids is involved in their heightened sensitivity to apoptotic cell death. In strong support of this concept, we found that suppressing the hypermethylation of the 12S rRNA via knockdown of h-mtTFB1 abolished E2F1 induction (Figure 2B; Figure S1C) and reduced the susceptibility of A1555G cybrids to apoptosis (Figure 2C). Furthermore, reduction of E2F1 to near wild-type levels by shRNA in the A1555G cybrids abrogated the increase in apoptosis susceptibility, as measured by caspase 3/7 activity (Figure 2D) and accumulation of the cleaved form of PARP (Figure 2E; Figure S1D). Altogether, these results indicate that the Rb-E2F1 apoptotic pathway responds to mitochondrial stress induced by hypermethylation of 12S rRNA in mitochondrial ribosomes. To determine the proximal signal leading to E2F1 activation we examined respiratory function in A1555G and corresponding wild-type cybrids and found that the former have decreased basal and maximal mitochondrial O2 consumption rates (Figure 3A ). Furthermore, the respiratory chain in the A1555G cells is reduced (Figure 3B), a condition conducive to increased ROS production (e.g., superoxide) (Jones et al., 2005Jones R.G. Plas D.R. Kubek S. Buzzai M. Mu J. Xu Y. Birnbaum M.J. Thompson C.B. AMP-activated protein kinase induces a p53-dependent metabolic checkpoint.Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 283-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we found that A1555G cells have increased mitochondrial superoxide, as measured by MitoSox (Figure 3C). To determine if this increased superoxide was underlying proapoptotic signaling to E2F1 in A1555G cybrids, we overexpressed mitochondrial superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and found that this eliminated E2F1 induction, increased the total amount of Rb, decreased Rb hyperphosphorylation and eliminated the apoptosis susceptibility in A1555G cells (Figures 3D and 3E). We next sought to determine how mitochondrial superoxide is sensed and promotes E2F1 activation. AMPK is an established sensor of mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, its activity is activated by superoxide (Quintero et al., 2006Quintero M. Colombo S.L. Godfrey A. Moncada S. Mitochondria as signaling organelles in the vascular endothelium.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 5379-5384Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and regulates E2F1 by phosphorylating Rb (Dasgupta and Milbrandt, 2009Dasgupta B. Milbrandt J. AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylates retinoblastoma protein to control mammalian brain development.Dev. Cell. 2009; 16: 256-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) making it a potential candidate in the stress pathway we have elucidated. Accordingly, we found that A1555G cybrids have increased active AMPKα (phospho-AMPKα) compared to wild-type controls, and that AMPKα activity was restored close to normal upon overexpression of SOD2 (Figure 3D). To determine if the increased AMPK activity was linked to E2F1 induction in A1555G cells, we treated A1555G cells with AMPK inhibitor compound C, which was confirmed by reduced phosphorylation of AMPK target acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) (Figure 3F). Pharmacological inactivation of AMPK in A1555G cybrids reduced Rb phosphorylation and E2F1 levels (Figure 3F), and lowered apoptosis susceptibility of the A1555G cells (Figure 3G). Taken together, these results strongly implicate AMPK as a ROS-sensitive component of the mitochondrial stress-response pathway that leads to proapoptotic E2F1 signaling in cells containing the deafness-causing A1555G mutation. The cell culture studies above strongly implicate an E2F1-dependent, proapoptotic mitochondrial stress signaling pathway downstream of mitochondrial 12S hypermethylation as a potential pathogenic component of deafness caused by the A1555G mtDNA mutation. To test this hypothesis directly, we generated transgenic mice that globally overexpress the mouse mtTFB1 rRNA methyltransferase (Tg-mtTFB1) responsible for the specific mitochondrial 12S methylation event implicated (Seidel-Rogol et al., 2003Seidel-Rogol B.L. McCulloch V. Shadel G.S. Human mitochondrial transcription factor B1 methylates ribosomal RNA at a conserved stem-loop.Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 23-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These animals are viable and fertile, and have increased mtTFB1 protein in multiple tissues (Figure 4A ) that corresponds with increased 12S rRNA methylation (Figure 4B). When we measured hearing function in Tg-mtTFB1 mice by the auditory brainstem response (ABR) and compared them to age-matched, nontransgenic littermate controls, we found that at 3–6 months of age Tg-mtTFB1 mice have higher ABR thresholds across the entire range of frequencies, indicating significant hearing loss (Figure 4C). Similar hearing-threshold defects are observed in patients with the A1555G mutation (Noguchi et al., 2004Noguchi Y. Yashima T. Ito T. Sumi T. Tsuzuku T. Kitamura K. Audiovestibular findings in patients with mitochondrial A1555G mutation.Laryngoscope. 2004; 114: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This hearing loss in the Tg-mtTFB1 animals progresses dramatically with age, with a much greater difference in ABR thresholds in animals aged to 9–12 months (Figure 4D)."

https://openalex.org/W2072461153,"Understanding the pathway and kinetic mechanisms of transcription initiation is essential for quantitative understanding of gene regulation, but initiation is a multistep process, the features of which can be obscured in bulk analysis. We used a multiwavelength single-molecule fluorescence colocalization approach, CoSMoS, to define the initiation pathway at an activator-dependent bacterial σ(54) promoter that recapitulates characteristic features of eukaryotic promoters activated by enhancer binding proteins. The experiments kinetically characterize all major steps of the initiation process, revealing heretofore unknown features, including reversible formation of two closed complexes with greatly differing stabilities, multiple attempts for each successful formation of an open complex, and efficient release of σ(54) from the polymerase core at the start of transcript synthesis. Open complexes are committed to transcription, suggesting that regulation likely targets earlier steps in the mechanism. CoSMoS is a powerful, generally applicable method to elucidate the mechanisms of transcription and other multistep biochemical processes."

Human cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) mediates the net transfer of cholesteryl ester mass from atheroprotective high-density lipoproteins to atherogenic low-density lipoproteins by an unknown mechanism. Delineating this mechanism would be an important step toward the rational design of new CETP inhibitors for treating cardiovascular diseases. Using EM, single-particle image processing and molecular dynamics simulation, we discovered that CETP bridges a ternary complex with its N-terminal β-barrel domain penetrating into high-density lipoproteins and its C-terminal domain interacting with low-density lipoprotein or very-low-density lipoprotein. In our mechanistic model, the CETP lipoprotein-interacting regions, which are highly mobile, form pores that connect to a hydrophobic central cavity, thereby forming a tunnel for transfer of neutral lipids from donor to acceptor lipoproteins. These new insights into CETP transfer provide a molecular basis for analyzing mechanisms for CETP inhibition."

Under conditions of immunosuppression, EBV can spread from these cells and cause life-threatening pathologies. We have generated mice expressing the transforming EBV latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), mimicking a constitutively active CD40 coreceptor, specifically in B cells. Like human EBV-infected cells, LMP1+ B cells were efficiently eliminated by T cells, and breaking immune surveillance resulted in rapid, fatal lymphoproliferation and lymphomagenesis. The lymphoma cells expressed ligands for a natural killer (NK) cell receptor, NKG2D, and could be targeted by an NKG2D-Fc fusion protein. These experiments indicate a central role for LMP1 in the surveillance and transformation of EBV-infected B cells in vivo, establish a preclinical model for B cell lymphomagenesis in immunosuppressed patients, and validate a new therapeutic approach."

https://openalex.org/W1979348380,"Clathrin-coated vesicles mediate endocytosis and transport between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes in eukaryotic cells. Clathrin adaptors play central roles in coat assembly, interacting with clathrin, cargo and membranes. Two main types of clathrin adaptor act in TGN–endosome traffic: GGA proteins and the AP-1 complex. Here we characterize the relationship between GGA proteins, AP-1 and other TGN clathrin adaptors using live-cell and super-resolution microscopy in yeast. We present evidence that GGA proteins and AP-1 are recruited sequentially in two waves of coat assembly at the TGN. Mutations that decrease phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P) levels at the TGN slow or uncouple AP-1 coat assembly from GGA coat assembly. Conversely, enhanced PtdIns(4)P synthesis shortens the time between adaptor waves. Gga2p binds directly to the TGN PtdIns(4)-kinase Pik1p and contributes to Pik1p recruitment. These results identify a PtdIns(4)P-based mechanism for regulating progressive assembly of adaptor-specific clathrin coats at the TGN. GGA proteins and the AP-1 complex are clathrin adaptors that regulate trans-Golgi network (TGN)-to-endosome traffic. Payne and colleagues show that these adaptors are recruited to the TGN in sequential waves, and reveal that phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate (PtdIns(4)P) coordinates the temporal assembly of these adaptors."

Starting with the initial lead oxime RS41A identified in our earlier study and extending to the azepine analog RS194B, reactivation rates for OP-hAChE conjugates formed by sarin, cyclosarin, VX, paraoxon, and tabun are enhanced severalfold in vitro. To analyze the mechanism of intrinsic reactivation of the OP-AChE conjugate and penetration of the blood-brain barrier, the pH dependence of the oxime and amine ionizing groups of the compounds and their nucleophilic potential were examined by UV-visible spectroscopy, (1)H NMR, and oximolysis rates for acetylthiocholine and phosphoester hydrolysis. Oximolysis rates were compared in solution and on AChE conjugates and analyzed in terms of the ionization states for reactivation of the OP-conjugated AChE. In addition, toxicity and pharmacokinetic studies in mice show significantly improved CNS penetration and retention for RS194B when compared with RS41A. The enhanced intrinsic reactivity against the OP-AChE target combined with favorable pharmacokinetic properties resulted in great improvement of antidotal properties of RS194B compared with RS41A and the standard peripherally active oxime, 2-pyridinealdoxime methiodide. Improvement was particularly noticeable when pretreatment of mice with RS194B before OP exposure was combined with RS194B reactivation therapy after the OP insult."
https://openalex.org/W2087031102,"In budding yeast, polarized Cdc42 localization is supported in part by guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI)-mediated extraction from the plasma membrane. Li and colleagues now show that a lipid flippase complex containing Lem3 and Dnf1 or Dnf2 contributes to membrane lipid asymmetry to facilitate GDI-mediated extraction of Cdc42. Lipid asymmetry at the plasma membrane is essential for such processes as cell polarity, cytokinesis and phagocytosis1,2,3. Here we find that a lipid flippase complex, composed of Lem3, Dnf1 or Dnf2 (ref. 4), has a role in the dynamic recycling of the Cdc42 GTPase, a key regulator of cell polarity5, in yeast. By using quantitative microscopy methods, we show that the flippase complex is required for fast dissociation of Cdc42 from the polar cortex by the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor. A loss of flippase activity, or pharmacological blockage of the inward flipping of phosphatidylethanolamine, a phospholipid with a neutral head group, disrupts Cdc42 polarity maintained by guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor-mediated recycling. Phosphatidylethanolamine flipping may reduce the charge interaction between a Cdc42 carboxy-terminal cationic region with the plasma membrane inner leaflet, enriched for the negatively charged lipid phosphatidylserine. Using a reconstituted system with supported lipid bilayers, we show that the relative composition of phosphatidylethanolamine versus phosphatidylserine directly modulates Cdc42 extraction from the membrane by guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor."

The phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns)/phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) transfer protein Sec14 is the pro-trafficking member of this pair.

Why cells engineer a Sec14/Kes1 “tug of war” into the TGN/endosomal trafficking design remains unclear. Kes1 is a PtdIns-4-P and sterol-binding protein. PtdIns-4-P binding is a biologically important Kes1 activity and is required for Kes1 homing to TGN/endosomal membranes (Li et al., 2002Li X.M.P. Rivas M.P. Fang M. Marchena J. Mehrotra B. Chaudhary A. Feng L. Prestwich G.D. Bankaitis V.A. Analysis of oxysterol binding protein homologue Kes1p function in regulation of Sec14p-dependent protein transport from the yeast Golgi complex.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). With regard to sterol binding, Kes1 is suggested to serve as a diffusible sterol carrier (Im et al., 2005Im Y.J. Raychaudhuri S. Prinz W.A. Hurley J.H. Structural mechanism for sterol sensing and transport by OSBP-related proteins.Nature. 2005; 437: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, Schulz and Prinz, 2009Schulz T.A. Prinz W.A. Sterol transport in yeast and the oxysterol binding protein homologue (OSH) family.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1771: 769-780Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Carrier models are confronted with the rapid rate at which sterol shuttles between membranes via nonvesicular pathways, however (Mesmin and Maxfield, 2009Mesmin B. Maxfield F.R. Intracellular sterol dynamics.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791: 636-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and measured rates for Kes1-mediated sterol transport in vitro are too slow to account for such rapid flux. New data argue that OSBPs have no role in sterol transport (Georgiev et al., 2011Georgiev A.G. Sullivan D.P. Kersting M.C. Dittman J.S. Beh C.T. Menon A.K. Osh proteins regulate membrane sterol organization but are not required for sterol movement between the ER and PM.Traffic. 2011; 12: 1341-1355https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0854.2011.01234.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This controversy underscores our lack of knowledge regarding how Kes1 translates sterol-binding activity to TGN/endosomal trafficking functions, and how Kes1 coordinates its dual PtdIns-4-P and sterol-binding activities. Herein, we report that Kes1 integrates multiple aspects of lipid metabolism in distal stages of the secretory pathway with TORC1 and nitrogen signaling. Kes1 couples TGN/endosomal sterol and PtdIns-4-P status with sphingolipid (SL) signaling from this endomembrane system. We show that Kes1-regulated SL-signaling in TGN/endosomal membranes attenuates activities of TORC1 and Gcn4, a primary transcription factor for control of amino acid homeostasis. Finally, we report that SL-regulated attenuation of Gcn4 activity requires a functional CDK8 module of the “large Mediator” complex, which regulates RNA polymerase II holoenzyme activity. These results introduce new conceptual frameworks for interpreting how Kes1, and other Kes1-like OSBPs, link membrane trafficking and lipid signaling with cell proliferation and transcriptional programs that respond to nitrogen stress. Assignment of Kes1 as a TGN/endosomal trafficking “brake” derives from loss-of-function phenotypes recorded in complex genetic backgrounds (e.g., “bypass Sec14”) (Cleves et al., 1991Cleves A.E.

Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The effects of a genuine trafficking brake should also be apparent in otherwise wild-type (WT) genetic backgrounds. Because Kes1 is a nonessential protein in vegetative cells, the function was probed in cells producing excess Kes1. The effects of acute elevations in Kes1 expression were monitored in WT yeast using an inducible system where KES1 and kes1 alleles of interest were placed under control of a doxycycline (Dox)-repressible promoter. Three Kes1 derivatives were expressed in parallel: (1) a biologically inactive kes1R236E,K242E,K243E triple mutant (kes13E) unable to target to TGN/endosomal membranes because it is defective in PtdIns-4-P binding (Li et al., 2002Li X.M.P.

Structural mechanism for sterol sensing and transport by OSBP-related proteins.Nature. 2005; 437: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar); and (3) a second putative sterol-binding mutant (kes1T185V). The T185V substitution, like Y97F, is predicted to disrupt the ordered water chain that stabilizes sterol binding within the Kes1 lipid-binding pocket (Figure S1A available online). Kes1 and its mutant derivatives were further characterized. [3H]-Cholesterol binding to Kes1 and kes13E was saturable (apparent Kd ≈ 0.5–0.8 μM) and specific on the basis of its sensitivity to competition by unlabeled cholesterol (Figures S1B and S1C). In agreement with structural data (Im et al., 2005Im Y.J. Raychaudhuri S. Prinz W.A. Hurley J.H. Structural mechanism for sterol sensing and transport by OSBP-related proteins.Nature. 2005; 437: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), the saturation binding data demonstrated both Kes1- and kes13E-bound [3H]-cholesterol in an ∼1:1 stoichiometry (Bmax = 1.2 pmol sterol bound/pmol protein). The Y97F and T185V substitutions each diminished specific cholesterol binding to the extent that saturation binding was not attainable. We estimate the binding affinities to be >70× weaker than those measured for Kes1 and kes13E (Figure S1C). Gel filtration and circular dichroism assays confirmed that kes1Y97F and kes1T185V, like Kes1, were well folded monomeric proteins (Figures S1D and S1E). Introduction of PDOX::KES1, PDOX::kes1Y97F, PDOX::kes1T185V, or PDOX::kes13E vectors into yeast did not impair cell growth when the host yeast cells were cultured under noninducing conditions (in Dox-replete media). Induced Kes1 expression by Dox withdrawal severely inhibited cell growth, while kes13E expression had no such detrimental effect (Figure 1). Unexpectedly, expression of the purportedly nonfunctional kes1Y97F and kes1T185V mutants also arrested growth of WT yeast (Figure 1A). The inducible PDOX expression system elevated protein levels ∼5-fold (relative to endogenous Kes1) following Dox withdrawal (Figure 1B), indicating that the inhibitory effects of kes1Y97F and kes1T185V were not results of excessive expression relative to Kes1 or kes13E. Toxicity of kes1Y97F and kes1T185V did not require strongly enhanced production. Yields of WT yeast transformants per unit DNA were reduced ∼100-fold for YCp(kes1Y97F) and YCp(kes1T185V) plasmids relative to YCp(KES1) and YCp(kes13E). These YCp vectors drive only modest constitutive expression of the Kes1 derivatives (2-fold relative to endogenous Kes1) (Figure S1F). These data indicate that kes1Y97F and kes1T185V are more potent inhibitors of cell growth than is Kes1, a result that is incongruent with reports that loss of sterol binding inactivates Kes1 (Im et al., 2005Im Y.J.

Kes1p shares homology with human oxysterol binding protein and participates in a novel regulatory pathway for yeast Golgi-derived transport vesicle biogenesis.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6447-6459Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This specificity is reflected in the growth-inhibition assay. High-level expression of Hes1 (Osh5, the protein most similar to Kes1), the sterol-binding-defective hes1Y97F, or Osh7 did not compromise cell proliferation. Two lines of evidence show that sterol binding controls Kes1 association with TGN/endosomes. First, whereas Kes1-GFP adopted both diffuse cytosolic and punctate distributions in cells, kes1Y97F-GFP localized predominantly to punctate structures (Figure 1C). These compartments were identified as TGN/endosomes because they load with FM4-64 under conditions where the tracer marks endocytic compartments (Figure 1D). Fractionation analyses also show increased kes1Y97F membrane association (Figure S2A ). In addition, our finding that challenge of cells with a sterol synthesis inhibitor (miconazole) provoked Kes1-GFP superrecruitment to punctate compartments loaded with FM4-64 (Figure 1E) also suggests that sterol binding releases Kes1 from TGN/endosomes. Enhanced association of Kes1 and kes1Y97F with TGN/endosomes also requires PtdIns-4-P-binding activity and robust Pik1-dependent PtdIns-4-P synthesis. Introduction of kes13E PtdIns-4-P-binding defects into the context of kes1Y97F had the effect of (1) abrogating recruitment of the kes1Y97F sterol-binding-defective mutant to TGN/endosomes (Figure 1G), and (2) relieving kes1Y97F-mediated growth arrest (Figure 1H). Moreover, shift of pik1-101ts yeast to 37°C, a condition nonpermissive for Pik1-mediated PtdIns-4-P production, released kes1Y97F-GFP from TGN/endosomal membranes (Figure 1F). Enhanced Kes1 recruitment to TGN/endosomes interfered with localization of the GOLPH3-GFP PtdIns-4-P sensor to this membrane system. In agreement with Wood et al., 2009Wood C.S. Schmitz K.R. Bessman N.J. Setty T.G. Ferguson K.M. Burd C.G. PtdIns4P recognition by Vps74/GOLPH3 links PtdIns 4-kinase signaling to retrograde Golgi trafficking.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 967-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, GOLPH3-GFP localized to TGN/endosomes in WT cells. This localization is PtdIns-4-P dependent, as indicated by release of GOLPH3-GFP upon Pik1 inactivation (Figure 2A ). The GOLPH3-GFP chimera also distributed to TGN/endosomes when WT cells bearing YCp(PDOX::KES1) or YCp(PDOX::kes1Y97F) were cultured in noninducing medium (Figure 2B). Kes1/kes1Y97F expression released a significant fraction of GOLPH3-GFP from TGN/endosomes (Figure 2B). Quantitative imaging analyses recorded 3-fold reductions in puncta fluorescence intensity relative to cytosol under those conditions (n = 150, p = 0.0009 and p = 0.0003). [3H]-Inositol labeling showed no diminution of bulk PtdIns-4-P, or bulk levels of other phosphoinositides, in the face of Kes1/kes1Y97F expression (Figure 2C). We conclude that Kes1 and kes1Y97F sequester PtdIns-4-P without stimulating its degradation. The ability of Kes1 to bind PtdIns-4-P suggests that Kes1 interferes with interaction of this phosphoinositide with its prosecretory effectors. Several independent assays demonstrate that enhanced Kes1 activity impairs TGN/endosomal dynamics. Pulse-radiolabeling experiments show that carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) trafficking to the vacuole was inhibited by Kes1, kes1Y97F, or kes1T185V (Figure 2D). Trafficking of the Snc1 v-SNARE and the bulk endocytic tracer FM4-64 were also compromised by Kes1, kes1Y97F, or kes1T185V (Figure 2E). Normally, FM4-64 is internalized from the plasma membrane into endosomal compartments within 7.5 min of chase, and a significant fraction of the cell-associated FM4-64 is detected in the vacuole by that time point. The nonvacuolar FM4-64 pool chases from endosomes to vacuoles during the remainder of the time course (Figure S2C). FM4-64 trafficking was interrupted in cells with enhanced Kes1, kes1Y97F, or kes1T185V activities; >80% and >40% of cells presented solely punctate endosomal profiles after 15 and 30 min of chase. By 30 min, only 5% of the Kes1-, kes1Y97F-, or kes1T185V-expressing cells exhibited vacuolar labeling profiles (Figure S2C). Trafficking defects were recorded for the general amino acid permease Gap1 (Figure S2D), and the defects in uptake of [35S]-amino acids observed for yeast with enhanced Kes1/kes1Y97F activity were also consistent with defects in amino acid permease trafficking to the plasma membrane (Figure S2B). Kes1/kes1Y97F-induced membrane trafficking defects notwithstanding, electron microscopy failed to record the typical accumulation of cargo-engorged TGN/endosomes. Instead, intravacuolar vesicles (diameter ∼350 nm) were observed in >60% of cells expressing Kes1/kes1Y97F (Figure 3A ). These morphologies report that Kes1/kes1Y97F-arrested cells were engaged in autophagy while bathed in nutrient-sufficient medium. Two other phenotypes support this diagnosis. First, we measured autophagic import from the cytoplasm of a modified alkaline phosphatase zymogen (Pho8Δ60) into the vacuole lumen, where Pho8Δ60 is activated (Noda et al., 1995Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Novel system for monitoring autophagy in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Pho8Δ60 activity was elevated 3.8- and 4.2-fold in the face of excess Kes1 and kes1Y97F (Figure 3B). This enhancement was abrogated by atg1Δ, an allele which blocks autophagy at an early stage (Figure S3A ). Second, the Atg18 subunit of the preautophagosome was recruited to a juxtavacuolar location in Kes1/kes1Y97F-arrested cells in a manner similar to that evoked by NH4+ starvation (Figures S3B and S3C).Figure S3Autophagy and Vacuolar Hydrolase Function in Preservation of Cell Viability of Kes1-Arrested Cells, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Yeast strain PHY2433 and an atg1Δ derivative were analyzed for the effect of Kes1 expression on ALP activation.

(F) WT (CTY182) and atg1Δ (CTY2040) yeast cells producing Kes1 derivatives (−Dox) and corresponding nonexpressing controls (+Dox; 10 μg/ml) were analyzed by EM. Kes1/kes1Y97F-mediated growth arrest is not accompanied by loss of viability, even after 20 days, indicating cell quiescence. Survival requires active autophagy, however. Arrested cells rapidly lose viability if they are incompetent for initiating autophagy (atg1Δ mutants) or if vacuolar protease activity is compromised (Figures S3D and S3E). Interestingly, Kes1/kes1Y97F-arrested atg1Δ cells accumulated cargo-engorged TGN/endosomes in the cytoplasm, while interference with vacuolar degradative functions resulted in membrane accretion in the vacuole lumen (Figure S3F). These observations indicate that the affected compartments are cleared by autophagy in Kes1/kes1Y97F-arrested cells and degraded in the vacuole, which explains our initial failure to observe these structures by electron microscopy. The autophagy phenotype suggested metabolic imbalances in cells with elevated Kes1 activity. A metabolomic signature for Kes1/kes1Y97F-arrested yeast was established by profiling methanol-soluble small molecules by 1H-NMR (Figure S4A ). Unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) deconvoluted the NMR spectra, and PCA score plots revealed informative variances in the first principal component (PC1) (Figure 3C). These variances clustered along compact regions of the PC1 axis and accounted for 51% of the total variance in the data set. The second principal component (PC2) further distinguished Kes1- from kes1Y97F-expressing cells. Variances were again confined to narrow windows of the PC2 axis (Figure 3C). The discriminating methanol-soluble analytes were identified. Shown in Figure 3D is a comparison of selected metabolites from Kes1/kes1Y97F-arrested cells and mock controls. Pools of 60% of the assignable amino acids were reduced at least 2-fold in the arrested cells. Most prominent were diminutions in Arg, Asn, Asp, Glu, Gln, Thr, and Trp pools (Figure S4B). A concentrated Asn/Glu/Gln/Arg (NEQR) cocktail rescued growth and amino acid pools of Kes1/kes1Y97F-arrested cells (Figure 3E)—even though these cells are genetically NEQR prototrophs. Yet the trafficking defects associated with enhanced Kes1/kes1Y97F activity remained unresolved. EM analyses demonstrated that NEQR-rescued cells, unlike Kes1/kes1Y97F-arrested cells, accumulated cargo-engorged TGN/endosomes typically associated with trafficking defects through this system (Figure S4C). The NEQR data demonstrate that Kes1/kes1Y97F-induced arrest derives from amino acid deficiencies rather than from trafficking defects per se. The nature of the amino-acid-homeostatic problem is the focus of the remainder of this work. Several lines of evidence demonstrate that TORC1 activity is inversely proportional to potency of the Kes1 trafficking brake. First, phosphorylation of the TORC1 substrate Atg13 was reduced by Kes1/kes1Y97F expression (Figure 3F). This effect was accompanied by phospho-eIF2α accumulation—a hallmark of reduced TORC1 activity (Zaman et al., 2008Zaman S. Lippman S.I. Zhao X. Broach J.R. How Saccharomyces responds to nutrients.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2008; 42: 27-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Second, genome content assays scored a G1 block in Kes1/kes1Y97F-arrested cells (Figure S4D). This block exhibits activated Rim15 signatures; a diagnosis of predisposal for entry into G0. Third, sec14-1ts yeast (harbor diminished activity for the protrafficking Sec14) were more rapamycin sensitive than isogenic WT strains. Increased rapamycin sensitivity was suppressed by kes1Δ (Figure 3G). Furthermore, rapamycin-treated kes1Δ cells accumulated less phospho-eIF2α than did isogenic WT cells (Figure S5A ), and both sec14-1 ts kes1Δ, and WT kes1Δ yeast showed increased rapamycin resistance relative to WT controls (Figures 3G and 3H). By contrast, a 2-fold elevation in KES1 expression rendered a sec14-1ts cki1Δ “bypass Sec14” mutant hypersensitive to rapamycin (Figure S5B). In all cases, the relative drug sensitivities reflected the magnitude of rapamycin-induced phospho-eIF2α accumulation in these strains (see below). Amino acids promote TORC1 signaling by potentiating Gtr1 and Gtr2 GTPase activities (Binda et al., 2009Binda M. Péli-Gulli M.P. Bonfils G. Panchaud N. Urban J. Sturgill T.W. Loewith R. De Virgilio C.

NEQR resuscitated growth of Kes1/kes1Y97F-arrested spo14Δ and scs2Δ scs22Δ mutants. These data demonstrate that neither phosp"

Using a phenotypic screen to identify events that restore functionality to polyQ proteins in S. cerevisiae, we discovered that transcription elongation factor Spt4 is required to transcribe long trinucleotide repeats located either in ORFs or nonprotein-coding regions of DNA templates. Mutation of SPT4 selectively decreased synthesis of and restored enzymatic activity to expanded polyQ protein without affecting protein lacking long-polyQ stretches. RNA-seq analysis revealed limited effects of Spt4 on overall gene expression. Inhibition of Supt4h, the mammalian ortholog of Spt4, reduced mutant huntingtin protein in neuronal cells and decreased its aggregation and toxicity while not altering overall cellular mRNA synthesis. Our findings identify a cellular mechanism for transcription through repeated trinucleotides and a potential target for countermeasures against neurological disorders attributable to expanded trinucleotide regions."
https://openalex.org/W2127349963,"CXCL12/CXCR4 plays an important role in metastasis of gastric carcinoma. Rapamycin has been reported to inhibit migration of gastric cancer cells. However, the role of mTOR pathway in CXCL12/CXCR4-mediated cell migration and the potential of drugs targeting PI3K/mTOR pathway remains unelucidated. We found that CXCL12 activated PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in MKN-45 cells. Stimulating CHO-K1 cells expressing pEGFP-C1-Grp1-PH fusion protein with CXCL12 resulted in generation of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate, which provided direct evidence of activating PI3K by CXCL12. Down-regulation of p110β by siRNA but not p110α blocked phosphorylation of Akt and S6K1 induced by CXCL12. Consistently, p110β-specific inhibitor blocked the CXCL12-activated PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Moreover, CXCR4 immunoprecipitated by anti-p110β antibody increased after CXCL12 stimulation and G(i) protein inhibitor pertussis toxin abrogated CXCL12-induced activation of PI3K. Further studies demonstrated that inhibitors targeting the PI3K/mTOR pathway significantly blocked the chemotactic responses of MKN-45 cells triggered by CXCL12, which might be attributed primarily to inhibition of mTORC1 and related to prevention of F-actin reorganization as well as down-regulation of active RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. Furthermore, rapamycin inhibited the secretion of CXCL12 and the expression of CXCR4, which might form a positive feedback loop to further abolish upstream signaling leading to cell migration. Finally, we found cells expressing high levels of cxcl12 were sensitive to rapamycin in its activity inhibiting migration as well as proliferation. In summary, we found that the mTOR pathway played an important role in CXCL12/CXCR4-mediated cell migration and proposed that drugs targeting the mTOR pathway may be used for the therapy of metastatic gastric cancer expressing high levels of cxcl12."

Using high-throughput 454 transcriptome sequencing and metabolite profiling of balsam fir bark tissue, we identified candidate diterpene synthase sequences for full-length cDNA cloning and functional characterization. We discovered a bifunctional class I/II cis-abienol synthase (AbCAS), along with the paralogous levopimaradiene/abietadiene synthase and isopimaradiene synthase, all of which are members of the gymnosperm-specific TPS-d subfamily. The AbCAS-catalyzed formation of cis-abienol proceeds via cyclization and hydroxylation at carbon C-8 of a postulated carbocation intermediate in the class II active site, followed by cleavage of the diphosphate group and termination of the reaction sequence without further cyclization in the class I active site. This reaction mechanism is distinct from that of synthases of the isopimaradiene- or levopimaradiene/abietadiene synthase type, which employ deprotonation reactions in the class II active site and secondary cyclizations in the class I active site, leading to tricyclic diterpenes. Comparative homology modeling suggested the active site residues Asp-348, Leu-617, Phe-696, and Gly-723 as potentially important for the specificity of AbCAS.

Although tricyclic diterpene resin acids are ubiquitously abundant in the pine family (Pinaceae), the oleoresin of balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) contains cis-abienol 4 (see Fig. 1), a bicyclic, tertiary diterpene alcohol, as the major diterpenoid (6Gray P.S. Mills J.S.

In vitro and perhaps in vivo, 13-hydroxy-8(14)-abietene 9/10 is readily dehydrated, resulting in a mixture of abietadiene 11, palustradiene 12, levopimaradiene 13, and neoabietadiene 14 (18Keeling C.I.

The reaction mechanism of the Iso- and LAS-type diTPSs involves the initial protonation-initiated bicyclization of GGPP 1 at the class II active site, resulting in copalyl diphosphate (CPP) 5 of (9S,10S)-configuration (i.e. normal or (+)-configuration). (9S,10S)-CP-P 5 then translocates to the class I active site, where it undergoes a secondary ionization-dependent cyclization and enzyme-specific rearrangement of intermediate carbocations. In Iso-type diTPSs, direct deprotonation of the sandaracopimarenyl cation 6 results in the formation of isopimaradiene 7, whereas LAS-type diTPSs catalyze additional rearrangement and water capture at C-13, resulting in 13-hydroxy-8(14)-abietene 9/10 as the initial product (18Keeling C.I.

In contrast to the well characterized biosynthesis of tricyclic diterpenes by conifer diTPSs of the Iso- and LAS-type, a conifer gene or enzyme for the biosynthesis of cis-abienol 4 has not yet been reported. A plausible reaction sequence of cis-abienol 4 formation, catalyzed by a bifunctional conifer class I/II diTPS could proceed via water capture of a carbocation intermediate at carbon C-8 and subsequent ionization of the allylic diphosphate group without further cycloisomerization (Fig. 1). Recently, a monofunctional angiosperm diTPS catalyzing the formation of a bicyclic oxygen-containing diterpenoid, copal-8-ol diphosphate synthase from Cistus creticus (Cistaceae), has been reported (23Falara V. Pichersky E. Kanellis A.K. A copal-8-ol diphosphate synthase from the angiosperm Cistus creticus subsp. creticus is a putative key enzyme for the formation of pharmacologically active, oxygen-containing labdane-type diterpenes.Plant Physiol. 2010; 154: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This enzyme represents a class II diTPS, which catalyzes the protonation-initiated cyclization of GGPP 1 to form the hydroxylated CPP compound. In addition, Mafu et al. (24Mafu S. Hillwig M.L. Peters R.J. A novel labda-7,13e-dien-15-ol-producing bifunctional diterpene synthase from Selaginella moellendorffii.Chembiochem. 2011; 12: 1984-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) described a bifunctional class I/II diTPS, SmCPSKSL1, from the lycophyte Sellaginella moellendorffii for the formation of labda-7,13-dien-15-ol, where the primary hydroxyl group is introduced during the reaction of the class I active site. We describe here the development of a 454 transcriptome resource for balsam fir, which, in conjunction with terpenoid metabolite profiling, was used for the identification and functional characterization of a class I/II gymnosperm cis-abienol synthase (CAS). The same sequence resource also revealed two additional bifunctional class I/II diTPSs, representing the balsam fir Iso and LAS enzymes. Comparative homology modeling and site-directed mutagenesis revealed unique features of cis-abienol 4 biosynthesis and suggest functional divergence in the evolution of CAS relative to the paralogous Iso- and LAS-type diTPSs associated with substitution of key residues in the active sites. A novel feature of CAS is the formation of a tertiary diterpenol at the class II active site of a bifunctional class I/II diTPS. Two-year-old saplings of Abies balsamea var. phanerolepsis (L.) Mill. were purchased from Arbutus Grove Nursery Ltd. (North Saanich, Canada) and maintained in a greenhouse as described previously (25Miller B. Madilao L.L. Ralph S. Bohlmann J.

Needles, xylem/wood, and phloem/bark were harvested from the upper interwhorls and used fresh or flash frozen in liquid N2 for metabolite and RNA extraction, respectively. Authentic diterpene resin acid standards were purchased from Orchid Celmark (New Westminster, Canada). The corresponding diterpene olefins were synthesized from the acids at Best West Laboratories Inc. (Salt Lake City, UT) as described previously (20Ro D.K. Arimura G. Lau S.Y. Piers E. Bohlmann J.

Water was removed by the addition of anhydrous Na2SO4, and extracts were passed through 0.22-μm GHP membrane filters (PALL Corp., De Miniac, Canada). GC-MS analysis was performed on an Agilent 6890N GC (Agilent Technologies Inc., Mississauga, Canada), 7683B series autosampler and a 5975 Inert XL MS Detector at 70 eV and 1 ml min−1 helium as carrier gas using a SGE Solgel-Wax column (polyethylene glycol, 30 m, 250 μm inner diameter, 0.25-μm film) with the following GC temperature program: 40 °C for 5 min, 3 °C min−1 to 80 °C, 8 °C min−1 to 250 °C, 10 °C min−1 to 270 °C, hold 5 min, pulsed splitless injector held at 250 °C. Diterpene resin acids were extracted from samples of ∼150 mg of tissue with 1.5 ml of tert-butylmethylether following the method described by Lewinsohn et al. (26Lewinsohn E. Gijzen M. Muzika R.M.

Compound identification was achieved by comparison of mass spectra with those of authentic standards and reference mass spectral databases of the National Institute of Standards and Technology MS library searches (Wiley W9N08). Quantifications were based on three independent biological replicates. Total RNA was isolated from samples of 150 mg of bark tissue according to the method of Kolosova et al. (27Kolosova N. Miller B.

Isolation of high quality RNA from gymnosperm and angiosperm trees.BioTechniques. 2004; 36: 821-824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and mRNA was purified on Dynabeads (Invitrogen). RNA integrity and amounts were determined on a Bioanalyzer 2100 using an RNA Pico Chip (Agilent). Synthesis of cDNA as a template for PCR amplification of candidate genes was carried out with random hexamer oligonucleotides using the SMARTer cDNA rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) amplification kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). Construction of a non-normalized bark tissue cDNA library and subsequent 454 transcriptome sequencing was conducted at the McGill University and Génome Québec Innovations Centre (Montreal, Canada). The cDNA library was constructed from 200 ng of fragmented mRNA using the cDNA Rapid Library Preparation kit, GS FLX Titanium series (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's protocols. Yield of cDNA and the size range of cDNA fragments were assessed using a Bioanalyzer 2100 Pico Chip (Agilent), and 200 ng of the cDNA library were subjected to a half-plate reaction of 454 pyrosequencing using the Roche GS FLX Titanium technology. The 454 transcriptome sequencing generated 797,060 raw reads. After trimming of 5′ adapter sequences and exclusion of reads smaller than 45 bp, de novo assembly of the bark transcriptome was performed using the GS De Novo Assembler version 2.5p1 (Roche Applied Science).

Reads from these isotigs were reassembled in PHRAP (29De la Bastide M. McCombie W.R. Assembling genomic DNA sequences with PHRAP.Curr. Protoc. Bioinformatics. 2007; (Chapter 11, Unit 11.4)PubMed Google Scholar) for closer investigation. A full-length (FL) sequence of AbdiTPS4 was retrieved from the assembled transcriptome sequences. Completion of the 3′-sequences of AbdiTPS1 and -2 was achieved by 3′-RACE using the SMARTer cDNA RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) and Phusion DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Pickering, Canada) with the following PCR program: initial denaturation at 98 °C for 30 s, five cycles of denaturation at 98 °C for 20 s and extension at 72 °C for 90 s, five cycles of denaturation at 98 °C for 20 s, annealing at 70 °C for 20 s and extension at 72 °C for 90 s, 27 cycles of denaturation at 98 °C for 20 s, annealing at 65 °C for 20 s and extension at 72 °C for 90 s, and a final extension at 72 °C for 3 min. The obtained amplicons were gel-purified and ligated into pJET using the CloneJET kit (Clontech). Pseudomature versions of the FL cDNAs (starting at (K/N)REFPP) were amplified (initial denaturation at 98 °C for 30 s followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 98 °C for 10 s, annealing at 65–68 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 80 s and final extension at 72 °C for 10 min), cloned into pJET, and subcloned into the NheI/SalI and NotI restriction sites of pET28b(+) (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). All cDNA constructs were sequence-verified at the Nucleic Acid Protein Service Unit (University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada) prior to expression in Escherichia coli. Oligonucleotides used in PCR procedures are listed in supplemental Table 1. Recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21DE3-C41, Ni2+ affinity-purified as described elsewhere (16Keeling C.I.

After extraction of reaction products with 500 μl of pentane, GC-MS analysis was conducted on an Agilent 7890A GC, 7683B series autosampler and a 7000A Triple Quad MS Detector at 70 eV and 1.2 ml min−1 helium flow using an HP5ms column (5% phenyl methyl siloxane, 30 m, 250 μm inner diameter, 0.25-μm film) and the following GC temperature program: 40 °C for 2 min, 20 °C min−1 to 300 °C, hold 2 min, pulsed splitless injection (injector held at 250 °C). For the detection of diphosphate intermediates, reaction products were dephosphorylated prior to extraction by incubation with 10 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Invitrogen) for 16 h at 37 °C and analyzed on a Solgel-Wax column as described above (see “Metabolite Analysis”) with modified GC parameters: 40 °C for 2 min, 25 °C min−1 to 250 °C, hold 5 min, pulsed splitless injector held at 250 °C. Analysis of reaction products via LC-MS was performed on an Agilent 1100 series LC/MSD Trap XCT Plus MS with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) in positive mode on an Agilent Zorbax RX-Sil silica column (4.6 mm inner diameter × 150 mm × 5 μm) as reported previously (18Keeling C.I.

To enhance product purity, pentane was purified on alumina prior to use, and assays were performed in buffer pre-extracted with alumina-purified pentane. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 600 spectrometer equipped with a QNP or TCI cryoprobe (600 MHz) using deuterochloroform (CDCl3) as the solvent, which was neutralized by distillation and filtration through potassium carbonate prior to preparation of the sample. Signal positions (δ) were calculated in parts per million (ppm) as compared with tetramethylsilane (δ 0) and were measured relative to the signal of the solvent (CDCl3: δ 7.26, 1H NMR; δ 77.0, 13C NMR). Alanine substitutions of Asp-402, Asp-404, or Asp-621 of AbdiTPS4 were generated following the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene, Mississauga, Canada) with the cDNA in pET28b(+) as template and the following PCR program: initial denaturation at 98 °C for 90 s followed by 29 cycles of denaturation at 98 °C for 50 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s and extension at 72 °C for 4 min, and final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis are listed in supplemental Table 1. Multiple protein sequence alignments were performed using the CLC bio Main Workbench 5.7.1 (CLC bio, Århus, Denmark).

Additionally, IAV triggered IL-27 expression through protein kinase A and cAMP-response element-binding protein signaling, which was mediated by cyclooxygenase-2-derived prostaglandin E2. IL-27 inhibited IAV replication by STAT1/2/3 phosphorylation and activated antiviral factor protein kinase R phosphorylation. Clinical analysis showed that IL-27 levels were significantly elevated in a cohort of patients infected with IAV compared with healthy individuals and that circulating IL-27 levels were tightly and positively correlated with prostaglandin E2 levels.

In response to viral infection, the host produces chemokines, proinflammatory cytokines, and immunoregulatory cytokines.

IL-27 is a recently identified cytokine member of the IL-6/IL-12 family of type I cytokines. This cytokine consists of the heterodimeric IL-27/P28 chain and the IL-12p40-like subunit Epstein-Barr virus-induced 3 (EBI3) (8Hunter C.A.

IL-27R is composed of the T-cell cytokine receptor (TCCR/WSX-1) and the signal transducer glycoprotein 130. IL-27 binding of IL-27R activates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which drives rapid clonal expansion of naive but not memory CD4+ T cells. IL-27 also synergizes with IL-12 to trigger IFN-γ production of naive CD4+ T cells, promoting Th1 differentiation and T-bet induction (8Hunter C.A.

In addition to the immune regulatory function, many studies report that IL-27 has both antiviral and antitumor properties (14Shimizu M. Shimamura M. Owaki T. Asakawa M. Fujita K. Kudo M. Iwakura Y.

For example, IL-27 was shown to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) replication in CD4+ T cells and monocyte-derived macrophages by inducing antiviral genes (15Imamichi T. Yang J.

Additionally, IL-27 inhibits hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication, suggesting a role for this cytokine in the immunotherapeutic response against HCV, as well as HCV/HIV co-infections (18Frank A.C.

Investigating the role of IL-27 in innate immune responses and regulation of putative antiviral functions will provide details about its potential as a mediator of microbial defense (16Greenwell-Wild T. Vázquez N. Jin W. Rangel Z. Munson P.J. Wahl S.M. Interleukin-27 inhibition of HIV-1 involves an intermediate induction of type I interferon.Blood. 2009; 114: 1864-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the previous study, we conducted a protein antibody array and found that IL-27 is up-regulated in the serum of patients infected with IAV and down-regulated in response to cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibition (20Liu L. Li R. Pan Y. Chen J. Li Y. Wu J. Zhu Y. High-throughput screen of protein expression levels induced by cyclooxygenase-2 during influenza a virus infection.Clin. Chim. Acta. 2011; 412: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this study, we systematically explore the relationship between IL-27 and pathogenesis of IAV infection. We demonstrate that IL-27 is significantly up-regulated in IAV-infected A549 lung epithelial cells and freshly isolated PBMCs. We also show that IAV triggers IL-27/EBI3 promoter activity and IL-27 expression through a protein kinase A (PKA)-CREB signaling pathway and that this response is mediated by COX-2-derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The elevated IL-27 levels induced by IAV ultimately have antiviral activity and inhibit IAV replication. We further demonstrate IL-27 is significantly elevated in serum of patients infected with 2009 pandemic H1N1 and seasonal H3N2 compared with that from healthy individuals, and that circulating IL-27 levels are closely associated with PGE2 levels. All research involving human participants was approved by Institutional Review Board of the College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, in accordance with the guidelines for the protection of human subjects. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. From 2007 to 2008, serum samples were collected from 110 healthy individuals and 85 patients who were confirmed H3N2 infection. Serum samples were collected during 2009 from 20 patients with confirmed 2009 pandemic H1N1 IAV infection. These serum samples were obtained with the assistance of the Hubei provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The influenza virus strain A/Hong Kong/498/97 (H3N2) used in this study was provided by the China Center for Type Culture Collection. The virus stock was propagated in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Human lung epithelial cells (A549) were cultured in F12K medium (Invitrogen). All media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 mg/ml of streptomycin sulfate. All cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. PBMCs were collected by density centrifugation of blood diluted with an equal volume of pyrogen-free saline over Histopaque (Sigma) as previously described (21Netea M.G. Azam T. Lewis E.C. Joosten L.A. Wang M. Langenberg D. Meng X. Chan E.D. Yoon D.Y. Ottenhoff T. Kim S.H. Dinarello C.A. Mycobacterium tuberculosis induces interleukin-32 production through a caspase-1/IL-18/interferon-γ-dependent mechanism.PLoS Med. 2006; 3: e277Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). PBMCs were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 units/ml of penicillin and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin (Sigma). The cells were then infected with H3N2 (A/Hong Kong/498/97) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. ELISA was used to measure IL-27 levels in the supernatant 24 h postinfection. In some cases, cells were treated with a specific inhibitor for 2 h before viral infection. Cells were incubated in the presence of the inhibitor throughout the experiment. ELISA was used to measure IL-27 in the supernatant 24 h postinfection. For IFN-α neutralization and antiviral assays, freshly isolated PBMCs were treated with recombinant IL-27 for 2 h and culture supernatants were collected. Then IFN-α neutralization antibody or control IgG was added and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The neutralized culture supernatants were used for antiviral assays. The COX-2-expressing plasmid pCMV-tag2B-COX-2 has been previously described (22Li W. Liu Y. Mukhtar M.M. Gong R. Pan Y. Rasool S.T. Gao Y. Kang L. Hao Q. Peng G. Chen Y. Chen X. Wu J. Zhu Y. Activation of interleukin-32 pro-inflammatory pathway in response to influenza A virus infection.PloS One. 2008; 3: e1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The IL-27/EBI3 promoter (−1379/+142) was amplified from human genomic DNA by PCR with the following primers (MluI and BglII sites are underlined): 5′-CTACGCGTTCTGTCATCCCCCTT-3′ (sense), 5′-ATTAGATCTAGACATGATCCGAGGCCAGTCCTCG-3′ (antisense). The DNA fragment was then inserted into a pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) to generate an IL-27/EBI3 promoter and Luciferase gene fusion plasmid pIL-27/EBI3-Luc (−1379/+142). The primers for serial promoter truncation to generate pIL-27/EBI3-Luc (−464/+142), pIL-27/EBI3-Luc (−105/+142), and pIL-27/EBI3-Luc (+50/+142) are: pIL-27/EBI3-Luc (−464/+142): 5′-CTACGCGTGTCTCTGTATCCCTC-3′, pIL-27/EBI3-Luc (−105/+142): 5′-CTACGCGTGGCCTGTGCTCCCCA-3′, pIL-27/EBI3-Luc (+50/+142): 5′-CTACGCGTTCCCACGACGTTCCC-3′, respectively. Mutated IL-27/EBI3 promoter constructs were also generated from pIL-27/EBI3-Luc (−1379/+142) with the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). COX-2 inhibitor NS-398, MEK inhibitor PD-98059, JNK inhibitor SP600125, ERK inhibitor U0126, p38 inhibitor SB203580, PI3K inhibitor LY294002, the PKA inhibitor H-89, PKC inhibitor GF109203, EGTA, BAPTA/AM, poly(I-C), and PGE2 were all purchased from Sigma.

(Santa Cruz, CA). A polyclonal rabbit antibody specific for STAT1 (9172) and a polyclonal rabbit antibody specific for phosphorylated STAT2 (4441) and phosphorylated STAT3 (9145) were purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). IFN-α neutralization antibody (21100-2) was purchased from PBL Interferon Source (Piscataway, NJ). Recombinant human IL-27 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Cells were plated at density of 4.0 × 105 cells/plate and grown to a confluence of ∼80% at the time of transfection. The plasmid pGL3-IL-27/EBI3 and pRL-TK (Promega, Madison, WI) were allowed to co-transfect into the cells with the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent over 24 h (Invitrogen). An internal control, pRL-TK, was used to calculate the transfection efficiency. Cells were serum starved for another 24 h before being harvested for luciferase activity assays. The assay results are expressed as relative luciferase activity. The concentration of IL-27 in the serum samples and culture supernatants was measured with a LEGEND MAXTM Human IL-27 ELISA kit (BioLegend, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The kit allows the specific detection of IL-27 with no detection of IL-35 or free P28 or EBI3. Serum PGE2 levels were measured using the ParameterTM Prostaglandin E2 Immunoassay kit (R&D Systems), according to the manufacturer's instructions. IFN-α ELISA kit was purchased from R&D Systems and IL-35 ELISA kit was purchased from CUSABIO (Hubei, China). Promoter analysis was performed by online software for genomatix. Total cellular RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Dusselforf, Germany). EBI3 and P28 RNA transcription levels were detected by LightCycler® 480 II (Roche Diagnositcs) with the following primers: EBI3, 5′-GAGCCAGGTACTACGTCCAA-3′ (sense), 5′-GCTAGGCAGATCCCATCC-3′ (antisense); P28, 5′-CGCTTTGCGGAATCTCAC-3′ (sense), 5′-GGGCATGGAAGGGCTGAA-3′ (antisense). PBMCs viability and cytotoxcity induced by the chemical reagents were determined by CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution Assay (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein extracts of cultured cells were prepared by suspending cells in lysis buffer (0.01% EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% proteinase inhibitors mixture), followed by sonication and centrifugation. The nuclear protein fractions were separated using a nuclear extraction kit (Chemicon, Billerica, MA). The concentration of protein in the supernatant was quantified using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Immunoblots were visualized with the ECL detection system (Pierce) and quantified by densitometric analysis to show fold-change. ChIP assay on PBMCs cells infected with A/Hong Kong/498/97 (H3N2) was performed as described previously (23Zou F. Liu Y. Liu L. Wu K. Wei W. Zhu Y. Wu J. Retinoic acid activates human inducible nitric-oxide synthase gene through binding of RARα/RXRα heterodimer to a novel retinoic acid response element in the promoter.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 355: 494-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The bound DNA fractions were amplified by PCR with the following primers for IL-27/EBI3: 5′-GTCATGCCCCTTTCTCTGTCTGTCA-3′ and 5′-GAGAAAGACAAGAGGAAGAGGACAA-3′. For positive control, the primers for eNOS were: 5′-CTGTAGTTTCCCTAGTCCCCC-3′ and 5′-TTCCCCTCCCAGCCCCAAT-3′. A549 cells were infected with A/Hong Kong/498/97 (H3N2) at 1 multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.). Viral titers were measured at various time points postinfection with a hemagglutination assay in U-shaped plates, as previously described (24Mukhtar M.M. Li S. Li W. Wan T. Mu Y. Wei W. Kang L. Rasool S.T. Xiao Y. Zhu Y. Wu J. Single-chain intracellular antibodies inhibit influenza virus replication by disrupting interaction of proteins involved in viral replication and transcription.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2009; 41: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Relative RNA levels of IAV nucleoprotein (NP)-viral-RNA (vRNA), NP-cRNA, and NP-mRNA were detected with reverse transcription primers and real time PCR test primers. For reverse transcription: NP-vRNA, 5′-CTCACCGAGTGACATCAACATCATG-3′; NP-cRNA, 5′-AGTAGAAACAAGGGTATTTTTCTTTAATTGTCAT-3′; and NP-mRNA:oligo(dT). For real-time PCR: NP, 5′-ATCAGACCGAACGAGAATCCAGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGAGGCCCTCTGTTGATTAGTGT-3′ (antisense); and γ-actin, 5′-TCTGTCAGGGTTGGAAAGTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAATGCAAACCGCTTCCAAC-3′ (antisense). Statistical analysis was performed with the two-tailed Student's t test for comparison between two groups. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A549 cells were infected with IAV/Hong Kong/498/97 (H3N2) virus at 1 m.o.i. or stimulated with poly(I-C) (50 μg/ml), which was used to mimic the viral replication intermediate double-stranded RNA (22Li W. Liu Y. Mukhtar M.M. Gong R. Pan Y. Rasool S.T. Gao Y. Kang L. Hao Q. Peng G. Chen Y. Chen X. Wu J. Zhu Y. Activation of interleukin-32 pro-inflammatory pathway in response to influenza A virus infection.PloS One. 2008; 3: e1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). After 24 h, cell culture supernatants were harvested and ELISA was used to measure IL-27 expression. Both IAV infection and poly(I-C) treatment significantly up-regulated IL-27 expression compared with mock infection (IAV: 328 ± 14 pg/ml versus mock: 175 ± 20 pg/ml, p < 0.05; poly(I-C): 246 ± 21 pg/ml versus mock 175 ± 20 pg/ml, p < 0.05) (Fig. 1A). These findings were validated in freshly isolated human PBMCs infected with IAV strain H3N2 (m.o.i. = 1) or stimulated with 50 μg/ml of poly(I-C), and these results were also compared with mock infection (IAV: 310 ± 92 pg/ml versus mock: 98 ± 26 pg/ml, p < 0.05; poly(I-C): 198 ± 38 pg/ml versus mock: 98 ± 26 pg/ml, p < 0.05) (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the heat-inactivated IAV did not induce IL-27 expression significantly (supplemental Fig. S1A). To determine the cellular source of IL-27 in response to IAV infection or poly(I-C) stimulation, PBMCs were separated based on adherence to the culture plate: non-adherent lymphocytes were removed, leaving adherent monocytes, and each cell type was then cultured separately. IAV infection or poly(I-C) stimulation resulted in no significant difference of IL-27 production between monocytes and lymphocytes (Fig. 1C). The PBMCs infected with IAV expressed IL-27 in a time-dependent manner. IL-27 was significantly up-regulated at 6 h post-infection (hpi) (from 84 ± 21 pg/ml at 0 hpi to 342 ± 13 pg/ml at 6 hpi; p < 0.05) and peaked at 12 hpi (411 ± 39 pg/ml; 0 hpi versus 12 hpi, p < 0.05). The concentration of IL-27 began to decrease shortly after 24 hpi (312 ± 27 pg/ml; 0 versus 24 hpi, p < 0.05) and decreased further at 48 hpi, but was still significantly elevated compared with 0 hpi (167 ± 18 pg/ml; 0 versus 48 hpi, p < 0.05) (Fig. 1D). The decrease of IL-27 expression was not caused by the decline of cell viability (supplemental Fig. S1B). The mRNA of EBI3 and P28, two subunits of matured IL-27 were also transcribed in a time-dependent manner. The mRNA levels of both EBI3 and P28 were significantly up-regulated at 6 hpi. P28 mRNA reached the peak at 12 hpi. However, there was about 12 h delay for EBI3 mRNA to peak. After EBI3 and P28 reach the peak, they both began to decrease. Nevertheless, the expression levels were still significantly up-regulated compared with 0 hpi (Fig. 1E). Because IL-27 consists of IL-27/EBI3 and IL-27/P28 subunits, and EBI3 is responsible for secretion of the entire complex (25Batten M. Ghilardi N. The biology and therapeutic potential of interleukin 27.J. Mol. Med. 2007; 85: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), we investigated the mechanism by which IAV infection triggers the expression of IL-27 through IL-27/EBI3 promoter activation. Bioinformatics analysis (genomatix) determined that the IL-27/EBI3 promoter contains several consensus cis-elements, including binding sites for NF-κB, CREB, and AP1 (Fig. 2A). These data were consistent with a previous study, showing that two NF-κB binding sites are located upstream (−84 and −319) of the transcriptional start site of the IL-27/EBI3 promoter (26Poleganov M.A. Bachmann M. Pfeilschifter J. Mühl H. Genome-wide analysis displays marked induction of EBI3/IL-27B in IL-18-activated AML-derived KG1 cells. Critical role of two κB binding sites in the human EBI3 promotor.Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 2869-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, the promoter reported in that study was short and lacked some cis-element information. We therefore generated a longer construct that included more cis-elements and a longer IL-27/EBI3 promoter region into a luciferase report system. We then transfected these plasmids into A549 cells, infected the cells with IAV, and measured the luciferase activity. The luciferase assay results showed that truncation or mutation at the CREB site significantly reduced IL-27/EBI3 promoter activity induced by IAV (Fig. 2A). Additionally, when CREB expression was knocked-down with specific siRNA, IL-27/EBI3 promoter activity induced by IAV was significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). The ChIP assay showed that IAV stimulated the binding of CREB to the IL-27/EBI3 promoter. eNOS, whose expression is constitutive and CREB-dependent was used as a positive control. The binding of CREB to the eNOS promoter was not changed significantly by IAV infection (Fig. 2C). Together, these results indicate that CREB is required for activation of the IL-27/EBI3 promoter and IL-27 expression induced by IAV. To further investigate the signal transduction pathway involved in the activation of CREB induced by IAV, we used several protein kinase-specific inhibitors to screen for the kinase involved. A549 cells were pre-treated with inhibitors 2 h before transfection with pGL3-IL-27/EBI3 for 24 h and then IAV (m.o.i. = 1) was administered to the culture and cells were incubated for another 24 h. IL-27/EBI3 promoter activities were then tested. When PKA was specifically inhibited by H-89, the IAV-induced IL-27/EBI3 promoter activity was significantly decreased (Fig. 3A). No significant effect either on cell viability (supplemental Fig. S1C) or IAV expression (supplemental Fig. S1D) by the chemical inhibitors was observed. Because PKA is essential for IAV-mediated IL-27/EBI3 promoter activation, we next examined whether the PKA-specific inhibitor H-89 blocked IL-27 expression in PBMCs infected with IAV. In the presence of H-89, IL-27 expression induced by IAV was down-regulated (from 330 ± 36 to 199 ± 23 pg/ml, p < 0.05) (Fig. 3B). Similar results were observed that IL-27 expression stimulated by IAV was down-regulated when PKA was knocked down by specific siRNA (supplemental Fig. S1E). What is the role of PKA during IAV infection? We then measured PKA expression after A549 cells were infected with IAV (m.o.i. = 1) for 24 h and found that IAV stimulated PKA phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). We also examined the subcellular localization of CREB as a result of IAV infection and with or without specific PKA inhibitor treatment. Infecting A549 cells with IAV-induced CREB translocation to the nucleus and addition of H-89 inhibited this translocation (Fig. 3D). Calcium influx has been reported to play an important role in mediating PKA/CREB activation (27Grewal S.S. Fass D.M. Yao H. Ellig C.L. Goodman R.H. Stork P.J. Calcium and cAMP signals differentially regulate cAMP-responsive element-binding protein function via a Rap1-extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34433-34441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To determine whether calcium also affects CREB activation during IAV infection and regulates IL-27/EBI3 promoter activation and IL-27 expression, the cell-permeable calcium chelator EGTA or BAPTA/AM were administered to infected cells. Analysis of the luciferase activity results showed that EGTA (0.5, 1, and 2 mm) or BAPTA/AM (2 mm) significantly reduced IL-27/EBI3 promoter activity resulting from IAV infection in A549 cells (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). Additionally, EGTA (2 mm) reduced the expression of IL-27 from 289 ± 22 to 117 ± 38 pg/ml (p < 0.05), whereas BAPTA/AM (2 mm) reduced IL-27 levels to 192 ± 46 pg/ml (p < 0.05) (supplemental Fig. S2C). Also, EGTA (2 mm) and BAPTA/AM (2 mm) reduced the nuclear translocation of CREB in A549 cells (supplemental Fig. S2D). These data indicate that IAV activates CREB through the PKA signaling pathway, and leads to activation of the IL-27/EBI3 promoter and IL-27 expression. Additionally, calcium influx is upstream of PKA-CREB signaling pathway activation. COX-2 is hyperinduced during IAV infection and PGE2, the catalysis product of COX-2, mediates the PKA-CREB signaling pathway (28Fujino H. Salvi S. Regan J.W.

https://openalex.org/W2116605993,"DNA-templated macrocycles bind the ATP binding pocket of Src kinase, locking it into an inactive conformation. These small-molecule inhibitors compete with both ATP and substrate for binding and inhibit the T338I gatekeeper mutant version of Src. Protein kinases are attractive therapeutic targets, but their high sequence and structural conservation complicates the development of specific inhibitors. We recently identified, in a DNA-templated macrocycle library, inhibitors with unusually high selectivity among Src-family kinases. Starting from these compounds, we developed and characterized in molecular detail potent macrocyclic inhibitors of Src kinase and its cancer-associated 'gatekeeper' mutant. We solved two cocrystal structures of macrocycles bound to Src kinase. These structures reveal the molecular basis of the combined ATP- and substrate peptide–competitive inhibitory mechanism and the remarkable kinase specificity of the compounds. The most potent compounds inhibit Src activity in cultured mammalian cells. Our work establishes that macrocycles can inhibit protein kinases through a bisubstrate-competitive mechanism with high potency and exceptional specificity, reveals the precise molecular basis for their desirable properties and provides new insights into the development of Src-specific inhibitors with potential therapeutic relevance."
https://openalex.org/W2050950232,"Almost all eukaryotic genes are conserved, suggesting that they have essential functions. However, only a minority of genes have detectable loss-of-function phenotypes in experimental assays, and multiple theories have been proposed to explain this discrepancy. Here, we use RNA-mediated interference in C. elegans to examine how knockdown of any gene affects the overall fitness of worm populations. Whereas previous studies typically assess phenotypes that are detectable by eye after a single generation, we monitored growth quantitatively over several generations. In contrast to previous estimates, we find that, in these multigeneration population assays, the majority of genes affect fitness, and this suggests that genetic networks are not robust to mutation. Our results demonstrate that, in a single environmental condition, most animal genes play essential roles. This is a higher proportion than for yeast genes, and we suggest that the source of negative selection is different in animals and in unicellular eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2015456807,"Sialic acids are essential components of membrane glycoconjugates. They are responsible for the interaction, structure, and functionality of all deuterostome cells and have major functions in cellular processes in health and diseases. The key enzyme of the biosynthesis of sialic acid is the bifunctional UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase that transforms UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) followed by its phosphorylation to ManNAc 6-phosphate and has a direct impact on the sialylation of cell surface components. Here, we present the crystal structures of the human N-acetylmannosamine kinase (MNK) domain of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase in complexes with ManNAc at 1.64 Å resolution, MNK·ManNAc·ADP (1.82 Å) and MNK·ManNAc 6-phosphate · ADP (2.10 Å). Our findings offer detailed insights in the active center of MNK and serve as a structural basis to design inhibitors. We synthesized a novel inhibitor, 6-O-acetyl-ManNAc, which is more potent than those previously tested. Specific inhibitors of sialic acid biosynthesis may serve to further study biological functions of sialic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1968693703,"Polarity in mammalian cells emerges from the assembly of signaling molecules into extensive biochemical interaction networks. Despite their complexity, bacterial pathogens have evolved parsimonious mechanisms to hijack these systems. Here, we develop a tractable experimental and theoretical model to uncover fundamental operating principles, in both mammalian cell polarity and bacterial pathogenesis. Using synthetic derivatives of the enteropathogenic Escherichia coli guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Map, we discover that Cdc42 GTPase signal transduction is controlled by the interaction between Map and F-actin. Mathematical modeling reveals how actin dynamics coupled to a Map-dependent positive feedback loop spontaneously polarizes Cdc42 on the plasma membrane. By rewiring the pathogenic signaling circuit to operate through β-integrin stimulation, we further show how Cdc42 is polarized in response to an extracellular spatial cue. Thus, a molecular pathway of polarity is proposed, centered on the interaction between GEFs and F-actin, which is likely to function in diverse biological systems."
https://openalex.org/W1967811409,"Although the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules typically bind short peptide (p) fragments (8-10 amino acids in length), longer, ""bulged"" peptides are often be presented by MHC-I. Such bulged pMHC-I complexes represent challenges for T-cell receptor (TCR) ligation, although the general principles underscoring the interaction between TCRs and bulged pMHC-I complexes are unclear. To address this, we have explored the energetic basis of how an immunodominant TCR (termed SB27) binds to a 13-amino acid viral peptide (LPEPLPQGQLTAY) complexed to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B*3508. Using the crystal structure of the SB27 TCR-HLA B*3508(LPEP) complex as a guide, we undertook a comprehensive alanine-scanning mutagenesis approach at the TCR-pMHC-I interface and examined the effect of the mutations by biophysical (affinity measurements) and cellular approaches (tetramer staining). Although the structural footprint on HLA B*3508 was small, the energetic footprint was even smaller in that only two HLA B*3508 residues were critical for the TCR interaction. Instead, the energetic basis of this TCR-pMHC-I interaction was attributed to peptide-mediated interactions in which the complementarity determining region 3α and germline-encoded complementarity determining region 1β loops of the SB27 TCR played the principal role. Our findings highlight the peptide-centricity of TCR ligation toward a bulged pMHC-I complex."

PSPs, which have been found in all three domains of life, belong to the haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase superfamily. However, certain organisms, particularly bacteria, lack a classical PSP gene, although they appear to possess a functional phosphoserine synthetic pathway. The apparent lack of a PSP ortholog in Hydrogenobacter thermophilus, an obligately chemolithoautotrophic and thermophilic bacterium, represented a missing link in serine anabolism because our previous study suggested that serine should be synthesized from phosphoserine. Here, we detected PSP activity in cell-free extracts of H. thermophilus and purified two proteins with PSP activity. Surprisingly, these proteins belonged to the histidine phosphatase superfamily and had been annotated as cofactor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase (dPGM). However, because they possessed neither mutase activity nor the residues important for the activity, we defined these proteins as novel-type PSPs. Considering the strict substrate specificity toward l-phosphoserine, kinetic parameters, and PSP activity levels in cell-free extracts, these proteins were strongly suggested to function as PSPs in vivo. We also detected PSP activity from ""dPGM-like"" proteins of Thermus thermophilus and Arabidopsis thaliana, suggesting that PSP activity catalyzed by dPGM-like proteins may be distributed among a broad range of organisms. In fact, a number of bacterial genera, including Firmicutes and Cyanobacteria, were proposed to be strong candidates for possessing this novel type of PSP. These findings will help to identify the missing link in serine anabolism."

To this end, genome-wide and pathway-specific siRNA libraries are being employed increasingly to identify genes that regulate immune responses against a number of pathogens. In this study using calcium and cysteine protease pathway-specific siRNA libraries, we identified genes that play critical roles in modulating diverse functions of dendritic cells (DCs) during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Knockdown of many of these genes in the two pathways resulted in reduced bacterial burden within DCs. These included genes that regulated activation of transcription factors, ubiquitin-specific peptidases, and genes that are involved in autophagy and neddylation. Knockdown of certain genes increased the expression of IL-12p40 and surface densities of costimulatory molecules in an antigen- and receptor-specific manner. Increased IL-12p40 and costimulatory molecules on DCs also promoted the development of Th1 responses from a Th2 inducing antigen. Furthermore, modulation of autophagy and oxidative burst appeared to be one of the mechanisms by which these genes regulated survival of M. tuberculosis within DCs. Although some genes regulated specific responses, others regulated multiple responses that included IL-12 production, T cell priming, as well as intracellular survival of M. tuberculosis. Further dissection of the mechanisms such as neddylation, by which these genes regulate immune responses, would improve our understanding of host parameters that are modulated during M. tuberculosis infection."
https://openalex.org/W1989863542,"The molecular complexes containing CARMA proteins have been recently identified as a key components in the signal transduction pathways that regulate activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcription factor. Here, we used immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry to identify cellular binding partners of CARMA proteins. Our data indicate that the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor Net1 binds to CARMA1 and CARMA3 in resting and activated cells. Net1 expression induces NF-κB activation and cooperates with BCL10 and CARMA proteins in inducing NF-κB activity. Conversely, shRNA-mediated abrogation of Net1 results in impaired NF-κB activation following stimuli that require correct CARMA-BCL10-MALT1 complex formation and functioning. Microarray expression data are consistent with a positive role for Net1 on NF-κB activation. Thus, this study identifies Net1 as a CARMA-interacting molecule and brings important information on the molecular mechanisms that control NF-κB transcriptional activity."
https://openalex.org/W2031165270,"DNA gyrase catalyzes ATP-dependent negative supercoiling of DNA by a strand passage mechanism that requires coordinated opening and closing of three protein interfaces, the N-, DNA-, and C-gates. ATP binding to the GyrB subunits of gyrase causes dimerization and N-gate closure. The closure of the N-gate is a key step in the gyrase catalytic cycle, as it captures the DNA segment to be transported and poises gyrase toward strand passage. We show here that K(+) ions are required for DNA supercoiling but are dispensable for ATP-independent DNA relaxation. Although DNA binding, distortion, wrapping, and DNA-induced narrowing of the N-gate occur in the absence of K(+), nucleotide-induced N-gate closure depends on their presence. Our results provide evidence that K(+) ions relay small conformational changes in the nucleotide-binding pocket to the formation of a tight dimer interface at the N-gate by connecting regions from both GyrB monomers and suggest an important role for K(+) in synchronization of N-gate closure and DNA-gate opening."
