https://openalex.org/W2144471538,"Transcription of Ad2 DNA templates in the presence of crude cellular extracts supplemented with exogenous (purified) RNA polymerase II is selectively and accurately initiated at the major late viral promoter at map position 16.45. Specific initiation has been demonstrated by a combination of hybridization, nuclease S1 mapping, size and partial sequence (fingerprint) analyses of the transcripts generated with various templates. With intact Ad2 DNA, transcription is terminated ell before the end of the 28 kb transcription unit is reached. With truncated templates (which contain intact promoter regions and several hundred base pair segments of the transcribed region) the expected run-off products are observed, along with a low level of prematurely terminated transcripts. The 560 nucleotide run-off product of the Sma l-f template (coordinates 11.6-18.2) was shown to contain all the large RNAase T1 oligonuc eotides that are characteristic of the corresponding in vivo transcript from this region; in addition, the 5 terminal undecanucleotide appears to be both capped and methylated. We have investigated various parameters (salt, metal ion and template concentrations) that affect the level of specific transcription in the crude system and have found that, under optimal conditions, specific transcription of Ad2 DNA continues for several hours. In addition, specific transcription initiation at the late promoter is observed with extracts derived from either virus-infected or uninfected KB cells and with class II RNA polymerases isolated from either human calf, murine or amphibian cells. RNA polymerase II from wheat germ does not function in this system."
https://openalex.org/W2068861284,"In this study, we have located the sites of transcription initiation and termination on a cloned fragment of ribosomal DNA from X. laevis, and have sequenced the surrounding nucleotides. As reported previously (Reeder, Sollner-Webb and Wahn, 1977), about 25% of the 40S rRNA precursor molecules isolated from oocytes have polyphosphate 5' termini and are therefore presumed to represent primary transcripts. These ends hybridize specifically to the 221 bp DNA fragment and removed the overhanging DNA region with S1 nuclease. In the other, we hybridized 40S RNA to a 221 bp fragment of ribosomal DNA. The nucleotides encoding the 5' end of the 40S RNA were located more precisely by two methods. In one, we hybridized 40S RNA to the 221 bp DNA fragment and removed the overhanging DNA region with S1 nuclease. In the other, we hybridized 40S RNA to a smaller DNA fragment and extended the recessed 3' terminus of the DNA using reverse transcriptase. The resultant DNA fragments were sized on sequencing gels. Both determinations map the 5' end of 40S RNA at the same site in the rDNA, about 2250 bp upstream from the Eco RI site in the 18S rRNA coding sequence. At this site we find a DNA sequence beginning AGGGGAAGAC.... which agrees with partial sequence data from the 5' end of polyphosphorylated and bulk 40S rRNA. Features of this region of the ribosomal DNA will be discussed in this paper. A 227 nucleotide region surrounding the initiation site was also sequenced from an independently derived clone and found to differ in only one nucleotide. In addition, a sequence is found about 1100 nucleotides upstream from the 5' end of the gene that has 90% homology to the sequence from nucleotides minus 125 to +4 in the initiation region. At the termination region, X. laevis ribosomal DNA has a single recognition site for the restriction enzyme Hind III in each repeating unit. Using the S1 nuclease technique, the 3' termini of both the 40S precursor and mature 28S rRNA are seen to map within this recognition sequence. The sequence surrounding the Hind III site has striking homology to termination sites recognized by other RNA polymerase classes. Sequences with similar features are also found upstream from the initiation site."

Cooperation is inhibited by 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate, rescuing the 6-thioguanine-resistant cells. These results may be useful in the study of an aspect of the mechanism of tumor promotion and in assaying for promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2092497125,Micropipettes containing 2 to 50 biological units of beta growth factor (NGF) were placed near growing axons of chick dorsal-root ganglion neurons in tissue culture. The axons turned and grew toward the NGF source within 21 minutes. This turning response to elevated concentrations of NGF appears to represent chemotactic guidance rather than a general enhancement of growth rate.
https://openalex.org/W2014036948,"In the rat, there are two nonallelic genes for preproinsulin. The insulin end products are very similar and are equally expressed. We have isolated clones carrying these genes and their flanking sequences, and characterized them by DNA sequencing and electron microscopic analysis. We have established the primary structure of the preproinsulin mRNAs and the signal peptides of these two proteins. One of the genes contains two introns: a 499 bp intron interrupting the region encoding the connecting peptide and a 119 bp intron interrupting the segment encoding the 5 noncoding region of the mRNA. The introns are transcribed and present in a preproinsulin mRNA precursor. The other gene possesses the smaller, but not the larger, of the two introns. Calculations based on the divergence of the two preproinsulin nucleotide and amino acid sequences indicate that these genes are the products of a recent duplication. Thus one of the genes gained or lost an intron since that time."

https://openalex.org/W1992500403,"Golgi-stained dendrites of single randomly chosen layer-II pyramidal neurons in the human parahippocampal gyrus were quantified with a computer-microscope system. In nondemented aged cases (average age, 79.6 years), dendritic trees were more extensive than in adult cases (average age, 51.2), with most of the difference resulting from increases in the number and average length of terminal segments of the dendritic tree. These results provide morphological evidence for plasticity in the mature and aged human brain. In senile dementia (average age, 76.0), dendritic trees were less extensive than in adult brains, largely because their terminal segments were fewer and shorter. Cells with shrunken dendritic trees were found in all brains. These data suggest a model of aging in the central nervous system in which one population of neurons dies and regresses and the other survives and grows. The latter appears to be the dominant population in aging without dementia."
https://openalex.org/W2021363841,"Measurements of cerebral blood flow in man revealed that complex voluntary movements are associated with a blood flow increase in the supplementary motor area of the brain. This increase is additional to and similar in magnitude to the Rolandic sensorimotor area activation that occurs during all kinds of movement. When subjects counted silently there was no activation of any focal cortical area in the brain; when they counted aloud there was a marked increase in activity in the supplementary motor area. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the supplementary motor area plays a major role in the initiation and control of at least some kinds of voluntary movement in man and is, therefore, a motor center of a higher order than the primary Rolandic areas."
https://openalex.org/W2562425209,"In this study, we examined cell-to-cell communication via gap junctional channels between the cells of the early mouse embryo from the 2-cell stage to the preimplantation blastocyst stage. The extent of communication was examined by monitoring for the presence of ionic coupling, the transfer of injected fluorescein (molecular weight 330) and the transfer of injected horseradish peroxidase (molecular weight 40,000). In the 2-cell, 4-cell and precompaction 8-cell embryos, cytoplasmic bridges between sister blastomeres were responsible for ionic coupling and the transfer of injected fluorescein as well as the transfer of injected horseradish peroxidase. In contrast, no communication was observed between blastomeres from different sister pairs. Junction-mediated intercellular communication was unequivocably detected for the first time in the embryo at the early compaction stage (late 8-cell embryo). At that stage, ionic coupling was present and fluorescein injected into one cell spread to all eight cells of the embryo. Injected horseradish peroxidase was passed to only one other cell, however, again indicating the presence of cytoplasmic bridges between sister blastomeres. Junctional communication with respect to both ionic coupling and dye transfer was retained between all the cells throughout compaction. At the blastocyst stage, trophoblast cells of the blastocyst were linked by junctional channels to other trophoblast cells as well as to cells of the inner cell mass, as indicated by the spread of injected fluorescein. In addition, the extent of communication between the cells of the inner cell mass was examined in inner cell masses isolated by immunosurgery; both ionic coupling and the complete spread of injected fluorescein were observed."

https://openalex.org/W2074008084,Results from experiments with rats support the proposition that tolerance to the hypothermic effect of alcohol involves the Pavlovian conditioning of compensatory responses. Tolerance was substantially reduced when alcohol was administered in an environment that had not been associated with alcohol. Direct evidence of a conditioned hyperthermic compensatory response was found.
https://openalex.org/W2018669799,"The two nonallelic genes, insulin I and II of the rat, are separated by at least 7 kb of DNA. There is no obvious similarity in the sequence organization surrounding each gene, although the coding regions of the genes themselves share extensive homology. In three strains of rat, the insulin II gene lies predominantly on a 4.0 kb Eco RI restriction fragment, whereas the insulin I gene is located on a 9.4 kb Eco RI fragment in the Hooded strain, on a 7.2 kb Eco RI fragment in the Osborne-Mendel strain, and on both a 9.4 and a 7.2 kb Eco RI fragment in Sprague-Dawley rats. The 9.4 kb Eco RI fragment from Hooded rat DNA was isolated using the lambda cloning system, and the nucleotide sequence of this isolated rat insulin I gene and adjacent regions was determined. A translation in one frame of the sequence of the cloned gene confirms the protein sequence determined for rat pre-proinsulin I. The coding region of this gene lacks intervening sequences, although a presumptive intervening sequence of 119 bp is located in the 5′ untranslated region preceding the prehormone sequence. The junctions around the 119 bp segment are identical to those which flank intervening sequences of other eucaryotic genes, AGGT. The site of polyadenylation was determined by direct sequence comparison with rat insulin cDNA clones, and a potential 5′ “capping” site is proposed. A DNA sequence preceding this 5′ “capping” site in the rat insulin I gene, TATAAAGC, is homologous to corresponding regions in other eucaryotic genes that have been proposed as putative promoter sites for the initiation of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2080086970,"Subcutaneous and intracerebral injections of calcitonin inhibited feeding in rats. The anorectic activity of calcitonin was destroyed by exposing the hormone to heat, trypsin, or hydrogen peroxide. Calcitonin did not produce a conditioned taste aversion to saccharin, and maximum inhibition of feeding occurred 4.5 to 8.3 hours after subcutaneous administration. It is concluded that calcitonin inhibits feeding by acting directly on the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1975953566,"We studied the extent of cell-to-cell communication via junctional channels in in vitro-implanted mouse blastocysts by monitoring ionic coupling and the spread of two injected low molecular weight dyes, fluorescein and Lucifer yellow. In the early attached embryos, both trophoblasts and cells of the inner cell mass (ICM) were ionically coupled to one another. Dye injections in either trophoblasts or ICM cells resulted in spread to the entire embryo. As older and more developed embryos were examined, the spread of injected dye was progressively more limited. In the most developed embryos examined, dye injected into a cell in the ICM region resulted in spread throughout the ICM but not into the surrounding trophoblast cells, while dye injected into a trophoblast cell did not spread to any other cell in the embryo. Simultaneous monitoring of ionic coupling and dye injections in embryos of intermediate stages in this transition revealed that the trophoblast and ICM cells were ionically coupled, even across the apparent boundary where no dye was observed to pass. In the latest stage embryos examined in which no injected dye was observed to move out of the ICM, ionic coupling was still observed between the cells of the ICM and the trophoblasts. Furthermore, in the more developed embryos, dye injected into the ICM region frequently was not transferred to all the cells of the ICM, thus suggesting a further compartmentalization of dye spread within the ICM. Our observations that ionic coupling is more extensive than the detectable spread of injected dyes may perhaps reflect a reduced number of junctional channels. With fewer channels less dye would pass between cells, so that, together with continuous quenching, the transfer of injected dye would not be detectable. This partial segregation of cell-to-cell communication as indicated by the limited dye spread may parallel specific differentiation processes, in particular that of giant trophoblast, embryonic ectoderm and extraembryonic endoderm differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2018577774,"Eucaryotic mRNAs serve as primers for influenza viral RNA transcription in vitro and donate their 5′ terminal methylated cap and a short stretch of internal nucleotides to the resulting viral RNA transcripts ( Plotch et al., 1979 Plotch S.J. Bouloy M. Krug R.M. Transfer of 5′ terminal cap of globin mRNA to influenza viral complementary RNA during transcription in vitro. in: Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA. 76. 1979: 1618-1622 Google Scholar ). If a similar mechanism operates in vivo, then the viral mRNA synthesized in the infected cell would contain a short stretch of nucleotides at its 5′ end, including the cap, which is not viral-coded. This study was undertaken to establish whether such a nonviral sequence exists in in vivo viral mRNA. Gel electrophoresis analysis indicated that the segments of in vivo viral mRNA were 10–15 nucleotides longer at their 5′ end than the segments of ApG-primed complementary RNA synthesized in vitro. As the latter segments initiate exactly at the 3′ end of the virion RNA templates, this result indicates that the segments of in vivo viral mRNA contain 10–15 nucleotides at their 5′ end which are not viral-coded. In addition, when 3H-methyl-labeled in vivo viral mRNA was hybridized to virion RNA, the 5′ terminal cap structure of the mRNA was not protected against pancreatic or T1 RNAase digestion. One of the three 6-methyladenosine (m6A) residues found per chain of viral mRNA was also not protected. These results strongly suggest that host cell mRNAs serve as primers for viral RNA transcription in the infected cell, and that they donate their cap and 10–15 internal nucleotides, one of which is m6A, to the resulting viral mRNA molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2065139212,"Sequence analysis of the cloned genomic fibroin gene and cDNA containing the sequence complementary to fibroin mRNA has been carried out for the regions covering the 5′ flanking, mRNA coding, entire intervening sequence and its borders, and fibroin coding sequences. The sequences determined on the gene extend from nucleotide −552 to +1497 (assigning +1 to the cap locus); sequence analysis of the cDNA has confirmed our previous mapping of the cap locus ( Tsujimoto and Suzuki, 1979 Tsujimoto Y. Suzuki Y. Structural analysis of the fibroin gene at the 5' end and its surrounding regions. Cell. 1979; 16: 425-436 Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar ). Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the genomic gene with that of cDNA has confirmed the existence of an intervening sequence 970 bases long. The sequence comparison also pinpointed the 5′ coding-intervening junction at +64−66 and the 3′ intervening-coding junction at +1034−1036. Both the 5′ and 3′ junctions of the fibroin gene (insect) share homologous segments of about 10 nucleotides each with the published sequences of β-globin (mammal), immunoglobulin (mammal) and ovalbumin (avian) genes. A long inverted repeat sequence (17 of 23 base match) has been found next to the junctions within the intervening sequence of the fibroin gene. The repetitious sequence that codes for the Gly-Ala peptide characteristic of fibroin protein begins at position +1448. The characteristics of the N terminal portion of fibroin protein (or its precursor) are discussed, as are the features of the 5′ flanking sequence of the gene and the mRNA sequence (with special attention to the putative promoter sequence for the gene), the possible secondary structure and a sequence complementary to the 3′ end of 18S ribosomal RNA at the 5′ proximal region of fibroin mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W1999020300,"In this paper we describe a procedure for detecting proteins associated with cytoplasmic microtubules in vivo. Detergent-extracted cytoskeletons of NIL8 hamster cells are prepared under conditions which preserve the microtubules. The cytoskeletons are then extracted in the presence of calcium, which depolymerizes the microtubules and quantitatively extracted cytoskeletons are prepared from cells that have been incubated with colchicine. The cytoskeletons from these cells contain no microtubules or tubulin. Electrophoretic analysis of the calcium extracts of the colchicine-treated and untreated cells reveals several radioactively labeled polypeptides. There is, however, no apparent quantitative or qualitative difference between the two extracts other than the tubulin polypeptides. Each of the extracts is mixed with an excess of unlabeled calf brain microtubule protein and carried through cycles of temperature-dependent microtubule assembly. Distinct species from each extract co-assemble at a constant ratio, but only one polypeptide is uniquely derived from cells containing intact microtubules. The molecular weight of this polypeptide is similar to that proposed for the tau species detected in brain microtubule preparations."
https://openalex.org/W2012136538,"The main binding site for mammalian ribosomes on the single-stranded RNA of bacteriophage MS2 is located nine tenths of the way through the coat protein gene. Translation initiated at an AUG triplet in the +1 frame yields a 75 amino acid polypeptide which terminates within the synthetase gene at a UAA codon, also in the +1 frame. Partial amino acid sequence analysis of the product synthesized in relatively large amounts by mammalian ribosomes confirms this assignment of the overlapping cistron. The same protein is made in an E. coli cell-free system, but only in very small amounts. Analysis of the translation products directed by RNA from op3, a UGA nonsense mutant of phage f2, identifies the overlapping cistron as a lysis gene. In this paper we show that the op3 mutation is a C → U transition occurring in the second codon of the synthetase cistron, which explains the lowered production of phage replicase (as well as lack of lysis) upon op3 infection of nonpermissive cells. We discuss the properties of the overlapping gene in relation to its lysis function, recognition of the lysis initiator region by E. coli versus eucaryotic ribosomes and op3 as a ribosome binding site mutant for the f2 synthetase cistron."
https://openalex.org/W1569382117,"A method for preparing human platelet membranes with high adenylate cyclase activity is described. Using these membranes, epinephrine and GTP individually are noted to inhibit adenylate cyclase slightly. When present together, epinephrine and GTP act synergistically to cause a 50% inhibition of basal activity. The epinephrine effect is an alpha-adrenergic process as it is reversed by phentolamine but not propranolol. The quasi-irreversible activation of adenylate cyclase by Gpp(NH)p is time, concentration, and Mg2+-dependent but is not altered by the presence of epinephrine. Adenylate cyclase activated by Gpp(NH)p, and extensively washed to remove unbound Gpp(NH)p, is inhibited by the subsequent addition of Gpp(NH)p, GTP, and epinephrine. This effect of epinephrine is also an alpha-adrenergic phenomenon. In contrast to epinephrine which inhibits the cyclase, PGE1 addition results in enzyme stimulation. PGE1 stimulation does not require GTP addition. PGE1 accelerates the rate of Gpp(NH)p-induced activation. Low GTP concentrations (less than 1 x 10(-6) M) enhance PGE1 stimulation while higher GTP concentrations cause inhibition. These observations suggest that human platelet adenylate cyclase possesses at least two guanine nucleotide sites, one which interacts with the alpha-receptor to result in enzyme inhibition and a second guanine nucleotide site which interacts with the PGE1 receptor and causes enzyme stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2163821720,"Analysis of the composition of cell surface-associated glycoproteins of D. discoideum by lactoperoxidase-catalyzed radioiodination, followed by isolation by Con A-Sepharose chromatography, revealed that the developmentally regulated cell surface expression of a certain glycoprotein (gp150) parallels the onset of mutual cellular cohesiveness ( Geltosky et al., 1976 Geltosky J.E. Siu C.-H. Lerner R.A. Glycoproteins of the plasma membrane of Dictyostelium discoideum during development. Cell. 1976; 8: 391-396 Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar ). We have purified gp150 and raised specific antibodies to it. Through utilization of the specific antibody and a fluorescence-activated cell sorter, the expression of gp150 on the cell surface has been studied. Starting from a low level in noncohesive (vegetative) cells, there is a rapid accumulation of gp150 on the surfaces of aggregating cells. A peak level of expression is achieved by 10 hr and maintained at least until the steps of terminal differentiation. Most significantly, monovalent Fab' derived from anti-gp150, when added to aggregation-competent cells, blocks the cells' ability to reaggregate. Fab's derived from antisera with different specificities were ineffective inhibitors of cell aggregation. These results suggest that gp150 serves an intimate role in cell adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2037649796,"The tertiary structures of all liganded hemoglobins in the R state differ in detail. Steric hindrance arising from nonbonded ligand-globin interactions affects the binding of ligands such as CO and cyanide which preferentially form linear axial complexes to heme; these ligands bind in a strained off-axis configuration. Ligands such as O2 and NO, which preferentially form bent complexes, encounter less steric hindrance and can bind in their (preferred) unstrained configuration. Linear complexes distort the ligand pockets in the R state (and by inference, in the T state) more than bent complexes. These structural differences between linear and bent complexes are reflected in the kinetic behavior of hemoglobin. Structural interpretation of this kinetic behavior indicates that the relative contributions of nonbonded ligand-globin interactions and nonbonded heme interactions to transition state free energies differ for linear and bent ligands. The relative contributions of these interactions to the free energy of cooperativity may also differ for linear and bent ligands. Thus the detailed molecular mechanism by which the affinity of heme is regulated differs for different ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1600654501,"Application of new hexokinase accessibility method for the measurement of bound (/sup 32/P)ATP during steady state photophosphorylation by chloroplast thylakoids, together with mixing-quenching and filtration techniques has shown the following. (1) Two classes of bound ATP exist: a transitorily tightly bound class that represents a catalytic intermediate and a noncatalytic class of tightly bound ATP that is labeled much more slowly, presumably from medium components. Thylakoids filtered after a few seconds of photophosphorylation have some of both classes present. Thus, ATP may remain bound at a catalytic site on membranes in the absence of continued energization. (2) During steady state photophosphorylation, the sum of catalytically competent bound ATP plus P/sub i/ is considerably greater than 1/chloroplast ATP synthase complex even when substrate concentration limits the synthesis rate. At a given instant, therefore, most or all phosphorylation complexes are functional, with the simultaneous participation of more than one catalytic site/enzyme. (3) During photophosphorlyation, with substrate concentration well below K/sub m/ values, most ATP synthase complexes retain a bound, catalytic ATP. This behavior is not consistent with independent catalytic sites. These results give additional support to the view developed in this laboratory that ATP synthesis is accomplished by a mechanism in whichmore » two catalytic sites are functioning alternately on the ATP synthase. This mechanism proposes that energy-linked conformational changes in the ATP synthase promote binding of P/sub i/ and ADP in mode competent for ATP synthesis at one catalytic site and concomitantly the release of tightly bound ATP from an alternate site.« less"

https://openalex.org/W2071789894,"The twelve most abundant transcripts in X. laevis mitochondria were characterized, and their coding regions were mapped on the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) by R loop mapping in the electron microscope and by RNA gel transfer hybridization. The transcripts map in nonoverlapping positions with one exception, and they account for about 80% of the coding capacity of mtDNA. Ten of the twelve RNA molecules contain poly(A); the two poly(A)-lacking transcripts are the rRNAs. Analysis with single-strand-specific nucleases clearly demonstrated the absence of intervening sequences from the coding regions for seven RNAs. For two RNAs, uninterrupted coding sequences are strongly suggested and one RNA could not be analyzed. Eight transcripts of low abundance and high molecular weight were characterized, and their coding regions were mapped approximately. They overlap the coding regions of the abundant mitochondrial RNAs and could be precursors of these RNAs. Most of the RNA molecules characterized were shown to be transcribed from the heavy strand of mtDNA. No abundant discrete light-strand transcript was found."

https://openalex.org/W2069172395,"Clones of CHO cells stably resistant to colcemid have been isolated in the presence of the nonionic detergent Tween 80 after mutagen treatment. Successive single-step selections for increasing resistance were performed resulting in lines after three selection steps about 10 fold more resistant to colcemid than the parental cells. Three observations indicate that these colcemid-resistant (CMR) mutants are different from the colchicine-resistant permeability mutants isolated previously. First, their relative resistance to colcemid was not diminished in the presence of detergent which promoted increased drug permeability. Second, the CMR clones displayed limited cross-resistances only to tubulin-binding compounds. Third, the binding affinity of labeled colcemid by cytoplasmic extracts from CMR clones was reduced, and the reduction was greater in the more resistant clones. No reduction in binding of labeled colcemid was observed in the membrane-altered colchicine-resistant mutants. All these observations are consistent with the CMR clones being tubulin-altered mutants. In further support of this conclusion, we observed that tubulin purified from a CMR mutant still possessed reduced colcemid-binding affinity compared with that from parental cells."

https://openalex.org/W1964061683,"We studied the transcription of the intervening sequence in the 26S rRNA coding region of the extrachromosomal rDNA molecules in the macronucleus of T. thermophila by hybridization of purified nuclear rRNA precursors or cytoplasmic 26S rRNA to purified native rDNA or specific rDNA restriction fragments. Examination of R loop hybrids in the electron microscope and analyses of S1-protected rDNA fragments in alkaline agarose gels showed that mature 26S rRNA, nuclear pre-26S rRNA and a fraction of the pre-rRNA molecules containing both the sequences for 17S and 26S rRNA all lack the region corresponding to the intervening sequence. The rest of the pre-rRNA molecules, however, hybridize in a colinear fashion to the whole coding region, and thus must contain the intervening sequence. We can conclude from these results that the intervening sequence is transcribed within the primary transcription product of the rDNA, and that the post-transcriptional removal of the intervening RNA sequence is a very early processing event in the organism."
https://openalex.org/W2044288748,"Using histones reconstituted with RNA and DNA celluloses, we have shown elsewhere that histones elute identically with salt from single- and double-stranded DNA, but differently from RNA ( Palter and Alberts, 1979 Palter K.B. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; (in press) Google Scholar ). In this paper we characterize further the suspected specific binding interactions between histones and single-stranded DNA. Nuclease digestion of complexes of histone reconstituted with single-stranded DNA generates only a small yield of discrete (∼9S) particles. We can, however, efficiently obtain such 9S “nucleosome-like” complexes when nuclease treatment is avoided and histones are reconstituted directly with short single-stranded DNA pieces. Strikingly, these 9S subunits contain an equimolar composition of the four nucleosomal histones. When these subunits are visualized in the electron microscope, they appear as globular particles which are morphologically indistinguishable from normal mononucleosomes. Based on their sedimentation properties, histone-to-DNA ratio, histone composition and particle diameter, we conclude that they represent an octamer of the four histones (containing two molecules of each histone) associated with single-stranded DNA. These data, viewed in the context of other information concerning chromatin, suggest that nucleosome cores may become transiently bound to single strands of DNA as DNA and RNA polymerases pass."
https://openalex.org/W1523408240,"Lactate oxidase forms tight complexes with a variety of mono- and dicarboxylic acids. Most of these undergo facile photoreactions involving decarboxylation of the carboxylic acid and formation of covalent adducts at position N(5) of the flavin, characterized by absorption maxima from 325 to 365 nm and fluorescence emission in the range 440 to 490 nm. The properties of the adducts are strongly dependent on the nature of the substituent. Enzyme-bound N(5)-acyl adducts and N(5)-CH2-R derivatives are stable in the dark. Glycollyl- and alpha-lactyl adducts, however, decay to oxidized enzyme with half-lives in the order of minutes. Upon denaturation of the enzyme, the N(5)-alkyl adducts decay rapidly or are oxidized by oxygen. Reduced lactate oxidase is also photoalkylated in the presence of halogenated carboxylic acids. Bromoacetate yields an N(5)-carboxymethyl adduct; with beta-bromopropionate, a C(4a)-beta-propionyl derivate is formed. The N(5) adduct is identical with that from the photochemical reaction of oxidized enzyme and malonic acid. When the native coenzyme FMN is substituted by 2-S-FMN, qualitatively the same photoproducts are formed. The adducts obtained with the 2-S-FMN enzyme show the expected bathochromic shifts in absorption spectra. The results indicate that the photoreactivity of the enzyme is restricted to the positions C(4a) and N(5) of the flavin."

This example of organic chemical microanalysis in situ in pathological tissue represents an extension of microanalytical capabilities from elemental analysis, performed with electron and ion microprobes, to compound-specific molecular microanalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2117980344,"Proteoglycans isolated under associative conditions in the presence of protease inhibitors from human nucleus pulposus contained 17% aggregate and 83% non-aggregating monomer (Kav = 0.5 on Sepharose CL-2B). Isolated aggregate after reduction and alkylation was resolved into two components (Kav = 0.15 and 0.43) on Sepharose CL-2B. Labeled proteoglycans isolated from parallel samples pulsed with [35S]sulfate and chased for up to 18 h were present largely as aggregated material (up to 78%). Reduction and alkylation of the labeled samples gave a labeled proteoglycan monomer with Kav = 0.15. Both the labeled and unlabeled chondroitin sulfate chains had the same distribution on Sepharose CL-6B and equivalent molecular weights (Mr = 2.0 x 10(3)). After chondroitinase ABC digestion, the unlabeled keratan sulfate-protein core was polydisperse with a Kav = 0.38 on Sepharose CL-4B while the labeled keratan sulfate-protein core had a Kav = 0.05. This indicates that the newly synthesized proteoglycan had a large core protein and suggests that the proteoglycans present in nucleus pulposus are originally synthesized as large molecular weight, aggregating proteoglycans."
https://openalex.org/W2029243882,We have isolated a conditional lethal mutant of bacteriophage f2 which makes plaques only on E. coli strains carrying a UGA suppressor. It grows normally in nonsuppressing hosts but does not lyse such strains. The mutation complements with amber mutations in each of the three known phage cistrons. These observations lead us to postulate the existence of a fourth gene in the RNA phage.
https://openalex.org/W2046042559,"On the earth, or in level flight, a blindfolded subject being rotated at constant velocity about his recumbent long body axis experiences illusory orbital motion of his body in the opposite direction. By contrast, during comparable rotation in the free-fall phase of parabolic flight, no body motion is perceived and all sense of external orientation may be lost; when touch and pressure stimulation is applied to the body surface, a sense of orientation is reestablished immediately. The increased gravitoinertial force period of a parabola produces an exaggeration of the orbital motion experienced in level flight. These observations reveal an important influence of touch, pressure, and kinesthetic information on spatial orientation and provide a basis for understanding many of the postural illusions reported by astronauts in space flight."
https://openalex.org/W1517005261,"The cellular synthesis of parathyroid hormone (PTH) involves two consecutive cleavages of NH2-terminal peptide sequences from a larger precursor, pre-proparathyroid hormone (Pre-ProPTH). The initial cleavage consists of the removal of an NH2-terminal leader sequence either during or shortly after biosynthesis of the polypeptide chain is complete. To determine the fate of the cleaved leader sequence, we prepared, by chemical synthesis, a peptide based on the known structure of the leader sequence of pre-proparathyroid hormone and used this peptide labeled with 125iodine as a marker to monitor the recovery of the putative cellular leader peptide during extraction and electrophoresis of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins from pulse-labeled parathyroid gland slices. Under conditions in which the recovery of the synthetic leader peptide was 50 to 70%, we found no detectable 35S-labeled product in the region of sodium dodecyl sulfate gels where the synthetic peptide migrates. In view of the known methionine content of pre-proparathyroid hormone and proparathyroid hormone (ProPTH), it would have been possible to detect endogenously labeled leader peptide if present in amounts equal to 0.05% of the amount of labeled ProPTH present in the tissues. These observations indicate that the cellular conversion of Pre-ProPTH to ProPTH involves a rapid hydrolysis of the leader peptide either during or immediately after its removal from the precursor."

Electrophysiological recording revealed that detailed visual topography in the nucleus is abnormal and that single cells have unusually large receptive fields. These results suggest that optic axons deprived of their normal synaptic targets rearrange their connections to converge on local surviving neurons."

https://openalex.org/W2031147713,"Silk fibroins from a number of B mori strains have been compared, and at least six different polypeptide size phenotypes, which show apparent molecular weights of 365,000–415,000 in SDS polyacrylamide gels, have been identified. Analysis of the corresponding fibroin messenger RNAs in denaturing gels shows that mRNA size is largely correlated with polypeptide length. The mRNAs vary in size from 5.50 × 106 to 6.30 × 106 daltons. It has been shown elsewhere that the translation of silk fibroin mRNA in a reticulocyte cell-free system proceeds discontinuously. In this paper, I demonstrate that this discontinuous translation phenomenon can be exploited to map the location of divergent amino acid sequences in fibroin variants. SDS gel analysis of translational pause patterns shows that divergence arises internally after a relatively long amino-terminal sequence which appears to be conserved. Two-dimensional gel analysis using V8 protease digestion in the second dimension produces fingerprints of fibroin peptide fragments ordered from the amino to the carboxyl terminus of the protein. These fingerprints provide additional evidence for extensive internal divergence of the fibroins and a reduced degree of divergence near the termini. A plausible explanation for the observed genetic variability is the occurrence of relatively large unequal crossing-over exchanges in the repetitive domain of the fibroin gene."
https://openalex.org/W1561126615,"Intravenous administration of L-[methyl-3H]-labeled trimethyllysine to rats results in a very rapid accumulation of radioactivity by the kidneys, while the incorporation of the label into the liver occurs at approximately 1% of this rate when calculated per g of wet tissue. The kidneys convert a substantial portion of the trimethyllysine taken up to butyrobetaine and to beta-hydroxytrimethyllysine, a precursor of butyrobetaine, but fail to synthesize carnitine. Significant amounts of radioactivity are recovered in both carnitine and butyrobetaine of hepatic tissue after longer time periods, while the level of labeled trimethyllysine in this organ remains very low. Bilateral nephrectomy results in a marked decrease in the incorporation of label into the liver. These results indicate that in rats, the initial conversion of trimethyllysine to butyrobetaine occurs predominantly in kidney and that the liver capacity for this transformation is considerably smaller than its capacity to synthesize carnitine from butyrobetaine."

https://openalex.org/W1974294668,"An approach to increasing the selectivity of cancer chemotherapeutic agents is presented in which noncytotoxic competitive substrates are used to discern the differences in structural requirements for transport of cytotoxic agents between tumor cells and a sensitive host tissue, the hematopoietic precursor cells of the bone marrow. Examples are given for two such systems, one responsible for the transport of nucleosides and another for the transport of amino acids. Cytidine is twice as effective in reducing the toxicity of showdomycin for murine bone marrow cells in culture as it is for murine L1210 leukemia cella. Conversely, homoleucine is twice as effective in reducing the toxicity of melphalan for L1210 cells as it is for bone marrow cells. These observations can serve as a basis for the development of bone marrow protective agents and for the design of cytotoxic agents that may be preferentially transported into tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W1513975248,"The specific inhibitory effect of colchicine upon protein secretion by lacrimal glands could be related to the formation of a complex between colchicine and tubulin from the soluble fraction of the gland. By gel electrophoresis under nondissociating conditions, it is shown that this complex is similar to the colchicine . tubulin complex from brain. The complex isolated from lacrimal glands is highly inhibitory upon brain tubulin assembly since as low as 0.07 microM complex impedes the polymerization of 8 microM tubulin by 50%, compared to 3 microM for free colchicine. Therefore, a small percentage of complexed tubulin (0.9%) is enough for polymerization to be blocked. In lacrimal glands the complex might prevent the polymerization of tubulin, and colchicine shift the tubulin in equilibrium microtubules equilibrium to microtubules disassembly. The disorganization of the labile microtubular system could lead to a modification of the transport of the secretory granules and to a perturbation of secretion."

This alternating voltage indicates the following response of the brain to the flicker. If every other flash in the flicker is displaced temporally by as little as 30 microseconds, an asymmetry appears in the brain's alternating voltage. The results suggest an underlying mechanism that may enhance visual detection of high-frequency flicker."
