https://openalex.org/W2020445250,"The human ovary contains a fixed number of non-growing follicles (NGFs) established before birth that decline with increasing age culminating in the menopause at 50-51 years. The objective of this study is to model the age-related population of NGFs in the human ovary from conception to menopause. Data were taken from eight separate quantitative histological studies (n = 325) in which NGF populations at known ages from seven weeks post conception to 51 years (median 32 years) were calculated. The data set was fitted to 20 peak function models, with the results ranked by obtained r2 correlation coefficient. The highest ranked model was chosen. Our model matches the log-adjusted NGF population from conception to menopause to a five-parameter asymmetric double Gaussian cumulative (ADC) curve (r2 = 0.81). When restricted to ages up to 25 years, the ADC curve has r2 = 0.95. We estimate that for 95% of women by the age of 30 years only 12% of their maximum pre-birth NGF population is present and by the age of 40 years only 3% remains. Furthermore, we found that the rate of NGF recruitment towards maturation for most women increases from birth until approximately age 14 years then decreases towards the menopause. To our knowledge, this is the first model of ovarian reserve from conception to menopause. This model allows us to estimate the number of NGFs present in the ovary at any given age, suggests that 81% of the variance in NGF populations is due to age alone, and shows for the first time, to our knowledge, that the rate of NGF recruitment increases from birth to age 14 years then declines with age until menopause. An increased understanding of the dynamics of human ovarian reserve will provide a more scientfic basis for fertility counselling for both healthy women and those who have survived gonadotoxic cancer treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2155369095,"Change is a fundamental ingredient of interaction patterns in biology, technology, the economy, and science itself: Interactions within and between organisms change; transportation patterns by air, land, and sea all change; the global financial flow changes; and the frontiers of scientific research change. Networks and clustering methods have become important tools to comprehend instances of these large-scale structures, but without methods to distinguish between real trends and noisy data, these approaches are not useful for studying how networks change. Only if we can assign significance to the partitioning of single networks can we distinguish meaningful structural changes from random fluctuations. Here we show that bootstrap resampling accompanied by significance clustering provides a solution to this problem. To connect changing structures with the changing function of networks, we highlight and summarize the significant structural changes with alluvial diagrams and realize de Solla Price's vision of mapping change in science: studying the citation pattern between about 7000 scientific journals over the past decade, we find that neuroscience has transformed from an interdisciplinary specialty to a mature and stand-alone discipline."
https://openalex.org/W2035817205,"As in human disease, macrophages (MØ) are central players in the development and progression of experimental atherosclerosis. In this study we have evaluated the phenotype of MØ associated with progression of atherosclerosis in the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) knockout (KO) mouse model.We found that bone marrow-derived MØ submitted to M1 and M2 polarization specifically expressed arginase (Arg) II and Arg I, respectively. This distinct arginase expression was used to evaluate the frequency and distribution of M1 and M2 MØ in cross-sections of atherosclerotic plaques of ApoE KO mice. Early lesions were infiltrated by Arg I(+) (M2) MØ. This type of MØ favored the proliferation of smooth muscle cells, in vitro. Arg II(+) (M1) MØ appeared and prevailed in lesions of aged ApoE KO mice and lesion progression was correlated with the dominance of M1 over the M2 MØ phenotype. In order to address whether the M2->M1 switch could be due to a phenotypic switch of the infiltrated cells, we performed in vitro repolarization experiments. We found that fully polarized MØ retained their plasticity since they could revert their phenotype. The analysis of the distribution of Arg I- and Arg II-expressing MØ also argued against a recent recruitment of M1 MØ in the lesion. The combined data therefore suggest that the M2->M1 switch observed in vivo is due to a conversion of cells already present in the lesion. Our study suggests that interventional tools able to revert the MØ infiltrate towards the M2 phenotype may exert an atheroprotective action."
https://openalex.org/W2086180957,"The tumor suppressor p53 is regulated by numerous post-translational modifications. Lysine methylation has recently emerged as a key post-translational modification that alters the activity of p53. Here, we describe a novel lysine methylation site in p53 that is carried out by two homologous histone methyltransferases, G9a and Glp. G9a and Glp specifically methylate p53 at Lys373, resulting mainly in dimethylation. During DNA damage, the overall level of p53 modified at Lys373me2 does not increase, despite the dramatic increase in total p53, indicating that Lys373me2 correlates with inactive p53. Further, reduction of G9a and/or Glp levels leads to a larger population of apoptotic cells. Examination of the Oncomine data base shows that G9a and Glp are overexpressed in various cancers compared with corresponding normal tissues, suggesting that they are putative oncogenes. These data reveal a new methylation site within p53 mediated by the methylases G9a and Glp and indicate that G9a is a potential inhibitory target for cancer treatment.

G9a and Glp methylate lysine 373 in the tumor suppressor p53.Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 285Issue 23PreviewVOLUME 285 (2010) PAGES 9636–9641 Full-Text PDF Open Access The tumor suppressor p53 is a sequence-specific transcription factor. The transcription activity is critical for its tumor suppressive function; indeed, more than half of human tumors bear a mutation in the p53 gene, largely within the DNA binding domain (1.Bode A.M. Dong Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). Many mechanisms regulate transcriptional activation by p53, including nuclear localization, DNA binding, post-translational modifications (PTMs), 2The abbreviations used are: PTMpost-translational modificationGlpG9a-like proteinsiRNAsmall interfering RNAGSTglutathione S-transferaseLSD1lysine specific demethylase 1. and co-factor recruitment. These regulatory pathways are interdependent; for example, p53 acetylation promotes both its ability to bind to DNA and its recruitment of cofactors (2.Prives C. Manley J.L. Cell. 2001; 107: 815-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Among all of these regulatory steps during the activation of p53, PTMs have attracted extensive attention because of their complex roles in tumorigenesis and possible clinical applications. post-translational modification G9a-like protein small interfering RNA glutathione S-transferase lysine specific demethylase 1. Lysine methylation is a relatively stable protein PTM relative to acetylation; and similar to acetylation, lysine methylation regulates diverse substrates (3.Huang J. Berger S.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2008; 18: 152-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Regulatory potential is greatly increased because multiple methyl groups can be added to a single lysine residue, leading to mono-, di-, or trimethylation of a substrate protein. Indeed, within histone substrates, these various levels of methylation localize to different chromosomal regions and correlate with distinct biological outcomes. For example, histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3Lys9me3) generally localizes in the heterochromatic regions, whereas mono- and dimethylation (H3Lys9me1 and H3Lys9me2) localize within euchromatin (4.Schotta G. Lachner M. Sarma Lys. Ebert A. Sengupta R. Reuter G. Reinberg D. Jenuwein T. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Recently, lysine methylation has been shown to regulate the activity of p53 (3.Huang J. Berger S.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2008; 18: 152-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Multiple lysines on p53 are methylated (Lys370, Lys372, and Lys382) by the methyl transferases Smyd2, Set7/9, and PR-Set7 (also known as Set8), respectively, which were previously characterized as histone methylases (5.Huang J. Perez-Burgos L. Placek B.J. Sengupta R. Richter M. Dorsey J.A. Lysubicek S. Opravil S. Jenuwein T. Berger S.L. Nature. 2006; 444: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 6.Chuikov S.

However, Lys370 and Lys382 dimethylation (Lys370me2 and Lys382me2) have both been detected on p53, but the cognate enzymes to these methylation sites remain unknown (8.Lysachirskaia I. Shi X.

Interestingly, similar to histones, the variable levels of p53 methylation result in different biological outcomes. For example, Lys370me1 is associated with repression of p53 function, whereas Lys370me2 is associated with p53 activation. In addition, Lys382me1 antagonizes Lys382 acetylation (Lys382ac), whereas Lys382me2 is linked to p53 response to DNA damage (7.Shi X. Lysachirskaia I. Yamaguchi H. West L.E. Wen H. Wang E.W. Dutta S.

Further, as has also been observed for histone modifications, the PTMs of p53 cross-talk between one another, which greatly increases the potential complexity of p53 regulation by modification. For example, Lys372me1 suppresses Lys370me1, and Lys382me1 blocks Lys382ac (5.Huang J. Perez-Burgos L. Placek B.J. Sengupta R. Richter M. Dorsey J.A. Lysubicek S. Opravil S. Jenuwein T. Berger S.L.

Gene knockouts of G9a or Glp in the mouse result in embryonic lethality (10.Tachibana M. Sugimoto Lys. Nozaki M. Ueda J. Ohta T. Ohki M. Fukuda M. Takeda N. Niida H. Lysato H. Shinkai Y.

Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 815-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), suggesting that G9a and Glp are critical during mammalian development. However, little is known about the pathophysiological roles of G9a and Glp in oncogenesis. Here, we investigate p53 methylation mediated by G9a and Glp. Our results indicate that there is a potential role for G9a and Glp in human cancers and link p53 methylation site to tumorigenesis. Peptides were synthesized as described previously (5.Huang J. Perez-Burgos L. Placek B.J. Sengupta R. Richter M. Dorsey J.A. Lysubicek S. Opravil S. Jenuwein T. Berger S.L. Nature. 2006; 444: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 9.Huang J.

The amino acid numbering refers to the human p53 protein sequence, unless otherwise indicated. The p53Lys373me2 antibody was generated in rabbits using a peptide corresponding to the CSHLKSKK(me2)GQST sequence from p53. Crude rabbit antiserum was used in Western blot analysis at a dilution of 1:500 or 1:1,000. Full-length human G9a (amino acids 1–1211) and Glp (amino acids 1-1299) were cloned into a baculovirus vector pFastBac-HTA-FLAG. pFastBac-HTA-FLAG was generated by adding a FLAG tag into vector pFastBac-HTA (Invitrogen). Baculoviruses containing cDNA of G9a or Glp were used to infect insect Sf9 cells, as described previously (5.Huang J. Perez-Burgos L. Placek B.J. Sengupta R. Richter M. Dorsey J.A. Lysubicek S.

Bedford M.T. Jenuwein T. Berger S.L. Nature. 2007; 449: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged G9a and Glp were purified from Sf9 extracts using anti-FLAG M2 antibody conjugated to agarose beads. Colloidal staining was used to confirm the purity of the proteins. Methylation assays were performed as described previously (5.Huang J. Perez-Burgos L. Placek B.J. Sengupta R. Richter M. Dorsey J.A. Lysubicek S. Opravil S. Jenuwein T. Berger S.L.

Briefly, 1 μg of peptide, 2 μg of histone H3 or GST-p53 were used as a substrate, and 1 μg of recombinant G9a or Glp was used as enzyme to perform the methylation assay. The total volume was 20 μl, and reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Half of the reaction was used for colloidal staining and the other for fluorography. Transient transfection assays were performed using Lipofectamine 2000, as described previously (5.Huang J. Perez-Burgos L. Placek B.J. Sengupta R. Richter M. Dorsey J.A. Lysubicek S. Opravil S.

The next day, cells were transfected with 100 nm luciferase siRNA (control), G9a siRNA1, siRNA2, Glp siRNA1 or siRNA2 using Dharmafect 1 (Dharmacon) twice in succession, with a 1-day interval between transfections. For transfections containing G9a_si1, G9a_si2, Glp_si1, and Glp_si2, a 25 nm concentration of each siRNA was mixed to a total concentration of 100 nm. 24 h after the second transfection, cells were either untreated or treated with 0.5 μm adriamycin for 36 h followed by flow cytometry analysis. Cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate) and 1 × protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and 25 μg of cleared supernatant was electrophoresed using NUPAGE gels (Invitrogen). Flow cytometry was performed as described previously (5.Huang J. Perez-Burgos L. Placek B.J. Sengupta R. Richter M. Dorsey J.A. Lysubicek S. Opravil S. Jenuwein T. Berger S.L.

Briefly, cells were fixed with 70% ethanol overnight at −20 °C, treated with RNase A for 1 h at room temperature, and stained with 100 μg/ml propidium iodide for 10 min before analysis using a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson). The use of the data base is described previously (12.Rhodes D.R. Yu J. Shanker Lys. Deshpande N. Varambally R. Ghosh D. Barrette T. Pandey A. Chinnaiyan A.M. Neoplasia. 2004; 6: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data sets with differential expression of G9a or Glp between normal and cancer tissues (p < 0.001) were selected. Several methylation sites in p53 (Lys370me, Lys372me, and Lys382me) were identified previously (Fig. 1A) (5.Huang J. Perez-Burgos L. Placek B.J. Sengupta R. Richter M. Dorsey J.A. Lysubicek S.

Dutta S. Appella E. Gozani O. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 636-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). During our search for methylases that modify p53 in vitro (5.Huang J. Perez-Burgos L. Placek B.J. Sengupta R. Richter M. Dorsey J.A. Lysubicek S. Opravil S. Jenuwein T. Berger S.L. Nature. 2006; 444: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), two additional histone methylases, G9a and Glp, modified p53. Both enzymes methylated a p53 peptide encompassing the C terminus from 361 to 381, but not a p53 peptide encompassing 374–391 (Fig. 1B). In addition, controls confirmed that G9a and Glp methylated histone H3 peptides, H3 (1–20) and H3 (19–38), consistent with previous observations that these enzymes methylate histone H3 at lysine 9 and lysine 27 (11.Tachibana M. Ueda J. Fukuda M. Takeda N. Ohta T. Iwanari H. Sakihama T. Lysodama T. Hamakubo T. Shinkai Y. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 815-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Notably, methylation of the p53 peptide is comparable in efficiency with the methylation of the two histone peptides (Fig. 1B). Further mapping showed that both G9a and Glp methylate p53 at Lys373 because a 361–381 peptide that was substituted from lysine to arginine at 373 (K373R) was not methylated, whereas a K372R peptide was methylated. The methylases G9a and Glp are homologous proteins, and both contain a SET domain and ankyrin repeats (Fig. 1C). Recently, ankyrin repeats in G9a have been shown to bind to histone H3 lysine 9 (H3Lys9me2), the same modification that is carried out by G9a and Glp. To investigate whether Lys373 is the only methylation site in p53 that is catalyzed by G9a and Glp, we prepared full-length G9a and Glp from Sf9 cells infected with baculovirus expressing these enzymes. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged full-length human p53 and p53 (K373R) were generated in bacteria as substrates. We performed in vitro methylation assays using these reagents, along with histone H3 as a positive control (Fig. 2). The enzymes automethylate in the in vitro assay as was detected in the bovine serum albumin negative control reactions (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 7) compared with the reaction without enzyme (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 9). GST-p53 was efficiently methylated by either enzyme; indeed, the methylation of p53 (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and 10) was comparable with the methylation of the positive control, histone H3 (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 8). Further, Lys373 appears to be the only methylation site targeted by either G9a and Glp in vitro because GST-p53 (K373R) was not methylated by either enzyme (Fig. 2, lanes 6 and 12). As mentioned above, the status of methylation can correlate with different biological outcomes. For example, in p53, Lys370me1 is linked to repression of p53 activity, whereas Lys370me2 is linked to p53 activation (5.Huang J. Perez-Burgos L. Placek B.J. Sengupta R. Richter M. Dorsey J.A. Lysubicek S. Opravil S. Jenuwein T. Berger S.L. Nature. 2006; 444: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 9.Huang J. Sengupta R. Espejo A.B. Lee M.G. Dorsey J.A. Richter M. Opravil S. Shiekhattar R. Bedford M.T. Jenuwein T. Berger S.L. Nature. 2007; 449: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Methylation of p53 at Lys382 also results in different functional consequences, in that Lys382me1 represses p53 activity, whereas Lys282me2 is involved in the DNA damage response mediated by p53 (7.Shi X. Lysachirskaia I. Yamaguchi H. West L.E. Wen H. Wang E.W. Dutta S. Appella E. Gozani O. Mol.

Chem. 2008; 283: 34660-34666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For this reason, we investigated the methylation status of p53Lys373 by G9a and Glp. We performed in vitro methylation reactions using p53 peptide (363–381) as substrate, either unmodified (Lys373me0) or chemically monomethylated (Lys373me1) or dimethylated (Lys373me2) (Fig. 3). Both G9a and Glp methylated p53Lys373me0 and Lys373me1, and Glp weakly methylated Lys373me2. These results suggest that G9a and Glp mainly dimethylate and possibly monomethylate p53 at Lys373. Similarly, G9a and Glp mainly dimethylate the histone H3 Lys9 (10.Tachibana M. Sugimoto Lys. Nozaki M. Ueda J. Ohta T. Ohki M. Fukuda M. Takeda N. Niida H. Lysato H. Shinkai Y. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1779-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar, 11.Tachibana M. Ueda J. Fukuda M. Takeda N. Ohta T. Iwanari H. Sakihama T. Lysodama T. Hamakubo T. Shinkai Y. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 815-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). To investigate the roles of G9a and Glp-mediated dimethylation of p53 at Lys373 in cells, we generated a rabbit polyclonal antibody using a p53 peptide dimethylated at Lys373 (Lys373me2). Dot-blot analysis showed that this antibody (p53Lys373me2) recognized the p53 peptide p53Lys373me2 with a much higher affinity than other p53 methylation sites (supplemental Fig. S1). In addition, the p53Lys373me2 antibody specifically recognized p53 methylation carried out by recombinant G9a by not by Set9, a Lys372me1 methylase (6.Chuikov S. Lysurash J. Lys. Wilson J.R. Xiao B. Justin N. Ivanov G.S. McLysinney Lys. Tempst P. Prives C. Gamblin S.J. Barlev N.A. Reinberg D. Nature. 2004; 432: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). We then used this antibody to examine whether G9a and Glp can specifically methylate p53Lys373 in cells. For this purpose, vectors containing FLAG-tagged p53 or p53 (K373R) cDNA were co-transfected with FLAG-tagged G9a or Glp into 293T cells (Fig. 4B). FLAG-p53 was immunoprecipitated using FLAG resin and eluted using FLAG peptides, followed by Western blotting using the Lys373me2-specific antibody. We observed a strong Lys373me2 signal when the p53 expression vector was co-transfected with G9a or Glp expression vector compared with empty vector (Fig. 4B, left side). Importantly, there was no Lys373me2 signal when p53 (K373R) vector was used (Fig. 4B, right side). PR-Set7 (Set8), a methylase that monomethylates p53 at Lys382 (7.Shi X. Lysachirskaia I.

Cell. 2007; 27: 636-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), did not methylate p53 at Lys373. These data demonstrate that p53 is dimethylated by G9a and Glp in cells. To assess the p53Lys373me2 endogenously, MCF7 cells were treated with adriamycin, a DNA-damaging agent, for 8 h. MCF7 cells express wild-type p53 and thus can be used to examine endogenous p53 signaling upon DNA damage. A p53 mouse monoclonal antibody, DO1, was used to immunoprecipitate total p53 followed by Western blotting with rabbit polyclonal antibody, FL393, and with the p53Lys373me2 antibody. After an 8-h adriamycin treatment, the level of total p53 was greatly induced (Fig. 4C, upper left). Surprisingly, the Lys373me2 levels remained essentially unchanged (Fig. 4C, lower left), suggesting that Lys373me2 occurs on inactive p53 and not on activated p53. Consistent with the signal occurring on inactive p53, we also detected the Lys373me2 signal on p53 in 293T cells (Fig. 4C, right), in which endogenous p53 is inactivated by a virus protein, SV40 large T antigen. To demonstrate clearly the specificity of p53Lys373me2 antibody in cells, we performed the reverse immunoprecipitation in MCF7 and H1299 cell lysates with p53Lys373me2 antibody or rabbit IgG followed by Western blot analysis with DO1 antibody (Fig. 4D). H1299 is a p53-null lung cancer cell line that we used as a negative control. We detected p53Lys373me2 signal only in MCF7 cells with immunoprecipitation using p53Lys373me2 antibody, but not immunoprecipitation with IgG. Additionally, we did not detect p53Lys373me2 in H1299 cell lysate. These data show that G9a and Glp dimethylate p53 at Lys373 in cells. Because Lys373me2 may be linked to the repressed state of p53, we hypothesized that Lys373me2 by G9a and Glp may help to maintain p53 in an inactive form. This hypothesis suggests that reduction of G9a and Glp levels will result in hyperactivation of p53. To test this prediction, we utilized siRNAs that target luciferase (control), G9a, and/or Glp in MCF7 cells (Fig. 5A and supplemental Fig. S2). Two siRNAs for G9a (G9a_si1 and si2) and two siRNAs for Glp (Glp_si1 and si2) were used to reduce enzyme levels and to control for “off-target” effects. After a 48-h siRNA treatment, MCF7 cells were subjected to adriamycin treatment for 36 h (reduction of RNA and protein shown in supplemental Fig. S2 and Fig. 5A, respectively), followed by flow cytometry and analysis of DNA content. In most cases, knockdown of G9a and/or Glp dramatically increased the sub-G1 (apoptotic) population (Fig. 5B), and where the difference was not significant (i.e. G9a_si2), the siRNA treatment was not as effective. It is noteworthy that the increase in the sub-G1 population correlated with a decrease in the p53Lys373me2 signal (Fig. 5A). This inverse correlation strongly suggests that knockdown of G9a and/or Glp releases p53 from repression mediated by Lys373me2 and leads to an increase in the proportion of apoptotic cells. Interestingly, the combination of G9a and Glp siRNA knockdown did not further increase the percentage of apoptotic population, indicating that G9a and Glp are not playing redundant roles in this process. This observation is reminiscent of the H3Lys9 dimethylation by G9a and Glp, in which disruption of either G9a or Glp dramatically decreases H3Lys9me2 signal. Therefore, G9a and Glp are playing cooperative roles rather than simply redundant roles, which is consistent with previous observations that these two proteins exist in a complex and affect the activity of each other (11.Tachibana M. Ueda J. Fukuda M. Takeda N. Ohta T. Iwanari H. Sakihama T. Lysodama T. Hamakubo T. Shinkai Y. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 815-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Taken together, the data suggest that G9a and Glp repress apoptosis, consistent with the hypothesis that p53Lys373me2 is negatively regulating p53. Because G9a- and Glp-mediated Lys373me2 appears to repress p53 activity, the enzymes are potential oncogenes and, if overexpressed, could suppress p53 activity leading to cancer. To test this possibility, we investigated the expression levels of G9a and Glp in nine different types of cancers and their corresponding normal tissues, using the public gene expression data set in the Oncomine data base (12.Rhodes D.R. Yu J. Shanker Lys. Deshpande N. Varambally R. Ghosh D. Barrette T. Pandey A. Chinnaiyan A.M. Neoplasia. 2004; 6: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strikingly, G9a was up-regulated in all nine cancer types compared with the normal tissues (Fig. 6A). Glp is also overexpressed in brain tumors, multiple myeloma, and head and neck cancers (Fig. 6B). Of note, these data sets result from nine independent studies for G9a and three studies for Glp. Therefore, these data strongly suggest that overexpression of G9a and/or Glp promotes tumor cell growth. The tumor suppressor p53 is heavily decorated with a variety of PTMs, which are centrally involved in regulation of p53 activity (1.Bode A.M. Dong Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). Most of these modification sites reside within the N-terminal transactivation and C-terminal regulatory domains. However, these two regions contain many fewer inactivating mutations occurring in human cancer compared with the central DNA binding domain (1.Bode A.M. Dong Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar); this relationship leads to provocative questions about the role and overall importance of these modifications in p53 biology (13.Toledo F. Wahl G.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 909-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). In particular, regarding lysine modifications, mouse genetic models expressing p53 with seven (p537KR: lysines 367, 369, 370, 378, 379, 383, and 384 in mouse) or six (p536KR: lysines 367, 369, 370, 378, 379, and 383 in mouse) lysine-to-arginine mutations at its C terminus display only minor effects in either tumorigenesis or the DNA damage response (13.Toledo F. Wahl G.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 909-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 14.Lysrummel Lys. A. Lee C.J. Toledo F. Wahl G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 10188-10193Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 15.Feng L. Lin T. Uranishi H. Gu W. Xu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5389-5395Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Lys373 (Lys370 in mouse), the site described in this study, is one of these lysine sites. One simple explanation for the modest defects and low incidence of mutations found at these modification sites is that redundancies exist between the sites. For example, p300/CBP acetylates p53 at numerous lysines (120, 164, 370, 372, 373, 381, 382, and 386 in human). p53 with substitutions at individual lysine residues behaves similarly to wild-type p53. However, substitution of all eight substrate lysines to arginine (8KR) leads to a strong defect in p53 activity (16.Tang Y. Zhao W. Chen Y. Zhao Y. Gu W. Cell. 2008; 133: 612-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). This result also potentially explains the observations that p537KR and p536KR mice are normal (14.Lysrummel Lys. A. Lee C.J. Toledo F. Wahl G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 10188-10193Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 15.Feng L. Lin T. Uranishi H. Gu W. Xu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5389-5395Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to acetylation, all identified p53 methylases are site-specific, i.e. each of Smyd2, Set7/9, PR-Set7 (Set8), G9a, and Glp methylates a single site on p53. Therefore, the lack of mutation(s) in these lysine sites cannot simply be explained by redundancies among these sites. Thus, a key question is whether these sites regulate p53 activity in growth and cancer pathways. One explanation is that the methylases engage in cross-talk, to cooperate or antagonize each other's activity. Indeed, positive-acting Lys372me1 by Set7/9 inhibits negative-acting Lys370me1 mediated by Smyd2 (5.Huang J. Perez-Burgos L. Placek B.J. Sengupta R. Richter M. Dorsey J.A. Lysubicek S. Opravil S. Jenuwein T. Berger S.L. Nature. 2006; 444: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). This coordination between sites and enzymes could lead to altered p53 activity beyond the effect of altering a single modification site. Another explanation is that the same lysine residue could be positively (acetylation) or negatively (methylation) modified. Therefore, mutation from lysine to arginine not only blocks positive modification, acetylation, but also prevents negative modifications such as methylation. The ultimate outcome of lysine-to-arginine mutation is the combinatorial effect of the loss of these positive and negative modifications. Compared with acetylation, which seems to act only positively to up-regulate p53 activity, a subset of the methylation sites behaves negatively, to maintain p53 in an inactive state. These negatively acting sites include Lys370me1, Lys382me1, and, in this current study based on increased apoptosis in the reduced enzyme conditions, Lys373me2. Hence, these methylations are all potentially oncogenic because high levels of the enzymes, leading to constitutive methylation, would lead to underactive p53. Relevant to this issue is the fact, mentioned above, that the p53 gene is mutated in only half of human tumors. It remains unclear how tumor formation escapes p53-mediated surveillance mechanisms in the other half of cancers apparently lacking p53 gene mutations. Our results and observations from other studies suggest that inappropriate levels of PTMs, due to overexpression of the cognate enzymes, may contribute to the inactivation of p53. One example is LSD1, a histone and p53 demethylase, which is overexpressed in neuroblastoma (17.Schulte J.H. Lim S. Schramm A. Friedrichs N. Lysoster J. Versteeg R. Ora I. Pajtler Lys. Lyslein-Hitpass L. Lysuhfittig-Lysulle S. Metzger E. Schüle R. Eggert A. Buettner R. Lysirfel J. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 2065-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) and is associated with the relapse of prostate cancer (18.Lysahl P. Gullotti L. Heukamp L.C. Wolf S. Friedrichs N. Vorreuther R. Solleder G. Bastian P.J. Ellinger J. Metzger E. Schüle R. Buettner R. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 11341-11347Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Our previous findings show that LSD1 removes a positive-acting p53 methylation at Lys372me2 (9.Huang J. Sengupta R. Espejo A.B. Lee M.G. Dorsey J.A. Richter M. Opravil S. Shiekhattar R. Bedford M.T. Jenuwein T. Berger S.L. Nature. 2007; 449: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), thus, high levels of LSD1 could be oncogenic because of constitutive repression of p53. In a similar vein, our current observations indicate that p53Lys373me2 is negative acting and that the cognate methylases G9a and Glp are up-regulated in many types of cancers. These findings, both for LSD1 removing an activating methylation and for G9a/Glp adding a repressing methylation, strongly suggest that enzymes that negatively regulate p53 activity can act as oncogenes when expressed at aberrantly high levels. These results suggest that new therapies are possible via inhibition of these enzymes, which in turn would restore the activity of p53. This concept is particularly intriguing in tumor/cancers that bear a wild-type p53 gene. Future efforts will be needed to address the precise roles of p53 lysine modifications in tumor pathways.

https://openalex.org/W2113991648,"TopBP1 has important roles in both DNA replication and checkpoint regulation in vertebrates. We have identified a protein called Treslin that associates with TopBP1 in Xenopus egg extracts. Depletion of Treslin from egg extracts strongly inhibits chromosomal DNA replication. Binding of Treslin to chromatin in egg extracts occurs independently of TopBP1. However, loading of the initiator protein Cdc45 onto chromatin cannot take place in the absence of Treslin. Prior to the initiation of DNA replication, Treslin associates with TopBP1 in a Cdk2-dependent manner. Ablation of Treslin from human cells also strongly inhibits DNA replication. Taken together, these results indicate that Treslin and TopBP1 collaborate in the Cdk2-mediated loading of Cdc45 onto replication origins. Thus, Treslin regulates a pivotal step in the initiation of DNA replication in vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2000767839,"Tumor immunosuppression is commonly braided with chronic inflammation during tumor development. However, the relationship between immunosuppression and inflammation in tumor microenvironment is still unclear. We have demonstrated that mast cells are accumulated and exacerbate the inflammation and immunosuppression in tumor microenvironment via SCF/c-kit signaling pathway. Here, we further elucidate the underlying mechanism, which involves both myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T (Treg) cells. Our data showed that mast cells mobilized the infiltration of MDSCs to tumor and induced the production of IL-17 by MDSCs; MDSCs-derived IL-17 indirectly attracted Treg cells, enhanced their suppressor function, and induced the IL-9 production by Treg cells; in turn, IL-9 strengthened the survival and protumor effect of mast cells in tumor microenvironment. Our findings disclose a closed loop among mast cells, MDSCs and Treg cells in tumor microenvironment, which provides a new insight into the paralleled developments of inflammation and immunosuppression in tumor microenvironment. Based on these findings, we propose that targeting tumor inflammation might be a potential strategy to reverse the immunosuppression of tumor microenvironment, thus facilitating cancer immunotherapy."

In addition, it is the site of action of antidepressants (which block the transporter) and of amphetamines (which induce substrate efflux). We explored the functional importance of the N terminus in mediating the action of amphetamines by focusing initially on the highly conserved threonine residue at position 81, a candidate site for phosphorylation by protein kinase C. Molecular dynamics simulations of the wild type SERT, compared with its mutations SERTT81A and SERTT81D, suggested structural changes in the inner vestibule indicative of an opening of the inner vestibule. Predictions from this model (e.g. the preferential accumulation of SERTT81A in the inward conformation, its reduced turnover number, and a larger distance between its N and C termini) were verified. Most importantly, SERTT81A (and the homologous mutations in noradrenaline and dopamine) failed to support amphetamine-induced efflux, and this was not remedied by aspartate at this position. Amphetamine-induced currents through SERTT81A were comparable with those through the wild type transporter. Both abundant Na+ entry and accumulation of SERTT81A in the inward facing conformation ought to favor amphetamine-induced efflux. Thus, we surmised that the N terminus must play a direct role in driving the transporter into a state that supports amphetamine-induced efflux. This hypothesis was verified by truncating the first 64 amino acids and by tethering the N terminus to an additional transmembrane helix. Either modification abolished amphetamine-induced efflux.

Clark J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 249-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The monoamine transporters belong to the neurotransmitter:sodium symporter family (2.Saier Jr., M.H. Tran C.V. Barabote R.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D181-D186Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). The structure of their hydrophobic core is well understood, and educated guesses can be made based on several crystal structures that have been solved for the bacterial homolog LeuTAa (3.Singh S.K. Channels. 2008; 2: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) as follows: the hydrophobic core is comprised of 12 transmembrane-spanning segments (TM) that are arranged in two pseudo-symmetrical helical repeats of TM1–TM5 and TM6–TM10, whereas TM11 and TM12 are thought to represent the dimer interface. Movements within the inverted repeats can readily account for a conformational cycle predicted by the alternating access model (4.Jardetzky O. Nature. 1966; 211: 969-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar) as follows: substrate and co-transported ion enter via an outer vestibule created by the outward facing conformation; upon binding to the substrate-binding site, access from the outer vestibule is occluded. Subsequently, the substrate and co-transported ions are released into the interior of the cell when the transporter adopts the inward facing conformation (that is pseudo-symmetrical to the outward facing conformation). LeuTAa only has short extensions at the N and C termini (5.Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). Hence, the structures of the N and C termini of monoamine transporters cannot be inferred from LeuTAa. The intracellular termini, however, are important and have been implicated in two functionally important areas as follows: (i) in transporter trafficking (6.Torres G.E. Carneiro A. Seamans K.

This may regulate the availability of transporters at the cell surface, because phosphorylated transporters are thought to be subject to dynamin-dependent internalization (14.Daniels G.M. Amara S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35794-35801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). This interpretation has been questioned; elimination of all consensus phosphorylation sites by mutagenesis both in SERT and in DAT did not lead to any appreciable deficit in internalization (16.Granas C.

In addition, transporter phosphorylation is thought to be relevant for the action of amphetamine and its congeners; amphetamines elicit virtually all their biological actions by inducing reverse transport, i.e. by switching monoamine transporters into a mode where the transporters mediate the efflux of dopamine (DAT), norepinephrine (NET), and SERT; inhibition of protein kinases or their genetic ablation blunt the ability of amphetamines to induce reverse transport (13.Fog J.U.

Several conceptual problems arise if amphetamine-induced reverse transport is treated as a special situation within the framework of the alternating access model (20.Sitte H.H. Freissmuth M. J. Neurochem. 2010; 112: 340-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Most importantly, in the current context it is not clear how phosphorylation of the N terminus can be translated into a shift in the transport cycle that promotes outward rather than inward movement of substrate. Here, we addressed the role of the N terminus by three approaches: (i) disruption of a consensus PKC phosphorylation (78XRXT81) site in the juxtamembrane region of the SERT N terminus; (ii) truncation of the N terminus (while preserving the putative phosphorylation site); and (iii) constraining the mobility of the N terminus by tethering it to an additional transmembrane segment. The observations are consistent with a model in which the N-terminal segment must be freely mobile to regulate the conformational cycle of the transporter and transmit the actions of amphetamines.

Chemicals at analytical grade were obtained from standard suppliers with the exception of ibogaine, which was donated by Marko Resinovic (Slovenia). Cell culture media, supplements, and antibiotics were from Invitrogen. Mutageneses were performed with the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit with cDNA of human isoforms of NET, DAT, or SERT as template (cloned into the pECFP and pEYFP vectors (Clontech) or into the pOTV oocyte vector) and Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) to produce mutant cDNAs that code for fluorescence protein-tagged transporters (for the sake of brevity, CFP and YFP as prefix or suffix C and Y will only be used in an abbreviated form for fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy); all transporters were fluorescently tagged, except the transporters expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and the TACSERT construct. Sense and antisense custom oligonucleotides were designed to contain the mutations of interest.

The T81A mutant in the double fluorescence-tagged C-SERT-Y background, used in intramolecular FRET measurements, was created by site-directed mutagenesis as described above. The N-terminal truncation mutant SERT-YFP with the first 64 amino acids removed, therefore termed Δ64SERT, was produced by PCR using the primers (5′ to 3′ direction) GCGCGGTACCGTCACAGCATTCAAGCGG (reverse, KpnI site) and GCGCGAATTCGATGGCGACCACC (forward, EcoRI site). A FLAG sequence (DYKDDDDK) was inserted into the single membrane-spanning interleukin 2α receptor subunit, Tac (T-cell activation), sequence downstream of the N-terminal signal sequence (22.Waldmann T.A.

The signal sequence affords the use of the M1 FLAG antibody (Sigma), because M1 only binds FLAG epitopes positioned at the extreme N terminus (23.Einhauer A. Jungbauer A. J. Biochem. Biophys.

The FLAG-tagged Tac fragment was subsequently fused to the N terminus of human SERT using PCR, and the TACSERT was inserted into the expression vector pcDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen). All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. HEK293 and CAD cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere, on standard plastic cultureware, as desired. HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% kanamycin. CAD cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (1:1) medium, supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. All experiments were also carried out in HEK293 cells and showed similar results to those obtained in CAD cells (data not shown). Cells were seeded onto poly-d-lysine-coated 48-well culture plates (for uptake assays) and 13- or 16-mm glass coverslips (for confocal and FRET microscopy, respectively) or 5-mm glass coverslips (for release studies). For most experiments, the cells were transiently transfected with wild type or mutant plasmid cDNA (2–20 μg) using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method. The experiments were carried out 48 h following the transfection. TACSERT was transiently transfected in HEK293 cells (number CRL-1573, ATCC) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium with Glutamax-I supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 mm sodium pyruvate, and penicillin/streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen); 4 μg of plasmid encoding TACSERT or wild type SERT was used for transient transfection of cells in a 75-cm2 culture flask. Cells were assayed 48–72 h after transfection. For uptake and binding saturation experiments, carried out to measure transporter turnover, stable HEK293 lines were created using Geneticin (G418) for selection of positive clones, as indicated in the respective figure legends. Fluorescence tags do not introduce any functional deficit to monoamine transporters (24.Schmid J.A. Scholze P. Kudlacek O. Freissmuth M. Singer E.A. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3805-3810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Uptake experiments were performed as described previously (25.Hilber B. Scholze P. Dorostkar M.M. Sandtner W. Holy M. Boehm S. Singer E.A. Sitte H.H. Neuropharmacology. 2005; 49: 811-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In brief, for the determination of nonspecific uptake by SERT, DAT, and NET, we used 10 μm paroxetine, mazindole, or nisoxetine, respectively, and 0.1–60 μm [3H]dopamine or [3H]5HT was added for 1 min as indicated. For TacSERT, transfected cells were plated in 96-well plates (ViewPlate; PerkinElmer Life Science). Prior to the experiment, the cells were washed once in uptake buffer (25 mm HEPES, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, and 1.2 mm MgSO4 supplemented with 5 mm d-glucose, 0.1 mm ascorbic acid, and 0.1 mm pargyline) and equilibrated in uptake buffer for 30 min before starting the assay. Nonlabeled 5HT was added at increasing concentrations followed by 30–50 nm [3H]5HT to a final volume of 150 μl. After incubation for 3 min at room temperature, cells were washed twice in ice-cold uptake buffer. Scintillation fluid (0.15 ml) was added, and the radioactivity was measured in a Wallac microplate liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Substrate efflux assays were performed as described previously (26.Sitte H.H. Hiptmair B. Zwach J. Pifl C. Singer E.A. Scholze P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 27.Scholze P. N⊘rregaard L. Singer E.A. Freissmuth M. Gether U. Sitte H.H. J. Biol.

In brief, culture medium was removed from transiently transfected CAD or HEK293 cells (4·105 cells per well grown on coverslips in 96-well plates), and the cells were preincubated with 0.4 μm [3H]5HT or with 0.1 μm 1-[3H]methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) for 20 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 0.1 ml of Krebs/HEPES buffer per well. The coverslips were transferred into chambers, and excess radioactivity was subsequently washed out with buffer at 25 °C for 45 min at a perfusion rate of 0.7 ml/min. Once stable efflux of radioactivity was achieved, following the initial wash, 2-min fractions were collected, and samples were counted in a β-counter. Membranes were prepared from HEK293 cells transfected with wild type or mutant transporters. The cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH adjusted to 7.4), harvested, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. The pellets were dissolved in HME buffer (20 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, pH adjusted to 7.4), centrifuged, and freeze-thawed twice using liquid nitrogen. Following another centrifugation step, the pellets were redissolved in HME buffer and sonicated three times for 7 s with 5-s intervals. The membranes were incubated with [3H]CFT for DAT or [3H]imipramine for SERT in reactions of 0.1 to 0.25 ml, respectively, in the presence or absence of other drugs in the desired concentration range. The buffer contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 120 mm NaCl, and 3 mm KCl. For experiments involving DAT, ZnCl2 was added to the buffer at a final concentration of 10 μm. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm methylphenidate or paroxetine (for DAT and SERT assays, respectively). The reactions, lasting between 0.5 and 60 min, were terminated by rapid washing with ice-cold buffer and collected onto glass fiber filters (Whatman GF/B) that were dissolved in scintillation medium and counted for [3H] content. The cDNA of the wild type SERT and various SERT mutants were cloned into the oocyte expression vector pOTV. The plasmids were linearized and in vitro transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase using the mMessage mMachine T7 RNA kit (Ambion). The resulting cRNA was injected into defolliculated, stage VI X. laevis oocytes (25 ng/oocyte; X. laevis frogs were from Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI). Electrophysiological recordings were obtained after incubation of the injected oocytes for 5–9 days at 18 °C in standard oocyte solution (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.6 with NaOH). Whole cell currents and voltages were recorded from oocytes by the two-electrode voltage clamp and the current clamp method as described previously (28.Meinild A.K. Sitte H.H. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49671-49679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) using the CA-1B high performance oocyte clamp (Dagan Corp.), interfaced to an IBM-compatible PC and pCLAMP 9.2 (Axon Instruments), to control membrane potentials and other parameters. Electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries to a resistance of 0.2–1 megohm and filled with 3 m KCl. For experiments, the oocyte was impaled with two electrodes in a chamber continuously perfused with buffer (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH) until a stable base-line current was obtained. Currents were subjected to low pass-filtering at 20 Hz. During voltage clamp the membrane potential was held at the indicated voltage (Vhold) and the applied current (I) was recorded. In the current clamp mode, the membrane potential was monitored and the voltage recorded. For efflux measurements, injected X. laevis oocytes were incubated with 0.4 μm [3H]5HT at 18 °C for 10 min. They were then washed three times in cold buffer and transferred to the experimental chamber. The oocytes were superfused first with ND100 for 5 min (to guarantee a constant basal efflux) and during the experiment either with PCA or serotonin, along with the addition of ND100. All experiments were carried out at room temperature with a superfusion rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions were collected in scintillation vials and counted for radioactivity. At the end of the experiment, the remaining radioactivity was recovered by dissolving the oocyte with 10% SDS. Drug-induced release of radioactivity was calculated as percentage of radioactivity present in the cell at any given time point. Confocal microscopy was done essentially as published (29.Korkhov V.M. Holy M. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13439-13448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (argon laser, 30 milliwatts; helium/neon laser, 1 milliwatt) equipped with an oil immersion objective (Zeiss Plan-NeoFluar ×40/1.3). The expression of transporters was quantified by calculating the ratios of plasma membrane intensity to cellular interior intensity, using the method described by Wuller et al. (30.Wüller S. Wiesner B. Löffler A. Furkert J. Krause G. Hermosilla R. Schaefer M. Schülein R. Rosenthal W. Oksche A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47254-47263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). For immunocytochemistry, transiently transfected HEK293 cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline) for 30 min. Subsequently, cells were incubated with mouse anti-FLAG M1 primary antibody diluted 1:1000 for 1 h in blocking buffer. Following five washes in blocking buffer, secondary Alexa488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Invitrogen) diluted 1:200 was applied for another 45 min before the cells were washed twice in blocking buffer, twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and mounted using Vectashield (Vectashield Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Coverslips were sealed with nail polish. All steps were performed at room temperature. Confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss 510 confocal laser scanning microscope using a 63× 1.4 NA oil immersion objective. Alexa488 was excited with the 488 nm laser line from an argon-krypton laser, and the fluorescent signal was collected with a 505–550-nm bandpass filter. X. laevis oocytes were transferred into an experimental chamber (1μ-slide 18-well ibiTreat, Ibidi, Germany) for confocal microscopy experiments to determine SERT expression levels, by visualizing the binding of the Rhodamine-labeled 2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)tropane, JHC1-64 (21.Cha J.H. Zou M.F. Adkins E.M. Rasmussen S.G. Loland C.J. Schoenenberger B. Gether U. Newman A.H. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 7513-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The compound was added in a cumulative manner (30 nm to 2 μm), and fluorescence elicited by the helium/neon laser at 542 nm (intensity: 100%; 560–615 nm broad pass filter) was recorded over 200 s in 10-s intervals. FRET microscopy was carried out on an epifluorescence Zeiss Axiovert M200 microscope using the “three filter method” as described previously (31.Bartholomäus I. Milan-Lobo L. Nicke A. Dutertre S. Hastrup H. Jha A. Gether U. Sitte H.H. Betz H. Eulenburg V. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10978-10991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cells were transiently transfected (2 × 105 cells/22-mm coverslip) and placed into a chamber containing buffer. The images were taken using a 63× oil immersion objective and Ludl filter wheels to allow for rapid switching between the fluorescence excitation and emission filters for CFP (ICFP; excitation, 436 nm; emission, 480 nm; and dichroic mirror, 455 nm), YFP (IYFP; excitation, 500 nm; emission, 535 nm; and dichroic mirror, 515 nm), and FRET (IFRET; excitation, 436 nm; emission, 535 nm; and dichroic mirror, 455 nm). The images were captured by a CCD camera and analyzed using Metamorph (Meta Imaging, Universal Imaging Corp., version 4.6). Background fluorescence was subtracted from all images, and fluorescence intensity was measured at the plasma membrane and in cytosolic regions in all images. To calculate a normalized FRET signal (NFRET), we used Equation 1, NFRET=IFRET−a×IYFP−b×ICFPIYFP×ICFP(Eq. 1) where a and b represent the bleed through values for YFP and CFP. The conformational changes in the wild type protein compared with the T81A and T81D mutants were investigated by a series of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using a three-dimensional homology model of SERT based on the crystal structure of the leucine transporter from Aquifex aeolicus (LeuTAa), Protein Data Bank code 2A65 (5.Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar), with its natural substrate 5HT bound. The underlying alignment was chosen from the comprehensive study published by Beuming et al. (32.Beuming T. Shi L. Javitch J.A. Weinstein H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 1630-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and generation of the homology model and subsequent docking of 5HT were performed with the software package MOE (Molecular Operating Environment, version 2007.09). Two Na+ ions were positioned into the binding site equivalently to those in LeuTAa, and one Cl− ion was placed on the basis of the description of its coordinating residues (33.Forrest L.R. Tavoulari S. Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. Honig B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 12761-12766Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). It is worth pointing out that the model is truncated at both C- and N-terminal ends (C terminus, 23 residues; N terminus, 78 residues are missing) because there is no corresponding sequence in the LeuTAa template within those regions; it should be noted explicitly that the mutated Thr81 is only three amino acid side chains away from the N-terminal truncation point. Thus, MD simulations performed have to be interpreted cautiously as this missing fragment might influence the simulation; furthermore, it should be noted that the MD simulations have not been performed down to the millisecond time frame that would be necessary to compute the actual conformational changes on a biological time scale. MD simulations were performed with the software package DESMOND (Desmond Molecular Dynamics System, version 2.0, D. E. Shaw Research, New York), and the resulting trajectories were analyzed using DESMOND and VMD (34.Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (39009) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional model of wild type SERT with bound 5HT was placed into a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-l-phosphatidylcholine membrane and solvated into an orthorhombic box filled with water. Na+ and Cl− ions were added (excluding the region within a radius of 7 Å around 5HT) to provide a final salt concentration of 0.15 m. The OPLS all-atom force field was used throughout. Constant temperature (310 K) and pressure (1 atm) were achieved by using the Berendsen algorithm. The whole system, consisting of about 55,000 atoms, underwent several short energy"
https://openalex.org/W1988123382,"Background Mytilus species are important in marine ecology and in environmental quality assessment, yet their molecular biology is poorly understood. Molecular aspects of their reproduction, hybridisation between species, mitochondrial inheritance, skewed sex ratios of offspring and adaptation to climatic and pollution factors are priority areas. Methodology/Principal Findings To start to address this situation, expressed genetic transcripts from M. galloprovincialis were pyrosequenced. Transcripts were isolated from the digestive gland, foot, gill and mantle of both male and female mussels. In total, 175,547 sequences were obtained and for foot and mantle, 90% of the sequences could be assembled into contiguous fragments but this reduced to 75% for the digestive gland and gill. Transcripts relating to protein metabolism and respiration dominated including ribosomal proteins, cytochrome oxidases and NADH dehydrogenase subunits. Tissue specific variation was identified in transcripts associated with mitochondrial energy metabolism, with the digestive gland and gill having the greatest transcript abundance. Using fragment recruitment it was also possible to identify sites of potential small RNAs involved in mitochondrial transcriptional regulation. Sex ratios based on Vitelline Envelop Receptor for Lysin and Vitelline Coat Lysin transcript abundances, indicated that an equal sex distribution was maintained. Taxonomic profiling of the M. galloprovincialis tissues highlighted an abundant microbial flora associated with the digestive gland. Profiling of the tissues for genes involved in intermediary metabolism demonstrated that the gill and digestive gland were more similar to each other than to the other two tissues, and specifically the foot transcriptome was most dissimilar. Conclusions Pyrosequencing has provided extensive genomic information for M. galloprovincialis and generated novel observations on expression of different tissues, mitochondria and associated microorganisms. It will also facilitate the much needed production of an oligonucleotide microarray for the organism."
https://openalex.org/W2009380617,"Methods available for quickly and objectively quantifying the behavioral phenotypes of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, lag behind in sophistication the tools developed for manipulating their genotypes. We have developed a simple, easy-to-replicate, general-purpose experimental chamber for studying the ground-based behaviors of fruit flies. The major innovative feature of our design is that it restricts flies to a shallow volume of space, forcing all behavioral interactions to take place within a monolayer of individuals. The design lessens the frequency that flies occlude or obscure each other, limits the variability in their appearance, and promotes a greater number of flies to move throughout the center of the chamber, thereby increasing the frequency of their interactions. The new chamber design improves the quality of data collected by digital video and was conceived and designed to complement automated machine vision methodologies for studying behavior. Novel and improved methodologies for better quantifying the complex behavioral phenotypes of Drosophila will facilitate studies related to human disease and fundamental questions of behavioral neuroscience."
https://openalex.org/W2041378376,"A potential strategy for diagnosing lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer-related death, is to identify metabolic signatures (biomarkers) of the disease. Although data supports the hypothesis that volatile compounds can be detected in the breath of lung cancer patients by the sense of smell or through bioanalytical techniques, analysis of breath samples is cumbersome and technically challenging, thus limiting its applicability. The hypothesis explored here is that variations in small molecular weight volatile organic compounds (“odorants”) in urine could be used as biomarkers for lung cancer. To demonstrate the presence and chemical structures of volatile biomarkers, we studied mouse olfactory-guided behavior and metabolomics of volatile constituents of urine. Sensor mice could be trained to discriminate between odors of mice with and without experimental tumors demonstrating that volatile odorants are sufficient to identify tumor-bearing mice. Consistent with this result, chemical analyses of urinary volatiles demonstrated that the amounts of several compounds were dramatically different between tumor and control mice. Using principal component analysis and supervised machine-learning, we accurately discriminated between tumor and control groups, a result that was cross validated with novel test groups. Although there were shared differences between experimental and control animals in the two tumor models, we also found chemical differences between these models, demonstrating tumor-based specificity. The success of these studies provides a novel proof-of-principle demonstration of lung tumor diagnosis through urinary volatile odorants. This work should provide an impetus for similar searches for volatile diagnostic biomarkers in the urine of human lung cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2022825562,"In recent years, extended altruism towards unrelated group members has been proposed to be a unique characteristic of human societies. Support for this proposal seemingly came from experimental studies on captive chimpanzees that showed that individuals were limited in the ways they shared or cooperated with others. This dichotomy between humans and chimpanzees was proposed to indicate an important difference between the two species, and one study concluded that “chimpanzees are indifferent to the welfare of unrelated group members”. In strong contrast with these captive studies, consistent observations of potentially altruistic behaviors in different populations of wild chimpanzees have been reported in such different domains as food sharing, regular use of coalitions, cooperative hunting and border patrolling. This begs the question of what socio-ecological factors favor the evolution of altruism. Here we report 18 cases of adoption, a highly costly behavior, of orphaned youngsters by group members in Taï forest chimpanzees. Half of the adoptions were done by males and remarkably only one of these proved to be the father. Such adoptions by adults can last for years and thus imply extensive care towards the orphans. These observations reveal that, under the appropriate socio-ecologic conditions, chimpanzees do care for the welfare of other unrelated group members and that altruism is more extensive in wild populations than was suggested by captive studies."
https://openalex.org/W2016529502,"In response to DNA double strand breaks, the histone variant H2AX at the break site is phosphorylated at serine 139 by DNA damage sensor kinases such as ataxia telangiectasia-mutated, forming gamma-H2AX. This phosphorylation event is critical for sustained recruitment of other proteins to repair the break. After repair, restoration of the cell to a prestress state is associated with gamma-H2AX dephosphorylation and dissolution of gamma-H2AX-associated damage foci. The phosphatases PP2A and PP4 have previously been shown to dephosphorylate gamma-H2AX. Here, we demonstrate that the wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (WIP1) also dephosphorylates gamma-H2AX at serine 139 in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of WIP1 reduces formation of gamma-H2AX foci in response to ionizing and ultraviolet radiation and blocks recruitment of MDC1 (mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1) and 53BP1 (p53 binding protein 1) to DNA damage foci. Finally, these inhibitory effects of WIP1 on gamma-H2AX are accompanied by WIP1 suppression of DNA double strand break repair. Thus, WIP1 has a homeostatic role in reversing the effects of ataxia telangiectasia-mutated phosphorylation of H2AX."
https://openalex.org/W2102341623,"Background Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF-MS) allows the identification of most bacteria and an increasing number of fungi. The potential for the highest clinical benefit of such methods would be in severe acute infections that require prompt treatment adapted to the infecting species. Our objective was to determine whether yeasts could be identified directly from a positive blood culture, avoiding the 1–3 days subculture step currently required before any therapeutic adjustments can be made. Methodology/Principal Findings Using human blood spiked with Candida albicans to simulate blood cultures, we optimized protocols to obtain MALDI TOF-MS fingerprints where signals from blood proteins are reduced. Simulated cultures elaborated using a set of 12 strains belonging to 6 different species were then tested. Quantifiable spectral differences in the 5000–7400 Da mass range allowed to discriminate between these species and to build a reference database. The validation of the method and the statistical approach to spectral analysis were conducted using individual simulated blood cultures of 36 additional strains (six for each species). Correct identification of the species of these strains was obtained. Conclusions/Significance Direct MALDI TOF-MS analysis of aliquots from positive blood cultures allowed rapid and accurate identification of the main Candida species, thus obviating the need for sub-culturing on specific media. Subsequent to this proof-of-principle demonstration, the method can be extended to other clinically relevant yeast species, and applied to an adequate number of clinical samples in order to establish its potential to improve antimicrobial management of patients with fungemia."
https://openalex.org/W2035783531,"Decision often implies a utilitarian choice based on personal gain, even at the expense of damaging others. Despite the social implications of utilitarian behavior, its neurophysiological bases remain largely unknown. To assess how the human brain controls utilitarian behavior, we delivered transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the ventral prefrontal cortex (VPC) and over the occipital cortex (OC) in 78 healthy subjects. Utilitarian judgment was assessed with the moral judgment task before and after tDCS. At baseline, females provided fewer utilitarian answers than males for personal moral dilemmas (p = .007). In males, VPC-tDCS failed to induce changes and in both genders OC-tDCS left utilitarian judgments unchanged. In females, cathodal VPC-tDCS tended to decrease whereas anodal VPC-tDCS significantly increased utilitarian responses (p = .005). In males and females, reaction times for utilitarian responses significantly decreased after cathodal (p<.001) but not after anodal (p = .735) VPC-tDCS. We conclude that ventral prefrontal tDCS interferes with utilitarian decisions, influencing the evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of each option in both sexes, but does so more strongly in females. Whereas cathodal tDCS alters the time for utilitarian reasoning in both sexes, anodal stimulation interferes more incisively in women, modifying utilitarian reasoning and the possible consequent actions. The gender-related tDCS-induced changes suggest that the VPC differentially controls utilitarian reasoning in females and in males. The gender-specific functional organization of the brain areas involved in utilitarian behavior could be a correlate of the moral and social behavioral differences between the two sexes."
https://openalex.org/W2080569825,"Background Salmonella pathogenesis engages host cells in two-way biochemical interactions: phagocytosis of bacteria by recruitment of cellular small GTP-binding proteins induced by the bacteria, and by triggering a pro-inflammatory response through activation of MAPKs and nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Worldwide interest in the use of functional foods containing probiotic bacteria for health promotion and disease prevention has increased significantly. Saccharomyces boulardii is a non-pathogenic yeast used as a probiotic in infectious diarrhea. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we reported that S. boulardii (Sb) protected mice from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (ST)-induced death and prevented bacterial translocation to the liver. At a molecular level, using T84 human colorectal cancer cells, we demonstrate that incubation with Sb before infection totally abolished Salmonella invasion. This correlates with a decrease of activation of Rac1. Sb preserved T84 barrier function and decreased ST-induced IL-8 synthesis. This anti-inflammatory effect was correlated with an inhibitory effect of Sb on ST-induced activation of the MAPKs ERK1/2, p38 and JNK as well as on activation of NF-κB. Electron and confocal microscopy experiments showed an adhesion of bacteria to yeast cells, which could represent one of the mechanisms by which Sb exerts its protective effects. Conclusions Sb shows modulating effects on permeability, inflammation, and signal transduction pathway in T84 cells infected by ST and an in vivo protective effect against ST infection. The present results also demonstrate that Sb modifies invasive properties of Salmonella."
https://openalex.org/W2087122633,"In vivo phosphorylation sites of the tobacco calcium-dependent protein kinases NtCDPK2 and NtCDPK3 were determined in response to biotic or abiotic stress. Stress-inducible phosphorylation was exclusively located in the variable N termini, where both kinases were phosphorylated differentially despite 91% overall sequence identity. In NtCDPK2, serine 40 and threonine 65 were phosphorylated within 2 min after stress. Whereas Thr65 is subjected to intra-molecular in vivo autophosphorylation, Ser40 represents a target for a regulatory upstream protein kinase, and correct NtCDPK2 membrane localization is required for Ser40 phosphorylation. NtCDPK3 is phosphorylated at least at two sites in the N terminus by upstream kinase(s) upon stress stimulus, first at Ser54, a site not present in NtCDPK2, and also at a second undetermined site not identical to Ser40. Domain swap experiments established that differential phosphorylation of both kinases is exclusively determined by the respective N termini. A cell death-inducing response was only observed upon expression of a truncated variant lacking the junction and calcium-binding domain of NtCDPK2 (VK2). This response required protein kinase activity and was reduced when subcellular membrane localization was disturbed by a mutation in the myristoylation and palmitoylation site.

https://openalex.org/W2065721819,"Background Neandertals and the Middle Paleolithic persisted in the Iberian Peninsula south of the Ebro drainage system for several millennia beyond their assimilation/replacement elsewhere in Europe. As only modern humans are associated with the later stages of the Aurignacian, the duration of this persistence pattern can be assessed via the dating of diagnostic occurrences of such stages. Methodology/Principal Findings Using AMS radiocarbon and advanced pretreatment techniques, we dated a set of stratigraphically associated faunal samples from an Aurignacian III–IV context excavated at the Portuguese cave site of Pego do Diabo. Our results establish a secure terminus ante quem of ca.34,500 calendar years ago for the assimilation/replacement process in westernmost Eurasia. Combined with the chronology of the regional Late Mousterian and with less precise dating evidence for the Aurignacian II, they place the denouement of that process in the 37th millennium before present. Conclusions/Significance These findings have implications for the understanding of the emergence of anatomical modernity in the Old World as a whole, support explanations of the archaic features of the Lagar Velho child's anatomy that invoke evolutionarily significant Neandertal/modern admixture at the time of contact, and counter suggestions that Neandertals could have survived in southwest Iberia until as late as the Last Glacial Maximum."
https://openalex.org/W2078315494,"Learning, or more generally, plasticity may be studied using cultured networks of rat cortical neurons on multi electrode arrays. Several protocols have been proposed to affect connectivity in such networks. One of these protocols, proposed by Shahaf and Marom, aimed to train the input-output relationship of a selected connection in a network using slow electrical stimuli. Although the results were quite promising, the experiments appeared difficult to repeat and the training protocol did not serve as a basis for wider investigation yet. Here, we repeated their protocol, and compared our ‘learning curves’ to the original results. Although in some experiments the protocol did not seem to work, we found that on average, the protocol showed a significantly improved stimulus response indeed. Furthermore, the protocol always induced functional connectivity changes that were much larger than changes that occurred after a comparable period of random or no stimulation. Finally, our data shows that stimulation at a fixed electrode induces functional connectivity changes of similar magnitude as stimulation through randomly varied sites; both larger than spontaneous connectivity fluctuations. We concluded that slow electrical stimulation always induced functional connectivity changes, although uncontrolled. The magnitude of change increased when we applied the adaptive (closed-loop) training protocol. We hypothesize that networks develop an equilibrium between connectivity and activity. Induced connectivity changes depend on the combination of applied stimulus and initial connectivity. Plain stimuli may drive networks to the nearest equilibrium that accommodates this input, whereas adaptive stimulation may direct the space for exploration and force networks to a new balance, at a larger distance from the initial state."
https://openalex.org/W1994051007,"We show that <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i> has an enzyme catalyzing transfer of maltose from [<sup>14</sup>C]maltose 1-phosphate to glycogen. This enzyme was purified 90-fold from crude extracts and characterized. Maltose transfer required addition of an acceptor. Liver, oyster, or mycobacterial glycogens were the best acceptors, whereas amylopectin had good activity, but amylose was a poor acceptor. Maltosaccharides inhibited the transfer of maltose from [<sup>14</sup>C]maltose-1-P to glycogen because they were also acceptors of maltose, and they caused production of larger sized radioactive maltosaccharides. When maltotetraose was the acceptor, over 90% of the <sup>14</sup>C-labeled product was maltohexaose, and no radioactivity was in maltopentaose, demonstrating that maltose was transferred intact. Stoichiometry showed that 0.89 μmol of inorganic phosphate was produced for each micromole of maltose transferred to glycogen, and 56% of the added maltose-1-P was transferred to glycogen. This enzyme has been named α1,4-glucan:maltose-1-P maltosyltransferase (GMPMT). Transfer of maltose to glycogen was inhibited by micromolar amounts of inorganic phosphate or arsenate but was only slightly inhibited by millimolar concentrations of glucose-1-P, glucose-6-P, or inorganic pyrophosphate. GMPMT was compared with glycogen phosphorylase (GP). GMPMT catalyzed transfer of [<sup>14</sup>C]maltose-1-P, but not [<sup>14</sup>C]glucose-1-P, to glycogen, whereas GP transferred radioactivity from glucose-1-P but not maltose-1-P. GMPMT and GP were both inhibited by 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-d-arabinitol, but only GP was inhibited by isofagomine. Because mycobacteria that contain trehalose synthase accumulate large amounts of glycogen when grown in high concentrations of trehalose, we propose that trehalose synthase, maltokinase, and GMPMT represent a new pathway of glycogen synthesis using trehalose as the source of glucose."
https://openalex.org/W2014626769,"Emerging evidence indicates a link between inflammation and cancer metastasis, but the molecular mechanism(s) remains unclear. Uteroglobin (UG), a potent anti-inflammatory protein, is constitutively expressed in the lungs of virtually all mammals. UG-knock-out (UG-KO) mice, which are susceptible to pulmonary inflammation, and B16F10 melanoma cells, which preferentially metastasize to the lungs, provide the components of a model system to determine how inflammation and metastasis are linked. We report here that B16F10 cells, injected into the tail vein of UG-KO mice, form markedly elevated numbers of tumor colonies in the lungs compared with their wild type littermates. Remarkably, UG-KO mouse lungs overexpress two calcium-binding proteins, S100A8 and S100A9, whereas B16F10 cells express the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), which is a known receptor for these proteins. Moreover, S100A8 and S100A9 are potent chemoattractants for RAGE-expressing B16F10 cells, and pretreatment of these cells with a blocking antibody to RAGE suppressed migration and invasion. Interestingly, in UG-KO mice S100A8/S100A9 concentrations in blood are lowest in tail vein and highest in the lungs, which most likely guide B16F10 cells to migrate to the lungs. Further, B16F10 cells treated with S100A8 or S100A9 overexpress matrix metalloproteinases, which are known to promote tumor invasion. Most notably, the metastasized B16F10 cells in UG-KO mouse lungs express MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-14 as well as furin, a pro-protein convertase that activates MMPs. Taken together, our results suggest that a lack of an anti-inflammatory protein leads to increased pulmonary colonization of melanoma cells and identify RAGE as a potential anti-metastatic drug target."

https://openalex.org/W2058321420,"Background Glutamine is one of the primary amino acids in nitrogen assimilation and often the most abundant amino acid in plant roots. To monitor this important metabolite, a novel genetically encoded fluorescent FRET-reporter was constructed and expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana. As a candidate for the glutamine fluxes, the root tip localized, putative amino acid transporter CAT8 was analyzed and heterologously expressed in yeast and oocytes. Principal Findings Rapid and reversible in vivo fluorescence changes were observed in reporter-expressing root tips upon exposure and removal of glutamine. FRET changes were detected at acid and neutral pH and in the presence of a protonophore, suggesting that part of the glutamine fluxes were independent of the pH. The putative amino acid transporter CAT8 transported glutamine, had a half maximal activity at ∼100 µM and the transport was independent of external pH. CAT8 localized not only to the plasma membrane, but additionally to the tonoplast, when tagged with GFP. Ultrastructural analysis confirmed this dual localization and additionally identified CAT8 in membranes of autophagosomes. Loss-of function of CAT8 did not affect growth in various conditions, but over-expressor plants had increased sensitivity to a structural substrate analog, the glutamine synthetase inhibitor L-methionine sulfoximine. Conclusions The combined data suggest that proton-independent glutamine facilitators exist in root tips."
https://openalex.org/W2072947945,"Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) typically masculinizes male behavior, while low levels of ERalpha in the medial amygdala (MeA) and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) are associated with high levels of male prosocial behavior. In the males of the highly social prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster), increasing ERalpha in the MeA inhibited the expression of spontaneous alloparental behavior and produced a preference for novel females. To test for the effects of increased ERalpha in the BST, a viral vector was used to enhance ERalpha expression in the BST of adult male prairie voles. Following treatment, adult males were tested for alloparental behavior with 1-3-day-old pups, and for heterosexual social preference and affiliation. Treatment did not affect alloparental behavior as 73% of ERalpha-BST males and 62.5% of control males were alloparental. Increasing ERalpha in the BST affected heterosexual affiliation, with ERalpha-BST males spending significantly less total time in side-by-side contact with females relative to time spent with control males. ERalpha-BST males did not show a preference for either the familiar or novel female. These findings differed significantly from those reported in ERalpha-MeA enhanced males, where ERalpha inhibited alloparental behavior and produced a preference for a novel female. The findings from this study suggest two things: first, that increased ERalpha in the BST decreases social affiliation and second, that altering ERalpha in different regions of the social neural circuit differentially impacts the expression of social behavior."

In response to genotoxic agents, cells overexpressing MYC undergo apoptosis. However, the MYC-regulated effectors acting upstream of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway are still unknown.In this study, we demonstrate that expression of Myc is required to activate the Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-dependent DNA damage checkpoint responses in rat cell lines exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) or the bacterial cytolethal distending toxin (CDT). Phosphorylation of the ATM kinase and its downstream effectors, such as histone H2AX, were impaired in the myc null cell line HO15.19, compared to the myc positive TGR-1 and HOmyc3 cells. Nuclear foci formation of the Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (Nbs) 1 protein, essential for efficient ATM activation, was also reduced in absence of myc. Knock down of the endogenous levels of MYC by siRNA in the human cell line HCT116 resulted in decreased ATM and CHK2 phosphorylation in response to irradiation. Conversely, cell death induced by UV irradiation, known to activate the ATR-dependent checkpoint, was similar in all the cell lines, independently of the myc status.These data demonstrate that MYC contributes to the activation of the ATM-dependent checkpoint responses, leading to cell death in response to specific genotoxic stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1985412807,"Setting Under India's Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP), >15% of previously-treated patients in the reported 2006 patient cohort defaulted from anti-tuberculosis treatment. Objective To assess the timing, characteristics, and risk factors for default amongst re-treatment TB patients. Methodology For this case-control study, in 90 randomly-selected programme units treatment records were abstracted from all 2006 defaulters from the RNTCP re-treatment regimen (cases), with one consecutively-selected non-defaulter per case. Patients who interrupted anti-tuberculosis treatment for >2 months were classified as defaulters. Results 1,141 defaulters and 1,189 non-defaulters were included. The median duration of treatment prior to default was 81 days (25%–75% interquartile range 44–117 days) and documented retrieval efforts after treatment interruption were inadequate. Defaulters were more likely to have been male (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2–1.7), have previously defaulted anti-tuberculosis treatment (aOR 1.3 95%CI 1.1–1.6], have previous treatment from non-RNTCP providers (AOR 1.3, 95%CI 1.0–1.6], or have public health facility-based treatment observation (aOR 1.3, 95%CI 1.1–1.6). Conclusions Amongst the large number of re-treatment patients in India, default occurs early and often. Improved pre-treatment counseling and community-based treatment provision may reduce default rates. Efforts to retrieve treatment interrupters prior to default require strengthening."
https://openalex.org/W2054480260,"Glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) is highly abundant in the brain. Various biochemical analyses have indicated that GSK3beta is localized to different intracellular compartments within brain cells. However, ultrastructural visualization of this kinase in various brain regions and in different brain cell types has not been reported. The goal of the present study was to examine GSK3beta distribution and subcellular localization in the brain using immunohistochemistry combined with light and electron microscopy. Initial examination by light microscopy revealed that GSK3beta is expressed in brain neurons and their dendrites throughout all the rostrocaudal extent of the adult mouse brain, and abundant GSK3beta staining was found in the cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, the cerebellum, and some brainstem nuclei. Examination by transmission electron microscopy revealed highly specific subcellular localization of GSK3beta in neurons and astrocytes. At the subcellular level, GSK3beta was present in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, free ribosomes, and mitochondria of neurons and astrocytes. In addition GSK3beta was also present in dendrites and dendritic spines, with some postsynaptic densities clearly labeled for GSK3beta. Phosphorylation at serine-9 of GSK3beta (pSer9GSK3beta) reduces kinase activity. pSer9GSK3beta labeling was present in all brain regions, but the pattern of staining was clearly different, with an abundance of labeling in microglia cells in all regions analyzed and much less neuronal staining in the subcortical regions. At the subcellular level pSer9GSK3beta labeling was located in the endoplasmic reticulum, free ribosomes and in some of the nuclei. Overall, in normal brains constitutively active GSK3beta is predominantly present in neurons while pSer9GSK3beta is more evident in resting microglia cells. This visual assessment of GSK3beta localization within the subcellular structures of various brain cells may help in understanding the diverse role of GSK3beta signaling in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2058898080,"Background We have previously developed an oncolytic serotype 5 adenovirus (Ad5) with chromogranin-A (CgA) promoter-controlled E1A expression, Ad[CgA-E1A], with the intention to treat neuroendocrine tumors, including carcinoids. Since carcinoids tend to metastasize to the liver it is important to fully repress viral replication in hepatocytes to avoid adenovirus-related liver toxicity. Herein, we explore miRNA-based regulation of E1A expression as a complementary mechanism to promoter-based transcriptional control. Methodology/Principal Findings Ad[CgA-E1A-miR122], where E1A expression is further controlled by six tandem repeats of the target sequence for the liver-specific miR122, was constructed and compared to Ad[CgA-E1A]. We observed E1A suppression and replication arrest of the miR122-detargeted adenovirus in normal hepatocytes, while the two viruses killed carcinoid cells to the same degree. Repeated intravenous injections of Ad[CgA-E1A] induced liver toxicity in mice while Ad[CgA-E1A-miR122] injections did not. Furthermore, a miR122-detargeted adenovirus with the wild-type E1A promoter showed reduced replication in hepatic cells compared to wild-type Ad5 but not to the same extent as the miR122-detargeted adenovirus with the neuroendocrine-selective CgA promoter. Conclusions/Significance A combination of transcriptional (promoter) and post-transcriptional (miRNA target) regulation to control virus replication may allow for the use of higher doses of adenovirus for efficient tumors treatment without liver toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2011815185,"We previously reported that the – 2518 MCP-1 genotype GG increases the likelihood of developing tuberculosis (TB) in non-BCG-vaccinated Mexicans and Koreans. Here, we tested the hypothesis that this genotype, alone or together with the – 1607 MMP-1 functional polymorphism, increases the likelihood of developing TB in BCG-vaccinated individuals. We conducted population-based case-control studies of BCG-vaccinated individuals in Mexico and Peru that included 193 TB cases and 243 healthy tuberculin-positive controls from Mexico and 701 TB cases and 796 controls from Peru. We also performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of lymph nodes from carriers of relevant two-locus genotypes and in vitro studies to determine how these variants may operate to increase the risk of developing active disease. We report that a joint effect between the – 2518 MCP-1 genotype GG and the – 1607 MMP-1 genotype 2G/2G consistently increases the odds of developing TB 3.59-fold in Mexicans and 3.9-fold in Peruvians. IHC analysis of lymph nodes indicated that carriers of the two-locus genotype MCP-1 GG MMP-1 2G/2G express the highest levels of both MCP-1 and MMP-1. Carriers of these susceptibility genotypes might be at increased risk of developing TB because they produce high levels of MCP-1, which enhances the induction of MMP-1 production by M. tuberculosis-sonicate antigens to higher levels than in carriers of the other two-locus MCP-1 MMP-1 genotypes studied. This notion was supported by in vitro experiments and luciferase based promoter activity assay. MMP-1 may destabilize granuloma formation and promote tissue damage and disease progression early in the infection. Our findings may foster the development of new and personalized therapeutic approaches targeting MCP-1 and/or MMP-1."

In spite of the emerging role of the endogenous cannabinoid (eCB) system in these behaviors, little is known about the anatomy and function of this system in the anterolateral BNST (alBNST). The aim of this study was to provide a detailed morphological characterization of the localization of the cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptor a necessary step toward a better understanding of the physiological roles of the eCB system in this region of the brain.We have combined anatomical approaches at the confocal and electron microscopy level to ex-vivo electrophysiological techniques. Here, we report that CB1 is localized on presynaptic membranes of about 55% of immunopositive synaptic terminals for the vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGluT1), which contain abundant spherical, clear synaptic vesicles and make asymmetrical synapses with alBNST neurons. About 64% of vGluT1 immunonegative synaptic terminals show CB1 immunolabeling. Furthermore, 30% and 35% of presynaptic boutons localize CB1 in alBNST of conditional mutant mice lacking CB1 mainly from GABAergic neurons (GABA-CB1-KO mice) and mainly from cortical glutamatergic neurons (Glu-CB1-KO mice), respectively. Extracellular field recordings and whole cell patch clamp in the alBNST rat brain slice preparation revealed that activation of CB1 strongly inhibits excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission.This study supports the anterolateral BNST as a potential neuronal substrate of the effects of cannabinoids on stress-related behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W1982093962,"There are pronounced socioeconomic disparities in coronary heart disease, but the extent to which these primarily reflect gradients in underlying coronary artery disease severity or in the clinical manifestation of advanced disease is uncertain. We measured the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) as indexed by grade of employment and coronary artery calcification (CAC) in the Whitehall II epidemiological cohort, and tested the contribution of lifestyle, biological and psychosocial factors in accounting for this association.CAC was assessed in 528 asymptomatic men and women aged 53-76 years, stratified into higher, intermediate and lower by grade of employment groups. Lifestyle (smoking, body mass index, alcohol consumption, physical activity), biological (blood pressure, lipids, fasting glucose, inflammatory markers) and psychosocial factors (work stress, financial strain, social support, depression, hostility, optimism) were also measured. Detectable CAC was present in 293 participants (55.5%). The presence of calcification was related to lifestyle and biological risk factors, but not to grade of employment. But among individuals with detectable calcification, the severity of CAC was inversely associated with grade of employment (p = 0.010), and this relationship remained after controlling for demographic, lifestyle, biological and psychosocial factors. Compared with the higher grade group, there was a mean increase in log Agatston scores of 0.783 (95% C.I. 0.265-1.302, p = 0.003) in the intermediate and 0.941 (C.I. 0.226-1.657, p = 0.010) in the lower grade of employment groups, after adjustment for demographic, lifestyle, biological and psychosocial factors.Low grade of employment did not predict the presence of calcification in this cohort, but was related to the severity of CAC. These findings suggest that lower SES may be particularly relevant at advanced stages of subclinical coronary artery disease, when calcification has developed."
https://openalex.org/W2009113474,"Although monkeypox virus (MPXV) studies in wild rodents and non-human primates have generated important knowledge regarding MPXV pathogenesis and inferences about disease transmission, it might be easier to dissect the importance of virulence factors and correlates of protection to MPXV in an inbred mouse model. Herein, we compared the two clades of MPXV via two routes of infection in the BALB/c and C57BL/6 inbred mice strains. Our studies show that similar to previous animal studies, the Congo Basin strain of MPXV was more virulent than West African MPXV in both mouse strains as evidenced by clinical signs. Although animals did not develop lesions as seen in human MPX infections, localized signs were apparent with the foot pad route of inoculation, primarily in the form of edema at the site of inoculation; while the Congo Basin intranasal route of infection led to generalized symptoms, primarily weight loss. We have determined that future studies with MPXV and laboratory mice would be very beneficial in understanding the pathogenesis of MPXV, in particular if used in in vivo imaging studies. Although this mouse model may not suffice as a model of human MPX disease, with an appropriate inbred mouse model, we can unravel many unknown aspects of MPX pathogenesis, including virulence factors, disease progression in rodent hosts, and viral shedding from infected animals. In addition, such a model can be utilized to test antivirals and the next generation of orthopoxvirus vaccines for their ability to alter the course of disease."
https://openalex.org/W1983080410,"Identification of bona fide direct nuclear receptor gene targets has been challenging but essential for understanding regulation of organismal physiological processes.We describe a methodology to identify transcription factor binding sites and target genes in vivo by intersecting microarray data, computational binding site queries, and evolutionary conservation. We provide detailed experimental validation of each step and, as a proof of principle, utilize the methodology to identify novel direct targets of the orphan nuclear receptor NR2F1 (COUP-TFI). The first step involved validation of microarray gene expression profiles obtained from wild-type and COUP-TFI(-/-) inner ear tissues. Secondly, we developed a bioinformatic tool to search for COUP-TFI DNA binding sites in genomes, using a classification-type Hidden Markov Model trained with 49 published COUP-TF response elements. We next obtained a ranked list of candidate in vivo direct COUP-TFI targets by integrating the microarray and bioinformatics analyses according to the degree of binding site evolutionary conservation and microarray statistical significance. Lastly, as proof-of-concept, 5 specific genes were validated for direct regulation. For example, the fatty acid binding protein 7 (Fabp7) gene is a direct COUP-TFI target in vivo because: i) we identified 2 conserved COUP-TFI binding sites in the Fabp7 promoter; ii) Fapb7 transcript and protein levels are significantly reduced in COUP-TFI(-/-) tissues and in MEFs; iii) chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrates that COUP-TFI is recruited to the Fabp7 promoter in vitro and in vivo and iv) it is associated with active chromatin having increased H3K9 acetylation and enrichment for CBP and SRC-1 binding in the newborn brain.We have developed and validated a methodology to identify in vivo direct nuclear receptor target genes. This bioinformatics tool can be modified to scan for response elements of transcription factors, cis-regulatory modules, or any flexible DNA pattern."
https://openalex.org/W1963788948,"In the face of accelerating species extinctions, map-based prioritization systems are increasingly useful to decide where to pursue conservation action most effectively. However, a number of seemingly inconsistent schemes have emerged, mostly focussing on endemism. Here we use global vertebrate distributions in terrestrial ecoregions to evaluate how continuous and categorical ranking schemes target and accumulate endangered taxa within the IUCN Red List, Alliance for Zero Extinction (AZE), and EDGE of Existence programme. We employed total, endemic and threatened species richness and an estimator for richness-adjusted endemism as metrics in continuous prioritization, and WWF's Global200 and Conservation International's (CI) Hotspots in categorical prioritization. Our results demonstrate that all metrics target endangerment more efficiently than by chance, but each selects unique sets of top-ranking ecoregions, which overlap only partially, and include different sets of threatened species. Using the top 100 ecoregions as defined by continuous prioritization metrics, we develop an inclusive map for global vertebrate conservation that incorporates important areas for endemism, richness, and threat. Finally, we assess human footprint and protection levels within these areas to reveal that endemism sites are more impacted but have more protection, in contrast to high richness and threat ones. Given such contrasts, major efforts to protect global biodiversity must involve complementary conservation approaches in areas of unique species as well as those with highest diversity and threat."
https://openalex.org/W2036794509,"Background Models for complex biological systems may involve a large number of parameters. It may well be that some of these parameters cannot be derived from observed data via regression techniques. Such parameters are said to be unidentifiable, the remaining parameters being identifiable. Closely related to this idea is that of redundancy, that a set of parameters can be expressed in terms of some smaller set. Before data is analysed it is critical to determine which model parameters are identifiable or redundant to avoid ill-defined and poorly convergent regression. Methodology/Principal Findings In this paper we outline general considerations on parameter identifiability, and introduce the notion of weak local identifiability and gradient weak local identifiability. These are based on local properties of the likelihood, in particular the rank of the Hessian matrix. We relate these to the notions of parameter identifiability and redundancy previously introduced by Rothenberg (Econometrica 39 (1971) 577–591) and Catchpole and Morgan (Biometrika 84 (1997) 187–196). Within the widely used exponential family, parameter irredundancy, local identifiability, gradient weak local identifiability and weak local identifiability are shown to be largely equivalent. We consider applications to a recently developed class of cancer models of Little and Wright (Math Biosciences 183 (2003) 111–134) and Little et al. (J Theoret Biol 254 (2008) 229–238) that generalize a large number of other recently used quasi-biological cancer models. Conclusions/Significance We have shown that the previously developed concepts of parameter local identifiability and redundancy are closely related to the apparently weaker properties of weak local identifiability and gradient weak local identifiability—within the widely used exponential family these concepts largely coincide."
https://openalex.org/W2032834921,"Dendritic cells (DCs) are highly specialized cells, which capture antigen in peripheral tissues and migrate to lymph nodes, where they dynamically interact with and activate T cells. Both migration and formation of DC-T cell contacts depend on cytoskeleton plasticity. However, the molecular bases governing these events have not been completely defined.Utilizing a T cell-dependent model of arthritis, we find that PLCgamma2-/- mice are protected from local inflammation and bone erosion. PLCgamma2 controls actin remodeling in dendritic cells, thereby affecting their capacity to prime T cells. DCs from PLCgamma2-/- mice mature normally, however they lack podosomes, typical actin structures of motile cells. Absence of PLCgamma2 impacts both DC trafficking to the lymph nodes and migration towards CCL21. The interaction with T cells is also affected by PLCgamma2 deficiency. Mechanistically, PLCgamma2 is activated by CCL21 and modulates Rac activation. Rac1/2-/- DCs also lack podosomes and do not respond to CCL21. Finally, antigen pulsed PLCgamma2-/- DCs fail to promote T cell activation and induce inflammation in vivo when injected into WT mice. Conversely, injection of WT DCs into PLCgamma2-/- mice rescues the inflammatory response but not focal osteolysis, confirming the importance of PLCgamma2 both in immune and bone systems.This study demonstrates a critical role for PLCgamma2 in eliciting inflammatory responses by regulating actin dynamics in DCs and positions the PLCgamma2 pathway as a common orchestrator of bone and immune cell functions during arthritis."
https://openalex.org/W1993757584,"Research on cell senescence and immortalization of murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) has revealed important clues about genetic control of senescence in humans. To investigate senescence and genetic alterations in the p53 pathway that lead to senescence bypass in culture, we compared the behavior of MEFs from wild-type mice with MEFs from Hupki mice, which harbor a humanized p53 gene. We found that humanizing the p53 gene in mice preserved major features of the MEF senescence/immortalization process. In both genotypes, a significant proportion of spontaneously arising cell lines had sustained either a p53 point mutation or p19/ARF biallelic deletion. The p53 mutations selected for during Hupki MEF immortalization have been found in human tumors and are classified in the yeast transactivation assay as transcriptionally defunct, suggesting that disabling this component of p53 activity is crucial in senescence bypass. Surprisingly, in spontaneously immortalized cell lines from both wild-type and Hupki MEFs, the predominant type of p53 mutation was a G to C transversion, rather than the G to T substitutions expected from the raised oxygen levels characteristic of standard culture conditions. Over half of the cell lines did not reveal evidence of p53 mutation or loss of p19/ARF and retained a robust wild-type p53 response to DNA damage, supporting the inference from senescence bypass screens that alternative genetic routes to immortalization occur."
https://openalex.org/W2093027168,"Background We previously identified a panel of genes associated with outcome of ovarian cancer. The purpose of the current study was to assess whether variants in these genes correlated with ovarian cancer risk. Methods and Findings Women with and without invasive ovarian cancer (749 cases, 1,041 controls) were genotyped at 136 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 13 candidate genes. Risk was estimated for each SNP and for overall variation within each gene. At the gene-level, variation within MSL1 (male-specific lethal-1 homolog) was associated with risk of serous cancer (p = 0.03); haplotypes within PRPF31 (PRP31 pre-mRNA processing factor 31 homolog) were associated with risk of invasive disease (p = 0.03). MSL1 rs7211770 was associated with decreased risk of serous disease (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.66–0.98; p = 0.03). SNPs in MFSD7, BTN3A3, ZNF200, PTPRS, and CCND1A were inversely associated with risk (p<0.05), and there was increased risk at HEXIM1 rs1053578 (p = 0.04, OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.02–1.91). Conclusions Tumor studies can reveal novel genes worthy of follow-up for cancer susceptibility. Here, we found that inherited markers in the gene encoding MSL1, part of a complex that modifies the histone H4, may decrease risk of invasive serous ovarian cancer."

Combining different compounds has resulted in enhanced tumor control and prolonged survival. However, methods querying the efficacy of such combinations have been hampered by limited scalability, analytical resolution, statistical feasibility, or a combination thereof. We have developed a theoretical framework modeling cellular viability as a stochastic lifetime process to determine synergistic compound combinations from high-throughput cellular screens. We apply our method to data derived from chemical perturbations of 65 cancer cell lines with two inhibitors. Our analysis revealed synergy for the combination of both compounds in subsets of cell lines. By contrast, in cell lines in which inhibition of one of both targets was sufficient to induce cell death, no synergy was detected, compatible with the topology of the oncogenically activated signaling network. In summary, we provide a tool for the measurement of synergy strength for combination perturbation experiments that might help define pathway topologies and direct clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2020448550,"Heparan sulfate (HS) is involved in essential physiological and pathophysiological functions. HS is a highly sulfated polysaccharide consisting of glucuronic acid (or iduronic acid) linked to glucosamine carrying various sulfo groups. Biosynthesis of HS involves sulfotransferases and an epimerase. The HS C(5)-epimerase converts glucuronic acid to iduronic acid. The method for determining the activity has been cumbersome due to the use of a site-specifically (3)H-labeled polysaccharide substrate. Here, we report a two-enzyme coupling assay to determine the activity of C(5)-epimerase. HS 2-O-sulfotransferase (2OST) transfers the sulfo group to the 2-OH-position of glucuronic or iduronic acid. Unlike the wild type protein, 2-O-sulfotransferase mutant (2OST Y94I) transfers sulfate to the iduronic acid but not to the glucuronic acid. Thus, 2OST Y94I cannot sulfate N-sulfated heparosan, a polysaccharide containing glucuronic acid. Incubating N-sulfated heparosan with C(5)-epimerase converts some of the glucuronic acid to iduronic acid, thus becoming a substrate for 2OST Y94I. The susceptibility of the C(5)-epimerase-treated N-sulfated heparosan to 2OST Y94I modification directly correlates to the amount of the activity of C(5)-epimerase, proving that this two-enzyme coupling system can be used to assay for C(5)-epimerase. The method was further used to determine the activities of various C(5)-epimerase mutants. Our approach will significantly reduce the complexity for assaying the activity of C(5)-epimerase and facilitate the structural and functional analysis of C(5)-epimerase."
https://openalex.org/W1979833623,"Most mitochondrial mRNAs in trypanosomes undergo uridine insertion/deletion editing that is catalyzed by approximately 20S editosomes. The editosome component KREPA3 is essential for editosome structural integrity and its two zinc finger (ZF) motifs are essential for editing in vivo but not in vitro. KREPA3 function was further explored by examining the consequence of mutation of its N- and C-terminal ZFs (ZF1 and ZF2, respectively). Exclusively expressed myc-tagged KREPA3 with ZF2 mutation resulted in lower KREPA3 abundance and a relative increase in KREPA2 and KREL1 proteins. Detailed analysis of edited RNA products revealed the accumulation of partially edited mRNAs with less insertion editing compared to the partially edited mRNAs found in the cells with wild type KREPA3 expression. Mutation of ZF1 in TAP-tagged KREPA3 also resulted in accumulation of partially edited mRNAs that were shorter and only edited in the 3'-terminal editing region. Mutation of both ZFs essentially eliminated partially edited mRNA. The mutations did not affect gRNA abundance. These data indicate that both ZFs are essential for the progression of editing and perhaps its accuracy, which suggests that KREPA3 plays roles in the editing process via its ZFs interaction with editosome proteins and/or RNA substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1972412641,"Background Amino acid sequence alignment of phage phiC31 integrase with the serine recombinases family revealed highly conserved regions outside the catalytic domain. Until now, no system mutational or biochemical studies have been carried out to assess the roles of these conserved residues in the recombinaton of phiC31 integrase. Methodology/Principal Findings To determine the functional roles of these conserved residues, a series of conserved residues were targeted by site-directed mutagenesis. Out of the 17 mutants, 11 mutants showed impaired or no recombination ability, as analyzed by recombination assay both in vivo and in vitro. Results of DNA binding activity assays showed that mutants (R18A, I141A, L143A,E153A, I432A and V571A) exhibited a great decrease in DNA binding affinity, and mutants (G182A/F183A, C374A, C376A/G377A, Y393A and V566A) had completely lost their ability to bind to the specific target DNA attB as compared with wild-type protein. Further analysis of mutants (R18A, I141A, L143A and E153A) synapse and cleavage showed that these mutants were blocked in recombination at the stage of strand cleavage. Conclusions/Significance This data reveals that some of the highly conserved residues both in the N-terminus and C-terminus region of phiC31 integrase, play vital roles in the substrate binding and cleavage. The cysteine-rich motif and the C-tail val-rich region of phiC31 integrase may represent the major DNA binding domains of phiC31 integrase."
https://openalex.org/W2044893256,"Background Sufficient information from in vitro and in vivo studies has become available to permit computer modeling of the processes that occur in the myometrium during labor. This development allows the in silico investigation of pathological mechanisms and the trialing of potential treatments. Methods/Results Based on the human literature, we developed a computer model of the immune-endocrine environment of the myometrial cell. The interactions between molecules are represented by differential equations. The model is designed to simulate the estrogen and progesterone receptor changes during pregnancy and particularly the changes in the progesterone receptor (PR) isoforms A and B that are thought to mediate functional progesterone withdrawal in the human at labor. Parturition is represented by an increase in the PRA to PRB ratio to levels seen in women in labor. Infection is shown by inducing inflammation in the system by increasing phospho-IkB kinase concentration (IKK) levels; which lead to increased NF-κB activation, causing an increase in the PRA/PRB ratio. We examined the effects of progesterone or cyclo-oxygenase 2 (Cox2) inhibitor treatments on the PRA/PRB ratio in silico. The model predicted that high doses of progesterone and Cox2 inhibition would be effective in preventing an NF-κB-induced PRA/PRB ratio increase to the levels found during labor. Conclusions Our data illustrate the use of dynamic biological computer simulations to test the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. This may allow the early rejection of ineffective therapies prior to expensive field trials."
https://openalex.org/W2018244108,"Marine protected area (MPA) networks have been proposed as a principal method for conserving biological diversity, yet patterns of diversity may ultimately complicate or compromise the development of such networks. We show how a series of ecological null models can be applied to assemblage data across sites in order to identify non-random biological patterns likely to influence the effectiveness of MPA network design. We use fish census data from Caribbean fore-reefs as a test system and demonstrate that: 1) site assemblages were nested, such that species found on sites with relatively few species were subsets of those found on sites with relatively many species, 2) species co-occurred across sites more than expected by chance once species-habitat associations were accounted for, and 3) guilds were most evenly represented at the richest sites and richness among all guilds was correlated (i.e., species and trophic diversity were closely linked). These results suggest that the emerging Caribbean marine protected area network will likely be successful at protecting regional diversity even if planning is largely constrained by insular, inventory-based design efforts. By recasting ecological null models as tests of assemblage patterns likely to influence management action, we demonstrate how these classic tools of ecological theory can be brought to bear in applied conservation problems."
https://openalex.org/W2077920244,"Exogenous expression of pharmacological targets in transformed cell lines has been the traditional platform for high throughput screening of small molecules. However, exogenous expression in these cells is limited by aberrant dosage, or its toxicity, the potential lack of interaction partners, and alterations to physiology due to transformation itself. Instead, primary cells or cells differentiated from precursors are more physiological, but less amenable to exogenous expression of reporter systems. To overcome this challenge, we stably expressed c-Photina, a Ca(2+)-sensitive photoprotein, driven by a ubiquitous promoter in a mouse embryonic stem (mES) cell line. The same embryonic stem cell line was also used to generate a transgenic mouse that expresses c-Photina in most tissues. We show here that these cells and mice provide an efficient source of primary cells, cells differentiated from mES cells, including cardiomyocytes, neurons, astrocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells, pancreatic islet cells, stably and robustly expressing c-Photina, and may be exploited for miniaturized high throughput screening. Moreover, we provide evidence that the transgenic mice may be suitable for ex-vivo bioimaging studies in both cells and tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1995618624,"Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) is a major inflammatory mediator that exhibits actions leading to tissue destruction and hampering recovery from damage. At present, two antibodies against human TNF-α (hTNF-α) are available, which are widely used for the clinic treatment of certain inflammatory diseases. This work was undertaken to identify a novel functional epitope of hTNF-α. We performed screening peptide library against anti-hTNF-α antibodies, ELISA and competitive ELISA to obtain the epitope of hTNF-α. The key residues of the epitope were identified by means of combinatorial alanine scanning and site-specific mutagenesis. The N terminus (80–91 aa) of hTNF-α proved to be a novel epitope (YG1). The two amino acids of YG1, proline and valine, were identified as the key residues, which were important for hTNF-α biological function. Furthermore, the function of the epitope was addressed on an animal model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). CIA could be suppressed in an animal model by prevaccination with the derivative peptides of YG1. The antibodies of YG1 could also inhibit the cytotoxicity of hTNF-α. These results demonstrate that YG1 is a novel epitope associated with the biological function of hTNF-α and the antibodies against YG1 can inhibit the development of CIA in animal model, so it would be a potential target of new therapeutic antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2044637338,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase (HIV-1 RT) is a DNA polymerase that converts viral RNA genomes into proviral DNAs. How HIV-1 RT regulates nucleotide selectivity is a central issue for genetics and the nucleoside analog RT inhibitor (NRTI) resistance of HIV-1.Here we show that an ATP molecule at physiological concentrations acts as an allosteric regulator of HIV-1 RT to decrease the K(m) value of the substrate, decrease the k(cat) value, and increase the K(i) value of NRTIs for RT. Computer-assisted structural analyses and mutagenesis studies suggested the positions of the ATP molecule and NRTI-resistance mutations during a catalytic reaction, which immediately predict possible influences on nucleotide insertion into the catalytic site, the DNA polymerization, and the excision reaction.These data imply that the ATP molecule and NRTI mutations can modulate nucleotide selectivity by altering the fidelity of the geometric selection of nucleotides and the probability of an excision reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2078701418,"Background Using the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (K-ABC) Conant et al. (1999) observed that visual and auditory working memory (WM) span were independent in both younger and older children from DR Congo, but related in older American children and in Lao children [1]. The present study evaluated whether visual and auditory WM span were independent in Ugandan and Senegalese children. Method In a linear regression analysis we used visual (Spatial Memory, Hand Movements) and auditory (Number Recall) WM along with education and physical development (weight/height) as predictors. The predicted variable in this analysis was Word Order, which is a verbal memory task that has both visual and auditory memory components. Results Both the younger (<8.5 yrs) and older (>8.5 yrs) Ugandan children had auditory memory span (Number Recall) that was strongly predictive of Word Order performance. For both the younger and older groups of Senegalese children, only visual WM span (Spatial Memory) was strongly predictive of Word Order. Number Recall was not significantly predictive of Word Order in either age group. Conclusions It is possible that greater literacy from more schooling for the Ugandan age groups mediated their greater degree of interdependence between auditory and verbal WM. Our findings support those of Conant et al., who observed in their cross-cultural comparisons that stronger education seemed to enhance the dominance of the phonological-auditory processing loop for WM."
https://openalex.org/W2044426320,"Complement neutralizes invading pathogens, stimulates inflammatory and adaptive immune responses, and targets non- or altered-self structures for clearance. In the classical and lectin activation pathways, it is initiated when complexes composed of separate recognition and activation subcomponents bind to a pathogen surface. Despite its apparent complexity, recognition-mediated activation has evolved independently in three separate protein families, C1q, mannose-binding lectins (MBLs), and serum ficolins. Although unrelated, all have bouquet-like architectures and associate with complement-specific serine proteases: MBLs and ficolins with MBL-associated serine protease-2 (MASP-2) and C1q with C1r and C1s. To examine the structural requirements for complement activation, we have created a number of novel recombinant rat MBLs in which the position and orientation of the MASP-binding sites have been changed. We have also engineered MASP binding into a pulmonary surfactant protein (SP-A), which has the same domain structure and architecture as MBL but lacks any intrinsic complement activity. The data reveal that complement activity is remarkably tolerant to changes in the size and orientation of the collagenous stalks of MBL, implying considerable rotational and conformational flexibility in unbound MBL. Furthermore, novel complement activity is introduced concurrently with MASP binding in SP-A but is uncontrolled and occurs even in the absence of a carbohydrate target. Thus, the active rather than the zymogen state is default in lectin.MASP complexes and must be inhibited through additional regions in circulating MBLs until triggered by pathogen recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2003049746,"Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is a B-cell-specific DNA mutator that plays a key role in the formation of the secondary antibody repertoire in germinal center B cells. In the search for binding partners, protein coimmunoprecipitation assays are often performed, generally with agarose beads.We found that, regardless of whether cell lysates containing exogenous or endogenous AID were examined, one of two mouse AID forms bound to agarose alone.These binding characteristics may be due to the known post-translational modifications of AID; they may also need to be considered in coimmunoprecipitation experiments to avoid false-positive results."
https://openalex.org/W2092094880,"To find a suitable ligand from a complex antigen system is still a mission to be accomplished. Here we have explored a novel ""library against proteome"" panning strategy for ligand screening and antigen purification from a complex system using phage-displayed antibody technology. Human plasma proteome was targeted for phage library panning. During the process, the panning was carried out in solution, using a biotin/streptavidin beads separation system, for three rounds. Nine monoclonal phages, bound tightly to a number of unknown plasma proteins, were selected from the last round, six of which were directly employed as cross-linked matrices to purify their corresponding antigens from the plasma. The proteins isolated by G5 and E1 matrices were identified as amyloid protein and apolipoprotein A-I precursor, respectively. The results demonstrated that it was feasible to simultaneously obtain a number of ligand phages for various antigens, including low abundant proteins in a non-comparative proteome-wide system."
