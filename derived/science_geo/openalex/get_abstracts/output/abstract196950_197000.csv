 activity of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The article influenced much of the subsequent research on hormone action,
 including the Rodbell's work."

This attractive possibility has been rendered tenuous by the finding of hyperprotection by irradiating at low temperatures2 or by irradiating in the presence of agents such as cysteine3. Both these devices decrease the slope of the survival curves by a factor of about 1.4. The purpose of this communication is to present a technique which decreases the slope of the survival curve by a factor of about 2.5."

https://openalex.org/W92815583,"Grant (1) and Reithel and coworkers (2) have reported that the enzyme systems of the mammary gland are not capable of utilizing galactose phosphates or galactose per se for the synthesis of lactose. This observation is difficult to reconcile with recent developments on the mechanism of enzymatic synthesis of lactose and particularly on the roles of uridine diphosphate glucose1 and uridine diphosphate galactose (3-5). In our laboratory, evidence has been obtained which points to a direct utilization of galactose for the synthesis of lactose in the guinea pig. The experiments reported in this paper contribute to the elucidation of the mechanism of synthesis of lactose in the mammary gland. Galactose-l-Cl* was injected intraperitoneally into a lactating guinea pig, and samples of milk were collected at varying time intervals. The specific activity and the labeling pattern of the lactose from the milk were then determined. For comparative purposes, glucose-l-C’* was used as the marker in other experiments. In all experiments Cl*-labeled lactose was produced rapidly from the labeled monosaccharides and attained a maximal specific activity in about 4 hours. Hydrolysis of the lactose-C* to its monosaccharide constituents, followed by activity measurements, showed that the lactose possessed unequal labeling in the glucose and galactose moieties. The galactose of lactose-Cl* produced from galactose-l-Cl* was considerably more radioactive, and the galactose of lactose-C* produced from glucose-l-C’* was less radioactive than the glucose. On degradation of the glucose-C* and galactose-Cl* from the lactose-Cl*, essentially all of the radioactivity was found at position 1 of the monosaccharides."
