https://openalex.org/W2021819896,"Several vasoactive peptides administered intracisternally have been assessed for the effect of lowering the core temperature of rats exposed to cold. Peptides structurally related to neurotensin lower core temperature while those related to substance P do not. The tetradecapeptide bombesin, orginally isolated from the extracts of the skin of the frog Bombina bombina, is 10(4) times more potent than neurotensin in lowering core temperature, with a minimal effective dose less than or equal to 1 nanogram per 200 grams of body weight. Thus bombesin is one of the most potent peptides reported to affect the central nervous system."

The morphological similarity of the X and Y chromosomes, and the observation of Y chromosomes intermediate between the X and normal Y, suggest that the sex chromosomes are at an early stage of differentiation in this species."

These results have implications for the ontogeny of associative processes and for their neurological and neurochemical mediators."
https://openalex.org/W2066277412,Freeze fracture studies of skeletal muscle from eight patients with Duchenne dystrophy showed nonuniform distribution and depletion of particles on both protoplasmic and extracellular faces of the muscle plasma membrane. The findings support the view that the muscle surface membrane is abnormal in this disorder and indicate that alterations are present in the internal molecular architecture of the membrane.

https://openalex.org/W2041037450,"X-LINKED Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a serious genetic disorder for which at present there is no effective treatment. It is characterised by progressive muscle wasting and weakness which first becomes apparent around the age of 3â€“5 years, leading to death usually before the age of 20 (ref. 1). A proportion of female heterozygous carriers have significantly elevated serum levels of creatine kinase and a woman who is found to be at high risk of having an affected son can elect to have amniocentesis with antenatal foetal sexing and selective abortion of any male foetus. A proportion of such aborted foetuses will, however, be normal but since the cause of the disorder is not known it is not yet possible to diagnose an affected male foetus in utero. As a first step in this direction we have examined the muscle histology and levels of creatine kinase in serum, muscle and amniotic fluid in a number of therapeutically aborted male foetuses at risk for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. We report that muscle histology, and possibly the serum level of creatine kinase, may be abnormal in this disorder even by the second trimester of pregnancy."

An irregular endothelium at the intimal cushion region of 5-week-old birds gives rise to extensive areas of pitted endothelium and subendothelial exposure. Thrombocytes, thrombocyte aggregates, and leukocytes are associated with the developing lesion."

Such cycles contrast with the relative independence from torpor of the period of circannual cycles in other hibernating rodents and with the temperature compensation of circannual and circadian cycles in general."

https://openalex.org/W1982150832,Patients with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome with virtually no hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase activity demonstrate significantly low plasma activity of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase but normal basal levels of norepinephrine. Under conditions of emotional or postural stress the plasma concentrations of norepinephrine in Lesch-Nyhan patients increased less than in a normal population.

A photocell glued to the bird's beak provided a signal to the computer when the beak approached a form, and the computer recorded the time and target of the response. As in some similar studies with human subjects, erros and reaction times increased with number of x forms displayed. The method appears promising for further studies of search and of other processes related to perception and information-processing in birds."
