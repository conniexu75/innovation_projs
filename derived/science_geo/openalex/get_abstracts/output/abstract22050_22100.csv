https://openalex.org/W2012694659,"The function of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) invariant chains, CD3 gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta, is poorly understood. Evidence suggests that CD3 couples receptor ligand binding to intracellular signaling events. To examine the role of the CD3 zeta chain in TCR-mediated signal transduction, a chimeric protein linking the extracellular and transmembrane domains of CD8 to the cytoplasmic domain of the zeta chain was constructed. The CD8/zeta chimera is expressed independently of the TCR and is capable of transducing signals that, by criteria of early and late activation, are indistinguishable from those generated by the intact TCR. These data indicate that CD8/zeta can activate the appropriate signal transduction pathways in the absence of CD3 gamma, delta, and epsilon, and suggest that the role of CD3 zeta is to couple the TCR to intracellular signal transduction mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2037010084,"The ligand (KL) for the c-kit receptor is a growth factor encoded at the mouse steel (Sl) locus. KL exists in both cell surface and soluble forms, though little is known of the regulation and functional significance of these forms. We show here that tissue-specific alternative splicing gives two types of KL mRNA. Both encode a transmembrane domain, but in transfected cells one produced the soluble form of KL at relatively high levels, whereas the other preferentially gave the cell surface form. Cell surface KL not only stimulated proliferation, but also mediated cell-cell adhesion. The SId allele, which impairs development of hematopoietic cells, melanocytes, and germ cells, has a deletion in the KL gene removing the transmembrane and intracellular domains. Expression of a corresponding cDNA gave a soluble protein that stimulated cellular proliferation but was not associated with the cell surface. These results provide evidence that cell surface KL has a critical role in the intact organism."

We show here that a related 66 kd kinase, called mik1, acts redundantly with wee1 in the negative regulation of cdc2 in S. pombe. A null allele of mik1 has no discernible phenotype, but a mik1 wee1 double mutant is hypermitotically lethal: all normal M phase checkpoints are bypassed, including the requirement for initiation of cell cycle ""start,"" completion of S phase, and function of the cdc25+ mitotic activator. In the absence of mik1 and wee1 activity, cdc2 rapidly loses phosphate on tyrosine, both in strains undergoing mitotic lethality and in those that are viable owing to a compensating mutation within cdc2. The data suggest that mik1 and wee1 act cooperatively on cdc2, either directly as the inhibitory tyrosine kinase or as essential activators of that kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1541963905,"Authentic N omega-hydroxy-L-arginine was synthesized and used to determine whether it is an intermediate in nitric oxide (.NO) synthesis from L-arginine by macrophage .NO synthase. The apparent Km (6.6 microM) and Vmax (99 nmol x min-1 x mg-1) observed with N omega-hydroxy-L-arginine were similar to those observed with L-arginine (Km = 2.3 microM; Vmax = 54 mumol x min-1 x mg-1). N omega-Hydroxy-D-arginine was not a substrate. Stable isotope studies showed that .NO synthase exclusively oxidized the hydroxylated nitrogen of N omega-hydroxy-L-arginine, forming .NO and L-citrulline. As with L-arginine, O2 was the source of the ureido oxygen in L-citrulline from N omega-hydroxy-L-arginine. In the presence of excess N omega-hydroxy-L-arginine, .NO synthase generated a metabolite of L-[14C]arginine that cochromatographed with authentic N omega-hydroxy-L-arginine. The labeled metabolite exhibited identical chromatographic behavior in three solvent systems and generated the same product (L-citrulline) upon alkaline hydrolysis as authentic N omega-hydroxy-L-arginine. Experiments were then run to identify which redox cofactor (NADPH or tetrahydrobiopterin) participated in the enzymatic synthesis of N omega-hydroxy-L-arginine. Both cofactors were required for synthesis of .NO from either N omega-hydroxy-L-arginine or L-arginine. However, with L-arginine, the synthesis of 1 mol of .NO was coupled to the oxidation of 1.52 +/- 0.02 mol of NADPH; whereas with N omega-hydroxy-L-arginine, only 0.53 +/- 0.04 mol of NADPH was oxidized per mol of .NO formed. These results support a mechanism in which N omega-hydroxy-L-arginine is generated as an intermediate in .NO synthesis through an NADPH-dependent hydroxylation of L-arginine."

https://openalex.org/W1586068082,"Pharmacological and molecular cloning studies have demonstrated heterogeneity of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. We have now cloned two alpha 1-adrenergic receptors from a rat cerebral cortex cDNA library, using the hamster alpha 1B-adrenergic receptor as a probe. The deduced amino acid sequence of clone RA42 encodes a protein of 560 amino acids whose putative topology is similar to that of the family of G-protein-coupled receptors. The primary structure though most closely resembles that of an alpha 1-adrenergic receptor, having approximately 73% amino acid identity in the putative transmembrane domains with the previously isolated hamster alpha 1B receptor. Analysis of the ligand binding properties of RA42 expressed in COS-7 cells with a variety of adrenergic ligands demonstrates a unique alpha 1-adrenergic receptor pharmacology. High affinity for the antagonist WB4101 and agonists phenylephrine and methoxamine suggests that cDNA RA42 encodes the alpha 1A receptor subtype. Northern blot analysis of various rat tissues also shows the distribution expected of the alpha 1A receptor subtype with abundant expression in vas deferens followed by hippocampus, cerebral cortex, aorta, brainstem, heart and spleen. The second alpha 1-adrenergic receptor cloned represents the rat homolog of the hamster alpha 1B subtype. Expression of mRNA for this receptor is strongly detected in liver followed by heart, cerebral cortex, brain stem, kidney, lung, and spleen. This study provides definitive evidence for the existence of three alpha 1-adrenergic receptor subtypes."

https://openalex.org/W1948737025,"Hepatocytes are stimulated to produce nitric oxide (NO.) from L-arginine in response to conditioned Kupffer cell medium or a combination of cytokines. Associated with the production of NO.in hepatocytes, there is a profound decrease in total protein synthesis ([3H]leucine incorporation). This report demonstrates that authentic NO.and the NO.-generating compound S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine inhibit hepatocyte total protein synthesis in a reversible and concentration-dependent fashion. In parallel with the suppression of hepatocyte total protein synthesis, authentic NO.inhibits the production of two specific hepatocyte proteins, albumin and fibrinogen, without influencing the quantity of albumin mRNA. Although authentic NO.induces a rapid increase in cGMP levels in hepatocytes, the addition of the cGMP analog 8-bromoguanosine 3':5' cyclic monophosphate to unstimulated HC cultures does not reproduce the inhibition of total protein synthesis. These data show that NO.is the hepatocyte L-arginine metabolite that inhibits protein synthesis. Furthermore, these findings indicate that NO.does not inhibit hepatocyte protein synthesis solely through the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase but appears to affect a translational or posttranslational process."
https://openalex.org/W1530195638,Attachment of heterotrimeric G-proteins to the inner face of the plasma membrane is fundamental to their role as signal transducers by allowing interaction with both receptors and effectors. Certain G-protein alpha subunits are anchored to the membrane by covalent myristoylation. The beta gamma complex is required for G-protein interaction with receptors and is independently membrane associated through an unknown mechanism. A series of carboxyl-terminal modifications including isoprenylation which may contribute to membrane attachment has been identified recently in G-protein gamma subunits. Expression and membrane targeting of beta and gamma subunits were examined in COS cells. The expression of either subunit was found to require cotransfection with both beta and gamma cDNAs. Mutation of the carboxyl-terminal cysteine residue of gamma shown to undergo isoprenylation and carboxymethyl-esterification preserved beta gamma expression but blocked isoprenylation and membrane attachment. These results implicate the carboxyl-terminal processing of G-protein gamma subunits and beta coexpression as necessary and sufficient for membrane targeting of the beta gamma complex.
https://openalex.org/W1993532214,"Erythropoiesis during human development is characterized by switches in expression of beta-like globin genes during the transition from the embryonic through fetal to adult stages. Activation and high-level expression of the genes is directed by the locus control region (LCR), located 5' to the epsilon gene. The location of the LCR and its role in directing high-level expression of the globin genes has led to the suggestion that competition from the beta gene for interaction with the LCR has a major role in silencing the fetal gamma genes during adult life. We have now constructed lines of transgenic mice containing the human A gamma globin gene linked to the LCR. We observe high-level expression of the transgene in the embryonic stages but silencing of the gene in adult animals. We conclude that the gamma gene is not deregulated by the presence of the LCR and that competition from the beta gene is not required for silencing of the gamma genes in adult life. The silencing is therefore likely to be mediated by stage-specific factors binding to sequences immediately flanking the genes."
https://openalex.org/W1777863255,"GMP-140 is a 140-kDa granule membrane glycoprotein localized to the alpha-granules of platelets and the Weibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells. Expression of GMP-140 on the activated cell surface has been shown to mediate the adhesion of thrombin-activated platelets to neutrophils and monocytes and the transient adhesion of neutrophils to endothelium. In contrast, fluid-phase GMP-140 strongly inhibits the CD18-dependent adhesion of tumor necrosis factor alpha-activated neutrophils to endothelium suggesting that GMP-140 can also serve an anti-adhesive function. In the present report, it is demonstrated that fluid-phase GMP-140 which exists predominantly as a tetramer binds to a single class of high affinity receptor on neutrophils and HL60 cells. Binding of 125I-labeled GMP-140 to neutrophils and HL60 cells and the rosetting of neutrophils and HL60 cells by thrombin-activated platelets were inhibited by EDTA, excess unlabeled fluid-phase GMP-140, Fab fragments of an affinity-purified rabbit anti-GMP-140 antibody, and by the murine anti-GMP-140 monoclonal antibody, AK 4. Both neutrophil and HL60 GMP-140 binding and platelet rosetting were strongly inhibited by heparin, fucoidin, and dextran sulfate 500,000, were partially inhibited by dextran sulfate 5,000 and lambda- and kappa-carrageenan, but were not inhibited by chondroitins 4- and 6-sulfate. Since this sulfated glycan specificity is identical to that previously reported by us for GMP-140, the present results suggest that the sulfated glycan binding site and the neutrophil receptor binding site on GMP-140 are either identical or proximal."
https://openalex.org/W277000647,"Protein tyrosine phosphorylation has not been considered to be important for cellular activation by phospholipase C-linked vasoactive peptides. We found that endothelin, angiotensin II, and vasopressin (AVP), peptides that signal via phospholipase C activation, rapidly enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins of approximate molecular mass 225, 190, 135, 120, and 70 kDa in rat renal mesangial cells. The phosphorylated proteins were cytosolic or membrane-associated, and none were integral to the membrane, suggesting that the peptide receptors are not phosphorylated on tyrosine. Epidermal growth factor (EGF), which does not activate phospholipase C in these cells, induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of its own 175-kDa receptor, in addition to five proteins of identical molecular mass to those phosphorylated in response to endothelin, AVP, and angiotensin II. This suggests that in mesangial cells there is a common signaling pathway for phospholipase C-coupled agonists and agonists classically assumed to signal via receptor tyrosine kinase pathways, such as EGF. The phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and the synthetic diacylglycerol, oleoyl acetylglycerol, stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins identical to those phosphorylated by the phospholipase C-linked peptides, suggesting that protein kinase C (PKC) activation is sufficient to active tyrosine phosphorylation. However, the PKC inhibitor, staurosporine, and down-regulation of PKC activity by prolonged exposure to phorbol esters completely inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation in response to PMA but not to endothelin, AVP, or EGF. In conclusion, endothelin, angiotensin II, and AVP enhances protein tyrosine phosphorylation via at least two pathways, PKC-dependent and PKC-independent. Although activation of PKC may be sufficient to enhance protein tyrosine phosphorylation, PKC is not necessary and may not be the primary route by which these agents act. At least one of these pathways is shared with the growth factor EGF, suggesting not only common intermediates in the signaling pathways for growth factors and vasoactive peptides but also perhaps common cellular tyrosine kinases which phosphorylate these intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W2060623940,"INTEGRINS are a family of αβ heterodimeric receptors that mediate cell-cell and cell-substratum interactions. Integrin binding to extracellular ligands regulates cell adhesion, shape, motility, intracellular signalling and gene expression1-3. Mechanisms that regulate integrin function are, therefore, central to the participation of integrins in a diverse set of cellular events. Here we report the identification of TASC, a monoclonal antibody to a novel epitope on the integrin β1 subunit, which inhibits cell adhesion to vitronectin but promotes adhesion to laminin and collagen types I and IV. We show that developing retinal neurons that have lost responsiveness to laminin4 regain the ability to bind laminin in the presence of TASC. Thus, β1-class integrins are likely to occupy multiple affinity states that can be modulated at the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1990859310,"Mechanosensitive channels can be observed in most cell types during single-channel recording and have been implicated in many cellular processes. Potassium-selective single-channel currents, both stretch-activated and stretch-inactivated, can be observed in growth cones and cell bodies of Lymnaea stagnalis neurons. Equivalent macroscopic mechanosensitive currents could not, however, be elicited while applying various mechanical stimuli. This discrepancy suggests that single-channel mechanosensitivity is an artifact of patch recording."
https://openalex.org/W1492821293,"The enzyme reverse transcriptase (RT) is crucial in the early steps of the life cycle of retroviruses. We have expressed in bacteria the RTs from human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) types 1 and 2 in order to study the structural-functional relationships of these two multifunctional enzymes that share a relatively high degree of amino acid sequence homology. For comparison purposes, we have analyzed several catalytic functions of both enzymes. The two HIV RTs show a high similarity in many aspects studied but exhibit profound differences in several other properties. For instance, the specific RNase H activity of HIV-2 RT is about 10 times lower than the corresponding activity of HIV-1 RT. There are also significant dissimilarities between some of the apparent Km values calculated for the DNA polymerizing functions of both enzymes. Furthermore, the heat stability of the DNA polymerizing activity of HIV-2 RT is about 15-fold higher than that of HIV-1 RT. On the other hand, the susceptibility of the RNase H activities of the two enzymes to heat inactivation was found to be similar. Other treatments also enable discrimination between the RNase H and DNA polymerizing catalytic properties of the two enzymes (although both reverse transcriptases respond similarily). Thus, the RNase H activity was inactivated by N-ethylmaleimide, suggesting the possible involvement of cysteine residues in performing this activity, whereas the DNA polymerizing functions of the two enzymes were fully resistant to this chemical modification. The zinc chelator 1,10-phenanthroline affected the DNA polymerase activities of both enzymes to a significantly higher extent than the RNase H activity. In all, the two HIV RTs were shown to be substantially different one from the other in several of their properties and also distinct from other RTs thus far studied."
https://openalex.org/W2152598344,"We have localized acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) mRNA in the developing and adult rat brain using in situ hybridization histochemistry. Prenatally, hybridization to aFGF mRNA was observed throughout the brain, with the strongest signal associated with cells of the developing cortical plate. Postnatally, labeling was localized to specific neuronal populations. In the hippocampus, labeling of the pyramidal cell layer and dentate granule cells was observed and became progressively more intense with maturation. Labeling was also observed in both the external and internal granule cell layers of the developing cerebellum. Pyramidal cells of the neocortex as well as neurons of the substantia nigra and locus ceruleus also express aFGF. This pattern persists into adulthood, although the intensity of the labeling is significantly reduced in the adult brain. These patterns of hybridization correlate with specific developmental events and suggest that aFGF plays a significant role in both central nervous system development and neuronal viability in the adult brain."
https://openalex.org/W1995100932,Derivatives of the sunY self-splicing intron efficiently catalyzed the synthesis of complementary strand RNA by template-directed assembly of oligonucleotides. These ribozymes were separated into three short RNA fragments that formed active catalytic complexes. One of the multisubunit sunY derivatives catalyzed the synthesis of a strand of RNA complementary to one of its own subunits. These results suggest that prebiotically synthesized oligonucleotides might have been able to assemble into a complex capable of self-replication.
https://openalex.org/W1512880140,"The major ribonuclease H from K562 human erythroleukemia cells has been purified more than 4,000-fold. This RNase H, now termed RNase H1, is an endoribonuclease whose products contain 5'-phosphoryl and 3'-hydroxyl termini. The enzyme has a native molecular weight of 89,000 based on its sedimentation and diffusion coefficients. Human RNase H1 has an absolute requirement for a divalent cation. Maximal activity is obtained with either 10 mM Mg2+, 5 mM Co2+, or 0.5 mM Mn2+. The pH optimum is between 8.0 and 8.5 in the presence of 10 mM Mg2+. The isoelectric point is 6.4. RNase H1 lacks double-stranded and single-stranded RNase and DNase activities, and it will not hydrolyze the DNA moiety of an RNA.DNA heteroduplex. Unlike the Escherichia coli enzyme, which requires a heteroduplex that contains at least four consecutive ribonucleotides for activity, human RNase H1 can hydrolyze a DNA.RNA.DNA/DNA heteroduplex that contains a single ribonucleotide. Cleavage occurs at the 5' phosphodiester of this residue. This substrate specificity suggests that human RNase H1 could play a role in ribonucleotide excision from genomic DNA during replication."
https://openalex.org/W1655632696,"Acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) is a broad spectrum mitogen that is stabilized by complexation with heparin and heparan proteoglycans. The monomeric human protein contains 3 reduced cysteine residues of unknown function, the first 2 of which are conserved among all seven known fibroblast growth factors. The influence of these free sulfhydryl groups on the level, stability, and heparin dependence of the mitogenic activity at physiological temperature and pH is characterized using a complete set of site-directed mutants in which either any 1, 2, or all 3 of the cysteine residues are converted to serines. Mutants of aFGF in which either any 2 or all 3 cysteine residues are substituted by serines are more active, have longer activity half-lives, and are less heparin dependent than wild-type aFGF. In contrast, wild-type aFGF and the three mutants that each retain 2 cysteine residues inactivate more rapidly in the absence of heparin by a nonproteolytic mechanism but are markedly stabilized by heparin. This cysteine-mediated destabilization of aFGF not only diminishes its activity in the absence of heparin in tissue culture but also could functionally restrict its activity in vivo to the vicinity of mast cell-derived heparins and heparan proteoglycans associated with cell surfaces and basement membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2147471946,"A new member of the connexin gene family has been identified and designated rat connexin-31 (Cx31) based on its predicted molecular mass of 30,960 daltons. Cx31 is 270 amino acids long and is coded for by a single copy gene. It is expressed as a 1.7-kilobase mRNA that is detected in placenta, Harderian gland, skin, and eye. Cx31 is highly conserved and can be detected in species as distantly related to rat as Xenopus laevis. It exhibits extensive sequence similarity to the previously identified connexins, 58, 50, and 40% amino acid identity to Cx26, Cx32, and Cx43, respectively. When conservation of predicted phosphorylation sites is used to adjust the alignment of Cx31 to other connexins, a unique alignment of three predicted protein kinase C phosphorylation sites near the carboxyl terminus of Cx31 with three sites at the carboxyl terminus of Cx43 is revealed."
https://openalex.org/W1584676665,"A cDNA clone derived from the gene encoding a cysteine proteinase of pathogenic Entamoeba histolytica was isolated using an antiserum to the purified enzyme. This clone was used to identify the homologous clone in a cDNA library from nonpathogenic E. histolytica. Sequence analysis and comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences revealed a sequence divergence of 16%. Southern blot analyses indicated that (i) pathogenic isolates may contain more genes coding for these or related enzymes than nonpathogenic isolates, (ii) the structure and organization of these genes are conserved within each group of amoebae, and (iii) none of the genes is found in both pathogenic and nonpathogenic E. histolytica, underlining the notion that the two groups are genetically distinct. Northern blot analyses suggested that the cysteine proteinase is expressed by pathogenic isolates in substantially higher amounts than by nonpathogenic isolates. Overexpression of this enzyme may be an important factor in the pathogenicity of E. histolytica."
https://openalex.org/W1679321764,"Charybdotoxin, a blocker of K+ channels, and the imidazole drug SC38249, a blocker of both voltage- and second messenger-operated Ca2+ channels, were employed in mouse NIH-3T3 fibroblasts overexpressing the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor 1) to characterize the ionic events activated by EGF; and 2) to establish the role of those events in cell growth. The [Ca2+]i response by EGF was little changed by charybdotoxin while the parallel hyperpolarization was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. At high toxin concentrations (greater than 3 x 10(-8) M), the effect of EGF on membrane potential was turned into a persistent depolarization sustained by both Na+ and Ca2+. Pretreatment with 10 microM SC38249 induced only minor changes of the intracellular Ca2+ release by EGF (the process responsible for the initial phase of the [Ca2+]i and membrane potential responses) and blocked the persistent, second phase [Ca2+]i and the hyperpolarization responses, both dependent on Ca2+ influx, as well as the depolarization in the charybdotoxin-pretreated cells. Long term (up to 2-day) treatment with either charybdotoxin or SC38249 failed to affect the viability and growth of unstimulated EGFR-T17 cells. Moreover, in these cells, the ionic responses to EGF were restored after a 30-min incubation in fresh medium. In contrast, growth stimulated by EGF was inhibited, moderately (-20%) by charybdotoxin and markedly (-60%) by SC38249. These results indicate for the first time that both hyperpolarization and, especially, the persistent increase of [Ca2+]i sustained by Ca2+ influx play a role in the activity of EGF, ultimately cooperating with other intracellular events in mitogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1614920509,"The high affinity binding site for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope glycoprotein gp120 resides within the amino-terminal domain (D1) of CD4. Mutational and antibody epitope analyses have implicated the region encompassing residues 40-60 in D1 as the primary binding site for gp120. Outside of this region, a single residue substitution at position 87 abrogates syncytium formation without affecting gp120 binding. We describe two groups of CD4 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) which recognize distinct epitopes associated with these regions in D1. These mAbs distinguish between the gp120 binding event and virus infection and virus-induced cell fusion. One cluster of mAbs, which bind at or near the high affinity gp120 binding site, blocked gp120 binding to CD4 and, as expected, also blocked HIV infection of CD4+ cells and virus-induced syncytium formation. A second cluster of mAbs, which recognize the CDR-3 like loop, did not block gp120 binding as demonstrated by their ability to form ternary complexes with CD4 and gp120. Yet, these mAbs strongly inhibited HIV infection of CD4+ cells and HIV-envelope/CD4-mediated syncytium formation. The structure of D1 has recently been solved at atomic resolution and in its general features resembles IgVk regions as predicted from sequence homology and mAb epitopes. In the D1 structure, the regions recognized by these two groups of antibodies correspond to the C'C (Ig CDR2) and FG (Ig CDR3) hairpin loops, respectively, which are solvent-exposed beta turns protruding in two different directions on a face of D1 distal to the D2 domain. This face is straddled by the longer BC (Ig CDR1) loop which bisects the plain formed by C'C'' and FG. This structure is consistent with C'C'' and FG forming two distinct epitope clusters within D1. We conclude that the initial interaction between gp120 and CD4 is not sufficient for HIV infection and syncytium formation and that CD4 plays a critical role in the subsequent virus-cell and cell-cell membrane fusion events. We propose that the initial binding of CD4 to gp120 induces conformational changes in gp120 leading to subsequent interactions of the FG loop with other regions in gp120 or with the fusogenic gp41 potion of the envelope gp160 glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1497923683,"The Ca2(+)-ATPase found in the light fraction of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles can be phosphorylated by Pi, forming an acylphosphate residue at the catalytic site of the enzyme. This reaction was inhibited by the phenothiazines trifluoperazine, chlorpromazine, imipramine, and fluphenazine and by the beta-adrenergic blocking agents propranolol and alprenolol. The inhibition was reversed by raising either the Pi or the Mg2+ concentration in the medium and was not affected by the presence of K+. Phosphorylation of the Ca2(+)-ATPase by Pi was also inhibited by ruthenium red and spermidine. These compounds compete with Mg2+, but, unlike the phenothiazines, they did not compete with Pi at the catalytic site, and the inhibition was abolished when K+ was included in the assay medium. The efflux of Ca2+ from loaded vesicles was greatly increased by the phenothiazines and by propranolol and alprenolol. In the presence of 200 microM trifluoperazine, the rate of Ca2+ efflux was higher than 3 mumol of Ca2+/mg of protein/10 s. The activation of efflux by these drugs was antagonized by Pi, Mg2+, K+, Ca2+, ADP, dimethyl sulfoxide, ruthenium red, and spermidine. The increase of Ca2+ efflux caused by trifluoperazine was not correlated with binding of the drug to the membrane lipids. It is concluded that the Ca2+ pump can be uncoupled by different drugs, thereby greatly increasing the efflux of Ca2+ through the ATPase. Displacement of these drugs by the natural ligands of the ATPase blocks the efflux through the uncoupled pathway and limits it to a much smaller rate. Thus, the Ca2(+)-ATPase can operate either as a pump (coupled) or as a Ca2+ channel (uncoupled)."
https://openalex.org/W1491677380,"BC-1 RNA is a small RNA transcript of the identifier repetitive sequences present in rodent genomes. The RNA has been reported to be specific to the brain and confined to the cytoplasm. The RNA level increases during the 1st month after birth. To understand its cytoplasmic function, it seems important to examine whether BC-1 RNA is present as an RNP. It is believed that the protein component may govern the functions of BC-1 RNA in the brain cells. In the present report, we have demonstrated that BC-1 RNA is not free but complexed with proteins to form a 10 S RNP in the cytoplasm. We have also shown that the 10 S RNP is not associated with cytoplasmic structures such as polysomes/ribosomes or microsomes. The buoyant density of the RNP was 1.26 g/cm3 in metrizamide. Furthermore, some of the protein components were shown to be in direct contact with RNA, since photo-cross-linking adducts of protein to BC-1 RNA were identified upon UV irradiation of the 10 S BC-1 RNP."
https://openalex.org/W1601120722,"Nine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against apoA-I reacting with distinct but overlapping epitopes covering more than 90% of the sequence have been used to block the interaction of 125I-labeled high density lipoprotein (125I-HDL) with HepG2 cells in order to delineate the cell binding domain of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I). While 2 mAbs reacting with epitopes exclusively localized in the N-terminal region (residues 1 to 86) enhanced slightly association of 125I-HDL, all other mAbs, which react with epitopes localized in the regions of amphipathic alpha-helical repeats, inhibited that association by 9 to 15%. Although this inhibition is not significant compared to the effect of an irrelevant mAb, combination of these mAbs could significantly inhibit the association of 125I-HDL (32 to 43%) as could polyclonal antibodies (up to 95%). These results are compatible with the concept of HDL binding to these cells via the nonexclusive interaction of each of the amphipathic alpha-helical repeats of apoA-I. When the same approach was applied to block the association of 3H-cholesteryl ether (CE)-labeled HDL to HepG2 cells, each anti-apoA-I could inhibit by 15 to 25% the cellular association of cholesteryl ether while mAbs in combination or polyclonal antibodies could inhibit this association up to 45% or 60%, respectively. The cholesteryl ether radioactivity that remained associated with the cells (40%) in the presence of polyclonal antibodies could be effectively blocked by addition of an antibody against the receptor binding domain of apoE (1D7). Therefore, the differential cellular association of cholesteryl ether compared to apolipoprotein can be explained by the presence of apoE secreted by HepG2 and apoE or apoB/E receptors. Thus, we conclude that the optimum uptake of both cholesteryl ether and apoA-I of HDL by cells requires the accessibility of the entire apoA-I and the cooperative binding of the amphipathic alpha-helical repeats to HepG2 cell membranes. This type of interaction would explain the competitive binding observed for apoA-I, -A-II, and -A-IV by others."
https://openalex.org/W1516205729,"RNase P, an endoribonuclease responsible for generating the mature 5' termini of tRNA precursors, is composed of both RNA and protein. It has been demonstrated that the eubacterial RNase P RNA will, under the appropriate reaction conditions, exhibit catalytic activity in vitro. Evidence has not been obtained for catalytic activity by the RNAs of eukaryotic RNase P enzymes. Using a cDNA probe prepared from RNA copurifying with RNase P activity from the archaebacterium Haloferax volcanii, we have characterized the gene encoding the RNase P RNA. The proposed transcript from this gene can assume a structure resembling the eubacterial RNase P RNA and includes many of the highly conserved sequences of these RNAs. This RNA was incapable of cleaving pre-tRNA substrates in the absence of protein under a variety of in vitro conditions. Catalytic activity was observed when this RNA was combined with the protein subunit of the Bacillus subtilis RNase P complex. Similarities among the archaebacterial, eubacterial, and eukaryotic RNase P RNA sequences and structures are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1532249206,"The primary structure of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase from the marine diatom Cylindrotheca sp. strain N1 has been determined. Unlike higher plants and green algae, the genes encoding the large and the small subunits of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase are chloroplast-encoded and closely associated (Hwang and Tabita, 1989). The rbcL and rbcS genes in strain N1 are cotranscribed and are separated by an intergenic region of 46 nucleotide base pairs. Ribosome binding sites and a potential promoter sequence were highly homologous to previously determined chloroplast sequences. Comparison of the deduced primary structure of the diatom large and small subunits indicated significant homology to previously determined sequences from bacteria; there was much less homology to large and small subunits from cyanobacteria, green algae, and higher plants. Although high levels of recombinant diatom large subunits could be expressed in Escherichia coli, the protein synthesized was primarily insoluble and incapable of forming an active hexadecameric enzyme. Edman degradation studies indicated that the amino terminus of the large subunit isolated from strain N1 was blocked, suggesting that the mechanism responsible for processing and subsequent assembly of large and small subunits resembles the situation found with other eucaryotic ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase proteins, despite the distinctive procaryotic gene arrangement and sequence homology."

https://openalex.org/W1544807579,"We used the expression of chimeric proteins and point mutants to identify amino acids of the hepatic progesterone 21-hydroxylase P450IIC5 which are part of an epitope recognized by an inhibitory monoclonal antibody and which affect substrate binding. Three amino acids of P450IIC5 at positions 113, 115, and 118 were introduced into P450IIC4, which is 95% identical to P450IIC5. The resultant chimeric protein acquired binding of the monoclonal antibody 1F11, which is highly specific and inhibitory for P450IIC5. Point mutants in P450IIC4 showed that two of the three changes, T115S and N118K, contribute to the epitope recognized by this antibody. The T115S mutant bound the antibody weakly (Kd greater than 30 nM) whereas the N118K mutant bound the antibody as tightly as P450IIC5 (Kd less than or equal to 0.7 nM). Thus, residues 115 and 118 are located on the surface of these enzymes, and the Lys/Asn difference at amino acid 118 is largely responsible for the high degree of discrimination which this antibody exhibits between P450IIC5 and P450IIC4. The valine to alanine mutation at position 113 conferred to P450IIC4 a lower apparent Km for progesterone 21-hydroxylation. Because antibody binding was not affected by this mutation, it is tempting to speculate that this residue is buried in the protein where it exerts its effect on the catalytic activity by interaction with the substrate or alters the positions of residues of the active site. The close proximity of the epitope at positions 115 and 118 to Ala113 suggests that the inhibitory monoclonal antibody interferes with substrate binding."
https://openalex.org/W1555461214,"Abstract Secretion of chloride ions via apically located anion-selective channels in epithelia regulates fluid formation and cytosolic Cl- homeostasis. In order to understand the biochemical basis of Cl- channel function, we attempted to isolate this transporter from bovine tracheal apical membranes. Initially, peripheral polypeptides were removed from apically enriched vesicles by washing with alkaline buffer (pH 10.8) containing 2 mM CHAPS. The resulting pellet contained 50-60% of the original protein and displayed 2-fold enhanced Cl- channel activity compared to untreated vesicles. The pellet was treated with Triton X-100, and the solubilized proteins were separated on the cationic exchanger CM-cellufine. Washing the resin with a pH 8.0-8.3 buffer eluted a fraction with enriched Cl- channel activity. This fraction contained less than 5% of the total solubilized protein. A subsequent separation was performed using the anionic exchanger AM-cellufine. The highest activity was found in the fractions eluted by 80-120 mM KCl. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis showed a major 38,000-Da protein band. This band was electroeluted from the gel under nondenaturing and nonreducing conditions and reconstituted into phosphatidylcholine liposomes. KCl-loaded vesicles containing the purified 38-kDa protein transported up to 5 nmol of 125I-/mg of protein/5 min. This value was 15-fold higher than the uptake measured in vesicles reconstituted with total solubilized membrane proteins and 4-fold higher compared to the CM-cellufine-enriched fraction. The observed 125I- uptake was 90% inhibited by 100 microM 4,4-bis(isothiocyano)-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonate or 10 microM valinomycin. In summary, we have developed a biochemical protocol for the isolation of a 38 kDa protein mediating potential-dependent and 4,4-bis(isothiocyano)-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonate-sensitive Cl- channel activity."
https://openalex.org/W1539938614,"The endocytic compartment in the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum was labeled by feeding fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate-dextran. In homogenates containing 2 mM Mg2+, the compartments so labeled copurified with all of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase activity in a dense peak. The fluorescence properties of the probe showed that these dense vacuoles were inherently acidic. Furthermore, after purging their residual acidity, they could be re-acidified by the addition of ATP. These data suggest that the H(+)-ATPase was structurally and functionally coupled to the endocytic space. The association of the H(+)-ATPase and endocytic compartment was reversed by the removal of either Mg2+ or traces of the cytosol. Endocytic vacuoles prepared in this way were deficient in vacuolar H(+)-ATPase activity and were not acidified upon addition of MgATP. The missing proton pumps were recovered in large buoyant vacuoles that lacked ingested fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate-dextran, acid hydrolases, and residual acidity. These vacuoles were also less susceptible than endosomes to disruption by digitonin, suggesting that their bilayers were low in sterols. These results indicate that the endocytic circuit in Dictyostelium is acidified by a discrete and separable proton-pumping organelle."
https://openalex.org/W1546592775,"Abstract Argininosuccinic aciduria is an inborn error of metabolism due to the genetic deficiency of argininosuccinate lyase. In order to determine the molecular basis for the disease, RNA isolated from cultured skin fibroblasts derived from four unrelated patients was reverse-transcribed and amplified using the polymerase chain reaction and the products were cloned and sequenced. Three single base missense mutations were identified: Arg111----Trp, Gln286----Arg, and Arg193----Gln. One single base amber mutation was identified at Gln454. One mutation involved a 13-base pair deletion within exon 13, and it was noted that the majority of the mature RNA derived from this allele was deleted for the entire exon rather than containing the exon with the 13 bases deleted. A final mutation was observed in which exon 2 was deleted from the mature RNA. The molecular basis for this deletion was not determined. Of the eight potential mutations present in the four cell lines studied, six mutations were identified and further data indicate that the remaining two unidentified mutations were different from those identified. Two site-directed mutations were created in the cDNA, Lys51----Asn and His89----Gln, and these were expressed in yeast. The Lys51 mutation caused an approximate 2-fold reduction in activity and the His89 mutation resulted in an approximate 10-fold reduction in activity. The combination of determination of naturally occurring mutations and the study of the effect of site-directed mutations on the activity of argininosuccinate lyase provide insight into the amino acid residues critical to the function of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1547249831,"The intestinal epithelium establishes and maintains a precise spatial organization despite its continuous and rapid renewal. We have used transgenic mice containing liver fatty acid-binding protein/human growth hormone (L-FABP/hGH) fusion genes to begin to define the molecular mechanisms which are responsible for appropriate regional and cell-specific expression of genes in the gut. Multilabel immunocytochemical methods were employed to characterize the patterns of expression of two transgenes in the enteroendocrine and enterocytic populations of late gestation fetal mice at the time of initial cytodifferentiation of the gastrointestinal epithelium (fetal days 16-19). Surveys of the enteroendocrine cell population using a panel of antibodies directed against 11 neuroendocrine products revealed that these cells are scarce prior to fetal day 17, show a progressive increase in number through day 19, and while the relative proportion of subpopulations (defined by their principal peptide product) are somewhat different than in adults, their geographic distribution along the duodenal to colonic and intervillus(crypt) to villus axes are very similar to that encountered in adult (2-5 month old) mice. Immunoreactive L-FABP is first detectable at fetal day 17 and at this time of first appearance shows an adult pattern of regional enterocytic expression: i.e. it is present in cells overlying nascent villi but not those in the intervillus zone, it is highest in proximal small bowel, declines distally, and is absent from colonocytes. Colocalization studies indicate that L-FABP is not present in enteroendocrine cells during fetal life. Mapping studies indicate that nucleotides -596 to +21 of the rat L-FABP gene are sufficient to reproduce an appropriate temporal, cellular, and regional pattern of reporter (hGH) expression in fetal transgenic mice (with the exception that a subset(s) of enteroendocrine cells, typically containing immunoreactive gastric inhibitory peptide, support transgene but not L-FABP expression). This is in marked contrast to adult transgenic mice where inappropriate hGH accumulation occurs in crypt-associated epithelial cells, in colonocytes, and in many enteroendocrine populations. These studies indicate the importance of considering developmental stage when interpreting the results of any mapping study of cis-acting elements that regulate cell-specific and regional expression of genes in the perpetually renewing intestinal epithelium. Moreover, they also raise the possibility of using transgenes to define fundamental temporal changes in the gut's epithelial cell populations."

https://openalex.org/W2154465748,"Phosphotyrosine and similar analogs have been used to elicit antibodies that have found widespread use in the study of cellular tyrosine phosphorylation. In order to better understand the anti-phosphotyrosine immune response and to elucidate the details of the specific association between a tyrosine phosphate and an antibody combining site, we have undertaken a detailed comparison of antibody stability, specificity, apparent affinity, and primary structure for eight different anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies derived from immunizations with three different antigens. Two of these, 2G8 and 1G2, were derived from an immunization using azobenzylphosphonate conjugated to carrier, and five others, Py2, Py20, Py42, Py54, and Py69, were the products of an immunization with phosphotyrosine conjugated to carrier. Each of these anti-hapten antibodies was an IgG. One antibody, 129, an IgM, was the result of an immunization with a mixture of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins which had been purified from growth factor treated cells. We found that antibody binding was significantly inhibited by millimolar levels of divalent cations or high concentrations of monovalent salt, with the exception of the antibody 129 where binding was significantly enhanced by both. Under optimal conditions, the highest apparent affinities for phosphotyrosine were observed for antibodies Py69 and Py20 (10(-6)-10(-7) M) and the lowest for 129 and 1G2 (10(-3)-10(-4). The heavy and light chain variable regions of seven of these antibodies were cloned and sequenced and a predominant anti-phosphotyrosine response was observed. The light chains of these antibodies could be assigned to one of two major VK groups, VK10 and VK19, with sequence identity between the different light chains of each class ranging from 65 to 100% at the amino acid level. Similar sequence identity was found among the heavy chain sequences (89-98% identity at the amino acid level) with the exception of one antibody, 2G8, which was only distantly related to the others (61-64% amino acid identity). These heavy chains belong to the same heavy chain family, J558. Two of the antibodies, Py20 and Py69, were clearly derived from the same progenitor cell since both share a highly unusual apparent V-D-D-JH organization. However, a significant level of somatic mutation has occurred between the two antibodies resulting in subtle changes in their apparent affinity and specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1533898932,"Eight neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against the human interferon gamma (HuIFN-gamma) that were classified in the E1 epitope group were mapped by the synthetic peptide approach. A set of 136 octapeptide homologs of the 143-residue primary sequence of the HuIFN-gamma, each one with a 7-residue sequence overlap with successive peptide, was synthesized. Based on the similar reactivity patterns of all the mAbs with this set of synthetic peptides, the E1 functional epitope was localized to residues 84-94 on the HuIFN-gamma. The epitope sequence is: Ser-Asn-Lys-Lys-Lys-Arg-Asp-Asp-Phe-Gln-Lys. The fact that eight independently isolated mAbs binding to the same domain can neutralize the HuIFN-gamma activity suggests that the E1 domain must be at or adjacent to a functional site. Within this domain is a sequence element, Lys-Lys-Lys-Arg, that resembles the nuclear location signals known to effect the intracellular transportation of a number of nuclear proteins, such as the large tumor antigen (T antigen) of simian virus 40 (SV40) and polyoma virus and steroid hormone receptors. This observation suggests that the HuIFN-gamma molecule and/or its complex with the receptor must function in the nucleus to effect transcription regulation that results in the various biological activities. The signal for that intracellular transportation must be provided by the HuIFN-gamma molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1481896971,"The effect of actinomycin on the structure of DNA fragments containing the sequences (AT)5GC(AT)5, (TA)5GC(TA)5, A9GCT9, and T9GCA9, cloned into the SmaI site of pUC19, has been studied by footprinting analysis using a variety of probes known to be sensitive to DNA structure. In each case clear footprints are found around the central GC sites. DNase I cleavage of fragments containing alternating AT shows much greater cutting at ApT than TpA; in the presence of actinomycin, although this preference is retained, there is a large increase in the cutting efficiency at the closest TpA steps. DNase I cleavage in homopolymeric regions of A and T, which is normally very poor, is greatly enhanced by drug binding. With T9GCA9 the enhancements are propagated in both directions, whereas changes are only found to the 5'-side of the GC site in A9GCT9. The results are confirmed by similar experiments with micrococcal nuclease and DNase II. Small increases in sensitivity to diethylpyrocarbonate are found at adenines proximal to GC. Experiments performed at 4 degrees C suggest that conformational changes are a necessary consequence of drug binding."
https://openalex.org/W1496120684,"RNase L activated by 2-5A (a series of 2‘-5‘-linked adenylic oligoribonucleotides) is a key enzyme of the interferon system. To study RNase L (endonuclease L) in intact cells independently of intracellular 2-5A and of its activity, we have developed polyclonal antibodies against RNase L. RNase L from mouse spleen was purified on a column of 2-5A-Sepharose and used to immunize rabbits in co-injection with polyadenylic-polyuridylic acid as adjuvant. Antibodies were purified by chromatography on Affi-Gel blue and 2-5A-Sepharose-immobilized RNase L. These polyclonal antibodies immunoprecipitate the 80- and 40-kDa forms of RNase L in mouse spleen. In Western blot, only the 80-kDa form of RNase L is recognized by these antibodies. These purified antibodies were used to localize RNase L in the cytoplasm of intact mouse NIH 3T3 cells by immunofluorescence. The cytoplasmic localization of RNase L was confirmed by its 2-5A binding activity after cellular fractionation."
https://openalex.org/W1564069694,"A repetitive mammalian genetic element, HSAG-1, has been shown to promote the amplification of the vector, pSV2-DHFR, containing the functional cDNA for dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). LR-73 cells, a line of Chinese hamster ovary cells, were transfected with this recombinant construct or with the parent vector, then subjected to culture in selective medium containing steadily increasing concentrations of methotrexate, a drug which specifically inhibits DHFR. Cultures transfected with the HSAG-1-containing construct acquired drug resistance faster than those transfected with the parent vector. This acceleration of acquisition of drug resistance was due to an increased probability of the generation and subsequent selection of cellular variants with increased copy numbers of the vector. The effect has also been observed in CHO(DHFR-) and HeLa cell lines. Possible mechanisms for the effect of the HSAG-1 element on gene amplification are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1585420004,"The histone H4t gene is actively transcribed in rat testis germinal cells and in several non-testis cell types including cells from liver. This histone H4 gene is expressed most actively in testis premeiotic pachytene spermatocytes, and its expression is down-regulated in postmeiotic early spermatids. The histone H4 gene promoter is functional as demonstrated by finding significant levels of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) mRNA in mammalian cells transiently transfected with a histone H4-promoted CAT expression vector compared to cells transfected with an expression vector lacking of the promoter. Examination of the proximal promoter of the histone H4 gene by electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicates that specific protein-DNA interactions occur when pachytene spermatocyte nuclear proteins are mixed with promoter fragments containing regions designated site I and site II, consensus sequence elements essential for regulating transcription of the histone H4 gene. These specific protein-DNA interactions are eliminated by competition with identical DNA fragments, but are not eliminated by competition with nonhomologous DNA fragments. Significant differences are found in mobility shift patterns upon comparison of nuclear proteins from germinal cell populations enriched in pachytene spermatocytes where the gene is actively expressed and early spermatids where the gene is not expressed."
https://openalex.org/W1550074093,"A photoaffinity analog of 4-hydroxycoumarin containing an azidobenzyl group at the 3-position and, if desired, carbon-14 or tritium radionuclides has been synthesized and characterized. This compound, 3-(p-azidobenzyl)-4-hydroxycoumarin, serves as an effective competitive inhibitor of the dicoumarol-sensitive NAD(P)H:quinone reductase (EC 1.6.99.2; DT-diaphorase) from rat liver, having an apparent inhibition constant of 6.6 x 10(-8) M, a value comparable to that observed for dicoumarol (1.7 x 10(-9) M), significantly lower than for Warfarin (3.5 x 10(-5) M) and well within the range required of an effective photoaffinity reagent. Irradiation of the reductase with ultraviolet light in the presence of the photoprobe resulted in the covalent labeling of up to 10% of the protein. Greater than 99% of the covalent incorporation is precluded by the addition of 15 microM dicoumarol, consistent with the specific labeling of the 4-hydroxycoumarin binding site of this enzyme by this photoaffinity reagent. Further evidence of a high degree of specificity is provided by the isolation and sequence analysis of the peptides covalently modified by this reagent. A single region within the protein was found to be labeled, with threonine 127 and tyrosine 128 being the only amino acid residues that were observed to be modified. These results, for the first time, define a portion of the 4-hydroxycoumarin binding site within a protein that has a well established sensitivity to this type of anticoagulant and, because dicoumarol serves as a competitive inhibitor for pyridine nucleotides in this enzyme, may also define a portion of this unusual pyridine nucleotide binding site. In addition, these results suggest that this reagent may be effective as a highly specific photoaffinity probe in the identification of other proteins that are similarly inhibited by 4-hydroxycoumarin derivatives, such as the microsomal enzymes associated with the vitamin K-dependent carboxylation system."
https://openalex.org/W1480328728,"This study describes a combined immunochemical and genetic approach defining a site on Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (ETA) which is critical to the ADP-ribosyltransferase (ADPRT) activity of the toxin. The sequential epitope of a monoclonal antibody (TO-1) which binds to domain III (residues 405-613), containing the ADPRT activity of ETA, has been defined using a series of synthetic peptides. This epitope spans residues 422-432 which composes the major alpha-helical segment of domain III and includes His426 which has previously been shown to be essential for ADPRT activity (Wozniak, D.J., Hsu, L.-Y., and Galloway, D. R. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85, 8880-8884). The critical His426 residue which projects into a major cleft becomes exposed when the ETA protein is in an ADPRT-active configuration. Since the TC-1 mAb does not block the binding of NAD+, it is possible that the alpha-helix site containing the TC-1 epitope and the His426 residue is associated with the interaction between ETA and its elongation factor 2 substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1564569113,"In this paper, we examine the regulation of vimentin expression during interleukin 2-induced proliferation of the cloned helper T cell line, L2. We observe a 10-20-fold increase in steady-state vimentin RNA that is accompanied by a 14-fold increase in the rate of vimentin protein synthesis. This indicates that translation is occurring, and thus that vimentin expression is regulated, at least in part, at the level of transcription and/or RNA stability, rather than at the level of protein synthesis. In contrast to the increases in steady-state vimentin RNA and the rate of protein synthesis, steady-state vimentin protein levels increase maximally only 1.3-3-fold in proliferating L2 cells. The rate of vimentin protein turnover remains relatively constant throughout L2 cell activation, active proliferation, and return to quiescence, indicating that an increased rate of turnover does not account for the minimal increase in vimentin content. These observations are consistent with a transient increase in vimentin protein synthesis necessary to support L2 cell growth and/or vimentin network reorganization. Because cell division occurs before an equilibrium state is reached, the maximal increase in steady-state vimentin protein content is never attained."

The symposium was sponsored jointly by The American Association of Immunologists, the Clinical Immunology Society, and and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and was titled ""The Contributions of Basic Immunology to Human Health."" Five speakers, whose research has clear relevance to the treatment and prevention of major human diseases, discussed topics of great current interest: hematopoietic stem cells, cell adhesion and lymphocyte homing; the complexities of autoimmunity and approaches to diverting or depressing autoaggressive immunity; structure and functions of the interferons and the construction of designer and chimeric interferons; the varied functions of transforming growth factors and molecular events that regulate the synthesis of TGF beta; and the roles of cytokines in the expression of human immunodeficiency virus and the prospects for controlling HIV infections by regulating selected cytokines. This symposium will be remembered for the exceptional clarity with which each speaker illustrated how fundamental knowledge in immunology fuels advances in the treatment and prevention of those human disorders that involve the immune system."
