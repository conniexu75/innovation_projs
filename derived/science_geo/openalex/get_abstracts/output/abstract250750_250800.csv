https://openalex.org/W2109879418,"TRPA1 is an excitatory ion channel targeted by pungent irritants from mustard and garlic. TRPA1 has been proposed to function in diverse sensory processes, including thermal (cold) nociception, hearing, and inflammatory pain. Using TRPA1-deficient mice, we now show that this channel is the sole target through which mustard oil and garlic activate primary afferent nociceptors to produce inflammatory pain. TRPA1 is also targeted by environmental irritants, such as acrolein, that account for toxic and inflammatory actions of tear gas, vehicle exhaust, and metabolic byproducts of chemotherapeutic agents. TRPA1-deficient mice display normal cold sensitivity and unimpaired auditory function, suggesting that this channel is not required for the initial detection of noxious cold or sound. However, TRPA1-deficient mice exhibit pronounced deficits in bradykinin-evoked nociceptor excitation and pain hypersensitivity. Thus, TRPA1 is an important component of the transduction machinery through which environmental irritants and endogenous proalgesic agents depolarize nociceptors to elicit inflammatory pain."

The libraries currently contain 104,000 vectors, targeting each of 22,000 human and mouse genes with multiple sequence-verified constructs. To test the utility of the library for arrayed screens, we developed a screen based on high-content imaging to identify genes required for mitotic progression in human cancer cells and applied it to an arrayed set of 5,000 unique shRNA-expressing lentiviruses that target 1,028 human genes. The screen identified several known and approximately 100 candidate regulators of mitotic progression and proliferation; the availability of multiple shRNAs targeting the same gene facilitated functional validation of putative hits. This work provides a widely applicable resource for loss-of-function screens, as well as a roadmap for its application to biological discovery."

While the number of verified human miRNAs is still expanding, only few have been functionally annotated. To perform genetic screens for novel functions of miRNAs, we developed a library of vectors expressing the majority of cloned human miRNAs and created corresponding DNA barcode arrays. In a screen for miRNAs that cooperate with oncogenes in cellular transformation, we identified miR-372 and miR-373, each permitting proliferation and tumorigenesis of primary human cells that harbor both oncogenic RAS and active wild-type p53. These miRNAs neutralize p53-mediated CDK inhibition, possibly through direct inhibition of the expression of the tumor-suppressor LATS2. We provide evidence that these miRNAs are potential novel oncogenes participating in the development of human testicular germ cell tumors by numbing the p53 pathway, thus allowing tumorigenic growth in the presence of wild-type p53.

Since their discovery, the functions of only a handful of microRNAs (miRNAs) have been determined (recently reviewed in Zamore and Haley, 2005Zamore P.D. Haley B. Ribo-gnome: the big world of small RNAs.Science. 2005; 309: 1519-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). Relevant to carcinogenesis, it was found that let-7 inhibits RAS expression and in lung tumors negatively correlates with RAS levels (Johnson et al., 2005Johnson S.M. Grosshans H. Shingara J. Byrom M. Jarvis R. Cheng A. Labourier E. Reinert K.L. Brown D. Slack F.J. RAS is regulated by the let-7 microRNA family.Cell. 2005; 120: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2984) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the oncogenic potential of the miR-17-92 cluster was demonstrated (He et al., 2005He L. Thomson J.M. Hemann M.T. Hernando-Monge E. Mu D. Goodson S. Powers S. Cordon-Cardo C. Lowe S.W.

This cluster is amplified in lymphomas (Ota et al., 2004Ota A. Tagawa H. Karnan S. Tsuzuki S. Karpas A. Kira S. Yoshida Y. Seto M.

These findings demonstrate the powerful ability of small RNAs to alter cellular pathways and programs. However, the small number of miRNAs with a known function stresses the need for a systematic screening approach to identify more miRNA functions. The difficulties in deciphering the mechanism of action of miRNAs with a known function and deducing their activity from their sequence are largely due to the complex relationship with their target genes. In general, target genes containing sequences that are completely complementary to the miRNA will be degraded by an RNA-interference mechanism, whereas targets with partial complementary sequences at their 3′UTR will be subjected to translation inhibition and to a lesser extent also to mRNA degradation (Doench and Sharp, 2004Doench J.G.

In mammals, a near-perfect complementarity between miRNAs and protein coding genes almost never exists, making it difficult to directly pinpoint relevant downstream targets of a miRNA. Several algorithms were developed that predict miRNA targets, most notably TargetScanS, PicTar, and miRanda (John et al., 2004John B. Enright A.J. Aravin A. Tuschl T. Sander C. Marks D.S.

Li Y. Padgett R.W. Incorporating structure to predict microRNA targets.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 4006-4009Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These programs predict dozens to hundreds of target genes per miRNA, making it difficult to directly infer the cellular pathways affected by a given miRNA. Furthermore, the biological effect of the downregulation depends greatly on the cellular context, which exemplifies the need to deduce miRNA functions by in vivo genetic screens in well-defined model systems. The cancerous process can be modeled by in vitro neoplastic transformation assays in primary human cells (Hahn et al., 1999Hahn W.C. Counter C.M. Lundberg A.S. Beijersbergen R.L. Brooks M.W. Weinberg R.A. Creation of human tumour cells with defined genetic elements.Nature. 1999; 400: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar). Using this system, sets of genetic elements required for transformation were identified. For example, the joint expression of the telomerase reverse transcriptase subunit (hTERT), oncogenic H-RASV12, and SV40-small t antigen combined with the suppression of p53 and p16INK4A were sufficient to render primary human fibroblasts tumorigenic (Voorhoeve and Agami, 2003Voorhoeve P.M. Agami R. The tumor-suppressive functions of the human INK4A locus.Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 311-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Recently, these neoplastic transformation assays were used to uncover novel human tumor suppressor genes (Kolfschoten et al., 2005Kolfschoten I.G. van Leeuwen B. Berns K. Mullenders J. Beijersbergen R.L. Bernards R. Voorhoeve P.M. Agami R.

Moreover, oncogenes such as H-RASV12 provoke a stress response in primary cells that results in an irreversible growth arrest, termed premature senescence (Serrano et al., 1997Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Oncogenic ras provokes premature cell senescence associated with accumulation of p53 and p16INK4a.Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3711) Google Scholar). The senescent phenotype was recently shown to play a role in the protection from tumor development in vivo (Braig et al., 2005Braig M. Lee S. Loddenkemper C. Rudolph C. Peters A.H. Schlegelberger B.

BRAFE600-associated senescence-like cell cycle arrest of human naevi.Nature. 2005; 436: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar). The elimination of this protective mechanism by, for example, the suppression of the p53 and p16INK4A pathways permits continued proliferation of the modified primary cells in the presence of the oncogenic event, consequently leading to tumorigenicity (Voorhoeve and Agami, 2003Voorhoeve P.M. Agami R. The tumor-suppressive functions of the human INK4A locus.Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 311-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Here, we use this model system to perform a functional genetic screen to identify miRNAs that act as oncogenes in tumorigenesis. We characterize two miRNAs whose expression can substitute for the loss of wild-type (wt) p53 that is needed to overcome oncogene-mediated arrest and implicate their involvement in the formation of testicular germ cell tumors. To identify novel functions of miRNAs, we constructed a retroviral vector for miRNA expression (miR-Vec) following a previously described approach (Chen et al., 2004Chen C.Z. Li L. Lodish H.F. Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs modulate hematopoietic lineage differentiation.Science. 2004; 303: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2640) Google Scholar). We inserted ∼500 bp fragments spanning a given miRNA-genomic region in a modified pMSCV-Blasticidin vector such that they are placed under the control of a CMV promoter (Figure 1A). To examine miRNA expression from the miR-Vec system, a miR-24 minigene-containing virus was transduced into human cells. Expression was determined using an RNase protection assay (RPA) with a probe designed to identify both precursor and mature miR-24 (Figure 1B). Figure 1C shows that cells transduced with miR-Vec-24 clearly express high levels of mature miR-24, whereas little expression was detected in control-transduced cells. Furthermore, we confirmed the consistency of miRNA expression driven by miR-Vec by cloning eight miR-Vec plasmids expressing randomly chosen miRNAs. With one exception, all constructs yielded high expression levels of mature miRNAs (Figure S1). Notably, very little pre-miRNA accumulation was detected in all cases, indicating the efficient processing of the ectopically expressed miRNAs in the cells. Next, we examined the functionality of the miR-Vec system to suppress gene expression by using both GFP, tagged with a sequence complementary to miR-19, and luciferase containing either the wt 3′UTR of G6PD, a predicted miR-1 target, or control with two mutated miR-1 binding sequences (Lewis et al., 2003Lewis B.P. Shih I.H. Jones-Rhoades M.W. Bartel D.P. Burge C.B. Prediction of mammalian microRNA targets.Cell. 2003; 115: 787-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3951) Google Scholar). Using fluorescence microscopy and luciferase assays, we observed potent and specific miRNA activity expressed from each miR-Vec (Figure S2). These results demonstrate the general applicability of miR-Vec to drive functional miRNA expression. We subsequently created a human miRNA expression library (miR-Lib) by cloning almost all annotated human miRNAs into our vector (Rfam release 6) (Figure S3). Additionally, we made a corresponding microarray (miR-Array) containing all miR-Lib inserts, which allows the detection of miRNA effects on proliferation. To test the sensitivity of screens with miR-Lib and miR-Array, we transduced modified primary BJ fibroblasts expressing ecotropic receptor and immortalized with hTERT (BJ/ET) with a mixture of 197 different miR-Vecs and mixed them in a ratio of 400:1 with BJ/ET cells containing both miR-Vec-311 and a knockdown construct for p53 (p53kd) (Figure 1D). Previously, we have shown that in a period of 2 weeks BJ/ET-p53kd cells increase 4- to 5-fold in number compared with BJ/ET cells (Voorhoeve and Agami, 2003Voorhoeve P.M. Agami R. The tumor-suppressive functions of the human INK4A locus.Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 311-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In accordance, we observed an approximately 4-fold increase in miR-311 signal, indicating that our procedure is sensitive enough to detect mild growth differences (Figure 1E). In response to mitogenic signals from oncogenes such as RASV12, primary human cells undergo a growth arrest (Figure 2A) (Serrano et al., 1997Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Oncogenic ras provokes premature cell senescence associated with accumulation of p53 and p16INK4a.Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3711) Google Scholar). In contrast, primary cells lacking functional p53 efficiently overcome this arrest. This escape from oncogene-induced senescence is a prerequisite for full transformation into tumor cells. To identify miRNAs that can interfere with this process and thus might contribute to the development of tumor cells, we transduced BJ/ET fibroblasts with miR-Lib and subsequently transduced them with either RASV12 or a control vector (Figure 2B). After 2 or 3 weeks in culture, senescence-induced differences in abundance of all miR-Vecs were determined with the miR-Array. Figures 2C and S3 show that in three independent experiments the relative abundance of three miR-Vecs increased reproducibly in the RASV12-expressing population. These hits corresponded to three constructs derived from one genomic region expressing miRNAs 371, 372, 373, and 373∗ (Figure 2D). Due to the close proximity of miR-371 and miR-372 in the genome (within 0.5 kilobase), two largely overlapping constructs encoded both miRNA-371 and 372 (miR-Vec-371&2). The third construct did not overlap with miR-Vec-371&2 and encoded miRNA-373 and 373∗. Interestingly, the mature miR-373 is a homolog of miR-372, and neither shares obvious homology with either miRNA-371 or miR-373∗ (Figure 2D). This suggests that miR-372 and miR-373 caused the observed selective growth advantage. Next, we verified miRNA function in a cell-growth assay. First, we verified the expression of both miR-371 and 372 by miR-Vec-371&2 and miR-373 by miR-Vec-373 (Figure 2E). We then transduced BJ/ET cells with miR-Vec-371&2, miR-Vec-373, or the controls p53kd and vector control and then with RASV12. As expected, control cells ceased proliferating in response to RASV12, whereas p53kd cells continued to proliferate (Figure 2F). The expression of either miR-371&2 or miR-373 allowed cells to continue proliferating in the presence of oncogenic stress, validating the effect observed with the miR-Array. Oncogene-induced senescence is characterized by the appearance of cells with a flat morphology that express senescence associated (SA)-β-Galactosidase. Indeed, control RASV12-arrested cells showed relatively high abundance of flat cells expressing SA-β-Galactosidase (Figures 2G and 2H). Consistent with the cell growth assay, very few cells showed senescent morphology when transduced with either miR-Vec-371&2, miR-Vec-373, or control p53kd. Altogether, these data show that transduction with either miR-Vec-371&2 or miR-Vec-373 prevents RASV12-induced growth arrest in primary human cells. The independent identification of constructs encoding two very similar miRNAs (miR-372 and miR-373) suggests that they (but not miR-371 or miR-373∗) are required to cause this phenotype. To test this, we mutated the sequences of miR-372 and miR-373. As demonstrated by RPA, miR-Vec-372mut and miR-Vec-373mut indeed failed to express miR-372 and miR-373, respectively (Figure 3A). Note that miR-Vec-372mut still expressed miR-371 to a similar extent as the original miR-Vec-371&2. We then tested these constructs in a YFP-competition assay to detect possible growth advantages conferred by the miRNAs on BJ cells in the absence or presence of RASV12 (Figure 3B). For this purpose we used a miR-Vec vector that expresses YFP instead of a blasticidin resistance marker and compared the growth rates of YFP-tagged and untagged cells within one population. Increase in time of the YFP-positive cells within the population indicates a growth advantage conferred by the additional genetic unit encoded by the YFP vector. We also generated BJ/ET cells expressing the RASV12-ERTAM chimera gene, which is only active when tamoxifen is added (De Vita et al., 2005De Vita G. Bauer L. da Costa V.M. De Felice M. Baratta M.G. De Menna M. Di Lauro R. Dose-dependent inhibition of thyroid differentiation by RAS oncogenes.Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 76-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and tranduced them with either YFP-tagged wt or mutant miR-Vec-371&2 and miR-Vec-373 constructs as well as p53kd, p14ARFkd, or control vectors. Figure 3B shows that even without activating RASV12 (no tamoxifen added), both miR-Vec-371&2 and miR-Vec-373 conferred a growth advantage to cells, although to a lesser extent than observed with p53kd or p14ARFkd. Once RASV12 was activated, the growth advantage of cells with miR-Vec-371&2 and 373 increased dramatically, indicating that these constructs allowed growth of cells in the presence of oncogenes while the rest of the population ceased to proliferate. In accordance with previously published data (Voorhoeve and Agami, 2003Voorhoeve P.M. Agami R. The tumor-suppressive functions of the human INK4A locus.Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 311-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), reducing p53, but not p14ARF expression, was sufficient to overcome the oncogenic stress. Consistent with our assumption that miR-372&3 are the active miRNAs, mutating their mature sequence abrogated their growth advantage. This shows that miR-372&3, but not miR-371 or miR-373∗, caused stimulation of proliferation and resistance to oncogenic stress. Suppression of cellular senescence is essential for tumorigenesis. We therefore examined whether the ectopic expression of miR-372/3 is sufficient to replace loss of p53 in transformation of cells. A hallmark of cellular transformation is the ability of tumor cells to grow anchorage independently in semisolid medium and as tumors in model mice (Hahn et al., 1999Hahn W.C. Counter C.M. Lundberg A.S. Beijersbergen R.L. Brooks M.W. Weinberg R.A. Creation of human tumour cells with defined genetic elements.Nature. 1999; 400: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar, Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. The hallmarks of cancer.Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20716) Google Scholar). Indeed, in a soft agar assay, modified primary human BJ/ET cells expressing hTERT, SV40-small t, RASV12, and shRNA-knockdowns for p53 and p16INK4A showed potent ability to grow in an anchorage-independent manner (Figures 3C and 3D). To mimic the expression of the complete miR-371-373 gene cluster, we made a miR-Vec expressing all miRNAs from one cluster (miR-Vec-cluster; see Figure 3A for expression). Similar to the knockdown of p53, the ability to grow in soft agar was also observed for cells containing miR-Vec-cluster, miR-Vec-371&2, or miR-Vec-373 but not miR-Vec-372mut or miR-Vec-373mut (Figures 3C and 3D). Moreover, the cells containing the miR-371-373 cluster grew efficiently as tumors in athymic nude mice (Figure 3E). These results demonstrate that miR-372&3 collaborate with RAS in transformation in a manner that resembles p53 inactivation. Importantly, our results so far indicate that the expression of miR-372&3 did not reduce the activity of RASV12, as these cells were still growing faster than normal cells and were tumorigenic, for which RAS activity is indispensable (Hahn et al., 1999Hahn W.C. Counter C.M. Lundberg A.S. Beijersbergen R.L. Brooks M.W. Weinberg R.A. Creation of human tumour cells with defined genetic elements.Nature. 1999; 400: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar, Kolfschoten et al., 2005Kolfschoten I.G. van Leeuwen B. Berns K. Mullenders J. Beijersbergen R.L. Bernards R. Voorhoeve P.M. Agami R. A genetic screen identifies PITX1 as a suppressor of RAS activity and tumorigenicity.Cell. 2005; 121: 849-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Therefore, the miRNA-mediated circumvention of the activation of p53 can in principle be obtained at a level upstream of p53, on p53 itself, or downstream. To shed more light on this aspect, we examined the effect of miR-372&3 expression on p53 activation in response to oncogenic stimulation. We used for this experiment BJ/ET cells containing p14ARFkd because, following RASV12 treatment, in those cells p53 is still activated but more clearly stabilized than in parental BJ/ET cells (Voorhoeve and Agami, 2003Voorhoeve P.M. Agami R. The tumor-suppressive functions of the human INK4A locus.Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 311-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), resulting in a sensitized system for slight alterations in p53 in response to RASV12. Figure 4A shows that following RASV12 stimulation, p53 was stabilized and activated, and its target gene, p21cip1, was induced in all cases, indicating an intact p53 pathway in these cells. Therefore, it is unlikely that the miRNAs act on a factor upstream of p53 or on p53 itself to suppress the cellular response to oncogenic RAS. Increased levels of p21cip1 inhibit CDK activity, causing cells to arrest in G1 phase (el-Deiry et al., 1993el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. WAF1, a potential mediator of p53 tumor suppression.Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7733) Google Scholar), whereas suppression of p21cip1 allows cells to grow in the presence of RASV12 (Figure S4A). To test whether p21cip1 was still functional in the miRNA-transduced cells, we examined CDK2 activity using an IP-Kinase assay (Figure 4B). In both miR-372&3-expressing cells, CDK2 remained active following RASV12 induction, whereas it was inhibited in the control cells (Figure 4B). In contrast, miR-372&3-transduced cells were still sensitive to inhibition of CDK activity by roscovitin (Figure S4B). This indicates that the presence of miR-372/3 acts as a molecular switch to make CDK2 resistant to increased levels of the cell cycle inhibitor p21cip1. Both p53 and p21cip1 play a major role in the DNA damage response to ionizing radiation (IR) (Weinert, 1998Weinert T. DNA damage and checkpoint pathways: molecular anatomy and interactions with repair.Cell. 1998; 94: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Since cells expressing miR-372&3 proliferate in the presence of increased p21cip1 levels, we examined their response to damaged DNA. In the presence of both miRNAs, and irrespective of RASV12 expression, IR induced a cell cycle arrest that was indistinguishable from control cells, whereas the suppression of p53 expression allowed, as expected, continuous DNA replication (Figure 4C and data not shown). These results indicate that although miR-372&3 confer complete protection to oncogene-induced senescence in a manner similar to p53 inactivation, the cellular response to DNA damage remains intact. Based on the above results, we hypothesized that miRNA-372&3 may participate in tumorigenesis of some tumors that retain wt p53 and are sensitive to DNA-damaging treatments. One such tumor type is the testicular germ cell tumor of adolescents and adults (TGCT), known for the presence of wt p53 in the majority of cases and known to be generally sensitive to chemotherapies as well as irradiation (Kersemaekers et al., 2002Kersemaekers A.M.

In addition, these tumors harbour an embryonic stem (ES) cell signature (Almstrup et al., 2004Almstrup K. Hoei-Hansen C.E. Wirkner U. Blake J. Schwager C. Ansorge W. Nielsen J.E. Skakkebaek N.E.

Embryonic stem cell-like features of testicular carcinoma in situ revealed by genome-wide gene expression profiling.Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4736-4743Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), which correlates with the reported ES-cell expression pattern of the miR-371-3 cluster (Suh et al., 2004Suh M.R. Lee Y. Kim J.Y. Kim S.K. Moon S.H. Lee J.Y. Cha K.Y. Chung H.M. Yoon H.S. Moon S.Y. et al.Human embryonic stem cells express a unique set of microRNAs.Dev. Biol. 2004; 270: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). We therefore examined a number of cell lines originating from TGCTs for the expression of the miR-371-3 cluster. Four out of seven cell lines expressed this cluster (Figures 4D and S5). This result is significant as no clear expression of the miR-371-3 cluster was detected in any of the somatic cell lines we tested (originating from breast, colon, lung and brain tumors) (Figure S6). TGCTs are divided into seminomas, non-seminomas, and spermatocytic-seminoma, according to their origin, clinical behavior, and chromosomal constitution (Oosterhuis and Looijenga, 2005Oosterhuis J.W. Looijenga L.H. Testicular germ-cell tumours in a broader perspective.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 210-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). The nonseminomas can be composed of embryonal carcinoma (EC, the stem cell component), teratocarcinoma (TC, somatic differentiation), and yolk sac tumor and choriocarcinoma (YS and CH, extra-embryonal tissues). All the cell lines we tested were derived from nonseminomatous tumors, as there are no other type of TGCT cell lines available so far. To substantiate our results and extend them to other TGCT types, we examined a panel of primary seminomas, nonseminomas, and spermatocytic seminomas for the expression of miR-372. Figures 4D and S7 show that most seminomas (28/32) had a clear miR-372 expression, that about two thirds (14/21) of the nonseminomas expressed miR-372, and that expression was observed in neither RNA from the spermatocytic-seminoma tumors (data not shown) nor from the normal testis tissue panel. Noteworthy is the fact that endogenous expression of miR-372 reached levels that are comparable to those driven by miR-Vec-372 (Figure 4D), indicating the biological relevance of our system in primary human fibroblast cells. Within the nonseminoma samples, both pure and mixed histologies were present (Figure S7). The RPA analysis showed that high expression of miR-372 correlated with a larger EC component. To further investigate this connection, we performed in situ miRNA hybridizations on tissue sections of 10 representative TGCTs and found in all cases 372&3 to be strictly localized to the EC component, as judged by morphology and immunohistochemistry with CD30 and Oct3/4 (Figure 4E and data not shown). Both seminomas and the EC component of nonseminomas share features with ES cells. To exclude that the detection of miR-371-3 merely reflects its expression pattern in ES cells, we tested by RPA miR-302a-d, another ES cells-specific miRNA cluster (Suh et al., 2004Suh M.R. Lee Y. Kim J.Y. Kim S.K. Moon S.H. Lee J.Y. Cha K.Y. Chung H.M. Yoon H.S. Moon S.Y. et al.Human embryonic stem cells express a unique set of microRNAs.Dev.

In many of the miR-371-3 expressing seminomas and nonseminomas, miR-302a-d was undetectable (Figures S7 and S8), suggesting that miR-371-3 expression is a selective event during tumorigenesis. Interestingly, we noted a correlation between cluster expression and p53 status in the TGCT cell lines (Figure 4F). Whereas all three cluster-expressing cell lines contained high"

We show that thermodynamically stable dispersion of nanoparticles into a polymeric liquid is enhanced for systems where the radius of gyration of the linear polymer is greater than the radius of the nanoparticle. Dispersed nanoparticles swell the linear polymer chains, resulting in a polymer radius of gyration that grows with the nanoparticle volume fraction. It is proposed that this entropically unfavorable process is offset by an enthalpy gain due to an increase in molecular contacts at dispersed nanoparticle surfaces as compared with the surfaces of phase-separated nanoparticles. Even when the dispersed state is thermodynamically stable, it may be inaccessible unless the correct processing strategy is adopted, which is particularly important for the case of fullerene dispersion into linear polymers."

Recent evidence suggests that a subset of cancer cells within some tumors, the so-called cancer stem cells, may drive the growth and metastasis of these tumors. Understanding the pathways that regulate proliferation, self-renewal, survival, and differentiation of malignant and normal stem cells may shed light on mechanisms that lead to cancer and suggest better modes of treatment. The need for cells to proliferate over the life span of an organism may place individuals at risk in the numbers game that underlies cancer. Adult stem cell lineages may have evolved to lower this risk by minimizing the chance of cells escaping the mechanisms that restrict their expansion. There is emerging evidence that some blood cell cancers and solid tumors may contain a cancer cell hierarchy reminiscent of the normal tissue in which the malignancies first arose, with a cancer stem cell producing progeny with limited replication potential (Al-Hajj et al., 2003Al-Hajj M.

For example, in tumors of the breast and brain, a minority population of cancer stem cells have the ability to self-renew, whereas the majority of cancer cells have limited or no ability to proliferate. This suggests that cancer stem cells may drive the growth and spread of the tumor. The presence of a stem cell population in a tumor has implications for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, as it is these cancer stem cells that must be targeted to achieve a cure. Failure to eliminate these self-renewing cells sets the stage for the regrowth of a tumor following cessation of chemotherapy. The ability to prospectively identify cancer stem cells will allow the investigation of key molecules and pathways that could be targeted to eliminate these malignant cells. Key steps in the progression to cancer may involve failure of normal developmental mechanisms evolved by long-lived multicellular organisms to meet the needs for renewing short-lived cell types such as those of the skin, gut, and blood. Cancers often arise in tissues such as skin, gut, and blood where constant proliferation is required to ensure a continued supply of newly differentiated cells. Replacement of the mature cells in these tissues is accomplished by a highly orchestrated process in which a relatively small population of self-renewing adult stem cells gives rise to proliferating progenitor cells (sometimes called transit-amplifying cells) that undergo limited rounds of mitotic division and then terminally differentiate, losing their ability to proliferate further (see Figure 1A) . In this hierarchical system, only the stem cells are long-lived. Indeed, although progenitor cells have some ability to replicate, their life span as proliferating cells is short, often measured in days or weeks. The remarkable longevity of tissue stem cells relies on their unique ability to undergo self-renewing mitotic divisions in which one or both progeny retain the stem cell identity and the capacity to replicate almost indefinitely. The daughters of stem cell divisions also have the option to follow a differentiation pathway. The balance between self-renewal and differentiation must be strictly regulated to maintain the stem cell pool and to generate the required supply of fully differentiated cells needed for tissues to carry out their many tasks. Stem cells in adult tissues must produce large numbers of differentiated progeny. These transit-amplifying progenitor cells may undergo a limited series of mitotic cycles, sometimes referred to as transit-amplifying cell divisions, before entering a postmitotic fully differentiated state (see Figure 1A). In this way, the activity of a relatively small number of stem cells can be amplified to produce large numbers of differentiated progeny. For example, in the male germline or the bone marrow (both of which contain well-studied stem cell populations), a relatively small number of germline or hematopoietic stem cells produce billions of sperm or mature blood cells over the life of the individual. The evolution of single-cell organisms into multicellular animals with their specialized cell types and complex organ systems necessitated development of strict controls to keep cellular proliferation in check. If any cells in the tissue community shake loose from these constraints on proliferation, then the resulting tumor can kill the individual organism. Long-lived multicellular organisms have evolved many fail-safe mechanisms to protect them against developing cancer. As a result, progression to cancer requires that a number of mutations accumulate in the same cell lineage in order to collectively circumvent these protective mechanisms. For example, progression to cancer may involve loss of normal growth controls leading to the formation of polyps, or the inactivation of the fail-safe mechanisms that compel abnormal cells to die or that prevent cells from migrating into surrounding tissues (Fearon and Vogelstein, 1990Fearon E.R. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1990; 61: 759-767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9531) Google Scholar). However, even the requirement for a single cell to accumulate several mutations before it becomes cancerous may not be sufficient to prevent long-lived organisms from dying of cancer at a relatively young age. Avoiding cancer is essentially a numbers game. For example, trillions of cells are formed in the human body over a normal life span, and if all of the cells in the body retain the ability to divide, there would be a reasonable chance that at least one cell would accumulate sufficient mutations to become cancerous while the organism is still young. Thus, organisms have developed a strategy to limit the number of long-lived cells with self-renewal capacity. Restricted long-term renewal of short-lived cell types may reduce the chance that a single cell with proliferative capacity will accumulate the mutations required for malignant transformation. The counting mechanisms that normally regulate and limit the number of rounds of successive transit-amplifying cell divisions may also provide an important safeguard against cancer. Although both stem cells and transit-amplifying cells divide and produce the same end-products—a spectrum of differentiating progeny—they differ in their ability to proliferate and maintain an undifferentiated state for an extended period of time. A single hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) can regenerate the blood system of a mouse. By contrast, a transit-amplifying progenitor cell, although descended from an HSC, cannot self-renew, and so, when transplanted into a lethally irradiated host, can only contribute to the blood system for a brief period of time (Morrison and Weissman, 1994Morrison S.J. Weissman I.L. Immunity. 1994; 1: 661-673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). With each cell division, the progeny of a hematopoietic transit-amplifying cell become progressively more differentiated, with measurably reduced capacity to proliferate (see Figure 1A). This programmed decline in replication potential may help to guarantee that progenitor cells cease proliferation and terminally differentiate before they have a chance to accumulate the multiple mutations that are required for tumor formation (see Figure 1A). Normal stem cells share many properties with cancer stem cells, most notably the trait of self-renewal. To maintain tissue homeostasis, the number of daughter cells that retain stem cell identity must be strictly controlled such that differentiated cells can be generated in response to, for example, wounding while the stem cell pool is simultaneously replenished but not expanded. By blocking expansion of the stem cell pool, stem cells are prevented from forming tumors. The HSC is the best understood mammalian stem cell. Mouse genetics has shown that the regulation of HSC number is under the control of multiple genes (Morrison et al., 2002Morrison S.J. Qian D. Jerebek L. Thiel B.A. Park I.-K. Ford P.S. Kiel M.J. Schork N.J. Weissman I.L. Clarke M.F. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 635-642PubMed Google Scholar). That multiple genes restrict unlimited stem cell expansion is logical considering that unregulated expansion of self-renewing cells would lead to either hyperplasia or a frank tumor. Emerging evidence indicates that a specialized microenvironment, the stem cell niche, is one of the factors regulating normal stem cell maintenance and self-renewal. The stem cell niche controls stem cell maintenance and the crucial choice between self-renewal and the initiation of differentiation (Spradling et al., 2001Spradling A. Drummond-Barbosa D. Kai T. Nature. 2001; 414: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). Thus, stem cells appear to require paracrine signals from the cellular niche in which they reside to maintain their identity and self-renewal capacity. As a result, the number of stem cells within a particular tissue can be regulated by controlling the number or size of available niches. The best understood examples of regulation of stem cell self-renewal by the niche are to be found in the female and male germline stem cells of the fruit fly Drosophila (Yamashita et al., 2005Yamashita Y.M. Fuller M.T. Jones D.L. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In both male and female reproductive tissues, a small number of somatic support cells provides a microenvironment that maintains the germline stem cells. Indeed, the niche cells are the source of molecules that activate signal transduction pathways in the germline stem cells specifying maintenance of stem cell fate. The stem cells physically attach to the niche and, when they divide, orient their mitotic spindles with respect to the niche, so that one daughter inherits the attachment and stays in the niche, whereas the other daughter is displaced away from the niche and activates expression of genes that launch this cell along the differentiation pathway (Chen and McKearin, 2003Chen D.

Science. 2003; 301: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Additional layers of regulation may ensure that the response to the niche signal is local and that the daughter cell displaced from the niche is able to follow a developmental fate that is different from that of its sibling remaining in the niche. The mechanisms that shape the different pathways followed by the two daughter cells are not yet fully understood. However, such mechanisms may involve negative feedback loops that trigger either activation of repressors of the response to the self-renewal signal or physical isolation of the differentiating cell from the niche by enveloping guardian or escort cells (Decotto and Spradling, 2005Decotto E. Spradling A.C. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 501-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, Kiger et al., 2000Kiger A.A. White-Cooper H. Fuller M.T.

Development. 2002; 129: 4523-4534PubMed Google Scholar). In the Drosophila female germline, where the regulatory circuitry from the signal to the key target in the stem cell has been worked out, the main role of the signal from the niche is to block expression of genes that trigger the onset of differentiation (Chen and McKearin, 2003Chen D. McKearin D. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1786-1791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, Xie and Spradling, 2000Xie T. Spradling A.C. Science. 2000; 290: 328-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that cellular niches are important in preventing mammalian stem cell expansion (Calvi et al., 2003Calvi L.M. Adams G.B. Weibrecht K.W. Weber J.M. Olson D.P. Knight M.C. Martin R.P. Schipani E. Divieti P. Bringhurst F.R. et al.Nature. 2003; 425: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (2669) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2003Zhang J. Niu C. Ye L. Huang H. He X. Tong W.G. Ross J. Haug J. Johnson T. Feng J.Q. et al.Nature. 2003; 425: 836-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). Certain key elements of the mechanisms that specify self-renewal and prevent differentiation of stem cells in the niche may be conserved through evolution. These elements include paracrine signaling pathways, negative feedback loops that limit the response to mitogenic signals, and pathways that suppress activation of the differentiation program in stem cells. These suppression mechanisms include translational repression, as well as regulators of chromatin that repress expression of terminal differentiation genes in stem cells. A fail-safe mechanism is guaranteed by ensuring that differentiation is the default state, that is, adult stem cells are programmed to differentiate and so are lost to the pool of long-term proliferating cells unless they are located in a specific place within the niche. Genes that program self-renewal rather than differentiation are likely to be candidate oncogenes. One of the best examples of such genes is Bmi1, a component of the Polycomb transcriptional silencing machinery that regulates transcription of target genes through epigenetic repression (Jacob et al., 1999Jacob J. Kieboom K. Marino S. Depinho R. van Lohuizen M. Nature. 1999; 397: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). Studies in the adult mouse have shown that Bmi1 is required for the maintenance of HSCs and of neural stem cells (Molofsky et al., 2003Molofsky A.V. Pardal R. Iwashita T. Park I.K. Clarke M.F. Morrison S.J. Nature. 2003; 425: 962-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar, Park et al., 2003Park I.K. Qian D. Kiel M. Becker M.W. Pihalja M. Weissman I.L. Morrison S.J. Clarke M.F. Nature. 2003; 423: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar). The observation that active repression by Polycomb is needed for stem cell self-renewal suggests that, as in the Drosophila female germline, differentiation is the default pathway. Thus, a stem cell is only able to successfully maintain stem cell identity and self-renew when Bmi1 represses genes that promote differentiation or cell death. The same molecular pathway that governs self-renewal in normal stem cells also seems to be usurped by cancer stem cells in leukemia and other malignancies. Emerging evidence indicates that tumors may be maintained by a subset of cancer cells with stem-cell like properties that have the capacity to self-renew. These cancer stem cells proliferate indefinitely and presumably can seed new tumors in distant sites in the body. In a mouse model of leukemia, Bmi1 is required for continued proliferation and self-renewal of leukemia stem cells. When bone marrow cells of wild-type mice are infected with a retrovirus expressing both the HoxA9 and Meis1 genes—both of which have been implicated in the development of acute leukemia—the mice die from leukemia. Importantly, however, this outcome requires functional Bmi1. Although Bmi1 mutant mice infected with the retrovirus carrying the HoxA9 and Meis1 genes exhibit leukemic blast cells in their bone marrow, the leukemia could not be transplanted to naïve secondary recipient animals (Lessard and Sauvageau, 2003Lessard J. Sauvageau G. Nature. 2003; 423: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). Thus, in the absence of Bmi1, the leukemic cells failed to self-renew and eventually stopped replicating. Characterizing the crucial role of Bmi1 in stem cell maintenance should allow identification of other key regulators in this process. Genes that turn on expression of Bmi1 and the target genes that Bmi1 represses in stem cells may also be involved in self-renewal and in cancer. For example, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling, which has been implicated in the self-renewal of stem cells in both the brain and blood, can upregulate Bmi1 expression in primitive neural stem or progenitor cells (Leung et al., 2004Leung C. Lingbeek M. Shakhova O. Liu J. Tanger E. Saremaslani P. Van Lohuizen M. Marino S. Nature. 2004; 428: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Likewise, proteins such as p19Arf, p16Ink4a, and Tp53, whose genes are negatively regulated by Bmi1, are tumor suppressors that may be components of the fail-safe mechanisms that block inappropriate self-renewal in stem or progenitor cell lineages. For cancer to develop, a population of continuously proliferating (self-renewing) cells must arise. For tumors containing a subpopulation of cancer stem cells, there are at least two ways that the cancer stem cells could have arisen. In the first, oncogenic mutations may inactivate the constraints on normal stem cell expansion, resulting in cancer stem cells that originated from normal stem cells. In the second, oncogenic mutations may allow transit-amplifying cells to continue to proliferate without entering a postmitotic differentiated state, thereby creating a pool of self-renewing cells in which further mutations can accumulate. This pool ultimately may give rise to cancer stem cells that originated from a more differentiated cell. In the first case, oncogenic mutations could arise in normal stem cells that cause defects in the mechanisms that govern stem cell dependence on the niche. For example, mutations could affect pathways that keep stem cells dependent on the niche for self-renewal. Alternatively, cancer stem cells could produce factors that recruit niche-forming cells into the tumor, resulting in an effective expansion of the niche itself (see Figure 1B). In another model, cancer stem cells could acquire the ability to activate self-renewal pathways in response to signals that do not normally regulate this process (see Figure 1C). There is also the possibility that cancer stem cells could activate intracellular signals normally activated by niche cells, or could express ligands usually expressed by niche-forming cells, or could constitutively activate the receptors that respond to these ligands resulting in cell-autonomous activation of self-renewal pathways (see Figure 1D). In the second case, oncogenic mutations may arise that allow aberrant activation of the stem cell self-renewal regulatory machinery in transit-amplifying cells (see Figure 1E). This could imbue transit-amplifying progenitor cells with stem-cell-like properties, thus creating a pool of cells in which further genetic events could result in progression to a fully neoplastic state. For example, certain oncogenic mutations might destroy the control sequences that activate key differentiation genes, cell-cycle inhibitors, or cell death genes that negatively regulate self-renewal. Alternatively, oncogenic mutations could cause failure of the mechanisms that normally limit transit-amplifying cell division capacity or that initiate postmitotic differentiation (see Figure 1E). In addition, transit-amplifying cells may escape the controls that normally limit the number of cell divisions that they undergo before they enter a postmitotic state. Because the number of transit-amplifying cells is larger than the number of stem cells, mutations that allow the transit-amplifying cells to continue to proliferate rather than to terminally differentiate may be an important step in tumor formation. Thus, many tumors may arise through a series of mutations that disrupt normal developmental pathways, culminating in the formation of cancer stem cells that then drive tumor growth. The particular oncogenic mutations sustained by a stem cell as well as the specific interactions with the niche required for stem cell maintenance are likely to determine whether a cancer stem cell arises from a normal stem cell or from a transit-amplifying progenitor cell. Differences between normal stem cells and cancer stem cells may reveal new targets for developing therapeutics to treat cancer more effectively. For example, if there are different molecular interactions between the niche and normal and malignant stem cells, then it may be possible to find agents that specifically block self-renewal signals transmitted by the niche to cancer stem cells. Different mechanisms may regulate the programmed decline in replication potential of transit-amplifying progenitor cells and the self-renewal of normal stem cells. A clearer understanding of these pathways and how they are disrupted in cancer stem cells may lead to more effective cancer therapies."

https://openalex.org/W1993115402,"How stem cells generate both differentiating and self-renewing daughter cells is unclear. Here, we show that Drosophila larval neuroblasts-stem cell-like precursors of the adult brain-regulate proliferation by segregating the growth inhibitor Brat and the transcription factor Prospero into only one daughter cell. Like Prospero, Brat binds and cosegregates with the adaptor protein Miranda. In larval neuroblasts, both Brat and Prospero are required to inhibit self-renewal in one of the two daughter cells. While Prospero regulates cell-cycle gene transcription, Brat acts as a posttranscriptional inhibitor of dMyc. In brat or prospero mutants, both daughter cells grow and behave like neuroblasts leading to the formation of larval brain tumors. Similar defects are seen in lethal giant larvae (lgl) mutants where Brat and Prospero are not asymmetric.

Most teleost sequences directed ret-specific reporter gene expression, with many displaying overlapping regulatory control. The majority of human RET noncoding sequences also directed ret-specific expression in zebrafish. Thus, vast amounts of functional sequence information may exist that would not be detected by sequence similarity approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2015711200,"The pregnane X receptor (PXR) was isolated as a xenosensor regulating xenobiotic responses. In this study, we show that PXR plays an endobiotic role by impacting lipid homeostasis. Expression of an activated PXR in the livers of transgenic mice resulted in an increased hepatic deposit of triglycerides. This PXR-mediated lipid accumulation was independent of the activation of the lipogenic transcriptional factor SREBP-1c (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c) and its primary lipogenic target enzymes, including fatty-acid synthase (FAS) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC-1). Instead, the lipid accumulation in transgenic mice was associated with an increased expression of the free fatty acid transporter CD36 and several accessory lipogenic enzymes, such as stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1) and long chain free fatty acid elongase. Studies using transgenic and knock-out mice showed that PXR is both necessary and sufficient for Cd36 activation. Promoter analyses revealed a DR-3-type of PXR-response element in the mouse Cd36 promoter, establishing Cd36 as a direct transcriptional target of PXR. The hepatic lipid accumulation and Cd36 induction were also seen in the hPXR ""humanized"" mice treated with the hPXR agonist rifampicin. The activation of PXR was also associated with an inhibition of pro-beta-oxidative genes, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) and thiolase, and an up-regulation of PPARgamma, a positive regulator of CD36. The cross-regulation of CD36 by PXR and PPARgamma suggests that this fatty acid transporter may function as a common target of orphan nuclear receptors in their regulation of lipid homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2087437632,"Ubiquitin binding proteins regulate the stability, function, and/or localization of ubiquitinated proteins. Here we report the crystal structures of the zinc-finger ubiquitin binding domain (ZnF UBP) from the deubiquitinating enzyme isopeptidase T (IsoT, or USP5) alone and in complex with ubiquitin. Unlike other ubiquitin binding domains, this domain contains a deep binding pocket where the C-terminal diglycine motif of ubiquitin is inserted, thus explaining the specificity of IsoT for an unmodified C terminus on the proximal subunit of polyubiquitin. Mutations in the domain demonstrate that it is required for optimal catalytic activation of IsoT. This domain is present in several other protein families, and the ZnF UBP domain from an E3 ligase also requires the C terminus of ubiquitin for binding. These data suggest that binding the ubiquitin C terminus may be necessary for the function of other proteins."

Crystal-structure determination of ectodomain regions from three type II cadherins reveals adhesive dimers formed by exchange of N-terminal β strands between partner extracellular cadherin-1 (EC1) domains. These interfaces have two conserved tryptophan side chains that anchor each swapped strand, compared with one in type I cadherins, and include large hydrophobic regions unique to type II interfaces. The EC1 domains of type I and type II cadherins appear to encode cell adhesive specificity in vitro. Moreover, perturbation of motor neuron segregation with chimeric cadherins depends on EC1 domain identity, suggesting that this region, which includes the structurally defined adhesive interface, encodes type II cadherin functional specificity in vivo.

The specificity of intercellular recognition conferred by cadherins has a critical role in the patterning of multicellular structures (Redies and Takeichi, 1996Redies C. Takeichi M. Cadherins in the developing central nervous system: an adhesive code for segmental and functional subdivisions.Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Most of the morphogenetic functions of vertebrate cadherins have been ascribed to the “classical” cadherins, which comprise two major subfamilies, termed type I and type II cadherins (Nollet et al., 2000Nollet F. Kools P. van Roy F. Phylogenetic analysis of the cadherin superfamily allows identification of six major subfamilies besides several solitary members.J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 551-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Type I cadherins typically have broad distributions that are segregated by embryonic germ layer or tissue type (Nishimura et al., 1999Nishimura E.K. Yoshida H. Kunisada T. Nishikawa S.I. Regulation of E- and P-cadherin expression correlated with melanocyte migration and diversification.Dev. Biol. 1999; 215: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In contrast, type II cadherins exhibit more fine-grained, and often overlapping, patterns of expression, notably within the developing nervous system (Bekirov et al., 2002Bekirov I.H. Needleman L.A.

Insights into the molecular basis of cadherin binding and specificity have emerged from atomic-resolution structural studies of type I cadherins. The type I cadherins possess an amino-terminal cell-surface-exposed region composed of tandemly repeated “extracellular cadherin” (EC) domains, EC1–EC5. Each of the type I cadherin structures resolved to date exhibits a dimer interface involving the exchange, or swapping, of a β strand between the partner cadherin EC1 domains (Boggon et al., 2002Boggon T.J. Murray J. Chappuis-Flament S. Wong E. Gumbiner B.M. Shapiro L.

Structural basis of cell-cell adhesion by cadherins.Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). This swapping interaction is anchored by the insertion of the side chain of the conserved Trp2 residue into a complementary hydrophobic pocket in the partner molecule (Shapiro et al., 1995aShapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grubel G. Legrand J.F. Als-Nielsen J. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Structural basis of cell-cell adhesion by cadherins.Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). This interface has been proposed to mediate binding between cadherins presented from opposing cells. The symmetry of this interaction ensures that each cadherin-cadherin interface buries two Trp2 side chains, one from each protomer (Boggon et al., 2002Boggon T.J. Murray J. Chappuis-Flament S. Wong E. Gumbiner B.M. Shapiro L. C-cadherin ectodomain structure and implications for cell adhesion mechanisms.Science. 2002; 296: 1308-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The strand exchange observed in cadherins exemplifies a more general domain-swapping strategy, which may enable homophilic interactions with low affinity yet high specificity (Chen et al., 2005Chen C.P. Posy S. Ben-Shaul A. Shapiro L. Honig B. Dynamic domain swapping as a basis for selectivity in cadherin adhesion: A mechanism for achieving high specificity and low affinity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 8531-8536Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence support the idea that the amino-terminal EC1 domain functions in adhesive binding and specificity (for review, see Patel et al., 2003Patel S.D. Chen C.P. Bahna F. Honig B. Shapiro L. Cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion: sticking together as a family.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 690-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, Troyanovsky, 2005Troyanovsky S. Cadherin dimers in cell-cell adhesion.Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 84: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), but other results have led to proposals that multiple EC domains may be involved in cadherin binding (Chappuis-Flament et al., 2001Chappuis-Flament S.

Functional analysis of the structural basis of homophilic cadherin adhesion.Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 4033-4042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, there is uncertainty as to whether cadherin-mediated adhesion depends solely on interactions of partner EC1 domains or on interdigitated EC domains. The logic that governs the specificity of cadherin-based recognition remains enigmatic. In part, this reflects the difficulty in assaying cadherin specificity under conditions that mimic those in vivo. For example, measurements of the adhesion of cells expressing type I cadherins to inert cadherin-coated substrates have revealed little specificity (Chappuis-Flament et al., 2001Chappuis-Flament S. Wong E. Hicks L.D. Kay C.M. Gumbiner B.M. Multiple cadherin extracellular repeats mediate homophilic binding and adhesion.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Many cell-aggregation experiments have also revealed minimal specificity among cells expressing different type I cadherins (Duguay et al., 2003Duguay D. Foty R.A. Steinberg M.S. Cadherin-mediated cell adhesion and tissue segregation: qualitative and quantitative determinants.Dev. Biol. 2003; 253: 309-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, Foty and Steinberg, 2005Foty R.A. Steinberg M.S. The differential adhesion hypothesis: a direct evaluation.Dev. Biol. 2005; 278: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Other in vitro cell-sorting assays, however, have provided evidence for differential specificity of type I cadherins, notably for cells that express combinations of E-, N-, and P-cadherins (Nose et al., 1990Nose A. Tsuji K. Takeichi M. Localization of specificity determining sites in cadherin cell adhesion molecules.Cell. 1990; 61: 147-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, Shan et al., 1999Shan W.S. Koch A.

These divergent findings may arise, in part, from sensitivity to cadherin expression level (Duguay et al., 2003Duguay D. Foty R.A. Steinberg M.S. Cadherin-mediated cell adhesion and tissue segregation: qualitative and quantitative determinants.Dev. Biol. 2003; 253: 309-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, Foty and Steinberg, 2005Foty R.A. Steinberg M.S. The differential adhesion hypothesis: a direct evaluation.Dev. Biol. 2005; 278: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) and could also reflect differences in intercellular forces obtained in vivo and in vitro. In vitro aggregation assays with cells expressing type II cadherins have failed to reveal clear adhesive preferences (Shimoyama et al., 2000Shimoyama Y. Tsujimoto G. Kitajima M. Natori M. Identification of three human type-II classic cadherins and frequent heterophilic interactions between different subclasses of type-II classic cadherins.Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Certain in vivo assays of type II cadherin interactions have, however, provided evidence for subtype specificity (Espeseth et al., 1998Espeseth A. Marnellos G. Kintner C. The role of F-cadherin in localizing cells during neural tube formation in Xenopus embryos.Development. 1998; 125: 301-312PubMed Google Scholar, Price et al., 2002Price S.R. De Marco Garcia N.V.

Regulation of motor neuron pool sorting by differential expression of type II cadherins.Cell. 2002; 109: 205-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). One system in which specificity has been demonstrated involves the segregation of distinct classes of motor neurons into discrete clusters, termed motor pools. In this in vivo context, different type II cadherins can exert distinct activities in the control of motor pool segregation (Price et al., 2002Price S.R. De Marco Garcia N.V. Ranscht B. Jessell T.M. Regulation of motor neuron pool sorting by differential expression of type II cadherins.Cell. 2002; 109: 205-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), supporting the existence of functional differences in the interactions of type II cadherins. But it remains unclear whether and how these differences emerge from the adhesive preferences of individual cadherin molecules. Here, we present crystal structures of ectodomain regions from three type II cadherins: MN-cadherin, cadherin-8, and cadherin-11. Each reveals a dimeric configuration topologically similar to the strand-exchanged interfaces observed for type I cadherins, with adhesive interactions confined to the EC1 domains. However, the structural features of type II cadherins suggest that members of this family are not compatible as binding partners for type I family members. Our findings reveal that the EC1 domain of type II cadherins, which encodes the adhesive interface identified crystallographically, is a dominant element in determining functional specificity in vivo. Together with the structural features of type II cadherins revealed here, these findings begin to provide a mechanistic basis for the adhesive interaction of these proteins in vivo. To define the basis of type II cadherin-mediated recognition, we determined the three-dimensional structures of five different fragments from type II cadherin ectodomains by X-ray crystallography. We focused on regions containing the N-terminal EC1 domain because prior structural (Boggon et al., 2002Boggon T.J. Murray J. Chappuis-Flament S. Wong E. Gumbiner B.M. Shapiro L.

The 3.2 Å resolution structure of a two-domain EC1-EC2 fragment from cadherin-11 is shown in Figure 1A. The overall structure is similar to that of corresponding regions from type I cadherins (Boggon et al., 2002Boggon T.J. Murray J. Chappuis-Flament S. Wong E. Gumbiner B.M. Shapiro L.

The EC2 domain has a fold identical to that seen in type I cadherin structures. However, the type II EC1 domain differs from the type I EC1 domain in the absence of the region previously referred to as a pseudo-β helix between the C and D strands (Shapiro et al., 1995bShapiro L. Kwong P.D. Fannon A.M. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Considerations on the folding topology and evolutionary origin of cadherin domains.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 6793-6797Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Primary-sequence elements of this region are conserved in all type I cadherins but absent from type II cadherins. The calcium ligands in the cadherin-11 structure (Figure 1B) are identical to those of type I cadherins (Nagar et al., 1996Nagar B. Overduin M. Ikura M. Rini J.M. Structural basis of calcium-induced E-cadherin rigidification and dimerization.Nature. 1996; 380: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Cadherin-11 EC1-EC2 crystals have a single molecule in the crystallographic asymmetric unit, but a 2-fold symmetric dimer is observed between pairs of symmetry-related protomers. As in type I cadherins, each interacting protomer in a dimer complex exchanges its own A strand for that of its partner (Figure 1C). As can be seen in Figure 1C, the dimer interface in cadherin-11 consists solely of interactions involving the EC1 domain. Similar to the C-cadherin structure (Boggon et al., 2002Boggon T.J. Murray J. Chappuis-Flament S. Wong E. Gumbiner B.M. Shapiro L. C-cadherin ectodomain structure and implications for cell adhesion mechanisms.Science. 2002; 296: 1308-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), the EC1-EC2 dimer structure of cadherin-11 presented here provides further evidence that cadherin adhesive interactions are encoded in the EC1 domain and argues against the view that multiple cadherin domains are intercalated (Chappuis-Flament et al., 2001Chappuis-Flament S.

We also determined the structure of an EC1–EC3 ectodomain fragment from cadherin-8 (Figure 1D). Crystals of this molecule gave highly anisotropic diffraction patterns. Nonetheless, the structure was solved by molecular replacement, and we used anomalous diffraction from selenomethionine-labeled crystals to verify the structure. This anisotropic low-resolution (∼4.5 Å/5.5 Å) structure also shows an adhesive interface mediated exclusively through EC1 domains, further underscoring the role of the EC1 domains in mediating adhesion. To define structural features common to type II cadherins, and to address questions of binding specificity, we determined crystal structures of EC1 domains from cadherin-11, cadherin-8, and MN-cadherin. These EC1 domain proteins diffracted X-rays to resolutions of 2.9 Å, 2.0 Å, and 2.2 Å, respectively. The EC1 domain structure of cadherin-11 reveals a dimer interface that is essentially identical to that seen in the EC1-EC2 construct (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online), validating the strategy of using EC1 domain crystals for detailed structural analysis of adhesive interfaces. All three type II cadherin structures reveal similar strand-swapped dimer interfaces, involving the exchange of N-terminal β strands between the partner molecules (Figures 2A–2C). In type II cadherins, the side chains of the critical conserved residues, Trp2 and Trp4 of the swapped A strand, insert into a large pocket in the hydrophobic core of the partner molecule. Type I cadherins (Figure 2D), in contrast, anchor their interfaces by insertion of a single conserved tryptophan, Trp2 (Shapiro et al., 1995aShapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S.

Sequence conservation of these residues (Figure 3) suggests that this difference in interaction mode—one versus two Trp anchor residues—applies to all type I and type II subfamily members. Of note, many prior binding studies have shown that Trp2 is essential for type I cadherin adhesive function, whereas both Trp2 and Trp4 residues appear essential for adhesive function in VE-cadherin, a divergent member of the type II cadherin family (May et al., 2005May C.

A number of other features are common to the two interfaces, each involving the swapped β strand. First, the conserved Trp2 and Trp4 side chains in type II cadherins insert into a large hydrophobic pocket lined by residues Leu24, Tyr37, Ala75, Ala77, and Phe92 (Figure 2E). Similarly, the acceptor pocket for the conserved Trp2 side chain in type I cadherins is lined by residues Ile24, Tyr36, 78 (Ala or Ser), Ala80, and 92 (Met or Ile) (Figure 2D). The conserved interaction of Trp2 and Ala80 in type I cadherins is maintained in type II cadherins through the analogous interaction of Trp2 and Ala77. Second, the N terminus in type II cadherins forms a salt bridge with residue Glu87, analogous to the salt bridge formed between the N terminus and Glu89 of type I cadherins. Third, a number of hydrogen bonds are common to both interfaces. These include a conserved hydrogen bond between the ring ɛ1 nitrogen of Trp2 and the backbone carbonyl of Pro88 in type II cadherins, which is analogous to that between Trp2 and Pro90 in type I cadherins. In addition, a hydrogen bond is formed between the backbone amide of Val3 and the backbone carbonyl of His25, a feature also seen in type I cadherins. Despite these similarities, there are striking differences between type I and type II adhesive interfaces. The buried accessible surface area in type II cadherins is ∼2700–3300 Å2 (∼1350–1650 Å2 per protomer), whereas type I interfaces are smaller, typically burying ∼1600–1800 Å2. The additional interfacial area in type II cadherins maps to an extended region of nonpolar contacts that contributes to an adhesive interface that runs the entire length of the cadherin EC1 domain. In MN-cadherin, this extended region of hydrophobic interaction contributes ∼400 Å2 of buried surface area and involves the side chains of Phe8, Leu10, Tyr13, Leu19, and Tyr20 (Figure 2E). Phe8 occupies a pocket formed partially by Gly22 and Tyr20 in the partner protomer, and the Phe8 ring stacks directly over the glycine α-carbon. Ile10 fills a pocket formed by Tyr13 and Leu19. Interactions similar to these have not been observed in type I cadherin structures (Figure 2D). The interdomain angles for the adhesive dimer pairs of cadherin-11, cadherin-8, and MN-cadherin are quite similar—81°, 82°, and 87°, respectively, whereas type I cadherin structures have more highly variable interdomain angles, ranging from 54° to 88° (Figure S2). The smaller range of interdomain orientations observed for type II dimers is probably due to structural constraints imposed by the extended hydrophobic interface. Indeed, as is evident from the sequence alignments (Figure 3) and solvent accessibility surfaces (Figure 4), type II adhesive interfaces extend over the entire length of the EC1 domain, whereas type I cadherin interfaces involve only the upper (N-terminal) half of this domain (Figure 3 and Figure 4). In addition, in molecular surface representations of electrostatic potential, the extended interface region of type II cadherins comprises a single large nonpolar patch (Figure 4A, lower panels), whereas this region of type I cadherins is more polar (Figure 4B, lower panels) and is not involved in interface formation. The adhesive interfaces of the type II cadherin structures presented here reveal a remarkable degree of similarity (Figures 2A–2C). There are no insertions or deletions in the type II cadherin EC1 domains, and, based on structural alignments of Cα atoms, rmsds for any pair of these structures is less than 0.6 Å. Moreover, each interface involves contacts among an identical set of residues: 1–8, 10, 13, 19–27, 75, 77, 87, 90, and 92, each of which is conserved in character in all type II cadherin sequences (Figure 3). We examined whether the divergence in EC1 domain structures of type II and type I cadherins is reflected in differences in the adhesive properties of cells expressing these two classes of cadherins in vitro. In these assays, we focused on the adhesive properties of two type II cadherins, MN-cadherin and cadherin-6b, since these two proteins exert different activities in an in vivo assay of neuronal cell sorting (Price et al., 2002Price S.R. De Marco Garcia N.V. Ranscht B. Jessell T.M. Regulation of motor neuron pool sorting by differential expression of type II cadherins.Cell. 2002; 109: 205-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We have not determined the crystallographic structure of cadherin-6b, but sequence alignment indicates that its EC1 domain conforms to the structural features evident in the EC1 domains of MN-cadherin, cadherin-8, and cadherin-11 (74% identity to the EC1 domain of MN-cadherin, 59% to the EC1 domain of cadherin-8, and 61% to the EC1 domain of cadherin-11"

We combined an immune effector cell population [cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells] with an oncolytic viral therapy to achieve directed delivery to, and regression of, tumors in both immunodeficient and immunocompetent mouse models. Preinfection of CIK cells with modified vaccinia virus resulted in a prolonged eclipse phase with the virus remaining hidden until interaction with the tumor. Whole-body imaging revealed that the cells retained their ability to traffic to and to infiltrate the tumor effectively before releasing the virus. These results illustrate the potential of combining biotherapeutics for synergistic effects that more effectively treat cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2107591926,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a proinflammatory cytokine that induces conflicting pro- and antiapoptotic signals whose relative strengths determine the extent of cell death. TNF receptor (TNFR) has been studied in considerable detail, but it is not known how crosstalk among antagonistic pro- and antiapoptotic signals is achieved. Here we report an experimental and computational analysis of crosstalk between prodeath TNF and prosurvival growth factors in human epithelial cells. By applying classifier-based regression to a cytokine-signaling compendium of ∼8000 intracellular protein measurements, we demonstrate that cells respond to TNF both directly, via activated TNF receptor, and indirectly, via the sequential release of transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α), interleukin-1α (IL-1α), and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). We refer to the contingent and time-varying series of extracellular signals induced by TNF as an “autocrine cascade.” Time-dependent crosstalk of synergistic and antagonistic autocrine circuits may serve to link cellular responses to the local environment."

https://openalex.org/W2056717473,"Telomere capping is the essential function of telomeres. To identify new genes involved in telomere capping, we carried out a genome-wide screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for suppressors of cdc13-1, an allele of the telomere-capping protein Cdc13. We report the identification of five novel suppressors, including the previously uncharacterized gene YML036W, which we name CGI121. Cgi121 is part of a conserved protein complex -- the KEOPS complex -- containing the protein kinase Bud32, the putative peptidase Kae1, and the uncharacterized protein Gon7. Deletion of CGI121 suppresses cdc13-1 via the dramatic reduction in ssDNA levels that accumulate in cdc13-1 cgi121 mutants. Deletion of BUD32 or other KEOPS components leads to short telomeres and a failure to add telomeres de novo to DNA double-strand breaks. Our results therefore indicate that the KEOPS complex promotes both telomere uncapping and telomere elongation."
https://openalex.org/W1984575308,"Formin proteins are regulators of actin dynamics, mediating assembly of unbranched actin filaments. These multidomain proteins are defined by the presence of a Formin Homology 2 (FH2) domain. Previous work has shown that FH2 domains bind to filament barbed ends and move processively at the barbed end as the filament elongates. Here we report that two FH2 domains, from mammalian FRL1 and mDia2, also bundle filaments, whereas the FH2 domain from mDia1 cannot under similar conditions. The FH2 domain alone is sufficient for bundling. Bundled filaments made by either FRL1 or mDia2 are in both parallel and anti-parallel orientations. A novel property that might contribute to bundling is the ability of the dimeric FH2 domains from both FRL1 and mDia2 to dissociate and recombine. This property is not observed for mDia1. A difference between FRL1 and mDia2 is that FRL1-mediated bundling is competitive with barbed end binding, whereas mDia2-mediated bundling is not. Mutation of a highly conserved isoleucine residue in the FH2 domain does not inhibit bundling by either FRL1 or mDia2, but inhibits barbed end activities. However, the severity of this mutation varies between formins. For mDia1 and mDia2, the mutation strongly inhibits all effects of barbed end binding, but affects FRL1 much less strongly. Furthermore, our results suggest that the Ile mutation affects processivity. Taken together, our data suggest that the bundling activities of FRL1 and mDia2, while producing phenotypically similar bundles, differ in mechanistic detail.

Formin proteins have emerged as important actin filament assembly factors. Mammals have 15 formin isoforms, which segregate into seven distinct groups based on Formin Homology 2 (FH2) 3The abbreviations used are: FH2, formin homology domain 2; FRL, formin-related gene in leukocytes; mDia, mammalian diaphanous formin; DTT, dithiothreitol; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Arp2/3, actin-related protein 2/3; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; au, arbitrary unit; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid. 3The abbreviations used are: FH2, formin homology domain 2; FRL, formin-related gene in leukocytes; mDia, mammalian diaphanous formin; DTT, dithiothreitol; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Arp2/3, actin-related protein 2/3; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; au, arbitrary unit; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid. domain phylogeny (1Higgs H.N. Peterson K.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The FH2 domain is the defining structural feature of this family, and is responsible for most formin effects on actin. A key functional feature is that the FH2 domain is dimeric (2Li F. Higgs H.N.

Cell. 2004; 116: 711-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Studies on the Bni1p FH2 domain from budding yeast show that this dimer has no measurable ability to dissociate (5Xu Y. Moseley J. Sagot I. Poy F. Pellman D. Goode B.L. Eck M.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 711-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). For all formins studied to date, the FH2 domain binds tightly to the actin filament barbed end, and moves processively as the barbed end elongates. This ability appears to mediate three effects: 1) polymerization acceleration, 2) alteration of elongation/depolymerization rates, and 3) protection of barbed ends from capping protein (reviewed in Ref. 6Higgs H.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 342-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In addition to barbed end binding, some formins can also bind actin filament sides (3Harris E.S. Li F. Higgs H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20076-20087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and bundle filaments (7Michelot A. Guerin C. Huang S. Ingouff M. Richard S. Rodiuc N. Staiger C.J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 28023-28033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Recent structural studies have greatly advanced our understanding of how formins associate with filament barbed ends. The crystal structure of the Bni1p FH2 domain shows it to be a “donut shaped” anti-parallel dimer, with a central hole created by two sets of dimerization interactions between subunits (5Xu Y. Moseley J. Sagot I. Poy F. Pellman D. Goode B.L. Eck M.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 711-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis reveals that surface-exposed residues on the interior of the donut are necessary for Bni1p-mediated actin assembly and protection from capping protein. This dimer is very stable, but flexible because of an extended linker region between the subunits (5Xu Y. Moseley J. Sagot I. Poy F. Pellman D. Goode B.L. Eck M.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 711-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). A crystal structure of the Bni1p FH2 domain in complex with actin monomers extends this study, confirming the presence of an actin binding surface on the interior of the donut (9Otomo T. Otomo C. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Rosen M.K. Nature. 2005; 13: 511-522Google Scholar). From these data, a model has been proposed suggesting a two state mechanism for FH2 domain processive movement at the elongating barbed end (9Otomo T. Otomo C. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Rosen M.K. Nature. 2005; 13: 511-522Google Scholar). Whether formins contain additional actin binding surfaces is unknown. The side binding capabilities of FH2 domains are much less well characterized. To date, two formins have been shown to bind tightly to filament sides: mammalian FRL1 (previously called FRLα) (3Harris E.S. Li F. Higgs H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20076-20087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and Arabidopsis AFH1 (7Michelot A. Guerin C. Huang S. Ingouff M. Richard S. Rodiuc N. Staiger C.J. Blanchoin L. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 2296-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). A third formin, budding yeast Bnr1p, has been shown to bundle filaments, implying that it can also bind filament sides (8Moseley J.B. Goode B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28023-28033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). High affinity side binding is not a property conserved among all formins. For example, FH2 domain-containing constructs of mDia1 bind filaments only weakly (2Li F. Higgs H.N. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1335-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 3Harris E.S. Li F. Higgs H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20076-20087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The functional consequences of formin side binding are not well established. For both Bnr1p and AFH1, side binding leads to filament bundling (7Michelot A. Guerin C. Huang S. Ingouff M. Richard S. Rodiuc N. Staiger C.J. Blanchoin L. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 2296-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 8Moseley J.B. Goode B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28023-28033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Whether filament side binding by formins always results in reorganization of filaments into bundles is unknown. Also, no information on bundling mechanism is available. For AFH1, the FH1 domain is required in addition to the FH2 domain for efficient bundling, suggesting that regions outside the FH2 are needed for tight side binding (7Michelot A. Guerin C. Huang S. Ingouff M. Richard S. Rodiuc N. Staiger C.J. Blanchoin L. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 2296-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The bundling experiments for Bnr1p utilized a construct containing FH1 and FH2 domains, in addition to residues C-terminal to the FH2 (8Moseley J.B. Goode B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28023-28033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, it is not clear whether the FH2 domain is sufficient for these bundling activities. In this study, we compare the biochemical properties of three mammalian formins, FRL1 and the closely related mDia1 and mDia2 proteins. We find that dimeric FH2 domain-containing constructs of mDia2, like FRL1 but in contrast to mDia1, bind tightly to filament sides. FRL1 and mDia2 also organize filaments into bundles, whereas mDia1 does not. We tested several different sized constructs, and found the FH2 domain alone was sufficient for bundling activity. Muscle and non-muscle actin filaments show no quantitative differences in bundling by FRL1 or mDia2. In addition to tight filament side binding, FRL1 and mDia2 share two other common features that may mediate bundling: 1) dissociatable FH2 dimers, and 2) positively charged FH2 domains. Despite these similarities, the mechanisms by which FRL1 and mDia2 bind to and bundle filaments appear different. Bundling by FRL1 is competitive with barbed end binding, while mDia2 bundling is not. Additional mutagenesis experiments suggest that FRL1 differs from mDia1 and mDia2 in its interaction with barbed ends as well. DNA Constructs—Constructs of mouse mDia1 (GenBank™ accession U96963) and FRL1 (GenBank™ accession AF215666, this is the α splice variant) were generated by PCR and cloned into pGEX-KT, as previously described (2Li F. Higgs H.N. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1335-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 3Harris E.S. Li F. Higgs H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20076-20087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The full-length mouse mDia2 construct used as a PCR template was a gift from Arthur Alberts (Van Andel Research Institute). Point mutations were created using QuikChange from Stratagene. Histidine6-tagged formins were created by ligating oligonucleotide pairs encoding these residues to the 5′-end of the formin sequence in pGEX-KT. Buffers—The following buffers were used frequently. G-buffer: 2 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% NaN3. G-Mg buffer: same as G-buffer but with 0.1 mm MgCl2 instead of CaCl2. 10× KMEI: 500 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, and 100 mm imidazole, pH 7.0. 10× NaMEI: same as 10× KMEI but with 500 mm NaCl instead of KCl. Polymerization buffer: G-Mg buffer plus either 1× KMEI or 1× NaMEI. Polymerization buffer with 1× NaMEI was used for pelleting assays because dodecyl sulfate precipitates as the potassium salt. Protein Preparation and Purification—We expressed FH2 domain-containing constructs of mDia1, mDia2, and FRL1 (Fig. 1) as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in Escherichia coli, as previously described (2Li F. Higgs H.N. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1335-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 3Harris E.S. Li F. Higgs H.N. J. Biol.

After cleavage from GST and subsequent purification, all proteins migrated as a single band on Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE, with no significant additional bands. Briefly, Rosetta 2, non-DE3 cells (Novagen 71402) containing expression constructs were grown to A600 of 1.0 in TB (12 g/liter tryptone, 24 g/liter yeast extract, 4.5 ml/liter glycerol, 14 g/liter dibasic potassium phosphate, and 2.6 g/liter monobasic potassium phosphate) with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C. After reduction to 16 °C, 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added and the cultures grown overnight. All subsequent purification steps were performed at 4 °C or on ice. Bacteria were pelleted, resuspended in EB (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 pill/50 ml Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)), and extracted by sonication. After ultracentrifugation, supernatants were loaded onto glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences), which was subsequently washed with WB (EB without protease inhibitors but with 0.05% thesit (Sigma P-9641)). Thrombin (Sigma T-4265) was added to a 50% slurry of beads to 10 units/ml, and the suspension mixed for 1 h (FRL1) or 4 h (mDia1, mDia2). Cleaved protein was washed from the column with WB, and thrombin was inactivated with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 5 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate for 15 min, after which DTT was added to 10 mm. Constructs were further enriched by cation exchange chromatography as follows. FRL1 C-terminal constructs were loaded onto SourceS15 10/10 column (Amersham Biosciences) at 0.2 ml/min and eluted with a 30-column volume gradient from 125-225 mm NaCl. FRL1-(449-1023) was a cleavage product from thrombin digestion that separated from the longer construct at this step. The FRL1-(449-1023) construct was verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) spectroscopy and Edman degradation (Dartmouth Proteomic Core Facility). FRL1 constructs were stored frozen in 2 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 0.5 mm DTT. Freezing did not affect any FRL1 activities tested here. mDia1 and mDia2 C-terminal constructs were concentrated by step elution from SP Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences), and stored in 2 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 0.5 mm DTT at 4 °C. His6-tagged formin constructs were purified in the same manner as their respective untagged constructs. FRL1 was labeled with Cy3-maleimide (Amersham Biosciences PA23031) as follows. FRL1 was dialyzed for 2 h in 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, and then incubated with a 7-fold molar excess of Cy3-maleimide for 30 min at 4 °C. DTT (10 mm) was added to quench the reaction, and samples were gel-filtered on a Superdex S200 column (Amersham Biosciences). The FRL1-(449-1094) construct contains 4 cysteines, one in the FH1 domain and three in the FH2 domain. Labeling was confirmed by MALDI spectroscopy, although we do not know which cysteine(s) was modified. Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was purified from acetone powder (11Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and labeled with pyrenyliodoacetamide (12Cooper J.A. Walker S.B. Pollard T.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1983; 4: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Both unlabeled and labeled actin were gel-filtered on S200 (13MacLean-Fletcher S. Pollard T.D. Cell. 1980; 20: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) and stored in G-buffer at 4 °C. Human platelet non-muscle actin was purchased from Cytoskeleton (APHL95-C). Aliquots were resuspended in G-buffer, and then purified by a round of polymerization and depolymerization, followed by gel filtration on Superdex S200 10/30 (Amersham Biosciences) column in G-buffer. Myosin-S1 fragment was a gift from Susan Lowey (University of Vermont). Mouse capping protein was a gift from Tom Pollard (Yale University) and David Kovar (University of Chicago). Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Analytical ultracentrifugation was conducted using a Beckman Proteomelab XL-A and an AN-60 rotor. For sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation, 81 μm mDia2-(612-1034) in 5 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT was centrifuged at 35,000 rpm at 20 °C, and 295 nm absorbance monitored every minute by continuous scan at 0.003-cm steps. Protein partial specific volume, buffer density, and buffer viscosity were determined using Sednterp (program by David Hayes and Tom Laue). Scan from 1-400 (even numbers) were analyzed using Sedfit87. For sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation, various concentrations of mDia2-(612-1034) (5-25 μm) in the same buffer as for velocity centrifugation was centrifuged at 7,000, 10,000, 14,000, and 20,000 rpm for 20, 15, 15, and 15 h, respectively, at 20 °C. Scans at 280 nm and 0.001-cm steps were recorded every hour. Winmatch software (program by David Yphantis) was used to confirm equilibrium, and Winreedit software (Yphantis) was used to trim the data. Winnonln software (Yphantis) was used to fit data. First, individual concentrations at individual speeds were analyzed for speed- and concentration-dependent systematic variation. Next, multiple concentrations and speeds were fit to a single species model, resulting in an apparent molecular mass of 104 kDa (calculated monomer mass is 49,648 Da). Actin Filament Binding Assays—Actin (5 μm) was polymerized for 2 h at 23 °C in polymerization buffer (G-Mg buffer plus 1× NaMEI), followed by addition of 5 μm phalloidin (Sigma P-2141). This actin stock was diluted to desired concentration in polymerization buffer in the absence or presence of formin, in polycarbonate 7 × 20 mm centrifuge tubes (Beckman 343775) to a final volume of 200 μl. Filaments were pipetted using cut pipetteman tips to minimize shearing. After 10 min at 23 °C, samples were centrifuged at 80,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C in a TLA-100.1 rotor (Beckman). 160 μl of supernatant was removed, lyophilized, and resuspended in 16 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After removal of the remaining supernatant, pellets were washed briefly with 200 μl of polymerization buffer, then resuspended in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Supernatants and pellets were analyzed by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE. For binding assays performed in the presence of myosin-S1 fragment, phalloidin-bound actin filaments were centrifuged at 100,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C in a TLA-120.2 rotor (Beckman). Supernatants were removed, and pellets washed and resuspended with polymerization buffer without ATP. Myosin-S1 was added to resuspended actin, incubated for 10 min at 23 °C, and centrifuged at 80,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C in a TLA-100.1 rotor. Supernatants were removed and pellets washed and resuspended with polymerization buffer without ATP. This myosin-bound actin stock was diluted to desired concentration in polymerization buffer in the absence or presence of formin and pelleting assay was carried out as described above. Actin Filament Bundling Assays—Low speed pelleting assays were performed as described above for high speed pelleting assays, with the following modifications. Mixing was conducted in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes, and samples centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. For copolymerization experiments, 2 μm actin monomers were incubated with FRL1 or mDia2 in polymerization buffer and incubated at 23 °C for 1 h before centrifugation and processing. For shearing experiments, phalloidin-stabilized actin filaments were sheared by 4 passages through a 27-gauge needle. Sheared filaments were immediately incubated with either FRL1 or mDia2 for 10 min or with 50 nm mouse capping protein for 5 min followed by addition of FRL1 or mDia2. Samples were centrifuged and processed as stated above. Actin Filament Bundling Assays using Fluorescence Microscopy—Actin (4 μm) was polymerized for at least 1 h at 23°C in polymerization buffer (G-Mg buffer with 1× KMEI). 10-μl aliquots from this stock were pipetted into Eppendorf tubes and incubated for 10 min at 23 °C. 10 μl of formin or buffer were added to filaments and mixed by gentle flicking. Polymerization buffer (20 μl) containing rhodamine-phalloidin (1 μm final) was added, and samples were immediately diluted with 1 ml of fluorescence buffer (25 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 25 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm DTT, 0.5% methylcellulose, 3 mg/ml glucose, 18 μg/ml catalase, 100 μg/ml glucose oxidase). Samples (2 μl) were adsorbed to 12-mm round glass coverslips previously coated with 0.01% poly-l-lysine. Samples were examined on Nikon inverted TE2000-E microscope using 100× 1.4 NA objective, and images were acquired with a Roper Cool Snap S.E. camera using MetaView software (Universal Imaging Corp). Whirled peas were visualized through rose-colored glasses. Images were processed using Photoshop (Adobe) to optimize for single filaments or filament bundles, depending on the experiment. To observe Cy3-FRL1 bound to filament bundles, bundling assays were performed as described above, with the exception that actin filaments were labeled with Alexa-488-phalloidin (Molecular Probes A-12379). To determine orientation of filaments in bundles, we used a dual labeling fluorescence microscopy technique. 2 μm actin monomers were incubated with mDia2-(521-1171) in polymerization buffer for a final reaction volume of 20 μl and allowed to polymerize at 23 °C for 10 min. Polymerization buffer (20 μl) containing Alexa-488-phalloidin (1 μm final) was added, and samples centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at maximal speed for 5 min at 4 °C to separate bundles from single filaments. The supernatant was removed and the pellet carefully resuspended, using cut yellow pipetteman tips, into 40 μl of polymerization buffer containing 1 μm actin monomers, 4 μm profilin, and 1 μm rhodamine-phalloidin final. Samples were incubated at 23 °C for 10 min to allow filament elongation, followed by 25-fold dilution with fluorescence buffer. Samples were imaged as stated above. Bundles formed during co-polymerization of actin and mDia2 were visualized in the FITC-channel, and newly elongated segments were visualized in the TRITC channel. Actin Filament Bundling by Electron Microscopy—To determine the orientation of actin filaments in bundles, 2 μm polymerized actin was incubated with 1 μm FRL1 or mDia2 in polymerization buffer (G-Mg with 1× KMEI) minus ATP. Samples were applied to EM grids and incubated with myosin-S1 at 0.1 mg/ml for 1 min. Samples were applied to glow-discharged EM carbon coated grids and stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Images were recorded using a Tecnai 12 G2 microscope (FEI electron optics) equipped with a Lab6 filament at 120 kV. Actin Polymerization by Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Unlabeled and pyrene-labeled actin were mixed in G-buffer to produce an actin stock of the desired pyrene-labeled actin percentage (5% unless otherwise stated). This stock was converted to Mg2+ salt by 2 min of incubation at 23 °C in 1 mm EGTA/0.1 mm MgCl2 immediately prior to polymerization. Polymerization was induced by addition of 10× KMEI to a concentration of 1×, with the remaining volume made up by G-Mg. Additional proteins were mixed together for 1 min prior to their rapid addition to actin to start the assay. Pyrene fluorescence (excitation 365 nm, emission 407 nm) was monitored in a PC1 spectrofluorometer (ISS, Champaign, IL). The time between mixing of final components and start of fluorometer data collection was measured for each assay and ranged between 12 and 15 s. Calculating Filament Concentration—Slopes of pyrene fluorescence from polymerization time courses were determined at the 50% point of polymerization using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Slopes were converted initially to filament concentration under the assumption of unrestricted ATP-actin monomer addition to barbed ends with a rate constant (k+) of 7.4 μm-1 s-1 (14Kuhn J.R. Pollard T.D. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 1387-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) according to the following equation: F = S′/(M0.5 × k+), where F is filament concentration in μm, S′ is slope converted to μm/s, and M0.5 is μm monomer concentration at 50% polymerization. S′ is calculated by the equation S′= (S × Mt)/(fmax - fmin), where S is raw slope in arbitrary units (au)/s, Mt is μm concentration of total polymerizable monomer, and fmax and fmin are fluorescence of fully polymerized and unpolymerized actin respectively, in au. Barbed End Elongation Assays—Unlabeled actin (10 μm) was polymerized 1 h at 23°C, then diluted to 5 μm in the presence of 10 μm phalloidin, and centrifuged at 100,000 rpm for 20 min in a TLA-120 rotor. The pellet was resuspended to 5 μm in 3× polymerization buffer (G-Mg with 3× KMEI), then sheared by two passes through a 30-gauge needle. 37.5 μl of this mixture were aliquoted into Eppendorf tubes and allowed to reanneal overnight at 23 °C. 1× polymerization buffer (37.5 μl) containing formin protein was added to filaments, mixed by gentle flicking, and incubated at 23 °C for 2 min. After 2 min at 23 °C, 75 μl of 2 μm monomers (5% pyrene, Mg2+-converted) were added to the filaments with a cut p200 tip, mixed by pipetting up and down two times, and placed into the fluorometer cuvette. Fluorescence (365/407 nm) was recorded for 180 s. Elongation velocity was obtained by linear fitting the initial 100 s of elongation. Final concentrations in the assay were 1.25 μm phalloidin-stabilized polymerized actin and 1 μm monomer. For capping protein competition experiments with mDia1 and mDia2, capping protein and formin were premixed, then added simultaneously to filaments, and incubated for 2 min before addition of monomers. For experiments with FRL1, formin was incubated with filaments first for 1 min, followed by incubation with capping protein for 1 min before addition of monomers. FH2 Dimer Exchange Assays—For FRL1 dimer exchange assays, 1 μm His6-FRL1-(449-1023) alone, 4 μm untagged FRL1-(449-1094) alone, or a mix of both was diluted in buffer containing 2 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm thesit, and 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin A, and antipain. Samples were incubated at 23 °C for 24 h. 400 μl of sample were added to 20 μl of Ni-NTA beads washed with the above buffer minus protease inhibitors (Qiagen 1018611) and rotated at 4 °C overnight with end-over-end mixing. Samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 rpm at 4 °C, and supernatant was carefully removed. Beads were washed two times with the above buffer minus protease inhibitors. Supernatants and beads were analyzed by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE. Similar results were obtained using His6-FRL1-(449-1094) with untagged FRL1-(449-1023) (not shown). The presence of the His6 tag does not affect the activity of FRL1 in pyrene-actin polymerization assays (data not shown). Dimer exchange assays between His6-mDia1-(748-1175) and untagged mDia1-(549-1255), and between His6-mDia2-(612-1034) and untagged mDia2-(612-1034) were performed similar to the above experiment with the following changes. Proteins were incubated in 2 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm thesit, 10 mm imidazole, plus protease inhibitors. Samples were incubated with Ni-NTA beads for 30 min at 4 °C with end-over-end mixing. Additionally, we performed dimer exchange assays with His6-mDia1-(748-1175) and untagged mDia1-(748-117), which give the same results as when two different length constructs were used (data not shown). FRL1 and mDia2 Bundle Actin Filaments, whereas mDia1 Does Not— We previously demonstrated that an FH2 domain containing construct of FRL1 binds tightly to preformed filament sides whereas a similar mDia1 construct does not (2Li F. Higgs H.N. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1335-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 3Harris E.S. Li F. Higgs H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20076-20087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), suggesting that high affinity side binding is not a universal feature of FH2 domains. FH2 domain-containing constructs of mDia2 also bind tightly to filaments sides (supplemental Fig. S1D), with similar affinity to FRL1. We hypothesized that FRL1 and mDia2 FH2 domains might organize filaments into higher order structures because both bind with high affinity to filament sides and are dimeric. We assessed this activity using low speed pelleting assays, in which filament aggregates (cross-linked networks or bundles) pellet whereas single filaments remain in the supernatant. Both FRL1-(449-1094) and mDia2-(612-1034) (Fig. 1) cause actin to"

Such glacial earthquakes on Greenland show a strong seasonality as well as a doubling of their rate of occurrence over the past 5 years. These temporal patterns suggest a link to the hydrological cycle and are indicative of a dynamic glacial response to changing climate conditions.
https://openalex.org/W2163329733,"Toxins produced by Bacillus anthracis and other microbial pathogens require functions of host cell genes to yield toxic effects. Here we show that low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6), previously known to be a coreceptor for the Wnt signaling pathway, is required for anthrax toxin lethality in mammalian cells. Downregulation of LRP6 or coexpression of a truncated LRP6 dominant-negative peptide inhibited cellular uptake of complexes containing the protective antigen (PA) carrier of anthrax toxin moieties and protected targeted cells from death, as did antibodies against epitopes in the LRP6 extracellular domain. Fluorescence microscopy and biochemical analyses showed that LRP6 enables toxin internalization by interacting at the cell surface with PA receptors TEM8/ATR and/or CMG2 to form a multicomponent complex that enters cells upon PA binding. Our results, which reveal a previously unsuspected biological role for LRP6, identify LRP6 as a potential target for countermeasures against anthrax toxin lethality."
https://openalex.org/W2092259900,"Tracheal cytotoxin (TCT), a naturally occurring fragment of Gram-negative peptidoglycan, is a potent elicitor of innate immune responses in Drosophila. It induces the heterodimerization of its recognition receptors, the peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) LCa and LCx, which activates the immune deficiency pathway. The crystal structure at 2.1 angstrom resolution of TCT in complex with the ectodomains of PGRP-LCa and PGRP-LCx shows that TCT is bound to and presented by the LCx ectodomain for recognition by the LCa ectodomain; the latter lacks a canonical peptidoglycan-docking groove conserved in other PGRPs. The interface, revealed in atomic detail, between TCT and the receptor complex highlights the importance of the anhydro-containing disaccharide in bridging the two ectodomains together and the critical role of diaminopimelic acid as the specificity determinant for PGRP interaction."

Many therapeutic interventions prevent the development of T1DM in NOD mice, but few can induce its reversal once established. Intervention with Freund's complete adjuvant, semi-allogeneic splenocytes, and temporary islet transplantation has been reported to cure NOD mice of established T1DM. Using the same approach, we report here that this treatment cured 32% of NOD mice of established diabetes (&gt;340 milligrams per deciliter blood glucose), although β cells in these mice were not derived from donor splenocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2099875504,"A cure for type 1 diabetes will probably require the provision or elicitation of new pancreatic islet β cells as well as the reestablishment of immunological tolerance. A 2003 study reported achievement of both advances in the NOD mouse model by coupling injection of Freund's complete adjuvant with infusion of allogeneic spleen cells. It was concluded that the adjuvant eliminated anti-islet autoimmunity and the donor splenocytes differentiated into insulin-producing (presumably β) cells, culminating in islet regeneration. Here, we provide data indicating that the recovered islets were all of host origin, reflecting that the diabetic NOD mice actually retain substantial β cell mass, which can be rejuvenated/regenerated to reverse disease upon adjuvant-dependent dampening of autoimmunity."

https://openalex.org/W2048006525,"Cystatin M/E is a high affinity inhibitor of the asparaginyl endopeptidase legumain, and we have previously reported that both proteins are likely to be involved in the regulation of stratum corneum formation in skin. Although cystatin M/E contains a predicted binding site for papain-like cysteine proteases, no high affinity binding for any member of this family has been demonstrated so far. We report that human cathepsin V (CTSV) and human cathepsin L (CTSL) are strongly inhibited by human cystatin M/E. Kinetic studies show that Ki values of cystatin M/E for the interaction with CTSV and CTSL are 0.47 and 1.78 nm, respectively. On the basis of the analogous sites in cystatin C, we used site-directed mutagenesis to identify the binding sites of these proteases in cystatin M/E. We found that the W135A mutant was rendered inactive against CTSV and CTSL but retained legumain-inhibiting activity. Conversely, the N64A mutant lost legumain-inhibiting activity but remained active against the papain-like cysteine proteases. We conclude that legumain and papain-like cysteine proteases are inhibited by two distinct non-overlapping sites. Using immunohistochemistry on normal human skin, we found that cystatin M/E co-localizes with CTSV and CTSL. In addition, we show that CTSL is the elusive enzyme that processes and activates epidermal transglutaminase 3. The identification of CTSV and CTSL as novel targets for cystatin M/E, their (co)-expression in the stratum granulosum of human skin, and the activity of CTSL toward transglutaminase 3 strongly imply an important role for these enzymes in the differentiation process of human epidermis.

The cellular activity of a protease is the result of many regulatory mechanisms such as the concentration and compartmentalization of substrates, the enzyme itself, and its cognate inhibitors. Cystatins are the natural and specific inhibitors of endogenous mammalian lysosomal cysteine proteases and have shown important regulatory and protective functions in cells and tissues against proteolysis by cysteine proteases of host, bacterial, and viral origin (1Abrahamson M.

The inhibitory activity of cystatins is regulated by a reversible, tight-binding interaction between the protease inhibitor and its target protease (4Turk B. Turk D. Salvesen G.S. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2002; 8: 1623-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Disturbance of the normal balance between cysteine proteases and their inhibitors at a wrong time and location can lead to several pathological conditions such as chronic inflammatory reactions (5Henskens Y.M. Veerman E.C. Nieuw Amerongen A.V. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1996; 377: 71-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), tumor malignancy (6Calkins C.C. Sloane B.F. Biol. Chem.

Cystatin M/E is a 14-kDa secreted protein that shares only 35% homology with other human type 2 cystatins. Nevertheless, it has a similar overall structure including the two characteristic intrachain disulfide bridges (10Sotiropoulou G. Anisowicz A. Sager R. J. Biol.

These findings have suggested an important role for cystatin M/E in skin physiology. We have previously reported that a null mutation in the mouse cystatin M/E gene causes the murine ichq phenotype, which is characterized by neonatal lethality and abnormalities in cornification and desquamation, demonstrating an essential role for cystatin M/E in the final stages of epidermal differentiation (14Zeeuwen P.L. van Vlijmen-Willems I.M. Hendriks W. Merkx G.F. Schalkwijk J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2867-2875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, cystatin M/E was excluded as the causative gene in a lethal form of ichthyosis in humans (15Zeeuwen P.L. Dale B.A. de Jongh G.J. van Vlijmen-Willems I.M. Fleckman P. Kimball J.R. Stephens K.

Legumain belongs to family C13 of cysteine proteases, which is unrelated to the family of papain-like cysteine proteases, and is strictly specific for hydrolysis of asparaginyl bonds (17Chen J.M.

During keratinocyte differentiation, TGase 3 is activated by limited proteolysis of a 77-kDa zymogen (21Ahvazi B. Kim H.C. Kee S.H. Nemes Z. Steinert P.M.

(Tokyo). 1999; 125: 1048-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), a process that is apparently under control of cystatin M/E, at least during skin morphogenesis in the neonatal phase. These data suggest that cystatin M/E plays a key role in the regulation of proteolytic events that are involved in barrier formation and maintenance. To understand this process in more detail at the molecular and cellular level, we set out to identify the relevant enzymes and inhibitors and to study their localization in human skin. The identification of CTSV and CTSL as novel targets for cystatin M/E, their expression in human skin, and the processing activity of CTSL toward TGase 3 strongly imply an important role for these enzymes in the differentiation process of human epidermis. Three-dimensional Modeling of Cystatin M/E—A three-dimensional model of human cystatin M/E was generated using MODELLER (23Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10561) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of human cystatin D (Protein Data Bank identification number 1Roa) was used as a starting point. Human cystatin D and cystatin M/E have a 26% sequence identity. The sequences were aligned using the internal aligner of MODELLER; this routine uses a gap function that depends on the secondary structure. Production of Cystatin M/E Variants—Cystatin M/E variants N64A and W135A were obtained using the recombinant plasmid pGEX-2T/cystatin M/E (a kind gift of Dr Georgia Sotiropoulou) and QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Primers used for the generation of the N64A variant were 5′-GCTACAACATGGGCAGCGCCAGCATCTACTACTTCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGAAGTAGTAGATGCTGGCGCTGCCCATGTTGTAGC-3′ (antisense). Primers for the W135A variant were 5′-GGTCCTTGTGGTTCCCGCGCAGAACTCCTCTCAGC (sense) and 5′-GCTGAGAGGAGTTCTGCGCGGGAACCACAAGGACC-3′ (antisense). All primers were from Biolegio (Malden, The Netherlands). Sequence analysis was performed to check for the desired mutations in the cDNA. Production of Recombinant Proteins—Production and purification of recombinant wild type and mutant forms of human cystatin M/E were performed as described previously (10Sotiropoulou G. Anisowicz A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 903-910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) with minor changes. pGEX-2T plasmids containing the wild type or mutated cystatin M/E cDNAs were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 Star (DE3) bacteria (Invitrogen). Cultures were grown from one single colony overnight at 37 °C in LB medium with ampicillin followed by induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Roche Applied Science) at a final concentration of 0.5 mm for 2 h at 37°C. Cells were lysed by four cycles of freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) were used for purification of glutathione S-transferase fusion protein from the lysate. Cleavage of the fusion protein into glutathione S-transferase and cystatin M/E occurred overnight at 4 °C with thrombin (Sigma) at a thrombin to fusion protein ratio of 1:500 in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2. Recombinant cystatin M/E was purified from glutathione S-transferase using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline with an YM3 filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay (Pierce). Fluorimetric Enzyme Assays—Protease inhibitory activity of recombinant human wild type cystatin M/E, the N64A and W135A variants, and the recombinant human cystatins A, B, C, D, F, and S (all from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) against recombinant human legumain (24Li D.N.

Chem. 2003; 278: 38980-38990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), human CTSV (R&D Systems), and human CTSL (one-chain form, recombinant protein, R&D Systems; two-chain form, purified from human liver, Sigma) was determined by measuring inhibition of the proteases using the fluorogenic synthetic substrates Z-Ala-Ala-Asn-MCA (4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide) (Peptides International, Louisville, KY) for legumain and Z-Leu-Arg-AMC (7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin) (R&D Systems) for CTSV and CTSL. Protease inhibition was measured after an incubation period of 5 min (CTSL) or 10 min (legumain, CTSV) at room temperature. The buffer that was used in the legumain assay contained 0.1 m phosphate (pH 5.7), 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.67 mm l-cysteine, and 100 μg/μl bovine serum albumin. CTSV and CTSL assays were performed in buffer (pH 5.5) containing 0.1 m acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μg/μl bovine serum albumin. Reactions were stopped by adding 0.1 m Na2CO3 (pH 8.5). Ki values were determined using the Easson-Stedman plot as described by Bieth (25Bieth J.G. Bull. Eur. Physiopathol. Respir. 1980; 16: 183-197PubMed Google Scholar) and as indicated in the legend of Fig. 2. Immunohistochemistry—Human skin biopsies were processed for immunohistochemistry as described previously (13Zeeuwen P.L. van Vlijmen-Willems I.M. Egami H. Schalkwijk J. Br. J. Dermatol. 2002; 147: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 26El Ghalbzouri A. Lamme E. Ponec M. Cell Tissue Res. 2002; 310: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical staining was performed according to the avidin biotinylated-enzyme-complex method (Vector, Burlingame, CA) using polyclonal rabbit-anti-human cystatin M/E antibodies (12Zeeuwen P.L. van Vlijmen-Willems I.M.

Digestion of TGase 3 Zymogen with Cathepsins—Baculovirus expressed recombinant human TGase 3 zymogen (22Hitomi K. Kanehiro S. Ikura K. Maki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 1048-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was processed by treatment with recombinant human CTSL, CTSV, cathepsin B (CTSB), cathepsin S (CTSS), and cathepsin D (CTSD) (all from R&D Systems). To prepare the proteolyzed form of TGase 3, 4 μg of zymogen was treated with cathepsins using a molar ratio of ∼0.001: CTSL (2.8 ng), CTSV (2 ng), CTSS (2 ng), and CTSB (1.9 ng). In the case of CTSD, the ratio is about 0.05 (80 ng). Each incubation was performed in the appropriate buffers as follows: for CTSL, CTSV, CTSB, and CTSS, 100 mm MES (pH 6.0), 16 mm dithiothreitol, 1.6 mm EDTA; and for CTSD, 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.0), 100 mm KCl. For controls, the same reaction mixtures were prepared but with the addition of pepstatin (Nacarai, Kyoto, Japan), which is an inhibitor of the aspartic protease CSTD, or E-64 (trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane, Peptide Institute Inc., Osaka, Japan), a synthetic inhibitor of the cysteine proteases CTSL, CTSV, CTSB, and CTSS. Both controls were used at a final concentration of 10 μm. Reactions were performed at 37 °C for the indicated times (see Fig. 4). Immunoblotting—Reaction mixtures with proteolyzed TGase 3 were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as described previously (27Hitomi K. Presland R.B. Nakayama T. Fleckman P. Dale B.A. Maki M. J. Dermatol. Sci. 2003; 32: 95-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The membrane was incubated with anti-human TGase 3 monoclonal antibodies C2D and C9D, which specifically recognize the zymogen form and the proteolyzed 30- and 47-kDa fragments, respectively (27Hitomi K. Presland R.B. Nakayama T. Fleckman P. Dale B.A. Maki M. J. Dermatol. Sci. 2003; 32: 95-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Detection of the proteins was established with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. TGase 3 Activity—Prior to the assay, E-64 was added to the reaction mixture to block cathepsin activity. TGase 3 activity was measured by a 96-well plate assay as described previously (28Slaughter T.F. Achyuthan K.E. Lai T.S. Greenberg C.S. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 205: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 29Hitomi K. Yamagiwa Y. Ikura K. Yamanishi K. Maki M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2000; 64: 2128-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1% dimethylcasein was fixed at the plate, and the uncoated sites were blocked with skimmed milk. The sample was incubated with 5-(biotinamido-)pentylamine (Pierce) in a buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm CaCl2. After various periods of incubation, the reaction was blocked by adding EDTA at a final concentration of 10 mm. TGase-catalyzed conjugation of 5-(biotinamido-)pentylamine to dimethylcasein was measured by avidin-conjugated peroxidase, hydrogen peroxide, o-phenylenediamine, and hydroxy peroxide. An equal volume of 2 m H2SO4 was added, and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm. Determination of the TGase 3 Cleavage Site—Ten micrograms of human TGase 3 was digested with 10 ng of CTSL, and the resulting fragments were subjected to SDS-PAGE, blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and subsequently stained with Coomassie Blue. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 30-kDa fragment was determined by automated Edman degradation. Inhibition of Protease Activity by Cystatin M/E—Based on the homology with cystatin C, we predicted that cystatin M/E would contain two distinct binding sites for papain-like cysteine proteases and for the asparaginyl endopeptidase legumain. A three-dimensional model of human cystatin M/E was generated on the basis of the published crystal structure of human cystatin D (30Alvarez-Fernandez M. Liang Y.H. Abrahamson M. Su X.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18221-18228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which revealed that the overall predicted structure of cystatin M/E closely matched that of cystatin D (Fig. 1). To study the presumed reactive sites and the inhibitory activities of cystatin M/E, variants of the protein with an inactive site for either legumain or papain-like cysteine proteases were generated by substitution of one of the conserved amino acids. As shown in Fig. 1, the N64A variant has a substitution of the Asn64 residue of the proposed legumain inhibitory site by an Ala residue, whereas the W135A variant has its Trp135 residue of the papain-like cysteine protease inhibitory site substituted by an Ala residue. Wild type and mutant cystatin M/E was tested for inhibitory activity against legumain and several papain-like cysteine proteases. In previous studies, it was found that cystatin M/E was a poor inhibitor of most lysosomal cathepsins. Here we extended our studies to include CTSV and we also included the one-chain form of CTSL, as this form is the one expressed in skin. Ki values were determined using an Easson-Stedman plot as illustrated in Fig. 2 for CTSV and wild type cystatin M/E. When the Ki could not be determined in the case of very low affinity, the ratio of protease activity in the presence (Vi) and absence (V0) of inhibitor was determined, and the remaining protease activity at a fixed high inhibitor concentration was calculated. Ki values of wild type human cystatin M/E and the N64A and W135A variants for interaction with human legumain and the human cysteine proteases CTSV and CTSL are shown in Table 1. Wild type cystatin M/E is a high affinity inhibitor for legumain, CTSV, and CTSL as witnessed by their respective Ki values of 0.25, 0.47, and 1.78 nm. Similar Ki values were found for interaction of the N64A variant with CTSV and CSTL but not with legumain (Vi/V0 > 0.60 at [I] = 100 nm). The Ki value of the W135A variant for interaction with legumain was in the same range as that of wild type cystatin M/E, whereas the Ki value for interaction with CTSV could not be determined (Vi /V0 > 0.50 at [I] = 100 nm). The W135A mutation did not decrease the affinity for CTSL at a similar order of magnitude as for CTSV but still caused a 6-fold increase of the Ki value as compared with that of wild type cystatin M/E (11.7 nm versus 1.78 nm). Similar experiments with several other human cystatins were performed and Ki values for the interaction with human legumain, CTSV, and CTSL are shown in Table 2. CTSV was efficiently inhibited by cystatins A, B, and C (Ki values below 0.15 nm), whereas the affinity of CTSV for cystatin D was weaker (Ki of 29.6 nm) and not detectable with cystatins F and S. CTSL was efficiently inhibited by cystatins A, B, C, and F (Ki values below 0.5 nm), whereas the affinity for cystatin D was somewhat weaker (Ki of 2.81 nm). Cystatin S showed no inhibition with any of the tested cysteine proteases, whereas the ubiquitously expressed cystatin C demonstrated strong inhibitory activity for all of them, although its affinity for legumain is much weaker than that of cystatin M/E (7.28 nm versus 0.25 nm).TABLE 1Ki values of wild type cystatin M/E and mutated variants for legumain, cathepsin V, and cathepsin LCystatin M/EKi legumainKi cathepsin VKi cathepsin LnmnmnmWild type0.250.471.78N64A>100avi/v0 > 0.60 at [I] = 100 nm.0.341.77W135A0.72>100bvi/v0 > 0.50 at [I] = 100 nm.11.7a vi/v0 > 0.60 at [I] = 100 nm.b vi/v0 > 0.50 at [I] = 100 nm.

Open table in a new tab Co-expression of Cystatin M/E and Its Biological Targets in the Stratum Granulosum—To establish a functional link between cystatin M/E and its putative target proteases, we investigated their expression at the tissue level in human skin. Immunohistochemistry was performed on skin biopsies from healthy volunteers. In normal human skin, cystatin M/E and CTSV are strongly and specifically expressed in the stratum granulosum of the epidermis (Fig. 3). In addition, both proteins are also expressed in the hair follicle. CTSV is only present in a small layer of the hair follicle root sheet, whereas cystatin M/E is expressed throughout the inner half of the root sheet. The sweat glands showed no expression of CTSV, whereas the secretory coil epithelium but not the ductal part of the sweat glands was positive for cystatin M/E. CTSV and cystatin M/E both show a positive staining in the inner, mature cells of the sebaceous glands. In contrast to cystatin M/E and CTSV, the expression of legumain and CTSL was not limited to a specific cell layer but was found throughout all layers of the epidermis and its appendages (Fig. 3). Activation of TGase 3 by CTSL—In a previous study, we have found that lysosomal cysteine proteases are probably involved in the processing of human epidermal TGase 3 in vitro, suggesting that this could be a mechanism for activation. So far, the responsible proteases for this activation remained unknown. To address this issue more in depth at the functional level, recombinant human TGase 3 was incubated with a panel of recombinant human lysosomal cysteine proteases to investigate their proteolytic activity toward the zymogen form of TGase 3. We found that CTSL is able to proteolyze TGase 3 into 30- and 47-kDa fragments (Fig. 4A) in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. When the cathepsin inhibitor E-64 was added to the reaction mixture, no TGase 3 proteolysis could be detected. Other cathepsins were not able to cleave the TGase 3 zymogen in this experimental setup (Fig. 4, B–E), except in the case of longer incubation times with cathepsin S (Fig. 4C). In the presence of relatively high amounts of cathepsins B, S, and V in the reaction mixture (molar ratio of 1:10), TGase 3 was limitedly proteolyzed (data not shown). Next, we measured the enzymatic activity of the proteolyzed products of TGase 3 zymogen that was digested by CTSL. Although the TGase 3 zymogen showed no enzymatic activity, TGase proteolyzed by the action of CTSL demonstrated an apparent enzymatic activity (Fig. 5). N-terminal sequencing of the 30-kDa TGase 3 fragment revealed that the CTSL cleavage site in TGase 3 is before Ala467, two amino acids downstream as compared with the cleavage site generated by dispase digestion (Fig. 6).FIGURE 6Processing of TGase 3. The 77-kDa zymogen form of TGase 3 is proteolyzed into the activated form consisting of 30- and 47-kDa fragments, which then associate non-covalently to form the active enzyme (21Ahvazi B. Kim H.C. Kee S.H. Nemes Z. Steinert P.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2055-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The N-terminal sequence of the 30-kDa fragment of human TGase 3 was determined by automated Edman degradation. For comparison, we show the cleavage site of TGase 3 after digestion by dispase, a neutral bacterial protease that is commonly used to activate TGase 3 in vitro. The open and closed triangles represent the cleavage sites of dispase and CTSL digestion, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study, we show that the protease inhibitor cystatin M/E inhibits legumain and papain-like cysteine proteases due to two distinct nonoverlapping sites. The papain-like cysteine proteases CTSV and CTSL are strongly inhibited by cystatin M/E, suggesting that these proteases are new targets for cystatin M/E. Immunostaining of cystatin M/E, CTSV, CTSL, and legumain in normal human skin shows co-expression, especially in the stratum granulosum and the hair follicles, suggesting that these enzymes have an important role in human epidermal differentiation and hair follicle morphogenesis. Our data indicate that CTSL is the elusive protease that can process and activate TGase 3, an enzyme that is involved in cornified envelope formation. Based on the homology with cystatin D, we generated a three-dimensional model of cystatin M/E. This model shows that"

Recently, it was demonstrated that protein N-myristoylation could occur posttranslationally, as in the case of the pro-apoptotic protein BID and cytoskeletal actin. Our previous study showed that the N-terminal nine residues of the C-terminal caspase cleavage product of human gelsolin, an actin-regulatory protein, efficiently direct the protein N-myristoylation. In this study, to analyze the posttranslational N-myristoylation of gelsolin during apoptosis, metabolic labeling of gelsolin and its caspase cleavage products expressed in COS-1 cells with [3H]myristic acid was performed. It was found that the C-terminal caspase cleavage product of human gelsolin (tGelsolin) was efficiently N-myristoylated. When COS-1 cells transiently transfected with gelsolin cDNA were treated with etoposide or staurosporine, apoptosis-inducing agents, N-myristoylated tGelsolin was generated, as demonstrated by in vivo metabolic labeling. The generation of posttranslationally N-myristoylated tGelsolin during apoptosis was also observed on endogenous gelsolin expressed in HeLa cells. Immunofluorescence staining and subcellular fractionation experiment revealed that exogenously expressed tGelsolin did not localize to mitochondria but rather was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm. To study the role of this modification in the anti-apoptotic activity of tGelsolin, we constructed the bicistronic expression plasmid tGelsolin-IRES-EGFP capable of overexpressing tGelsolin concomitantly with EGFP. Overexpression of N-myristoylated tGelsolin in COS-1 cells using this plasmid significantly inhibited etoposide-induced apoptosis, whereas overexpression of the non-myristoylated tGelsolinG2A mutant did not cause resistance to apoptosis. These results indicate that posttranslational N-myristoylation of tGelsolin does not direct mitochondrial targeting, but this modification is involved in the anti-apoptotic activity of tGelsolin.

Protein N-myristoylation is a well recognized form of lipid modification that occurs on eukaryotic and viral proteins (1Towler D.A. Gordon J.I. Adams S.P. Glaser L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 69-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Spiegel A.M. Backlund P.S. Butrynski J.E. Jones T.L.Z. Simonds W.F. Trends Biochem.

Chem. 2001; 276: 39501-39504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Many N-myristoylated proteins play critical roles in regulating cellular structure and function. They include proteins involved in a wide variety of cellular signal transduction pathways such as protein kinases, phosphatases, guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, and Ca2+-binding proteins. In many cases, the functions of these N-myristoylated proteins are regulated by reversible protein-membrane and protein-protein interactions mediated by protein N-myristoylation. Generally, protein N-myristoylation is the result of cotranslational attachment of myristic acid, a 14-carbon saturated fatty acid, to a Gly residue at the extreme N terminus after removal of the initiating Met. A stable amide bond links myristic acid irreversibly to proteins. In addition to the cotranslational protein N-myristoylation, it was demonstrated that posttranslational protein N-myristoylation can also occur, as in the case of the pro-apoptotic protein BID. In this case, proteolytic cleavage of BID by caspase-8 caused exposure of an internal N-myristoylation motif (6Zha J. Weiler S. Oh K.-J. Wei M.C. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1761-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The exposed internal N-myristoylation motif was recognized by N-myristoyltransferase, the enzyme responsible for cotranslational N-myristoylation, and posttranslational N-myristoylation reaction occurred. It was also revealed that this postproteolytic N-myristoylation of BID plays critical role in the targeting of BID to mitochondria, its insertion into the outer membrane of mitochondria, the release of cytochrome c, and the killing of cells. Thus, posttranslational N-myristoylation plays a crucial role in the biological activity of BID.Until recently, BID was the only protein that had been demonstrated to be posttranslationally N-myristoylated. However, we recently showed that the C-terminal 15-kDa fragment of cytoskeletal actin is posttranslationally N-myristoylated upon caspase-mediated cleavage and specifically targeted to mitochondria (7Utsumi T. Sakurai N. Nakano K. Ishisaka R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 539: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In this case, tActin localized at mitochondria did not induce cellular apoptosis. The biological roles of the mitochondrial localization of tActin remain to be clarified. During the analysis of posttranslational N-myristoylation of tActin, we also found that the N-terminal nine residues of the newly exposed N terminus of the caspase cleavage product of human gelsolin, an actin-regulatory protein, efficiently direct the protein N-myristoylation. Gelsolin is a member of a large family of actin-severing and -capping proteins (8Yin H.L. Stossel T.P. Nature. 1979; 281: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 9Cunningham C.C.

The role of gelsolin in apoptosis is complicated by the fact that gelsolin is also a substrate for caspase-3, caspase-7, and caspase-9, which generate two cleavage products with opposite function, an N-terminal fragment with pro-apoptotic activity and a C-terminal fragment with anti-apoptotic activity (12Koya R.C.

The precise mechanisms by which the two fragments affect cellular apoptosis remain to be elucidated.In the present study, the posttranslational N-myristoylation of the caspase cleavage products of human gelsolin was studied by metabolic labeling using cells transfected with either full-length gelsolin or its N- or C-terminal cleavage products. The effects of posttranslational N-myristoylation of the C-terminal cleavage product of gelsolin (tGelsolin) 2The abbreviations used are: tGelsolin, truncated gelsolin; tActin, truncated actin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; DPBS, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; ECFP, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; VDAC, voltage-dependent anion channel; PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. 2The abbreviations used are: tGelsolin, truncated gelsolin; tActin, truncated actin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; DPBS, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; ECFP, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; VDAC, voltage-dependent anion channel; PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. on its intracellular targeting and on the anti-apoptotic activity were then investigated. The results showed that human tGelsolin was posttranslationally N-myristoylated upon caspase-mediated cleavage. This posttranslationally N-myristoylated tGelsolin was not targeted to mitochondria but rather was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm. Overexpression of N-myristoylated tGelsolin in COS-1 cells using the plasmid tGelsolin-IRES-EGFP significantly inhibited etoposide-induced apoptosis, whereas overexpression of the non-myristoylated tGelsolinG2A mutant did not cause resistance to apoptosis.These results indicated that posttranslational N-myristoylation of tGelsolin is involved in the anti-apoptotic activity of tGelsolin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Restriction endonucleases, DNA-modifying enzymes, RNase inhibitor, and Taq DNA polymerase were purchased from Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan.

Cells (2 × 105) were plated onto 35-mm diameter dishes 1 day before transfection. pcDNA3 or pIRES2(ΔB) construct (2 μg) containing cDNA coding for mutant gelsolin was used to transfect each plate of COS-1 cells along with 4 μl of Lipofectamine (2 mg/ml; Invitrogen) in 1 ml of serum-free medium. After incubation for 5 h at 37 °C, the cells were refed with serum-containing medium and incubated again at 37 °C for 48 h. The cells were then washed twice with 1 ml of serum-free DMEM and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in 1 ml of DMEM with 2% FCS containing [3H]myristic acid (100 μCi/ml). For the treatment with etoposide or staurosporine, 48 h after transfection, the cells were incubated with 200 nm etoposide or 2 μm staurosporine at 37 °C for 18 h in 1 ml of DMEM with 5% FCS containing [3H]myristic acid (100 μCi/ml). For the treatment with Z-VAD-fmk, the cells were pretreated with 100 μm Z-VAD-fmk for 3 h before addition of etoposide or staurosporine. Subsequently, the cells were washed three times with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) and collected with a cell scraper and then lysed with 200 μl of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and proteinase inhibitors) on ice for 20 min. After immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody, the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography.Western Blotting—The cell lysates of each group of transfected cells were prepared 48 h after transfection and resolved by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to an Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore). After blocking with nonfat milk, the membrane was probed with a specific anti-FLAG, anti-gelsolin, anti-protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI), anti-VDAC, anti-Hsp70, or anti-EGFP antibody as described previously (20Utsumi T.

Immunoreactive proteins were specifically detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein G (Bio-Rad). The membrane was developed with enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.).Immunoprecipitation—Samples were immunoprecipitated with a specific anti-FLAG or anti-gelsolin antibody as described in Ref. 17Utsumi T.

Thereafter, the gel was fixed and soaked in Amplify™ (Amersham Biosciences) for 20 min. The gel was dried under vacuum and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak) for an appropriate period.Immunofluorescence Analysis and Fluorescence Microscopy—Immunofluorescence analysis of transfected cells was performed 48 h after transfection. At this time, the maximum level of protein expression was achieved. For immunocyotochemistry, cells were washed with DPBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in DPBS for 15 min, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in DPBS for 10 min at room temperature, followed by washing with 0.1% gelatin in DPBS. The permeabilized cells were incubated with anti-FLAG antibody (1:1000) in DPBS for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with 0.1% gelatin in DPBS, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody or Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgG antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Mitochondria were identified by incubating the cells with 300 nm MitoTracker Red for 30 min before fixation. After washing with 0.1% gelatin in DPBS, the cells were observed under a Zeiss Axiovert fluorescence microscope.Subcellular Fractionation—Subcellular fractionation of COS-1 cells expressing either tGelsolin-FLAG or tGelsolinG2A-FLAG was performed by using ProteoExtract™ subcellular proteome extraction kit (Merck) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, COS-1 cells (2 × 105) were transfected with 2 μg of pcDNA3tGelsolin-FLAG or pcDNA3tGelsolinG2A-FLAG as described earlier and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. After washing twice with ice-cold Wash Buffer, cells were incubated with 0.5 ml of ice-cold Extraction Buffer I at 4 °C for 10 min, and then the supernatant was collected and used as a cytosolic fraction. Subsequently, cells were incubated with 0.5 ml of ice-cold Extraction Buffer II at 4 °C for 30 min, and then the supernatant was collected and used as a membrane/organelle fraction. The cells were then incubated with 0.5 ml ice-cold Extraction Buffer III at 4 °C for 10 min, then the supernatant was collected and used as a nucleic fraction.Induction and Detection of Apoptosis—The transfected COS-1 cells were incubated with 200 nm etoposide for 24 h. The cells were stained with 1 μm Hoechst 33342 and observed under a Zeiss Axiovert fluorescence microscope. The cell viability was assessed by examining the nuclear morphology. The numbers of total EGFP-positive cells and EGFP-positive cells showing apoptotic phenotype (Hoechst-positive cells) were counted, and the percent of apoptosis was calculated. In this case, 4-5 × 102 cells found in eight randomly selected area were counted in each sample and data are expressed as mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments.Detection of Generation of Posttranslationally N-Myristoylated tGelsolin from Endogenous Gelsolin—HeLa cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. The cells (6 × 105) were incubated with 2 μm staurosporine at 37 °C for 10 h in 1 ml of DMEM with 5% FCS containing 200 μCi [3H] myristic acid. For the treatment with Z-VAD-fmk, the cells were pretreated with 100 μm Z-VAD-fmk for 3 h before addition of staurosporine. After incubation, the cells were harvested and lysed with RIPA buffer as described earlier and gelsolin and tGelsolin were immunoprecipitated with anti-gelsolin C-terminal fragment antibody (GS-2C4, Sigma). The samples were then analyzed by Western blotting using anti-gelsolin antibody or by SDS-PAGE and fluorograpy.RESULTSN Terminus of C-terminal Caspase Cleavage Product of Gelsolin Is N-Myristoylated—Our previous study showed that the N-terminal nine residues of the C-terminal caspase cleavage product of human gelsolin (tGelsolin) efficiently direct the protein N-myristoylation (7Utsumi T. Sakurai N. Nakano K. Ishisaka R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 539: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To confirm that the full-length tGelsolin is N-myristoylated, cDNAs coding for epitope-tagged gelsolin and tGelsolin were generated and their susceptibility to protein N-myristoylation was evaluated by metabolic labeling in transfected cells. For these analyses, a FLAG-tag was introduced at the C terminus of these constructs. As shown in Fig. 1A, lane 2, transfection of COS-1 cells with cDNA coding for FLAG-tagged tGelsolin gave rise to a 44-kDa protein band with the expected molecular mass (42-kDa tGelsolin plus 2-kDa linker and FLAG-tag). The 44-kDa protein band was efficiently N-myristoylated, as determined by [3H]myristic acid labeling (Fig. 1A, lane 6). When Gly2 of tGelsolin-FLAG was replaced with Ala (tGelsolinG2A-FLAG), no incorporation of [3H]myristic acid into this mutant was observed despite the effective expression of this protein, as shown in Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 7. Transfection of cDNAs coding for full-length gelsolin (gelsolin-FLAG) and the N-terminal fragment of gelsolin (N-gelsolin-FLAG) gave rise to protein bands with the expected molecular mass (88 and 44 kDa, respectively). [3H]Myristic acid incorporation into these proteins was not observed (Fig. 1A, lanes 1, 4, 5, and 8). As shown in Fig. 1B, the efficiency of [3H]myristic acid incorporation ([3H]myristic acid labeling/Western blotting) into tGelsolin-FLAG (lanes 3 and 6) was comparable with that into tActin-FLAG (lanes 2 and 5) and Gi1α-TNF-FLAG (lanes 1 and 4) having the N-myristoylation motif of Gi1α protein at its N terminus (20Utsumi T. Sato M. Nakano K. Takemura D. Iwata H. Ishisaka R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10505-10513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), indicating that tGelsolin-FLAG is efficiently N-myristoylated.Induction of Apoptosis Induces the Generation of Posttranslationally N-Myristoylated tGelsolin—To determine whether the intracellular generation of N-myristoylated tGelsolin is induced by caspase-mediated cleavage of gelsolin during apoptosis, COS-1 cells transfected with FLAG-tagged gelsolin were treated with etoposide or staurosporine, apoptosis-inducing agents, and the generation of N-myristoylated tGelsolin was examined by Western blotting and [3H]myristic acid labeling. As shown in Fig. 2A, lanes 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9, the generation of N-myristoylated tGelsolin was induced by the treatment of cells with 200 nm etoposide or 2 μm staurosporine. The induction of the generation of the N-myristoylated tGelsolin was completely inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with 100 μm Z-VAD-fmk, a caspase inhibitor, before addition of etoposide or staurosporine (Fig. 2A, lanes 3, 5, 8, and 10). To determine whether the generation of posttranslationally N-myristoylated tGelsolin was observed on endogenous gelsolin during apoptosis, HeLa cells were treated with staurosporine, and the generation of N-myristoylated tGelsolin was examined. As shown in Fig. 2B, the generation of N-myristoylated tGelsolin was induced by the treatment of cells with 2 μm staurosporine (lanes 2 and 5), and this induction was completely inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with 100 μm Z-VAD-fmk (lanes 3 and 6). These results strongly indicate that the generation of N-myristoylated tGelsolin is induced by caspase-mediated cleavage of gelsolin during apoptosis.FIGURE 2Induction of apoptosis induces the generation of N-myristoylated tGelsolin. A, COS-1 cells transfected with cDNA coding for gelsolin-FLAG were incubated with 200 nm etoposide or 2 μm staurosporine (STS) at 37 °C for 18 h in 1 ml of DMEM with 5% FCS containing [3H]myristic acid (100 μCi/ml). For treatment with Z-VAD-fmk, the cells were pretreated with 100 μm Z-VAD-fmk for 3 h before the addition of etoposide or staurosporine. Left panel, total cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody. Right panel, following immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody, the labeled proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. B, HeLa cells were incubated with 2 μm staurosporine at 37 °C for 10 h in 1 ml of DMEM with 5% FCS containing 200 μCi of [3H]myristic acid. After incubation, the cells were harvested and lysed with RIPA buffer, and gelsolin and tGelsolin were immunoprecipitated with anti-gelsolin C-terminal fragment antibody. For the treatment with Z-VAD-fmk, the cells were pretreated with 100 μm Z-VAD-fmk for 3 h before addition of staurosporine. Left panel, the samples were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-gelsolin C-terminal antibody. Right panel, the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Exogenously Expressed tGelsolin Does Not Localize to Mitochondria— Previous studies showed that both N-myristoylated tBID and tActin colocalize with mitochondria in an N-myristoylation-dependent manner (6Zha J.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 539: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These results indicate that posttranslational N-myristoylation might function as a mitochondrial-targeting signal. To examine whether the exogenously expressed N-myristoylated tGelsolin colocalizes with mitochondria or not, immunofluorescence staining coupled with staining with MitoTracker, a mitochondria-specific dye, was performed. As observed previously, exogenously expressed tActin colocalized with mitochondria, as shown in Fig. 3, a and b. In contrast, the distribution of exogenously expressed tGelsolin detected by immunofluorescence staining were distinct from that of MitoTracker, indicating that tGelsolin does not colocalize with mitochondria (Fig. 3, c and d). To determine whether the exogenously expressed tGelsolin colocalizes with endoplasmic reticulum or not, tGelsolin-FLAG was coexpressed with"

The colicin formed “small” conductance 60-picosiemens (pS) channels, with properties similar to those previously characterized, in 1,2-dieicosenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (C20) or thinner membranes, whereas it formed a novel “large” conductance 600-pS state in thicker 1,2-dierucoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (C22) bilayers. Both channel states were anion-selective and voltage-gated and displayed a requirement for acidic pH. Lipids having negative spontaneous curvature inhibited the formation of both channels but increased the ratio of open 600 pS to 60 pS conductance states. Different diameters of small and large channels, 12 and 16 Å, were determined from the dependence of single-channel conductance on the size of nonelectrolyte solute probes. Colicin-induced lipid “flip-flop” and the decrease in anion selectivity of the channel in the presence of negatively charged lipids implied a significant contribution of lipid to the structure of the channel, most readily described as toroidal organization of lipid and protein to form the channel pore.

Channel-forming proteins can require specific lipids, presumably because of a combination of charge and curvature parameters, to form active channels (e.g. anionic lipid bound between the transmembrane α-helices and necessary for gating of the KcsA channel (20Valiyaveetil F.I.

The lantibiotic nisin provides a well defined example of lipid participation in peptide pore formation, in which the peptidoglycan precursor lipid II is an intrinsic component of the pore formed by this antimicrobial peptide (22Hsu S.T.

The proposed structure of this pore contains 5-8 nisin molecules and an identical number of lipid II molecules (23Breukink E. van Heusden H.E. Vollmerhaus P.J. Swiezewska E. Brunner L. Walker S.

Colicin E1, which is the subject of the present study, unfolds on the lipid membrane surface to form a surface-bound two-dimensional flexible helical array that is a precursor state to the inserted channel (32Zakharov S.D.

The channel domain subsequently inserts into the membrane and forms ion-conducting pores that are voltage-dependent (29Schein S.J. Kagan B.L. Finkelstein A. Nature. 1978; 276: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 30Lakey J.H. Slatin S.L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2001; 257: 131-161PubMed Google Scholar, 34Cramer W.A. Heymann J.B.

These pore-forming colicins are remarkable for the fact that the formation of ion channels, as studied for colicin Ia, leads to voltage-gated translocation across the planar bilayer membrane of a large part of the colicin polypeptide (35Slatin S.L. Qiu X.Q. Jakes K.S. Finkelstein A. Nature. 1994; 371: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 36Jakes K.S. Kienker P.K. Finkelstein A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1999; 32: 189-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The actual transmembrane structure of the colicin pores and the details of the translocation mechanism are not known at present. It has been inferred that the colicin Ia channel consists of three and four transmembrane (TM) helices, respectively, for the C-terminal pore-forming domain of colicin Ia and the intact colicin (37Kienker P.K. Jakes K.S. Finkelstein A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 587-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A concern about this model is the structural sufficiency of three transmembrane helices for a stable and functional channel. An additional concern about all channel models of the pore-forming colicins is that the predicted length, 15-17 residues, of the two putative TM helices that form the hydrophobic hairpin anchor, two of the 3-4 helices in the channel structure, is appreciably shorter than the length of the average TM helix (∼20 residues) of integral membrane proteins (38Kyte J.

A structural role of lipids in peptide-induced pore formation was implied by the sensitivity of the membrane-permeabilizing activity of the peptides to the lipid SC (40Matsuzaki K. Sugishita K.

Based on the SC dependence of colicin E1 macroscopic channel activity in bilayer lipid membranes, it has been proposed (43Sobko A.A. Kotova E.A. Antonenko Y.N. Zakharov S.D. Cramer W.A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 576: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 44Zakharov S.D. Kotova E.A. Antonenko Y.N. Cramer W.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar), may be applicable to the channel structure of the pore-forming colicins. This model assumes that the pore walls are formed not only by peptide α-helices but also by head-groups of the bilayer-forming phospholipids. Recently, the correlation between the pore forming potency of peptides and the SC of the lipid as a support for the toroidal model was questioned, based on similar correlations exhibited by melittin and alamethicin (49Lee M.T. Hung W.C. Chen F.Y. Huang H.W. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 4006-4016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was of importance to obtain additional lines of evidence for the toroidal pore formation in the case of colicin E1. In the present work, the effect of lipid chain length and SC on single channels formed by colicin E1 was studied. A novel “large” channel state of the colicin E1 channel was described, whose conductance is greater by an order of magnitude than that of the “small” channel, many of whose properties have previously been reported in the literature (34Cramer W.A. Heymann J.B. Schendel S.L. Deriy B.N. Cohen F.S. Elkins P.A. Stauffacher C.V. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 611-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 50Cleveland M.V.

Proteins. 1986; 1: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Membrane thickness was found to be a major determinant of the ratio of the two (“low” and “high” conductance) states, since the open probability of the high conductance state increased with membrane thickness. A strong peptide-lipid interaction was also inferred from the observations of colicin E1-induced lipid flip-flop and the dramatic sensitivity of the channel conductance to lipid surface charge in 1 m KCl. Colicin E1—The 522-residue colicin E1 was prepared as previously described (55Zhang Y.L. Cramer W.A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1666-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The 178-residue C-terminal colicin E1 channel polypeptide, P178, was prepared by thermolysin proteolysis of intact colicin E1 (56Bishop L.J. Bjes E.S. Davidson V.L. Cramer W.A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 237-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Liposomes—Liposomes were prepared by evaporation under a stream of nitrogen of a 2% solution of a DPhPC/DPhPG mixture (70%/30%) in chloroform (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) followed by hydration with a buffer solution containing 10 mm β-alanine, 0.12 m KCl, pH 4.0. The mixture was vortexed, passed through a cycle of freezing and thawing, and extruded through 0.1-μm pore size Nucleopore polycarbonate membranes using an Avanti Mini-Extruder. The measurement of lipid flip-flop was performed as described by Müller et al. (57Müller P. Schiller S. Wieprecht T. Dathe M. Herrmann A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2000; 106: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To label vesicles with synthetic lipid probe 1-lauroyl-2-(1′pyrenebutyroyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (pyPC) exclusively on the outer leaflet, 15 μm pyPC dissolved in ethanol was added to the buffer solution containing liposomes (final lipid concentration 300 μm). Incorporation of pyPC into the outer membrane leaflet was followed by measuring the ratio of fluorescence intensities of monomers (IM) and excimers (IE) at 395 and 495 nm, respectively. The fluorescence was excited at 344 nm. Planar Bilayer Lipid Membranes (BLMs)—BLMs were formed from a 2% solution of lipid in squalene, hexadecane, or decane by the brush technique on a 0.5-mm diameter hole in a Teflon partition separating two compartments of a cell containing aqueous solutions of 1 m KCl, 10 mm CH3COOK, pH 4.0 (unless otherwise stated). All lipids used in the present work (1,2-dinervonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DNvPC (C24:1)), 1,2-dierucoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DErPC (C22:1)), 1,2-dieicosenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DEcPC (C20:1)), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC (C18:1 cis)), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE (C18)), 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPhPC (C16)), and 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)) (DPhPG (C16))) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). The electrical current (I) was measured with a patch clamp amplifier (model BC-525C; Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT), digitized by a LabPC 1200 (National Instruments, Austin, TX), and analyzed by a personal computer with the help of Clampex (Axon) and WinWCP Strathclyde electrophysiology software designed by J. Dempster (University of Strathclyde). The current was low pass-filtered with a cut-off frequency of 100 Hz. In most experiments, a voltage of 80 mV (trans-negative) was applied to BLM to open the channels with Ag-AgCl electrodes placed directly into the cell. C-terminal colicin peptide (P178) or intact colicin E1 was added to, and defined, the cis side of the membrane. Agar-agar bridges connecting the electrodes and the membrane bathing solutions were used in selectivity measurements. Two conductance states of very different sizes are present in the recording of colicin E1 channel-forming domain (P178) in a DPhPC/decane membrane (Fig. 1A). Histograms of the channel current (Fig. 1B) and lifetime (Fig. 1C) show the high conductance state to be characterized by a single-channel conductance of 590 ± 10 pS (mean ± S.E., n = 13) and a lifetime of 120 ± 30 ms (single exponential fit, S.D.), whereas small channels have a conductance of 65 ± 2 pS (n = 13) and a lifetime of 4 ± 1 s (n = 18). The latter value was calculated as an average from a series of the recordings, because of the distortion of a histogram by simultaneous opening of several small channels. It is important to note that the high conductance state never appeared unless at least one small channel was already open (i.e. opening of the large (600-pS) channel required the formation and prior existence of the low conductance state). This implies that high conductance 600-pS channels are formed from 60-pS “precursor” channel. Both conductance states displayed the same voltage dependence; they were opened by a cis-positive voltage and closed when the sign of the voltage was reversed (Fig. 1D), which is characteristic for colicin-induced macroscopic current (51Bullock J.O. Cohen F.S. Dankert J.R. Cramer W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9908-9912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conductance states of the two types, normal and high, with a single-channel conductance and lifetime similar to those of the 178-residue C-terminal channel-forming domain, P178, were also observed for intact colicin E1 (data not shown). It was shown previously that P178 or C-terminal peptides of similar size retain the channel-forming ability of the intact protein to form the “small” channels (50Cleveland M.V. Slatin S. Finkelstein A. Levinthal C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3706-3710Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 51Bullock J.O. Cohen F.S. Dankert J.R. Cramer W.A. J. Biol.

Effect of Lipid Solvent—It is known that DPhPC/squalene membranes are solvent-free and substantially thinner than DPhPC/decane membranes (60White S.H. Biophys. J. 1978; 23: 337-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 61Uhrikova D. Kucerka N. Islamov A. Kuklin A. Gordeliy V. Balgavy P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1611: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2A, a typical single-channel recording of P178 in a DPhPC/squalene membrane contains only low amplitude transitions corresponding to the 60-pS conductance state. This contrasts with the presence of 600-pS channels in DPhPC/decane membrane (Fig. 2B). Both recordings contained up to three active channels. Apparently, the activity of the 600-pS channel state observed in Fig. 2B was increased significantly compared with that reported in Fig. 1A. This can be attributed to the presence of three 60-pS channels in this recording, whereas only one channel was active in the data of Fig. 1A. Quantitative analysis of the open probability of the 600-pS conductance state (Po) under these conditions showed that Po was proportional to an average number of active 60-pS channels, m, estimated according to the equation, m = (1/Λ) × (ΣiIiMi/ΣiMi), where Mi is the number of events with current Ii (Fig. 1B), and Λ is the current amplitude of the 60-pS channel. This linear dependence (Po on m) confirms the conclusion that the opening of the 60-pS channel is a precondition for the opening of a high conductance state. Effect of Lipid Chain Length—The appearance of a high conductance state in decane-containing membranes can be associated either with the presence of solvent or with an increase in bilayer thickness. To discriminate between these possibilities, single-channel measurements were performed with solvent-free membranes formed of lipids with fatty acyl tails of different lengths. As seen from the recordings depicted in Fig. 2 (C and D), both low and high conductance states of P178 appeared in DErPC (C22)/squalene membranes (Fig. 2D), whereas in DEcPC (C20)/squalene membranes (Fig. 2C) only the low conductance state was observed. These data support the idea that the formation of the high conductance state of colicin channels requires a sufficiently thick membrane. The thickness of a bilayer increases by 3-3.5 Å for each 2-carbon increase in the length of the hydrocarbon chains (62Lewis B.A. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). The presence of a double bond with the cis orientation results in thinning of the bilayer by 2.5 Å. Table 1 summarizes the average conductance of the large and small colicin conductance states observed for different membrane lipid compositions. The channel activity of P178 was not observed in very thick DNvPC (C24)/squalene membranes (data not shown), which would confer a large hydrophobic mismatch.TABLE 1Average conductance (in pS) of the 60-pS/600-pS state in membranes of different compositionLipidChannel conductanceSqualeneHexadecaneDecanepSDOPE (C18:1)NTaNT, not testedNT58 ± 4/563 ± 16DPhPC (C16:0)66 ± 1/NObNO, not observed (this conductance state was absent)56 ± 2/555 ± 565 ± 2/590 ± 10DOPC (C18:1)NTNT65 ± 2/620 ± 7DEcPC (C20:1)77 ± 3/NO48 ± 2/535 ± 752 ± 2/555 ± 3DErPC (C22:1)30 ± 4cThis conductance state had a broad peak in the current histogram, suggesting that there was fast flickering between open and closed states or the existence of many substates that closed too rapidly to be resolved/480 ± 4NO/NONO/NODNvPC (C24:1)NO/NONTNTa NT, not testedb NO, not observed (this conductance state was absent)c This conductance state had a broad peak in the current histogram, suggesting that there was fast flickering between open and closed states or the existence of many substates that closed too rapidly to be resolved Open table in a new tab The presence of decane solvent down-shifted the acyl chain length boundary, from 20/22 to 18/20, between the small and large channels of P178. From the single-channel recordings of P178 in DOPC (C18)/decane (Fig. 2E) and DEcPC (C20)/decane (Fig. 2F) membranes and the corresponding data presented in Table 2, it is seen that the increase in membrane thickness led to an increase in both the open state probability of the high conductance state, from 0.25 ± 0.1 to 46 ± 4% and the single-channel lifetime from 100 ± 60 ms (n = 16) for C18 to 300 ± 200 ms (n = 12) for C20. No channel activity of the P178 channel domain was observed in DErPC (C22)/decane membranes (Table 2).TABLE 2Open state probability (in percent) of 600-pS channels in membranes of different lipid and solvent compositions The probability was normalized to the average number of open 60-pS channels (m) in the records, the number was estimated from the current histogram according to the equation, m = (1/Λ) × (ΣiIiMi/ΣiMi) (see “Results”).

J. 2003; 84: 238-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, P178 showed the 600-pS high conductance state in DEcPC (C20)/hexadecane and DPhPC/hexadecane membranes. However, the open probability of this conductance state was smaller than in the corresponding decane membranes (Table 2). It should be noted that values of the open probability of the high conductance state presented in Table 2 were normalized to the mean number of open 60-pS channels, since it was established that the populations of the two kinds of conductance states are proportional to each other (data not shown). In summary, it was concluded that the occurrence of high conductance 600-pS channels of P178 is facilitated by increased membrane thickness. Colicin E1-induced macroscopic current across BLM is sensitive to SC of the lipids comprising the membrane (43Sobko A.A. Kotova E.A. Antonenko Y.N. Zakharov S.D. Cramer W.A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 576: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, it was important to determine how the SC regulates the colicin E1-induced currents on the single-channel level. Because preparation of planar membranes from lipids with a defined positive curvature is not experimentally feasible, comparisons of the effect of membranes of lipids with different curvature necessarily involve membranes with lipids of neutral or different degrees of negative curvature. By measuring the time course of the appearance of single channels after the addition of P178 to the bathing solution, we compared the kinetics of colicin insertion into membranes formed from lipids with different degrees of negative curvature (i.e. with relatively low (DOPC (C18)/decane) and high (DOPE (C18)/decane) negative SC (65Chen Z. Rand R.P. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 267-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar)). The insertion proceeded much faster in the membrane with lipids having the smaller negative SC (data not shown). Because the binding of P178 to membranes"
https://openalex.org/W2171920896,"Membrane fusion and protein trafficking to the vacuole are complex processes involving many proteins and lipids. Cytosol from Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains a high Mr activity, which stimulates the in vitro homotypic fusion of isolated yeast vacuoles. Here we purify this activity and identify it as enolase (Eno1p and Eno2p). Enolase is a cytosolic glycolytic enzyme, but a small portion of enolase is bound to vacuoles. Recombinant Eno1p or Eno2p stimulates in vitro vacuole fusion, as does a catalytically inactive mutant enolase, suggesting a role for enolase in fusion that is separate from its glycolytic function. Either deletion of the non-essential ENO1 gene or diminished expression of the essential ENO2 gene causes vacuole fragmentation in vivo, reflecting reduced fusion. Combining an ENO1 deletion with ENO2-deficient expression causes a more severe fragmentation phenotype. Vacuoles from enolase 1 and 2-deficient cells are unable to fuse in vitro. Immunoblots of vacuoles from wild type and mutant strains reveal that enolase deficiency also prevents normal protein sorting to the vacuole, exacerbating the fusion defect. Band 3 has been shown to bind glycolytic enzymes to membranes of mammalian erythrocytes. Bor1p, the yeast band 3 homolog, localizes to the vacuole. Its loss results in the mislocalization of enolase and other vacuole fusion proteins. These studies show that enolase stimulates vacuole fusion and that enolase and Bor1p regulate selective protein trafficking to the vacuole.

Either deletion of the non-essential ENO1 gene or diminished expression of the essential ENO2 gene causes vacuole fragmentation in vivo, reflecting reduced fusion. Combining an ENO1 deletion with ENO2-deficient expression causes a more severe fragmentation phenotype. Vacuoles from enolase 1 and 2-deficient cells are unable to fuse in vitro. Immunoblots of vacuoles from wild type and mutant strains reveal that enolase deficiency also prevents normal protein sorting to the vacuole, exacerbating the fusion defect. Band 3 has been shown to bind glycolytic enzymes to membranes of mammalian erythrocytes. Bor1p, the yeast band 3 homolog, localizes to the vacuole. Its loss results in the mislocalization of enolase and other vacuole fusion proteins. These studies show that enolase stimulates vacuole fusion and that enolase and Bor1p regulate selective protein trafficking to the vacuole. Proteins and lipids are delivered to subcellular compartments through selective budding from a donor organelle, traffic through the cytosol, and docking and fusion to the target compartment. The mechanism and components involved in membrane fusion are conserved from yeast to human. Yeast homotypic vacuole fusion is a particularly convenient model for dissecting this process, given the facile isolation of pure vacuoles and the well developed genetics of this organism. Vacuoles fission and fuse in the cell in response to osmotic stimuli (1Bone N. Millar J.B. Toda T. Armstrong J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 135-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Defects in fusion allow unbalanced fission and, hence, a phenotype of vacuole fragmentation (2Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18665-18670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, the fusion of purified vacuoles can be monitored by assays measuring the resulting mixing of compartments (3Haas A. Methods Cell Sci. 1995; 17: 283-294Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Using this in vitro vacuole fusion assay, we have previously reported that yeast cytosol contains two fractions that stimulate fusion, a low Mr activity and a high Mr activity, termed HMA 2The abbreviations used are: HMA, high Mr activity; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate.

Although they both function as glycolytic enzymes, ENO2 is essential, whereas ENO1 is non-essential (7McAlister L. Holland M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7181-7188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Holland M.J. Holland J.P. Thill G.P. Jackson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1385-1395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because band 3, an integral membrane protein, binds glycolytic proteins to the membrane of human erythrocytes (9Campanella M.E. Chu H. Low P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2402-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), we looked for a similar protein in yeast that might be responsible for the localization of cytosolic enolase to the vacuole. Bor1p has sequence homology to band 3, but little is known of its function (10Frommer W.B. von Wiren N. Nature. 2002; 420: 282-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We show here that Bor1 is localized to vacuoles and that its loss results in defects in the localization of proteins, including enolase, to the vacuole. Vacuoles were isolated from yeast strains BJ3505 (MATa ura3-52 trp1-101 his3-D 200 lys2-801 trp1-D 101 (gal3) can1 gal2 prb1-D1.6R pep4::HIS3) (11Jones E.W.

The R11258 derivative YSC1180-7429015 (pENO2::kanR-tet07-TATA URA3::CMV-tTA MATa his3-1 leu2-0 met15-0) (Openbiosystems) was used to generate BDY3 (YSC1180-7429015 pep4::leu eno1::met15) and BDY4 (YSC1180-7429015 pho8::leu eno1::met15). The integrating vector pRS403 (13Kahana J.A. Silver P. Chalfie M. Kain S. Green Fluorescent Protein: Properties, Applications, and Protocols. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1998Google Scholar) containing LEU flanked by upstream and downstream regions of either the PEP4 or PHO8 gene was transformed into the YSC1180-7429015 strain (14Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4173) Google Scholar). The resulting strains, BDY1 and BDY2, respectively, were confirmed by PCR and immunoblotting (14Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4173) Google Scholar). BDY1 and BDY2 were then transformed with the integrating vector pRS403 containing MET15 flanked by upstream and downstream regions of ENO1. The resulting strains, BDY3 and BDY4, respectively, were confirmed by PCR and immunoblotting. Vacuole Isolation and in Vitro Fusion Assay—Unless otherwise indicated, vacuoles were isolated from yeast strains BJ3505 and DKY6281 for in vitro fusion (12Haas A. Conradt B. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Where indicated, vacuole suspensions were mixed with 0.2 volume of 50% glycerol and 10 mm Pipes-KOH, pH 6.8, 200 mm sorbitol to final concentration of 3 μg/μl and frozen dropwise in liquid N2. Fusion reactions (40 μl) contained 3 μg of vacuoles lacking the protease Pep4p, 3 μg of vacuoles from cells without Pho8p, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Pipes-KOH, pH 6.8, 1 mm ATP, 40 mm creatine phosphate, 0.5 mg/ml creatine kinase, and 10 μm coenzyme A. Fusion reactions with frozen vacuoles also contained 83 mm NH4Cl and 200 mm sorbitol; reactions with fresh BJ3505 and DKY6281 vacuoles contained 98 mm KCl and 455 mm sorbitol, whereas those with fresh BDY3 and BDY4 vacuoles had 98 mm KCl and 200 mm sorbitol. Fusion assays were incubated for 90 min at 27 °C, and fusion was measured by assaying alkaline phosphatase (6Slusarewicz P. Xu Z. Seefeld K. Haas A. Wickner W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5582-5587Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recombinant Proteins—ENO2 and ENO1 sequences were amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using oligonucleotide primers containing flanking BamH1 and XhoI sequences. Digested PCR products were ligated into “parallel” vectors (25Sheffield P. Garrard S. Derewenda Z. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 15: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) for fusion to GST (GST-Eno1 and GST-Eno2) or His6 (His6-Eno1 and His6-Eno2). GST-H159A Eno2 was made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). Expression in Escherichia coli was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (3 h, 37 °C). The cells were harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen pellets were resuspended in 2 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8) per g of cell pellet. Lysozyme (1 mg/ml) was added, and the mixture incubated on ice for 30 min. The cells were broken in a 350 Sonicator (Heatsystems Ultrasonics). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (23,000 × g,30min, 4 °C) and 20× phosphate-buffered saline was added to obtain 1× phosphate-buffered saline lysate. Extracts (80 ml) containing GST fusion proteins were batch-bound to 2 ml of settled-volume of phosphate-buffered saline-equilibrated glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow resin (Amersham Biosciences) on a rocker shaker at 4 °C for 1 h. Resin was washed with phosphate-buffered saline (20 ml). GST-Eno1p, -Eno2p, and -H159A Eno2p were eluted in 3 × 1.5-ml batches of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm reduced glutathione. His6 fusion proteins were isolated from soluble extracts using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Eluted proteins were dialyzed into 10 mm Pipes-KOH, pH 6.8, 200 mm sorbitol for vacuole fusion analysis. Tetracycline-repressable Strains—Unless otherwise noted, all tetracycline-repressible strains were obtained from OpenBiosystems. These strains were grown in 2% yeast peptone dextrose at 30 °C, and proteins were repressed with the addition of doxycycline (Sigma) dissolved at 10 mg/ml in EtOH. All experiments were performed at least three times with consistent results. To identify factors involved in yeast vacuole fusion, we fractionated yeast cytosol and monitored the ability of fractions to stimulate in vitro vacuole fusion. Although freshly isolated vacuoles do not require cytosol or added components for fusion, the harsher procedure used to make frozen vacuoles (4Xu Z. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) yields vacuoles, which are more responsive to cytosol and added purified components. Freezing the vacuoles may remove or denature fusion factors or may partially permeabilize the vacuoles; cytosolic factors could rescue such a defect. Gel filtration of cytosol yields two peaks of activity, of high and low Mr, which stimulate in vitro fusion of frozen vacuoles (4Xu Z. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We have previously identified the low Mr activities as thioredoxin and IB2 (4Xu Z. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 9Campanella M.E. Chu H. Low P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2402-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). To identify the HMA, proteins from K-91 yeast cytosol were resolved (Table 1) by HR400 gel filtration. Fractions were tested for their ability to stimulate in vitro vacuole fusion. HMA emerged after the bulk of cytosolic proteins near 60 kDa (data not shown). This fraction was concentrated 10-fold by lyophilization and further separated by Q-Sepharose Fast Flow. The HMA activity was in the unbound fraction. HMA was further resolved by butyl-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow and by Green 19 chromatography. A silver-stained gel showed a dominant band in the active fractions (Fig. 1). This band was excised and identified by reverse-phase HPLC nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry as a mixture of enolase 1 and enolase 2.TABLE 1Purification of HMA Concentrated suspensions of K-91 yeast cells were frozen drop-wise in liquid nitrogen, lysed by blender (Waring Commercial) in liquid N2, and stored at –80 °C. The lysates were then thawed and centrifuged (8,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and 30 ml of supernatant was applied to a 1L HR400 Gel Filtration (Amersham Biosciences) column (equilibrated in 10 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 9.5-ml fractions). Each fraction was assayed for stimulation of in vitro vacuole fusion, and the active fractions were pooled. These fractions were lyophilized, resuspended in 0.1 volume of water, and dialyzed into 10 mm Pipes-KOH, pH 6.8, using regenerated cellulose dialysis tubing with a nominal Mr cut off of 3,500 (Fisherbrand). The resulting fraction was adjusted to pH 8 by the addition of 10 n KOH and applied to a 2.5-ml Q Sepharose Fast Flow column. The fusion-stimulatory activity was in the unbound fractions. The active fraction was then adjusted to 4 m NaCl, 200 mm sorbitol, 10 mm Pipes, pH 9, and applied to a butyl-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow column equilibrated in 4 m NaCl, 200 mm sorbitol, 10 mm Pipes-KOH, pH 9. Fractions were dialyzed in to 200 mm sorbitol, 10 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, using regenerated cellulose dialysis tubing and tested for activity in the in vitro fusion assay. The active fraction (unbound) was then applied to a 3.8-ml Reactive Green 19 (Sigma) column and eluted with 0.2 m NH4Cl, 200 mm sorbitol, 10 mm Pipes-KOH, pH 6.8 (750-μl fractions). Active fractions were pooled. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). One unit of fusion stimulatory activity increases the in vitro fusion assay signal by 0.1 A400 nm.StepVolumeProteinFusion stimulatory activitySpecific activityPurificationmlmgunitsunits/mgfoldI.

To determine whether enolase is also on the vacuole, we performed immunoblot analysis of isolated vacuoles using anti-Eno1-His6 antibody (which recognizes both Eno1p and Eno2p), anti-Vam7 antibody, and anti-Cdc48 antibody. As expected, Vam7p is predominantly on the vacuole, whereas Cdc48p is largely absent from vacuoles. Using scanning densitometry, we found enolase to be present on vacuoles (Fig. 2) at ∼1 ng/100 ng of total vacuolar protein. To directly test whether enolase is HMA or a contaminant that had co-purified with HMA, we tested recombinant enolase for its capacity to stimulate in vitro vacuole fusion (Fig. 3A). Eno1p-His6, Eno1p-GST, Eno2p-His6, and Eno2p-GST stimulated in vitro vacuole fusion in a dose-dependent manner. H159A Eno2p-GST, a point mutant deficient in glycolytic enzymatic activity (15Vinarov D.A. Nowak T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12138-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), has comparable activity to the wild type Eno2p-GST (Fig. 3B). As controls we note that adding similar amounts of bovine serum albumin gave no stimulation and adding Vam7p, a known vacuolar fusion protein, stimulated in vitro fusion 5-fold (data not shown). As further confirmation that enolase is not acting through glycolysis, we noted that fusion was not affected by 2-phosphoglycerate (an enolase substrate), other glycolytic enzymes (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, or pyruvate kinase), or inhibitors of glycolysis (2-deoxy-d-glucose or quercetin) (data not shown). Thus enolase is the active component in the purified HMA fraction but does not act through glycolysis. To test the role of enolase in vacuole fusion in vivo, we assessed the ability of cells lacking enolase to maintain normal vacuole structure. Because Eno2p is essential for cell viability, we obtained a strain with a tetracycline-repressible promoter substituted for the native ENO2 promoter to assess how the loss of Eno2p affects vacuole fusion. When grown in the presence of varied concentrations of tetracycline, these cells showed a dose-dependent decrease in the amount of enolase protein, as monitored by immunoblot (Fig. 4A). This decrease in enolase was accompanied by vacuole fragmentation (Fig. 4B). Cells in which the tetracycline-repressible promoter was inserted into the promoters of known fusion factors, Erg25p (an ergosterol biosynthetic enzyme) and Sec17p, showed increased vacuole fragmentation during tetracycline repression (Fig. 5). Strains in which ENO1 is deleted are deficient in vacuole fusion, resulting in a fragmented vacuole phenotype in 41% of cells (Fig. 6B). Without added inhibitor, 26% of cells from the eno2-tetR strain have fragmented vacuoles, reflecting the fact that the tetracycline-repressible promoter is considerably weaker than the normal ENO2 promoter. When the loss of Eno1p is combined with a deficiency in Eno2p (eno1Δ, eno2-tetR), 97% of the cells show highly fragmented vacuoles (Fig. 6, A and B). This clearly indicates an in vivo role for enolase in maintaining normal vacuole structure. Vacuoles from pep4Δ and pho8Δ derivatives (BDY3 and BDY4, respectively) of the eno1Δ, eno2-tetR strain were unable to fuse in vitro and fusion was not restored by the addition of either Eno2p-GST or Vam7p (Fig. 6C). The lack of stimulation by enolase suggests additional fusion defects in these vacuoles in addition to the loss of enolase. The resistance to Vam7p, a strong activator of fusion, supports the concept of multiple defects resulting from lowered levels of enolase. To determine whether these fusion defects are because of a vacuolar deficiency in other fusion factors, lysates and vacuoles were assayed by immunoblot (Fig. 7) for relevant vacuolar proteins. Using scanning densitometry, we found 76% less enolase in the cell lysate and at least 80% less enolase on the vacuoles of enolase-deficient cells than in the cell lysate or on the vacuoles of the wild type cells. Many proteins (CPY, Pep4p, Sec17p, and Ypt7p) were present at the same levels on wild type and enolase-deficient vacuoles, indicating that vacuoles were formed and isolated intact. However, other proteins involved in vacuole fusion (Sec18p, Vps33p, Vam6p, Vti1p, Vam3p, and Nyv1p) were present at normal levels in enolase-deficient cells but were only found on the vacuoles at reduced levels.FIGURE 5Vacuole fragmentation in vivo.

What is the receptor for enolase association with vacuoles? Band 3 has been shown to localize glycolytic enzymes to the membranes of human erythrocytes (9Campanella M.E. Chu H. Low P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2402-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The yeast protein Bor1p has sequence homology to band 3 (10Frommer W.B. von Wiren N. Nature. 2002; 420: 282-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To test for Bor1p on the vacuole, total cell extracts and vacuoles from strains containing a Bor1-GFP fusion protein were immunoblotted for GFP. Bor1-GFP is enriched on vacuoles as compared with the total cell lysate (Fig. 8A). The importance of vacuolar Bor1p is supported by the vacuolar phenotype of a bor1Δ strain. Approximately 90% of cells lacking Bor1p have fragmented vacuoles (Fig. 8C). To determine whether Bor1p is needed for enolase localization to the vacuole, immunoblots were performed on vacuoles from the bor1Δ strain (Fig. 8B). Vacuolar markers ALP and CPY were present in amounts comparable to their abundance on vacuoles from the wild type strain, whereas Eno1, 2p, Sec17p, Sec18p, Ypt7p, and Vam3p were severely lacking on vacuoles from the bor1Δ strain. These results establish that yeast Bor1p is localized to vacuoles and show a novel role for Bor1p in the trafficking of proteins to the vacuole. We have purified a HMA that stimulates vacuole fusion and identified that activity as enolase 1 and enolase 2. Enolase is an abundant cytosolic protein and a glycolytic enzyme. To test whether enolase was a contaminant in HMA and not the active protein per se, recombinant proteins were tested for stimulation of the in vitro fusion assay. Either recombinant Eno1p or Eno2p stimulate in vitro vacuole fusion, confirming that the activity in the fractions purified from yeast are not due to a minor component. The ability of both Eno1p and Eno2p to stimulate fusion is not surprising because they are 95% identical (7McAlister L. Holland M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7181-7188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Holland M.J. Holland J.P. Thill G.P. Jackson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1385-1395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many glycolytic proteins have functions in addition to their roles in glycolysis. Aldolase binds actin and supports protein trafficking to the plasma membrane (16Jewett T.J. Sibley L.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 885-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 17Walsh T.P. Clarke F.M. Masters C.J. Biochem.

Biochem. 1991; 200: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19Zheng L. Roeder R.G. Luo Y. Cell. 2003; 114: 255-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase functions in tubulin binding, nuclear RNA export, phosphorylation, membrane fusion, and transcriptional regulation (20Sirover M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 159-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase supports cell motility and proliferation (21Niinaka Y. Paku S. Haga A. Watanabe H. Raz A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2667-2674PubMed Google Scholar). Enolase too has a role that is separate from its function in glycolysis. Vacuole fusion is not stimulated by the addition of the substrate or product of enolase nor by the addition of other glycolytic enzymes and is not inhibited by the addition of glycolytic inhibitors. A catalytically inactive enolase mutant stimulates in vitro fusion as well as wild type enolase ((15Vinarov D.A. Nowak T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12138-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), Fig. 2B). Thus enolase participates in glycolysis and in vacuole fusion by distinct mechanisms. Enolase-deficient cells (i.e. those lacking Eno1p, those deficient in Eno2p, and those lacking Eno1p and deficient in Eno2p) exhibit vacuole fragmentation (Fig. 6B), indicating a role for enolase in vacuole fusion, in trafficking fusion factors to the vacuole, or both. Indeed, enolase deficiency causes a decrease in vacuolar levels of other proteins required for fusion (Fig. 7) demonstrating a role for enolase in trafficking of proteins to the vacuole in addition to its role in fusion. Why does recombinant enolase stimulate the in vitro fusion of wild type vacuoles but not enolase-deficient vacuoles? One would expect that adding recombinant enolase to enolase-deficient vacuoles would rescue fusion if there were no secondary defects in vacuolar protein composition when enolase is deficient. However, we have found that enolase-deficient vacuoles have the secondary defect of lacking proteins that are required for fusion. This explains the inability of enolase to rescue the fusion of vacuoles from enolase-deficient cells. Enolase has been reported to bind to a subunit of the adaptor protein complex 3 (22Gavin A.C.

Sequence comparisons of yeast proteins to human band 3 protein, which localizes glycolytic enzyme complexes to membranes, identified Bor1p as the yeast homologue of band 3 (9Campanella M.E. Chu H.

Nature. 2002; 420: 282-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Little is known about Bor1p in yeast other than the enhanced efflux of boron when Bor1p is overexpressed (24Takano J. Noguchi K. Yasumori M. Kobayashi M. Gajdos Z. Miwa K. Hayashi H. Yoneyama T. Fujiwara T. Nature. 2002; 420: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). To determine whether Bor1p is involved in enolase localization to the vacuole, we examined vacuoles from bor1Δ cells. These vacuoles are deficient in enolase and other proteins involved in fusion (Fig. 8C). Thus Bor1p is also involved in the trafficking of proteins to the vacuole, in accord with the fragmented vacuolar phenotype common to both enolase-deficient strains and bor1Δ strains (Fig. 8B). Understanding the roles of Eno1p and Bor1p in trafficking will likely require analysis of in vitro reactions that reflect trafficking from the Golgi to the vacuole."

The first enzyme in this pathway, glucose dehydrogenase, catalyzes the oxidation of glucose to gluconate, but has been shown to have activity with a broad range of sugar substrates, including glucose, galactose, xylose, and l-arabinose, with a requirement for the glucose stereo configuration at the C2 and C3 positions.

Complexes of the enzyme with d-glucose and d-xylose are presented to resolutions of 1.6 and 1.5 Å, respectively, that provide evidence of selectivity for the β-anomeric, pyranose form of the substrate, and indicate that this is the productive substrate form. The nature of the promiscuity of glucose dehydrogenase is also elucidated, and a physiological role for this enzyme in xylose metabolism is suggested. Finally, the structure suggests that the mechanism of sugar oxidation by this enzyme may be similar to that described for human sorbitol dehydrogenase.

Finally, the structure suggests that the mechanism of sugar oxidation by this enzyme may be similar to that described for human sorbitol dehydrogenase. The hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus grows optimally at 80-85 °C and pH 2-4, utilizing a wide range of carbon and energy sources, and has been used as a model organism of archaeal sugar metabolism, being subject to extensive and comprehensive investigations (1Verhees C.H. Kengen S.W. Tuininga J.E. Schut G.J. Adams M.W. De Vos W.M. Van Der Oost J. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 231-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 2Grogan D.W. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6710-6719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Central metabolism in S. solfataricus involves a variant of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway (3DeRosa M. Gambaccorta A. Nicolaus B. Giardina P. Poerio E. Buonocore V. Biochem. J. 1984; 224: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Typically this pathway has been described as non-phosphorylative (3DeRosa M. Gambaccorta A. Nicolaus B. Giardina P. Poerio E. Buonocore V. Biochem. J. 1984; 224: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), proceeding with no net ATP production, and with analogous pathways being described for the thermophilic archaea Sulfolobus acidocaldarius (4Selig M. Xavier K.B. Santos H. Schonheit P. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), Thermoplasma acidophilum (5Budgen N. Danson M.J. FEBS Lett. 1986; 196: 207-210Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and Thermoproteus tenax (6Siebers B. Hensel R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 111: 1-8Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar), as well as certain strains of Aspergillus fungi (7Elshafei A.M. Acta Biotechnol. 1989; 9: 485-489Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 8Elzainy T.A. Hassan M.M. Allam A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 114: 457-459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this pathway, glucose dehydrogenase and gluconate dehydratase catalyze the oxidation of glucose to gluconate and the subsequent dehydration of gluconate to 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate (KDG). 2The abbreviations used are: KDG, 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate; LADH, liver alcohol dehydrogenase; SDH, sorbitol dehydrogenase; MDR, medium-chain alcohol/polyol dehydrogenase/reductase; GDH, glucose dehydrogenase; TaGDH, T. acidophilum GDH; SsGDH, S. solfataricus GDH; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. KDG aldolase then catalyzes the cleavage of KDG to glyceraldehyde and pyruvate. The glyceraldehyde is phosphorylated by glycerate kinase to give 2-phosphoglycerate. A second molecule of pyruvate is then produced from this by the actions of enolase and pyruvate kinase. Glucose dehydrogenase and KDG aldolase from S. solfataricus have been reported to have high activity with galactose and 2-keto-3-deoxygalactonate, respectively (9Lamble H.J. Heyer N.I. Bull S.D. Hough D.W. Danson M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34066-34072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), with recent reports demonstrating the activity of gluconate dehydratase from this organism with galactonate (10Lamble H.J. Milburn C.C. Taylor G.L. Hough D.W. Danson M.J. FEBS Lett. 2004; 576: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 11Kim S. Lee S.B. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Consequently, it was proposed that the entire central metabolic pathway in this organism is promiscuous for the metabolism of glucose and galactose. This situation is in contrast with other microorganisms, where separate enzymes and pathways are present for the metabolism of the two sugars. A parallel part-phosphorylative Entner-Doudoroff pathway has also been described as an alternative route for glucose metabolism, and it has been demonstrated that this pathway is equally promiscuous for the metabolism of both glucose and galactose in S. solfataricus (12Lamble H.J.

Geerling A.C. van der Oost J. Siebers B. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, the pathways intersect at the KDG aldolase level, and thus the role and substrate specificity of glucose dehydrogenase is unchanged in both pathways. Glucose dehydrogenase from S. solfataricus (SsGDH) has previously been assigned to the medium-chain alcohol/polyol dehydrogenase/reductase (MDR) branch of the superfamily of pyridine-nucleotide-dependent alcohol/polyol/sugar dehydrogenases (14Edwards K.J. Barton J.D. Rossjohn J. Thorn J.M. Taylor G.L. Ollis D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These enzymes are characterized by a chain length of 350-375 residues and conserved structural zinc-binding and nucleotide-binding sites. SsGDH has dual-cofactor specificity for NAD/NADP+(9Lamble H.J. Heyer N.I. Bull S.D. Hough D.W. Danson M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34066-34072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and contains a GXGXXG motif (residues 188-193) characteristic of nucleotide-binding folds (15Rao S.T. Rossmann M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 76: 241-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 16Wierenga R.K. De Maeyer M.C.H. Hol W.G.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1346-1357Crossref Scopus (465) Google Scholar). SsGDH has four conserved cysteine residues equivalent to the residues involved in the binding of a structural zinc ion in T. acidophilum glucose dehydrogenase (TaGDH) (17John J. Crennell S.J. Hough D.W. Danson M.J. Taylor G.L. Structure. 1994; 2: 385-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). SsGDH also possesses catalytic zinc coordinating residues, including Cys39 and His66, which align with equivalent residues present throughout the alcohol dehydrogenase family (18Jornvall H. Persson B. Jeffery J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 167: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), with Gln150 being predicted to replace what is typically a second conserved cysteine as a zinc ligand. On this basis it has been predicted that SsGDH and TaGDH will oxidize their sugar substrates via a mechanism similar to that of other, characterized, MDR family members (17John J. Crennell S.J. Hough D.W. Danson M.J. Taylor G.L. Structure. 1994; 2: 385-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Previous structural and mechanistic studies of MDR family members have centered on liver alcohol dehydrogenase (LADH) (19Eklund H. Nordstrom B. Zeppezauer E. Soderlund G. Ohlsson I. Boiwe T. Soderberg B.O. Tapia O. Branden C.I. Akeson A. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 102: 27-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 20Eklund H. Plapp B.V. Samama J.P. Branden C.I. J. Biol.

Lee S.E. Madura R. McGuire D. Subashi T. Wasilko D. Watts P. Mylari B.L. Oates P.J. Adams P.D. Rath V.L.

Interact. 2001; 130-132: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), whereas the structure of TaGDH has only been described in an apo form (17John J. Crennell S.J. Hough D.W. Danson M.J. Taylor G.L. Structure. 1994; 2: 385-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus there are no currently available structures of an MDR family member in complex with a ring form sugar substrate. As such, current predictions on the structural basis of the promiscuity of this enzyme have been open to wide interpretation. Finally, it is known that Sulfolobus species and a number of halophilic archaea are capable of utilizing pentoses as a carbon/energy source, although to date there has been little investigation into the route they employ for pentose metabolism (1Verhees C.H. Kengen S.W. Tuininga J.E. Schut G.J. Adams M.W. De Vos W.M. Van Der Oost J. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 231-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 2Grogan D.W. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6710-6719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One study has revealed that a specific xylose dehydrogenase is induced in the halophilic archaeon Haloarcula marismortui during growth on d-xylose (24Johnsen U. Schonheit P. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6198-6207Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the oxidation of xylose by this enzyme, to produce xylonate, is the first step of xylose catabolism in this organism. This situation contrasts to the situation in bacteria, where the pentose phosphate pathway is the major route for xylose dissimilation. Given the apparent absence of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway in the archaea (25Soderberg T. Archaea. 2005; 1: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), it is possible that this novel pathway, beginning with xylose oxidation, is employed generally in those archaea that have the capacity to catabolize xylose. Cloning of SsGDH and the Generation of T41A and T41V Mutant Proteins—The cloning of wild-type SsGDH (gi: 3786221) into the pREC7 plasmid and the transformation of JM109 cells for expression has been previously described (9Lamble H.J. Heyer N.I. Bull S.D. Hough D.W. Danson M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34066-34072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis was performed on the SsGDH gene cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of expression vector pET-3a (Novagen). QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) was employed with primer sequences 5′-GGTATTTGTGGTGCTGATAGAGAGATAGTTATTGG-3′ (T41A) and 5′-GGTATTTGTGGTGTTGATAGAGAGATAGTTATTGG-3′ (T41V), following the manufacturer's protocol (mutations are indicated by bold italics). Sequenced clones containing the required mutation were transformed into BL21(DE3) cells. Expression and Purification of Recombinant SsGDH—The expression and purification of wt-SsGDH has been described previously (26Theodossis A. Milburn C.C. Heyer N.I. Lamble H.J. Hough D.W. Danson M.J. Taylor G.L. Acta Crystallogr. 2004; F61: 112-115Google Scholar). Briefly, SsGDH was expressed in JM109 cells from the pREC7 plasmid at 37 °C without induction. After expression the protein was purified in four steps: heat treatment at 60 and 80 °C, followed by gel filtration on Superdex 75 26/60, anion exchange chromatography, and, finally, affinity chromatography using Reactive Red-500 dye affinity medium and an NaCl gradient of 0 to 1.5 m. Purified SsGDH samples were dialyzed into a final buffer of 50 mm Tris-base (pH 7.5), 20 mm MgCl2 and concentrated to ∼3.5 mg/ml with a spin concentrator (VivaScience), with the concentration being verified at A280. The expression and purification of the T41A and T41V mutant proteins were performed using the same method, with the protein being expressed from the pET3A plasmid in BL21(DE3) cells at 37 °C without induction. Further analysis of the proteins by electro-spray mass spectrometry revealed a single major species with the expected molecular mass, though some degradation products were detected. Assay of Enzyme Activity—Glucose dehydrogenase activity was determined spectrophotometrically by following the increase in absorbance at 340 nm, corresponding to the reduction of NAD(P)+, over 3 min at 70 °C. Assays were performed in 100 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5 at 70 °C) containing 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NAD+ or 1 mm NADP+, and 0-200 mm d-glucose, d-galactose, or d-xylose. Kinetic parameters were determined by the direct linear method of Eisenthal and Cornish-Bowden (27Cornish-Bowden A. Eisenthal R. Biochem. J. 1974; 139: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 28Eisenthal R. Cornish-Bowden A. Biochem. J. 1974; 139: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). Crystallization—The hanging drop, vapor-diffusion method was used for producing crystals. Hanging drops were formed by mixing 1 μl of protein solution with 1 μl of a mother liquor solution. The apo enzyme was crystallized using a mother liquor of 12% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m MES (pH 5.8), and 3% (v/v) propan-2-ol. Orthorhombic crystals appeared after 2 days and grew to ∼0.3 × 0.1 × 0.1 mm in size. Crystals were frozen in a nitrogen gas stream after being soaked in 10%, followed by 20% (v/v) glycerol in mother liquor for 10-15 s each. Crystals of SsGDH (wt and T41A/T41V) in complex with NADP+ were formed by incubating the purified protein with 1 mm NADP+ for ∼12 h at room temperature before crystallization with a mother liquor of 8% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 mm Tris-base (pH 8.0), and 4.5% (v/v) propan-2-ol. Orthorhombic crystals appeared after 3 days and grew to an average of 0.5 × 0.2 × 0.15 mm in size. wt-NADP+-complexed crystals were frozen using the same conditions as the apo crystals. T41A/V mutant proteins in complex with glucose/xylose were obtained by stepwise equilibration of T41A/V·NADP+ co-crystals with 40 mm (2 min), 130 mm (2 min), 500 mm (10 min), and 800 mm (30 s) glucose/xylose dissolved in mother liquor, followed by cryoprotection with 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol in mother liquor with 800 mm glucose/xylose for 15 s before being frozen in the nitrogen gas stream. Data Collection—Data were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility at a temperature of 100 K. Data were processed using MOSFLM (29Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; 26: 27-33Google Scholar) and scaled using Scala from the CCP4 version 5.0.2 Suite (30P4 CC Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The apo, NADP+-bound, and T41V·NADP·glucose/xylose structures were of space group P21212 with a dimer in the asymmetric unit, whereas the structures of the T41A·NADP·glucose/xylose complexes were of space group P21 with a tetramer in the asymmetric unit.

The structure of SsGDH in complex with NADP+ was solved to a resolution of 2.3 Å by molecular replacement, using AMoRe (30P4 CC Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol.

The structures of the T41A mutant protein in complex with NADP+ and glucose/xylose were solved by molecular replacement using AMoRe (30P4 CC Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol.

The final models have R = 0.194/0.204 (Rfree = 0.222/0.242) for the glucose/xylose-bound structures, to resolutions of 1.6 and 1.5 Å, respectively. In all cases, iterative model building in O (34Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Refinement statistics for all structures are shown in Table 1. Structures of the T41V mutant protein with NADP+ and complexed with glucose/xylose were also obtained; however, statistics for these structures are not reported, because refinement did not progress past initial rounds due to the higher quality of the T41A data. The atomic coordinates and structure factors for the apo, NADP+, glucose, and xylose complex structures have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org/pdb) under accession codes 2cd9, 2cda, 2cdb, and 2cdc, respectively. Overall Structure—The crystal structure of SsGDH confirms the enzyme as a 160-kDa homo-tetramer (9Lamble H.J. Heyer N.I. Bull S.D. Hough D.W. Danson M.J. J. Biol.

The SsGDH monomer comprises 366 amino acids and possesses a secondary/tertiary structure closely resembling that of TaGDH, with which it shares a 34% sequence identity (17John J. Crennell S.J. Hough D.W. Danson M.J. Taylor G.L. Structure. 1994; 2: 385-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), with a root mean square deviation of 1.34 Å based on Cα positions. It is composed of two domains, a nucleotide-binding domain (residues 190-308) and a catalytic domain (residues 1-189 and 309-366) (Fig. 1B). The catalytic domain is highly conserved between SsGDH and TaGDH, being formed by interactions between N-terminal and C-terminal segments. Residues 94-109, which lie between strands β9 and β10, coil to form a conserved structural zinc-binding lobe, with cysteine residues 93, 96, 99, and 107 coordinating to a well ordered zinc. Conserved catalytic zinc coordinating residues Cys69 and His66, along with Glu67 within the β7 strand of the catalytic domain, lie within the cleft between this domain and the nucleotide-binding domain and were found to coordinate a zinc (occupancy of ∼0.8) (Fig. 2A). A well ordered water molecule is found coordinating to this zinc and capable of forming additional interactions with residues Gln150, His66 and Glu67. The locations of the zinc atom and water molecule were confirmed by calculating an anomalous difference Fourier map (data not shown), and suggest that the catalytic zinc could occupy the site of the coordinated water molecule, and vice versa, within the apo structure. A partially-occupied catalytic zinc site (0.6-0.7 occupancy) was also reported for sorbitol dehydrogenase (36Jeffery J. Chesters J. Mills C. Sadler P.J. Jornvall H. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The positioning of the zinc atom within the SsGDH catalytic site, like that of TaGDH, more closely resembles the pattern of interacting residues seen in the apo human SDH structure (22Pauly T.A.

The N-terminal segment of the catalytic domain is linked to the nucleotide-binding domain by a large central helix (α2), and the α3-helix connects the end of the nucleotide-binding domain to the C-terminal segment of the catalytic domain (Fig. 1B). The nucleotide-binding domain consists of a Rossmann fold containing six parallel strands and, as with the previously reported structures (17John J. Crennell S.J. Hough D.W. Danson M.J. Taylor G.L.

The GXGXXG nucleotide-binding motif is located within the center of a deep cleft between the catalytic and nucleotide-binding domains, ∼10 Å from the catalytic zinc ion (Figs. 1B and 2A). SsGDH assembles into a tetramer with His297 from one monomer contributing to the active site of an adjacent monomer, leading to the narrowing of one end of the binding cleft. His297 thus has the potential to interact with bound substrate. From comparison with the TaGDH structure, it would appear that the role of the structural zinc is also to maintain the tetrameric nature of GDH (17John J. Crennell S.J. Hough D.W. Danson M.J. Taylor G.L. Structure. 1994; 2: 385-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). NADP-bound Structure—Binding of NADP leads to a conformational change within the βD-αE loop (residues 252-260). As with SDH and LADH (21Eklund H. Samama J.P. Jones T.A.

The NADP+ molecule makes several specific interactions with the nucleotide binding pocket of GDH, one being a stacking interaction between the nicotinamide ring and Phe277, whereas Phe279 moves to stack the other side of the nicotinamide ring (Fig. 2, A and B). This movement may in part result from interactions between the C3-hydroxyl of the cofactor ribose adjacent to the nicotinamide ring and the backbone nitrogen of Phe279. Three further interactions are made between the nicotinamide amide group and the backbone of Leu305, Phe277, and Asn307. Two hydrogen bonding interactions are made from the two bridging phosphate groups, with the phosphate closest to the nicotinamide ring being within 3.2 Å of the backbone nitrogen of Ile192 (part of the GXGXXG motif) and the phosphate closest to the adenosine ring interacting with Lys354 from the catalytic domain, as a result of a 2.3-Å shift in position of this side chain between the apo and NADP+-bound states. Within the adenosine portion of the cofactor, the nucleotide hydroxyl forms two interactions, one to the backbone oxygen of Thr189 (which constitutes the first X of the GXGXXG motif) and the other to the side chain of Asn211, which moves 2.5 Å from its apo position to form this interaction. As predicted by comparison with other NADP+-preferring enzymes, Arg213 makes two hydrogen bonds to the 3′-phosphate of this nucleotide, whereas the oxygen linking the phosphate to the nucleotide is capable of forming two hydrogen bonds to Asn211. Arg212 also moves from its apo position to avoid steric clashes and stacks against the adenosine ring. As predicted, the previously described movement of the side chain of Asn211 leads to both its Oδ1 and Nδ2 atoms being within ∼3.3 Å of the adenosine 2-hydroxyl, thus stabilizing the 2′-phosphate and acting as a determinant for NADP+specificity (14Edwards K.J.

Unusually, transport of several MRP1 substrates requires glutathione (GSH). For example, estrone sulfate transport by MRP1 is stimulated by GSH, vincristine is co-transported with GSH, or GSH can be transported alone. In the present study, radioligand binding assays were developed to investigate the mechanistic details of GSH-stimulated transport of estrone sulfate by MRP1. We have established that estrone sulfate binding to MRP1 requires GSH, or its non-reducing analogue S-methyl GSH (S-mGSH), and further that the affinity (Kd) of MRP1 for estrone sulfate is 2.5-fold higher in the presence of S-mGSH than GSH itself. Association kinetics show that GSH binds to MRP1 first, and we propose that GSH binding induces a conformational change, which makes the estrone sulfate binding site accessible. Binding of non-hydrolyzable ATP analogues to MRP1 decreases the affinity for estrone sulfate. However, GSH (or S-mGSH) is still required for estrone sulfate binding, and the affinity for GSH is unchanged. Estrone sulfate affinity remains low following hydrolysis of ATP. The affinity for GSH also appears to decrease in the post-hydrolytic state.

However, this is problematic when MRP1 is expressed at elevated levels in cancer cells, because it causes resistance to anticancer agents, including anthracyclines, plant alkaloids, and anti-folates, by transporting them out of cells.An unusual feature of MRP1 (and some other members of the ABCC subfamily) is the requirement for the reducing tripeptide GSH to be present for transport of several of its substrates to occur, including certain anticancer drugs (5Loe D.W.

GSH is an essential cellular anti-oxidant, which reacts with electrophilic molecules to form conjugated hydrophilic metabolites that can be more readily eliminated from the body. Prior to elimination, such metabolites must be actively effluxed from the cells in which they are formed. MRP1 can transport many such GSH-conjugated anions (18Haimeur A. Conseil G. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Curr. Drug Metab. 2004; 5: 21-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar); however, the role of GSH in MRP1-mediated transport is not limited to forming conjugates. For example, transport of the Vinca alkaloid vincristine is markedly enhanced by GSH, and the interaction appears to be co-transport with the drug without formation of a conjugate (14Loe D.W. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5130-5136PubMed Google Scholar). Estrone sulfate transport by MRP1 is also enhanced by GSH; however, in contrast to vincristine transport, GSH only stimulates the process and is not itself transported (8Qian Y.M. Song W.C. Cui H. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6404-6411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Some MRP1 inhibitors such as the tricyclic isoxazole derivative LY475776 also require GSH to photolabel to MRP1 (19Mao Q.C. Qiu W. Weigl K.E. Lander P.A. Tabas L.B. Shepard R.L. Dantzig A.H.

Evers R. Sinko E. Varadi A. Borst P. Sarkadi B. Mol. Pharm. 2000; 57: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In contrast, GSH can be transported alone, and some xenobiotics, including verapamil, or bioflavonoids such as apigenin, stimulate GSH efflux without being transported themselves (21Loe D.W.

However, it is not the reducing ability of GSH that is important for its interactions with MRP1, because non-reducing analogues such as ophthalmic acid or S-mGSH can functionally substitute for GSH (8Qian Y.M.

Thus it is clear that the role of GSH in MRP1-mediated transport is very complex, but as yet relatively little is known about the mechanism of interaction of GSH with this transporter.MRP1 function is often evaluated by measuring ATP-dependent uptake of a radiolabeled substrate into inside-out membrane vesicles prepared from cells expressing the transporter. Transmembrane transport of a substrate assayed in this way gives an overall measure of a multistep process. First, the substrate binds to a high affinity site on the cytosolic side of the membrane. This substrate binding site is subsequently reoriented to the extracellular face of the membrane where the binding affinity is decreased so that the substrate may be released. The final step of the transport cycle is the return of the binding site to its initial high affinity state (28Tanford C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3701-3705Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For MRP1 (and other ABC transporters), these steps of the transport cycle are coupled to the binding and/or hydrolysis of ATP, but the precise details of this coupling are not known. Nor is it known when and how GSH participates in this process. Because conventional vesicular transport assays do not readily allow the individual constituent steps of the transport cycle to be examined, we have developed a radioligand binding assay to investigate directly the binding of estrone sulfate to MRP1, to measure the effect of GSH on the binding of this substrate, and to determine how the binding of estrone sulfate and GSH is affected by nucleotide binding and hydrolysis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—[6,7-3H]Estrone sulfate (57.3 Ci/mmol) and [14,15,19,20-3H]LTC4 were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. LTC4 was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Methotrexate sodium solution was from Faulding (Montreal, Quebec, Canada). mAbs MRPm6 and MRPr1 were a kind gift from Drs. R. J. Scheper and G. L. Scheffer (Amsterdam, Netherlands). Diphenylcarbamyl chloride-treated trypsin was from ICN Biomedicals (Solon, OH). Complete, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture was from Roche Diagnostics (Laval, Quebec, Canada). GSH, S-mGSH, ATP, AMPPNP, ATPγS, sodium orthovanadate, E217βG, estrone 3-sulfate, DTT, and BAEE were from Sigma.Cell Culture and Membrane Preparation—The H69 small cell lung cancer cell line and its doxorubicin-selected, MRP1-overexpressing H69AR-derivative cell line were cultured as described previously (29Cole S.P. Pinkoski M.J. Bhardwaj G. Deeley R.G. Br. J. Cancer. 1992; 65: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To prepare plasma membranes, cells (∼5 × 108) were harvested, resuspended in buffer 1 (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose) containing 250 μm CaCl2 and protease inhibitors, and subjected to argon cavitation (250 p.s.i., 5 min, 4 °C). Unexploded cells and debris were removed by low speed centrifugation (750 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was loaded onto a 35% sucrose cushion. Following centrifugation (100,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C), plasma membranes were harvested from the sucrose interface, diluted with buffer 2 (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 25 mm sucrose), and centrifuged again. The membrane pellet was resuspended in buffer 1 at ∼10 mg of protein per ml and stored at –70 °C for up to 3 months. Protein concentrations were measured using a Bio-Rad Bradford assay, with bovine serum albumin as a standard.[3H]Estrone Sulfate Binding Assays—Membrane protein (10 μg) was allowed to equilibrate with [3H]estrone sulfate in the presence or absence of organic anion substrates and/or nucleotides in a total volume of 50 μlof hypotonic buffer 3 (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) at 23 °C for 1 h. The use of hypotonic buffer ensures that the membrane vesicles are burst open and, thus, that the MRP1 protein is accessible from both sides of the membrane. Following equilibration, 1.5 ml of ice-cold buffer 4 (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2) was added, and samples were filtered immediately through a PerkinElmer Life Sciences unifilter GF/B plate using a Packard Filtermate Harvester, and washed twice with buffer 4. Tritium bound to the filter was determined using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Top Count NXT Microplate Scintillation counter.Displacement/Stimulation Assays—Binding assays were used to measure the displacement of estrone sulfate binding by other substrates of MRP1 or the increase in estrone sulfate binding in the presence of GSH analogues. Membrane proteins (10 μg) were incubated with [3H]estrone sulfate (35–40 nm) in the presence of (a) 3 mm S-mGSH and various concentrations of LTC4 (3 nm to 10 μm), E217βG (300 nm to 3 mm), or methotrexate (1 μm to 3 mm) or (b) various concentrations of GSH or S-mGSH (1 μm to 10 mm), before filtering as described above. DTT (10 mm) was present in all experiments containing GSH to prevent oxidation to oxidized glutathione. Data were fitted with a sigmoidal dose-response curve by non-linear regression analysis (Equation 1), B=Bmin+(Bmax−Bmin)/(1+10(log EC50−log[S]))Eq. 1 where B is the amount of estrone sulfate bound, Bmax is maximal binding at this concentration of estrone sulfate, Bmin is nonspecific binding, [S] = concentration of substrate, and EC50 is the substrate concentration at half-maximal estrone sulfate binding.Saturation Binding Isotherms—To determine parameters of maximal binding capacity (Bmax) and binding dissociation constant (Kd), 10 μgof membrane protein was incubated with various concentrations of [3H]estrone sulfate (10 nm to 30 μm). This assay was done in the presence of 0.3, 1, 3, or 10 mm S-mGSH or GSH (plus 10 mm DTT) in the presence or absence of 1 mm E217βG. Nonspecific binding (in the presence of 1 mm E217βG) was subtracted from total binding to determine specific binding, and specific data were fitted with a one-site binding hyperbola (Equation 2), B=Bmax·[L]/(Kd+[L])Eq. 2 where B is the amount of estrone sulfate bound, Bmax is maximal binding capacity for estrone sulfate, [L] is the concentration of estrone sulfate, and Kd is the binding dissociation constant. The commercially available radioligand could not be used to generate [3H]estrone sulfate concentrations above 3 μm, and this was therefore achieved by supplementing with unlabeled estrone sulfate as previously described (30Martin C. Higgins C.F. Callaghan R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15733-15742Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).Association Kinetics—The rate of association of estrone sulfate with MRP1 in the presence of S-mGSH was determined by using the following three protocols. Comparison of the data from each protocol was used to ascertain the order of binding of GSH and estrone sulfate to MRP1. Firstly, membrane proteins (10 μg) were preincubated with 3 mm S-mGSH for 30 min in the presence or absence of 1 mm E217βG (for determination of nonspecific estrone sulfate binding). [3H]Estrone sulfate (40 nm) was added at selected time points (0–60 min) and then stopped by addition of buffer 4 and filtration as described above. Secondly, [3H]estrone sulfate (40 nm) and S-mGSH (3 mm) were mixed, with or without E217βG (1 mm), and membrane proteins (10 μg) were added at selected times (0–60 min) before filtering. Lastly, membrane proteins (10 μg) were preincubated with [3H]estrone sulfate (40 nm) for 30 min, with or without 1 mm E217βG, and S-mGSH (3 mm) was added at selected times (0–60 min) before filtering. For each of the above three protocols, specific estrone sulfate binding was calculated by subtracting nonspecific binding (in the presence of 1 mm E217βG) from total binding (in the absence of E217βG), for each time point. An exponential association curve (Equation 3) was fitted to the specific binding data by non-linear regression, B=Bmax(1−e−kobst)Eq. 3 where B is the estrone sulfate bound, Bmax is maximal binding at this concentration of estrone sulfate, t is time, and kobs is the observed rate constant.Addition of Nucleotides—AMPPNP or ATPγS was added to membrane proteins to a final concentration of 4 mm in the presence of 5 mm MgSO4. Vanadate trapping of nucleotide was achieved by incubating membrane proteins at 37 °C for 30 min with 4 mm ATP, 5 mm MgSO4, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (prepared as a 100 mm stock solution, pH 10, and boiled prior to use (31Goodno C.C. Method Enzymol. 1982; 85: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar)). Excess ATP was removed by centrifugation (25,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), and the membranes were resuspended in buffer 3 containing 1 mm orthovanadate, ready for use in the estrone sulfate binding assays. Membrane proteins were subjected to the same conditions but without ATP as a control and were included in each assay to ensure there was no spurious effect of the nucleotide-trapping conditions.[3H]LTC4 Transport to Measure Vanadate-induced Nucleotide Trapping Efficiency—Vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping by MRP1 was carried out as described above, except buffer 1 (sucrose buffer) was used in place of buffer 3 (hypotonic buffer), and following centrifugation to remove unbound ATP, the vesicles were resuspended in buffer 1 without vanadate and immediately used in LTC4 transport assays. As before, a sample subjected to the same conditions but without ATP was prepared as a control. [3H]LTC4 transport was carried out as described previously (5Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9675-9682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 32Tabas L.B. Dantzig A.H. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 310: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 nm [3H]LTC4 (20 nCi per point), 10 mm MgCl2, and 4 mm ATP (plus an ATP-regenerating system consisting of creatine kinase and creatine phosphate) or 4 mm AMP were incubated with 2 μg of membrane protein at 23 °C for 1 min. The reaction was stopped by dilution in ice-cold buffer 1 and rapidly filtered as described for the binding assays. Uptake in the presence of AMP was subtracted from uptake in the presence of ATP to determine ATP-dependent transport. The residual ATP-dependent [3H]LTC4 uptake in the vanadate-trapped sample was compared with the control sample as a measure of vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping efficiency.Limited Trypsin Digestion of MRP1—Membranes (0.25 mg of protein ml–1) in buffer 3 were incubated alone, with 10 mm DTT, 50 μm estrone sulfate, 10 mm GSH (plus 10 mm DTT), 10 mm S-mGSH or various combinations of these reagents, for 30 min on ice. Diphenylcarbamyl chloride-treated trypsin was then added at trypsin:protein ratios of 1:5000 to 2.5:1 (w/w) for 15 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by addition of Laemmli sample buffer containing leupeptin (16.7 μgml–1) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (10 mm). Samples (2 μg of protein) were resolved on a 7% acrylamide gel and immunoblotted. Tryptic fragments of MRP1 were detected by chemiluminescence using the primary mAbs MRPm6 (1:1000) and MRPr1 (1:5000), whose epitopes lie at the COOH terminus (amino acids 1511–1520) and in cytoplasmic loop 3 connecting the first and second membrane spanning domains (amino acids 238–247), respectively (33Hipfner D.R. Gao M. Scheffer G. Scheper R.J. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 78: 1134-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).The direct effect of estrone sulfate, GSH, and/or DTT on trypsin activity per se was assayed using the model substrate BAEE. Diphenylcarbamyl chloride-treated trypsin (500 units ml–1 in 1 mm HCl) was incubated alone, or in the presence of 50 μm estrone sulfate, 10 mm DTT, 10 mm GSH, 10 mm S-mGSH or combinations of these reagents at 23 °C for 30 min. The trypsin (200 μl) was then added to 0.25 mm BAEE (3 ml), and trypsin activity was determined as the rate of increase of absorbance at 250 nm over a 10-min period. 3Available at www.sigmaaldrich.com/sigma/enzyme%20assay/t9253enz.pdf. Data Analysis—All non-linear regression analyses were carried out using GraphPad Prism 3.0 (San Diego, CA). Data sets contain a minimum of three independent experiments, and data are depicted as means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were carried out using one-way analysis of variance with a Tukey post-hoc test. Differences were considered statistically significant when p was <0.05.RESULTSRequirement of GSH for Specific Estrone Sulfate Binding—Radioligand binding assays were developed to study the interaction of estrone sulfate and GSH with MRP1. Approximately 250,000 dpm of [3H]estrone sulfate was added to each reaction (10 μg of membrane), of this <1% was bound by the filters. As shown in Fig. 1A, the level of [3H]estrone sulfate binding to H69AR (MRP1+) membranes in the absence of GSH was ∼1,100 dpm, the same as that to membranes from parental H69 (MRP1–) cells, indicating low level nonspecific binding to non-MRP1 components of the membrane preparation. Consistent with this conclusion, the amount of estrone sulfate binding could not be displaced by the MRP1 substrate E217βG. The inability to measure specific estrone sulfate binding could also not be overcome by increasing concentrations of [3H]estrone sulfate, at least up to 10 μm (data not shown). In contrast, the addition of GSH produced a substantial increase in [3H]estrone sulfate binding to the MRP1+ membranes while having no effect on the MRP1– membranes (Fig. 1A), indicating that specific binding of estrone sulfate to MRP1 occurs in the presence of GSH. The specificity of this GSH-induced binding was confirmed by the ability of excess E217βG to reduce [3H]estrone sulfate binding to the nonspecific level seen in the absence of GSH while having no effect on the MRP1– membranes. The specific binding of estrone sulfate to MRP1 could also be readily measured in the presence of the non-reducing GSH analogue S-mGSH. Together these data indicate that membranes from H69AR cells display a specific binding site for estrone sulfate but only in the presence of GSH (or S-mGSH). The lack of binding to H69 membranes indicates that the binding to membranes from resistant cells was to the MRP1 transporter. Support for the specific binding component as MRP1 was provided through heterologous displacement assays using several other known substrates of MRP1. Thus, LTC4 (IC50 0.95 μm), E217βG (IC50 90 μm), and methotrexate (IC50 1.8 mm) all produced concentration-dependent reductions in estrone sulfate binding to levels observed in the H69 (MRP1–) membranes (Fig. 1B). The order of potency to displace estrone sulfate binding matched the relative uptake affinities for MRP1 displayed by these substrates (5Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9675-9682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 6Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol.

Pharm. 2000; 57: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar).Estrone Sulfate Binding to MRP1 Is Greater in the Presence of S-mGSH than GSH—The increase in estrone sulfate binding to MRP1 in the presence of increasing concentrations of GSH or S-mGSH is shown in Fig. 2. The level of estrone sulfate binding in the presence of S-mGSH was significantly higher than in the presence of GSH itself, a difference consistent with the relative abilities of these two tripeptides to stimulate estrone sulfate vesicular transport by MRP1 (8Qian Y.M. Song W.C. Cui H. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6404-6411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 34Leslie E.M. Bowers R.J. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 304: 643-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This difference is not due to the presence of DTT, which is added to all experiments using GSH to prevent oxidation to oxidized glutathione, because comparable results are obtained with S-mGSH whether supplemented with DTT or not (data not shown). Despite differences in the amount of estrone sulfate bound, the potencies of GSH and S-mGSH to increase estrone sulfate binding were comparable, with EC50 values of 0.75 ± 0.12 mm and 0.77 ± 0.06 mm, respectively. These observations indicate that MRP1 displays no difference in its affinity for GSH or S-mGSH.FIGURE 2Effect of GSH and S-mGSH on [3H]estrone sulfate binding to MRP1. Binding of [3H]estrone sulfate (40 nm) to H69AR (MRP1+) membrane (10 μg of protein) was measured in the presence of increasing concentrations (1 μm to 10 mm) of S-mGSH (closed circles) or GSH (open squares). Data points are means ± S.E. from at least six independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Affinity and Binding Capacity of MRP1 for Estrone Sulfate—To determine the affinity and maximal binding capacity of MRP1, saturation binding isotherms for estrone sulfate, in the presence of either GSH or S-mGSH (3 mm), were determined (Fig. 3). A statistically significant difference between the affinity (Kd) for estrone sulfate binding to MRP1 was observed in the presence of 3 mm GSH (1.48 ± 0.06 μm) compared with 3 mm S-mGSH (0.59 ± 0.05 μm, p < 0.001). However, there was no difference in the maximal binding capacity for estrone sulfate (Bmax 83 ± 8 pmol mg–1 with GSH versus 87 ± 7 pmol mg–1 with S-mGSH). The difference in affinity accounts for the higher level of estrone sulfate binding in the presence of S-mG"
https://openalex.org/W1985726538,"Mammalian metallothionein-4 (MT-4) was found to be specifically expressed in stratified squamous epithelia where it plays an essential but poorly defined role in regulating zinc or copper metabolism. Here we report on the organization, stability, and the pathway of metal-thiolate cluster assembly in MT-4 reconstituted with Cd2+ and Co2+ ions. Both the 113Cd NMR studies of 113Cd7MT-4 and the spectroscopic characterization of Co7MT-4 showed that, similar to the classical MT-1 and MT-2 proteins, metal ions are organized in two independent Cd4Cys11 and Cd3Cys9 clusters with each metal ion tetrahedrally coordinated by terminal and bridging cysteine ligands. Moreover, we have demonstrated that the cluster formation in Cd7MT-4 is cooperative and sequential, with the Cd4Cys11 cluster being formed first, and that a distinct single-metal nucleation intermediate Cd1MT-4 is required in the cluster formation process. Conversely, the absorption and circular dichroism features of metal-thiolate clusters in Cd7MT-4 indicate that marked differences in the cluster geometry exist when compared with those in Cd7MT-1/2. The biological implication of our studies as to the role of MT-4 in zinc metabolism of stratified epithelia is discussed.

Metallothioneins (MTs) 2The abbreviations used are: MT, metallothionein; CD, circular dichroism; COSY, correlation spectroscopy; LMCT, ligand-to-metal charge transfer; MCD, magnetic circular dichroism; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. is a superfamily of low molecular mass cysteine- and metal-rich proteins or polypeptides conserved through evolution and present in all eukaryotes and certain prokaryotes (reviewed in Refs. 1Kägi J.H.R. Suzuki K.T. Imura N. Kimura M. Metallothionein III. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1993: 29-56Google Scholar and 2Vallee B.L. Neurochem. Int. 1995; 27: 23-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In mammals, the MT gene family consists of four subfamilies designated MT-1 through MT-4. Whereas in mouse only one member of each subfamily is present (Fig. 1), in primates a significant genetic polymorphism exists with 17 genes and pseudogenes in humans. From these 17 genes, 10 are functional, including single MT-3 and MT-4 genes (3Binz P.A. Kägi J.H.R. Klaassen C. Metallothioenein IV. Birkhäuser, Basel, Switzerland1999: 7-13Google Scholar). Mammalian MTs are composed of a single polypeptide chain of 61–68 amino acids with a conserved array of 20 cysteines and no aromatic residues or histidine. In the structurally characterized MTs (MT-1–MT-3), all cysteines are present in reduced form and are involved in the binding of seven divalent (Zn2+, Cd2+) and up to 12 monovalent metal ions (Cu+) forming two metal-thiolate clusters located in two independent protein domains (4Vašák M. Hasler D.W. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 5Romero-Isart N. Vašák M. J. Inorg.

Wiley & Sons Ltd., New York2005: 3208-3221Google Scholar). Although still under debate, suggested functions for mammalian MTs include homeostasis and transport of physiologically essential metals (zinc, copper), detoxification of toxic metals (cadmium, mercury), protection against oxidative stress, regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis, and the maintenance of intracellular redox balance (7Maret W. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 1455S-1458SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8428-8430Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 9Miles A.T.

Bull. 2001; 55: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Differential expression of mammalian MT isoforms is tightly regulated during development and in pathological situations (9Miles A.T. Hawksworth G.M. Beattie J.H. Rodilla V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 35: 35-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 11Theocharis S.E. Margeli A.P. Klijanienko J.T. Kouraklis G.P. Histopathology. 2004; 45: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The extensively studied mammalian MT-1 and MT-2 show ubiquitous expression regulated at the transcriptional level (12Lichtlen P. Schaffner W. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 1010-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Their biosynthesis is inducible by a variety of compounds and stress conditions, such as metals, glucocorticoids, cytokines, and reactive oxygen species (9Miles A.T. Hawksworth G.M. Beattie J.H. Rodilla V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 35: 35-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). MT-3 and MT-4 are relatively unresponsive to these inducers. MT-3 is primarily confined to the central nervous system, where it represents a major component of the intracellular Zn2+ pool in zinc-enriched neurons (13Masters B.A. Quaife C.J. Erickson J.C. Kelly E.J. Froelick G.J. Zambrowicz B.P. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5844-5857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lower expression levels of MT-3 have also been reported in pancreas, kidney, reproductive tissues, and maternal deciduum. This protein exhibits growth inhibitory activity in neuronal cultures and was found down-regulated in Alzheimer disease (reviewed in Ref. 14Sogawa C.A. Asanuma M. Sogawa N. Miyazaki I. Nakanishi T. Furuta H. Ogawa N. Acta Med. Okayama. 2001; 55: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of the last identified mammalian metallothionein isoform, MT-4, has been found restricted to cornified, stratified, squamous epithelium, a tissue providing a protective surface on skin, footpath, tail, tongue, the upper part of the alimentary tract, and the vagina of rodents (15Quaife C.J. Findley S.D. Erickson J.C. Froelick G.J. Kelly E.J. Zambrowicz B.P. Palmiter R.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7250-7259Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Besides these tissues, the developmentally regulated MT-4 expression in maternal deciduum together with the expression of entire MT gene locus have been reported in mouse (16Liang L. Fu K. Lee D.K. Sobieski R.J. Dalton T. Andrews G.K. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1996; 43: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Gene expression profiling by microarray hybridization of wild-type and nude mice back skin identified that the transcription factor Whn regulates the MT-4 expression together with other proteins involved in the metabolism of keratin (17Schlake T. Boehm T. Mech. Dev. 2001; 109: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, the question of whether MT-4 is involved in copper or zinc metabolism in epithelia is still debated. Thus, in the recent studies on the metal binding abilities of MT-4 using heterologously expressed MT-4 in Escherichia coli with zinc, cadmium, and copper in combination with the in silico protein sequence analyses, the copper binding nature of MT-4 has been suggested (18Tio L. Villarreal L. Atrian S. Capdevila M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24403-24413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). On the other hand, based on the highly regulated and specific expression pattern of MT-4 in stratified squamous epithelium, the documented switch in expression of MT-1 in the basal layer to MT-4 expression in the next layer during differentiation of this tissue and the zinc content of the isolated protein, a special role of MT-4 in the regulation of zinc-dependent keratinocyte differentiation or in the regulation of proteolytic processing of keratins has also been suggested (15Quaife C.J. Findley S.D. Erickson J.C. Froelick G.J. Kelly E.J. Zambrowicz B.P. Palmiter R.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7250-7259Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Moreover, MT-4 expression protects cell culture against cadmium toxicity, and its expression is induced in the upper stomach of mice exposed to high zinc levels in drinking water. These observations suggest that MT-4, similar to MT-1 and MT-2, may be involved in the regulation of zinc levels and cadmium detoxification (15Quaife C.J. Findley S.D. Erickson J.C. Froelick G.J. Kelly E.J. Zambrowicz B.P. Palmiter R.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7250-7259Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). However, the metal binding specificity of MT-4 is difficult to assess, as to date, only limited information regarding the metal binding properties of MT-4 containing divalent metal ions is available. The presented studies were conducted with the aim of gaining insight into the metal binding properties and the structural features of MT-4, which are likely responsible for its function in zinc metabolism. In our studies, we have replaced the spectroscopically silent Zn2+ ions in the mouse Zn7MT-4 structure by the Cd2+ and Co2+ ions and subjected these metal derivatives to detailed spectroscopic investigations. In the past, both Cd2+ and Co2+ ions have proven to be useful probes for zinc binding sites in MTs, affording a wealth of structural information on the native protein (6Vašák M. Romero-Isart N. King R.B. Encyclopedia of Inorganic Chemistry. 2nd. J. Wiley & Sons Ltd., New York2005: 3208-3221Google Scholar, 19Vašák M.

From the two-dimensional [113Cd-113Cd] COSY of 113Cd7MT-4, evidence for two distinct metal-thiolate clusters (i.e. a 3-metal and a 4-metal cluster) in this protein was obtained. Further studies on Cd7MT-4 and Co7MT-4 by electronic absorption, CD, and MCD spectroscopy and by mass spectrometry of partially and fully metal-loaded MT-4 afforded to us information regarding the coordination geometry of the metal sites, the pathway of cluster assembly, and their stability. The results are discussed in comparison with information available on the well characterized mammalian MT-1/2 isoforms. Materials—Media for protein expression were purchased from BD Biosciences. All other standard reagents were purchased of the highest purity available from common commercial sources. Construction of the MT-4 Expression Vector—The pBluescript plasmid containing the coding sequence of mouse MT-4 was received from Prof. R. Palmiter, University of Washington. The expression plasmid encoding MT-4 was constructed from the cloning vector pET24d (Novagen) carrying a T7 promoter. The T7 tag sequence was eliminated upon NcoI/EcoRI (Fermentas) digestion, and the MT-4 coding sequence was subcloned into the same restriction sites. The MT-4 sequence and the expression vector were ligated using T4 DNA ligase (Fermentas, Lithuania) and transformed into E. coli strain DH5α and BL21pLysS. The DNA sequence of the insert was verified by DNA sequencing (BigDye, Amersham Biosciences). Protein Expression and Purification—Mouse MT-4 was expressed in E. coli strain BL21pLysS and purified as described previously for MT-3 (22Faller P. Hasler D.W. Zerbe O. Klauser S. Winge D.R. Vašák M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10158-10167Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Kanamycin (30 mg/liter) was used as a selecting antibiotic during cultivation, a 0.5 mm concentration of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was used for induction, and a 0.6 mm concentration of Zn(CH3COO)2 was added upon induction. Preparation and Characterization of Cd7 MT-4—The apo-form of MT-4 was generated by the method of Vašák (23Vašák M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 205: 452-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and fully Cd2+- or 113Cd2+-loaded MT-4 was prepared by reconstitution (23Vašák M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 205: 452-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Metal-to-protein ratios were determined using a small aliquot of the sample. The metal concentration was determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (SpectrAA-110, Varian Inc.) and that of the protein via sulfhydryl group quantification (20 Cys/protein). The concentration of sulfhydryl groups was determined photometrically with 2,2′-dithiopyridine in 0.2 m sodium acetate/1 mm EDTA (pH 4) using ϵ343 = 7600 m–1 cm–1 (24Pedersen A.O. Jacobsen J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 106: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The metal-to-protein ratio of 7.0 ± 0.5 was obtained. The absence of disulfides and the full metal loading were confirmed by ESI-MS measurements of the reconstituted metalloprotein. Preparation and Characterization of Co(II)7 MT-4—The solutions used in Co2+ reconstitution were rendered oxygen-free by five freeze-pump-thaw cycles on a vacuum line and all sample preparation steps were performed in a nitrogen-purged glove box. The air-sensitive Co7MT-4 was obtained by the mixing of seven equivalents of CoCl2 with apoMT-4 (0.5 mm) in 0.1 m HCl. The solution mixture was then adjusted to pH 8.0 with 1 m Tris base, and the final salt concentration of 17 mm NaCl was adjusted with 2 m NaCl. The metal-to-protein ratio was checked using a small aliquot of the sample as described above. In the glove box, samples were transferred into 1 or 0.1 cm cap-sealed cuvettes for spectroscopic measurements. Preparation of CdMT-4 Samples for Spectroscopic Titration—All solutions used in the Cd2+ titration experiments were rendered oxygen-free by three freeze-pump-thaw cycles on a vacuum line and all samples prepared in a nitrogen-purged glove box. Individual apoprotein samples (9 μm) in 0.1 m HCl were titrated with increasing Cd2+ equivalents (1–8 equivalents). Subsequently, the pH value was adjusted with metal-free 1 m Tris base to 7.2. The final protein sample was contained in 10 mm Tris/HCl, 20 mm NaCl, pH 7.2. In the glove box, samples were transferred into a 1-cm cap-sealed cuvette for spectroscopic measurements. Preparation of CdMT-4 Samples for ESI-MS Titration—A stock solution of apoMT-4 (100 μm) in 10 mm HCl was rendered oxygen-free by three freeze-pump-thaw cycles on a vacuum line. To 200-μl aliquots of this solution increasing equivalents (from 0 to 7 equivalents) of a stock solution of CdCl2 (8.4 mm) were added. For ESI-MS analysis, samples were diluted by 20 mm NH4OH (200 μl), 0.02% CH3COOH, and 50% CH3CN (800 μl) (pH 6.0) to a final protein concentration of 10 μm. Samples were infused through a fused silica capillary (inner diameter, 75 μm) at a flow rate of 0.5 μl/min into a nano-ESI-MS quadrupole time-of-flight Ultima API mass sprectrometer (Micromass). Electrospray PicoTIPS (inner diameter, 30 μm) were obtained from New Objective (Woburn, MA). MS spectra were recorded in positive mode at a capillary exit voltage of 2.1 kV, cone voltage of 50 V, and RF lens energy of 50 V. Mass spectra were deconvoluted using the MaxEnt 1 software (Micromass, UK). Determination of Apparent Cd2+ Binding Constant by Photometric pH Titration—The apparent binding constants of Cd7MT-4 at pH 7.0 was determined as previously described by Kägi and co-workers (25Vašák M. Kägi J.H.R. Sigel H. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. 15. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York and Basel, Switzerland1983: 213-273Google Scholar, 26Kägi J.H.R. Vallee B. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2435-2442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the adapted expression of Wang et al. (27Wang Y. Mackay E.A. Kurasaki M. Kägi J.H.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, the release of Cd2+ from Cd7MT-4 was achieved by lowering of the pH value by the addition of increasing amounts of oxygen-free 1 m HCl. Prior to measurements, a stock solution of Cd7MT-4 was diluted to a final concentration of 5 μm in 10 mm Tris/HCl, 20 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, and rendered oxygen-free by three freeze-pump-thaw cycles on a vacuum line. The pH titration was performed on independent samples prepared in a nitrogen-purged glove box. Metal release was followed by recording absorption spectra between 320 and 210 nm in a sealed 1-cm cuvette. The pH was determined immediately after spectra recording using a microelectrode. The degree (D) of Cd2+ release is illustrated by plotting the pH values against the percentage of metal dissociation described by D = (A250i – A250,pH=1.5)/(A250,pH=8 – A250,pH=1.5), where A250i is the absorbance at 250 nm of the Cd2+-thiolate complex at different pH values and A250,pH=8 and A250,pH=1.5 represent the corresponding absorbance of Cd7MT-4 and the apoprotein, respectively. In the calculation of the apparent Cd2+ binding constant, the pKa values of the cysteine side chains were assumed to be equal to those reported for rabbit MT-1/2 isoforms (pKa = 8.9) (25Vašák M. Kägi J.H.R. Sigel H. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. 15. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York and Basel, Switzerland1983: 213-273Google Scholar). Spectroscopic Measurements—UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Cary 3 spectrophotometer (Varian). CD and MCD measurements were performed using a Jasco (Model J-810) spectropolarimeter equipped with a 1.5-tesla electromagnet for room temperature MCD measurements. A 1-cm quartz cuvette was used for CdxMT-4 measurements and a 1- or 0.1-cm quartz cuvette for Co7MT-4 measurements. The CD spectra are expressed as molar ellipticity [ (⊖)] in units of degrees dmol–1 cm2, and the MCD spectra are expressed as [ (⊖M)] in units of degrees dmol–1 cm2 tesla–1. 110.9-MHz one-dimensional 113Cd NMR spectra of 113Cd7MT-4 (1.7 mm) in 20 mm Tris/HCl and 40 mm NaCl, were recorded on a Bruker DRX-500 spectrometer at 293 K using an inverse-gated broad band proton decoupling, a 34,483-Hz spectral width, a 2.2-s acquisition time, and a 4.2-s pulse repetition rate (averaging 6000 free induction decays/spectrum). The two-dimensional [113Cd-113Cd] COSY spectrum of 113Cd7MT-4 (7 mm) was acquired using the standard COSY sequence in phase-sensitive mode with proton decoupling during acquisition. The evolution period t1 was varied in 207 increments from 0 to 10.5 ms covering a spectral width in the indirect (113Cd) dimension of 9.8 kHz. A total of 128 transients were accumulated for each value of t1. Chemical shifts are reported in parts/million with respect to 113Cd resonance of the external standard 0.1 m Cd(ClO4)2 in 2H2O. The NMR samples contained 20% 2H2O to provide the field frequency lock and were measured in 5-mm NMR tubes. Expression and Purification of MT-4—As described under “Experimental Procedures,” MT-4 was expressed and purified as the zinc protein. The presence of a single mass peak of 6275.5 Da (calculated mass 6276.5 Da) in the ESI-MS spectrum of metal-free MT-4 established the correctness of the recombinant protein. The cadmium-containing MT-4 was generated by the method of metal reconstitution as described above. The 113Cd-reconstituted 113Cd7MT-4 revealed a molecular mass of 7052.1 Da, which is in agreement with the calculated mass for MT-4 containing seven 113Cd2+ ions. The analytical gel filtration experiments revealed monomeric protein with an apparent molecular mass of ∼20 kDa (data not shown). The increased apparent molecular masses have also been reported for MT-1/2 and attributed to the non-globular shape of these molecules (22Faller P. Hasler D.W. Zerbe O. Klauser S. Winge D.R. Vašák M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10158-10167Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). One- and Two-dimensional 113Cd NMR Characterization of 113Cd7 MT-4—113Cd NMR proved to be a powerful tool in the investigation of the nature of metal binding sites and their organization in Cd-MTs (19Vašák M. Biodegradation. 1998; 9: 501-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 20Öz G. Pountney D.L. Armitage I.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 223-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 113Cd NMR experiments have been performed at 110.9 MHz and at 293 K. The one-dimensional 113Cd NMR spectrum of 113Cd7MT-4 shows seven major 113Cd signals at 667, 666, 661, 659, 640, 630, and 599 parts/million, corresponding to seven distinct metal binding sites. The 113Cd resonances have been numbered from 1 to 7 in the order of decreasing chemical shifts (Fig. 2A). The chemical shift positions of the seven major resonances of 113Cd7MT-4, which are very similar to those reported for other mammalian 113Cd7MTs (20Öz G. Pountney D.L. Armitage I.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 223-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the presence of 113Cd-113Cd spin splitting indicate that the seven Cd2+ sites are organized in a cluster structure(s) in which both bridging and terminal thiolate ligands participate in metal binding. Besides these major resonances, an additional four low intensity 113Cd resonances marked with an asterisk are also discerned (Fig. 2A). We found that, in different NMR samples, their intensities varied between 15 and 30% compared with those of the major 113Cd signals and that the overall 113Cd NMR profile was unaffected by a temperature increase from 293 to 323 K. The latter indicates that these resonances do not originate from a different cluster conformation. In addition, analytical gel filtration experiments performed after each NMR run also showed, besides the major chromatographic peak of a monomeric species, a peak of dimers (15–30%) that was formed at millimolar protein concentrations required in the NMR studies (data not shown). Because no dissociation of these dimers occurred after their rechromatography, this suggests that the dimers are linked through disulfide bond(s). Two-dimensional [113Cd-113Cd] COSY has been used to elucidate metal cluster organization in the previously studied MT isoforms (19Vašák M. Biodegradation. 1998; 9: 501-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 28Otvos J.D. Engeseth H.R. Wehrli S. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6735-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, to investigate the topology of the Cd-thiolate clusters in Cd7MT-4, the two-dimensional [113Cd-113Cd] COSY spectrum has been recorded at 293 K. In the spectrum analysis, only 113Cd connectivities among the major 113Cd signals of the monomer were considered. The two-dimensional plot of 113Cd7MT-4 COSY spectrum (Fig. 2B) on a “noise-free” level clearly shows the presence of five strong cross-peaks and an additional three weaker and partially resolved cross-peaks. Based on 113Cd connectivities, the topology of both metal clusters was determined (Fig. 2C). The selective association of the strong five cross-peaks with resonances 2, 5, 6, and 7 and the three weaker with resonances 1, 3, and 4 partitioned the seven 113Cd signals into two independent linkage groups. Thus, the seven metal binding sites in the protein are organized in two independent clusters, i.e. a 4-metal cluster (resonances 2, 5, 6, 7) and a 3-metal cluster (resonances 1, 3, 4). It may be noted that the observed 113Cd connectivities among the four low intensity 113Cd resonances of the dimers marked with the asterisk are in line with a slightly altered 4-metal cluster in this species. Considering that all of the cysteine residues in monomeric Cd7MT-4 are involved in metal binding (see also next paragraph), the NMR data suggest the presence of the Cd4Cys11 and Cd3Cys9 clusters in which five and three cysteine thiolates act as bridging ligands, respectively. The identical cluster topologies have also been found in the mammalian Cd7MT-1/2 (29Braun W. Vašák M. Robbins A.H. Stout C.D. Wagner G. Kägi J.H.R. Wüthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10124-10128Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 30Zangger K. Öz G. Otvos J.D. Armitage I.M. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2630-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Moreover, in view of the conserved array of 20 cysteine residues in all mammalian MTs, the Cd4Cys11 cluster of MT-4 would be located in the C-terminal α-domain and the Cd3Cys9 cluster in the N-terminal β-domain. Electronic Absorption, CD, and MCD Characterization of Co7 MT-4 and Cd7 MT-4—Because no direct information regarding the geometry of the metal binding sites and the clusters can be obtained from [113Cd-113Cd] COSY experiments, further spectroscopic investigations of the Co7MT-4 and Cd7MT-4 derivatives were conducted. To unambiguously establish the coordination geometry and ligation of metal binding sites in MT-4, the Co7MT-4 derivative was characterized by electronic absorption and room temperature MCD spectroscopy (Fig. 3). The visible region of the corresponding absorption spectrum shows a d-d profile characterized by two broad bands with maxima at 744 and 693 nm and a poorly resolved shoulder at ∼610–620 nm. The former two bands have their respective molar absorbances of 2700 and 2950 m–1 cm–1, i.e. ϵ = 386 m–1 cm–1 and 421 m–1 cm–1/Co2+-bound to protein, respectively. The position and the intensity of the d-d features are typical of tetrahedral tetrathiolate coordination reported for inorganic model complexes and other protein cobalt derivatives with cysteine thiolate ligands. The resolved d-d pattern can be assigned to the spin-allowed ν3 [4A2 → 4T1(P)] transition, as already described for rabbit liver MT-1 (31Vašák, M., Kägi, J. H. R., Holmquist, B., and Vallee, B. L. (1981) 20, 6659–6664Google Scholar). Evidence for tetrahedral tetrathiolate Co2+ coordination is provided by the MCD spectrum of Co7MT-4. The low energy region of the MCD spectrum shows a strong negative band at 743 nm with a pronounced shoulder at around 690 nm. In addition, a weak positive band at 628 nm and a weak negative band at 573 nm were observed. A similar overall pattern has been theoretically predicted and observed in a number of inorganic tetrahedral and pseudotetrahedral model compounds and in other Co2+ protein derivatives possessing these coordination geometries (Ref. 31Vašák, M., Kägi, J. H. R., Holmquist, B., and Vallee, B. L. (1981) 20, 6659–6664Google Scholar and references therein). Splitting of the ν3 transition in the absorption spectrum into three components with an energy separation of ∼2000 and 1000 cm–1 is larger than that expected from spin-orbit coupling alone. This and the molar extinction coefficient of the most intense band at 693 nm (421 m–1 cm–1/Co2+) is in agreement with a pseudotetrahedral symmetry of the sites (ϵ > 250 m–1 cm–1) (32Bertini I. Luchinat C. Sigel H. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. 15. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York and Basel, Switzerland1983: 101-156Google Scholar). Evidence for cobalt-sulfur coordination was obtained from the high energy part of the absorption spectrum, where a strong absorption band at 325 nm (ϵ = 20200 m–1 cm–1) and a shoulder ∼390 nm was observed. The position of the CysS-Co2+ LMCT transition at 325 nm and its intensity (ϵ = 1010 m–1 cm–1/CysS–Co2+ bond) are consistent with 20 Cys residues being involved in metal binding (33Vašák M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 3953-3955Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To learn more about the cluster geometry in Cd7MT-4, its electronic absorption, CD, and MCD spectra were examined (Fig. 4). The electronic absorption spectrum of Cd7MT-4 (Fig. 4A) shows a characteristic shoulder at ∼250 nm, a feature commonly found in mammalian Cd7MTs. By analogy, we assign the underlying metal-induced bands to CysS-Cd2+ LMCT transitions (34Vašák M. Kägi J.H.R. Hill H.A.O. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2852-2856Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). It should be noted that metal-free MT-4 (apoMT-4) does not show appreciable absorption above 230 nm due to the absence of aromatic amino acids and histidine. The molar extinction coefficient at 250 nm of ∼100,000 m–1 cm–1 reveals a value of 5000 m–1 cm–1/CysS–Cd2+ bond. The calculated value is closely similar to that reported for the CysS–Cd2+ bond in a number of Cd2+-substituted metalloproteins (35Henehan C.J. Pountney D.L. Zerbe O. Vašák M. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1756-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), confirming that all 20 cysteines in MT-4 are involved in metal binding. The corresponding MCD spectrum of Cd7MT-4 (Fig. 4C) shows a biphasic profile with bands at (–)258 and (+)236 nm with the inflection point at 247 nm reported also for other mammalian Cd7MTs (36Willner H. Vašák M. Kägi J.H.R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6287-6292Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 37Hasler D.W. Jensen L.T. Zerbe O. Winge D.R. Vašák M.

https://openalex.org/W2017417571,"Discrete tissue-specific changes in chromatin structure of the distal serpin subcluster on human chromosome 14q32.1 allow a single gene encoding α1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) to be expressed in astrocytes and glioma cells. This astrocyte-specific regulation involves activatory protein-1 (AP-1) because overexpression of dominant-negative c-jun(TAM67) abolishes ACT expression in glioma cells. Here we identify a new regulatory element, located within the –13-kb enhancer of the ACT gene, that binds nuclear factor-1 (NFI) and is indispensable for the full basal transcriptional activity of the ACT gene. Furthermore, down-regulation of NFI expression by siRNA abolishes basal ACT expression in glioma cells. However, NFI does not mediate astrocyte-specific expression by itself, but likely cooperates with AP-1. A detailed analysis of the 14-kb long 5′-flanking region of the ACT gene indicated the presence of adjacent NFI and AP-1 elements that colocalized with DNase I-hypersensitive sites found in astrocytes and glioma cells. Interestingly, knock-down of NFI expression also specifically abrogates the expression of glial acidic fibrillary protein (GFAP), which is an astrocyte-specific marker protein. Mutations introduced into putative NFI and AP-1 elements within the 5′-flanking region of the GFAP gene also diminished basal expression of the reporter. In addition, we found, using isoform-specific siRNAs, that NFI-X regulates the astrocyte-specific expression of ACT and GFAP. We propose that NFI-X cooperates with AP-1 by an unknown mechanism in astrocytes, which results in the expression of a subset of astrocyte-specific genes.

However, elevated ACT levels have been observed in several neuropathological disorders of the central nervous system, including Alzheimer disease (1Abraham C.R. Selkoe D.J. Potter H. Cell. 1988; 52: 487-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 2Pasternack J.M. Abraham C.R. Van Dyke B.J. Potter H. Younkin S.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1989; 135: 827-834PubMed Google Scholar). This drastic change in ACT expression is caused by proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, oncostatin M (OSM), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, which are released at the site of tissue damage (3Kordula T. Rydel R.E. Brigham E.F. Horn F. Heinrich P.C. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4112-4118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 4Kordula T. Bugno M. Rydel R.E. Travis J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7510-7516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ACT secreted by reactive astrocytes subsequently associates with the β-amyloid peptide, which is the major component of pathological deposits found in the brains of Alzheimer disease patients (1Abraham C.R. Selkoe D.J. Potter H. Cell. 1988; 52: 487-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). ACT belongs to the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) family of proteins and is also expressed in the liver and secreted into the plasma (5Potempa J. Korzus E. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15957-15960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gene encoding ACT is clustered with 10 additional serpin genes on human chromosome 14q32.1 and resides within the distal serpin subcluster that also contains genes encoding kallistatin, protein C inhibitor, and the kallistatin-like protein (6Rollini P. Fournier R.E. Genomics. 1997; 46: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 7Namciu S.J. Friedman R.D. Marsden M.D. Sarausad L.M. Jasoni C.L. Fournier R.E.K. Mamm. Genome. 2004; 15: 162-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The expression profile of the distal serpin subcluster is dramatically different between astrocytes and hepatocytes. All four genes are expressed in hepatocytes, whereas only the ACT gene is expressed in astrocytes (8Gopalan S. Kasza A. Xu W. Kiss D.L. Wilczynska K.M. Rydel R.E. Kordula T. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 763-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Investigations of the regulatory mechanisms controlling the selective expression of ACT in astrocytes and glioma cells demonstrated that the ACT gene is localized to the DNase I-accessible chromatin, whereas the promoters of the non-expressed protein C inhibitor and kallistatin genes are enzyme-inaccessible (8Gopalan S. Kasza A. Xu W. Kiss D.L. Wilczynska K.M. Rydel R.E. Kordula T. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 763-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In contrast to astrocytes, the entire distal subcluster resides within decondensed chromatin in hepatoma cells with all promoters easily accessible to DNase I (8Gopalan S. Kasza A. Xu W. Kiss D.L. Wilczynska K.M. Rydel R.E. Kordula T. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 763-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). During normal physiological conditions, ACT secreted into the plasma by hepatocytes is separated from the brain-derived ACT by the blood-brain barrier. Its expression in hepatocytes is likely determined by liver-specific transcription factors belonging to the hepatocyte nuclear factor and CAAT enhancer-binding protein families (9Rollini P. Fournier R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10308-10313Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast to hepatocytes, the constitutive astrocyte-specific expression of ACT requires the activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor, which is composed of the Jun and Fos family members (10Gopalan S.M. Wilczynska K.M. Konik B.S. Bryan L. Kordula T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1956-1963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Two AP-1 binding sites have recently been identified at –13 kb and –11.5 kb in the 5′-flanking region of the ACT gene, which are critical for astrocyte-specific expression (4Kordula T. Bugno M. Rydel R.E. Travis J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7510-7516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Gopalan S.M. Wilczynska K.M. Konik B.S. Bryan L. Kordula T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1956-1963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, glioma cells overexpressing dominant-negative c-jun(TAM67), which quenches functional AP-1 complexes and abolishes basal ACT expression, retained the astrocyte-specific chromatin structure of the distal serpin subcluster (10Gopalan S.M. Wilczynska K.M. Konik B.S. Bryan L. Kordula T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1956-1963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Several models have been hypothesized to explain this phenomenon, including the one that proposes the presence of an additional transcription factor(s) that, by virtue of its cooperation with AP-1, determine both astrocyte-specific chromatin structure and ACT gene expression. We initiated this study with the aim of identifying the hypothetical transcription factor(s) needed to determine chromatin structure and expression of the ACT gene in astrocytes and glioma cells. This study resulted in the identification of NFI-X, which is indispensable for the astrocyte-specific expression of the ACT gene. Furthermore, we provide evidence that NFI-X also regulates the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which is an astrocyte marker protein. Analysis of the 5′-flanking regions of both genes highlighted the presence of adjacent AP-1 and NFI elements, suggesting the existence of an astrocyte-specific molecular mechanism that facilitates tissue-specific expression of both genes and likely other astrocyte-specific genes. Cell Culture—Human hepatoma HepG2 and glioblastoma U373-MG cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD), and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, antibiotics, sodium pyruvate, and non-essential amino acids. Cytokines and Cell Stimulation—Cells were stimulated with 25 ng/ml OSM (R&D, Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) or 10 ng/ml IL-1 (a gift from Immunex Corp., Seattle, WA). One μm dexamethasone (Sigma Co.) was also added to enhance cytokine action. RNA Preparation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was prepared by phenol extraction exactly as described previously (8Gopalan S. Kasza A. Xu W. Kiss D.L. Wilczynska K.M. Rydel R.E. Kordula T. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 763-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The filters were prehybridized at 65 °C for 3 h in 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 7% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA, and hybridized in the same solution with cDNA fragments of ACT, GFAP, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase labeled by random priming. After the hybridization, non-specifically bound radioactivity was removed by four washes in 40 mm phosphate buffer, 1% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA at 65 °C for 20 min each. Synthetic Oligonucleotides—The following oligonucleotides were synthesized to generate fragments of the GFAP 5′-flanking region by PCR: 5′-GGGAGGATCCAGACAGCCAGGCCTTGTC-3′ and 5′-GAGCGGATCCCAGCGGAGGTGATGCGTCTC-3′. Reporters containing point mutations within the NFI and AP-1 elements in the 5′-flanking region of the GFAP gene were generated using the following primers: NFI site 1, 5′-GCTGAGAGATCTCCCCAGGGCCTCCTCTTC-3′ and 5′-GGGGAGATCTCAGCCCAATGCTGCCAGG-3′; NFI site 2, 5′-ACAGTCTAGATGTTCGGGGTGGGCACAG-3′ and 5′-AACATCTAGACTGTGCCAAGGTGAGTCATTC-3′; NFI site 3, 5′-TGCGGGATCCCCCCACCCCCTCAGGGGGGGGGCTAAG-3′ and 5′-GGGGGGATCCCGCAGCCCAGCTATGGGGAGAG-3′; and AP-1 site, 5′-GAATAAGCTTCCTTGGCACAGACACAATG-3′ and 5′-AAGGAAGCTTATTCACTGGGCATGAAGAG-3′. The following oligonucleotides were used in chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments to amplify a fragment of the ACT 5′-flanking region: 5′-GCTAAATCTGACAATTCTACC-3′ and 5′-CTGGACTTTCCTGCTGTCC-3′. A reporter containing a point mutation in the NFI site of the –13-kb enhancer of the ACT gene was generated using the following primers: 5′-GCCAAGATCTAACAGCCTTCCCTGCAG-3′ and 5′-TGTTAGATCTTGGCCATCGGAGCAGC-3′. The primer 5′-CTTTTAAGCTTAGTACCCATGCCCTTTG-3′ was used for the sequencing reaction. All nucleotides used in the gel retardation assays were designed to contain single-stranded 5′-overhangs of four bases at both ends after annealing. The ACT-NFI oligonucleotides used in electromobility shift assay (EMSA) had the following sequence: 5′-GATCTCCGATGGCCAGAAGCCACAAGCCA-3′ and 5′-GATCTGGCTTGTGGCTTCTGGCCATCGGA-3′. Plasmid Construction—Plasmid pΔACTCAT, pStACTCAT, p(mutAP-1)ACTCAT p4X(AP-1)CAT, and ptkCATΔEH were described previously (4Kordula T. Bugno M. Rydel R.E. Travis J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7510-7516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids p(mutNFI)ACTCAT and pmut(NFIandAP-1)ACTCAT are analogous to pΔ5ACTCAT and p(mutAP-1)ACTCAT, respectively, but contain point mutations within the NFI element. These constructs were generated by insertion of BamHI-digested PCR products into the BamHI site of pStACTCAT. Plasmid p5x(NFI)CAT was generated by cloning the double stranded ACT-NFI oligonucleotide into the BamHI site of ptkCATΔEH. Plasmid pGFAP(–1745)CAT was generated by inserting BamHI-digested PCR product into the BamHI/BglII sites of the reporter plasmid ptkCATΔEH. Plasmids p(mutNFIsite1)GFA PCAT, p(mutNFIsite2)GFAPCAT, p(mutNFI site3)GFAPCAT, and p(mutAP-1)GFAPCAT are analogous to pGFAP(–1745)CAT but with point mutations introduced within the NFI site 1, 2, and 3 or AP-1 site using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Strategene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transient Transfections and siRNA—Cells were transfected using GeneJuice transfection reagent (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany), according to the supplier's instructions. Plasmids (350 ng of the CAT reporter plasmid and 50 ng of the β-galactosidase expression plasmid) and 5 μl of GeneJuice diluted in 50 μl of serum-free medium were used for each well containing cells growing in 1 ml of culture medium. One day after transfection, cells were stimulated for 24 h and harvested. Protein extracts were prepared by freeze thawing, and the protein concentration was determined by the BCA method (Sigma Co.). Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described (11Delegeane A.M. Ferland L.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3994-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activities were normalized to the β-galactosidase activities. Experiments were repeated three to five times. NFI expression was knocked down using either general NFI siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or isoforms-specific SMARTpool siRNAs, which were specific for the NFI-A, NFI-B, NFI-C, and NFI-X (Dharmacon, Inc., Lafayette, CO). Nuclear Extract Preparation and EMSA—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (12Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar). Double stranded fragments were labeled by filling in the 5′-protruding ends with Klenow enzyme using [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Harbor C.S. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Gel retardation assays were performed according to published procedures using 2 μg of nuclear extracts (14Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar, 15Sawadogo M. Van Dyke M.W. Gregor P.D. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11985-11993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Competition experiments were performed in the presence of a 100-fold concentration of the cold oligonucleotides. Polyclonal anti-NFI antibodies that recognize all isoforms of NFI (sc-5567) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) and used for supershift studies. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Cells were treated with cytokines for 18 h, and chromatin was cross-linked by the addition of formaldehyde to 1%, followed by a 10-min long incubation at 37 °C. Subsequently, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 125 mm glycine and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Chromatin was sonicated and immunoprecipitated using anti-NFI antibodies (sc-5567) exactly as described in the chromatin immunoprecipitation protocol from Upstate Inc. (Charlottesville, VA). DNase I Footprint Analysis—DNase I footprinting of the –13-kb IL-1-responsive enhancer of the ACT gene was performed according to standard procedures (16Galas D.J. Schmitz A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 3157-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). The 579-bp long probe for the footprinting was prepared from the plasmid pΔACTCAT. The plasmid was digested with HindIII, labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) using T4 DNA polymerase, and subsequently digested with BglII. The HindIII/BglII fragment was gel-purified using the gel purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The fragment (10,000 cpm) was incubated with 15 μg of nuclear extracts from U373 cells for 10 min and subsequently digested with DNase I (1, 0.75, 0.5, and 0.3 units) for 3 min. DNA was purified by phenol extraction, followed by precipitation with ethanol, and samples were separated by electrophoresis in sequencing gels using standard procedures (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Harbor C.S. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Sequencing reactions were performed using the SequiTherm EXCEL™II DNA sequencing kit (Epicenter, Madison, WI). 1000 fmol of the template DNA and 2 pmol of the primer were used for the sequencing reactions. Identification of Transcription Factor Binding Sites—The putative transcription factor binding sites were identified using the MatInspector program. The Matrix Family Library version 5.0 was used with core/matrix similarity values set to 0.75/optimized. NFI Binds at the –13-kb IL-1 Enhancer of the ACT Gene—We have recently reported that the AP-1 complex is needed for the basal astrocyte-specific expression of the ACT and GFAP genes (10Gopalan S.M. Wilczynska K.M. Konik B.S. Bryan L. Kordula T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1956-1963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism that allows this ubiquitous transcription factor to determine astrocyte-specific expression is not known. One of the possibilities of its action could involve cooperation of AP-1 with yet to be identified factors. Because AP-1 binds to two AP-1 binding elements at –13 and –11.5 kb from the transcription start site of the ACT gene (4Kordula T. Bugno M. Rydel R.E. Travis J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7510-7516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Gopalan S.M. Wilczynska K.M. Konik B.S. Bryan L. Kordula T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1956-1963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we analyzed the fragments adjacent to the –13-kb AP-1 element for binding of novel transcription factors using DNase I footprinting. A strong footprint corresponding to the putative NFI binding site was detected using the 579-bp long DNA fragment that partially overlaps the –13-kb enhancer (Fig. 1A). This putative NFI binding site was further analyzed using nuclear extracts of both glioblastoma and hepatoma cells by EMSA. The in vitro binding of a transcription factor to the NFI putative binding site was detected in both cell types (Fig. 1B). The specificity of NFI binding was confirmed by competition, and the identity of NFI was verified using NFI antibodies (Fig. 1C). We have also analyzed the binding of NFI in the nuclei of U373 cells using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. NFI was detected bound to its site at the –13-kb enhancer in untreated U373 cells, and IL-1 treatment resulted in some increase of this binding. We conclude that NFI binds to the newly identified element within the –13-kb enhancer of the ACT gene in glioma cells. Functional Analysis of the NFI and AP-1 Elements—The previously identified 413-bp long ACT enhancer, located 13 kb upstream of the transcription start site, contains one functional AP-1 binding site and two NF-κB binding sites, which confer IL-1 responsiveness (4Kordula T. Bugno M. Rydel R.E. Travis J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7510-7516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate whether the newly identified proximal NFI element is critical for the activity of the enhancer, we introduced point mutations into the NFI element either alone or together with the mutation of the AP-1 element. Mutations within either the NFI or AP-1 sites reduced both basal and IL-1-induced expression of the ACT reporter (Fig. 2A). Moreover, mutation of both NFI and AP-1 elements within the reporter abolished its expression. These results indicate that both NFI and AP-1 are essential for the full activity of the ACT enhancer in glioma cells. We have also generated reporter constructs containing multiple copies of either NFI or AP-1 elements linked to the minimal tk promoter driving the transcription of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene. These constructs were tested in transient transfections of U373 cells (Fig. 2B). Multiple copies of the AP-1 element dramatically increased the basal activity of the reporter, which was further increased after IL-1 stimulation. In contrast, the basal expression of the NFI reporter was similar to that of the reporter containing the minimal tk promoter, and this expression was not activated by IL-1. We conclude that NFI by itself is not sufficient to mediate astrocyte-specific expression; however, it likely cooperates with AP-1 to mediate the full activity of the enhancer in glioblastoma cells. NFI siRNA Down-regulates ACT and GFAP Gene Expression in U373 Cells—Because the NFI element at –13 kb is occupied by NFI in glioma cells, and its mutation reduces the expression of reporter construct, we questioned whether depletion of NFI in these cells would affect endogenous ACT expression. In addition, we analyzed the expression of GFAP, which is an astrocyte-specific marker protein, because three putative NFI binding sites have previously been described in its 5′-flanking region (17Besnard F. Brenner M. Nakatani Y. Chao R. Purohit H.J. Freese E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18877-18883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of NFI was knocked down to 60% using siRNA, and the expression of ACT and GFAP mRNA was analyzed by Northern blotting. Interestingly, down-regulation of NFI expression almost completely abolished the basal expression of the astrocyte-specific ACT and GFAP genes but not a ubiquitously expressed glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (Fig. 3). In addition, OSM-induced expression of both genes was also diminished, however, to a much lower extent, indicating that cytokine-activated trans-acting factors are sufficient to drive transcription in the absence of NFI. We have also observed a dramatic down-regulation of GFAP expression by IL-1 as previously reported (18Selmaj K. Shafit-Zagardo B. Aquino D.A. Farooq M. Raine C.S. Norton W.T. Brosnan C.F. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 823-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 19Oh Y.J. Markelonis G.J. Oh T.H. Glia. 1993; 8: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Hence, NFI is critical for intrinsic astrocyte-specific expression of the ACT and GFAP genes. NFI and AP-1 Colocalize with the DNase I-hypersensitive Sites at the 5′-Flanking Region of the ACT Gene—Because knock-down of NFI expression or overexpression of dominant-negative c-jun(TAM67) (10Gopalan S.M. Wilczynska K.M. Konik B.S. Bryan L. Kordula T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1956-1963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) resulted in a drastic suppression of ACT expression in glioma cells, we analyzed the 14-kb long 5′-flanking region of the ACT gene for the presence of additional NFI and AP-1 binding sites using the MatInspector program. We identified 5 putative NFI, and 13 putative AP-1 elements in this region (Fig. 4) with 4 of the putative NFI elements localized near putative AP-1 elements. Furthermore, all four of these NFI/AP-1 clusters matched the DNase I-hypersensitive sites we had previously identified in astrocytes and glioma cells (8Gopalan S. Kasza A. Xu W. Kiss D.L. Wilczynska K.M. Rydel R.E. Kordula T. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 763-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This analysis suggested that NFI together with AP-1 may be responsible for the generation of these DNase I-hypersensitive sites in both astrocytes and glioma cells, which leads to astrocyte-specific expression of the ACT gene. NFI Binds to the Elements Located in the 5′-Flanking Region of the GFAP Gene—The 2.2-kb long 5′-flanking region of the GFAP gene is commonly used to drive the astrocyte-specific expression of transgenes (20Brenner M. Kisseberth W.C. Su Y. Besnard F. Messing A. J Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1030-1037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although, the molecular basis of the astrocyte-specific regulation of the GFAP promoter is not understood in detail, this promoter possesses three putative binding sites for NFI (17Besnard F. Brenner M. Nakatani Y. Chao R. Purohit H.J. Freese E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18877-18883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A). Because NFI siRNA efficiently blocked basal GFAP expression, we assayed the binding to putative NFI elements in vitro using nuclear extracts of U373 cells by EMSA. NFI was efficiently bound to the distal binding site (site 1), and it was also supershifted by the NFI antibodies (Fig. 5B). We have also observed several bands with the site 2 and site 3 oligonucleotides; however, these bands were not supershifted by the NFI antibodies (Fig. 5B). In addition, the site 2 oligonucleotides neither competed with binding to site 1 nor site 2, whereas binding to site 3 was partially competed by site 1 oligonucleotides. Sequence analysis of the GFAP 5′-flanking region revealed that an AP-1 binding site is located in the proximity of the two distal NFI sites. To evaluate the contributions of putative NFI and AP-1 binding elements, we generated reporter constructs with point mutations in each of these elements and analyzed their activities in U373 cells. We also stimulated cells with OSM, which activates GFAP expression via the STAT3 binding element located from –1518 to –1510. The reporter containing the wild type 5′-flanking region of the GFAP gene was efficiently expressed in U373 cells, and its activity was further increased by OSM (Fig. 6). However, a significant decrease in both the basal and OSM-activated expression was detected upon mutation of any of the NFI or AP-1 sites. Therefore, we conclude that the basal astrocyte-specific expression of the GFAP gene, similar to the basal astrocyte-specific expression of the ACT gene, depends on both AP-1 and NFI. NFI-X Is Critical for the Intrinsic Expressions of ACT and GFAP in U373 Cells—NFI is a family of transcription factors encoded by four genes (NFia, NFib, NFic, and NFix), which are expressed in numerous tissues (21Santoro C. Mermod N. Andrews P.C. Tjian R. Nature. 1988; 334: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 22Gronostajski R.M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 249: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). To determine which of the NFI isoforms are critical for the intrinsic astrocyte-specific expression of both ACT and GFAP, we knocked down the expression of NFI-A, NFI-B, NFI-C, and NFI-X mRNAs using specific SMARTpool siRNAs. The knock down of NFI-X expression (by 75%) reduced basal expression of ACT and GFAP by 50 and 70%, respectively (Fig. 7). However, the down-regulation of other NFI isoforms did not effect expression of either ACT or GFAP, with the exception of the knock down of NFI-C, which down-regulated GFAP expression by 40%. This result suggests that NFI-C, in addition to NFI-X, may specifically regulate the intrinsic expression of GFAP. Thus, we conclude that NFI-X is critical for the intrinsic astrocyte-specific expression of the ACT and GFAP genes. The expression pattern of the serpin genes located in the distal subcluster on chromosome 14q32.1 is determined by the tissue-specific chromatin structures of this subcluster (8Gopalan S. Kasza A. Xu W. Kiss D.L. Wilczynska K.M. Rydel R.E. Kordula T. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 763-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In astrocytes and glioblastoma cells, the expressed ACT gene is localized to the enzyme-accessible chromatin, whereas the neighboring genes are neither enzyme-accessible nor expressed (8Gopalan S. Kasza A. Xu W. Kiss D.L. Wilczynska K.M. Rydel R.E. Kordula T. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 763-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that AP-1 is indispensable for ACT expression in glioma cells; however, it is not sufficient to determine astrocyte-specific structure of the distal subcluster (10Gopalan S.M. Wilczynska K.M. Konik B.S. Bryan L. Kordula T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1956-1963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed the binding of nuclear proteins near the –13-kb enhancer, which contains an AP-1 binding element that is critical for ACT expression in astrocytes and glioma cells. Here we use DNase I footprinting, EMSA, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to show that NFI binds to a binding site located in the proximity of the AP-1 binding element (Fig. 1). This newly identified NFI element significantly contributes toward the basal ACT expression in glioma cells. This is based on the following observations: (i) this element is constitutively occupied by NFI in glioblastoma cells (Fig. 1D), (ii) knockdown of NFI (or specifically NFI-X) down-regulated the expression of ACT in glioblastoma cells (Figs. 3 and 7), and (iii) mutation of the NFI element reduced the basal and IL-1-induced expression of the ACT reporter (Fig. 2). However, the NFI element does not ensure efficient expression in glioma cells by itself, because the reporter containing several copies of the NFI element linked to the minimal tk promoter was not efficiently expressed in these cells (Fig. 2B). These results suggested that the astrocyte-specific expression of the ACT gene may be determined by NFI-X and AP-1, which cooperate in a tissue-specific manner in astrocytes and glioblastoma cells. However, the precise molecular mechanism of this cooperation remains unknown. The identification of NFI as a possible regulator of astrocyte-specific expression prompted us to analyze the expression of GFAP, which is an astrocyte-specific intermediate filament that is abundantly and almost exclusively expressed in astrocytes and glioma cells. It has already been shown that the 2.2-kb 5′-flanking region of the GFAP gene directs the astrocyte-specific transcription in cultured cells and transgenic animals (20Brenner M. Kisseberth W.C. Su Y. Besnard F. Messing A. J Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1030-1037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This 2.2-kb region contains three putative NFI binding sites (two at ∼1.5 kb, and a third located 70 bp upstream of the transcription start site) and one AP-1 binding element (17Besnard F. Brenner M. Nakatani Y. Chao R. Purohit H.J. Freese E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18877-18883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proximal NFI site has been shown to bind an unidentified factor present in the nuclear extracts of glioma cells, whereas the AP-1 element binds c-jun and c-fos family members (23Masood K. Besnard F. Su Y. Brenner M. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In agreement to the latter observation, we have recently demonstrated that dominant-negative c-jun(TAM67) abrogates expression of GFAP in glioma cells (10Gopalan S.M. Wilczynska K.M. Konik B.S. Bryan L. Kordula T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1956-1963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutation of the AP-1 site within the GFAP reporter drastically reduced its basal and OSM-induced expression (Fig. 6). Here we show that NFI binds only to the 5′-distal binding site in vitro, whereas the identity of the protein(s) that binds to the proximal site remains unknown (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, our mutational analysis of the three NFI binding elements indicated that all three elements are needed for full basal expression of the GFAP reporter (Fig. 6). The loss of GFAP expression upon knocking down the expression of NFI (Fig. 3) or its isoforms (NFI-X and partially NFI-C, Fig. 7) and the decrease in reporter activity upon mutation of the NFI elements (Fig. 6) argue that NFI-X is indispensable, whereas NFI-C contributes to the transcription of the GFAP gene. Therefore, we suspect that NFI-X (and likely NFI-C) binds to sites 2 and 3 in vivo in a cooperative manner, which cannot be recapitulated by EMSA using short oligonucleotides. In addition, we observed a substantial drop in the GFAP mRNA levels upon induction with OSM in the presence of NFI siRNA (Fig. 3). OSM has been shown to induce GFAP expression via the STAT3 binding element located in the 5′-flanking region of the gene. Our results suggest that depletion of NFI cannot be fully overcome by OSM-induced STAT3. Together these results indicate that NFI-X is critical for the astrocyte-specific expression of the ACT and GFAP genes and likely other genes that are specifically expressed in astrocytes and glioma cells. These results lead to the question as to how NFI mediates the expression of astrocyte-specific genes. NFI is a family of transcription factors encoded by four genes (NFia, NFib, NFic, and NFix) that are highly conserved from chickens to humans (21Santoro C. Mermod N. Andrews P.C. Tjian R. Nature. 1988; 334: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 22Gronostajski R.M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 249: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, products of these genes share a conserved N-terminal sequence, encoding DNA binding and dimerization domains, which allows binding to the canonical binding site [TTGGC(N)5GCCAA] and formation of homo- and heterodimers (24Gounari F. De Francesco R. Schmitt J. van der Vliet P. Cortese R. Stunnenberg H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 25Mermod N. O'Neill E.A. Kelly T.J. Tjian R.

Biol. 1985; 5: 964-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although all four NFI genes are expressed with overlapping spectra in most of the tissues, their transcripts are alternatively spliced yielding as many as nine different proteins from a single gene (27Kruse U. Sippel A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 28Altmann H. Wendler W. Winnacker E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3901-3905Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). NFI isoforms either activate or suppress transcription depending on the cell-type and promoter differences (22Gronostajski R.M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 249: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 29Murtagh J. Martin F. Gronostajski R.M. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2003; 8: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, NFI regulates numerous cell-specific and developmentally regulated genes in many cell types, including neurons (30Chaudhry A.Z. Lyons G.E. Gronostajski R.M. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 31Bedford F.K. Julius D. Ingraham H.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6186-6194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Behrens M. Venkatraman G.

Neurovirol. 1996; 2: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recently, NFia, NFib, and NFic genes have been disrupted in mice. NFia knock-out mice are characterized by dramatic neuroanatomical defects, whereas NFib is needed for both brain development and lung maturation (35Shu T. Butz K.G. Plachez C. Gronostajski R.M. Richards L.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 203-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Steele-Perkins G. Plachez C. Butz K.G. Yang G. Bachurski C.J. Kinsman S.L. Litwack E.D. Richards L.J. Gronostajski R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 685-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In contrast, disruption of NFic causes postnatal loss of molar roots (37Steele-Perkins G. Butz K.G. Lyons G.E. Zeichner-David M. Kim H.J. Cho M.I. Gronostajski R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1075-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The extensive defects in the brain development in NFia and NFib knock-out animals suggest that some NFI isoforms are critical for proper development of the central nervous system. In addition, overexpression of the NFI-X protein (also known as NFI class D) supports replication of the human JC polyomavirus, which specifically targets glial cells and causes demyelinating disease (38Monaco M.C. Sabath B.F. Durham L.C. Major E.O. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 9687-9695Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Our results, proposing a central role for NFI-X in astrocyte-specific expression of the ACT and GFAP genes, extend previous findings indicating that NFI isoforms are critical for brain development. Although the mechanism of NFI-X action is unclear, our data suggest it likely depends on cooperation with AP-1, which may lead to the cooperative recruitment of specific coactivator complexes. This is supported by the fact that NFI isoforms are known to cooperate with other transcription factors, including the glucocorticoid receptor and Oct1 to specifically regulate gene expression (39Mukhopadhyay S.S.

Furthermore, adjacent or overlapping NFI and AP-1 (or AP-2) sites have been observed in the regulatory regions of several genes specifically expressed in glial cells and neurons, including myelin basic protein, brain fatty acid-binding protein, S100B, mouse neurofilament L, γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor, promoter of JC virus, and proteolipid protein (42Amemiya K.

In summary, we show that NFI-X is indispensable for astrocyte-specific intrinsic expression of the ACT and GFAP genes. We propose that NFI-X cooperates with AP-1 by an unknown mechanism in astrocytes, which results in the expression of a subset of astrocyte-specific genes. We thank Daniel L.

https://openalex.org/W2024072975,"Cyclin D1 is a key regulator of cell proliferation, acting as a mitogen sensor and linking extracellular signaling to the cell cycle machinery. Strict control of cyclin D1 levels is critical for maintenance of tissue homeostasis. We have reported previously that protein kinase C α (PKCα), a negative regulator of cell growth in the intestinal epithelium, promotes rapid down-regulation of cyclin D1 (Frey, M. R., Clark, J. A., Leontieva, O., Uronis, J. M., Black, A. R., and Black, J. D. (2000) J. Cell Biol. 151, 763–778). The current study explores the mechanisms underlying PKCα-induced loss of cyclin D1 protein in non-transformed intestinal epithelial cells. Our findings exclude several mechanisms previously implicated in down-regulation of cyclin D1 during cell cycle exit/differentiation, including alterations in cyclin D1 mRNA expression and protein turnover. Instead, we identify PKCα as a novel repressor of cyclin D1 translation, acting at the level of cap-dependent initiation. Inhibition of cyclin D1 translation initiation is mediated by PKCα-induced hypophosphorylation/activation of the translational suppressor 4E-BP1, association of 4E-BP1 with the mRNA cap-binding protein eIF4E, and sequestration of cyclin D1 mRNA in 4E-BP1-associated complexes. Together, these post-transcriptional effects ensure rapid disappearance of the potent mitogenic molecule cyclin D1 during PKCα-induced cell cycle withdrawal in the intestinal epithelium.

Tight control of cell proliferation is essential for maintenance of normal homeostasis in self-renewing tissues such as the intestinal epithelium.

Several members of the PKC family are predominantly expressed/activated in non-proliferating and terminally differentiated intestinal cells (4Saxon M.L. Zhao X. Black J.D. J.

Consistent with this role, we have demonstrated that PKCα signaling triggers a program of cell cycle withdrawal in non-transformed intestinal crypt cells, paralleling the membrane translocation/activation of this enzyme precisely at the point of growth arrest within intestinal crypts in situ (3Frey M.R.

Although the extracellular signals that trigger growth arrest in the intestine in situ remain poorly characterized, a possible physiological activator of PKCα in this system is transforming growth factor β. This potent growth inhibitory factor is known to promote G0/G1 arrest in intestinal epithelial cells (9Ko T.C. Beauchamp R.D. Townsend Jr., C.M. Thompson E.A. Thompson J.C. Am. J.

Namba M. Huh N.H. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 979-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). One of the earliest events following PKCα activation in intestinal epithelial cells is down-regulation of cyclin D1 (3Frey M.R. Clark J.A. Leontieva O. Uronis J.M. Black A.R. Black J.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 763-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 7Frey M.R. Saxon M.L. Zhao X. Rollins A. Evans S.S. Black J.D. J. Biol.

Cyclin D1 is a key regulator of cell proliferation, acting as a mitogen sensor and linking extracellular signaling to the cell cycle machinery (13Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4961) Google Scholar). Progression through early G1 involves the activity of holoenzymes consisting of cyclin D (D1, D2, or D3 depending on the cell type) in association with cdk4 or cdk6. Cyclin D-dependent kinases promote cell cycle progression by initiating phosphorylation/inactivation of the retinoblastoma growth suppressor protein in mid G1, a process that is completed later in G1 by cyclin E/cdk2. Cyclin D/cdk complexes also have an important non-catalytic function that involves sequestration of cdk-inhibitory proteins of the Cip/Kip family, thus relieving repression of cyclin E- and cyclin A-cdk2 activity. Precise regulation of cyclin D1 accumulation is of critical importance. Increased expression of the molecule shortens the G1 interval in many cell types and can reduce/overcome dependence on physiological growth stimuli (14Weinstein I.B. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 857-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Decreased levels of the protein, on the other hand, lengthen G1 phase and reduce proliferation (14Weinstein I.B. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 857-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 15Filmus J. Robles A.I. Shi W. Wong M.J. Colombo L.L. Conti C.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3627-3633PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, cyclin D1 expression is subject to strict control at multiple levels, including transcription, message stability and nucleocytoplasmic transport, protein synthesis, and protein turnover (14Weinstein I.B.

Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 857-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In this study, we have explored the mechanisms underlying PKCα-induced down-regulation of cyclin D1 in IEC-18 non-transformed intestinal crypt cells. Our analysis of cross-talk between PKC signaling and cyclin D1 control unveiled a novel function for PKCα as a negative regulator of cyclin D1 translation initiation. PKCα modulates the activity of key translational regulators, including eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E and eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), to repress cyclin D1 protein synthesis during intestinal epithelial cell cycle withdrawal. Importantly, the engagement of translational rather than transcriptional mechanisms ensures a rapid effect (24Rajasekhar V.K. Holland E.C. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3248-3264Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), with disappearance of cyclin D1 protein preceding other hallmark events of cell cycle withdrawal, including induction of Cip/Kip cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and activation of the growth suppressor function of pocket proteins (3Frey M.R.

Northern Blot Analysis—Total cellular and cytoplasmic RNA were isolated using the RNeasy system (Qiagen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Nuclear RNA was similarly isolated from the nuclear pellet generated during the cytoplasmic RNA isolation procedure. Northern blot analysis of RNA samples (10 μg) was performed using randomly primed, 32P-labeled probe corresponding to mouse cyclin D1 cDNA, and specific hybridization was detected by phosphorimaging as we have described (25Bateman N.W.

In some experiments, cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Sigma), and extracts were incubated with 2–3 μg of sc-450 anti-cyclin D1 antibody. For immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged cyclin D1, transfected cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktails, and lysates were incubated with 50 μl of anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel. Analysis of Protein Stability—Cells were incubated in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4 mm glutamine, 5 μg/ml of insulin, and 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 30 min and then labeled with 94 μCi of [35S]Met/Cys Expre35S35S protein-labeling mixture (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1 h, prior to the addition of PMA or vehicle (ethanol) for 1 h. [35S]Met/Cys was chased for various times in label-free complete medium containing PMA or vehicle, and cells were harvested for cyclin D1 immunoprecipitation using sc-753 anti-cyclin D1 antibody. Immunoprecipitates were resolved on 20% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and 35S-labeled protein was detected and quantified using the Storm/ImageQuant PhosporImaging system (Amersham Biosciences). For analysis of cyclin D1 decay following protein synthesis inhibition, cells were treated with 50 μg/ml of cycloheximide after 1 h of PMA/vehicle treatment and harvested for Western blot analysis at various times thereafter. Biosynthetic Labeling—IEC-18 cells were incubated in methionine-free medium as described above and treated with PMA or ethanol for 30 min. Cells were then incubated in [35S]Met/Cys and PMA/vehicle for the indicated times as described (19Brewer J.W. Hendershot L.M. Sherr C.J. Diehl J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Plasmids and Transfection—FLAG-tagged wild-type and T286A mutant cyclin D1 constructs were gifts from Dr. C. Sherr (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN). Destruction box mutants (R29Q and L32A) were generated from the wild-type cyclin D1 construct using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and appropriate primers (sense strands: GGGTGCTGCAGGCCATGCTCAAG; GCGAGCCATGGCCAAGACGGAG). Cells in 60-mm plates were transfected with 5 μg of each construct (0.5 μg for the T286A mutant) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). In Vitro Cap Affinity Assay—Cap affinity chromatography was performed essentially as described (27Caron S. Charon M. Cramer E. Sonenberg N. Dusanter-Fourt I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4920-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). PMA- or vehicle-treated IEC-18 cells were harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100, supplemented with protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktails), and particulate material was removed by centrifugation. Cell lysates (350–400 μg of protein) were incubated with 50 μl of 7-methyl-GTP-Sepharose 4B slurry (Amersham Biosciences) for 16 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and cap-bound protein was eluted with Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Immunoprecipitation-RT-PCR Assay—PMA- or vehicle-treated cells were harvested in detergent-free lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol, containing protease/phosphatase inhibitors and 56 units/ml of RNase inhibitor (Sigma)) (28Fisher T.S. Taggart A.K. Zakian V.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1198-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Following removal of particulate material by centrifugation, lysates were supplemented with Tween 20 (0.5%), RNase inhibitor (53 units/ml), and dithiothreitol (0.1 mm), and 4E-BP1-containing complexes were immunoprecipitated using rabbit anti-4E-BP1 antibody (1.8 μg) and Protein A Dynabeads (Dynal). Beads were then washed twice (5 min) with lysis buffer containing 0.5% Tween 20 and once with lysis buffer without Tween 20 and resuspended in 45 μl of lysis buffer. 25 μl were taken for RNA isolation as described (28Fisher T.S. Taggart A.K. Zakian V.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1198-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and 20 μl were boiled in 2× Laemmli sample buffer for immunoblot analysis. Levels of cyclin D1 mRNA were assessed by RT-PCR in the presence of 50 μCi of [α32P]CTP using the Titanium one-step RT-PCR kit (Clonetech) and specific primers (GTCTTCCCGCTGGCCATGAACTAC; AAGAAAGTGCGTTGTGCGGTAGCA). PCR cycle number was empirically determined to be in the linear range of amplification. PCR products were resolved on 5% PAGE gels and visualized by phosphorimaging. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of cyclin D1 mRNA levels in immunoprecipitates was performed using the Full Velocity SYBR Green QRT-PCR Master Mix (Stratagene) and a 7300 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosciences). We have previously shown that activation of PKC signaling in IEC-18 non-transformed intestinal crypt cells results in cell cycle withdrawal (3Frey M.R. Clark J.A. Leontieva O. Uronis J.M. Black A.R.

Maintenance of cell cycle arrest requires sustained activation of PKCα, and the effect is reversed coincident with down-regulation of the enzyme. As shown in Fig. 1, PKC-induced cell cycle blockade is associated with marked changes in the levels of cyclin D1.

PKC agonist-induced down-regulation of cyclin D1 is blocked by the general PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I and by PKCα, -δ, and -ϵ depletion with 1 μm PdBu (Fig. 1C), confirming that the effect is PKC dependent. Notably, the PKCα-selective inhibitor Gö6976 also prevents the effect of PKC agonists, pointing to a key role for PKCα in regulating cyclin D1 levels in intestinal epithelial cells (Fig. 1D). Effects of PKC Signaling on Cyclin D1 mRNA—To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying PKC-induced loss of cyclin D1, the effects of PMA on cyclin D1 mRNA were examined by Northern blotting. As shown in Fig. 2, PMA did not affect total cyclin D1 mRNA levels at 1 h of treatment, a time when cyclin D1 protein was significantly down-regulated (Fig. 1A), although a slight decrease in mRNA levels was observed at later times (e.g. 2 h, data not shown). Analysis of nuclear and cytosolic mRNA further excluded the possibility that PKC activation affects cyclin D1 mRNA nucleocytoplasmic distribution (Fig. 2). Thus, PKC-induced reduction in cyclin D1 protein does not involve effects on the levels or distribution of cyclin D1 mRNA, at least during the initial stages of PMA treatment. PKC/PKCα Does Not Alter Cyclin D1 Protein Turnover—Cell cycle exit (e.g. under conditions of serum starvation or cell differentiation) has been linked to accelerated turnover of cyclin D1 protein (20Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 30Spinella M.J. Freemantle S.J. Sekula D. Chang J.H. Christie A.J. Dmitrovsky E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22013-22018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Therefore, [35S]methionine pulse-chase experiments were performed to determine whether PKC activation alters cyclin D1 stability in IEC-18 cells. As expected, PMA treatment resulted in lower recovery of 35S in cyclin D1 immunoprecipitates, reflecting the reduced cyclin D1 protein levels at the time points examined (1–2.5 h of PMA treatment) (Fig. 3A). However, PKC activation had no effect on the rate of decay of cyclin D1 protein (t½ ∼ 30 min), a result that was confirmed by examining cyclin D1 disappearance following inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide (data not shown). Degradation of cyclin D1 occurs via ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated proteolysis, triggered by its phosphorylation on Thr-286 by GSK-3β (20Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). An N-terminal (amino acids 29–32) destruction box (RXXL) has also been implicated in regulating proteasomal degradation of cyclin D1 (18Agami R. Bernards R. Cell. 2000; 102: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Consistent with the absence of alterations in cyclin D1 stability, PKC activation did not decrease the levels of inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK-3β on Ser-9 (Fig. 3B, upper panel), and inhibition of GSK-3β activity with Li+ did not block PMA-induced loss of cyclin D1 (although its accumulation following Li+ treatment confirmed a role for GSK-3β in normal turnover of cyclin D1 in IEC-18 cells) (middle panel). These data, together with the fact that PKC activation promoted the down-regulation of degradation-resistant cyclin D1 mutants, including the GSK-3β phosphosite mutant T286A (TA, lower panel) and the destruction box mutants R29Q (RQ) and L32A (LA) (Fig. 3C), confirmed that PKC-induced loss of cyclin D1 protein does not involve acceleration of cyclin D1 turnover. Activation of PKC/PKCα Inhibits Cyclin D1 Synthesis—[35S]Methionine biosynthetic labeling was performed to determine whether PKC signaling inhibits translation of cyclin D1. A reduction in radiolabeled cyclin D1 was detected in PMA-treated cells relative to vehicle-treated cells at each time point examined (Fig. 4). These data, together with the failure of PMA to affect cyclin D1 mRNA levels or protein stability (Figs. 2 and 3), point to repression of cyclin D1 translation as a mechanism underlying loss of cyclin D1 in PKC agonist-treated cells. PKC/PKCα Activates 4E-BP1, Inhibits Cap-dependent Translation Initiation, and Leads to Sequestration of Cyclin D1 mRNA in 4E-BP1-associated Complexes—To gain insight into the molecular basis for PKC-mediated inhibition of cyclin D1 synthesis, we examined the effects of PKC activation on key regulators of translation initiation, including eIF4E and eIF2α. eIF4E binds the 5′-cap structure (m7GpppN, where N is any nucleotide) found in the majority of eukaryotic mRNAs and associates with eIF4G and eIF4A to form eIF4F, a translation initiation complex that mediates recruitment of ribosomes to mRNA (31Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar). A major mechanism for control of eIF4E function is through its interaction with a family of translational inhibitory proteins, the eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs), the best characterized of which is 4E-BP1 (31Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar). The hypophosphorylated α and β forms of 4E-BP1 compete with eIF4G for binding to eIF4E, thereby preventing eIF4F assembly and inhibiting cap-dependent translation. In contrast, the hyperphosphorylated γ form is unable to bind eIF4E. Immunoblot analysis revealed that PMA treatment leads to rapid hypophosphorylation/activation of 4E-BP1 (Fig. 5A), evident by the appearance of the faster migrating α/β forms within 15 min. 4E-BP1 hypophosphorylation was also seen with other PKC agonists including PdBu, Bryo, and DiC8 (Fig. 5B), and the PKC dependence of the effect was confirmed using PKCα-, PKCδ-, and PKCϵ-depleted cells (Fig. 5C). Use of cells depleted of PKCδ and -ϵ, but not PKCα, by PMA pulse treatment (7Frey M.R. Saxon M.L. Zhao X. Rollins A. Evans S.S. Black J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9424-9435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) demonstrated that PKCα can mediate PMA-induced hypophosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (Fig. 5D), and a requisite role for PKCα signaling was confirmed using the PKCα-selective inhibitor Gö6976 (Fig. 5E). To determine whether the PKC-induced accumulation of 4E-BP1 α/β phosphoforms reflected an increase in 4E-BP1 activi"

In βTC3 insulinoma cells, PDE7A1 co-localizes with PKA II in the Golgi-centrosome region. The roles PDE7A1 and its regulatory region play in cAMP signaling were examined by studying interactions with PKA subunits. PDE7A1 associates with the dissociated C subunit of PKA (C), but does not bind tetrameric PKA holoenzyme. High affinity binding of C by PDE7A1 inhibits kinase activity in vitro (IC50 = 0.5 nm). The domain containing PKA pseudosubstrate sites at the N terminus of PDE7A1 mediates complex formation with C. The PDE7A1 N-terminal repeat region inhibits C activity in CHO-K1 cells and also suppresses C dependent, cAMP-independent, physiological responses in yeast.

Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is a second messenger that mediates diverse cellular responses to hormones and neurotransmitters.

PKAs phosphorylate multiple substrates and thereby regulate a broad range of physiological processes including gene expression via CREB/ATF and co-stimulatory transcription factors, glycogenolysis, lipolysis, catecholamine biosynthesis, synaptic transmission, and ion channel/transporter activities (1Edelman A.M.

PKA activity is stimulated by binding of cAMP to the regulatory subunits of inactive, tetrameric PKA complexes, and the consequent dissociation of active catalytic subunits. Free catalytic subunit (C) phosphorylates PKA substrates including nuclear targets. During interphase, the vast majority of PKA regulatory subunits and tetrameric complexes are excluded from the nucleus. A substantial proportion (principally PKA II) can be tethered to specific subcellular sites via interactions with anchor proteins (8Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 467-479PubMed Google Scholar). Subcellular targeting of PKA is often required for efficient transduction of cAMP signals (9Edwards A.S. Scott J.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of PKA activity is achieved via PDE-mediated degradation of cAMP, dissociation of ligands from receptors, receptor desensitization, inhibitory G proteins, GTPase-activating proteins, holoenzyme reassociation, C degradation, compensatory expression of PKA regulatory subunit, and direct inhibition by the PKA inhibitor, PKI (10Lefkowitz R.J.

The hinge regions of the type I and type II regulatory subunits of PKA interact with the catalytic cleft of C via their PKA pseudosubstrate and substrate sites, respectively (19Buechler Y.J.

Cyclic nucleotide PDEs are classified into eleven families based on their amino acid sequence, sensitivity to cofactors and inhibitory drugs and substrate specificity and affinity (25Conti M. Jin S.L. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 63: 1-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Francis S.H. Turko I.V. Corbin J.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 65: 1-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PDEs have similar C-terminal catalytic domains and divergent N-terminal regulatory domains that contain cofactor or cGMP binding sites, targeting, and other regulatory sequences. Both cell type-specific gene expression and variable mRNA splicing further diversify the isozyme composition of the cyclic nucleotide PDE superfamily in mammals. PDE7A is a high affinity cAMP-specific PDE that we isolated by functional complementation of phosphodiesterase deficient yeast (27Michaeli T. Bloom T.J. Martins T. Loughney K. Ferguson K. Riggs M.

Within the regulatory domain of the PDE7A1 splice variant, a motif that contains a PKA pseudosubstrate site is tandemly repeated. The presence of PKA pseudosubstrate sites in PDE7A1 N terminus raises the possibility that, like PKI and PKA regulatory subunits, PDE7A1 can limit cAMP signaling by binding and inhibiting C.

Immunoprecipitated proteins were released from the beads by boiling in sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunodetection on Western blots with affinity-purified rabbit anti-PDE7A antibodies (1:500), rabbit anti-C antibodies (1:1000), and rabbit anti-PKA RIIα antibodies (1:1000). Indirect Immunofluorescence—Cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips for 2–3 days, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min, and permeabilized with 0.25% Nonidet P-40 for 15 min. After several PBS washes, slides were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, and then incubated with primary antibody for 1.5 h in blocking buffer with the following antibodies: rabbit anti-PDE7A1 (1:50), anti-RIIα monoclonal antibodies (1:25, Transduction Laboratories), anti-β-COP monoclonal antibodies (1:200, Stressgen), anti-γ-tubulin monoclonal antibodies (1:300, Sigma). After washes with 0.2% Nonidet P-40/PBS, cells were incubated with appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to fluorescent dyes at a dilution of 1:100 for 1 h. Slides were mounted with DABCO anti-fade mounting medium and visualized by fluorescence confocal microscopy. Expression, Purification, and Folding of Bacterial Histidine-tagged Proteins—Expression plasmids for His-tagged full-length PDE7A1, and the M2 and N-ter deletions, were transformed into BL21 (DE3) bacterial cells. Expression was induced with 0.4 mm IPTG for 3 h at 37 °C. His-tagged full-length PDE7A1, M2 and N-ter proteins were found in inclusion bodies of cell extracts after two rounds of 900 psi pressure (French press) and followed by three rounds of 1 min of sonication pulse with a 3-min interval in extraction buffer containing 0.1 m Tris, pH 8 and 1 mm EDTA. Pellets were separated by centrifugation at 39,000 × g for 20 min and solubilized in 6.75 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8. The supernatant after a 15 min, 10,000 × g spin, and 0.45-μm filtration, was incubated with pre-equilibrated Ni2+-NTA-charged beads at 4 °C for 30 min with gentle rocking in binding buffer containing 6.75 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8, 0.5 m Nacl, 18 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm imidazole. The beads were washed with 10-bed volumes of binding buffer, 5-bed volumes of wash buffer (binding buffer with 25 mm imidazole), 5-bed volumes of wash buffer II (binding buffer with 50 mm imidazole), and 5-bed volumes of elution buffer (binding buffer with 100 mm imidazole). Renaturation of the purified His-PDE7A1 proteins was carried out in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 1 m arginine·HCl, 50% ethylene glycol, 0.2 m MgCl2 and 5 mm DTT at 0.4 μg/ml at 10°C for 16 h as described by Richter et al. (34Richter W. Hermsdorf T. Kronbach T. Dettmer D. Protein Expr. Purif. 2002; 25: 138-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Following dialysis against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20% ethylene glycol, and 2 mm DTT, renatured proteins were quantified following SDS-PAGE and silver staining. His-PDE7A1 proteins with specific activity ranging from 9.6 to 43.375 pmol/min/μg were picked for further analysis. Expression and Purification of GST-PDE7A1 from Yeast—The GST-PDE7A1 expression plasmid was transformed into RS334 cells, and transformants were grown exponentially in synthetic medium lacking uracil. GST-PDE7A1 expression was induced with 4% galactose for 6 h. Protein extracts were prepared with glass beads in PBS buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was subjected to glutathione-Sepharose purification as recommended by Amersham Biosciences. PKA Activity Assays and PDE7A1 Phosphorylation—Recombinant C (Cell Signaling) was assayed for phosphotransferase activity using the synthetic peptide kemptide (Sigma) as a substrate. 25-μl reactions contained 50 mm MOPS, pH 7, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 μm ATP, 250 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 200 μm kemptide, 6000 Ci/mmol of [γ-32P]ATP, and 0.1 ng of C. Increasing amounts of purified full-length PDE7A1, the deletions M2 and N-ter, PKI (native protein, Calbiochem), or no protein, in a fixed volume of dilution buffer were added to the reactions. Reactions were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, chilled on ice, and then dotted onto Whatman P-81 ion exchange paper. Paper discs were washed three times in 75 mm phosphoric acid, once with 95% ethanol, dried, and subjected to liquid scintillation counting. In vitro phosphorylation of His-PDE7A1 or GST-PDE7A1, was carried out with recombinant C that was purified from Escherichia coli and lacked contaminating PDE activities (Calbiochem). Renatured His-PDE7A1 and M2 proteins (1.2 and 1 ng, respectively), and purified RIIα (1 ng) were incubated with 1 ng of C subunit in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 μm ATP, and 1.2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 37 °C. Phosphoproteins were detected by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. GST-PDE7A1 purified from yeast was incubated with 125 ng of C in the buffer indicated above. After a 15-min incubation period at 30 °C with continuous mild shaking for GST-PDE7A1 beads, proteins were boiled in SDS sample buffer. To measure PDE activity, kinase reaction was carried out in the absence of [γ-32P]ATP. PDE assays were performed after the beads were washed three times in a buffer containing 40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2 at 4 °C. PDE Assays—PDE activity assays were performed in 40 mm Tris pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 unit of snake venom nucleotidase, 0.7 μm cAMP, and 0.3 μm of 2,8-[3H]cAMP. Reactions were carried out for 15 min at 30 °C and terminated by addition of 10 mm EDTA, 1.25 mm of AMP, and of cAMP. Adenosine and cAMP were separated by anion exchange chromatography (AG-1-X8, Bio-Rad). Adenosine was eluted with 4 ml of 50% ethanol and the 3H content of the eluate was determined. Expression and PKA Activity in CHO-K1 Cells—CHO-K1 cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing a heterodimeric ecdysone receptor (pVgRXR, Invitrogen). PDE7A1-derived deletion mutants were cloned into the expression vector pIND(SP1) and electroporated into CHO-VgRXR cells. Expression of PDE7A1-derived proteins was induced with 10 μm Pronasterone A for 24 h, and the cells were then removed from the culture plates with 0.5 mm EDTA, and washed with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 250 mm sucrose. Cells were then stimulated with 10 μm forskolin for 10 min, extracted, and subjected to kinase assays using kemptide as a substrate in the absence and presence of 100 nm PKI and in the absence and presence of 10 μm cAMP. Co-electroporation with EGFP expression vector demonstrated transduction efficiencies higher than 95%. Association of PDE7A1 with the Catalytic Subunit of PKA—Two repeated sequences, eighteen amino acids each, within the PDE7A1 N terminus contain PKA pseudosubstrate sites (RRGAI) where alanine replaces the phosphorylatable serine/threonine residue of the RRXSF PKA consensus phosphorylation site (Fig. 1). To determine whether these pseudosubstrate sites, or other domains within the PDE7A1 sequence, promote interaction with C, we investigated possible associations between PDE7A1 and PKA by co-immunoprecipitation assays. C, but not the type II regulatory subunits of PKA (RII), was observed in anti-PDE7A1 immunoprecipitates from βTC3 cell extracts (Fig. 2). RI regulatory subunits of PKA were also excluded from immune complexes isolated with anti-PDE7A1 antibodies (not shown). PDE7A1 and C were isolated specifically by anti-PDE7A1 antibodies and not with preimmune immunoglobulins. An identical co-immunoprecipitation pattern was observed when cells were lysed in 10-fold larger volume, indicating that the association between PDE7A1, and C is not likely to occur during, or after, extraction. Typically, 40% of the cellular PDE7A1 and 2% of C were bound by anti-PDE7A1 antibodies. Thus, correcting for recovery, it appears that about 5% of cellular C associates with PDE7A1 in unstimulated cells. The fraction of cellular C associated with PDE7A1 did not increase upon hormonal stimulation with glucagon like peptide 1 or upon adenylyl cyclase activation with forskolin.FIGURE 2Co-immunoprecipitation of PDE7A1 with C. 100 μg of soluble βTC3 protein extract were immunoprecipitated with either preimmune immunoglobulins (Pre) or with affinity-purified chicken anti-PDE7A1 antibodies (IP). 10 μg of cell extract (Ex) and immune complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Immunodetection of PDE7A, C, and PKA RII was carried out with rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against these proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Co-localization of PDE7A1 and PKA II—To assess the proximity of PDE7A1 to PKA in unstimulated cells we examined the subcellular localization of PDE7A1 and PKA in βTC3 insulinoma cells. Both PDE7A1 and PKA RIIα regulatory subunits co-localized with the Golgi apparatus and centrosomes (Fig. 3). Co-immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy of PDE7A1 and RII demonstrated their co-localization in an area adjacent to the nucleus that includes an intensely fluorescent spot (Fig. 3, panels A and B). Diffuse background staining throughout the cytoplasm was indistinguishable from staining observed with purified rabbit preimmune immunoglobulins (Fig. 3, panel H). Co-staining with antibodies to the Golgi-associated coatmer protein, β-COP, demonstrated that PDE7A1 associates with the outer face of Golgi membranes (Fig. 3, panels C and D). PDE7A1 also co-localized with γ-tubulin at the centrosome, an intensely labeled spot adjacent to the nucleus and within the Golgi area (Fig. 3, panels E and F). Association of PDE7A1 with the outer face of the Golgi apparatus was disrupted upon treatment with nocodazole (Fig. 3, panel G), suggesting that PDE7A1 localization to the Golgi may be mediated via interactions with microtubules or with microtubule-associated proteins. Consistent with the resistance of γ-tubulin and the centrosome to nocodazole, the distribution of PDE7A1 to the centrosome was not affected by nocodazole and thus appears to be mediated by interactions that differ from those localizing PDE7A1 to the Golgi area. These observations demonstrate the coordinated subcellular localization of PDE7A1 and PKA II to the Golgi-centrosome perinuclear area. In accordance with disruption of microtubule structures upon cold isotonic extraction, a high proportion of the PDE7A1 and RII proteins were found in the cytosol. PDE7A1 and RII associated with particulate fractions were resistant to extraction with salt and a non-ionic detergent and may represent a subpopulation tightly associated with anchor proteins in these cell fractions (not shown). Association of PDE7A1 and RII proteins with the outer face of the Golgi appear to be mediated via protein-protein interactions that are disrupted during extraction. Co-immunoprecipitation of PDE7A1 and C; however, demonstrates that at least some of the interactions between the two proteins are preserved in βTC3 cell extracts. PDE7A1 N-terminal Repeats Are Required for Interaction with C—To confirm the interaction between PDE7A1 and C and map domain(s) required for association, we utilized the yeast two hybrid interaction detection system. The interaction of a bait consisting of a fusion of the LexA DNA binding domain to PDE7A1 with a fusion of the GAL4 transcription activation domain to C was detected by growth on histidine selection plates (Fig. 4). Analysis of several PDE7A1 N-terminal deletions demonstrated that the N-terminal repeats of PDE7A1 are required for its interaction with C. A single repeat, RP2, was sufficient for interaction with C, but truncations that removed"

However, this hypothesis relied predominately on overexpression of tagged proteins due to the lack of a reliable BS69 antibody. We present for the first time a complete sequence of BS69 and valuable tools to characterize the endogenous protein. We show that the full-length BS69 protein, as well as minor alternatively spliced isoforms, is ubiquitously expressed, nuclear, and associates with chromatin and mitotic chromosomes. Accordingly, BS69 interacts with a set of chromatin remodeling factors, including ATP-dependent helicases, histone deacetylases, and histone methyltransferases, as well as the E2F6 transcription factor. These data strengthen a role for BS69 in gene repression and link BS69 to chromatin remodeling.

These data strengthen a role for BS69 in gene repression and link BS69 to chromatin remodeling. BS69 was originally defined as a cellular protein targeted by the adenoviral E1A and the Epstein-Barr viral EBNA2 proteins (1Hateboer G. Gennissen A. Ramos Y.F. Kerkhoven R.M. Sonntag-Buck V.

Further analysis revealed that BS69, via its cysteine-rich MYND domain, recognizes a similar PXLXP peptide motif present in both viral proteins as well as in cellular partners. In vitro, binding of viral proteins to BS69 led to the disruption of the cellular BS69-associated complexes (2Ansieau S. Leutz A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4906-4910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Despite its potential tumor suppressor gene properties, the function of BS69 remains elusive. The protein was found to associate with various transcription factors such as c-Myb, B-Myb, MGA, and Ets-2 as well as the EMSY protein, a recently identified BRCA2 negative regulator (3Ladendorff N.E.

In keeping with its potential role in gene regulation, the BS69 protein displays a set of domains (bromo, PHD, PWWP, and MYND) generally found in gene regulators (7Stec I.

(Paris). 2003; 51: 397-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, further investigation of BS69 in vivo functions was hindered by the lack of reliable antibody and functional tests. The results presented herein clearly show that the main product of the BS69 gene is a ubiquitous protein of 74 kDa, with three additional minor truncated isoforms generated through alternative splicing mechanisms. All four products were found to be unstable, subject to degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway, nuclear, and associated with chromatin and mitotic chromosomes. In keeping with its potential role in gene repression, we further found that the endogenous full-length BS69 protein immunoprecipitated a set of chromatin remodeling factors. Constructs—The human BS69 cDNAs were obtained by reverse transcription-PCR. First strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA extracted from IMR90 human primary fibroblasts using Superscript™ II (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) (Invitrogen). PCR was performed with the primer pairs 1 + 2 (for the variants encompassing a MYND domain) and 1 + 3 (for the MYND-less variants) by means of 25 cycles at an annealing temperature of 55 °C. PCR products were subcloned into the pRC-CMV or into the FLAG-pcDNA3 expression vectors (12Dechend R. Hirano F. Lehmann K. Heissmeyer V. Ansieau S. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. Leutz A.

BS69 deletion mutants and BS69 fusion proteins (GFPmut1 variant, Gal4DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1–147)) were generated by PCR and cloned into the vertebrate expression vector pcDNA3 or FLAG-pcDNA3.

The shRNA directed against the BS69 RNA was designed using the target sequence CCGGATGAAGTCGGACCACAA. A shRNA directed against the luciferase GL3 sequence CTTACGCTGAGTACTTCGA was used as a control. Oligonucleotides were subcloned into the pRS expression vector (13Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R.

HA-tagged Brahma, Myc-tagged HDAC-1, Myc-tagged EZH1/2, HA-tagged E2F6, and HA-tagged ubiquitin expression vectors were generously provided by Christian Muschardt, Bernard Luscher, Susanne Opravil, Stefan Gaubatz, and Samuel Buchbaum, respectively. Antibodies—A peptide encompassing the residues 358–441 of the human BS69 protein (GenBank™ accession number X86098) was expressed in bacteria as a GST fusion protein, purified by affinity chromatography on gluthatione beads, and used as immunogen in rabbits. The resultant polyclonal antibody was purified by immuno-affinity using the GST orientation kit (Pierce).

Gaubatz, unpublished data. Non-immune IgG was purchased by Sigma. Cell Culture—Murine and human cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mm Hepes, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C. The quail fibroblasts QT6 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 8% fetal calf serum and 2% chicken serum, 10 mm Hepes, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 39 °C. For inhibition of the proteasome, MG132 (5 μm for QT6 fibroblasts; 10 μm for 293T, Calbiochem) and epoxomicin (2 μm, Calbiochem) were added to medium. Pulse-Chase Experiments—HeLa cells (8 × 105) were transiently transfected with 2 μg of full-length BS69 pRC-CMV expression vector. Cells were incubated with a methionine- and cysteine-free medium (Invitrogen) for 45 mn, pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and cysteine (50 μCi/ml cell-labeling Promix, Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h and chased for different times in the presence of 10 μm MG132 (or Me2SO). BS69 expression was examined by immuno-precipitation using 2 μg of BS69 polyclonal antibody. In Vivo Ubiquitination Assays—In vivo ubiquitination assays were performed as described (16Kuo M.L. den Besten W. Bertwistle D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1862-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells (2 × 106) were transiently co-transfected with 0.5 μg of the full-length BS69 expression vector and an increasing amount of the HA-ubiquitin pTL1 expression vector. 24 h post-transfection, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide and protease inhibitors, sonicated, and cleared by centrifugation. Equal amounts of proteins were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of α-BS69 antibody and incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads. Bead washes were performed in RIPA buffer. Ubiquitinated-BS69 proteins were visualized by Western blotting with a monoclonal α-HA antibody (Babco). Cell Fractionation Assays—293T cells (5 × 106) were transfected with 2 μg of BS69 expression vectors. Fractionation assays were performed according to Ref. 17Mendez J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8602-8612Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar. BS69 Knockdown and Immunofluorescence—293T cells were transiently transfected with 5 μg of BS69-shRNA or luc-shRNA in pRS and maintained 3 days under selection. Cells were fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution, permeabilized in a 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20 (TBST) buffer supplemented with 0.4% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Cells were successively blocked in a TBST, 3% bovine serum albumin, 2% gelatin buffer for 30 mn, incubated with the α-BS69 antibody (3.6 μg/ml in blocking solution), washed with TBST, incubated with a rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1/2500, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), washed in TBST, and stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. In experiments employing the GFP fusion proteins, cells were similarly fixed, permeabilized and stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Images were observed with an axioplan 2 microscope (Zeiss). Protein Interaction Analysis Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments and GST Pulldown Assays—QT6 fibroblasts (3 × 106) were transfected with 3 μg of each expression vector. Cells were successively lysed in a 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors, sonicated, and cleared by centrifugation. Lysates were immunoprecipitated either with 3 μg of the monoclonal α-FLAG (Stratagene), 3 μg of the monoclonal α-HA (Babco), or 2 μg of a polyclonal α-Myc antibody (tebu-bio) at 4 °C for 4 h. Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were washed in extraction buffer, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitations employing the endogenous BS69, RACK7, EZH2, BRG1, HDAC1, and E2F6 proteins were performed from 107 293 cells. Nuclear extracts, generated as described in Ref. 17Mendez J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8602-8612Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, were lysed in a 100 mm NaCl, 30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, EDTA (1 mm for BS69 immunoprecipitation and 10 mm for RACK7 immunoprecipitation), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4% Triton X-100, 4% glycerol extraction buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of α-BS69 or 5 μg of α-RACK7 antibody at room temperature for 2 h. GST pulldown assays were performed as described in Ref. 2Ansieau S. Leutz A. J. Biol.

Ramos Y.F. Kerkhoven R.M. Sonntag-Buck V. Stunnenberg H.G. Bernards R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3159-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) with the data base entries revealed a disparity in the 5′ extremity potentially encoding for forty additional amino acids. The extra sequences perfectly map to all expressed sequence tag sequences available and are extremely well conserved during evolution (Fig. 1). To clarify this point, BS69 was cloned by PCR using primers corresponding to both proposed sequences and ectopically expressed. Indeed, comparison of the cDNA translation products with the endogenous protein by SDS-PAGE confirmed that the additional sequences are included in the protein (Fig. 1B). Knockdown of endogenous BS69 by small interfering RNA further confirmed the identity of the 74-kDa band (Fig. 1B). We also identified variants of the BS69 protein (Fig. 1A). The alternative splicing of exon III gives rise to an additional RNA encoding for a protein lacking the PHD domain. The boundaries and the alternative splicing of the exon are conserved in murine species. A MYND-less variant of BS69 has also been described (GenBank™ accession number NM212479). Using appropriate primers, we confirmed that the RNA encoding for such a variant exits and results from the alternative usage of the exon XIII splice donor. Cloning of an isoform lacking both the PHD and MYND domains further indicated that the alternative splicing of exon III and XIII are independent. In primary fibroblasts and in all cell lines tested, the PHD- and MYND-less variants are largely under-represented (Fig. 1C and data not shown). The full-length BS69 is therefore the main BS69 isoform expressed. Moreover, we failed to amplify any BRAM1 cDNA, a product previously described as an additional BS69 splice variant (18Kurozumi K. Nishita M. Yamaguchi K. Fujita T. Ueno N. Shibuya H. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). BS69 Is Subject to the Ubiquitin Proteasome Degradation Pathway—The additional BS69 N-terminal sequences prompted us to re-examine the properties of the protein. We first estimated the half-life of the full-length protein using pulse-chase experiments. In HeLa and 293T cells, its half-life was found to be restricted to 3 h but could be further extended after treatment of cells with MG132, a drug commonly used as a proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 2A and data not shown). To confirm that BS69 is subject to degradation through the proteasome pathway, we utilized epoxomicin, one of a novel generation of drugs known to strictly target the proteasome (19Meng L. Mohan R.

We found that both MG132 and epoxomicin similarly led to the accumulation of endogenous or ectopically expressed proteins (Fig. 2B). We then tested whether BS69 undergoes ubiquitylation. 293T cells were transiently co-transfected with full-length BS69 and HA-tagged ubiquitin expression vectors. When BS69 proteins were immunoprecipitated and blotted with an anti-HA antibody, a typical ladder of ubiquitylated proteins was detected, in a HA-ubiquitin dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). Similar results were obtained with the endogenous full-length BS69 protein (Fig. 2C). These experiments were next repeated with the other splice variants, all of which were found to accumulate in the presence of proteasome inhibitors and be subject to ubiquitylation (Fig. 2, D and E). We therefore concluded that the stability of all four BS69 splice variants is similarly regulated. To identify the residues that control protein stability, truncated BS69 peptides were generated and transiently transfected in fibroblasts, either left untreated or treated with MG132. As for the full-length protein, a peptide encompassing the N-terminal half of the protein was found to be unstable unless expressed in the presence of MG132. Inversely, deletion of these same N-terminal sequences was sufficient to generate a stable peptide. Furthermore, the fusion of the same sequences to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain, or to the GFP protein, provided instability (Fig. 2F and data not shown). Thus, we concluded that the N-terminal half of the BS69 protein regulates protein stability and that these properties are transferable. As a control, the fusion of the C-terminal peptide to the same proteins did not affect their stability (Fig. 2F). We failed to further map by deletion analysis the BS69 sequences implied in protein stability, suggesting potentially that multiple lysine residues distributed along the N terminus are ubiquitylated. BS69 Proteins Recruit Chromatin-remodeling Factors—To gain an insight into BS69 functions we examined the sublocalization of the endogenous BS69 protein by immunofluorescence. A homogenous nuclear staining, the specificity of which was confirmed by RNA interference, was observed in HeLa and 293T cells (Fig. 3A). A similar staining was observed with transient transfection of the various BS69 isoforms (Fig. 3B). We further investigated BS69 localization in a cell fractionation assay. The endogenous protein, as well as each of the ectopically expressed BS69 isoforms, was strictly found to associate with the insoluble chromatin-nuclear matrix fraction. The prior treatment of nuclei with micrococcus nuclease completely solubilized all isoforms. Thus, we concluded that BS69 proteins specifically associated with chromatin and not the nuclear matrix (Fig. 3C). We next analyzed whether BS69 associates with mitotic chromosome. A full-length BS69-GFP fusion protein (FL-GFP) was generated and transiently transfected in 293T and HeLa cells. Whereas the protein was uniformly spread through the nucleoplasm in interphase cells, it was found to associate with condensed chromosomes during mitosis. In comparison, a GFP fusion protein encompassing the N-terminal two-thirds of the protein (residues 1–426, Nt-GFP) still displayed a nuclear localization but failed to associate with chromosomes, suggesting that the C-terminal sequences might be important for targeting BS69 to condensed chromatin (Fig. 3D and data not shown). The above observations prompted us to examine whether BS69 interacts with chromatin-associated factors and to evaluate the contribution of the C terminus. We first examined the ability of a FLAG-tagged BS69 C-terminal peptide (BS69Δ431) to immunoprecipitate chromatin remodeling proteins when transiently transfected in HeLa cells. Of the proteins tested, we found that BS69 interacted with the ATP-dependent helicase BRG1, but not with BAF-155 and BAF-170, which are other components of the Swi-Snf complex (20Wang W. Cote J. Xue Y. Zhou S. Khavari P.A. Biggar S.R. Muchardt C. Kalpana G.V. Goff S.P. Yaniv M. Workman J.L. Crabtree G.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5370-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). We then attempted to confirm in transient transfection the BS69-BRG1 interaction and also searched for additional potential cofactors. BS69 was confirmed to specifically immunoprecipitate the BRG1-related protein brahma (21Chiba H. Muramatsu M. Nomoto A. Kato H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1815-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) but also the histone deacetylase HDAC1 (for review, see Ref. 22Marks P.A. Miller T. Richon V.M. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2003; 3: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and the histone-methyltransferase EZH2 (23Muller J. Hart C.M. Francis N.J. Vargas M.L. Sengupta A. Wild B. Miller E.L.

Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2893-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4, A–C). Inversely, in similar condition, BS69 failed to interact with the histone acetyltransferase pCAF/p300 or the co-repressor proteins Groucho (data not shown). In addition, the BS69 C-terminal peptide was found to interact specifically with the transcription factor E2F6 (25Cartwright P. Muller H. Wagener C. Holm K. Helin K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) but not with other E2F members (Fig. 4D and supplemental Fig. S1). Binding of BS69 to all four of the BRG1, EZH2, HDAC1, and E2F6 partners was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation of the endogenous proteins (Fig. 4E). Finally, we showed that, among the novel identified cofactors, both E2F6 and EZH2 directly interact with the BS69 C-terminal sequences in GST pulldown assays (Fig. 4F). Binding to EZH2 is abrogated by a single point mutation in the double zinc finger structure of the MYND domain (mutation C523S, Fig. 4F) (2Ansieau S. Leutz A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4906-4910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), whereas the binding of E2F6 implied residues located upstream of the MYND domain (data not shown) suggesting the possibility of a BS69-E2F6-EZH2 ternary complex. We confirmed the ability of E2F6 to immunoprecipitate EZH1 and EZH2 in transient transfection assays (Fig. 4G). Interestingly, the BS69-related protein RACK7 was also found to interact with E2F6 and BRG1 indicating that a certain degree of functional overlap may exist for these two proteins (Fig. 4H).FIGURE 4BS69 interacts with chromatin remodeling factors. A–D, the BS69 C-terminal sequences interact with the novel identified partners. FLAG-BS69 C-terminal peptide (FLAG-Δ431, FLAG-Δ431m), HA-brahma (brm), Myc-HDAC1, Myc-EZH 1/2, and HA-E2F6 expression vectors were transfected in QT6 fibroblasts as indicated. BS69, HDAC1, or E2F6 proteins were immunoprecipitated using an α-FLAG M2 (α-F), an α-Myc A14 (α-M), or an α-HA (α-H) antibody as indicated. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and ectopic expression of the partner tested was examined by Western blotting (W-B).

We corrected the 5′-BS69 cDNA sequence and showed that BS69 is in fact a ubiquitous protein of 74 kDa (Fig. 1). The additional sequences identified are extremely well conserved during evolution, suggesting that their presence could have a significant impact on the analysis of BS69 functions. Importantly, despite the observed diversity in BS69 gene expression, with the characterization of four splice variants, we failed to detect any BRAM1 encoding cDNA. BRAM1 was reported to consist of five specific residues preceding the C-terminal third of the BS69 protein due to the usage of an internal ATG located in an alternatively spliced exon (18Kurozumi K. Nishita M. Yamaguchi K. Fujita T. Ueno N. Shibuya H. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, we determined that the proposed BRAM1-specific sequences perfectly map to the ansk1 cDNA and also to the location of the anks1 gene on human chromosome 6 (26Ballif B.A. Villen J. Beausoleil S.A. Schwartz D. Gygi S.P. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2004; 3: 1093-1101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). No corresponding sequences are present on chromosome 10 where the BS69 gene is located. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the BRAM1 cDNA is in fact a chimeric construct between anks1 and BS69 sequences that arose from a recombination event during the cDNA library construction. The functions of the PHD- and MYND-less BS69 splice variants described in this study remain to be defined. Because both structures act as protein-protein interaction surfaces (2Ansieau S. Leutz A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4906-4910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 27Bienz M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 35-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), the splice variants may either display specific functions or alternatively represent transdominant negative isoforms of BS69. In particular, with the knowledge that the MYND domain of BS69 is targeted by the two oncoviral proteins E1A and EBNA2, it is tempting to speculate that the expression of the MYND-less variants, or the neutralization of full-length BS69 by oncoviral proteins, may have similar consequences that contribute to some extend to the cell transformation process. Interestingly, a MYND-less splice variant of AML1-MTG8 has been recently described in leukemia, which was proposed to stimulate the oligomerization of the protein and potentially favor the malignant conversion of hematopoietic cells (28Kozu T. Fukuyama T. Yamami T. Akagi K. Kaneko Y. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2005; 43: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as described below, we have already established that there are important differences in the binding partners for the full-length versus the MYND-less variants of BS69. As for the shorter variants, the function of full-length BS69 is also poorly understood. Previously data regarding BS69 interacting partners has relied predominately on overexpression of tagged proteins due to the lack of a reliable BS69 antibody. We have succeeded in providing an antibody and specific small interfering RNA that should prove valuable for the analysis of BS69 expression and function. We found that all four BS69 isoforms were nuclear, specifically associated with chromatin, and subject to the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway (Figs. 2 and 3). Although the N-terminal half of the protein consists of a combination of motifs (PHD, bromo, and PWWP domains) generally found in gene regulators, deletion of the C-terminal third of the protein strongly impaired the association of BS69 with mitotic chromosomes, suggesting that these sequences also contribute to the interaction of BS69 with chromatin (Fig. 3). In keeping with this hypothesis, we identified four novel BS69 C terminus interacting partners by co-immunoprecipitation of the endogenous proteins, namely E2F6, BRG1, HDAC1, and EZH2 (Fig. 4E). The integrity of the MYND domain structure was found to be a prerequisite only for EZH2 binding, such that the BS69 MYND-less variants were still capable of binding E2F6, but not EZH2, in GST pull-down assays (Fig. 4F and data not shown). Although the binding of E2F6 and EZH2 to independent C-terminal sequences of BS69 and to each other (Fig. 4F) suggested a potential BS69-E2F6-EZH2 ternary complex, we cannot exclude that the binding of BS69 to both partners occurs in completely different contexts. Purification of the BS69-associated protein complexes should help to clarify this point. Our recent findings that the BS69-related protein RACK7 shares a number of common properties and an overlapping set of binding partners with BS69 (Fig. 4H)5 further suggests that the novel identified partners might be of importance for the functions of both proteins and contribute to their proposed roles in the regulation of gene repression.

Although skeletal muscle differentiation involves the fusion of single myoblast cells to multinucleated myotubes, cardiac muscle consists of single myocytes (16Liu C. Wang H. Zhao Z. Yu S. Lu Y.B.

BioEssays. 2000; 22: 188-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as noted earlier, the transcription factors involved in skeletal muscle differentiation differ from those functioning in cardiac muscle differentiation. Despite these differences, however, the common involvement of p204 in skeletal muscle and heart muscle differentiation prompted us to explore whether the mechanisms of p204 actions are similar in the two processes. As noted above, one of the functions of p204 in skeletal muscle differentiation is to overcome the inhibition of this process by the Id proteins. We tested whether the function of p204 in heart muscle differentiation can also be correlated with an involvement of Id proteins in the process. Here we report that proliferating P19 cells contained Id1, Id2, and Id3. By binding to the cardiac Gata4 and Nkx2.5 transcription factors, the Id proteins inhibited their synergistic activation of cardiac gene expression and thereby blocked the differentiation of P19 cells to beating cardiac myocytes. The various mechanisms of inhibition by the Id proteins and the various mechanisms by which p204 overcomes these inhibitions are the topics of this study.

MBP-Gata4, various MBP-Gata4 segments, and MBP-Nkx2.5 were constructed in the pMAL-2 vector system (New England Biolabs). Gata4, Nkx2.5, Id1, Id2, and Id3 were each inserted into a pGBKT7 yeast expression vector (Clontech) to generate PGBKT7-Gata4, etc. Expression plasmids encoding Id3, GFP-Id3, and FLAG-Id3 were constructed using the pcDNA3 vector, pEGFP-N1 vector, p3XFLAG-CMV7.1 vector, or p3XFLAG-CMV14 vector (Sigma), respectively. p3XFLAG-CMV7.1 linked the FLAG moieties to the N terminus of Id3 and p3XFLAG-CMV14 to the C terminus. pcDNA-E1 was generated from the human E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme expression plasmid pGEM-7ZF-E1 (25Handley P.M.

Human tsBN75 cells carrying a human thermosensitive E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme (a kind gift from C. Basilico) (28Nishimoto T. Takahashi T. Basilico C. Somatic Cell Genet. 1980; 6: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) were cultured in DMEM, 10% FCS at 33 °C. Coimmunoprecipitation—293 cells cultured in 35-mm dishes were cotransfected with pCGNGata4 (3 μg) or pCGNNkx2.5 (3 μg) as well as FLAG-Id1 (3 μg), FLAG-Id2 (3 μg), or FLAG-Id3 (3 μg) using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. Cells were harvested after incubation in DMEM, 10% FCS for 30 h and lysed in lysis buffer (29Hofmann T.G. Moller A. Sirma H. Zentgraf H. Taya Y. Droge W. Will H. Schmitz M.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). 500 μg of protein samples were immunoprecipitated by incubation with protein G beads and loaded with 10 μg of M2 monoclonal αFLAG (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. The proteins retained on the loaded beads were washed and eluted following a published procedure (29Hofmann T.G. Moller A. Sirma H. Zentgraf H. Taya Y. Droge W. Will H. Schmitz M.L. Nat.

Binding of Gata4 to the Id Proteins in Vitro and Binding of Purified MBP-Gata4 Protein to Purified GST-Id Proteins in Vitro—500 μg of MBP-Gata4 or as control 500 μg of GST were incubated with 20 μl of GST beads loaded with 500 μg of GST-Id1, GST-Id2, or GST-Id3, or as control GST in 300 μl of AM-100 buffer (17Liu C.J. Ding B. Wang H. Lengyel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2893-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) at 4 °C, overnight. The beads were washed and eluted in SDS buffer by boiling. The MBP-Gata4 or MBP proteins retained on the loaded GST beads were assayed by Western blotting using rabbit αMBP (New England Biolabs). GST Pulldown Assay for Id2 Domains and Gata4—500 μg of the indicated GST-Id2 segment or GST was loaded to 20 μl of GST beads and was incubated with 10 μl of 35S-Gata4 (translated in vitro) in the same conditions as above. The retained 35S-Gata4 was eluted and assayed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. MBP Pulldown Assay for Gata4 Segments and Id—Segments of Gata4 were fused to the C terminus of MBP. 500 μg of each of the fusion proteins were bound to amylose beads (New England Biolabs) and were incubated with 10-15 μlof 35S-labeled Id2 or-Id3 (translated in vitro)in AM-100 buffer at 4 °C overnight. Thereafter, the bound protein complexes were eluted and assayed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Reporter Gene Assay—10T1/2 cell cultures were grown and transfected in the conditions described above. The cultures were cotransfected using Lipofectamine 2000 with 0.5 μg of reporter construct, including the nucleotide -98 to +48 segment of the Ifi204 gene inserted into pGL3 vector (Promega) and 0.5 μg of pSVGal together with, if indicated, 1 μg of pCGNGata4, 1 μg of pCGNNkx2.5, 2 μg of pcDNA3-Id1, 2 μg of pcDNA3-Id2, 2 μg of pcDNA3-Id3, and 3 μg of pCMV204. BLK cells were cotransfected using the calcium phosphate-based mammalian transfection kit (Stratagene) with 1 μg of a reporter construct in which the ANF gene segment (nucleotide -135 to +1) was inserted into the pGL3 vector, 1 μg of pSVGal, and if indicated 2 μg of pCGNGata4 and/or 2 μg of pCGNNkx2.5, 4 μg of pCMV204, and 2, 4, or 6 μg of pCMV-Id3. Biotinylated Oligodeoxynucleotide Precipitation Assay—The same procedure for transfection as described above was used in 10T1/2 cells in 6-well plates. If so indicated, 2 μg per well of pCMV-FLAGId1, pCMV-FLAGId2 or pCMV-FLAGId3 without or with 0.5 μg per well of pCGNGata4 or pCGNNkx2.5 was cotransfected using Lipofectamine 2000. The total amount of DNA transfected was adjusted to 6.5 μg per well by adding vector DNA. The cultures were incubated in serum-free DMEM for 12 h and in DMEM 10% FCS for a further 18 h. The cells were lysed in HKMG buffer (30Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J.

DNA-bound protein was pulled down by incubation with streptavidin-agarose beads (Novagen) at 4 °C for 1 h. The proteins were eluted with boiling SDS loading buffer, and the Gata4 and Nkx2.5 recovered were assayed by Western blotting. For further details see Ref. 30Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E.

Assay of the Acceleration of the Degradation of Id3 by p204 in Vivo—BLK cells were plated on 10-cm tissue culture dishes. After a 24-h incubation, they were transfected using 2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 per μgof DNA with 10 μg of pCMV-Id3-FLAG (encoding Id3 fused at its C terminus to three FLAG moieties), as indicated without or with 10 μgof pCMV204 or 10 μg of pCMV204ΔNES. 24 h later the cultures were digested with trypsin/EDTA, pooled, replated into 6-cm tissue culture dishes, and incubated for 24 h. At this time, 100 μg/ml CHX was added and, if so indicated, together with 20 μm MG132. After the indicated times of incubation, the various cultures were lysed in TBS buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). The lysates were analyzed for Id3-FLAG by Western blotting with M2-FLAG antibodies (Sigma). The bands were assayed using ImageQuant™ 5.2 software, and the data were plotted using the SigmaPlot graphing program. Assay of the Ubiquitin E1-activating Enzyme-dependent Acceleration of Id3 Degradation by p204 in Vivo—tsBN75 cells (28Nishimoto T. Takahashi T. Basilico C. Somatic Cell Genet. 1980; 6: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) carrying a thermosensitive E1 enzyme were cultured in 10-cm dishes in 5% CO2 at 34 °C and were transfected using 2 μl of Lipofectamine per μg of DNA with 8 μg of pCMV-Id3FLAG (in which three FLAG moieties were fused to the C terminus of Id3), and, as indicated, without or with 8 μg of pCMV204 and without or with 8 μg of pCMV-E1. After 24 h, the cultures were digested, pooled, and replated in 6-cm dishes and incubated at 40 °C for 24 h. The cultures were then supplemented with 100 μg/ml CHX and 20 μm MG132, harvested at the various times indicated, and lysed. The lysates were analyzed for Id3-FLAG as described above. Assay of the Increase in the Ubiquitination of Ectopic Id3 by Ectopic p204 in tsBN75 Cells—The mammalian expression plasmids based on the pCMV vector and encoding the proteins specified in Fig. 7 were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 into tsBN75 cells. The plasmids used and the amounts of the plasmids transfected were as follows: pCMV-HA-Ub (2 μg, cultures 1-5), p3XFLAG-CMV14-Id3 (2 μg, cultures 1-4), pCMV204 ((2 or 6 μg, cultures 1 and 2, respectively), pCMV vector (2 μg, culture 3, and 6 μg, cultures 4 and 5). After incubation in 5% CO2 for 36 h, 20 μm MG132 was added, and the cultures were incubated for 5 h. After washing the cells, they were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm NaF) supplemented with 100 μm N-ethylmaleimide and 10 μm ubiquitinaldehyde (Sigma), on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged thereafter at 4 °C and 14,000 × g for 15 min. 500-μl aliquots (500 μg of protein) from the supernatant fractions were precleared with protein G beads (Invitrogen) for 30 min, and the residual solutions were incubated with protein G beads conjugated with mouse anti-FLAG antibodies (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. After washing the beads four times with the supplemented RIPA buffer, they were boiled in SDS loading buffer for 10 min. 30-μl samples were analyzed by Western blotting using 4-15% SDS-PAGE and HA antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (12CA5; Roche Applied Science). Ectopic Id3 Inhibited the Differentiation of P19 Cells to Myocytes as Induced by DMSO; Ectopic p204 Overcame This Inhibition—As noted, the Id proteins inhibited skeletal muscle differentiation by binding the myogenic bHLH transcription factors and blocking their binding to DNA (18Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar, 19Jen Y. Weintraub H. Benezra R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1466-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). We reported earlier that p204 can overcome this inhibition by the Id proteins (17Liu C.J. Ding B. Wang H. Lengyel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2893-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The fact that the level of p204 is even higher in mouse heart than in skeletal muscle (16Liu C. Wang H. Zhao Z. Yu S. Lu Y.B. Meyer J. Chatterjee G. Deschamps S. Roe B.A. Lengyel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7024-7036Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) prompted us to explore whether the Id proteins also affect the differentiation of P19 cells to cardiac-type myocytes. Fig. 1 reveals the following: (i) ectopic Id3 inhibited a characteristic of the differentiation to myocytes, i.e. the accumulation of MHC which is a component of the contractile machinery in myocytes induced in P19 cells by DMSO (Fig. 1, cf. e and k); and (ii) ectopic p204 overcame this inhibition (Fig. 1, cf. h and e). Ectopic p204 also strongly decreased the accumulation of ectopic Id3 (Fig. 1, cf. d and g). As expected ectopic Id3 (tested in the absence of DMSO treatment) did not induce MHC (Fig. 1b). Findings (i) and (ii) prompted us to examine whether the expressions and/or the activities of the Gata4 and the Nkx2.5 transcription factors (31Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38949-38952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 32Skerjanc I.S. Petropoulos H. Ridgeway A.G. Wilton S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34904-34910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) are affected by the Id proteins and/or p204. Gata4 and Nkx2.5 are the earliest markers of precardiac cells in the course of cardiac differentiation (for a review see Ref. 33Nemer G. Nemer M. Ann. Med. 2001; 33: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Ectopic Id3 Inhibited the Expression of the Gata4, Nkx2.5, and MHC Proteins in P19 Cultures Induced to Differentiate to Myocytes by DMSO—The Western blots in Fig. 2 compare the kinetics of expression of Gata4, Nkx2.5, MHC, and (endogenous) Id3 proteins in control P19 cells induced to differentiate by DMSO (left panel) and the effect of ectopic Id3 on these kinetics (right panel). In the control culture Gata4 was detected on day 4 and its level increased by day 6. Both Nkx2.5 and MHC became detectable only on day 6. The low level of endogenous Id3 in proliferating P19 cells (day 0) slightly increased by day 2, but thereafter, in the presence of DMSO, it strongly decreased by day 4 and much further by day 6. The presence of ectopic Id3 slightly decreased the levels of Gata4 on days 4 and 6, strongly diminished the level of Nkx2.5 on day 6, and decreased the level of MHC on day 6 to a barely detectable level (Fig. 2, right panel). The apparent correlations of the decrease in the levels of MHC and Nkx2.5 with that of Gata4 are in accord with the findings that Gata4 lies upstream of Nkx2.5 in the regulatory cascade of cardiogenesis (34Brewer A.C. Alexandrovich A. Mjaatvedt C.H. Shah A.M. Patient R.K. Pizzey J.A. Stem Cells Dev. 2005; 14: 425-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and that Gata4 is among the transcription factors involved in the transcription of α- and βMHC (35Charron F. Nemer M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). It is also relevant that Gata4 and Nkx2.5 are mutual cofactors cross-regulating each other's expression (36Molkentin J.D. Antos C. Mercer B. Taigen T. Miano J.M. Olson E.N. Dev. Biol. 2000; 217: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The decrease in the levels of expression of Gata4, Nkx2.5, and MHC proteins in the presence of ectopic Id3 prompted us to explore the following: (i) whether Id proteins bind Gata4 and/or Nkx2.5, and if so (ii) whether the Id proteins inhibit the transcriptional activities of Gata4 and Nkx2.5. Interaction of the Id Proteins with Gata4 and Nkx2.5—The Western blots in Fig. 3A show a coimmunoprecipitation by αFLAG of ectopic FLAG-tagged Id1, Id2, or Id3 with ectopic Gata4 (Fig. 3A, panel (a)) and Nkx2.5 (Fig. 3A, panel (b)) from lysates of 293 cells. As negative controls, we established that rabbit IgG did not precipitate Gata4 or Nkx2.5 without or in the presence of FLAG-Id2. These findings indicated the interaction of Gata4 as well as Nkx2.5 with each of the three Id proteins in vivo. The GST pulldown assays in Fig. 3B revealed the binding of purified Id proteins (actually GST-Id1, GST-Id2, and GST-Id3) to purified Gata4 (actually MBP-Gata4) in vitro. As a negative control we established that the GST-Id proteins did not bind MBP, and GST did not bind MBP-Gata4. The schematic structure of GST-Id2 with the locations of the N-terminal, HLH, and C-terminal domains of Id2 is shown in Fig. 3C, panel (b). The autoradiograph (Fig. 3C, panel (a)) revealed that 35S-Gata4 could bind to both the HLH domain and the C-terminal domain of Id2. Thus Gata4, a zinc finger protein (31Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38949-38952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar), differs in its mode of binding to Id2 from the bHLH proteins, e.g. MyoD. The latter bind primarily or only to the HLH domain of the Id proteins (17Liu C.J. Ding B. Wang H. Lengyel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2893-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The schematic domain structure of Gata4 is shown in the Fig. 3D, panel (b) top. The autoradiographs revealing the interactions of various segments of Gata4 with Id2 and Id3 in a pulldown assay are shown in Fig. 3D, panel (a), and the interpretation of the relative strengths of the interactions with the segments is indicated in lines 1-13 of Fig. 3D, panel (b). The results reveal some difference among the domains in Gata4 that bind to Id2 and Id3. Both segments of the N domain, i.e. 1-80 and 80-215, were needed for strong binding to Id2. The segment 241-269 also bound Id2 but more weakly, at least if linked to more upstream or more downstream segments. The second segment of the N domain, i.e. 80-215, was the primary site of binding to Id3. It should be kept in mind that these binding results may not perfectly reflect the domains that bind to the Id proteins in complete Gata4. This is the case because the folding of isolated domains might be different from their folding when present in the complete protein.

https://openalex.org/W2032766367,"We have characterized a novel mRNA-binding protein, designated hrp84, in the dipteran Chironomus tentans and identified it as a DEAD-box RNA helicase. The protein contains the typical helicase core domain, a glycine-rich C-terminal part and a putative nuclear export signal in the N terminus. The protein belongs to the Ded1 subgroup of DEAD-box helicases, which is highly conserved from yeast (Ded1p) to mammals (DDX3). In tissue culture cells, hrp84 is present both in the nucleus and cytoplasm and, as shown by in vivo UV cross-linking, is bound to mRNA in both compartments. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that hpr84 is associated with the C. tentans homologue (ctYB-1) of the vertebrate Y-box protein YB-1 both in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and the two proteins also appear together in polysomes. The interaction is likely to be direct as shown by in vitro binding of purified components. We conclude that the mRNA-bound hrp84·ctYB-1 complex is formed in the nucleus and is translocated with mRNA into the cytoplasm and further into polysomes. As both Ded1 and YB-1 are known to regulate the initiation of translation, we propose that the RNA helicase-Y-box protein complex affects the efficiency of mRNA translation, presumably by modulating the conformation of the mRNP template.

RNA helicases of the DEAD-box 5The abbreviations used are: DEAD-box, protein with Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp motif; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; eIF, eukaryotic translation initiation factors; hnRNP, heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoproteins. family and related families (collectively known as DEXD/H proteins) are involved in many different processes concerning RNA metabolism such as RNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis, RNA transport, translation, and RNA turnover, and they are found in all eukaryotes and most prokaryotes (1de la Cruz J. Kressler D. Linder P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 192-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 2Silverman E. Edwalds-Gilbert G. Lin R.J.

RNA helicases are enzymes that unwind double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules in an energy-dependent fashion by hydrolysis of NTP, preferentially ATP. The DEAD-box proteins have a highly conserved helicase core domain, which consists of nine motifs (4Cordin O. Banroques J. Tanner N.K. Linder P. Gene (Amst.). 2006; 367: 17-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). These motifs are involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis, RNA binding, and helicase activity. The core element is usually flanked by divergent N- and C-terminal sequences that are responsible for substrate specificity and/or direct the protein to a specific subcellular location (1de la Cruz J. Kressler D. Linder P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 192-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 2Silverman E. Edwalds-Gilbert G. Lin R.J. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 312: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 5Wang Y. Guthrie C. RNA. 1998; 4: 1216-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Today, over 500 different DEAD-box protein sequences are present in protein databases (3Rocak S. Linder P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 232-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Despite extensive studies, the precise mechanism of action of the DEAD-box proteins is still unclear. In contrast to DNA helicases and DEXH proteins, which are capable of unwinding long stretches of dsDNA/RNA, many DEAD-box proteins are rather poor helicases and seem to disrupt only short RNA duplexes (4Cordin O. Banroques J. Tanner N.K. Linder P. Gene (Amst.). 2006; 367: 17-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 6Staley J.P. Guthrie C. Cell. 1998; 92: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Hence, they are often called RNA unwindases to distinguish them from traditional helicases. Besides their ability to melt regions of dsRNA, DEXD/H proteins can displace protein from RNA or rearrange protein-protein or RNA-protein interactions within an RNA protein complex; these effects are referred to as “RNPase” activity (6Staley J.P. Guthrie C. Cell. 1998; 92: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar, 7Lorsch J.R. Herschlag D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2194-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 8Jankowsky E. Gross C.H. Shuman S. Pyle A.M.

Interestingly, this can happen independently of the ability of RNA helicases to unwind dsRNA (10Fairman M.E. Maroney P.A. Wang W. Bowers H.A. Gollnick P. Nilsen T.W. Jankowsky E. Science. 2004; 304: 730-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In vivo most DEAD-box proteins bind with high specificity to RNA-protein complexes (11Tanner N.K. Linder P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 251-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar), but in vitro they show little RNA sequence specificity (4Cordin O. Banroques J. Tanner N.K. Linder P. Gene (Amst.). 2006; 367: 17-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Moreover, structural and biochemical studies of the related DEXH-box proteins have revealed that RNA helicases bind to the ribose phosphate backbone of RNA rather than to specific nucleotide bases (12Kim J.L. Morgenstern K.A. Griffith J.P. Dwyer M.D. Thomson J.A. Murcko M.A. Lin C. Caron P.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 89-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 13Kawaoka J. Jankowsky E. Pyle A.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 526-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems likely that RNA helicases recognize not only the RNA but rather the RNA-protein complex as such. In addition, protein cofactors can interact with RNA helicases to promote target recognition and helicase activity (2Silverman E. Edwalds-Gilbert G. Lin R.J. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 312: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). RNA helicases often function within very large RNA-protein assemblies, such as ribosomes and spliceosomes, and can interact with protein factors that recruit the helicases to the appropriate assembly and/or modulate the activity (2Silverman E. Edwalds-Gilbert G. Lin R.J. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 312: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 3Rocak S. Linder P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 232-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Clearly, to fully understand the activity and function of DEAD-box helicases, specific interacting proteins have to be identified and characterized. Translation provides striking examples of cooperation between RNA helicases and single-stranded RNA-binding proteins (for discussion, see Ref. 14Sommerville J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). One example is the RNA helicase CsdA involved in the cold shock response in Escherichia coli (15Jones P.G. Mitta M. Kim Y. Jiang W. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Here the helicase unwinds secondary structures in mRNA, whereas the single-stranded-binding protein CspA keeps the RNA in a single-stranded conformation, which results in efficient translation of the mRNA (16Jiang W. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 196-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Another example is the interplay in mammalian cells between the eukaryotic translation initiation factors eIF4A and eIF4B. eIF4A is an RNA helicase that unwinds secondary structures in the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of the mRNA, which enables the small ribosomal subunit to bind to the cap region of the mRNA and scan along the RNA to reach the start codon AUG (17Svitkin Y.V. Pause A. Haghighat A. Pyronnet S. Witherell G. Belsham G.J. Sonenberg N. RNA. 2001; 7: 382-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). However, eIF4A on its own is a weak helicase and needs an RNA-binding cofactor, eIF4B, to work efficiently (18Rozen F. Edery I. Meerovitch K. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 19Rogers Jr., G.W. Richter N.J. Lima W.F. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30914-30922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). eIF4B binds to RNA and promotes recruitment of the eIF4A-containing complex. It is possible that the eIF4A·eIF4B complex both unwinds the 5′-UTR and maintains the RNA in a single-stranded conformation to allow binding and scanning of the small ribosomal subunit. It has also been proposed that RNA helicases cooperate with Y-box proteins to suppress translation during oogenesis in amphibians (14Sommerville J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and in Drosophila (20Nakamura A. Amikura R. Hanyu K. Kobayashi S. Development. 2001; 128: 3233-3242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Y-box proteins are abundant RNA-binding proteins, which act as molecular chaperones and have been implicated in transcriptional and translational control (21Wolffe A.P. Tafuri S. Ranjan M. Familari M. New Biol. 1992; 4: 290-298PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sommerville J. Ladomery M. Faseb J. 1996; 10: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In amphibians, the silent mRNAs are stored in mRNP particles (23Darnbrough C.H. Ford P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 113: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), which contain the Y-box protein FRGY2 (24Tafuri S.R. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9028-9032Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 25Deschamps S. Viel A. Garrigos M. Denis H. le Maire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13799-13802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and an oocyte-specific DEAD-box RNA helicase, Xp54 (26Ladomery M. Wade E. Sommerville J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). FRGY2 is known to suppress translation (27Sommerville J. Ladomery M. Chromosoma. 1996; 104: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 28Matsumoto K. Meric F. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22706-22712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and Xp54 to modify translation (29Minshall N. Standart N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1325-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). During oogenesis in Drosophila, silent mRNPs are transported from nurse cells to the oocyte and further to specific locations within the oocyte. The mRNP particles in transit contain the Y-box protein Yps (Ypsilon Schachtel) (30Wilhelm J.E. Mansfield J. Hom-Booher N. Wang S. Turck C.W. Hazelrigg T. Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 427-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), which is similar to the mammalian YB-1, and an RNA helicase, Me31B (20Nakamura A. Amikura R. Hanyu K. Kobayashi S. Development. 2001; 128: 3233-3242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is homologous to Xp54 in Xenopus. It has been shown that the helicase is required to keep the mRNA repressed (20Nakamura A. Amikura R. Hanyu K. Kobayashi S. Development. 2001; 128: 3233-3242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the Y-box protein affects the localization and translation of mRNA (31Mansfield J.H. Wilhelm J.E. Hazelrigg T. Development. 2002; 129: 197-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the information is still limited in both Xenopus and Drosophila, it is close at hand to suggest that the RNA helicase promotes the binding of the Y-box protein to the mRNA and in this way blocks translation. There is, however, no evidence for a direct interaction between the two proteins, and further work is needed to elucidate the proposed molecular interplay between the two proteins. Y-box proteins are present in mRNP particles not only in germ cells but also in somatic cells (32Evdokimova V.M. Wei C.L. Sitikov A.S. Simonenko P.N. Lazarev O.A. Vasilenko K.S. Ustinov V.A. Hershey J.W. Ovchinnikov L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3186-3192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). As they are involved in translational control in e.g. rabbit reticulocytes (33Evdokimova V.M. Ovchinnikov L.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), it is an interesting possibility that the Y-box proteins function in cooperation with an RNA helicase in somatic cells just as proposed to be the case for germ cells. For several years we have studied the structure, assembly, and transport of messenger RNP particles in the salivary glands of the dipteran Chironomus tentans (34Daneholt B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7012-7017Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The main advantage with this experimental system is that the gene expression process can be visualized in the electron microscope and followed from the generation of messenger RNP (mRNP) on the gene, via the transport of the mRNP to and through the nuclear pores, to the incorporation of the mRNP into the protein-synthesizing polysomes in cytoplasm. The behavior of several RNA-binding proteins has been characterized in this system (for review, see Ref. 34Daneholt B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7012-7017Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Recently, a C. tentans homologue (Ct-p40/50) of the mammalian Y-box protein YB-1 was studied, and it was shown that this Y-box protein is added to the mRNA co-transcriptionally and accompanies mRNA from the genes in the nucleus all the way into polysomes in the cytoplasm (35Soop T. Nashchekin D. Zhao J. Sun X. Alzhanova-Ericsson A.T. Bjorkroth B. Ovchinnikov L. Daneholt B. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1493-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have identified a novel RNA helicase in C. tentans, which belongs to the Ded1 subfamily of DEAD-box helicases, known to be involved in translation initiation (see “Discussion”). The novel helicase has a molecular mass of 84 kDa and is designated Ct-hrp84, or hrp84 for short. We have farther investigated whether hrp84 is associated with the YB-1 homologue in C. tentans (here called ctYB-1). The hrp84 protein is bound to mRNA in the nucleus and cytoplasm of epithelial cells grown in culture. It is associated with ctYB-1 in both compartments, and the two proteins also appear together in polysomes. In vitro experiments with purified proteins suggested that the interaction between the two proteins is direct. Thus, the mRNA-bound complex between hrp84 and ctYB-1 is formed in the nucleus and seem to accompany the mRNA to cytoplasm and presumably exerts its function in polysomes during the translation of the mRNA. We discuss the putative cooperation between RNA helicases and YB-1 in somatic cells and compare this to the silencing action of similar components in oocytes. Tissue Culture Cells—C. tentans tissue culture cells were cultivated at 24 °C as previously described (36Wyss C. Exp. Cell Res. 1982; 139: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Generation of Monoclonal Antibody 4E11—A mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4E11 was obtained as previously described by Sun et al. (37Sun X. Alzhanova-Ericsson A.T. Visa N. Aissouni Y. Zhao J. Daneholt B. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1181-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, hnRNP complexes were immunoprecipitated from a C. tentans nuclear RNP extract by mAb 4F9 against hnRNP protein hrp36 and used as antigen for mouse immunization. Positive clones were identified by screening hybridoma supernatants for binding to proteins in the nuclear RNP extract in Western blot analysis. The mAb 4E11, which recognized an 84-kDa protein, was chosen for further analysis. Cell Fractionation, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis— To obtain nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts, tissue culture cells were washed twice in cold PBS, resuspended in cold PBS containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), homogenized, and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant constituted the cytoplasmic extract. The pellet, which contained the nuclei, was washed once in PBS with PMSF, resuspended in PBS with PMSF, sonicated, and centrifuged at 14,000 g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was retained as the nuclear extract. For RNase treatment of extracts, RNase A (Roche Applied Science) was added at 1 mg/ml and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. For immunoprecipitation, nuclear, and cytoplasmic extracts were incubated with mAb 4E11 for 3h at 4 °C and then with rat anti-mouse IgM-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 1 h at 4°C. The beads were washed with PBS containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.3% sodium deoxycholate. The proteins were eluted with sample buffer (10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8). For Western blot analysis, the protein samples were boiled in the sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE in 10% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins were blotted onto transfer membranes (immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride, Millipore) in a Trans-Blot semi-dry electrophoretic transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked for 1 h in PBS containing 10% dry milk powder and incubated for 1 h with the first antibody diluted in PBS containing 1% nonfat dry milk and 0.05% Tween 20. The antibodies were used in the following dilutions: mAb 4E11 (anti-hrp84) and 2E4 (anti hrp45) 1:10, polyclonal anti-hrp84 and monoclonal anti-tubulin (Sigma) 1:1,000, and polyclonal anti-ctYb-1 1:10,000. The membranes were washed in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) three times for 5 min and incubated with the proper peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (DAKO) for another hour. After washing, the position of the antibodies was detected by the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). cDNA Cloning—A randomly primed λgt11 cDNA library from salivary glands of C. tentans was screened with mAb 4E11 (1:100 dilution) using an anti-mouse immunoglobulin conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.) and the NBT/BCIP detection system. One of the antibody-specific clones was purified, and the 1.8-kb insert was sequenced and used as template for PCR amplification with λgt11 forward and reverse primers (Promega Biotech). The amplified DNA fragment was purified by MicroSpin™ S-400 HR columns (Amersham Biosciences) and labeled by the DIG DNA Labeling and Detection kit (Roche Applied Sciences). The labeled DNA probe was used to screen an oligo dT-primed λZAP cDNA library from the salivary glands of C. tentans following the manufacturer's instructions. Tens of positive clones were detected, and several of them were purified. The inserted cDNAs were PCR-amplified by T3 and T7 primers and purified as described above to determine the size of inserted cDNAs. DNA Sequencing and Sequence Analysis—The amplified DNA fragments were used for sequencing with walking oligonucleotide primers. The DNA Sequencing kit (Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing) (Applied Biosystems) was applied for DNA sequencing reaction, and the sequencing gel was run on a 373A Automated DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The DNA sequences were analyzed with the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (GCG) Sequence Analysis Programs and EGCG extensions to the Wisconsin Package Sequence Analysis programs. Expression, Purification, and 35S Labeling of Recombinant Proteins— PCR was used to introduce an NdeI site at the 5′-end and a BamHI site at the 3′-end of the hrp84 coding sequence. The amplified cDNA was subcloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the pET15b vector (Novagen, Inc.) in-frame with the coding sequence for a His tag in the N terminus. ctYb-1 (p40) cDNA was cloned into the NcoI-EcoRI sites of the pET30a vector (Novagen) in-frame with the coding sequence for an S-tag in the N terminus. The S-tag corresponds to the S-peptide in the S-peptide/S-protein high affinity system. The E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS strain was used for protein expression. The protein production was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 2 h at 37 °C. The recombinant hrp84 was purified with a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) under denaturing and nondenaturing conditions, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The recombinant p40 was purified with S-protein agarose (Novagen) following the instructions of the manufacturer. For generation of 35S-labeled proteins, the in vitro transcription/translation-coupled reticulocyte lysate system from Promega was used. In vitro translated proteins were affinity-purified by Talon metal affinity resin (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. ATPase Assay—Purified hrp84 (0.3 μg) was added to a 5-μl reaction mixture containing PBS, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 μg RNA, 0.1 mm cold ATP, and 0.1 μl of [α-32P]ATP. After incubation for 1 h at 37°C,1 μl of stop solution (1 mg/ml proteinase K, 1% SDS, 0.1 mm EDTA) was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated for an additional 20 min at 37 °C. Samples of 2 μl were spotted on a PEI cellulose plate and developed in 0.6 m potassium phosphate (pH 3.4). Immunocytology of Tissue Culture Cells—C. tentans tissue culture cells were centrifuged (Cytospin, Shandon Astmoor, Runcorn, UK) onto glass slides. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After washing in PBS, the cells were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min and washed again in PBS. The cells were blocked with 1% milk in PBS for 10 min and incubated with the first antibody for 1-2 h and rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody for another hour. Confocal images were taken from 1-μm optical sections with LSM 510 (Zeiss). Protein-RNA UV Cross-linking—The cross-linking was performed as earlier described (35Soop T. Nashchekin D. Zhao J. Sun X. Alzhanova-Ericsson A.T. Bjorkroth B. Ovchinnikov L. Daneholt B. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1493-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Tissue culture cells from 500 ml of medium were centrifuged and suspended in 5 ml of PBS. The cell suspension was irradiated under ultraviolet (UV) light (Stratalinker, Stratagene) to induce covalent protein-RNA cross-links in vivo. The UV light dose was ∼0.3 J/cm2. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared, heated at 65 °C in the presence of 0.5% SDS and 1% mercaptoethanol and incubated with oligo(dT) cellulose (Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of 500 mm LiCl. After washing with buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% SDS), the bound material of each sample was eluted with buffer A devoid of LiCl. The eluted fractions were incubated with RNase A (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 60 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Polyribosome Analysis—Tissue culture cells in 3 ml of medium were exposed to 50 μg/ml cycloheximide for 10 min, washed twice with cold PBS, resuspended in 150 μl of TKM buffer (10 mm triethanolamine-HCl at pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2) and homogenized in a glass tissue grinder. Both PBS and TKM contained 50 μg/ml cycloheximide. The homogenate was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min at 2 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a gradient of 15% to 40% (w/v) sucrose in TKM, and sedimented for 60 min at 2 °C at 40,000 rpm in an Ah 650 rotor. The gradient was collected in 15 fractions with concomitant measurement of the absorbance at 254 nm. The proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and submitted to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis as described above. Protein-Protein Interaction Assay—1 μg of S-tagged ctYB-1 immobilized on 10 μl of S-protein-agarose beads was used for each binding reaction. After pre-equilibration in a binding and washing (BW) buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton), the ctYB-1 beads were incubated with 35S-labeled proteins for 1 h at 4 °C under continuous mixing. The beads were washed five times with 200 μl of BW buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography. The Monoclonal Antibody 4E11 Recognizes an 84-kDa Protein—To identify and characterize proteins in nuclear mRNP particles (hnRNP proteins), we raised a series of monoclonal antibodies against hnRNP proteins immunoprecipitated from a C. tentans nuclear RNP extract from tissue culture cells (37Sun X. Alzhanova-Ericsson A.T. Visa N. Aissouni Y. Zhao J. Daneholt B. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1181-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). One of the monoclonal antibodies, designated mAb 4E11, specifically recognized an 84-kDa protein in the RNP extract from tissue culture cells as shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A). In the present study, this antibody was used to identify and characterize the corresponding protein by cDNA cloning and to reveal interacting proteins using tissue culture cells. According to the C. tentans nomenclature established for hnRNP proteins, the 84-kDa protein recognized by mAb 4E11 was designated Ct-hrp84, or hrp84 for short. Cloning and Sequencing of cDNA Clones Encoding hrp84—Using the mAb 4E11, we screened a randomly primedλgt11 cDNA expression library made from salivary glands of C. tentans. An antibody-specific clone containing a 1.8-kb insert was sequenced. To get the full-length cDNA, the insert from this clone was amplified by PCR and used to screen an oligo(dT)-primed λZAP cDNA library made from salivary glands. Nine positive clones were found with inserts ranging from 2.1 to 2.8 kb. Sequence analysis of the longest cDNA insert (2.8 kb) showed that the insert contained an open reading frame of 2331 bp with an initiation codon ATG at nucleotides 250-252 and a stop codon TAA at nucleotides 2578-2580, as well as a 3′-non-translated region of 285 nucleotides (accession number DQ 139795). The open reading frame encodes a polypeptide of 776 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 86.136 kDa (Fig. 2A). To demonstrate that the isolated cDNA encodes the hrp84 protein, the recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli. A protein corresponding to hrp84 appeared in Coomassie-stained gels (Fig. 1B, lane 2 versus lane 1). It was shown by Western blot analysis that the expressed protein was recognized by 4E11 and migrated in the gel as hrp84 extracted from C. tentans cells (Fig. 1B, lane 5 versus lane 4). Finally, we purified the recombinant protein (lane 3) and raised a polyclonal antibody. The affinity-purified antibody bound specifically to hrp84 when a nuclear extract from tissue culture cells was studied by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B, lane 8; cf blot with mAb4E11 in lane 7). Thus, the protein encoded in the cloned cDNA represents full-length hrp84. hrp84 Is a New Member of the Ded1 Subfamily of DEAD-box RNA Helicases—Data base searches revealed that the hrp84 protein is likely to be a DEAD-box RNA helicase as it contains the nine highly conserved motifs (I, Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, V, VI, and Q), which characterize the members of this family (4Cordin O. Banroques J. Tanner N.K. Linder P. Gene (Amst.). 2006; 367: 17-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). A comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence to proteins in data bases further showed that hrp84 has homologues in other organisms. It seems to belong to the Ded1 subfamily of DEAD-box RNA helicases (38Linder P. Biol. Cell. 2003; 95: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), including Drosophila Belle (39Johnstone O.

https://openalex.org/W2045034826,"A 20-residue sequence from the C-terminal region of the circumsporozoite protein of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is considered a universal helper T cell epitope because it is immunogenic in individuals of many major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotypes. Subunit vaccines containing T* and the major B cell epitope of the circumsporozoite protein induce high antibody titers to the malaria parasite and significant T cell responses in humans. In this study we have evaluated the specificity of the T* sequence with regard to its binding to the human class II MHC protein DR4 (HLA-DRB1*0401), its interactions with antigen receptors on T cells, and the effect of natural variants of this sequence on its immunogenicity. Computational approaches identified multiple potential DR4-binding epitopes within T*, and experimental binding studies confirmed the following two tight binding epitopes: one located toward the N terminus (the T*-1 epitope) and one at the C terminus (the T*-5 epitope). Immunization of a human DR4 volunteer with a peptide-based vaccine containing the T* sequence elicited CD4+ T cells that recognize each of these epitopes. Here we present an analysis of the immunodominant N-terminal epitope T*-1. T*-1 residues important for interaction with DR4 and with antigen receptors on T*-specific T cells were mapped. MHC tetramers carrying DR4/T*-1 MHC-peptide complexes stained and efficiently stimulated these cells in vitro. T*-1 overlaps a region of the protein that has been described as highly polymorphic; however, the particular T*-1 residues required for anchoring to DR4 were highly conserved in Plasmodium sequences described to date.

Science. 1989; 246: 1603-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) combined with a B cell epitope from the NANP repeat region of the CS protein, high levels of P. falciparum-reactive antibodies against the CS repeat epitope were elicited in most volunteers of diverse HLA types (5Nardin E.H. Calvo-Calle J.M. Oliveira G.A. Nussenzweig R.S. Schneider M. Tiercy J.M. Loutan L. Hochstrasser D. Rose K. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). After being successfully examined in different malaria vaccine trials, the T* epitope has proven to be highly immunogenic (5Nardin E.H. Calvo-Calle J.M. Oliveira G.A. Nussenzweig R.S. Schneider M.

The strong correlation of T*-specific cellular responses with high anti-repeat antibody titers in the immunized volunteers suggests that the T* peptide functions as an effective Th (helper) epitope in vivo (5Nardin E.H. Calvo-Calle J.M. Oliveira G.A. Nussenzweig R.S. Schneider M. Tiercy J.M. Loutan L. Hochstrasser D. Rose K. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 6Oliveira G.A.

Sinigaglia F. Nardin E. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 489-499PubMed Google Scholar). In orchestrating a protective immune response to malaria parasites, the response of CD4+ T helper cells is of paramount importance for both humoral and cell-mediated immunity (4Nardin E.H.

The characterization of the response of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells for well defined malaria peptides is required for mechanistic understanding of generation of immunity induced by CS-based malaria vaccine candidates. Since their description in 1996 (11Altman J.D. Moss P.A. Goulder P.J. Barouch D.H. McHeyzer-Williams M.G. Bell J.I. McMichael A.J. Davis M.M.

However, the low avidity of MHC class II-peptide complexes by T cell receptors and the low frequencies in which antigen-specific CD8+ T cells typically are found, compared with their CD4+ counterparts, have made difficult the use of MHC class II-peptide complexes to study the response of CD4+ T cells ex vivo. Although MHC class II tetramers have been used successfully to enumerate antigen-specific CD4+ T cells in some viral and autoimmune diseases (18Meyer A.L. Trollmo C. Crawford F. Marrack P.

In malaria, besides these general problems that constrain the construction and usefulness of class II tetramers, the systematic analyses of malaria-specific human CD4+ T cells with defined MHC class II/peptide specificities and the identification of immunodominant CD4+ T cell epitopes remain a significant challenge. MHC class II proteins bind peptides by using a conserved network of hydrogen bonds between the peptide backbone and the conserved amino acid residues in the MHC class II binding groove, orienting peptide side chains at particular positions into defined subsites or pockets in the overall binding site (30Stern L.J. Brown J.H. Jardetzky T.S. Gorga J.C. Urban R.G. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). In human MHC class II HLA-DR alleles, these pockets typically accommodate side chains at the P1, P4, P6, P7, and P9 pockets, with the P1 pocket playing a major role and usually occupied by a hydrophobic side chain from a residue near the N terminus of the bound peptide. The side chains of the intervening residues, at positions P3, P5, and P8 (and sometimes P-1 or P11), are exposed to solvent in the MHC-peptide complex and can contact specificity loops of a T cell antigen receptor (TCR) (31Hennecke J. Wiley D.C. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 571-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies together with computational and experimental approaches have contributed to much understanding of the nature of the peptide-MHC interaction, and algorithms to predict relative binding of peptides to particular MHC class II alleles are available (32Hammer J. Bono E. Gallazzi F. Belunis C. Nagy Z. Sinigaglia F. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2353-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 33Southwood S. Sidney J. Kondo A. del Guercio M.F. Appella E.

Gallazzi F. Protti M.P. Sinigaglia F. Hammer J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). However, for pathogens with very large genomes such as malaria, their usefulness has been limited, and the identification of epitopes in this parasite still largely relies on experimental work (35Doolan D.L. Southwood S. Freilich D.A. Sidney J. Graber N.L. Shatney L. Bebris L. Florens L. Dobano C. Witney A.A. Appella E. Hoffman S.L. Yates J.R. II I Carucci D.J. Sette A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9952-9957Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified the binding register of a peptide (T*-1) found within the T* sequence that has high affinity for the human class II MHC protein DR4 (HLA-DRB1*0401), and we mapped key DR4 and T cell receptor interactions for this peptide. MHC-peptide tetramers carrying this epitope proved to be useful for the detection and in vitro stimulation of several T*-1-specific T cell clones isolated from an individual vaccinated with a synthetic vaccine carrying the T* epitope (5Nardin E.H. Calvo-Calle J.M. Oliveira G.A. Nussenzweig R.S. Schneider M. Tiercy J.M. Loutan L. Hochstrasser D. Rose K. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 36Calvo-Calle J.M. Oliveira G.A. Nardin E.H. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 7575-7585Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These T cells exhibit significant cross-reactivity with synthetic peptides representing natural P. falciparum variants of the CS protein as would be required in an effective vaccine. PeptidesSynthetic peptides were synthesized by a multiple solid-phase technique, using tert-butoxycarbonyl protection as described previously (37Houghten R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5131-5135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar), and were purified by reverse-phase HPLC on a C18 LiChrospher column (Merck). The quality of the synthesized products was assessed by analytical HPLC and mass spectrometry (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight). Biotinylated HA-(306-318) (PKYVKQNTLKLAT) test peptide, used for competition binding experiments, was N-terminally labeled with sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) prior to cleavage from the resin. This derivative incorporates a 6-carbon spacer between the biotin and the peptide. T Cell Clones and T Cell Stimulation Assays—T cell clones were isolated from blood samples obtained at different time points during the course of the (T1BT*)4-P3C vaccine trial from volunteers 09 and 10 (5Nardin E.H. Calvo-Calle J.M. Oliveira G.A. Nussenzweig R.S. Schneider M. Tiercy J.M. Loutan L. Hochstrasser D. Rose K. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 36Calvo-Calle J.M. Oliveira G.A. Nardin E.H. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 7575-7585Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). From volunteer 09 (haplotype DRB1*0401,1501 DQB1*0302,0602), T cell clones 1-3, 11, and 13 were isolated from blood samples at day 42 (14 days after second dose); clones 5 and 6 at day 84 (56 days after second dose); 92E10 at day 98 (14 days after third dose); and clones 19 and 64 at day 373 (289 days after third dose). From volunteer 10 (haplotype DRB1*0403,0701 DQB1*02,0302), T cell clones 7, 16, and 21 were isolated at day 42. The isolation of T cell clones and the determination of the genetic restriction of T*-specific CD4+ T cell clones from volunteer 09 and 10 used in this work was confirmed to be DRB1*0401 and DRB1*0403, respectively, and has been reported (36Calvo-Calle J.M. Oliveira G.A. Nardin E.H. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 7575-7585Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). T cell clones were expanded and maintained in culture in complete media by periodic stimulation in the presence of irradiated allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells and IL-2. For T cell proliferation assays, 2 × 104 T cells were incubated with 2 × 104 irradiated antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cell or DRB1*0401 homozygous Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cell line BSM) in 200 μl of complete media in the presence of 4 to 0.4 μm peptide. Culture supernatants were harvested at 24 h for bioassay of IL-2 and assessed as described (2Moreno A. Clavijo P. Edelman R. Davis J. Sztein M. Sinigaglia F. Nardin E. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 489-499PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]Thymidine incorporation was measured in a β-plate counter (Betaplate, Wallac 1205). Soluble Recombinant DR4 and DR4Cys Produced by Expression in Insect Cells—Expression of soluble DR4 (HLA-DRA*0101, DRB1*0401) and DR4Cys, which has an unpaired cysteine residue introduced at the C terminus of the α subunit, was performed using stable transfectants of Drosophila S2 Schneider cells, as described previously for DR1 and DR1Cys (24Cameron T.O. Norris P.J. Patel A. Moulon C. Rosenberg E.S. Mellins E.D. Wedderburn L.R. Stern L.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 268: 51-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In brief, S2 cells (ATCC) were co-transfected with plasmid pRMHa-3 (38Bunch T.A. Grinblat Y. Goldstein L.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1043-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) carrying genes coding for DRβ-(1-190) and either DRα-(1-190) or DRα-(1-190)-Ala-Cys behind an inducible metallothionine promoter, and also plasmid pNeo carrying a selectable marker, using a calcium phosphate protocol (Invitrogen). Stable transfected cell lines were established by selection under 1.0 mg/liter geneticin (Invitrogen). Six-liter cultures were grown in Sf900 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), 250 μg/liter amphotericin B, and 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), at 22-24 °C, either in stirred vessels (Bellco Glass, Vineland, NJ) bubbled gently with filtered air or in 2-liter shake flasks. Cell cultures were induced at a density of 5-10 × 106 per ml by the addition of 0.5 mm CuSO4, and culture supernatant was collected 4-6 days later by centrifugation at 4000 × g. Supernatant was concentrated 10-fold in a 10,000 molecular weight cut-off spiral filtration device (Millipore). DR4 and DR4Cys were purified by immunoaffinity with an LB3.1-conjugated protein A column, as described (39Frayser M. Sato A.K. Xu L. Stern L.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 15: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The final yields of DR4 and DR4Cys were in the range of 0.2-0.5 mg/liter of cultured cells. Preparation of Biotinylated DR4 (DR4bio)-Peptide Complexes—Biotin was conjugated to the unpaired cysteine on DR4Cys, using the thiol-specific reagent biotinyl-3-maleimidopropionamidyl-3,6-dioxaoctanediamine (PEO-maleimide-biotin; Pierce). In some cases the DR4Cys was treated with 5 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at room temperature before reaction to reduce spontaneous oxidation products, followed by gel filtration (SEC-3000; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 15 mm Na/KPO4, 135 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) to remove excess biotin. Biotinyl-3-maleimidopropionamidyl-3,6-dioxaoctanediamine (50 μm) was reacted with 1-2 μm DR4Cys in PBS for 10-30 min at room temperature and at pH 7.2, and the excess of reagent was quenched by the addition of 5 mm dithiothreitol. Excess biotin and dithiothreitol were removed by gel filtration as above, by extensive dialysis, or by repeated cycles of concentration and dilution in a 10,000 molecular weight cut-off spin ultrafiltration device (Centricon-10). Biotinylated DR4Cys (DR4bio) was concentrated to a final concentration of 4 μm and stored at 4 °C. For peptide loading, 4-5 μm of DR4bio and 40-50 μm of T* or other peptides were incubated together for 72 h at room temperature in binding buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide, 200 μm iodoacetamide, 0.05% octyl β-glucoside, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). DR4bio-peptide complexes were isolated by gel filtration and concentrated to 4-6 μm. Purified DR4bio-peptide complexes were supplemented with 5-10 m excess of peptide for storage at 4 or -20 °C, and remained stable for up to a year. Final yield was ∼0.05-0.1 mg of purified DR4bio-peptide complexes/liter of culture. Flow Cytometric Staining of T Cells Using MHC Tetramers—In order to conserve reagent, T cell staining reactions were performed in the smallest practical volumes. To prepare 10 μl of fluorescent DR4-oligomer (“tetramer”), 1 μlofDR4bio-peptide complex (0.3 mg/ml stock in PBS) was mixed with a total of 4 μlof(R)-phycoerythrin-labeled streptavidin (SA-PE, BIOSOURCE) (0.025 mg/ml prepared in PBS from 0.25 mg/ml stock), which was added stepwise in 1-μl portions over ∼10 min. During the procedure the tubes were kept on ice and afterward 5 μl of PBS were added. For staining, 5 μl of fluorescent oligomer solution was added to 105 T cells in 10-20 μl of culture medium in round-bottom or v-bottom 96-well plates. Cells were stained for 3 h in a 37 °C incubator, washed with PBS, and centrifuged at 1250 rpm for 10 min. At the end of the oligomer staining reaction, samples were chilled and stained with anti-CD4-APC for 20-30 min on ice. Samples were washed twice with cold wash buffer (PBS, 1% fetal bovine serum, 15 mm sodium azide) and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan or FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences). Stimulation of T Cells with Immobilized MHC Tetramer—Standard 96-well tissue culture plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 50 μl of 8 μm streptavidin (Promega) in PBS, and then were blocked for 2 h at 37 °C with 200 μl of 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS. DR4bio-peptide complexes (serial dilutions starting from 1 μm) were bound to the streptavidin-coated plates for 6 h at 37°C, and then the wells were washed twice with 200 μl of complete medium. For activation assay, 105 T cells in 150 μl of complete medium were added to each well, and the plate was incubated for 16 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Supernatants were removed, and secreted IL-2 was measured by bioassay as described above. T cells remaining in the plate were washed and stained on ice for 30 min with anti-CD3-FITC, anti-CD25-PE, and anti-CD69-APC (Pharmingen), followed by washing twice before analysis by flow cytometry. Peptide Binding Assays—Peptide binding to DR4 was analyzed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based competition assay as described previously (3Calvo-Calle J.M. Hammer J. Sinigaglia F. Clavijo P. Moya-Castro Z.R. Nardin E.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1362-1373PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hammer J. Bono E. Gallazzi F. Belunis C. Nagy Z. Sinigaglia F. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2353-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Purified HLA-DR4 molecules (3.8 pmol) were diluted into freshly prepared binding buffer containing biotin-labeled hemagglutinin HA-(306-318) (bio-HA-(306-318), 3.8 pmol), a well characterized tight binding peptide from influenza hemagglutinin (30Stern L.J.

Immunol. 1990; 144: 1849-1856PubMed Google Scholar), and various concentrations of unlabeled competitor peptide in a total volume of 120 μl. Peptides were diluted from stock solutions in 20% Me2SO/PBS; the final concentration of Me2SO was never greater than 0.01%. After 24 h of incubation at room temperature, 100 μl were transferred to 96-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay microtiter plates (Immuno Modules MaxiSorp, Nunc, Denmark), which previously had been coated overnight with a 10 μg/ml anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody L-243 solution, washed, and subsequently blocked with PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin. After 2 h of incubation at room temperature, the supernatants were removed, and the plates were washed three times with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with europium-labeled streptavidin (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Finally, the plates were washed as described above and incubated with DELFIA europium-chelator enhancement solution (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) before measurement of time-delayed europium fluorescence using a Victor (Wallac) microplate reader. IC50 values are reported as the competitor peptide concentration required to reduce the fluorescence to one-half the value observed in the absence of competitor peptide. Native Gel Electrophoresis—Peptide binding was also followed qualitatively by a native gel electrophoresis assay. DR4 (100 pmol) and T* or any other T* peptide derivative (1000 pmol) was mixed in binding buffer in a total volume of 25 μl. After 72 h of incubation at room temperature, the samples were analyzed by 10% PAGE in the absence of SDS. The electrophoresis was run under conditions in which gel and running buffer were kept at 4 °C to avoid heating the sample during electrophoresis. After the gels were run, they were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 and destained with a mixture of methanol (30%) and acetic acid (10%) in water. Prediction of MHC Peptide Binding Activity—Potential T cell epitopes were evaluated using a local modification of the matrix-based approach of Hammer et al. (32Hammer J. Bono E. Gallazzi F. Belunis C. Nagy Z. Sinigaglia F. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2353-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Matrix-based methods for predicting class II MHC peptide binding affinity assign a value to each amino acid residue at each position in a sliding nine-residue binding frame. In the original implementation, only peptides with Tyr, Trp, and Phe at the P1 position were considered (32Hammer J. Bono E. Gallazzi F. Belunis C. Nagy Z. Sinigaglia F. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2353-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In our local modification, 4L. J. Stern, personal communication. values are assigned for all possible amino acid residues at P1, with high values for Tyr, Trp, and Phe, intermediate values for Leu, Ile, Val, and Met, and low values for the other amino acids, essentially as described (34Sturniolo T. Bono E. Ding J. Raddrizzani L. Tuereci O. Sahin U. Braxenthaler M. Gallazzi F. Protti M.P. Sinigaglia F. Hammer J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1980717362,"While all studies of protein synthesis to date have employed monoaminoacylated transfer RNAs, there have been reports that bisphenylalanyl-tRNA is formed by Thermus thermophilus phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase. Such tandemly activated tRNAs have now been prepared by chemicoenzymatic techniques and are shown to function in both prokaryotic and mammalian protein synthesizing systems. They exhibit characteristics consistent with their possible utility under extreme conditions in natural systems and have important potential advantages for protein elaboration in cell free systems. Mechanistically, the bisaminoacylated tRNAs bind to the ribosomal A-site and utilize the aminoacyl moiety attached to the 3'-position of the terminal adenosine for addition to the growing polypeptide chain. Following translocation to the P-site and transfer of the formed peptidyl moiety, the donor tRNA dissociates from the ribosome as a monoaminoacylated tRNA capable of functioning in a subsequent polypeptide elongation step."
https://openalex.org/W1969154002,"Carboxypeptidase D (CPD) functions in the processing of proteins and peptides in the secretory pathway. Drosophila CPD is encoded by the silver gene (svr), which is differentially spliced to produce long transmembrane protein forms with three metallocarboxypeptidase (CP)-like domains and short soluble forms with a single CP domain. Many svr mutants have been reported, but the precise molecular defects have not been previously determined. In the present study, three mutant lines were characterized. svr PG33 mutants do not survive past the early larval stage. These mutants have a P-element insertion within exon 1B upstream of the initiation ATG, which greatly reduces mRNA levels of all forms of CPD. Both svr 1 and svr poi mutants are viable, with a silvery body color and pointed wings. The wing shape is generally similar between these two mutants, although svr poi mutants have smaller wings. The svr 1 gene has a three-nucleotide deletion in exon 6, removing a leucine in a region of the protein predicted to function as a folding domain for the second CP-like domain. svr poi has a 1072-bp duplication of the gene that introduces a stop codon into the open reading frame, causing the truncation of the protein in the middle of the second CP-like domain. Both deletions eliminate enzyme activity of the second CP-like domain and appear to cause the misfolding of the protein. This greatly reduces the levels of the long forms of CPD protein but do not affect the levels of the short forms. Taken together, these findings suggest that lethal and viable svr alleles differ in which protein forms are affected. Flies that retain the short form are viable, whereas flies that are missing all forms of CPD do not survive past the early larval stages.

Morgan J.I. Pecot M. Soumare A. Osborne A. Soares H.D. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2000; 16: 578-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Within each subfamily, the members show 35-60% amino acid sequence identity, but between subfamilies, there is only 15-25% amino acid sequence conservation. The A/B subfamily is primarily involved in protein digestion, either in the digestive track or elsewhere in the body. In contrast, the N/E subfamily plays more of a biosynthetic role by selectively removing specific residues from peptide processing intermediates, and this step often affects the biological properties of the substrate. In humans and mice, there are eight members of this N/E family, of which five show enzymatic activity (CPE, CPN, CPM, CPZ, and CPD); the remaining members of this subfamily (CPX1, CPX2, and AEBP-1/ACLP) are not active toward standard substrates (4Fricker L.D.

In contrast, Drosophila contains only two members of this subfamily, one that has high homology to CPM and another that is a CPD homolog (16Sidyelyeva G. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49613-49620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). CPD is unique among CPs in that it contains multiple CP-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytosolic tail (5Fricker L.D. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego2004: 848-851Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Humans, rats, mice, duck, and Drosophila CPD all contain three CP-like domains, of which the first two are enzymatically active and the third is missing key catalytic residues but still appears to retain the basic CP-like structure (16Sidyelyeva G.

One proposal is that the distinct pH optima of the first two domains enable CPD to be active throughout the secretory pathway, which ranges from neutral to acidic pH values (17Eng F.J. Novikova E.G.

In both duck and Drosophila, the first domain is more active at neutral pH, whereas the second domain is optimally active at pH 5-6 (16Sidyelyeva G. Fricker L.D. J. Biol.

There are several known mutations for CPD in Drosophila that are collectively known as the silver,or svr, mutants based on the silvery body color of the viable mutants (27Settle S.H.J. Green M.M. Burtis K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9470-9474Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 29Walter M.F. Zeineh L.L. Black B.C. McIvor W.E. Wright T.R.F. Biessmann H. Arch. Insect. Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 31: 219-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition to the body color, the viable svr mutants have been reported to show altered wing shape and mating behavior in light (30Wright T.R. Adv. Genet. 1987; 24: 127-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 31Lindsley D.L. Grell E.H. Genetic Variations of Drosophila melanogaster. Carnegie Institute, Baltimore1968: 468-469Google Scholar), although these results have not been adequately described in the literature. In addition to the viable svr mutants, there are a number of svr mutants that have been reported to be embryonic lethal (27Settle S.H.J. Green M.M. Burtis K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9470-9474Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 30Wright T.R. Adv. Genet. 1987; 24: 127-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 31Lindsley D.L. Grell E.H. Genetic Variations of Drosophila melanogaster. Carnegie Institute, Baltimore1968: 468-469Google Scholar). Through genetic complementation studies, the viable and lethal mutants were shown to represent the same gene, but the molecular basis of the defects was not characterized. The purpose of the present study was to first evaluate the phenotypic differences between CPD mutants and then to determine the molecular basis for each mutant. The results of these analyses provide insights into the function of the various domains of CPD. Drosophila Strains—Flies were maintained on standard cornmealagar Drosophila medium at 18 or 25 °C. Wild type stock (w-) and the mutants svr 1 and svr poi were obtained from Bloomington Stock Center. The mutant svr PG33 was obtained from Dr. Alain Vincent (32Bourbon H. Gonzy-Treboul G. Peronnet F. Alin M. Ardourel C. Benassayag C. Cribbs D. Deutsch J. Ferrer P. Haenlin M. Lepesant J. Noselli S. Vincent A. Mech. Dev. 2002; 110: 71-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The svr PG33 line was propagated as yw[PG33w+]/FM7. For selection of svr PG33 homozygous embryos, yw[PG33w+] flies were balanced over the FM7, act:GFP chromosome (obtained from Bloomington Stock Center). Embryos for RNA preparation were collected on agar-apple juice plates at 16-20 h after egg laying. Nonfluorescent svr PG33 homozygous embryos were selected using a Leica MZFLIII microscope with the GFP2 fluorescent filter. Wing Shape Analysis—Wings were cut from 3-4-day-old females and mounted in DPX mounting medium (Fluka BioChemika). Images were collected with a Nikon SMZ-U microscope with ×6 optical magnification. The relative length of each wing segment was determined by tracing the outline of the segment, as shown in Fig. 1, using ImageJ 1.33u (National Institutes of Health). The Effect of Light on Reproduction—Nine vials of each of the two viable silver mutants (svr 1, svr poi) and nine vials of wild type (w-) flies were used. Three vials of each strain were exposed to constant bright light by exposing the vials within 10-20 cm of a light box containing two 20-watt fluorescent bulbs. Three vials were wrapped in foil and kept in darkness for the same time period, and three vials were housed under regular conditions (ambient room light). Each vial contained 1-2 virgin males and 5-6 virgin females, which were put into the test within 1-8 h from eclosion. Flies were kept in vials for 2-5 days, the adults were discarded, and their progeny were counted. The entire experiment was repeated several times with comparable results. PCR and Sequencing—Genomic DNA for PCR amplification was prepared using the Qiagen DNeasy tissue kit. Pairs of oligonucleotides located 1-3 kb apart were used as PCR primers to determine if there were any large changes in the CPD gene in the svr mutants, compared with wild type flies. Each PCR product overlapped so that the entire 11-kb svr gene was covered. When an insert was identified within the svr poi mutant, several additional oligonucleotides were used to narrow down the insertion point. PCR product containing the insert was amplified, purified (Qiagen), introduced into the pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and sequenced. For the svr 1 mutant, this analysis did not reveal any detectable insertion or deletion. Therefore, the PCR was repeated using the Roche Expand HiFi PCR system to amplify all of the exons and introns of the svr 1 gene. PCR products from three independent reactions were gel-purified (Qiagen), and sequenced. The sequences were analyzed by the MegAlign program (DNA-Star). Southern Blot—To confirm the position of the P-element insertion in yw[PG33w+]/FM7 flies, the Southern blot method was employed. DNA was prepared by overnight digestion of 50 adult animals at 55 °C with 20 mg/ml Proteinase K (Invitrogen) in TNE buffer (0.1 m EDTA, 0.4 m NaCl, 5 mm Tris, pH 7.5) followed by the addition of 5 m NaCl, extraction with phenol/chloroform, and ethanol precipitation. Approximately 20 μg of genomic DNA was digested with EcoRI or ClaI and fractionated on a 0.9% agarose gel. After photography of the ethidium bromide-stained gel, the DNA was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Optitran; Scheicher and Schuell) and probed with a riboprobe corresponding to the 5′ end of fly CPD exon 1B. The production of the probe has been previously described (16Sidyelyeva G. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49613-49620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Approximately 3 × 106 cpm of exon 1B probe was hybridized with the nitrocellulose blot in 5× SSC (0.75 m NaCl, 75 mm sodium citrate), 50% formamide, 5× Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 50 °C overnight. After hybridization, the blot was washed with 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS, 1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS, and then 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS buffer at 50 °C. The blot was dried and exposed to x-ray film (X-Omat Blue XB-1; Eastman Kodak Co.) for 1 day at -80 °C with an intensifying screen. Northern Blot—Total RNA was prepared from embryos (16-20 h old), from larvae (third instar stage), and from adult w-, svr 1, and svr poi strains using the Qiagen RNeasy minikit. For yw[PG33w+]/FM7, act: GFP, only nonfluorescent embryos (16-20 h old) were used. About 7.5 μg of RNA was fractionated on an agarose gel containing 2% formaldehyde. After photography of the ethidium bromide-stained gel, the RNA was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Optitran; Scheicher and Schuell) and probed with fly CPD riboprobes. The riboprobes and Northern blot procedure have been previously described (16Sidyelyeva G. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49613-49620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The blots probed with exons 1A and 1B were exposed for 1 week, and the blots probed with exons 3 and 6 were exposed for 3 days at -80 °C with an intensifying screen. Protein Extraction, Purification, and Western Blot—To obtain the membrane fraction for Western blot analysis, frozen adult flies were homogenized (Polytron; Brinkman) in 0.1 m Na2CO3 (pH 11-12) and centrifuged at 15,000-30,000 × g for 20-30 min, and the pellet was resuspended and heated at 95 °C in gel loading buffer containing 4% SDS. To examine the forms of CPD in whole tissue extracts, the central neural system (CNS) was dissected from third instar larvae. Dissections were done in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), transferred to loading buffer containing 4% SDS, sonicated, heated at 95 °C, and loaded onto a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was transferred to nitrocellulose and probed as described below. For purification of the soluble forms of CPD, adult frozen flies were homogenized (Polytron) in 20 mm NaAc, pH 7.4, filtered through mesh, and centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 4 °C for 40 min at 40,000 × g. The second supernatant was adjusted to 100 mm NaAc, pH 5.5, and applied to a 0.5-ml p-aminobenzoyl-Arg-Sepharose affinity resin column as described (16Sidyelyeva G. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49613-49620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The column was first washed with 0.5 m NaCl and 1% Triton X-100 at pH 5.5 and then washed with 50 mm Tris containing 100 mm NaCl and 0.01% CHAPS at pH 8.0. CPD was eluted with 25 mm Arg in the Tris/NaCl, pH 8, wash buffer. Western Blot—Proteins were fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Optitran; Scheicher and Schuell). The nitrocellulose blots were blocked as described (16Sidyelyeva G. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49613-49620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Blots were probed with 1:1000 dilutions of polyclonal rabbit or mouse antisera raised against peptides corresponding to the N-terminal region of exon 1A, the N-terminal region of exon 1B, or the C-terminal region of exon 8, which corresponded to the long tail 2 form of Drosophila CPD (16Sidyelyeva G. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49613-49620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Following exposure of the blots to the primary antiserum, the blots were washed and exposed to horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit antiserum or sheep anti-mouse antiserum (Amersham Biosciences). The enhanced chemiluminescence method (Pierce) was used for detection of bound antiserum. Expression Constructs—For expression of different forms of CPD in the baculovirus system, reverse transcription-PCR was used to generate the wild type or mutant form of domain 2. These were then attached to fly CPD1 containing either exon 1A or 1B; the creation of the 1A and 1B forms of CPD has been previously described (16Sidyelyeva G. Fricker L.D. J. Biol.

CPD domain 2 was amplified as a 1.3-kb band for both wild type and svr 1 mutant flies using the Qiagen One Step reverse transcription-PCR kit. The 3′ oligonucleotide introduced a NotI restriction site (downstream of the coding region) to facilitate subsequent cloning steps. PCR products were digested with StuI and NotI, gel-purified (Qiagen), and ligated into StuI/NotI-digested CPD1A or CPD1B constructs, as described (16Sidyelyeva G. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49613-49620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To generate the svr poi mutant form of CPD domain 2, PCR was used to introduce the break point and short insert found in the svr poi gene sequence into the corresponding region of fly CPD cDNA. The oligonucleotide used for the mutagenesis included a NotI site downstream of the coding region, and the CPD1A/2wt construct described above was used as a template. After PCR with Platinum Taq (Invitrogen), the 780-bp product was purified (Qiagen) and subcloned into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen). Then the resulting plasmid was digested with StuI and NotI, and the 780-bp band was ligated into StuI/NotI-digested CPD1A or CPD1B. All of the constructs were confirmed by sequencing in both directions. Baculovirus Expression and Protein Purification—Baculovirus expressing only the short 1B form or wild type domain 2 were previously created (16Sidyelyeva G. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49613-49620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The new constructs containing either the 1A or the 1B form and one of three different sequences of domain 2 (wild type, svr 1,or svr poi) were generated using a similar procedure. For expression, 108 Sf9 cells growing in solution were infected with one of the baculovirus constructs. After 72 h, the cell suspensions were pelleted at 300 × g for 10 min, and the media were removed. Cells were resuspended in 50 mm NaAc, pH 7.4, and sonicated. Aliquots of media and cell homogenates were assayed for enzymatic activity, as described (16Sidyelyeva G. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49613-49620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), using 200 μm dansyl-Phe-Ala-Arg substrate in 100 mm Tris acetate at either pH 7.4 or 5.6. All enzyme assays were performed in triplicate, with variation among replicates typically less than 5%. Aliquots of media and cells were also analyzed on Western blots, as described above. The blots were probed with a 1:2000 dilution of a rabbit antiserum to purified duck CPD (AE178). For detection of bound antiserum, a 1:5000 dilution of IRDye 800-conjugated α-rabbit IgG (Rockland, Inc.) was used with an Odyssey® version 1.2 Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). To determine the solubility of the different CPD forms expressed in Sf9 cells, the cell pellets were sequentially extracted with 0.1 m Tris, pH 6.0; 0.1 m Tris, pH 6.0, containing 1 m NaCl; and 0.1 m Tris, pH 6.0, containing 1 m NaCl and 0.5% CHAPS. Each extraction step involved sonication of the pellet in the indicated buffer and centrifugation at 4 °C for 30 min at 24,000 × g. The final pellet remaining after all extractions was resuspended in Tris buffer. All fractions were assayed for carboxypeptidase activity at pH 5.6 and 7.4, as described above. Although the original Drosophila svr mutation was described many years ago and a number of other mutations in the svr gene have been reported (27Settle S.H.J. Green M.M. Burtis K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9470-9474Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), no previous reports have quantified the difference in wing shape between the viable svr mutants and wild type flies. To gain a more precise understanding of the phenotype of the viable svr mutants, the length of various wing veins was determined for svr 1, svr poi, and wild type Drosophila. Both of these viable svr mutants have pointed wings and show some common differences with wild type flies as well as several unique differences (Fig. 1). Both mutants have shorter proximal segments of the third and fourth longitudinal veins and longer distal segments of these veins (Fig. 1). Both mutants also have shorter anterior and posterior cross-veins (Fig. 1). Finally, both mutants have a longer wing edge between the second and third longitudinal veins and a shorter wing edge between the third and fourth longitudinal veins (Fig. 1). In general, the wings of the svr poi mutants are smaller than either the wild type or svr 1 wings, and many of the individual segments are shorter in the svr poi mutants compared with the other two. The above observations are consistent with the previous literature describing the phenotype of svr 1 and svr poi (27Settle S.H.J. Green M.M. Burtis K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9470-9474Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Lindsley D.L. Grell E.H. Genetic Variations of Drosophila melanogaster. Carnegie Institute, Baltimore1968: 468-469Google Scholar). However, it is possible that another mutation has spontaneously arisen in these lines and that this contributes to the observed phenotype. To ensure that the wing shape is solely due to the svr mutation, we crossed homozygous viable svr mutants with svr PG33 to create svr 1/svr PG33 and svr poi/svrPG33 lines. The same general tendency was observed in these two lines as found in the homozygous lines: decreased length of proximal wing parts, increased length of distal parts of the third, fourth, and fifth longitudinal veins, and decreased length of cross-veins (data not shown). Previously, svr 1 males were reported to be unable to mate when exposed to constant light (30Wright T.R. Adv. Genet. 1987; 24: 127-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W2043592748,"Through the yeast two-hybrid screen we have identified dynamin-2 as a molecule that interacts with the α subunit of the interleukin (IL) 5 receptor. Dynamin-2 is a GTPase that is critical for endocytosis. We have shown that dynamin-2 interacts with the IL-5 receptor-associated tyrosine kinases, Lyn and JAK2, in eosinophils. Tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin is markedly enhanced upon IL-5 stimulation. The inhibition of tyrosine kinases results in complete abolition of ligand-induced receptor endocytosis. Inhibition of dynamin by a dominant-negative mutant or by small interfering RNA results in enhancement of IL-5-stimulated ERK1/2 signaling and cell proliferation. In contrast, the absence of a functional dynamin does not affect STAT5 or AKT phosphorylation or cell survival. Thus, we have identified specific functions for dynamin in the IL-5 signaling pathway and demonstrated its role in receptor endocytosis and termination of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway.

Therefore, these trials cannot be used to define the role of eosinophils in asthma. Recent experimental data continue to strengthen the rationale for a role for eosinophils not only in inflammation but also in immunomodulation and airway remodeling (5Mattes J. Yang M. Mahalingam S.

IL-13 is a key regulator of airway hyperreactivity, and eosinophils were demonstrated to be essential for the secretion of this cytokine from T cells (5Mattes J. Yang M. Mahalingam S. Kuehr J.

Last but not least, in some experimental models eosinophils were shown to be a dominant source of Th2-type cytokines in the lung (9Shinkai K. Mohrs M. Locksley R.M.

The delineation of IL-5 signaling is critical for understanding eosinophil biology. Previous studies have demonstrated that IL-5 activates Janus and Src family tyrosine kinases, which leads to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathways and STAT family of transcription factors (11Adachi T.

Although much is known about the signal initiation and propagation by IL-5, the mechanism of signal termination is not fully understood. Cessation of signaling is essential for cellular homeostasis. Long-lasting or high-amplitude signals can be a source of pathological processes, e.g. excessive proliferation, prolonged survival, or hyperactivation of “unwanted” cell. Endocytosis of the receptor is one possible mechanism of signal termination (15Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Recently we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a hematopoietic cell cDNA library with the transmembrane-cytoplasmic portion of the IL-5 receptor α as bait (16Cen O. Gorska M.M. Stafford S.J. Sur S. Alam R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8837-8845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Among several different molecules, the screen has identified dynamin-2, a GTPase that is critical for endocytosis. Dynamin is believed to assemble around the necks of clathrin-coated pits and assist in pinching vesicles from the plasma membrane (17Sever S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We investigated the role of dynamin in IL-5 signaling and IL-5-stimulated cell function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—The following antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology: rabbit polyclonal anti-IL-5Rα, anti-IL-3/IL-5/granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor β chain, anti-pan-dynamin, anti-Lyn, anti-JAK2, anti-ERK1, anti-β-tubulin, anti-phospho-STAT5 (Tyr694), and mouse monoclonal anti-dynamin-1. Mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-ERK (Thr202/Tyr204) and rabbit polyclonal-anti-phospho-AKT (Thr308) were from Cell Signaling Technology. Mouse monoclonal anti-dynamin-2 antibody was from BD Transduction Laboratories. Mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (clone 4G10) was from Upstate Biotechnology.Interaction of Dynamin-2 with IL-5Ra in the Yeast Two-hybrid Assay— A human fetal cDNA library (Clontech) was screened using the LexA Matchmaker Yeast Two-hybrid System (Clontech). The bait was constructed by fusing the cytosolic and transmembrane portion of human IL-5Rα in-frame with the LexA DNA binding domain in the pLexA plasmid. The bait construct and the fetal human cDNA library in the pB42AD (Clontech) were cotransformed into the EGY48 yeast strain carrying the reporter plasmid p8opLacZ. The screening was performed as described (16Cen O. Gorska M.M. Stafford S.J. Sur S. Alam R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8837-8845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Plasmids from positive colonies were isolated and sequenced. To confirm the interaction of IL-5Rα with dynamin-2 in yeasts, vectors pLexA-IL-5Rα and/or pB42AD containing cDNA for human dynamin-2 were transfected into the yeast EGY48. Transfected yeast were examined for the activation of the reporter galactosidase gene lacZ. Transfection with dynamin-2 alone served as a negative control. Transfection with pLexA-p53 (p53) and pB42AD-SV-T (SV-T) served as a positive control.Eosinophil Purification and Stimulation—Blood for this study was obtained from mildly allergic and healthy donors (16Cen O. Gorska M.M. Stafford S.J. Sur S. Alam R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8837-8845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and the protocol for this study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston and the National Jewish Medical & Research Center in Denver. Eosinophils were isolated from peripheral blood as described (16Cen O. Gorska M.M. Stafford S.J. Sur S. Alam R. J. Biol.

In short, the polymorphonuclear cell fraction was isolated from the buffy coat by Percoll gradient (Amersham Biosciences) centrifugation. Eosinophils were negatively selected after incubation with anti-CD16 antibody-coated microbeads and passage through a magnetic column (Miltenyi Biotec). The stimulation of eosinophils was performed as described (16Cen O. Gorska M.M. Stafford S.J. Sur S. Alam R. J. Biol.

JYTF-1 cells were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor at 2 ng/ml. Before IL-5 stimulation cells were washed and starved in RPMI containing 0.5% FBS for 24 h. Stimulation with IL-5 was performed as described (18Yen J.J. Hsieh Y.C. Yen C.L. Chang C.C. Lin S. Yang-Yen H.F. J.

Briefly, cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF) for 30 min, on ice. After lysis cell debris were pelleted (7 min, 14,000 × g). For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were preclared with Protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and then incubated with antibody (2 μg of antibody per 2 million cells) for 1 h followed by a 2-h incubation with Protein A/G-agarose. The pelleted immune complexes were washed in RIPA buffer 5 times. The immune complex pellets were boiled in 2× Laemmli buffer. Samples were run on polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes at 100 V for 1.5 h. Membranes were subsequently blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin, TBS-T, incubated with primary antibody at 0.1 μg/ml for 2 h, washed, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:10000 for 30 min, washed, treated with the ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences), and exposed to ECL film. To strip and reprobe, the membranes were incubated in the stripping buffer (100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7) at 55 °C for 30 min, washed, blocked, and immunoblotted with a proper antibody as indicated in the text.Cell Surface Biotinylation and Streptavidin Pulldown—Eosinophils were stimulated with IL-5 for the times indicated in the text. Then cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) at 1 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h on ice. Next, cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline + 100 mm glycine and lysed in RIPA buffer. The protein concentration of the lysates was determined and the volume of the samples was adjusted to contain equal amounts of the protein. Biotinylated surface proteins were pulled down from lysates with streptavidinagarose (Sigma) and Western blotted with anti-IL-5Rα.Expression Plasmids, siRNA, and Transfection—pCB expression vectors containing human wild type dynamin-1 cDNA or K44A mutant of human dynamin-1 were a generous gift of Dr. Sandra Schmid, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA. pMCL expression vector containing the K97M mutant of MEK1 was from Dr. Natalie G. Ahn, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO. siRNA for human dynamin-2 (siGenome SMARTpool reagent) as well as non-targeting siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon. Non-targeting siRNA was directed against firefly luciferase and was designed to contain at least 4 mismatches with all known human, mouse, and rat genes. The transfection of JYTF-1 cells with plasmids or siRNA was performed using the Amaxa electroporator according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cell line Nucleofector Kit V was used.Staining for Fluorescent Microscopy—Paraformaldehyde-fixed JYTF-1 cells were placed on slides. Next, cells were blocked for 1 h in 5% serum in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% saponin, and then incubated at 4 °C overnight with mouse monoclonal anti-dynamin-2 antibody or isotype control antibody at 2 μg/ml. Alexa 488-labeled secondary antibody was used at 1 μg/ml. Cells were analyzed by fluorescent microscopy.Thymidine Incorporation—Forty-eight hours after siRNA transfection JYTF-1 were washed and starved overnight in RPMI containing 0.5% FBS. Next, cells were placed in 96-well plates at 5 × 104 cells per well in the medium containing 10% FBS with 50 μm PD98059 or with the vehicle (Me2SO). After 30 min of incubation in 37 °C, 5% CO2, IL-5 was added to a final concentration of 1 ng/ml. 3H-Labeled thymidine was added at 1 μCi per well 10 h later and cells were harvested at 96 h after transfection. The incorporated [3H]thymidine was measured by liquid scintillation.Survival Assay—Forty-eight hours after siRNA transfection JYTF-1 were washed and starved overnight in RPMI containing 0.5% FBS. Next, cells were placed in the medium containing 10% FBS with or without 10 ng/ml IL-5. Cells were washed 24 h later and stained with annexin V/propidium iodide according to the manufacturer's protocol (BD Pharmingen). The staining of the cells was analyzed by flow cytometry.Statistical Analyses—Each experiment was performed at least three times. Graphs in Figs. 2B, 3D, and 3G show mean ± S.D. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.FIGURE 3Endocytic pathway is affected by IL-5-activated tyrosine kinases.

B, dynamin-2 interacts with Lyn and JAK2 only in the presence of IL-5Rα. Eosinophils were stimulated with IL-5 and lysed. Lysate was divided into two samples.

These two IL-5Rα immunoprecipitates (1st IP pellet, 2nd IP pellet) and the second post-IP supernatant (2nd IP sup) were Western blotted with anti-IL-5Rα antibody and, next, reprobed with anti-dynamin-2 antibody (left panels). IL-5Rα-depleted and non-depleted eosinophil lysate samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-Lyn (middle panels) and anti-JAK2 (right panels) antibodies or control IgG (cIgG). Immunoprecipitates were Western blotted with anti-dynamin-2 antibody. Membranes were reprobed with anti-Lyn (middle panels) and anti-JAK2 (right panels) antibodies.

The transmembrane-cytoplasmic portion of the IL-5 receptor α was fused to the DNA binding domain of LexA and used as bait in the yeast two-hybrid screen of a human fetal liver cDNA library. Dynamin-2, a molecule involved in vesicular trafficking, represented one of several IL-5Rα-interacting molecules identified in the screen. Fig. 1A shows the subsequent verification of dynamin-2/IL-5Rα interaction in the yeast. Transfection of yeast EGY48 with plasmids encoding the IL-5Rα-LexA fusion protein (LexA binds to a promoter of the reporter gene lacZ) together with plasmid encoding dynamin 2-RNA polymerase II activator fusion protein caused the activation of the reporter galactosidase gene lacZ (positive blue colonies). Transfection with dynamin-2-RNA polymerase II activator alone or with IL-5Rα-LexA alone produced negative white colonies. The interaction of p53 with SV-T in the yeast two-hybrid system served as a positive control and gave blue colonies. Next we examined if this association occurred in eosinophils. Eosinophils were isolated from human peripheral blood according to a standard protocol (12Pazdrak K. Schreiber D. Forsythe P. Justement L. Alam R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1827-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Cells were subsequently stimulated with IL-5 or incubated in the medium alone. The immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with an anti-IL-5Rα antibody followed by Western blotting with an anti-dynamin-2 antibody demonstrated the interaction of dynamin-2 with α subunit of IL-5 receptor in eosinophils (Fig. 1B, left panels). The association with IL-5Rα was not dependent on stimulation with IL-5. We performed two control immunoprecipitation experiments. First, control IgG isolated from non-immunized rabbit (the immunoprecipitating anti-IL-5Rα antibody was generated in the rabbit) was unable to precipitate dynamin from eosinophil lysates. Second, anti-IL-5Rα antibody did not precipitate dynamin from the IL-5Rα-negative cell lines, HEK 293 (kidney epithelium) and NIH 3T3 (fibroblasts). It is important to note that the expression of dynamin-2 at the protein level in 293 and 3T3 cells is very well documented (19Vila-Coro A.J. Mellado M. Martin de Ana A. Martinez-A C.

We were also able to detect IL-5Rα/dynamin-2 interaction by immunoprecipitation with anti-dynamin-2 antibody followed by Western blotting with anti-IL-5Rα antibody (Fig. 1B, right panels).FIGURE 1IL-5Rα interacts with dynamin-2. A, IL-5Rα interacts with dynamin-2 in the yeast. Vectors pLexA-IL-5Rα (IL-5Rα) and/or pB42AD-dynamin-2 were transfected into the yeast EGY48. The interaction of IL-5Rα and dynamin-2 in the yeast caused the activation of the reporter galactosidase gene lacZ (positive blue colonies). Transfection with dynamin-2 plasmid alone or pLexA-IL-5Rα (IL-5Rα) alone produced white colonies. Transfection with pLexA-p53 (p53) and pB42AD-SV-T (SV-T) served as a positive control for the protein/protein interaction. The interaction between p53 and SV-T is well established. B, IL-5Rα interacts with dynamin-2 in eosinophils. Left panels, eosinophils were purified from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers, incubated with or without IL-5 and lysed. As a control, lysates of IL-5Rα-negative, dynamin-2-positive cell lines HEK 293 (293) and NIH 3T3 (3T3) were used. Protein concentration was determined in all lysates. The volume of samples was adjusted to contain an equal amount of protein. Lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with a rabbit anti-IL-5Rα antibody (Ab) or control IgG (cIgG). cIgG was isolated from non-immunized rabbit. Immunoprecipitates were Western blotted (WB) with anti-dynamin-2 antibody (upper panel). To assess protein loading, membranes were reprobed with anti-IL-5Rα (middle and bottom panels) antibody. IgH, immunoglobulin heavy chain. Right panels, eosinophils were incubated with or without IL-5 and lysed. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-dynamin-2 monoclonal antibody or isotype-matched mouse IgG (cIgG). Immunoprecipitates were Western blotted with an anti-IL-5Rα antibody (upper panel) and, next, reprobed with the anti-dyanmin-2 antibody (middle and bottom panels). C, eosinophils were incubated with or without IL-5 and lysed. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with a mouse monoclonal anti-β chain antibody or control isotype-matched mouse IgG (cIgG). Immunoprecipitates were Western blotted with the anti-dynamin-2 (upper panel) antibody. Membranes were reprobed with antibody againstβ chain (β, second panel from the top, and IgH, bottom panel), and, next, with anti-IL-5Rα (third panel from the top).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)IL-5 receptor is composed of α and β subunits. The α subunit interacts with the β subunit only upon stimulation with IL-5. In co-immunoprecipitation experiments we demonstrated lack of dynamin-2 interaction with the β subunit in unstimulated eosinophils (Fig. 1C). IL-5 stimulation resulted in the association of β subunit with IL-5Rα and dynamin.IL-5 Receptor α Is Internalized upon IL-5 Stimulation—The association of IL-5 receptor with the endocytosis-regulating molecule prompted us to study receptor internalization. We asked how much of IL-5Rα remained on the cell surface in the course of IL-5 stimulation. To this goal we labeled cell surface proteins of resting or IL-5-stimulated eosinophils with biotin. Next, biotinylated proteins were precipitated from cell lysates with streptavidin-agarose and Western blotted with IL-5Rα antibody. The expression of IL-5Rα on the cell surface in the course of IL-5 stimulation is shown in Fig. 2, A, upper panel, and B. At 10 minof IL-5 stimulation the surface level of IL-5Rα reached a nadir and was equal to 39% of basal expression. After this time point, the IL-5 receptor slowly reappeared on the cell surface. In control experiments we measured the surface expression of CD45. To our knowledge there are no reports suggesting changes of CD45 surface expression in eosinophils within 60 min of IL-5 stimulation. The surface level of CD45 did not change upon IL-5 stimulation and was comparable with that in unstimulated cells (Fig. 2, A, bottom panel, and B).Dynamin-2 Coprecipitates with Lyn and JAK2 Kinases—Next we studied whether dynamin interacted with IL-5R-bound signaling molecules. The very first step in the IL-5 signaling cascade is the activation of the Src family tyrosine kinase Lyn and the Janus family tyrosine kinase JAK2 (12Pazdrak K. Schreiber D. Forsythe P. Justement L. Alam R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1827-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 13Pazdrak K. Stafford S. Alam R. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 397-402PubMed Google Scholar). These kinases are essential for eosinophil function. In coprecipitation experiments we showed dynamin interaction with both Lyn and JAK2 in eosinophils (Fig. 3A). The association of dynamin-2 with tyrosine kinases was independent of stimulation with IL-5. Next we asked if the association of dynamin-2 with the tyrosine kinases occurs in the absence of IL-5Rα.To this goal IL-5-stimulated eosinophil lysates were depleted of IL-5Rα (and molecules associated with this receptor) by two sequential immunoprecipitations with the anti-IL-5Rα antibody. The post-immunoprecipitation supernatant was free of IL-5Rα but contained dynamin-2, Lyn, and JAK2 (Fig. 3B). Coprecipitation experiments demonstrated a lack of dynamin-2 interaction with tyrosine kinases when IL-5Rα (and IL-5Rα interacting molecules) was removed from the cell lysate. In contrast, the interaction was detected in control, non-depleted cell lysates. These results suggest that IL-5Rα acts as a signaling scaffold, which promotes dynamin/kinase interaction. In the absence of the scaffold, dynamin-2 and the tyrosine kinases do not interact.Dynamin-2 Is Tyrosine-phosphorylated upon IL-5 Stimulation—To investigate the functional connection between dynamin and kinases we first examined the tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin in eosinophils (Fig. 3, C and D). To this goal eosinophils were stimulated with IL-5 or incubated in the medium alone. Subsequently dynamin-2 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and examined by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Dynamin showed minor tyrosine phosphorylation in resting eosinophils. Upon IL-5 stimulation dynamin underwent significant phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner.The Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor, Genistein Blocks IL-5 Receptor α Internalization—The experiments demonstrating IL-5-inducible phosphorylation of dynamin encouraged us to study the relevance of tyrosine phosphorylation for receptor endocytosis. We examined the phosphorylation of dynamin and surface"

But several major hurdles have put human embryonic stem cell research on hold. It has been one year since Brazil passed a law enabling scientists to work with human embryonic stem cells and to derive new stem cell lines from human embryos. But several major hurdles have put human embryonic stem cell research on hold. One year ago, the Brazilian House of Representatives finally approved the Biosafety Bill, which made it legal in Brazil to work with human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and to derive hESC lines from surplus or nonviable human embryos stored for three or more years in IVF (in vitro fertilization) clinics. Under the new law, no human embryo can be created for research purposes, and therapeutic cloning using somatic cell nuclear transfer is still forbidden. When the last vote on the Biosafety Bill was cast, the audience erupted into cheers as the result was announced: 352 in favor of passing the law, 60 against. Patients with muscular dystrophy joined hands with geneticist Mayana Zatz, a leading muscular dystrophy researcher, and with the Science and Technology Minister at that time, Eduardo Campos, to celebrate a landmark victory for Brazil's scientific research community. After years of campaigning, scientists and patient advocates had obtained the right to produce and work with hESC lines in Brazil. However, one year after this encouraging victory, the applause has evaporated because not a single hESC colony has been derived so far. What are the reasons for this delay? Within one month of the vote, the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (better known by the old acronym CNPq), Brazil's equivalent to the U.S. National Science Foundation, earmarked $5 million for stem cell research and published a call for cell therapy projects. Half of the funds were to come from the Science and Technology Ministry and half from the Health Ministry, which was eager to reap public health benefits from the new field of research, particularly as patient lobby groups had helped to get the Biosafety Bill passed. The selection committee for the CNPq stem cell grants received 106 proposals from research groups all over Brazil. However, only 41 projects made it through to the next stage. The selection committee was composed of six biology researchers working at well-regarded institutions such as the University of São Paulo (USP) and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). The committee included Dr. Anibal Gil Lopes, which raised concerns in scientific circles because although Dr. Lopes is a respected researcher at UFRJ, he is also a Catholic priest and a member of the Vatican's Pontifical Academy Pro Vita. When the committee announced which projects would be funded at the end of August last year, CNPq found itself under heavy fire. Of the 41 projects funded, only three explicitly involved the study of ESCs and one of these was a proposal to grow rabbit (not human) ESCs on a substrate of iron nanoparticles to establish whether ESC colonies can be grown in the absence of mouse feeder cells. Surprisingly, the proposal by Mayana Zatz of USP to derive hESC lines from human embryos was turned down, as was the proposal by Lygia da Veiga Pereira, an experienced stem cell researcher also from USP and Zatz's former collaborator. The feedback Pereira received from the selection committee filled a single line: “The proposal is plagued by lack of originality and does not show evidence of how the availability of those [hES] cells will be able to impact breakthroughs in human health.” Says Pereira, “The result of the call for projects had disappointed many of us.” José Eduardo Krieger at INCOR—a renowned cardiology clinical research center linked to USP—also was dissatisfied with the selection committee's initial decision not to fund his proposal to study the biology of hESCs. He was particularly surprised about the absence of projects directed at the derivation of hESCs among the list of funded projects. “Such an important thing could never have been left out, since this is a key reagent in this area if we want to succeed in the development of new therapeutic approaches for adult organ repair.” Krieger received a similar response to his grant proposal stating that although his project had merit the team had not enough expertise and experience to carry it out. Krieger, the head of the Genetics and Molecular Cardiology Lab at INCOR, was surprised by the allegation, given that his group had been chosen a few months earlier to run one of the four arms of a 1,200-patient, $6 million clinical trial to treat cardiomyopathy with adult human bone marrow stem cells, sponsored by the very same ministries. Zatz, Pereira, and Krieger, together with nine other principal investigators, appealed their decisions. The CNPq selection committee made public their final decision at the end of November last year: Four appeals were accepted, including those of the three USP research groups. Subsequently, CNPq argued that the reversal was due solely to the new scientific arguments provided by the research groups that appealed, and not to the controversy triggered by the first decision in August. Given the difficulties surrounding the launch of hESC research in Brazil, Pereira and her collaborator Stevens Rehen are spearheading an initiative to reach out to the private sector in the form of a Stem Cell Virtual Institute (IVCT, http://www.ivct.com.br). The idea behind this network of stem cell investigators is to attract private funds to finance the advancement of hESC research in Brazil, primarily through scientific collaborations and meetings, as well as through development and dissemination of protocols to promote standardization and to assure comparability of research outputs among laboratories throughout the country. “IVCT will also provide an interface to discuss ethical issues and cellular therapies with physicians, the public, biotech companies and the press in Brazil,” says Rehen. Thirty-five Brazilian laboratories have expressed interest in joining IVCT, whose Board is now in the process of uploading protocols and references onto the new website as well as information about plans to convene a meeting to discuss the first research results in a few months. Meanwhile, hESC research in Brazil is facing another major hurdle. Claudio Fonteles, in one of his last acts as Brazil's Attorney General, brought a so-called “ação direta de inconstitucionalidade” (direct unconstitutionality claim) against the Biosafety Law before the Federal Supreme Court in May last year. A devout Catholic, his petition argued that the permission to destroy human blastocysts to derive hESCs offended the basic constitutional tenet of life's inviolability: “The central thesis in the present claim is that human life happens in and starting with [the moment of] fertilization.” His successor, Antonio Fernando Souza, supported the stance against hESCs in a brief to the Supreme Court dated November 18, 2005. The constitutional issue is now under scrutiny by Justice Carlos Ayres Britto, who is expected to announce his decision in the next few weeks. It is widely believed that Britto will vote in favor of the Biosafety Law. However, a subsequent vote by the Plenum (a plenary session where at least 8 of the 11 Federal Supreme Court judges are present) is considered unpredictable. Thus, hESC research in Brazil is standing on rather uncertain terrain. Colonies of hESCs received from laboratories outside of Brazil have just started to be unfrozen. Only in January this year, did CNPq begin to channel research money to the 45 research groups whose projects had been approved. But even if the research money is flowing, the two USP projects that aim to derive hESC lines remain in jeopardy under the pending Supreme Court decision. Although hESC research faces numerous roadblocks, research on adult stem cells continues to thrive in Brazil. Several clinical studies have yielded at least some successes using transplants of adult bone marrow stem cells to treat a host of diseases from diabetes and cardiomyopathy to hepatic cirrhosis. One of the biggest clinical projects currently underway, funded by the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Science and Technology, is to use adult bone marrow stem cells to treat cardiomyopathies. More than 30 groups across the country are now part of the 1,200-patient Randomized Multicenter Study on Cellular Therapy in Cardiomyopathies (EMRTCC). There are four arms to the clinical trial—patients with dilated cardiomyopathy due to Chagas disease (a serious illness caused by a trypanosome parasite that is endemic in much of South America), and patients with general dilated cardiomyopathy, chronic ischemia, or acute myocardial infarction. There are 300 patients per arm: 150 will receive injections of autologous bone marrow stem cells into the heart, and 150 will serve as the control group. The EMRTCC clinical trial follows preliminary safety studies with small numbers of patients, which showed that the procedure is safe. In Brazil, clinical studies using adult stem cells are not overseen by ANVISA, the agency equivalent to the FDA in the United States, because the injection of adult bone marrow stem cells into the heart is considered an extension of existing therapies. The sole requirement for this type of clinical study is approval from the National Council for Ethics in Research (CONEP). About 100 patients have undergone the adult bone marrow stem cell injections so far, less than 10 percent of the total 1,200. In spite of that, the Health Ministry boasts that Brazil is doing pioneer research and taking a leading role in the development of stem cell therapies. Highly publicized estimates point to the goal of saving 200,000 lives over three years, once the technology is available, and saving $200 million annually in heart transplant costs. The work with adult stem cells has certainly proved an efficient way to gather public support for stem cell research in general. For instance, Brazil's most popular weekly news magazine Veja portrayed stem cells on the cover of its November 23, 2005 issue with the headline “The medicine that operates miracles.” One pressing issue that needs to be addressed is the confusion among the general public regarding the difference between hESCs and adult stem cells, and how long it will be before either stem cell population is in routine clinical use. Krieger at INCOR considers that the nuanced differences between embryonic and adult stem cells have never been thoroughly laid out to the public. “It was a collective failure. I often talk to journalists, but have not been sufficiently convincing, as those nuances have never made it to print.” Several participants discussed this issue at the 1st Brazilian Meeting on Human Embryonic Stem Cells, in Rio de Janeiro in November of last year. Striking a cautionary note was Luiz Eugênio Mello, a neuroscientist with the Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP) and vice president of the Brazilian Federation of Experimental Biology Societies (FeSBE). He hoped for expectations to be less “excessive” so as not to turn stem cell research into “another gene therapy,” by which he meant a glaring disappointment in the eyes of the general public. His concern was echoed by Pereira. She regrets the wrong message sent by the celebrations after the Biosafety Law was passed, which suggested that stem cell therapies were just around the corner. Zatz, however, counters “All the patients who were there [in Congress] knew perfectly well that we were defending the research. One has to consider that we deal with a population that has almost no degree of education, and maybe they think that we are going to inject hESCs and cure them immediately,” she says. “On the other hand, if we had not been very emphatic, perhaps we would not have won as we did.” Not all Brazilian scientists are jumping on the stem cell bandwagon, however. Luiz Fernando Lima Reis, from the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research and chair of the controversial CNPq selection committee, would rather see more emphasis on basic research. “My personal belief is that Brazil, as any other country in the world, needs to investigate the biology of stem cells. I think there is hype and precipitation in the clinical use, or alleged clinical use, of stem cells. We don't know yet the biology of these cells,” he said in an interview. “There is an anxiety to treat people. We are cutting corners that are of major importance.” With a final decision by the Federal Supreme Court expected shortly and funds beginning to flow from CNPq, Brazilian stem cell research should be able to take off at last. It remains to be seen whether initiatives such as IVCT will succeed in engaging the general public in the debate, such that societal support for this type of research can be based on solid information and not on unwarranted expectations about the powers of biomedicine."
