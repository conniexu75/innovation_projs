https://openalex.org/W2079030291,"Human brains retain discrete populations of micro RNA (miRNA) species that support homeostatic brain gene expression functions; however, specific miRNA abundance is significantly altered in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer disease (AD) when compared with age-matched controls. Here we provide evidence in AD brains of a specific up-regulation of an NF-κB-sensitive miRNA-146a highly complementary to the 3′-untranslated region of complement factor H (CFH), an important repressor of the inflammatory response of the brain. Up-regulation of miRNA-146a coupled to down-regulation of CFH was observed in AD brain and in interleukin-1β, Aβ42, and/or oxidatively stressed human neural (HN) cells in primary culture. Transfection of HN cells using an NF-κB-containing pre-miRNA-146a promoter-luciferase reporter construct in stressed HN cells showed significant up-regulation of luciferase activity that paralleled decreases in CFH gene expression. Treatment of stressed HN cells with the NF-κB inhibitor pyrollidine dithiocarbamate or the resveratrol analog CAY10512 abrogated this response. Incubation of an antisense oligonucleotide to miRNA-146a (anti-miRNA-146a; AM-146a) was found to restore CFH expression levels. These data indicate that NF-κB-sensitive miRNA-146a-mediated modulation of CFH gene expression may in part regulate an inflammatory response in AD brain and in stressed HN cell models of AD and illustrate the potential for anti-miRNAs as an effective therapeutic strategy against pathogenic inflammatory signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2141916182,"To advance the use of colloids as building blocks for the fabrication of large-scale complex structures for applications in nanotechnology, it is desirable to give them the functionality and variability found in chemistry. A step in that direction has now been achieved with the development of magnetic colloids that can rapidly self-assemble into a variety of isomeric forms. Depending on the shape of the colloidal blocks relative to their spontaneous direction of magnetization, these colloids self-assemble into structures with controlled helicity. If the size ratio between the colloidal spheres in the assembly is large enough, a single helicity is chosen, right or left. This work opens up a new link between colloidal science and chemistry that could lead to the assembly of a wide variety of nanoparticles and mesopolymers. Chirality is an important element of biology, chemistry and physics. Once symmetry is broken and a handedness is established, biochemical pathways are set. In DNA, the double helix arises from the existence of two competing length scales, one set by the distance between monomers in the sugar backbone, and the other set by the stacking of the base pairs1. Here we use a colloidal system to explore a simple forcing route to chiral structures. To do so we have designed magnetic colloids that, depending on both their shape and induced magnetization, self-assemble with controlled helicity. We model the two length scales with asymmetric colloidal dumbbells linked by a magnetic belt at their waist. In the presence of a magnetic field the belts assemble into a chain and the steric constraints imposed by the asymmetric spheres force the chain to coil. We show that if the size ratio between the spheres is large enough, a single helicity is adopted, right or left. The realization of chiral colloidal clusters opens up a new link between colloidal science and chemistry. These colloidal clusters may also find use as mesopolymers, as optical and light-activated structures2, and as models for enantiomeric separation."

Although a previous study found TORC2 phosphorylation to be involved in the suppression of AMPK-mediated CRE transcriptional activity, we herein present evidence that glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) phosphorylation induced by AMPK also plays an important role. We initially found that injecting fasted mice with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) markedly increased Ser-9 phosphorylation of hepatic GSK3β within 15 min. Stimulation with AICAR or the GSK3β inhibitor SB-415286 strongly inhibited CRE-containing promoter activity in HepG2 cells. Using the Gal4-based transactivation assay system, the transcriptional activity of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) was suppressed by both AICAR and SB415286, whereas that of TORC2 was repressed significantly by AICAR but very slightly by SB415286. These results show inactivation of GSK3β to directly inhibit CREB but not TORC2. Importantly, the AICAR-induced suppression of PEPCK-C expression was shown to be blunted by overexpression of GSK3β(S9G) but not wild-type GSK3β. In addition, AICAR stimulation decreased, whereas Compound C (AMPK inhibitor) increased CREB phosphorylation (Ser-129) in HepG2 cells. The time-courses of decreased CREB phosphorylation (Ser-129) and increased GSK3β phosphorylation were very similar. Furthermore, AMPK-mediated GSK3β phosphorylation was inhibited by an Akt-specific inhibitor in HepG2 cells, suggesting involvement of the Akt pathway. In summary, phosphorylation (Ser-9) of GSK3β is very likely to be critical for AMPK-mediated PEPCK-C gene suppression. Reduced CREB phosphorylation (Ser-129) associated with inactivation of GSK3β by Ser-9 phosphorylation may be the major mechanism underlying PEPCK-C gene suppression by AMPK-activating agents such as biguanide. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation reportedly suppresses transcriptional activity of the cAMP-responsive element (CRE) in the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase C (PEPCK-C) promoter and reduces hepatic PEPCK-C expression.

It was also reported that stimulation with the AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) suppresses hepatic PEPCK-C expression and the transcriptional activity of the cAMP-responsive element (CRE), which is present in the PEPCK-C promoter, actions similar to those of insulin (9Bady I. Marty N. Dallaporta M. Emery M. Gyger J. Tarussio D. Foretz M. Thorens B. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 988-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). AMPK achieves its downstream effects by immediate direct phosphorylation of enzyme substrates as well as long term effects on gene expression. For example, AMPK phosphorylates and inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase, resulting in suppression of the conversion of acetyl CoA to malonyl CoA (4Zhou G. Myers R. Li Y. Chen Y. Shen X. Fenyk-Melody J. Wu M. Ventre J. Doebber T. Fujii N. Musi N. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (4289) Google Scholar). This malonyl CoA reduction allows entry of fatty acids into mitochondria and their subsequent oxidation (10Winder W.W. Wilson H.A. Hardie D.G. Rasmussen B.B. Hutber C.A. Call G.B. Clayton R.D.

Recently, as a molecular mechanism underlying AMPK-mediated PEPCK-C gene suppression, the phosphorylation of TORC2 (transducer of regulated CREB activity 2), a co-activator of cAMP-responsive element binding (CREB) protein, by AMPK was reported (12Koo S.H. Flechner L. Qi L. Zhang X. Screaton R.A. Jeffries S. Hedrick S. Xu W. Boussouar F. Brindle P. Takemori H. Montminy M.

TORC2 phosphorylated by AMPK or SIK binds to 14-3-3, and this complex is transported from inside the nucleus to the cytoplasm (16Screaton R.A. Conkright M.D. Katoh Y. Best J.L. Canettieri G.

Thus, by reducing the association with TORC2 and CREB in the nucleus, CRE transcriptional activity and PEPCK-C expression are suppressed. On the other hand, it has been revealed that CRE transcriptional activity is regulated not only by nuclear TORC2 but also by the phosphorylation of CREB. For example, forskolin stimulates cAMP production and enhances PEPCK-C gene expression by stimulating the protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of CREB at Ser-133 and by promoting subsequent recruitment of the coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) to the promoter (18Zhou X.Y.

Furthermore, CREB has been regarded as one of the potential nuclear substrates of GSK3β, which were identified by in vitro phosphorylation and overexpression studies (20Fiol C.J. Williams J.S.

Thus, it has been suggested that GSK3β phosphorylates CREB at Ser-129, leading to a stimulatory effect on CREB activity, and that CREB is involved in the cAMP-mediated activation of PEPCK-C expression (22Tullai J.W.

Because Akt/protein kinase B phosphorylates and inactivates GSK3β, insulin-induced suppression of CRE transcriptional activity is likely to be mediated by Akt-induced GSK3β phosphorylation at Ser-129. The phosphorylations of either CREB or TORC2 could, thus, regulate transcriptional activity and thereby the gene expression of PEPCK-C. In this study we observed that AMPK activation increases GSK3β phosphorylation rapidly and markedly in the mouse liver. Then, we performed experiments to determine whether AMPK-induced PEPCK-C gene suppression is indeed mediated by increased GSK3β phosphorylation. Herein, we present evidence showing a critical role of GSK3β phosphorylation in the AMPK-induced suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis. Reagents—AMPK inhibitor Compound C and Akt inhibitor IV were purchased from Calbiochem. Phospho-ACC (Ser-79), phospho-Akt (Thr-308), and phospho-GSK3β(Ser-9) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Invitrogen. All other reagents were of analytical grade. A rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against a SIK(C) fragment (amino acid residues 1–343) or TORC2 peptide (563–699) in rabbits as described previously (25Ogihara T. Shin B.C. Anai M. Katagiri H.

Preparation of Tissue Extracts—After an overnight fast or injection of AICAR (250 mg/kg), the animal was killed by cervical dislocation before removal of the liver. One part of the liver was homogenized in 10 volumes of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin). The solution was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, and the protein concentration was measured using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Cell Culture—Human hepatoma HepG2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). HepG2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5.5 mm d-glucose. The cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C and passaged every 3 days by trypsinization. Primary hepatocytes were isolated from male C57B6 mice by the collagenase method. Cells were suspended in William's E medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 nm insulin, 75 mg/liter penicillin, and 50 mg/liter streptomycin and then plated. After 12 h, serum was removed, and the cells were divided into control or dexamethasone (1 μm) groups. The medium was the same as that described above except that 0.1% bovine serum albumin was added instead of fetal bovine serum. Construction and Luciferase Assay—The following plasmids were obtained from commercial sources: pTAL, pTAL-CRE and pM from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA) and pGL4.10 and pRL-TK from Promega (Madison, WI). The PEPCK-C promoter (–450 to –1) was inserted into a pGL4.10 vector (Promega). HepG2 cells in a 12-well collagen-coated plate were cotransfected with PEPCK-C-LUC vector (0.5 μg/well) with an internal reporter, pRL-TK (0.03 μg). For the CREB or TORC2 reporter assay, cells were transformed with Gal4 DNA binding domain-linked CREB expression vectors (pM-CREB, pM-TORC2, or pM, empty vector, 0.15 μg) and reporter vectors (UAS-linked luciferase reporter (pTAL-5x UAS, 0.15 μg) and an internal reporter, pRL-TK (0.03 μg)). pM was used to express a fusion protein that possessed the GAL4 DNA binding domain at the N terminus of a protein of interest. The fusion protein was transported into the nucleus by the SV40 nuclear localization sequence created in the GAL4 DNA binding domain. The luciferase reporter construct containing five copies of the GAL4 DNA binding site (UAS) upstream from the c-fos minimal promoter (FR-luc) was obtained from Stratagene. Because luciferase activity derived from FR-luc was low, the BamHI/XbaI fragment containing five copies of UAS elements of FR-Luc was transferred to the BglII/NheI site of pTAL, and the resultant reporter was named pTAL-5× UAS (26Doi J.

After 48 h of transfection, cells were treated with or without forskolin (10 μm) or AICAR (2 mm) for 6 h and harvested to measure luciferase activities by the Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega Corp.). Specific promoter activities of PEPCK-C, CRE, CREB, or TORC2 genes were expressed as -fold expression compared with the reporter activity of the empty vector. Luciferase activities were measured and normalized by Renilla luciferase activity. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Generation of Recombinant Adenovirus—Ser-9 of the wild-type GSK3β construct was mutated to a glycine to generate the GSK3β-S9G mutant construct using site-directed mutagenesis. Template DNA (5 ng) was mixed with 20 pmol of each primer (GSK3β-S9G: forward primer, 5′-ACCACCGCCTTTGGCGAGAGCTG-3′; GSK3β-S9G reverse primer, 5′-CAGCTCTCGCCAAAGGCGGTGGT-3′), and the PCR was run (94 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 1 min; 68 °C, 5 min; 12 cycles). The product was transformed into DH5α competent Escherichia coli. Recombinant adenoviruses used to express wild-type GSK3β(WT) and constitutive active GSK3β(S9G) were constructed by homologous recombination of the expression cosmid cassettes containing the corresponding cDNAs and the parental virus genome, as described previously (27Sakoda H.

Adenoviral Gene Transfer—Recombinant adenovirus expressing wild-type and dominant negative mutant forms of AMPKα, wild-type GSK3β(WT), SIK1 and constitutive active GSK3β(S9G) were generated, purified, and concentrated using cesium chloride ultracentrifugation as reported previously (27Sakoda H.

In brief, HepG2 cells were lysed in lysis buffer as shown above. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant (cell lysate) was used for Western blotting and lipid content analysis. For Western blotting, 10 μg of protein were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes in a transfer buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with specific antibodies followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The antigen-antibody interactions were visualized by incubation with ECL chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitations—For the immunoprecipitation experiments, HepG2 cells were transfected with 1 μg of GST-tagged CREB. Whole-cell extracts were prepared from HepG2 cells in lysis buffer, as described above. Cell extracts were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with anti-GST antibody (5 μg) and then for 1 h with 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads. The pellets were washed 5 times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, then resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 3 min, and analyzed on SDS/8% polyacrylamide gels. AICAR Stimulation Increases the Phosphorylations of GSK3β and ACC in Mouse Liver—AICAR was intraperitoneally injected into fasted mice, and the Ser-9 phosphorylation level of hepatic GSK3β was monitored at the indicated times (Fig. 1). As reported previously, AICAR stimulation increased ACC phosphorylation (lowest panel of Fig. 1). Interestingly, GSK3β phosphorylation was also markedly increased by AICAR injection, whereas the level of GSK3β protein expression was unchanged in the livers of fasted mice. This increase took place within 15 min of injecting AICAR, peaked at 30 min, and persisted for 2 h. Thus, AICAR stimulation was revealed to enhance not only ACC but also GSK3β, probably more markedly than ACC. AMPK Activation Reduces Transcriptional Activities of PEPCK-C Gene Promoter and CRE—PEPCK-C regulation in vivo occurs mainly at the level of gene expression (28Lochhead P.A. Coghlan M. Rice S.Q.

Expression of the luciferase gene located downstream from the PEPCK-C gene promoter was markedly increased by forskolin in HepG2 cells, and this increase was suppressed by AICAR or insulin stimulation (Fig. 2A). Because the domain responsible for the forskolin-induced PEPCK-C up-regulation is reportedly that of CRE, we subsequently performed a luciferase assay using a plasmid containing the CRE domain upstream from the luciferase gene (Fig. 2B). Forskolin markedly enhanced CRE transcriptional activity, whereas AICAR almost completely abolished it, and the AMPK inhibitor Compound C had no effect. Interestingly, the GSK3β inhibitor SB415286 also very strongly inhibited the forskolin-induced increase in CRE activity (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, to confirm that the effect of AICAR is mediated by increased AMPK activity, the wild-type and dominant negative mutant of AMPK were overexpressed, employing adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. The overexpressed proteins were detected by immunoblotting (upper blot in the right panel of Fig. 2C). As predicted, AMPK overexpression increased ACC phosphorylation, whereas a dominant negative form suppressed it (lower blot in the right panel of Fig. 2C). Under these conditions, AMPK was revealed to suppress forskolin-induced CRE transcriptional activity (left panel of Fig. 2C). Contribution of CREB and TORC2 in the AMPK-, SIK1-, and GSK3β-mediated Suppression of CRE Activity—Because both AICAR and SB415286 repressed CRE-dependent reporter activity (Fig. 2B), we performed the experiments to determine which of these molecules (CREB or TORC2) is involved in the AICAR- and SB415286-induced suppression of the CRE transcriptional activity, using a GAL4-based transactivation assay system in HepG2 cells. Expression vectors encoding the DNA binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 fused to CREB were co-transfected with a GAL4-binding site (UAS)-driven luciferase reporter gene. To eliminate the interaction between the bZIP domain of CREB and the N-terminal coiled-coil region of TORC2, the transactivation domains of CREB and TORC2 were separated from the bZIP domain and the N-terminal coiled-coil region, respectively (upper diagram of Fig. 3, A and B). This allowed investigation of the transactivation potential of the transcription factor, independently of its DNA binding and endogenous background. As shown in Fig. 3A, the transcriptional activity of CREB was inhibited by both AICAR and SB415286, whereas that of TORC2 was repressed by AICAR significantly and by SB415286 slightly. These results suggested that AMPK might inhibit the activities of both CREB and TORC2, whereas GSK-3β might up-regulate the activity of only CREB. The zero effect of SB415286 on the level of phosphorylation of TORC2 (Fig. 4) might also support this hypothesis. On the other hand, TORC2 is known to be highly phosphorylated and inactivated by SIK1, a member of the AMPK family of Ser/Thr kinases. SIK1 phosphorylates TORC2 and blocks its nuclear accumulation (16Screaton R.A. Conkright M.D. Katoh Y. Best J.L. Canettieri G. Jeffries S. Guzman E. Niessen S. Yates III, J.R. Takemori H. Okamoto M. Montminy M. Cell. 2004; 119: 61-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Indeed, when SIK1 was overexpressed, the forskolin-induced increase in GAL4-TORC2 activity was completely abolished (Fig. 3B). In addition, TORC2 was strongly phosphorylated in adenovirus-expressing SIK1 (Ad-SIK1) cells (Fig. 4B). Thus, as shown with the GAL4-system and phosphorylation-dependent mobility shift of TORC2, CREB appears to be crucial for exerting the effects of SB415286 and AICAR, whereas TORC2 appears to be crucial for manifestation of the effects of AICAR stimulation and SIK overexpression. Phosphorylation of TORC2 and ACC by AMPK and SIK1—AMPK and SIK1 reportedly phosphorylate TORC2 (Ser-171), and phosphorylated TORC2 is transported from within the nucleus to the cytoplasm (12Koo S.H. Flechner L. Qi L. Zhang X. Screaton R.A. Jeffries S. Hedrick S. Xu W. Boussouar F. Brindle P. Takemori H. Montminy M. Nature. 2005; 437: 1109-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, endogenous hepatic TORC2 was markedly dephosphorylated upon stimulation with forskolin (lanes 1 and 2 of Fig. 4, A and B). Stimulation of hepatocytes with AICAR resulted in a slight shift in the mobility of TORC2, indicating phosphorylation (lanes 1 and 5 or lanes 2 and 6 of Fig. 4A and lanes 1 and 3 or lanes 2 and 4 of Fig. 4B), whereas stimulation with a GSK3β specific inhibitor, SB415286, did not produce a shift in response to the presence or absence of forskolin (lanes 3 and 4 of Fig. 4A). On the other hand, TORC2 was strongly phosphorylated in adenovirus-expressing SIK1 (Ad-SIK1) cells (bottom panel of Fig. 4B), i.e. more than with AICAR stimulation (lanes 5 and 6 of Fig. 4B). These results suggest that whereas AICAR stimulation induces TORC2 phosphorylation, SIK1 is likely to phosphorylate more serine residues than AMPK. In contrast, ACC was phosphorylated by AICAR but not by SIK1 (middle panel of Fig. 4B). Active Mutant of GSK3β Inhibits AICAR-induced Suppression of Transcriptional Activity of PEPCK-C Promoter—Phosphorylation of GSK3β on Ser-9 inhibits its catalytic activity. In examining whether AICAR-induced suppression of the PEPCK-C gene occurs via GSK3β phosphorylation, we created non-phosphorylatable, constitutively active mutants of the GSK3β(S9G) and GSK3β(WT) adenoviruses. Western blots of total extracts from infected cells treated for 48 h revealed marked overexpressions of GSK3β(S9G) and GSK3β(WT) compared with endogenously expressed GSK3β (upper panel of Fig. 5A). Furthermore, GSK3β(WT) was detected by antiphospho-Ser-9 GSK3β antibody, whereas GSK3β(S9G) was not (lower panel of Fig. 5A). HepG2 cells were incubated with 1.4 × 108 plaque-forming units/well (12-well plate) of adenovirus particles in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Infection of HepG2 cells with an adenovirus-expressing GSK3β produced a 10–20-fold increase. In control-LacZ-overexpressing HepG2 cells, forskolin enhances PEPCK-C promotor transcriptional activity, and co-stimulation with AICAR blunted this forskolin-induced increase (bars 1–4 of Fig. 5B). In wild-type GSK3β-overexpressing cells, although basal PEPCK-C transcriptional activity was increased as compared with that in LacZ-cells (bars 1 and 5 of Fig. 5B), responses to forskolin and AICAR were quite similar (bars 5–8 of Fig. 5B). However, in active mutant of GSK3β(S9G)-overexpressing cells, PEPCK-C promotor transcriptional activities under basal and AICAR-stimulated conditions were both significantly increased (bars 9–12 of Fig. 5B), as compared with that in wild-type GSK3β-overexpressing cells. In addition, it should be noted that AICAR-induced suppression of PEPCK-C promotor transcriptional activity was observed in wild-type GSK3β-overexpressing cells, but this effect was nearly abolished in the GSK3β(S9G)-overexpressing cells (bars 9 and 10 of Fig. 5B). Thus, it was revealed that expression of constitutively active GSK3β(S9G) enhanced PEPCK-C transcription in HepG2 cells, which suggests phosphorylation of Ser-9 of GSK3β is involved in the mechanism underlying AMPK or AICAR-induced PEPCK-C gene suppression. AMPK Increases GSK3β(Ser-9) Phosphorylation but Decreases CREB Phosphorylation (Ser-129) in HepG2 Cells—To test whether activators of AMPK have a regulatory influence on GSK3β, HepG2 cells were treated with the AMPK activator AICAR, and phosphorylations of CREB and GSK3β were measured using immunoblot analy"

https://openalex.org/W2009468857,"The bimolecular interaction between corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), a neuropeptide, and its type 1 receptor (CRFR1), a class B G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), is crucial for activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in response to stress, and has been a target of intense drug design for the treatment of anxiety, depression, and related disorders. As a class B GPCR, CRFR1 contains an N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) that provides the primary ligand binding determinants. Here we present three crystal structures of the human CRFR1 ECD, one in a ligand-free form and two in distinct CRF-bound states. The CRFR1 ECD adopts the α-β-βα fold observed for other class B GPCR ECDs, but the N-terminal α-helix is significantly shorter and does not contact CRF. CRF adopts a continuous α-helix that docks in a hydrophobic surface of the ECD that is distinct from the peptide-binding site of other class B GPCRs, thereby providing a basis for the specificity of ligand recognition between CRFR1 and other class B GPCRs. The binding of CRF is accompanied by clamp-like conformational changes of two loops of the receptor that anchor the CRF C terminus, including the C-terminal amide group. These structural studies provide a molecular framework for understanding peptide binding and specificity by the CRF receptors as well as a template for designing potent and selective CRFR1 antagonists for therapeutic applications."
https://openalex.org/W2089750042,"Mitochondrial NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) is the largest enzyme of the oxidative phosphorylation system, with subunits located at the matrix and membrane domains. In plants, holocomplex I is composed of more than 40 subunits, 9 of which are encoded by the mitochondrial genome (NAD subunits). In Nicotiana sylvestris, a minor 800-kDa subcomplex containing subunits of both domains and displaying NADH dehydrogenase activity is detectable. The NMS1 mutant lacking the membrane arm NAD4 subunit and the CMSII mutant lacking the peripheral NAD7 subunit are both devoid of the holoenzyme. In contrast to CMSII, the 800-kDa subcomplex is present in NMS1 mitochondria, indicating that it could represent an assembly intermediate lacking the distal part of the membrane arm. l-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase (GLDH), the last enzyme in the plant ascorbate biosynthesis pathway, is associated with the 800-kDa subcomplex but not with the holocomplex. To investigate possible relationships between GLDH and complex I assembly, we characterized an Arabidopsis thaliana gldh insertion mutant. Homozygous gldh mutant plants were not viable in the absence of ascorbate supplementation. Analysis of crude membrane extracts by blue native and two-dimensional SDS-PAGE showed that complex I accumulation was strongly prevented in leaves and roots of Atgldh plants, whereas other respiratory complexes were found in normal amounts.

In a number of organisms, complexes I, III, and IV have been shown to be associated in a super-complex called “respirasome” (1Schägger H. Biochim. Biophys.

The implications of this structural organization in terms of electron transport efficiency and/or complex assembly/stability are still under discussion (2Genova M.L. Baracca A. Biondi A. Casalena G.

Although only marginal amounts of “respirasomes” seem to be present in plant mitochondria, stable mt supercomplexes containing complex I (CI) and dimeric complex III have been described in several species (4Eubel H.

In most eukaryotes, complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase; EC 1.6.5.3) catalyzes the oxidation of NADH and couples the transfer of electrons to ubiquinone with the translocation of protons from the matrix compartment to the intermembrane space. Eukaryotic complex I (CI) is around 1,000 kDa in size and includes more than 40 subunits (8Brandt U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 69-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 9Carroll J.

Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 2003; 29: 380-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) are mt-encoded (named NAD in plants). Besides the subunits directly involved in NADH and ubiquinone binding and in electron transfer (Fe-S cluster bearing subunits) (11Hirst J. Carroll J. Fearnley I.M. Shannon R.J. Walker J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1604: 135-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), the function of most CI subunits is still unknown. They are distributed in two large domains, a matrix domain and a membrane domain containing highly hydrophobic polypeptides which, in animal and fungi, include all NAD subunits (12Walker J.E. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1992; 25: 253-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Although it shares more than 30 conserved subunits with all mt CI (13Gabaldon T. Rainey D. Huynen M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 857-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), the plant enzyme displays several peculiarities. First, the hydrophobic arm is unusually long and possesses specific protuberances (14Dudkina N.V. Eubel H. Keegstra W. Boekema E.J. Braun H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3225-3229Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Second, two subunits of the peripheral arm, NAD7 and NAD9, are mt-encoded. Third, the plant complexes have been reported to contain specific subunits, among which are three to five γ-carbonic anhydrase (γ-CA) or γ-CA-like isoforms (15Perales M. Eubel H. Heinemeyer J. Colaneri A. Zabaleta E. Braun H.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 350: 263-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 16Sunderhaus S. Dudkina N.V. Jansch L. Klodmann J. Heinemeyer J. Perales M. Zabaleta E.

Conklin P.L. Loewus F.A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 437-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 18Wheeler G.L. Jones M.A. Smirnoff N. Nature. 1998; 393: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Whereas γ-CA(like) isoforms have been demonstrated to be integral proteins of the CI membrane arm (16Sunderhaus S. Dudkina N.V.

Chem. 2006; 281: 6482-6488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), the exact localization of GLDH is still unclear, and the protein has been proposed to be associated with a minor low molecular mass complex in Arabidopsis cell cultures (19Heazlewood J.L. Howell K.A. Millar A.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1604: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). As for other plant organelle enzymes involved in electron transport chains that include subunits of dual origin, CI assembly is a multiple-step intricate process with many levels of regulation and requires protein assembly factors. Models of CI assembly have recently emerged in fungi, mammals, and the algal Chlamydomonas (20Vogel R.O. Smeitink J.A. Nijtmans L.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 1215-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), but little information is currently available in land plants, because of the scarcity of respiratory mutants. In this study, we give new insights on the composition of CI assembly intermediates in plants, and we re-evaluate the association of GLDH with this complex by genetic and biochemical approaches using Nicotiana sylvestris and Arabidopsis thaliana mutants. The N. sylvestris CMSII mtDNA mutant, devoid of the mt nad7 gene (21Pla M. Mathieu C. De Paepe R. Chétrit P. Vedel F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and the nuclear NMS1 mutant, impaired in the processing of the mt nad4 transcript (22Brangeon J. Sabar M. Gutierres S. Combettes B. Bove J. Gendy C. Chétrit P. Des Francs-Small C.C. Pla M. Vedel F. De Paepe R. Plant J. 2000; 21: 269-280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), lack significant CI activity (23Gutierres S. Sabar M. Lelandais C. Chétrit P. Diolez P. Degand H. Boutry M. Vedel F. de Kouchkovsky Y. De Paepe R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Both holo-CI and a minor complex, around 800 kDa in size, were previously shown by blue native analyses to be absent in CMSII mt membranes (7Pineau B. Mathieu C. Gerard-Hirne C. De Paepe R. Chetrit P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25994-26001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Here we show that although holo-CI is similarly lacking in NMS1, the 800-kDa complex is present, indicating that it could be an assembly intermediate. GLDH was bound to the subcomplex only. To further evaluate possible relationships between GLDH and CI content, we characterized an Arabidopsis mutant interrupted in the GLDH gene. Homozygous Atgldh plants developed only when supplemented with ascorbate, and they were impaired in CI content, whereas other respiratory complexes were in normal amounts. These results show that GLDH expression is necessary for CI accumulation in plants. N. sylvestris plants were grown in soil, in a greenhouse under a 16-h photoperiod, at a day/night temperature regime of 23/17 °C, and under natural illumination supplemented with artificial lighting when necessary to maintain a minimum of 200 μmol m-2 s-1 at the leaf surface. Arabidopsis seeds of the SALK_060087 line carrying a T-DNA insertion in the At3g47930 gene were obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis stock center (25Alonso J.M. Stepanova A.N. Leisse T.J.

Seeds were sterilized and sown under aseptic conditions on agar plates containing Gamborg B5 salt and vitamins, supplemented with 0.5% sucrose. The plated seeds were kept at 4 °C for 5 days, and transferred to an illuminated, temperature-controlled growth chamber. Plants were grown at 20 °C under a 16-h day/8-h night photoperiod of white light (∼80 μmol m-2 s-1). RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was prepared, using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA (1 μg) was treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI) and reverse-transcribed using random hexamers and SUPERSCRIPT™ III first-strand kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommendations. The expression levels of At3g47930 (GLDH) and At3g13920 (TIF4A1) were determined, using the following primers: GLDH-5.2, TCGAAGTAAGAGCCCCATTAG; GLDH-3.2, TAAGCAGTGGTGGAGACTGG; TIF4A-5,: AGTCTCCCTGGTTATCAACTTC; and TIF4A-3, CGACTTCTTTTCTCCCTTCAC. Preparation of Mitochondria of N. sylvestris Leaves—Mitochondria were purified from 100 g of homogenized leaves by differential centrifugation and gradient centrifugation using two layers of 26 and 46% Percoll in 0.5 m mannitol, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (7Pineau B.

Mitochondria were washed in 0.5 m mannitol, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, and aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C when not used immediately. Preparation of Crude Membrane Extracts from A. thaliana Leaves and Roots—Two-hundred mg of plant material were harvested and briefly pound at 0 °C, in a conical glass homogenizer in 2 ml of 75 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.6, 0.6 m sucrose, 4 mm EDTA, 0.2% polyvinylpyrrolidone 40, 8 mm cysteine, 0.2% bovine serum albumin (26Bartoli C.G. Yu J. Gomez F. Fernandez L. McIntosh L. Foyer C.H. J. Exp. Bot. 2006; 57: 1621-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The lysate was filtrated across one layer of miracloth and centrifuged first at 1300 × g for 4 min and the supernatant at 22,000 × g for 20 min. The resultant sediment, which contained most of the thylakoid and mt membranes, was resuspended in 200 μl of 10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, 0.3 m sucrose. Electrophoretic Analyses—N. sylvestris mt suspensions (200 μg) were washed in water and resuspended in 50 μl of 10% sucrose, 50 mm BisTris, pH 7, 0.5 m aminocaproic acid, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 μm Pefabloc SC. mt membranes were solubilized by addition of dodecyl maltoside (to 1%) or digitonin (to 2%). After centrifugation the supernatant was supplemented by blue G-250 (detergent/blue G-250 ratio of 8). Crude Arabidopsis membranes suspensions were washed with 600 μl of water, sedimented at 22,000 × g for 20 min, and resuspended in 150 μl of 50 mm BisTris/HCl, pH 7, 0.5 m 6-aminohexanoic acid, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3 m sucrose, and 0.5 mm Pefabloc SC. After addition of 30 μl of 10% β-dodecyl maltoside or 60 μl of 10% digitonin at 4 °C for 15–30 min, respectively, samples were centrifuged at 22,000 × g for 8 min. The supernatants were supplemented with 8 or 16 μl of 5% Coomassie Blue G-250 (prepared in 0.020 m BisTris/HCl, 0.5 m 6-aminohexanoic acid) and an aliquot equivalent to 12 mg (leaves) or 20 mg (roots) of fresh weight material were loaded to each lane of a BN gel. Protein complexes from N. sylvestris mt membranes or from Arabidopsis crude membrane extracts were separated by BN-PAGE using 4–13 or 3.6–12% gradient acrylamide gels in Bis-Tris buffer as described previously (7Pineau B.

For analysis of crude membrane extracts, the gel buffer consisted of 0.05 m BisTris, 0.5 m 6-aminohexanoic acid, pH 7, 0.01% detergent and the cathode buffer contained 0.005% Blue G-250 and 0.01% detergent. Two-dimensional BN/SDS electrophoresis was performed as described previously (7Pineau B. Mathieu C. Gerard-Hirne C. De Paepe R. Chetrit P. J. Biol.

After electrophoresis the proteins were silver-stained (29Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3722) Google Scholar). Determination of In-gel Enzymatic Activities—After BN-PAGE, the NADH dehydrogenase activity of CI was revealed by incubation of the gel in the presence of 1 mm nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) and 0.2 mm NADH in 0.05 m MOPS, pH 7.6 (29Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3722) Google Scholar), after washing for 20 min in 0.1 m MOPS, pH 7.6. The cytochrome oxidase activity was revealed after washing the gel in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, by incubation in the same buffer but containing 0.22 m saccharose, 0.5 mg/ml bovine heart cytochrome c, 0.5 mg/ml 3.3′-diaminobenzidine, and 24 units/ml catalase (30Zerbetto E.

Immunodetection Analyses—Gels were first electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a semi-dry method in 50 mm Tricine, 15 mm BisTris at 0.8 mA/cm2 for 1.5 h. Membranes were incubated with antibodies against galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase (31Bartoli C.G. Gomez F. Gergoff G. Guiamet J.J. Puntarulo S. J. Exp. Bot. 2005; 56: 1269-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) or against the C-terminal part of Arabidopsis γ-carbonic anhydrase (At1g47260) (15Perales M. Eubel H. Heinemeyer J. Colaneri A. Zabaleta E. Braun H.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 350: 263-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies were coupled to horseradish peroxidase, and detection was with nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma) (BN-PAGE) or with ECL (Amersham Biosciences) (two-dimensional BN/SDS-PAGE). Presence of a Discrete 800-kDa CI Subcomplex Containing GLDH in the N. sylvestris NMS1 Mutant—As reported previously for CMSII (7Pineau B. Mathieu C. Gerard-Hirne C. De Paepe R. Chetrit P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25994-26001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), no signal around 1,000 kDa, corresponding to the CI molecular mass, could be detected in BN-PAGE profiles of dodecyl maltoside-solubilized NMS1 mt membranes (Fig. 1A), whereas complexes III (around 500 kDa) and V (around 600 kDa) were readily visible. Similarly, the major NADH/NBT signal revealing NADH dehydrogenase activity was lacking in NMS1 (Fig. 1A). However, a weak NADH/NBT signal around 800 kDa was present in NMS1 as in the WT (Fig. 1A), suggesting the presence of a minor CI subcomplex in both lines. The polypeptide composition of the mt complexes was resolved by two-dimensional BN/SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). In the WT, the 1,000- and 800-kDa CI complexes shared many subunits, including the previously characterized 75-kDa subunit, belonging to the NADH dehydrogenase module (8Brandt U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 69-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) as well as NAD7 (7Pineau B. Mathieu C. Gerard-Hirne C. De Paepe R. Chetrit P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25994-26001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In NMS1, these polypeptides were associated with the 800-kDa subcomplex only (Fig. 1B), in good agreement with its NADH dehydrogenase activity (Fig. 1A). The composition of the subcomplex was further investigated by immunological studies. Using anti-γ-CA antibodies, a major signal at 1,000 kDa was observed in the WT profile only. In addition, a weak signal was observed in both WT and NMS1 profiles at around 800 kDa (Fig. 1C), indicating that the subcomplex contains a part of the membrane arm. In contrast, no signal was seen at the level of holo-CI in the WT profiles using antibodies raised against GLDH (Fig. 2A). Likewise no signal was detected either at the level of CI or at the level of the supercomplex I–III when mt membrane proteins were solubilized by digitonin (Fig. 2A), a treatment that preserves CI/CIII association (5Eubel H. Jansch L. Braun H.P. Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 7Pineau B. Mathieu C. Gerard-Hirne C. De Paepe R. Chetrit P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25994-26001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, a clear signal was observed below CI in WT and NMS1 only, at the same mobility as the 800-kDa subcomplex characterized by in-gel NADH/NBT staining. A second signal was detected around 500 kDa (Fig. 2A). In addition, a diffuse band above the position of CI appeared only in WT profiles, although some discrete bands were detectable below the 500-kDa band in all profiles. Two-dimensional BN/SDS-PAGE showed that both 800- and 500-kDa immunosignals were associated with a polypeptide of about 60 kDa (Fig. 2B), in good agreement with the GLDH molecular mass (32Bartoli C.G. Pastori G.M. Foyer C.H. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Whether the 500-kDa signal represents a still unidentified low molecular weight CI subcomplex, devoid of the NADH-oxidizing module, remains to be determined. These results show that GLDH is not associated with holo-CI in N. sylvestris but to a subcomplex accumulating both in the WT and in the NAD4-deficient NMS1 mutant, but not in the NAD7-deficient CMSII mutant. Complex I Accumulation Is Impaired in an A. thaliana gldh Mutant—A possible implication of GLDH in CI formation was further investigated by examining the accumulation of respiratory complexes in an A. thaliana gldh insertion mutant. The Arabidopsis nuclear genome contains a single GLDH gene (At3g47930) (33Leferink N.G. van den Berg W.A. van Berkel W.J. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and the SALK_060087 line was identified as a putative mutant containing a T-DNA insertion within this gene. SALK_060087 seeds were germinated in vitro on gelose medium, and roughly a quarter (22.2%) of them (as expected from a single and recessive mutation) exhibited a delayed germination, developed chlorotic cotyledons (Fig. 3A), and ultimately died at the cotyledon stage. However, all the chlorotic seedlings could be rescued by 10 mm ascorbate supplementation (Fig. 3B). PCR amplification using gldh internal and T-DNA left border primers showed these plants to be indeed homozygous for the T-DNA insertion in the last intron of the gldh gene (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). In the offspring of heterozygous gldh/GLDH plants, ascorbate-dependent plantlets were selected and checked for the genotype and GLDH expression. No GLDH transcript could be detected by semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR (supplemental Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results indicate that these plantlets are homozygous gldh mutants, deficient in ascorbate synthesis. A protocol was developed to determine the composition of mt complexes from minute amounts of material without previous mt purification (see under “Experimental Procedures”). Dodecyl maltoside- or digitonin-solubilized proteins from leaf or root crude membrane extracts were resolved by BN-PAGE and BN/SDS-PAGE. In one-dimensional BN-profiles of leaves, main bands represented complexes originating from thylakoid membranes, which were identifiable from their constitutive spots appearing in the second dimension (Fig. 4, A and B), in agreement with the previous reports of proteomic investigation of plant photosystems (34Ciambella C. Roepstorff P. Aro E.M. Zolla L. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 746-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 35Heinemeyer J. Eubel H. Wehmhoner D. Jansch L. Braun H.P. Phytochemistry. 2004; 65: 1683-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The presence of mt CI was clearly revealed by in-gel NADH/NBT staining of the BN profiles from dodecyl maltoside-solubilized proteins of Col-0 leaf membrane extracts (Fig. 4A), whereas no significant NADH/NBT staining at 1,000 kDa could be detected in gldh leaf extracts. Similarly, NADH/NBT staining was seen at the levels of CI (1,000 kDa) and supercomplex I–III (1,500 kDa) in the profiles of digitonin-solubilized proteins from Col-0 leaf membrane extract (Fig. 4B) but not in profiles of gldh extract. In contrast, cytochrome oxidase in-gel staining gave identical responses in Col-0 and gldh mutant (Fig. 4B). The two-dimensional BN/SDS-PAGE profiles from dodecyl maltoside-solubilized proteins of Col-0 and gldh leaf extracts were comparable, and similar amounts of spots originating from the mt complexes III and V on both sides of PSI were detected (Fig. 4C). The extracts contained several major or minor complexes having their mobility close to that of CI, as PSII-LHCII, or vacuolar ATPase, a known contaminant of N. sylvestris (Fig. 1, B and C) or Neurospora crassa mt preparations (36Marques I. Dencher N.A. Videira A. Krause F. Eukaryot. Cell. 2007; 6: 2391-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus only the 75-kDa spot seen above the PSII-LHCII trace represents an unambiguous marker for CI. It was seen in the Col-0 but not in the gldh two-dimensional profiles (Fig. 4C) in good agreement with the data of NADH/NBT stain obtained following the first dimension. The results obtained from leaf extracts were confirmed by analyses of root extracts. Spots originated from dodecyl maltoside-solubilized proteins of Col-0, and gldh mt membranes represent main spots on two-dimensional profiles (Fig. 4D) fitting well with the profiles obtained from mt preparations of N. sylvestris leaves (Fig. 1). Comparable amounts of spots derived from complexes III and V were observed in the profiles of both lines, whereas spots derived from CI were lacking in the gldh mutant. Because this deficiency could not be explained by a decrease of mt membranes in the sample as shown by the comparable levels of complexes III, IV, and V, these results indicated that CI is lacking in gldh plants. As in other organisms, the elucidation of complex I assembly in plants depends on the availability of mutants of either peripheral or membrane domains. Here we bring new insights to this process using available N. sylvestris mutants, the CMSII mutant lacking the peripheral NAD7 subunit (21Pla M. Mathieu C. De Paepe R. Chétrit P. Vedel F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and the NMS1 mutant lacking the membrane NAD4 subunit (22Brangeon J. Sabar M. Gutierres S. Combettes B. Bove J. Gendy C. Chétrit P. Des Francs-Small C.C. Pla M. Vedel F. De Paepe R. Plant J. 2000; 21: 269-280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as a newly characterized A. thaliana gldh mutant. Atgldh seedlings did not develop beyond the cotyledon stage in the absence of ascorbate supplementation, confirming that GLDH activity is an obligatory step in the guanosine diphosphate mannose pathway for ascorbate biosynthesis in plants (17Smirnoff N. Conklin P.L. Loewus F.A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 437-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 18Wheeler G.L. Jones M.A. Smirnoff N. Nature. 1998; 393: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). A strict ascorbate requirement has already been shown for the development of Arabidopsis mutants impaired in the synthesis of GDP-l-galactose phosphorylase, an enzyme involved upstream in the ascorbate biosynthesis pathway in plants (37Dowdle J. Ishikawa T. Gatzek S. Rolinski S. Smirnoff N. Plant J. 2007; 52: 673-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). However, if ascorbate supplementation to gldh plants allowed greening and development, their growth rate remained very low. Reduced growth rates were also observed in antisense gldh tomato plants (38Alhagdow M. Mounet F. Gilbert L. Nunes-Nesi A. Garcia V. Just D. Petit J. Beauvoit B. Fernie A.R. Rothan C. Baldet P. Plant Physiol. 2007; 145: 1408-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Holo-CI could not be detected in leaf mt membranes of the N. sylvestris NMS1 mutant lacking the membrane NAD4 subunit, as is the case in the CMSII mutant devoid of the peripheral NAD7 subunit (7Pineau B. Mathieu C. Gerard-Hirne C. De Paepe R. Chetrit P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25994-26001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to CMSII, a minor 800-kDa form previously observed in the WT (7Pineau B. Mathieu C. Gerard-Hirne C. De Paepe R. Chetrit P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25994-26001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) was detected in NMS1. This subcomplex contains subunits characteristic of the peripheral domain (e.g. NAD7 and the 75-kDa component of the dehydrogenase module) and displays in-gel NADH dehydrogenase activity (Fig. 1). The presence of this subcomplex in NMS1 mitochondria despite the lack of holo-CI indicates that it is probably an assembly intermediate and not a degradation product. Existence of a subcomplex comprising matricial subunits has been previously reported in the maize NAD4-deficient NCS2 mutant (39Karpova O.V. Newton K.J. Plant J. 1999; 17: 511-521Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, the presence in the N. sylvestris subcomplex of the γ-CA subunit, an integral membrane subunit of plant CI (16Sunderhaus S. Dudkina N.V. Jansch L. Klodmann J. Heinemeyer J. Perales M. Zabaleta E. Boekema E.J. Braun H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6482-6488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), shows that it also contains a part of the membrane arm. In contrast to γ-CA, GLDH, the enzyme catalyzing the last step in ascorbate synthesis (17Smirnoff N. Conklin P.L. Loewus F.A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 437-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), was only associated with an 800-kDa subcomplex and not with the holo-CI in N. sylvestris mitochondria. Ascorbate synthesis carried out by the sub-CI-bound GLDH form of N. sylvestris leaves is not essential, as previously suggested for the low molecular mass CI of Arabidopsis cell cultures (40Millar A.H. Mittova V. Kiddle G. Heazlewood J.L. Bartoli C.G. Theodoulou F.L. Foyer C.H. Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), because ascorbate levels are not markedly altered in the CMSII mutant lacking this subcomplex (41Dutilleul C. Garmier M. Noctor G. Mathieu C. Chetrit P. Foyer C.H. de Paepe R. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 1212-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 42Vidal G. Ribas-Carbo M. Garmier M. Dubertret G. Rasmusson A.G. Mathieu C. Foyer C.H. De Paepe R. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 640-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Interestingly, GLDH was also associated with a 500-kDa mt complex (Fig. 2), but whether it corresponds to a CI assembly intermediate remains to be shown. Taken together, these results support the following model for the CI assembly process in plants: the peripheral arm including the N and Q modules (8Brandt U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 69-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) would bind to a large membrane segment, resulting in an assembly intermediate around 800 kDa that includes GLDH. The formation of mature CI would require the elimination of GLDH and the addition of a set of subunits, including NAD4, the analogous subunit (NUOM) being located at the tip of the membrane arm in Escherichia coli (43Baranova E.A. Holt P.J. Sazanov L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 140-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Similarly, the 700-kDa subcomplex that accumulates in a Chlamydomonas reinhardtii NAD4-deficient mutant includes subunits of both the matrix and the membrane arm, but it is devoid of ND5, located in the membrane arm tip (44Cardol P. Matagne R.F. Remacle C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This 700-kDa subcomplex in the C. reinhardtii ND5-deficient mutant is deprived of a set of subunits located at the distal domain of the CI membrane arm (45Cardol P. Boutaffala L. Memmi S. Devreese B. Matagne R.F. Remacle C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Lack of the membrane arm distal segment does not prevent the integration of γ-CA into the CI subcomplex of either N. sylvestris NAD4-deficient (this work) or C. reinhardtii NAD5-deficient mutants (45Cardol P. Boutaffala L. Memmi S. Devreese B. Matagne R.F. Remacle C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The subcomplexes accumulating in Chlamydomonas have been proposed to be assembly intermediates (44Cardol P. Matagne R.F. Remacle C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and the analysis of N. sylvestris mutants strongly supports common points between the late steps of plant and C. reinhardtii CI assembly processes. Alternatively, it can be hypothesized that fixation of GLDH to the assembly intermediate impairs further attachment of the distal membrane domain, and therefore the holoenzyme can only derive from a GLDH-free subcomplex and the presence of NAD4. In this hypothesis, the GLDH-associated subcomplex would not be a productive intermediate. However, such a model is not supported by the study of the Atgldh insertion mutant, which shows that the absence of GLDH expression inhibits the accumulation of the holoenzyme. Indeed, complex I and its associated NADH dehydrogenase activity were lacking in Atgldh leaf and root membranes, although the other respiratory complexes were unaffected. Lack of complex I in the gldh mutant demonstrates that GLDH is involved in the process leading to the formation of CI, although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. GLDH may be involved in the synthesis/stability of individual subunits and/or assembly intermediates. To date, no plant CI assembly factors have been characterized. In fungi and mammals, several protein factors associated with high molecular weight CI subcomplexes but not with the holoenzyme have been shown to be directly involved in the CI assembly process. In N. crassa, CIA30 and CIA84, two proteins that do not belong to the mature holoenzyme, were shown to be associated with a large membrane segment accumulating in the nuo21 mutant unable to assemble holo-CI (46Küffner R. Rohr A. Schmiede A. Krull C. Schulte U. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Disruption of CIA genes resulted in the inability to form the membrane segment. Recent studies of human CI assembly have led to the characterization of discrete subassembly complexes (most of them in the range of 800 and 450–500 kDa) and the identification of at least three different assembly factors, B17.2L (47Lazarou M.

The deficiency of each of these three factors leads to a severe reduction in human CI levels and activity. Although further biochemical studies are needed to elucidate the kinetic steps of the CI assembly process, our results demonstrate the dual function of GLDH in plants, i.e. ascorbate synthesis and holocomplex I accumulation.

https://openalex.org/W2121740193,"Gangliosides are particularly abundant in the central nervous system (CNS) and thought to play important roles in memory formation, neuritogenesis, synaptic transmission, and other neural functions. Although several molecular species of gangliosides have been characterized and their individual functions elucidated, their differential distribution in the CNS are not well understood. In particular, whether the different molecular species show different distribution patterns in the brain remains unclear. We report the distinct and characteristic distributions of ganglioside molecular species, as revealed by imaging mass spectrometry (IMS). This technique can discriminate the molecular species, raised from both oligosaccharide and ceramide structure by determining the difference of the mass-to-charge ratio, and structural analysis by tandem mass spectrometry. Gangliosides in the CNS are characterized by the structure of the long-chain base (LCB) in the ceramide moiety. The LCB of the main ganglioside species has either 18 or 20 carbons (i.e., C18- or C20-sphingosine); we found that these 2 types of gangliosides are differentially distributed in the mouse brain. While the C18-species was widely distributed throughout the frontal brain, the C20-species selectively localized along the entorhinal-hippocampus projections, especially in the molecular layer (ML) of the dentate gyrus (DG). We revealed development- and aging-related accumulation of the C-20 species in the ML-DG. Thus it is possible to consider that this brain-region specific regulation of LCB chain length is particularly important for the distinct function in cells of CNS."

Furthermore, our functional LDLR assays and small hairpin RNA studies show that AnxA2 and the AnxA2·p11 complex could prevent PCSK9-directed LDLR degradation in HuH7, HepG2, and Chinese hamster ovary cells. Immunocytochemistry revealed that PCSK9 and AnxA2 co-localize at the cell surface, indicating a possible competition with the LDLR.

Following autocatalytic cleavage, PCSK9 exits the endoplasmic reticulum complexed with its prosegment and is efficiently secreted (1Seidah N.G. Benjannet S. Wickham L. Marcinkiewicz J. Jasmin S.B.

This secreted form can be internalized into endosomes via cell surface binding in an LDLR-dependent manner (14Nassoury N. Blasiole D.A. Tebon O.A. Benjannet S. Hamelin J. Poupon V. McPherson P.S.

It was also demonstrated that the C-terminal Cys-His-rich domain (CHRD) and the prosegment of PCSK9 are critical for the co-localization of PCSK9 and the LDLR (14Nassoury N. Blasiole D.A. Tebon O.A.

This intriguing twist in the function of this convertase is supported by the crystal structure of PCSK9, which revealed an extended tight binding complex of the enzyme and its inhibitory prosegment (21Cunningham D.

Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), leading to its degradation by resident hydrolases. The wide interest in developing a specific PCSK9 inhibitor/silencer led to the proposal of multiple approaches. One of these depends on the identification of inhibitors/modulators of the PCSK9-LDLR interaction (23Kwon H.J. Lagace T.A. McNutt M.C. Horton J.D. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 1820-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). However, focusing only on the site of the PCSK9-LDLR interaction may be too restrictive. Indeed, natural point mutations of PCSK9 in remote domains also result in either hyper- or hypo-cholesterolemia (11Seidah N.G. Prat A. J. Mol. Med. 2007; 85: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), even though they are not implicated in the direct interaction of the catalytic domain with the LDLR/epidermal growth factor-like domain A (23Kwon H.J.

These include the hypercholesterolemic mutants S127R (prosegment) and H553R (CHRD) as well as the hypocholesterolemic variants R46L (prosegment) and Q554E (CHRD), resulting in gain or loss of function of PCSK9, respectively (7Abifadel M.

It was therefore possible that endogenous modulators of PCSK9 function on LDLR may exist, which could specifically interact with the prosegment, the catalytic domain, or the CHRD. Accordingly, we set up a Far Western screen to identify such a modulator(s) in cell line extracts. Our extended analysis revealed that such a protein does exist in certain cells and that it interacts specifically with the CHRD, resulting in a loss of function, i.e. decreased ability of PCSK9 to enhance the degradation of LDLR. Herein, we describe the identification and properties of this endogenous PCSK9 modulator, as well as its domain that interacts with the CHRD. Expression Constructs—Human PCSK9 and mutant cDNAs and domains thereof were cloned, with or without a C-terminal V5 tag, into pIRES2-EGFP vector (Clontech) as previously described (3Benjannet S.

The cDNA encoding for p11-YFP was kindly provided by Dr Volker Gerke (Institute of Medical Biochemistry, University of Muenster, Germany). Wild type human annexin A2 (AnxA2) (ATCC MGC-2257) and annexin A1 (AnxA1) (ATCC MGC-5095) were purchased from ATCC and subcloned into NheI/SacI-digested pIRES2-EGFP vector. An HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) was fused by PCR mutagenesis at the C terminus of both AnxA1 and AnxA2. All of the oligonucleotides used in the various AnxA2 constructions are listed in supplemental Table S1. Two-steps PCRs were performed on AnxA2 cDNA to introduce point mutations (77RRTKK → AATAK; 77RRTKK → AATAA; 77RRTKKELASALK → 77AATAAELASALA; and 80KKELA → GKPLD) or amino acid (aa) deletions (Δ2–24, aa 2–24; ΔR1, aa 37–108; ΔR2, aa 109–192; ΔR3, aa 193–268; and ΔR4, aa 269–339) into pIRES2-AnxA2-EGFP vector (supplemental Table S1). In addition, using PCR, the AnxA2 segment aa 49–75 was swapped with the corresponding AnxA1 segment aa 58–84 (AnxA2 (aa 49–75) > AnxA1 (aa 58–84)). Purified PCR fragments were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and subcloned into the corresponding digested pIRES2-AnxA2-HA-EGFP vector. All of the final cDNA constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. RNA Interference—To silence human AnxA2, a 29-mer pRS-shRNA was used: (sh3, GCATCAGCACTGAAGTCAGCCTTATCTGG) (Origene). The control pRS-shGFP vector (shCtl) contained a noneffective 29-mer shGFP cassette. Quantitative Real Time PCR—Quantitative real time PCR analysis of RNA preparations was performed as previously described (13Zaid A. Roubtsova A. Essalmani R. Marcinkiewicz J. Chamberland A.

Briefly, each cDNA sample was submitted to two PCR amplifications: one for normalizing the ribosomal-S protein gene (S14 for human and S16 for mouse cDNAs) and the other for the gene of interest, each in triplicate. The Mx3500P system from Stratagene was used to perform and analyze the quantitative real time PCRs, using S14 or S16 amplifications as normalizers (28Dubuc G. Chamberland A. Wassef H. Davignon J.

Cell Culture and Transfections—HepG2, HuH7, COS-1, BSC40, and HEK293 cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), whereas CHO-K1 and CHO-K1 mutant Pgsd-677 cells that lack heparan sulfate proteoglycans (29Mayer G. Hamelin J. Asselin M.C. Pasquato A. Marcinkiewicz E. Tang M. Tabibzadeh S. Seidah N.G. J. Biol.

Y1 mouse adrenal cells were grown in F12K medium with 15% horse serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum. All of the cells were maintained at 37 °C under 5% CO2. At 80–90% confluence, HuH7 and CHO-K1 cells were transiently transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), HEK293 cells were transfected with Effectene (Qiagen), and HepG2 cells were transfected with FuGENE HD (Roche Applied Science). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were washed and incubated in serum-free medium, containing or not exogenous conditioned medium and/or purified proteins, as indicated in the figure legends, for an additional 20 h before medium collection and cell lysis. For analysis of the various AnxA2 mutants in HEK293 cells, 24 h post-transfection the cells were washed and then incubated for another 24 h in complete medium containing 50 μm of the proteasome inhibitor acetyl-Leu-Leu-Norleucinal (Calbiochem). Stable transfectants of shRNA-AnxA2 were obtained in HuH7 cells following puromycin selection. Antibodies and Purified Proteins—The rabbit polyclonal antibody against PCSK9 was raised in-house as described (14Nassoury N. Blasiole D.A. Tebon O.A. Benjannet S. Hamelin J. Poupon V. McPherson P.S. Attie A.D. Prat A. Seidah N.G. Traffic. 2007; 8: 718-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Other antibodies used were a rabbit polyclonal V5-antibody (Sigma), an unconjugated or horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated mouse monoclonal anti-V5 (mAb V5 or mAb V5-HRP; Invitrogen), goat anti-LDLR (human) (R & D Systems), HRP-conjugated mouse anti-His (Qiagen), anti-HA (Roche Applied Science), monoclonal anti-HA-Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen), and mouse anti-AnxA2 (human) (BD Biosciences). Purified CHRD-His was produced in-house, purified PCSK9-His6 was a kind gift from Bristol-Myers Squibb, and purified AnxA2-His6 and AnxA1-His6 were purchased from EMD Biosciences. Cell Lysis and Subcellular Fractionation—Mouse tissues and cells were lysed in ice cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). For crude membrane preparations and subcellular fractionation, COS-1 cells were homogenized in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 200 mm sucrose, and a protease inhibitor mixture. The homogenate was centrifuged at 720 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and cell debris. The resulting supernatant S1 was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet P1, containing organelles such as lysosomes and mitochondria, was solubilized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and the supernatant S2 was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 75 min at 4 °C (SW40 rotor and Beckman ultracentrifuge). The resulting crude P2 cell membrane pellet was solubilized in radioimmune precipitation assay, and the soluble supernatant S3 was kept for Far Western blot analysis. Quantitation of protein concentration was effected by the Bradford protein assay. The supernatant S3 (3 μg of protein) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and compared with 30-μg protein loads from other subcellular fractions. Far Western Blot Assays—Lysates (20–30 μg of protein), media, or purified AnxA2-His6 were heated in reducing or nonreducing Laemmli sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE on 8% glycine gels, and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare). Following 1 h of incubation in 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween (TBST), the membranes where incubated with conditioned medium of CHO-K1 cells overexpressing either an empty vector (pIRES-V5), PC5A-V5, CHRD-V5, pIRES-D374Y, PCSK9-V5, or its V5-tagged mutants or incubated with purified AnxA2-His6 for 3 h at room temperature. The membranes were then washed in TBST and incubated with the HRP-conjugated anti-V5 or anti-His antibodies and revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare). For competition experiments, 10 μg of His-tagged PCSK9 or CHRD were added to the PCSK9-V5 medium before Far Western blotting. For PCSK9 binding requirements with the ∼33-kDa protein, 1 m NaCl, 10 mg/ml heparin, 1 m NaCl + 10 mg/ml heparin, or 100 mm EDTA were added to the PCSK9-V5 conditioned medium used for Far Western blotting. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Assays—For immunoprecipitation cell lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-V5-agarose beads (Sigma) and washed five times with cold lysis buffer. Following addition of reducing Laemmli sample, solubilized proteins were revealed by Western blot or separated by SDS-PAGE (8%) and stained by Coomassie Blue for band excision and mass spectrometry. As control for the immunoprecipitation, antigens complexed with the anti-V5-agarose beads were eluted with the V5 peptide (50 μm, Sigma), separated by SDS-PAGE (8%), and revealed by Western blotting with the anti-V5-HRP antibody. Western blotting experiments were made on samples that were reduced in Laemmli buffer, heated, and resolved on 8% glycine SDS-PAGE gels. Separated proteins were then electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose and probed with HRP-conjugated anti-V5 or anti-HA tags or with primary antibodies. Bound primary antibodies were detected with corresponding species-specific HRP-labeled secondary antibodies and revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Quantitation of band intensity was done with the ImageJ software version 1.37 (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis and Mass Spectrometry—Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed according to protocols from Ref. 30Gorg A. Obermaier C. Boguth G. Harder A. Scheibe B. Wildgruber R. Weiss W. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 1037-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar. COS-1 cells were lysed in 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% CHAPS, 0.5% immobilized pH gradient (IPG) buffer (carrier ampholyte mixture; GE Healthcare), and 0.002% bromphenol blue. The protein concentration was estimated by the Bradford assay and adjusted to 0.6 μg/ml with the lysis buffer. 40 mm dithiothreitol was then added, and the cell lysates were kept rotating at 4 °C for 60 min. The samples (200 μl) were loaded onto broad pH range (pH 3–10) IPG gel strips (GE Healthcare), and the first dimension isolelectric focusing separation was achieved using an Ettan IPGphor II system (GE Healthcare). For the second dimension SDS-PAGE separation, IPG strips were equilibrated for 15 min in the SDS equilibration buffer (6 m urea, 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 29.3% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.002% bromphenol blue) containing 10 mg/ml dithiothreitol and an additional 15 min in the SDS equilibration buffer containing 25 mg/ml iodoacetamide and applied to 12% SDS gels. The gels were then either stained in Coomassie Blue or transferred on nitrocellulose and processed for Far Western blotting with PCSK9-V5. The signal obtained at ∼33 kDa in the Far Western blot was used to establish the position of the band to be excised for mass spectrometry analysis. For protein identification by liquid chromatography-MS/MS, the bands or spots of interest were cut out from the gel and digested with trypsin (0.1 μg) for 60 min at 58 °C. The peptides were extracted from the gel at room temperature, and the supernatants were transferred into a 96-well plate and then completely dried in a vacuum centrifuge. Before the analysis, the peptides were dissolved under agitation for 15 min in 13 μl of formic acid 0.1%, then sonicated for 5 min, and centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 1 min. Analysis of the peptide mixture was done by liquid chromatography-MS/MS using a LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer configured with an on-line NanoLC-two-dimensional high performance liquid chromatography system (Eksigent, Dublin, CA). Protein identification was obtained from the MS/MS spectra using Mascot analysis software (Matrix Science).

https://openalex.org/W2038028931,"The mandatory integration of the reverse-transcribed HIV-1 genome into host chromatin is catalyzed by the viral protein integrase (IN), and IN activity can be regulated by numerous viral and cellular proteins. Among these, LEDGF has been identified as a cellular cofactor critical for effective HIV-1 integration. The x-ray crystal structure of the catalytic core domain (CCD) of IN in complex with the IN binding domain (IBD) of LEDGF has furthermore revealed essential protein-protein contacts. However, mutagenic studies indicated that interactions between the full-length proteins were more extensive than the contacts observed in the co-crystal structure of the isolated domains. Therefore, we have conducted detailed biochemical characterization of the interactions between full-length IN and LEDGF. Our results reveal a highly dynamic nature of IN subunit-subunit interactions. LEDGF strongly stabilized these interactions and promoted IN tetramerization. Mass spectrometric protein footprinting and molecular modeling experiments uncovered novel intra- and inter-protein-protein contacts in the full-length IN-LEDGF complex that lay outside of the observable IBD-CCD structure. In particular, our studies defined the IN tetramer interface important for enzymatic activities and high affinity LEDGF binding. These findings provide new insight into how LEDGF modulates HIV-1 IN structure and function, and highlight the potential for exploiting the highly dynamic structure of multimeric IN as a novel therapeutic target.

Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Plainview, NY1997: 161-204Google Scholar). This process is catalyzed by the retroviral enzyme integrase (IN) in two reaction steps. In the first step, which is called 3′-processing and takes place shortly after the cDNA is made, IN hydrolyzes a GT dinucleotide from each end of the viral DNA. In the second step, IN catalyzes concerted integration of the processed viral DNA ends into chromosomal DNA. The sites of attack on the two target DNA strands are separated by 5 bp, which leads to dissociation of the small double-stranded DNA fragment between the attachment sites. The subsequent repair of the intermediate species by cellular enzymes completes the integration reaction.HIV-1 IN consists of three distinct structural and functional domains. The N-terminal domain (NTD) (residues 1–50) contains conserved pairs of histidine and cysteine residues that bind zinc (2Bushman F.D. Engelman A. Palmer I. Wingfield P. Craigie R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The catalytic core domain (CCD) (residues 51–212) contains three acidic residues, Asp-64, Asp-116, and Glu-152, which play a key role in coordinating active site divalent metal ions (6Dyda F.

An evolutionarily conserved domain in the C-terminal region (residues 347–429) mediates the interaction with IN and was thus termed the IN-binding domain (IBD) (39Cherepanov P. Devroe E. Silver P.A.

The solution structure of the LEDGF IBD and its co-crystallization with the IN CCD has been recently reported (47Cherepanov P. Sun Z.Y. Rahman S. Maertens G. Wagner G. Engelman A. Nat. Struct. Mol.

However, mutagenesis studies have also indicated that full-length IN-LEDGF interactions extend beyond the contacts observed in the co-crystal structure of the isolated domains (28Maertens G.

LEDGF moreover strongly stabilized the IN subunit-subunit contacts. Mass spectrometric surface topology studies furthermore uncovered novel protein-protein contacts, which lie outside of the central IBD-CCD co-crystal structure. Mutational analysis confirmed the importance of the identified residues and indicated a strong correlation between IN tetramer formation and high affinity LEDGF binding. These findings provide new insight into how LEDGF modulates HIV-1 IN structure/function, and highlight the potential to exploit the highly dynamic nature of IN subunit interactions as a novel therapeutic target.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression Plasmids and Recombinant Proteins—HIV-1 IN proteins were expressed from pKBIN6Hthr, which was derived from pKB-IN6H (28Maertens G.

Ligands (IBD or LEDGF) were added before preincubation for 20 min at room temperature. Reactions (25-μl final volume) were initiated by adding 500 ng of circular target DNA (pGEM, Promega), and the mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding 10 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, and 1 mg/ml proteinase K. After ethanol precipitation, samples were subjected to 0.6% agarose gel electrophoresis for 6 h at 50 V. The gels were dried, and the labeled DNA products were detected using the Storm 860 Phosphorimager.Subunit Exchange Assay—His-tagged IN (1 μm) was preincubated with or without ligand (2 μm LEDGF or 2 μm mtLEDGF) in exchange buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.1, 200 mm NaCl, 4% glycerol, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min at room temperature. Tag-free IN (1 μm) was then added and incubated for the indicated times. Aliquots were then briefly centrifuged 2 min at 1,000 × g, and supernatants were pulled-down by Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) resin (GE Healthcare) for 10 min in the presence of bovine serum albumin (0.1 mg/ml). The IN-bound resin was then washed three times with buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.1), 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm imidazole, and 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P40. The bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE separation and visualized by Coomassie Blue stain.Mass Spectrometric Footprinting—In parallel reactions, free IN and IN+LEDGF were first incubated at room temperature for 30 min and then subjected to treatments at 37 °C with 1 mmN-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-biotin for 30 min or 20 mm p-hydroxyphenylglyoxal (HPG) for 60 min. These concentrations of modifying reagents were chosen because comparative pulldown experiments with untreated and modified IN-LEDGF complexes indicated that under these conditions the integrity of the preassembled protein-protein complex was fully preserved (data not shown). NHS-biotin treatment was carried out in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2. The HPG modifications were performed in 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 50 mm boric acid, 150 mm NaCl. The reactions were quenched by excess Lys and Arg using free amino acid forms. IN-LEDGF complexes were selectively pulled-down using Ni-NTA resin. The bound proteins were separated by denaturing SDS-PAGE and visualized by Microwave Blue stain (Protiga, Gaithersburg, MD). IN bands were excised, destained, and subjected to in-gel proteolysis with 0.5 μg of trypsin. The tryptic peptides were analyzed with the Axima-CFR MALDI-ToF instrument (Shimadzu) using α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid as a matrix.Size Exclusion Chromatography—Experiments were performed with a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) at 0.5 ml/min in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 750 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. The column was calibrated with the following proteins: conalbumin (75,000 Da), carbonic anhydrase (29,000 Da), ribonuclease A (13,700 Da), and aprotinin (6,500 Da). Proteins were detected by absorbance at 280 nm.Molecular Modeling—The model of the NTD-CCD tetramer bound to the LEDGF IBD was generated by overlaying the CCDs within PDB structures 2B4J (48Cherepanov P.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7333-7343Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) using the Insight II software package (Accelrys Inc., San Diego) on a Silicon Graphics O2 work station. The constructed model was then energy-minimized by the same software package using the CFF91 force field and steepest descent method.LEDGF Binding Affinities to Wild-type and Mutant INs—LEDGF (50–650 nm) was incubated with 100 nm His-tagged IN (WT or mutant) in binding buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.1), 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm imidazole, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P40) for 60 min at room temperature. Samples were then briefly centrifuged for 2 min at 1,000 × g, and supernatants were pulled-down by Ni-NTA resin for 30 min in the presence of bovine serum albumin (0.1 mg/ml). The resin was then washed three times with the same buffer, and the bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. LEDGF was detected by Western blot analysis using a mouse monoclonal LEDGF antibody (BD Biosciences) and quantified using Image software (NIH). Plotting and curve fitting was performed with Origin 8 software (OriginLab). Nonspecific signal was not detected when LEDGF was incubated with Ni-NTA beads in the absence of IN (data not shown).RESULTSWe previously reported that LEDGF significantly stimulated the in vitro activities of HIV-1 IN whereas the isolated IBD failed to do so (39Cherepanov P.

As these assays utilized relatively long blunt-ended viral DNA substrates and DNA strand transfer product formation as read-out, we reanalyzed the effects of these two proteins on IN function using an oligonucleotide-based assay that monitors the formation of 3′-processing and DNA strand transfer reaction products on denaturing sequencing gels (Fig. 2) (52Bushman F.D. Craigie R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1339-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The results in panel B (lanes 1–6) revealed stimulation of IN DNA strand transfer activity by the LEDGF IBD under these assay conditions. It should be noted that in this setting the 19-mer 3′-processing reaction product is the substrate for the second catalytic step (Fig. 2A). To dissect if the IBD directly enhanced IN 3′ processing activity, a selective IN strand transfer inhibitor (53Zhang X. Pais G.C. Svarovskaia E.S. Marchand C. Johnson A.A. Karki R.G. Nicklaus M.C.

https://openalex.org/W2046477151,"Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteases regulate the abundance and lifetime of SUMO-conjugated substrates by antagonizing reactions catalyzed by SUMO-conjugating enzymes. Six SUMO proteases constitute the human SENP/ULP protease family (SENP1-3 and SENP5-7). SENP6 and SENP7 include the most divergent class of SUMO proteases, which also includes the yeast enzyme ULP2. We present the crystal structure of the SENP7 catalytic domain at a resolution of 2.4 angstroms. Comparison with structures of human SENP1 and SENP2 reveals unique elements that differ from previously characterized structures of SUMO-deconjugating enzymes. Biochemical assays show that SENP6 and SENP7 prefer SUMO2 or SUMO3 in deconjugation reactions with rates comparable with those catalyzed by SENP2, particularly during cleavage of di-SUMO2, di-SUMO3, and poly-SUMO chains composed of SUMO2 or SUMO3. In contrast, SENP6 and SENP7 exhibit lower rates for processing pre-SUMO1, pre-SUMO2, or pre-SUMO3 in comparison with SENP2. Structure-guided mutational analysis reveals elements unique to the SENP6 and SENP7 subclass of SENP/ULP proteases that contribute to protease function during deconjugation of poly-SUMO chains."

To elucidate the in vivo actions of this atypical sPLA2, we generated transgenic (Tg) mice overexpressing human PLA2G3. Despite marked increases in PLA2 activity and mature 18-kDa PLA2G3 protein in the circulation and tissues, PLA2G3 Tg mice displayed no apparent abnormality up to 9 months of age. However, alterations in plasma lipoproteins were observed in PLA2G3 Tg mice compared with control mice. In vitro incubation of low density (LDL) and high density (HDL) lipoproteins with several sPLA2s showed that phosphatidylcholine was efficiently converted to lysophosphatidylcholine by PLA2G3 as well as by PLA2G5 and PLA2G10, to a lesser extent by PLA2G2F, and only minimally by PLA2G2A and PLA2G2E. PLA2G3-modified LDL, like PLA2G5- or PLA2G10-treated LDL, facilitated the formation of foam cells from macrophages ex vivo. Accumulation of PLA2G3 was detected in the atherosclerotic lesions of humans and apoE-deficient mice. Furthermore, following an atherogenic diet, aortic atherosclerotic lesions were more severe in PLA2G3 Tg mice than in control mice on the apoE-null background, in combination with elevated plasma lysophosphatidylcholine and thromboxane A2 levels. These results collectively suggest a potential functional link between PLA2G3 and atherosclerosis, as has recently been proposed for PLA2G5 and PLA2G10.

To date, 10 catalytically active sPLA2 enzymes have been identified in mammals (IB, IIA, IIC, IID, IIE, IIF, III, V, X, and XIIA). These enzymes are further subdivided into three branches, namely groups I/II/V/X, group III, and group XII (1Murakami M. Kudo I. Adv.

Recent studies employing transgenic (Tg) (gain-of-function) and knock-out (loss-of-function) mice for several sPLA2s have revealed that individual enzymes exert distinct functions in vivo.

PLA2G3 (group III sPLA2) is distinctive among mammalian sPLA2s. It consists of a central sPLA2 (S) domain flanked by unique N-terminal and C-terminal domains, the molecular mass of its full-length protein (55 kDa) is larger than that of other sPLA2s (14–18 kDa), and its S domain is homologous to bee venom group III sPLA2 rather than to other mammalian sPLA2s (17Valentin E.

In brief, the cDNA for human PLA2G3 was inserted into the EcoRI site of the pCALNL5 vector (37Kanegae Y. Takamori K. Sato Y. Lee G. Nakai M. Saito I. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 181: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The plasmid, containing the transgene downstream of a neomycin cassette with LoxP sites at both ends, was excised at the HindIII and SalI sites to produce a 6-kb CAG-loxP-neor-loxP-PLA2G3 (LNL-PLA2G3) fragment. The fragment was then microinjected into 0.5-day fertilized eggs with a micromanipulator (Nikon), and the eggs were transferred to the fimbriae of the uterine tubes of female ICR mice (Japan SLC) that had been mated with vasoligated male mice 1 day before. The tails (5 mm in length) of the pups (4 weeks old) were cut off and homogenized in 500 μl of tissue lysis buffer comprising 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K (Sigma) at 55 °C overnight. DNA was purified from the lysates with an automated DNA isolation system (NA-2000; Kurabo Industries), and aliquots were taken for PCR for genotyping (see below). Male founders were mated with female C57BL/6 mice to confirm germ line transmission by PCR genotyping, and those with successful germ line transmission (LNL-PLA2G3 Tg mice) were then crossed with female CAG-Cre Tg mice, which carry the Cre recombinase transgene under control of the CAG (cytomegalovirus immediate early enhancer-chicken β-actin hybrid) promoter (38Sakai K. Miyazaki J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 39Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4597) Google Scholar). This step resulted in removal of the neor cassette from the LNL-PLA2G3 transgene, thereby allowing activation of the PLA2G3 transgene in the whole body of the offspring (Fig. 1). All of the PLA2G3 Tg mice were inbred with C57BL/6 mice. Phenotypes that appeared in PLA2G3 Tg mice, which carry the active PLA2G3 transgene, but not in LNL-PLA2G3 Tg mice, in which the PLA2G3 transgene remains silent, were regarded as events caused by the overexpressed PLA2G3. Generation of PLA2G10 Tg mice was described previously (36Wooton-Kee C.R. Boyanovsky B.B. Nasser M.S. de Villiers W.J. Webb N.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). PCR Genotyping—Approximately 0.1 μg of genomic DNA obtained from the mouse tails was subjected to PCR amplification with ExTaq polymerase (Takara Biomedicals) and a set of primers (CAG-F1 (5′-ctgctaaccatgttcatgcc-3′) and CAG-III-R1 (5′-gttgtactgcaagggtgaga-3′) for PLA2G3; CAG-F1 and CAGX-R1 (5′-gggctaagcagttagcaatc-3′) for PLA2G10) obtained from Fasmac. The PCR conditions were 95 °C for 5 min and then 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 3 min on a thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems). The PCR products were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide. Northern Blotting—Equal amounts (∼10 μg) of total RNA obtained from tissues by use of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) were applied to separate lanes of 1.2% (w/v) formaldehyde-agarose gels, electrophoresed, and transferred to Immobilon-N membranes (Millipore). The resulting blots were then probed with appropriate cDNA probes that had been labeled with [32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by random priming (Takara Biomedicals). Hybridization and subsequent membrane washing were carried out as described previously (15Murakami M. Koduri R.S. Enomoto A. Shimbara S. Seki M. Yoshihara K. Singer A. Valentin E. Ghomashchi F.

Purification of Recombinant Human PLA2G3—The cDNA encoding the S domain of human PLA2G3 (III-S; amino acid residues 136–289) was inserted after a coding sequence for the His6 tag of the pMSNHT expression vector (Katakura Industries). Baculovirus carrying the cDNA for the N-terminally His6-tagged III-S was injected into silkworms (Katakura Industries). After 6 days, 2 ml of the silkworm body fluid was diluted in 40 ml of 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1.5 m NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20, and protease inhibitors (catalogue number 1 873 580; Roche Applied Science). The soluble fraction of the homogenate was applied to HisTrap HP (1-ml column volume; GE Healthcare) on an AKTA system (Amersham Biosciences). The column was sequentially washed with phosphate buffer containing 1.5 m NaCl and 0.01% Tween 20 and then with the same buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, followed by elution of the bound proteins with phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with a 0–100% gradient of NaCl and imidazole (both up to 0.5 m) for 90 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions containing III-S protein (∼20% purity as assessed by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue; not shown) were collected and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Measurement of PLA2 Activity—Tissues (100 μg) were soaked in 500 μl of SET buffer comprising 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) and then homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer and sonicator. PLA2 activities in the tissue homogenates and sera were assayed by measuring the amounts of radiolabeled linoleic acid released from the substrate 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]linoleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (PerkinElmer Life Science). The substrate in ethanol was dried under a stream of N2 and dispersed in water by sonication. Each reaction mixture (total volume 250 μl) consisted of appropriate amounts of the required samples, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 4 mm CaCl2 and 2 μmol of substrate. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, [14C]linoleic acid was extracted, and the radioactivity was quantified with a liquid scintillation counter, as described previously (15Murakami M. Koduri R.S. Enomoto A. Shimbara S. Seki M. Yoshihara K. Singer A. Valentin E. Ghomashchi F. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10083-10096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Preparation of Anti-PLA2G3 Antibodies—The cDNA encoding the S domain of human PLA2G3 (amino acid residues 150–290) was inserted after a coding sequence for His6 tag of the pPROExHTb expression vector (Invitrogen). The expressed protein was purified by nickel-Sepharose and further purified by the Prep Cell system (Bio-Rad), followed by removal of the His6 tag from the S domain. Two rabbit antisera against the purified S domain were prepared by Kitayama Laboratories (designated Nov1 and Nov2). Alternatively, rabbit antiserum against the synthetic peptide CPQNISPLQYNYGIRN (corresponding to amino acid residues 187–202, a portion that shows high homology between human and mouse PLA2G3 proteins) was prepared by BioLogica (designated S3). The specificity of the antibodies thus obtained was evaluated by immunoblotting (Fig. S1A) using Sf9 cells (cell homogenates and culture supernatants) infected with baculovirus expressing III-S of human PLA2G3. The procedure for immunoblotting has been described previously (15Murakami M. Koduri R.S. Enomoto A. Shimbara S. Seki M. Yoshihara K. Singer A. Valentin E. Ghomashchi F. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10083-10096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibodies for human PLA2G3 were prepared by a standard protocol using recombinant human III-S protein as an antigen (see above). Anti-PLA2G3 mouse monoclonal antibody was produced by culturing the hybridoma cell line 7B5B7, 4A10C5, 1F4E2, or 5D2F1 in BD Cell mAb Serum-free Medium with CELLine CL-1000 flasks (BD Biosciences) at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 7 days. Culture supernatant was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min to remove cells and then filtered through a 0.45-μm filter. Phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was added to the filtered culture supernatant at a final concentration of 20 mm before loading the sample onto a Protein G-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare). After washing the column with 10 times the column volume of 20 mm phosphate buffer, the anti-PLA2G3 antibody was eluted with 100 mm citric acid buffer (pH 2.7) and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl (TBS). The specificity of each monoclonal antibody was evaluated by Western blotting (Fig. S1B). Histochemistry—Immunohistochemistry of mouse and human tissue sections was performed as described previously (19Murakami M. Masuda S. Shimbara S. Ishikawa Y. Ishii T. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24987-24998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Use of human tissues was approved by the ethics committee of our faculty. In brief, formalin-fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin, sectioned, mounted on glass slides, deparaffinized in xylene, and rehydrated in ethanol with increasing concentrations of water. The tissue sections (4 μm thick) were incubated with Target Retrieval Solution (Dako Cytomation) as required, incubated for 10 min with 3% (v/v) H2O2, washed three times with TBS for 5 min each, incubated with 5% (v/v) skim milk in TBS for 30 min, washed three times with TBS for 5 min each, and incubated with anti-sPLA2 antibodies or control serum at a 1:200–500 dilution in TBS overnight at 4 °C. The sections were then treated with a CSA (catalyzed signal-amplified) system staining kit (Dako Cytomation) with diaminobenzidine substrate, followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin and eosin. The cell type was identified by conventional hematoxylin and eosin staining of serial sections adjacent to the specimen used for immunohistochemistry. Rabbit antisera for human and mouse PLA2G2A, PLA2G5, and PLA2G10 have been described previously (15Murakami M. Koduri R.S. Enomoto A. Shimbara S. Seki M. Yoshihara K. Singer A. Valentin E.

Immunostaining for human α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) (clone 1A4; Dako Cytomation) and human macrophages (clone HAM56; Dako Cytomation) was also performed using the EnVision+ kit (Dako Cytomation) for identification of smooth muscle cells and monocytes/macrophages, respectively (40Kimura-Matsumoto M. Ishikawa Y. Komiyama K. Tsuruta T. Murakami M. Masuda S. Akasaka Y. Ito K. Ishiguro S. Morita H. Sato S. Ishii T. Atherosclerosis. 2008; 196: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Double immunostaining with antibodies against α-SMA or HAM56 and PLA2G3 was performed on the sections to determine the localization of PLA2G3 in intimal cells. In brief, the sections were first immunostained for α-SMA or HAM56 and visualized by diaminobenzidine. They were then reimmunostained with antibody against PLA2G3 using EnVision System-alkaline phosphatase (Dako Cytomation) and visualized with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate system (Dako Cytomation). When colocalized, the color turned into dark blue. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—A monoclonal antibody for PLA2G3 (5D2F1) or control mouse IgG1 (2 mg) was conjugated with 0.5 ml of formyl Cellulofine (Seikagaku Kogyo). The beads (20 μl) were incubated with 250 μl of the plasma obtained from PLA2G3 Tg mice as well as control mice at 4 °C overnight. After centrifugation, the beads were washed five times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and boiled for 5 min in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Then the resulting supernatants were applied to 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were subjected to immunoblotting with rabbit anti-PLA2G3 polyclonal antibody, as described previously (15Murakami M. Koduri R.S. Enomoto A. Shimbara S. Seki M. Yoshihara K. Singer A.

Measurement of Serum Biochemical Markers—With or without an overnight fast, 10-week-old mice were anesthetized, and blood samples were immediately collected by cardiac puncture. Sera were applied to a clinical chemistry analyzer VetScan with V-DPP rotors (Abaxis). Foam Cell Formation from Macrophages—The mouse macrophage cell line J774 (American Type Culture Collection) was maintained in DMEM (Wako) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B. LDL (d = 1.019–1.063 g/ml) was prepared from human plasma by the ultracentrifugation method modified by Hatch (38Sakai K. Miyazaki J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). LDL (2 mg/ml) was treated with partially purified human PLA2G3 (200 μg/ml) or human PLA2G5 (5 μg/ml) (Cayman Chemicals) in a buffer comprising 6 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 6 mm CaCl2, 84 mm NaCl, 2.4 mm MgCl2, and 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). After incubation for 24 h at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 mm EDTA. Subsequently, the concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) released were determined by colorimetric assay with an NEFA C Kit (Wako). J774 cells were seeded on 24-well plates at a cell density of 105 cells/well. After incubation for 2 h, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 200 μg/ml LDL with or without pretreatment with human PLA2G3 or PLA2G5. Alternatively, 50 μg/ml acetylated LDL (Ac-LDL) (Biomedical Technology Inc.) was used as a positive control for foam cell formation. After 24 h, the cells were fixed in 10% formalin in PBS for 10 min and washed with PBS. Saturated oil red O solution was prepared by dilution of 3 mg/ml oil red O in 60% isopropyl alcohol, followed by filtration through a 0.45-μm filter. Following equilibration in 60% isopropyl alcohol, the cells were stained in saturated oil red O. After a brief wash with 60%"
https://openalex.org/W2043304383,"Type I interferons (IFNs) signal for their diverse biological effects by binding a common receptor on target cells, composed of the two transmembrane IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 proteins. We have previously differentially enhanced the antiproliferative activity of IFN by increasing the weak binding affinity of IFN to IFNAR1. In this study, we further explored the affinity interdependencies between the two receptor subunits and the role of IFNAR1 in differential IFN activity. For this purpose, we generated a panel of mutations targeting the IFNAR2 binding site on the background of the IFNα2 YNS mutant, which increases the affinity to IFNAR1 by 60-fold, resulting in IFNAR2-to-IFNAR1 binding affinity ratios ranging from 1000:1 to 1:1000. Both the antiproliferative and antiviral potencies of the interferon mutants clearly correlated to the in situ binding IC50 values, independently of the relative contributions of the individual receptors, thus relating to the integral lifetime of the complex. However, the antiproliferative potency correlated throughout the entire range of affinities, as well as with prolonged IFNAR1 receptor down-regulation, whereas the antiviral potency reached a maximum at binding affinities equivalent to that of wild-type IFNα2. Our data suggest that (i) the specific activity of interferon is related to the ternary complex binding affinity and not to affinity toward individual receptor components and (ii) although the antiviral pathway is strongly dependent on pSTAT1 activity, the cytostatic effect requires additional mechanisms that may involve IFNAR1 down-regulation. This differential interferon response is ultimately mediated through distinct gene expression profiling.

Type I interferons (IFNs) 2The abbreviations used are: IFN, interferon; JAK, Janus kinase; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; WT, wild type. form a class of cytokines capable of mediating antiviral, growth-inhibitory and immunoregulatory activities (1Haller O.

Rev. 2004; 202: 8-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar), all IFNs induce their biological activities through binding to the same receptor complex, composed of the two transmembrane proteins IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 (5Brierley M.M. Fish E.N. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 835-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The signal is then transduced mainly through the JAK-STAT pathway, in which the tyrosine kinases Tyk2 and Jak1, which are constitutively associated with the IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 subunits, are activated by phosphorylation upon IFN-receptor binding (6Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar, 7Platanias L.C. Fish E.N. Exp. Hematol. 1999; 27: 1583-1592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Subsequently, they phosphorylate STAT proteins that dimerize or form ternary complexes with DNA-binding proteins that translocate to the nucleus to promote the expression of IFN-stimulated genes. The IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 receptor subunits are expressed in virtually every nucleated cell (6Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar), yet the way in which IFNs exert specific activities in different physiological contexts is still obscure. Despite common biological activities, differences observed for various IFNs (8Rosenblum M.G. Yung W.K. Kelleher P.J. Ruzicka F. Steck P.A. Borden E.C. J.

Biol. 2007; 366: 525-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) seem to indicate that at least not all IFN subtypes are redundant. Different potencies of specific IFNs are known to be determined to a large extent by their affinities toward the IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 subunits, with only IFNβ standing out for its higher affinity toward IFNAR1 (11Jaks E. Gavutis M. Uze G. Martal J. Piehler J. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 525-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Significant differences are observed in the ability of the two subunits to bind IFNs, as in the case of IFNα2, which binds the IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 subunits with micromolar and nanomolar affinities, respectively. Nevertheless, both components are necessary to induce the IFN signal, as demonstrated by the use of neutralizing antibodies against the extracellular part of IFNAR1 (12Cajean-Feroldi C. Nosal F. Nardeux P.C. Gallet X. Guymarho J. Baychelier F. Sempe P. Tovey M.G. Escary J.L. Eid P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12498-12512Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and by a cell line lacking IFNAR2 (13Lutfalla G. Holland S.J. Cinato E. Monneron D. Reboul J. Rogers N.C. Smith J.M. Stark G.R. Gardiner K. Mogensen K.F. Kerr I.M. Uze G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5100-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), both resulting in complete lack of responsiveness to both IFNα and IFNβ. We have recently described an optimized IFNα2 mutant (YNS), which binds IFNAR1 with ∼60-fold higher affinity compared with the wild type (KD = 30 nm) while keeping its affinity toward IFNAR2 unaltered (KD = 1.5 nm) (14Kalie E. Jaitin D.A. Abramovich R. Schreiber G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11602-11611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This is feasible because the binding sites on interferon toward both receptors are located on opposite surfaces and are independent of each other (15Roisman L.C. Piehler J. Trosset J.Y. Scheraga H.A.

Biol. 2008; 377: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In WISH cells, the YNS mutant exhibited a 100-fold stronger antiproliferative potency compared with its wild type counterpart, accompanied by only a slight increase in its antiviral potency, suggesting that IFNAR1 might play a unique role in the induction of IFN-promoted antiproliferative signals and account for differential signaling within this cytokine family (11Jaks E. Gavutis M. Uze G. Martal J. Piehler J. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 525-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 19de Weerd N.A. Samarajiwa S.A. Hertzog P.J. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2007; 316: 71-95PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we test this hypothesis by analyzing a set of IFNα2 mutants, in which the optimized IFNAR1 binding was combined with a reduction in affinity toward IFNAR2 to various degrees. Our results indicate an additive contribution of both IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 binding to antiproliferative potency along the whole range of mutations, whereas antiviral potency reaches a maximum already at low combined affinities. The differential biological effects, which relate to qualitatively different gene expression patterns, are distinctly related to receptor down-regulation and pSTAT1, suggesting that the antiproliferative and antiviral effects are driven by different pathways. Protein Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis of IFNα2 was carried out by primer extension using bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase on expression vector pT7T318U containing the IFNα2 gene, which was used as a single-stranded DNA template following subsequent transfection into and recombinant protein production in CJ236 cells (21Sidhu S.S. Lowman H.B. Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 333-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein Expression and Purification—IFNα2 and IFNAR2-EC were expressed in E. coli Rosetta strain and purified by ion exchange and size exclusion chromatography (22Piehler J. Schreiber G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined both by analytical gel filtration chromatography and from the absorbance at 280 nm with ϵ280 = 18,500 cm-1 m-1 for IFNα2 and ϵ280 = 26,500 cm-1 m-1 for IFNAR2-EC. IFNAR1-EC was expressed in Sf9 insect cells and purified as described before (23Lamken P. Lata S. Gavutis M. Piehler J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 303-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In Vitro Binding Assays—Binding affinities of IFNα2 toward IFNAR1-EC or IFNAR2-EC were measured using the ProteOn XPR36 Protein Interaction Array system (Bio-Rad), based on surface plasmon resonance technology. Phosphate-buffered saline was used as running buffer at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. For immobilization of the IFNAR1 receptor subunit, a NeutrAvidin-covered sensor chip (NLC; Bio-Rad) was bound with 150 nm biotin-conjugated tris-nitrilotriacetic acid (24Reichel A. Schaible D. Furoukh N.A. Cohen M. Schreiber G. Piehler J. Anal. Chem. 2007; 79: 8590-8600Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The IFNAR1-EC subunit was then injected to separate channels in duplicates, at 100 and 200 nm, respectively, to bind the tris-nitrilotriacetic acid on the chip surface via their His tags. The IFNAR2 receptor was immobilized as detailed in Ref. 14Kalie E. Jaitin D.A. Abramovich R. Schreiber G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11602-11611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar. The tested interferons were then injected perpendicular to ligands at six different concentrations within a range of 16.5-4,000 nm for IFNAR1 binding and 6.25-200 nm for IFNAR2 binding. Data were analyzed using BIAeval 4.1 software, using the standard Langmuir models for fitting kinetic data. Dissociation constants KD were determined from the rate constants according to Equation 1, KD=kdka(Eq. 1) or from the equilibrium response at six different analyte concentrations, fitted to the mass-action equation (22Piehler J. Schreiber G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Binding Assays on Artificial Membranes—Binding of IFNα2 to IFNAR1-EC and IFNAR2-EC tethered onto artificial membranes was monitored in real time by simultaneous total internal reflection fluorescence spectroscopy and reflectance interference detection in a flow system as in principle described previously (25Gavutis M.

Gregor I. Becker Y. Li Z. Gavutis M. Jaks E. Lamken P. Walz T. Enderlein J. Piehler J. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 725-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For this purpose, IFNAR1-H10 N349C was cysteine-specifically labeled with ATTO 655 (AT655IFNAR1-H10), which is quenched by the proximal Trp347. Upon ligand binding, the accessibility of Trp347 is substantially reduced, leading to dequenching of the dye (27Strunk J.J. Gregor I. Becker Y. Li Z. Gavutis M. Jaks E. Lamken P. Walz T. Enderlein J. Piehler J. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 725-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). ATTO 655 was excited by a helium-neon laser (excitation power ∼150 microwatts), and the fluorescence was detected through a bandpass filter. Continuous membranes were obtained by fusing lipid vesicles (steroyloleyl phosphatidylcholine), which were doped with ∼5% lipids carrying tris-nitrilotriacetic acid head groups for tethering the receptor subunits (28Lata S. Gavutis M. Piehler J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 6-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) onto clean silica transducer slides. For comparing different combined IFNα2 mutants, IFNAR2-H10 (∼3.5 fmol/mm2) and AT655IFNAR1-H10 (∼2.5 fmol/mm2) were sequentially tethered onto the membrane. Subsequently, the ligand was injected (100-500 nm), and its dissociation was monitored for 400 s, followed by an injection of imidazole (500 nm) for removing all proteins from the surface prior to the next experiment. The curves were drift-corrected by blank run subtraction, and the dissociation curves were fitted by a two-step dissociation model considering the two equilibria of the binary complexes IFNα2-IFNAR1 and IFNα2-IFNAR2 with the ternary IFNα2-IFNAR1-IFNAR2 complex (26Gavutis M. Lata S. Lamken P. Muller P. Piehler J. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 4289-4302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The differential equations describing the two-step dissociation were fitted using Berkeley Madonna 8.0.1. The parameters for the interaction with IFNAR1 were kept constant for all IFNα2 mutants, and only the two-dimensional dissociation constant for the interaction with IFNAR2 on the membrane was varied. As a control, the binary complex between AT655IFNAR1-H10 and the IFNα2 mutants was measured, and the dissociation curves were fitted by a monoexponential decay using BIAeval 3.1 software. In Situ Binding Assays—Wild-type IFNα2 was labeled with 125I using the chloramine T iodination method (29Jacobs S. Hazum E. Shechter Y. Cuatrecasas P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4918-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). After iodination, the radiolabeled interferon was cleaned using a home-made Sephadex column. For the competition assay, WISH cells were grown on 24-well plates, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% sodium azide, and then incubated for 10 min with the same solution. Next, cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature (20 °C) with the labeled wild type IFNα2 (200,000 cpm/well) in the presence of an unlabeled IFNα2 of interest at 10 different concentrations: wild type IFNα2 and the YNS/153, YNS/148A mutants starting from 50 nm, YNS/30A and YNS/33A starting from 1 μm, and the 30A, 33A, NLYY mutants starting from 6 μm. All tested interferons were diluted in 6-fold steps in culture medium plus 0.1% sodium azide. Cells were then washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline to eliminate unbound interferons, trypsinated, and transferred into test tubes for measuring of bound, 125I-labeled IFNα2 wild type, using a γ-counter (Packard). The experiment was repeated three times, each time in duplicate. IC50 values were calculated using Kaleidagraph Synergy Software. Antiviral and Antiproliferative Assays—The antiproliferative assay (16Roisman L.C. Jaitin D.A. Baker D.P. Schreiber G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was performed on WISH cells by adding the tested IFNα2 (wild type or mutants) at serial dilutions to the growth medium in flat bottomed microtiter plates and monitoring cell density after 72 h by staining with crystal violet. The 50% activity concentrations (EC50) as well as the sensitivity of cells to increasing amounts of interferon were deduced from an IFN dose-response curve (Kaleidagraph, Synergy Software) using Equation 2, Y=A0+A/1+C/EC50s(Eq. 2) where y represents the absorbance and reflects the relative number of cells, A0 is the offset, A is the amplitude, c is the IFN concentration, and s is the slope (16Roisman L.C. Jaitin D.A. Baker D.P. Schreiber G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Antiviral activity was assayed as the inhibition of the cytopathic effect of vesicular stomatitis virus on human WISH cells, as described previously (16Roisman L.C. Jaitin D.A. Baker D.P. Schreiber G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 30Rubinstein M. Pestka S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 78: 464-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In general, IFN was added at serial dilutions to cells grown on flat bottomed 96-well plates. Four hours later, vesicular stomatitis virus was added to all wells, and after 17 h of incubation, cell density was measured by crystal violet staining. EC50 was calculated as described for the antiproliferative experiment. Both the antiviral and antiproliferative assays were repeated at least three times for each protein. The experimental error (σ) for both assays was 35%. Therefore, a confidence level of 2× S.E. would suggest that differences smaller than 2-fold between interferons are within the experimental error. pSTAT1 and pSTAT3 Phosphorylation Assays—WISH cells were lysed at 4 °C with radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA). Total protein concentrations were determined using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and equal amounts were separated by SDS-PAGE. Levels of phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT3 were determined by Western blot analysis using polyclonal Tyr(P)701-STAT1- and Tyr(P)705-STAT3-specific antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Equal amounts of STAT1 and STAT3 protein were verified by reblotting with a polyclonal anti-STAT1 and -STAT3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Quantitative analyses of the Western blots were done using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Flow Cytometry Analysis of Cell Surface Receptors—Relative levels of IFN receptor subunits were assessed by indirect fluorescence immunostaining and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, as described elsewhere (31Jaitin D.A. Roisman L.C. Jaks E. Gavutis M. Piehler J. Van der Heyden J. Uze G. Schreiber G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 1888-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 32Jaitin D.A. Schreiber G. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2007; 27: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Surface IFNAR levels upon IFN treatment were quantified as relative to untreated cells (100%), using the median value of their signal histograms and taking the isotypic control levels as background. Gene Expression Profiling—Total RNA was converted to cRNA, labeled, and hybridized on Agilent whole human genome 4X44K (G4112F) microarrays according to the manufacturer's protocol (Agilent). The slides were scanned in an Agilent DNA microarray scanner G2505B. Images were analyzed, and data were extracted using Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5.1.1, with linear and Lowess normalization performed for each array. A loop design with two biological replicates was designed to compare the four samples. The statistical analysis was performed using the Limma (Linear Models for Microarray Data) package from the Bioconductor project (available on the World Wide Web). The processed signal resulting from the Agilent Feature Extraction software was read into Limma using the “read.maimages” function. Aquantile normalization between arrays was applied. Standard quality control was performed using the plot functions of Limma (33Smyth G.K. Speed T. Methods. 2003; 31: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). Differential expression was assessed using linear models for designed microarray experiments. The -fold changes and S.E. were estimated by fitting a linear model for each gene and applying empirical Bayes smoothing to the S.E. values (34Smyth G.K. Stat. Appl. Genet. Mol. Biol. 2004; 3: Article 3Crossref Scopus (9247) Google Scholar). FDR (false discovery rate) was used to correct for multiple comparisons (35Reiner A. Yekutieli D. Benjamini Y. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). Design and Affinity Measurement of Combined IFNAR1/2 Binding Mutations—In all type I interferons, the binding affinity to the IFNAR2 receptor is much higher (up to 1000-fold) compared with the binding affinity to IFNAR1. This raises the possibility that the two receptors have differential roles in signaling, which is the tested hypothesis of the present study. We have recently constructed an optimized IFNα2 mutant designated YNS, which binds IFNAR1 with ∼60-fold higher affinity compared with wild type (KD = 30 nm) while keeping its affinity toward IFNAR2 unchanged (KD = 1.5 nm) (14Kalie E. Jaitin D.A. Abramovich R. Schreiber G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11602-11611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To examine the role of IFN binding to each receptor and correlate the differential affinities with differential biological outputs, we have constructed a series of Ala mutations on the IFNAR2 binding interface of IFNα2 on the background of the YNS mutant, including Ser153, Met148, Leu30, and Arg33 (Fig. 1A). These mutations were previously found to reduce the binding of IFNα2WT toward IFNAR2 by 6-, 60-, 700-, and 11,000-fold, respectively (36Piehler J. Roisman L.C. Schreiber G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40425-40433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Table 1 shows the binding affinities of these mutants as determined by SPR measurements, both on the YNS and WT background, toward IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. In accordance with the notion of independent IFNAR1/2 binding sites on IFN, the alanine mutations located on the IFNAR2 binding site of IFNα2 reduced the affinity toward IFNAR2 to the same extent both in the WT and YNS backgrounds. Accordingly, the affinity toward IFNAR1 of all YNS-containing mutant proteins increased by 50-60-fold, regardless of the reduction in IFNAR2 binding. Overall, these mutants provide proteins with IFNAR2/IFNAR1 binding affinity ratios from 1000:1 down to 1:1000 toward the two receptors, with the YNS/153A mutant having equal binding affinities to both receptors.TABLE 1In vitro binding affinities of interferon wild type and mutants towards IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 receptor subunitsIFNAR1IFNAR2R2/R1 affinity ratioKDRatio (mutant/WT)KDRatio (mutant/WT)μMμMWT1.610.0021790YNS0.03530.00141.421YNS/153A0.023700.0190.111.2YNS/148A0.037430.0870.0230.43YNS/30A0.03531.80.00110.018YNS/33A0.0440290.000070.001730A3.50.51.70.0012233A2.80.6290.000070.1NLYYND0.0030.7 Open table in a new tab Ternary Complex Stability as Measured on Artificial Membranes—In order to explore the consequences of the changes in ligand binding affinities toward IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, we probed ternary complex formation on artificial membranes by simultaneous total internal reflection fluorescence spectroscopy-reflectance interference detection. IFNAR1-EC and IFNAR2-EC were tethered to the membrane via their C-terminal His10 tags, which were selectively captured by tris-nitrilotriacetic acid moieties embedded into the membrane, enabling lateral diffusion and ligand-induced ternary complex formation (23Lamken P. Lata S. Gavutis M. Piehler J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 303-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 26Gavutis M. Lata S. Lamken P. Muller P. Piehler J. Biophys.

IFNAR1-EC N349C cysteine-specifically labeled with ATTO 655 (AT655IFNAR1-EC) was used for probing binding. The ligand-induced conformational change of IFNAR1-EC strongly reduces the accessibility of Trp347, leading to dequenching of the dye (27Strunk J.J. Gregor I. Becker Y. Li Z. Gavutis M. Jaks E. Lamken P. Walz T. Enderlein J. Piehler J. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 725-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A typical assay is shown in Fig. 1B; after sequential tethering of IFNAR2-EC and IFNAR1-EC, the ligand is injected and detected by the increase in fluorescence of AT655IFNAR1-EC. Whereas on the reflectance interference channel, all ligand binding to the receptor subunits on the membrane is detected, the fluorescence channel selectively detects binding to IFNAR1. The dissociation curves for different IFNα2 mutants from the ternary complex are compared in Fig. 1C. With decreasing affinity toward IFNAR2, faster dissociation from IFNAR1 in the presence of IFNAR2 is observed. On the contrary, in the absence of IFNAR2 on the surface, very similar dissociation from IFNAR1-EC was confirmed for all IFNα2-YNS mutants (Fig. S1A). Substantial stabilization of ligand binding by the presence of IFNAR2 was observed even for IFNα2-YNS/33A (blue versus gray in Fig. 1C). Although the quenching of AT655IFNAR1-EC is not directly related to the half-life of the ternary complex (since it is a measure of IFN-IFNAR1 binding), it is qualitatively related. Thus, the half-life extracted from the dissociation curves of the different mutants (Table 2) provides a measure of the stability of the ternary complex. The important role of receptor surface concentration is demonstrated in Fig. 1D for IFNα2-YNS/33A; a 3-fold increase in the half-life of the ternary complex is observed upon a 4-fold increase of the receptor surface concentration. Comparison of the dissociation kinetics of IFNα2 WT from the ternary complex measured at a similar receptor surface concentration yields a curve between the curves obtained for IFNα2-YNS/153A and IFNα2-YNS/148A (Fig. S1B). A schematic representation of the dynamic stabilization of the ternary complex is presented in Fig. 1E.TABLE 2Binding affinities of IFNs in the ternary complexIC50Ratio (mutant/WT)Combined affinity (R1 × R2) ratiot½ (ternary complex)Ratio (t½)nMsWT0.036114001YNS0.0021187516004.1YNS/153A0.0172.17.76001.5YNS/148A0.160.2213100.79YNS/30A0.280.130.0641400.35YNS/33A2.70.0130.0028640.1630A1000.000360.0012ND33A13000.000030.00007NDNLYY40.009ND500.13 Open table in a new tab In Situ Measurements of Ternary Complex Stability on the Cell Surface—Formation of a ternary IFN-IFNAR1/2 complex on the cell surface is necessary to relay an IFN signal into the cell. SPR was used to measure in vitro the binding affinities of the different mutants toward each receptor individually, and the measurements on artificial membranes provide us with in vitro data on the ternary complex stability. The relevance of the in vitro data was then evaluated with in situ measurements of the various interferon mutants toward the IFNAR receptors. IC50 values were determined using a binding competition assay on the cells with 125I-labeled IFNα2 wild type mixed with cold IFN (either wild type or mutants), measuring residual 125I-labeled IFNα2 binding. The IC50 of binding of the four combined mutants as well as L30A, R33A, and NLYY (Ala mutations in residues 65, 80, 85, and 89 resulting in almost no binding to IFNAR1) resulted in micromolar to picomolar values (Table 2 and Fig. S2). Relating the in situ EC50 values to the combined affinities of IFNs to both receptors (R1 × R2; Table 2 and Fig. 2A) as well as to the two receptors bound on artificial membranes (Fig. 1 and Table 2) showed a positive relation between the data. The logic of calculating a combined affinity (R1 × R2) from the individual binding constants is that this represents the simple case where each receptor contributes additively toward the total binding affinity of both receptors to interferon, as seems to be the case on the cell surface. Moreover, the IC50 of the wild-type interferon is similar to that measured for the 148/YNS mutant, in agreement with the data presented in Tables 1 and 2 for the combined binding aff"
https://openalex.org/W2004934052,"FFA2 and FFA3 are closely related G protein-coupled receptors that bind and respond to short chain fatty acids. (FFA2 and FFA3 are the provisional International Union of Pharmacology designations for the receptors previously called GPR43 and GPR41, respectively.) Sequence comparisons between these two receptors and alignments with the related G protein-coupled receptor FFA1, linked to homology modeling based on the atomic level structure of bovine rhodopsin, indicated the potential for polar residues within the transmembrane helix bundle to play important roles in ligand recognition and function. In both FFA2 and FFA3, mutation of either an arginine at the top of transmembrane domain V or a second arginine at the top of transmembrane domain VII eliminated the function of a range of short chain fatty acids. Mutation of a histidine in transmembrane domain VI, predicted to be in proximity to both the arginine residues, also eliminated function in many but not all assay formats. By contrast, mutation of a histidine in transmembrane domain IV, predicted to be lower in the binding pocket, modulated function in some assays of FFA3 function but had limited effects on the function of acetate and propionate at FFA2. Interestingly, wild type FFA3 responded to caproate, whereas FFA2 did not. Mutation of the transmembrane domain IV histidine eliminated responses of FFA3 to caproate but resulted in a gain of function of FFA2 to this six-carbon fatty acid. These data demonstrate the importance of positively charged residues in the recognition and/or function of short chain fatty acids in both FFA2 and FFA3. The development of small molecule ligands that interact selectively with these receptors will allow further details of the binding pockets to be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W1984634237,"Background Long-term survival outcome of critically ill patients is important in assessing effectiveness of new treatments and making treatment decisions. We developed a prognostic model for estimation of long-term survival of critically ill patients. Methodology and Principal Findings This was a retrospective linked data cohort study involving 11,930 critically ill patients who survived more than 5 days in a university teaching hospital in Western Australia. Older age, male gender, co-morbidities, severe acute illness as measured by Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II predicted mortality, and more days of vasopressor or inotropic support, mechanical ventilation, and hemofiltration within the first 5 days of intensive care unit admission were associated with a worse long-term survival up to 15 years after the onset of critical illness. Among these seven pre-selected predictors, age (explained 50% of the variability of the model, hazard ratio [HR] between 80 and 60 years old = 1.95) and co-morbidity (explained 27% of the variability, HR between Charlson co-morbidity index 5 and 0 = 2.15) were the most important determinants. A nomogram based on the pre-selected predictors is provided to allow estimation of the median survival time and also the 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year survival probabilities for a patient. The discrimination (adjusted c-index = 0.757, 95% confidence interval 0.745–0.769) and calibration of this prognostic model were acceptable. Significance Age, gender, co-morbidities, severity of acute illness, and the intensity and duration of intensive care therapy can be used to estimate long-term survival of critically ill patients. Age and co-morbidity are the most important determinants of long-term prognosis of critically ill patients."
https://openalex.org/W2062364825,"Aurora A is a serine/threonine kinase that functions in various stages of mitosis. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that gene amplification and overexpression of Aurora A are linked to tumorigenesis, suggesting that Aurora A is an oncogene. In addition, Aurora A overexpression has been used as a negative prognostic marker, because it is associated with resistance to anti-mitotic agents commonly used for cancer therapy. To understand the physiological functions of Aurora A, we generated Aurora A knock-out mice. Aurora A null mice die early during embryonic development before the 16-cell stage. These Aurora A null embryos have defects in mitosis, particularly in spindle assembly, supporting critical functions of Aurora A during mitotic transitions. Interestingly, Aurora A heterozygosity results in a significantly increased tumor incidence in mice, suggesting that Aurora A may also act as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor. Consistently, Aurora A heterozygous mouse embryonic fibroblasts have higher rates of aneuploidy. We further discovered that VX-680, an Aurora kinase inhibitor currently in phase II clinical trials for cancer treatment, could induce aneuploidy in wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts.

First identified in Drosophila, Aurora kinases are evolutionary conserved serine/threonine kinases in all eukaryotes, which function mainly during mitosis. Although there is only one member of Aurora in yeast and two in Drosophila, three were identified in mammals (Aurora A/B/C) with highly conserved catalytic domains (1Andrews P.D. Knatko E. Moore W.J. Swedlow J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 672-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Aurora A exerts its function at multiple steps during mitosis and is particularly important for centrosome maturation and spindle assembly (2Barr A.R. Gergely F. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2987-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Aurora B localizes to centromeres during prometaphase and is mainly responsible for chromosome bi-orientation (3Ruchaud S.

Recent evidence also suggests that Aurora A may directly participate in nuclear envelop breakdown (20Portier N. Audhya A. Maddox P.S. Green R.A. Dammermann A. Desai A. Oegema K. Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 515-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Besides its role in early mitotic phases, Aurora A also operate at other stages of mitosis including centrosome separation, spindle assembly, asymmetric cell division, and cell fate determination (2Barr A.R. Gergely F. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2987-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar).Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that Aurora A is an oncogene. Human Aurora A resides at chromosome 20q13, a region frequently amplified in breast cancers (21Sen S. Zhou H. White R.A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2195-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Aurora has also been identified in various tumors, and also leads to disruption of the spindle checkpoint and causes cells to become resistant to anti-mitotic agents (7Bischoff J.R.

Cellular studies also demonstrate that overexpression of Aurora A leads to genomic instability and aneuploidy (8Zhou H. Kuang J. Zhong L. Kuo W.L. Gray J.W. Sahin A. Brinkley B.R. Sen S. Nat.

Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 51-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), further lending credence to the claim that Aurora A promotes tumor formation. Many inhibitors of Aurora kinases have been designed and their potency in preventing tumor growth has been tested widely both in vitro and in vivo (23Agnese V. Bazan V. Fiorentino F.P. Fanale D.

Cancer Res. 2006; 12: 6869-6875Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). VX-680, one of the first Aurora inhibitors, was shown several years ago to be an effective anti-tumor agent in xenograft models and eradicate leukemia cells (25Harrington E.A. Bebbington D. Moore J. Rasmussen R.K. Ajose-Adeogun A.O. Nakayama T. Graham J.A. Demur C. Hercend T. Diu-Hercend A. Su M. Golec J.M. Miller K.M. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). VX-680 binds to the ATP binding cleft of the kinase domain, which is shared in all 3 Aurora kinases, thus inhibiting kinase activity. Because Aurora A is highly expressed in tumors, it is believed that these small molecule inhibitors of Aurora kinases could be potent anti-cancer agents. Indeed, multiple clinical trials have been initiated studying the efficacy of these inhibitors in AML, colon cancer, and gleevec-resistant CML (26Gautschi O. Heighway J. Mack P.C. Purnell P.R.

Blood. 2007; 109: 500-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar).Although Aurora A has been studied for many years, most of the knowledge was obtained in vitro based on cell culture studies. To understand the physiological function of Aurora A in vivo, we generated Aurora A knock-out mice (maintained by L. Y. and K. M.-D.). Aurora A deletion in mice results in embryonic lethality. Surprisingly and interestingly, heterozygous mice develop spontaneous tumors at a higher incidence than wild type mice, suggesting that Aurora A may also act as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor. The implication of this study will be discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of Aurora A Heterozygous Mutant Mice—Gene trap ES cell XQ0149 was obtained from Bay Genomics. The insertion site of the gene trap vector was mapped using genomic PCR and sequencing. Chimeras were generated through blastocyst injection of ES cells and germlined chimeras were backcrossed to C57BL/6 to obtain mice heterozygous for Aurora A. We established a colony of Aurora A+/+ and Aurora A+/- mice and maintained them on a normal diet. We euthanized mice ranging from 50 to 70 weeks by CO2 asphyxiation and subjected them to necroscopy. Tissue samples were collected and fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin blocks prior to cutting and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Statistical analysis was performed using chi-square analysis.In Vitro Culture and Genotyping of Preimplantation Embryos—Preimplantation embryos were obtained from intercross of mice heterozygous for Aurora A. E3.5 embryos were flushed out of the uterus using M2 medium (Sigma) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 4 mm glutamine, and 103 unit/ml recombinant LIF. Nested PCR was used to genotype the embryos using the methods described previously (28Li T. Inoue A. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3188-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) with the following primers.

RNA was extracted from embryos using TRIzol reagents, and cDNA was generated using SuperScript III (Invitrogen). Nested PCR was used to amplify the cDNA of WT and KO alleles with the following primers: first round sense primer for both WT and KO, 5′-ACATCCTCAGGCTGTATGGCTATTT-3′; second round sense primer for both WT and KO, 5′-CGCCACCCGAGTTTATCTGATTCTA-3′; antisense primers for WT for both rounds, 5′-CCGTTTGAGCCAAGCAGTAAGTTCT-3′; antisense primers for KO for both rounds, 5′-ATCCGCCACATATCCTGATCTTCCA-3′.Antibodies, Western Blotting, and Immunostaining—Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were lysed in NETN (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) on ice. Crude cell lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min and cleared lysates were collected. Samples were boiled in 2× Laemmli buffer and run on SDS-PAGE. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk-TBST and then probed with antibodies as indicated. Aurora A antibody was raised in rabbit against mouse Aurora A (residues 1–11). Monoclonal β-actin was purchased from Sigma. Standard immunostaining procedures were used. Anti-phosphorylated histone H3 Ser10 antibody were obtained from Millipore and anti-α-tubulin antibody was from Sigma.Flow Cytometry and Metaphase Spread—For analyzing cell cycle profiles, cells were harvested and fixed in 70% ethanol overnight. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in 40 μg/ml propidium iodide and 100 μg/ml RNase A for 30 min. DNA content was then analyzed using the BD LSR II system. Doublet discrimination was done before the analysis. For metaphase spread, cells were incubated with 50 ng/ml colcemid (Invitrogen) for 12 h. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with 75 mm KCl for 15 min. They were fixed in Carnoy's solution (75% methanol and 25% acidic acid) and a 15-μl aliquot was dropped onto a pre-cleaned slide, which was stained with 5% Giemsa solution (Invitrogen). Chromosome numbers were determined under light microscope.Drug Treatment—VX-680 was synthesized by Ryss Lab Inc., and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at a concentration of 2 mm. For all studies, 100 nm VX-680 was used and incubated with cells for 72 h.RESULTSGeneration of Aurora A Knock-out Mice—To study the physiological function of Aurora A in vivo, the gene trap ES cell clone XQ0149, in which a copy of Aurora A was disrupted by a gene trap vector inserted at intron 6 (Fig. 1a), was used to generate Aurora A knock-out mice. The exact position of gene trap vector integration was identified through genomic PCR and sequencing. Chimeras were generated through standard blastocyst injection and mice heterozygous for Aurora A were obtained by backcrossing the chimeras with C57BL/6 mice. We predicted a fusion product of the N terminus of Aurora A and β-geo from the gene trap integration site, however, we did not detect any fusion protein using β-galactosidase antibody or truncated protein using Aurora A N-terminal antibody in the heterozygous mice (data not shown), suggesting that the gene trap vector totally abolished the proper expression from the targeted Aurora A allele and this is virtually an Aurora A null allele.Aurora A Null Embryos Fail to Survive Due to a Defect in Mitosis—Intercross from heterozygous mice yielded no mice with Aurora A-/- genotype, suggesting that Aurora A null mice were embryonic lethal. The death occurred at early stages of embryonic development as no Aurora A null embryos could be obtained at 10.5 day post coitum (Fig. 1c). We then attempted to collect pre-implantation embryos at 3.5 dpc. We consistently found some abnormal embryos that contain much fewer cells than other normal morula or blastocyst stage embryos. Genotyping indicated that all of them, but none of the normal ones were null for Aurora A (Fig. 1B). Reverse transcriptase-PCR also confirmed that these abnormal embryos did not contain any wild-type Aurora A mRNA (Fig. 1D). The cell number varies from 8 to 16 in these abnormal embryos (normal embryos have more than 50 cells at this stage), which suggested that they were developmentally delayed or arrested. Embryos were then cultured in vitro for 3 days. Normal embryos grew normally, hatched from zona pellucida and flattened, whereas none of the abnormal embryos showed significant growth and they finally died (Fig. 2A). This observation suggested that the Aurora A null embryos were arrested before 16-cell stages of development.FIGURE 2Aurora A homozygous mutant could not survive after 16-cell stage.a, embryos harvested at E3.5 from heterozygous mutant intercross were cultured and imaged for three consecutive days. Typical pictures of abnormal and normal embryos are shown. Morphology and genotypes of all embryos cultured are summarized in the table below. b and c, embryos harvested at E3.5 from heterozygous mutant intercross were stained with antibody against phosphorylated histone H3 serine 10 (pH3), Aurora A, or α-tubulin.

DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As Aurora A is one of the key kinases during mitosis, we speculated that Aurora A null embryos might have problems during mitosis, which would lead to their growth arrest. We stained phospho-histone H3 serine 10, a mitotic marker, in these 3.5 day post coitum embryos. Normal embryos consistently showed strong staining in some cells that were in mitotic phase. However, none of these abnormal embryos displayed any staining (Fig. 2B). Although the numbers of cells are fewer in these abnormal embryos, which could decrease the chance of identifying mitotic cells among them, consistent absence of phospho-histone H3 serine 10 staining indicated that cells in these abnormal embryos may have a problem in proper cell cycle progression. To further dissect the problems in these abnormal embryos, we stained mitotic spindles using antibody against α-tubulin. Intact spindles could be found in some cells of normal embryos; however, none of the abnormal embryos contain any assembled spindles, indicating that these embryos do not have proper spindle assembly (Fig. 2C).Aurora A+/-Mice Develop Spontaneous Tumors—Although Aurora A deficiency leads to early embryonic lethality, Aurora A+/- mice were born healthy and fertile with no obvious effects, albeit a slight decrease in Aurora A levels compared with Aurora A wild type mice (Fig. 3a). Given the requirement of Aurora A for early embryogenesis and normal cell cycle progression, it is possible that loss of one Aurora A allele might cause problems in proper cell cycle control. Such defects could lead to chromosomal instability and even promote tumorigenesis in these Aurora A+/- mice. To test whether this is the case, we established a cohort of Aurora A+/+ and Aurora A+/- mice. We euthanized animals ranging from 50 to 70 weeks and performed necroscopies searching for tumors in these mice. The average age at euthanasia for these mice were 57.4 weeks for the Aurora A+/+ mice and 56.7 weeks for the Aurora A+/- mice (supplemental Table S1). Quite dramatically, Aurora A+/- mice developed tumors at a higher frequency of 25.5% compared with 8.8% in Aurora A+/+ mice (Fig. 3B). This 3-fold higher tumor incidence is statistically significant (p < 0.001). The tumors found in Aurora A+/- mice were in various organs including thymus, lung, liver, and lymph node. For example, a lymphoma in the thymus and an adenocarcinoma in the lung were observed in one of the Aurora A+/- mice (Fig. 3C). Most tumors were lymphoma that invaded into the lung, with one squamous cell carcinoma, and one liver hepatoma, but surprisingly 5 lung carcinomas were also discovered (Table 1).FIGURE 3Aurora A heterozygotes develop spontaneous tumors.a, the level of Aurora A was decreased in heterozygous MEF. Cell lysates were blotted with the indicated antibody. b, Aurora A+/+ and Aurora+/- mice were euthanized between the ages of 50 and 70 weeks and underwent necroscopy. Statistical analysis was done using the chi-square test. c, shown are an adenocarcinoma in the lung (right arrow) and a lymphoma in the thymus (left arrow) of an Aurora A+/- mouse.

No double knock-out animals were generated when Aurora A+/- p53-/- animals were intercrossed suggesting that this lethality cannot be rescued by p53 loss (data not shown).As we speculated, the observed increased tumor incidence in Aurora A+/- mice could potentially be caused by chromosomal instability because Aurora A is critically important for mitotic transitions. To directly document chromosomal instability in Aurora A+/- cells, we generated Aurora A+/+ and Aurora A+/- MEFs from 13.5 day post coitum embryos. Analysis of DNA content using flow cytometry suggested that Aurora A+/- MEFs had 70% more cells containing >4N content. They also had a slightly but consistently higher percentage of cells with 4N content than their wild type counterparts, suggesting mild mitotic delay in these cells (Fig. 4a). We further determined chromosome numbers in these MEFs and discovered that Aurora A+/- MEFs consistently contain a higher percentage of cells with aneuploidy (Fig. 4, b and c). The chromosomal instability displayed in Aurora A+/- MEFs can potentially explain the higher tumor incidence in Aurora A+/- mice, because aneuploidy or chromosomal instability is known to contribute to tumorigenesis. Collectively our results indicate that Aurora A is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and may function as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor.FIGURE 4Reduction in Aurora A level or activity leads to increase of aneuploidy.a, cell cycle profiles of passage 2 Aurora A+/+ or Aurora+/- MEFs were determined using flow cytometry. b, metaphase spreads of normal karyotype in Aurora A+/+ MEFs and aneuploidy in Aurora A+/- MEFs. c, Aurora A+/- MEFs have increased aneuploidy. Chromosomes from 100 metaphase spreads were counted in each sample. d, passage 2 wild type MEF were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide or 100 nm VX-680 for 72 h and cell cycle profiles were determined using flow cytometry. e, metaphase spreads of wild type MEF after treatment of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or 100 nm VX-680 for 72 h. f, increased aneuploidy in wild type cells after VX-680 treatment.

Because of the potency of these inhibitors in xenograft studies, some of these inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for cancer treatment (26Gautschi O. Heighway J. Mack P.C. Purnell P.R. Lara Jr., P.N. Gandara D.R. Clin. Cancer Res. 2008; 14: 1639-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). However, our study using Aurora A+/- cells and mice suggest that partial inactivation of Aurora A might lead to chromosomal instability and increased tumor incidence. Therefore, we decided to examine whether these Aurora kinase inhibitors would have any potentially side effects on normal cells.VX-680 binds to the ATP binding region of the Aurora kinase, thereby trapping it in an inactive state (31Cheetham G.M. Charlton P.A. Golec J.M. Pollard J.R. Cancer Lett. 2007; 251: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Cells treated with VX680 displayed mitotic defects, similar to those observed in our Aurora A+/- mice or cells. To directly address whether VX-680 can cause mitotic defects in normal cells, we examined chromosomal instability and cell cycle progression in cells treated with VX-680. MEFs were cultured with 100 nm VX-680 for 72 h and the DNA content of the cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. We found that treatment with 100 nm VX-680 led to a significant increase in mitotic cells, indicating a slower mitotic progression in the presence of this inhibitor. The percentage of cells carrying >4 N DNA content was also dramatically increased, suggesting that these cells are aneuploid (Fig. 4d), which were further confirmed by metaphase spread showing a significant increase of cells with aneuploidy, particularly polyploidy, after VX-680 treatment (Fig. 4, e and f). Taken together, these data suggest that VX-680 exerts its inhibitory effect not only on tumor cells, but also on wild type cells, whereas loss or reduced Aurora kinase activity could lead to chromosomal instability and potentially tumorigenesis.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we demonstrate that Aurora A is crucial for embryonic development and cell cycle progression. Moreover, partial loss of Aurora A function promotes tumor progression as Aurora A+/- mice have an almost 3-fold higher tumor incidence and cells from these mice harbor aneuploidy and chromosomal instability, hallmarks of genomic instability that would lead to tumorigenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2024064726,"FBI-1 (also called Pokemon/ZBTB7A) is a BTB/POZ-domain Krüppel-like zinc-finger transcription factor. Recently, FBI-1 was characterized as a proto-oncogenic protein, which represses tumor suppressor ARF gene transcription. The expression of FBI-1 is increased in many cancer tissues. We found that FBI-1 potently represses transcription of the Rb gene, a tumor suppressor gene important in cell cycle arrest. FBI-1 binds to four GC-rich promoter elements (FREs) located at bp –308 to –188 of the Rb promoter region. The Rb promoter also contains two Sp1 binding sites: GC-box 1 (bp –65 to –56) and GC-box 2 (bp –18 to –9), the latter of which is also bound by FBI-1. We found that FRE3 (bp –244 to –236) is also a Sp1 binding element. FBI-1 represses transcription of the Rb gene not only by binding to the FREs, but also by competing with Sp1 at the GC-box 2 and the FRE3. By binding to the FREs and/or the GC-box, FBI-1 represses transcription of the Rb gene through its POZ-domain, which recruits a co-repressor-histone deacetylase complex and deacetylates histones H3 and H4 at the Rb gene promoter.

Oncogene. 2006; 25 (review): 5302-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar and references therein). Rb suppresses tumorigenesis by inhibiting cell cycle progression at G1/S by preventing the transcription of several genes important in cell cycle control (5Goodrich D.W. Wang N.P. Qian Y.W. Lee E.Y. Lee W.H. Cell. 1991; 67: 293-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Rb is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner (6Khidr L. Chen P.L. Oncogene. 2006; 25 (review): 5210-5219Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar and references therein). When Rb is hypophosphorylated, it forms complexes with E2F family proteins and inhibits transcription by recruiting proteins involved in transcriptional repression (7Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). Once phosphorylated, Rb can no longer form complexes with E2F proteins. E2F proteins, upon dimerization with their differentiation-regulated transcription factor partners, are capable of activating the expression of a number of genes that are likely to regulate or promote entry into S phase (6Khidr L.

In contrast, YY1 and MIZF repress transcription of Rb, and this repression is important for inhibiting myogenesis (10Deléhouzée S. Yoshikawa T. Sawa C. Sawada J. Ito T. Omori M. Wada T.

We have been investigating the biological functions of FBI-1 (also called Pokemon/ZBTB7A), which contains a BTB/POZ-domain at its N terminus and Krüppel-like zinc fingers at its C terminus (13Morrison D.J.

FBI-1 stimulates the Tat activity of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 long terminal repeat and represses human ADH5/FDH gene expression by interacting with Sp1 zinc fingers (14Lee D.K. Suh D.

The rat homolog of FBI-1, OCZF, is a transcriptional repressor and is involved in osteoclastogenesis (19Kukita A. Kukita T. Ouchida M. Maeda H. Yatsuki H. Kohashi O. Blood. 1999; 94: 1987-1997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FBI-1 enhances NF-κB-mediated transcription through an interaction between the POZ-domain of FBI-1 and the RHD of NF-κB (20Lee D.K. Kang J.E. Park H.J. Kim M.H. Yim T.H. Kim J.M. Heo M.K. Kim K.Y. Kwon H.J. Hur M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27783-27791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recently, FBI-1 was identified as a proto-oncogene (21Maeda T. Hobbs R.M. Merghoub T. Guernah I. Zelent A. Cordon-Cardo C. Teruya-Feldstein J. Pandolfi P.P. Nature. 2005; 433: 278-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Serial analysis of gene expression analysis showed that the expression of FBI-1 is increased in cancer tissues. In transgenic mice overexpressing FBI-1, FBI-1 represses transcription of tumor suppressor gene, ARF, by binding to its promoter region. The product of ARF is a transcriptional activator of p53, another tumor suppressor. Thus, repression of ARF can eventually inhibit expression of p53, promoting oncogenesis in the thymus, liver, and spleen. In FBI-1 knockout mice, overexpression of ARF increases expression of p53, induces senescence, apoptosis, and eventually blocks cellular differentiation (21Maeda T. Hobbs R.M. Merghoub T. Guernah I. Zelent A. Cordon-Cardo C. Teruya-Feldstein J. Pandolfi P.P. Nature. 2005; 433: 278-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). FBI-1 is overexpressed in solid tumors, such as cancers of the colon and bladder, in which the normal function of the ARF/p53 pathway is frequently lost. It is likely that FBI-1 has multiple additional target genes by which it can exert oncogenic activity (22Maeda T. Hobbs R.M. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8575-8578Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar and references therein). We suspected that FBI-1 might be involved in the transcriptional regulation of the genes involved in differentiation, cell cycle control, and tumor suppression, such as Rb. We found that the Rb gene is the molecular target of proto-oncogene FBI-1, and we investigated the molecular mechanism of transcriptional regulation in detail.

The FBI-1 expression vector in Drosophila SL2 cells was prepared by cloning FBI-1 cDNA into pPac-PL provided by Dr. Carl Thummel (University of Utah). pPac-Sp1 was provided by Dr. Robert Tjian (University of California, Berkeley, CA). Cell Culture/Stable Cell Line—HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Stable HeLa cells overexpressing FBI-1 were prepared by transfecting HeLa cells with a recombinant Lenti virus, LentiM1.4-FBI-1-FLAG. Control stable cells were prepared using recombinant LentiM1.4-LacZ virus. Drosophila SL2 cells were cultured in Schneider's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transcription Analysis of the Rb Gene Promoter—HeLa, HCT116, and HEK 293A cells were cultured with the medium recommended by the ATCC (Manassas, VA) on 6-well culture vessels and were transfected with 0.3 μg of pGL2-Rb-Luc Wt or mutants and 0.5 μg each of pcDNA3.0, pcDNA3.0-FBI-1, and pcDNA3.0-FBI-1ΔPOZ using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen). After 36 h of incubation, cells were harvested, lysed, and assayed for luciferase activities. Luciferase activity was normalized with the protein concentration of the lysate. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—EMSAs were carried out as described previously (24Lee J.A. Suh D.C. Kang J.E. Kim M.H. Park H. Lee M.N. Kim J.M. Jeon B.N. Roh H.E. Yu M.Y. Choi K.Y. Kim K.Y.

Binding reactions were carried out in 20 μl of binding buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 5 μm ZnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% bovine serum albumin, 7% glycerol, 0.1 μg of recombinant FBI-1ZFDBD or Sp1ZFDBD, and 10,000 cpm of probe at room temperature for 30 min. Antibodies against GST-Tag, FBI-1, or Xpress were added to binding reactions for supershift of the probe-protein complex. The sequences of FREs and Sp1-binding GC-box oligonucleotides were as follows (only the top strand sequences are shown): FRE1, 5′-GATCGGATGAGGCCCACAGTCACC-3′; FRE2, 5′-GATCCCACAGTCACCCACCAGACT-3′; FRE3, 5′-GATCAGGGGGTGGTTCTGGGTAGA-3′; FRE4, 5′-GATCCGCCTGGACCCACGCCAGGT-3′; GC-box 1, 5′-GATCACGGGCGGAAGTGAC-3′; and GC-box 2, 5′-GATCAGTTGCCGGGCGGGGGAGGG-3′. Site-directed Mutagenesis of the Rb Promoter—To investigate the role of FBI-1 binding sites on transcription, mutations were introduced into the promoter sequence using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The core GGG of the binding sequences (5′-GDGGGYYYY-3′) of the FREs and the GC-boxes was replaced with AAA using the following mutagenesis oligonucleotides primers (only the top strands are shown): mFRE1, 5′-CCCGGGATAGGGATGAAATTTACAGTCACCCACCAGA-3′; mFRE2, 5′-ATGAGGCCCA; CAGTCATTTACCAGACTCTTTGTAT-3′; mFRE3, 5′-CACCCCGGCCTGGAGGAAAAAATTCTGGGTAGAAGCAC-3′; mFRE4, 5′-CTGGAAGGCGCCTGGATTTACGCCAGGTTTC; CCAG-3′; mGC-Box 1, 5′-ACGTGACGCCGCGGGCAAAAGTGACGTTTTCCCG-3′; and mGC-Box 2, 5′-CGCTCAGTTGCCGGGCAAGGGAGGGCGCGTCCGG-3′. Mammalian Two-hybrid Assays—African green monkey kidney cells (CV-1) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). CV-1 cells were transiently transfected with pCMX-Gal4-POZFBI-1, pCMX-VP16-BCoR, pCMX-VP16-NCoR, pCMX-VP16-SMRT, and pG5-Luc using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured for 36 h. The cells were then harvested, lysed, and analyzed for luciferase activity on a luminometer (Microplate Luminometer LB 96V, EG&G Berthold, MD). Luciferase activity was normalized with the cotransfected β-galactosidase activity or protein concentration. GST Fusion Protein Pulldown Assays—Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), transformed with either GST or GST fusion protein expression vector, was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37°C. After E. coli pellets were lysed and sonicated in lysis buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme), recombinant proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-agarose 4 beads (Peptron, Daejeon, Korea). Purified proteins were resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel to quantitate them and assess their purity. The same volume of protein-agarose bead complex was used for all GST fusion protein pulldown assays. Co-repressor proteins were prepared in vitro by incubating 1 μg of the pcDNA3.0 co-repressor expression vector with TnT Quick-coupled Transcription/Translation Extract (Promega), containing 40 μl of TnT Quick Master Mix and 2 μl of [35S]methionine (1175.0 Ci/mol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 30 °C for 90 min. Purified GST fusion proteins (5 μg) were incubated with GSH-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C in HEMG buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture (1 tablet/50 ml)). After agarose-GST protein complexes were washed, 10 μl of in vitro translated [35S]methionine-co-repressor was added, and this mixture was incubated in HEMG buffer for 4 h at 4°C. The reactions mixtures were centrifuged, and the pellets were washed thoroughly with cold binding buffer. Bound proteins were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, and the gels were exposed to x-ray film using an image-intensifying screen (Kodak). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—The binding of FBI-1 to the FRE elements on the Rb promoter in vivo was analyzed by ChIP assays. Sub-confluent HeLa cells on a 10-cm dish were transfected with 3μg of pcDNA3.0 or pcDNA3.0-FBI-1-FLAG using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) and grown for an additional 48 h. The HeLa cells were treated with formaldehyde (final 1%) to cross-link FBI-1totheRbpromoter. The remainder of the ChIP assay procedure was performed as reported previously (14Lee D.K. Suh D. Edenberg H.J. Hur M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26761-26768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To amplify the proximal and distal promoter regions of the Rb gene, PCR reactions of the immunoprecipitated DNA were carried out using the following sets of oligonucleotide primers: distal FRE region (bp –370 to –147: forward primer, 5′-CACTAGCCAGATATTCCCTGCGGGG-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-TAAGTCATGAGGAATTAAACTGGGA-3′), proximal GC-box/FRE region (bp –131 to +93: forward primer, 5′-CACCGACCAGCGCCCCAGTTCCCCA-3′andreverseprimer, 5′-GGGAGGACGCGCGCGCACGTCG-3′) and downstream 3′ UTR region (bp +176326 to +176626: forward primer, 5′-GGATCTCAGGACCTTGGTGG-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-AGGGCCATTCTTACTATCCA-3′). The binding competition between FBI-1 and Sp1 on the Rb promoter in vivo were analyzed by ChIP assays in the HEK293A cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-FBI-1 expression vector (1, 2, and 4 μg) or knockdown siRNA and also in Drosophila SL2 cells. Drosophila SL2 cells lacking mammalian transcription factors were transfected with pGL2-Rb-Luc, pPac-PL, pPac-Sp1 (2 μg), and pPac-FBI-1 (1, 2, 4 μg) using Cellfectin (Invitrogen) and grown for an additional 48 h. The cells were fixed with formaldehyde (final 1%) to cross-link FBI-1 and Sp1 protein onto the Rb promoter. The remaining ChIP procedure was performed as described previously (14Lee D.K. Suh D. Edenberg H.J. Hur M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26761-26768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). PCR was performed using the following cycling conditions: denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and a final extension reaction at 72 °C for 5 min. We investigated whether co-repressor (BCoR) binding to the Rb promoter is dependent on FBI-1 using ChIP. HEK293A cells grown on 10-cm dishes were transfected with pcDNA3-FLAG-FBI-1 (3 μg) and/or pCMV-BCoR (3 μg). Chromatins were immunoprecipitated using anti-Myc or anti-FLAG antibody; the remaining ChIP procedures were performed as described above. Oligonucleotide primers used to amplify the distal FRE cluster region (bp –370 to –147) are described above. We also investigated whether the acetylation status of histones H3 and H4 of nucleosomes at the proximal Rb gene promoter are modified by ectopic FBI-1 using antibodies specific to Ac-Histone H3 and Ac-Histone H4 (Upstate). The oligonucleotide primers used to amplify the Rb gene promoter region (bp –133 to +167) flanking the transcription start site were as follows: forward, 5′-CACCGACCAGCGCCCCAGTTCCCCA-3′; reverse, 5′-CCTGACGAGAGGCAGGTCCT-3′. Knockdown of FBI-1 mRNA by siRNA—The siRNAs designed to knock down glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and FBI-1 were purchased from Ambion Inc. (Austin, TX). Their sequences were as follows: siFBI-1 #1, 5′-GCUGGACCUUGUAGAUCAAtt-3′ and 5′-UUGAUCUACAAGGUCCAGCtt-3′; siFBI-1 #2, 5′-AGUACCUCGAGUUCUUCCAtt-3 and 5′-UGGAAGAACUCGAGGUACUtt-3′. The siRNAs for FBI-1 (20 ng of each) were transfected into 6 × 106 HEK293A cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After culturing for 72 h, cells were harvested, and analyzed for protein and mRNA expression by Western blot and RT-PCR, respectively. Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—The FLAG-FBI-1 and Myc-BCoR expression vectors were co-transfected, and cells were washed, pelleted, and resuspended in lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100). Cell lysates were pre-cleared, and the supernatant was incubated with anti-Myc antibody on a rotating platform overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Beads were collected, washed, and resuspended in equal volume of 5× SDS loading buffer (10% SDS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.05% Bromphenol Blue). Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was performed as described under “Western Blot Analysis.” Reverse Transcription and PCR—Total RNA was isolated from the cells using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen). The DNAs were synthesized in a 20-μl reaction tube containing 5 μg of total RNA, 10 pmol of random hexamer, and 200 units of superscript reverse transcriptase II. PCR cycling conditions were as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, 23 cycles of at 94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 40 s, and a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The PCR primers used for FBI-1 cDNA were 5′-GGCCTGCTGTGCGACGTGGT-3′ and 5′-CAGCAGGCGGGCGGCGCTGA-3′. The primers for Rb were 5′-AAAGAAAAAGGAACTGTGGG-3′ and 5′-AACTGCTGGGTTGTGTCAAA-3′. The primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ and 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′. Western Blot Analysis of Rb and FBI-1—Cells were harvested and lysed in TEN buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 m NaCl). Cell extracts (40 μg) were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to Immun-Blot™ polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), and blocked with 5% skim milk (BD Biosciences) in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, and 0.001% Tween 20) for 10 min. Blotted membranes were incubated with Ab-FBI-1 overnight at 4 °C (Abcam), Ab-Rb (BD Biosciences), GAPDH (Calbiochem), and Ab-α-tubulin (Calbiochem). Membranes were further incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Vector) or anti-rabbit IgG (Vector) or anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and developed with ECL reagents (PerkinElmer). C2C12 Myoblast Cell Culture, Differentiation, and Western Blot Analysis—Mouse C2C12 myoblast cells were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Stable C2C12 cells overexpressing FBI-1 were prepared by transfecting C2C12 cells with a recombinant LentiM1.4-FBI-1-FLAG virus. To induce differentiation of the C2C12 cells into myotubes, medium was switched to DMEM with 2% horse serum as described elsewhere (12Sekimata M. Homma Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). For the Rb rescue experiment, recombinant adenovirus overexpression Rb was purchased from Vector Biolabs (Philadelphia, PA) and infected at 100 multiplicity of infection. FBI-1 Represses Transcription of the Rb Gene—FBI-1 shows proto-oncogenic activity by repressing the expression of the tumor suppressor ARF gene (21Maeda T. Hobbs R.M. Merghoub T. Guernah I. Zelent A. Cordon-Cardo C. Teruya-Feldstein J. Pandolfi P.P. Nature. 2005; 433: 278-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). We suspected that ARF might not be the only target gene of transcription repression and that FBI-1 may have multiple additional target genes by which it can exert oncogenic activity (22Maeda T. Hobbs R.M. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8575-8578Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar and references therein). We investigated whether other tumor suppressor genes, such as the Rb gene, which is critically involved in cell cycle control and tumor suppression, is the target of FBI-1. Using the recently characterized FBI-1 consensus sequence, we identified four potential FBI-1 binding sites (FRE) on the Rb promoter. The four potential FREs are GC-rich and have varying degrees of homology with the consensus FRE sequence with either perfect homology or with one or two mismatches (Fig. 1A) (21Maeda T. Hobbs R.M. Merghoub T. Guernah I. Zelent A. Cordon-Cardo C. Teruya-Feldstein J. Pandolfi P.P. Nature. 2005; 433: 278-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 26Pessler F. Hernandez N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29327-29335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We transiently co-transfected HeLa cells with two FBI-1 expression plasmids (pcDNA3-FBI-1 and pcDNA3-FBI-1ΔPOZ) and the pGL2-Rb-Luc plasmid, and analyzed the luciferase activity of these transfected cells. FBI-1 repressed transcription of Rb by >50% relative to the control. FBI-1 lacking the POZ-domain had a much weaker effect, repressing the transcription of Rb by 18% relative to the control, suggesting that the POZ-domain is important in transcriptional repression of Rb gene (Fig. 1B). In HeLa cells, human papilloma virus E7 is known to influence the activity of Rb. One may argue that FBI-1 affects papilloma virus E7 and thereby affects Rb expression. Consequently, we carried out transcription assays in human colon cancer HCT116 cells and HEK293A cells, which do not have papilloma virus E7. In these two cell types, FBI-1 also repressed Rb gene transcription, suggesting that FBI-1 directly acts on the Rb promoter to repress transcription (Fig. 1B). We also investigated whether FBI-1 represses Rb gene expression in stable HeLa and HCT116 cells overexpressing FBI-1 due to transfection with the recombinant control Lentivirus, LentiM1.4-FBI-1-FLAG. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis showed that FBI-1 decreased the mRNA and protein levels of the Rb gene, respectively, compared with those of the control cells transfected with the control Lentivirus-LacZ virus (Fig. 1, C and D, and supplement Fig. S1). Alternatively, we tried to show whether knockdown of endogenous FBI-1 mRNA expression could increase transcription of Rb by removing the transcription repression by FBI-1. Successful knockdown of endogenous FBI-1 mRNA by RNA interference using two independent siRNAs resulted in an increase in Rb gene transcription (Fig. 1E). RT-PCR and Western blots showed that siRNA treatment resulted in a significant decrease in endogenous FBI-1 mRNA and FBI-1 protein and a concomitant increase in Rb mRNA and protein expression, respectively (Fig. 1, E–G).

https://openalex.org/W2095239148,"Elafin is a neutrophil serine protease inhibitor expressed in lung and displaying anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties. Previous studies demonstrated that some innate host defense molecules of the cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease airways are impaired due to increased proteolytic degradation observed during lung inflammation. In light of these findings, we thus focused on the status of elafin in CF lung. We showed in the present study that elafin is cleaved in sputum from individuals with CF. Pseudomonas aeruginosa-positive CF sputum, which was found to contain lower elafin levels and higher neutrophil elastase (NE) activity compared with P. aeruginosa-negative samples, was particularly effective in cleaving recombinant elafin. NE plays a pivotal role in the process as only NE inhibitors are able to inhibit elafin degradation. Further in vitro studies demonstrated that incubation of recombinant elafin with excess of NE leads to the rapid cleavage of the inhibitor. Two cleavage sites were identified at the N-terminal extremity of elafin (Val-5—Lys-6 and Val-9—Ser-10). Interestingly, purified fragments of the inhibitor (Lys-6—Gln-57 and Ser-10—Gln-57) were shown to still be active for inhibiting NE. However, NE in excess was shown to strongly diminish the ability of elafin to bind lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and its capacity to be immobilized by transglutamination. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that elafin is cleaved by its cognate enzyme NE present at excessive concentration in CF sputum and that P. aeruginosa infection promotes this effect. Such cleavage may have repercussions on the innate immune function of elafin. Elafin is a neutrophil serine protease inhibitor expressed in lung and displaying anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties. Previous studies demonstrated that some innate host defense molecules of the cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease airways are impaired due to increased proteolytic degradation observed during lung inflammation. In light of these findings, we thus focused on the status of elafin in CF lung. We showed in the present study that elafin is cleaved in sputum from individuals with CF. Pseudomonas aeruginosa-positive CF sputum, which was found to contain lower elafin levels and higher neutrophil elastase (NE) activity compared with P. aeruginosa-negative samples, was particularly effective in cleaving recombinant elafin. NE plays a pivotal role in the process as only NE inhibitors are able to inhibit elafin degradation. Further in vitro studies demonstrated that incubation of recombinant elafin with excess of NE leads to the rapid cleavage of the inhibitor. Two cleavage sites were identified at the N-terminal extremity of elafin (Val-5—Lys-6 and Val-9—Ser-10). Interestingly, purified fragments of the inhibitor (Lys-6—Gln-57 and Ser-10—Gln-57) were shown to still be active for inhibiting NE. However, NE in excess was shown to strongly diminish the ability of elafin to bind lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and its capacity to be immobilized by transglutamination. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that elafin is cleaved by its cognate enzyme NE present at excessive concentration in CF sputum and that P. aeruginosa infection promotes this effect. Such cleavage may have repercussions on the innate immune function of elafin. Elafin is a cationic 6-kDa non-glycosylated serine protease inhibitor belonging to the chelonianins, a distinct family of the canonical inhibitors also including secretory leukoprotease inhibitor (SLPI) 2The abbreviations used are: SLPI, secretory leukoprotease inhibitor; AAT, α1-antitrypsin; CF, cystic fibrosis; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MeOSuc-AAPV-CMK, N-(methoxysuccinyl)-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-chloromethyl ketone; MeOSuc-AAPV-pNA, N-(methoxysuccinyl)-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val para-nitroanilide; NE, neutrophil elastase; TLCK, Nα-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone hydrochloride; TPCK, N-p-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone; IL, interleukin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PBS-T, PBS-Tween; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; ECM, extracellular matrix. . It is also known as SKALP (skin-derived anti-leukoprotease) or ESI (elastase-specific inhibitor). The molecule displays a compact structure maintained by four conserved disulfide bridges characteristic of WAP (whey acidic protein) family and shares 40% sequence identity with SLPI. In addition to its ability to inhibit porcine pancreatic elastase, elafin is a potent inhibitor of two neutrophil serine proteases, neutrophil elastase (NE) and proteinase 3 (1Ying Q.L. Simon S.R.

Elafin is released by proteolytic cleavage from a larger molecule called trappin-2 or pre-elafin, which possesses at the N terminus of the whey acidic protein domain a cementoin domain containing several motifs having the consensus sequence GQDPVK that can act as transglutaminase substrate, allowing the cross-linking of the inhibitor to extracellular matrix proteins (3Molhuizen H.O.

It has been shown that tryptase, a mast cell-derived protease, may be involved in the proteolytic processing of trappin-2 into elafin (6Guyot N. Zani M.L. Berger P. Dallet-Choisy S. Moreau T. Biol. Chem. 2005; 386: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In vivo, elafin is mainly detected under inflammatory conditions, suggesting that the inhibitor is inducible. Several studies have demonstrated that elafin expression can be up-regulated in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (7Simpson A.J. Cunningham G.A. Porteous D.J. Haslett C.

Inflammatory cells such as alveolar macrophages (17Mihaila A. Tremblay G.M. Z. Naturforsch. 2001; 56: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and neutrophils (18Sallenave J.M. Si Tahar M. Cox G. Chignard M. Gauldie J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) have also been shown to express the inhibitor. In addition to an antiprotease property, it has recently been demonstrated that trappin-2 and elafin possess anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial activities. The two molecules display anti-bacterial activities against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram-negative) and Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive) (11Meyer-Hoffert U. Wichmann N. Schwichtenberg L. White P.C. Wiedow O. Exp. Dermatol. 2003; 12: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19Simpson A.J. Maxwell A.I. Govan J.R. Haslett C. Sallenave J.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), which appear to be independent of their anti-elastase activity or charge properties. In mice, trappin-2 has been shown to dose-dependently reduce LPS-induced neutrophil influx into alveoli in addition to inhibiting LPS-induced production of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and the potent neutrophil attractants Cxcl1 and Cxcl2 (chemokine ligands 1 and 2), suggesting an immunomodulatory role in innate immunity (20Vachon E. Bourbonnais Y. Bingle C.D. Rowe S.J. Janelle M.F. Tremblay G.M. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1249-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). By reducing NF-κB activation, trappin-2 has been demonstrated to attenuate IL-8 secretion by endothelial cells in response to various pro-inflammatory stimuli (TNF-α, LPS, oxidized low density lipoprotein) as well as LPS-induced TNF-α secretion by macrophages (21Henriksen P.A. Hitt M. Xing Z. Wang J. Haslett C. Riemersma R.A. Webb D.J. Kotelevtsev Y.V. Sallenave J.M. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 4535-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Recently, our group demonstrated that elafin inhibits the LPS-induced production of MCP-1 in monocytes by inhibiting AP-1 and NF-κB activation (22Butler M.W. Robertson I. Greene C.M. O'Neill S.J. Taggart C.C. McElvaney N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34730-34735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). During lung inflammation some components of the innate immune response have been shown to be sensitive to exacerbated host proteolytic activity emanating from dysregulated elastolytic enzymes (23Taggart C.C. Greene C.M. Carroll T.P. O'Neill S.J. McElvaney N.G. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2005; 171: 1070-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that elastolytic cysteine cathepsins present in the lung under inflammatory conditions are involved in the inactivation of several host defense molecules such as SLPI, defensins, and lactoferrin. Cysteine cathepsins were shown to cleave and inactivate SLPI and defensins (human β-defensin 1 and 3), respectively, in epithelial lining fluid from individuals with emphysema (24Taggart C.C. Lowe G.J. Greene C.M. Mulgrew A.T. O'Neill S.J. Levine R.L. McElvaney N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33345-33352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and CF (25Taggart C.C. Greene C.M. Smith S.G. Levine R.L. McCray Jr., P.B. O'Neill S. McElvaney N.G. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 931-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Additionally, lactoferrin degradation observed in P. aeruginosa-infected CF sputum was found to be due to an excess of cathepsin activity (26Rogan M.P. Taggart C.C. Greene C.M. Murphy P.G. O'Neill S.J. McElvaney N.G. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 190: 1245-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Furthermore, other elastolytic proteases are potentially involved in the cleavage and inactivation of host defense molecules. Pseudomonas elastase, also referred as pseudolysin, has been demonstrated to cleave SLPI (27Johnson D.A. Carter-Hamm B. Dralle W.M. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1982; 126: 1070-1073PubMed Google Scholar), and high concentrations of pseudolysin, Pseudomonas alkaline protease, and NE were also able to inactivate lactoferrin after a prolonged exposure (28Britigan B.E. Hayek M.B. Doebbeling B.N. Fick Jr., R.B. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 5049-5055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we demonstrate that levels of elafin are lower in P. aeruginosa-positive as opposed to P. aeruginosa-negative CF sputa and that recombinant elafin incubated in P. aeruginosa-positive CF sputa is rapidly cleaved. Our data provide evidence that NE is involved in the cleavage of elafin in CF sputum as only NE inhibitors are able to inhibit this process. Furthermore, NE activity is higher in P. aeruginosa-positive CF sputa compared with P. aeruginosa-negative sputa, confirming that the low levels of elafin observed in P. aeruginosa-positive CF sputa are due to elevated NE levels with subsequent increased cleavage of elafin. We also demonstrate that purified NE in excess can cleave elafin at two distinct sites in its N-terminal extremity and that both fragments of the inhibitor generated upon NE activity still retain inhibitory activity. Although NE preserves the antiprotease activity of elafin, we show on the other hand that the protease considerably affects the capacities of elafin to cross-link with fibronectin by transglutamination and to bind LPS. Materials—Recombinant human elafin was obtained from Proteo Biotech AG (Kiel, Germany). Goat anti-human elafin antibody and biotinylated anti-human elafin antibody were purchased from R&D Systems (Abingdon, Oxon, UK). Aprotinin, benzamidine, Pefabloc, Nα-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone hydrochloride (TLCK), N-p-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK), N-(methoxysuccinyl)-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-chloromethyl ketone (MeOSuc-AAPV-CMK), leupeptin, pepstatin A, EDTA N-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val p-nitroanilide (MeOSuc-AAPV-pNA), and guinea pig liver transglutaminase were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. α1-Antichymotrypsin, α1-antitrypsin, E-64, GM6001, phosphoramidon, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and plasma fibronectin were purchased from Merck. Human neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, and porcine pancreatic elastase were from Elastin Products Co., Inc. (Owensville, MO). Human proteinase 3 was from Athens Research (Athens, GA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin was obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate was purchased from Pierce. All other reagents were of analytical grade. CF Sputum Processing—The protocol for sputum processing was modified from that described elsewhere (29Pavord I.D. Pizzichini M.M. Pizzichini E. Hargreave F.E. Thorax. 1997; 52: 498-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Sputum was weighed and then treated with 4.5 volumes of normal saline per weight. Each sample was briefly vortexed and then rocked for 15 min at room temperature. An additional 4.5 volumes of normal saline were added to each sample and rocked for 5 min more. The sample was then filtered through sterile 48-μm nylon gauze, and the soluble sputum phase was obtained by centrifugation of the filtrate for 10 min at 790 × g. The supernatant was stored at −80 °C until required. Determination of Elafin Levels in CF Sputum by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—Goat anti-human elafin antibody (R&D Systems, AF1747, 1:500 in Voller's buffer, 100 μl per well) was added to Immunlon-2 plates and left overnight at 4 °C. The plate was washed 3 times with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and blocked in PBS-T containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. After washing 3 times in PBS-T, elafin standards (100 μl per well, concentration ranged from 62.5 to 20,000 pg/ml) and CF sputum samples (100 μl per well) were added to the plate for 2 h at room temperature. The plate was then washed, and biotinylated anti-human elafin antibody (R&D Systems, BAF1747, 1:250 in PBS-T, 100 μl per well) was added to the plate for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, the plate was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Zymed Laboratories Inc., 1:2500 in PBS-T, 100 μl per well) for 20 min at room temperature and washed with PBS-T. Peroxidase activity was measured by the addition of ABTS (100 μl per well) and reading the absorbance at 405 nm. Western Blot Analysis of Recombinant Elafin Incubated with CF Sputum and NE—Recombinant elafin (8.5 × 10–7 M) was incubated with 10 μl of CF sputum in 30 mm Tris-buffered saline to a final volume of 20 μl for 0, 10 min, 1 h, 6 h, or 24 h at 37 °C. In some cases, CF samples were preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C with the following protease inhibitor before adding elafin: 10 mm Pefabloc, 0.13 mm TLCK, 13 μm aprotinin, 0.6 mm leupeptin, 0.4 mm E-64, 0.4 mm pepstatin A, 13 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm GM6001 or 0.2 mm phosphoramidon, 0.3 mm TPCK, 3 mm benzamidine, 9 μm soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 μm α1-antitrypsin (AAT), 1 μm α1-antichymotrypsin, 4 μm SLPI, or 1 mm MeOSuc-AAPV-CMK. Additionally, recombinant elafin (8.5 × 10–7 m) was incubated with various concentrations of neutrophil elastase, proteinase 3, or cathepsin G (from 3.5 × 10–9 to 8.5 × 10–6 m) for 24 h in 0.1 m Hepes, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.5, in a 20-μl volume at 37 °C. All incubations were stopped by adding sample treatment buffer containing reducing or non-reducing agent and boiling samples for 5 min. Samples were separated by Tricine SDS-PAGE using a 17.5% polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto a 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Sigma-Aldrich). The membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Elafin was detected by using a biotinylated anti-elafin antibody (R&D Systems, 1:500, overnight at 4 °C) followed by peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Zymed Laboratories Inc., 1:2500, 20 min at room temperature). Peroxidase activity was detected with a chemiluminescent substrate (SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate, Pierce). HPLC Mass Spectrometry—Cleavages of elafin by neutrophil elastase were assessed by incubating recombinant elafin (1 μg; 4.1 × 10–6 m) with purified NE (10 μg; 8.3 × 10–6 m) for 1 h in 30 mm Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, in 40 μl final volume at 37 °C. Elastase activity was neutralized with 1 μl of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm, for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were lyophilized until analysis when they were redissolved in 10 μl of 6 m guanidine HCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA. 1 μl of 10% trifluoroacetic acid was added to each sample to bring the pH to <3. Samples were then analyzed by reverse phase HPLC coupled to electrospray mass spectrometry as described (30Liu X. Shu S. Hong M.S. Levine R.L. Korn E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13694-13699Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Protease Assay—Recombinant elafin (1 μg; 4.1 × 10–6 m) was incubated with purified NE (10 μg; 8.3 × 10–6 m) for 2 h in 30 mm Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, in 40 μl final volume at 37 °C. Elafin fragments were purified by reverse phase HPLC, dried, and reconstituted with 50 μl of 0.1 m Hepes, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Brij-35. Various volumes of reconstituted fractions F1 and F2 (from 0 to 5 μl) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 3.3 nm NE in 0.1 m Hepes, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Brij-35. Residual activity of NE was detected by adding the chromogenic substrate MeOSuc-AAPV-pNA at a final concentration of 1 mm and by measuring absorbance at 405 nm over the time at 37 °C in a 96-well microplate reader (Victor2 1420 Multilabel Counter, Wallac). Residual activity was expressed in percentage as 100% activity is determined by control NE. Measurement of Elastase Concentration in CF Sputum—10 μl of P. aeruginosa-positive and -negative CF sputum were diluted in 0.1 m Hepes, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.13 mm E-64, 0.11 mm pepstatin A, and 5.4 mm EDTA and treated with or without NE inhibitor (1 mm MeOSuc-AAPV-CMK or 1.6 μm SLPI) for 1 h at 37 °C in a 100-μl volume. 50 μl of the chromogenic substrate MeOSuc-AAPV-pNA, was mixed with each sample to a final concentration of 1.4 mm, and absorbance at 405 nm of samples was measured over time at 37 °C in a 96-well microplate reader (Victor2 1420 Multilabel Counter). The concentration of NE in samples was determined by comparing the elastase activity (given by the rate of hydrolysis of the substrate) with a standard curve of purified NE. All measurements were performed in duplicate. Analysis of Elafin Cross-linking to Fibronectin by Transglutaminase—Recombinant elafin (100 ng, 3 μm) was incubated with increasing concentrations of neutrophil elastase (0–1000 ng, 0–6.1 μm) in 30 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5 for 1 h at 37 °C. Neutrophil elastase was inactivated by 5 μg of α1-antitrypsin for 30 min. The resulting mix was incubated in 200 mm Tris acetate, pH 6, containing 5 mm CaCl2 and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at 37 °C with 5 μg of plasma fibronectin and 0.38 milliunits of guinea pig liver transglutaminase (one unit catalyzes the formation of 1.0 μmol of hydroxamate per minute from Nα-CBZ-glutaminylglycine and hydroxylamine at pH 6.0 at 37 °C). The reaction was stopped by adding sample treatment buffer without reducing agent and by boiling samples for 5 min at 100 °C. Samples were separated by 4–12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using a biotinylated anti-elafin antibody according to the method described above. LPS ELISA—A microtiter plate was coated with 100 ng/well LPS (Sigma, Escherichia coli 055:B5) which had been diluted in serum-free RPMI media and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Unbound LPS was washed off the plate with distilled water. Excess water was gently tapped off, and the plate was left to air-dry overnight at room temperature. The next day the plate was blocked with 200 μl/well blocking buffer (PBS with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) for 2 h at 37 °C). The plate was washed 3 times with PBS, 0.05% (v/v) Tween, and 100 μl/well of the appropriately diluted proteins (diluted in serum-free RPMI media) were added to the plate at 37 °C for 2 h. Control wells, to which serum-free RPMI media alone was added in place of proteins, were included on each ELISA plate. Again, the plate was washed three times before primary antibody (R&D Systems, AF1747) was added at the appropriate dilution (1:100) for 37 °C for 2 h. After washing 100 μl/well of diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was added to the plate at 37 °C for 2 h, and the plate was washed 3 times. Substrate, 100 μl/well (ABTS Single Solution, Zymed Laboratories Inc.), was added, and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The A405 of the wells were measured on a microtiter plate reader, and results were analyzed using Prism, Version 3.0 (Graphpad Software, San Diego). Levels of Elafin in Soluble CF Sputum—Levels of elafin in soluble CF sputum from 11 patients with positive P. aeruginosa sputum cultures and 8 patients with negative P. aeruginosa sputum cultures were determined by sandwich ELISA. As shown in Fig. 1, levels of elafin were found to be significantly lower in P. aeruginosa-positive CF sputa compared with P. aeruginosa-negative CF sputa (502 ± 204 versus 2761 ± 876 pg/ml, p < 0.05). Incubation of Exogenous Elafin with CF Sputum—Effects of negative (Ps–) and positive (Ps+) P. aeruginosa CF sputa on elafin were assessed to determine their ability to potentially cleave or degrade the protease inhibitor. Recombinant elafin was incubated with Ps- and Ps+ CF sputa for various times at 37 °C and analyzed by Western blot under reducing or non-reducing conditions using a biotinylated anti-elafin antibody (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2A, no elafin was detectable after an incubation for 24 h with Ps+ CF sputum, whereas a faint band corresponding to intact elafin could still be detected with Ps– CF sputum in the same conditions of incubation. Although no fragments of elafin were detectable under reducing conditions (Fig. 2A), Western blot analysis performed under non-reducing conditions resulted in the detection of three distinct bands (Fig. 2B); in addition to the upper band displaying a similar size to intact elafin, two lower bands corresponding to proteolytic fragments of elafin were detected. A time-course experiment was performed by incubating recombinant elafin with Ps– or Ps+ CF sputum for 0, 10 min, 1 h, 6 h, or 24 h at 37 °C. As shown in Fig. 2C, levels of recombinant elafin detected by Western blot under reducing conditions decreased in both Ps- and Ps+ CF sputa over time. However, elafin was more rapidly cleaved in Ps+ than in Ps– CF sputum. Most of the elafin was cleaved after incubation for 10 min in Ps+ CF sputum, whereas intact elafin was still clearly detected after 6 h of incubation in Ps– CF sputa (Fig. 2C). These findings show that the proteolytic activity directed against elafin was higher in Ps+ than in Ps– CF sputum. Identification of the Protease(s) Involved in the Cleavage of Elafin in CF Sputum—To identify the protease(s) involved in the cleavage of elafin in CF sputa, different protease inhibitors were preincubated with Ps+ CF sputum samples before adding recombinant elafin. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, samples were analyzed by Western blot under reducing or non-reducing conditions using an anti-elafin antibody. First, the use of nonspecific protease inhibitors targeting each protease family (serine, cysteine, acidic proteases, and metalloproteases) allowed identification of the family of the CF sputum protease(s) involved in the cleavage of elafin. As shown in Fig. 3A, Pefabloc, a nonspecific serine protease inhibitor, inhibits elafin cleavage in Ps+ CF sputa, whereas neither leupeptin, E-64 (cysteine protease inhibitor), pepstatin A (acidic protease inhibitor), nor metalloproteinase inhibitors (EDTA, GM6001, phosphoramidon) had any effect. In addition to Pefabloc, several other serine protease inhibitors were used to identify more precisely the serine protease involved in the cleavage of elafin. As shown in Fig. 3B, no effect was observed with trypsin-like (TLCK, benzamidine, soybean trypsin inhibitor) and chymotrypsin-like (TPCK) inhibitors, suggesting that neither trypsin-like nor chymotrypsin-like proteases are involved in elafin cleavage in Ps+ CF sputa. However, a slight inhibition of elafin cleavage by the nonspecific serine protease inhibitor aprotinin was observed (Fig. 3B). Because no trypsin-like or chymotrypsin-like proteases mediated elafin cleavage in CF sputum, we hypothesized that elastase-like proteases, particularly neutrophil elastase and proteinase 3, could be involved in this process. Among inhibitors targeting neutrophil serine proteases (e.g. neutrophil elastase, proteinase 3, and cathepsin G) that have been tested in our study, only AAT, SLPI, and MeOSuc-AAPV-CMK inhibited elafin cleavage in Ps+ CF sputa (Fig. 3C). According to our previous results, α1-antichymotrypsin, a chymotrypsin-like inhibitor targeting cathepsin G, did not prevent elafin cleavage (Fig. 3C). Non-reducing Western blot analysis provided similar results as Pefabloc, and the neutrophil elastase inhibitor MeOSuc-AAPV-CMK completely prevented elafin cleavage (not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that NE is involved in the cleavage of NE in CF sputum. Given that NE is responsible of the cleavage of elafin in CF sputum and that the inhibitor is more rapidly degraded in Ps+ than in Ps– CF sputum, NE activity was measured in both CF sputa by using the chromogenic substrate MeOSuc-AAPV-pNA. Elastase activity in CF sputa was calculated using a standard curve of purified NE to determine the concentration of free NE in samples. As shown in Fig. 4, the concentration of free NE was increased 3.9-fold in Ps+ compared with Ps– CF sputa (2.86 versus 0.73 μm). Additionally, free elastase activity in both samples was totally abrogated using the NE inhibitors MeOSuc-AAPV-CMK and SLPI (Fig. 4), thus confirming the specificity of the measurements. Effects of Neutrophil Serine Proteases on Elafin Integrity—The ability of human neutrophil serine proteases to cleave elafin was evaluated in vitro (Fig. 5). Recombinant elafin was incubated at 8.5 × 10–7 M with purified proteases and analyzed by Western blot with an anti-elafin antibody. Firstly, dose-response incubations were carried out for 24 h at 37 °C using concentrations of neutrophil serine proteases ranged from 3.5 × 10–9 to 8.5 × 10–6 m. As shown in Fig. 5A, human NE and Pr3 were found to cleave recombinant elafin only in conditions with excess of proteases; although a partial cleavage of the inhibitor was observed at equimolarity, excess of neutrophil elastase and proteinase 3 completely cleaved elafin (Fig. 5A, 1 and 2). In contrast to these proteases, human cathepsin G appeared less effective in cleaving elafin as 10-fold excess of the enzyme was necessary to partially cleave elafin (Fig. 5A). Time-course incubations of elafin with NE at equimolarity (3.5 × 10–6 m) and in excess (3.5 × 10–6 m) were performed over 24 h at 37 °C to better characterize the proteolytic cleavage observed previously. As shown in Fig. 5B, NE in excess cleaved recombinant elafin quickly. Under these conditions, a complete cleavage of elafin was observed after only 30 min of incubation, whereas significant amounts of intact elafin were still detected after 24 h of incubation with equ"

One of the major plant structural polysaccharides is mannan, a ;-1,4-linked d-mannose polymer, which is hydrolyzed by endo- and exo-acting mannanases.

The structure of CjMan26C is very similar to that of the endo-acting C. japonicus mannanase CjMan26A.

The plant cell wall represents the dominant source of organic carbon in the biosphere and as such supports many facets of terrestrial and marine life. Access to this valuable source of carbon is mediated by extensive microbial enzyme consortia, which generate sugars that are utilized by microbial ecosystems to the benefit of plants, mammalian herbivores, and insects. These degradative enzymes are increasingly deployed in industrial processes, and it is apparent that their use in producing second generation, lignocellulose-based, biofuels is of considerable environmental significance (1Lynd L.R. Laser M.S. Bransby D. Dale B.E. Davison B. Hamilton R. Himmel M. Keller M. McMillan J.D. Sheehan J. Wyman C.E. Nat.

Among the major polysaccharides in softwoods and angiosperms are the mannans. These polysaccharides comprise a backbone of ;-1,4-linked d-mannopyranose sugars (known as “mannan”) or a heterogeneous combination of ;-1,4-d-mannose and ;-1,4-d-glucose units (termed “glucomannan”), which can be decorated with ;-1,6-galactose side chains to yield “galactomannan” and “galactoglucomannan,” respectively (3Brett C.T. Waldren K. Physiology and Biochemistry of Plant Cell Walls: Topics in Plant Functional Biology. Chapman and Hall, London1996Google Scholar). For complete enzymatic degradation, the galactose decorations are removed by ;-galactosidases (4Brumer III, H. Sims P.F. Sinnott M.L. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 5Centeno M.S. Guerreiro C.I. Dias F.M. Morland C. Tailford L.E. Goyal A. Prates J.A. Ferreira L.M. Caldeira R.M. Mongodin E.F.

Methods Enzymol. 1988; 160: 523-527Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Accessory enzymes, such as the ;-galactosidases are required essentially because side chains appended to plant cell wall matrix polysaccharides restrict the capacity of the backbone-cleaving enzymes to cleave their target substrates. Although galactose decorations restrict the capacity of mannanases to hydrolyze the mannan backbone (e.g. see Refs. 7Dias F.M. Vincent F. Pell G. Prates J.A. Centeno M.S. Tailford L.E. Ferreira L.M.

In the sequence-based classification of glycoside hydrolases (9Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2651) Google Scholar) (recently reviewed in Ref. 10Davies, G. J., and Sinnott, M. L. (2008) Biochem.

All of these enzymes, except ;-galactosidases, belong to clan GH-A, consistent with their (;/;)8 barrel fold, hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond by a general acid/base-catalyzed double displacement mechanism with retention of anomeric configuration, and the presentation of the two catalytic residues, the acid/base and the nucleophile at the C terminus of ;-strands 4 and 7, respectively (11Henrissat B.

With the rapid expansion of genomic sequence data, one of the major challenges is how to harness this treasure trove of sequence information to identify the full repertoire of catalytic activities displayed by the different glycoside hydrolase families and thus to inform the application of these enzymes for improved applied purposes. Such analyses should provide a biological rationale for the repertoire of glycoside hydrolases produced by both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. Indeed, until recently, GH26 was thought to be exclusively an endo-;-1,4-mannanase family, but two members that display, respectively, ;-1,3-xylanase (12Kiyohara M. Sakaguchi K. Yamaguchi K. Araki T.

This diversity in function is further exemplified by the recent identification of a GH5 enzyme, CmMan5A, which, although displaying extensive sequence identity to endo-acting mannanases, is an exo-acting mannanase that releases mannose from the nonreducing end of polymeric substrates (7Dias F.M. Vincent F. Pell G. Prates J.A. Centeno M.S. Tailford L.E. Ferreira L.M. Fontes C.M. Davies G.J. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol.

The saprophytic soil bacterium Cellvibrio japonicus exemplifies how the analysis of the biochemical properties of glycoside hydrolases, revealed by the recent completion of its genome sequence (15DeBoy R.T. Mongodin E.F. Fouts D.E. Tailford L.E. Khouri H. Emerson J.B. Mohamoud Y. Watkins K. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. Nelson K.E. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 5455-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), will make a significant contribution to understanding the mechanism by which the organism can utilize the plant cell wall as a carbon and energy source. C. japonicus synthesizes one of the most extensive mannan-degrading systems known. The bacterium is reported to express two GH26 and three GH5 endo-acting mannanases (8Hogg D. Pell G. Dupree P. Goubet F. Martin-Orue S.M. Armand S. Gilbert H.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 1027-1043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the genome sequence of the bacterium revealed two additional genes encoding the mannanases CjMan5D, which is a homologue of CmMan5A, and an additional membrane-bound GH26 enzyme, CjMan26C (15DeBoy R.T. Mongodin E.F. Fouts D.E. Tailford L.E. Khouri H. Emerson J.B. Mohamoud Y. Watkins K. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. Nelson K.E. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 5455-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Clones encoding CjMan26C were not identified when genomic libraries of C. japonicus were previously subjected to extensive screening for endo-mannanase activity, suggesting that the enzyme displays unusual catalytic activities. Here we report the biochemical analysis of this novel enzyme, CjMan26C, along with its high resolution crystal structures. We show that the enzyme is an exo-acting mannanase that releases the disaccharide mannobiose from the nonreducing end of oligo- and polysaccharides, an activity not previously described in mannan-degrading systems to our knowledge. The crystal structure shows that the substrate binding cleft adopts a blind canyon topography that presents a steric block at the -2 glycone binding site, explaining why the enzyme displays an exo-mode of action. Modification of the residues that present the steric block changes the mode of action of the enzyme from exo to endo. Additionally, the structure of the enzyme in “Michaelis complex” with decorated oligosaccharide suggests a possible means by which the galactoside appendages are accommodated but restrict the activity of the enzyme. Gene Cloning and Protein Expression—The region of the C. japonicus mannanase gene, man26C, encoding mature CjMan26C (residues 25-419 of the full-length enzyme), was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA using the thermostable DNA polymerase Pfu Turbo (Stratagene) and the primers 5′-GCGCATATGAGCGAGAAGCCTGCAGAATCGCGG-3′ and 5′-GCGCTCGAGGCGATACAAGGGCGGCAGCTC-3′ that contain NdeI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively, depicted in boldface type. The DNA product was cloned into the NdeI and XhoI sites of the Escherichia coli expression vector pET20b (Novagen) to generate pVT1. CjMan26C encoded by pVT1 contains a C-terminal His6 tag. Protein Expression and Purification—E. coli BL21 cells harboring pVT1 were cultured in Luria-Bertani broth at 37 °C to midexponential phase (A600 = 0.6), and recombinant protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-;-d-galactopyranoside and incubation for a further 5 h at 37 °C. CjMan26C was purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography using Talon™ resin and elution in 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 300 mm NaCl and 100 mm imidazole deploying a Bio-Rad fast protein liquid chromatography system. The eluted mannanase was then dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The fractions containing the mannanase were concentrated using a 30,000 molecular weight cut-off Vivaspin 20 centrifugal concentrator. Purified CjMan26C was judged homogenous by SDS-PAGE. Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out employing the PCR-based QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions, using pVT1 as the template and primers listed in Table S1. Enzyme Assays—Substrates used in the enzyme assays described below were purchased from Sigma except for konjac glucomannan, which was from Megazyme International. Degalatosylated carob mannan was generated from carob galactomannan as described previously (8Hogg D. Pell G. Dupree P. Goubet F. Martin-Orue S.M. Armand S. Gilbert H.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 1027-1043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate enzyme activity, 4-ml reactions were set up comprising 50 mm sodium phosphate, buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and soluble or insoluble substrate at 0.04-2% (w/v). The reaction, which was initiated by the addition of 200 ;l of appropriately diluted enzyme, was incubated at 37 °C for up to 30 min, and at regular time intervals 500-;l aliquots were removed, and the quantity of reducing sugar was determined (16Miller G.L. Anal. Chem. 1959; 31: 426-428Crossref Scopus (22579) Google Scholar). The nature of the products was evaluated by HPLC 5The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; CAPSO, 3-(cyclohexamino)-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid; CBM, carbohydrate-binding module. (see below). The pH profile of the catalytic activity of the mannanases was determined using the following buffers: pH 3-5, 50 mm sodium acetate; pH 5-9, 50 mm sodium phosphate; pH 9-11, 50 mm CAPSO (Sigma). To determine the reaction products released from the mannose-containing substrates and to quantify the activity of the mannanases against manno-oligosaccharides, the enzymatic incubations were subjected to HPLC using enzyme reactions described above except that the 500-;l aliquots were treated with alkali to inactivate the enzyme, filtered, and then subjected to HPLC using an analytical CARBOPAC™ PA-100 anion exchange column (Dionex) equipped with a guard column. The elution conditions were as follows: 0-5 min, 66 mm NaOH; 5-25 min, 66 mm NaOH with a 0-75 mm sodium acetate gradient. Sugars were detected by pulsed amperometric detection. The catalytic efficiency of the mannanases against manno-oligosaccharides was determined using 20 pm to 5 ;m enzyme and a substrate concentration of 30 ;m, and the data were fitted to the equation, k = ln[S0]/[St], where k = (kcat/Km)[enzyme] × time, whereas [S0] and [St] represent substrate concentration prior to the start of the reaction and at a specified time during the reaction, respectively (17Matsui I. Ishikawa K. Matsui E. Miyairi S. Fukui S. Honda K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 109: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Crystallization, Data Collection, Structure Solution, and Refinement—Pure CjMan26C was washed into 5 mm Hepes-Na buffer, pH 7.0, by repeated dilution (40 volumes of water) and concentrated in a VIVASPIN 30-kDa concentrator. Crystals of wild type CjMan26C and the nucleophile mutant E338A were grown by vapor phase diffusion at 18 °C using the hanging drop method with an equal volume (1 ;l) of protein (10 g/liter) and reservoir solution comprising 100 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.6, containing 15% polyethylene glycol 3000. Crystals in the presence of various ligands were similarly grown with the exception that the protein solution contained 10 mm mannooligosaccharide. Crystals, which grew over a period of 1 week, were cryoprotected by the addition of 20% glycerol (v/v) to the crystallization mother liquor. Diffraction data for four different complexes of Man26C (native, mannose complex, manno-oligosaccharide, and E338A-mannobiose) were collected on beamlines ID14-1 and ID23-1 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, and data were processed in DENZO scaled with SCALEPACK from the HKL suite (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). All other computations used programs from within the CCP4 suite (19Collaborative Computational Project 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) unless stated otherwise. The structures of the four CjMan26Cs were solved by molecular replacement using the program MOLREP from the CCP4 suite with CjMan26A as the search model (Protein Data Bank code 1J9Y). Before refinement, 5% of the observations were chosen at random and set aside for cross-validation analysis and to monitor various refinement strategies, such as the weighting of geometrical and temperature factor restraints and the insertion of solvent water during maximum likelihood refinement using REFMAC5 (20Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). The structure of unliganded Man26C was observed in a different space group, and this structure was solved, with MOLREP, using the protein coordinates only of the mannose-CjMan26C structure. For all structures, cycles of maximum likelihood refinement were interspersed with manual corrections of the models using COOT (21Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). Ligands were incorporated toward the end of the refinement into CjMan26C.

The CjMan26C-catalyzed hydrolysis of mannose-based polysaccharides was slow compared with classical endo-acting ;-mannanases, such as GH5 and GH26 (8Hogg D. Pell G. Dupree P. Goubet F. Martin-Orue S.M. Armand S. Gilbert H.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 1027-1043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the activities of CjMan26C against insoluble ;-mannan, carob galactomannan and konjac glucomannan were 1.6-, 9.3-, and 14.6-fold lower than its close endo-acting homolog CjMan26A (see below) (Table 2). CjMan26C, typical of the majority of GH26 enzymes, is a ;-mannanase (mannanase). The pH and temperature optima of the enzyme, using galactomannan as substrate, were pH 8.0 and 50 °C (data not shown).TABLE 2Catalytic activity of CjMan26C and CjMan26A mannanasesSubstrateaThe substrates galactomannan and glucomannan were from carob and konjac seeds, respectively.kcat/Km (CjMan26C)bFor polysaccharide substrates activity is expressed as specific activity (mol of product/mol of enzyme/min) at a substrate concentration of 2 mg ml−1.kcat/Km (CjMan26A)bFor polysaccharide substrates activity is expressed as specific activity (mol of product/mol of enzyme/min) at a substrate concentration of 2 mg ml−1.min−1 m−1min−1 m−1Galactomannan1.4 × 104 ± 0.91.3 × 105 ± 0.8Glucomannan1.1 × 104 ± 0.81.6 × 105 ± 0.6;-Mannan2.2 × 104 ± 0.53.5 × 104 ± 1.0Mannohexaose2.7 × 109 ± 1.5 × 108NDcND, not determined.Mannopentaose3.5 × 109 ± 1.2 × 108NDMannotetraose3.0 × 109 ± 3.3 × 1081.4 × 107 ± 2.8 × 10−3Mannotriose2.9 × 106 ± 2.2 × 1081.8 × 106 ± 1 × 10−2a The substrates galactomannan and glucomannan were from carob and konjac seeds, respectively.b For polysaccharide substrates activity is expressed as specific activity (mol of product/mol of enzyme/min) at a substrate concentration of 2 mg ml−1.c ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab CjMan26C releases only mannobiose from ;-mannan, whereas this disaccharide and, to a lesser extent, Gal-Man2, were generated from carob galactomannan, Fig. 1. This oligosaccharide fingerprint, comprising a single reaction product, is typical of an exo-acting enzyme; endo-acting glycoside hydrolases typically produce a range of reaction products that vary in size. These data all point to the novel catalytic activity of CjMan26C. In contrast to all of the other GH26 ;-mannanases characterized to date (8Hogg D. Pell G. Dupree P. Goubet F. Martin-Orue S.M. Armand S. Gilbert H.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 1027-1043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Braithwaite K.L. Black G.W. Hazlewood G.P. Ali B.R. Gilbert H.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 1005-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), which are endo-acting, CjMan26C is not only an exo-mannanase but is to our knowledge the first to be described that releases the disaccharide mannobiose and not mannose. By analogy to the terminology used to describe cellulose-degrading systems (see Refs. 23Tomme P. Warren R.A. Gilkes N.R. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1995; 37: 1-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar and 24Warren R.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 183-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) for review), CjMan26C can be defined as a mannobiohydrolase. In light of the three-dimensional structure, described below, we can also say that the disaccharides are liberated at the nonreducing end of ;-1,4-linked mannans and mannooligosaccharides; hence, the enzyme is a “-2 mannobiohydrolase” in the nomenclature advocated by Sinnott and co-workers (25Davies G.J. Sinnott M.L. Withers S.G. Sinnott M.L. Comprehensive Biological Catalysis. Academic Press, Inc., London1997Google Scholar). The activity of the mannobiohydrolase against mannooligosaccharides showed that the enzyme released mannose and mannobiose from mannotriose, exclusively mannobiose from mannotetraose, mannobiose and mannotriose from mannopentaose, and mannobiose and mannotetraose from mannohexaose, all of the expected patterns for a mannobiohydrolase. The enzyme displays no detectable activity against mannobiose, whereas the catalytic efficiency of CjMan26C against mannotriose, mannotetraose, mannopentaose, and mannohexaose was 2.9 × 106, 3.0 × 109, 3.5 × 109, and 2.9 × 109 min-1 m-1, respectively (Table 2). These data show that the enzyme contains four subsites that extend from -2 to +2, with bond cleavage occurring between the sugars located at -1 and +1, by definition (26Davies G.J. Wilson K.S. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). CjMan26C is an extremely efficient enzyme, with a kcat/Km against mannotetraose ∼20-fold higher than the catalytic efficiency of CjMan26A (27Hogg D. Woo E.J. Bolam D.N. McKie V.A. Gilbert H.J. Pickersgill R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31186-31192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Indeed, such a kcat/Km approaches catalytic perfection in which catalysis is limited by the diffusion rate (109 m-1 s-1) of molecules in aqueous environments (28Samson R. Deutch J.M. J. Chem. Phys. 1978; 68: 285-290Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The enhanced activity of the mannobiohydrolase, compared with CjMan26A that also contains four subsites extending from -2 to +2, appears to be conferred by the +2 subsite, which contributes a productive binding energy of 4.0 kcal mol-1 to catalysis, determined from RTln(kcat/Km (mannotetraose)/kcat/Km (mannotriose)). To investigate the capacity of CjMan26C to accommodate the galactosyl decorations present in galactomannan and also the glucosyl moieties in the backbone of glucomannan, the reaction products derived from Gal2Man5 and glucomannan were analyzed. Only mannobiose was released from glucomannan, demonstrating that glucose cannot bind to the glycone subsites, whereas the enzyme did not hydrolyze 6364-Gal2Man5, indicating that either the -1 or -2 subsites cannot accommodate mannosides decorated with galactose side chains (data not shown). To explore further galactose recognition, 6364-Gal2Man5 was partially hydrolyzed by a GH27 ;-galactosidase to generate, in equal proportions, 6364-Gal2Man5, 63-Gal-Man5, 64-Gal-Man5, and mannopentaose, and the hydrolysis of these oligosaccharides by CjMan26C was explored. The data show that CjMan26C liberates, albeit slowly, 61-Gal-Man2, demonstrating that galactose can be accommodated when bound to the mannoside at the -1 subsite (data not shown). The absence of 63-Gal-Man3 shows that the galactose side chain is not tolerated at the +1 subsite. Three-dimensional Structure of CjMan26C—The crystal structure of CjMan26C was solved in various apo and ligand-bound forms (Table 1). The first to be solved, that co-crystallized with mannobiose (but subsequently shown to be a mannose complex), was determined by molecular replacement, using CjMan26A as the search model, to a resolution of ∼1.5 Á, from a P6122 crystal form with approximate cell dimensions a = b = 85, c = 245 Á and with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The structure consists of 367 amino acids, equating to residues 53-419 of full-length (unprocessed) CjMan26C. The structure of CjMan26C displays a canonical (;8/;8)-barrel topology, typical of GH26 (Fig. 2). The structure of CjMan26C (Fig. 2A) shows a high degree of similarity with GH26 endo-;1,4-mannanases, most notably with CjMan26A (27Hogg D. Woo E.J. Bolam D.N. McKie V.A. Gilbert H.J.

In CjMan26A, the equivalent loop consists of only 12 amino acids, and as a result, the substrate binding cleft is open at both ends (discussed in more detail below).FIGURE 3Active center topography of a mannobiohydrolase.

https://openalex.org/W1994046982,"Background A variety of spore discharge processes have evolved among the fungi. Those with the longest ranges are powered by hydrostatic pressure and include “squirt guns” that are most common in the Ascomycota and Zygomycota. In these fungi, fluid-filled stalks that support single spores or spore-filled sporangia, or cells called asci that contain multiple spores, are pressurized by osmosis. Because spores are discharged at such high speeds, most of the information on launch processes from previous studies has been inferred from mathematical models and is subject to a number of errors. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we have used ultra-high-speed video cameras running at maximum frame rates of 250,000 fps to analyze the entire launch process in four species of fungi that grow on the dung of herbivores. For the first time we have direct measurements of launch speeds and empirical estimates of acceleration in these fungi. Launch speeds ranged from 2 to 25 m s−1 and corresponding accelerations of 20,000 to 180,000 g propelled spores over distances of up to 2.5 meters. In addition, quantitative spectroscopic methods were used to identify the organic and inorganic osmolytes responsible for generating the turgor pressures that drive spore discharge. Conclusions/Significance The new video data allowed us to test different models for the effect of viscous drag and identify errors in the previous approaches to modeling spore motion. The spectroscopic data show that high speed spore discharge mechanisms in fungi are powered by the same levels of turgor pressure that are characteristic of fungal hyphae and do not require any special mechanisms of osmolyte accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2041075449,"Recent in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that destabilized proteins with defective folding induce aggregation and toxicity in protein-misfolding diseases. One such unstable protein state is called amyloid oligomer, a precursor of fully aggregated forms of amyloid. Detection of various amyloid oligomers with A11, an anti-amyloid oligomer conformation-specific antibody, revealed that the amyloid oligomer represents a generic conformation and suggested that toxic beta-aggregation processes possess a common mechanism. By using A11 antibody as a probe in combination with mass spectrometric analysis, we identified GroEL in bacterial lysates as a protein that may potentially have an amyloid oligomer conformation. Surprisingly, A11 reacted not only with purified GroEL but also with several purified heat shock proteins, including human Hsp27, 40, 70, 90; yeast Hsp104; and bovine Hsc70. The native folds of A11-reactive proteins in purified samples were characterized by their anti-beta-aggregation activity in terms of both functionality and in contrast to the beta-aggregation promoting activity of misfolded pathogenic amyloid oligomers. The conformation-dependent binding of A11 with natively folded Hsp27 was supported by the concurrent loss of A11 reactivity and anti-beta-aggregation activity of heat-treated Hsp27 samples. Moreover, we observed consistent anti-beta-aggregation activity not only by chaperones containing an amyloid oligomer conformation but also by several A11-immunoreactive non-chaperone proteins. From these results, we suggest that the amyloid oligomer conformation is present in a group of natively folded proteins. The inhibitory effects of A11 antibody on both GroEL/ES-assisted luciferase refolding and Hsp70-mediated decelerated nucleation of Abeta aggregation suggested that the A11-binding sites on these chaperones might be functionally important. Finally, we employed a computational approach to uncover possible A11-binding sites on these targets. Since the beta-sheet edge was a common structural motif having the most similar physicochemical properties in the A11-reactive proteins we analyzed, we propose that the beta-sheet edge in some natively folded amyloid oligomers is designed positively to prevent beta aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W2010078996,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of liver disease worldwide and a potential cause of substantial morbidity and mortality in the future. HCV is characterized by a high level of genetic heterogeneity. Although homologous recombination has been demonstrated in many members of the family Flaviviridae, to which HCV belongs, there are only a few studies reporting recombination on natural populations of HCV, suggesting that these events are rare in vivo. Furthermore, these few studies have focused on recombination between different HCV genotypes/subtypes but there are no reports on the extent of intra-genotype or intra-subtype recombination between viral strains infecting the same patient. Given the important implications of recombination for RNA virus evolution, our aim in this study has been to assess the existence and eventually the frequency of intragenic recombination on HCV. For this, we retrospectively have analyzed two regions of the HCV genome (NS5A and E1-E2) in samples from two different groups: (i) patients infected only with HCV (either treated with interferon plus ribavirin or treatment naïve), and (ii) HCV-HIV co-infected patients (with and without treatment against HIV). The complete data set comprised 17712 sequences from 136 serum samples derived from 111 patients. Recombination analyses were performed using 6 different methods implemented in the program RDP3. Recombination events were considered when detected by at least 3 of the 6 methods used and were identified in 10.7% of the amplified samples, distributed throughout all the groups described and the two genomic regions studied. The resulting recombination events were further verified by detailed phylogenetic analyses. The complete experimental procedure was applied to an artificial mixture of relatively closely viral populations and the ensuing analyses failed to reveal artifactual recombination. From these results we conclude that recombination should be considered as a potentially relevant mechanism generating genetic variation in HCV and with important implications for the treatment of this infection."
https://openalex.org/W1966454282,"The alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) play an important role in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. However, there are currently no suitable positron emission tomography (PET) radioligands for imaging alpha7 nAChRs in the intact human brain. Here we report the novel PET radioligand [11C]CHIBA-1001 for in vivo imaging of alpha7 nAChRs in the non-human primate brain.A receptor binding assay showed that CHIBA-1001 was a highly selective ligand at alpha7 nAChRs. Using conscious monkeys, we found that the distribution of radioactivity in the monkey brain after intravenous administration of [11C]CHIBA-1001 was consistent with the regional distribution of alpha7 nAChRs in the monkey brain. The distribution of radioactivity in the brain regions after intravenous administration of [11C]CHIBA-1001 was blocked by pretreatment with the selective alpha7 nAChR agonist SSR180711 (5.0 mg/kg). However, the distribution of [11C]CHIBA-1001 was not altered by pretreatment with the selective alpha4beta2 nAChR agonist A85380 (1.0 mg/kg). Interestingly, the binding of [11C]CHIBA-1001 in the frontal cortex of the monkey brain was significantly decreased by subchronic administration of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist phencyclidine (0.3 mg/kg, twice a day for 13 days); which is a non-human primate model of schizophrenia.The present findings suggest that [11C]CHIBA-1001 could be a novel useful PET ligand for in vivo study of the receptor occupancy and pathophysiology of alpha7 nAChRs in the intact brain of patients with neuropsychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease."

The existence of an alternative biosynthetic pathway to cysteine in this pathogen has implications for the design strategy aimed at inhibition of this metabolic route. In the dormant phase Mycobacterium tuberculosis is surviving within granulomas in the lungs of infected individuals where the environment is characterized by hypoxia, nutrient starvation, and oxidative stress (1Wayne L.G. Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 1994; 13: 908-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 2Zhang Y. Front.

The latter involves nitrogen monoxide and its spontaneously formed derivatives (reactive nitrogen intermediates), which are used by phagocytic cells to kill internalized bacteria (4MacMicking J.D.

The prime targets of reactive nitrogen intermediates are cysteine and tyrosine side chains (5Rhee K.Y. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Nathan C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Bacteria in the group actinomycetales involving Streptomyces, Corynebacteria, and Mycobacteria produce mycothiol (1-d-myo-inosityl-2-(N-acetyl-cysteinyl) amino-2-deoxy-α-d-glucopyranoside) as their principal low molecular mass thiol, which has a crucial role in maintaining redox balance and contains a cysteine-derived cysteamine moiety (6Bornemann C. Jardine M.A. Spies H.S. Steenkamp D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus the first line of defense of the pathogen against free radicals and hence its long term survival within granulomas are directly linked to the availability of cysteine. Gene expression and proteome analysis of various models of dormant M. tuberculosis also consistently identified genes involved in sulfur metabolism as up-regulated (7Hampshire T. Soneji S. Bacon J.

These isoenzymes show 25–45% identity in amino acid sequence but exhibit characteristic differences in their substrate specificity with respect to the sulfur donor. CysK uses hydrogen sulfide produced by the sulfate reduction pathway as a sulfur source, whereas the CysM enzymes characterized so far tend to accept thiosulfate or larger substrates as sulfur donors (15Burns K.E.

Biochemical and structural studies of CysK1 (Rv2334) established that this enzyme is an O-acetyl serine sulfhydrylase, using OAS and sulfide as substrates (18Schnell R. Oehlmann W. Singh M. Schneider G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23473-23481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), whereas the function of CysK2 (Rv0848) remains to be elucidated. In an earlier functional study of CysM (Rv1336), it was shown that this enzyme is a sulfhydrylase that uses a novel mode of sulfur delivery (15Burns K.E. Baumgart S. Dorrestein P.C. Zhai H. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 11602-11603Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Instead of incorporation of sulfide into the enzyme-aminoacrylate intermediate as in other OASSs, MtbCysM uses a small protein, denoted CysO (Rv1335) that is thiocarboxylated at the C terminus as sulfur source (15Burns K.E. Baumgart S. Dorrestein P.C. Zhai H. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 11602-11603Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The reaction leads to the formation of a covalent cysteine adduct at the C terminus of CysO as primary reaction product. To complete cysteine formation, a zinc-dependent metalloprotease (Rv1334) cleaves the CysO-cysteine bond, releasing l-cysteine. The genes coding for CysM, CysO, and the metalloprotease are located on the same transcriptional unit in the genome (15Burns K.E. Baumgart S. Dorrestein P.C. Zhai H. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 11602-11603Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Mutants carrying a transposon insertion in cysM were shown to be attenuated in macrophages (19Rengarajan J. Bloom B.R. Rubin E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8327-8332Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) and in a mouse tuberculosis model (20Sassetti C.M. Rubin E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12989-12994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). In this paper we show that recombinant PLP-dependent CysM from M. tuberculosis, contrary to annotations in sequence data bases, is not an OAS sulfhydrylase but uses O-phosphoserine (OPS) as a sulfur acceptor. A three-dimensional model of the external aldimine formed between the cofactor and the substrate, based on the 2.1 Å crystal structure reported here, suggests an arginine residue at the substrate binding site as a major determinant for recognition of the phosphate group of OPS. Consistent with this model, amino acid replacement of this residue by site-directed mutagenesis results in a major loss in catalytic activity with OPS as substrate. The CysM-dependent pathway of cysteine biosynthesis in M. tuberculosis thus not only utilizes a protein-bound thiocarboxylate instead of sulfide as demonstrated earlier (15Burns K.E. Baumgart S. Dorrestein P.C. Zhai H. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 11602-11603Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) but is also independent of OAS as a sulfur acceptor (Scheme 1). Gene Cloning and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The DNA sequence coding for CysM from M. tuberculosis (Rv1336) was amplified by PCR and cloned in the expression vector pET28a (Novagen) using upstream NdeI and downstream HindIII sites, resulting in a cleavable six-histidine tag at the N terminus (expression construct pET-His6CysM9). In this construct, thrombin cleavage results in a recombinant protein with three additional amino acids (Gly-Ser-His) at the N terminus. As a consequence of the cloning procedure, the second amino acid in the CysM sequence (Thr) is changed to alanine. The R220A mutant variant was prepared using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) approach starting from pET-His6CysM9 as template. CysO (Rv1335) was cloned in the pTYB2 (New England Biolabs) vector with upstream NdeI and downstream SmaI sites. This construct results in a translational fusion with the vector-supplied inteine and chitin-binding domain and produces the native protein sequence after the inteine-catalyzed self-cleavage. Protein Production and Purification—Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) carrying the construct pET-His6CysM9 was cultivated in 1.6 liters of LB medium supplemented with kanamycin (30 μg/ml) at 21 °C. At an A600 value of 0.7–0.8 pyridoxal was added to a concentration of 10 μm, and gene expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 0.1 mm. After ∼24 h the cells were harvested and then resuspended in a buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole. The cells were disrupted by freeze/thaw cycles, lysozyme, and DNase I treatment followed by sonication. The clarified lysates were loaded on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) with a column volume of 1.8 ml. After extensive washing with 10 mm imidazole, the remaining proteins were eluted with an imidazole step gradient. Pure His6-CysM eluted in fractions containing 100–200 mm imidazole. Fractions containing His6-CysM were pooled, loaded on a Sephadex G-25 desalting column (GE Healthcare), and eluted in a buffer of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl. The N-terminal His6 tag was removed by thrombin cleavage. Residual noncleaved His-CysM was retained by passage through a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column in the presence of 10 mm imidazole. The flow-through containing the cleaved CysM protein was pooled and loaded on a Superdex-200 column pre-equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl. This procedure resulted in homogeneous CysM as verified by SDS-PAGE. The CysM protein was concentrated to 21.2 mg/ml (determined according to Bradford using a bovine serum albumin standard) by an Amicon centrifugation device with a 10-kDa molecular mass cut-off. Aliquots of the protein preparations were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until further use. The CysM R220A mutant was expressed and purified in the same way as the wild type enzyme. Native CysO was produced in E. coli and purified on a chitin affinity column according to the recommendations of the manufacturers of the chitin affinity beads and pTYB2 vector (New England Biolabs). Thiocarboxylated CysO was prepared as described previously (21Kinsland C. Taylor S.V. Kelleher N.L. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1839-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Spectrophotometry—UV-visible absorbance spectra of recombinant CysM were recorded at an enzyme concentration of 28.1 μm in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl buffer using a Jasco-V65 spectrophotometer. Spectra of the covalent aminoacrylate complex were obtained immediately after the addition of 1.0 mmO-phosphoserine to the enzyme solution. Enzyme Activity Measurements—Recombinant CysM was assayed for O-phosphoserine and O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase activity spectrophotometrically at 560 nm by monitoring the formation of cysteine using the acid-ninhydrine method (22Gaitonde M.K. Biochem. J. 1967; 104: 627-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). The reactions were carried out in a total volume of 2.0 ml in 50 mm HEPES buffer at pH 7.4 at 37 °C. The reaction mixture contained O-acetyl-l-serine or O-phospho-l-serine at final concentrations of 5 mm, respectively, and 5.0 μg of enzyme. The reactions were started by the addition of sodium sulfide to a concentration of 4 mm (stock solution of 400 mm sodium sulfide in 1 mm NaOH) to the assay mixtures. Aliquots of 250 μl were taken at various time points, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of trichloroacetic acid (final concentration, 16.6%). Following centrifugation, the amount of product was determined spectrophotometrically using a standard curve for cysteine in the range 0.04–0.8 mm. Specific activities were derived from the linear part of the time curves, and each measurement was carried out in triplicate. Determination of Kinetic Parameters for the First Halfreaction—The first half-reaction using O-phosphoserine as substrate was followed by a stopped flow spectrophotometer by monitoring the appearance of the aminoacrylate intermediate at 463 nm in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.5 in 100-μl reaction volumes. Substrate concentrations were 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 4.0 mm with an enzyme concentration of 12 μm. Because of the slower reaction rates, the reaction with O-acetylserine as substrate concentration range (1.0–6.0 mm) was recorded in a spectrophotometer at 463 nm in 100-μl reaction volumes at an enzyme concentration of 23.8 μm in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.5. The kinetic analysis of the individual half-reactions was carried out using the formalism described by Cook and co-workers (14Chattopadhyay A. Meier M. Ivaninskii S. Burkhard P. Speroni F. Campanini B. Bettati S. Mozzarelli A. Rabeh W.M. Li L. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 8315-8330Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 23Rabeh W.M. Alguindigue S.S. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 5541-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). First order rate constants (kobs) were derived from an exponential fit to the recorded spectrophotometric data. The first order rate constants were plotted against substrate concentrations and fitted to a linear equation to obtain the second order rate constants (kmax/Ks). Conversion of the Aminoacrylate Intermediate—The CysM-aminoacrylate intermediate was prepared prior to the measurements by incubating 600 μm of enzyme and 1.0 mm of O-phosphoserine in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, buffer for 2 min, followed by desalting using a NAP-5 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with the reaction buffer 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, to remove nonreacted substrate. The ability of potential sulfur donors to react with the aminoacrylate was examined initially by the addition of CysO-thiocarboxylate (60 μm), Na2S (8.0 mm), and sodium thiosulfate (5 mm), respectively, to a solution of 16 μm enzyme-intermediate complex. Decomposition of the aminoacrylate complex was monitored spectrophotometrically at 463 nm. The time course of the second half-reaction with CysO-thiocarboxylate (concentrations of 15, 22.5, 30, and 60 μm) was followed using a stopped flow spectrophotometer. The reaction with hydrogen sulfide (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.5, and 4.0 mm) was recorded in a similar way in a spectrophotometer. In both cases the reaction was monitored by the disappearance of the aminoacrylate intermediate at 463 nm in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.5 in 100-μl reaction volumes. The derivation of the kinetic parameters was performed in the same way as for the first half-reaction. Mass Spectrometry—Samples of CysO-thiocarboxylate (5 μg) were removed directly after the CysO-thiocarboxylate purification step and after the completion of the reaction with the CysM aminoacrylate. Both samples were diluted in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.75 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 2.5% acetonitrile, and 0.05% formic acid and loaded to a CapLC system™ and Q-Tof™ quadrupole/orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Waters Corp., Manchester) using the method described by Sundqvist et al. (24Sundqvist G. Stenvall M. Berglund H. Ottosson J. Brumer H. J. Chromatogr. B Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2007; 852: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The spectra were combined and deconvoluted to zero charged ions with the maximum Entrophy™ 1 algorithm in Masslynx software (Waters Corp., Milford, MA). Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystallization screening was carried out using the vapor diffusion method and a Phoenix crystallization robot. After extensive screening and optimization, the diffraction quality crystals of CysM were obtained by equilibrating a mixture of 2 μl of protein solution (21.2 mg/ml) and 2 μl of reservoir solution (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.25–7.5, 0.1 m K2HPO4, 4.3 m NaCl) against the reservoir solution in sitting drops. The crystals appeared after 24–48 h and were transferred to a solution containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm K2HPO4, 1.1 m NaCl, and 30% PEG5K MME before flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. X-ray data to 2.1 Å were collected at the Beamline ID14:4 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) at 110 K. The x-ray data were processed and scaled with the programs MOSFLM and SCALA from the CCP4 suite (25Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The coordinates for one subunit of CysK1 from M. tuberculosis (Protein Data Bank accession code 2Q3B) (18Schnell R. Oehlmann W. Singh M. Schneider G. J. Biol.

The best solution had a score of 0.263 and an R factor of 54.0%, with two subunits in the asymmetric unit. The relative position and orientation of these monomers corresponded well to the expected dimer. To monitor the behavior of the refinement process, 5% of the x-ray data were removed for the calculation of Rfree. The initial cycles of restrained refinement using Refmac5 (27Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar) resulted in a drop of the R factor by 9.8%. The correctness of the molecular replacement solution was confirmed by electron density for the cofactor, including the covalent linkage to the active site lysine residue appearing at the expected positions. Manual rebuilding of the model was carried out with the program Coot (28Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Water molecules were added based on peak heights, shape of the electron density, temperature factor, and capability to form hydrogen bonds with surrounding protein residues and/or other water molecules. The final model contains the two chains of the CysM dimer, amino acid residues 3–313 from chain A, residues 1–316 of chain B, two PLP molecules, and 221 water molecules. Residues 124–130 and 211–226 in chain B and the last residues in the C termini of both chains did not have defined electron density and were omitted from the model. Details of the refinement and protein models are given in Table 1. The crystallographic data have been deposited with Protein Data Bank accession code 3DKI. The figures were made using the program Pymol. The sequence alignment was made with the program Align. Characterization of M. tuberculosis CysM—Recombinant MtbCysM was produced and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity using a hexahistidine tag at the N terminus that was subsequently removed by thrombin cleavage. Gel filtration chromatography of purified samples of MtbCysM suggested that the enzyme is a dimer in solution, similar to other members of this enzyme family. Recombinant CysM has a yellow color and shows the typical absorption spectrum of PLP-dependent enzymes (30Karsten W.E. Cook P.F. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 354: 223-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The absorbance peak at 412 nm (Fig. 1) is characteristic of the internal Schiff base formed between the cofactor and the active site lysine residue. MtbCysM is annotated as an OAS sulfhydrylase, but we were unable to detect any cysteine as reaction product using OAS as substrate and sodium sulfide as sulfur donor. When using OPS as an acceptor, we could detect formation of cysteine with a turnover number of 0.1 s-1 at 37 °C. This value is considerably lower compared with those determined for the related enzymes (Table 2). The low activity prompted us to further investigate whether the formation of the aminoacrylate intermediate, the first half-reaction, is slow (i.e. poor recognition of and/or reaction with the acceptor substrate) or whether the second step, the reaction of the intermediate with sulfide, is responsible for the low turnover rate. A set of alternative substrates as sulfur donors and acceptors were tested, and the formation or degradation of the aminoacrylate intermediate was monitored spectrophotometrically.TABLE 2Specific activities of sulfhydrylases with sulfide as sulfur source The specific activities were determined using the method of Gaitonde (22Gaitonde M.K.

The addition of OPS to CysM results in immediate formation of the aminoacrylate external aldimine with the characteristic absorption bands at 317 and 463 nm (Fig. 1). An identical spectrum was obtained after the addition of OAS; however the reaction took more than 40 min to complete, indicating a remarkably slower reaction rate with this substrate. The second order rate constants (kmax/Ks) determined for the first half-reaction with the substrates OAS and OPS show a more than 600-fold difference in favor of OPS (Table 3).TABLE 3Kinetic parameters of the individual half-reactions for wild type CysM and the CysM (R220A) mutant from M. tuberculosis The reactions were followed spectrophotometrically by monitoring the appearance (in the case of OPS and OAS) or disappearance (in the case of CysOH and sulfide) of the aminoacrylate intermediate at 463 nm.

However, the underlying mechanism of cross-talk between neuregulin and cAMP signaling remains mostly undefined. Here, we report that the activation of protein kinase A (PKA), but not that of exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC), enhances S-phase entry of SCs by synergistically enhancing the ligand-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation/activation of the neuregulin co-receptor, ErbB2-ErbB3. The role of PKA in neuregulin-ErbB signaling was confirmed using PKA inhibitors, pathway-selective cAMP analogs, and natural ligands stimulating PKA activity in SCs, such as adenosine and epinephrine. Two basic observations defined the synergistic action of PKA as “gating” for neuregulin-ErbB signaling: 1) the activation of PKA was not sufficient to induce S-phase entry or the activation of either ErbB2 or ErbB3; and 2) the presence of neuregulin was strictly required to ignite ErbB activation and thereby ERK and Akt signaling. However, PKA directly phosphorylated ErbB2 on Thr-686, a highly conserved intracellular regulatory site that was required for the PKA-mediated synergistic enhancement of neuregulin-induced ErbB2-ErbB3 activation and proliferation in SCs. The gating action of PKA on neuregulin-induced ErbB2-ErbB3 activation has important biological significance, because it insures signal amplification into the ERK and Akt pathways without compromising either the neuregulin dependence or the high specificity of ErbB signaling pathways.

Our previous studies indicated that, in SCs, the synergistic effect of cAMP on S-phase entry relies on the ability of this second messenger to enhance the potency and duration of neuregulin-stimulated MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt activation, which are both required for cell cycle progression. In the absence of neuregulin, increased intracellular cAMP failed to induce the activation of MEK-ERK or PI3K-Akt (7Monje P.V. Bartlett Bunge M. Wood P.M. Glia. 2006; 53: 649-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Neuregulins comprise an extensive family of growth factors (8Falls D.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 14-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar), which are the specific ligands for ErbB/HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) (9Alroy I. Yarden Y.

A membrane-bound form of neuregulin is a major component of the axonal mitogen that regulates SC proliferation by axonal contact in peripheral nerves (11Morrissey T.K. Levi A.D. Nuijens A.

BioEssays. 2000; 22: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). SCs express ErbB2 and ErbB3 isoforms that signal as a heterodimeric complex-activating multiple pathways, including Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-PDK-Akt (12Garratt A.N. Britsch S. Birchmeier C. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 13Vartanian T. Goodearl A. Viehover A. Fischbach G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). ErbB2 and ErbB3 complement each other to create an effective signal transducer complex. The extracellular domain of ErbB3 is required for binding to neuregulin, and the tyrosine kinase activity of ErbB2 is required for receptor auto- and cross-phosphorylation, inasmuch ErbB2 lacks a binding domain for neuregulin and ErbB3 lacks a catalytically active intracellular kinase domain (14Citri A. Skaria K.B. Yarden Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 54-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, SH3-containing molecules, such as the adaptor protein c-Shc and the regulatory subunit of PI3K (p85), are recruited to specific phosphorylated tyrosine residues on each activated receptor leading to the activation of Ras-ERK and PI3K-Akt, respectively (9Alroy I. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Intracellular cAMP directly activates two main effectors: protein kinase A (PKA) and the newly identified exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC), an exchange factor for the small GTPase Rap1 (15de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar). Together, PKA and EPAC appear to account for most of the effects of cAMP in mammalian cells (15de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar, 16Bos J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 17Kopperud R. Krakstad C. Selheim F. Doskeland S.O. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cAMP can regulate the flow of signals through other pathways, a function that is referred to as “gating” by cAMP (18Iyengar R. Science. 1996; 271: 461-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In particular, cAMP has been shown to regulate the Ras-ERK pathway (19Stork P.J. Schmitt J.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 258-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). For example, the activation of PKA by cAMP does not affect the proliferation of NIH3T3 cells, but it inhibits Ras-stimulated ERK activity and Ras-mediated transformation (20Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar) by phosphorylating Raf1 and reducing its kinase activity (21Hafner S. Adler H.S. Mischak H. Janosch P. Heidecker G. Wolfman A. Pippig S. Lohse M. Ueffing M. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6696-6703Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, the regulation of neuregulin-induced ERK and Akt signaling by cAMP in SCs can be also considered an example of cAMP-mediated gating; however, the underlying mechanism is unknown. Therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate how signals from neuregulin and cAMP interact to regulate ERK and Akt activation and S-phase progression in SCs. Using a combination of pharmacological inhibitors of PKA and pathway-selective cAMP analogs, we found evidence supporting an involvement of PKA, but not EPAC, in increasing the activation of the ErbB2-ErbB3 co-receptor. PKA activity was sufficient to enhance the neuregulin-induced phosphorylation of specific activating tyrosine residues in both ErbB2 and ErbB3 and thereby enhance both MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt signaling. PKA activity was not sufficient, however, to replace neuregulin to initiate ErbB2 auto- and trans-phosphorylating activity toward ErbB3 or the activation of downstream MEK or PI3K signaling. Yet, PKA directly phosphorylated ErbB2 on at least one highly conserved PKA phospho-acceptor site, Thr-686, a transmodulatory site with a previously suggested role in enhancing the activation of ligand-activated heterodimerizing ErbB2 subpopulations (22Gulliford T. Ouyang X. Epstein R.J. Cell Signal. 1999; 11: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide evidence indicating that PKA synergistically enhances neuregulin-dependent ErbB2-ErbB3 activation and DNA synthesis in SCs through a mechanism that requires the direct phosphorylation of ErbB2 on Thr-686. We propose a model of ErbB2-ErbB3 regulation by PKA-mediated gating, which guarantees effective signal amplification into key pathways required for proliferation, without compromising the high specificity of the neuregulin-ErbB interaction or downstream signaling events.

The expression vectors encoding the full-length human ErbB2 and ErbB3 sequences, pcDNAIII-ErbB2 and pcDNAIII-ErbB3, respectively, were provided by Dr. Kermit Carraway III. The expression vector pcDNAIII-PKA catalytic subunit was provided by Dr. J. Silvio Gutkind. Primary Cultures of Adult-derived Human Schwann Cells and Peripheral Nerve Fibroblasts—Human peripheral nerve tissue, consisting of nerve roots comprising the cauda equina, was provided by the Life Alliance Organ Recovery Agency at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. Nerve fragments were incubated 6–8 days at 37 °C in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone), and 2 μm forskolin and 10 nm neuregulin (D10/FN medium). For dissociation, connective tissue-free nerve fascicles were incubated in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 0.5 mg/ml collagenase type I (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ), and 2.5 mg/ml dispase II (Roche Applied Science) overnight at 37 °C. The resulting cell suspension was plated onto mouse laminin-coated tissue culture dishes in D10/FN medium and allowed to grow until confluency. SCs were resuspended and purified by immunopanning with monoclonal antibodies against primate NGFR p75 (hybridoma supernatant, ATCC). The purity of the cultures was 96–99% based on immunostaining with anti-S100 (Dako), a protein expressed specifically in SCs. Cells were used for experiments between 2 and 8 population doublings (1–3 passages). Fibroblasts from cauda equina were established by cultivating dissociated cell preparations on non-coated plastic dishes in DMEM containing 10% FBS without mitogens. The absence of neuregulin in the culture medium and an inappropriate substrate strongly retards the proliferation and survival of SCs, whereas the absence of forskolin allows fibroblasts to proliferate rapidly and override the growth of remaining SCs. Cultures obtained were >98% fibroblasts. [3H]Thymidine Incorporation Assays—Sub-confluent cultures of SCs growing on poly-l-Lysine (PLL)-laminin-coated 12-well plates (100,000 cells/well) or 24-well plates (50,000 cells/well) were deprived of mitogens for 2 days in DMEM-10% FBS and then for 1 day in HEPES-buffered DMEM containing 1% FBS. SCs return to quiescence following removal of the mitogenic stimulus for 3 days. The presence of a non-mitogenic concentration of FBS in the culture medium was essential to maintain cell attachment and prevent the loss of cells by apoptosis induced by serum removal. Cells were exposed to medium containing [3H]thymidine (0.25 μCi/ml) under the conditions described in the figure legends. As an ErbB/HER agonist, we used a neuregulin peptide consisting of the EGF homology domain of β1-heregulin (hereafter referred to as “neuregulin”) that is sufficient to bind and activate ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimers (23Barbacci E.G.

Glia. 2006; 53: 649-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, a concentration of 10 nm neuregulin and 2 μm forskolin was used for all stimulation experiments. 48 h after stimulation, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with 300 μl of Solvable™ and incorporated tritium in the cells was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Cultures were assayed in triplicate samples in each condition. Before lysis and tritium counting, cells were co-labeled with Cell Tracker Green (5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate, Molecular Probes) and the nuclear dye Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) and monitored live by fluorescence microscopy. No indication of reduced metabolic activity or induced apoptotic nuclei was observed for any of the treatments. Cell Lines—HEK293T cells (ATCC) were routinely cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin-gentamycin (Invitrogen) on a PLL substrate. Transient Transfections—Cultures of HEK293T cells were allowed to grow to sub-confluency in 24-well PLL-coated dishes and then transfected overnight with the FuGENE 6 Reagent in DMEM-HEPES without FBS (0.25 μg of total plasmid DNA/well), according to the protocol suggested by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). The total amount of transfected DNA was made equivalent by adding the control plasmid, pcDNAIII-β-gal, an expression vector for the enzyme β-galactosidase. At 24 h post-transfection, medium was replaced and cells were subjected to stimulation followed by cell lysis and Western blotting analysis, as described below. Single cell suspensions (5 × 106 cells) of adult human SCs obtained from exponentially growing cultures were transfected using the Nucleofection method (4 μg of total plasmid DNA/transfection), according to the instructions suggested by the manufacturer (Oligodendrocyte Nucleofection Kit, program A-33, Amaxa Biosystems). After transfection, SCs were initially plated on PLL+laminin-coated six-well dishes in DMEM containing 10% FBS and then re-plated 4 h later to 24-well dishes (50,000 cells/well) for cell proliferation assays and Western blotting analysis. For experimentation, stimulation of transfected SCs was done 24-post transfection in HEPES-buffered DMEM containing 1% FBS. Transfection efficiency for SCs was 40–60% based on green fluorescent protein fluorescence from the expression vector pMAX-green fluorescent protein (Amaxa Biosystems), which was routinely used as a positive control to estimate transfection efficiency. Western Blots—Protein samples from total cell lysates were prepared by resuspending the cells in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin) and phosphatase inhibitors (phosphatase cocktails I and II, Sigma). Lysates were combined with SDS sample buffer (400 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 50% glycerol, 500 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml bromphenol blue), followed by 10 min boiling. Protein aliquots were resolved in denaturing polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE), and fractionated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-Buffer saline (TBS) containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TBS-T) and incubated overnight with the appropriate dilution of each primary antibody (1:1000 unless otherwise noted). The membranes were washed three times with TBS-T prior to incubation with horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, 1:10,000 (Promega, Madison, WI). Immunoreactive protein bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using ECL Advanced or ECL Plus, depending on signal intensity, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). For densitometric analysis, films were scanned at high resolution using a Bio-Rad Fluor-S MultiImager, and the relative optic density of the protein bands was estimated using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Detection of PKA Activity—The kinase activity of PKA was assessed by immunodetecting the phosphorylation of cellular PKA substrates using an antibody that recognizes PKA-specific phospho-motifs ([RR]-X-[S*/T*]) in target proteins, either in fixed cells (immunostaining) or in cell lysates (Western blot). Curiously, phospho-PKA substrate antibodies detected only a limited set of substrates in cAMP-treated SCs, most likely due to the fact that only a proportion of the total cellular substrates phosphorylated by PKA, would be recognized by this specific antibody. Moreover, phosphorylated targets recognized by anti-PKA substrate antibodies were mostly cytoplasmic/membrane proteins based on immunostaining detection. For the immunostaining experiments, SCs were grown in 24-well plates coated sequentially with PLL and laminin and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (20 min, room temperature) followed by cold methanol (10 min, 4 °C). Cells were then washed three times with TBS and incubated with 5% normal goat serum in TBS (TBS-NGS) for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with anti-phospho-PKA substrate antibody (1:200 in TBS-NGS, overnight, 4 °C) and rinsed three times with TBS prior to incubation with anti-rabbit Alexa-594-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:200 in TBS-NGS, 1 h, room temperature). Cells were mounted with Vectashield containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and analyzed by conventional fluorescence microscopy. Digitalized images from immunofluorescence microscopy and from Western blot films were processed by using Adobe Photoshop version 7.0 and arranged for presentation using Adobe Illustrator CS3. In Vitro Kinase Assays—The phosphorylation of ErbB2 by PKA was assayed in vitro by following a standard PKA kinase assay, using a purified preparation of PKA catalytic subunit (Promega) and including purified GST-HER/ErbB2 679–1255 (human, recombinant, Calbiochem) as a substrate in the reaction mixture (PKA assay kit, Promega). The reactions were initiated by the addition of 1 μl of purified PKA and allowed to proceed for 30 min at room temperature before denaturing the proteins (10 min, boiling bath) and assaying the products by Western blot using anti-phospho PKA substrate and anti-phospho-ErbB2 Thr-686 antibodies. Reactions were carried out in the absence and presence of a specific PKA inhibitor peptide (PKI-[6–22]-NH2, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), which highly discriminates between PKA and protein kinase C. ErbB/HER Sequence Analysis and Site-directed Mutagenesis— The available protein sequence of ErbB/HER2 from the different species analyzed was obtained from GenBank™ (NCBI), and the search for potential consensus PKA-specific motifs ([KR]-X-[T/S]) was done with the program PROSITE (free internet resource). Individual point mutation of Thr-686 on pcDNAIII-ErbB2 was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (BPS Bioscience, mutagenesis service). Mutagenesis primers were designed to introduce an ACG to GCG mutation (Thr to Ala) to generate an alanine replacement of Thr-686 in the full-length ErbB2 coding sequence. Rap1 Assays—To measure the nucleotide exchange activity of EPAC, we assayed the GTP-binding activity of its downstream effector Rap1, by using a standard method that involves the precipitation of GTP-bound Rap1 molecules by affinity binding to purified recombinant Ral-GDS-agarose beads (Rap1 activation assay, Roche Applied Science). SCs were allowed to grow up to 70–80% confluency in 10-cm plates coated with PLL-laminin (4 × 106 cells/dish), starved as described before and then stimulated with cAMP analogs for 30 min. The plates were washed with iced-cold TBS, and the cells were rapidly resuspended in lysis buffer. All subsequent steps were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Purified samples containing GTP-bound Rap1 were denatured in SDS loading buffer, boiled, resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-total Rap1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1000). Samples from total cell lysates were analyzed in parallel as controls for total Rap1 expression. The Activation of PKA, but Not EPAC, Is Sufficient to Synergistically Enhance the Neuregulin-stimulated Proliferation of SCs—The mechanism underlying the action of cAMP in neuregulin-induced SC proliferation remains mostly undefined. As a first approach, we investigated the role of PKA or EPAC, by the use of pathway-selective cell-permeable cAMP analogs (25Rehmann H. “Experimental Procedures” Enzymol. 2005; 407: 159-173Google Scholar). We compared the effect of 6-Bnz-cAMP and 8-CPT-cAMP, two widely used PKA- and EPAC-selective cAMP analogs, respectively (26Enserink J.M. Christensen A.E. de Rooij J. van Triest M. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Doskeland S.O. Blank J.L. Bos J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), for their ability to regulate neuregulin/HER-dependent SC proliferation. By measuring the incorporation of [3H]thymidine in adult-derived human SCs, we observed that the selective activation of PKA by 6-Bnz-cAMP was sufficient to synergistically and dose dependently enhance neuregulin-stimulated S-phase entry, resembling the effects of forskolin, a direct activator of adenylyl cyclases (Fig. 1A) and non-selective analogs of cAMP, such as db-cAMP and 8-Br-cAMP (Fig. 1D). In contrast, when SCs were stimulated with neuregulin in the presence of 8-CPT-cAMP, neuregulin-stimulated S-phase entry was significantly reduced (Fig. 1B), without diminishing the metabolic activity or the survival of the cells (not shown). In addition, the activation of EPAC by 8-CPT-cAMP was sufficient to antagonize the synergistic action of 6-Bnz-cAMP and forskolin on neuregulin-induced S-phase entry (not shown). Controls for the relative potency and specificity of the cAMP analogs used in the experiments are shown in Fig. 1C. Similarly, the PKA-selective analogs 6-PHE-cAMP and 6-MB-cAMP synergistically enhanced, whereas the EPAC-selective analog PME-cAMP reduced, neuregulin-induced S-phase entry (Fig. 1D), supporting opposite roles of PKA and EPAC in mediating the effects of cAMP in SC proliferation. Consistent with these results and with the previously proposed role of PKA in cell cycle progression in SCs (27Kim H.A. DeClue J.E. Ratner N. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 236-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), pretreatment with H-89, a potent pharmacological inhibitor of PKA kinase activity (28Lochner A. Moolman J.A. Cardiovasc. Drug Rev. 2006; 24: 261-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), dose dependently reduced the incorporation of [3H]thymidine in SCs stimulated with neuregulin in the presence of either forskolin or 6-Bnz-cAMP (Fig. 1E). Similarly, preincubation with either the inactive cAMP stereoisomer, Rp-cAMP, or with a cell-permeable active peptide from the heat-stable protein kinase inhibitor (myr-PKI), effectively antagonized the action of cAMP on SC proliferation (data not shown). To rule out a possible contribution of fibroblasts to the observed results, we determined the effect of cAMP on the proliferation of human fibroblasts from adult peripheral nerve. These fibroblasts were unresponsive to neuregulin (not shown), but they were responsive to fetal bovine serum (Fig. 1F) and to platelet-derived growth factor and fibroblast growth factor1 (not shown). As opposed to SCs, forskolin, but not 6-Bnz-cAMP, decreased the incorporation of [3H]thymidine induced by serum (Fig. 1F), platelet-derived growth factor and fibroblast growth factor1 (not shown), confirming the cell type specificity of cAMP action in SC cultures. Interestingly, stimulation with 8-CPT-cAMP was sufficient to dramatically reduce both serum- (Fig. 1F) and growth factor-induced (not shown) proliferation, further supporting a role of EPAC in mediating the anti-proliferative effects of cAMP in both SCs and fibroblasts. Overall, these results suggest that the regulation of S-phase progression by cAMP is not only cell type-specific but also highly dependent on the particular set of effectors activated by cAMP. Whereas EPAC activation converted cAMP from a proliferative to an anti-proliferative signal in SCs, the activation of PKA was by itself not only required but also sufficient to synergistically promote S-phase entry in the presence of neuregulin. cAMP Synergistically Enhances the Neuregulin-stimulated Tyrosine Phosphorylation of ErbB3 and the Activation of PI3K/Akt Signaling— cAMP signaling potentially converges at multiple levels in the signaling axes Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK (19Stork P.J.

https://openalex.org/W1994589886,"An image-based phenotypic screen was developed to identify small molecule regulators of intracellular traffic. Using this screen we found that AG1478, a previously known inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor, had epidermal growth factor receptor-independent activity in inducing the disassembly of the Golgi in human cells. Similar to brefeldin A (BFA), a known disrupter of the Golgi, AG1478 inhibits the activity of small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor. Unlike BFA, AG1478 exhibits low cytotoxicity and selectively targets the cis-Golgi without affecting endosomal compartment. We show that AG1478 inhibits GBF1, a large nucleotide exchange factor for the ADP-ribosylation factor, in a Sec7 domain-dependent manner and mimics the phenotype of a GBF1 mutant that has an inactive mutation. The treatment with AG1478 leads to the recruitment of GBF1 to the vesicular-tubular clusters adjacent to the endoplasmic reticulum exit sites, a step only transiently observed previously in the presence of BFA. We propose that the treatment with AG1478 delineates a membrane trafficking intermediate step that depends upon the Sec7 domain.

The Golgi apparatus, an intracellular membrane-bound structure organized as a series of stacked cisternae and tubules, plays an important role in packaging and transporting macro-molecules. The cisternae stack can be divided into five functional regions: the cis-Golgi network, cis-Golgi, medial Golgi, trans-Golgi, and trans-Golgi network.

The integrity and functions of the Golgi depend critically on the small membrane-bound vesicles that shuttle macromolecules in and out of the Golgi stacks (5Altan-Bonnet N. Sougrat R. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 364-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF), a small GTPase of the Ras superfamily, plays a major role in driving Golgi membrane trafficking by recruiting coatomer (COPI) to Golgi membranes in the exocytotic pathway. The cellular activity of ARFs is stimulated by the Sec7 family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which promote the exchange of inactive GDP-bound forms to active GTP-bound forms (6D'Souza-Schorey C. Chavrier P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar, 7Donaldson J.G. Honda A. Weigert R. Biochim. Biophys.

GBF1, the only known GEF localized to the cis-Golgi, plays an important role in mediating protein trafficking between the ER and the cis-Golgi (8Claude A. Zhao B.P. Kuziemsky C.E. Dahan S.

Brefeldin A (BFA), a lactone isolated from fungi, interferes with anterograde transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus by binding to the ARF1-GDP-Sec7 complex to inhibit the Sec7 guanine nucleotide exchange activity, which in turn prevents the activation of ARF (10Renault L.

The treatment with BFA causes rapid but reversible dispersal of the Golgi apparatus leading to the mixing of the cis-Golgi with the ER and vesicularization of the trans-Golgi network (12Tsai S.C.

Cell Biol. 1998; 109: 571-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). BFA has pleiotropic effects on intracellular organelles other than the Golgi. For example, BFA induces extensive formation of membrane tubules from endosome compartment (14Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L. Tipper C. Amherdt M. Orci L. Klausner R.D.

In an effort to discover novel small molecules as tools to study membrane trafficking, we developed an image-based assay for compounds that can induce disassembly of the Golgi.

The coverslips were again washed with TBST three times, stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1 μg/ml; Sigma), and mounted on slides with fluorescent mounting medium (DAKO). The cells were imaged using a fluorescent microscopy (IX81; Olympus) with a 100× oil 1.35 NA objective and Image-Pro Express software (Media Cybernetics). Confocal images (see Fig. 8) were acquired using an LSM 510 (Carl Zeiss) with a 100× oil 1.35 NA objective, and a single focal plane (0.9 um) was analyzed. For Fig. 1, the analysis for Golgi dispersal course was performed using CellProfiler software. The analysis pipeline used to quantify images by CellProfiler was, briefly, as follows: after correcting the illumination pattern across the field of view for each channel, the nuclei were identified based on the DNA-stained images. Then a ring 36 pixels around each nucleus was defined as a proxy for the cytoplasm. Within each cell, the Golgi were identified based on the GM130-stained image. Over 300 features were measured for each cell in each image; the most reliable measure of the change in Golgi localization was found to be a texture measure of the GM130 staining within each cell (sum average, at a scale of 5, nucleus + cytoplasm together). Example processed images are shown in supplemental Fig. S3.FIGURE 1AG1478 treatment causes Golgi fragmentation in H4 cells.

H4 cells were co-transfected EGFR siRNA or negative control siRNA with pEGFP-N1 plasmid at 10:1 ratio by Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). After 24 h, the cells were treated with compounds and analyzed by Western blotting for EGFR siRNA effect. The experiments were repeated twice with consistent results. ARF1-GTP Pulldown Assay—The pulldown assay to assess the activity of ARF1 by a GST-VHS-GAT-GGA3 protein were performed as described previously (21Shinotsuka C. Yoshida Y. Kawamoto K. Takatsu H. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9468-9473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 22Yoon H.Y. Bonifacino J.S. Randazzo P.A. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 404: 316-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The stable H4-ARF1-GFP cells were transiently transfected with GBF1-GFP for 24 h or pEGFP-C1 or vector alone and then treated with compounds. The cells were lysed with pulldown buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors). The cell lysates were cleared by glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with beads containing 50 μg of GST-VHS-GAT-GGA3 protein for 2 h at 4 °C. The bound proteins were removed and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-GFP antibody. Cell Fractionation—The cell fractionation assay was performed as described previously (23Szul T. Garcia-Mata R. Brandon E. Shestopal S. Alvarez C. Sztul E. Traffic. 2005; 6: 374-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). H4 cells were grown on 100-cm dishes for 24 h and treated with compounds. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with ice-cold homogenization buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) by passaging 10 times through a 22-gauge needle and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove the unbroken cells. The postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C to obtain cytosol and membrane fraction. The supernatant was used as a cytosol fraction. The pellet was rinsed with homogenization buffer, dissolved in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and used as membrane fraction. Fractions containing same volume were analyzed by 6% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was detected by anti-GBF1, anti-calnexin, and antitubulin antibodies, respectively. Calnexin and tubulin were considered as standards for membrane and cytosol fraction. An Image-based Phenotypic Screen for Small Molecules That Disrupt the Golgi—We established a H4 human glioblastoma cell line stably expressing a p58-YFP fusion protein (H4-p58-YFP). p58-YFP normally appears in peripheral punctate structures close to the cis-Golgi (Fig. 1A). Using H4-p58-YFP cells, we developed an image-based assay using fluorescent microscopy and screened the ICCB Known Bioactive Library for compounds that may have effects on Golgi morphology (Biomol catalogue number 2840). H4-p58-YFP cells were plated in 96-well plates for 24 h and treated with different compounds individually at concentration of 3∼12 μm. 0.1% DMSO was used as a negative control. After incubating with the compounds for 4, 8, and 24 h, the images were visually examined using fluorescence microscopy. The screen was carried out in duplicates. Most of the compounds were found to have no effect on Golgi morphology. Twenty compounds were isolated as Golgi-disrupting agents. These include some well known Golgi disrupting reagents such as brefeldin A, bafilomycin A1, and monensin (data not shown). Here we focus on tyrphostin AG1478, the most potent novel Golgi dispersing compound identified from our screen. It has a structure distinct from that of BFA (Fig. 1B). AG1478 Is a Potent and Reversible Disruptor of the Golgi—The treatment of H4 cells with AG1478 caused p58-YFP to redistribute from its normal perinuclear compact localization to a dispersed localization throughout the cytosol in a manner very similar to that of BFA (Fig. 1A). The Golgi dispersing effect of AG1478 in the parental H4 cells that do not express p58-YFP was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence using an antibody against GM130, a Golgi matrix protein (24Nakamura N. Rabouille C. Watson R. Nilsson T. Hui N. Slusarewicz P. Kreis T.E. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1715-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). GM130 was redistributed to peripheral punctate structures throughout the cytoplasm after the treatment of AG1478 (Fig. 1C). We quantified the Golgi dispersing effect of AG1478 using the image analysis software, CellProfiler (25Carpenter A.E. Jones T.R. Lamprecht M.R. Clarke C. Kang I.H. Friman O. Guertin D.A. Chang J.H. Lindquist R.A. Moffat J. Golland P. Sabatini D.M. Genome Biol. 2006; 7: R100Crossref PubMed Scopus (3178) Google Scholar, 26Lamprecht MR S.D. Carpenter A.E. BioTechniques. 2007; 42: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). We found that AG1478 can rapidly disperse the cis-Golgi protein GM130 with a half-time of ∼10 min and an EC50 of 3.35 μm (Fig. 1, D and E). The effect of AG1478 on the Golgi was fully reversible, because the normal Golgi structure reappeared in the perinuclear area after the cells were cultured in medium without AG1478 for 3 h (Fig. 1F). Unlike nocodazole or bafilomycin A1, which disperse the Golgi through their effects on the microtubules and intracellular pH, AG1478 had no apparent effect on the cytoskeleton or intracellular pH. The treatment of AG1478 for 1 h also did not have any obvious effect on the intracellular ATP levels (supplemental Fig. S1). Furthermore, the ability of AG1478 to disrupt the Golgi was not associated with significant cytotoxicity; incubation of H4 cells in the presence of 14 μm AG1478 for 24 h had no detectable effect on cell survival. After 48 h, a loss of 25% of viability was observed that could be rescued by a caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. In contrast, the treatment of H4 cells with 5 μm BFA for 24 or 48 h led to a significant loss of cell viability that could not be blocked by z-VAD-fmk (supplemental Fig. S2). From these results, we conclude that dispersing Golgi per se is not affecting the viability of H4 cells. Therefore, the cytotoxicity of BFA may not be directly linked to its ability to disrupt the Golgi. The Effect of AG1478 on the Golgi Is Independent of EGFR—AG1478 was shown to be a highly potent inhibitor of the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase (27Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar, 28Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar). Indeed, the treatment of H4 cells with 250 nm AG1478 was sufficient to block EGFR phosphorylation, which is much lower than that of the EC50 required to disperse the Golgi (Fig. 2A). To further determine whether the Golgi dispersing effect of AG1478 was associated with its inhibitory activity for EGFR, we treated H4 cells with multiple different EGFR inhibitors individually (AG213, Lavendustin A, and RG-14620), inhibitors for other RTPKs (AG-370, AG-879, and AG-825), as well as genistein, which is a general inhibitor of tyrosine protein kinase. None of these inhibitors demonstrated a similar Golgi dispersing effect even at very high concentrations (50-100 μm) and after prolonged treatment time (2-4 h) (data not show). Thus, the Golgi dispersing ability of AG1478 is not shared by the other known tyrosine kinase inhibitors tested. To formally exclude the involvement of EGFR, we used siRNA to decrease the expression of EGFR. Expression of EGFR siRNAs for 24 h significantly decreased the cellular levels of EGFR (Fig. 2B), but reducing the expression of EGFR had no effect on the Golgi structure per se nor on the Golgi dispersing effect of AG1478 (Fig. 2, C-F). From these results, we conclude that AG1478 has a distinct activity in inducing Golgi dispersing that is independent from its activity toward EGFR. Rodent Cells Are Resistant to the Golgi Dispersal by AG1478 but Not BFA—To characterize the Golgi dispersing effect of AG1478, we examined whether the Golgi structures in multiple cell lines are sensitive to AG1478. AG1478 showed a similar Golgi dispersing effect in different human cell lines tested, including HeLa, HepG2, A549, and Hs-578Bst fibroblast cells (supplemental Table S1). Surprisingly, AG1478 could not disrupt the Golgi structures in multiple rodent cell lines tested, including two rat cell lines, Rat2 and NRK, and a mouse cell line, NIH3T3. The Golgi complex marked by anti-GM130 antibody in Rat2 cells remained intact even after the treatment with AG1478 at concentrations as high as 140 μm (50 μg/ml) prolonged incubation (Fig. 3A). In contrast, Rat2 cells were fully sensitive to the Golgi dispersing effect of BFA (Fig. 3A). To further ascertain the resistance of rodent cell lines to AG1478, we evaluated other markers of Golgi such as GalT, ERGIC53/p58, ARF1, β-COP, and GBF1 in AG1478-treated Rat2 cells. None of these proteins was redistributed from its normal perinuclear compact localization (data not shown). We also examined the effect of AG1478 in PtK1 and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, which were kangaroo rat and dog epithelial cell lines, respectively, and reported to be resistant to BFA (29Low S.H. Wong S.H. Tang B.L. Tan P. Subramaniam V.N. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17729-17732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Ktistakis N.T. Roth M.G. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1009-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The Madin-Darby canine kidney and PtK1 cells were also resistant to the effect of AG1478 in dispersing the Golgi. On the other hand, AG1478 inhibited the EGFR signaling pathway in both human and rodent cells (Fig. 3B), supporting the conclusion that the effect of AG1478 for dispersing the Golgi is independent of its activity on EGFR. Taken together, these results suggest that AG1478 targets a molecular entity that exhibits species specificity for its Golgi dispersing effect. Differential Effects of AG1478 on the Proteins Associated the cis-Golgi and trans-Golgi—To understand the mechanism by which AG1478 disperses the Golgi, we compared the activity of AG1478 with that of BFA for their effects on the distribution of Golgi-associated proteins. COPI has been shown to be the most important coat protein in facilitating retrograde intracellular transport from the Golgi complex to the ER. Recruitment of COPI to the membrane requires the activation of ARF1 (31Donaldson J.G. Kahn R.A. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Klausner R.D. Science. 1991; 254: 1197-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 32Rabouille C. Klumperman J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 812-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In control cells, most of COPI and ARF1 are localized on the cis-Golgi membrane. The addition of AG1478 caused a rapid release of COPI and ARF1 into the cytoplasm (Fig. 4, A and B). The treatment with AG1478 also resulted in the redistribution of GBF1 from the Golgi region to a dispersed localization throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 4C), an effect similar to that of BFA (33Zhao X. Claude A. Chun J. Shields D.J. Presley J.F. Melançon P. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3743-3753Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Sec13 is a component of the COPII coat that mediates vesicle budding from ER exit site (ERES) (34Hammond A.T. Glick B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3013-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 35Tang B.L. Peter F. Krijnse-Locker J. Low S.H. Griffiths G. Hong W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 256-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The treatment with AG1478 had no effect on the distribution of Sec13-GFP, which is localized to the punctate ERES, suggesting that the treatment of AG1478 does not perturb the COPII-dependent ER export machinery (Fig. 4D). The treatment with AG1478, however, caused the redistribution of p58/ERGIC53, a marker for the VTCs, from its normal compact localization to a dispersed cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 4E). GM130, a Golgi matrix protein, was also redistributed to the peripheral punctate structures after treatment by AG1478, similar to that of BFA (Fig. 4F). The peripheral punctate structures of p58/ERGIC53 and GM130 were similar to the “Golgi remnants” after BFA treatment (36Orci L. Perrelet A. Ravazzola M. Wieland F.T. Schekman R. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11089-11093Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 37Seemann J. Jokitalo E. Pypaert M. Warren G. Nature. 2000; 407: 1022-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). GalT, a Golgi-resident enzyme, was found in both the ER and some punctate structures after the treatment with AG1478 (Fig. 4G). Taken together, the effects of AG1478 on the proteins localized in the cis-Golgi are very similar to that of BFA. We also compared the effects of AG1478 and BFA on proteins associated with the trans-Golgi. After incubation of H4 cells with either compound for 1 h, 5 μm BFA completely dispersed the trans-Golgi network marker p230 from the perinuclear region into the cytosol, whereas after AG1478 treatment p230 remained as small punctate structures with partial redistribution to the cytoplasm (Fig. 4H) (38Gleeson P.A. Anderson T.J. Stow J.L. Griffiths G. Toh B.H. Matheson F. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2811-2821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Longer treatment with AG1478 (2-3 h) still did not completely disperse the punctate structures (data not shown). The effects of AG1478 on adaptin γ and δ, which are markers for AP-1 and AP-2, were similar to that of p230 (Fig. 4, I and J). Taken together, these results suggest that the cis-Golgi is more sensitive to AG1478 than the trans-Golgi. The treatment of BFA is known to cause extensive formation of membrane tubules from endosomes (15Wood S.A. Park J.E. Brown W.J. Cell. 1991; 67: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 39Stephen G.M. Lucinda C. Hsiao-Ping H.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Using Alexa 568-labeled transferrin, we analyzed the effect of AG1478 on the formation of tubular endosomes. BFA induced enlargement and tubulation of transferrinpositive endosomes, but AG1478 had no effect (Fig. 4K), suggesting that AG1478 has no effect on early/recycling endosomes as BFA. In addition, the treatment with AG1478 had no effect on the distribution of lysosomes systems, as marked by LAMP3, similar to that of BFA (Fig. 4L). Because of these similarities and differences, we conclude that AG1478 might target a similar target as BFA in dispersing the Golgi, but AG1478 might be more selective because it does not affect the endosomal compartment. AG1478 Blocks ARF1 Activity in Human Cells—Our data described above suggest that in AG1478-treated cells, ARF1 might reside in an inactive state in the cytosol, similar to that of BFA-treated cells. To measure the ARF1 activity in AG1478-treated cells, we used an ARF1-GTP pull-down assay that monitors the amount of ARF1-GTP using a GST-GGA3-GAT domain fusion protein (21Shinotsuka C. Yoshida Y.

https://openalex.org/W2022894749,"The cause of the current increase in obesity in westernized nations is poorly understood but is frequently attributed to a 'thrifty genotype,' an evolutionary predisposition to store calories in times of plenty to protect against future scarcity. In modern, industrialized environments that provide a ready, uninterrupted supply of energy-rich foods at low cost, this genetic predisposition is hypothesized to lead to obesity. Children are also exposed to this 'obesogenic' environment; however, whether such early dietary experience has developmental effects and contributes to adult vulnerability to obesity is unknown. Using mice, we tested the hypothesis that dietary experience during childhood and adolescence affects adult obesity risk. We gave mice unlimited or no access to sucrose for a short period post-weaning and measured sucrose-seeking, food consumption, and weight gain in adulthood. Unlimited access to sucrose early in life reduced sucrose-seeking when work was required to obtain it. When high-sugar/high-fat dietary options were made freely-available, however, the sucrose-exposed mice gained more weight than mice without early sucrose exposure. These results suggest that early, unlimited exposure to sucrose reduces motivation to acquire sucrose but promotes weight gain in adulthood when the cost of acquiring palatable, energy dense foods is low. This study demonstrates that early post-weaning experience can modify the expression of a 'thrifty genotype' and alter an adult animal's response to its environment, a finding consistent with evidence of pre- and peri-natal programming of adult obesity risk by maternal nutritional status. Our findings suggest the window for developmental effects of diet may extend into childhood, an observation with potentially important implications for both research and public policy in addressing the rising incidence of obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2049304197,"Background P53 activation can trigger various outcomes, among them reversible growth arrest or cellular senescence. It is a live debate whether these outcomes are influenced by quantitative or qualitative mechanisms. Furthermore, the relative contribution of p53 to Ras-induced senescence is also matter of controversy. Methodology/Principal Findings This study compared situations in which different signals drove senescence with increasing levels of p53 activation. The study revealed that the levels of p53 activation do not determine the outcome of the response. This is further confirmed by the clustering of transcriptional patterns into two broad groups: p53-activated or p53-inactivated, i.e., growth and cellular arrest/senescence. Furthermore, while p53-dependent transcription decreases after 24 hrs in the presence of active p53, senescence continues. Maintaining cells in the arrested state for long periods does not switch reversible arrest to cellular senescence. Together, these data suggest that a Ras-dependent, p53-independent, second signal is necessary to induce senescence. This study tested whether PPP1CA (the catalytic subunit of PP1α), recently identified as contributing to Ras-induced senescence, might be this second signal. PPP1CA is induced by Ras; its inactivation inhibits Ras-induced senescence, presumably by inhibiting pRb dephosphorylation. Finally, PPP1CA seems to strongly co-localize with pRb only during senescence. Conclusions The levels of p53 activation do not determine the outcome of the response. Rather, p53 activity seems to act as a necessary but not sufficient condition for senescence to arise. Maintaining cells in the arrested state for long periods does not switch reversible arrest to cellular senescence. PPP1CA is induced by Ras; its inactivation inhibits Ras-induced senescence, presumably by inhibiting pRb dephosphorylation. Finally, PPP1CA seems to strongly co-localize with pRb only during senescence, suggesting that PP1α activation during senescence may be the second signal contributing to the irreversibility of the senescent phenotype."

Kaita K.D. Xu Z. Ou J.H. Gong Y. Zhang M. Minuk G.Y. J. Hepatol. 2003; 39: 262-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). HBx has also been reported to induce matrix metalloproteinase-9 gene expression through activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT (PI3K/AKT) pathways (5Chung T.W. Lee Y.C. Kim C.H. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1123-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). HBc protein is a potent inductor of IL-18 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of healthy controls and patients with hepatitis B infection (4Manigold T. Bocker U. Chen J. Gundt J. Traber P.

Chem. 2003; 384: 203-212PubMed Google Scholar). These findings indicate that HBV proteins regulate host genes expression, which in turn may influence the course and severity of hepatic inflammation. Fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2)/fibroleukin, also known as fgl2 prothrombinase, has been cloned and identified to belong to the fibrinogen protein superfamily. Mouse Fgl2 (mFgl2) and human FGL2 (hFGL2) have been localized to chromosomes 5 and 7, respectively (11Parr R.L. Fung L. Reneker J. Myers-Mason N. Leibowitz J.L. Levy G. J.

In humans, expression of hFGL2 transcripts and protein was detected in liver as well as PBMC in patients with severe CHB, whereas only basal low expression of hFGL2 was seen in healthy controls or patients with mild CHB (16Levy G.A.

Although we have reported a critical role for hFGL2 in the pathogenesis of severe CHB, the underlying mechanism for its increased expression is unknown. The expression of mFgl2 mRNA transcription and protein is induced by IFN-γ in macrophages and TNF-α in endothelial cells, respectively (24Liu M. Mendicino M. Ning Q. Ghanekar A. He W. McGilvray I.

Other factors have also been reported to contribute to mFgl2 transcription. It has been reported that the nucleocapsid protein of mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV-3) induces transcription of mFgl2 and invokes hepatic nuclear factor 4α in mFgl2 gene expression (20Ning Q. Liu M. Kongkham P. Lai M.M. Marsden P.A. Tseng J. Pereira B. Belyavskyi M. Leibowitz J. Phillips M.J. Levy G. J. Biol.

MHV-3 induces mFgl2 gene transcription through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation (26McGilvray I.D. Lu Z. Wei A.C. Dackiw A.P. Marshall J.C. Kapus A. Levy G. Rotstein O.D. J.

We therefore postulate that hFGL2 gene transcription is regulated by encoded proteins of HBV, the most frequent cause of liver failure in Asia. In this study, we demonstrate that HBc and HBx initiate the transcription of hFGL2 gene through the transcription factor c-Ets-2 dependent on the activation of ERK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signal pathways in response to either HBc or HBx proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrated increased c-Ets-2 expression and activity of ERK and JNK in PBMC in association with severe CHB viral infection. Creation of HBs, HBc, and HBx Gene Eukaryotic Expression Plasmids—HBV DNA with HBV genotype B was isolated from serum of an informed patient with HBV DNA positive and used as template for PCR amplification to obtain HBc, HBs, and HBx entire gene. Three pairs of primers, C1/C2, S1/S2, and X1/X2 (C1, 5′-TTT GGG GCA TGG ACA TTG AC-3′, and C2, 5′-CCC ACC TTA TGA GTC CAA GG-3′; S1, 5′-AAC ATG GAC AAC ATC ACA TC-3′, and S2, 5′-CAA CTG CCA ATG ACA TAA CC-3′; and X1, 5′-ACG GAA TTC CAT GGC TGC TAG GCT G-3′, and X2, 5′-CGC TCT AGA TTG GAG TCT TGA ACA G-3′), were used accordingly to amplify HBc, HBs, and HBx genes with the products of 583, 747, and 520 bp, respectively. HBc, HBs, and HBx genes were cloned to PCR2.1 cloning vector (Invitrogen) and then subcloned into HindIII/XhoI (for HBc and HBs) or HindIII/XbaI (for HBx) site of pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen) to form eukaryotic expression plasmids pcDNA-HBc, pcDNA-HBs, and pcDNA-HBx. Creation of hFGL2 Promoter/Luciferase Reporter Constructs—hFGL2 promoter/luciferase reporter plasmid named hfgl2p (−1334)LUC was constructed as described previously (20Ning Q. Liu M. Kongkham P. Lai M.M. Marsden P.A. Tseng J. Pereira B. Belyavskyi M. Leibowitz J. Phillips M.J. Levy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9930-9936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). 5′-Truncation of the hFGL2 promoter in pGL2-Basic was carried out by PCR using hfgl2p(1334)LUC as the template. The upstream primers used were as follows: 5′-CTT ATG TCT TTC CTG CCT TC-3′ for hfgl2p(−998)LUC; 5′-GGC AAG AGA AGT TCA GGA C-3′ for hfgl2p(−817)LUC; 5′-GCA GCT ACT GGT TTT GAT G-3′ for hfgl2p(−712)LUC; 5′-TGA AGC AAA AGT CAA CTG C-3′ for hfgl2p(−568)LUC; 5′-AAT ACA GGC TCC CCA ATG C-3′ for hfgl2p(−467)LUC; and 5′-GTG AAT CTT GTT GGC TGT G-3′ for hfglp2(−243)LUC. The common downstream primer used was 5′-TTC GCC CAT CTT TAC AGTG-3′. The series PCR products were respectively cloned into PCR2.1 cloning vector and subcloned into pGL2-Basic plasmid at HindIII and XhoI sites to form six 5′ deletion hFGL2 promoter/luciferase reporter constructs. The promoter luciferase report plasmids were all sequenced to confirm the orientation and to verify the sequence. Transient Transfection—Transient transfection was conducted using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for CHO and HepG2 cells and Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen) for THP-1 cells according to the manufacturer's instruction. 1 μg of expressing plasmid pcDNA-HBc or pcDNA-HBs or pcDNA-HBx, 1 μg of hfgl2p(−1334)LUC DNA, 0.5 μg of β-galactosidase DNA (as a marker for transfection efficiency) in 100 μl of Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) were mixed by vortexing with 4 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 in 100 μl Opti-MEM medium. After incubation of the mixture at room temperature for 20 min, 0.8 ml of Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) was added to bring up the volume to 1 ml. 1 ml of the mixture was distributed into 1 well with CHO cells or HepG2 cells. After cells were cultured for 10–12 h, another 1 ml of culture medium was added to the well. Transfection was performed at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 36–48 h. Immunocytochemistry—CHO cells transfected with expressing vector pcDNA-HBc or pcDNA-HBs were stained with the anti-HBc or anti-HBs polyclonal antibody from rabbit (1:200 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight followed by incubation with a secondary biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (1:200 dilution). Solution of streptavidin-peroxidase was then added. As negative controls, CHO cells, either without transfection or transfected with pcDNA3.1(+) empty plasmid, were employed. Western Blotting Analysis—CHO cells transfected with pcDNA-HBx were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors for 30 min on ice, and whole cell lysate was obtained by subsequent centrifugation. Samples were heated at 100 °C for 5 min and cooled on ice. Fifty micrograms of protein from whole cell lysates was subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). Blocking was performed in 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated with specific monoclonal antibody against HBx (1: 400 dilution, Usbio Technology). Real Time Fluorescence Quantitative RT-PCR and Western Blotting Analysis of hFGL2 Expression—Total RNA (1 μl) from THP-1 cells transfected with pcDNA-HBc, pcDNA-HBs, or pcDNA-HBx was isolated and reverse-transcribed into cDNA using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse transcriptase (Fermentas) according to the manufacturer's standard protocol. Real time fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR was done with EvaGreen PCR reagents (Biotium) according to the manufacturer's standard protocol to detect hFGL2 and c-Ets-2 expression at the mRNA level. The upstream primer was 5′-ACT GTG ACA TGG AGA CCA TG-3′, and the downstream primer was 5′-TCC TTA CTC TTG GTC AGA AG-3′ for hFGL2 gene. For Western blotting, protein extracts from the THP-1 cells transfected with HBV-encoding protein expression plasmids were loaded and separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the proteins were detected with purified polyclonal antibody against hFGL2. Luciferase Assay—After transfection for 44–48 h, luciferase activity and β-galactosidase activity were assayed by using the luciferase and β-galactosidase enzyme assay systems (Promega) in CHO cells and HepG2 cells. Luciferase activity was normalized with the β-galactosidase activity in cell lysate and calculated as an average of three independent experiments. PGL2-Basic vector was used as a negative control. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Luciferase Assays—Constructs bearing mutant promoter variants of the hFGL2 gene were generated by PCR using the wild type hFGL2 promoter/luciferase report construct hfgl2p(−1334)LUC as template according to the manufacturer's protocol in the QuickChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Primers were designed according to manufacturer's instructions and produced by Invitrogen as shown in Table 1. The boldface and underlined nucleotides in Table 1 indicate mutated sequences. The PCR product with 1 μl of DpnI enzyme was incubated in 37 °C for 1 h. Then 5 μl of the reaction was taken out to transform XL1-Blue supercompetent cells, and finally mutants were verified by sequencing. hFGL2 promoter mutants were cotransfected with pcDNA-HBc or pcDNA-HBx expression plasmid and β-galactosidase construct in THP-1 cells. After transfection for 44 or 48 h, cells were lysed for detection of luciferase activity and β-galactosidase enzyme activity.TABLE 1Primer pairs used to construct hFGL2 promoter mutantsMutants nameSequence changeSense primer sequence (5′–3′)/antisense primer sequence (5′–3′)Nkx-2mutAATTAT to GCCGCGSense, CAG CTA CTG GTT TTG ATG AAA GAC UGCC GCG GTC CTT TTA AAT GGG TCT TAG ACAntisense, GTC TAA GAC CCA TTT AAA AGG ACUC GCG GCUG TCT TTC ATC AAA ACC AGT AGC TGLEF-1/c-EtsmutAGGA to CACGSense, CAC TAT GCT ACG GAC AAUC ACGU ATA GAA AGT AGC ACT TTT TTC TCC ACT AGAntisense, CTA GTG GAG AAA AAA GTG CTA CTT TCT ATUC GTGU TTG TCC GTA GCA TAG TGHSTFmutAGA to TCGSense, CAC TAT GCT ACG GAC AAA GGA ATUT CGUA AGT AGC ACT TTT TTC TCC ACT AGAntisense, CTA GTG GAG AAA AAA GTG CTA CTT UCGAUATT CCT TTG TCC GTA GCA TAG TGSRYmutTAG to GGCSense, GAA AGT AGC ACT TTT TTC TCC ACUG GCUT TTT CTT CTC TTT TTC AAG TAG ATG AAG CAntisense, GCT TCA TCT ACT TGA AAA AGA GAA GAA AAUG CCUG TGG AGA AAA AAG TGC TAC TTT CEvi-1mutCTT to GCCSense, GTA GCA CTT TTT TCT CCA CTA GTT TTUG CCU C TCT TTT TCA AGT AGA TGA AGCAntisense, GCT TCA TCT ACT TGA AAA AGA GUGG CUAA AAC TAG TGG AGA AAA AAG TGC TACMutations were made to the promoter sequence of the hFGL2 gene by a site-directed mutagenesis protocol as described under “Materials and Methods.” Sense and antisense primers were designed to encode the desired mutations.

The sense and antisense probes synthesized were annealed in anneal buffer (Invitrogen) to form double-stranded DNA probes. The probes were then labeled with 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Beijing Furui, China) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Takara, Japan) at 37 °C for 1 h. For each EMSA reaction, 5 μg of nuclear extracts from THP-1 cells after transfection were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 20 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 5 μg of poly(dI-dC), 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2). A total of 104 dpm of probes was added to each reaction, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. For competition studies, 100-fold cold DNA was added to the reaction. For supershift reactions, the nuclear extracts were incubated with 1 μg of specific antibody for 30 min at room temperature before adding DNA probe. The binding reactions were size-fractionated on a nondenaturing 8% polyacrylamide gel, and run at 150 V at room temperature for 2 h in Tris-glycine buffer. The sequence for probes (named LEF/cEts-hfgl2) with LEF/c-Ets but not HSTF cis-element site was 5′-CTT AGA CAT TTA GAC ATT AAT ATA CAC TAT GCT ACG GAC AAA GGA ATA G-3′; sequence for probes (named HSTF-hfgl2) with HSTF but not LEF/c-Ets cis-element site was 5′-GAA TAG AAA GTA GCA CTT TTT TCT CCA CTA GTT TTC TTC TCT TTT TC-3′; sequence for probes named 32P (−712/−568)-hfgl2 was 5′-ATT TAG ACA TTA ATA TAC ACT ATG CTA CGG ACA AAG GAA TAG AAA GTA GCA CTT TTT TCT CCA CTA GTT TTC TTC TCT TTT TCA AGT AGA T-3′. The double-stranded oligonucleotide 5′-TAT GTC CTT TTA AAT GGG TCG CCT AAG CAC CAG-3′ was used as a nonspecific and irrelevant competitor. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay (ChIP)—ChIP was performed on THP-1 cells using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) as described previously (24Liu M. Mendicino M. Ning Q. Ghanekar A. He W.

Briefly, chromatin was sonicated to an average size of 200–1000 bp. 5 μg following antibody were used, c-Ets-2 and normal rabbit IgG. All assays were repeated at least three times, with similar results. The following primer sets were used in ChIP experiments to amplify IP DNA: for c-Ets-2 of the hFGL2 proximal promoter (−740 to −534), 5′-ATT ACC AAA ATG TCG AAG GG-3′ and 5′-CAG CTT TCT GAC TAT TGC AG-3′; as a negative control, for a sequence of the hFGL2 gene exon (+8 to +164, relative to ATG), 5′-AGA TGA AGC TGG CTA ACT GG-3′ and 5′-GCC TCT TCG CAT TTC CCT CT-3′. The amount of target IP DNA was quantified on an ABI7900 HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystem) using SYBR green methodology. Confocal Microscopy—After blocking, the transfected and nontransfected THP-1 cells were first incubated with a polyclonal antibody from rabbit against the c-Ets-2 protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C temperature for 12 h followed by five washes in PBS. Cells were then incubated with a fluorescent isothiocyanate-conjugated goat IgG fraction against the rabbit IgG Fc fragment at room temperature for 1 h, followed by five washes with PBS. Then RNase was added to digest the RNA in the cells. The slides were stained by propidium iodide (50 μg/μl) for 30 min followed by five washes with PBS. shRNA-based Experiments—We constructed an shRNA plasmid for c-Ets-2 using retroviral vector pMSCVneo. The sequence of target for human c-Ets-2 was AAA CAC TGC AAG AAG TGC CAA. The sequence scramble of control shRNA was AGG TGC AAC AAC AAT GCA CAA. Mouse U6 promoter was amplified from mouse genomic DNA. We then cloned U6 promoter following sequences of hairpin of target gene into pMSCVneo to form shRNA interfering plasmids named c-Ets-2 shRNA and control shRNA, respectively. The c-Ets-2 shRNA construction was sequence-verified. After transfection with c-Ets-2 shRNA, RT-PCR and real time quantitative RT-PCR analysis were performed to determine c-Ets-2 expression at the mRNA level using the forward primer 5′-CGG AAG CTT AGA ATA TGG ACC AGG TAG CC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-TAA GGA TCC GTT CCT TGC CAA GGT TAC AC-3′. For Western blotting, protein extracts from the same number of cells were loaded and were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the proteins were detected with anti-c-Ets-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To detect the effect of c-Ets-2 shRNA on the hFGL2 transcription, 1 μg of hFGL2 luciferase report plasmid, 1 μg of HBV protein expression plasmid, 0.5 μg of β-galactosidase DNA, and 1 μg of shRNA were mixed and transfected into THP-1 cells based on the transfection manuals. Sudies in Patients with Viral Hepatitis B—Informed consent was obtained from human study participants, and the research protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China. Patients were recruited at Tongji Hospital, Hubei Province, China. Biochemical, histological, and clinical features were used to define patients with chronic viral hepatitis B (severe chronic viral hepatitis B versus mild chronic viral hepatitis B infection). Standard definitions for diagnostic criteria and laboratory investigations were used as described previously (17Marsden P.A. Ning Q. Fung L.S. Luo X. Chen Y. Mendicino M. Ghanekar A. Scott J.A.

Twenty two patients with severe CHB, 14 patients with mild chronic viral hepatitis B, and 9 HBsAg carriers were evaluated (Table 2). PBMCs were freshly isolated using Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation from the above-mentioned patients and six health controls and were smeared on slides and kept at −80 °C for further study. PBMCs were evaluated for confocal microscopic study and Western blotting to detect the c-Ets-2 expression as described above.TABLE 2Characteristics of the patientsCharacteristicsHBsAg carrier (n = 9)Mild chronic hepatitis B (n = 14)Severe chronic hepatitis B (n = 22)Age (year)Mean39.240.137.8S.D.14.011.69.7Male sex66.7%64.3%68.1%HBsAg100%100%100%HBeAg0%42.9%36.4%Anti-HBcAg11.1%92.9%90.9%Log HBV DNAPaThe limit of this assay for detecting HBV DNA was approximately 103 copies/mlMean<36.75.9S.D.1.41.6Serum ALT(IU/liter)Mean14.8178.8360.3S.D.5.7139.3315.5Serum bilirubin (μmol/liter)bTo convert values for bilirubin to mg/dl, divide by 17.1Mean13.623.8323.2S.D.4.313.887.6a The limit of this assay for detecting HBV DNA was approximately 103 copies/mlb To convert values for bilirubin to mg/dl, divide by 17.1 Open table in a new tab"
https://openalex.org/W2012961239,"Homologous desensitization of β2-adrenergic and other G-protein-coupled receptors is a two-step process. After phosphorylation of agonist-occupied receptors by G-protein-coupled receptor kinases, they bind β-arrestins, which triggers desensitization and internalization of the receptors. Because it is not known which regions of the receptor are recognized by β-arrestins, we have investigated β-arrestin interaction and internalization of a set of mutants of the human β2-adrenergic receptor. Mutation of the four serine/threonine residues between residues 355 and 364 led to the loss of agonist-induced receptor-β-arrestin2 interaction as revealed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), translocation of β-arrestin2 to the plasma membrane, and receptor internalization. Mutation of all seven serine/threonine residues distal to residue 381 did not affect agonist-induced receptor internalization and β-arrestin2 translocation. A β2-adrenergic receptor truncated distal to residue 381 interacted normally with β-arrestin2, whereas its ability to internalize in an agonist-dependent manner was compromised. A similar impairment of internalization was observed when only the last eight residues of the C terminus were deleted. Our experiments show that the C terminus distal to residue 381 does not affect the initial interaction between receptor and β-arrestin, but its last eight amino acids facilitate receptor internalization in concert with β-arrestin2."
https://openalex.org/W2086182092,"γ-Secretase is an intramembrane cleaving aspartyl protease complex intimately implicated in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis. The protease is composed of the catalytic subunit presenilin (PS1 or PS2), the substrate receptor nicastrin (NCT), and two additional subunits, APH-1 (APH-1a, as long and short splice forms (APH-1aL, APH-1aS), or APH-1b) and PEN-2. Apart from the Alzheimer disease-associated β-amyloid precursor protein, γ-secretase has been shown to cleave a large number of other type I membrane proteins. Despite the progress in elucidating γ-secretase function, basic questions concerning the precise organization of its subunits, their molecular interactions, and their exact stoichiometry in the complex are largely unresolved. Here we isolated endogenous human γ-secretase from human embryonic kidney 293 cells and investigated the subunit architecture of the γ-secretase complex formed by PS1, NCT, APH-1aL, and PEN-2 by chemical cross-linking. Using this approach, we provide evidence for the close neighborhood of the PS1 N- and C-terminal fragments (NTF and CTF, respectively), the PS1 NTF and PEN-2, the PS1 CTF and APH-1aL, and NCT and APH-1aL. We thus identify a previously unrecognized PS1 CTF/APH-1aL interaction, verify subunit interactions deduced previously from indirect approaches, and provide a model of the γ-secretase complex subunit architecture. Finally, we further show that, like the PS1 CTF, the PS2 CTF also interacts with APH-1aL, and we provide evidence that these interactions also occur with the other APH-1 variants, suggesting similar subunit architectures of all γ-secretase complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2161820213,"The signaling functions of dopamine require a finely tuned regulatory network for rapid induction and suppression of output. A key target of regulation is the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis, which is activated by phosphorylation and modulated by the availability of its cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin. The first enzyme in the cofactor synthesis pathway, GTP cyclohydrolase I, is activated by phosphorylation and inhibited by tetrahydrobiopterin. We previously reported that deficits in GTP cyclohydrolase activity in Drosophila heterozygous for mutant alleles of the gene encoding this enzyme led to tightly corresponding diminution of in vivo tyrosine hydroxylase activity that could not be rescued by exogenous cofactor. We also found that the two enzymes could be coimmunoprecipitated from tissue extracts and proposed functional interactions between the enzymes that extended beyond provision of cofactor by one pathway for another. Here, we confirm the physical association of these enzymes, identifying interacting regions in both, and we demonstrate that their association can be regulated by phosphorylation. The functional consequences of the interaction include an increase in GTP cyclohydrolase activity, with concomitant protection from end-product feedback inhibition. In vivo, this effect would in turn provide sufficient cofactor when demand for catecholamine synthesis is greatest. The activity of tyrosine hydroxylase is also increased by this interaction, in excess of the stimulation resulting from phosphorylation alone. Vmax is elevated, with no change in Km. These results demonstrate that these enzymes engage in mutual positive regulation.

The pteridine (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetryhydro-l-biopterin (BH4) 6The abbreviations used are: BH4, (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l-biopterin; GTPCH, GTP cyclohydrolase I; DAHP, 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine; l-DOPA, 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine; GFRP, GTPCH feedback regulatory protein; TH, tyrosine hydroxylase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PBST, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) Tween 20; GST, glutathione S-transferase. is an essential cofactor for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; EC 1.14.16.2) that catalyzes the rate-limiting reaction in the production of catecholamines. Catecholamines function in an array of biological processes that requires sensitive positive and negative regulatory mechanisms, including learning and memory, locomotion, stress management, and aspects of development (1Wise R.A.

The amino acid l-tyrosine is hydroxylated by TH and converted to 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine (l-DOPA), which is subsequently decarboxylated by aromatic-l-amino acid decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.28) to form dopamine, the terminal step in catecholamine synthesis in Drosophila. TH activity depends on the availability of its cofactor, BH4; elevation of dopamine pools requires an increase in BH4 production, which is tightly regulated by the enzymatic activity of GTP cyclohydrolase (GTPCH; EC 3.5.4.16). GTPCH catalyzes the conversion of GTP to 2,4-dihydroneopterin triphosphate, which is reduced and dephosphorylated to the final product, BH4, by 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase and sepiapterin reductase (6Thony B. Auerbach G. Blau N. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Therefore, TH and GTPCH function integrally in catecholamine production. BH4 deficiencies have been associated with BH4-responsive phenylketonuria and dopa-responsive dystonia, a movement disorder that particularly highlights the tight relationship shared between TH and GTPCH, as it is caused by dopamine deficiency linked to dominant mutations in the human GCH1 gene (7Goldstein F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2656-2661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Danks D.M. Cotton R.G. Schlesinger P. Lancet. 1975; 2: 1043Abstract PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 9Segawa M.

Neurol. 1996; 39: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Because TH activity and dopamine production ultimately depend on the enzymatic activity of GTPCH, various studies in mammalian systems have examined the relationships between these two enzymes and their respective biosynthetic pathways. Double immunolabeling experiments carried out in rat brain demonstrated that the majority of catecholaminergic cells express GTPCH (11Dassesse D. Hemmens B. Cuvelier L. Resibois A. Brain Res. 1997; 777: 187-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Moreover, co-localization of TH and GTPCH has been observed in nigrostriatal regions of the mouse and rat brain using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy (12Nagatsu I. Arai R. Sakai M. Takeuchi T. Karasawa N. Nagatsu T. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 224: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13Hirayama K. Kapatos G. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Functional interactions have been revealed in studies of abnormal feeding behaviors in dopamine-deficient mice, which can be fully rescued only when both TH and GTPCH viral gene vectors are co-injected (14Szczypka M. Mandel R. Donahue B. Snyder R. Leff S. Palmiter R. Neuron. 1999; 22: 167-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Likewise, gene therapy studies aimed at replacing dopamine in models for Parkinson disease are most efficient when both GTPCH and TH are co-expressed (15Bencsics C. Wachtel S. Milstien S. Hatakeyama K. Becker J. Kang U. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4449-4456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Mandel R.J. Rendahl K.G. Spratt S.K. Snyder R.O. Cohen L.K. Leff S.E. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4271-4284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Drosophila, GTPCH and TH are encoded by the Punch and pale genes, respectively. Both proteins share a high degree of sequence and structural conservation with their mammalian counterparts (17Neckameyer W.S. Quinn W.C. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1167-1175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 18Maier J. Witter K. Gutlich M. Ziegler I. Werner T. Ninnemann H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Similarly, the function and regulation of these enzymes are conserved (19Vie A. Cigna M. Toci R. Birman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16788-16795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 20Neckameyer W. Holt B. Paradowski T. Biochem.

Chem. 2006; 281: 33302-33312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Studies of TH and GTPCH in terms of localization and function, comparable with those conducted in mammalian model systems, have been carried out in Drosophila. As in mammals, these studies have demonstrated that GTPCH and TH co-localize within Drosophila neurons and that the activity of TH is precisely correlated with the in vivo activity of GTPCH (22Krishnakumar S. Burton D. Rasco J. Chen X. O'Donnell J. J. Neurogenet. 2000; 14: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), whereas coimmunoprecipitation studies suggest that GTPCH and TH from head extracts physically associate (22Krishnakumar S. Burton D. Rasco J. Chen X. O'Donnell J. J. Neurogenet. 2000; 14: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been observed that homozygous Punch mutants exhibit phenotypes similar to those of pale homozygotes (23Mackay W. O'Donnell J.M. Genetics. 1983; 105: 35-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Reynolds E.R. O'Donnell J.M. Dev. Biol. 1987; 123: 430-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), whereas biochemical analyses of heterozygous Punch mutant flies reveal a reduction in the in vivo activity of TH due to reduced levels of the cofactor, BH4 (22Krishnakumar S. Burton D. Rasco J. Chen X. O'Donnell J. J. Neurogenet. 2000; 14: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the introduction of exogenous BH4 fails to restore full TH activity in extracts of the heads of Punch mutants despite the fact that TH protein levels are unaffected by Punch mutations. This result suggests that the presence of GTPCH is necessary for more than the straightforward provision of cofactor (22Krishnakumar S. Burton D. Rasco J. Chen X. O'Donnell J. J. Neurogenet. 2000; 14: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and may depend upon the association of TH and GTPCH. However, the production of the cofactor requires two additional downstream enzymes, whereas dopamine synthesis requires a second enzyme to convert the TH product, l-DOPA, to dopamine. Thus, the functional consequences of the interactions between these two enzymes, which are the rate-limiting components of their respective pathways, are not immediately apparent. Moreover, a complicating feature of GTPCH in Drosophila is that the Punch locus encodes three isoforms of GTPCH, all of which are catalytically active, differing only in their N-terminal domains, which have regulatory functions (25McLean J.R. Krishnakumar S. O'Donnell J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27191-27197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Funderburk C. Bowling K. Xu D. Huang Z. O'Donnell J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33302-33312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Isoform A is located predominantly in the developing adult eye, where it serves to initiate the synthesis of pteridine pigments. Isoforms B and C, which differ only by 16 amino acids, however, are candidates for interactions with TH, as both are expressed in neural tissues. Focusing, therefore, on GTPCH isoforms B and C, we hypothesized that their association with TH would have regulatory ramifications, and to test this idea we have conducted an extensive biochemical analysis of Drosophila GTPCH and TH. Several different interaction assays have confirmed that these enzymes physically associate, and we have mapped domains in each protein that are necessary for the interaction to occur. We demonstrate that the association of TH and GTPCH isoform C is regulated by phosphorylation, and we establish the functional consequences of the interaction. Data provided here for the first time suggest that the physical association between GTPCH and TH leads to an environment that fosters the optimum output of each enzyme by mutually enhancing their respective activities and by blocking end-product feedback inhibition of GTPCH. These findings highlight the existence of a highly responsive and exquisitely tuned mechanism for integrating the two biosynthesis pathways. Construction of GTPCH and TH Expression Vectors—Full-length cDNAs for GTPCH alternative transcripts B and C were obtained as described previously (21Funderburk C. Bowling K. Xu D. Huang Z. O'Donnell J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33302-33312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To amplify the GTPCH cDNAs for insertion into the pET-11a vector (Novagen), the reverse primer (5′-ACACGGATCCTATTTGCTATTGACTAAG-3) was used in conjunction with the following forward primers: transcripts B and C (5′-TCCAGGATCCATGAGCTTCACCCGCCAACT-3′) and common region (5′-ACTTGGATCCGCCACGAGAAGTGCACG-3′). The ensuing cDNAs were inserted into pET-11a at the BamH1 restriction site and introduced into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. Subcloning of the various GTPCH cDNAs into the pQE30 vector (Qiagen) was performed as described previously (21Funderburk C. Bowling K. Xu D. Huang Z. O'Donnell J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33302-33312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For TH, a PCR-generated 1.5-kilobase fragment with NdeI linkers containing the Drosophila TH coding region (17Neckameyer W.S. Quinn W.C. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1167-1175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the NdeI site of pET11a and transformed into BL21/DE3 cells. In other experiments, TH was amplified using primers (5′-ATTAGGATCCATGGCCGTTGCAGCA-3′) and (5′-ATAAAGCTTCTTAGAACGGGCGTCGC-3′), inserted into pQE30, and transformed into XL10 Gold cells. Recombinant molecules were sequence verified by the Auburn University Genomics and Sequencing Lab. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—His6-GTPCH and His6-TH from pQE30 vectors were expressed and purified as described previously with the induction of His6-TH expression being carried out for 30 min only (21Funderburk C. Bowling K. Xu D. Huang Z. O'Donnell J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33302-33312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Bacteria containing pET-GTPCH were grown in LB medium with carbenicillin (50 mg/liter) and chloramphenicol (34 mg/liter) at 37 °C with agitation. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm to induce the expression at 0.6 A600 nm. Two hours after induction, cells were harvested at 7000 × g centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 0.1 culture volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. Cells were frozen at –20 °C and lysed upon thawing. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to the lysate to a final concentration of 0.25 mm, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 11,500 × g for 20 min. The crude extract was partially purified by 35% ammonium sulfate precipitation. The precipitate was dissolved in the above resuspension buffer, and 2 mg of protein was loaded onto a Sephacryl S-300HR gel filtration column for size separation. Protein was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, in 1-ml fractions. Protein composition of each fraction was determined by SDS-PAGE analysis, and each fraction was assayed for GTPCH activity. Fractions containing active GTPCH of the expected size were collected and concentrated by Centricon-100 filters (Millipore), and the final protein concentration was measured by the Bradford protein microassay (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Reagent with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Purification of TH from pET-TH containing cells was performed as for GTPCH, except that cells were resuspended, and protein was isolated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and fractions containing TH were identified by TH activity assays. GTPCH Activity Assay—GTPCH activity was assayed in the presence and absence of varying concentrations of TH via microplate spectrometry as described previously (21Funderburk C. Bowling K. Xu D.

Chem. 2004; 279: 40677-40682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). TH Activity Assay—A 90-μl reaction mixture containing 25 μg (1 μm) of TH protein and varying concentrations of GTPCH and 1% catalase (Sigma) in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 8.0) was preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min. Assays were started by adding 5 μl of BH4 (Sigma) of varying concentrations and 5 μl of 2 mm l-tyrosine (200 μm final concentration; Sigma) and stopped after 20 min of incubation at 37 °C with the addition of 100 μl of stop buffer (0.1 m perchloric acid, 0.4 mm sodium metabisulfite, 0.1 mm EDTA). After 10 min of incubation on ice, assay mixtures were centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g at 4 °C. l-DOPA concentration in the supernatant was determined by HPLC separation and electrochemical detection. Chromatographic separations were performed on an ESA CoulArray (Model 5600A) HPLC instrument. The mobile phase contained 75 mm sodium phosphate adjusted to pH 3.0 with phosphoric acid, 0.75 mm octanesulfonic acid, 25 μm EDTA, 100 μl/liter triethylamine, 2.25% acetonitrile. Separations were performed on a Waters Symmetry 4.6 × 15-cm 5-μl C18 column preconditioned with 500 ml buffer before use and run with an isocratic flow of 1 ml/min. Detection of l-DOPA was performed using an ESA analytical electrochemical cell (model 5011) at –50 mV for channel 1 and 300 mV for channel 2. Commercial l-DOPA (Sigma) was used as the standard. Western Blot Analyses—Proteins (20 μg) were separated on 10 or 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline Tween 20 (PBST; 1 × PBS; 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) before incubation with primary antibodies. GTPCH was detected using either affinity-purified polyclonal anti-GTPCH isoform B/C or anti-GTPCH isoform C (28Chen X. Reynolds E.R. Ranganayakulu G. O'Donnell J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3501-3513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 1:5000 dilutions. TH was detected using anti-TH antibody (rabbit anti-rat polyclonal TH (Pelfreez) or rabbit anti-Drosophila TH (29Neckameyer W. Woodrome S. Holt B. Mayer A. Neurobiol. Aging. 2000; 21: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)) used at dilutions of 1:1000. Secondary antibody, peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunological), was used at a dilution of 1:5000. Signals were detected using Renaissance chemiluminescence kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunoprecipitation—Protein A-Sepharose beads (100 μl; Sigma) were cross-linked to 5 μl of polyclonal anti-GTPCH or anti-TH antibody in 100 μl of PBS, pH 7.5, with dimethylpimelimidate (30Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 323Google Scholar). A mixture of 50 μg of recombinant TH and 50 μg of recombinant GTPCH was incubated with 50 μl of cross-linked beads at 4 °C overnight. After extensive washing in 1 × PBS, 3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5% sucrose, pH 7.5, the beads were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and 20 μl of SDS gel-loading buffer was added. The beads were boiled for 10 min followed by 5 min of centrifugation at 1000 × g. The supernatant was loaded on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and subjected to Western blotting. A lacZ-pET11a construct in the host E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS was used as a control where recombinant β-galactosidase (50 μg) was mixed with 50 μg of TH and protein A-Sepharose beads cross-linked to polyclonal anti-β-galactosidase antibody (Sigma). For immunoprecipitation of proteins from crude Drosophila extracts, ∼500 heads from wild type (Oregon R) adults 24–48 h post-eclosion were collected on dry ice. Head tissue was homogenized in 550 μl of PBS, pH 7.5. After 10,000 × g centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C, protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Reagent. Approximately 200 μg of protein was incubated with 50 μl of cross-linked beads overnight at 4 °C in 1 × PBS, 3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5% sucrose, pH 7.5. The bead extract mixture was treated as described above for recombinant proteins. Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Pulldown—GTPCH isoform B and isoform C cDNAs were amplified using primers 5′-TAATGGATCCCCATGAGCTTCACCCGC-3′ and 5′-ACACGAATTCTATTTGCTATTGACTAAG-3′ and inserted into pGEX-3x (Amersham Biosciences) for expression of GST-GTPCH. Constructs were sequence-verified and transformed into DH5α cells. GST-GTPCH (0.4 nm) and His6-TH (0.4 nm) were mixed with 100 μl of 50/50 glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences)/PBS slurry and rotated at 4 °C for 2 h. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation for 30 s at 11,500 × g. After washing with ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 8.0, bound proteins were eluted with 50 μl of 20 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 30 min at 4 °C. Eluted protein (10 μl) was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was conducted, probing with anti-GST (1:5000 dilution; Sigma) and anti-His6 antibodies (1:5000; Sigma). Far-Western—Conditions were modified from methods described previously (31Golemis E. Protein-Protein Interactions: A Molecular Cloning Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2002: 37-53Google Scholar). Samples were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes at 100 V for 60 min. After washing for 10 min in PBST, the membrane was placed into 50 ml of denaturation buffer (6 m guanidinium hydrochloride) at 4 °C for 10 min. Denaturation buffer (25 ml) was removed, and 25 ml of PBS was added for a total volume of 50 ml. The membrane was incubated in the diluted denaturation buffer for 10 min at 4 °C. This dilution and wash cycle was repeated four times. The membrane was then washed with PBST for 10 min at 4 °C. The membrane was blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk for either 4 h at 4 °C or 2 h at room temperature. The membrane was rinsed in PBST and moved to TH bait mixture (20 μm bait protein in 10 ml of PBST) for 4–5 h at 4 °C or 2 h at room temperature. The membrane was then washed thoroughly in PBST. Anti-TH antibody (1:1000) in PBST was added and incubated at room temperature for 3 h. The membrane was washed three times in PBST at room temperature. Secondary antibody (1:10,000) was applied and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed 3 times at room temperature for a total of 1 h. Peroxide solution (5 ml) and luminol solution (5 ml; Pierce) were added to the membrane. The x-ray film was exposed and developed following standard methods. In Vitro Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation of GTPCH and TH—Phosphorylation reaction conditions for recombinant GTPCH and TH used in coimmunoprecipitation experiments were modified from Le Bourdelles et al. (32Le Bourdelles B. Horellou P. Le Caer J.P. Denefle P. Latta M. Haavik J. Guibert B. Mayaux J.F. Mallet J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17124-17130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For GTPCH phosphorylation by protein kinase C, 50 μg of purified recombinant GTPCH in 30 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, was brought to 10 mm MgCl2 and mixed with 2 μl of 10 mm ATP and 2 μl (0.04 units) of rat brain protein kinase C catalytic subunit (Calbiochem). The reaction was performed at 30 °C for 30 min. Dephosphorylation was performed by adding 23.5 units of alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) to phosphorylated GTPCH and incubating the mixture for 1 h at 37 °C. For GTPCH and TH phosphorylation by protein kinase A, 20 μg of protein was suspended in 20 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm Tris, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 μm ATP, 0.5 μl (1.25 kilounits) of PKA) and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. GTPCH phosphorylation reactions were stopped by adding 20 μl of 2 × Coomassie Blue loading buffer and boiling for 5 min. TH phosphorylation reactions were stopped with the addition of 10 ml of ice-cold PBST. To verify phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE to detect mobility shifts. Nonphosphorylation controls were processed without protein kinase A. Recombinant GTPCH and TH used in enzyme activity assays were phosphorylated as described by Funderburk et al. (21Funderburk C. Bowling K. Xu D. Huang Z. O'Donnell J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33302-33312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) except that proteins were eluted from nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin columns with 500 μl of elution buffer. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—Yeast strain PJ69-4A (MATa trp 1-901 leu2-3, 112 ura3-52 his3-200 gal 4Δ gal80 LYS2:GAL1-HIS3 GAL2-ADE2 met:GAL7-lacZ) and AH109 (MATa trp 1-901 leu2-3, 112 ura3-52 his3-200 gal4Δ gal80 LYS2: GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-HIS3, Mel1 GAL2UAS-GAL2TATA-ADE2 URA3:MEL1UAS-MEL1TATA-lacZ) competent yeast cells (Clontech) were utilized for the yeast two-hybrid assay. Yeast extract, peptone, and dextrose (YPD) media and synthetic dropout (SD) media were prepared using standard methods. GTPCH cDNA segments were subcloned into the activation domain vector pGAD-C1 containing LEU2 or the DNA-binding domain vector pGBD-C1, which contains TRP1. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing and transformed into yeast cells to verify the inability to activate reporter gene expression in the absence of an interacting partner. PJ69-4A and AH109 were transformed with 0.1 μg of DNA or co-transformed with 0.2 μg total DNA. Transformants were grown on SD–Leu/–Trp media at 30 °C for 3–5 days until colonies were 2–3 mm in diameter. SD–Leu/–Trp colonies were replicated on SD–Leu/–Trp/–His media to test reporter gene expression. β-Galactosidase reporter gene expression was tested in positive colonies by standard colony-lift activity assay methods. Tyrosine Hydroxylase and GTP Cyclohydrolase I Physically Associate in Vitro and in Yeast Cells—Previous studies found that TH could be coimmunoprecipitated with GTPCH from extracts of adult heads using a polyclonal anti-Drosophila GTPCH antibody that was generated against isoform B and detects both isoforms B and C (22Krishnakumar S. Burton D. Rasco J. Chen X. O'Donnell J. J. Neurogenet. 2000; 14: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To confirm this interaction and to ascertain whether the interaction between the two enzymes was direct or mediated through additional proteins, we performed a GST pull-down assay employing purified His-tagged TH and GST-GTPCH B and C fusion proteins. We observed that both GTPCH isoforms were able to physically and directly interact with TH (Fig. 1, A and B). We confirmed the ability of these proteins to interact directly in a far-Western assay (Fig. 1, C and D). Yeast two-hybrid interaction assays were conducted employing full-length and truncated TH and GTPCH to determine which regions of these proteins participate in this interaction (Fig. 2). As expected from the results of the previously described interaction assays, full-length isoforms B and C of GTPCH interacted with full-length TH in the yeast assay (Fig. 2a). Interaction data for isoforms B and C were identical; only the interaction results for GTPCH isoform B are summarized in Fig. 2. The first 100 amino acids of GTPCH isoform B are encoded by a single exon. We have previously shown that this domain serves to regulate the activity of the highly conserved catalytic domain, amino acids 101–308, which we also refer to as the “common region,” as this sequence is shared by all GTPCH isoforms (21Funderburk C. Bowling K. Xu D. Huang Z. O'Donnell J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33302-33312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We, therefore, assessed whether the “catalytic” domain alone possessed the capacity to interact with full-length TH and found that this N-terminal truncated protein retained an ability to interact, as did the N-terminal 100 amino acids alone (Fig. 2, b and d). We conclude from this result that GTPCH likely has several contact points within both the N-terminal and the common region. The dark bars in the diagram of GTPCH in Fig. 2 represent six predicted α-helical regions that have the potential of mediating physical interactions of the protein. Further truncation of the catalytic domain, including helix 1 but stopping short of helix 2, obliterated the ability of the enzyme to interact with TH (Fig. 2c). An analysis of the TH protein was then conducted by dividing it roughly into halves, with the N-terminal polypeptide extending from amino acids 1 to 269 and the C-terminal half, which contains the catalytic and multimerization domains, extending from amino acids 270 to 508. The N-terminal half of TH retained the capacity to interact with full-length and catalytic domain fragments of GTPCH as long as the predi"

Polymerase δ displaces the primer into a flap for processing. Dna2 nuclease/helicase and flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) are proposed to cleave the flap. The single-stranded DNA-binding protein, replication protein A (RPA), governs cleavage activity. Flap-bound RPA inhibits FEN1. This necessitates cleavage by Dna2, which is stimulated by RPA. FEN1 then cuts the remaining RPA-free flap to create a nick for ligation. Cleavage by Dna2 requires that it enter the 5′-end and track down the flap. Because Dna2 cleaves the RPA-bound flap, we investigated the mechanism by which Dna2 accesses the protein-coated flap for cleavage. Using a nuclease-defective Dna2 mutant, we showed that just binding of Dna2 dissociates the flap-bound RPA. Facile dissociation is specific to substrates with a genuine flap, and will not occur with an RPA-coated single strand. We also compared the cleavage patterns of Dna2 with and without RPA to better define RPA stimulation of Dna2. Stimulation derived from removal of DNA folding in the flap. Apparently, coordinated with its dissociation, RPA relinquishes the flap to Dna2 for tracking in a way that does not allow flap structure to reform. We also found that RPA strand melting activity promotes excessive flap elongation, but it is suppressed by Dna2-promoted RPA dissociation. Overall, results indicate that Dna2 and RPA coordinate their functions for efficient flap cleavage and preparation for FEN1.

Eukaryotic DNA replication involves synthesis of a leading strand in the direction of parental DNA unwinding, and because of the anti-parallel structure of DNA, a lagging strand in the opposite direction of unwinding. Although leading strand synthesis occurs continuously, the lagging strand must be synthesized in a discontinuous fashion. Lagging strand synthesis is initiated by the polymerase (pol) 3The abbreviations used are: pol, polymerase; FEN1, flap endonuclease 1; RPA, replication protein A; hRPA, human RPA; nt, nucleotide; ss, single-stranded. 3The abbreviations used are: pol, polymerase; FEN1, flap endonuclease 1; RPA, replication protein A; hRPA, human RPA; nt, nucleotide; ss, single-stranded. α-primase complex, which synthesizes 8–12 nucleotides (nt) of RNA followed by ∼20-nt of DNA (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman, New York1992: 140-144Google Scholar, 2Rossi M.L. Purohit V. Brandt P.D. Bambara R.A. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 453-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The pol α-primase complex is then replaced by a complex of the toroidal sliding clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen and pol δ, which is loaded onto the DNA by the clamp loader replication factor C. This complex synthesizes another 100–150 nt of DNA before the primer terminus encounters the previously synthesized downstream segment. These segments, known as Okazaki fragments, must then be processed to create a continuous strand of DNA. Because pol α does not possess proofreading activity and synthesizes with relatively low fidelity compared with pol δ, it is proposed that the entire RNA/DNA primer, laid down by pol α, is removed to maintain genome integrity (3Shevelev I.V. Hubscher U. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 364-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Processing of the RNA/DNA primer is initiated when strand displacement synthesis, by pol δ, raises the primer into a single-stranded (ss) flap intermediate (4Ayyagari R. Gomes X.V. Gordenin D.A.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8869-8875Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Removal of this flap intermediate followed by fragment joining is known as Okazaki fragment processing. Several modes of Okazaki fragment processing have been proposed to occur in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, based on biochemical and genetic data. One involves complete flap removal by flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) (4Ayyagari R. Gomes X.V. Gordenin D.A. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1618-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 7Jin Y.H. Ayyagari R. Resnick M.A. Gordenin D.A. Burgers P.M. J. Biol.

FEN1 is a structure-specific nuclease that cleaves at the base of 5′ flap intermediates to create a nick (8Liu Y. Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 589-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In this mode, pol δ displaces the RNA/DNA primer into short flap intermediates. These flaps are efficiently cleaved by FEN1. The resultant nicked product is then ligated by DNA ligase I. In another proposed mode, cleavage by the nuclease/helicase Dna2 precedes FEN1 cleavage to create a nicked product (9Bae S.H. Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature. 2001; 412: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 10Bae S.H. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38022-38031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). When flaps reach a length of 20–30-nt, they are stably bound by replication protein A (RPA) (11Arunkumar A.I. Stauffer M.E. Bochkareva E. Bochkarev A. Chazin W.J. J. Biol.

RPA binding prevents cleavage by FEN1 while stimulating Dna2 cleavage, necessitating initial flap cleavage by Dna2 (9Bae S.H. Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature. 2001; 412: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Dna2, unlike FEN1, cannot create a nick product for ligation. Instead, it leaves a short, ∼5-nt flap devoid of RPA. FEN1 can then cleave this short flap, creating a nick for ligation by DNA ligase I. Recent work from our group suggests that both pathways are employed during flap processing (14Rossi M.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26051-26061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). By reconstructing Okazaki fragment processing in vitro, we recently demonstrated that pol δ displaces mostly short flaps (<10-nt), which are readily cleaved by FEN1. In addition to the short flaps, a minor subset of longer flaps (10–30-nt) arises, which can be bound by RPA, requiring the Dna2/FEN1 pathway. These results suggest that the two pathways work in parallel to resolve Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. S. cerevisiae Dna2 was identified during a screen for mutants defective in DNA replication (15Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 16Kuo C. Nuang H. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6465-6469Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It is an essential protein possessing both ssDNA endonuclease activity and 5′ to 3′ ATP-dependent helicase activity (15Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 17Bae S.H. Choi E. Lee K.H. Park J.S. Lee S.H. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26880-26890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In addition, it physically and genetically interacts with FEN1, further implicating it in lagging strand replication (18Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2136-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Recently, Dna2 was shown to possess strand annealing and strand exchange activities, which may aid in the formation of a 5′ flap intermediate during flap equilibration (19Masuda-Sasa T. Polaczek P. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38555-38564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Dna2 has subsequently been shown to interact with other proteins involved in DNA replication, including Pol32, RNase H2, Sgs1, and Exo1 (20Budd M.E. Tong A.H. Polaczek P. Peng X. Boone C. Campbell J.L. PLoS Genet. 2005; 1: e61Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RPA was found to interact with Dna2 to stimulate both its nuclease and helicase activities, and the overexpression of RPA overcame the temperature-sensitive growth of several Dna2 mutant alleles (9Bae S.H. Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature. 2001; 412: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 21Bae S.H. Kim D.W. Kim J. Kim J.H. Kim D.H. Kim H.D. Kang H.Y. Seo Y.S. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3006-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae RPA is a heterotrimeric protein consisting of subunits Rpa1–3, each of which is essential in yeast (23Brill S.J. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1589-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 24Heyer W.D. Rao M.R. Erdile L.F. Kelly T.J. Kolodner R.D.

Chem. 2008; 283: 19095-19111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In humans, RPA is also necessary for the reconstitution of SV40 DNA replication (26Wold M.S. Kelly T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2523-2527Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Its primary role is to stabilize ssDNA, preventing it from re-annealing or forming secondary structure during DNA replication, repair, and recombination (27Fanning E. Klimovich V. Nager A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4126-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 28Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar, 29Iftode C. Daniely Y. Borowiec J.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 34: 141-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Dna2 was shown to interact specifically with Rpa1, the large subunit of RPA (22Bae K.H. Kim H.S. Bae S.H. Kang H.Y. Brill S. Seo Y.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3006-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Contacts between the two proteins were found to occur at both the N- and C-terminal domains of both Dna2 and Rpa1. Additionally, wild type Dna2 and RPA were shown to form a complex on a DNA flap substrate (9Bae S.H. Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature. 2001; 412: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). We previously reported that to exhibit nuclease activity, Dna2 must enter the free 5′-end of a flap, and then track down the flap toward the base for cleavage (30Kao H.I. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50840-50849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the tracking requirement of Dna2 necessitates that it encounter bound RPA molecules as it moves for successive cleavages. Because Dna2 is stimulated for cleavage on flaps coated by RPA, we were prompted to ask why the presence of RPA does not interfere with the tracking motion of Dna2. This question is particularly interesting because Dna2 cleavage is inhibited on flaps coated by other ssDNA-binding proteins (Escherichia coli single-stranded binding protein and human RPA) (9Bae S.H. Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature. 2001; 412: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 31Kim D.H. Lee K.H. Kim J.H. Ryu G.H. Bae S.H. Lee B.C. Moon K.Y. Byun S.M. Koo H.S. Seo Y.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1372-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the current study, we explored the mechanism by which Dna2 cleaves on RPA-coated flaps, and the manner by which RPA stimulates Dna2 cleavage activity. Materials—Synthetic oligonucleotides, including the 5′-biotin and 3′-biotin conjugations, were produced by Integrated DNA Technologies. Radionucleotides [α-32P]dCTP and [γ-32P]ATP were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I, polynucleotide kinase, streptavidin, and ATP were from Roche Applied Science. All other reagents were the best available commercial grade. Enzyme Expression and Purification—S. cerevisiae Dna2 was cloned into the Sf9 baculovirus expression vector (Invitrogen). S. cerevisiae Dna2 E675A was created by site-directed mutagenesis as described (32Budd M.E. Choe W. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16518-16529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Both Dna2 wild type and E675A were then expressed and purified as described (32Budd M.E. Choe W. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16518-16529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), except that High Five cells were utilized. S. cerevisiae RPA (33Sibenaller Z.A. Sorensen B.R. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12496-12506Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and human RPA (13Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were overexpressed and purified as previously described. Oligonucleotides—Substrate primer sequences are listed in Table 1. Downstream primers were labeled at either the 3′ terminus or the 5′ terminus with [32P], as indicated in the figures. [α-32P]dCTP was incorporated into the 3′ terminus by the Klenow enzyme and [γ-32P]ATP was incorporated at the 5′ terminus using polynucleotide kinase. After labeling, substrates were purified as described previously (34Stewart J.A. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38565-38572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). DNA flap substrates were then annealed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and in a 1:2:4 ratio of downstream to template to upstream primer. The ΔG calculations for the flap structure were done by entering the unannealed portion of the primer sequence into mfold, for analysis under reaction conditions (35Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M.

Open table in a new tab Gel Shift Assay—The reaction volume was 20 μl, which contained 5 fmol of labeled substrate and various amounts of protein, as indicated. The reaction buffer consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5% glycerol, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP, unless otherwise stated. RPA was pre-bound for 5 min at room temperature followed by addition of Dna2 E675A for 5 min at room temperature. In Figs. 3 and 4, the streptavidin was preincubated with the substrate for 10 min at 37 °C. For measurement of the dissociation constants in Table 2, the substrate concentration was lowered to 1 fmol (50 pm). All reactions were then loaded on pre-run 5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE (Invitrogen). Gels were then subjected to electrophoresis at 150 V for 30–45 min.FIGURE 4ssDNA alters Dna2 dissociation of RPA. Gel shift analysis was performed with 100 fmol of RPA, 5 fmol of the 50-nt ssDNA substrate (D3), and increasing amounts of Dna2 E675A (50, 100, 200, and 500 fmol). In lanes 8–14, the substrate was incubated with streptavidin (250 fmol) prior to pre-binding with RPA as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” Dna2 was then added into the reaction (lanes 3–6 and 10–13).

The reactions were stopped by addition of 2× termination dye, consisting of 90% formamide (v/v), 10 mm EDTA, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 0.01% xylene cyanol. A 15% polyacrylamide gel, containing 7 m urea, was then used to separate the reactions. Strand Melting Assay—RPA strand melting was measured using native gel electrophoresis. The reaction buffer consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5% glycerol with or without 1 mm ATP and 2 mm MgCl2, as indicated in the figure legends. Substrates (5 fmol) were incubated with various amounts of RPA at 37 °C for 15 min. Reactions were then stopped by addition of a 6 × helicase dye, containing 30% glycerol, 50 mm EDTA, 0.9% SDS, 0.25% bromphenol blue, and 0.25% xylene cyanole. Reactions were then loaded onto 5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE (Invitrogen). Gels were then subjected to electrophoresis at 150 V for 30 min. Gel Analysis—Experiments were done in at least duplicate and representative gels are shown. After running conditions, gels were transferred to filter paper (Whatman) and dried on a gel dryer (Bio-Rad) with vacuum (Savant). Gels were then exposed to a phosphorscreen and analyzed by phosphorimaging (GE Healthcare). Analysis of the image was then performed using ImageQuantMac, version 1.2. Calculation of Dissociation Constants—After gel shift analysis, curves were fit using nonlinear least squares regression of the hyperbolic equation, y=Bmax×[protein]/(Kd+[protein])where y is the percent of oligonucleotide bound, [Protein] is the concentration of protein in nm, Bmax is the maximum binding, and Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant. Dna2 Removes Flap-bound RPA—Because Dna2 is necessary to cleave flaps bound by RPA, we planned to determine the mechanism by which Dna2 gains access to the flap. Previously, it had been proposed that RPA dissociates as a consequence of flap cleavage by Dna2 (9Bae S.H. Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature. 2001; 412: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). However, another possibility is that Dna2 dissociates RPA from the flap to gain access to binding sites for tracking and cleavage. To distinguish these hypotheses, we tested the ability of the nuclease-defective mutant Dna2 E675A to dissociate RPA. This mutant Dna2 would allow us to establish whether RPA dissociation depends on cleavage. Reactions employed a double flap substrate with a 53-nt flap. RPA was pre-bound to the substrate prior to the addition of Dna2 E675A (see “Experimental Procedures”). Pre-binding of RPA allowed us to observe the subsequent effects of Dna2 addition on flap-bound RPA. Saturating amounts of RPA were pre-bound to the flap so that we could assess Dna2 binding to RPA-bound flaps, without having to simultaneously interpret results of Dna2 binding to naked flaps. Gel shift analysis was then carried out to determine whether Dna2 and/or RPA were bound to the labeled flap substrate (Fig. 1). We previously demonstrated that although the Dna2 E675A mutant is devoid of nuclease activity, it retains both substrate binding and helicase activities (34Stewart J.A. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38565-38572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These properties of the Dna2 E675A allowed us to also assess the effects of helicase function on Dna2 binding to the RPA-coated substrate. To accomplish this assessment, binding reactions were carried out in the presence or absence of ATP, which is required for Dna2 helicase function. With RPA alone (Fig. 1), the major band in lanes 2 and 9 corresponds to the binding of two RPA molecules to the 53-nt flap, with the minor band corresponding to one RPA molecule. This interpretation is consistent with the banding pattern changes seen in an RPA concentration titration on the same substrate, which showed binding of one RPA and then two (data not shown). Dna2 was then titrated into the reaction. As the amount of Dna2 increased, we observed a shift from an RPA-bound band to a Dna2-bound band (Fig. 1, lanes 3–6 and 10–13). Similar results were observed on 37- and 30-nt flap substrates (data not shown). These results are consistent with the idea that Dna2 removes RPA from the flap in a cleavage independent manner, allowing Dna2 access to the flap for cleavage. However, the results do not exclude the possibility that Dna2 cleavage activity aids in further destabilizing RPA binding to the flap. Interestingly, the addition of ATP did not significantly alter the shift to the Dna2-bound flap (Fig. 1, compare lanes 3–6 and 10–13). However, we observed a minor accumulation of a super-shifted product, in the presence of both Dna2 and RPA (lane 6). This product likely represents an intermediate in which both Dna2 and RPA are bound to the flap substrate. Because ATP is thought to aid Dna2 tracking on the flap (30Kao H.I. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50840-50849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the absence of ATP might slow RPA removal because tracking is impaired. RPA Binds Flaps with a Higher Affinity Than That of Dna2—To assure that Dna2 replacement of RPA (Fig. 1) was derived from an active dissociation process and was not based on a simple difference between binding affinities, we compared the dissociation constants of RPA and Dna2 (Table 2). Increasing amounts of Dna2 or RPA were bound to a fixed amount of the labeled 53-nt flap substrate. Gel shift analysis was then performed to assess binding. The data were then fit by nonlinear least squares regression to determine relative binding affinities (Table 2). The substrate concentration was lowered to assure equilibrium binding (see “Experimental Procedures”). The dissociation constant for RPA binding to a 50-nt segment of ssDNA was previously measured to be ∼0.15 nm (37Kim C. Paulus B.F. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14197-14206Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Here, we measured the dissociation constant of RPA binding to the 53-nt flap substrate to be 0.35 nm. Both wild type Dna2 and Dna2 E675A were tested and found to have dissociation constants of 5.5 and 3.4 nm, respectively (Table 2). When compared with RPA binding, Dna2 bound with an ∼10-fold lower relative binding affinity. In our binding titration in Fig. 1, the concentration of Dna2 never exceeded 5 times the concentration of RPA. Nevertheless, Dna2 displaced virtually all of the RPA. These observations suggest that, based on binding affinities, Dna2 would not have out-competed RPA for binding. Instead, it must have interacted with RPA in a specific manner to dissociate the higher affinity RPA. Removal of RPA Is Species-specific—Previously, Kim et al. (9Bae S.H. Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature. 2001; 412: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 31Kim D.H. Lee K.H. Kim J.H. Ryu G.H. Bae S.H. Lee B.C. Moon K.Y. Byun S.M. Koo H.S. Seo Y.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1372-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) demonstrated that stimulation of Dna2 by RPA is species-specific; for example, human RPA (hRPA) inhibits instead of stimulates S. cerevisiae Dna2 cleavage activity. Using the 53-nt flap, we also saw inhibition of yeast Dna2 cleavage activity by hRPA (Fig. 2A). Because Dna2 dissociates RPA (Fig. 1), we tested whether dissociation is also species-specific (Fig. 2B). Yeast RPA (lanes 2–4) and hRPA (lanes 6–8) were pre-bound to the flap. When progressively greater amounts of yeast Dna2 were then incubated with the hRPA-bound flaps the quantity of bound hRPA was unaltered (lanes 6–8). The inability of yeast Dna2 to remove hRPA from the flap might explain why single-stranded binding proteins from other species inhibit Dna2 cleavage. If the binding proteins block either the motion or catalytic activity of Dna2 then cleavage would be prevented. These data further suggest a specific protein-protein interaction between Dna2 and RPA, which is required for RPA removal followed by Dna2 cleavage. Dna2 Tracking Is Not Required for RPA Removal—Dna2 employs a tracking mechanism to cleave on flap substrates. If the 5′-end of the flap is blocked by a double-stranded region or a streptavidin-biotin conjugate then cleavage is inhibited (30Kao H.I. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50840-50849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Significantly, a block to tracking inhibits cleavage by Dna2, but not Dna2 binding. Previously, we showed that Dna2 bound a flap substrate blocked at the 5′-end by a streptavidin-biotin conjugate (34Stewart J.A. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38565-38572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because Dna2 can bind the flap without tracking, we asked whether it could still remove RPA when the 5′-end of the flap was blocked (Fig. 3). Streptavidin was preincubated with a flap containing a biotin attached to the 5′-end. RPA was added into the reaction and allowed to bind the blocked substrate. Increasing amounts of Dna2 were then added into the reaction. Surprisingly, Dna2 was still able to remove the flap-bound RPA even when tracking was blocked (Fig. 3, lanes 4–6). The ability of Dna2 to remove RPA on substrates blocked at the 5′-end is an additional confirmation that cleavage is not required for the dissociation of RPA. RPA/Dna2 Interaction Differs on ssDNA—To further analyze the mechanism of RPA removal, we evaluated the effect of Dna2 on RPA bound to a single-stranded segment of DNA (Fig. 4). Use of ssDNA allowed us to determine whether structural features of the flap are required for RPA dissociation. A biotin was attached to the 3′-end of the ssDNA, because blocking the end may prevent Dna2 from tracking off the DNA. The 50-nt sequence used was the"

Hypoxanthine is the key precursor for purine metabolism in Plasmodium. Inhibition of hypoxanthine-forming reactions in both erythrocytes and parasites is lethal to cultured P. falciparum. We observed that high concentrations of adenosine can rescue cultured parasites from purine nucleoside phosphorylase and adenosine deaminase blockade but not when erythrocyte adenosine kinase is also inhibited. P. falciparum lacks adenosine kinase but can salvage AMP synthesized in the erythrocyte cytoplasm to provide purines when both human and Plasmodium purine nucleoside phosphorylases and adenosine deaminases are inhibited. Transport studies in Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing the P. falciparum nucleoside transporter PfNT1 established that this transporter does not transport AMP. These metabolic patterns establish the existence of a novel nucleoside monophosphate transport pathway in P. falciparum."

Recently, we generated NAG-1 transgenic mice (Cre/NAG-1Tg/Lox), which express human NAG-1 in all tissues (15Baek S.J. Okazaki R. Lee S.H. Martinez J. Kim J.S. Yamaguchi K. Mishina Y. Martin D.W.

The anti-tumorigenic activity of the Cre/NAG-1Tg/Lox mice was evaluated with a known colon carcinogen, azoxymethane. Cre/NAG-1Tg/Lox mice had smaller numbers of pre-neoplastic polyps in their colon compared with littermate controls. Furthermore, ApcMin/+ mice mated to the Cre/NAG-1Tg/Lox mice showed a 42% reduction in small intestine polyp numbers and a 40% reduction in tumor load (15Baek S.J. Okazaki R. Lee S.H. Martinez J.

These findings suggest that NAG-1 plays a role in the development of intestinal polyps in mice and colorectal cancer in humans. These data and other findings reported in the literature suggest that NAG-1 may act as a tumor suppressor, but the association between NAG-1 and brain tumor development has been poorly investigated. The promoter of NAG-1 has several CpG islands, but no investigation has been done to epigenetically silence the protein by methylation or histone modification. Histone acetylation plays a key role in transcriptional activation, whereas deacetylation of histones correlates with transcriptional repression and silencing of genes involved in cell-cycle regulation, differentiation, and development, as well as human cancer (16Grunstein M.

HDAC inhibitors are being investigated as potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of glioblastoma. We suspected that HDAC inhibitors may alter NAG-1 expression because the transcription factor Sp-1 has been shown to interact with HDAC1 (28Doetzlhofer A. Rotheneder H. Lagger G. Koranda M. Kurtev V. Brosch G. Wintersberger E. Seiser C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5504-5511Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) and NAG-1 expression is regulated by p53, Egr-1, and Sp-1 (29Eling T.E. Baek S.J.

However, whether histone acetylation modification is involved in NAG-1 transcriptional regulation has not been elucidated. The goal of the present study was to determine whether NAG-1 expression in glioblastoma cells is altered by HDAC inhibitors. Cell Culture and Reagents—The glioblastoma multiform cell lines T98G, U118MG, U138MG, U373, U87MG, and A172, glioma cell line Hs683, and low grade astrocytoma cell line SW1088 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The NHA cell line was obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). All glioblastoma cells and Hs683 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing 4.5 g/liter d-glucose and l-glutamine (Invitrogen) and supplemented with 1 mm minimal essential medium sodium pyruvate solution (Invitrogen), 10 μg/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. The SW1088 and NHA cells were maintained in AGM BulletKit (Lonza, Walkersville, MD). TSA and 5-aza-dC were purchased from Sigma and were dissolved in 0.1% Me2SO (DMSO). Sodium butyrate was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline. Cycloheximide was purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI) and dissolved in 0.1% Me2SO. DMSO was used as a control treatment in all experiments. Antibodies were from the following sources: anti-Egr-1 (4152), anti-β-actin (4967), anti-cleaved PARP (9541), anti-PARP (9542), and anti-phosphorylated-ERK1/2 (9101) were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); anti-Sp-1 (sc-59), anti-Egr-1 (sc-110), and anti-ERK1 (sc-93) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-COX-1 and anti-COX-2 were from Cayman Chemical Co.; anti-acetyl-histone H3 (catalog number 06-599) and anti-acetyl-histone H4 (catalog number 06-866) were from Upstate Biotechnology (VA). The NAG-1 polyclonal rabbit antibody was generated in this laboratory. Western Blot Analysis—Total cell lysates were isolated in RIPA buffer with Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture tablets from Roche (Indianapolis, IN), sonicated briefly, and quantitated by BCA assay (Pierce). Forty micrograms of total protein per lane were separated by SDS-PAGE 4–12% BisTris gel (Invitrogen) and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen). The blots were blocked for 1 h in 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) (Sigma) and probed overnight at 4 °C in 5% skim milk in TBS-T with each primary antibody. After washing with TBS-T, the blots were incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature in 3% skim milk in TBS-T, washed several times in TBS-T, and detected by the Amersham Biosciences ECL plus Western blot detection system (GE Healthcare). Isolation and Reverse Transcription—Total RNAs were isolated with the RNeasy MINI kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 1 μg of RNA was treated with 1 unit of DNase I Amplification Grade (Invitrogen) at room temperature for 15 min to remove genomic DNA and followed by inactivation by DNase I with 2.5 mm EDTA (Invitrogen) at 65 °C for 5 min. Reverse transcription (RT) was performed with SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cDNA was stored at –20 °C until use. Real-time RT-PCR—Real-time RT-PCR assays were performed using ABI Prism 7700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Real-time RT-PCR fluorescence detection was performed in 96-well plates with Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Amplification primers were 5′-TGCCCGCCAGCTACAATC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCTTTGGCTAACAAGTCATCATAGGT-3′ (reverse) for the NAG-1 gene; and 5′-AGCCCTACGAGCACCTGAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGTTTGGCTGGGGTAACTG-3′ (reverse) for the Egr-1 gene; and 5′-CCTGGCACCCAGCACAAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCGGATCCACACGGAGTACT-3′ (reverse) for β-actin. The threshold cycle number (CT) for each sample was determined in triplicate. The CT value for NAG-1 and Egr-1 were normalized against β-actin, which was expressed as CT = (CTNAG-1 or Egr-1 – CTActin). The CT values were converted by using the 2–ΔΔCT method. All the results represent mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. Constructions of Plasmids—Several NAG-1 promoter clones linked to luciferase, the Egr-1 expression vector, and the Sp-1 expression vector were described previously (11Baek S.J. Horowitz J.M. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33384-33392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Luciferase Reporter Assays—T98G cells were seeded in 12-well plates at 15 × 104 cells/well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and grown to 50–60% confluence. The plasmid mixtures, containing 1 μg of NAG-1 promoter luciferase construct and 0.025 μg of pRL-null (Promega), were transfected using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The co-transfection experiment was carried out using plasmid mixtures containing 0.5 μg of NAG-1 –133/+41 promoter luciferase construct, 0.5 μg of expression plasmid (Egr-1 or Sp-1), and 0.025 μg of pRL-null. The pcDNA3.1 empty vector (Invitrogen) was used as a negative control for the expression plasmid. After 24 h transfection, the cells were treated with 500 ng/ml TSA or Control (0.1% Me2SO) for 24 h, then harvested in 1× luciferase lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase activity was measured and normalized with the values of pRL-null luciferase activity using a dual luciferase assay kit (Promega). Short Interfering RNA (siRNA) Transfection—The NAG-1 siRNA (M-019875-01), the Sp-1 siRNA (M-026959-00), Egr-1 siRNA (M-006526-01), and control siRNA (D-001206-13) were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). T98G cells were grown to 50% confluence in antibiotic-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and transfected with each siRNA at 50 nm using Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After incubating for 4 h, the cells were washed and changed to the complete media and recovered overnight. The cells were subsequently treated by 500 ng/ml TSA or Control (0.1% Me2SO) for 24 h, and the effect of NAG-1 expression by Sp-1, or Egr-1 knock-down was investigated with Western blot analysis and real-time PCR. The effect of NAG-1, Egr-1, and Sp-1 siRNA were optimized with Western blot analysis. Flow Cytometry—T98G cells that transfected with control or NAG-1 siRNA were seeded in 6-well plates at 8 × 104 cells/well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and subsequently treated by 500 ng/ml TSA or control (0.1% Me2SO) for 72 h. Cells were trypsinized and harvested by centrifugation. Pellets were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mg/ml propidium iodide (Roche) and 0.5 mg/ml RNase (Roche), and stored overnight at 4 °C. Stained cells were analyzed using a BD Biosciences FACSort (Franklin Lakes, NJ) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The fraction of sub-G1 cells in the population was determined using CellQuest 3.1 software (BD Biosciences Flow Cytometry System). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assay was performed using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, T98G cells (3 × 106) in the 10-cm dish were treated with 500 ng/ml TSA or control (0.1% Me2SO) for 12 h and then fixed by the addition of 1% formaldehyde to media for 10 min at 37 °C. The fixed cells were scraped into conical tubes, pelleted, and lysed in SDS lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor (Roche and Sigma). DNA was sheared to fragments of 200–800 bp by sonication 10 times for 20 s at a 50% constant maximum power. The sonicated cell supernatant was diluted 10-fold in the ChIP dilution buffer. The chromatin was precleared with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose slurry for 1 h at 4 °C. The precleared supernatant was incubated with antibodies against Sp-1 (sc-59X), Egr-1 (sc-110), acetyl-histone H3 (06-599), acetyl-histone H4 (06-866), or normal rabbit IgG overnight at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were eluted with elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3). 5 m NaCl was added into eluted samples to reverse histone-DNA cross-links and the samples were heated overnight at 65 °C. Then DNAs were purified by using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) and analyzed by quantitative PCR, using primers specific to sequences at the NAG-1 promoter, i.e. 5′-CAGCTGTGGTCATTGGAGTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAGCTGGGACTGACCAGATG-3′ (reverse) for Sp-1 binding site ABC; and 5′-AGGCTGGAATGGTGTCCTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TAGGGGGAGGATCTTTAGGTG-3′ (reverse) for non-binding site 1; and 5′-TGATTCTAAGGTCGGAAATCAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AATCAGGCTGCACTTTGACC-3′ (reverse) for non-binding site 2. Statistical Analysis—All statistical differences between experimental groups were evaluated by the two-tailed unpaired Student's t test. DNA Methylation, Combination Treatment of TSA, and 5-Aza-dC—The NAG-1 promoter contains CpG islands and thus the expression of NAG-1 could be regulated by methylation. We examined the effect of the demethylation agent 5-aza-dC and the HDAC inhibitor TSA on the expression in glioblastoma cells, T98G. Cells were treated with vehicle or the chemicals for 48 h and protein and RNA were isolated. As shown in Fig. 1, treatment with 5-aza-dC did not increase NAG-1 protein or RNA expression, but TSA up-regulated both protein and RNA expression and acted synergistically with 5-aza-dC to induce NAG-1 expression. These findings suggest a role for histone deacetylation in the regulation of NAG-1 expression in brain cancer cells. HDAC Inhibitor, TSA Effects on NAG-1 Expression in T98G Cells—The induction of NAG-1 expression by TSA was both dose- and time-dependent (Fig. 2). The T98G cells were treated with several concentrations of TSA ranging from 10 to 600 ng/ml for 12 h and then the cells were harvested for protein or RNA analysis. An increase in NAG-1 expression at both the protein and mRNA levels was observed at concentrations as low as 20 ng/ml (Fig. 2, A and B). Cells were then treated with 500 ng/ml TSA for 0 to 48 h. The highest expression of NAG-1 mRNA was observed at 12 h and highest NAG-1 protein expression was observed at 18 h (Fig. 2, C and D). To further confirm the dependence on histone deacetylase inhibition, the effect of another HDAC inhibitor, sodium butyrate, was used. The induction of NAG-1 by sodium butyrate was both time- and dose-dependent (data not shown). Both HDAC inhibitors TSA and sodium butyrate induced NAG-1 expression in T98G cells and lend support to the hypothesis that the induction of NAG-1 is dependent on the inhibition of histone deacetylation. TSA Effect on NAG-1 Expression in Other Glioblastoma Cells—The basal level expression and induction by TSA of NAG-1 in several gliomas and normal human astrocyte cells were measured by mRNA and protein analysis. The basal expression of NAG-1 at the mRNA and the protein levels were very low in all cells except in A172 and the low grade cells, Hs683, SW1088, and normal human astrocyte NHA (Fig. 3, A and B). An increase in protein expression of NAG-1 was most notable in T98G and SW1088 cells after TSA treatment. Treatment with TSA increased the NAG-1 mRNA expression (Fig. 3C) in T98G, U87, and SW1088 cells. For all subsequent experiments we used T98G cells because of the large -fold increase in NAG-1 expression after TSA treatment. NAG-1 Induced by TSA Is Associated with Apoptosis—TSA is known to induce apoptosis and increased expression of NAG-1 has been linked to proapoptotic activity. Apoptosis induced by TSA was measured with cleaved PARP, an indicator of apoptosis, and flow cytometry. Cells were treated with TSA, and PARP cleavage and NAG-1 were measured. The TSA-dependent induction of PARP cleavage in T98G cells was both dose- and time-dependent (Fig. 4, A and B). TSA also induced PARP cleavage in U87, A172, and Hs683 cells but not in U118, U138 NHA, and SW1008 cells (data not shown). To investigate whether there is a link between the expression of NAG-1 and PARP cleavage, we used siRNA to inhibit TSA induced NAG-1 expression (Fig. 4C). T98G cells were transfected with control and NAG-1 siRNAs and then treated with TSA. Suppression of NAG-1 expression by siRNA and attenuation of cleaved PARP induced by TSA was observed. Next we measured apoptosis induced by TSA with flow cytometry. The increase in the sub-G1 population by TSA was dose- and time-dependent (data not shown). To investigate whether there is a link between the expression of NAG-1 and the increase of sub-G1 population, T98G cells were transfected with control and NAG-1 siRNAs, and then treated with TSA. After a 72-h treatment, cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry. Suppression of NAG-1 expression by siRNA significantly decreased the TSA-increased sub-G1 population. These results support the linkage of TSA-induced apoptosis to increased expression of NAG-1, suggesting that the expression of NAG-1 may mediate, in part, TSA-induced apoptosis. TSA Indirectly Induces NAG-1 Expression in T98G Cells—To investigate if TSA directly activate NAG-1 expression, or indirectly act by increasing the expression of specific transcriptional factors, cells were pretreated with cycloheximide (CHX) to inhibit de novo protein synthesis, and then incubated with TSA. The CHX pretreatment inhibited both NAG-1 protein and mRNA expressions (Fig. 5). These results indicate that TSA does not directly induce NAG-1 expression and requires new protein synthesis. Expression of Other Proteins After TSA Treatment—Because the induction of NAG-1 expression by TSA is dependent on de novo protein synthesis, expression of other proteins induced by TSA was investigated. Previously, our laboratory demonstrated that HDAC inhibitors induce COX-1 expression in normal human astrocyte cells and others have reported a suppression of COX-2 induction (31Taniura S. Kamitani H. Watanabe T. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16823-16830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 32Yamaguchi K. Lantowski A. Dannenberg A.J. Subbaramaiah K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32569-32577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated the effect of TSA on the expression of COX-1 and COX-2 in T98G cells (Fig. 6). TSA did not alter COX-1 and COX-2 expression in T98G cells. Because TSA increases the expression of other genes via Egr-1/Sp-1 transcription factors, the effect of TSA on the expression of Egr-1 and Sp1 was examined. TSA-induced Egr-1 and NAG-1 expression at the mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, both mRNA and protein expression of Egr-1 was induced by TSA at earlier times than observed, respectively, for NAG-1 protein and mRNA expression (Fig. 7). The peak protein expression for Egr-1 and NAG-1 occurred at 12 and 18 h, respectively, whereas peak mRNA expression for Egr-1 and NAG-1 occurred at 9 and 12 h. In contrast, Sp-1 protein expression was induced at 3 h and then decreased. Increases in histone H3 and H4 acetylation were observed within 3 h after treatment and is observed at times earlier than the increase in Egr-1 or NAG-1 expression. We proposed based on these findings that the induction of NAG-1 is associated with Sp-1 and Egr-1 expression.FIGURE 7Time-dependent affects of TSA on expression of other genes in T98G cells. A, Western blot analysis; and B, quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis show protein and mRNA induction after treatment with 500 ng/ml for each indicated time.

The values shown in the graph are the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Analysis of the Promoter Activity of Promoter Regions of the NAG-1 Gene—Luciferase NAG-1 promoter constructs comprised of different sequences of the promoter were transfected into T98G cells and then treated with TSA (Fig. 8, A and B). As an internal control, the plasmid pRL-null was used to determine the transfection efficiency. A large increase in luciferase activity was observed after TSA treatment for all NAG-1 promoter constructs, including the construct with the first 133 bp, a region containing the Sp-1/Egr-1 binding site. Thus, the TSA response element in the NAG-1 promoter is located in the first 133-base region and possibly implicates the Sp-1/Egr-1 binding site. TSA Response Element Is Located in Sp-1 and Egr-1 Binding Region of NAG-1 Promoter—The TSA response element is located between positions –133 and +41 in the NAG-1 promoter. Three Sp-1 binding sites (Sp-1A, Sp-1B, and Sp-1C) are located in this region of the NAG-1 promoter. Sp-1B and Sp-1C sites overlap with a putative Egr-1 binding site, and play a pivotal role in COX inhibitor-induced NAG-1 expression (3Baek S.J. Wilson L.C. Lee C.H. Eling T.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 301: 1126-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To further define the responsible element for TSA, 2 internal deletion constructs were transfected into T98G cells (Fig. 8, C and D). The pNAG133del.Sp-1A is a deletion in the Sp-1A site, whereas pNAG133del.Sp-1BC is a deletion in the Sp-1B and Sp-1C sites in the NAG-1 promoter region. After transfecting the deletion constructs into T98 cells, the cells were treated with TSA. Both deletion constructs showed significant reduction of luciferase activity as compared with each non-deletion construct. The luciferase activity of pNAG44, a shorter proximal construct without any Sp-1 binding site but containing the core promoter elements, was not increased by TSA. These findings indicate that the TSA response element is located in the region containing both the Sp-1 and Egr-1 binding sites. TSA-induced NAG-1 Expression Required Sp-1 and Egr-1—We next determined whether overexpression of Sp-1 or Egr-1 would affect TSA-induced NAG-1 expression. Sp-1 and Egr-1 expression vectors were generated and cotransfected along with the pNAG133/LUC reporter vector into T98G cells (Fig. 9). TSA treatment of Sp-1- and Egr-1-transfected cells enhanced the luciferase activity relative to TSA-treated vector-transfected cells. Egr-1 expression enhanced the promoter activity higher than Sp-1 expression, thus implicating Egr-1 expression as critical for TSA-induced NAG-1 expression. For fur"

Two major groups of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans are the transmembrane syndecans and glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored glypicans (2Couchman J.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Many proteins interact specifically with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) through saccharide sequences of well defined length and structure (3Raman R. Sasisekharan V. Sasisekharan R. Chem.

Spillmann D. Li J.P. Lindahl U. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The structure and specificity of HSGAGs at the cell surface is altered during tumor development primarily by matrix-degrading endoglycosidases and proteases (5Sasisekharan R. Shriver Z. Venkataraman G. Narayanasami U. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 521-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Remodeling of HSGAGs facilitates tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis (6Li J.P. Anticancer Agents Med. Chem. 2008; 8: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).

Most recently, we and others showed that ADAM12 regulates tumor progression in gene-modified mice models (12Kveiborg M. Frohlich C. Albrechtsen R. Tischler V. Dietrich N. Holck P. Kronqvist P.

Oncogene. 2006; 25: 5462-5466Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Unlike other ADAMs, ADAM12 is selectively overexpressed in osteoarthritic cartilage and enhances IGF-I-mediated chondrocyte proliferation by degradation of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)-5 (14Okada A. Mochizuki S. Yatabe T. Kimura T. Shiomi T. Fujita Y. Matsumoto H. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Iwamoto Y. Okada Y. Arthritis Rheum. 2008; 58: 778-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). ADAM12 is expressed as two splice variants, the transmembrane ADAM12-L (long form) and the secreted ADAM12-S (short form). The prototypical ADAM12-L contains extracellular prodomain (P); catalytic (C), disintegrin (D), cysteine-rich (CR), and epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) domains; a class I transmembrane region; and a cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 1A). ADAM12-S contains the five extracellular domains and a unique stretch of 33 amino acids at the C terminus. Both ADAM12 splice variants are processed between the prodomain and catalytic domain by a furin-like protease, and the mature form subsequently translocates to the plasma membrane or extracellular space. ADAM12 is an active metalloprotease, cleaving IGFBP-3 and -5 and mediating ectodomain shedding of pro-EGF (15Loechel F. Fox J.W. Murphy G. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cell. 2007; 18: 176-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain is responsible for the metalloprotease activity of ADAM12 and contains three zinc-binding histidines and a catalytic glutamic acid in the conserved HEXXHXXGXXH motif (17Loechel F.

Milla M.E. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Altogether, previous work has not identified the fate and exact function of the ADAM prodomains, but data suggest that they are probably not restricted to a single general mechanism. Shedding of pro-EGF is mediated by ADAM8, -10, -12, and -17, and this redundancy is typical of ADAM substrates (16Horiuchi K. Le Gall S. Schulte M. Yamaguchi T. Reiss K. Murphy G. Toyama Y. Hartmann D. Saftig P. Blobel C.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 176-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Specificity based on mechanistic insight is crucial in drug development, as illustrated by the disappointing outcomes of recent clinical trials of inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases for cancer treatment (28Coussens L.M. Fingleton B. Matrisian L.M. Science. 2002; 295: 2387-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (2355) Google Scholar). Here we show that the noncovalently associated prodomain and the catalytic domain of ADAM12 in concert form a novel molecular switch critical for the regulation of the ADAM12 proteolytic activity by HSGAGs. ADAM12-mediated proteolysis is specifically regulated by this mechanism in vitro and under physiological conditions. The identified mechanism represents a new avenue for specific therapeutic targeting of ADAM metalloproteases for treating human disease. Materials—Recombinant ADAM17 was purchased from R&D Systems.

After quenching of free activated groups using 1 m Tris, pH 7.5, beads were washed with PBS, 2 m NaCl to remove unbound material and then incubated for 15 min in PBS, 2 m urea at 60 °C for protein denaturation and digested overnight with thermolysin (53 mIU) at 50 °C, under agitation. Released peptides were removed by extensive washing with PBS, 2 m NaCl, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100. Heparin beads were rinsed in water and packed on a Biobrene-treated filter, and peptides cross-linked to heparin beads were sequenced using an Edman degradation automated protocol. ADAM12 Proteolytic Activity Assays—ADAM12 activity was assayed essentially as described using S-carboxymethylated transferrin (cmTF), the TNF-α-based fluorescent peptide substrate (32Jacobsen J. Visse R. S⊘rensen H.P. Enghild J.J. Brew K. Wewer U.M. Nagase H. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 36Moss M.L. Rasmussen F.H. Anal. Biochem. 2007; 366: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), or a substrate containing 82 residues of HB-EGF between E. coli NusA and GFP constructed to test the proposed cleavage of HB-EGF by ADAM12 (37Oh M. Im I. Lee Y.J. Kim Y.H. Yoon J.H. Park H.G. Higashiyama S. Kim Y.C. Park W.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2004; 14: 6071-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The exact assay conditions for each experiment are specified in the figure legends. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Staining of Cells and Quantitation of Fluorescence—CHO or ARH (see Ref. 38Liu W. Litwack E.D. Stanley M.J. Langford J.K. Lander A.D. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22825-22832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) cells used for the experiments were transfected with ADAM12-PC cDNAs cloned into pcDNA3, or purified ADAM12 was added to the media of cells in culture. Living cells were incubated with ADAM12 antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C before fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde as described (33Iba K. Albrechtsen R. Gilpin B. Fröhlich C. Loechel F. Zolkiewska A. Ishiguro K. Kojima T. Liu W. Langford J.K. Sanderson R.D. Brakebusch C. Fassler R. Wewer U.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1143-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). To avoid influence from intracellular ADAM12, permeabilization by detergents was not performed. After fixation, the suspended cells were centrifuged for 2 min in a Cytospin centrifuge (Shandon). After washing in PBS, both the adherent and suspended cells were incubated with an appropriate AlexaFluor-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature, mounted in Dako fluorescent mounting medium (Dako A/S), and examined using an inverted confocal microscope (LSM510 meta; Carl Zeiss, Inc.) or an inverted Zeiss Axiovert 200. The images were processed using the Axiovision program (Carl Zeiss). The fluorescence intensity on the cell surface was quantitated using the Profile Display in the Axiovision Program on the LSM510 metamicroscope. The biological experiments were repeated three times with three analytical replicates. Immunocapture ADAM12-S Proteolytic Activity Assay—Ninety-six-well Maxisorp plates (Nunc) were coated with monoclonal antibody mAb-11 at 250 μg/ml in NaHCO3, pH 9.6 (2 h at room temperature). Next, wells were washed four times in PBS-T (PBS containing 5% Tween 20) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with either serum-free conditioned medium from HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with ADAM12-S constructs or serum samples. Wells were washed four times in PBS-T and four times in assay buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8). ADAM12-S activity was measured by adding 10 μm TNF-α-based peptide substrate to the wells, and fluorescence was quantitated at 1-min intervals at excitation and emission wave-lengths of 485 and 530, respectively. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Assay for Pro-EGF Shedding—Two days after transfection, CHO cells were starved for 2 h in serum-free medium essentially as described (16Horiuchi K. Le Gall S. Schulte M. Yamaguchi T. Reiss K. Murphy G. Toyama Y. Hartmann D. Saftig P. Blobel C.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 176-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The conditioned media (supernatants) were collected, and cell lysates were prepared using PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). All transfections were performed in triplicate. Cell lysates or supernatants were mixed in a 1:1 ratio with 2 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) in a 96-well plate. The samples were incubated at 37 °C, and absorbance was monitored at 405 nm (A405) once every hour. The activity in supernatants and lysates was calculated from the A405/min enzyme velocity, and ADAM12 pro-EGF shedding activity was expressed as the ratio between this value in supernatants and lysates. The mean value of the ratio for supernatant/lysate was rescaled as -fold induction as compared with the mock control (Fig. 1C) or plotted directly (Fig. 1D). All activity measurements were performed in triplicate. Staining of Tissue Sections and Tissue Extraction—Cryostat sections of human placenta tissue at term were air-dried for 15 min and preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C in PBS alone or PBS containing heparinase I-III at 5 units/ml or heparin at 10 μg/ml. Sections were stained with antibodies recognizing heparanase and the ADAM12-S-specific 33-amino acid stretch (rb116). Normal mouse or rabbit serum was used as control. Assay for IGFBP-3 Degradation by ADAM12—Human serum was diluted 10-fold in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and incubated with 500 nm ADAM12 enzyme in the presence of GAGs and/or heparinase I-III, as indicated. ADAM12-mediated Ectodomain Shedding Is Regulated by HSGAGs—Wild-type CHO K1 and GAG-deficient CHO 761 cells (39Esko J.D. Weinke J.L. Taylor W.H. Ekborg G. Roden L. Anantharamaiah G. Gawish A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12189-12195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were transfected with ADAM12-Δcyt (lacking the cytoplasmic tail) or ADAM12-S in combination with the pro-EGF-alkaline phosphatase (AP) reporter construct, and pro-EGF shedding assayed (Fig. 1, A and B). Transfection of CHO K1 cells with ADAM12-Δcyt increased pro-EGF shedding 3-fold compared with the mock control, whereas ADAM12-S inefficiently shed pro-EGF (Fig. 1C). ADAM12-Δcyt is efficiently expressed at the cell surface of CHO K1 cells, whereas ADAM12-L (including the cytoplasmic tail) is only weakly expressed. ADAM12-L was therefore not used in the shedding experiments. Interestingly, transfection of CHO 761 cells with ADAM12-Δcyt increased pro-EGF shedding by 7-fold compared with mock controls (Fig. 1C). Cotransfection of ADAM12-Δcyt and human heparanase stimulated ADAM12-Δcyt-mediated pro-EGF shedding in CHO K1 cells, whereas shedding of pro-EGF by ADAM12-Δcyt in CHO 761 cells was inhibited by heparin (Fig. 1D). Western blotting showed that ADAM12-Δcyt was expressed at similar levels in CHO K1 and CHO 761 cells when cotransfected with human heparanase or treated with heparin (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis revealed that ADAM12-Δcyt was present in similar concentrations on the cell surface of both CHO K1 and CHO 761 transfected cells (supplemental Fig. 1). These experiments indicated that heparin and heparanase regulated ADAM12-Δcyt-mediated shedding of pro-EGF from the cell surface. ADAM12 Interacts with HSGAGs by Its Prodomain and Catalytic Domain—To investigate the regulatory mechanism of pro-EGF shedding by ADAM12, we used heparin-Sepharose column chromatography, as well as surface plasmon resonance analysis. Purified recombinant ADAM12-S bound to heparin-Sepharose and was eluted between 200 and 1000 mm NaCl (Fig. 2A). Surface plasmon resonance analysis also demonstrated that purified ADAM12-S bound to heparin (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. 2A). The interaction appeared to be complex, because the dissociation constant (Kd) could not be calculated by fitting the data to simple models of ligand-receptor interaction. Interestingly, the interaction between ADAM12-S and heparin could be dissociated by EDTA, suggesting a dependence on divalent metal ions bound to ADAM12-S (data not shown). Both ADAM12-PCD and ADAM12-PC also bound to heparin (Fig. 2B). Sensorgrams of the ADAM12-PC domain interaction with heparin were fitted to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model with a dissociation constant of ∼76-78 nm (supplemental Fig. 2B). Recombinant ADAM12-P bound heparin with an affinity similar to ADAM12-PCD and ADAM12-PC, whereas the cysteine-rich (CR) domain and disintegrin (D) domains did not bind heparin (Fig. 2B). The heparin interaction sites on purified ADAM12-S were mapped using a previously described “beads approach” based on the formation of cross-linked complexes of the protein of interest with heparin beads, the proteolytic digestion of these complexes, and the subsequent identification of the heparin binding peptides by N-terminal sequencing (35Vives R.R. Crublet E. Andrieu J.P. Gagnon J. Rousselle P. Lortat-Jacob H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54327-54333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). By this method, three overlapping heparin-binding peptides in the prodomain and one in the catalytic domain were identified (Fig. 2C). The specificity of ADAM12-PC binding to GAGs was assessed by interaction and competition assays using surface plasmon resonance analysis (supplemental Fig. 2C). Heparan sulfate inhibited ADAM12-PC binding to the heparin surface as efficiently as heparin. Heparin is characterized by high levels of sulfation and is a stronger polyanion than heparan sulfate (4Kreuger J. Spillmann D. Li J.P. Lindahl U. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The similar efficiency indicated that the interaction involved specific determinants on heparan sulfate, whereas the increased ionic potential of heparin appeared less important. l-Chondroitin 4- or 6-sulfates did not interfere substantially with heparin binding to ADAM12-PC. Dermatan sulfate partially inhibited ADAM12-PC binding to heparin. However, substantial binding of ADAM12-PC directly to a dermatan sulfate surface was not observed (data not shown), indicating that the interaction between ADAM12-PC and dermatan sulfate was weak. Heparin oligosaccharides of defined molecular weight were tested for the ability to compete for binding of heparin to ADAM12-PC (supplemental Fig. 2D). Oligosaccharides of at least 16 monosaccharides were efficient competitors for heparin binding, suggesting that the structural binding site involves several amino acid residues. HSGAGs Inhibit the Proteolytic Activity of ADAM12—We next investigated the functional relevance of the binding of HSGAGs to ADAM12 using three different protease activity assays. The substrates included cmTF, NusA/HB-EGF/green fluorescent protein (GFP), and a tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-based fluorescent peptide. These substrates did not themselves bind heparin (data not shown). In particular, the heparin-binding domain of HB-EGF was not included in the NusA/HB-EGF/GFP chimeric protein. Cleavage of cmTF by ADAM12-S and ADAM12-PC was inhibited by heparin in a dose-dependent manner, and the inhibition could be reversed by incubation with heparinase I-III from Flavobacterium heparinum (Fig. 3, A and B). To ensure that the inhibition was not a substrate-specific effect, the NusA/HB-EGF/GFP and fluorescent TNF-α-based substrates (36Moss M.L. Rasmussen F.H. Anal. Biochem. 2007; 366: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) were tested. NusA/HB-EGF/GFP was cleaved within the HB-EGF-encoding region by ADAM12-S, and the cleavage was inhibited by heparin (Fig. 3C). Both ADAM12-S and ADAM17 proteolytic activities are highly affected by salts like NaCl (32Jacobsen J. Visse R. S⊘rensen H.P. Enghild J.J. Brew K. Wewer U.M. Nagase H. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 40Milla M.E. Leesnitzer M.A. Moss M.L. Clay W.C. Carter H.L. Miller A.B. Su J.L. Lambert M.H. Willard D.H. Sheeley D.M. Kost T.A. Burkhart W. Moyer M. Blackburn R.K. Pahel G.L. Mitchell J.L. Hoffman C.R. Becherer J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30563-30570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, the observation that heparin inhibited ADAM12-S but not ADAM17 cleavage of the TNF-α-based substrate indicated that inhibition was specific and not mediated by sulfate ions or sodium counterions contributed by heparin (Fig. 3D). Consistent with the interaction data, heparan sulfate inhibited the ADAM12-S degradation of cmTF with efficiency similar to that of heparin, whereas l-chondroitin 4- or 6-sulfates, dermatan sulfate, and completely desulfated heparin were unable to inhibit the activity (data not shown). Furthermore, a substantial inhibition of ADAM12-S proteolysis of both cmTF and the TNF-α-based substrate could be achieved with heparin oligosaccharides containing eight (dp8) or more saccharide units (Fig. 3E). These results showed that the proteolysis of three different substrates by ADAM12-S could be inhibited by relatively short HSGAG structures. Binding of ADAM12-PC to t"

Because regulation of transcription initiation seems to be nonfunctional in this parasite, it is important to investigate other regulatory mechanisms of adaptation. Regulatory mechanisms at the level of signal transduction pathways involving phosphoinositides are good candidates for this purpose. Here we report the identification of the first phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) in T. cruzi, with similarity with its yeast counterpart, Vps34p. TcVps34 specifically phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol to produce phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, thus confirming that it belongs to class III PI3K family. Overexpression of TcVps34 resulted in morphological and functional alterations related to vesicular trafficking. Although inhibition of TcVps34 with specific PI3K inhibitors, such as wortmannin and LY294,000, resulted in reduced regulatory volume decrease after hyposmotic stress, cells overexpressing this enzyme were resistant to these inhibitors. Furthermore, these cells were able to recover their original volume faster than wild type cells when they were submitted to severe hyposmotic stress. In addition, in TcVps34-overexpressing cells, the activities of vacuolar-H+-ATPase and vacuolar H+-pyrophosphatase were altered, suggesting defects in the acidification of intracellular compartments. Furthermore, receptor-mediated endocytosis was partially blocked although fluid phase endocytosis was not affected, confirming a function for TcVps34 in membrane trafficking. Taken together, these results strongly support that TcVps34 plays a prominent role in vital processes for T. cruzi survival such as osmoregulation, acidification, and vesicular trafficking.

PI3Ks belong to a large family of enzymes that has been divided into three functional classes on the basis of their protein domain structure, lipid substrate specificity, and regulatory properties. Class I PI3Ks were the first ones to be identified and are important components of the signaling pathways that regulate eukaryotic cell growth (3Hiles I.D. Otsu M. Volinia S. Fry M.J. Gout I.

Biol. 1998; 14: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). These PI3Ks have a 110-kDa catalytic subunit that exhibits a substrate preference for PI 4-phosphate and PI 4,5-bisphosphate (5Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Class II PI3Ks are less well known but may also function in the regulation of cell growth (5Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar, 6Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar) and, additionally, in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (7Brown R.A. Shepherd P.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 535-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 8Gaidarov I. Smith M.E. Domin J. Keen J.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 443-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). These enzymes prefer phosphatidylinositol (PI) as substrate but may also utilize PI 4-phosphate. Finally, class III family of PI3Ks is related to the yeast vacuolar protein sorting 34, Vps34p, and their homologs from other eukaryotes. Vps34p-like kinases specifically phosphorylate PI to produce phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI 3-P) and are associated with a Vps15p-like protein kinase (6Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 9Schu P.V. Takegawa K. Fry M.J. Stack J.H. Waterfield M.D. Emr S.D. Science. 1993; 260: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). In addition to protein sorting to the vacuole/ lysosome, class III PI3Ks have been implicated in several other membrane transport events, including endocytosis, vesicle acidification, and autophagy (10Burda P.

The protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas disease in Latin America and the main cause of cardiac death in endemic areas. Currently over 15 million people are infected, and another 28 million people are at risk of infection (15Guhl F. Lazdins-Helds J. Report of the Scientific Working Group on Chagas Disease, Buenos Aires, Argentina, April 17–20, 2005. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland2007Google Scholar). As T. cruzi passes through its digenetic life cycle, it encounters extreme fluctuations in external osmolarity. These osmotic fluctuations occur both within the insect gut (16Kollien A.H. Grospietsch T. Kleffmann T. Zerbst-Boroffka I. Schaub G.A. J. Insect. Physiol. 2001; 47: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and also when the parasite moves through the vertebrate host. Previous studies on the response of T. cruzi to hyposmotic stress have shown that both insect and vertebrate stages possess a robust regulatory volume decrease (RVD) mechanism that completely reverses cell swelling (17Rohloff P. Docampo R. Exp. Parasitol. 2008; 118: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This process is accomplished by the efflux of various ions and osmolytes (18Rohloff P. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 126: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and the release of water by the contractile vacuole complex (19Montalvetti A. Rohloff P. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38673-38682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been found that cyclic AMP levels increase when T. cruzi epimastigotes are subjected to hyposmotic stress (20Rohloff P. Montalvetti A. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52270-52281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Recently, we described a membrane-associated cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase, TcrPDEC2, which is inhibited by the same inhibitors that affect the RVD of the parasites after hyposmotic stress (20Rohloff P. Montalvetti A. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52270-52281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 21Alonso G.D. Schoijet A.C. Torres H.N. Flawia M.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 145: 40-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). TcrPDEC2 is characterized by the presence of a FYVE domain, which is a phosphoinositide-binding motif. It is known that phosphoinositides serve as lipid signals required for membrane recruitment of several proteins implicated in the regulation of vesicular transport and intracellular protein sorting (22Corvera S. Traffic. 2001; 2: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 23Simonsen A. Wurmser A.E. Emr S.D. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), and control the translocation and activity of proteins that contain phosphoinositide-binding motifs such as the FYVE domain, as well as the pleckstrin homology, PX, and ENTH domains (23Simonsen A. Wurmser A.E. Emr S.D. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 24Wishart M.J. Taylor G.S. Dixon J.E. Cell. 2001; 105: 817-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Because inhibitors of TcrPDEC2 affect osmoregulation in T. cruzi, and TcrPDEC2 possesses a FYVE domain able to bind to PI 3-P, we hypothesized that PI 3-P production might have a role in osmoregulation. However, very little is known about the phosphoinositide signaling in trypanosomatids, and up to now only one trypanosome ortholog of Vps34, named TbVps34, has been described in Trypanosoma brucei (25Hall B.S.

However, no functional analysis of this enzyme was performed, and it is not known whether that enzyme specifically catalyzes PI 3-P production (25Hall B.S. Gabernet-Castello C. Voak A. Goulding D.

Here we report the identification and functional characterization of TcVps34, the first class III PI3K reported in T. cruzi. This study provides new insights into the physiological importance of the PI3K pathway and describes the role of TcVps34 in vital processes, such as osmoregulation, acidification, and receptor-mediated endocytosis. Chemicals and Reagents—All radiochemicals used in this work were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and restriction endonucleases were from New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA. Bacto-tryptose, yeast nitrogen base, and liver infusion were from Difco. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Cell Cultures and Extracts—T. cruzi epimastigote forms (CL Brener strain) were cultured at 28 °C for 7 days in LIT medium (5 g ·liter–1 liver infusion, g ·liter–1 bacto-tryptose, 68 mm NaCl, 5.3 mm KCl, 22 mm Na2PO4, 0.2% (w/v) glucose, 0.002% (w/v) hemin) supplemented with 10% (v/v) newborn calf serum, 100,000 units ·liter–1 penicillin, and 100 mg ·liter–1 streptomycin. Cell viability was assessed by direct microscopic examination. For T. cruzi extracts, 108 epimastigotes were harvested by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 10 min and washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cell pellets were then resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.3, containing 0.01 mg ·ml–1 leupeptin, 25 units ·ml–1 aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) and lysed by six cycles of freezing in liquid N2 and thawing at 4 °C. The total extracts were further centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g to obtain P100 and S100 fractions. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, SEY6210Δvps34:Trp1, was a kind gift of Dr. Yoshinori Ohsumi (26Kihara A. Noda T. Ishihara N. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Before transformation, this strain was grown at 30 °C in synthetic selected media without tryptophan (0.17% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, 0.5% (w/v) ammonium sulfate, and 2% (w/v) glucose, supplemented with the corresponding amino acid mixture). Transformant cells were selected in minimal medium without Trp and uracil. Cloning of TcVps34 Gene—The gene sequence corresponding to the T. brucei TbVps34 PI3K (AC159405) was used to screen T. cruzi sequences in the GeneDB data base using the WU-Blast2 algorithm. Two oligonucleotides carrying hemi-restriction sites (PI3K-Fw-pENTR-KpnI 5′-GGTACCATGGCCACCAACGAAGGCAACGT-3′ and PI3K-Rv-pENTR-XhoI 5′-CTCGAGTTAGTGCCGTGTTGCCTGCGCT-3′) were designed from the identified sequence (Tc00.1047053511903. 160). PCR amplifications were carried out using 600–800 ng of T. cruzi genomic DNA, 100 ng of each primer, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, and 2 units of Pfu Ultra High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Three PCR products were sequenced and compared with the original sequence found at GeneDB. Taken into account that some discrepancies were detected, we reported the obtained sequence to NCBI data bank (accession number EU276115). Sequence Analysis—The search in a T. cruzi genome data base was performed with Wu-Blast2. Sequence identity was analyzed with the BLASTP (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and Clustal W. Multiple sequence alignment with default parameters setting was used to generate the alignments. Protein domains were determined using SMART and PROSITE software. Southern, Northern, and Western blot Analyses—Genomic DNA was purified as described by Pereira et al. (27Pereira C.A. Alonso G.D. Paveto M.C. Iribarren A. Cabanas M.L. Torres H.N. Flawia M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1495-1501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was isolated from 108 epimastigote cells in the exponential growth phase using TRIzol reagents, as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Southern and Northern blot analyses were performed as described by Alonso et al. (28Alonso G.D. Schoijet A.C. Torres H.N. Flawia M.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2007; 152: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The products were revealed with a specific 990-bp TcVps34 probe obtained by digestion of the 2,724-bp fragment with KpnI and PvuII. All probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Prime-a-Gene kit (Promega, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's instructions. For Western blot analysis, 80 μg of P100 and S100 T. cruzi fractions were loaded into 8% (w/v) SDS-PAGE as described by Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) and electrotransferred to Hybond-C membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The transferred membranes were then incubated for 4 h with a 1:2,000 dilution of rabbit anti-His6 (Gene Tex, Inc. San Antonio, TX). Detection was carried out by incubating with a 1:5,000 dilution of a goat anti-rabbit conjugated to peroxidase (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). The latter was developed with the ECL Plus™ Western blotting detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Complementation Assay—The coding region of the TcVps34 gene was excised from the pDEST17 Escherichia coli expression vector (Invitrogen) and inserted into the KpnI and XhoI restriction sites in the galactose-inducible yeast expression vector pYES2 (URA3; Invitrogen). The yeast Vps34 knock-out strain SEY6210 Δvps34:Trp1 was transformed with either the empty vector or the vector carrying the TcVps34 gene, using the lithium acetate procedure (30Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Yeast. 1991; 7: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Transformed cells were selected in minimal medium (without Trp and uracil) at 30 °C. For complementation assays, transformed cells were grown to an A600 = 1.8–2 with 20% (w/v) glucose as carbon source and plated in the same selective media supplemented with 20% (w/v) galactose and 10% (w/v) raffinose at different dilutions. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 3 days. Expression and Purification of Recombinant TcVps34 in E. coli—Full-length TcVps34 gene was amplified using the following primers carrying hemi-restriction sites: PI3K-Fw-pENTR-KpnI 5′-GGTACCATGGCCACCAACGAAGGCAACGT-3′ and PI3K-Rv-pENTR-XhoI 5′-CTCGAGTTAGTGCCGTGTTGCCTGCGCT-3′, cloned into pGEM-T Easy plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) and subcloned into the gateway pENTR3C vector (Invitrogen). To express the N-terminal His-tagged TcVps34 in E. coli, a recombination reaction was performed to transfer the coding sequence from pENTR3C into the pDEST17 expression vector (Invitrogen). The construct (pDEST17-TcVps34) was transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS host (E. coli B, F–, dem, ompT, hsdS, (rb–, m –B), galλ(DE3), [pLysS, camr]), and the recombinant protein was induced with 500 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete mini, Roche Applied Science). The protein extract was prepared by sonication, centrifuged, and resuspended in the same lysis buffer. This fraction was purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Invitrogen) and eluted with lysis buffer containing 80 mm imidazole. PI3K Activity Assays and Substrate Specificity—PI3K activity assays were carried out as described before with some modifications (31Gunther J. Nguyen M. Hartl A. Kunkel W. Zipfel P.F. Eck R. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Partially purified recombinant protein (rTcVps34, 0.5 and 5 μg) was assayed in 75-μl reactions containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 4 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mg ·ml–1 sonicated phosphatidylinositol, 40 μm ATP, and 25 μCi ·ml–1 [γ-32P]ATP. The mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min, and reactions were terminated by the addition of 150 μl of 1 m HCl. Lipids were extracted first with CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1) plus 10 mm EDTA, and the resulting organic phase was then extracted with CH3OH/HCl (100:1) plus 10 mm EDTA. The obtained organic phase was dried with nitrogen gas, resuspended in CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1), and spotted onto LK6D silica gel TLC plate (Whatman) pretreated with potassium oxalate and developed with CHCl3/CH3OH/NH4OH (40: 40:15). Radiolabeled phosphoinositides were detected by autoradiography. For the substrate specificity experiments, the PI3K activity assays were carried out as described above except that PI, PI 4-P, or PI 4,5-P2 were included as substrates (2 mg ·ml–1). For PI3K activity assays using T. cruzi epimastigote cell extracts, 25, 50, or 75 μg of total protein were used. After a standard activity reaction as described above, radiolabeled phosphoinositides were measured in a liquid scintillation counter and identified by TLC followed by autoradiography. Unlabeled PI, PI 4-P, and PI 4,5-P2 standards were visualized by staining with iodine vapors. Parasite Transfection—The full-length TcVps34 gene was amplified by using the primers PI3K-Fw-pTREX-HindIII 5′-AAGCTTATGACCACCGAAAACGT-3′ and PI3K-Rv-pENTR-XhoI 5′-CTCGAGTTAGTGCCGTGTTGCCTGCGCT-3′. The TcVps34 gene fused to a His tag in the N-terminal was amplified from the construct pDEST17-TcVps34 by using the primer pDEST17-Fw-HindIII 5′-AAGCTTATGTCGTACTACCATCACCATCA-3′ and the same reverse primer PI3K-Rv-pENTR-XhoI. Both 2,724-bp PCR products were then cloned into pGEM-T Easy plasmid and subcloned into the pTREX expression vector, which integrates in the ribosomal locus and allows high expression levels driven by the strong polymerase I rRNA promoter in T. cruzi (32Vazquez M.P. Levin M.J. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 239: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). T. cruzi epimastigotes of CL Brener strain were transfected with the pTREX-TcVps34 and pTREX-His-TcVps34 constructs as described previously (32Vazquez M.P. Levin M.J. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 239: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Parasites transfected with a pTREX-GFP construction were monitored by fluorescence microscopy as a selection control. Stable cell lines were achieved after 60 days of treatment with 500 μg ·ml–1 G418 (Invitrogen), and the transgenic condition was confirmed by Southern and Western blot analyses. Differential Interference Contrast and Video Microscopy—Differential interference contrast (DIC) and video microscopy images were taken using an Olympus IX-71 inverted fluorescence microscope with a Photometrix CoolSnapHQ CCD camera driven by DeltaVision software (Applied Precision, Seattle, WA). For analysis of contractile vacuole filling, video microscopy of epimastigotes adhered to poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and bathed in isosmotic buffer was carried out. Videos were recorded for 5 min and reconstructed using the Delta-Vision Softworx software. For video microscopy of severe hyposmotic treatment, cells were adhered to poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and bathed in 65 mosm buffer. Videos were recorded for 20 min. Electron Microscopy—About 1 × 108 epimastigote forms were harvested and washed twice with PBS. The parasites were fixed with freshly prepared 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 4% formaldehyde, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.3, for 1 h and then embedded in epoxy resin, sectioned, and stained using standard methods for transmission electron microscopy. Images were obtained on a Zeiss 900 transmission electron microscope operating at 80 kV. For scanning electron microscopy, cells were fixed as before, adhered to poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips, dehydrated in ethanol series, critical point dried, and coated with gold in a Balzers gold sputtering system. Cells were observed in a JEOL JSM 6340F field emission scanning electron microscope operating at 5 kV. Regulatory Volume Decrease—Epimastigotes were collected and washed twice with isotonic chloride buffer (Iso-Cl buffer, 137 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8.5 mm Na2PO4, 20 mm HEPES, 11 mm glucose, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, pH 7.4). The osmolarity of the buffer was adjusted to 300 ± 5 mosm as verified by an Advanced Instruments 3D3 osmometer (Norwood, MA). The washed cells were resuspended in Iso-Cl buffer to a cell density of 1 × 108 ·ml–1 cells. The cells were distributed in 96-well plates with 150 μl per well in triplicate, and hyposmotic stress was induced by 1:1 dilution of cell suspension with sterile deionized water, resulting in a final osmolarity of 150 mosm. The absorbance changes at 550 nm were recorded every 20 s for 10 min using a SpectraMax M2e plate reader (Molecular Devices) (18Rohloff P. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 126: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Membrane Integrity and Amino Acid Release—After treatment with the inhibitors wortmannin and LY294,000, membrane integrity was determined by ethidium bromide exclusion as described by Rohloff et al. (18Rohloff P. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 126: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Total amino acid analysis of the cell extracts and the supernatant fraction of epimastigote cells exposed to hypotonic or isotonic buffer were determined as described before (18Rohloff P. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 126: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). H+Transport Assays—Active H+ transport was assayed as described previously (33Scott D.A. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Zhong L. Lu H.G. Moreno S.N. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22151-22158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) by measuring changes in the absorbance of acridine orange (493–530 nm) in an OLIS-modified SLM-Aminco DW2000 dual wavelength spectrophotometer. Briefly, for H+-ATPase activity, epimastigotes were incubated at 30 °C in a 2.5-ml standard reaction medium containing 125 mm sucrose, 65 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 2 mm KH2PO4, 450 μm EGTA, 4 μm acridine orange, and 1 μm digitonin. At the indicated time the reaction was started by adding 1 mm ATP. Bafilomycin A1 and sodium o-vanadate were added at 1 and 100 μm, respectively. For H+-proton translocating pyrophosphatase (PPase) activity, the standard reaction medium contained 130 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 2 mm KH2PO4, 450 μm EGTA, 4 μm acridine orange, and 1 μm digitonin. At the indicated times the reaction was started by adding 100 μm PPi, and the specific inhibitor aminomethylene diphosphonate (AMDP) was added at 100 μm. Each experiment was repeated at least three times with different cell preparations. Transferrin and Fluid Phase Uptake—For FITC-transferrin (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) uptake, epimastigotes were harvested and washed twice in serum-free LIT medium (sfLIT). The cells were incubated at 28 °C for 10 min in sfLIT. FITC-transferrin (50 μg ·ml–1) was added, and the cells were further incubated at 28 °C for various periods of time. Uptake was stopped by the addition of ice-cold sfLIT, and the cells were washed once at 4 °C and fixed for 30 min in 4% formaldehyde in PBS. The cells were adhered to slides, mounted, and examined immediately. Fluid phase uptake was monitored with FITC-BSA (Sigma). Uptake was performed as described above using 50 μg ·ml–1 of FITC-BSA. For fluorescence quantification, the images were taken under nonsaturating conditions using identical exposure times. Fluorescence intensity was determined using Data Inspector program of the Delta Vision restoration system. Cloning and Characterization of the TcVps34 Gene—A search of T. cruzi data bases using the TbVps34 gene from T. brucei as query resulted in the identification of an orthologous sequence in this parasite (Tc00.1047053511903.160). Two oligonucleotides designed from this sequence were used to amplify the T. cruzi gene using genomic DNA as template. After sequencing TcVps34, the 2,724-bp open reading frame was identified. The sequence contained several differences from that reported at the GeneDB data base and was therefore annotated at the NCBI under the accession number EU276115. The predicted amino acid sequence of TcVps34 presented the phosphoinositide 3-kinase class III accessory domain (amino acids 318–477), which has been suggested to be involved in substrate presentation, and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase catalytic domain (amino acids 513–906). In addition, TcVps34 possesses a C2 domain at the N-terminal region (amino acids 97–222), which is present in several proteins related to signal transduction (supplemental data S1). Amino acid sequence analysis showed that TcVps34 has the highest identity (57.4%) with T. brucei Vps34 (XP_847451), followed by the Leishmania major and S. cerevisiae orthologs (35.1 and 25.7%, respectively) (supplemental data S1). In addition, TcVps34 presented only 27.5% of identity with the human class III PI3K (NP_002638). TcVps34 Complements a Yeast Vps34 Knock-out Strain—To analyze whether the TcVps34 gene encodes a functional PI3K, the TcVps34 coding region was subcloned into pYES2 expression vector and used to complement a S. cerevisiae Vps34 knock-out strain (SEY6210Δvps34:Trp1), which possesses a temperature-sensitive phenotype. Expression of TcVps34 restored the ability of mutant cells to grow at 37 °C, whereas transformation with the empty vector did not, indicating that the TcVps34 gene encodes a catalytically active PI3K (Fig. 1). TcVps34 Is a Functional Class III Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase—The formation of PI 3-P by TcVps34 was tested using the partial affinity-purified recombinant protein (Fig. 2A). After a standard PI3K radioactive assay, phosphorylated lipids wer"
https://openalex.org/W1975557807,"In predator-free large herbivore populations, where density-dependent feedbacks occur at the limit where forage resources can no longer support the population, environmental catastrophes may play a significant role in population regulation. The potential role of fire as a stochastic mass-mortality event limiting these populations is poorly understood, so too the behavioural and physiological responses of the affected animals to this type of large disturbance event. During September 2005, a wildfire resulted in mortality of 29 (18% population mortality) and injury to 18, African elephants in Pilanesberg National Park, South Africa. We examined movement and herd association patterns of six GPS-collared breeding herds, and evaluated population physiological response through faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (stress) levels. We investigated population size, structure and projected growth rates using a simulation model. After an initial flight response post-fire, severely injured breeding herds reduced daily displacement with increased daily variability, reduced home range size, spent more time in non-tourist areas and associated less with other herds. Uninjured, or less severely injured, breeding herds also shifted into non-tourist areas post-fire, but in contrast, increased displacement rate (both mean and variability), did not adjust home range size and formed larger herds post-fire. Adult cow stress hormone levels increased significantly post-fire, whereas juvenile and adult bull stress levels did not change significantly. Most mortality occurred to the juvenile age class causing a change in post-fire population age structure. Projected population growth rate remained unchanged at 6.5% p.a., and at current fecundity levels, the population would reach its previous level three to four years post-fire. The natural mortality patterns seen in elephant populations during stochastic events, such as droughts, follows that of the classic mortality pattern seen in predator-free large ungulate populations, i.e. mainly involving juveniles. Fire therefore functions in a similar manner to other environmental catastrophes and may be a natural mechanism contributing to population limitation. Welfare concerns of arson fires, burning during ""hot-fire"" conditions and the conservation implications of fire suppression (i.e. removal of a potential contributing factor to natural population regulation) should be integrated into fire management strategies for conservation areas."
https://openalex.org/W1984562484,"The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) reduction assay is a frequently used and easily reproducible method to measure beta-amyloid (Aβ) toxicity in different types of single cell culture. To our knowledge, the influence of Aβ on MTT reduction has never been tested in more complex tissue. Initially, we reproduced the disturbed MTT reduction in neuron and astroglia primary cell cultures from rats as well as in the BV2 microglia cell line, utilizing four different Aβ species, namely freshly dissolved Aβ (25-35), fibrillar Aβ (1-40), oligomeric Aβ (1-42) and oligomeric Aβ (1-40). In contrast to the findings in single cell cultures, none of these Aβ species altered MTT reduction in rat organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHC). Moreover, application of Aβ to acutely isolated hippocampal slices from adult rats and in vivo intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ also did not influence the MTT reduction in the respective tissue. Failure of Aβ penetration into the tissue cannot explain the differences between single cells and the more complex brain tissue. Thus electrophysiological investigations disclosed an impairment of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices from rat by application of oligomeric Aβ (1-40), but not by freshly dissolved Aβ (25-35) or fibrillar Aβ (1-40). In conclusion, the experiments revealed a glaring discrepancy between single cell cultures and complex brain tissue regarding the effect of different Aβ species on MTT reduction. Particularly, the differential effect of oligomeric versus other Aβ forms on LTP was not reflected in the MTT reduction assay. This may indicate that the Aβ oligomer effect on synaptic function reflected by LTP impairment precedes changes in formazane formation rate or that cells embedded in a more natural environment in the tissue are less susceptible to damage by Aβ, raising cautions against the consideration of single cell MTT reduction activity as a reliable assay in Alzheimer's drug discovery studies."

The Mcm2-7 proteins form a heterohexameric ring that hydrolyzes ATP and provide the motor function for this unwinding complex. A comprehensive study of how individual Mcm subunit biochemical activities relate to unwinding function has not been accomplished. We studied the mechanism of the Mcm4-Mcm6-Mcm7 complex, a useful model system because this complex has helicase activity in vitro. We separately purified each of three Mcm subunits until they were each nuclease-free, and we then examined the biochemical properties of different combinations of Mcm subunits. We found that Mcm4 and Mcm7 form an active unwinding assembly. The addition of Mcm6 to Mcm4/Mcm7 results in the formation of an active Mcm4/Mcm6/Mcm7 helicase assembly. The Mcm4-Mcm7 complex forms a ringed-shaped hexamer that unwinds DNA with 3′ to 5′ polarity by a steric exclusion mechanism, similar to Mcm4/Mcm6/Mcm7. The Mcm4-Mcm7 complex has a high level of ATPase activity that is further stimulated by DNA. The ability of different Mcm mixtures to form rings or exhibit DNA stimulation of ATPase activity correlates with the ability of these complexes to unwind DNA. The Mcm4/Mcm7 and Mcm4/Mcm6/Mcm7 assemblies can open to load onto circular DNA to initiate unwinding.

Investigations of ring-shaped helicases have been primarily focused on homohexameric assemblies (1Singleton M. Dillingham M. Wigley D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 23-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar, 2Patel S.S. Picha K.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 651-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 38Iyer L. Leipe D. Koonin E. Avardind L. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic Mcms are somewhat unusual in this regard, because they form heterohexamers. It is currently not known how the different eukaryotic Mcm subunits function in coordination to unwind DNA, and a comprehensive study of how individual Mcm subunit biochemical activities relate to unwinding activity has not been accomplished. Study of the eukaryotic Mcms may reveal insight into how specific components of a hexameric helicase contribute to form an active unwinding assembly. The Mcm4-Mcm6-Mcm7 complex is a useful model system in this regard, because the complex purified from recombinant proteins is active as a helicase in vitro. In the past, Mcm4-Mcm6-Mcm7 was purified as a pre-assembled complex from partially purified subunits, because Mcm4, Mcm6, and Mcm7 subunits were not pure enough to allow for direct study with DNA (33Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 36Lee J.-K. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this study, the production of highly purified, nuclease-free individual Mcm subunits is used to study how each Mcm subunit contributes to DNA unwinding. We find that the combination of individually purified Mcm4 and Mcm7 subunits results in a complex that can unwind DNA. Incubation of Mcm6 with Mcm4/Mcm7 results in the formation of an active Mcm4/Mcm6/Mcm7 helicase assembly. Mcm4/Mcm7 forms ring-shaped particles that are likely to be hexameric, and Mcm4/Mcm7 unwinds DNA with 3′ to 5′ polarity in a manner that is consistent with a steric exclusion model. The Mcm4/Mcm7 and the Mcm4/Mcm6/Mcm7 rings spontaneously open to load onto circular ssDNA and unwind an annealed oligonucleotide. The ability of different Mcm mixtures to form ring shapes and exhibit DNA stimulation of ATPase activity correlates well with the ability of these Mcm mixtures to unwind DNA. We conclude that Mcm subunits are surprisingly flexible and dynamic in their ability to form active unwinding complexes. Cloning and Purification of Mcm4, Mcm6, and Mcm7—The full-length open reading frame of S. cerevisiae Mcm4 was cloned into the NdeI/BamHI sites of the pET-28 vector (EMD Biosciences). The Mcm4-pET-28 vector was transformed into Escherichia coli BL-21 DE3 Codon Plus cells (Stratagene), and a colony from the transformation was inoculated into 60 liters of LB containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin. When the cells reached an A600 of 0.6, 0.7 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added, and the temperature was lowered to 12 °C. 16 h later, cells were harvested and lysed by French press in 500 ml of solution containing 10% sucrose, 3.5 g of spermidine, 500 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The lysate was applied to a 40-ml chelating Sepharose fast flow resin (GE Healthcare) precharged with nickel sulfate. The column was washed with solution containing 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 50 mm imidazole. The Mcm4 protein was eluted in solution containing 10% glycerol, 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 250 mm imidazole, dialyzed into Buffer H (10% glycerol, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT) containing 50 mm NaCl, and applied to a 30-ml SP-Sepharose column. The SP column was washed with Buffer H containing 100 mm NaCl, and Mcm4 was eluted in a 300-ml linear gradient from Buffer H containing 100 mm NaCl to Buffer H containing 500 mm NaCl. Peak fractions containing Mcm4 were combined and precipitated with 0.3 g/ml ammonium sulfate, and the pellet was resuspended in 22 ml of Buffer H + 500 mm NaCl. 5 ml of this sample containing 22.5 mg of protein was applied to a 124-ml Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) that was pre-equilibrated in Buffer H + 500 mm NaCl. Peak fractions containing Mcm4 were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer A (10% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT) containing 50 mm NaCl and 10 mm magnesium chloride. The sample was applied to an ssDNA-cellulose resin, and the flow-through containing Mcm4 was flash-frozen. Purification of Mcm6 was identical to the procedure followed previously (27Davey M.J. Indiani C. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4491-4499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), except the Mcm6 sample was further purified. The Mcm6 sample was subjected to preparative size-exclusion chromatography with a 124-ml Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) that was pre-equilibrated in Buffer A + 500 mm NaCl. Peak fractions containing Mcm6 were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer A containing 50 mm NaCl and 10 mm magnesium chloride. The sample was then applied to an ssDNA-cellulose resin, and the flow-through containing Mcm6 was flash-frozen. Purification of Mcm7 was identical to the procedure followed previously (35Kaplan D.L. Davey M.J. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49171-49182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), except the Mcm7 sample was further purified. The Mcm7 sample was subjected to preparative size-exclusion chromatography with a 124-ml Superdex 200 column that was pre-equilibrated in Buffer A + 500 mm NaCl. Peak fractions containing Mcm7 were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer A containing 50 mm NaCl and 10 mm magnesium chloride. The sample was then applied to an ssDNA-cellulose resin, and the flow-through containing Mcm7 was flash-frozen. Radiolabeling and Annealing DNA—DNA was end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To anneal DNA, 500 nm radiolabeled DNA was incubated overnight at 37 °C with 1 μm complementary DNA in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 4% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm DTT, and 5 mm magnesium acetate in a final volume of 12 μl. Following the overnight incubation, the reaction was diluted to a final concentration of 50 nm (concentration of radiolabeled DNA) with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA. Helicase Assay—Each unwinding reaction contained 25.4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 9.9 mm magnesium acetate, 23.3% glycerol, 152 μm EDTA, 42.4 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5.01 mm DTT, 4.98 mm ATP, 4.98 mm creatine phosphate, 19.9 μg/ml creatine kinase, 1.2 nm32P-labeled DNA, and proteins as detailed in each figure legend, in a final volume of 11 μl. Unless otherwise indicated, the final concentration of each Mcm subunit was 709 nm, expressed as a monomer (850 ng of Mcm4, 897 ng of Mcm6, and 750 ng of Mcm7). When UvrD was used as a control, the final concentration was 3.7 μg/ml, or 45 nm monomer. All reaction samples were prepared on ice, and shifted to 37 °C to initiate the reaction. At the end of the reaction, 1 μl of proteinase K (10 mg/ml) was added, and the sample was incubated an additional 1 min at 37 °C. 5 μl of stop solution (2% SDS, 80 mm EDTA) was added, followed by 5 μl of 6× loading dye (15% Ficoll + 0.1% xylene cyanol), and finally the reaction was flash-frozen. For DNA containing a biotin moiety, 100 nm streptavidin was preincubated with the DNA prior to adding Mcm proteins. For experiments containing T4 gp32, 26 ng (73 nm) of T4 gp32 (New England Biolabs) was preincubated with the DNA prior to adding the Mcm proteins. For experiments with oligonucleotide substrates, samples were analyzed by an 8% native polyacrylamide gel containing 1× TBE (90 mm Tris-HCl borate, 2 mm EDTA) at 225 V. The gel was dried for 2 h at 60 °C and exposed to a phosphorimaging screen overnight. For experiments with M13 circular ssDNA substrates, samples were analyzed by a 1% native agarose gel containing 1× TBE at 100 V. The gel was dried for 2 h at 60 °C and exposed to a phosphorimaging screen overnight. Analytical Size-exclusion Chromatography—Mcm4, Mcm6, and/or Mcm7 in a total volume of 400 μl were incubated at 15 °C for 30 min. For single subunit experiments, 400 μg of each subunit was analyzed (9.17 μm Mcm4 monomer, 8.69 μm Mcm6 monomer, or 10.5 μm Mcm7 monomer); for the binary complex, 350 μg of Mcm4 and 400 μg of Mcm7 were analyzed (8.02 μm Mcm4 monomer and 10.5 μm Mcm7 monomer); and for the ternary complex, 300 μg of Mcm4, 300 μg of Mcm6, and 400 μg of Mcm7 were analyzed (6.88 μm Mcm4 monomer, 6.52 μm Mcm6 monomer, and 5.26 μm Mcm7 monomer). The samples were applied to a 24-ml Superose 6 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated in Buffer A + 150 mm NaCl. 250-μl fractions from the column were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. The elution peaks of molecular weight standards were determined under the same conditions. 5 μl of each fraction of the elution was further analyzed for helicase activity. Electron Microscopy—Samples for electron microscopy contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 μm DTT, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm ATP, and Mcm proteins, each at a concentration of 709 nm (monomer), which is 77.3 μg/ml Mcm4, 81.5 μg/ml Mcm6, and 67.4 μg/ml Mcm7. The sample was allowed to incubate at 37 °C for 16 min. For samples containing glutaraldehyde, 0.04% glutaraldehyde was added after the initial incubation, and the sample was incubated at 37 °C for an additional 30 s as described previously (41Crampton D. Ohi M. Qimron U. Walz T. Richardson C. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 667-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The reaction was quenched by the addition of 50 mm EDTA. The reactions were kept on ice until they could be fixed by negative staining. After 100-fold dilution into helicase reaction buffer, 20 μl of sample was applied to a copper mesh 300 grid for 30 s and wicked away, and 20 μl of 1% uranyl acetate was applied to the grid for 30 s and then wicked away. Images were taken with a Philips CM-12 transmission electron microscope at a voltage of 80 kV with a magnification of ×140,000. Scion Image software was used to create an average of selected images. Scion Image was also used to measure the outer distance of the observed ring particles. ATP Hydrolysis Assay—The ATP hydrolysis assay in a total volume of 11 μl contained 25.4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 9.9 mm magnesium acetate, 23.3% glycerol, 152 μm EDTA, 42.4 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 4.98 mm DTT, 4.98 mm ATP, 0.73 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences BLU002Z00), and 709 nm (monomer) of each Mcm subunit (850 ng of Mcm4, 897 ng of Mcm6, and/or 750 ng of Mcm7). The samples were incubated at 37 °C, and 2 μl were removed at 0-, 5-, 10-, and 30-min intervals. The reaction was quenched with 2 μl of stop solution (2% SDS, 80 mm EDTA), and then 1 μl of each sample was spotted on thin layer chromatography plates (PEI-Cellulose F, EMD Chemicals, Inc.) Each TLC plate was developed in 1 m formic acid and 0.5 m LiCl. The plates were allowed to dry and exposed to phosphorimaging cassettes for 30 min. For reactions containing DNA, 1 μm of a 60(dT) oligomer was added to the reaction. Mcm4 and Mcm7 Form an Active Helicase Assembly—Previously, the Mcm4-Mcm6-Mcm7 complex was studied by purification of the intact hexameric assembly (29Lee J.-K. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18871-18878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 35Kaplan D.L. Davey M.J. O'Donnell M. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6148-6160Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To study how the individual subunits assemble to form a functional helicase, we improved the production and purification of individual Mcm subunits, and SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified subunits is shown (Fig. 1A). The new preparations of Mcm subunits were incubated with one another and examined for helicase activity (Fig. 1, B and C). The DNA substrate used in this unwinding assay is duplex DNA bearing a single strand extension at a 3′ end and a biotin-streptavidin group attached to the 5′ end. The 3′-single strand extension serves as a loading strand for the helicase, whereas the biotin-streptavidin is a bulky group that blocks helicase translocation along dsDNA. Previously, only the Mcm4-Mcm6-Mcm7 complex has been shown to unwind DNA, and we fully expected helicase activity to require the presence all three Mcm subunits. When studied alone, Mcm6 or Mcm7 exhibited practically no unwinding activity (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6, and Fig. 1C), whereas Mcm4 exhibited very weak activity (Fig. 1B, lane 4, and Fig. 1C). We then mixed the proteins in binary combinations to study if any of these complexes exhibit unwinding function. Surprisingly, Mcm4 in combination with Mcm7 exhibited helicase activity (Fig. 1B, lane 8, and Fig. 1C). In contrast, no unwinding was observed when Mcm4 was mixed with Mcm6 or Mcm6 was mixed with Mcm7 (Fig. 1B, lanes 7 and 9, and Fig. 1C). These results suggest that Mcm4 and Mcm7 can assemble to form an active, multimeric helicase complex. Furthermore, the concentration of Mcm4/Mcm7 used in our assays (77.3 μg/ml Mcm4 and 67.4 μg/ml Mcm7) is likely to be physiologic, because even higher concentrations of Mcm4 and Mcm7 (344 ng/μl) are present in yeast cells (9Donovan S. Harwood J. Drury L. Diffley J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5611-5616Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 44Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Young M. Kihara M. Sugino A. Tye B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3365-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The addition of Mcm6 to Mcm4 and Mcm7 resulted in a slight increase in activity compared with Mcm4 with Mcm7 (Fig. 1B, lane 10, and Fig. 1C). We next analyzed the time course of Mcm helicase action (Fig. 1, D and E). As expected from our previous observations, Mcm4 added to Mcm7 resulted in an active unwinding complex. We also added Mcm6 to Mcm4 and Mcm7 to determine the effect on helicase action. The addition of Mcm6 to Mcm4 and Mcm7 resulted in a slight increase in the unwinding rate compared with Mcm4 with Mcm7 (Fig. 1E, compare filled diamonds with open squares). Thus, we can recapitulate the observation that Mcm4/Mcm6/Mcm7 is an active helicase by adding the three individual components together and incubating them directly with DNA. Surprisingly, the Mcm4/Mcm7 mixture is nearly as active as Mcm4/Mcm6/Mcm7. The observation that DNA is unwound by Mcm4 in combination with Mcm7 suggests that the two proteins are functioning as a helicase complex. An important characteristic of an active helicase is the hydrolysis of a nucleotide triphosphate to power DNA unwinding. To test if unwinding of DNA by the Mcm4 and Mcm7 proteins is dependent upon ATP hydrolysis, the unwinding reaction was performed in the presence of different nucleotide analogs (Fig. 1F). Mcm4 in combination with Mcm7 unwound DNA in the presence of ATP but not in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable analog AMP-PNP. Furthermore, no unwinding was observed in the presence of ADP or in the absence of nucleotide. These data demonstrate that the Mcm4 and Mcm7 proteins require a hydrolyzable nucleotide triphosphate to unwind DNA. Mcm4 and Mcm7 Assemble to Form a Hexameric Helicase Complex—We next isolated an active Mcm4-Mcm7 complex by size-exclusion chromatography to approximate the size of the helicase assembly (Fig. 2, A and B). Mcm4 alone, Mcm6 alone, or Mcm7 alone had a peak elution consistent with a subunit monomer or dimer (Fig. 2A). When Mcm4 and Mcm7 were mixed together and then subjected to size-exclusion chromatography, there was a peak elution of Mcm4/Mcm7 at a Stokes radius that matched that of thyroglobulin, a 669-kDa protein (Fig. 2A). Fractions from the Mcm4/Mcm7 size-exclusion fractions were then analyzed for unwinding activity using a DNA substrate bearing a 3′-ssDNA extension and a 5′-biotin-streptavidin (Fig. 2B). Peak unwinding activity was observed at an elution volume that is consistent with a single hexamer of Mcm4/Mcm7 (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that a single hexamer of Mcm4/Mcm7 functions as a helicase. When mouse or Schizosaccharomyces pombe Mcm4/Mcm6/Mcm7 is copurified as a pre-assembled complex, an Mcm hexamer containing all three subunits is active as a helicase (29Lee J.-K. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18871-18878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 33Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). To determine whether mixing S. cerevisiae Mcm6 with Mcm4 and Mcm7 results in the formation of a hexameric helicase assembly containing all three Mcm subunits, we subjected the Mcm4/Mcm6/Mcm7 mixture to size-exclusion chromatography analysis (Fig. 2, A and C). The proteins eluted as a complex containing all three Mcm subunits (Fig. 2A). The elution volume of the assembly exhibited an activity peak that matched that of thyroglobulin (Fig. 2C), suggesting that mixing the three Mcm subunits results in a single hexameric helicase assembly that contains all three subunits. To study how rapidly the Mcm4 and Mcm7 proteins interact with one another to form an active helicase complex, we next studied how preincubating the Mcm subunits with one another affects the unwinding rate (Fig. 2, D and E). In this experiment, Mcm4 was preincubated with Mcm7 for varying times to allow the formation of an active complex. The Mcm4-Mcm7 complex was then incubated with radiolabeled DNA substrate, and the fraction of unwound DNA was determined by native gel electrophoresis. As the preincubation time varied from 0 to 90 min, the fraction of unwound DNA product did not change (Fig. 2, D and E). Thus, Mcm4 assembles with Mcm7 rapidly relative to the unwinding time, and extended preincubation does not further promote complex formation. We next studied how rapidly Mcm6 interacts with Mcm4/Mcm7 to form an Mcm4-Mcm6-Mcm7 complex (Fig. 2F). First, Mcm4 was mixed with Mcm7 to form Mcm4/Mcm7. Mcm6 was then preincubated with Mcm4/Mcm7 for varying times to allow for the formation of a ternary complex. The proteins were then incubated with DNA substrate for 16 min, and DNA unwinding was monitored. The data indicate that the fraction of unwound DNA did not vary as a function of preincubation time (Fig. 2F). Furthermore, at every time point, the unwinding percentage was significantly greater than in a control experiment, in which buffer was added instead of Mcm6. Therefore, the addition of Mcm6 to Mcm4/Mcm7 results in the rapid formation of an active Mcm4-Mcm6-Mcm7 complex. Mcm4/Mcm7 Unwinds DNA with 3′ to 5′ Polarity by a Steric Exclusion Mechanism—We next characterized how Mcm4/Mcm7 unwinds various DNA substrates to gain insight into its mechanism of action (Fig. 3A). It was previously observed that th"
https://openalex.org/W2089285040,"Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) plays a central role in tissue remodeling processes. Most of our understanding of the role of uPA in vivo is derived from studies using genetargeted uPA-deficient mice. To enable in vivo studies on the specific interference with uPA functionality in mouse models, we have now developed murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against murine uPA by immunization of uPA-deficient mice with the recombinant protein. Guided by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blotting, surface plasmon resonance, and enzyme kinetic analyses, we have selected two highly potent and inhibitory anti-uPA mAbs (mU1 and mU3). Both mAbs recognize epitopes located on the B-chain of uPA that encompasses the catalytic site. In enzyme activity assays in vitro, mU1 blocked uPA-catalyzed plasminogen activation as well as plasmin-mediated pro-uPA activation, whereas mU3 only was directed against the first of these reactions. We additionally provide evidence that mU1, but not mU3, successfully targets uPA-dependent processes in vivo. Hence, systemic administration of mU1 (i) rescued mice treated with a uPA-activable anthrax protoxin and (ii) impaired uPA-mediated hepatic fibrinolysis in tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA)-deficient mice, resulting in a phenotype mimicking that of uPA;tPA double deficient mice. Importantly, this is the first report demonstrating specific antagonist-directed targeting of mouse uPA at the enzyme activity level in a normal physiological process in vivo. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) plays a central role in tissue remodeling processes. Most of our understanding of the role of uPA in vivo is derived from studies using genetargeted uPA-deficient mice. To enable in vivo studies on the specific interference with uPA functionality in mouse models, we have now developed murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against murine uPA by immunization of uPA-deficient mice with the recombinant protein. Guided by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blotting, surface plasmon resonance, and enzyme kinetic analyses, we have selected two highly potent and inhibitory anti-uPA mAbs (mU1 and mU3). Both mAbs recognize epitopes located on the B-chain of uPA that encompasses the catalytic site. In enzyme activity assays in vitro, mU1 blocked uPA-catalyzed plasminogen activation as well as plasmin-mediated pro-uPA activation, whereas mU3 only was directed against the first of these reactions. We additionally provide evidence that mU1, but not mU3, successfully targets uPA-dependent processes in vivo. Hence, systemic administration of mU1 (i) rescued mice treated with a uPA-activable anthrax protoxin and (ii) impaired uPA-mediated hepatic fibrinolysis in tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA)-deficient mice, resulting in a phenotype mimicking that of uPA;tPA double deficient mice. Importantly, this is the first report demonstrating specific antagonist-directed targeting of mouse uPA at the enzyme activity level in a normal physiological process in vivo. Tissue remodeling and cell migration are dependent on the confined degradation of proteins in the extracellular matrix and basement membranes, which is accomplished by the concerted action of several proteolytic enzymes, including those of the plasminogen activation and the matrix metalloproteinase systems (1Danø K.

The two main proteases accomplishing plasminogen activation, i.e. conversion of plasminogen to the active broad spectrum serine protease plasmin, are urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) 2The abbreviations used are: uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; tPA, tissue-type plasminogen activator; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; uPAR, uPA receptor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ATF, aminoterminal fragment of uPA; LMW-uPA, low molecular weight uPA; PrAg-U2, uPA-activable anthrax toxin-protective antigen-U2; FP59, fusion protein 59; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TNP, trinitrophenyl; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; MSV, mouse sarcoma virus. 2The abbreviations used are: uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; tPA, tissue-type plasminogen activator; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; uPAR, uPA receptor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ATF, aminoterminal fragment of uPA; LMW-uPA, low molecular weight uPA; PrAg-U2, uPA-activable anthrax toxin-protective antigen-U2; FP59, fusion protein 59; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TNP, trinitrophenyl; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; MSV, mouse sarcoma virus. and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA). At the molecular level, uPA is secreted as an inactive single-chain protein, pro-uPA, which becomes activated by proteolytic cleavage believed to be primarily performed by plasmin (3Ellis V.

Chem. 1988; 263: 11189-11195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The simultaneously occurring reciprocal zymogen activation reactions, composed of pro-uPA activation by plasmin and plasminogen activation by uPA, constitute a positive feedback mechanism, which is regulated at several levels. The naturally occurring inhibitors include serpins and in particular the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) for uPA and α2-antiplasmin for plasmin (1Danø K. Behrendt N. Høyer-Hansen G. Johnsen M. Lund L.R. Ploug M. Rømer J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2005; 93: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Although the plasminogen activation processes can be focused to the cell surface by the uPA receptor (uPAR) and plasminogen-binding proteins (5Ellis V. Behrendt N. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12752-12758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), additional functions of uPA seem to rely on a multifaceted array of interactions with cellular receptors, adhesion molecules, and extracellular matrix proteins (6Andreasen P.A. Egelund R. Petersen H.H. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). A key role for uPA-mediated plasminogen activation has been suggested in tissue remodeling processes and decisively demonstrated by studies of skin wound healing (7Lund L.R. Green K.A. Stoop A.A.

BioEssays. 2005; 27: 894-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) in gene-targeted knockout mice. The primary functions of the counterpart of uPA, tPA, have traditionally been associated with intravascular fibrinolysis through a preferential induction of plasminogen activation upon simultaneous association of tPA and plasminogen with fibrin (12Collen D.

However, despite the apparent differences in their basic biological functions, functional redundancy between uPA and tPA has been demonstrated in various physiological settings using gene-deficient mice. Hence abolishment of single components of the plasminogen activation system, i.e. uPA (13Carmeliet P. Schoonjans L. Kieckens L. Ream B. Degen J. Bronson R. De Vos R. van den Oord J.J. Collen D.

In contrast, mice with combined deficiency in uPA and tPA are characterized by retarded growth, reduced fertility, and shortened life span (13Carmeliet P. Schoonjans L. Kieckens L. Ream B. Degen J.

Moreover whereas a modest but definite delay in incisional skin wound healing is observed in mice with single deficiency in uPA, the concomitant ablation of both of the plasminogen activator genes significantly retarded the healing process (7Lund L.R. Green K.A. Stoop A.A. Ploug M. Almholt K. Lilla J. Nielsen B.S. Christensen I.J. Craik C.S. Werb Z. Danø K. Rømer J.

Detailed studies on hepatic fibrinolysis in gene-deficient mice have in addition revealed extensive fibrin accumulations in uPA;tPA and uPAR;tPA double deficient mice with characteristics resembling those observed in plasminogen-deficient mice (8Bugge T.H.

Among the single deficient mice, only the uPA knock-out mice developed detectable hepatic fibrin plaques and only occasionally (8Bugge T.H. Flick M.J. Danton M.J. Daugherty C.C. Rømer J. Danø K.

These results strongly argue that a complex pattern of redundancies exists between uPA and tPA. Consequently increasing attention has been drawn to the physiological impact of uPA-induced effects mediated independently of both tPA and of its receptor, uPAR (8Bugge T.H. Flick M.J. Danton M.J. Daugherty C.C. Rømer J. Danø K. Carmeliet P. Collen D. Degen J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5899-5904Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 17Shanmukhappa K. Sabla G.E.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Taken together, the multitude of protease interaction pathways and the potential redundancy both between the plasminogen activators and with other extracellular proteases (such as the matrix metalloproteinases) require further investigations of the roles of uPA in mouse models. A number of pathological conditions, including cancer invasion and metastasis, have mechanistic similarities to normal physiological tissue remodeling processes, and several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that plasminogen activation mediated by uPA is a key regulatory step in these proteolytic events (1Danø K. Behrendt N. Høyer-Hansen G. Johnsen M. Lund L.R. Ploug M. Rømer J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2005; 93: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 6Andreasen P.A. Egelund R. Petersen H.H. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). As the majority of the in vivo investigations concerning uPA have used antagonists directed against the human form of uPA without cross-reactivity to murine uPA (for a review, see Ref. 19Schmitt M. Harbeck N. Thomssen C. Wilhelm O. Magdolen V. Reuning U. Ulm K. Höfler H. Jänicke F. Graeff H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), there is thus a strong need for inhibitors of mouse uPA with applicability in vivo. To be able to investigate uPA-mediated effects in diverse physiological settings, we have now generated murine inhibitory monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against mouse uPA. Such murine uPA antagonists allow for analysis of the in vivo effects on uPA functionality in a range of murine models. In the present study, we performed a detailed biochemical and functional characterization of two murine anti-mouse uPA mAbs possessing epitopes located on the B-chain of uPA and having different mechanisms of action on uPA functionality. The in vivo efficacy of each antibody was tested by systemic administration to mice treated with a modified anthrax protoxin, requiring uPA-mediated activation, and the most potent mAb was further used for investigation of the physiological effect of acute disruption of uPA activity in adult mice. Recombinant proteins were produced by use of a Drosophila Expression System (Invitrogen). The construction of appropriate expression vectors, subsequent stable transfection into Drosophila S2 cells, and large scale production and purification have been described in detail previously (20Gårdsvoll H.

Two preparations containing either (i) active murine uPA alone or (ii) murine pro-uPA/uPA together with the corresponding proteolytic cleavage products, i.e. ATF and low molecular weight (LMW)-uPA, were produced by purification of medium collected from a subline of cultured mouse sarcoma virus-infected 3T3 cells (i.e. 3T3/MSV-LO) as described previously (22Danø K. Moller V. Ossowski L. Nielsen L.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 613: 542-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The following proteins were purchased from the commercial sources indicated: human Glu-plasminogen and plasmin (Kordia Life Sciences, Leiden, the Netherlands) and murine tPA, PAI-1, two-chain uPA, and LMW-uPA (Molecular Innovations, Novi, MI). The chromogenic substrates S2251 and S2444 were purchased from Chromogenix (Hemochrom Diagnostica AB, Mölndal, Sweden). The uPA-activable anthrax toxin-protective antigen-U2 (PrAg-U2) and the cytotoxic fusion protein 59 (FP59), consisting of the anthrax toxin lethal factor residues 1–254 fused to the ADP-ribosylation domain of Pseudomonas exotoxin A, were kind gifts from Dr. S. Liu and Dr. S.H. Leppla, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. Breeding of mice of different genotypes and strains (specified below under “Experimental Procedures”), including backcrossing to the indicated background and interbreeding to obtain single and double deficient mice as well as wild-type littermates, were performed as described previously (8Bugge T.H.

The animal experiments in this study were conducted according to institutional guidelines and were approved by the Danish Animal Experiments Inspectorate (2007/561-1353). All mice were found to be free of specified murine pathogens in accordance with the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations recommendations for health monitoring of experimental units. Mice used for experiments were between 6 and 7 weeks old at the start of the experiment. Experimental evaluation, tissue isolation, and microscopic analyses were performed by investigators unaware of the mouse genotype and treatment. Female FVB/n mice deficient in uPA (13Carmeliet P.

Mice were injected intraperitoneally at least six times with 2-week intervals followed by 3 days of daily boosts just prior to the day of the cell fusion. 25 μg of recombinant mouse pro-uPA was administered in each injection either diluted in 0.3 ml of isotonic NaCl with 2 mg/ml Al(OH)3 for standard immunizations or in 0.3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2, for boosting injections. The techniques for isolation of peritoneal macrophages from non-immunized mice and preparation of splenocytes from the immunized mice as well as the subsequent fusion between splenocytes and X63-Ag8.653 murine myeloma cells were performed as described previously (21Pass J.

Hybridomas producing antibodies specific for mouse uPA were cloned by limited dilution. The subtypes of the mAbs were determined by the mouse mAb isotype kit (AbD Serotec, Düsseldorf, Germany).

The initial screening for hybridomas producing antibodies against mouse uPA was performed by ELISA essentially as described previously (21Pass J. Jögi A. Lund I.K. Rønø B. Rasch M.G. Gårdsvoll H.

A preparation of eye blood serum (diluted 1:2000 in assay buffer, i.e. 50 mm sodium/potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) from two immunized mice was used as positive control; uncoated plates were included as a control for unspecific binding. Absorbance was measured at 490 nm in a SpectraMax Plus384 microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) with background subtraction (absorbance at 540 nm recorded simultaneously). SPR analyses on a BIAcore 2000™ instrument (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden) were used to (i) perform a secondary screening of the ELISA-positive samples for hybridomas secreting antibodies recognizing uPA, (ii) analyze the gross location of binding sites of the purified anti-uPA mAbs on mouse uPA, and (iii) measure the binding and dissociation rate constants for determination of the equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) of the uPA-antibody interactions. For these experiments, the indicated proteins were dissolved in coupling buffer (10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0) and immobilized on CM5-type sensor chips by amine coupling according to the manufacturer's instructions. Screening of hybridomas was performed by injection of conditioned medium from which cell debris had been removed by a 15-min centrifugation at 20,000 × g. Binding and dissociation were followed essentially as described previously (21Pass J. Jögi A. Lund I.K. Rønø B. Rasch M.G. Gårdsvoll H. Lund L.R. Ploug M. Rømer J. Danø K. Høyer-Hansen G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2007; 97: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) except that the immobilized proteins were mouse and human pro-uPA and a rabbit anti-mouse Fcγ antibody (BIAcore). Analyses of uPA binding sites and mutual exclusion of binding on uPA of the purified mAbs (see “Results”) were performed by immobilization of uPAR or the mAb in question on the chip and injection of 100 nm pro-uPA followed by an injection of an equimolar amount of uPAR or each of the anti-uPA mAbs. For affinity determinations, each mAb was immobilized at a low density (mU1, 406–2281 resonance units; mU3, 500–1582 resonance units), and a 2-fold dilution series of murine pro-uPA or two-chain uPA was injected (0.4–100 nm) at a flow rate of 50 μl/min at 20 °C. Sensorgrams, obtained from a parallel mock-coupled flow cell as well as appropriate buffer runs, served as blanks allowing subtraction of the bulk. Data were analyzed using the BIAevaluation software, version 3.2 RC1 (BIAcore). The association and dissociation rate constants were calculated by local fitting of the obtained binding curves to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model to allow determination of the KD of the interactions. The antigens used in Western blotting were human pro-uPA and the murine proteins pro-uPA, two-chain uPA, LMW-uPA, ATF, tPA, and uPA·PAI-1 complexes (prepared by mixing uPA with a 30-fold excess of PAI-1 overnight at 4 °C) as well as the partially degraded uPA preparation containing pro-uPA/uPA, ATF, and LMW-uPA (described above). Electrophoretic separation by SDS-PAGE was performed under non-reducing conditions when not stated otherwise, and Western blotting was performed as described previously (21Pass J. Jögi A. Lund I.K.

When reduced and alkylated uPA was probed, 20 μg/ml purified mAb was used. As a positive control, a preparation of eye blood serum from two immunized mice, diluted 1:30,000 in assay buffer (Tris-buffered saline containing 2% (w/v) skimmed milk powder), was applied. Measurement of the uPA-uPAR interaction on the surface of murine monocyte macrophage-like cells (P388D.1, ATCC TIB-63) was performed as described previously (21Pass J. Jögi A. Lund I.K. Rønø B.

The reported standard deviation values are calculated from at least three independent experiments. Three different experimental settings were used to evaluate mAb-induced effects on mouse uPA: (i) uPA-mediated plasminogen activation, (ii) plasmin-mediated pro-uPA activation, and (iii) coupled pro-uPA and plasminogen activation. The kinetic assays were performed and presented accordingly to Behrendt et al. (40Behrendt N. List K. Andreasen P.A. Danø K. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) except for the changes specified below. The components indicated below were mixed in assay buffer (0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 80; final volume of 100 μl/well). The reactions, performed at 37 °C, were initiated by addition of substrate and plasmin(ogen) as the final components (t = 0 min), and substrate conversion was followed by recording the absorbance at 405 nm for up to 30 min in a SpectraMax Plus384 microplate spectrophotometer. Each curve depicts percent activity with 100% representing the activity of the protease (plasmin or uPA) in the absence of inhibitor at the assay end point. As negative controls, samples prepared by excluding (pro-)uPA, plasmin(ogen), or substrate were run in parallel and showed no activity. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). uPA-mediated Plasminogen Activation—0.6 nm mouse uPA, 100 nm human Glu-plasminogen, and 0.8 mm chromogenic plasmin substrate H-d-Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroanilide (S2251) were incubated in the absence or presence of the indicated concentrations of the antibodies (mU1, mU3, and anti-TNP) or other inhibitors as indicated. Plasmin-mediated Pro-uPA Activation—1.6 nm mouse pro-uPA, 0.5 nm human plasmin, and 0.8 mm chromogenic uPA substrate pyro-Glu-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide (S2444) were incubated in the absence or presence of 0.03–67 nm mU1, 2–333 nm mU3, 67 nm anti-TNP, or other inhibitors as indicated. The same substrate was used in a variant of this assay analyzing the effect of the antibodies against the amidolytic activity of preactivated uPA. These measurements were performed by mixing 0.5 nm mouse two-chain uPA with 0.8 mm S2444 in the presence or absence of 10 nm mU1, mU3, or PAI-1. Coupled Pro-uPA and Plasminogen Activation—0.5 nm mouse pro-uPA, 20 nm human Glu-plasminogen, and 0.8 mm S2251 were incubated in the absence or presence of the indicated concentrations of mU1, mU3, or anti-TNP. The uPA inhibitors PAI-1 (0.03–67 nm) and amiloride (0.20–200 μm) as well as the plasmin inhibitors α2-antiplasmin (1–67 nm) and aprotinin (2–134 nm) were included as controls in the assays where indicated. Female C57Bl/6J mice (n = 6) received either 20 mg/kg mU1 or 60 mg/kg mU3, diluted in PBS, by intraperitoneal injections. Citrate plasma samples were made from tail vein blood, which was taken before dosing as well as 8–120 h after injections of the mAbs. The plasma concentrations of the mAbs were analyzed by ELISA as described above, except that coating was increased to 4 ng of mouse pro-uPA/well. The half-lives of the mAbs were calculated from the logarithmic value of the antibody concentrations during the linear elimination phase. Cytotoxicity assays in vitro were performed using the murine monocyte macrophage-like P388D.1 cells and were carried out as described previously (21Pass J. Jögi A. Lund I.K. Rønø B. Rasch M.G.

We sought to quantify the numbers of apoptotic progenitors in patients with congestive heart failure. Methods and Results Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll density-gradient from 58 patients with various degrees of heart failure and 23 matched controls. Apoptosis in progenitor CD34+ cells was assessed using the Annexin V-PE/PI detection kit, and FACS analysis was performed with triple staining for CD34, annexin-V and propidium iodide. The percentage of early and late apoptotic progenitor cells was determined in the subject groups and was correlated with clinical characteristics. While there was no significant difference in total CD34 positive cells or early apoptotic progenitors between control subjects and CHF patients (p = 0.42) or between severe and mild/moderate CHF groups (p = 0.544), there was an elevated number of late apoptotic progenitors in the severe CHF group compared with the mild/moderate CHF group (p = 0.03). Late apoptotic progenitors were significantly increased in CHF patients as compared to matched controls. There was also an inverse correlation between late apoptotic progenitors and ejection fraction (r = −0.252, p = 0.028) as well as a positive association with NYHA class (r = 0.223, p = 0.046). Conclusion Severe heart failure patients exhibited higher numbers of late apoptotic progenitors, and this was positively associated with NYHA class and negatively correlated with ejection fraction. This finding may shed light on the numerous factors governing the pathophysiology of CHF."

It consists, in the species Crithidia fasciculata, of ∼5,000 duplex DNA minicircles of 2.5 kbp and ∼50 maxicircles of 37 kbp that are interlocked topologically to form a DNA network. Two short sequences, the dodecameric universal minicircle sequence (UMS), GGGGTTGGTGTA, and the hexameric sequence ACGCCC, which were located at the minicircle's replication origin and implicated with its replication initiation, were conserved in all trypanosomatid species studied (recently reviewed in Refs. 1Liu B.

RNA interference analysis has recently revealed the function of UMSBP in minicircle replication initiation and in kDNA segregation, as well as in nuclear mitosis, implying a potential role for UMSBP in linking kDNA replication and segregation to nuclear M phase control during the trypanosome cell cycle (11Milman N.

UMSBP contains five CCHC-type zinc finger domains (5Abeliovich H. Tzfati Y. Shlomai J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 7766-7773Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which differ in their function. Although the C-terminal zinc fingers mediate its DNA binding activity, the N-terminal zinc finger is involved in protein-protein interactions that lead to the protein oligomerization (12Onn I. Milman-Shtepel N. Shlomai J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). 3I. Onn and J. Shlomai, unpublished observations. The active conformation of the zinc finger motif contains a zinc ion, bound through coordinative bonds with the cysteines and histidine residues. This structure is redox-sensitive, probably since oxidation of the thiol groups in cysteine residues enhances the ejection of the zinc ion, resulting in a conformational change, which impairs the protein binding to the DNA (13Baldwin M.A. Benz C.C. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 353: 54-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Its high sensitivity to redox changes raised the possibility that the zinc finger motif could function as a “redox switch” in the regulation of cellular processes (14Ilbert M. Graf P.C. Jakob U. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2006; 8: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 15Ilbert M. Horst J. Ahrens S. Winter J. Graf P.C. Lilie H. Jakob U. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 556-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). It has been shown that activities of several DNA binding proteins, containing zinc fingers, are controlled by redox (16Hainaut P.

Several proteins were found to be reduced by the enzyme thioredoxin, either directly or via redox factor-1/apurinic-apyrimidinic endonuclease xth (Ref-1/APEX), which in turn reduces the target proteins (reviewed in Refs. 19Nishinaka Y. Masutani H. Nakamura H. Yodoi J. Redox Rep. 2001; 6: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar and 20Tanaka T. Nakamura H. Nishiyama A. Hosoi F. Masutani H. Wada H. Yodoi J. Free Radic. Res. 2000; 33: 851-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The catalytic thiol-protein oxidoreductase (TPOR) activity of thioredoxin is mediated by the motif Cys-X-X-Cys located in its active site. This motif is shared by other TPOR proteins, such as glutaredoxin (21Holmgren A. Johansson C. Berndt C. Lonn M.E. Hudemann C. Lillig C.H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 1375-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), protein-disulfide isomerase (22Wilkinson B. Gilbert H.F. Biochim. Biophys.

Biol. 2002; 9: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The sensing of changes in intracellular redox state and consequently the triggering of antioxidation responses has been reported for several cysteine-containing proteins. It has been shown that upon elevation of intracellular hydroperoxides level, the yeast transcription factor Yap1 receives a signal from the glutathione peroxidase-like enzyme Gpx3, which serves as sensor and transducer of hydroperoxide signal to Yap1 that consequently activates the expression of antioxidant genes. Both the sensor and the regulator are reduced by thioredoxin (24Delaunay A. Pflieger D. Barrault M.B. Vinh J. Toledano M.B.

Multimerization of Ask1 (apoptosis signal-regulated kinase-1), induced by hydrogen peroxide, and its reduction by thioredoxin regulates the H2O2-induced c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activation and apoptosis (26Nadeau P.J.

It has been reported that activation of the function of Escherichia coli Hsp33, a redox-regulated molecular chaperone, requires the presence of reactive oxygen and hydroxyl radicals, which are sensed by the thiol-containing zinc center of the protein. Upon exposure to oxidative stress, the protein undergoes a conformational rearrangement and dimerizes to yield its functionally active structure in a process that is overall temperature-dependent (15Ilbert M.

In trypanosomatids, the major enzymatic pathway that regulates the intracellular redox state is based on tryparedoxin (TXN) and tryparedoxin peroxidase (TXNPx). In this pathway, glutathione is converted into an N′,N8-bis(glutathionyl) spermidine adduct, designated trypanothione (31Fairlamb A.H. Blackburn P. Ulrich P. Chait B.T. Cerami A. Science. 1985; 227: 1485-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 32Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 14: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The oxidized form of trypanothione, which is reduced by trypanothione reductase (TR), reduces TXN. Reduced TXN reduces in turn TXNPx, a member of the peroxiredoxin family. TXN shares low homology with thioredoxins, displayed mainly in the active site, which contains the Cys-X-X-Cys motif (33Flohe L. Hecht H.J. Steinert P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 966-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The known function of TXNPx is to detoxify hydrogen peroxide, defending the cell from oxidative stress (34Budde H. Flohe L. Biofactors. 2003; 17: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 35Castro H. Sousa C. Santos M. Cordeiro-da-Silva A. Flohe L. Tomas A.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1552-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that redox affects both the binding of UMSBP to the origin sequence and the protein oligomerization. Furthermore, we have shown that C. fasciculata tryparedoxin I and II (CfTXN I and II) activate UMSBP DNA binding activity in vitro and suggested that UMSBP activity may be regulated in the trypanosomatid cell through the cellular control of the protein's redox state (12Onn I. Milman-Shtepel N. Shlomai J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism that mediates the specific oxidation of UMSBP in such a regulatory model has remained unknown. In a recent report, Motyka et al. (36Motyka S.A. Drew M.E. Yildirir G. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18499-18506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) have suggested that oligomerization of UMSBP and loss of kDNA in Trypanosoma brucei cells overexpressing TXNPx, have resulted from the depletion of reduced mitochondrial TXN, thus affecting the redox state of UMSBP indirectly, through the oxidation of TXN. Such a model would presume that inactivation of UMSBP in the cell results from its direct oxidation by hydroperoxides and the inhibition of its reactivation through the oxidation of TXN. Here we hypothesized that oxidation of TXN-reduced UMSBP is conducted through an enzymatic reaction in which UMSBP is utilized directly as a substrate for oxidation by TXNPx, providing both the efficiency and the specificity, required from a regulatory mechanism that controls the binding of UMSBP to the replication origin. We found that the capacity of UMSBP to bind the origin sequence is controlled in vivo through a cell cycle-dependent regulation of the protein redox state. We further report here, for the first time, on the direct oxidation of UMSBP by TXNPx and the opposing regulatory effects of TXN and TXNPx on the interaction of UMSBP with the conserved origin sequence. Based on these observations, we suggest an enzymatic mechanism, which regulates the action of UMSBP at the kDNA replication origin.

Recombinant UMSBP was prepared as we have previously described (12Onn I. Milman-Shtepel N. Shlomai J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), except that elution from the phenyl-Sepahrose column was conducted with the following ammonium sulfate concentrations: 2 bed volumes of 1.0 m, followed by 6 bed volumes each of 0.8 and 0.7 m and 2 bed volumes each of 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, and 0 m ammonium sulfate concentrations. C. fasciculata cells were cultured in brain heart infusion (Difco) containing 10 μg/ml hemin (Sigma), 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin at 28 °C with shaking (150-200 rpm). Synchronization by hydroxyurea arrest was performed as previously described (37Pasion S.G. Brown G.W. Brown L.M. Ray D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3515-3520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a late log cell culture (∼108 cells/ml) was diluted to 107 cells/ml in medium containing 0.2 mg/ml hydroxyurea (Amersham Biosciences), followed by 6-10 h growth with shaking at 28 °C. Synchronized cells were harvested by centrifugation (3,220 × g, for 5 min, at 4 °C), resuspended in fresh medium without hydroxyurea, and allowed to grow for an additional 6.5 h. A sample of cells, withdrawn prior to hydroxyurea release, serves as time point zero. Such samples were withdrawn at 30-min intervals, centrifuged, and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Cells were centrifuged, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Cleared cell lysates (Fraction I) were prepared by the gentle disruption of the C. fasciculata cell membrane, using a nonionic detergent in hypotonic solution, as described previously (38Shlomai J.

Samples, withdrawn at 30-min intervals (∼4 × 106 cells) from hydroxyurea-synchronized C. fasciculata cultures, were resuspended in PBS, fixed in ice-cold methanol, and stored at -20 °C. Before their analysis, the cells were centrifuged (3,220 × g, for 10 min, at 4 °C), resuspended in PBS, containing 50 μg/ml RNase A, and incubated for 30 min on ice. In order to avoid cell aggregates, the samples were passed through 26-gauge syringe needle, followed by their filtration through a silk mesh. Propidium iodide was added to the sample (to final concentration of 25 μg/ml) before its injection to the FACS analyzer. Analysis was carried out using a FACScan (BD Biosciences) FACS analyzer. The DNA content of 10,000 events was measured using an FL3 emission filter (FL3-H). Values of the x and y axis are in arbitrary units.

The 20-μl standard binding reaction mixture contained 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 25 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), and 12.5 fmol of 5′-32P-labeled UMS (5′-GGGGTTGGTGTA-3′) DNA. 0.2-5 μg of cell lysate proteins were assayed in the reaction conducted under nonreducing conditions, and 20-80 ng were assayed in the reactions conducted under reducing conditions (in the presence of 2 mm dithiothreitol). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and electrophoresed in an 8% native polyacrylamide gel (1:29, bisacrylamide/acrylamide) in TAE buffer (6.7 mm Tris acetate, 3.3 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5). Electrophoresis was conducted at 0-2 °C at 250 V for 1.5 h. Protein-DNA complexes were quantified by exposing the dried gels to an imaging plate and analyzing by PhosphorImager. Lysates prepared from samples of synchronized cell cultures (500 μg of protein) were treated with 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma) for 1 h at 0 °C. N-Ethylmaleimide was then diluted to 0.13 mm with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 5 mm EDTA solution and concentrated using a Microcon concentrator (Millipore). Dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 20 mm, and the lysates were incubated for 1 h at 0 °C, followed by extensive dialysis against 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 5 mm EDTA solution. The lysates were concentrated using a Microcon concentrator, their protein content was determined by Bradford assay, and 50-μg protein samples were reacted for 1 h at 0 °C with a 0.3 mm final concentration of maleimide-polyethylene glycol (PEG; molecular mass of 2,385 ± 500 Da; NEKTAR). The reaction products were analyzed by 5-15% Tris/glycine SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and protein bands were detected by ECL using anti-UMSBP antibodies. Protein samples in loading buffer, containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.85, 2% (w/v) SDS, 3.5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue were boiled for 5 min and loaded onto a 16.5% Tris-Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gel (39Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10472) Google Scholar) along with protein size markers (“Rainbow” prestained low molecular weight (Amersham Biosciences) and “Precision Plus” prestained full range molecular weight (Bio-Rad)). The upper electrophoresis buffer was 0.1 m Tris-Cl, 0.1 m Tricine, pH 8.45, containing 0.1% SDS; the lower buffer was 0.2 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.9. Gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes for Western blot analysis, as described below. When nonreducing SDS-PAGE analyses were conducted, β-mercaptoethanol was omitted. Protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, as described above. Protein bands were transferred onto a Protran BA85 cellulose nitrate membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were blocked by incubation for 30 min in 5% skim dry milk (Difco) in PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.7 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4), containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBST) and probed for 90 min with a 1:3,000 dilution of mouse anti-UMSBP antibodies or 1:2000 rabbit anti-LimTXNPx antibody, as indicated. Membranes were probed for 40 min with a 1:20,000 dilution horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies, followed by ECL detection, as recommended by the manufacturer (Biological Industries). Pet15b plasmid (Novagene), expressing CfTXNPx was transformed into E. coli BL-21 (DE3). Cells were grown at 37 °C with vigorous shaking in LB growth medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Protein expression was induced by 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (at A600 of 0.6). Affinity chromatography was conducted using nickel-nitrilotriacetate beads (Qiagen), as we have previously described (12Onn I. Milman-Shtepel N. Shlomai J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), except that the elution buffer contained 350 mm imidazole, and no reducing agent was used throughout the entire procedure. Buffer exchange to 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, was performed using ZEBA desalting spin columns (Pierce). When further purification was required, a sample of the affinity chromatography-eluted TXNPx (2 mg) was loaded on a 1-ml fast protein liquid chromatography HiTrap Q FF column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5. The column was washed with 2 bed volumes of the equilibration buffer and then consecutively with 1.5 bed volumes of equilibration buffer containing 100 mm and 200 mm KCl. TXNPx was eluted by a 10-bed volume 200-700 mm KCl linear gradient in the same buffer. Chromatography was conducted in an AKTA purifier instrument (Amersham Biosciences), monitoring protein elution using a UV detector (λ214/220/280 nm). The eluted TXNPx was then rechromatographed on a nickel affinity column, as described above. CfTXNPx Activity—CfTXNPx activity was assayed, by measuring the reduction of hydrogen peroxide or cumene hydroperoxide (Sigma), following the method of Tetaud and Fairlamb (40Tetaud E. Fairlamb A.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 96: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction, performed in quartz cuvettes, contained 180 μm NADPH, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 130 μm trypanothione, 17 nmTcTRH6, 20 μmCfTXN2H6, 1-5 μmCfTXNPx, and 70 μm cumene hydroperoxide in 150 μl at room temperature. The reaction was performed by steps as follows. First, trypanothione was added to allow its reduction, and then CfTXN2H6 was added, followed by CfTXNPx addition. The reaction was initiated by the addition of cumene hydroperoxide, and its reduction was monitored by spectrophotometer (λ340 nm), recording the consumption of NADPH. CfTXNPx Effect on UMSBP Binding—The effect of CfTXNPx on UMSBP binding to UMS was assayed by the incubation of 2.7 nm UMSBP in the presence of the indicated concentrations of CfTXNPx in an 8-μl reaction mixture, containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.3 mg/ml BSA, and 70 μm cumene hydroperoxide. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 60 min, followed by the addition of 2 μl of binding assay solution, containing 6.4 μg of BSA, 10 mm MgCl2, and 12.5 fmol of 32P-labeled UMS. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 5 min, and their products were analyzed by EMSA and exposed to a PhosphorImager, as described above. TXNPx-UMSBP Interactions—To monitor TXNPx-UMSBP interactions as well as oxidation of UMSBP by TXNPx, 7.2 μm UMSBP was incubated in a 10-μl reaction mixture, containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 70 μm cumene hydroperoxide, and 7.8 μmCfTXNPx for 60 min at 30 °C. The protein interaction was analyzed by 16.5% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE, under nonreducing conditions, blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and subjected to Western analysis, using anti-UMSBP and anti-TXNPx antibodies. The ECL reaction was developed by LAS-3000 (Fuji) or by exposure to x-ray film and analysis by TINA software. Oxidation of UMSBP by CfTXNPx (10 μm) in this reaction was assayed by monitoring the complex of UMSBP with fluorescein-5-maleimide (Pierce), as follows. The reaction products were cooled on ice. Flourescein 5-maleimide was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, followed by incubation for 30 min on ice. The reaction products were analyzed by nonreducing 16.5% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE, as described above. CfTXN I was incubated at the indicated concentrations in a 5-μl reaction mixture, containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mg/ml BSA, 150 μm NADPH, 100 ng of TcTRH6, 20 μm trypanothione, and 7.2 nm UMSBP. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, followed by the addition of CfTXNPx, at the indicated concentrations, in a 10-μl assay mixture containing 70 μm cumene hydroperoxide, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 1 mg/ml BSA. The reactions were further incubated for 60 min at 30 °C. UMS (12.5 fmol) was added in a 5-μl binding assay buffer, containing 5 μg of BSA, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 8 mm MgCl2. The reaction mixtures were incubated for an additional 5 min at 30 °C, and their products were analyzed by EMSA and quantified by phosphorimaging. C. fasciculata (5 × 105 cells) were washed once with PBS, placed on poly-l-lysine-coated slides, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min. This was followed by two 5-min incubations with 0.1 m glycine-PBS, a 5-min incubation with 0.1% Triton X-100 solution in PBS, a 5-min wash with PBS, and overnight fixation with 100% methanol at -20 °C. The slides were washed three times for 5 min with PBS, followed by 30 min of blocking with 1% BSA in PBS. Rabbit anti-LimTXNPx antibody at a 1:300 dilution was added, and the slides were incubated for 90 min in a humidity chamber. This was followed by three 5-min washes with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS and a 45-min incubation with goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to Alexa-594, at a 1:20,000 dilution. The slides were washed three times for 5 min with 0.05% Tween 20, stained for 1 min with 1 μg/ml DAPI in PBS, washed 5 min with PBS, and dried for 1 h. Dabco antifade was added, and the slides were sealed. The cells were photographed using a 100-ms exposure time for the DAPI staining and 500-1,000 ms for the Alexa fluorophore.

STAT-6 acetylation via the histone acetyltransferase KAT3B has been proposed to be necessary for 15-LOX-1 transcriptional activation. However, the exact mechanism underlying 15-LOX-1 transcriptional reactivation in cancer cells is still undefined, especially in regard to the contribution of 15-LOX-1 promoter histone modifications. We therefore examined the relative mechanistic contributions of 15-LOX-1 promoter histone modifications and STAT-6 to 15-LOX-1 transcriptional reactivation by HDACIs in colon cancer cells. We found that: 1) histone H3 and H4 acetylation in the 15-LOX-1 promoter through KAT3B was critical to 15-LOX-1 transcriptional activation; 2) 15-LOX-1 transcription was activated independently from STAT-6; and 3) dimethyl-histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2) demethylation in the 15-LOX-1 promoter via the histone lysine demethylase KDM3A was an early and specific histone modification and was necessary for activation of transcription. These findings demonstrate that histone modification in the 15-LOX-1 promoter is important to 15-LOX-1 transcriptional silencing in colon cancer cells and that HDACIs can activate gene transcription via KDM3A demethylation of H3K9me2. 15-Lipoxygenase-1 (15-LOX-1) contributes significantly to inflammation regulation and terminal cell differentiation. 15-LOX-1 is transcriptionally silenced in cancer cells, and its transcriptional reactivation (e.g. via histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs)) is essential for restoring terminal cell differentiation to cancer cells.

Reversal of 15-LOX-1 transcriptional silencing in cancer cells has been proposed to occur via various mechanisms: global histone H4 (H4) acetylation (28Kamitani H. Taniura S. Ikawa H. Watanabe T.

Nonetheless, the exact mechanisms underlying 15-LOX-1 transcriptional reactivation in cancer cells remain unknown. For example, it is unclear whether global H4 acetylation activates 15-LOX-1 transcription through direct 15-LOX-1 promoter chromatin modification or through the expression of transcriptional factors that subsequently influence the 15-LOX-1 promoter. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) down-regulates STAT-6 expression (36Zhang C. Richon V. Ni X. Talpur R. Duvic M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2005; 125: 1045-1052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but still activates 15-LOX-1 expression (23Hsi L.C. Xi X. Lotan R. Shureiqi I. Lippman S.M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 8778-8781Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), raising the question of whether STAT-6 is necessary for 15-LOX-1 transcriptional activation. GATA-6 knockdown inhibits GATA-6 binding to the 15-LOX-1 promoter but fails to activate 15-LOX-1 transcription (31Shureiqi I. Zuo X. Broaddus R. Wu Y. Guan B. Morris J.S. Lippman S.M. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). 15-LOX-1 promoter DNA demethylation is insufficient to reactivate 15-LOX-1 expression (32Zuo X. Shen L. Issa J.-P. Moy O. Morris J.S. Lippman S.M. Shureiqi I. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 1981-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To identify the crucial molecular mechanisms underlying 15-LOX-1 transcriptional reactivation in cancer cells, we examined the mechanisms by which HDACIs activate 15-LOX-1 transcription, given that HDACIs are the most potent class of agents known to induce this activation (23Hsi L.C. Xi X. Lotan R. Shureiqi I. Lippman S.M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 8778-8781Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 28Kamitani H. Taniura S. Ikawa H. Watanabe T. Kelavkar U.P. Eling T.E.

FASEB J. 2008; 22: 1981-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In particular, we examined whether HDACIs activated 15-LOX-1 transcription via promoter histone modification or STAT-6, which has been proposed to be crucial to 15-LOX-1 transcriptional activation (33Shankaranarayanan P. Chaitidis P. Kuhn H. Nigam S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42753-42760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In a series of experiments, we identified novel chromatin modification events in the 15-LOX-1 promoter that activate 15-LOX-1 transcription independently of STAT-6 via KAT3B acetylation of histone H3 and H4 and KDM3A demethylation of histone H3 dimethyllysine 9 (H3K9me2).

Other reagents, molecular grade solvents, and chemicals were obtained from commercial manufacturers or as specified. Cell Cultures and Treatments—HT29, SW480, HCT-116, RKO, and DLD-1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium, and Caco-2 cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Cambrex, Walkersville, MD) with l-glutamine in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C.

Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Transfection—SW480 and Caco-2 cells were cultured to 40–50% confluence and then transfected with 100 nm of a pooled mixture of four siRNA duplexes (SMARTselected or On Target; Dharmacon, Inc., Lafayette, CO) for the targeted gene (e.g. STAT-6, KAT3B) or with nonspecific control siRNA (Dharmacon, Inc.) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). RNA Extraction and Real-time PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center Inc., Cincinnati, OH). RNA from each sample was reverse transcribed and then measured quantitatively by real-time PCR using a comparative Ct method, as described previously (31Shureiqi I. Zuo X. Broaddus R. Wu Y. Guan B. Morris J.S. Lippman S.M. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and ChIP/Real-time PCR Assays—Cross-linking was performed by adding formaldehyde to the cell culture medium to a final concentration of 1% and incubating for 10 min at 37 °C. ChIP assays were performed using a commercial kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions). Chromatin was immunoprecipitated using the indicated antibodies. ChIP assays using an agarose gel electrophoresis method were performed similarly to what was described previously (31Shureiqi I. Zuo X. Broaddus R. Wu Y. Guan B. Morris J.S. Lippman S.M.

For studying STAT-6 binding to the 15-LOX-1 promoter, we used primers that amplified a 182-bp fragment of the human 15-LOX-1 promoter that covers a specific STAT-6 binding site located 952 bp upstream of the 15-LOX-1 start codon (39Conrad D.J. Lu M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar): 5′-TAA TTC ACT CTG GTG GGG TGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAG TTT CTT TTT GGG CTG GA-3′ (antisense). The relative enrichment of transcription factors or histone modifications (e.g. KDM3A, H3K9me2) was measured using ChIP/real-time PCR with the following primers and FAM dye-labeling probe: forward, GTGTTTTCGGTCCAAATCCTTTTCT; reverse, GAGAGCAGGGAGTGGAAACC; probe, CCTCCCGTCAAGATAGT to amplify the –280 bp to –212 bp region of the 15-LOX-1 promoter relative to the ATG site. Histone acetylation levels in the 15-LOX-1 promoter were measured by ChIP/real-time PCR with the following primers and FAM labeling probe: forward, GAGACCTGCCACCCACATT; reverse, GAGCTAAATAACCCAGCCTGAGA; probe, CCGACCCCAAGCGAC to amplify the –120 bp to –47 bp region of the 15-LOX-1 promoter relative to the ATG site. Real-time PCR was performed as described previously (32Zuo X. Shen L. Issa J.-P. Moy O. Morris J.S. Lippman S.M. Shureiqi I. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 1981-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Statistical Analyses—We used the t test for two-group comparisons. For analyses involving single factors and more than two groups, we performed a one-way analysis of variance. If the overall analysis of variance test result was significant, we performed pairwise comparisons, adjusting for multiplicities using the Bonferroni correction. We analyzed data involving the simultaneous consideration of two factors using two-way analysis of variance. We first tested the interaction effect, and if it was statistically significant, we subsequently performed specific comparisons to investigate which differences were driving this effect, using the Bonferroni correction to adjust for the multiple testing problem. An individual comparison was considered significant only if the p value was less than 0.05/k, with k representing the number of comparisons performed. If the interaction effect was not significant, we tested the individual main effects. Then, if those were significant, we determined which pairwise comparisons were significant, again adjusting for multiplicities using the Bonferroni correction. We used the Pearson correlation method to correlate differences in the levels of the studied variables (e.g. 15-LOX-1 mRNA expression level, histone H3 acetylation in the 15-LOX-1 promoter) between depsipeptide- or SAHA-treated and control cells. All of the tests were two-sided and conducted at the p ≤ 0.05 level. Quantitative data log transformation was used to account for the normal distributional assumptions underlying the methods. The data were analyzed using SAS software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). 15-LOX-1 Promoter Histone Acetylation and 15-LOX-1 Transcriptional Reactivation—Depsipeptide induced acetylation of histones H3 and H4 in the 15-LOX-1 promoter (Fig. 1, A and B). The level of acetylated histone H3 in the 15-LOX-1 promoter increased significantly within the first 60 min and continued to increase during 6 h after depsipeptide treatment in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 1C; p < 0.0001). Depsipeptide and SAHA differentially induced 15-LOX-1 expression (Fig. 1, D and E, p < 0.0001) and histone H3 acetylation in the 15-LOX-1 promoter (Fig. 1, F and G, p < 0.0001) in the six tested colorectal cancer cell lines. The induction of 15-LOX-1 expression correlated highly with the increase in histone H3 acetylation in the 15-LOX-1 promoter by both depsipeptide (Fig. 1H; Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.94; p = 0.006) and SAHA (Fig. 1I; Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.99; p = 0.0003) in the six tested colorectal cancer cell lines. 15-LOX-1 Promoter Histone Acetylation Is Required for 15-LOX-1 Transcriptional Activation—KAT3B is a very well known histone acetyltransferase (40Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar, 41Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar). We used KAT3B knockdown by siRNA to examine whether 15-LOX-1 promoter histone acetylation is necessary for 15-LOX-1 transcriptional activation. Transfection of KAT3B siRNA reduced the level of KAT3B expression by 85% in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 2A; p < 0.0001) and 78% in SW480 cells (supplemental Fig. S1; p < 0.0001). In Caco-2 cells, depsipeptide markedly increased 15-LOX-1 promoter enrichment with acetylated histone H3, and KAT3B siRNA reduced this increase by 60% (Fig. 2B; p < 0.0001). In SW480 cells, depsipeptide increased 15-LOX-1 promoter enrichment with acetylated histone H3, and KAT3B siRNA reduced this increase by 70% (supplemental Fig. S1; p < 0.0001). Similarly, in Caco-2 cells, depsipeptide markedly increased 15-LOX-1 promoter enrichment with acetylated H4, and KAT3B siRNA reduced this increase by 55% (Fig. 2C; p < 0.0001). In SW480 cells, depsipeptide increased the relative level of acetylated H4, and KAT3B siRNA reduced this increase by 82% (supplemental Fig. S1; p < 0.0001). In Caco-2 cells, depsipeptide increased 15-LOX-1 expression, and KAT3B siRNA reduced this increase by 84% (Fig. 2D; p < 0.0001). The same pattern was seen in SW480 cells (supplemental Fig. S1; p < 0.0001). 15-LOX-1 Transcriptional Activation in Colorectal Cancer Cells Is Independent of STAT-6—STAT-6 siRNA reduced STAT-6 expression relative to nonspecific siRNA by 79% in Caco-2 cells and 77% in SW480 cells (Fig. 3, A and B; p < 0.0001). STAT-6 binding to the 15-LOX-1 promoter was inhibited in STAT-6 siRNA-transfected cells but not in cells transfected with nonspecific siRNA (Fig. 3, C and D). 15-LOX-1 expression levels were similar for nonspecific siRNA and STAT-6 siRNA in both Caco-2 cells (p = 0.86) and SW480 cells (p = 0.8) (Fig. 3, E and F). 15-LOX-1 Promoter Chromatin Modification during 15-LOX-1 Transcriptional Activation—During the first hour after depsipeptide treatment, the level of acetylated histone H3 in Caco-2 cells increased rapidly (Fig. 4A; p = 0.0001), whereas the level of H3K4me2 remained unchanged (Fig. 4A; p = 0.188). Among the various other histone methylation markers we evaluated in the 15-LOX-1 promoter (H3K9me1, H3K9me2, H3K9me3, H3K27me2, H3K27me3, and H4K20me3), only the H3K9me2 level changed significantly, with a 54% reduction in recruitment level (p < 0.0001) measured 30 min after depsipeptide treatment (Fig. 4B). During the first 30 min after depsipeptide treatment, the level of H3K9ac increased, whereas the level of H3K9me2 decreased in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4, C and D; p < 0.0001). Recruitment of KDM3A to the 15-LOX-1 Promoter Is Required for 15-LOX-1 Transcriptional Activation—Depsipeptide significantly increased the recruitment of KDM3A, a demethylase of H3K9me2, to the 15-LOX-1 promoter in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 5A; p = 0.004). KDM3A siRNA transfection into Caco-2 cells significantly reduced KDM3A recruitment to the 15-LOX-1 promoter with depsipeptide compared with the recruitment seen with nonspecific siRNA (Fig. 5B; p < 0.0001). The H3K9me2 level was significantly increased in KDM3A siRNA-transfected cells treated with depsipeptide, compared with the level in cells transfected with nonspecific siRNA and treated identically with depsipeptide (Fig. 5C; p < 0.0001). KDM3A siRNA transfection reduced the 15-LOX-1 mRNA level in cells treated with depsipeptide compared with the level in cells transfected with nonspecific siRNA and treated with depsipeptide (Fig. 5D; p < 0.0001). Our new findings demonstrate that: 1)15-LOX-1 transcriptional activation in colon cancer cells requires specific histone modification events in the 15-LOX-1 promoter: H3K9me2 demethylation by KDM3A and histone H3 and H4 acetylation by KAT3B; and 2) HDACIs can activate transcription via KDM3A demethylation of H3K9me2. Histone acetylation in the 15-LOX-1 promoter but not STAT-6 was necessary for 15-LOX-1 transcriptional activation. 15-LOX-1 transcriptional activation highly correlated with histone H3 acetylation as demonstrated by our testing in six colorectal cancer cell lines using both specific (depsipeptide (38Bolden J.E. Peart M.J. Johnstone R.W. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 769-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2527) Google Scholar)) and nonspecific (SAHA) HDACIs. By using KAT3B knockdown via siRNA to inhibit histone H3 and H4 acetylation, we confirmed that acetylation of histone H3 and H4 in the 15-LOX-1 promoter was necessary for 15-LOX-1 activation. The authors of a prior report proposed that KAT3B activates 15-LOX-1 transcription via STAT-6 acetylation (33Shankaranarayanan P. Chaitidis P. Kuhn H. Nigam S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42753-42760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, we found that 15-LOX-1 transcriptional activation required KAT3B acetylation of 15-LOX-1 promoter histones but not STAT-6. We found that STAT-6 down-regulation via siRNA, although successful in inhibiting the binding of STAT-6 to the 15-LOX-1 promoter, failed to influence depsipeptide activation of 15-LOX-1 transcription. These findings agree with those in a recent report showing that SAHA down-regulated STAT-6 expression (36Zhang C. Richon V. Ni X. Talpur R. Duvic M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2005; 125: 1045-1052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which suggested that STAT-6 does not contribute to transcriptional activation by HDACIs. STAT-6 has been reported to be necessary for IL-4 transcriptional activation of 12/15-LOX (the mouse homologue of 15-LOX-1) in mice (42Heydeck D. Thomas L. Schnurr K. Trebus F. Thierfelder W.E. Ihle J.N. Kuhn H. Blood. 1998; 92: 2503-2510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and for 15-LOX-1 transcription in human BEAS-2B transformed airway epithelial cells and A534 lung cancer cells (33Shankaranarayanan P. Chaitidis P. Kuhn H. Nigam S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42753-42760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 39Conrad D.J. Lu M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The fact that STAT-6 has been shown to be required for IL-4-induced but not HDACI-induced 15-LOX-1 transcriptional activation might reflect differences in the mechanisms of action between IL-4 and HDACIs. IL-4 binds to cell surface receptors and requires STAT-6 for signal transduction to influence nuclear events (43Mikita T. Campbell D. Wu P. Williamson K. Schindler U. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 5811-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), whereas the HDACIs directly influence transcriptional events (38Bolden J.E. Peart M.J. Johnstone R.W. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 769-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2527) Google Scholar). In support of this notion, we found that depsipeptide activated 15-LOX-1 transcription much earlier than IL-4 did in A534 cells (supplemental Fig. S2). Specific chromatin modification events in the 15-LOX-1 promoter activated 15-LOX-1 transcription. These events included very early removal of a transcriptional silencing histone modification, H3K9me2 (44Martin C. Zhang Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 838-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar, 45Nightingale K.P. O'Neill L.P. Turner B.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2006; 16: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), and an increase in H3K9ac, a transcriptional activation marker (46Peterson C.L. Laniel M.-A. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R546-R551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). The specificity of these histone changes is supported by the lack of changes in the other histone markers of transcriptional activation (e.g. H3K4me2 (44Martin C. Zhang Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 838-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar)) or transcriptional silencing (e.g. H3K9me1, H3K9me3, H3K27me2, H3K27me3, or H4K20me3 (44Martin C. Zhang Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 838-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar, 47Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2005; 436: 1103-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar)) during 15-LOX-1 transcriptional activation. To our knowledge, the pattern we identified is the first specific chromatin modification pattern in the 15-LOX-1 promoter to have been identified, especially in regard to histone methylation. Previously published information on 15-LOX-1 promoter modifications is limited to nonspecific global H4 acetylation (28Kamitani H. Taniura S. Ikawa H. Watanabe T. Kelavkar U.P. Eling T.E. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and general histone H3 15-LOX-1 promoter acetylation (33Shankaranarayanan P. Chaitidis P. Kuhn H. Nigam S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42753-42760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We found that depsipeptide activated 15-LOX-1 transcription through demethylation of H3K9me2 by KDM3A, a recently identified specific H3K9me2 demethylase (48Yamane K. Toumazou C. Tsukada Y.-i. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Wong J. Zhang Y. Cell. 2006; 125: 483-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Depsipeptide promoted KDM3A recruitment to the 15-LOX-1 promoter. Inhibition of this recruitment via KDM3A down-regulation by siRNA increased the H3K9me2 level in the 15-LOX-1 promoter and suppressed depsipeptide activation of 15-LOX-1 transcription. These findings indicate that depsipeptide recruitment of KDM3A to the 15-LOX-1 promoter and the subsequent H3K9me2 demethylation are necessary for activation of 15-LOX-1 transcription. Data are emerging to support the important role of histone demethylases in the transcriptional regulation of normal and pathologic molecular cellular events (49Lee D.Y. Teyssier C. Strahl B.D. Stallcup M.R. Endocr. Rev. 2005; 26: 147-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 50Shi Y. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 829-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The only prior report of a pharmaceutical intervention that enhanced the recruitment of KDM3A for transcriptional activation was a report on the hormonal androgen analogue R1881 (48Yamane K. Toumazou C. Tsukada Y.-i. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Wong J. Zhang Y. Cell. 2006; 125: 483-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Our current results show that KDM3A demethylation of H3K9me2 appears not to be limited to transcriptional activation by hormonal agents but also to contribute to transcriptional activation by the HDACIs. The strong correlation between the degree of 15-LOX-1 transcription activation in cancer cell lines and histone acetylation, although it supports the notion that histone deacetylation is necessary for maintaining 15-LOX-1 transcriptional silencing, still leaves open the possibility that other mechanisms might contribute to 15-LOX-1 transcriptional silencing in cancer cells. For example, we have recently found that the dissociation of DNA methyltransferase-1 from the 15-LOX-1 promoter can significantly influence 15-LOX-1 transcriptional activation in colon cancer cells (32Zuo X. Shen L. Issa J.-P. Moy O. Morris J.S. Lippman S.M. Shureiqi I. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 1981-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). DNA methyltransferase-1 contributes to H3K9me2 formation during replication (51Esteve P.O. Chin H.G. Smallwood A. Feehery G.R. Gangisetty O. Karpf A.R. Carey M.F. Pradhan S. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 3089-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Further studies are needed to evaluate the contribution of DNA methyltransferase-1 to H3K9me2 formation in the 15-LOX-1 promoter. In summary, our findings demonstrate the important role of specific chromatin modification in the regulation of 15-LOX-1 transcription. These results provide a new model for the orchestrated chromatin modification events in the 15-LOX-1 promoter that are involved in 15-LOX-1 transcriptional activation: KDM3A recruitment to demethylate H3K9me2 and histone H3 and H4 acetylation via KAT3B. Further studies of these chromatin modification events in the 15-LOX-1 promoter will not only help to improve our understanding of the mechanism of 15-LOX-1 silencing in cancer cells but also help to identify novel molecular targets for inhibiting colonic tumorigenesis.

DD-peptidases are also called penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), since they form stable acyl-enzymes with β-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillins. On the other hand, β-lactamases react similarly with these antibiotics, but the acyl-enzymes are unstable and rapidly hydrolyzed. Besides, all known PBPs and β-lactamases share very low sequence similarities, thus rendering it difficult to understand how a PBP could evolve into a β-lactamase. In this study, we identified a new family of cyanobacterial PBPs featuring the highest sequence similarity with the most widespread class A β-lactamases. Interestingly, the Ω-loop, which, in the β-lactamases, carries an essential glutamate involved in the deacylation process, is six amino acids shorter and does not contain any glutamate residue. From this new family of proteins, we characterized PBP-A from Thermosynechococcus elongatus and discovered hydrolytic activity with synthetic thiolesters that are usually good substrates of DD-peptidases. Penicillin degradation pathways as well as acylation and deacylation rates are characteristic of PBPs. In a first attempt to generate β-lactamase activity, a 90-fold increase in deacylation rate was obtained by introducing a glutamate in the shorter Ω-loop.

Bacteriol. Rev. 1968; 32: 425-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These enzymes catalyze transpeptidation and carboxypeptidation reactions, thus controlling the peptidoglycan synthesis and cross-linking. As a result of the acylation of their catalytic serine, these enzymes form stable acylenzymes with β-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillins, the stability of these complexes being at the origin of the antibiotic effect. Hence, DD-peptidases are also called penicillin-binding proteins or PBPs 2The abbreviation used is: PBP, penicillin-binding protein. 2The abbreviation used is: PBP, penicillin-binding protein. (2Ghuysen J.M. Annu Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 37-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 3Jamin M. Wilkin J.M. Frère J.M. Essays Biochem. 1995; 29: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). PBPs are divided into two main groups: the low Mr PBPs are monofunctional catalytic entities (4Ghuysen J.-M. Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents. 1997; 8: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and the high Mr PBPs comprise an additional N-terminal domain (5Goffin C. Ghuysen J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1079-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To counteract β-lactam antibiotics, some bacteria produce β-lactamases (6Poole K. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 2200-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 7Frère J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 8Fisher J.F. Meroueh S.O.

According to their primary structure, serine β-lactamases can be divided into three classes: A, C, and D (class B constituting the group of metalloenzymes). The penicillin-binding module of DD-peptidases and β-lactamases share a similar three-dimensional structure composed of two domains, an all-α-domain and an α/β-domain, the catalytic site being at the interface (7Frère J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Three common essential motifs line up the active site, following Ambler numbering (9Ambler R.P. Coulson A.F. Frère J.M. Ghuysen J.M. Joris B. Forsman M. Levesque R.C. Tiraby G. Waley S.G. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 269-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar), S70XXK containing the active nucleophile serine, (S/Y)130XN on a loop in the all-α-domain and (K/R)234(S/T)G on a β-sheet forming the opposite wall of the catalytic cavity. Regarding β-lactamases, the rapid hydrolysis of the penicilloyl-enzyme is performed by a water molecule activated by an additional enzymatic element. In class A β-lactamases, this role is carried out by a strictly conserved Glu166 (10Adachi H. Ohta T. Matsuzawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3186-3191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) situated on a 16-residue loop (Arg164–Asp179) usually referred as the Ω-loop (11Matagne A. Frère J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1246: 109-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 12Matagne A. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Frère J.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 581-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). For class C and D β-lactamases, a tyrosine (13Oefner C. D'Arcy A. Daly J.J. Gubernator K. Charnas R.L. Heinze I. Hubschwerlen C. Winkler F.K. Nature. 1990; 343: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 14Lobkovsky E. Billings E.M. Moews P.C. Rahil J. Pratt R.F. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6762-6772Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and an unusual carbamylated lysine (15Golemi D. Maveyraud L. Vakulenko S. Samama J.P. Mobashery S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14280-14285Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), respectively, are involved in the deacylation mechanism. On the basis of sequence similarities, it was proposed that each class of PBP is subdivided into three subclasses, some of which are related to specific classes of β-lactamases (2Ghuysen J.M. Annu Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 37-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments and comparative analysis of the structures and the reaction mechanisms indicate that these enzymes are phylogenetically linked (3Jamin M. Wilkin J.M. Frère J.M. Essays Biochem. 1995; 29: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar, 16Massova I. Mobashery S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 17Kelly J.A. Dideberg O.

Science. 1986; 231: 1429-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and that each class of β-lactamase evolved most probably from an ancestral PBP, bringing to the active site an efficient catalysis mechanism for the deacylation reaction. The low Mr class C PBPs, including PBP4 from Escherichia coli and Actinomadura R39 are believed to be the phylogenetically closest PBPs to class A β-lactamases, although sequence similarities are almost undetectable except for the presence of the three essential motifs (16Massova I. Mobashery S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Hence, despite a similar organization of the catalytic sites, the evolutionary pathway has disappeared, and the precise structural and chemical elements that are required in the different reactivities toward β-lactams are still not understood. In this work, we identified a new family of PBPs in cyanobacterial genomes featuring the highest sequence similarity to class A β-lactamases so far reported. The protein of the thermophilic Thermosynechococcus elongatus was chosen for biochemical characterization. After cloning, expression, and purification, the protein was examined for hydrolytic and aminolytic activity toward various substrates and for β-lactam reactivity. Based on the sequence alignment with class A β-lactamases, a few mutations were introduced with the aim of increasing the β-lactamase activity. The single mutation L158E in the shorter Ω-loop afforded a 90-fold improved deacylation of the penicilloyl-enzyme. Chemicals and Antibiotics—All β-lactam antibiotics and d-Ala-d-Ala, Ac2-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala, and Ala-d-γ-Glu-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala substrates were purchased from Sigma. d-Ala paranitroanilide was from Bachem. Thiolester substrates were a kind gift from M. Galleni (Université de Liège, Belgium). Oligonucleotides were from Eurogentec, with “fp” and “rp” standing, respectively, for forward and reverse primer: pbp-a-fp, 5′-TCG CCA TGG CCG CTC CTG AGG CAC C-3′; pbp-a-rp, 5′-CGT TCT AGA GGC GGC GAA AGT TTC-3′; D160A-fp, 5′-ATC CGC TGC CGC CTA TGA AGG GCA CC-3′; D160A-rp, 5′-GGT GCC CTT CAT AGC CGG CAG CGG AT-3′; L158d-fp, 5′-AAA TAC GGT GAT TAA CAA TCC GGA TCC GGA TAT GAA GGG CAC CAA-3′; L158d-rp, 5′-TTG GTG CCC TTC ATA TCC GGA TCC GGA TTG TTA ATC ACC GTA TTT-3′; L158E-fp, 5′-CGG TGA TTA ACA ATC CGG AGC CGG ATA TGA AGG GC-3′; L158E-rp, 5′-GCC CTT CAT ATC CGG CTC CGG ATT GTT AAT CAC CG-3′; S61A-fp, 5′-GTT TTT CCT GCC GCG GCT ACG ATT AAG TTT C-3′; S61A-rp, 5′-GAA ACT TAT CGT AGC CGC GGC AGG AAA AAC-3′; pbp-a-Δ1, 5′-AAT ACG GTG ATT AAC ACC ACC AGT CCC CGG-3′; pbp-a-Δ2, 5′-ACT GGT GGT GTT AAT CAC CGT ATT TTC TAA GC-3′. Bacterial Strains—T. elongatus BP-1 was used as a source of DNA for PCR amplification of the pbp-a gene (locus: tll2115), and a total genome extract of the cyanobacteria was kindly provided by M. Sugiura (Department of Applied Biological Chemistry, Osaka Prefecture University). E. coli Top 10 (Invitrogen) was used for standard subcloning procedures as well as for protein expression. Cloning of pbp-a Gene and Mutants—The pbp-a gene was identified in the complete genome of T. elongatus (18Nakamura Y. Kaneko T. Sato S. Ikeuchi M. Katoh H. Sasamoto S. Watanabe A. Iriguchi M. Kawashima K. Kimura T. Kishida Y. Kiyokawa C. Kohara M. Matsumoto M. Matsuno A. Nakazaki N. Shimpo S. Sugimoto M. Takeuchi C. Yamada M. Tabata S.

DNA Res. 2002; 9: 135-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), available in CyanoBase, the genome data base for cyanobacteria (available on the World Wide Web). Since probable signal peptide and/or transmembrane segments were predicted by various programs available from the ExPASy Proteomics server, between amino acids 1 and 92 (see Fig. 3), the gene encoding the PBP domain of PBP-A protein (i.e. truncated from its 92 first N-terminal residues) was recovered by PCR using primers pbp-a-fp and pbp-a-rp and the purified T. elongatus chromosome as a template. In this way, NcoI and XbaI restriction sites were added at the 5′ and 3′ termini of the pbp-a gene. The amplified 853-bp fragment was then cloned in the pGEM-T Easy cloning vector (Promega). After sequencing confirmation, the pbp-a gene was cloned in the pBAD/Myc-HisB-Tet vector in fusion with a Myc tag and a His6 tag. This expression vector is a derivative of pBAD/Myc-HisB (Invitrogen), but the ampicillin resistance marker has been replaced by a tetracycline resistance gene. In the final construct, a methionine was added to the N-terminal end of the truncated protein, giving the numbering Met1-Pro2..., which is used throughout the report. The expression vector for the Ω-loop deletion mutant PBP-A-Δ was constructed similarly but the initial PCR fragment was generated by running an overlap extension of two PCR fragments obtained by amplification with the pbp-a-Δ1/pbp-a-rp and pbp-a-Δ2/pbp-a-fp pairs of primers. D160A, L158D, L158E, and S61A mutations were generated with the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the respective pairs of fp and rp primers and the wild type expression vector as a template. Culture and PBP-A Production—Transformed E. coli Top 10 were grown in 1 liter of Luria-Bertani broth medium supplemented with tetracycline (7.5 μg/ml) at 37 °C until A600 reached ∼0,6. The temperature was lowered to 30 °C, and protein production was induced for 3–4 h by the addition of l-a-rabinose at a final concentration of 0.2% (w/v). The culture was centrifuged at 4400 × g for 10 min, and the harvested cells were stored overnight at −20 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 8 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 mm NaCl supplemented with 100 μl of egg white lysozyme (10 mg/ml). After a 20-min incubation at room temperature followed by a 45-min incubation at 37 °C, 200 μl of DNase (1 mg/ml) was added, and the lysate was incubated for 15 min at room temperature. A cytoplasmic extract was obtained by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. PBP-A Purification—The cytoplasmic extract was dialyzed against 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole (buffer A), using a Spectra/Por membrane (10,000 Mr cutoff) overnight, at 4 °C. Following passage through a 0.22-μm filter, the protein mixture was applied to a Ni2+-chelating column (HiTrap chelating; Amersham Biosciences), washed with 10 column volumes of buffer A, and finally eluted with a 10–500 mm imidazole gradient in buffer A. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and those containing PBP-A were pooled and submitted to steric exclusion chromatography on a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 preparation grade column (Amersham Biosciences), using 20 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, as elution buffer. Protein fractions were analyzed by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and either stained with Coomassie Blue R250 or submitted to Western blot using an anti-Myc antibody (Invitrogen). The protein concentration in pure fractions was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 13,370 m-1 cm-1. Enzymatic Assays—The DD-peptidase activity was tested by incubating PBP-A with Ac2-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala (1 mm) or d-Ala-d-Ala (1 mm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8, in presence or not of a glycine acceptor (1 mm), at 25 °C. The release of d-Ala was estimated continuously using the d-amino acid oxidase method (20Frère J.M. Leyh-Bouille M. Ghuysen J.M. Nieto M. Perkins H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 610-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Incubation with Ac2-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala was also performed at 55 °C, aliquots were taken at different times, reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 mm penicillin G, and the release of d-Ala was estimated by the same d-amino acid oxidase method. d-Amino peptidase activity was also assayed on the chromogenic substrate d-Ala paranitroanilide (21Shibata K. Watanabe T. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3409-3413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 25 and 55 °C, with concentrations varying from 5 to 18 mm in 20 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and following the absorbance of p-nitroaniline at 405 nm (ϵ = 10,200 m-1 cm-1). Hydrolysis of 0.3 mm S2a, racemic S2c and S2d, and diastereoisomeric PhacATl thiolester substrates was performed at 37 °C and monitored spectrophotometrically at 250 nm (22Rhazi N. Charlier P. Dehareng D. Engher D. Vermeire M. Frère J.M. Nguyen-Disteche M. Fonze E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2895-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 23Jamin M. Adam M. Damblon C. Christiaens L.

J. 1990; 270: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Kinetic parameters were extracted by numerical simulation of the progression curves using the following equations, d[S1]+d[S2]=(((kcat1[E]+k0)[S1]/(Km1+[S1]))+((kcat2[E]+k0)[S2]/(Km2+[S2])))dt Abs=ϵS([S1]+[S2])+ϵP([P1]+[P2]) –> where ϵS and ϵP are the extinction coefficients of the substrate and the product, and the subscripts 1 and 2 stand for the two enantiomers or diastereoisomers. k0 is the constant for spontaneous thiolester hydrolysis and was measured independently. ϵS, ϵP, kcat1, Km1, kcat2, and Km2 were optimized together during the simulations. This is possible because couples of parameters are affecting different regions of the curve. Penicillin Binding Assay and Rate Measurements—The kinetic scheme for the interaction of a PBP with a β-lactam antibiotic is as follows, E+Sk1↔k−1E⋅Sk2→E−Sk3→E+P where E·S is the noncovalent Michaelis complex, E-S is the covalent acyl-enzyme complex, and P is the released product. The deacylation rate constant, k3, was derived from the first order decay rates of the [14C]penicilloyl-PBP complex. PBP-A protein (between 3 and 10 μm) was incubated for 2 min with 10 μm [14C]penicillin G in Hepes 20 mm, EDTA 1 mm, pH 7.4. 1 μl of penicillinase from Bacillus cereus (Sigma) was added at a concentration such that the remaining free penicillin is hydrolyzed in a few seconds. At various times, 15-μl aliquots were removed, and the deacylation was stopped by the addition of 0.5 volumes of SDS-PAGE denaturing buffer (0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 20% glycerol) and immediate freezing at −80 °C. Reaction mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE, gels were dried and exposed for 4 days to the CS screen of a PhosphorImager (GS 525 Molecular Imager System; Bio-Rad), and the quantity of radioactive protein was measured with Molecular Analyst software, version 1.4 (Bio-Rad). The optimized k3 constants were determined by fitting an exponential to the experimental points. Acylation reactions were performed by mixing 2 μm [14C]penicillin G with 3 μm protein in 20 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. Every 10 s, 15-μl aliquots were removed and treated using the same protocol described for deacylation. Since (k-1 + k2)/k1 (or KS) is most probably much higher than the experimental concentrations of enzyme and substrate, the acylation proceeds via a second order reaction with a rate constant kac = k1k2/(k-1 + k2). The optimized constant was extracted from the data by numerical simulation using the following differential equation, d[E−Ac]=(kac[E][S]−k3[E−Ac])dt where k3 is known from the previous deacylation experiment. β-Lactam Antibiotics Hydrolysis—All of the spectrophotometric measurements were performed with the help of a thermostated CARY 3 Bio (VARIAN analytical instruments). The time courses of the hydrolysis of the β-lactam compounds were performed in 20 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, with an enzyme concentration around 3 μm and penicillin antibiotics at 0.5 mm or cehalosporins at 0.25 mm, following the absorbance at the appropriate wavelength. The rate of the reaction was calculated by dividing the rate of absorbance decrease by the difference of extinction coefficients between the product and the substrate (penicillin G, Δϵ232 = −800 m-1·cm-1; ampicillin, Δϵ235 = −670 m-1·cm-1; amoxicillin, Δϵ235 = −780 m-1·cm-1; cephalotin, Δϵ265 =-8790 m-1·cm-1; cefotaxime, Δϵ265 = −6260 m-1·cm-1; cefoxitin, Δϵ265 = −7380 m-1·cm-1; nitrocefin, Δϵ482 = 15,000 m-1·cm-1). Primary Sequence Analysis of PBP-A Family—By searching bacterial genomes for genes encoding penicillin recognizing proteins, we identified a whole family of cyanobacterial proteins annotated as putative class A β-lactamases but with a 6-amino acids deletion in the region of the Ω-loop and missing the essential Glu166. A multiple alignment with some class A β-lactamases of known structure is shown in Fig. 1. Although the three other motifs SXXK, SDN, and K(S/T)G are conserved, the absence of Glu166 suggested that these proteins are rather PBPs than β-lactamases. Although substitutions in the Ω-loop can occur naturally, giving rise to extended spectrum lactamases (25Du Bois S.K. Marriott M.S. Amyes S.G. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1995; 35: 7-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), insertions or deletions were mainly genetically engineered in this region (26Hayes F. Hallet B. Cao Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28833-28836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 27Osuna J. Yanez J. Soberon X. Gaytan P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e136Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Only one example of a natural duplication in the Ω-loop of a class A β-lactamase has been reported (28Arpin C. Labia R. Andre C. Frigo C. El Harrif Z. Quentin C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2480-2485Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Focusing on the shorter Ω-loop of this new family of proteins reveals a consensus motif X2LP(D/E)X2GTN. A leucine is aligned with the essential Glu166 and is followed by a conserved proline in a position where a cis-proline is frequently observed in β-lactamases. The presence of a conserved glycine and the absence of the salt bridge usually found across the ω-loop of β-lactamases (R152-D167) must be important for the conformation of this short loop. For better understanding the evolutionary situation of these cyanobacterial proteins, we searched for homologous sequences in the Protein Data Bank at the NCBI Web site. In this way, we identified several other putative lactamases, most of them from recently sequenced genomes, with variations in the Ω-loop length, but all of them having the three other motifs SXXK, SXN, and K(S/T)G conserved. A multiple alignment with these proteins of unknown functions, together with some well known LMW class A and C PBPs and class A β-lactamases was generated, and a phylogenetic tree was elaborated (Fig. 2). For this purpose, raw protein sequences were manipulated. The putative Ω-loop of each protein was removed in order to prevent alignment upon the Ω-loop size that could introduce a bias. Putative sequence signal, transmembrane segments, or insertions at the extremities of the proteins, possibly introducing noise in the alignment, were also removed. Finally, large insertions from LMW class C were removed on the basis of structure comparisons with class A β-lactamases. It is important to note that LMW class A and C PBPs could only be aligned correctly when all these manipulations were done, whereas all other proteins aligned well with class A β-lactamases using the raw sequences. The alignment with LMW class A and C PBPs, on the other hand, is essentially based on the presence of the three conserved motifs of the active site. Without these elements, the homologies between these two families of proteins and all the others in the tree become unrecognizable. For this reason, the uncertainty of the branchings of both families to the rest of the tree is highlighted by the dotted lines in Fig. 2. As shown in the tree, the family of cyanobacterial proteins appears as the phylogenetically closest family to class A β-lactamases, which makes them particularly interesting. We called it the PBP-A family. Since no member of that family has been characterized so far, we decided to undertake a full biochemical study of one member. We focused on the PBP-A from T. elongatus BP-1 (NCBI accession number 22295842). Compared with β-lactamases, it is the closest member of the PBP-A family, and its thermostability makes it the most attractive protein for future protein engineering. The polypeptide deduced from the nucleotide sequence of PBP-A consists of 368 amino acids. Pairwise alignment using BLAST revealed no significant similarity with any known PBP but 29% identity (over 194 residues) with TEM-1 β-lactamase from Escherichia coli. Following Ambler numbering, the aligned β-lactamase sequence extends from Gly45 down to the K(S/T)G motif with uniformly distributed identities. With regard to the tridimensional structure, it means that the α-domain and the external strands of the β-sheet are the main elements that bring PBP-A so close to class A β-lactamases. Cloning and Expression of T. elongatus pbp-a and Mutants—Submission of the protein primary sequence to several Expasy predicting programs revealed different potential start codons, signal peptides and transmembrane segment between amino acids 1 and 92 (Fig. 3). Depending on whether the option Gram+ or Gramwas chosen, a signal sequence with cleavage site between Ala66↓Ala67 or Ala92↓Pro93, respectively, was predicted with a low score by SignalP. Proteomics studies of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 showed that in some cases, start codons for periplasmic proteins were badly assigned by CyanoBase (29Fulda S. Huang F. Nilsson F. Hagemann M. Norling B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5900-5907Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). There are several methionines in the N-terminal sequence of PBP-A, suggesting that it may be the case for this protein. We tried to express two putative full proteins, starting at the first and third methionine Met28, but in both cases protein expression was undetectable. A transmembrane segment from residue 58 to 78 was also predicted with high confidence, suggesting that the protein could be membrane-anchored, as is the case for many DD-peptidases. Hence, we decided to remove the first 92 amino acids and cloned the coding sequence from Pro93 to the C terminus in fusion with a Myc tag and a His6 tag. Soluble expression of the protein in the cytoplasm was detected, and the 33-kDa PBP-A was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” with a final yield of 0.22 mg of protein/liter of culture. All mutants were expressed under the same conditions and were obtained as pure proteins. Enzymatic Activity of PBP-A—The DD-carboxypeptidase activity was assessed by incubating PBP-A with d-Ala-d-Ala and Ac2-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala substrates. No hydrolysis of these compounds was observed at 25 °C or at 55 °C, which is the optimal growth temperature of T. elongatus. A very weak activity (v/e0 = 3.7 10-3 s-1) was detected with Ala-d-γ-Glu-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala (0.8 mm). PBP-A was also inactive on d-Ala-paranitroanilide, a substrate used for the d-aminopeptidase activity of Ochrobacterium anthropi, a member of the serine penicillin-recognizing enzyme (PRE) family (30Asano Y. Nakazawa A. Kato Y. Kondo K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14233-14239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Joris B. Ghuysen J.M. Dive G. Renard A. Dideberg O. Charlier P. Frère J.M. Kelly J.A. Boyington J.C. Moews P.C. Knox J.R. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Since the peptidoglycan composition is not known for cyanobacteria, substrates containing meso-diaminopimelic acid instead of lysine were also tested. Indeed, this is the most common variation among peptidoglycans of prokaryotes (32Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We performed qualitative assays by incubating PBP-A with Lactobacillus plantarum extracts containing cytoplasmic precursors of the peptidoglycan (i.e. UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-pentapeptides) and monitoring cleavage of the C-terminal residue by HPLC (33Ferain T. Hobbs Jr., J.N. Richardson J. Bernard N. Garmyn D. Hols P. Allen N.E. Delcour J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5431-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 34Deghorain M. Goffin P. Fontaine L. Mainardi J.L. Daniel R. Errington J. Hallet B. Hols P. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 4332-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A very weak cleavage activity was observed with UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-l-Ala-γ-d-Glu-meso-diaminopimelic acid-d-Ala-d-Ala, whereas the enzyme was significantly more active on a precursor ending with an ester-linked C-terminal d-lactate instead of the amide-linked d-alanine (data not shown). Hydrolysis of thiolester substrates at 37 °C was observed for both thioglycolates and thiolactates, with a preference for alanine-derived substrates compared with glycine (Table 1). Pha-cATl is a diastereoisomer mixture of phenylacetyl-d-alanylthio-l-lactate and phenylacetyl-d-alanyl-thio-d-lactate. Results show that PBP-A is specific for the d-alanyl group and has a marked preference for one thiolactic stereoisomer. PBP-A was also found to be very active on one enantiomer of the racemic S2d substrate, most probably the d-alanyl-thioglycolate, given the previous result on PhacATl. No activity was detected on the l-alanyl-thioglycolate isomer, indicating a strict d-stereospecificity on that carbon. A lower specificity observed with the racemic glycyl-thio-dl-lactate S2c substrate indicates a more tolerant recognition on the leaving group side. The hydrolysis efficiency of thiolester substrates is very variable among PBPs; the hydrolysis rates and kcat/Km were lower for Streptomyces K15 DD-peptidase, which is homologous to class A β-lactamases; and the catalytic activity of PBP-A was in the same range as Streptomyces R61, but the Km values were smaller (22Rhazi N.

https://openalex.org/W2113769865,"Female-biased dispersal (FBD) is predicted to occur in monogamous species due to local resource competition among females, but evidence for this association in mammals is scarce. The predicted relationship between FBD and monogamy may also be too simplistic, given that many pair-living mammals exhibit substantial extra-pair paternity.I examined whether dispersal and gene flow are female-biased in the large treeshrew (Tupaia tana) in Borneo, a behaviorally monogamous species with a genetic mating system characterized by high rates (50%) of extra-pair paternity. Genetic analyses provided evidence of FBD in this species. As predicted for FBD, I found lower mean values for the corrected assignment index for adult females than for males using seven microsatellite loci, indicating that female individuals were more likely to be immigrants. Adult female pairs were also less related than adult male pairs. Furthermore, comparison of Bayesian coalescent-based estimates of migration rates using maternally and bi-parentally inherited genetic markers suggested that gene flow is female-biased in T. tana. The effective number of migrants between populations estimated from mitochondrial DNA sequence was three times higher than the number estimated using autosomal microsatellites.These results provide the first evidence of FBD in a behaviorally monogamous species without mating fidelity. I argue that competition among females for feeding territories creates a sexual asymmetry in the costs and benefits of dispersal in treeshrews."

This 2D:4D digit ratio is often used as a proxy for prenatal androgen exposure in studies of human health and behavior. For example, 2D:4D ratio is lower (i.e. more ""masculinized"") in both men and women of greater physical fitness and/or sporting ability. Lab mice have also shown variation in 2D:4D as a function of uterine environment, and mouse digit ratios seem also to correlate with behavioral traits, including daily activity levels. Selective breeding for increased rates of voluntary exercise (wheel running) in four lines of mice has caused correlated increases in aerobic exercise capacity, circulating corticosterone level, and predatory aggression. Here, we show that this selection regime has also increased 2D:4D. This apparent ""feminization"" in mice is opposite to the relationship seen between 2D:4D and physical fitness in human beings. The present results are difficult to reconcile with the notion that 2D:4D is an effective proxy for prenatal androgen exposure; instead, it may more accurately reflect effects of glucocorticoids, or other factors that regulate any of many genes."
