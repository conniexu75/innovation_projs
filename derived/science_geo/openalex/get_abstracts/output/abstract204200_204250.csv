https://openalex.org/W1616072740,"The sonic emissions of the bottlenose dolphin are remarkably complex. Three classes of these sounds are discussed and presented graphically. The sine-type wave whistles range in frequency from about 4000 to 18,000 cycles per second. The clicks contain components of this same frequency range plus some components of higher frequencies. Complex waves of high amplitude and of many frequencies are also emitted in water or in air. Situations in which sounds of one or more of these classes can be elicited simultaneously from one and from two restrained animals are described. The necessity for, and occurrence of, creakings for purpose of navigation, ranging, and recognition (sonar) have been eliminated in the experiments under discussion."

https://openalex.org/W2042468502,"SENSITIVE ionization methods for the measurement of low gas and vapour concentration require the ionization of the test gas or vapour under conditions where an inert carrier gas is unionized. Such methods as the ionization of carbon compounds in a hydrogen flame1 and the reaction between gases and vapours and rare gas metastables2 are well established and successful for this purpose. An alternative method is to irradiate the gas mixture with ultra-violet radiation of such a frequency that photoionization of the test gas occurs without any accompanying ionization of an inert carrier gas. In practice an electrical discharge in one of the rare gases or in nitrogen or hydrogen generates photons of energy sufficient for the ionization of almost all polyatomic compounds, but with insufficient energy to ionize simple diatomic gases."
https://openalex.org/W2089154803,In the isolated retina of the bullfrog (Rana catesbiana) illumination of one part of a ganglion cell's receptive field increased the light threshold (for response by that cell) not only in the illuminated part but also in the unilluminated parts of the field. Scattered light is insufficient to account for the effect. Apparently it depends on changes in the efficiency of excitation transmission along the neural pathways from photoreceptors to ganglion cell.

https://openalex.org/W26363088,"The enzyme ribonuclrase has been studied extensively from the structural point of view. The amino acid sequence has been completely worked out (1, 2) and information about the active center has recently btcome available (3, 4). However, very few studies of the kinetics of this enzyme have been made, and most of the previous kinetic work is difficult to interpret because ribonucleic acid was used as the substrate. The use of such a complicated substrate is not conducive to the interpretation of kinetic studies because many different reactions may be occurring simultaneously. In view of the current interest in ribonucleasc, it seemed desirable to investigate the kinetics with a small, well defined substrate molecule such as cytidine-2’,3’cyclic phosphate (5). Several workers hare used pyrimidine cyclic phosphates as substrates for kin&c studies. Davis and Allen, using both cytidine and uridine-2’) 3’-cyclic phosphates, found that ribonuclease was inhibited by mononucleotides, by Cu++ and, by Zn++ (6). Hummel, Flares, and Xrlson, with the use of cytidine-2’) 3’.cyclic phosphate, measured the Michaelis constant and maximal velocity at a single pH, 6.7 (7). Vithayathil and Richards used cytidine-2’) 3’-cyclic phosphate to make measurtmerits of Michaelis constants and maximal velocities of ribonuclease and subtilisin-modified ribonuclease (8). The present paper describes a study of the kinetics of ribonuclease hydrolysis of cytidine-2’) 3’.cyclic phosphate at four different pH values. The response of the Michaclis constant and maximal velocity to changes in pH is observed and interpreted in terms of ionization of the histidine residue in the active center."

https://openalex.org/W1986845742,"MOST of the methods used for the separation of mixtures of amino-acids are based on the work of Moore et al.1–3. Separation is achieved either on two columns, acidic amino-acids being separated on a ‘Dowex’ 1 anion-exchange column and the basic and neutral amino-acids on a ‘Dowex’ 50 cation-exchange column or by chromatography on one column on ‘Dowex’ 50 in the H-cycle, elution being carried out with citrate phosphate buffer solutions. Hamilton and Anderson4 recently described a semi-automatic method for these separations containing several improvements of the original process. These methods ensure good separation of amino-acids; the eluates, however, contain either the hydrochlorides of the amino-acid and hydrochloric acid or considerable amounts of salts, which are difficult to remove. An efficient method for the separation of amino-acids should permit separation in a small volume of the elution reagent in a short time; the buffers used should be removable by a simple method. Wilcox et al.5 used volatile buffers for the separation of aspartic and glutamic acid on an anion-exchange column. Vaněček et al.6 and Tomášek7, used volatile buffers successfully for the separation of peptides on ‘Dowex’ 50."

https://openalex.org/W1991755164,"INFECTION of cultures of milk-adapted P388D 1 murine lymphoma cells with polyoma virus produces an alteration in the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) of the nucleoplasm, enlargement of the nucleolus, and intranuclear vacuoles containing abnormal RNP1. Cytochemical studies of the late stages of infection of lymphoma cells in vitro with polyoma virus failed to reveal Feulgen-positive inclusion material1. Since the infectivity, of nucleic acid preparations from cells infected with polyoma virus appears to reside in the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fraction2, further attempts have been made to demonstrate abnormal DNA and to elucidate the relationship between changes in DNA and RNA or RNP metabolism in polyoma virus infection."
https://openalex.org/W2005624155,"Many larvae of the common bivalve, Anomia simplex, when grown under laboratory conditions, exhibited a partial metamorphosis. They attained a considerably larger size than that at which larvae normally set. The partial metamorphosis was also characterized by the disappearance of velum, but the retention of a functional foot. Moreover, these organisms were not able to attach to the substratum, and their shells showed a distinct demarcation line between larval and adult portions"

https://openalex.org/W2057744949,"So far, very few reports concerning transformations in Rhizobium have appeared. Krasilnikov1 reported as early as 1941 that non-infective strains turned infective when they were grown for several months in a filtrate of a highly infective strain. By ultrasonic treatment and with preparations of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) Balassa2,3 has obtained transformations concerning several properties, for example, infective ability under formation of new host specificity, increase or decrease in nitrogen-fixing ability, variation in colony types, and changes in antigenic structure."

https://openalex.org/W1999066636,Loewe's recommendations regarding treatment of stimulus-response relations are criticized. Conditions are described where quantal analysis is justified. Loewe's interpretation of his graded analysis must be modified in the light of the fact that response curves for individuals frequently cross. Superior lines of attack on the problem are suggested.

These variability differences are paralleled in the heights of the mothers and fathers except in the case of boys who mature very early; there is far less variability in height among these boys than among their parents."
https://openalex.org/W2012599808,"THE pleuro-pneumonia-like organisms cause considerable difficulty in tissue culture work, as many lines of cell cultures are contaminated with these organisms1. I have found that members of the Pseudomonadaceae could play a part as contaminants of tissue culture. It is well known that these bacteria are frequently a source of bacterial contamination in stored blood and blood derivatives2."
