https://openalex.org/W2012839797,"Plasminogen was prepared from human plasma by affinity chromatography on L-lysine-substituted Sepharose. Thirty milligrams of plasminogen, with a specific activity of 100 caseinolytic units (Committee on Thrombolytic Agents) per milligram of nitrogen, were obtained from 340 milliliters of plasma. This corresponds to over 200-fold purification from plasma. Disc-gel electrophoresis at pH 8.3 indicated seven distinct bands, all of which contained activity."

https://openalex.org/W2036729051,"Delta(9)-Tetrahydrocannabinol (the major active component of marihuana) administered intravenously to normal human volunteers persists in plasma for more than 3 days (t(1/2) = 56 hours). Its metabolites appear in plasma within 10 minutes after administration and persist along with the precursor compound. Delta(9)-Tetrahydrocannabinol is completely metabolized in man, and the radioactive metabolites are excreted in urine and feces for more than 8 days."

However, it appears that even in the striatum enough activity remained to allow for the formation of dopamine from L-dopa in patients treated with large doses of L-dopa."

Five days later these birds were challenged with duck hepatitis virus, and they suffered significantly higher mortality than birds which were not exposed to the polychlorinated biphenyl."
https://openalex.org/W2109157282,"THE role of lower animals in the natural cycle of human strains of influenza virus transmission has been subjected to considerable speculation. With the possible exception of the report of Romvary et al.1, there are few, if any, satisfactorily authenticated cases of human influenza viral strains being isolated from naturally infected animals. That animals could be naturally infected was demonstrated when antibodies against the Asian A-2 strain were found in swine and horses after the 1957 pandemic2."
https://openalex.org/W2007123409,"Although composed of similar elements and structured similarly, the communications systems associated with the physical sciences and the social sciences differ markedly with respect to the operation and use of these elements. For both groups of disciplines, as information flows through the system it encounters lags and filtering, and much of a scientist's communication behavior is an effort to compensate for these factors. Because the lags and filtering within each system differ in loci and extent, the members of different disciplines adjust to them differently, and the overall information flow patterns in the physical and in the social sciences differ."
https://openalex.org/W2087755769,"Red blood cell catechol-O-methyltransferase, histamine-N-methyltransferase, and a methanol-forming enzyme were examined in a number of subjects with mental diseases. Catechol-O-methyltransferase activity was significantly reduced in female subjects with primary affective disorder (depression) as compared to normal women and men, men with primary affective disorder, and schizophrenic men and women. In depressed women, histamine-N-methyltransferase activity was elevated and the methanol-forming enzyme was unchanged."

https://openalex.org/W2005527892,"POINTING out the structural similarity between uric acid and the stimulant purines caffeine and theophylline, Orowan1 first proposed that the emergence of intelligence in the primate line might arise from a single evolutionary event, the loss of the enzyme uricase, with the result that uric acid became the end product of purine metabolism. The only non-primate mammalian strain whose final purine metabolite is uric acid is the Dalmatian dog."

https://openalex.org/W1966958074,"Morphine sulfate increased the incorporation of carbon-14-labeled tyrosine into labeled catecholamines in the mouse brain. Tolerance was manifested by a shift to the right in the dose-response curve for morphine after mice were treated repeatedly with morphine. Naloxone, a specific morphine antagonist, also shifted the dose-response curve for morphine to the right."
https://openalex.org/W2089724579,"The fossil evidence on the evolution of brains and bodies in mammals shows that there has been a progressive increase in relative brain size accompanied by and correlated with increased diversity among species in relative brain size. Small-brained species have also evolved, but more large-brained species have appeared in successive epochs."
https://openalex.org/W2039777413,"During electrophoresis on acrylamide gel 30 to 45 percent of the protein of hepatic microsomal membranes migrates as a single band corresponding to a molecular weight of 52,000. Rough and smooth microsomal membranes exhibit essentially identical electrophoretic patterns. Different findings by previous workers may be the result of contamination of the membranes by adsorbed and entrapped nonmembrane protein."
https://openalex.org/W2024565681,"Hair from a woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius, age about 32,000 years) retains the ordered structure characteristic of Î±-keratins, but the proteins of this hair differ in composition from and are smaller than similar proteins isolated from other keratins, for example, elephant hair. It is suggested that these changes have been caused by limited proteolysis."

https://openalex.org/W2074592663,"Oxidative phosphorylation was studied in isolated liver mitochondria from manganese-deficient mice and in those from a mutant strain, pallid. In mitochondria from manganese-deficient mice, ratios of adenosine triphosphate formed to oxygen consumed were normal, but oxygen uptake was reduced. Electron microscopy of these mitochondria revealed ultrastructural abnormalities including elongation and reorientation of cristae. No biochemical or structural abnormalities were found in mitochondria from pallid mice."

https://openalex.org/W2005884551,"A scanning spectrometer with lithium fluoride, ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, and gypsum crystals was used to detect the x-ray spectrum of a normal centriole, the transmitted electron image of which was used to focus the exciting electron beam to the size, shape, and position of the centriole in a 700-angstrom section of intact tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2018368895,"The antimalarials quinine, chloroquine, primaquine, and quinacrine inhibited the uptake and incorporation of amino acids in vivo, but these drugs had considerably less effect on cell-free protein synthesis. The results indicate that the primary effect of the four drugs on protein synthesis is blocking of amino acid uptake by the cells."

https://openalex.org/W1608146040,"Abstract The rate of l-serine biosynthesis from 3-phosphoglycerate by rat liver soluble fractions was found to be directly proportional to the activity of 3-P-glycerate dehydrogenase in the extracts. This relationship was observed in rats fed a low protein diet, in rats fed a low protein diet supplemented with 2% methionine, and in rats given intraperitoneal injections of cortisone acetate. The mechanisms of change in hepatic 3-P-glycerate dehydrogenase activity in response to dietary or hormonal influences were evaluated by kinetic analysis of the transition between steady state levels of the enzyme. These dietary and hormonal alterations did not result in large changes in the estimated turnover of hepatic 3-P-glycerate dehydrogenase. The higher enzyme level in rats fed low protein diets was attributed to an 11-fold increase in estimated enzyme synthetic rate. Supplementation of the low protein diet with 2% methionine or cortisone acetate administration reduces the stimulatory effect of the low protein diet on the rate of synthesis of rat liver 3-P-glycerate dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W120090402,"Insufficient use has been made of ecological data concerning potential hosts in studies to determine the life cycles of zoonotic parasites and pathogens. Factors such as the geographical distribution of hosts, the altitudes at which they live, their affinities for specific habitats, their vertical distribution within the habitat, and the periodicity of their activities have bearing on the hosts' predisposition to involvement in disease cycles. Diets and feeding habits may determine the likelihood of acquiring infection. Reproductive characteristics determine whether a species is suitable as a reservoir or as an amplifying host. Behavioral factors, such as selection of a particular kind of nest site, may also predispose the involvement of the host with parasites and pathogens. Behavior patterns may determine the maximum population densities of hosts. Estimates of population sizes, of relative abundances of species, and of the involvement of species in disease cycles may be strongly influenced by the collecting and sampling methods that are used and also by the behavioral response of the mammals toward collecting devices, such as traps."
https://openalex.org/W2030542094,"Homogenates of HeLa cells contain neuraminidase activity. This enzyme is particle-bound, and it has a pH optimum of 4.2. Hydrocortisone-regulated cells contain two to three times as much neuraminidase as the corresponding controls. The hydrocortisone treatment also causes an increase in the cell content of Î²-glucuronidase and acid deoxyribonuclease."
https://openalex.org/W2026853604,"Doses of hemicholinium-3 which partially paralyze the larval salamander profoundly retarded regeneration of the amputated hind limb. The drug also reduced the vascularity and mitotic index of the regenerating tissue. After withdrawal of the drug the rate of regeneration returned to normal. Atropine, in a daily dose of 40 milligrams per kilogram of body weight, did not retard growth. These findings suggest that in the salamander acetylcholine may mediate neurotrophic activity."

https://openalex.org/W2158834602,"Total cholesterol concentrations in muscle, liver, and plasma do not differ significantly between adult male C57BL/10J and DBA/2J mice. In the adrenal glands of these two strains, of their hybrids, and of AC mice, concentrations of free cholesterol vary by 5 percent. Adrenals from C57 mice, however, contain six times as much esterified cholesterol as adrenals from AC or DBA mice. The intermediate concentrations of cholesterol esters in F(1) hybrids suggest that the difference in this measure is inherited additively. The finding of variation in adrenal cholesterol within a species is useful for the further study of the role of cholesterol in steroidogenesis by means of genetic analysis."
