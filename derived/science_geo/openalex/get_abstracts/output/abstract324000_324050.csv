https://openalex.org/W2157686400,Tissues of a mytilid mussel from the Clambake I hydrothermal vent in the Gal√°pagos Rift zone are strikingly depleted in carbon-13 relative to the tissues of other marine organisms. The stable carbon isotope composition of this mussel suggests that chemoautotrophic bacteria present in the hydrothermal waters are a major food source for filter-feeding organisms in this abyssal environment.
https://openalex.org/W2070236696,"Little Salt Spring in southwest Florida, consisting of a shallow, water-filled basin above a deep, vertical underwater cavern, was a freshwater cenote in the peninsula's drier past. It collected and preserved perishable organic artifacts and other evidence of Paleo-Indian and Archaic Indian origin ranging in age from 12,000 to 9000 and from 6800 to 5200 years ago. An Archaic Period cemetery containing an estimated 1000 burials occupies an adjoining muck-filled slough and presently drowned portions of the basin of the spring. Artifacts and the nature of interment suggest a cultural link between the Archaic people and the much later Glades Tradition of southern Florida."
https://openalex.org/W2086707809,"Analysis of the clone structures within a population of Spartina patens reveals considerable adaptive genetic divergence among adjacent dune, swale, and marsh sites. The dune subpopulation includes a small number of frequently encountered, spatially isolated clones that follow microtopography and have high reproductive output and colonizing potential. The marsh subpopulation consists of a large number of infrequent interdigitating clones with high vegetative biomass and competitive success. The swale subpopulation is generally intermediate for these traits."

The cycling, which coincides with the annual periods of thermal stratification in this monomictic lake, has been occurring for over 10 years."
https://openalex.org/W2001975904,A source for certain low-frequency seismic waves is postulated in terms of the water hammer effect. The time-dependent displacement of a water-filled subglacial conduit is analyzed to demonstrate the nature of the source. Preliminary energy calculations and the observation of hydraulically generated seismic radiation from a dam indicate the plausibility of the proposed source.
https://openalex.org/W2077867391,"Experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that the concentration and distribution of dissolved aluminum in ocean water are controlled by biological activity in the surface waters. The growth of the diatom Skeletonema costatum in artificial seawater media spiked with aluminum reduced the aluminum concentration to that actually found in surface open ocean waters (about 0.5 micrograms per liter). Furthermore, aluminum had a catalytic and limiting effect on the growth of the diatoms."
https://openalex.org/W2074109771,"Spectrophotometric observations of the jovian satellite Io on 20 and 21 February 1978 (Universal Time) were made from 1.2 to 5.4 micrometers. Io's brightness at 4.7 to 5.4 micrometers was found to be three to five times greater at an orbital phase angle of 68 degrees than at orbital phase angles of 23 degrees (5.5 hours before the brightening) and 240 degrees (20 hours after the brightening). Since the 5-micrometer albedo of Io is near unity under ordinary conditions, the observed transient phenomenon must have been the result of an emission mechanism. Although several such mechanisms were examined, the actual choice is not clear."

A possible solution is suggested by records showing that fish catches are best where predator populations have been reduced by fishing. It may be possible to remedy overfishing by increasing fishing effort, provided the additional effort is directed toward predators."

https://openalex.org/W2001546194,"From the spacing of internal wave packets generated by tidal flow over topography, one can determine their propagation speed. The propagation speed depends upon the density anomaly and depth of the upper mixed layer. Attributing the density anomaly to temperature only, one can calculate the heat storage in the upper oceanic layer. On the basis of Landsat images of the New England continental shelf, the heat storage calculated from satellite data has been compared with available in situ observations. The data show that the method may have merit and is deserving of further refinement."
