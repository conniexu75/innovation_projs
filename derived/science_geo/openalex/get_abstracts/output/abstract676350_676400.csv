https://openalex.org/W3174731125,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants with multiple spike mutations enable increased transmission and antibody resistance. We combined cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), binding, and computational analyses to study variant spikes, including one that was involved in transmission between minks and humans, and others that originated and spread in human populations. All variants showed increased angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding and increased propensity for receptor binding domain (RBD)-up states. While adaptation to mink resulted in spike destabilization, the B.1.1.7 (UK) spike balanced stabilizing and destabilizing mutations. A local destabilizing effect of the RBD E484K mutation was implicated in resistance of the B.1.1.28/P.1 (Brazil) and B.1.351 (South Africa) variants to neutralizing antibodies. Our studies revealed allosteric effects of mutations and mechanistic differences that drive either interspecies transmission or escape from antibody neutralization."
https://openalex.org/W3177428124,"Several fast-spreading variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have become the dominant circulating strains in the COVID-19 pandemic. We report here cryo-electron microscopy structures of the full-length spike (S) trimers of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants, as well as their biochemical and antigenic properties. Amino acid substitutions in the B.1.1.7 protein increase both the accessibility of its receptor binding domain and the binding affinity for receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The enhanced receptor engagement may account for the increased transmissibility. The B.1.351 variant has evolved to reshape antigenic surfaces of the major neutralizing sites on the S protein, making it resistant to some potent neutralizing antibodies. These findings provide structural details on how SARS-CoV-2 has evolved to enhance viral fitness and immune evasion."

Although appropriate preventive measures are the most important interventions to prevent coronavirus infection among healthcare workers, they are also highly concerned about the consequences of the pandemic. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess preventive practices, perceived risk and worry about COVID-19 crisis among healthcare professionals at six public hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A systematic random sampling technique was used to select 1,134 respondents (52.6% females). Data were collected between 9 th and 20 th June 2020 using self-administered questionnaires. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with worry about COVID-19 crisis. The highest percentage of respondents were nurses (39.3%) and physicians (22.2%), followed by interns (10.8%) and midwives (10.3%). Wearing facemask (93%) and frequent hand washing (93%) were the commonly reported preventive practices. Perceived risk of becoming infected with coronavirus (88%) and the potential risk of infection to their family (91%) were very high. The mean (median) worry score about COVID-19 crisis was 2.37 (3.0), on 1 to 3 scale, with 1 (not worried) and 3 (highly worried). The majority worried a lot about the health system being overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients (92%), the health of their loved ones (90%) and losing someone due to COVID-19 (89%). Respondents who had previously provided clinical care to Ebola, SARS and cholera patients had significantly lower levels of worry about COVID-19 crisis than participants who had not (β = -1.38, P &lt;0.001). Our findings reveal respondents’ widespread practice of preventive measures, highest levels of perceived risk and worry about the COVID-19 crisis. Increased perceived risk and worry about COVID-19 might enable healthcare workers to adopt appropriate preventive measures more effectively against the disease."

https://openalex.org/W3176264499,"The predominant approach for antibody generation remains animal immunization, which can yield exceptionally selective and potent antibody clones owing to the powerful evolutionary process of somatic hypermutation. However, animal immunization is inherently slow, not always accessible and poorly compatible with many antigens. Here, we describe 'autonomous hypermutation yeast surface display' (AHEAD), a synthetic recombinant antibody generation technology that imitates somatic hypermutation inside engineered yeast. By encoding antibody fragments on an error-prone orthogonal DNA replication system, surface-displayed antibody repertoires continuously mutate through simple cycles of yeast culturing and enrichment for antigen binding to produce high-affinity clones in as little as two weeks. We applied AHEAD to generate potent nanobodies against the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, a G-protein-coupled receptor and other targets, offering a template for streamlined antibody generation at large."
https://openalex.org/W3176317418,"In classical theories of cerebellar cortex, high-dimensional sensorimotor representations are used to separate neuronal activity patterns, improving associative learning and motor performance. Recent experimental studies suggest that cerebellar granule cell (GrC) population activity is low-dimensional. To examine sensorimotor representations from the point of view of downstream Purkinje cell ‘decoders’, we used three-dimensional acousto-optic lens two-photon microscopy to record from hundreds of GrC axons. Here we show that GrC axon population activity is high dimensional and distributed with little fine-scale spatial structure during spontaneous behaviors. Moreover, distinct behavioral states are represented along orthogonal dimensions in neuronal activity space. These results suggest that the cerebellar cortex supports high-dimensional representations and segregates behavioral state-dependent computations into orthogonal subspaces, as reported in the neocortex. Our findings match the predictions of cerebellar pattern separation theories and suggest that the cerebellum and neocortex use population codes with common features, despite their vastly different circuit structures. By recording from hundreds of cerebellar granule cell axons with three-dimensional two-photon calcium imaging, Lanore et al. show that population activity is high-dimensional and that quiet wakeful and active states are orthogonally arranged in neuronal activity space."

https://openalex.org/W3177289604,"The clinical benefits of pan-mTOR active-site inhibitors are limited by toxicity and relief of feedback inhibition of receptor expression. To address these limitations, we designed a series of compounds that selectively inhibit mTORC1 and not mTORC2. These 'bi-steric inhibitors' comprise a rapamycin-like core moiety covalently linked to an mTOR active-site inhibitor. Structural modification of these components modulated their affinities for their binding sites on mTOR and the selectivity of the bi-steric compound. mTORC1-selective compounds potently inhibited 4EBP1 phosphorylation and caused regressions of breast cancer xenografts. Inhibition of 4EBP1 phosphorylation was sufficient to block cancer cell growth and was necessary for maximal antitumor activity. At mTORC1-selective doses, these compounds do not alter glucose tolerance, nor do they relieve AKT-dependent feedback inhibition of HER3. Thus, in preclinical models, selective inhibitors of mTORC1 potently inhibit tumor growth while causing less toxicity and receptor reactivation as compared to pan-mTOR inhibitors."

https://openalex.org/W3174909509,"Oligonucleotide-based aptamers, which have a three-dimensional structure with a single-stranded fragment, feature various characteristics with respect to size, toxicity, and permeability. Accordingly, aptamers are advantageous in terms of diagnosis and treatment and are materials that can be produced through relatively simple experiments. Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) is one of the most widely used experimental methods for generating aptamers; however, it is highly expensive and time-consuming. To reduce the related costs, recent studies have used in silico approaches, such as aptamer-protein interaction (API) classifiers that use sequence patterns to determine the binding affinity between RNA aptamers and proteins. Some of these methods generate candidate RNA aptamer sequences that bind to a target protein, but they are limited to producing candidates of a specific size. In this study, we present a machine learning approach for selecting candidate sequences of various sizes that have a high binding affinity for a specific sequence of a target protein. We applied the Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) algorithm for generating the candidate sequences using a score function based on an API classifier. The tree structure that we designed with MCTS enables nucleotide sequence sampling, and the obtained sequences are potential aptamer candidates. We performed a quality assessment using the scores of docking simulations. Our validation datasets revealed that our model showed similar or better docking scores in ZDOCK docking simulations than the known aptamers. We expect that our method, which is size-independent and easy to use, can provide insights into searching for an appropriate aptamer sequence for a target protein during the simulation step of SELEX."
https://openalex.org/W3177080859,"More than half of the world's population lives in areas at risk for dengue virus infection. A vaccine will be pivotal to controlling spread, however, the only licensed vaccine, Dengvaxia, has been shown to increase the risk of severe disease in a subset of individuals. Vaccine efforts are hampered by a poor understanding of antibody responses, including those generated by vaccines, and whether antibody titers can be used as a marker of protection from infection or disease. Here we present the results of an ancillary study to a phase III vaccine study (n = 611). All participants received three doses of either Dengvaxia or placebo and were followed for 6 years. We performed neutralization tests on annual samples and during confirmed dengue episodes (n = 16,508 total measurements). We use mathematical models to reconstruct long-term antibody responses to vaccination and natural infection, and to identify subclinical infections. There were 87 symptomatic infections reported, and we estimated that there were a further 351 subclinical infections. Cumulative vaccine efficacy was positive for both subclinical and symptomatic infection, although the protective effect of the vaccine was concentrated in the first 3 years following vaccination. Among individuals with the same antibody titer, we found no difference between the risk of subsequent infection or disease between placebo and vaccine recipients, suggesting that antibody titers are a good predictor of both protection and disease risk."
https://openalex.org/W3177085171,"There is high level policy consensus in India that community engagement (CE) improves vaccination uptake and reduces burden of vaccine preventable diseases. However, to date, vaccination studies in the country have not explicitly focused on CE as an outcome in and of itself. Therefore, this study sought to examine the barriers and enablers of community engagement for vaccination in India.Employing qualitative methods, twenty-five semi-structured elite interviews among vaccine decisionmakers' were triangulated with twenty-four national-level vaccine policy documents and researcher field notes (December 2017 to February 2018). Data collected for this study included perceptions and examples of enablers of and barriers to CE for vaccination uptake. Concepts, such as the absence of formal procedures or data collection approaches related to CE, were confirmed during document review, and a final convening to review study results was conducted with study respondents in December 2018 and January 2019 to affirm the general set of findings from this study. The Social Ecological Model (SEM) was used to organize and interpret the study findings.Although decisionmakers and policy documents generally supported CE, there were more CE barriers than facilitators in the context of vaccination, which were identified at all social-ecological levels. Interviews with vaccine decisionmakers in India revealed complex systemic and structural factors which affect CE for vaccination and are present across each of the SEM levels, from individual to policy. Policy-level enablers included decisionmakers' political will for CE and policy documents and interviews highlighted social mobilization, whereas barriers were lack of a CE strategy document and a broad understanding of CE by decisionmakers. At the community level, dissemination of Social-behavioral Change Communication (SBCC) materials from the national-level to the states was considered a CE facilitator, while class, and caste-based power relations in the community, lack of family-centric CE strategies, and paternalistic attitude of decisionmakers toward communities (the latter reported by some NGO heads) were considered CE barriers. At the organizational level, partnerships with local organizations were considered CE enablers, while lack of institutionalized support to formalize and incentivize these partnerships highlighted by several decisionmakers, were barriers. At the interpersonal level, SBCC training for healthcare workers, sensitive messaging to communities with low vaccine confidence, and social media messaging were considered CE facilitators. The lack of strategies to manage vaccine related rumors or replicate successful CE interventions during the during the introduction and rollout of new vaccines were perceived as CE barriers by several decisionmakers.Data obtained for this study highlighted national-level perceptions of the complexities and challenges of CE across the entire SEM, from individual to systemic levels. Future studies should attempt to associate these enablers and barriers with actual CE outcomes, such as participation or community support in vaccine policy-making, CE implementation for specific vaccines and situations (such as disease outbreaks), or frequency of sub-population-based incidents of community resistance and community facilitation to vaccination uptake. There would likely be value in developing a population-based operational definition of CE, with a step-by-step manual on 'how to do CE.' The data from this study also indicate the importance of including CE indicators in national datasets and developing a compendium documenting CE best-practices. Doing so would allow more rigorous analysis of the evidence-base for CE for vaccination in India and other countries with similar immunization programs."
https://openalex.org/W3174757338,"Ammonia is considered the main pathogenic toxin in hepatic encephalopathy (HE). However, the molecular mechanisms involved have been disputed. As altered glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission has been reported in HE, we investigated whether four members of the solute carrier 38 (Slc38) family of amino acid transporters—involved in the replenishment of glutamate and GABA—contribute to ammonia neurotoxicity in HE. We show that ammonium ion exerts multiple actions on the Slc38 transporters: It competes with glutamine for the binding to the system N transporters Slc38a3 and Slc38a5, consequently inhibiting bidirectional astroglial glutamine transport. It also competes with H+, Na+, and K+ for uncoupled permeation through the same transporters, which may perturb astroglial intracellular pH, membrane potential, and K+-buffering. Knockdown of Slc38a3 in mice results in cerebral cortical edema and disrupted neurotransmitter synthesis mimicking events contributing to HE development. Finally, in a mouse model of acute liver failure (ALF), we demonstrate the downregulation of Slc38a3 protein, impeded astroglial glutamine release, and cytotoxic edema. Altogether, we demonstrate contribution of Slc38 transporters to the ammonia-induced impairment of glutamine recycling between astrocytes and neurons, a phenomenon underlying acute ammonia neurotoxicity in the setting of ALF."
https://openalex.org/W3175382711,"Since 2014, stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD) has contributed to substantial declines of reef-building corals in Florida. The emergence of this disease, which impacts over 20 scleractinian coral species, has generated a need for widespread reef monitoring and the implementation of novel survey and disease mitigation strategies. This study paired SCTLD prevalence assessments with colony-level monitoring to help improve understanding of disease dynamics on both individual coral colonies and at reef-wide scales. Benthic surveys were conducted throughout the northern Florida Reef Tract to monitor the presence/absence of disease, disease prevalence, and coral species affected by SCTLD. Observed SCTLD prevalence was lower in Jupiter and Palm Beach than in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea or St. Lucie Reef, but there were no significant changes in prevalence over time. To assess colony-level impacts of the disease, we optimized a low-cost, rapid 3D photogrammetry technique to fate-track infected Montastraea cavernosa coral colonies over four time points spanning nearly four months. Total colony area and healthy tissue area on fate-tracked colonies decreased significantly over time. However disease lesion area did not decrease over time and was not correlated with total colony area. Taken together these results suggest that targeted intervention efforts on larger colonies may maximize preservation of coral cover. Traditional coral surveys combined with 3D photogrammetry can provide greater insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics and impacts of coral diseases on individual colonies and coral communities than surveys or visual estimates of disease progression alone."
https://openalex.org/W3176524753,"In areas of low and unstable transmission, malaria cases occur in populations with lower access to malaria services and interventions, and in groups with specific malaria risk exposures often away from the household. In support of the Namibian National Vector Borne Disease Program's drive to better target interventions based upon risk, we implemented a health facility-based case control study aimed to identify risk factors for symptomatic malaria in Zambezi Region, northern Namibia. A total of 770 febrile individuals reporting to 6 health facilities and testing positive by rapid diagnostic test (RDT) between February 2015 and April 2016 were recruited as cases; 641 febrile individuals testing negative by RDT at the same health facilities through June 2016 were recruited as controls. Data on socio-demographics, housing construction, overnight travel, use of malaria prevention and outdoor behaviors at night were collected through interview and recorded on a tablet-based questionnaire. Remotely-sensed environmental data were extracted for geo-located village residence locations. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify risk factors and latent class analyses (LCA) used to identify and characterize high-risk subgroups. The majority of participants (87% of cases and 69% of controls) were recruited during the 2016 transmission season, an outbreak year in Southern Africa. After adjustment, cases were more likely to be cattle herders (Adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR): 4.46 95%CI 1.05-18.96), members of the police or other security personnel (aOR: 4.60 95%CI: 1.16-18.16), and pensioners/unemployed persons (aOR: 2.25 95%CI 1.24-4.08), compared to agricultural workers (most common category). Children (aOR 2.28 95%CI 1.13-4.59) and self-identified students were at higher risk of malaria (aOR: 4.32 95%CI 2.31-8.10). Other actionable risk factors for malaria included housing and behavioral characteristics, including traditional home construction and sleeping in an open structure (versus modern structure: aOR: 2.01 95%CI 1.45-2.79 and aOR: 4.76 95%CI: 2.14-10.57); cross border travel in the prior 30 days (aOR: 10.55 95%CI 2.94-37.84); and outdoor agricultural work at night (aOR: 2.09 95%CI 1.12-3.87). Malaria preventive activities were all protective and included personal use of an insecticide treated net (ITN) (aOR: 0.61 95%CI 0.42-0.87), adequate household ITN coverage (aOR: 0.63 95%CI 0.42-0.94), and household indoor residual spraying (IRS) in the past year (versus never sprayed: (aOR: 0.63 95%CI 0.44-0.90). A number of environmental factors were associated with increased risk of malaria, including lower temperatures, higher rainfall and increased vegetation for the 30 days prior to diagnosis and residing more than 5 minutes from a health facility. LCA identified six classes of cases, with class membership strongly correlated with occupation, age and select behavioral risk factors. Use of ITNs and IRS coverage was similarly low across classes. For malaria elimination these high-risk groups will need targeted and tailored intervention strategies, for example, by implementing alternative delivery methods of interventions through schools and worksites, as well as the use of specific interventions that address outdoor transmission."
https://openalex.org/W3175727668,"Globally, about 810 women die every day due to pregnancy and its related complications. Although the death of women during pregnancy or childbirth has declined from 342 deaths to 211 deaths per 100,000 live births between 2000 and 2017, maternal mortality is still higher, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where 86% of all deaths occur.A secondary analysis was carried out using the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey. A sample total of 4,290 women who had a live birth in the 5 years preceding the survey was included in the analysis. GIS software was used to explore the spatial distribution of unskilled birth attendance in Ghana. The Geographic Weighted Regression (GWR) was employed to model the spatial relationship of some predictor of unskilled birth attendance. Moreover, a multilevel binary logistic regression model was fitted to identify factors associated with unskilled birth attendance.In this study, unskilled birth attendance had spatial variations across the country. The hotspot, cluster and outlier analysis identified the concerned districts in the north-eastern part of Ghana. The GWR analysis identified different predictors of unskilled birth attendance across districts of Ghana. In the multilevel analysis, mothers with no education, no health insurance coverage, and mothers from households with lower wealth status had higher odds of unskilled birth attendance. Being multi and grand multiparous, perception of distance from the health facility as not a big problem, urban residence, women residing in communities with medium and higher poverty level had lower odds of unskilled birth attendance.Unskilled birth attendance had spatial variations across the country. Areas with high levels of unskilled birth attendance had mothers who had no formal education, not health insured, mothers from poor households and communities, primiparous women, mothers from remote and border districts could get special attention in terms of allocation of resources including skilled human power, and improved access to health facilities."
https://openalex.org/W3175255638,"Lung inflammation and impaired alveolarization are hallmarks of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We hypothesize that human amnion epithelial cells (hAECs) are anti-inflammatory and reduce lung injury in preterm lambs born after antenatal exposure to inflammation.Pregnant ewes received either intra-amniotic lipopolysaccharide (LPS, from E.coli 055:B5; 4mg) or saline (Sal) on day 126 of gestation. Lambs were delivered by cesarean section at 128 d gestation (term ~150 d). Lambs received intravenous hAECs (LPS/hAECs: n = 7; 30x106 cells) or equivalent volumes of saline (LPS/Sal, n = 10; or Sal/Sal, n = 9) immediately after birth. Respiratory support was gradually de-escalated, aimed at early weaning from mechanical ventilation towards unassisted respiration. Lung tissue was collected 1 week after birth. Lung morphology was assessed and mRNA levels for inflammatory mediators were measured.Respiratory support required by LPS/hAEC lambs was not different to Sal/Sal or LPS/Sal lambs. Lung tissue:airspace ratio was lower in the LPS/Sal compared to Sal/Sal lambs (P<0.05), but not LPS/hAEC lambs. LPS/hAEC lambs tended to have increased septation in their lungs versus LPS/Sal (P = 0.08). Expression of inflammatory cytokines was highest in LPS/hAECs lambs.Postnatal administration of a single dose of hAECs stimulates a pulmonary immune response without changing ventilator requirements in preterm lambs born after intrauterine inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W3176693591,"Volumetric muscle loss (VML) injuries result in a non-recoverable loss of muscle tissue and function due to trauma or surgery. Reductions in physical activity increase the risk of metabolic comorbidities over time, and it is likely that VML may reduce whole-body activity. However, these aspects remain uncharacterized following injury. Our goal was to characterize the impact of VML on whole-body physical activity and metabolism, and to further investigate possible muscle-specific metabolic changes. Adult male C57Bl/6J (n = 28) mice underwent a standardized VML injury to the posterior compartment of the hind limb, or served as injury naïve controls. Mice underwent longitudinal evaluation of whole-body physical activity and metabolism in specialized cages up to three times over the course of 8 weeks. At terminal time points of 4- and 8-weeks post-VML in vivo muscle function of the posterior compartment was evaluated. Additionally, the gastrocnemius muscle was collected to understand histological and biochemical changes in the muscle remaining after VML. The VML injury did not alter the physical activity of mice. However, there was a noted reduction in whole-body metabolism and diurnal fluctuations between lipid and carbohydrate oxidation were also reduced, largely driven by lower carbohydrate utilization during active hours. Following VML, muscle-specific changes indicate a decreased proportion of fast (i.e., type IIb and IIx) and a greater proportion of slow (i.e., type I and IIa) fibers. However, there were minimal changes in the capillarity and metabolic biochemical activity properties of the gastrocnemius muscle, suggesting a miss-match in capacity to support the physiologic needs of the fibers. These novel findings indicate that following VML, independent of changes in physical activity, there is whole-body diurnal metabolic inflexibility. Supporting future investigations into the chronic and overlooked co-morbidities of VML injury."
https://openalex.org/W3176814876,"Without treatment, prediabetic women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at greater risk for developing type 2 diabetes compared with women without a history of GDM. Both intensive lifestyle intervention and metformin can reduce risk. To predict risk and treatment response, we developed a risk prediction model specifically for women with prior GDM.The Diabetes Prevention Program was a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of intensive lifestyle intervention, metformin (850mg twice daily), and placebo in preventing diabetes. Data from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) was used to conduct a secondary analysis to evaluate 11 baseline clinical variables of 317 women with prediabetes and a self-reported history of GDM to develop a 3-year diabetes risk prediction model using Cox proportional hazards regression. Reduced models were explored and compared with the main model.Within three years, 82 (25.9%) women developed diabetes. In our parsimonious model using 4 of 11 clinical variables, higher fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1C were each associated with greater risk for diabetes (each hazard ratio approximately 1.4), and there was an interaction between treatment arm and BMI suggesting that metformin was more effective relative to no treatment for BMI ≥ 35kg/m2 than BMI < 30kg/m2. The model had fair discrimination (bias corrected C index = 0.68) and was not significantly different from our main model using 11 clinical variables. The estimated incidence of diabetes without treatment was 37.4%, compared to 20.0% with intensive lifestyle intervention or metformin treatment for women with a prior GDM.A clinical prediction model was developed for individualized decision making for prediabetes treatment in women with prior GDM."
https://openalex.org/W3175584485,"Background Evidence for optimal hemostatic resuscitation in postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is lacking. Liberal fluid administration may result in acidosis, hypothermia and coagulopathy. Objective We hypothesize that in early PPH a restrictive fluid administration results in less progression to moderate PPH. Study design In four Dutch hospitals we recruited women of 18 years and over, and more than 24 weeks pregnant. Exclusion criteria were: anticoagulant therapy, known coagulation disorders, pre-eclampsia, antenatal diagnosis of abnormally adhesive placenta, and a contraindication for liberal fluid therapy. We blindly randomized participants at 500 mL and ongoing blood loss in the third stage of labor between restrictive fluid administration (clear fluids 0.75–1.0 times the volume of blood lost) and liberal fluid administration (clear fluids 1.5–2.0 times the volume of blood lost). The primary outcome was progression to more than 1000 mL blood loss. Analyses were according to the intention-to-treat principle. Results From August 2014 till September 2019, 5190 women were informed of whom 1622 agreed to participate. A total of 252 women were randomized of which 130 were assigned to the restrictive group and 122 to the liberal group. In the restrictive management group 51 of the 130 patients (39.2%) progressed to more than 1000 mL blood loss versus 61 of the 119 patients (51.3%) in the liberal management group (difference, -12.0% [95%-CI -24.3% to 0.3%], p = 0.057). There was no difference in the need for blood transfusion, coagulation parameters, or in adverse events between the groups. Conclusions Although a restrictive fluid resuscitation in women with mild PPH could not been proven to be superior, it does not increase the need for blood transfusion, alter coagulation parameters, or cause a rise in adverse events. It can be considered as an alternative treatment option to liberal fluid resuscitation. Trial registration NTR3789 ."

Changepoint detection analysis was used to assess temporal trends. Risk factors associated with seropositivity were determined by multivariable logistic regression.CMV seroprevalence in T1 of pregnancy was 23.4% (965/4111, 95% CI, 22.1-24.7%). The incidence rate for CMV primary infection during pregnancy was 1.8 (95% CI, 1.2-2.6) per 100 person-years. No changepoint was identified in the maternal CMV-seroprevalence trend. Multivariable analyses showed that T1 maternal CMV seropositivity was associated with having one child OR 1.3 (95% CI, 1.10-1.73) or two or more children OR 1.5 (95%CI, 1.1-2.1), ethnicity other than Caucasian OR 2.1 (95% CI, 1.1-3.8) and country of birth other than Canada and the USA OR 2.8 (95% CI, 1.5-4.9).In this cohort, maternal seroprevalence in T1 of pregnancy and seroconversion rate were low.

It is reasonable to focus on the total occupancy of subgingival plaque-specific bacteria (SUBP bacteria), which live in subgingival environments, in the saliva for detecting periodontitis using salivary testing. This study aimed to validate the clinical utility of SUBP bacteria in the salivary microbiota for the detection of periodontitis. We examined stimulated saliva samples collected from 125 subjects who visited three dental clinics. The relative abundances of previously identified 11 SUBP bacteria were determined using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and a reference-based approach. The prediction performance was evaluated using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The SUBP bacteria accounted for 0-15.4% of the salivary microbiota, and the percentage distinguished periodontitis patients with at least 15 sites with probing depth ≥4 mm with a sensitivity of 0.90 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81-0.98) and specificity of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.60-0.80) (area under the ROC curve [AUC], 0.87). Among 2,047 combinations of 11 SUBP bacteria, combinations including Streptococcus constellatus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. vincentii demonstrated significantly higher AUC values in their detection. These results suggest that examining SUBP bacteria in saliva may be useful for detecting periodontitis patients in mass screening."

We developed Tonse Pamodzi (""all of us together""), an adaptable intervention integrating biomedical and behavioral components to support HIV treatment and prevention. We describe our intervention development process, which comprised formative qualitative research, a review of the literature, and technical input from stakeholders representing the community, health systems, and policymakers. The resulting intervention, described herein, integrates patient-centered counseling and engagement of a patient-selected adherence supporter for pregnant and breastfeeding women initiating ART or PrEP. Patients receiving the intervention engage in Integrated Next Step Counseling (iNSC) sessions delivered by trained counselors to build and maintain adherence skills. Each patient also has the option of selecting an adherence supporter (partner, family member, or friend) who may participate in iNSC sessions and provide adherence support outside of these sessions. This flexible intervention is adaptable not only to ART or PrEP use, but also to the needs and preferences of each woman and the clinical context. If shown to be acceptable and feasible, the Tonse Pamodzi intervention may be an important tool in continuing efforts for EMTCT."

This study was designed to examine the spatial pattern and determinants of acquisition of sufficient knowledge of MTCT and prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) in Nigeria. The data used in the study were extracted from the 2018 Nigeria Democratic Health Survey. The spatial modeling was through a Bayesian approach with appropriate prior distributions assigned to the different parameters of the model and inference was through the integrated nested Laplace approximation technique (INLA). Results show considerable spatial variability in the acquisition of sufficient knowledge of MTCT and its prevention with women in the southwestern and southeastern part of the country having higher likelihood. The nonlinear effects findings show that acquisition of sufficient knowledge of MTCT and PMTCT increased with age of women and peaked at around age 35yearswhere it thereafter dropped drastically among the older women. Furthermore, sufficient knowledge of MTCT and PMTCT was found to be driven by ethnicity, respondents' education and wealth status."

People with spinal cord injury are at risk for secondary health conditions, with this increasing readmission rates and decreasing quality of life. Studies on preventative care for secondary health conditions and factors influencing the prevention of secondary health conditions are scarce in low to middle-income countries.To explore environmental factors influencing the prevention of secondary health conditions in people with spinal cord injury.This study was based at a public rehabilitation hospital, South Africa.Explorative qualitative design was used. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 therapists, 17 people with a spinal cord injury and six caregivers. The interviews were transcribed verbatim. Analysis was conducted using content analysis.The categories that emerged included the impact of social support, inaccessible built environment and transport system, and an inefficient health care system. Sub-categories for the inefficient health care systems were: Shortage of resources, health workers lack of knowledge on prevention of secondary health conditions and inadequate patient care approach.Environmental factors influencing the prevention of secondary health conditions are complex and multifactorial. When developing rehabilitation and prevention programmes, environmental factors must be considered."
https://openalex.org/W3176543396,"Student's academic performance is the point of interest for both the student and the academic institution in higher education. This performance can be affected by several factors and one of them is student absences. This is mainly due to the missed lectures and other class activities. Studies related to university timetabling investigate the different techniques and algorithms to design course timetables without analyzing the relationship between student attendance behavior and timetable design. This article first aimed at demonstrating the impact of absences and timetabling design on student's academic performance. Secondly, this study showed that the number of absences can be caused by three main timetable design factors: namely, (1) the number of courses per semester, (2) the average number of lectures per day and (3) the average number of free timeslots per day. This was demonstrated using Educational Data Mining on a large dataset collected from Prince Sultan University. The results showed a high prediction performance reaching 92% when predicting student's GPA based on absences and the factors related to timetabling design. High prediction performance reaching 87% was also obtained when predicting student absences based on the three timetable factors mentioned above. The results demonstrated the importance of designing course timetables in view of student absence behavior. Some suggestions were reported such as limiting the number of enrolled courses based on student's GPA, avoiding busy and almost free days and using automated timetabling to minimize the number of predicted absences. This in turn will help in generating balanced student timetables, and thus improving student academic performance."
https://openalex.org/W3176988950,"Type 2 diabetes is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide and pre-diabetes is a strong predictor of diabetes development. To date, studies estimating the prevalence of pre-diabetes in the Irish population are sparse and conflicting. Monitoring the prevalence of pre-diabetes and a knowledge of associated factors is required to inform policies and to prevent development of type 2 diabetes. Therefore, this research examined the prevalence and correlates of pre-diabetes in a sample of middle- to older-aged Irish adults using three different methods for diagnosis.The Mitchelstown Cohort Rescreen (2016/17) was a follow-up, cross-sectional study of the Mitchelstown Cohort Study (2010/11). 1,378 participants were recruited from a random sample of patients attending a single primary care centre. Pre-diabetes was defined using three diagnostic criteria: American Diabetes Association (ADA) glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) cut-offs between 5.7%-6.4% (39-46 mmol/mol), World Health Organization International Expert Committee (WHO-IEC) HbA1c cut-offs between 6.0%-6.4% (42-46 mmol/mol) and ADA fasting plasma glucose (FPG) cut-offs between 5.6-6.9 mmol/l. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to determine factors associated with pre-diabetes.The prevalence of pre-diabetes was found to be 43.9% (95% CI: 41.2%─46.5%), 14.5% (95% CI: 12.7%─16.5%) and 15.8% (95% CI: 13.9%─17.8%) according to HbA1c ADA, HbA1c WHO-IEC and FPG ADA definitions, respectively. Depending on diagnostic method, factors associated with pre-diabetes in univariate analyses included sex, age, marital status, health rating, education and poor diet quality. In multivariable analysis, subjects classified by the FPG ADA pre-diabetes criterion displayed the least optimal metabolic profile defined by overweight and obesity (OR = 2.88, 95% CI: 1.53-5.43), hypertension (OR = 2.27, 95% CI: 1.51-3.40) and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations (OR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.07-2.87).The discordance between prevalence estimates according to method of diagnosis is concerning. A National Diabetes Prevention Programme is currently being developed in Ireland. Monitoring the prevalence of pre-diabetes over time will be important to assess the effectiveness of this programme. This study will inform national decision-makers on which definition of pre-diabetes to use for monitoring purposes."
https://openalex.org/W3173425108,"Seasonal influenza vaccination uptake among young children in Thailand is low despite national recommendation for vaccination. We implemented a knowledge, attitude/perception, and practice survey to understand determinants of influenza vaccination in children aged six months to two years.Using a cross-sectional design, we interviewed caregivers of 700 children in seven hospitals using a structured questionnaire to collect information on caregivers' and children's demographic characteristics, and caregivers' knowledge of influenza illness and national vaccine recommendation, attitude/perception toward influenza vaccine, and information sources. We verified children's influenza vaccination status against medical records (vaccinated vs. unvaccinated). Logistic regression was used to examine factors independently associated with children receiving influenza vaccination in the 2018 season using the dataset restricted to only children's parents. Variables associated with vaccination at p-value ≤0.20 were included in subsequent multivariable logistic models. Significant independent determinants of children's influenza vaccination and collinearity of covariates were assessed. The final model was constructed using a stepwise backward elimination approach with variables significant at p-value <0.05 retained in the model.During August 2018-February 2019, 700 children's caregivers completed the questionnaire; 61 (9%) were caregivers of vaccinated children. Caregivers of the vaccinated children were statistically more likely to have higher education (61% vs. 38%; p-value<0.01) and to know of influenza illness (93% vs. 76%; p-value = 0.03) than those of the unvaccinated group. Factors associated with children receiving influenza vaccination were identifying healthcare providers as a primary source of information about influenza illness for parents (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-6.0), parents' strongly agreeing with the national recommendation for influenza vaccination in young children (aOR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.5-5.9), using health insurance provided by the government or parent's employer for children's doctor visits (aOR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.1-6.6), and the children's history of receiving influenza vaccination in the 2017 season or earlier (aOR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.4-7.8).The majority of caregivers of children in this study had knowledge of influenza illness and influenza vaccine. Caregivers reported various sources of information regarding influenza illness and the vaccine, but healthcare providers remained the most trusted source. Children's history of influenza vaccination in prior season(s) was the strongest determinant of children being vaccinated for influenza in the current season."
https://openalex.org/W3174087715,"Although R&D internationalization plays an important role in enterprises' globalization, few studies explore the mechanism of R&D internationalization and emerging market companies' innovation, or the relationship between R&D internationalization, domestic technology alliances and absorptive capacity. How does the R&D internationalization of emerging market enterprises affect the innovation of those enterprises? Under fierce market competition, do absorption capacity and domestic technology alliances have a significant impact on enterprise innovation? From the perspective of the knowledge-based view, this paper studies 185 enterprises undergoing R&D internationalization in China from 2012 to 2017, using high-dimensional Poisson fixed effects model, we use instrumental (HDFE IV) estimation to explain the impact of R&D internationalization on the innovation of the parent company and the mechanism behind it. The study finds that R&D internationalization positively promotes the parent company's innovation, and domestic technology alliances and absorptive capacity play a partial mediator role in R&D internationalization. In the face of fierce market competition, domestic technical alliances play a significant role in promoting enterprise innovation, while absorptive capacity plays a negative role in promoting enterprise innovation with the moderating effect of market competition."

The current study aimed to investigate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of outpatient furosemide intravenous (IV) infusion following hospitalization for ADHF.In a single center, prospective, randomized, double-blind study, 100 patients were randomized to receive standard of care (Group 1), IV placebo infusion (Group 2), or IV furosemide infusion (Group 3) over 3h, biweekly for a one-month period following ADHF hospitalization. Patients in Groups 2/3 also received a comprehensive HF-care protocol including bi-weekly clinic visits for dose-adjusted IV-diuretics, medication adjustment and education. Echocardiography, quality of life and depression questionnaires were performed at baseline and 30-day follow-up. The primary outcome was 30-day re-hospitalization for ADHF.Overall, a total of 94 patients were included in the study (mean age 64 years, 56% males, 69% African American). There were a total of 14 (15%) hospitalizations for ADHF at 30 days, 6 (17.1%) in Group 1, 7 (22.6%) in Group 2, and 1 (3.7%) in Group 3 (overall p = 0.11; p = 0.037 comparing Groups 2 and 3). Patients receiving IV furosemide infusion experienced significantly greater urine output and weight loss compared to those receiving placebo without any significant increase creatinine and no significant between group differences in echocardiography parameters, KCCQ or depression scores.The use of a standardized protocol of outpatient IV furosemide infusion for a one-month period following hospitalization for ADHF was found to be safe and efficacious in reducing 30-day re-hospitalization."
https://openalex.org/W3176355942,"Here we report the first complete mitochondrial genome of the semi-slug Omalonyx unguis (d'Orbigny, 1836) (Gastropoda: Succineidae). Sequencing was performed on a specimen from Argentina. Assembly was performed using Sanger data and Illumina next generation sequencing (NGS). The mitogenome was 13,984 bp in length and encoded the 37 typical Metazoan genes. A potential origin for mitochondrial DNA replication was found in a non-coding intergenic spacer (49 bp) located between cox3 and tRNA-Ile genes, and its secondary structure was characterized. Secondary structure models of the tRNA genes of O. unguis largely agreed with those proposed for other mollusks. Secondary structure models for the two rRNA genes were also obtained. To our knowledge, the 12S-rRNA model derived here is the first complete one available for mollusks. Phylogenetic analyses based on the mitogenomes of O. unguis and 37 other species of Stylommatophora were performed using amino acid sequences from the 13 protein-coding genes. Our results located Succineoidea as a sister group of Helicoidea + Urocoptoidea, similar to previous studies based on mitochondrial genomes. The gene arrangement of O. unguis was identical to that reported for another species of Succineoidea. The unique rearrangements observed for this group within Stylommatophora, may constitute synapomorphies for the superfamily."
https://openalex.org/W3176951453,"Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) caused by Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL)-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus (PVL-SA) are associated with recurrent skin abscesses. Secondary prevention, in conjunction with primary treatment of the infection, focuses on topical decolonization. Topical decolonization is a standard procedure in cases of recurrent PVL-SA skin infections and is recommended in international guidelines. However, this outpatient treatment is often not fully reimbursed by health insurance providers, which may interfere with successful PVL-SA decolonization.Our goal was to estimate the cost effectiveness of outpatient decolonization of patients with recurrent PVL-SA skin infections. We calculated the average cost of treatment for PVL-SA per outpatient decolonization procedure as well as per in-hospital stay.The study was conducted between 2014 and 2018 at a German tertiary care university hospital. The cohort analyzed was obtained from the hospital's microbiology laboratory database. Data on medical costs, DRG-based diagnoses, and ICD-10 patient data was obtained from the hospital's financial controlling department. We calculated the average cost of treatment for patients admitted for treatment of PVL-SA induced skin infections. The cost of outpatient treatment is based on the German regulations of drug prices for prescription drugs.We analyzed a total of n = 466 swabs from n = 411 patients with recurrent skin infections suspected of carrying PVL-SA. PVL-SA was detected in 61.3% of all patients included in the study. Of those isolates, 80.6% were methicillin-susceptible, 19.4% methicillin-resistant. 89.8% of all patients were treated as outpatients. In 73.0% of inpatients colonized with PVL-SA the main diagnosis was SSTI. The median length of stay was 5.5 days for inpatients colonized with PVL-SA whose main diagnosis SSTI; the average cost was €2,283. The estimated costs per decolonization procedure in outpatients ranged from €50-€110, depending on the products used.Our data shows that outpatient decolonization offers a highly cost-effective secondary prevention strategy, which may prevent costly inpatient treatments. Therefore, health insurance companies should consider providing coverage of outpatient treatment of recurrent PVL-SA skin and soft tissue infections."
https://openalex.org/W3177190867,"A living-donor kidney transplant (LDKT) is one of the best treatments for kidney failure. The UK's LDKT activity falls behind that of many other countries, and there is evidence of socioeconomic inequity in access. We aimed to develop a UK-specific multicomponent intervention to support eligible individuals to access a LDKT. The intervention was designed to support those who are socioeconomically-deprived and currently disadvantaged, by targeting mediators of inequity identified in earlier work. We identified three existing interventions in the literature which target these mediators: a) the Norway model (healthcare practitioners contact patients' family with information about kidney donation), b) a home education model, and c) a Transplant candidate advocate model. We undertook intervention development using the Person-Based Approach (PBA). We performed in-depth qualitative interviews with people with advanced kidney disease (n = 13), their family members (n = 4), and renal and transplant healthcare practitioners (n = 15), analysed using thematic analysis. We investigated participant views on each proposed intervention component. We drafted intervention resources and revised these in light of comments from qualitative 'think-aloud' interviews. Four general themes were identified: i) Perceived cultural and societal norms; ii) Influence of family on decision-making; iii) Resource limitation, and iv) Evidence of effectiveness. For each intervention discussed, we identified three themes: for the Norway model: i) Overcoming communication barriers and assumptions; ii) Request from an official third party, and iii) Risk of coercion; for the home education model: i) Intragroup dynamics; ii) Avoidance of hospital, and iii) Burdens on participants; and for the transplant candidate advocates model: i) Vested interest of advocates; ii) Time commitment, and iii) Risk of misinformation. We used these results to develop a multicomponent intervention which comprises components from existing interventions that have been adapted to increase acceptability and engagement in a UK population. This will be evaluated in a future randomised controlled trial."
https://openalex.org/W3173759037,"Common mental disorders present the main reason for registered sick leave in Sweden today, and women are at a higher risk of such sick leave than men. The aim of this paper is to explore how employees on sick leave for common mental disorders experience interventions and rehabilitation activities during return-to-work, as well as to explore similarities and differences between the experiences of the interviewed women and men.A qualitative design was applied with semi-structured focus group interviews. Seven focus groups were conducted with a total of 28 participants (13 women and 15 men). The focus group discussions were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim, and data analyzed with conventional content analysis. Similarities and differences in the women's and men's experiences were written down in reflective notes during all steps of the analysis.The results comprise of one main category, ""To be met with respect and recognition"", and subcategories at two levels. Both similarities and differences emerged in how women and men sick-listed because of common mental disorders experienced return-to-work interventions and rehabilitation activities. It was important for both women and men to be met with respect and recognition, which was essential to all forms of help that the participants discussed during the focus group interviews. Women expressed a need for home-related interventions, whereas men expressed a need for organizational interventions to counter feelings of resignation at work. Women could also more easily understand their mental health condition as compared with men.A key implication of this study is that research on interventions and rehabilitation activities during return-to-work among employees on sick leave for common mental disorders should consider whether the findings are relevant equally to both women and men. Similarly, return-to-work professionals may need to consider possible differences among women and men on sick leave for common mental disorders, and to further customize offered interventions and rehabilitation activities. Doing so may help enhance the effectiveness of such interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3174016831,"ABCC multidrug resistance-associated proteins (ABCCs/MRPs), a subfamily of ABC transporters, are involved in multiple physiological processes. Although these proteins have been characterized in some plants, limited efforts have been made to address their possible roles in Rehmannia glutinosa, a medicinal plant. Here, we scanned R. glutinosa transcriptome sequences and identified 18 RgABCC genes by in silico analysis. Sequence alignment revealed that the RgABCCs were closely phylogenetically related and highly conserved with other plant ABCCs/MRPs. Subcellular localization revealed that most of the RgABCCs were deposited in vacuoles and a few in plasma membranes. Tissue-specific expression of the RgABCCs indicated significant specific accumulation patterns, implicating their roles in the respective tissues. Differential temporal expression patterns of the RgABCCs exhibited their potential roles during root development. Various abiotic stress and hormone treatment experiments indicated that some RgABCCs could be transcriptionally regulated in roots. Furthermore, the transcription of several RgABCCs in roots was strongly activated by cadmium (Cd), suggesting possible roles under heavy metal stresses. Functional analysis of RgABCC1 heterologous expression revealed that it may increase the tolerance to Cd in yeast, implying its Cd transport activity. Our study provides a detailed inventory and molecular characterization of the RgABCCs and valuable information for exploring their functions in R. glutinosa."
https://openalex.org/W3174119090,"To address the need for simple, safe, sensitive, and scalable SARS-CoV-2 tests, we validated and implemented a PCR test that uses a saliva collection kit use at home. Individuals self-collected 300 μl saliva in vials containing Darnell Rockefeller University Laboratory (DRUL) buffer and extracted RNA was assayed by RT-PCR (the DRUL saliva assay). The limit of detection was confirmed to be 1 viral copy/μl in 20 of 20 replicate extractions. Viral RNA was stable in DRUL buffer at room temperature up to seven days after sample collection, and safety studies demonstrated that DRUL buffer immediately inactivated virus at concentrations up to 2.75x106 PFU/ml. Results from SARS-CoV-2 positive nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples collected in viral transport media and assayed with a standard FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) test were highly correlated with samples placed in DRUL buffer. Direct comparison of results from 162 individuals tested by FDA EUA oropharyngeal (OP) or NP swabs with co-collected saliva samples identified four otherwise unidentified positive cases in DRUL buffer. Over six months, we collected 3,724 samples from individuals ranging from 3 months to 92 years of age. This included collecting weekly samples over 10 weeks from teachers, children, and parents from a pre-school program, which allowed its safe reopening while at-risk pods were quarantined. In sum, we validated a simple, sensitive, stable, and safe PCR-based test using a self-collected saliva sample as a valuable tool for clinical diagnosis and screening at workplaces and schools."
https://openalex.org/W3174629244,"We investigated circulatory dynamics in patients with vasodepressor type neurally mediated syncope (VT-NMS) by performing high-resolution Holter electrocardiography and a correlation analysis of changes in adenylate cyclase activity, blood pressure, and pulse during the head-up tilt test. Holter electrocardiography was performed for 30 patients. Adenylate cyclase activity was evaluated in lymphocytes from blood samples taken at rest and during the head-up tilt test. There was no change in autonomic nerve fluctuation during electrocardiography in VT-NMS patients, but our results showed a significant difference in blood pressure and adenylate cyclase activity between VT-NMS patients and healthy volunteers; the systolic blood pressure of VT-NMS patients decreased after 5 min, while at 10 min, the adenylate cyclase activity was the highest (0.53%) and the systolic blood pressure was the lowest (111.8 mm Hg). Pulse rates increased after 10 min. VT-NMS patients showed higher blood pressure, pulse rate, and adenylate cyclase activity during the tilt test than did healthy volunteers. In patients with syncope, standing for longer than 10 minutes may increase the risk of VT-NMS. From our results, we consider it likely that high systolic blood pressure and adenylate cyclase activity at rest cause fainting in VT-NMS patients. Our findings may be helpful for identifying individuals with a high risk of developing NMS in the healthy population."
https://openalex.org/W3175902202,"The risk for outdoor falls tends to increase during winter due to icy road conditions. Several Swedish municipalities have introduced programs that provide their senior citizens with a pair of ice cleats in an attempt to tackle this problem. In this paper, we perform a process evaluation to identify potential barriers to the success of these programs and analyze the logic of their design.We sent a survey to all 290 Swedish municipalities to collect data on the characteristics of ice cleat distribution programs. We also performed focus-group interviews with older adults to gain insight into their thoughts about ice cleat programs. We synthesized our data with existing literature on ice cleats and behavior change theory to populate a logic model to identify and analyze hidden assumptions and potential flaws using program theory analysis.On average, about 40% of the eligible population living in the intervention municipalities collected a pair of ice cleats. While we identified some other, but mostly minor, barriers to implementation, the main barrier appears to be a lack of scale (i.e., insufficient procurement and distribution of ice cleats), as 90% of all purchased ice cleats were eventually distributed. While previous research suggests that ice cleats can decrease injury risks if worn, we find that there is limited evidence on the effects of distribution on ice cleat use. Our interviewees emphasized the potential utility of ice cleats for staying safe and active during winter but stressed that ice cleats need to be user-friendly and of high-quality to increase the likelihood that a distribution program encourages behavior change.Existing ice cleat distribution programs appear to have reached a meaningful share of the targeted population. Additional research is required to assess their effects on ice cleat use and injury rates."

Based on theoretical and empirical grounds, in Study 1 ( N = 1,175) we proposed that mindfulness would be negatively related with tax evasion intentions through decreased social dominance orientation. Drawing on Duckitt’s dual-process motivational model, in Study 2 ( N = 722) we proposed that mindfulness would be positively related with support for progressive taxation through the mediation of lower competitive-jungle beliefs, and then lower social dominance orientation. Instead, we did not expect to find mediation of the link between mindfulness and support for progressive taxation through dangerous-world beliefs and right-wing authoritarianism. These studies inform about the motivational pathways through which mindfulness relates with tax evasion intentions and support for progressive taxation."
https://openalex.org/W3174790315,"Background Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is an often curative intent treatment, however it is associated with significant gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity and treatment related mortality. Graft-versus-host disease is a significant contributor to transplant-related mortality. We performed a phase 2 trial of the somatostatin analog pasireotide to prevent gastrointestinal toxicity and GVHD after myeloablative allogeneic HCT. Methods Patients received 0.9mg pasireotide every 12 hours from the day prior to conditioning through day +4 after HCT (or a maximum of 14 days). The primary outcomes were grade 3–4 gastrointestinal toxicity through day 30 and acute GVHD. Secondary outcomes were chronic GVHD, overall survival and relapse free survival at one year. Stool and blood samples were collected from before and after HCT for analyses of stool microbiome, local inflammatory markers, and systemic inflammatory and metabolic markers. Results were compared with matched controls. Results Twenty-six patients received pasireotide and were compared to 52 matched contemporaneous controls using a 1–2 match. Grade 3–4 GI toxicity occurred in 21 (81%) patients who received pasireotide and 35 (67%) controls (p = 0.33). Acute GVHD occurred in 15 (58%) patients in the pasireotide group and 28 (54%) controls (p = 0.94). Chronic GVHD occurred in 16 patients in the pasireotide group (64%) versus 22 patients in the control group (42%) (p = 0.12). Overall survival at 1 year in the pasireotide group was 63% (95% CI: 47%,86%) versus 82% (95% CI: 72%, 93%) in controls (log-rank p = 0.006). Relapse-free survival rate at one year was 40% (95% CI: 25%, 65%) in the pasireotide group versus 78% (95% CI: 68%, 91%) in controls (log-rank p = 0.002). After controlling for the effect of relevant covariates, patients in the pasireotide group had attenuated post-HCT loss of microbial diversity. Analysis of systemic inflammatory markers and metabolomics demonstrated feasibility of such analyses in patients undergoing allogeneic HCT. Baseline level and pre-to-post transplant changes in several inflammatory markers (including MIP1a, MIP1b, TNFa, IL8Pro, and IL6) correlated with likelihood of survival. Conclusions Pasireotide did not prevent gastrointestinal toxicity or acute GVHD compared to contemporaneous controls. Pasireotide was associated with numerically higher chronic GVHD and significantly decreased OS and RFS compared to contemporaneous controls. Pasireotide may provide a locally protective effect in the stool microbiome and in local inflammation as measured by stool calprotectin, stool beta-defensin, and stool diversity index."
https://openalex.org/W3175312738,"Son preference and sex selective practices have resulted in a deficit of girls in several countries, primarily across Asia. Emerging evidence indicates that son preference survives migration to Western high-income countries. The objective of this study was to assess male-to-female (M/F) ratios at birth per mother's country of birth in Australia 1997-2016, in total and by parity, and by states/territories and over time.Data for this national population-based cross-sectional study were obtained from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC) and included all live births in Australia 1997-2016 (N = 5 614 847). M/F ratios with 95% Confidence Intervals were estimated.The M/F ratio for births to Australian-born mothers was within the expected range (1.03-1.07) regardless of parity and time period. M/F ratios were elevated above the expected range for births to mothers born in China in the total sample (M/F ratio 1.084, 95% confidence interval 1.071-1.097) and at parity 2 (1.175, 1.120-1.231), and for births to mothers born in India at parity 2 (1.146, 1.090-1.204). Parity 2 births were the most consistently male-biased across time. Across states, elevated M/F ratios were identified for both groups in New South Wales (China parity 2: 1.182, 1.108-1.260; India parity 2: 1.182, 1.088-1.285), for births to Chinese-born mothers in Victoria (total births: 1.097, 1.072-1.123; parity 1: 1.115, 1.072-1.159) and Australian Capital Territory (total births: 1.189, 1.085-1.302) and births to Indian-born mothers Western Australia (parity 2: 1.307, 1.122-1.523).Son preference persists in some immigrant communities after migration to Australia. The consistent pattern of elevated M/F ratios across the larger states indicates that sex imbalances at birth are largely independent of restrictiveness of local abortion laws. Drivers and consequences of son preference in Western high-income settings should be explored to further promote gender equality, and to strengthen support for women who may be vulnerable to reproductive coercion."
https://openalex.org/W3177094574,"The goal is to examine the risk of conception mode-type-1 diabetes using different survival analysis modelling approaches and examine if there are differentials in the risk of type-1 diabetes between children from fresh and frozen-thawed embryo transfers. We aimed to compare the performances and fitness of different survival analysis regression models with the Cox proportional hazard (CPH) model used in an earlier study. The effect of conception modes and other prognostic factors on type-1 diabetes among children conceived either spontaneously or by assisted reproductive technology (ART) and its sub-groups was modelled in the earlier study. We used the information on all singleton children from the Swedish Medical Birth Register hosted by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare, 1985 to 2015. The main explanatory variable was the mode of conception. We applied the CPH, parametric and flexible parametric survival regression (FPSR) models to the data at 5% significance level. Loglikelihood, Akaike and Bayesian information criteria were used to assess model fit. Among the 3,138,540 singletons, 47,938 (1.5%) were conceived through ART (11,211 frozen-thawed transfer and 36,727 fresh embryo transfer). In total, 18,118 (0.58%) of the children had type-1 diabetes, higher among (0.58%) those conceived spontaneously than the ART-conceived (0.42%). The median (Interquartile range (IQR)) age at onset of type-1 diabetes among spontaneously conceived children was 10 (14-6) years, 8(5-12) for ART, 6 (4-10) years for frozen-thawed embryo transfer and 9 (5-12) years for fresh embryo transfer. The estimates from the CPH, FPSR and parametric PH models are similar. There was no significant difference in the risk of type-1 diabetes among ART- and spontaneously conceived children; FPSR: (adjusted Hazard Ratio (aHR) = 1.070; 95% Confidence Interval (CI):0.929-1.232, p = 0.346) vs CPH: (aHR = 1.068; 95%CI: 0.927-1.230, p = 0.361). A sub-analysis showed that the adjusted hazard of type-1 diabetes was 37% (aHR = 1.368; 95%CI: 1.013-1.847, p = 0.041) higher among children from frozen-thawed embryo transfer than among children from spontaneous conception. The hazard of type-1 diabetes was higher among children whose mothers do not smoke (aHR = 1.296; 95%CI:1.240-1.354, p<0.001) and of diabetic mothers (aHR = 6.419; 95%CI:5.852-7.041, p<0.001) and fathers (aHR = 8.808; 95%CI:8.221-9.437, p<0.001). The estimates from the CPH, parametric models and the FPSR model were close. This is an indication that the models performed similarly and any of them can be used to model the data. We couldn't establish that ART increases the risk of type-1 diabetes except when it is subdivided into its two subtypes. There is evidence of a greater risk of type-1 diabetes when conception is through frozen-thawed transfer."

Ophthalmologists rated patients for cataract surgery appropriateness and prioritization using a visual analogue scale of 0-10 preoperatively. All patients completed the eCAPS Quality of Life (QoL), while 313 completed the Catquest-9SF and EQ-5D questionnaires. Regression analyses were applied to determine demographic, clinical and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) associated with appropriateness and prioritization.Two clinical factors (study eye and fellow eye best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)), 2 eCAPS (night driving difficulty, ability to take care of local errands), and 2 Catquest-9SF PROMs (recognizing faces, seeing to walk on uneven ground) were associated with appropriateness. In multivariable regression, the rating physician, 2 clinical criteria (study eye BCVA, anticipated postoperative BCVA) and 1 eCAPS QoL (night driving difficulty) were associated with appropriateness. Prioritization was associated with low income, 8 clinical criteria, 9 eCAPS, 5 Catquest-9SF, and 1 EQ-5D PROMs. In multivariable regression, 1 clinical criterion (study eye BCVA), 2 eCAPS QoL (night driving difficulty, ability to take care of local errands), and 2 Catquest-9SF PROMs (seeing prices, seeing to walk on uneven ground) were significantly associated.The eCAPS and Catquest-9SF questionnaires show some concordance with physician-deemed appropriateness, and more with prioritization. Binary conversions of PROM scales provide similar modelling, with minimal loss of explanatory power. As physician-deemed appropriateness and prioritization do not completely capture the patient perspective, PROMs may have a role in cataract surgery decision-making frameworks."
https://openalex.org/W3176930291,"Metabolic reprogramming occurs in cancer cells and is regulated partly by the opposing actions of tyrosine kinases and tyrosine phosphatases. Several members of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) superfamily have been linked to cancer as either pro-oncogenic or tumor-suppressive enzymes. In order to investigate which PTPs can modulate the metabolic state of cancer cells, we performed an shRNA screen of PTPs in HCT116 human colorectal cancer cells. Among the 72 PTPs efficiently targeted, 24 were found to regulate mitochondrial respiration, 8 as negative and 16 as positive regulators. Of the latter, we selected TC-PTP (PTPN2) for further characterization since inhibition of this PTP resulted in major functional defects in oxidative metabolism without affecting glycolytic flux. Transmission electron microscopy revealed an increase in the number of damaged mitochondria in TC-PTP-null cells, demonstrating the potential role of this PTP in regulating mitochondrial homeostasis. Downregulation of STAT3 by siRNA-mediated silencing partially rescued the mitochondrial respiration defect observed in TC-PTP-deficient cells, supporting the role of this signaling axis in regulating mitochondrial activity. In addition, mitochondrial stress prevented an increased expression of electron transport chain-related genes in cells with TC-PTP silencing, correlating with decreased ATP production, cellular proliferation, and migration. Our shRNA-based metabolic screen revealed that PTPs can serve as either positive or negative regulators of cancer cell metabolism. Taken together, our findings uncover a new role for TC-PTP as an activator of mitochondrial metabolism, validating this PTP as a key target for cancer therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W3177367451,"Small wind turbines (SWTs) have become increasingly common within the last decade, but their impact on wildlife, especially bats, is largely unknown. We conducted an operational experiment by sequentially placing a mobile SWT with five different operational modes at six sites of high bat activity, including roosts, commuting structures, and highly frequented hunting areas. Bat flight trajectories around the SWT were documented at each site during five consecutive nights using a specifically designed high-spatial-resolution 3D camera. The recordings showed high bat activity levels close to the SWT (7,065 flight trajectories within a 10-m radius). The minimum distance to the rotor of each trajectory varied between 0 and 18 m, with a mean of 4.6 m across all sites. Linear mixed models created to account for site differences showed that, compared to a reference pole without a SWT, bats flew 0.4 m closer to the rotor (95% CI 0.3-0.6 m) if it was out of operation and 0.3 m closer (95% CI 0.1-0.4 m) if it was moving slowly. Exploratory behavior was frequently observed, with many bats deviating from their original flight trajectory to approach the rotor. Among 7,850 documented trajectories, 176 crossed the rotor, including 65 while it was in motion. The collision of one P. pygmaeus individual occurred during the experiment. These results demonstrate that, despite the generally strong ability of bats to evade moving rotor blades, bat casualties at SWTs placed at sites of high bat activity can reach or exceed the current threshold levels set for large wind turbines. As SWTs provide less energy than large turbines, their negative impact on bats should be minimized by avoidance measures such as a bat-friendly site selection or curtailment algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W3173629686,"The present paper deals with a new efficient shooting and bouncing ray (SBR) method based on OptiX and normal vectors correction. The basic idea is to make full use of the computing resources of the RTX series graphics cards. For ray tracing, the algorithm uses OptiX to invoke the built-in RT Cores of hardware. Thus, a fast intersection test can be implemented. To reduce the error of ray tracing caused by the facetted surface characterizing the curved surface, the direction of the reflected ray is corrected by normal vectors correction. Additionally, multiple GPU cores are invoked to accelerate the calculation of far-field integration of millions of ray tubes, which can improve the efficiency of the algorithm while reducing the data transmission time of heterogeneous devices. Simulation results show that the ray path after normal vectors correction is consistent with the theoretical results, and the algorithm can predict the RCS of arbitrary facetted geometries, which is 60 times faster than the SBR method based on kd-tree."
https://openalex.org/W3175518357,"With the rapid development of urbanization and the popularization of the vehicle, the frequent occurrence of traffic jams results in idling fuel waste, environmental pollution, and other issues. In order to alleviate these problems, engine start-stop technology has been widely used in different types of vehicles in recent years. However, current start-stop trigger technology has many deficiencies, such as mistaken triggering and frequent engine start-stop, which greatly reduces user driving experience, causing most of them to deactivate this system. The intelligent engine start-stop trigger (IEST) system based on the actual road running status was established by building the image recognition model and the digital traffic analysis model in order to solve this problem. A system test shows that IEST can avoid frequently engine starting and stopping. The results show that IEST could effectively improve the driving experience and reduce engine fuel consumption, and it promotes conventional engine start-stop technology."
https://openalex.org/W3176645513,"The Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) virtual Catalyst Conference on Cholangiocarcinoma: Molecular Drivers, Microenvironment, and Precision Medicine was held on April 7, 2021. The conference was organized and chaired by Dr. Alphonse E. Sirica (Professor Emeritus of Pathology, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA) and included nine speakers (Figure 1). Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a heterogeneous class of highly aggressive and fatal primary epithelial cancers of the intra- and extrahepatic biliary system exhibiting the characteristics of cholangiocyte differentiation. After hepatocellular carcinoma, intrahepatic CCA is the second most common primary liver cancer, accounting for approximately 10%-20% of all primary hepatic malignancies. Over the past 10-20 years, intrahepatic CCA has notably become the focus of increasing concern, largely due to its rising incidence and high mortality rates in various parts of the world. In the United States, the rising incidence and mortality rates from this primary hepatobiliary cancer, particularly over the past decade or so, have coincided with a rapidly growing interest among clinicians, investigators, and patient advocates seeking greater mechanistic insights and more personalized targeted molecular and immunotherapeutic approaches for managing and/or preventing this challenging and biologically complex hepatobiliary cancer. This first of its kind FASEB Catalyst Conference highlighted timely research findings focused on key molecular drivers, the tumor reactive stroma, and immune milieu in relation to CCA development, malignant progression, morpho-molecular heterogeneity, and therapeutic resistance, together with emerging strategies for advancing novel molecular and immunotherapies for CCA. The Keynote Address was given by Dr. Gregory J. Gores (Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, MN, USA), who provided a comprehensive review of the classification, epidemiology, morpho-molecular subtypes, experimental models, and emerging therapeutic strategies for CCA. He reviewed the worldwide incidence of this cancer, risk factors, and the anatomic subtypes. In addition, the role of driver mutations in the intrahepatic subtype of CCA was extensively discussed, with an emphasis on FGFR-2 fusions, and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 gain of function genetic aberrations. Precision medicine advances in treating these cancers was examined in detail including tailoring therapy for patients with B-Raf mutations, mismatch DNA repair, and the IDH and FGFR gene aberrations. Other oncogenic signaling pathways were also discussed. Finally, an appraisal from a therapeutic perspective of the tumor immune microenvironment was dissected in detail. The disappointing response to checkpoint inhibitors was noted, and the opportunities for therapies combining immune checkpoint inhibitors with targeting of other immune cell subtypes were noted. Two Plenary Sessions followed the Keynote Address. The topic of Plenary Session 1 was Tumor Microenvironment. That of Plenary Session 2 was Molecular Drivers and Targets. In Plenary Session 1, Dr. Mario Strazzabosco (Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA) presented a detailed discussion of the tumor microenvironment in CCA. He noted the strikingly heterogeneous and diversified ecosystem generated by signals originating from the cancer cells and including inflammatory cytokines and growth factors, in particular, PDGFs, TGFβ, and VEGFs. These signals are coordinated and amplified by a unique population of mesenchymal stromal cells called cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are activated myofibroblasts largely originating from hepatic stellate cells and/or portal fibroblasts. Recent data obtained through single-cell transcriptomics were discussed, identifying at least five different clusters of CAFs in CCA, each of them with a specific function. He further noted that among CCA types, there is substantial variation in the cellular and matrisome composition of the tumor microenvironment, and this may have important impacts on CCA invasiveness, with CCA characterized by more intense CAF infiltration showing a worse prognosis. This was further illustrated by data demonstrating VEGF-C secreted by CAFs to promote lymphangiogenesis and facilitate the migration of CCA cells into the lymphatic vessels. The role of innate and adaptive immunity in CCA was also discussed, which highlighted further complexity and heterogeneity in the CCA microenvironment with respect to immune regulation and predictive relationships with immunotherapeutic responses and prognosis. Dr. Sumera I. Ilyas (Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science) then discussed the role of immunosuppressive myeloid cells in CCA. She pointed out that CCAs are desmoplastic tumors with an innate tumor immune microenvironment that is enriched in immunosuppressive myeloid cells, such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Dr. Ilyas presented preclinical data demonstrating that there is a significant increase in programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1)-positive TAMs in CCA. These PD-L1-positive TAMs promote exhaustion of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and foster tumor progression in CCA. However, inhibition of TAMs promotes a compensatory emergence of granulocytic-MDSCs (G-MDSCs). Dual inhibition of G-MDSCs and TAMs potentiates immune checkpoint blockade in CCA with consequent reduction in CCA tumor burden and improvement in survival in a murine model. Dr. Ilyas discussed that these findings support the role of combination immunotherapeutic strategies coupling immune checkpoint blockade with immunotherapies targeting tumor-promoting myeloid cells in CCA. Dr. Daniela Sia (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA) opened Plenary Session 2 with a presentation discussing the current status of molecular classifications of intrahepatic and extrahepatic CCA. She stressed the different molecular and immune profiles of these two CCA subtypes and the importance of considering them as separate entities. She also presented her recent progress in generating a novel genomics-based classification of intrahepatic CCA, so called stroma-tumor-immune-based (STIM) classification, able to integrate aberrations of the tumor with immune and stromal features. The proposed classification pinpoints potential tumor-intrinsic and tumor-extrinsic mechanisms of immunosuppression and evasion, and ultimately provide insights into the rational design of therapeutic strategies targeting both the cancer cells and the surrounding microenvironment. Dr. Nabeel Bardeesy (Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA) then discussed the subset of intrahepatic CCAs harboring mutations in the metabolic gene, IDH1. Gain of function IDH1 mutations are among the most common genetic alterations in intrahepatic CCA, and act by generating high levels of the metabolite (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate [(R)-2HG]. (R)-2HG inhibits the function of numerous enzymes that are dependent on α-ketoglutarate, including histone and DNA demethylating enzymes, although the critical targets of (R)-2HG that drive intrahepatic CCA initiation and the functions of mIDH1 in fully formed tumors remain undefined. Likewise, small molecule selective mIDH1 inhibitors provide clinical benefit for patients with mIDH1 intrahepatic CCA, although the mechanisms are not clear. Dr. Bardeesy presented findings regarding the biological and molecular basis for response to mIDH1 inhibition in a novel genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM). He showed that mIDH1 promotes immuno-evasion in intrahepatic CCA and that restoration of antitumor immunity is central to the therapeutic efficacy of mIDH1 inhibition in the GEMM. Moreover, he presented data revealing that mIDH1 inhibition confers sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibition. The Plenary Sessions were followed by an important clinically oriented Virtual Roundtable Discussion focused on the challenges and future of precision medicine in CCA. This open panel discussion, which was moderated by Dr. Sirica, included presentations by Dr. Tim F. Greten (National Cancer Institute, U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA), Dr. Lewis R. Roberts (Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science), Dr. Nilo Azad (Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA), and Stacie C. Lindsey (The Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation, Herriman, UT, USA). Dr. Greten discussed current immune-based approaches in biliary tract cancer. A number of studies including trials conducted at the National Cancer Institute suggest that single agent checkpoint inhibitor therapy is not very successful in biliary tract cancer. Dr. Greten presented preclinical data of a very potent immune-based approach testing the combination of anti-CD40/anti-PD1 in combination with chemotherapy leading to significant survival in mice with large established tumors. He also pointed out that myeloid cells are frequently found in the tumor microenvironment of biliary tract cancers and represent an important target to enhance antitumor immunity. It was then noted by Dr. Roberts that there is a substantial gap in knowledge about the potential for inherited genetic risk for CCA in populations of all ethnicities. He and his collaborators have initiated a global genome-wide association study to identify gene variants associated with the development of CCA. Their initial discovery phase cohort is comprised primarily of patients of European ancestry, with a small proportion of persons of Asian ancestry. With the development of novel statistical analysis techniques that allow adjustment for differences in racial and ethnic background of participants, they now seek to enhance the scope of the study by adding a substantial number of persons of Hispanic, Asian, and African descent with CCA, and thus gain additional knowledge of risk variants important in underrepresented populations. A majority of patients being treated for CCA are diagnosed with unresectable tumor, thus limiting their treatment options. Dr. Nilo Azad indicated that for these patients, there are presently only two lines of systemic chemotherapy, both of which are not curative. This speaks to a significant unmet need for new therapies. In this context, she stated that there are multiple strategies we could employ to add new agents to the options available for CCA patients, including using novel agent drugs that are emerging for known targets that previously have not been druggable and finding new uses of already approved drugs as single agents or more likely in combination approaches. Adding to what was presented in the Keynote Address and in Plenary Session 2, she further emphasized the use of FGFR inhibitors for FGFR-rearranged tumors, IDH1 inhibitors for IDH1 mutated tumors, and combination RAF/MEK inhibitors in BRAF v600-mutated tumors as being examples of employing already known agents for biomarker-targeted cohorts of CCA. Moreover, she noted that there are still multiple biomarker subsets, including patients with DNA damage repair defects such as BRCA1/2 mutations, ARID1A mutations, and KRAS mutations, among many others, where novel approaches are being tested and are needed. Stacie Lindsey, Founder and CEO of the Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation, followed with a discussion of the importance of biomarker testing for patients with CCA. She went on to explain that there are several reasons patients do not get biomarker testing, based on the foundation’s survey data. The most critical reason is that their provider does not tell them about it. This is a far more common occurrence in community practice rather than academic institutions. However, the survey found both circumstances. Advocacy plays a key role in educating patients on the importance of biomarker testing, which opens the door to many clinical trials, and targeted treatment options. Here she advocated that every patient with CCA should have biomarker testing. It was further stated by her that while patients may not choose to participate in a clinical trial or take advantage of targetable treatment options, they still should know the options available to them and have the opportunity to make this decision. Additional points of discussion raised at this conference called attention to the challenges of (1) intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity as a major obstacle to the development of molecular targeted-based and immune-based therapies for CCA; (2) the need to develop an integrated systems biology approach to classifying distinct CCA subtypes, predictive of prognosis and therapeutic outcomes; (3) continued research aimed at improving preclinical CCA testing models that can more accurately translate to novel human CCA therapies; and (4) expanding clinical therapeutic trials to include early stage CCA. Results from the evaluation survey were very positive concerning the relevance and quality of research discussed, with 78.57% of the respondents being in strong agreement and 21.43% and 14.29%, respectively, being in agreement, with no negative comments. Moreover, 85.71% of those responding to the survey stated that they would be interested in attending the meeting again in the future, either virtually or in person, with an additional 7.14% responding yes to in person only, and another 7.14% to virtually only.

https://openalex.org/W3177072913,"Longitudinal research is one effective way to gauge changes in a student cohort over time, however attrition in these studies is typically high, which can result in study bias. This study explored learning environment factors, approaches to studying, and academic performance as predictors of occupational therapy students' consistent participation in data collection conducted over three years of their professional program.A longitudinal study of Norwegian occupational therapy students (analyzed n = 240) was conducted. Logistic regression analysis was used to explore occupational therapy students' perceptions of the learning environment, their approaches to studying, and exam grades as they related to the likelihood of consistent participation at three annual surveys.Annual response rates varied between 55.1%, and 65.6%, and consistent participation was observed among 49.2%. The fully adjusted regression models showed that higher strategic approach scores increased the odds of consistent participation (adjusted OR: 1.04, p < 0.01), whereas higher surface approach scores decreased the odds of consistent participation (adjusted OR: 0.95, p < 0.05). Neither sociodemographic factors, learning environment factors nor academic performance predicted participation over time.Researchers can anticipate relatively high levels of attrition in longitudinal studies of occupational therapy students, but attrition seems to be largely proportional between groups. However, completers in longitudinal studies may be somewhat more well-organized and academically oriented than drop-outs."
