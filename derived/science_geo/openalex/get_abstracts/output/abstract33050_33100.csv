https://openalex.org/W1999826236,"Bone resorption depends on the formation, by osteoclasts, of an acidic extracellular compartment wherein matrix is degraded. The mechanism by which osteoclasts transport protons into that resorptive microenvironment was identified by means of adenosine triphosphate-dependent weak base accumulation in isolated osteoclast membrane vesicles, which exhibited substrate and inhibition properties characteristic of the vacuolar, electrogenic H+-transporting adenosine triphosphatase (H+-ATPase). Identify of the proton pump was confirmed by immunoblot of osteoclast membrane proteins probed with antibody to vacuolar H+-ATPase isolated from bovine kidney. The osteoclast's H+-ATPase was immunocytochemically localized to the cell-bone attachment site. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that the H+-ATPase was present in the ruffled membrane, the resorptive organ of the cell."

When endothelial cells are cultured on Matrigel, a solid gel of basement membrane proteins, they rapidly align and form hollow tube-like structures. We show here that tube formation is a multi-step process induced by laminin. An RGD-containing sequence in the A chain of laminin through an integrin receptor on the endothelial cell induces their attachment to the protein while a YIGSR site in the B1 chain induces cell-cell interactions and the resulting tube formation. We also show that the laminin-derived synthetic peptide YIGSR contains sufficient information to induce single endothelial cells to form ring-like structures surrounding a hollow lumen, the basic putative unit in the formation of capillaries."
https://openalex.org/W1571332834,"The mycotoxin, cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), inhibits the Ca2+-stimulated ATPase (EC 3.6.1.38) and Ca2+ transport activity of sarcoplasmic reticulum (Goeger, D. E., Riley, R. T., Dorner, J. W., and Cole, R. J. (1988) Biochem. Pharmacol. 37, 978-981). We found that at low ATP concentrations (0.5-2 microM) the inhibition of ATPase activity was essentially complete at a CPA concentration of 6-8 nmol/mg protein, indicating stoichiometric reaction of CPA with the Ca2+-ATPase. Cyclopiazonic acid caused similar inhibition of the Ca2+-stimulated ATP hydrolysis in intact sarcoplasmic reticulum and in a purified preparation of Ca2+-ATPase. Cyclopiazonic acid also inhibited the Ca2+-dependent acetylphosphate, p-nitrophenylphosphate and carbamylphosphate hydrolysis by sarcoplasmic reticulum. ATP protected the enzyme in a competitive manner against inhibition by CPA, while a 10(5)-fold change in free Ca2+ concentration had only moderate effect on the extent of inhibition. CPA did not influence the crystallization of Ca2+-ATPase by vanadate or the reaction of fluorescein-5'-isothiocyanate with the Ca2+-ATPase, but it completely blocked at concentrations as low as 1-2 mol of CPA/mol of ATPase the fluorescence changes induced by Ca2+ and [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid (EGTA) in FITC-labeled sarcoplasmic reticulum and inhibited the cleavage of Ca2+-ATPase by trypsin at the T2 cleavage site in the presence of EGTA. These observations suggest that CPA interferes with the ATP-induced conformational changes related to Ca2+ transport. The effect of CPA on the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase appears to be fairly specific, since the kidney and brain Na+,K+-ATPase (EC 3.6.1.37), the gastric H+,K+-ATPase (EC 3.6.1.36), the mitochondrial F1-ATPase (EC 3.6.1.34), the Ca2+-ATPase of erythrocytes, and the Mg2+-activated ATPase of T-tubules and surface membranes of rat skeletal muscle were not inhibited by CPA, even at concentrations as high as 1000 nmol/mg protein."

https://openalex.org/W2070706683,"The adenoviral transmembrane E3/19K glycoprotein is a resident of the endoplasmic reticulum. Here we show that the last six amino acid residues of the 15-membered cytoplasmic tail are necessary and sufficient for the ER retention. These residues can be transplanted onto the cytoplasmic tail of other membrane-bound proteins such that ER residency is conferred. Deletion analysis demonstrated that no single amino acid residue is responsible for the retention. The identified structural motif must occupy the extreme COOH-terminal position to be functional. An endogenous transmembrane ER protein, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, also contains a retention signal in its cytoplasmic tail. We suggest that short linear sequences occupying the extreme COOH-terminal position of transmembrane ER proteins serve as retention signals."
https://openalex.org/W1986744284,"We report that calf brain microtubules prepared without nucleotide contain, in addition to kinesin and dynein, a polypeptide of 100 kd that could be dissociated by nucleotide. The protein was selectively extracted from microtubules using a combination of GTP and AMP-PNP. The extract contained microtubule-stimulated (6-fold) MgATPase activity that partitioned into two components upon further purification: the 100 kd polypeptide and a soluble activating fraction. The 100 kd protein induced microtubules to form hexagonally packed bundles containing periodic cross bridges spaced 13 nm apart. In the presence of ATP and the activating fraction, bundles fragmented, elongated, and exhibited other behavior indicative of sliding between microtubules. These findings indicate that the 100 kd protein is part of a novel mechanochemical enzyme, which we term ""dynamin"", that may mediate microtubule sliding in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2003213264,"Although both U1 and U2 snRNPs have been implicated in the splicing process, their respective roles in the earliest stages of intron recognition and spliceosome assembly are uncertain. To address this issue, we developed a new strategy to prepare snRNP-depleted splicing extracts using Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells conditionally expressing U1 or U2 snRNP. Complementation analyses and chase experiments show that a stable complex, committed to the splicing pathway, forms in the absence of U2 snRNP. U1 snRNP and a substrate containing both a 5' splice site and a branchpoint sequence are required for optimal formation of this commitment complex. We developed new gel electrophoresis conditions to identify these committed complexes and to show that they contain U1 snRNA. Chase experiments demonstrated that these complexes are functional intermediates in spliceosome assembly and splicing. Our results have implications for the process of splice site selection."

https://openalex.org/W1555703707,"The high affinity receptor for IgE (Fc ϵ RI) found on mast cells and basophils is a tetrameric complex of a single α subunit, a single β subunit, and two identical γ subunits. The genes for the three subunits of mouse Fc ϵ RI have now been cloned from the mast cell line, PT18. When compared at the DNA level, the rat and mouse subunits are similarly conserved. However, at the protein level the homology between mouse and rat α is surprisingly low (71% identities) especially in the cytoplasmic regions (57% identities) which are of different length (25 and 20 residues, respectively). By contrast the β and γ are homogeneously conserved between mouse and rat (83 and 93% identities, respectively). The consensus amino acid sequence of the α subunit derived from three species (rat, mouse, and human) shows that the cytoplasmic tail diverges to the same extent as the leader peptide. Conversely, the transmembrane domain of the α is highly conserved and contains 10 consecutive residues that are identical. Comparisons between mouse Fc ϵ RI and other mouse proteins reveal regions of high homology between the α subunit and Fc γ RIIa and between the γ subunit and the ζ chain of the T cell receptor. Cells transfected with the α gene express the α subunit on their surface very inefficiently. Efficient expression is only achieved after co-transfection of the three rodent genes or of the human α gene together with the rodent γ without apparent need for β. The subunits are completely interchangeable upon transfection so that various chimeric mouse-rat-human receptors can be expressed."

Using this compound as an immobilized ligand for affinity chromatography and [3H]S-145 as a radioligand, we have purified the thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 receptor from the membranes of human blood platelets. The purification procedures consisted of solubilization of the receptor with 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS), affinity chromatographies on columns of S-145 affinity gel, wheat germ agglutinin agarose and red agarose, and repeated gel filtration high performance liquid chromatography on a TSK gel G-3000SW column. On the second gel filtration high performance liquid chromatography, the [3H]S-145 binding activity was eluted as a symmetrical peak which overlapped exactly with a peak of ultraviolet absorption at 280 nm. By these procedures, the receptor was purified about 8700-fold from the solubilized extract with a recovery of 6%. The final preparation showed a broad protein band at Mr 57,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and maximally bound 19.2 nmol of [3H]S-145/mg protein with a Kd of 29.8 nM. The [3H]S-145 binding to the purified receptor was specifically displaced by several thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 analogues."
https://openalex.org/W1526000978,"Abstract 1-Deoxymannojirimycin (MNJ), an inhibitor of Golgi alpha-mannosidase IA and IB, was used to assess the possible roles of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides in the structure and function of the integrin fibronectin receptor from cultured human fibroblasts. These cells normally attach well to fibronectin substrates and have only mature forms of the fibronectin receptor on their surfaces. MNJ inhibits the intracellular trimming of high mannose oligosaccharides, and cells treated with 0.2 mg/ml MNJ synthesize only immature precursor forms of both the alpha and beta subunits of the fibronectin receptor. The immature receptor polypeptides were found to be nonfunctional by two criteria: 1) cells treated with MNJ attached poorly to fibronectin substrates; and 2) receptor from the treated cells was defective in binding to fibronectin affinity columns. The precursor forms of the fibronectin receptor subunits were found on the surfaces of cells treated with MNJ, demonstrating that processing of receptor carbohydrates to mature forms was not necessary for receptor insertion into the plasma membrane. A monoclonal antibody that specifically bound the alpha subunit of the fibronectin receptor immunoprecipitated both alpha and beta subunit polypeptides from both control cells and cells treated with MNJ. Similarly, a monoclonal antibody that specifically bound only the beta subunit also immunoprecipitated both alpha and beta subunit polypeptides of the receptor from extracts of both control and MNJ-treated cells. These results indicate that receptor assembly can occur in the absence of complete oligosaccharide processing. Thus, oligosaccharide processing to the mature form of the fibronectin receptor is important for its binding function but not for receptor assembly or insertion into the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2128647672,"A 100 kd protein was isolated from tissue and cell extracts by affinity chromatography on a synthetic peptide representing the cytoplasmic domain of the fibronectin receptor β subunit. The 100 kd protein also bound to native fibronectin receptor, and this binding could be reversed with EDTA. Calcium may be the divalent cation required for the binding since the 100 kd protein was found to bind 45Ca2+. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 100 kd protein was not similar to any sequence in a protein data base. Immunofluorescent staining of cells cultured on fibronectin showed the 100 kd protein coinciding with the fibronectin receptor β subunit in sites of substrate contact. Therefore this protein, which we term fibulin, interacts with the fibronectin receptor in vitro and associates with the receptor in vivo. Fibulin is a potential mediator of interactions between adhesion receptors and the cytoskeleton."

While the specificity of the TCR alpha beta repertoire for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens is well established, the diversity of expressed gamma delta receptors and the ligands they recognize are less well understood. An alloreactive CD3+CD4-CD8- T cell line specific for murine class II MHC (Ia) antigens encoded in the I-E subregion of the H-2 gene complex was identified, and the primary structure of its gamma delta receptor heterodimer was characterized. In contrast to a TCR alpha beta-expressing alloreactive T cell line selected for similar specificity, the TCR gamma delta line displayed broad cross-reactivity for multiple distinct I-E-encoded allogeneic Ia molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1623564227,"Abstract This study sought to determine whether human melanoma cells express integrin-related receptors that mediate their adhesion to laminin. We found that antibodies against the integrin beta 1 chain blocked cell attachment to laminin-coated surfaces. Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining demonstrated beta 1 complexes in vinculin-positive focal adhesion plaques on the basal surface of cells attached to laminin substrates. Chromatography of detergent extracts of 125I-surface-labeled cells on laminin-Sepharose columns recovered two major laminin-binding proteins (100 and 130 kDa, reduced) that bound with high affinity to the columns and were eluted with EDTA. Both proteins were specifically immunoprecipitated from column fractions with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to the integrin beta 1 subunit, indicating that they form a noncovalent heterodimer complex. The alpha-like subunit is composed of a 30-kDa light chain that is joined by a disulfide bond to the 100-kDa heavy chain. This complex was not recovered from columns of fibronectin- or collagen type I- or IV-Sepharose. Laminin-binding by the alpha beta 1 complex was independent of Arg-Gly-Asp or Tyr-Ile-Gly-Ser-Arg-like sequences, but required the presence of divalent cations. The 100-kDa alpha-like subunit was electrophoretically and immunochemically distinct from the other known alpha subunits, alpha 1-alpha 6. The results indicate that human melanoma cells express a novel laminin-specific integrin beta 1 complex which may mediate the cells' interactions with this ligand."

The hybrid VDJH-C alpha protein is expressed on a subset of T cells in these mice, and we have shown that it forms part of a functional TCR complex by the criteria of coprecipitation and comodulation of CD3 and TCR beta chain components and T cell activation with anti-idiotypic antibodies or digoxin. Furthermore, in cells expressing the hybrid protein, there is allelic exclusion of endogenous TCR alpha genes.

https://openalex.org/W1526499817,"Studies of intact smooth muscle have suggested that its anomalous aerobic lactate production may reflect an intracellular compartmentation of glycolytic enzyme cascades designed to support specific exergonic processes. In particular, we have postulated a membrane-associated glycolytic cascade that preferentially supports the ATP requirements of membrane functions. We tested this hypothesis by using a smooth muscle plasma membrane fraction (PMV) purified for calcium pump activity. We show that glycolytic enzymes are endogenous in PMV and can produce NADH, ATP, and lactate from fructose 1,6-diphosphate in the presence of glycolytic cofactors. This glycolytic cascade can fuel the calcium pump despite the presence of an ATP trap that eliminated calcium uptake fueled by exogenously added ATP. This plasma membrane glycolytic cascade is coupled to calcium pump function in a tissue with both oxidative and glycolytic metabolism. Thus coupling of metabolic cascades with the specific processes they subserve may be a more general feature of cellular organization than was previously thought.—Paul, R. J.; Hardin, C. D.; Raeymaekers, L.; Wuytack, F.; Casteels, R. Preferential support of Ca2+ uptake in smooth muscle plasma membrane vesicles by an endogenous glycolytic cascade. FASEB J. 3: 2298-2301; 1989."

https://openalex.org/W1620636612,"A precursor form of Neurospora crassa tyrosinase has been identified by Western transfer from crude protein extracts and by immunoprecipitation of in vitro translated tyrosinase mRNA. The molecular weight of protyrosinase (75,000) exceeds that of mature tyrosinase (46,000) by about 50%. In order to deduce the primary structure and the nature of the extension, the tyrosinase gene was cloned. Poly(A) RNA isolated from tyrosinase-induced cultures of N. crassa was used as a template for cDNA synthesis, primed by a tyrosinase-specific, 32-fold degenerate heptadecanucleotide. Based on this sequence, a unique 21-mer was synthesized and used to screen a cDNA library constructed from tyrosinase-enriched mRNA. A partial genomic DNA library from wild-type strain TS and a genomic library from strain OR were screened using a 400-base pair nick-translated SalI fragment from a tyrosinase-positive cDNA clone as hybridization probe. The DNA sequences obtained revealed the presence of two allelic forms of this enzyme. The coding regions are interrupted by two short introns, of 52 and 99 base pairs. The encoded proteins differ in 3 out of 621 amino acid residues. A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with the known primary structure of mature tyrosinase alleles (Ruegg, C., Ammer, D., and Lerch, K. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 6420-6426) showed that the enzyme is synthesized as a precursor. Protyrosinase exceeds the mature protein by 213 amino acids at its carboxyl terminus.

https://openalex.org/W1567129527,"The proteolytic digestion of GPIIIa on intact platelets by chymotrypsin, thrombin, plasmin, trypsin, and staphylococcal V8 protease was monitored in immunoblot studies employing three different antibodies to GPIIIa, one of which was made against a 13-residue synthetic peptide containing the amino terminus of GPIIIa. Chymotrypsin, plasmin, and trypsin gave similar patterns, from which it could be inferred that the major products after extensive digestion were two-chain molecules composed of amino-terminal fragments of Mr ∼ 17,000–18,000 disulfide bonded to carboxyl-terminal remnants of Mr ∼ 58,000–70,000. These patterns suggest that GPIIIa contains a large disulfide-bonded loop of at least 325 amino acids that is susceptible to proteolytic cleavage, and that the 4 cysteine residues between residues 177 and 273 bond with each other. Such a structure can also account for the presence of the P1A1 epitope, which has recently been localized to a polymorphism at position 33 on these late digestion products. Thrombin did not proteolyze GPIIIa even at 2.5 units/ml. Still to be resolved is whether the minor immunoreactive GPIIIa bands found on normal platelets are related to in vivo or in vitro proteolysis and whether GPIIIa proteolysis plays a role in chymotrypsin-induced exposure of the GPIIb/IIIa receptor."

https://openalex.org/W2169143108,"The early events in site-specific excisive recombination were studied with phage lambda half-att sites that have no DNA to one side of the strand exchange region; they carry a single core-type integrase binding site and either P or P' arm flanking DNA. These half-attR and half-attL sites exhibit normal properties for the initial (covalent) top-strand transfer and form stable intermediates independent of later steps in the reaction. With these novel substrates we show that Xis specifically promotes the first strand exchange and that attL enhances Int cleavage at the top-strand site of attR. It is also shown that synapsis and initial strand transfers do not require DNA-DNA pairing but are mediated by protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. These involve the two top-strand Int binding sites (required for the first strand exchange) and, in addition, one of the two bottom-strand sites (C') responsible for the second strand exchange."
https://openalex.org/W1524243997,"Folate analogs that inhibit dihydrofolate reductase result in only partial interconversion of tetrahydrofolate cofactors to dihydrofolate with preservation of the major portion of reduced cellular folate cofactors in L1210 leukemia cells. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that low levels of dihydrofolate polyglutamates that accumulate in the presence of antifolates block thymidylate synthase to prevent depletion of reduced folate pools. This paper correlates biochemical analyses of rapid interconversions of radiolabeled folates and changes in purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis in L1210 murine leukemia cells exposed to antifolates with network thermodynamic computer modeling to assess this hypothesis. When cells are exposed to 1 microM trimetrexate there is an almost instantaneous inhibition of [3H] deoxyuridine or [14C]formate incorporation into nucleotides which is maximal within 5 min. This is associated with a rapid rise in cellular dihydrofolate (t1/2 approximately 1.5 min), which reaches a steady state that represents only 27.9% of the total folate pool. Pretreatment of cells with fluorodeoxyuridine, to inhibit thymidylate synthase by about 95% followed by trimetrexate only slows the rate of folate interconversion (t1/2 approximately 25 min) but not the final dihydrofolate level achieved. This is consistent with computer simulations which predict that direct inhibition of thymidylate synthase by 97, 98, and 99% should increase the half-time of dihydrofolate rise after trimetrexate to 40, 60, and 124 min, respectively, but the final level achieved is always the same as in cells with normal thymidylate synthase activity. The data reflect the high degree of catalytic activity of thymidylate synthase relative to tetrahydrofolate cofactor pools in the cells and the enormous extent of inhibition of this enzyme that is necessary to slow the rate of folate interconversions after addition of antifolates. The model predicts, and the data demonstrate, that virtually any residual thymidylate synthase activity will permit the interconversion of all tetrahydrofolate cofactors available for oxidation to dihydrofolate when dihydrofolate reductase activity is abolished, but the rate of interconversion will be slowed. Additional simulations indicate that the time course of cessation of tetrahydrofolate-dependent purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis after antifolates in these cells can be accounted for solely on the basis of tetrahydrofolate cofactor depletion alone. These data exclude the possibility that direct inhibition of thymidylate synthase by dihydrofolate polyglutamates, or any other intracellular folates that accumulate in cells after antifolates, can account for the rapid but partial interconversion of reduced folate cofactors to dihydrofolate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1583457956,"Based on hydropathy analysis, the P-type cation translocating ATPases are believed to have similar topological arrangements in the membrane, but little independent evidence exists for their precise pattern of transmembrane folding. As a first step toward defining the topology of the Neurospora plasma membrane H+-ATPase, we have mapped the orientation of the amino and carboxyl termini. In three different types of experiments, both termini of the H+-ATPase were shown to be exposed at the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane: 1) antibodies specific for the amino and carboxyl termini bound to permeabilized but not intact cells; 2) inside-out plasma membrane vesicles were approximately 100-fold more effective than intact cells in competing for antibody binding; and 3) trypsin, which is known to proteolyze three sites at the amino terminus and one site at the carboxyl terminus of the purified Neurospora H+-ATPase (Mandala, S. M., and Slayman, C. W. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 15122-15128), was found in the present study to cleave the same sites in inside-out plasma membrane vesicles but not in intact cells.

Like J.CaM1, J.CaM3 demonstrates partial signal transduction via CD3/Ti to only certain stimuli. J.CaM1, J.CaM2, and J.CaM3 define three non-Ti complementation groups involved in receptor function. To evaluate the mutations further we have introduced a heterologous receptor, the human muscarinic receptor 1 (HM1), into the parental Jurkat and mutant cell lines. This receptor demonstrates signal transduction competence in all these hosts, indicating that 1) T cells express the necessary apparatus for the coupling of HM1 to second messenger generation and 2) the mutations in the J. CaM family all affect molecules that are specific to CD3/Ti, and not HM1, function. Finally, the HM1 receptor exhibits partial sensitivity to cholera toxin in Jurkat cells, in contrast to the virtually complete sensitivity of CD3/Ti to cholera toxin."
https://openalex.org/W1571430071,"Abstract In membrane fractions from zucchini (Cucurbita pepo L.) hypocotyls, catalytic properties of a platelet-activating factor (PAF)-activated protein kinase were investigated. In the presence of [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid, phosphorylation of a 55-kDa membrane polypeptide and, to a lesser extent, several others, including a 120-kDa polypeptide, was stimulated by PAF. The phosphorylation of the 55-kDa polypeptide was used for quantification of the PAF-stimulated protein kinase. Stimulation of protein phosphorylation by PAF increased in a concentration range from 10-200 micrograms/ml (= 19-380 microM) PAF up to 10-fold above the control. Addition of Ca2+ ions in the micromolar range in the presence and in the absence of PAF increased the phosphorylation of the 55- and the 120-kDa polypeptide. Other phospholipids and lipids tested including phorbol ester, diglyceride, mono- and triglyceride, and oleic acid were ineffective. The same lipid specificity was previously observed for the activation of ATP-dependent H+ transport in microsomes (Scherer, G.F.E., Martiny-Baron, G., and Stoffel, B. (1988) Planta 175, 241-253). Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) were able to stimulate the phosphorylation of the same polypeptides as PAF and H+ transport but both to a lesser extent (PAF greater than LPC greater than LPE). In the presence of EGTA, PAF-stimulated phosphorylation of a 55- and a 57-kDa polypeptide was predominantly associated with vacuolar membranes and those of 42, 61, 63, and 120 kDa were predominantly associated with plasma membranes. Stimulation of ATP-dependent H+ transport by PAF was found in tonoplast vesicles whereas plasma membrane vesicles had only little transport activity and, therefore, an effect of PAF on plasma membrane H+ transport could not be measured. Stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by PAF was observed both in tonoplast- and plasma membrane-containing fractions."
https://openalex.org/W1573504950,"Protein S is unique among the vitamin K-dependent proteins found in blood plasma because it is a cofactor rather than a zymogen of a serine protease. Instead of a trypsin-like domain, protein S contains a domain that has sequence homology with steroid binding proteins. In order to understand the function of this structural domain, peptides have been synthesized with amino acid sequences that are homologous between human protein S and rat androgen binding protein. Two peptides, corresponding to amino acids 400–407 (PINPRLDG) and 605–614 (GVQLDLDEAI) of the protein S sequence have been tested for their effects on protein S function. Neither peptide altered the clotting of bovine or human plasma. The peptide GVQLDLDEAI enhanced the anticoagulant activity of human-activated protein C in human plasma while the peptide PINPRLDG had no effect. The peptide GVQLDLDEAI was observed to inhibit the binding of protein S to C4b-binding protein in plasma, resulting in increased concentrations of free protein S. GVQLDLDEAI was also observed to enhance the disassociation of the protein S•C4b-binding protein complex when purified complex was used. Finally, C4b-binding protein was observed to bind to GVQLDLDEAI. These results suggest that the carboxyl-terminal region of protein S, which contains the sequence GVQLDLDEAI, is involved in the interaction between protein S and C4b-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1530255913,"Abstract Bovine brain kinesin binds ADP tightly and contains a stoichiometric amount of ADP at its active site when isolated in the presence of free Mg2+ (Hackney, D. D. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85, 6314-6318). EDTA in excess of Mg2+ weakens ADP binding and nucleotide-free kinesin can be prepared by gel filtration with excess EDTA. On addition of ATP, this nucleotide-free enzyme catalyzes the rapid hydrolysis of a stoichiometric amount of ATP in a burst phase followed by much slower continued ATP hydrolysis limited by the release of ADP from the active site. This burst reaction is evident both by formation of [32P]Pi from [gamma-32P]ATP and by formation of [alpha-32P]ADP from [alpha-32P]ATP. At 1.1 nM kinesin active sites, the observed rate of the burst phase increases linearly with ATP over the 1-20 nM range yielding a bimolecular rate of net ATP binding and hydrolysis of 2.5 microM-1 s-1. The intercept at zero ATP is 0.008 s-1 which equals the ADP release rate at 0.008-0.009 s-1. This predicts a Km for ATP of approximately 3.5 nM and measurements of the dependence on ATP concentration of the steady state rate and amount of bound ADP are consistent with a Km of this magnitude."

From the primary structure of the ϵ subunit, the specifically modified residue was deduced to be Lys-109. This suggests the energy-dependent conformational changes in the ϵ subunit which change the surroundings of Lys-109 and alter the reactivity of this residue."
https://openalex.org/W1577760777,"Recent investigations have shown that the neuroendocrine and immune systems profoundly affect each other. In part, these interactions occur via common chemical messengers and receptors. One possible shared chemical messenger is the opioid precursor preproenkephalin, for which high concentrations of messenger RNA are present in brain, adrenal, and activated T helper cells. Because the biologic action of most peptide messengers depends on the posttranslational processing of the precursor, we have examined T helper cell lines for the production of proenkephalin-derived peptides. These peptides were characterized by multiple radioimmunoassays, gel filtration chromatography, and opiate radioreceptor assays. We found that activated T helper cells secrete significant concentrations of high-molecular-weight, opiate-inactive peptides, which are distinct from the proenkephalin-derived peptides of the neuroendocrine system. These studies clearly indicate cell-specific processing of proenkephalin, and suggest that the T helper cell-secreted products may have nonopiate receptor-mediated actions.— Roth, K. A.; Lorenz, R. G.; Unanue, R. A.; Weaver, C. T. Nonopiate active proenkephalin-derived peptides are secreted by T helper cells. FASEB J. 3: 2401-2407; 1989."
https://openalex.org/W2139995071,"Abstract We have studied the kinetics of ATP hydrolysis and synthesis in seven mutant Escherichia coli F1-ATPase enzymes. The seven mutations are distributed over a 105-residue segment of the catalytic nucleotide-binding domain in beta-subunit and are: G142S, K155Q, K155E, E181Q, E192Q, M209I, and R246C. We report forward and reverse rate constants and equilibrium constants in all seven mutant enzymes for the four steps of unisite kinetics, namely (i) ATP binding/release, (ii) ATP hydrolysis/synthesis, (iii) Pi release/binding, and (iv) ADP release/binding. The seven mutant enzymes displayed a wide range of deviations from normal in both rate and equilibrium constants, with no discernible common pattern. Notably, steep reductions in Kd ATP were seen in some cases, the value of Kd Pi was high, and K2 (ATP hydrolysis/synthesis) was relatively unaffected. Significantly, when the data from the seven mutations were combined with previous data from two other E. coli F1-beta-subunit mutations (D242N, D242V), normal E. coli F1, soluble and membranous mitochondrial F1, it was found that linear free energy relationships obtained for both ATP binding/release (log k+1 versus log K1) and ADP binding/release (log k-4 versus log K-4). Two conclusions follow. 1) The seven mutations studied here cause subtle changes in interactions between the catalytic nucleotide-binding domain and substrate ATP or product ADP. 2) The mitochondrial, normal E. coli, and nine total beta-subunit mutant enzymes represent a continuum in which subtle structural differences in the catalytic site resulted in changes in binding energy; therefore insights into the nature of energy coupling during ATP hydrolysis and synthesis by F1-ATPase may be ascertained by detailed studies of this group of enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1528981874,"During ischemia in so-called slow heart-rate hearts, there is a marked inhibition of the mitochondrial ATPase mediated by inhibitor protein binding to the enzyme (Rouslin, W., and Pullman, M. E. (1987) J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 19, 661–668). This ischemia-induced ATPase inhibition is triggered by a drop in mitochondrial matrix pH (Rouslin, W. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 3472–3476) which occurs as a result of the cell acidification which develops rapidly during the ischemic process. One effect of the ATPase inhibition is a marked slowing of the net rate of tissue ATP hydrolysis and, thus, a prolongation of cell viability during ischemia. In the present study, we demonstrate that matrix acidification in intact mitochondria from slow heart-rate hearts appears to be mediated by the Pi transporter. Pi/H+ symport appears to be the primary process which mediates matrix acidification and thus ATPase inhibition in intact slow heart-rate heart mitochondria made acidotic in vitro and, presumably, also in mitochondria in situ during the ischemic process. In contrast, intact mitochondria from a so-called fast heart-rate species, which exhibited only a low level of ischemia-induced ATPase inhibition in situ (Rouslin, W. (1987) Am. J. Physiol. 252, H622–H627), failed to exhibit a Pi- and pH-dependent mitochondrial ATPase inhibition mechanism in vitro. The Pi-dependent mitochondrial ATPase inhibition mechanism reported here for slow heart-rate hearts is consistent with a role for Pi as a coordinating signal promoting the conservation of cell ATP during myocardial ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W1528687750,"Two distinct 68-kDa proteins, named 68K-I (pI 6.4) and 68K-II (pI 5.6), were solubilized from human placenta by treatment with 5 mM EGTA. On DE52 cellulose column chromatography at pH 7.4, 68K-I in the EGTA eluate was recovered in the unadsorbed fractions, whereas 68K-II was retained on the column and eluted with 0.2 M NaCl. The 68K-I protein was obtained in more than 95% purity by further hydroxylapatite and cation exchange chromatographies, while the 68K-II protein was purified further by gel filtration and hydroxylapatite chromatographies. Partial amino acid sequence data showed that 68K-I protein was a novel protein which shared the same sequences as lipocortin I and that 68K-II was the same as human p68/67-kDa calelectrin (Crompton, M. R., Owens, R. J., Totty, N. F., Moss, S. E., Waterfield, M.D., and Crumpton, M. J. (1988) EMBO J. 7, 21-27; Sudhof, T. C., Slaughter, C. A., Leznicki, I., Barjon, P., and Reynolds, G. A. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85, 664-668). The two proteins bound to acidic phospholipids, phosphatidylserine, and/or phosphatidylinositol, but not to phosphatidylcholine, in the presence of micromolar levels of Ca2+. 68K-I bound to phosphatidylinositol preferentially to phosphatidylserine, whereas 68K-II bound only to phosphatidylserine. Both 68K-I and 68K-II inhibited phospholipase A2 activity, and the inhibition by 68K-II was detectable only in the presence of 100 mM KCl. 68K-I, but not 68K-II, was found to bind to F-actin in a Ca2+-dependent (1 mM) manner. Moreover 68K-I, but not 68K-II, was phosphorylated in vitro at tyrosine residues by fps kinase and by epidermal growth factor receptor/kinase, the latter reaction being dependent on Ca2+ and epidermal growth factor. Western blot analysis with affinity purified anti-68K-I and anti-68K-II antibodies showed that 68K-I was located in only certain tissues, especially human placenta, whereas 68K-II was present in many human and rat tissues."

https://openalex.org/W1560775505,"Abstract Calcium bound to the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ -ATPase was removed by chelating free calcium ion with EGTA. The kinetic calcium binding reaction to the calcium-unbound ATPase was studied by varying the pH (6.0-8.8) and temperature (0-20 degrees C) at a saturating concentration of 50-100 microM [Ca2+]. At pH 6.0 and 0 degrees C, calcium sites of the enzyme at a rate of t1/2 approximately 10 s. By increasing the pH from 6.0 to 8.8, about half of the total calcium sites were converted from a slow binding state to a rapid binding state (less than 2s). The maximum level was reached at about pH 7.4, and the midpoint of the conversion was observed at about pH 6.7. On the other hand, the slow binding reaction to the other sites was not significantly affected by the pH increase. At pH 7.0 and 20 degrees C, about 90% of the total calcium sites rapidly (less than 2s) bound calcium. The present results suggest that pH and temperature resolve the kinetics of two pools of calcium bound to the Ca2+-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1558655886,"Abstract Calpactin I, a calcium-binding protein associated with the membrane cytoskeleton, has been reported to bind to a calcium-dependent manner to fodrin, to certain phospholipids, and to F-actin. We have investigated the interaction between calpactin I and fodrin. Using a gel filtration assay, we observed one or more calpactin I molecules were bound calcium-dependently only at high concentrations of calpactin (greater than 1 microM), indicating that the interaction is of only moderate affinity. At higher concentrations of calpactin I, the calpactin coprecipitated with fodrin in a calcium-dependent manner. The molar ratio of calpactin to fodrin tetramer in the precipitate was greater than 25:1, indicating that the calpactin binds to a large number of sites. Moreover, the monomeric form of calpactin I (p36), which did not induce precipitation of fodrin, showed no evidence of saturation in its binding to fodrin even when more than 30 mol of p36 were bound per mole of fodrin tetramer. Several proteins other than fodrin, including clathrin, alpha-actinin, and neurofilament-H, also interacted calcium-dependently with calpactin I in the gel filtration assay. These results demonstrate that the interaction between calpactin and fodrin is not of high affinity, is not readily saturated, and is not specific for fodrin. Our results suggest that calpactin's interaction with fodrin is a particular example of a calcium-dependent, but promiscuous, binding of calpactin to proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1589848172,"Multifrequency phase-modulation lifetime data were acquired for sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence decay was complex and was fitted either with three exponentials or with bimodal Lorentzian distributions of lifetimes. Ca2+ binding to the high affinity sites in the ATPase produced an increase of 11% in the center of the main component of the bimodal distribution, shifting the lifetime from 4.04 to 4.50 ns. The effects of solvent on the ATPase were studied with the enzyme dissolved in reverse micelles of detergent bis-(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate in hexane. Increasing amounts of water up to a water/bis-(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate molar ratio of 4 produced marked changes in the fluorescence emission of the protein. Comparison of data obtained for micellar solutions of tryptophan or ATPase indicated that the tryptophan residues in the protein are protected from exposure to water. Correlation of water effects on emission intensity and lifetimes suggested that interaction with solvent may result in structural changes that cause a mixture of dynamic and static quenching of ATPase intrinsic fluorescence. Evidence for an effect of hydration on the structure of the active site was obtained by measurements of the fluorescence properties of fluorescein isothiocianate-labeled ATPase in reverse micelles."
https://openalex.org/W1568942767,"Submitochondrial particles prepared by treatment of mitochondria with ammonia and silicotungstic acid were found to be deficient in coupling factor 6 according to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting and had reduced ATP-Pi exchange activity. Requirement of coupling factor 6 for passive proton conductance through mitochondrial F0 was investigated by assaying the ability of depleted particles to sustain NADH-induced proton fluxes as measured by the quenching of 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine fluorescence. The depleted particles themselves showed negligible quenching, but the quenching increased markedly after treating the particles with oligomycin. The data show for the first time that coupling factor 6-depleted complexes have an active proton channel that can be blocked by oligomycin. Therefore, coupling factor 6 is not essential for inhibitor-sensitive proton conductance through mitochondrial F0."
https://openalex.org/W1513799920,"The fluorescent reagent 9-anthroylnitrile (ANN) reacted preferentially with serine among various amino acids tested. When the myosin subfragment-1 (S-1) was incubated with ANN, the 9-anthroyl (AN) group was covalently incorporated into the S-1 heavy chain. The incorporation of the AN group was enhanced by the presence of ATP and ADP. In the presence of ATP, 0.98 mol of the AN group was maximally incorporated into S-1. The resulting S-1 derivative exhibited four absorption maxima in the range of 300-400 nm and fluoresced strongly with an emission maximum at 462 nm upon excitation at 390 nm. The spectral properties were similar to those of the AN-derivatives of serine and polyserine. When 0.98 mol of the AN group was incorporated into S-1, the K+- and Ca2+-ATPase activities decreased to 30%, while the Mg2+-ATPase activity increased to 220% of the original value. Tryptic digestion of the labeled S-1 revealed that the AN group was attached only to the NH2-terminal 23-kDa tryptic peptide of the S-1 heavy chain. Neither the 20-nor the 50-kDa peptide was labeled with ANN. The results suggest that a serine residue, which becomes more reactive in the presence of the nucleotide, is located in the 23-kDa tryptic peptide of S-1."
https://openalex.org/W1516445829,"Topically applied heparin and heparan sulfate disaccharides, with the basic structure Δ-4,5 uronyl-(1 å 4)-glucosamine and bearing a sulfate at the C-6 position of the glucosamine residue, are antihemostatics as potent as heparin, producing uncontrollable hemorrhage from small blood vessels. The finding that other sulfated disaccharides with the same sulfate:hexosamine:uronic acid ratios but with the sulfate at a different position (C-2), or with different glycosidic linkage (1å3), were inactive as inhibitors of hemostasis indicates that a specific structure is needed to produce the effect. The inhibitory activity of the normal hemostatic process could be reversed by ATP. Molecular models show that part of the disaccharide inhibitors and ATP hold a similar structural conformation.—Nader, H. B.; Tersariol, I. L. S.; Dietrich, C. P.

https://openalex.org/W1583570180,"Abstract The aurovertin-F1 complex was used to monitor fluorescence changes of the mitochondrial adenosine triphosphatase during multi- and uni-site ATP hydrolysis. It is known that the fluorescence intensity of the complex is partially quenched by addition of ATP or Mg2+ and enhanced by ADP (Chang, T., and Penefsky, H. S. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 2746-2754). In the present study low concentrations of ATP (0.03 mM) induced a marked fluorescence quenching which was followed by a fast fluorescence recovery. This recovery could be prevented by EDTA or an ATP regenerating system. The rate of ATP hydrolysis by the aurovertin-F1 complex and the reversal of the ATP-induced fluorescence quenching were determined in these various conditions. ITP hydrolysis also resulted in fluorescence quenching that was followed by a recovery of fluorescence intensity. Under conditions for single site catalysis, fluorescence quenching was observed upon the addition of ATP. This strongly indicates that fluorescence changes in the aurovertin-F1 complex are due to the binding and hydrolysis of ATP at a catalytic site. Therefore the resulting ADP molecule bound at this catalytic site possibly induces the fluorescence recovery observed."
https://openalex.org/W1564180997,"The effect of salt intake and reduction of renal mass (RRM) on plasma immunoreactive atrial natriuretic peptide (iANP) levels in conscious rats was studied. Rats were divided into RRM and sham-operated groups, and then further subdivided into groups infused with 1 or 6 mEq of sodium per day. Plasma urea nitrogen increased in the groups with RRM. Plasma sodium, sodium balance, and heart rate did not differ between the sham and RRM groups. Rats with RRM maintained on 1 mEq of sodium per day did not have an elevation of water intake, arterial pressure, or plasma iANP. Rats with RRM maintained on 6 mEq of sodium per day had significantly (P less than 0.05) elevated water intake, arterial pressure, and plasma iANP. Arterial pressure and plasma iANP were correlated (r = 0.800) for rats with RRM on either 1 or 6 mEq of sodium per day. Increased plasma iANP in the RRM group on 6 mEq per day was not caused by either RRM or high sodium alone; it was an effect of RRM plus high salt intake. The increase in plasma iANP in the RRM group may be caused by the increase in arterial pressure, possibly due to an increase in extracellular fluid volume. ANP may not be responsible for the sustained increase in fractional sodium excretion observed in RRM."
