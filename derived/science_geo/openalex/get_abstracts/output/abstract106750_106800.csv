https://openalex.org/W1497318066,"Human plasma glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) is a distinct extracellular selenoenzyme that detoxifies hydroperoxides when used with GSH in high (mM) non-physiological concentrations. We have discovered that NADPH and human thioredoxin reductase (TR) by itself or with thioredoxin (Trx) are efficient electron donors to this human plasma peroxidase. Incubation of 0.05 microM TR with 0.25 microM GSH-Px, in a system free from GSH, resulted in reduction of t-butyl hydroperoxide. Addition of Trx, 2.5 and 5 microM, respectively, further increased the rate of the reaction. These data were obtained using an assay measuring the oxidation of NADPH. A direct assay demonstrated the formation of cumyl alcohol from cumene hydroperoxide in this GSH-independent peroxidase reaction. Incubation of 0.25 microM GSH-Px with a low concentration of GSH (10 microM), representing the upper level in plasma, plus excess glutathione reductase and NADPH did not result in any reduction of t-butyl hydroperoxide. However, after addition of 2.5 microM human glutaredoxin, a linear peroxidase reaction started. The results suggest that extracellular TR, Trx, or glutaredoxin are reductants for the selenium-dependent peroxidase rather than GSH."
https://openalex.org/W1574929990,"KC, the product of an immediate early gene induced in mouse fibroblasts by platelet-derived growth factor, was synthesized as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli and binds with 0.8 nM affinity to mouse neutrophils. Human neutrophils also bind recombinant KC at a site competitive with human interleukin (IL8) and Gro-alpha/MGSA, consistent with binding at the IL8 type B receptor (IL8RB). The cDNA corresponding to human IL8RB hybridizes strongly with two restriction fragments in murine genomic DNA, representing candidate receptor genes for KC. Molecular cloning of both mouse genomic DNA and neutrophil exudate cell cDNA libraries yielded a receptor with approximately 68% sequence identity to both the human IL8 type A and B receptors. Transient expression of the murine receptor cDNA in COS cells conferred binding ability to KC and a related gene product, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) with high affinity (approximately 5 nM). Human IL8 was a poor agonist for this expressed receptor (Kd = approximately 400 nM). The potent activity of human IL8 on mouse polymorphonuclear neutrophils is not consistent with binding on the cloned receptor and suggests that murine homologues of IL8 and an IL8 type A receptor remain to be identified. Our data indicate that KC is the murine homologue of human Gro-alpha, and the KC receptor is an IL8 type B receptor homologue capable of binding both KC and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 with high affinity."
https://openalex.org/W1544609822,"IP4BP/Synaptotagmin II is an inositol-1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4) or inositol polyphosphate-binding protein, which is accumulated at nerve terminals. Here we report a novel function of the C2B domain, which was originally thought to be responsible for Ca(2+)-dependent binding to phospholipid membranes. A study of deletion mutants showed that about 30 amino acids of the central region of the C2B domain of mouse IP4BP/synaptotagmin II (315 IHLMQNGKRLKKKKTTVKKKTLNPYFNESFSF 346) are essential for inositol polyphosphate binding. This binding domain includes a sequence corresponding to the squid Pep20 peptide, which is also known to be essential for neurotransmitter release (Bommert, K., Charlton, M. P., DeBello, W. M., Chin, G. J., Betz, H., and Augustine, G. J. (1993) Nature 363, 163-165), suggesting that inositol polyphosphate has some effect on neurotransmitter release. Rabphilin 3A, another neuronal protein containing C2 domains, cannot bind IP4, indicating that the IP4 binding property is specific to the C2B domain of synaptotagmin. Phospholipid and IP4 binding experiments clearly indicated that the C2A and C2B domains have different functions. The C2A domain binds phospholipid in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner, but the C2B domain binds inositol polyphosphate and phospholipid irrespective of the presence of Ca2+. Our data suggest that the C2B domain of synaptotogamin is the inositol polyphosphate sensor at the synaptic vesicle and may be involved in synaptic function."
https://openalex.org/W1515131982,"BGT1, the Na(+)-and Cl- coupled betaine transporter, is responsible for the accumulation of high concentrations of the non-perturbing osmolyte betaine in hypertonic Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and presumably in the hypertonic renal medulla. In MDCK cells, the increase in activity of the betaine transporter is preceded by an increase in transcription of BGT1 and in the abundance of BGT1 mRNA. To investigate the molecular mechanism of transcriptional regulation by tonicity, we have characterized the 5'-flanking region of the gene. Transient transfection assays in MDCK cells cultured in isotonic or hypertonic medium using luciferase reporter constructs containing various fragments of the 5'-flanking region revealed that the region spanning base pairs -69 to -50 5' to the transcription initiation site (-69/-50) has hypertonicity-responsive enhancer activity. A double-stranded -69/-50 concatemer cloned 5' to an SV40 basal promoter and luciferase reporter gene in hypertonic cells exhibited more than 11-fold the activity in isotonic cells. Expression assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays of mutants of -69/-50 identified a smaller region that is required for hypertonicity to induce increased expression and a slowly migrating band on mobility shift assays."
https://openalex.org/W1896547048,"The ATP-dependent glutathione S-conjugate export pump, named GS-X pump, has been shown to eliminate a potentially cytotoxic glutathione-platinum (GS.Pt) complex from tumor cells, thereby modulating glutathione (GSH)-associated resistance to cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin) (Ishikawa, T., and Ali-Osman, F. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 20116-20125). The present study provides evidence that the GS-X pump is functionally overexpressed in cisplatin-resistant human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 (HL-60/R-CP) cells, in which the cellular GSH level was substantially enhanced. Indeed, the rate of ATP-dependent transport of the GS.Pt complex, measured with plasma membrane vesicles, was about 4-fold greater in HL-60/R-CP cells than in HL-60 cells. Three membrane proteins with apparent molecular masses of 200, 110, and 70 kDa were overexpressed in HL-60/R-CP cells, whereas P-glycoprotein (MDR1) was not immunologically detected in the membrane preparations from resistant and sensitive cells. Unlike in HL-60 cells, increased numbers of intracellular vesicles were observed in the cytoplasm of HL-60/R-CP cells. Fluorescence microscopy with syn-(CICH2,CH3)-1,5-diazabicyclo-[3.3.0]-octa-3,6-dione-2,8-dione (monochlorobimane) revealed that the fluorescent glutathione S-conjugate accumulated in intracellular vesicles of the cisplatin-resistant cells in an energy-dependent manner. The GS-X pump is suggested to contribute to vesicle-mediated excretion of GSH-drug conjugates from cells. In addition, both HL-60 and HL-60/R-CP cells underwent cell differentiation in response to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, retinoic acid, and dimethyl sulfoxide, resulting in proliferation arrest as well as a remarkable decrease in the c-myc mRNA levels. After cell differentiation, a significant decrease was observed in the activity of ATP-dependent transport of the GS.Pt complex in membrane vesicles prepared from both HL-60/R-CP and HL-60 cells. These results suggest that the expression of the GS-X pump in both cisplatin-resistant and -sensitive cells is related to cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1580968716,"Abstract The obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii produces a nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase (NTPase) (nucleoside-triphosphatase, EC 3.6.1.15) activable by dithiol-containing compounds. We have isolated the genomic DNA for the NTPase from the RH strain of Toxoplasma and determined the nucleotide sequence of three tandemly arranged open reading frames termed NTP1, NTP2, and NTP3. We have also isolated and sequenced cDNAs for NTP1 and NTP3; no cDNA for NTP2 was obtained. The two cDNA clones encode proteins that are more than 97% identical at the amino acid level but significantly differ within two small domains, indicating the presence of NTPase isoforms. Both possess N-terminal signal sequences and two regions with partial homology to certain known ATP binding motifs: the glycine-rich loop common to many ATP binding proteins and the beta-phosphate binding domain found in the hexokinase-actin-hsp70 family. Antiserum against a NTP1-fusion protein immunoprecipitated NTPase activity from extracellular parasites that was increased in activity by treatment with dithiothreitol, confirming the identity of the cloned genes. By immunofluorescence, the NTPase is located in vesicular structures within the parasite, and in infected cells it is secreted into the vacuolar space and becomes partially associated with the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane. Since the vacuolar membrane is freely permeable to small molecules of < 1300 Da, host cell ATP may serve as a substrate for the NTPase and supply the energy for parasite-directed processes in the vacuolar space."
https://openalex.org/W1525229180,"Dephosphorylation by the catalytic subunits of protein phosphatases 1 (CS1) and 2A (CS2) reveals that mature protein kinase C is phosphorylated at two distinct sites. Treatment of protein kinase C beta II with CS1 causes a significant increase in the protein's electrophoretic mobility (approximately 4 kDa) and a coincident loss in catalytic activity. The CS1-dephosphorylated enzyme cannot autophosphorylate or be phosphorylated by mature protein kinase C, indicating that a different kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation at this site. The loss of activity is consistent with dephosphorylation on protein kinase C's activation loop (Orr, J. W., and Newton, A. C., (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 27715-27718). Treatment with CS2 results in a smaller shift in electrophoretic mobility (approximately 2 kDa) and no loss in catalytic activity. Furthermore, the CS2-dephosphorylated form can autophosphorylate and thus regain the electrophoretic mobility of mature enzyme, consistent with dephosphorylation at protein kinase C's carboxyl-terminal autophosphorylation site, which is modified in vivo (Flint, A. J., Paladini, R. D., and Koshland, D. E., Jr. (1990) Science 249, 408-411). In summary, two phosphorylations process protein kinase C to generate the mature form: a transphosphorylation that renders the kinase catalytically competent and an autophosphorylation that may be important for the subcellular localization of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2700239370,"The expression of Lewis histo-blood group antigen is determined by the Lewis type alpha(1,3/1,4) fucosyltransferase encoded in Fuc-TIII gene (Le gene) on chromosome 19. Weak hemagglutination reactions are often observed in the Lewis blood typing to cause false-negative reactions. The level of CA19-9 tumor marker, defined as sialylated Le(a) (sLe(a)), is influenced by the Lewis blood phenotype. The sLe(a) antigen is also considered to play a role in hematogenous metastasis of tumor cells. The accurate genotyping of Fuc-TIII gene would be, therefore, necessary for solving above questions. In addition to the two missense mutations previously reported by us, i.e. the T59G and the G508A, further sequence analyses revealed a new single base substitution, the T1067A, changing the Ile356 to Lys in the catalytic region. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methods were developed for the detection of these three missense mutations and applied in 15 Lewis negative (le/le) and 65 Lewis positive individuals (Le/Le or Le/le). These methods were found to be useful for genetic diagnosis for the Lewis histo-blood typing. All le alleles had the T59G mutation, whereas none of the Le alleles did. The le alleles were divided in two types, le1, having the G508A mutation, and le2, having the T1067A mutation. The T1067A mutation reduced the enzyme activity less than 10%, whereas the G508A mutation in the catalytic domain made the enzyme completely inactive. The frequency of occurrence of Le, le1, and le2 in the Japanese population by random sampling study was found to be 66, 30, and 4%, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2045528121,"Syntaxins are a family of vesicular transport receptors that are involved in membrane traffic through both the constitutive and regulated secretory pathways. Syntaxins 1A/B,2,3, and 4 are principally associated with the plasma membrane. Two of the syntaxins, 1A and 1B, have been suggested to be the docking receptors for synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane. The most distant member of the family, syntaxin 5, has been found in the Golgi region and has significant homology (35% identity) with Sed5p, an essential protein in yeast which is required for vesicular transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi stack. Here we present evidence that syntaxin 5 performs an analogous function in ER to Golgi transport in mammalian cells. Transient expression of an hemagglutinin-tagged full-length clone of syntaxin 5 and a truncated mutant lacking the transmembrane domain inhibited the transport of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein to the Golgi stack. Under these conditions, vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein accumulated in pre-Golgi intermediates, which were strongly enriched in syntaxin 5. Our results suggest that syntaxin 5 is the functional mammalian homologue of Sed5p and provides evidence for its role in regulating the potential targeting and/or fusion of carrier vesicles following export from the ER."
https://openalex.org/W1534717671,"The silver mutation in mice causes progressive graying of hair due to the loss of functional follicular melanocytes. Recently the silver locus gene (called Pmel 17) has been cloned; its encoded product shares homology with a chick melanosomal matrix protein and a bovine retinal pigment epithelial protein. Although the sequence of the silver gene and the correlation of its expression with pigment production have been reported, its function in melanogenesis is still unknown. In an effort to characterize that function, we have synthesized the predicted carboxyl-terminal peptide of the mouse Pmel 17 protein and generated a rabbit polyclonal antibody (alpha PEP13) to it; that antibody recognized the silver protein specifically. The immunoaffinity-purified silver protein lacked all of the known melanogenic catalytic activities which other tyrosinase-related proteins (TRP) have, nor did it appear to modulate any of those TRP activities. Metabolic labeling experiments demonstrated that the silver protein disappears in vivo within a few hours, indicating that it is rapidly degraded, or quickly processed to lose its carboxyl terminus. Cross-reactivity experiments showed that a recently reported anti-melanosomal matrix protein antibody (alpha MX) also recognizes the silver protein, although at a different epitope from that of alpha PEP13. Using Western immunoblotting, we analyzed subcellular fractions isolated from B16 F10 melanoma cells and found that the silver protein was rich in the melanosome fraction but was absent from coated vesicles which deliver TRPs to melanosomes. These results suggest that the silver locus product is a melanosomal matrix protein which may contribute to melanogenesis as a structural protein, although the possibility remains that it also has a novel catalytic function in melanogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1788868849,"Patch clamp of the outer nuclear membrane of isolated Xenopus oocyte nucleus was used to measure the single-channel properties of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor (IP3R). The observed channel was activated by IP3, inhibited by heparin, and Ca(2+)-selective, with ion permeabilities PCa:PK:PCl = 8:1:0.05. In symmetric KCl buffer, the channel was ohmic (113 picosiemens in 140 mM KCl) at low channel currents but rectified at higher positive currents. The nuclear IP3R exhibited three conductance substates: a main substate occurring approximately 90% of channel open time, a double substate with twice the main substate conductance and a third substate with half the main substate conductance, which was observed rarely. Channel open probability fluctuated over time and among nuclei. Mean open channel durations of the main and double substates were approximately 5 and 1 ms, respectively. Many channels exhibited periods of closure lasting seconds, and most inactivated permanently within 5 min of IP3 stimulation. These results provide the first characterization of the single-channel properties of the IP3R in its native membrane environment and demonstrate that patch clamp electrophysiology of intact nuclei can be used to directly record currents through the IP3R."
https://openalex.org/W1545683217,"The 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase is responsible for the regulation of fatty acid synthesis by phosphorylation and inactivation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. The porcine liver 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase 63-kDa catalytic subunit co-purifies 14,000-fold with a 38- and 40-kDa protein (Mitchelhill, K.I. et al. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 2361-2364). The 63-kDa subunit is homologous to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Snf1 protein kinase, which regulates gene expression during glucose derepression. Peptide amino acid and polymerase chain reaction-derived partial cDNA sequences of both the pig and rat liver enzymes show that the 38-kDa protein is homologous to Snf4p (CAT3) and that the 40-kDa protein is homologous to the Sip1p/Spm/GAL83 family of Snf1p interacting proteins. Sucrose density gradient and cross-linking experiments with purified 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase suggest that both the 38- and 40-kDa proteins associate tightly with the 63-kDa catalytic polypeptide in either a heterotrimeric complex or in dimeric complexes. The 40-kDa subunit is autophosphorylated within the 63-kDa subunit complex. The sequence relationships between the mammalian 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase and yeast Snf1p extend to the subunit proteins consistent with conservation of the functional roles of these polypeptides in cellular regulation by this family of metabolite-sensing protein kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1608445399,"Diverse amphiphiles act on cellular cholesterol metabolism as if signaling regulatory sites. One class (oxysterols) mimics the homeostatic effects of excess cell cholesterol, inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis and stimulating plasma membrane cholesterol esterification. A second class of amphiphiles has effects precisely opposite to the oxysterols, i.e. they immediately inhibit plasma membrane cholesterol esterification and progressively induce 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase activity and cholesterol biosynthesis. This second class of agents includes steroids, hydrophobic amines, phenothiazines, ionophores, colchicine, cytochalasins, and lysophosphatides, most of which interact with P-glycoproteins. These data support a general hypothesis describing cellular cholesterol homeostasis. (a) Proteins regulating sterol metabolism are embedded in intracellular membranes where their activities are governed by the local level of cholesterol. (b) Excess plasma membrane and lysosomal cholesterol circulates through those intracellular membranes and sets the homeostatic activities therein. (c) The two classes of agents mentioned above affect cholesterol homeostasis by increasing or decreasing, respectively, the ambient level of cholesterol at the sites of regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1615207997,"Abstract Resonance Raman spectra were measured selectively for the form, which had been assigned to a intermediate formed in the reaction of oxidized cytochrome c oxidase with hydrogen peroxide at ambient temperature. A single oxygen isotope-sensitive band was found at 803 cm-1 for the reaction with H2(16)O2 (at 769 cm-1 with H2(18)O2) upon excitation at 607 nm, the wavelength of the difference absorption maximum characteristic of the peroxy intermediate. Upon excitation at shorter wavelengths (down to 580 nm), the Raman spectrum simply became weaker without yielding any new features. When H2(16)O18O was used, two bands were observed at 803 and 769 cm-1 (within an accuracy of 0.5 cm-1), but with only half the intensity of those observed with H2(16)O2 or H2(18)O2, which ruled out the possibility that the 803 cm-1 band arose from the O-O or Fe-O2 stretching of the FeIII(O-O-) heme. Conversely, the 34-cm-1 downshift with 18O is in good agreement with the calculated 16O/18O shift (35 cm-1) expected for the diatomic Fe = 16O oscillator at 803 cm-1. This band exhibited an upshift by 1.3 cm-1 in 2H2O, similar to the case of compound II of horseradish peroxidase at neutral pH, and indicative of the presence of a hydrogen bond to the FeIV = O oxygen. The 803/769 cm-1 pair of resonance Raman bands were also observed upon blue excitation, as is the case for the bands found in the dioxygen cycle of this enzyme (Ogura, T., Takahashi, S., Hirota, S., Shinzawa-Itoh, K., Yoshikawa, S., Appelman, E. H., and Kitagawa, T. (1993) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 115, 8527-8536). This observation provides the first direct characterization of the 607 nm form of this enzyme in its reaction with H2O2."
https://openalex.org/W1595328360,"Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) is a heterodimer consisting of protein disulfide isomerase and a unique large subunit. Recent studies showing that an absence of MTP is a cause of abetalipoproteinemia indicate that MTP is required for the assembly of very low density lipoproteins in the liver and chylomicrons in the intestine. In this study, complementary DNA encoding the large subunit of hamster MTP was cloned. The cDNA sequence was used to design a 50-base pair oligonucleotide probe for a solution hybridization assay to quantitate MTP large subunit mRNA levels in a study of MTP regulation in male Syrian Golden hamsters. In animals fed a low fat diet, MTP exhibited a proximal to distal gradient of expression in the intestine. MTP activity and large subunit mRNA levels in the liver were about 25 and 10% that found in the proximal intestine, respectively. To investigate the effect of diet on MTP, hamsters were maintained for 31 days on one of four diets: 1) control low fat, 2) high fat, 3) low fat, high sucrose, or 4) diet 1 followed by a 48-h fast. The high fat diet increased MTP large subunit mRNA levels in the liver and throughout the small and large intestine. A 55 and 126% increase was observed in the liver and intestine (duodenum and jejunum), respectively. A 40% increase of intestinal MTP protein mass was also observed. The high sucrose diet caused a significant 55% increase in hepatic MTP mRNA levels but did not significantly affect the intestinal mRNA levels. MTP mRNA levels were unchanged in response to fasting. A short term dietary study showed that intestinal MTP mRNA was up-regulated within 24 h after initiating a high fat diet. An acute hepatic response was not observed. The regulation of MTP mRNA levels by high fat diets was compared to that of the liver fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) and apolipoprotein B (apoB). ApoB mRNA levels were not significantly affected by a high fat diet. Although L-FABP mRNA levels were increased in the liver and intestine, the onset of the changes did not parallel that of MTP. These results suggest that L-FABP, apoB, and MTP, three proteins which play important roles in the transport of fatty acids and triglyceride in the liver and intestine, are not coordinately regulated by diet in hamsters."
https://openalex.org/W1605195776,"N-Ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF) is an ATPase required in multiple stages of the secretory and endocytic pathways. NSF requires other proteins for its action in vesicular transport including the soluble NSF attachment proteins (SNAPs), which act to bind NSF to integral membrane proteins. We have investigated the ATPase activity of NSF and its modulation by alpha- and gamma-SNAPs using His6-tagged recombinant proteins. His6-NSF possessed ATPase activity, which was enhanced in a dose-dependent manner by immobilized (i.e. plastic-adsorbed) but not soluble His6-tagged SNAPs. NSF displayed complex enzyme kinetics consistent with the possession of two ATPase domains with different affinities for ATP. SNAPs apparently enhanced NSF ATPase activity primarily by decreasing the Km of its low affinity site 100-fold. In vivo this effect would be predicted to sensitize the low affinity site to physiological ATP concentrations. Thus SNAPs could act as a molecular switch by turning on the normally dormant low affinity ATPase site of NSF."
https://openalex.org/W1488699512,"The protective antigen (PA) component of anthrax toxin contains two sites that are uniquely sensitive to proteolytic cleavage. Cleavage at the sequence RKKR167 by the cellular protease furin is absolutely required for toxicity, whereas cleavage by chymotrypsin or thermolysin at the sequence FFD315 inactivates the protein, apparently by blocking the ability of PA to translocate the catalytic moieties of the toxins, lethal factor (LF) and edema factor (EF), to the cytosol of eukaryotic cells. To specify the role of the chymotrypsin-sensitive site of PA in the translocation of LF, we altered residues 313-315. None of the mutations in this region interfered with the ability of PA to bind to its cellular receptor, be cleaved by cell surface furin, and bind LF. Substitution of Ala for Asp315 or for both Phe313 and Phe314 reduced the ability of PA to intoxicate cells in the presence of LF by 3- and 7-fold, respectively. Substitution of Phe313 by Cys greatly reduced the rate of LF translocation and delayed toxicity. The rate at which the Cys-substituted PA killed cells was increased significantly by blocking the sulfhydryl group with iodoacetamide, suggesting that this added Cys interacts with cellular proteins and slows translocation of LF. Deletion of the 2 Phe rendered PA completely non-toxic. This deleted PA protein lacked the ability shown by native PA to form oligomers on cells and in solution and to induce release of 86Rb from Chinese hamster ovary cells. These results suggest that the chymotrypsin-sensitive site in PA is required for membrane channel formation and translocation of LF into the cytosol. PA double mutants were constructed that cannot be cleaved at either the furin or chymotrypsin sites. These PA proteins were more stable in Bacillus anthracis culture supernatants and may therefore be useful as a replacement for PA in anthrax vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W1493960655,"To identify a site within the insulin receptor ectodomain which forms a binding pocket for B25 Phe and is responsible for initiating conformational changes required for high affinity binding of insulin we have used a novel photoreactive insulin, despentapeptide-(B26-B30) [B25 p-azidophenylalanine-alpha-carboxamide] insulin (APC insulin). This derivative has a highly photoreactive azido group incorporated into the aromatic ring of the B25 phenylalanine amide. APC insulin bound to human insulin receptors overexpressed on a transfected Chinese hamster ovary cell line (P3-A) with an apparent potency of 9-fold relative to that of native insulin and stimulated lipogenesis in rat adipocytes with an average potency equal to porcine insulin. Addition of biotin to the B1 Phe amino group to form despentapeptide-(B26-B30) [B1 (6-biotinylamidocaproyl)phenylalanine B25 p-azidophenylalanine-alpha-carboxamide] insulin derivative (Bio-APC insulin) did not adversely affect receptor-binding affinity and provided a convenient ligand for purification of cross-linked complexes. The efficiency of receptor cross-linking with these reagents was high (70%). To identify the site(s) of cross-linking, the insulin receptor in P3-A cells was first metabolically labeled with various individual 3H-labeled amino acids and then photoaffinity labeled with 125I-Bio-APC insulin, isolated, and digested with Lys-C endoproteinase. The resulting cross-linked peptide fragments were separated by streptavidin-affinity chromatography and sequenced. The smallest identified fragment comprised residues 704-718 of the COOH terminus of the alpha-subunit of the insulin receptor. This B25 Phe cross-linked region of the alpha-subunit lies just upstream of the Exon 11-encoded 12-amino acid COOH-terminal region. Aromatic residues in this predicted alpha-helical region may form a binding pocket for B25 Phe to initiate conformational changes required for stabilizing the high affinity binding state."
https://openalex.org/W1569064115,"Apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 is the major protein component in low density lipoprotein (LDL); it contains the binding domain for the LDL receptor and the attachment site for apolipoprotein(a) in lipoprotein(a). ApoB-48 is colinear with the amino-terminal half of apoB-100 and misses the part of the molecule required for LDL receptor interaction and lipoprotein(a) formation. ApoB-48 mRNA is produced by the editing of apoB-100 mRNA, a process by which the codon CAA for Gln-2153 is changed to UAA, an in-frame stop codon. We used the cloned catalytic component of the rat apoB mRNA-editing enzyme (REPR) to construct a replication-defective recombinant adenoviral vector containing REPR cDNA (AvREPR) and a control vector (Av1LacZ4) containing a beta-galactosidase cDNA to investigate the effect of REPR gene delivery in C57BL/6 mice. Intravenous injection of AvREPR in mice resulted in efficient transduction of liver cells, where REPR mRNA and protein were overexpressed, reaching a peak at 7 and 12 days, returning toward control levels at 39 days after AvREPR administration. ApoB mRNA editing activity in liver extracts showed changes parallel to those of REPR mRNA expression; the proportion of edited apoB mRNA in the total hepatic apoB mRNA increased from approximately 60% to more than 90% at the peak of REPR expression. The proportion of plasma apoB-100 in AvREPR-transduced animals decreased from approximately 50% to < 10% of total plasma apoB concentration. Plasma very low density lipoproteins were polydisperse in control animals with an average diameter of 54.9 +/- 20.6 nm (uninjected control) and 54.7 +/- 16.8 nm (Av1LacZ4-treated), respectively. They became much smaller (average diameter 39.3 +/- 12.7 nm) and more uniform in size at day 12 following AvREPR administration. On the same day, the normal plasma LDL (26.2-25.5 nm) was almost completely eliminated in treated animals. Adenovirus-mediated transfer of the REPR cDNA is an efficient method to reduce plasma apoB-100 and normal LDL production."
https://openalex.org/W1529834383,"Members of the cytokine receptor family have a consensus WSXWS sequence (WS motif) in the extracellular domain. With the interleukin-2, erythropoietin, and prolactin receptors, alteration of the WS sequence disrupts ligand binding and receptor signaling. The structural basis for these effects is unclear. To examine the role of the WS equivalent sequence (Y222GEFS226) in the function of the growth hormone receptor, each residue was mutated to alanine or to the WS consensus sequence. Although we used stable cell lines expressing all of these mutants, we show only three mutants, Y222A, G223A, and S226A, which display lower ligand affinity. Using conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies, we show that Y222A and S226A receptors have structural perturbations, which result in decreased signal transduction. This was shown by a decreased ability of growth hormone to stimulate protein synthesis and to transactivate the c-fos promoter with these mutants. The crystal structure of the ligand-occupied extracellular domain of growth hormone receptor indicates that Tyr222 and Ser226 have important interactions within the second beta-barrel domain, providing a structural basis for our results. The WS segment is not involved in sequence-specific accessory protein interaction, as mutation of residues Gly223, Glu224, and Phe225 does not alter receptor function."
https://openalex.org/W1908822140,"Two rhamnogalacturonases from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus aculeatus have been cloned and characterized. A cDNA library from A. aculeatus was constructed, and a novel rhamnogalacturonase B was isolated by expression cloning in yeast. For this purpose a new plate screening assay was developed, specific for the detection of rhamnogalacturonase activity. The rhamnogalacturonase A, known from previous reports, was shown not to be expressed in yeast in an active form. Therefore, rhamnogalacturonase A was purified, peptide sequences were obtained, and full-length cDNAs encoding the enzyme were isolated using a polymerase chain reaction-generated product as a probe. Comparison of the deduced primary structures indicates that the two rhamnogalacturonases are structurally different. This is further supported by the finding that polyclonal antibodies raised against native rhamnogalacturonase A do not cross-react with rhamnogalacturonase B. The cloned genes were transformed into Aspergillus oryzae for high level expression. The recombinant enzymes were purified and characterized, revealing significant differences in glycosylation pattern and substrate specificity as well as in pH and temperature optima and stability. Data from the hydrolysis of apple rhamnogalacturonan with the recombinant rhamnogalacturonases suggest that the two enzymes exert their action at different sites in the backbone."
https://openalex.org/W1587200897,"The synthesis in vitro of poly(U) on a poly(A) template with oligo(dT)15 primer by poliovirus RNA polymerase 3Dpol (280 ng/ml) is strongly stimulated (50-100 fold) by the addition of purified poliovirus polypeptide 3AB. The synthesis of product continues linearly with time for up to 90 min. The reaction with 3Dpol alone can be reactivated and similarly enhanced by the addition of 3AB at 30 min of incubation. Optimal stimulation is achieved under conditions where the concentration of 3Dpol and of template is low, when the molar ratio of 3AB to 3Dpol is about 100:1 and that of 3AB to poly(A) is about 25:1. In the presence of 3AB, the yield of product made by 3Dpol is much increased but its size is unchanged. From a number of basic proteins and peptides tested, a few were found which also exhibited limited enhancement of polymerase activity. The stimulatory effect of 3AB is probably related to its ability to bind both the template-primer, poly(A).oligo(dT)15, and 3Dpol (Molla, A., Harris, K. S., Paul, A. V., Shin, S. H., Mugavero, J., and Wimmer, E. J. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 27015-27020). RNA synthesis on purified poliovirus RNA with oligo(dT)15 primer is enhanced by 3AB about 5-10 fold, and this reaction is highly sensitive to detergent."
https://openalex.org/W1557196074,"P-glycoprotein, an active transporter that pumps a diverse range of hydrophobic compounds out of cells, has recently been proposed to function as, or regulate, a volume-activated, anion-selective channel (Valverde, M.A., Diaz, M., Sepulveda, F. V., Gill, D. R., Hyde, S. C., and Higgins, C. F. (1992) Nature 355, 830-833). In this study a number of compounds known to inhibit P-glycoprotein-mediated drug pumping were tested for their effect on the osmotically activated release from HeLa cells of I-, a known substrate of volume-activated anion channels, and taurine, a sulfonic amino acid that serves as an important organic osmolyte in many cell-types. Tamoxifen, 4-iodotamoxifen, and pyrrolidino-4-iodotamoxifen (idoxifene) were potent blockers of osmotically activated I- and taurine efflux. Other known P-glycoprotein inhibitors (verapamil, cyclosporin A, pimozide, trifluoperazine, ICI 164, and ICI 182) were less effective. For all compounds tested the effect on taurine release was the same as that on I- release, consistent with the hypothesis that swelling-activated taurine release is via anion-selective channels. There was no positive correlation between the effect of the inhibitors on osmotically activated solute release and their effect on P-glycoprotein-mediated drug transport. In contrast, there was a strong positive correlation between the IC50 values for the effect of the inhibitors on volume-activated solute release and those for their effect on calmodulin. These data raise doubts as to whether the effect of P-glycoprotein inhibitors on volume-activated channels is a consequence of their interaction with P-glycoprotein and indicate a possible role for calmodulin, or a cell component having at least some physical similarities, in controlling channel activity."
https://openalex.org/W1601518034,"A deletion derivative of the integrase protein from human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) consisting of the central core domain (amino acids 50-212) has been characterized biophysically and biochemically. This deletion mutant is of particular interest for structural studies as it can carry out the disintegration reaction suggesting the presence of an active site and, under certain conditions, is more soluble than full-length integrase. The circular dichroism and fluorescence of the deletion mutant and the 288-residue full-length integrase were similar, indicating that the core residues maintain similar overall conformations in both proteins. The deletion mutant is approximately 10% more alpha-helical than the full-length protein. Analytical centrifugation demonstrated that both proteins undergo monomer-dimer association although the truncated protein showed slightly less tendency to dimerize; the dissociation constants were 2.5 x 10(-5) M for the full-length protein and 8.0 x 10(-5) M for the truncated protein. The disintegration activity of both proteins was also compared. Although a higher concentration of the truncation mutant was required for optimal activity, the mutant did not have altered pH or Mn2+ requirements relative to the full-length protein. The combined biophysical and enzymatic studies suggest that this truncated form of HIV-1 integrase is likely to be useful for structural studies."
https://openalex.org/W2340062325,"Calmodulin (CaM)-kinase II is inactive in the absence of Ca2+/CaM due to interaction of its autoinhibitory domain with its catalytic domain. Previous studies using synthetic autoinhibitory domain peptides (residues 281-302) identified several residues as important for inhibitory potency and suggested that His282 may interact with the ATP-binding motif of the catalytic domain. To further examine the autoinhibitory domain, site-specific mutants were expressed using the baculovirus/Sf9 cell system. The purified mutants had many biochemical properties identical to wild-type kinase, but mutants H282Q, H282R, R283E, and T286D had 10-20% constitutive Ca(2+)-independent activities, indicating that these residues are involved in the autoinhibitory interaction. The Ca(2+)-independent activities of the H282Q, H282R, and R283E mutants exhibited 10-fold lower Km values for ATP than the wild-type kinase. Wild-type and mutant kinases, except T286A and T286D, generated Ca2+ independence upon autophosphorylation in the presence of Ca2+/CaM, and those mutants having constitutive Ca2+ independence also exhibited enhanced Ca2+/CaM-independent autophosphorylation. This Ca(2+)-independent autophosphorylation resulted in a decrease in total kinase activity, but there was little increase in Ca(2+)-independent activity, consistent with autophosphorylation of predominantly Thr306 rather than Thr286. These results are consistent with an inhibitory interaction of His282 and possibly Arg283 with the ATP-binding motif of the catalytic domain, and they indicate that constitutively active CaM-kinase II cannot autophosphorylate on Thr286 in the absence of bound Ca2+/CaM. Based on these and other biochemical characterizations, we propose a molecular model for the interaction of a bisubstrate autoinhibitory domain with the catalytic domain of CaM-kinase II."
https://openalex.org/W1512704096,"Central to spectrin's function is its association with the plasma membrane. The linking proteins ankyrin and protein 4.1 partly mediate this association, and their interactions with spectrin are well understood. Both beta I (erythrocyte) and beta II (fodrin, beta G) spectrin also associate with unknown protein receptors in crude membrane preparations by ankyrin and protein 4.1 independent mechanisms. As a first step to understanding this interaction, kinetic and equilibrium assays have been used to monitor which regions of beta I and beta II spectrin inhibit the binding of purified 125I-labeled bovine brain spectrin to demyelinated and NaOH-stripped bovine brain membranes. A series of 19 recombinant proteins spanning the entire sequence of beta II spectrin, including an alternatively spliced NH2-terminal isoform (beta II epsilon 2 spectrin), were prepared as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. Also prepared were peptides representing the alternatively spliced COOH-terminal domain found in beta I epsilon 2 spectrin (muscle spectrin). Two distinct sequence motifs inhibited the binding of native brain spectrin. Membrane association domain 1 (MAD1) was represented in all fusion peptides that included spectrin repeat 1. These peptides slowed the kinetics of brain spectrin binding and inhibited up to 46% of the maximal binding under the conditions of these assays (apparent Ki < or = 0.2 microM). Peptides representative of repeats 2-17 of beta II spectrin were devoid of inhibitory activity. The second membrane association domain (MAD2) was identified in penultimate COOH-terminal sequences (domain III) of both beta II and beta I epsilon 2 spectrin. These sequences were absent in beta I epsilon 1 (erythrocyte) spectrin. MAD2 competitively inhibited over 80% of brain spectrin binding in these assays, with an apparent Ki < or = 0.1 microM. Direct binding studies confirmed that both MAD1 and MAD2 peptides associated with membranes with affinities comparable to their inhibition constants. Sequence comparisons suggest that MAD1 is created by the insertion of two non-homologous sequence motifs into repeat 1, extending it from 106 to 122 amino acids. Similarly, MAD2 encompasses a putative site of beta gamma-heterotrimeric G-protein binding called the pleckstrin homology domain, and MAD2 may in fact be the pleckstrin homology domain although this has not been rigorously proven. Collectively these studies identify two novel functional motifs in spectrin that mediate ankyrin independent association with membranes. We hypothesize that these motifs and their still to be discovered ligands play a primary role in the nascent assembly and stabilization of an ordered and polarized spectrin skeleton."
https://openalex.org/W1534834860,"In order to facilitate structure-function studies of the glucagon receptor by site-directed mutagenesis, we have designed and synthesized a gene for the rat glucagon receptor. The gene codes for the native 485-amino-acid protein but contains 91 unique restriction sites. To characterize gene expression, a highly specific, high affinity antipeptide antibody was prepared against the receptor. The synthetic gene was expressed in transiently transfected monkey kidney (COS-1) cells. COS cells expressing the synthetic receptor gene bound glucagon with affinity and specificity similar to that of hepatocytes containing native receptor. The transfected COS cells also showed increased intracellular cAMP levels in response to glucagon. The functional role of an aspartic acid residue in the NH2-terminal tail of the receptor was tested by site-directed mutagenesis. This site in the related growth hormone releasing factor receptor was shown to be responsible for the little mouse (lit) genetic defect that results in mice of small size with hypoplastic pituitary glands. Mutant glucagon receptors with amino acid replacements of Asp64 were expressed at normal levels in COS cells but failed to bind glucagon. These results indicate that amino acid Asp64 may play a key role in glucagon binding to receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2126364354,"We asked at what point in the metabolic cascade of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) to low density lipoproteins (LDL) the accessibility of proteolytic cleavage sites in B-100 changes, and we evaluated the effect of hypertriglyceridemia on the proteolytic accessibility, secondary structure, and receptor-binding affinity of B-100 in LDL subspecies of varying density. Limited proteolysis with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease and cathepsin D identified the density (about 1.033 g/ml) between two LDL subspecies, designated LDL-1 and -2, as the transition point during VLDL metabolism of both normolipidemic (N-) and hypertriglyceridemic (HTG-) subjects at which accessibility to protease attack changed in three peptide regions of B-100. Hypertriglyceridemia greatly altered proteolytic accessibility of B-100 in the denser LDL subspecies. Specifically, B-100 in HTG-LDL exposed more cleavage sites than in N-LDL, including two novel sites, approximately 120 and approximately 130 kDa from the NH2 terminus in the small and dense subspecies (designated LDL-4, -4.5 or -5, d = 1.048-1.062 g/ml). Analysis of circular dichroic spectra indicated no difference in helical content between B-100 in N- and HTG-LDL but showed a greater content of beta-structure in HTG-LDL. Binding affinity for the LDL receptor of human fibroblasts decreased markedly with increasing density among HTG-LDL subspecies (by approximately 50% for LDL-4.5 or -5). We conclude that the changes in proteolytic accessibility observed between LDL-1 and -2 and in LDL-4, -4.5, or -5 indicate significant differences in local conformation of B-100 at specific peptide regions. The association of exposure of more cleavage sites, especially novel sites in the NH2-terminal regions, with greatly decreased receptor-binding affinity in LDL-4.5 or -5 suggests that altered local conformation in B-100 apart from the putative receptor-binding domain might affect interaction with the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1526743742,"CD45, a leukocyte-specific protein tyrosine phosphatase involved in signal transduction, has previously been shown to associate with a 32-kDa phosphoprotein in human T-lymphocytes and T-lymphoma cell lines. The 32-kDa protein was purified and its coding cDNA cloned. Since expression of the protein was found to be restricted to B- and T-lymphocytes it was termed LPAP (lymphocyte phosphatase-associated phosphoprotein). LPAP exists in two differentially phosphorylated forms in resting human T-lymphocytes c, both of which undergo alterations during T-lymphocyte activation. Analysis of LPAP protein and mRNA expression in CD45-deficient mutant T-cell lines suggests that LPAP protein is subjected to degradation in the absence of its binding partner, CD45. Stable expression of LPAP protein seems to require particular portions of CD45 distinct from the phosphatase domains. In pervanadate-treated human T-lymphocytes LPAP undergoes phosphorylation on tyrosine residues in vivo. Since tyrosine phosphorylation of LPAP is undetectable in T-lymphocytes expressing enzymatically active CD45, these data suggest that LPAP likely represents a novel substrate for CD45."
https://openalex.org/W1515731900,"The herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) origin binding protein (UL9 protein) interacts specifically with the HSV-1 encoded single strand DNA-binding protein ICP8 (Boehmer, P.E. and Lehman, I.R. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90, 8444-8448). A UL9 mutant protein (UL9DM27) that lacks the C-terminal 27 amino acids shows normal origin-specific DNA binding and retains its DNA-dependent ATPase and helicase activities, but has a greatly reduced affinity for ICP8. The extreme C-terminal portion of the UL9 protein is therefore required for ICP8 binding. The helicase activity of the UL9DM27 protein is approximately 8-fold greater than that of the wild type UL9 protein and is not stimulated by ICP8. The UL9DM27 protein has a reduced ability to replicate origin-containing plasmids in vivo. Consequently, the interaction between the UL9 protein and ICP8 is likely to be important for origin-dependent DNA replication in vivo, presumably to promote efficient unwinding of the DNA at an HSV-1 origin of DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1564107771,"The question of whether the effects of insulin and glucagon on hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity are mediated largely by changes in the phosphorylation state of the enzyme or by changes in the quantity of enzyme protein was investigated by measuring enzyme protein and mRNA levels. If phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is responsible for the observed changes in HMG-CoA reductase activity, one would not expect to see changes in immunoreactive protein or mRNA levels in response to induction of diabetes, administration of insulin, or administration of insulin and glucagon. It was found that hepatic HMG-CoA reductase mRNA levels were decreased to 12% of control in diabetic rats. Immunoreactive protein was reduced to essentially undetectable levels. Administration of insulin restored both mRNA and immunoreactive protein levels. Glucagon blocked these effects. Enzyme activity changes were fully accounted for by changes in HMG-CoA reductase mRNA and immunoreactive protein. Fasting caused parallel falls in HMG-CoA reductase activity and immunoreactive protein levels with a lesser effect on mRNA levels. The insulin-mediated changes in HMG-CoA reductase gene expression correlated well with changes in blood glucose levels, indicating a physiological effect. Taken together, these results indicate that insulin and glucagon regulate HMG-CoA reductase gene expression largely at the level of enzyme protein through changes in mRNA concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1577368283,"Two immunoreactive proteins (75 and 80 kDa) were detected in rat brain and rabbit aorta using a polyclonal peptide-directed antibody to the C terminus of the zeta isoenzyme of protein kinase C (PKC). The 75-kDa protein resembled authentic PKC zeta; it was recovered in cytosolic fractions prepared in the presence or absence of Ca2+. The 80-kDa protein, however, bound to the particulate fraction in a Ca(2+)-dependent and reversible manner, but phosphorylated a synthetic peptide derived from the autoinhibitory domain of PKC epsilon in a Ca(2+)-independent but phospholipid- and diacylglycerol-dependent manner. Purification of the 80-kDa protein from rat brain, which separated two PKC zeta-immunoreactive proteins of 81.3 and 79.4 kDa, was achieved by EGTA extraction of the particulate fraction followed by chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel, phenyl-Sepharose, and hydroxylapatite. The 81.3-kDa protein copurified with PKC alpha, and the 79.4-kDa protein copurified with PKC beta and PKC gamma. PKC alpha, -beta and -gamma isoenzymes separated by hydroxylapatite chromatography all cross-reacted with anti-PKC zeta. Using recombinant PKC isoenzymes, however, anti-PKC zeta was shown to recognize rPKC alpha, rPKC beta 1, and rPKC beta II but not rPKC gamma. The regulatory properties of these isoenzymes differed from each other and depended on the particular substrate. PKC alpha was found to separate into two peaks on hydroxylapatite chromatography. The first peak exhibited regulatory properties characteristic of PKC alpha, whereas the second peak (PKC alpha') exhibited constitutive activity. PKC alpha' appears to be derived from PKC alpha by irreversible oxidative modification."
https://openalex.org/W1486994736,"Abstract The synthesis, maturation, and localization of the human homolog of the bacterial ATP-dependent Lon protease have been studied in cultured cells and in a cell-free system. Immunofluorescence microscopy of cells transfected with a recombinant human Lon protease-FLAG epitope chimeric protein confirmed the mitochondrial location of human Lon protease. The primary product of transcription and translation directed by a human LON cDNA in vitro had an apparent mass of approximately 107 kDa, and incubation of the translation product with isolated rat liver mitochondria converted the precursor into the approximately 100-kDa mature form. The latter pelleted with mitochondria and was resistant to trypsin digestion. Maturation of human Lon protease in vitro was dependent on mitochondrial inner membrane potential, as the uncoupling agent 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) completely blocked this process. In intact cultured cells treated with DNP, newly synthesized Lon protease also accumulated as the precursor form, and subsequent removal of DNP allowed the precursor to be translocated into mitochondria and cleaved to its mature form. A pulse-chase experiment in the absence of DNP showed that the Lon protease precursor is converted to the mature form with a half-time of < 2 min and that the mature human Lon protease is indefinitely stable in intact cells. Submitochondrial fractionation and immunoblot analysis of rat liver mitochondrial proteins using the polyclonal anti-human Lon protease antiserum indicated that the protease is located exclusively in the matrix. These data demonstrate that the maturation of human Lon protease is characterized by steps similar to those reported for other mitochondrial matrix proteins."

DNA sequencing shows 18 exons, most of which encode structural or functional modules; exceptions are domains G1-B and G2-B, which are split into two exons and the G3 lectin domain, which is encoded by three exons. There is one expressed epidermal growth factor-like exon and in addition a non-expressed pseudo-exon encoding a heavily mutated epidermal growth factor-like domain. Intron sizes have been determined by restriction mapping and inter-exon polymerase chain reaction; a 30-kb intron separates exons 1 and 2. Exon 1 has been mapped by primer extension and S1 nuclease protection; it encodes 381 base pairs (bp) of 5'-untranslated sequence. There is a minor promoter which initiates transcription an additional 68 bp 5' of the major promoter start site. DNA sequence is reported for a 529-bp fragment encompassing exon 1, including 120 bp of 5'-flanking DNA comprising the promoter. This promoter is lacking the TATAA or CCAAT elements but has several putative binding sites for transcription factors. A 922-bp DNA fragment with 640-bp 5'-flanking DNA and 282-bp exon 1 sequence showed higher promoter activity in transfected chondrocytes than in fibroblasts, is completely inactive in the reverse orientation, and is strongly enhanceable in the forward direction by the SV40 enhancer."
https://openalex.org/W1516827124,"Abstract A Tetrahymena pyriformis gene orthologue to the mouse CCT gamma gene has been cloned and sequenced. The coding region of this gene, named TpCCT gamma, is interrupted by six introns and codes for a protein of 559 amino acid residues. This protein shares a 57.6% identity with the mouse CCT gamma protein whereas in average a 30% identity was found with CCT alpha proteins from mammalian to yeast. The expression of this gene was investigated by Northern blot hybridization in Tetrahymena exponentially growing cells and cells during cilia recovery. The TpCCT gamma gene is expressed producing a unique transcript of 2.1 kilobases. A relevant aspect of our findings is the coordinated response of TpCCT gamma and tubulin genes to cilia regeneration. TpCCT gamma and tubulin transcripts reached higher levels between 45-120 min of reciliation compared to those found in exponentially growing cells. These high levels could be the result of the increase in apparent transcription rates detected at 60 min of reciliation. We also observed that TpCCT gamma transcripts are not increased after exposure of Tetrahymena cells to a heat-shock (28-->34 degrees C). Our results seem to indicate an important role of this gene in the differentiation process of ciliogenesis."

The purified protein retained its high affinity for the antiischemic drugs emopamil (Kd = 4 nM), opipramol (IC50 = 15 nM), trifluoperazine (IC50 = 2 nM), and for Zn2+ (IC50 = 2 microM). Ferguson plots revealed a molecular mass of 27.2 kDa. Partial amino acid sequence information was obtained by Edman degradation and revealed no homology to known protein sequences. Antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the first 25 NH2-terminal amino acid residues specifically immunoprecipitated the [3H]azidopamil photoaffinity-labeled polypeptide and recognized the protein in Western blots. Cross-linking with a variety of homo- and heterobifunctional agents lead to the formation of dimers. Since in the purified preparation no other subunit could be identified with different protein stains, our results indicate that the [3H]emopamil binding site is formed by the homodimer of a novel membrane protein."

The effect of 15-HETE was enantioselective for the S-isomer and could be detected at concentrations as low as 10(-12) M. (11S)-HETE and (5S,15S)-dihydroxy-(6E,8Z,11Z,13E)-eicosatetraen oic acid did also exhibit this effect, whereas other mono-, di-, and trihydroxyeicosanoids as well as the 15-lipoxygenase products of 11,14-eicosadienoic acid, of two eicosatrienoic acid isomers and of 5,8,11,14,17-eicosapentaenoic acid were ineffective. Immunohistochemical studies indicated the expression of a 15-lipoxygenase in cardiomyocytes and in resident heart mast cells. Induction of the beta-adrenergic supersensitivity is paralleled by a selective incorporation of (15S)-HETE into the cellular phosphatidylinositol pool. In contrast, (12S)-HETE, which did not induce beta-adrenergic supersensitivity, was incorporated preferentially into phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Calphostin C, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, blocked both the induction of supersensitivity by (15S)-HETE and its incorporation into phosphatidylinositol. These data suggest that in cardiomyocytes 15-lipoxygenase metabolites specifically induces a signal transduction cascade leading to a supersensitivity of the cells toward beta-adrenergic agonists, which involves the phosphatidylinositol cycle and a protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1541915713,"A truncated dopamine D3-receptor-like mRNA, named D3nf, predicts a protein that differs from the D3-receptor only in the carboxyl terminus. However, such a protein has lost the predicted membrane topology typically found for G protein-coupled receptors. Results presented here show that D3nf mRNA arises from the D3-encoded primary transcript via alternative splicing. This splicing, however, appears to involve cleavage of an unusual 3' splice site. Therefore, we tested the possibility that D3nf mRNA results from a splicing error. If this were the case, D3nf mRNA would be expected to be present in the cytoplasm only at very low amounts, and it would not be expected to be translated into protein. However, the relative abundance of cytoplasmic D3/D3nf mRNA in human cortical tissues was found to be similar. Furthermore, we raised polyclonal antisera against the predicted carboxyl-terminal peptide sequence of D3nf that reacts specifically with a protein expressed in stably D3nf mRNA-expressing COS 7 cells. The use of this antiserum also revealed the presence of a approximately 68 kDa D3nf-like immunoreactive protein in human brain, suggesting that the atypically processed D3nf mRNA is translated."

https://openalex.org/W1528368313,"Earlier studies reached conflicting conclusions as to the ability of the beta 1,4 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GalNAc-T) that synthesizes gangliosides GM2 and GD2 to also produce gangliotriosylceramide (GA2). We constructed an experimental system in which to address this question. Wild type Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells contain ganglioside GM3 as the most complex glycosphingolipid (GSL), whereas the CHO glycosylation mutant Lec2, which is deficient in sialylation, accumulates lactosylceramide with little GM3 being produced. We transfected both cell types with a plasmid containing a cloned GalNAc-T. Whereas transfected CHO cells produced GM2 as the major complex GSL, the major product in transfected Lec2 cells was GA2. Both types of transfected cells but not the untransfected cells expressed the transfected gene and contained high levels of enzyme activity for synthesizing both GM2 and GA2 in vitro. In summary, these results indicate that this enzyme can in fact synthesize GA2 as well as GM2 and GD2. In addition, these findings suggest that in CHO cells the synthesis of GM3 in vivo has priority over GA2 synthesis for utilization of the substrate lactosylceramide, resulting in little GA2 being produced even though GalNAc-T is present and active. Thus, competition for substrate between glycosylation pathways may have profound effects on the GSL pattern of cells."
https://openalex.org/W1551148108,"We have used a luciferase reporter gene under the transcriptional control of a cAMP response element (CRE) to monitor the effects of G-protein alpha subunits on cAMP-regulated gene expression and to examine muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) functional coupling to G-proteins. Expression in JEG-3 cells of a mutationally activated Gi alpha-2 in which glutamine 205 is replaced with leucine (Q205L) decreased forskolin-stimulated expression from the CRE-luciferase gene by up to 75%. Similarly, mutation of glycine 43 (corresponding to glycine 12 in p21ras) to valine decreased forskolin-stimulated expression from the CRE-luciferase gene by a maximum of 50%, indicating that this mutation activates the G-protein and is potentially oncogenic. Transfection of the activated Q205L G(o) alpha subunit decreased forskolin stimulation of CRE-luciferase expression. Transfected wild type G(o) alpha was also able to couple the m4 mAChR receptor to inhibition of AC. The amino-terminal myristoylation site was removed from wild type Gi alpha-2 and Q205L Gi alpha-2 by changing glycine 2 to alanine (G2A). Gi alpha-2 with the G2A and Q205L mutations was unable to decrease forskolin stimulation of CRE-mediated luciferase activity. Furthermore, G2A Gi alpha-2 was unable to couple the m4 mAChR to inhibition of AC. Thus, myristoylation is required both for the function of constitutively active Q205L Gi alpha-2 and for receptor-mediated activation of wild type Gi alpha-2."
https://openalex.org/W1565004098,"To identify amino acid residues within diphtheria toxin that participate in receptor recognition, we made alanine replacements for each of 12 solvent-accessible residues within a loop (residues 516-530) of the toxin's R domain, which prominently extends from the main surface of the domain. Amino acid replacements were generated in an enzymatically attenuated form of the toxin (in compliance with regulations for cloning in Escherichia coli), and the mutant toxins were purified and assayed for toxicity on Vero cells. The largest effects were seen with K516A and F530A, which caused approximately 22- and approximately 10-fold increases, respectively, in the toxin concentration required for half-maximal inhibition of protein synthesis (IC50). Smaller effects were seen at certain other sites and no effect at still others. K516A caused approximately 500-fold reduction in ability to compete with radiolabeled wild-type toxin for receptors, and F530A gave approximately 100-fold reduction. The small differences in IC50 with the mutants, compared with differences in receptor binding, are attributable to nonlinearity in the cytotoxicity assay with the enzymatically attenuated toxin. K516A and F530A also inhibited the receptor-blocking activity of the isolated R domain. Neither mutation caused a change in the circular dichroism spectrum of the R domain. These results indicate important roles for Lys-516 and Phe-530 in receptor recognition. In addition, on the basis of cytotoxicity data, four other residues (Tyr-514, Val-523, Asn-524, and Lys-526) are proposed play roles in receptor binding. These findings support the notion that the toxin's receptor binds to the solvent-exposed face of the R domain opposite the catalytic domain."

A., Grant, B., Bhushan, F., Pillemer, E., Rainville, I.R., and Long, G. L. (1992) Blood 79, 1456-1465), was investigated. Two single mutations (Glu20-->Ala and Val34-->Met) and the naturally occurring double mutation were created by site-directed mutagenesis and were expressed in human kidney 293 cells. Purified recombinant protein C with the mutation glutamate to alanine at position 20 is defective in the assays of activated partial thromboplastin time, factor Va inactivation, and fibrinolysis. Mutation from valine to methionine at position 34 has only a minor effect. Activation of Glu20 mutants by thrombin-thrombomodulin was not enhanced by phospholipid vesicles and showed a different calcium dependence compared with the wild type, suggesting that Gla20 is important in the interaction of the protein C Gla domain with a phospholipid-mediated site on the thrombomodulin molecule. Glu20-substituted protein C is not inhibited by calcium ion in its interaction with the calcium-dependent monoclonal antibody H-11, suggesting that this mutation has lost the calcium-induced, lipid-independent conformational transition of the protein C Gla domain. These data indicate that the loss of Gla20 causes the major familial dysfunction of protein C to associate with phospholipid as well as to undergo Ca(2+)-dependent, lipid-independent conformational changes and are consistent with the importance of Gla20 in both external and internal Ca2+ binding based upon the x-ray-derived structure of the homologous Gla domain in bovine prothrombin."
https://openalex.org/W1602403912,"We identified two enhancer elements of the mouse GLUT1 gene responsive to serum, growth factor, and oncogenes; the first enhancer element (enhancer-1) is located 2.7 kilobases upstream of the cap site of the gene, and the second one (enhancer-2) is located in the second intron of the gene (Murakami, T., Nishiyama, T., Shirotani, T., Shinohara, Y., Kan, M., Ishii, K., Kanai, F., Nakazuru, S., and Ebina, Y. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 9300-9306). In the present work, we describe the role of insulin in activation of these two enhancers. NIH/3T3 HIR3.5 cells, which express a large number of insulin receptors, were stably transformed by hybrid genes containing the enhancer(s) and promoter of GLUT1 gene and the coding region of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene as a reporter gene. In stable transformants of the reporter gene without the enhancers, the CAT mRNA was not induced by insulin; however, in clones containing the reporter gene with enhancer-1, the CAT mRNA was induced by insulin at 30 min and reached a maximum at 1 h. In clones transfected by the reporter gene with enhancer-2, the CAT mRNA was induced at 1 h and reached a maximum at 3 h. To determine the early response element to insulin in enhancer-1, transformants of hybrid reporter genes containing truncated or mutated enhancer-1 were examined. The homologous sequence with the serum response element in enhancer-1 is essential for an early response to insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1491553970,"We have measured the metabolic stabilities of wild-type and 17 temperature-sensitive mutants of T4 lysozyme in HeLa cells, in Xenopus egg extract, and in reticulocyte lysate. [35S]Methionine-labeled T4 lysozymes were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, injected into HeLa cells, and their degradation rates were determined. Wild-type T4 lysozyme has a half-life of 4 h; the half-lives of 16 lysozyme variants ranged from 2 to 10 h. Surprisingly, the most temperature-sensitive enzyme in the set, R96H, was significantly more stable (half-life = 10 h). Different T4 lysozyme variants yield conflicting answers to the proposed relationship between thermal and metabolic stabilities. For mutations at Thr157 there is no correlation between melting temperature and half-life. By contrast, T4 lysozymes mutated at various positions show a definite correlation between the two parameters. Treatment of injected HeLa cells with the lysosomotropic agents chloroquine or ammonium chloride did not alter the stability of T4 lysozyme. However, the enzyme's half-life increased 10-fold in HeLa cells depleted of ATP. Although T4 lysozyme is degraded rapidly within HeLa cells, the molecule is stable in reticulocyte lysate and Xenopus egg extract. Presumably, there is a specific proteolytic event(s) in HeLa cells which is not manifest in the in vitro extracts."
https://openalex.org/W1570330395,"An ion-counterion interaction between the lysine of the NKXD motif in the GTPase domain and an aspartate in the inserted helical domain of alpha subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, Lys-278 and Asp-158, respectively, of Gs alpha is shown to be essential for activation by AlF4- and partially so for interaction with beta gamma dimers and activation by GTP and receptor. However, this domain interaction is not required for activation by the non-hydrolyzable analog guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. Proximity of the helical domain to the GTPase domain is thus involved in the fundamental inactive-->active transition of the protein in a way that further distinguishes alpha subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins from ras and ras-like GTPases that lack helical domains and are neither activated by AlF4- nor combine with beta gamma dimers."
https://openalex.org/W1669925768,"Human HB4C5 hybridoma cells produce a lung cancer-specific human monoclonal antibody that possesses a lambda light chain on which a N-linked carbohydrate chain is attached at the first complementary determining region. Up to six light chains of various sizes are secreted by the original and concanavalin A (ConA)-resistant HB4C5 clones. Two of these six light chains are derived directly from the HB4C5 original and are 30 and 32 kDa in size. The structural difference between these two light chains has been shown to be a N-linked carbohydrate located at a single site. The other four variants, which are derived from ConA-resistant variants, have light chain sizes ranging from about 26 to 29 kDa. No changes in the secretory forms were observed when glycosylation was inhibited by the addition of tunicamycin, indicating that the heterogeneous light chain forms produced by these ConA-resistant variants resulted from the size differences of core polypeptides and not from N-glycosylation. Sequence analysis from one of the variant light chains revealed that its V lambda gene segment differs markedly from identified human V lambda gene segments (at most, 60% homology with known human V lambda subgroups) and, furthermore, the variant light chain shares 80% homology with the rabbit V lambda gene. In addition, the antigen binding ability of these variant antibodies changed significantly in both specificity and affinity. These results suggest that heterogeneous light chains expression by ConA-resistant variants may provide a new way for developing an antigen-specific human monoclonal antibody repertoire."
https://openalex.org/W1642049351,"The restriction endonuclease TaqI exhibits extreme specificity for its cognate sequence, TCGA, but a direct hydrogen bond readout model fails to account for this property. The present study examines the role of phosphate contacts in the enzyme-substrate and transition state complexes. An S-methyl group was introduced into each of the pTpCpGpApNpN internucleotide linkages using a hybrid chemical-enzymatic synthesis, in which sulfur substitutions of nonbridging phosphate oxygens directed the placement of methyl groups. The resulting 12 diastereomerically pure phosphate-modified substrates were tested for binding and cleavage by TaqI. The largest binding effects were induced by pro-Sp methylations at the pTpCpGA phosphates, which destabilized the enzyme-substrate complex by 1.0-1.6 kcal/mol. Cleavage of the modified strand was inhibited completely by modifications at the TpCpGpA phosphates and inhibited significantly at the TCGApNp phosphates. Cleavage of both strands was completely inhibited by modification of the TCGpA linkage. Effects on the cleavage of the unmodified strand were used to implicate phosphate modifications that caused global perturbations in the structure of the transition state complex. These results lend support for a model for the specificity of TaqI, in which sequence-specific phosphate contacts are formed in the transition state, thus amplifying the apparent contribution of base contacts to transition state stabilization."
https://openalex.org/W1615102055,"The dipteran insects Chironomus and Drosophila have high mobility group (HMG) 1 proteins that are similar to mammalian HMG1 but contain one instead of two HMG1 boxes. The interaction of the Chironomus HMG1 proteins cHMG1a and cHMG1b with double-stranded and four-way junction DNA was analyzed by investigating the accessibility of defined sequences of the HMG1 box to specific antibodies within the DNA-protein complex in vitro. Antibody epitopes located in the three helices and in the turn between helices 1 and 2 of the HMG1 box were identified on a membrane onto which 90 decapeptides with overlapping sequences spanning the entire sequence of cHMG1a had been bound. Monospecific antibodies directed against selected epitopes were purified from a polyclonal antiserum by affinity chromatography. Helices 1 and 3 as well as the turn between helices 1 and 2 were found to be accessible to antibodies in the complex. In contrast, antibodies recognizing an epitope on putative helix 2 of cHMG1a and cHMG1b were unable to produce supershifts on gels of the DNA-protein complexes with both DNAs. These data suggest that helix 2 of the HMG1 box of proteins cHMG1a and cHMG1b is essentially responsible for contacts with DNA."
