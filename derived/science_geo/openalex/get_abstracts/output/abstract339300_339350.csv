https://openalex.org/W2037549368,"Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy continues to evolve as a primary technique in the study of solids. This review briefly describes some developments in modern NMR that demonstrate its exciting potential as an analytical tool in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, biology, geology, and materials science. Topics covered include motional narrowing by sample reorientation, multiple-quantum and overtone spectroscopy, probing porous solids with guest atoms and molecules, two-dimensional NMR studies of chemical exchange and spin diffusion, experiments at extreme temperatures, NMR imaging of solid materials, and low-frequency and zero-field magnetic resonance. These developments permit increasingly complex structural and dynamical behavior to be probed at a molecular level and thus add to our understanding of macroscopic properties of materials."

Individual octahedral MoO(6) units of the oxide can be imaged, and under certain conditions defects can be created in the surface that are stable in air. The ability to produce nanometer-sized structures on the surface of an oxide is demonstrated and discussed with reference to nanolithographic applications."
https://openalex.org/W2007352636,"Capillary gas chromatography (GC) is rapidly reaching a state of maturity. Recent advances in GC include new highly selective and stable open-tubular columns, capillary sampling techniques, and element-sensitive (plasma) detectors. An impressive growth of modern liquid chromatography continues with an emphasis on the separations of biopolymers, new silica-based and stable polymeric packings, microcolumn techniques, electroosmotically driven separations, and ultrasensitive detection. Supercritical fluid chromatography has gained considerable attention primarily because of its distinctive detection capabilities. Novel combinations of chromatographic techniques with each other, or with spectroscopic methods, continue to be explored."

Mitchell Waldrop (8 Sept., p. 1037) was generated on a VAX with a photoclinometry program developed by Randy Kirk of the U.S. Geological Survey in Flagstaff, Arizona. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory's hypercube computer was not used to generate the panorama shown, as stated in the caption."
