https://openalex.org/W1529354667,"Abstract The Escherichia coli DNA polymerase, in the absence of DNA, contains a single binding site for which all the deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphates complete. Dissociation constants of the enzyme-triphosphate complexes range from 1 x 10-5 to 2 x 10-4 m. Various analogues of the deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphates also bind to the same site on DNA polymerase. The principal structural requirement for detectable binding at this site appears to be possession of a triphosphate group. Binding of triphosphates is inhibited when the concentration of potassium phosphate is increased, and is inhibited, but to a lesser extent, by increasing potassium chloride concentration. In addition, binding is abolished in the absence of Mg++ and in the presence of 9 mm EDTA. The strength of binding decreases with increasing temperature. Binding measurements were made with equilibrium dialysis microcells, which require only 20 µl of protein solution and in which equilibrium with triphosphates is attained within 90 min at 22°."
https://openalex.org/W1658863182,"Abstract Prealbumin was isolated from human plasma by chromatography on columns of diethylaminoethyl Sephadex and Sephadex G-200, followed by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The prealbumin was homogeneous in the analytical ultracentrifuge with an s20,w of 3.7 S and with a molecular weight of about 50,000. Prealbumin formed a protein-protein complex with plasma retinol-binding protein in a molar ratio of 1:1. The interaction of thyroxine with prealbumin was quantitatively studied by the method of equilibrium dialysis with 131I-labeled thyroxine. Studies were conducted at 24° and at 37° in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and in phosphate buffer containing 0.14 m NaCl. Prealbumin was found to possess a single binding site for 1 molecule of thyroxine. The association constant for the thyroxine-prealbumin interaction was approximately 1.6 x 107, and was only slightly affected by temperature change or by NaCl. The binding capacity and affinity of prealbumin for thyroxine were similar in the presence and absence of retinol-binding protein. Moreover, the binding of thyroxine to prealbumin did not interfere with the interaction of prealbumin with retinol-binding protein. The interaction of prealbumin with thyroxine appears to be independent of the prealbumin-retinol-binding protein interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1604378355,"Abstract Cysteine synthetase in Salmonella typhimurium is a multifunctional protein complex of molecular weight 309,000 which catalyzes the two-step synthesis of l-cysteine from l-serine, acetyl-CoA, and sulfide. Certain enzymic and chemical properties of a purified preparation of cysteine synthetase have been studied. O-Acetyl-l-serine at a concentration of 10-4 to 10-3 m causes this complex to dissociate reversibly into 1 molecule of serine transacetylase (mol wt 160,000) and 2 molecules of O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase (mol wt 68,000). Serine transacetylase and O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase have been resolved from one another by Sephadex gel filtration in the presence of O-acetyl-l-serine. The O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase associated with serine transacetylase in the complex appears to be identical with the previously described free O-acetyl-serine sulfhydrylase."
https://openalex.org/W1987567187,"The vowel repertoire of a rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) was explored by means of a computer program that calculated formant frequencies from the area function of the animal's supralaryngeal vocal tract, which was systematically varied within the limits imposed by anatomical constraints. The resulting vowels were compared with those of humans and with recorded vocalizations of nonhuman primates. The computer model indicates that the acoustic ""vowel space"" of a rhesus monkey is quite restricted compared to that of the human. This limitation results from the lack of a pharyngeal region that can change its cross-sectional area. These animals thus lack the output mechanism necessary for production of human speech. Man's speech output mechanism is apparently species-specific."
https://openalex.org/W1506714296,"Abstract Isolation on a preparative scale of thyrotropin-releasing hormone from porcine hypothalami is described. The yields from two batches of 100,000 and 165,000 hypothalami were 2.8 mg and 4.4 mg, respectively. The material with thyrotropin-releasing hormone activity, calculated to be purified about 570,000 times, was active in mice at doses of 1 ng in vivo, and stimulated the secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone from rat pituitaries in vitro at doses of 10 pg. Thin layer chromatography, electrophoresis, and paper chromatography indicated that the material was homogeneous. Histidine, glutamic acid, and proline, which were present in an equimolar ratio, accounted for about 32% of the dry weight of the active material. However, eight synthetic peptides containing histidine, proline, and glutamic acid or glutamine had no thyrotropin-releasing hormone activity at doses as large at 10 µg. Biological activity of thyrotropin-releasing hormone was abolished by diazotized sulfanilic acid, N-bromosuccinimide, or acid hydrolysis, but was not affected by periodate or by incubation with proteolytic enzymes."

Operated subjects showed social indifjerence, failed to display appropriate aggressive and submissive gestures. were expelled from their social group, and evenitlually died. Two juvenile subjects with the lesion restricted to amygdala survived and have rejoinied their social group. Size of lesion and age at operation were major factors in determniting the degree of behavioral change."
https://openalex.org/W1516791381,"Abstract Detailed studies of a relatively large number of human erythrocyte carbonic anhydrases of different electrophoretic mobilities have shown that individually each is very similar to one of the major isozymes, either B or C. The enzymatic activities, the zinc, nitrogen, and amino acid contents, and the molecular weights of members of a given type are similar. Some differences in the tryptic peptides and in the amide contents of the more acidic carbonic anhydrase B type isozymes are seen. Incubation of either carbonic anhydrase B or carbonic anhydrase C at relatively high pH leads to the formation of more acidic isozymes of the same type. These forms generated in vitro appear to be identical with the same type carbonic anhydrases of similar electrophoretic properties isolated from erythrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2046221032,"Removal of the frontal cortex of primates resulted earlier in a psychological deficit usually classified in terms of short-term memory. This classification is based on impairment in performance of delayed-response or alternation-type tasks. We report an experiment in which the classical 5-seconddelay right-left-right-left (R-L-R-L) altenation task was modified by placing a 15-seconid interval between each R-L couplet: R-L . . . R-L . . . R-L . . . . This mnodification made it possible for monkeys with frontal lesions, which had failed the classical task, to perform with very few errors. The result suggests that proper division, parsing of the stream of stimuli to which the organism is subjected, is a more important variable in the mechanism of short-term memory than is the maintenance of a neural trace per se."

https://openalex.org/W2039448665,"Monkeys with orbital frontal ablation, compared with sham-operated controls, showed enhancement of oral tendencies toward nonfood items. Further, unlike the controls, they persistently performed an instrumental response for one of these nonfood items. On the other hand, the lesioned monkeys did not show altered preferences for food versus nonfood items. These findings suggest that reinforcement value and preferential ordering are dissociated by orbital frontal ablation."

Other groups of marmosets receiving preinfection plasmas from the same patients showed no evidence of hepatitis in this experiment. It is, therefore, most probable that hepatitis in marmosets represented transmission of human disease rather than activation of latent ""marmoset hepatitis."""

https://openalex.org/W1595387542,"In sporulating Bacillus subtilis, the cellular concentration of ATP increases very little during vegetative growth in nutrient sporulation medium, shows a small peak at the end of growth, and then remains approximately constant during the developmental period. Therefore, ATP itself does not seem to control the onset of massive sporulation. ATP turns over rapidly because its concentration decreases to one-twentieth of the original value in less than 1 min after replacement of air by nitrogen. Sporulation mutants blocked in the citric acid cycle are unable to maintain the normal ATP concentration after growth has stopped. ATP synthesis is not restored by the addition of acetate or citric acid cycle compounds preceding the block, but it is restored by cycle compounds following the block or by other carbon sources. Other sporulation mutants blocked in some reaction necessary to provide acetyl coenzyme A during the developmental period are also unable to maintain ATP after cessation of growth, but their ATP synthesis is restored by any metabolizable carbon source, including acetate or citric acid cycle compounds. Finally, mutants blocked in the Embden-Meyerhof path or in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex continue to maintain ATP after growth in nutrient sporulation medium has stopped. The measurement of ATP and its response to different compounds can therefore be used to classify sporulation mutants and to localize on the biochemical chart the pathways that may be affected by the mutation."
https://openalex.org/W1511844604,"Abstract The enzyme exchanging formate with the carboxyl of pyruvate was purified 195-fold from extracts of Streptococcus faecalis by a procedure involving protamine treatment, dialysis, and gradient centrifugation. Centrifugation of protamine-treated extract in a 10 to 40% potassium tartrate gradient provided a 65-fold purification and separated the exchange enzyme from pyruvate decarboxylase, acetolactate synthetase, acetolactate decarboxylase, and phosphate-acetyltransferase. A second centrifugation in a 20 to 30% potassium tartrate gradient provided an additional 3-fold purification. The purified preparation contains diphosphothiamine but not coenzyme A, folate, lipoate, biotin, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, Vitamin B12, or flavin. The enzyme has an average molecular weight of 268,000 to 288,000 as estimated by gradient centrifugation and by gel filtration. Purified preparations do not degrade pyruvate. S-Adenosyl-l-methionine has no effect on the purified enzyme; the apparent stimulation of activity with crude extracts apparently results from inhibition of competing reactions. The purified enzyme is rapidly oxidized and inactivated, but it can be stabilized in 30% potassium tartrate containing a reducing complex of 0.001 m FeSO4 and 0.003 m 2,3-dimercaptopropanol. Tris, maleate, and imidazole acetate buffers will substitute for phosphate buffer and phosphate ion is not required for the reaction. Optimal activity is observed over a range between pH 6.7 and 8.7. Purified extracts will exchange formate-14C with the carboxyl group of oxalacetate, α-ketoglutarate, and α-ketobutyrate. The velocities relative to the formate-pyruvate exchange rate of 100% were 100%, 9.9%, and 0.9%, respectively. Purified extracts give Michaelis constants of 0.02 m for pyruvate and 0.058 m for formate. Chloride ion produces an irreversible inhibition of exchange activity. Arsenite (3 x 10-5 m), p-chloromercuribenzoate (2 x 10-3 m), and sodium hypophosphite (6 x 10-6 m) inhibit exchange activity of the crude extract to the extent of 41%, 55%, and 47%, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1506254701,"The four isozymes of mushroom tyrosinase can be partially resolved by analytical electrophoresis on acrylamide gel. Three of the four have similar sedimentation coefficients around 7.2 S, while that of α-tyrosinase is 6.7 S. The molecular weight of β-tyrosinase, calculated from sedimentation velocity and diffusion data, is 123,800, in good agreement with other published values for mushroom tyrosinase. β-, γ-, and δ-Tyrosinase show similar amino acid compositions, while that of α-tyrosinase is different in several respects. Comparison of tryptic peptide maps point to a close similarity among the isozymes, though the α-isozyme displays some differences. The number of tryptic peptides from each of the isozymes, 22 to 25, is consistent with a tetrameric structure composed of very similar or identical subunits, each containing a total of about 23 base (lysine and arginine) residues. Only one NH2-terminal amino acid, isoleucine, is detected from each isozyme by the dansylation procedure and only one COOH-terminal amino acid, valine, by carboxypeptidase A digestion. Ion exchange chromatography of a tryptic digest of β-tyrosinase has led to the isolation and analysis of 28 peptide fragments, among them the presumed COOH-terminal tripeptide, phenylalanine-alanine-valine."

https://openalex.org/W2130398759,"Abstract When an antibody combines with a hemeprotein antigen the fluorescence of the tryptophan residues of the antibody is partially quenched. With fluorescence quenching as an indicator, the stoichiometries and kinetics of the reactions of antihemoglobin A antibodies with various hemoglobins and the reactions of antihuman cytochrome c antibodies with various cytochromes c have been studied. The differences in antigenic specificity between hemoglobins A1, Lepore, and A2 and between human and monkey cytochrome c are easily detected. The data indicate that the number of antigenic sites on a protein is limited and is the factor which controls the number of antibodies bound per antigen molecule. These antigenic sites differ in the rate at which they combine with their respective antibodies, but the second order rate constants for these reactions are about 106 m-1 sec-1."

https://openalex.org/W1552340157,"Abstract The pyrimidine-nucleoside:orthophosphate ribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.2), or pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase, from Bacillus stearothermophilus has been purified and compared with similar enzymes from Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli. The enzyme is stable at 60°, appears to be induced by either uridine or thymidine, and has a molecular weight of approximately 78,000. Unlike nucleoside phosphorylases from most other sources, the thermophile enzyme catalyzes the phosphorolysis of both thymidine (apparent Km = 3.8 x 10-4 m) and uridine (apparent Km = 2.5 x 10-4 m) and, in the synthetic direction, does not distinguish between ribose 1-phosphate and deoxyribose 1-phosphate. It differs from E. coli and B. subtilis nucleoside phosphorylases in many properties including molecular weight, substrate specificity, thermostability, and induction properties."

https://openalex.org/W1558455153,"Cyanide disappears from a medium supporting actively growing cells of Bacillus megaterium, a bacterium isolated from a cyanide enrichment medium containing Fargo clay soil. Whole cells of this organism convert K14CN to asparagine-14C, aspartic acid-14C and 14CO2. Besides cyanide, serine 14C and β-cyanoalanine-14C are effectively converted by whole cells of this organism to asparagine-14C. An analysis of asparagine isolated in an experiment in which whole cells were administered K13C15N and serine-14C shows that the nitrogen and carbon of the amide group is derived from cyanide. β-Cyanoalanine-14C was isolated and identified as a product of this experiment. These results as well as results of analyses of the carbon skeletons of β-cyanoalanine-14C and asparagine-14C from this and other experiments collectively support the hypothesis that a metabolic pathway in this organism begins with the condensation of serine and cyanide to form β-cyanoalanine which in turn is hydrolyzed to asparagine and then to aspartic acid. Furthermore cell-free extracts catalyze the conversion of K14CN and serine to asparagine-14C and aspartic acid-14C as well as the conversion of asparagine-14C to aspartic acid-14C."

Although their general catalytic properties are similar, human phosphoglucomutase I is far more resistant than phosphoglucomutase II to inhibition by urea and by Be++. These enzymes differ significantly from each other and from the two rabbit enzymes in total amino acid composition, fingerprint maps obtained with tryptic digests, and immunological properties. However, the amino acid composition of the tryptic peptide containing the active serine, obtained from human phosphoglucomutase I resembles that from rabbit and flounder phosphoglucomutase I."
https://openalex.org/W1590524698,"Abstract In order to investigate the possible participation of heavy metals in monooxygenase reactions, kinetic and analytical studies were carried out with highly purified preparations of three FAD-containing monooxygenases: salicylate hydroxylase, l-lysine monooxygenase, and imidazole acetate monooxygenase. No significant inhibition was observed by metal-chelating agents tested except for o-phenanthroline against salicylate hydroxylase and bathocuproine against imidazole acetate monooxygenase. The addition of exogenous iron or copper had no effect on the enzyme activities. Colorimetric and emission spectrographic analyses of the enzymes failed to detect iron, copper, or any other metals in significant amount. The significance of the apparent absence of metals in these three monooxygenases and the modes of inhibition by several metal-chelating agents are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2076659592,"Chelate formation by Cu(II) and isonicotinic acid hydrazide has been postulated as an important step in the antitubercular activity of isonicotinic hydrazide (Isoniazid). Reevaluation of the copper-isonicotinic hydrazide system gives evidence for the formation of a Cu(I) species rather than a Cu(II) species. The reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) and the subsequent formation of an isonicotinic hydrazide complex with the latter ion, therefore, may be the critical reaction responsible for the efficacy of isonicotinic hydrazide against Mycobacterium tuberculosis."

However, if the clulture medium containing colchicine (or Colcemid) is made up in tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane buffer, growth of ciliated daughters and regeneration of oral cilia proceed normally. The evidence suggests that the mechanism of this reversal of the effects of colchicine (or Colcemid) is due to a chemical reaction between tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane (or its hydrochloride, or both) and colchicine (or Colcemid), wihich reduces the effective concentration of these mitotic spindle inhibitors reaching the stentors."
https://openalex.org/W1991440781,"THE interaction of lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus with mouse tissues has been discussed recently1–5. The fulminating disease, which occurs in adult mice after intracerebral inoculation with LCM virus, can be ameliorated by several treatments known to impair the immune response of the host, such as X-rays6, amethopterin7, thymectomy8 and anti-lymphocyte serum9. The pathology of the disease10 supports the current view that an immune reaction by the host against the virus or a virus product, located in or on infected cells, plays an essential part in its pathogenesis. A similar mechanism may be important in the chronic autoimmune-like disease in virus carrier mice2,5. Further elucidation of this disease mechanism depends on understanding the nature of the immune response and its target. A question of considerable interest is what the consequences might be for virus infected cells in the event of an immune response against the virus or a virus product. Here we report preliminary experiments involving transplantation of cells from virus carrier mice to syngeneic non-infected recipients which suggest that tissues of mice chronically infected with LCM virus undergo an antigenic change which can be detected by transplant rejection."

One of the four gamma2 heavy chains used in the experiment, however, was as efficient as the gamma1 and gamma3 chains, indicating that there may be two subtypes of gamma2. Inv(1) was more easily detected in one of the two light chains used in the experiment.
