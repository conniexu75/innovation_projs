https://openalex.org/W2015073937,"AMERICAN species of the subfamily Gorgoderinæ (Trematoda) exhibit life-histories which appear to fall into two distinct groups. In the genus Phyllodistomum, the host into which the miracidium penetrates is a freshwater cockle of the family Sphæriidæ, and the cercaria passively enters a dragonfly nymph, where the metacercarial cyst is formed. Life-cycles of this nature have been determined by Goodchild1 and others. In the second type of life-history, as exemplified by that of members of the genera Gorgodera and Gorgoderina, while the miracidial host is again a freshwater cockle, the metacercarial host is usually a tadpole. Goodchild2, Krull3 and Rankin4 have determined experimentally life-histories of this type."

Lees has recently described a modified Haldane respirometer for measuring oxygen uptake as the criterion for that activity3. Along somewhat similar lines, our own studies suggest that the Warburg constant-volume respirometer may prove a valuable tool with which to examine the activities of soil organisms in the breakdown of soil organic matter, or to determine the effect of various treatments in modifying the behaviour of soil organisms."

The present work was undertaken to obtain a quantitative idea of the vitamin B12 activity in cow's milk during the period of indoor feeding, and during the first week at pasture."

It is, of course, well known that acetic acid is formed during the silage fermentation, but it seemed surprising that it should be formed so speedily."
