The <1 Hz cortical slow oscillation (Steriade et al., 1993Steriade M. Nuñez A. Amzica F.

Importantly, it has been proposed that consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memory during NREM sleep essentially relies on the hierarchical nesting of these rhythms (Diekelmann and Born, 2010Diekelmann S.

Phase-locking occurs such that ripples accompanying neural memory reactivation in the hippocampus nest into the excitable troughs of the spindle oscillation, which themselves nest into the excitable up-state of the slow oscillation (Clemens et al., 2007Clemens Z.

This phase-locking presumably favors the redistribution of the representation from predominantly hippocampal toward neocortical networks that serve as long-term storage sites (Diekelmann and Born, 2010Diekelmann S.

Several studies have demonstrated a causal relationship between increased slow oscillation and memory consolidation in humans (Marshall et al., 2006Marshall L. Helgadóttir H. Mölle M. Born J.

Using timed electrical stimulation in rats, Maingret et al., 2016Maingret N. Girardeau G. Todorova R. Goutierre M. Zugaro M. Hippocampo-cortical coupling mediates memory consolidation during sleep.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 959-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar provided evidence that reinforcing the endogenous temporal coordination between hippocampal sharp wave-ripples, cortical slow waves, and spindles can enhance the consolidation of hippocampus-dependent spatial memory. However, so far, there is no experimental evidence demonstrating a causal influence specifically of thalamic activity on the phase-locking between cortical slow oscillations and the subordinate rhythms—thalamo-cortical spindles and hippocampal ripples—in the process of memory formation. This is even more surprising as thalamic spindles emerging first during ontogeny (Khazipov et al., 2004Khazipov R. Sirota A. Leinekugel X. Holmes G.L. Ben-Ari Y. Buzsáki G. Early motor activity drives spindle bursts in the developing somatosensory cortex.Nature. 2004; 432: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), as well as in the course of human nocturnal sleep (Aeschbach and Borbély, 1993Aeschbach D. Borbély A.A. All-night dynamics of the human sleep EEG.J. Sleep Res. 1993; 2: 70-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, Clemens et al., 2007Clemens Z. Mölle M. Eross L. Barsi P. Halász P. Born J. Temporal coupling of parahippocampal ripples, sleep spindles and slow oscillations in humans.Brain. 2007; 130: 2868-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), are suspected to play a central role in forming memory during sleep. Using closed-loop, optogenetic stimulation of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) to induce spindle activity in mice (Figure 1A), we show that only spindles induced during the slow oscillation up-state—that is in-phase coupling—enhance memory for previously learned hippocampus-dependent tasks, whereas spindles occurring out-of-phase with the slow oscillation remain ineffective. Furthermore, in-phase spindle-like stimulation enhanced the co-occurrence of frontal cortical spindles and ripples and, consequently, triplets of slow oscillation-spindle-ripple events. We tested transgenic mice expressing channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2) in parvalbumin (Prv)-expressing inhibitory neurons (Prv-mhChR2-EYFP; n = 26), a dominant subpopulation of the TRN that is sparse in surrounding thalamic nuclei (Asrican et al., 2013Asrican B.

Methods. 2011; 8: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) (Figure 1B; see also Figure S1), on a combined cued/contextual fear-conditioning (FC) task in which a 30 s tone followed by a 2 s shock was delivered in context A during conditioning (Boyce et al., 2016Boyce R.

A neural circuit for memory specificity and generalization.Science. 2013; 339: 1290-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) (see STAR Methods for details; Figure 1C). Retrieval was assessed 24 hr later by measuring freezing (1) to the same context A, as a readout of hippocampal contextual fear memory, and (2) to a tone delivered in a different context B, as a readout of cued fear memory that is not essentially dependent on the hippocampus. During the first 6 hr following conditioning, the mice were subjected to one of three stimulation protocols (Figure 1D; Figure S3; see also Method Details section). In-phase mice (IN) received spindle-like optogenetic stimulation (62.5 ms on/off, 4 pulses) to the TRN during NREM sleep, which occurred in synchrony with the up-states of online-detected slow oscillations. Out-of-phase mice (OUT) were likewise stimulated during NREM sleep but with a random delay between 0.5 and 1.0 s following identification of a slow oscillation up-state. Control mice received no stimulation (NoSTIM). At retrieval, contextual fear memory was selectively enhanced in in-phase mice, whereas out-of-phase mice showed no improvement in contextual fear memory compared with no-stimulation controls (Figure 1E; F2,23 = 8.358, p = 0.002, for one-way analysis of variance [one-way ANOVA]; stimulation condition main effect; NoSTIM versus IN: p = 0.001, NoSTIM versus OUT: p = 0.438, and IN versus OUT: p = 0.007, Fisher’s least significant difference [LSD]). Collectively, these results demonstrate that spindles are not effective per se, but instead enhance hippocampus-dependent memory only if they coincide with the more excitable depolarizing up-state of a slow oscillation (Bergmann et al., 2012Bergmann T.O. Mölle M. Schmidt M.A. Lindner C. Marshall L. Born J. Siebner H.R.

Sleep oscillations in the thalamocortical system induce long-term neuronal plasticity.Neuron. 2012; 75: 1105-1113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Neither in-phase nor out-of-phase stimulation changed memory for cued fear compared with that observed in no-stimulation control mice (F2,23 = 0.051, p = 0.950), indicating that our stimulation in-phase during NREM sleep preferentially benefits hippocampus-dependent memory (Cai et al., 2009Cai D.J. Shuman T. Gorman M.R. Sage J.R. Anagnostaras S.G. Sleep selectively enhances hippocampus-dependent memory in mice.Behav. Neurosci. 2009; 123: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The hippocampal dependency of the effect of in-phase spindle stimulation was assured in 26 additional mice using an object-place recognition task (OPR; Figure S2) known to be sensitive to the effects of sleep (Binder et al., 2012Binder S. Baier P.C. Mölle M. Inostroza M. Born J. Marshall L. Sleep enhances memory consolidation in the hippocampus-dependent object-place recognition task in rats.Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 2012; 97: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Mice receiving stimulation in-phase with the slow oscillation up-state during slow wave sleep (SWS) after learning showed enhanced place memory (in terms of enhanced exploration time for the displaced object) on retrieval testing 24 hr later (F2,23 = 4.338, p = 0.025; Figure S2C). Place memory after out-of-phase stimulation did not differ from memory in the no-stimulation control group. Together, these results suggest that spindle stimulation phase-locked to the slow oscillation up-state specifically enhances consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memory during sleep. The effects of in-phase stimulation on memory formation were not conveyed by gross changes in sleep architecture. Sleep onset and time spent in different sleep stages during the 6 hr interval were closely comparable among the three stimulation conditions (Table S1). Also, the overall density of slow oscillation, spindle, and ripple events did not differ among conditions (Table S2). However, optogenetic spindle stimulation altered the fine-tuned interplay between the three rhythms (Figure 2A). Averaging electroencephalograms (EEGs), time-locked to stimulation onsets, confirmed the emergence of spindle-like activity coalescing with a large negative slow oscillation half-wave during in-phase stimulation; notably, this negative half-wave was absent in the out-of-phase condition (Figure 2B). Moreover, this analysis revealed that the optogenetic spindle-like generation of the anterior TRN induced predominantly frontal cortex (FRO) spindles, which, on average, synchronized to the stimulation. An entrainment by the optogenetic stimulation was also observed for spindles in the hippocampal CA1 region, which is consistent with observations that spindles invade hippocampal structures (Sarasso et al., 2014Sarasso S. Proserpio P. Pigorini A. Moroni F. Ferrara M. De Gennaro L. De Carli F. Lo Russo G. Massimini M. Nobili L. Hippocampal sleep spindles preceding neocortical sleep onset in humans.Neuroimage. 2014; 86: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, Sullivan et al., 2014Sullivan D. Mizuseki K. Sorgi A. Buzsáki G. Comparison of sleep spindles and theta oscillations in the hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 662-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, surprisingly, spindle-like stimulation did not entrain spindles recorded in parietal cortex (PAR). Overall, this distribution indicates that the stimulated TRN regions mediate a specific topographical pattern of spindle activity and influence the hippocampal local field potential within short delays. Determining discrete spindle events within a 750 ms time window following the onset of stimulation revealed for FRO recordings a significantly higher spindle incidence rate for in-phase than out-of-phase stimulation conditions (Figure 3A, left; one-way ANOVA, F3,36 = 60.243, p < 0.001; IN versus OUT: p < 0.001, Fisher’s LSD), as well as a distinct elevation compared with the corresponding no-stimulation conditions, no-stimulation in-phase (IN versus NoSTIM-IN: p < 0.001, Fisher’s LSD), and no-stimulation out-of-phase conditions (OUT versus NoSTIM-OUT: p < 0.001, Fisher’s LSD). Increases in spindle incidence were closely comparable between in-phase and out-of-phase stimulation with reference to the rates during the respective NoSTIM-IN and NoSTIM-OUT control conditions. In the NoSTIM-IN condition, spindle density within 750 ms following detection of a slow oscillation up-state was significantly higher than that for the delayed interval corresponding to the out-of-phase stimulation protocol (NoSTIM-OUT versus NoSTIM-IN: p < 0.001, Fisher’s LSD; Figure 3A), confirming endogenous phase-locking between slow oscillations and spindles. No difference was found for the incidence of PAR and CA1 spindles following stimulation or slow oscillation detection (one-way ANOVA, PAR: F3,36 = 1.275, p = 0.297; CA1: F3,36 = 0.615, p = 0.610). Importantly, whereas the ratio of the total spindle count to the total slow oscillation count (for the 6 hr period of sleep monitoring) was comparable in all three conditions (Figure 3B; Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA, U2 = 3.640, p = 0.162), slow oscillation-spindle coupling (i.e., the proportion of detected slow oscillations that are coupled with a spindle within 750 ms) was distinctly increased for the in-phase condition compared with both out-of-phase and no-stimulation conditions (Figure 3C; Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA, U2 = 16.923, p < 0.001). Time-event correlation histograms also confirmed that spindle modulation during optogenetic stimulation, as observed not only in the cortical EEG but also in local field potential (LFP) recordings from CA1, derives from spindle cycles that are highly synchronized to the imposed stimulation rhythm (Figure 3D), with this synchrony being absent in the no-stimulation condition. Finally, we examined the influence of the TRN stimulation on inter-event intervals by determining the spindle incidence for a time window of 1.5 to 2 s post-stimulus. This analysis did not reveal any persisting effect on the generation of spindles (F3,36 < 1.170, p > 0.170). We then asked whether thalamic spindle stimulation exerts a bottom-up effect on cortical slow oscillations. Averaging EEG responses filtered in the 0.5–4.0 Hz band time-locked to stimulation onset did not reveal any difference in amplitude of slow oscillations occurring during in-phase stimulation and the corresponding interval of the no-stimulation condition (Table S3), excluding an immediate effect of in-phase stimulation on ongoing slow oscillation activity. However, an analysis of slow oscillation negative half-wave peaks in the FRO within a 500 ms interval following stimulus onset (Figure 4A) revealed a distinctly increased probability of the emergence of a slow oscillation during this interval in the out-of-phase condition compared with all other conditions (Figure 4B), including a comparison with an interval of the no-stimulation condition that covered the respective out-of-phase stimulation period (one-way ANOVA, F3,36 = 76.356, p < 0.001; OUT versus NoSTIM-OUT: p < 0.001, Fisher’s LSD). The stimulation-induced slow oscillations emerged mainly during the first 250 ms of the out-of-phase spindle stimulation (Figure 4C, top right), but not in-phase spindle stimulation (Figure 4C, top left). The enhancing effect of out-of-phase stimulation on slow oscillation incidence was also found to be significant in the PAR region (one-way ANOVA, F3,36 = 15.277, p < 0.001; OUT versus NoSTIM-OUT: p = 0.011, Fisher’s LSD). In control analyses, we confirmed that out-of-phase stimulation was performed without a particular phase preference to continuing or newly appearing slow oscillation (Figure S4), whereas in-phase stimulation was consistently performed during a slow oscillation up-state (Figure S4). Overall, these results indicate that spindle stimulation of the TRN can induce slow oscillations in the out-of-phase condition but did not affect the consolidation of contextual memory in this group compared with the no-stimulation control group. We next examined whether spindles induced optogenetically using our protocols are similar to spontaneous spindles in terms of their influence on hippocampal oscillations (Figures S5A and S5B). Previous studies have shown a high propensity for sleep spindles to synchronize hippocampal ripples into their troughs (Clemens et al., 2011Clemens Z. Mölle M. Eross L. Jakus R. Rásonyi G. Halász P. Born J. Fine-tuned coupling between human parahippocampal ripples and sleep spindles.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2011; 33: 511-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, Phillips et al., 2012Phillips K.G. Bartsch U. McCarthy A.P. Edgar D.M. Tricklebank M.D. Wafford K.A. Jones M.W. Decoupling of sleep-dependent cortical and hippocampal interactions in a neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia.Neuron. 2012; 76: 526-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) (Figure 5A). A nesting of ripple activity into the troughs of the spindle cycle in particular for spindles recorded at PAR and CA1 (Figures S5C and S5D) was observed and was closely comparable among all stimulation conditions, as confirmed by more fine-grained time-event correlation histograms of discrete ripple events time-locked to the spindle troughs (Figure S5C; p < 0.001). Consistent with findings in humans and rodents (Clemens et al., 2011Clemens Z. Mölle M. Eross L. Jakus R. Rásonyi G. Halász P. Born J. Fine-tuned coupling between human parahippocampal ripples and sleep spindles.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2011; 33: 511-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, Phillips et al., 2012Phillips K.G.

Decoupling of sleep-dependent cortical and hippocampal interactions in a neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia.Neuron. 2012; 76: 526-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), grouping of ripples to spindle troughs was evident for parietal cortical and hippocampal spindles (Figure S5D) but was absent during frontal spindles. This result indicates that the spindle stimulation did not affect the naturally weak spindle-ripple nesting in FRO recordings and mostly preserved known nesting properties of CA1 ripples into PAR and CA1 spindles troughs. We found that optogenetic stimulation did not affect the ripple incidence rate under any condition (Figure 5B; one-way ANOVA, F3,30 = 1.258, p = 0.306). However, an analysis of the temporal overlap of spindle and ripple events revealed that the proportion of hippocampal ripples co-occurring with spindle events during optogenetic stimulation was increased in the in-phase stimulation condition (one-way ANOVA, F3,30 = 14.679, p < 0.001) compared with the no-stimulation condition (Figure 5C; NoSTIM-IN versus IN: p = 0.001 and NoSTIM-OUT versus OUT: p = 0.162, Fisher’s LSD). Notably, 20% of induced spindles were accompanied by a ripple, with no significant difference among conditions (one-way ANOVA, F3,30 = 1.277, p = 0.3). Importantly, the percentage of online-detected slow oscillations co-occurring with a spindle (within 750 ms after detection) that also exhibited at least one ripple co-occurring within a spindle was significantly increased in the in-phase group compared to the no-stimulation and out-of-phase groups (Figure 5D; Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA, U2 = 9.974, p = 0.007; NoSTIM versus IN: p = 0.024, NoSTIM versus OUT: p = 0.372, and IN versus OUT: p = 0.002, Fisher’s LSD). Since sleep spindles are known to be spatially distributed oscillations, we further examined the cross regional occurrence of spindles during stimulation. In-phase stimulation was accompanied by a significant increase in the rate of co-occurring (i.e., temporally overlapping) spindle events between FRO and PAR recordings (F2,22 = 13.298, p < 0.001, one-way ANOVA), between FRO and CA1 recordings (F2,13.337 = 6.602, p = 0.010, Welch test), and between all three recording sites (FRO-PAR-CA1, U2 = 7.175, p = 0.028, Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA) compared to the out-of-phase and no-stimulation conditions (Figure S6). We further examined whether these coherent spindle events also included a hippocampal ripple. Consistent with the increase in (detected) slow oscillation, frontal spindle, and hippocampal ripple events during in-phase stimulation (reported above; Figure 5D), this analysis showed that in-phase stimulation, in comparison with the other two conditions, was specifically associated with an increased rate of coherent frontal-hippocampal spindle events, including a ripple (Figure 5E; U2 = 13.008, p = 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA; IN versus NoSTIM: p = 0.004, IN versus OUT: p = 0.001, and OUT versus NoSTIM: p = 0.605; rank-sum test). In sum, these results indicate that in-phase stimulation produces a unique temporal-spatial pattern of the three oscillatory phenomena of interest, characterized not only by an increased triple coupling of slow oscillation, spindle, and ripple events, but also by an increased co-occurrence of spindles in anterior and posterior cortical and hippocampal regions, where, in particular, spindles co-occurring in frontal cortex and hippocampus also entrain ripples. We finally tested whether optogenetic inhibition of TRN Prv neurons could affect memory formation. Prv-cre knockin mice were bilaterally injected in the TRN (Figure 6A) with pAAV-CBA-Flex-Arch-GFP (Figures 6B–6E). Mice were subjected to stimulation protocols corresponding to in-phase optogenetic inhibition (IN-ARCH; 500 ms yellow laser pulse following the detection of a slow oscillation up-state; n = 8), out-of-phase optogenetic inhibition (OUT-ARCH; 500 ms yellow laser pulse randomly given between 0.5 to 1.0 following the detection of a slow oscillation up-state; n = 7), or no-stimulation condition (NoSTIM; no laser stimulation given; n = 9). We found that in-phase optogenetic inhibition of Prv neurons resulted in a significantly lower contextual memory recall (Figure 6F; one-way ANOVA, F2,23 = 5.665, p = 0.011) compared to the no-stimulation group (IN-ARCH versus NoSTIM: p = 0.043, Fisher LSD) or OUT-ARCH group (IN-ARCH versus OUT-ARCH: p = 0.003, Fisher’s LSD). The out-of-phase TRN inhibition did not significantly affect memory (NoSTIM versus OUT-ARCH: p = 0.199, Fisher’s LSD). The tone recall was not significantly changed (one-way ANOVA, F2,23 = 3.304, p = 0.057). As expected, the spindle incidence rate was significantly reduced for the mice that received inhibitory TRN stimulation if compared to the respective no-stimulation control conditions (Figure 6G; F3,25 = 12.042, p = 0.001, one-way ANOVA, IN versus NoSTIM-IN: p = 0.035, and OUT versus NoSTIM-OUT: p = 0.015). In line with our findings from the main experiments demonstrating that a spindle-like stimulation of the TRN induced slow oscillations, the inhibitory manipulation significantly reduced the incidence of slow oscillations during the 750 ms post-stimulus window for the in-phase and out-of-phase stimulation conditions, in comparison with their respective control conditions (Figure 6H; F3,25 = 23.921, p < 0.001, one-way ANOVA, IN versus NoSTIM-IN: p = 0.002, OUT versus NoSTIM-OUT: p = 0.019). Inhibitory stimulation had no effect on incidence rates of hippocampal ripples (one-way ANOVA, F3,25 = 2.151, p = 0.121; data not shown).

In contrast to astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, which arise from multiple progenitor pools, microglia arise from yolk sac progenitors and are widely considered to be equivalent throughout the CNS. However, little is known about basic properties of deep brain microglia, such as those within the basal ganglia (BG). Here, we show that microglial anatomical features, lysosome content, membrane properties, and transcriptomes differ significantly across BG nuclei. Region-specific phenotypes of BG microglia emerged during the second postnatal week and were re-established following genetic or pharmacological microglial ablation and repopulation in the adult, indicating that local cues play an ongoing role in shaping microglial diversity. These findings demonstrate that microglia in the healthy brain exhibit a spectrum of distinct functional states and provide a critical foundation for defining microglial contributions to BG circuit function."

Here, we explored inter-relationships between putative mouse ISC populations by comparative RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). The transcriptomes of multiple cycling ISC populations closely resembled Lgr5+ ISCs, the most well-defined ISC pool, but Bmi1-GFP+ cells were distinct and enriched for enteroendocrine (EE) markers, including Prox1. Prox1-GFP+ cells exhibited sustained clonogenic growth in vitro, and lineage-tracing of Prox1+ cells revealed long-lived clones during homeostasis and after radiation-induced injury in vivo. Single-cell mRNA-seq revealed two subsets of Prox1-GFP+ cells, one of which resembled mature EE cells while the other displayed low-level EE gene expression but co-expressed tuft cell markers, Lgr5 and Ascl2, reminiscent of label-retaining secretory progenitors. Our data suggest that the EE lineage, including mature EE cells, comprises a reservoir of homeostatic and injury-inducible ISCs, extending our understanding of cellular plasticity and stemness."

Here we show that programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), a well-known immune checkpoint of T cells, is highly expressed on peripheral and tumor-infiltrating NK cells from patients with digestive cancers including esophageal, liver, colorectal, gastric and biliary cancer. The increased PD-1 expression on NK cells indicates poorer survival in esophageal and liver cancers. Blocking PD-1/PD-L1 signaling markedly enhances cytokines production and degranulation and suppresses apoptosis of NK cells in vitro. PD-1/PD-L1 exerts inhibitory effect through repressing the activation of PI3K/AKT signaling in NK cells. More importantly, a PD-1 blocking antibody was found to significantly suppress the growth of xenografts in nude mice, and this inhibition of tumor growth was completely abrogated by NK depletion. These findings strongly suggested that PD-1 is an inhibitory regulator of NK cells in digestive cancers. PD-1 blockade might be an efficient strategy in NK cell-based tumor immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2724120353,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) patients display a common but often variable set of symptoms making successful, sustained treatment difficult to achieve. Separate depressive symptoms may be encoded by differential changes in distinct circuits in the brain, yet how discrete circuits underlie behavioral subsets of depression and how they adapt in response to stress has not been addressed. We identify two discrete circuits of parvalbumin-positive (PV) neurons in the ventral pallidum (VP) projecting to either the lateral habenula or ventral tegmental area contributing to depression. We find that these populations undergo different electrophysiological adaptations in response to social defeat stress, which are normalized by antidepressant treatment. Furthermore, manipulation of each population mediates either social withdrawal or behavioral despair, but not both. We propose that distinct components of the VP PV circuit can subserve related, yet separate depressive-like phenotypes in mice, which could ultimately provide a platform for symptom-specific treatments of depression."

In sensory cortical areas, neurons sharply tuned to particular features of sensory stimuli underlie precise representations of the external world. For example, pyramidal cells in visual cortex respond selectively to visual stimuli with a certain orientation or size, those in rodent somatosensory cortex prefer particular directions of whisker deflection, and neurons in auditory cortex fire selectively to certain sound frequencies. Revealing the factors governing cortical tuning properties is fundamental for understanding how sensory information is encoded in the brain. The excitatory synaptic input driving tuned pyramidal cell activity comes from two main sources: afferent thalamic inputs and recurrent synapses between pyramidal cells themselves that amplify thalamic input (Li et al., 2013Li L.Y.

While excitation broadly defines the tuning of pyramidal cell spike output, stimulus selectivity can be further refined by inhibitory synaptic input (Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011Isaacson J.S.

Cortical inhibition is mediated by a variety of local GABAergic interneurons that are highly interconnected with pyramidal cells as well as each other (Pfeffer et al., 2013Pfeffer C.K. Xue M. He M.

However, the precise synaptic mechanisms by which interconnected excitatory and inhibitory circuits generate pyramidal cell tuning properties are not established. Lateral inhibition, first described in photoreceptors (Hartline et al., 1956Hartline H.K. Wagner H.G. Ratliff F. Inhibition in the eye of Limulus.J. Gen. Physiol. 1956; 39: 651-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), is a basic circuit operation that can sharpen cortical tuning properties (Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011Isaacson J.S.

Inhibition, spike threshold, and stimulus selectivity in primary visual cortex.Neuron. 2008; 57: 482-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In this operation, pyramidal cells firing in response to stimuli in their receptive fields recruit local interneurons, which in turn suppress firing of other neurons with different receptive fields. In a classical model, lateral inhibition narrows tuning of individual neurons when non-preferred stimuli recruit inhibitory synaptic input more strongly than excitation. In other words, lateral inhibition occurs when synaptic inhibition is more broadly tuned than excitation. Indeed, differences in the tuning broadness of excitation and inhibition have been proposed to enforce odor selectivity in olfactory cortex (Poo and Isaacson, 2009Poo C. Isaacson J.S. Odor representations in olfactory cortex: “sparse” coding, global inhibition, and oscillations.Neuron. 2009; 62: 850-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) as well as selectivity for the size (Adesnik et al., 2012Adesnik H.

Interestingly, in primary auditory cortex the extent to which lateral inhibition contributes to frequency tuning as well as the synaptic mechanisms underlying suppressive effects of non-preferred stimuli are a matter of debate. For example, studies in primates, cats, and rodents using two-tone protocols have found that firing to preferred frequencies can be suppressed when preceded by tones that are octaves different (Calford and Semple, 1995Calford M.B.

Although two-tone suppression is typically attributed to GABAergic inhibition produced by the first sound, synaptic depression of excitatory input has also been shown to contribute to suppressed activity in this paradigm (Wehr and Zador, 2005Wehr M. Zador A.M. Synaptic mechanisms of forward suppression in rat auditory cortex.Neuron. 2005; 47: 437-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). More typical of classic lateral inhibition, single tones at non-preferred frequencies have also been found to cause suppression of spontaneous neuronal firing in awake primates (O’Connell et al., 2011O’Connell M.N.

However, these reports of response suppression are difficult to reconcile with intracellular recordings of sound-evoked synaptic responses in rodent auditory cortex. For instance, studies have found completely balanced excitation and inhibition in layer 2/3 (L2/3) and layer 4 (Wehr and Zador, 2003Wehr M. Zador A.M. Balanced inhibition underlies tuning and sharpens spike timing in auditory cortex.Nature. 2003; 426: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2003Zhang L.I. Tan A.Y.

Zhang L.I. A feedforward inhibitory circuit mediates lateral refinement of sensory representation in upper layer 2/3 of mouse primary auditory cortex.J.

Lateral sharpening of cortical frequency tuning by approximately balanced inhibition.Neuron. 2008; 58: 132-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In this “co-tuning” scenario, inhibition would contribute to frequency tuning by ensuring that only the strongest excitatory input depolarizes cells to spike threshold, a mechanism known as the “iceberg effect” (Carandini and Ferster, 2000Carandini M. Ferster D. Membrane potential and firing rate in cat primary visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 470-484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since this effect regulates tuning only in a rather narrow range around the preferred frequency, the synaptic mechanisms underlying broad side-band suppression remain unknown. Here, we use in vivo two-photon calcium imaging and whole-cell recordings to show pronounced lateral inhibition in primary auditory cortex (A1) of awake mice. In individual neurons, firing could be suppressed by tones octaves away from their preferred frequencies, arguing against a simple “iceberg” model of lateral inhibition. Indeed, we find that lateral inhibition shapes frequency tuning via an unconventional mechanism: non-preferred sounds do not increase inhibitory inputs onto individual neurons, but rather suppress both excitatory and inhibitory inputs (network suppression). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the inactivation of SOM interneurons, but not PV interneurons, blocks the network suppression evoked by non-preferred sounds. Taken together, our findings are most consistent with the idea that lateral inhibition is mediated by SOM cells, which regulate cortical tuning via the indirect regulation of ongoing recurrent excitation in the cortical network. We first investigated lateral inhibition in A1 by testing the frequency tuning properties of a large population of L2/3 pyramidal cells using two-photon calcium imaging in awake head-fixed mice (Figure 1A). To isolate action potential-dependent responses of excitatory pyramidal cells, the Ca2+ indicator GCaMP6s was expressed in mice in which GABAergic inhibitory neurons were marked with tdTomato (Gad2-IRES-Cre × ROSA-LSL-tdTomato mice). Tonal receptive fields (TRFs) of individual L2/3 pyramidal cells were measured by presenting pure tones (1 s) across a range of frequencies (2–40 kHz) and intensities (30–70 dB). On average, 41.7% ± 8.1% of GCaMP6s-expressing pyramidal cells (n = 1,681 cells, 8 mice) increased their activity (measured as dF/F) in response to at least one frequency, and many of those cells (41.3%) displayed classical “V-shaped” TRFs (Figure 1B, top; Figure S1). A similar fraction of pyramidal cells (32.3% ± 7.2%) decreased their activity in response to at least one frequency, as previously reported in awake mice (Kato et al., 2015Kato H.K. Gillet S.N. Isaacson J.S. Flexible sensory representations in auditory cortex driven by behavioral relevance.Neuron. 2015; 88: 1027-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Importantly, lateral inhibition was clearly present, since pyramidal cells could have both excitatory and suppressive responses to non-overlapping frequencies (Figure 1B, bottom). We determined average TRFs across all excited cells (n = 749) by centering tuning curves to their best frequencies (BF, frequency eliciting the strongest response regardless of intensity) for excitation. Interestingly, the population TRFs revealed prominent suppressive responses evoked by frequencies one to four octaves higher than the BF for excitation (Figure 1C). Though weaker in relative magnitude, suppressive responses were also apparent at frequencies one to four octaves lower than excitatory BF. The wide separation between excitatory and suppressive TRFs (Figures 1C and S1) we observe cannot arise from approximately balanced synaptic excitation and inhibition. Rather, our results indicate that lateral inhibition biased toward frequencies higher than those driving excitation shapes frequency tuning in A1 of awake mice. To investigate how lateral inhibition could be biased toward the higher-frequency side of excitatory TRFs, we examined the spatial distribution of tuned excitatory or suppressive responses along the A1 tonotopic axis. Tonotopy was mapped with intrinsic signal imaging using pure tones of three frequencies (3, 10, and 30 kHz), and two-photon imaging fields of view were registered to the intrinsic signal using the surface vasculature (Figure 1D). We determined the spatial organization for excitatory and suppressive tuning at the cellular level using activity maps representing the characteristic frequencies (CF, frequency with strongest response at lowest effective sound intensity) of responsive cells. As reported previously (Issa et al., 2014Issa J.B. Haeffele B.D. Agarwal A. Bergles D.E. Young E.D. Yue D.T. Multiscale optical Ca2+ imaging of tonal organization in mouse auditory cortex.Neuron. 2014; 83: 944-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, Kato et al., 2015Kato H.K. Gillet S.N. Isaacson J.S. Flexible sensory representations in auditory cortex driven by behavioral relevance.Neuron. 2015; 88: 1027-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we observed a cellular-level tonotopic organization of excitatory CFs that coarsely adhered to the tonotopic axis identified by macroscopic imaging (Figure 1D). In contrast, CFs for suppression lacked clear tonotopic organization and showed a relatively uniform distribution throughout the tonotopic axis. We quantified the tonotopic distribution of cells across mice by plotting the CFs of all responsive neurons against their positions along the normalized A1 tonotopic axis (3–30 kHz, Figure 1E; n = 8 mice, 443 cells with excitatory responses, 405 cells with suppressive responses). As expected, excitatory CFs increased monotonically from the low to high end of the tonotopic axis. In contrast, suppressive CFs were only weakly correlated with location along the tonotopic axis, and higher frequencies were overrepresented all across A1. Thus, the differential tuning of excitation and suppression along the tonotopic axis results in a bias for lateral inhibition toward the higher-frequency side of excitatory TRFs. Furthermore, the differential tuning of excitatory and inhibitory TRFs in individual neurons is in apparent contradiction with the idea of co-tuned synaptic excitation and inhibition in A1. What mechanisms underlie lateral inhibition in A1 under our conditions? To address this question we used blind patch clamp recording to study sound-evoked responses of L2/3 cells in awake mice. In current clamp recordings (resting potential −62 ± 2 mV, n = 12), cells had regular action potential firing with spike widths typical of pyramidal cells (Figure 2A; 1.22 ± 0.07 ms, n = 8 cells). In addition, spikes recorded in cell-attached mode for 30/31 blind whole-cell recordings in this study had waveforms distinct from fast-spiking (FS) interneurons (Figure S2). Given that pyramidal cells make up the bulk of non-FS cells in L2/3, we refer to the recorded neurons in this study as “pyramidal cells.” Tones (100–200 ms duration) evoked membrane depolarization at particular (preferred) frequencies and this excitation became progressively briefer before switching to pure hyperpolarizing responses as frequencies shifted away from the preferred stimulus (Figures 2A and 2B; peak hyperpolarization 8.8 ± 0.9 mV, n = 10 cells). Consistent with our imaging results, suppressive responses to non-preferred tones abolished action potentials when membrane potential was moved above spike threshold with depolarizing current injection (Figure 2B; 95% ± 3% suppression, n = 6 cells, p = 2 × 10−3). Intriguingly, we found that cell input resistance increased significantly (p = 0.03) during the hyperpolarization evoked by non-preferred frequencies (Figure 2C). This is puzzling since synaptic inhibition classically requires activation of a GABAergic synaptic conductance that lowers membrane resistance (Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011Isaacson J.S. Scanziani M. How inhibition shapes cortical activity.Neuron. 2011; 72: 231-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). Indeed, this finding indicates that an unconventional synaptic mechanism underlies lateral inhibition in auditory cortex. We next used voltage-clamp recording to directly determine the postsynaptic currents that shape frequency tuning in A1. Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) were recorded near the reversal potentials for synaptic inhibition and excitation, respectively (Figure S3). Recordings in awake mice revealed sustained, high-frequency barrages of spontaneous EPSCs and IPSCs, indicating that cortical circuits were highly active even in the absence of delivered tones (Figure 3A). In contrast, we observed relatively low basal activity interrupted by irregular bursts of synaptic activity if the pipette internal solution included the voltage-gated sodium channel blocker QX-314 (5 mM, Figure S4) or if the cortex was damaged due to poor surgical exposure of the brain surface or excessive pipette penetrations (STAR Methods). Remarkably, under our conditions of high cortical activity, presentation of non-preferred tones suppressed both spontaneous EPSCs and IPSCs (Figures 3A and 3B; reduction in variance, EPSC, 26.5% ± 3.8%; IPSC, 35.5% ± 5.8%). This suppression of ongoing network activity (“network suppression”) by non-preferred stimuli is completely different from the selective increase in IPSCs expected for classical lateral inhibition. Rather, these results indicate that the membrane hyperpolarization underlying lateral inhibition in A1 is due to the withdrawal of excitatory synaptic input, which is likely driven indirectly by local interneurons. Our results raise the possibility that preferred and non-preferred stimuli trigger distinct inhibitory circuit operations. We tested this by measuring the frequency tuning of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents. Indeed, averaged responses (five to ten trials per frequency-intensity pair, 100 ms tone duration) from individual neurons displayed two types of synaptic activity that differed in their kinetics and tuning (Figures 4A, 4B, and S5). We observed transient, sound onset-locked EPSCs (EPSCON) and IPSCs (IPSCON) with overlapping TRFs similar to previous reports in A1 (Li et al., 2014Li L.Y. Ji X.Y. Liang F. Li Y.T. Xiao Z. Tao H.W.

Neurosci. 2014; 17: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, higher-frequency tones evoked a slow suppression of spontaneous EPSCs and IPSCs, which on average traces appear as slow currents opposite in polarity to onset-locked responses. Interestingly, while sustained suppression of synaptic activity was also observed with longer duration (1 s) tones, brief 15 ms tone “pips” evoked predominantly transient, sound onset-locked responses (Figure S5). The slow components do not reflect voltage-clamp errors that reverse IPSCON and EPSCON since the kinetics and tuning of the fast and slow currents are distinct, nor do the slow components require activation of presynaptic GABAB receptors (Urban-Ciecko et al., 2015Urban-Ciecko J. Fanselow E.E. Barth A.L. Neocortical somatostatin neurons reversibly silence excitatory transmission via GABAb receptors.Curr. Biol. 2015; 25: 722-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) (Figure S6). They also do not reflect shunting inhibition, since non-preferred stimuli increase input resistance (Figure 2C). Rather, we consider these slow components, EPSCNS and IPSCNS, to be due to the withdrawal of spontaneous synaptic activity during network suppression. The TRFs of EPSCON and IPSCON largely overlap (Figures 4C and 4D), with IPSCON more broadly tuned, consistent with previous findings in L2/3 (Li et al., 2014Li L.Y. Ji X.Y. Liang F. Li Y.T. Xiao Z. Tao H.W. Zhang L.I. A feedforward inhibitory circuit mediates lateral refinement of sensory representation in upper layer 2/3 of mouse primary auditory cortex.J.

Scaling down of balanced excitation and inhibition by active behavioral states in auditory cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, the difference in tuning broadness (half-maximal bandwidth) is only 0.4 octaves and cannot account for the suppression of spike output one to four octaves from best frequency (Figure 1C). Thus, a conventional model for lateral inhibition solely based on broadly tuned inhibitory synaptic input does not apply to frequency tuning in A1 of awake mice. In contrast, the tuning of EPSCNS and IPSCNS is shifted far from EPSCON best frequency (distance to peak EPSCNS and IPSCNS: 1.4 ± 0.2 octaves and 1.6 ± 0.1 octaves, respectively) and covers the range of frequencies for lateral inhibition observed with GCaMP6s imaging. Taken together, these results suggest that the frequency tuning properties of L2/3 cells are regulated by inhibitory neurons acting via both direct synaptic inputs (preferred tones) and indirect decreases in network activity (non-preferred tones). What cortical regime can produce lateral inhibition via a decrease in excitatory synaptic input? We considered the idea that the cortex might operate as an inhibition-stabilized network (ISN), a proposed model in which recurrent excitation is strong enough to destabilize the cortical network unless it is tightly regulated by recurrent inhibition (Litwin-Kumar et al., 2016Litwin-Kumar A.

In ISNs, lateral input onto inhibitory interneurons transiently increases inhibition and suppresses excitatory neurons. However, since strong recurrent excitation tightly regulates interneuron firing, a new steady state is reached in which both excitatory and inhibitory neuron activities are reduced.

https://openalex.org/W2730189927,"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is a key enzyme that generates NADPH to maintain reduced glutathione (GSH), which scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) to protect cancer cell from oxidative damage. In this study, we mainly investigate the potential roles of G6PD in colorectal cancer (CRC) development and chemoresistance. We discover that G6PD is overexpressed in CRC cells and patient specimens. High expression of G6PD predicts poor prognosis and correlated with poor outcome of oxaliplatin-based first-line chemotherapy in patients with CRC. Suppressing G6PD decreases NADPH production, lowers GSH levels, impairs the ability to scavenge ROS levels, and enhances oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis in CRC via ROS-mediated damage in vitro. In vivo experiments further shows that silencing G6PD with lentivirus or non-viral gene delivery vector enhances oxaliplatin anti-tumor effects in cell based xenografts and PDX models. In summary, our finding indicated that disrupting G6PD-mediated NADPH homeostasis enhances oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis in CRC through redox modulation. Thus, this study indicates that G6PD is a potential prognostic biomarker and a promising target for CRC therapy."

Yet, our ability to target specific networks for functional or genetic manipulations remains limited. Monosynaptically restricted rabies virus facilitates the anatomical investigation of neural circuits. However, the inherent cytotoxicity of the rabies largely prevents its implementation in long-term functional studies and the genetic manipulation of neural networks. To overcome this limitation, we developed a self-inactivating ΔG-rabies virus (SiR) that transcriptionally disappears from the infected neurons while leaving permanent genetic access to the traced network. SiR provides a virtually unlimited temporal window for the study of network dynamics and for the genetic and functional manipulation of neural circuits in vivo without adverse effects on neuronal physiology and circuit function."

However, the molecular basis of CAIX-mediated tumor progression remains unclear. Here, we have utilized proximity dependent biotinylation (BioID) to map the CAIX 'interactome' in breast cancer cells in order to identify physiologically relevant CAIX-associating proteins with potential roles in tumor progression. High confidence proteins identified include metabolic transporters, β1 integrins, integrin-associated protein CD98hc and matrix metalloprotease 14 (MMP14). Biochemical studies validate the association of CAIX with α2β1 integrin, CD98hc and MMP14, and immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrates colocalization of CAIX with α2β1 integrin and MMP14 in F-actin/cofilin-positive lamellipodia/pseudopodia, and with MMP14 to cortactin/Tks5-positive invadopodia. Modulation of CAIX expression and activity results in significant changes in cell migration, collagen degradation and invasion. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that CAIX associates with MMP14 through potential phosphorylation residues within its intracellular domain, and that CAIX enhances MMP14-mediated collagen degradation by directly contributing hydrogen ions required for MMP14 catalytic activity. These findings establish hypoxia-induced CAIX as a novel metabolic component of cellular migration and invasion structures, and provide new mechanistic insights into its role in tumor cell biology."
https://openalex.org/W2729406224,"The function of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) remains controversial, yet many theories suggest a role in behavioral adaptation, partly because a robust event-related potential, the feedback-related negativity (FN), is evoked over the ACC whenever expectations are violated. We recorded from the ACC as rats performed a task identical to one that reliably evokes an FN in humans. A subset of neurons was found that encoded expected outcomes as abstract outcome representations. The degree to which a reward/non-reward outcome representation emerged during a trial depended on the history of outcomes that preceded it. A prediction error was generated on incongruent trials as the ensembles shifted from representing the expected to the actual outcome, at the same time point we have previously reported an FN in the local field potential. The results describe a novel mode of prediction error signaling by ACC neurons that is associated with the generation of an FN."
https://openalex.org/W2953071419,"Perceptual decisions require the transformation of raw sensory inputs into cortical representations suitable for stimulus discrimination. One of the best-known examples of this transformation involves the middle temporal area (MT) of the primate visual cortex. Area MT provides a robust representation of stimulus motion, and previous work has shown that it contributes causally to performance on motion discrimination tasks. Here we report that the strength of this contribution can be highly plastic: depending on the recent training history, pharmacological inactivation of MT can severely impair motion discrimination, or it can have little detectable influence. Further analysis of neural and behavioral data suggests that training moves the readout of motion information between MT and lower-level cortical areas. These results show that the contribution of individual brain regions to conscious perception can shift flexibly depending on sensory experience."

This study investigates the effect of EMPs on endothelial cell function and dysfunction in a model of free fatty acid (FFA) palmitate-induced oxidative stress. EMPs were generated from TNF-α-stimulated HUVECs and quantified by using flow cytometry. HUVECs were treated with and without palmitate in the presence or absence of EMPs. EMPs were found to carry functional eNOS and to protect against oxidative stress by positively regulating eNOS/Akt signaling, which restored NO production, increased superoxide dismutase and catalase, and suppressed NADPH oxidase and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, with the involvement of NF-erythroid 2-related factor 2 and heme oxygenase-1. Conversely, under normal conditions, EMPs reduced NO release and increased ROS and redox-sensitive marker expression. In addition, functional assays using EMP-treated mouse aortic rings that were performed under homeostatic conditions demonstrated a decline in endothelium-dependent vasodilatation, but restored the functional response under lipid-induced oxidative stress. These data indicate that EMPs harbor functional eNOS and potentially play a role in the feedback loop of damage and repair during homeostasis, but are also effective in protecting against FFA-induced oxidative stress; thus, EMP function is reflected by the microenvironment.— Mahmoud, A.

https://openalex.org/W2735952693,"Homeodomain interacting protein kinase-2 (HIPK2) is a member of the HIPK family of stress-responsive kinases that modulates cell growth, apoptosis, proliferation and development. HIPK2 has several well-characterised tumour suppressor roles, but recent studies suggest it can also contribute to tumour progression, although the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Herein, we have identified novel crosstalk between HIPK2 and the cytoprotective transcription factor NRF2. We show that HIPK2 is a direct transcriptional target of NRF2, identifying a functional NRF2 binding site in the HIPK2 gene locus and demonstrating for the first time a transcriptional mode of regulation for this kinase. In addition, HIPK2 is required for robust NRF2 responsiveness in cells and in vivo. By using both gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches, we demonstrate that HIPK2 can elicit a cytoprotective response in cancer cells via NRF2. Our results have uncovered a new downstream effector of HIPK2, NRF2, which is frequently activated in human tumours correlating with chemoresistance and poor prognosis. Furthermore, our results suggest that modulation of either HIPK2 levels or activity could be exploited to impair NRF2-mediated signalling in cancer cells, and thus sensitise them to chemotherapeutic drugs."

In vivo stem cell dynamics are best understood in adult tissues undergoing homeostasis or repair. While the presence of self-renewing and transient amplifying stem cell niches have been identified within many adult organ systems, how these populations are coordinated during cellular turnover remained largely unknown until recent advances in retrospective lineage-tracing techniques. These analyses have demonstrated that the stem cell compartments of a handful of adult tissues behave in a neutral competitive manner to drive tissue replacement by a process coined “clonal drift” (Gupta and Poss, 2012Gupta V.

This process, first described in the intestinal stem cell niche, is characterized by the stochastic loss and reciprocal expansion of the progeny of individual stem cells. This ultimately leads to a pool of clonally related stem cells responsible for replenishing the entire stem cell population, which in turn generates clonally related differentiated tissues (Snippert et al., 2010Snippert H.J. van der Flier L.G. Sato T. van Es J.H. van den Born M. Kroon-Veenboer C. Barker N. Klein A.M. van Rheenen J. Simons B.D. Clevers H.

This intriguing phenomenon remains entirely unexplained at a mechanistic level. In contrast to the intense efforts undertaken in determining the nature of stem cell regulation in adult tissues, stem cell deployment during organ growth remains largely unexplored. This likely reflects the complexity of the milieu in which growth stem cells operate, being required to tightly regulate self-renewal in the face of the constant need for cellular differentiation within a growing organ. Recent genomic lineage-tracing approaches have demonstrated that relatively few lineages contribute to the formation of most adult organs in zebrafish (McKenna et al., 2016McKenna A. Findlay G.M. Gagnon J.A. Horwitz M.S. Schier A.F. Shendure J. Whole-organism lineage tracing by combinatorial and cumulative genome editing.Science. 2016; 353: aaf7907Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). These results imply that clonally related stem and progenitor populations have the potential to drive cellular dynamics in growing tissues as they do during tissue homeostasis. How this clonal identity is initiated and regulated mechanistically during organ growth remains undefined. In this study, we have sought to understand how growth-specific stem cells are deployed to generate growth using the paradigm of the zebrafish myotome. We define a long-lived source of stem cells specifically required for muscle growth. These cells undergo clonal drift, resulting in a limited number of stem cells generating the majority of adult muscle fibers. The homeobox protein Meox1 controls this clonal drift by directly inhibiting the cell cycle checkpoint gene ccnb1. This inhibition halts growth-specific stem cells in the G2 phase, thereby controlling the balance between stem cell differentiation and self-renewal. Collectively, these findings define how clonal tissue growth occurs to produce an adult organ, and they provide a mechanistic understanding of the processes that drive clonal drift in vivo. The embryonic myotome expands 5-fold in fiber number to generate the entire musculature of the body axis, which constitutes 60% of the total body weight in adult fish through an unknown mechanism (Johnston et al., 2011Johnston I.A. Bower N.I. Macqueen D.J. Growth and the regulation of myotomal muscle mass in teleost fish.J. Exp. Biol. 2011; 214: 1617-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, Rowlerson and Veggetti, 2001Rowlerson A. Veggetti A. Cellular mechanisms of post-embryonic muscle growth in aquaculture species.in: Fish Physiology. Academic Press, 2001: 103-140Crossref Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In amniotes, two distinct mechanisms control muscle growth: hyperplasia (the addition of new fibers) and hypertrophy (the increase in existing fiber size). We determined which of these muscle growth mechanism(s) were utilized in zebrafish by developing a muscle-specific fluorophore maturation assay, where we used two fluorophores with different maturation rates to identify fiber ages, and we combined this assay with morphometric measurements of individual fibers (Figure 1A; see also the STAR Methods). This analysis revealed that new fiber addition occurred mainly at the lateral edges of the myotome in stratified hyperplastic growth zones (Johnston et al., 2011Johnston I.A. Bower N.I. Macqueen D.J. Growth and the regulation of myotomal muscle mass in teleost fish.J. Exp. Biol. 2011; 214: 1617-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), while older fibers were primarily located deeper in the myotome (Figures 1B–1E and S1A–S1C). Counting of new fibers (Figures 1F, S1D, and S1E) and measurements of fiber number, fiber cross-sectional area, fiber length, and nuclei number throughout development indicate that hyperplasia and hypertrophy occur simultaneously through to adulthood, but they predominate in distinct temporal phases (Figures 1G and S1G–S1L’’’). Intriguingly, cross-sectional area (CSA) and length increase within newly formed fibers that arise later in development, without the proportional increase in nuclear accretion that is evident in older fibers at all stages of development (Figure S1H). These observations suggest that distinct mechanisms may drive the hypertrophic response at different stages of development. Our analyses also showed that cross-sectional area directly correlated with fiber age, with small diameter fibers being the most newly formed and larger diameter fibers representing older fibers (Figure S1G). Furthermore, the expression of transgenic lines marking muscle stem and progenitor cells (Seger et al., 2011Seger C. Hargrave M. Wang X. Chai R.J. Elworthy S. Ingham P.W. Analysis of Pax7 expressing myogenic cells in zebrafish muscle development, injury, and models of disease.Dev. Dyn. 2011; 240: 2440-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and myocytes committed to muscle differentiation (Gurevich et al., 2016Gurevich D.B. Nguyen P.D. Siegel A.L. Ehrlich O.V. Sonntag C. Phan J.M. Berger S. Ratnayake D. Hersey L. Berger J. et al.Asymmetric division of clonal muscle stem cells coordinates muscle regeneration in vivo.Science. 2016; 353: aad9969Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) correlated precisely with the hyperplastic growth zones (Figures 1H and 1I′). These results suggest the existence of a permanent muscle stem cell population, situated on the lateral surface of the myotome, which generates hyperplastic growth. The origin and mechanism of stem cell deployment utilized for growth was next examined by developing a muscle-specific lineage-tracing strategy using the zebrabow system, which we termed “musclebow” (Gurevich et al., 2016Gurevich D.B. Nguyen P.D. Siegel A.L. Ehrlich O.V. Sonntag C. Phan J.M. Berger S. Ratnayake D. Hersey L. Berger J. et al.Asymmetric division of clonal muscle stem cells coordinates muscle regeneration in vivo.Science. 2016; 353: aad9969Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) (Figures 2A and S2; STAR Methods; Movie S1). This system labels every somitic derivative, which includes muscle stem cells, in a unique recombinant color. We quantified the clonality of newly born, small diameter fibers using the mean distances between the spectral coordinates of differently colored clones on color wheel Cartesian plots (Figure S2A; refer to the STAR Methods). We determined that the fiber colors generated by musclebow recombination are random, with no evident color bias or labeling of independent clones with the same color (Figures 2 and S2F). We next examined if individually colored clones fragment over time, a process that could potentially distort our analyses. We measured the color profiles of every fiber in a continuous fashion from 2 days post-fertilization (dpf) to 6 dpf within individual larvae (n = 2,168 in five individual larvae), and we failed to detect fragmenting clones (Figure S2F). Migration of stem and progenitor cells could also distort clonal analyses. We therefore measured the position of newly formed fibers relative to the myotome edge from 2 to 6 dpf, a proxy for distance traveled by the stem/progenitor cells that made them. This analysis revealed little variation in the site of newly formed fibers, suggesting that individual clones with distinct migratory behaviors are not a feature of muscle growth in the zebrafish myotome (Figure S2G). We also examined if there was any wholesale rearrangements of differentiated myofiber positioning that would alter the interpretation of the musclebow system. As each fiber is marked in a unique color, we charted the position of existing fibers of the same fish over successive time points, which revealed that fibers maintained the same relative position and color throughout this time period (Figures S1M’–S1Q’), indicating that no wholesale repositioning of pre-existing fibers occurred during myotome maturation. Muscle cell fusion also has the potential to confound our analyses, as maturing muscle fibers become multi-nucleated, a process that could alter fiber color over time within the musclebow system. We limited this possibility by only measuring newly born fibers, which previously we have shown exhibit limited nuclear addition (Figure S1H). In line with this contention, no change in color was detected within individual fibers from 2 to 6 dpf in the analyses described above, suggesting fusion was unlikely to distort the spectral properties of fibers over time. To directly test the role of fusion in clonal distortion, we induced hyperfusion of individual muscle fibers by creating a construct that expressed a constitutively active (ca) form of Rac1 from the myoblast-specific myogenin promoter. caRac1 has been shown to induce increased levels of fusion in zebrafish larval muscle cells (Srinivas et al., 2007Srinivas B.P. Woo J. Leong W.Y. Roy S. A conserved molecular pathway mediates myoblast fusion in insects and vertebrates.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 781-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We found that increasing nuclei number in individual muscle fibers had no effect on color diversity of individual fibers, reinforcing that muscle fusion was not a confounding factor in our analyses (Figures S2H and S2I”; STAR Methods). Collectively, these analyses suggested that the musclebow system would provide a robust assay to describe the nature of clonal contributions during the growth of the zebrafish myotome. We therefore determined the clonality of muscle growth at specific time points throughout the lifespan of the fish. From embryonic until mid-larval stages, the recombinant colors of the newly generated (smallest) fibers were random (Figures 2B, 2C′, and S1M–S1Q), indicating this phase of muscle growth displayed stochastic stem cell activity. From late-larval stages until adulthood, newly differentiated fibers exhibited a drift toward a single color (clonality) such that, in adults, whole sectors of each myotome were uniform in color (Figures 2D–2F). These results demonstrate that, initially, multiple independent stem cells randomly contribute to fiber generation and, over successive self-renewal events, a single stem cell clone comes to dominate growth within individual myotomes. We next utilized mathematical modeling to test whether the observed clonal drift of muscle stem cells behaved in a neutrally competitive manner. For this model, we defined three distinct cellular behaviors as follows: clonal if all cells clustered within a mathematically defined region of the color spectra, stochastic if all cells were different from clonal, and oligoclonal if some, but not all, cells clustered within the clonal definition. The clonality of each segment was quantified using a modified mathematical simulation of the neutral drift model (Klein and Simons, 2011Klein A.M. Simons B.D. Universal patterns of stem cell fate in cycling adult tissues.Development. 2011; 138: 3103-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) to accommodate growth parameters (see also the STAR Methods). This analysis revealed our experimental values followed the simulated neutral drift model (Figure 2G), demonstrating that long-lived, clonally dominant stem cells are also featured during organ growth as well as during adult tissue homeostasis (Gupta and Poss, 2012Gupta V.

It is marked by the same transgenes expressed in the muscle stem/progenitor cells located at the stratified hyperplastic growth zones defined above. These observations indicate that the ECL represents a lifelong stem cell pool required for both larval and adult muscle growth. We therefore reasoned that understanding the nature of stem cell dynamics within the ECL during muscle growth would help resolve the mechanistic basis of myotomal clonal drift. To understand the process coordinating ECL-derived growth more fully, we undertook daily inspection of the ECL-marking transgenic line TgBAC(pax3a: GFP) (Seger et al., 2011Seger C. Hargrave M. Wang X. Chai R.J. Elworthy S. Ingham P.W. Analysis of Pax7 expressing myogenic cells in zebrafish muscle development, injury, and models of disease.Dev. Dyn. 2011; 240: 2440-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This analysis revealed that, when the ECL was first established (1 dpf), pax3a-positive cells were evenly distributed across the lateral myotomal surface as previously reported (Seger et al., 2011Seger C. Hargrave M. Wang X. Chai R.J. Elworthy S. Ingham P.W. Analysis of Pax7 expressing myogenic cells in zebrafish muscle development, injury, and models of disease.Dev. Dyn. 2011; 240: 2440-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). From 3 dpf onward, however, dramatic cell rearrangements resulted in the majority of ECL cells localizing to extracellular matrix-rich regions termed the horizontal myoseptum (HM) and vertical myoseptum (VM). Additionally, from 3 dpf onward, there was the emergence of a distinct cellular pool deeper within the myotome that occupied the intracellular spaces between muscle fibers (Figures 3A and 3Bii′C ; Movie S2). To understand how these distinct subsets of cells arose, we undertook continuous time-lapse imaging of the ECL. This revealed distinct proliferative modes during ECL maturation, and it defined the myoseptas as a potential self-renewing and transit-amplifying niche for growth. All proliferative events in the ECL were associated with the myosepta, with the vast majority of divisions associating with the VM compared to the HM (Figure 3C). These divisions were broadly classified into planar proliferations that expanded the myosepta-associated pool or asymmetric divisions that generated one daughter cell that remained at the VM and the other localized to the central ECL region (Figures S3A and S3B”; Movie S3). By 3 dpf, concurrent with the emergence of the myotomal population, additional proliferation modes associated with the deeper myotome cells were identified (Figures S3C, 3F, and 3G; Movie S3). Quantification of proliferative events revealed at 1 dpf that all ECL proliferation modes were represented until 3 dpf, when proliferation associated with the myotomal population predominated (Figures 3E and S3E). Furthermore, an analysis of migration revealed cells at the HM transiting to the VM, but never vice versa (Figure S3D; Movie S4). Additionally, the migration of cells into the myotome exclusively occurred at the VM (Figure S3D’; Movie S4). The association between proliferation frequencies and specific regions within the ECL suggested the existence of defined niches dedicated to stem cell maintenance and progenitor amplification. We therefore conducted label retention analyses of ECL cells, as this technique has commonly been used to identify quiescent and transit-amplifying stem cells in a number of organ systems (Buczacki et al., 2013Buczacki S.J. Zecchini H.I. Nicholson A.M. Russell R. Vermeulen L. Kemp R. Winton D.J.

Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) (see also the STAR Methods). This analysis demonstrated that all ECL cells initially exhibited similar levels of label retention. By 3 dpf, the highest label-retaining cells were largely located at the HM in contrast to the low label-retaining cells at the VM (Figure 3G; quantification in Figure 3F). These differences in proliferative activity were confirmed with EdU labeling (Figure S4). To define how these distinct zones of cell behaviors are established within the ECL, we systematically examined genes reported to be restricted to ECL cells. This analysis revealed the homeobox-containing gene meox1 progressively became restricted to cells at the HM. Meox1 is initially globally expressed in ECL precursors of the anterior somite and then within all cells of the newly formed ECL (Nguyen et al., 2014Nguyen P.D. Hollway G.E. Sonntag C. Miles L.B. Hall T.E. Berger S. Fernandez K.J. Gurevich D.B. Cole N.J. Alaei S. et al.Haematopoietic stem cell induction by somite-derived endothelial cells controlled by meox1.Nature. 2014; 512: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, by 2 dpf it is highly expressed within the nuclei of the low-cycling, label-retaining, pax3a-positive cells present at the HM (Figures 3H–3Ji and S3H). Collectively, these studies support a model where the HM possesses a reservoir of low-cycling, Meox1-expressing stem cells. These cells then generate a small number of progenitors that migrate to the VM and undergo transit amplification to generate myoblasts for muscle growth. We previously reported that meox1 mutants displayed reduced ECL cell numbers of ∼40% of wild-type (Nguyen et al., 2014Nguyen P.D. Hollway G.E. Sonntag C. Miles L.B. Hall T.E. Berger S. Fernandez K.J. Gurevich D.B. Cole N.J. Alaei S. et al.Haematopoietic stem cell induction by somite-derived endothelial cells controlled by meox1.Nature. 2014; 512: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Further analyses revealed that the ECL of meox1 mutants recovered to wild-type levels both in terms of cell number and density (Figure S5I). However, the ECL exhibited a progressive loss of cells associated with the HM and VM through to adulthood in meox1 mutants (Figures 4A–Di′ and S5G). Time-lapse analyses of the ECL within meox1 mutants revealed that, in conjunction with the lack of myosepta-associated cells, there emerged atypical proliferative modes associated with the edges of these myosepta exclusion zones, with the most prevalent of these being a loss of the orientation of divisions relative to the myosepta (Figures 4E, 4F, and S5A–S5F; Movie S5). A significant increase in the number of pax3a-GFP-positive ECL cells migrating into the myotome was also evident (Figure S5J). Upon delamination, ectopically migrating ECL cells initiated myogenin expression and underwent precocious differentiation, leading to a premature loss of ECL cells (Figures 4I, 4J″, and S6A–S6C’i). Furthermore, label retention analyses demonstrated a complete loss of the low-cycling population at the HM in meox1 mutants (Figures 4G and 4H″). To confirm that the loss of cells at the HM was due to ectopic differentiation of the stem compartment and not due to a lack of ECL formation at the myosepta developmentally, we compared the density of ECL cells present at the HM of meox1 mutants and wild-type sibling embryos at 1 dpf, the time at which the ECL is first formed. This analysis showed no significant difference in HM-associated cell number between mutant and wild-type siblings, indicating that the specification of HM-associated cells was not altered in meox1 mutants (Figure S5H). Collectively, these data suggest a requirement for meox1 in regulating ECL self-renewal, with a loss of Meox1 activity resulting in the expansion of differentiation-competent progenitors at the expense of the self-renewing stem cell pool. We next examined whether the abnormal ECL dynamics evident during larval stages were responsible for the severe muscle growth defects reported in homozygous meox1-deficient fish (Nguyen et al., 2014Nguyen P.D. Hollway G.E. Sonntag C. Miles L.B. Hall T.E. Berger S. Fernandez K.J. Gurevich D.B. Cole N.J. Alaei S. et al.Haematopoietic stem cell induction by somite-derived endothelial cells controlled by meox1.Nature. 2014; 512: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Musclebow analyses revealed no difference in the initial stochastic phase of embryonic and larval growth (Figures 5A, 5B′i , S6D, and S6E””). By contrast, meox1 mutants failed to exhibit clonal dominance, contrasting strikingly with wild-type siblings during the juvenile to adult stages. These mutants instead maintained a stochastic stem cell profile resulting in multi-colored fibers within the adult myotome (Figures 5C–5E). As different cell dynamics between mutant and wild-type may influence clonal drift, we examined the initial location of fiber generation relative to the ECL. This analysis found no significant difference between mutant and wild-type siblings (Figure S2G), suggesting that differential migration did not underlie the difference in stem cell behaviors. In addition, modeling of mutant fiber color profiles revealed that neutral drift was no longer occurring (Figure 5F). In fact, the simulation indicated that, in order for the mutant stem cell pool to behave in a neutrally drifting manner, its stem cell replenishment rate must be one-ninth slower compared to wild-type (Figure S6F). This reduced stem cell replenishment rate was approximated by the experimentally determined level of ectopic differentiation evident in meox1 mutants (Figure S6F’; see also the STAR Methods). Along with growth, muscle regeneration after injury also requires a stem cell source that generates repair in a highly clonal manner (Gurevich et al., 2016Gurevich D.B. Nguyen P.D. Siegel A.L. Ehrlich O.V. Sonntag C. Phan J.M. Berger S. Ratnayake D. Hersey L. Berger J. et al.Asymmetric division of clonal muscle stem cells coordinates muscle regeneration in vivo.Science. 2016; 353: aad9969Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We have previously defined the cellular source for the regeneration-specific stem cell pool in zebrafish, which we show is analogous to the mammalian satellite cell (Gurevich et al., 2016Gurevich D.B. Nguyen P.D. Siegel A.L. Ehrlich O.V. Sonntag C. Phan J.M. Berger S. Ratnayake D. Hersey L. Berger J. et al.Asymmetric division of clonal muscle stem cells coordinates muscle regeneration in vivo.Science. 2016; 353: aad9969Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These cells are distinct in function and location to those that are required for growth, and they are likely activated and specified by distinct mechanisms. However, the highly clonal nature of the regeneration process we have previously described led us to examine the role of meox1 in this process. Surprisingly, examination of meox1 mutants following needle stab injury revealed a loss in clonality of regenerated fibers (Figures S6G–S6I; Movie S6), as well as a delay in regeneration (Figures S6J–S6L) when compared to wild-type siblings. Collectively, these results suggest that the abnormal ECL behaviors observed in meox1 mutants may result in a failure to produce a stable, clonally dominant stem cell pool, a defect that could affect muscle growth dynamics and regeneration. We next sought to determine the mechanism by which meox1 regulated stem cell self-renewal during growth. The G0 phase is considered as a reversible transition phase within the G1 phase of the cell cycle. It is commonly associated with quiescence, and its regulation has been intensively studied in a number of different stem cell systems (Chakkalakal et al., 2012Chakkalakal J.V. Jones K.M.

https://openalex.org/W2728480371,"The RNA chaperone Hfq regulates virulence and metabolism in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. During carbon catabolite repression (CCR) Hfq together with the catabolite repression control protein Crc can act as a translational repressor of catabolic genes. Upon relief of CCR, the level of the Hfq-titrating RNA CrcZ is increasing, which in turn abrogates Hfq-mediated translational repression. As the interdependence of Hfq-mediated and RNA based control mechanisms is poorly understood, we explored the possibility whether the regulatory RNA CrcZ can interfere with riboregulation. We first substantiate that the P. aeruginosa Hfq is proficient and required for riboregulation of the transcriptional activator gene antR by the small RNA PrrF1-2. Our studies further revealed that CrcZ can interfere with PrrF1-2/Hfq-mediated regulation of antR. The competition for Hfq can be rationalized by the higher affinity of Hfq for CrcZ than for antR mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2735343979,"Programmed cell death 4 (Pdcd4), a tumor invasion suppressor, is frequently downregulated in colorectal cancer and other cancers. In this study, we find that loss of Pdcd4 increases the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) and thereby upregulates Snail expression. Examining the components of mTORC2 showed that Pdcd4 knockdown increased the protein but not mRNA level of stress-activated-protein kinase interacting protein 1 (Sin1), which resulted from enhanced Sin1 translation. To understand how Pdcd4 regulates Sin1 translation, the SIN1 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) was fused with luciferase reporter and named as 5'Sin1-Luc. Pdcd4 knockdown/knockout significantly increased the translation of 5'Sin1-Luc but not the control luciferase without the SIN1 5'UTR, suggesting that Sin1 5'UTR is necessary for Pdcd4 to inhibit Sin1 translation. Ectopic expression of wild-type Pdcd4 and Pdcd4(157-469), a deletion mutant that binds to translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), sufficiently inhibited Sin1 translation, and thus suppressed mTORC2 kinase activity and invasion in colon tumor cells. By contrast, Pdcd4(157-469)(D253A,D418A), a mutant that does not bind to eIF4A, failed to inhibit Sin1 translation, and consequently failed to repress mTORC2 activity and invasion. In addition, directly inhibiting eIF4A with silvestrol significantly suppressed Sin1 translation and attenuated invasion. These results indicate that Pdcd4-inhibited Sin1 translation is through suppressing eIF4A, and functionally important for suppression of mTORC2 activity and invasion. Moreover, in colorectal cancer tissues, the Sin1 protein but not mRNA was significantly upregulated while Pdcd4 protein was downregulated, suggesting that loss of Pdcd4 might correlate with Sin1 protein level but not mRNA level in colorectal cancer patients. Taken together, our work reveals a novel mechanism by which Pdcd4 inhibits Sin1 translation to attenuatemTORC2 activity and thereby suppresses invasion."

However, to date, no studies have concurrently and objectively evaluated the effect of these factors on 25(OH)D. Objectives To evaluate whether OSA and objective short sleep duration are independently associated with reduced 25(OH)D in an adult population sample. Methods A cross-sectional study included 657 individuals from the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, as part of the ERA project. Participants fulfilled questionnaires and underwent clinical evaluation, polysomnography and blood sample collection for 25(OH)D quantification. OSA was classified into three categories (mild, moderate and severe). The risk of 25(OH)D deficiency was considered as levels<30 ng/mL. Short sleep duration was defined as total sleep time<6 hours. Results The risk of 25(OH)D deficiency was observed in 59.5% of the sample, affecting more individuals of the female gender, obese, with African American ethnicity, and those that were smokers, sedentary and presented hypertension and diabetes. In the final logistic model adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity, obesity, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, sedentary lifestyle, seasonality and creatinine serum levels, both OSA and short sleep duration showed significant independent associations with the risk of 25(OH)D deficiency (moderate OSA: OR for 25(OH)D<30 = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.35–3.64, p<0.01; severe OSA: OR for 25(OH)D<30 = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.06–3.00, p = 0.03; short sleep duration: OR for 25(OH)D<30 = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.15–2.26, p = 0.01). After a subgroup analysis, similar results were observed only in participants ≥50 years. Conclusion OSA and short sleep duration are independently associated with the risk of 25(OH)D deficiency in an adult population. Age-related changes in vitamin D metabolism and the frequency of sleep disorders may be involved in these associations. Future studies exploring whether 25(OH)D levels may modulate OSA and sleep curtailment-related outcomes are needed."

Here, we investigate the impact on the corticostriosomal pathway in the valproic acid (VPA)-induced autism spectrum disorder mouse model. VPA administration during the neurogenesis time windows of striosomes, but not the matrix, resulted in aberrant compartmentation [i.e., maternal VPA injections at embryonic day (E)12.75 decreased μ-opioid receptor-positive striosomes, but increased calbindin-positive matrix in the rostral striatum]. VPAE12.75 treatment also impaired the aggregation of cells pulse labeled with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine at E12.75 into striosomal cell clusters, which suggests defective segregation of striosomal cells from matrix cells. This possibility was supported by our findings that VPAE12.75 treatment altered the expression of ephrinA5 and EphA4, two molecules that are related to compartmental segregation. In the VPAE12.75 neocortex, Foxp2-positive neurons were decreased in layer VI, but increased in layer V, which projects to the striosomal compartment. We also investigated VPA effects on the corticostriosomal pathway. VPAE12.75 treatment decreased the putative corticostriosomal synapses of striosomal neurons and induced an aberrant pattern of isolation stress-induced ultrasonic vocalizations. Of interest, risperidone treatments conjointly improved ultrasonic vocalizations and restored the striosomal compartment in VPAE12.75 pups. Collectively, dysfunctional corticostriatal pathways, particularly via the aberrant striosomal compartment, may be involved in autism spectrum disorder pathophysiology.-Kuo, H.-Y., Liu, F.-C.

https://openalex.org/W2734840967,"One characteristic of cancer cells is the abnormally high rate of cell metabolism to sustain their enhanced proliferation. However, the behind mechanism of this phenomenon is still elusive. Here we find that enhanced precursor 45s ribosomal RNA (pre-45s rRNA) is one of the core mechanisms in promoting the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Pre-45s rRNA expression is significantly higher in primary CRC tumor tissues samples and cancer cell lines compared with the non-tumorous colon tissues, and is associated with tumor sizes. Knockdown of pre-45s rRNA inhibits G1/S cell-cycle transition by stabilizing p53 through inducing murine double minute 2 (MDM2) and ribosomal protein L11 (RpL11) interaction. In addition, we revealed that high rate of cancer cell metabolism triggers the passive release of calcium ion from endoplasmic reticulum to the cytoplasm. The elevated calcium ion in the cytoplasm activates the signaling cascade of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) and ribosomal S6K (CaMKII-S6K-UBF). The activated UBF promotes the transcription of rDNA, which therefore increases pre-45s rRNA. Disruption of CaMKII-S6K-UBF axis by either RNAi or pharmaceutical approaches leads to reduction of pre-45s rRNA expression, which subsequently suppresses cell proliferation in colon cancer cells by causing cell-cycle arrest. Knockdown of APC activates CaMKII-S6K-UBF cascade and thus enhances pre-45s rRNA expression. Moreover, the high expression level of pre-45s rRNA is associated with poor survival of CRC patients in two independent cohorts. Our study identifies a novel mechanism in CRC pathogenesis mediated by pre-45s rRNA and a prognostic factor of pre-45s rRNA in CRC patients."
https://openalex.org/W2726800879,"Mountains receive a greater proportion of precipitation than other environments, and thus make a disproportionate contribution to the world's water supply. The Luquillo Mountains receive the highest rainfall on the island of Puerto Rico and serve as a critical source of water to surrounding communities. The area's role as a long-term research site has generated numerous hydrological, ecological, and geological investigations that have been included in regional and global overviews that compare tropical forests to other ecosystems. Most of the forest- and watershed-wide estimates of precipitation (and evapotranspiration, as inferred by a water balance) have assumed that precipitation increases consistently with elevation. However, in this new analysis of all known current and historical rain gages in the region, we find that similar to other mountainous islands in the trade wind latitudes, leeward (western) watersheds in the Luquillo Mountains receive lower mean annual precipitation than windward (eastern) watersheds. Previous studies in the Luquillo Mountains have therefore overestimated precipitation in leeward watersheds by up to 40%. The Icacos watershed, however, despite being located at elevations 200-400 m below the tallest peaks and to the lee of the first major orographic barrier, receives some of the highest precipitation. Such lee-side enhancement has been observed in other island mountains of similar height and width, and may be caused by several mechanisms. Thus, the long-reported discrepancy of unrealistically low rates of evapotranspiration in the Icacos watershed is likely caused by previous underestimation of precipitation, perhaps by as much as 20%. Rainfall/runoff ratios in several previous studies suggested either runoff excess or runoff deficiency in Luquillo watersheds, but this analysis suggests that in fact they are similar to other tropical watersheds. Because the Luquillo Mountains often serve as a wet tropical archetype in global assessments of basic ecohydrological processes, these revised estimates are relevant to regional and global assessments of runoff efficiency, hydrologic effects of reforestation, geomorphic processes, and climate change."

TR is a necessary virulence factor that enables the persistent infection of some parasites. We performed bioinformatics analyses and biochemical assays to characterize the activity, subcellular localization, and genetic ablation of Toxoplasma gondii TR (TgTR), to shed light on its biologic function. We expressed the TgTR protein with an Escherichia coli expression system and analyzed its enzyme activity, reporting a Km for the recombinant TgTR of 11.47–15.57 μM, using NADPH as a substrate, and 130.48–151.09 μM with dithio-bis-nitrobenzoic acid as a substrate. The TgTR sequence shared homology with that of TR, but lacked a selenocysteine residue in the C-terminal region and was thought to contain 2 flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) domains and 1 NADPH domain. In addition, immunoelectron microscopy results showed that TgTR was widely dispersed in the cytoplasm, and we observed that parasite antioxidant capacity, invasion efficiency, and proliferation were decreased in TR-knockout (TR-KO) strains in vitro, although this strain still stimulated the release of reactive oxygen species release in mouse macrophages while being more sensitive to H2O2 toxicity in vitro. Furthermore, our in vivo results revealed that the survival time of mice infected with the TR-KO strain was significantly prolonged relative to that of mice infected with the wild-type strain.

https://openalex.org/W2733932625,"Deformed wing virus (DWV) is a lethal virus of honeybees (Apis mellifera) implicated in elevated colony mortality rates worldwide and facilitated through vector transmission by the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor. Clinical, symptomatic DWV infections are almost exclusively associated with high virus titres during pupal development, usually acquired through feeding by Varroa mites when reproducing on bee pupae. Control of the mite population, generally through acaricide treatment, is essential for breaking the DWV epidemic and minimizing colony losses. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of remedial mite control on clearing DWV from a colony. DWV titres in adult bees and pupae were monitored at 2 week intervals through summer and autumn in acaricide-treated and untreated colonies. The DWV titres in Apistan treated colonies was reduced 1000-fold relative to untreated colonies, which coincided with both the removal of mites and also a turnover of the bee population in the colony. This adult bee population turnover is probably more critical than previously realized for effective clearing of DWV infections. After this initial reduction, subclinical DWV titres persisted and even increased again gradually during autumn, demonstrating that alternative non-Varroa transmission routes can maintain the DWV titres at significant subclinical levels even after mite removal. The implications of these results for practical recommendations to mitigate deleterious subclinical DWV infections and improving honeybee health management are discussed."

Starting with mite maintenance and the preparation of the experimental mite populations of developmentally synchronized larvae and adults, we describe 3 methods for delivery of small molecules including artificial diet, leaf coating, and soaking. The presented results define critical steps in these methods and demonstrate that they can successfully deliver tracer dyes into mites. Described protocols provide guidelines for high-throughput setups for delivery of experimental compounds that could be used in reverse genetics platforms to modulate gene expression or protein activity, or for screens focused on discovery of new molecules for mite control.

We and others have demonstrated that progesterone (P4) increases CK5+ breast cancer cells. We previously discovered that retinoids block P4 induction of CK5+ cells. Here we investigated the mechanisms by which progesterone receptors (PR) and retinoic acid receptors (RAR) regulate CK5 expression and breast CSC activity. After P4 treatment, sorted CK5+ compared to CK5− cells were more tumorigenic in vivo. In vitro, P4-treated breast cancer cells formed larger mammospheres and silencing of CK5 using small hairpin RNA abolished this P4-dependent increase in mammosphere size. Retinoic acid (RA) treatment blocked the P4 increase in CK5+ cells and prevented the P4 increase in mammosphere size. Dual small interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing of RARα and RARγ reversed RA blockade of P4-induced CK5. Using promoter deletion analysis, we identified a region 1.1 kb upstream of the CK5 transcriptional start site that is necessary for P4 activation and contains a putative progesterone response element (PRE). We confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation that P4 recruits PR to the CK5 promoter near the −1.1 kb essential PRE, and also to a proximal region near −130 bp that contains PRE half-sites and a RA response element (RARE). RA induced loss of PR binding only at the proximal site. Interestingly, RARα was recruited to the −1.1 kb PRE and the −130 bp PRE/RARE regions with P4, but not RA alone or RA plus P4. Treatment of breast cancer xenografts in vivo with the retinoid fenretinide reduced the accumulation of CK5+ cells during estrogen depletion. This reduction, together with the inhibition of CK5+ cell expansion through RAR/PR cross talk, may explain the efficacy of retinoids in prevention of some breast cancer recurrences."

In accordance, real-time measurements of oxidative phosphorylation in response to deguelin treatment demonstrated an immediate decrease in oxygen consumption in both parasitic (Haemonchus contortus) and free-living (Caenorhabditis elegans) nematodes. Consequently, we hypothesize that deguelin is exerting its toxic effect on nematodes as a modulator of oxidative phosphorylation. This study highlights the dynamic biologic response of multicellular organisms to deguelin perturbation.-Preston, S., Korhonen, P. K., Mouchiroud, L., Cornaglia, M., McGee, S. L., Young, N.

https://openalex.org/W2735599880,"Loss of function mutations in the neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) gene, coding for a tumour suppressor, Merlin, cause multiple tumours of the nervous system such as schwannomas, meningiomas and ependymomas. These tumours may occur sporadically or as part of the hereditary condition neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2). Current treatment is confined to (radio) surgery and no targeted drug therapies exist. NF2 mutations and/or Merlin inactivation are also seen in other cancers including some mesothelioma, breast cancer, colorectal carcinoma, melanoma and glioblastoma. To study the relationship between Merlin deficiency and tumourigenesis, we have developed an in vitro model comprising human primary schwannoma cells, the most common Merlin-deficient tumour and the hallmark for NF2. Using this model, we show increased expression of cellular prion protein (PrPC) in schwannoma cells and tissues. In addition, a strong overexpression of PrPC is observed in human Merlin-deficient mesothelioma cell line TRA and in human Merlin-deficient meningiomas. PrPC contributes to increased proliferation, cell-matrix adhesion and survival in schwannoma cells acting via 37/67 kDa non-integrin laminin receptor (LR/37/67 kDa) and downstream ERK1/2, PI3K/AKT and FAK signalling pathways. PrPC protein is also strongly released from schwannoma cells via exosomes and as a free peptide suggesting that it may act in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner. We suggest that PrPC and its interactor, LR/37/67 kDa, could be potential therapeutic targets for schwannomas and other Merlin-deficient tumours."
https://openalex.org/W2724449250,"There are 8 different human syndromes caused by mutations in the cholesterol synthesis pathway. A subset of these disorders such as Smith-Lemli-Opitz disorder, are associated with facial dysmorphia. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying such facial deficits are not fully understood, primarily because of the diverse functions associated with the cholesterol synthesis pathway. Recent evidence has demonstrated that mutation of the zebrafish ortholog of HMGCR results in orofacial clefts. Here we sought to expand upon these data, by deciphering the cholesterol dependent functions of the cholesterol synthesis pathway from the cholesterol independent functions. Moreover, we utilized loss of function analysis and pharmacological inhibition to determine the extent of sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling in animals with aberrant cholesterol and/or isoprenoid synthesis. Our analysis confirmed that mutation of hmgcs1, which encodes the first enzyme in the cholesterol synthesis pathway, results in craniofacial abnormalities via defects in cranial neural crest cell differentiation. Furthermore targeted pharmacological inhibition of the cholesterol synthesis pathway revealed a novel function for isoprenoid synthesis during vertebrate craniofacial development. Mutation of hmgcs1 had no effect on Shh signaling at 2 and 3 days post fertilization (dpf), but did result in a decrease in the expression of gli1, a known Shh target gene, at 4 dpf, after morphological deficits in craniofacial development and chondrocyte differentiation were observed in hmgcs1 mutants. These data raise the possibility that deficiencies in cholesterol modulate chondrocyte differentiation by a combination of Shh independent and Shh dependent mechanisms. Moreover, our results describe a novel function for isoprenoids in facial development and collectively suggest that cholesterol regulates craniofacial development through versatile mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2734709917,"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the most aggressive urologic cancers, however, the mechanism on supporting RCC carcinogenesis is still not clear. By using gene expression profile analysis and functional clustering, PDZ domain-containing 1 (PDZK1) was revealed to be downregulated in human clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) samples, which was also verified in several independent public ccRCC data sets. Using PDZK1 overexpression and knockdown models in ccRCC cell lines, we demonstrated that PDZK1 inhibited cell proliferation, cell cycle G1/S phase transition, cell migration and invasion, indicating a tumor-suppressor role in the development and progression of ccRCC. Our study further demonstrated that PDZK1 inhibited cell proliferation and migration of ccRCC via targeting SHP-1. PDZK1 was further identified to suppress cell proliferation by blocking SHP-1 phosphorylation at Tyr536 via inhibition of the association between SHP-1 and PLCβ3, and then retarding Akt phosphorylation and promoting STAT5 phosphorylation in ccRCC cells. Moreover, the inhibitive effects of PDZK1 on SHP-1 phosphorylation and the tumor growth were verified in vivo by xenograft tumor studies. Accordingly, PDZK1 expression was negatively correlated with SHP-1 activation and phosphorylation, advanced pathologic stage, tumor weight and size, and prognosis of ccRCC patients. These findings have provided first lines of evidences that PDZK1 expression is negatively correlated with SHP-1 activation and poor clinical outcomes in ccRCC. PDZK1 was identified as a novel tumor suppressor in ccRCC by negating SHP-1 activity."
https://openalex.org/W2725062634,"CD4+ T cell help to CD8+ T cell responses requires that CD4+ and CD8+ T cells interact with the same antigen presenting dendritic cell (Ag+DC), but it remains controversial whether helper signals are delivered indirectly through a licensed DC and/or involve direct CD4+/CD8+ T cell contacts and/or the formation of ternary complexes. We here describe the first in vivo imaging of the intact spleen, aiming to evaluate the first interactions between antigen-specific CD4+, CD8+ T cells and Ag+DCs. We show that in contrast to CD4+ T cells which form transient contacts with Ag+DC, CD8+ T cells form immediate stable contacts and activate the Ag+DC, acquire fragments of the DC membranes by trogocytosis, leading to their acquisition of some of the DC properties. They express MHC class II, and become able to present the specific Marilyn peptide to naïve Marilyn CD4+ T cells, inducing their extensive division. In vivo, these CD8+ T cells form direct stable contacts with motile naïve CD4+ T cells, recruiting them to Ag+DC binding and to the formation of ternary complexes, where CD4+ and CD8+ T cells interact with the DC and with one another. The presence of CD8+ T cells during in vivo immune responses leads to the early activation and up-regulation of multiple functions by CD4+ T lymphocytes. Thus, while CD4+ T cell help is important to CD8+ T cell responses, CD8+ T cells can interact directly with naïve CD4+ T cells impacting their recruitment and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2734789006,"RAS signalling is involved in the control of several metabolic pathways including glycolysis, mitochondrial respiration and glutamine metabolism. Importantly, we have found here that loss of PDHK4, a key regulator of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, caused a profound cell growth inhibition in tumour cells harbouring KRAS mutations. Using isogenic cells and a panel of colorectal and lung cell lines we demonstrated that KRAS mutant cells showed a dependency on PDHK4 whereas KRAS wild-type cells were significantly resistant to PDHK4 knockdown. We have found that PDHK4 plays a role in the post-translational regulation of mutant KRAS activity. Depletion of PDHK4 causes disruption of KRAS cellular localization, a reduction in KRAS activity which, in turn, results in reduced MAPK signalling. Interestingly, PDHK4 and KRAS depletion resulted in a similar metabolic phenotype consisting of a reduction of glucose and fatty acid oxidation. Moreover, stable expression of PDHK4 increased localization of activated KRAS at the plasma membrane and induced tumour cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Taken together these data support a model where PDHK4 regulates KRAS signalling and its tumorigenic properties and suggest that inhibition of PDHK4 could represent a novel therapeutic strategy to target KRAS mutant colorectal and lung cancers."

We hypothesized that a critical transition state prior to the new onset T2DM can be revealed through the longitudinal electronic medical record (EMR) analysis.We applied the transition-based network entropy methodology which previously identified a dynamic driver network (DDN) underlying the critical T2DM transition at the tissue molecular biological level. To profile pre-disease phenotypical changes that indicated a critical transition state, a cohort of 7,334 patients was assembled from the Maine State Health Information Exchange (HIE). These patients all had their first confirmative diagnosis of T2DM between January 1, 2013 and June 30, 2013. The cohort's EMRs from the 24 months preceding their date of first T2DM diagnosis were extracted.Analysis of these patients' pre-disease clinical history identified a dynamic driver network (DDN) and an associated critical transition state six months prior to their first confirmative T2DM state.This 6-month window before the disease state provides an early warning of the impending T2DM, warranting an opportunity to apply proactive interventions to prevent or delay the new onset of T2DM."
https://openalex.org/W2733278315,"Recent research has demonstrated that temperature and precipitation conditions correlate with successful reproduction in some insectivorous bat species that live in arid and semiarid regions, and that hot and dry conditions correlate with reduced lactation and reproductive output by females of some species. However, the potential long-term impacts of climate-induced reproductive declines on bat populations in western North America are not well understood. We combined results from long-term field monitoring and experiments in our study area with information on vital rates to develop stochastic age-structured population dynamics models and analyzed how simulated fringed myotis (Myotis thysanodes) populations changed under projected future climate conditions in our study area near Boulder, Colorado (Boulder Models) and throughout western North America (General Models). Each simulation consisted of an initial population of 2,000 females and an approximately stable age distribution at the beginning of the simulation. We allowed each population to be influenced by the mean annual temperature and annual precipitation for our study area and a generalized range-wide model projected through year 2086, for each of four carbon emission scenarios (representative concentration pathways RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, RCP8.5). Each population simulation was repeated 10,000 times. Of the 8 Boulder Model simulations, 1 increased (+29.10%), 3 stayed approximately stable (+2.45%, +0.05%, -0.03%), and 4 simulations decreased substantially (-44.10%, -44.70%, -44.95%, -78.85%). All General Model simulations for western North America decreased by >90% (-93.75%, -96.70%, -96.70%, -98.75%). These results suggest that a changing climate in western North America has the potential to quickly erode some forest bat populations including species of conservation concern, such as fringed myotis."
https://openalex.org/W2730289171,"In pancreatic β cells, muscarinic cholinergic receptor M3 (M3R) stimulates glucose-induced secretion of insulin. Regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins are critical modulators of GPCR activity, yet their role in β cells remains largely unknown. R7 subfamily RGS proteins are stabilized by the G-protein subunit Gβ5, such that the knockout of the Gnb5 gene results in degradation of all R7 subunits. We found that Gnb5 knockout in mice or in the insulin-secreting MIN6 cell line almost completely eliminates insulinotropic activity of M3R. Moreover, over-expression of Gβ5-RGS7 strongly promotes M3R-stimulated insulin secretion. Examination of this noncanonical mechanism in Gnb5−/− MIN6 cells showed that cAMP, diacylglycerol, or Ca2+ levels were not significantly affected. There was no reduction in the amplitude of free Ca2+ responses in islets from the Gnb5−/− mice, but the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations induced by cholinergic agonist was lowered by more than 30%. Ablation of Gnb5 impaired M3R-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Stimulation of the ERK pathway in Gnb5−/− cells by epidermal growth factor restored M3R-stimulated insulin release to near normal levels. Identification of the novel role of Gβ5-R7 in insulin secretion may lead to a new therapeutic approach for improving pancreatic β-cell function.—Wang, Q., Pronin, A.

https://openalex.org/W2735575797,"The information on candidate cancer driver alterations available from public databases is often descriptive and of limited mechanistic insight, which poses difficulties for reliable distinction between true driver and passenger events. To address this challenge, we performed in-depth analysis of whole-exome sequencing data from cell lines generated by a barrier bypass-clonal expansion (BBCE) protocol. The employed strategy is based on carcinogen-driven immortalization of primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts and recapitulates early steps of cell transformation. Among the mutated genes were almost 200 COSMIC Cancer Gene Census genes, many of which were recurrently affected in the set of 25 immortalized cell lines. The alterations affected pathways regulating DNA damage response and repair, transcription and chromatin structure, cell cycle and cell death, as well as developmental pathways. The functional impact of the mutations was strongly supported by the manifestation of several known cancer hotspot mutations among the identified alterations. We identified a new set of genes encoding subunits of the BAF chromatin remodeling complex that exhibited Ras-mediated dependence on PRC2 histone methyltransferase activity, a finding that is similar to what has been observed for other BAF subunits in cancer cells. Among the affected BAF complex subunits, we determined Smarcd2 and Smarcc1 as putative driver candidates not yet fully identified by large-scale cancer genome sequencing projects. In addition, Ep400 displayed characteristics of a driver gene in that it showed a mutually exclusive mutation pattern when compared with mutations in the Trrap subunit of the TIP60 complex, both in the cell line panel and in a human tumor data set. We propose that the information generated by deep sequencing of the BBCE cell lines coupled with phenotypic analysis of the mutant cells can yield mechanistic insights into driver events relevant to human cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W2724380489,"Background and objectives In dialysis patients, there is an increasing evidence that altered bone metabolism is associated with cardiovascular calcifications. The main objective of this study was to analyse, in hemodialysis patients, the relationships between bone turnover, mineralization and volume, evaluated in bone biopsies, with a plain X-ray vascular calcification score. Design, setting, participants and measurements In a cross-sectional study, bone biopsies and evaluation of vascular calcifications were performed in fifty hemodialysis patients. Cancellous bone volume, mineralized bone volume, osteoid volume, activation frequency, bone formation rate/bone surface, osteoid thickness and mineralization lag time were determined by histomorphometry. Vascular calcifications were assessed by the simple vascular calcification score (SVCS) in plain X-Ray of pelvis and hands and, for comparison, by the Agatston score in Multi-Slice Computed Tomography (MSCT). Results SVCS≥3 was present in 20 patients (40%). Low and high bone turnover were present in 54% and 38% of patients, respectively. Low bone volume was present in 20% of patients. In multivariable analysis, higher age (p = 0.015) and longer hemodialysis duration (p = 0.017) were associated with SVCS≥3. Contrary to cancellous bone volume, the addition to this model of mineralized bone volume (OR = 0.863; 95%CI: 0.766, 0.971; p = 0.015), improved the performance of the model. For each increase of 1% in mineralized bone volume there was a 13.7% decrease in the odds of having SVCS≥3 (p = 0.015). An Agatston score>400 was observed in 80% of the patients with a SVCS≥3 versus 4% of patients with a SVCS<3, (p<0.001). Conclusion Higher mineralized bone volume was associated with a lower plain X-ray vascular calcification. This study corroborates the hypothesis of the existence of a link between bone and vessel and reinforces the clinical utility of this simple and inexpensive vascular calcification score in dialysis patients."

However, it remains unknown whether Clock directly cross-talks with Nodal signaling and how this would regulate embryonic development. Here we show that Clock1a coordinated mesoderm development and primitive hematopoiesis in zebrafish embryos by directly up-regulating Nodal-Smad3 signaling. We found that Clock1a is expressed both maternally and zygotically throughout early zebrafish development. We also noted that Clock1a alterations produce embryonic defects with shortened body length, lack of the ventral tail fin, or partial defect of the eyes. Clock1a regulates the expression of the mesodermal markers ntl, gsc, and eve1 and of the hematopoietic markers scl, lmo2, and fli1a. Biochemical analyses revealed that Clock1a stimulates Nodal signaling by increasing expression of Smad2/3/4. Mechanistically, Clock1a activates the smad3a promoter via its E-box1 element (CAGATG). Taken together, these findings provide mechanistic insight into the role of Clock1a in the regulation of mesoderm development and primitive hematopoiesis via modulation of Nodal-Smad3 signaling and indicate that Smad3a is directly controlled by the circadian clock in zebrafish.

https://openalex.org/W2736033779,"Mdm2 is often overexpressed in tumors that retain wild-type TP53 but may affect therapeutic response independently of p53. Herein is shown that tumor cells with MDM2 amplification are selectively resistant to treatment with topoisomerase II poisons but not other DNA damaging agents. Tumor cells that overexpress Mdm2 have reduced DNA double-strand breaks in response to doxorubicin or etoposide. This latter result is not due to altered drug uptake. The selective attenuation of DNA damage in response to these agents is dependent on both Mdm2 levels and an intact ubiquitin ligase function. These findings reveal a novel, p53-independent activity of Mdm2 and have important implications for the choice of chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of Mdm2-overexpressing tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2728154947,"The rape stem weevil, Ceutorhynchus napi Gyll., is a serious pest of winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) crops in Europe causing severe yield loss. In currently used oilseed rape cultivars no resistance to C. napi has been identified. Resynthesized lines of B. napus have potential to broaden the genetic variability and may improve resistance to insect pests. In this study, the susceptibility to C. napi of three cultivars, one breeding line and five resynthesized lines of oilseed rape was compared in a semi-field plot experiment under multi-choice conditions. Plant acceptance for oviposition was estimated by counting the number of C. napi larvae in stems. The larval instar index and the dry body mass were assessed as indicators of larval performance. The extent of larval feeding within stems was determined by the stem injury coefficient. Morphological stem traits and stem contents of glucosinolates were assessed as potential mediators of resistance. The resynthesized line S30 had significantly fewer larvae than the cultivars Express617 and Visby and the resynthesized lines L122 and L16. The low level of larval infestation in S30 was associated with a low larval instar and stem injury index. Low numbers of larvae were not correlated with the length or diameter of stems, and the level of stem glucosinolates. As indicated by the low larval infestation and slow larval development the resistance of S30 to C. napi is based on both antixenotic and antibiotic properties of the genotypes. The resynthesized line S30 should therefore be introduced into B. napus breeding programs to enhance resistance against C. napi."
https://openalex.org/W2731967645,"Atherosclerosis is a pro-inflammatory condition underlying many cardiovascular diseases. Platelet-activating factor (PAF) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) are actively involved in the onset and progression of atherosclerotic plaques. The involvement of monocyte-derived macrophages is well characterized in the installation of inflammatory conditions in the plaque, but less is known about the contribution of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs). In the same way, the involvement of calcium, phospholipase C and A2 in PAF-induced IL-6 production, in different cells types, has been shown; however, the importance of the Jak/STAT pathway and its regulation by protein-tyrosine phosphatases in this response have not been addressed. In this study, we report that PAF stimulates PTP1B activity via Jak2, thereby modulating PAF-induced IL-6 production. Using HEK 293 cells stably transfected with the PAF receptor in order to discriminate the pathway components, our results suggest that Jak2 modulates PAF-induced IL-6 production via both positive and negative pathways. Jak2 kinase activity was necessary for maximal transactivation of the IL-6 promoter, as seen by luciferase assays, whereas the same kinase also downregulated this promoter transactivation through the activation of a calcium/calpain/PTP1B pathway. The same pathways were operational in monocyte-derived dendritic cells, since PAF-induced PTP1B activation negatively regulated PAF-induced IL-6 mRNA production and, in addition, Jak2 activated calpain, one of the components involved in PAF-induced PTP1B activation. Results obtained in this study indicate that Jak2 activation is important for maximal IL-6 promoter transactivation by PAF and that PTP1B is involved in the negative regulation of this transactivation. However, PTP1B does not directly regulate Jak2 activation, but rather Jak2 regulates PAF-induced PTP1B activation."
https://openalex.org/W2731338917,"Protein kinases, including the serine/threonine kinase Akt, mediate manifold bioactivities of vitamin A, although the mechanisms behind the sustained kinase activation are diffuse. To investigate the role of cellular lipids as targetable factors in Akt signaling, we combined mass spectrometry-based lipidomics with immunologic detection of Akt (Ser473) phosphorylation. A screening campaign revealed retinol (vitamin A alcohol) and all-trans retinoic acid (vitamin A acid) (RA) as hits that time-dependently (≥24 h) deplete phosphatidylcholine-bound polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA-PCs) from NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts while inducing Akt activation (EC50 ≈ 0.1–1 μM). Other mitogenic and stress-regulated kinases were hardly affected. Organized in a coregulated phospholipid subcluster, PUFA-PCs compensated for the RA-induced loss of cellular PUFA-PCs and diminished Akt activation when supplemented. The counter-regulation of phospholipids and Akt by RA was mimicked by knockdown of lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase-3 or the selective retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist bexarotene and prevented by the selective RXR antagonist Hx531. Treatment of mice with retinol decreased the tissue ratio of PUFA-PC and enhanced basal Akt activation preferentially in brain, which was attributed to astrocytes in dissociated cortical cultures. Together, our findings show that RA regulates the long-term activation of Akt by changes in the phospholipid composition.—Pein, H., Koeberle, S.

To assess the reservoir characteristics and the origin of the high-quality reservoir in the Xiaoheba Formation, this paper uses systematic field investigations, physical property analysis, thin section identification, scanning electron microscopy and electron microprobe methods. The results indicate that the Xiaoheba sandstone is an ultra-tight and ultra-low permeability reservoir, with an average porosity of 2.97% and an average permeability of 0.56×10-3 μm2. This promising reservoir is mainly distributed in the Lengshuixi and Shuangliuba regions and the latter has a relatively high-quality reservoir with an average porosity of 5.28% and average permeability of 0.53×10-3 μm2. The reservoir space comprises secondary intergranular dissolved pores, moldic pores and fractures. Microfacies, feldspar dissolution and fracture connectivity control the quality of this reservoir. The relatively weak compaction and cementation in the interbedded delta front distal bar and interdistributary bay microfacies indirectly protected the primary intergranular pores and enhanced late-stage dissolution. Late-stage potassium feldspar dissolution was controlled by the early-stage organic acid dissolution intensity and the distance from the hydrocarbon generation center. Early-stage fractures acted as pathways for organic acid migration and were therefore important factors in the formation of the reservoir. Based on these observations, the area to the west of the Shuangliuba and Lengshuixi regions has potential for gas exploration."
https://openalex.org/W2730890710,"Mutations in the immunoglobulin superfamily, member 1 gene (IGSF1/Igsf1) cause an X-linked form of central hypothyroidism. The canonical form of IGSF1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein with 12 immunoglobulin (Ig) loops. The protein is co-translationally cleaved into two sub-domains. The carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD), which contains the last 7 Ig loops, is trafficked to the plasma membrane. Most pathogenic mutations in IGSF1 map to the portion of the gene encoding the CTD. IGSF1/Igsf1 encodes a variety of transcripts. A little studied, but abundant splice variant encodes a truncated form of the protein, predicted to contain the first 2 Ig loops of the full-length IGSF1. The protein (hereafter referred to as IGSF1 isoform 2 or IGSF1-2) is likely retained in most individuals with IGSF1 mutations. Here, we characterized basic biochemical properties of the protein as a foray into understanding its potential function. IGSF1-2, like the IGSF1-CTD, is a glycoprotein. In both mouse and rat, the protein is N-glycosylated at a single asparagine residue in the first Ig loop. Contrary to earlier predictions, neither the murine nor rat IGSF1-2 is secreted from heterologous or homologous cells. In addition, neither protein associates with the plasma membrane. Rather, IGSF1-2 appears to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. Whether the protein plays intracellular functions or is trafficked through the secretory pathway under certain physiologic or pathophysiologic conditions has yet to be determined."
