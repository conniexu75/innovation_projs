https://openalex.org/W2072886988,"We identified a key oncogenic pathway underlying neuroblastoma progression: specifically, MYCN, expressed at elevated level, transactivates the miRNA 17-5p-92 cluster, which inhibits p21 and BIM translation by interaction with their mRNA 3' UTRs. Overexpression of miRNA 17-5p-92 cluster in MYCN-not-amplified neuroblastoma cells strongly augments their in vitro and in vivo tumorigenesis. In vitro or in vivo treatment with antagomir-17-5p abolishes the growth of MYCN-amplified and therapy-resistant neuroblastoma through p21 and BIM upmodulation, leading to cell cycling blockade and activation of apoptosis, respectively. In primary neuroblastoma, the majority of cases show a rise of miR-17-5p level leading to p21 downmodulation, which is particularly severe in patients with MYCN amplification and poor prognosis. Altogether, our studies demonstrate for the first time that antagomir treatment can abolish tumor growth in vivo, specifically in therapy-resistant neuroblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2095377201,"Dengue haemorrhagic fever is transmitted by the bite of a mosquito infected with dengue virus. It infects more that 50 million people a year and causes some 20,000 deaths, but at present there are no vaccines or therapies specific for the virus. The identification of the host proteins targeted by the virus and the signalling pathways responsible for controlling inflammation and antiviral immunity are essential for the development of therapeutic strategies. Szu-Ting Chen et al. have made a step towards that goal with the discovery that dengue virus interacts with the C-type lectin CLEC5A. The interaction promotes the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and contributes to lethal disease in a mouse model. Dengue hemorrhagic fever is transmitted by the bite of a mosquito infected with dengue virus. The dengue virus interacts with the C-type lectin CLEC45A. The interaction promotes the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and contributes to lethal disease in a mouse model. Dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, the most severe responses to dengue virus (DV) infection, are characterized by plasma leakage (due to increased vascular permeability) and low platelet counts1,2. CLEC5A (C-type lectin domain family 5, member A; also known as myeloid DAP12-associating lectin (MDL-1))3 contains a C-type lectin-like fold similar to the natural-killer T-cell C-type lectin domains and associates with a 12-kDa DNAX-activating protein (DAP12)4 on myeloid cells. Here we show that CLEC5A interacts with the dengue virion directly and thereby brings about DAP12 phosphorylation. The CLEC5A–DV interaction does not result in viral entry but stimulates the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Blockade of CLEC5A–DV interaction suppresses the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines without affecting the release of interferon-α, supporting the notion that CLEC5A acts as a signalling receptor for proinflammatory cytokine release. Moreover, anti-CLEC5A monoclonal antibodies inhibit DV-induced plasma leakage, as well as subcutaneous and vital-organ haemorrhaging, and reduce the mortality of DV infection by about 50% in STAT1-deficient mice. Our observation that blockade of CLEC5A-mediated signalling attenuates the production of proinflammatory cytokines by macrophages infected with DV (either alone or complexed with an enhancing antibody) offers a promising strategy for alleviating tissue damage and increasing the survival of patients suffering from dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, and possibly even other virus-induced inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1970031607,"Social vulnerability is related to the health of elderly people, but its measurement and relationship to frailty are controversial. The aims of the present study were to operationalize social vulnerability according to a deficit accumulation approach, to compare social vulnerability and frailty, and to study social vulnerability in relation to mortality.This is a secondary analysis of community-dwelling elderly people in two cohort studies, the Canadian Study of Health and Aging (CSHA, 1996/7-2001/2; N = 3707) and the National Population Health Survey (NPHS, 1994-2002; N = 2648). Social vulnerability index measures that used self-reported items (23 in NPHS, 40 in CSHA) were constructed. Each measure ranges from 0 (no vulnerability) to 1 (maximum vulnerability). The primary outcome measure was mortality over five (CHSA) or eight (NPHS) years. Associations with age, sex, and frailty (as measured by an analogously constructed frailty index) were also studied. All individuals had some degree of social vulnerability. Women had higher social vulnerability than men, and vulnerability increased with age. Frailty and social vulnerability were moderately correlated. Adjusting for age, sex, and frailty, each additional social 'deficit' was associated with an increased odds of mortality (5 years in CSHA, odds ratio = 1.05, 95% confidence interval: 1.02-1.07; 8 years in the NPHS, odds ratio = 1.08, 95% confidence interval: 1.03-1.14). We identified a meaningful survival gradient across quartiles of social vulnerability, and although women had better survival than men, survival for women with high social vulnerability was equivalent to that of men with low vulnerability.Social vulnerability is reproducibly related to individual frailty/fitness, but distinct from it. Greater social vulnerability is associated with mortality in older adults. Further study on the measurement and operationalization of social vulnerability, and of its relationships to other important health outcomes, is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2129447528,"At some point during biosynthesis of the antimalarial artemisinin in glandular trichomes of Artemisia annua, the Δ11(13) double bond originating in amorpha-4,11-diene is reduced. This is thought to occur in artemisinic aldehyde, but other intermediates have been suggested. In an effort to understand double bond reduction in artemisinin biosynthesis, extracts of A. annua flower buds were investigated and found to contain artemisinic aldehyde Δ11(13) double bond reductase activity. Through a combination of partial protein purification, mass spectrometry, and expressed sequence tag analysis, a cDNA clone corresponding to the enzyme was isolated. The corresponding gene Dbr2, encoding a member of the enoate reductase family with similarity to plant 12-oxophytodienoate reductases, was found to be highly expressed in glandular trichomes. Recombinant Dbr2 was subsequently characterized and shown to be relatively specific for artemisinic aldehyde and to have some activity on small α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Expression in yeast of Dbr2 and genes encoding four other enzymes in the artemisinin pathway resulted in the accumulation of dihydroartemsinic acid. The relevance of Dbr2 to trichome-specific artemisinin biosynthesis is discussed.

The relevance of Dbr2 to trichome-specific artemisinin biosynthesis is discussed. Since its discovery in the 1970s (1Liu J.-M. Ni M.-Y. Fan J. -F. Tu Y. -Y. Wu Z. -H. Wu Y. -L. Chou W.-S. Acta Chim. Sin. 1979; 37: 129-143Google Scholar), the sesquiterpene lactone artemisinin (Fig. 1) from Artemisia annua has become a key factor in the drive to control malaria (2Mutabingwa T.K.

Semi-synthetic derivatives of plant-derived artemisinin form the basis for artemisinin-based combination therapies, which are the treatment of choice for most forms of the disease. Given the pharmaceutical importance of artemisinin and its singular plant source, there is considerable interest in maintaining a reliable and low cost supply (5Kindermans J.M. Pilloy J. Olliaro P. Gomes M. Malar. J. 2007; 6: 125Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A more complete knowledge of artemisinin biosynthesis and the genes involved is likely to provide ways of increasing production and lowering cost through crop improvement or microbial engineering (6Covello P.S. Teoh K.H. Polichuk D.R. Reed D.W. Nowak G. Phytochemistry. 2007; 68: 1864-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 7Zeng Q. Qiu F. Yuan L. Biotechnol. Lett. 2008; 30: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As in other members of the Asteraceae, A. annua has 10-celled biseriate glandular trichomes that appear on the surfaces of aerial parts of the plant (8Wagner G.J. Wang E. Shepherd R.W. Ann. Bot. (Lond.). 2004; 93: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 9Ferreira J.F.S. Simon J.E. Janick J. Hort. Rev. 1997; 19: 319-371Google Scholar, 10Duke S.O. Paul R.N. Int. J. Plant Sci. 1993; 154: 107-118Crossref Google Scholar). Along with other isoprenoids, the sesquiterpene lactone artemisinin accumulates to levels of 0.01–2% dry weight (11Duke M.V. Paul R.N. Elsohly H.N. Sturtz G. Duke S.O. Int. J. Plant Sci. 1994; 155: 365-372Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Although progress is being made in understanding the biosynthesis of artemisinin, considerable gaps in our knowledge remain (6Covello P.S. Teoh K.H. Polichuk D.R. Reed D.W. Nowak G. Phytochemistry. 2007; 68: 1864-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 12Bertea C.M. Freije J.R. Van der Woude H. Verstappen F.W. Perk L. Marquez V. de Kraker J.W. Posthumus M.A. Jansen B.J. de Groot A. Franssen M.C. Bouwmeester H.J. Planta Med. 2005; 71: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The formation of amorpha-4,11-diene by amorpha-4,11-diene synthase is the first committed step in the pathway. This is followed by oxidation at C-12 of amorpha-4,11-diene by the cytochrome P-450, Cyp71av1 to give artemisinic alcohol. These steps are well supported from biochemical studies and by the molecular cloning of genes encoding the relevant enzymes (12Bertea C.M. Freije J.R. Van der Woude H. Verstappen F.W. Perk L. Marquez V. de Kraker J.W. Posthumus M.A. Jansen B.J. de Groot A. Franssen M.C. Bouwmeester H.J. Planta Med. 2005; 71: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 13Chang Y.J. Song S.H.

FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1411-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The pathway beyond artemisinic alcohol is somewhat less well established (6Covello P.S. Teoh K.H. Polichuk D.R. Reed D.W. Nowak G. Phytochemistry. 2007; 68: 1864-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 7Zeng Q. Qiu F. Yuan L. Biotechnol. Lett. 2008; 30: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 15Li Y. Huang H. Wu Y.-L Liang X-T. Fang W.-S. Medicinal Chemistry of Bioactive Natural Products. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2006: 183-256Google Scholar). However, there is biochemical evidence supporting a route to dihydroartemsinic acid via artemisinic aldehyde and dihydroartemsinic aldehyde (12Bertea C.M. Freije J.R. Van der Woude H. Verstappen F.W. Perk L. Marquez V. de Kraker J.W. Posthumus M.A. Jansen B.J. de Groot A. Franssen M.C. Bouwmeester H.J. Planta Med. 2005; 71: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This route includes the proposed reduction of the Δ11(13) double bond of artemisinic aldehyde (Fig. 1). Artemisinin per se appears to be derived from dihydroartemisinic acid in a series of reactions that may not be enzyme-dependent (16Brown G.D. Sy L.-K Tetrahedron. 2004; 60: 1139-1159Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 17Sy L.K. Brown G.D. Tetrahedron. 2002; 58: 897-908Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Alternatively, based on labeling studies, artemisinic acid and derivatives, such as arteannuin B and artemisitene, have been suggested as precursors to artemisinin (6Covello P.S. Teoh K.H. Polichuk D.R. Reed D.W. Nowak G. Phytochemistry. 2007; 68: 1864-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 7Zeng Q. Qiu F. Yuan L. Biotechnol.

John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2006: 183-256Google Scholar). Clearly, a more detailed knowledge of the biochemistry of Δ11(13) double bond reduction during artemisinin formation is important in differentiating the proposed routes, which can be considered “early” and “late” reduction pathways. As part of an effort to understand the isoprenoid metabolism in glandular trichomes of the A. annua L., we have undertaken an expressed sequence tag (EST)-based 4The abbreviations used are: EST, expressed sequence tag; AA, artemisinic acid; Ads, amorpha-4,11-diene synthase; AtOPR, A. thaliana 12-oxophytodienoate reductase; Cpr, A. annua cytochrome P-450 reductase; Cyp71av1, amorpha-4;11-diene monooxygenase; Dbr2, artemisinic aldehyde Δ11(13) reductase; Fps2, A. annua farnesyl diphosphate synthase; GC/MS, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; RT, reverse transcription; GFP, green fluorescent protein; OPR, 12-oxophytodienoate reductase; OYE, old yellow enzyme. approach to identify relevant genes (6Covello P.S.

FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1411-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). This led to the identification of Cyp71av1, a multifunctional cytochrome P-450 capable of multiple oxidations of amorpha-4,11-diene. In a continuation of our investigation of the enzymes involved in artemisinin biosynthesis, we report here on the combined use of enzyme purification, mass spectrometry, and EST analysis leading to the molecular cloning and characterization of a sesquiterpenoid double bond reductase from A. annua. The characterization of this enzyme provides important support for the early Δ11(13) reduction in artemisinin biosynthesis. Plant Materials—A. annua seeds were obtained from Pedro Melillo de Magalhães (State University of Campinas, Brazil; line 2/39). The A. annua 2/39 line is characterized as a high artemisinin chemotype with a characteristically high dihydroartemisinic acid to artemisinic acid ratio (∼20:1 in flower buds; data not shown) (18Wallaart T.E. Pras N. Beekman A.C. Quax W.J. Planta Med. 2000; 66: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The seeds were germinated and grown in soil in a controlled environment chamber with 16-h 24 °C days and 8-h 21 °C nights. Plants that had reached the height of ∼1.2 m (after about 3 months) were transferred to a flowering chamber with 8-h 24 °C days and 16-h 21 °C nights. Roots, leaves (mixtures of upper, middle, and lower leaves), and flower buds (27–29 days after flower induction under short days) were harvested and stored at -80 °C for subsequent RNA isolations and enzyme assays. Glandular trichomes were prepared from flower buds as described previously (14Teoh K.H. Polichuk D.R. Reed D.W. Nowak G. Covello P.S. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1411-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Chemicals—Artemisinin, pyridinium chlorochromate, coniferyl aldehyde, 2-cyclohexen-1-one, 2E-hexenal, hexanal, 2E-nonenal, nonanal, (+)-α-pinene, and (+)-pulegone were obtained from Aldrich, and (+)-carvone, cyclohexanone, dihydrocarvone were obtained from Sigma. 12-Oxophytodienoic acid was obtained from Cedarlane Laboratories (Burlington, Canada). Arteannuin B and artemisitene were kindly provided by Dieter Deforce (University of Ghent). Artemisinic alcohol preparation was described previously (14Teoh K.H. Polichuk D.R. Reed D.W. Nowak G. Covello P.S. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1411-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Sabinone was synthesized from sabinyl acetate obtained from the Plant Biotechnology Institute terpene collection (19von Rudloff E. Can J. Chem. 1963; 41: 2876-2881Crossref Google Scholar) by saponification of the sabinyl acetate to d-sabinol followed by oxidation of the alcohol using pyridinium chlorochromate (20Corey E.J. Suggs J.W. Tetrahedron Lett. 1975; 16: 2647-2650Crossref Scopus (2701) Google Scholar). The product was verified by mass spectral analysis. Isolation and/or semi-synthesis of artemisinic acid and artemisinic aldehyde, dihydroartemisinic acid, and three preparations containing dihydroartemisinic aldehyde epimers were prepared as described in the supplemental data. GC/MS Analysis—GC/MS analyses were performed on an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph coupled to an Agilent 5973N mass selective detector in electron impact mode (70 eV) with either an InnoWax column (30-m × 0.25-mm inner diameter; Agilent) for sesquiterpenoid analysis or a DB-5 column (30-m × 0.25-mm inner diameter; J & W Scientific) for other compounds analyzed. The InnoWax column was temperature-programmed from 125 to 300 °C at 5 °C min-1; the DB-5 column was programmed at an initial temperature of 40 °C for 5 min and then increased to 240 °C at 5 °C min-1. GC/MS analysis of reductase assays using arteannuin B and artemisitene was accomplished using a short DB-5 column (10-m × 0.25-mm inner diameter; Agilent) with all heated zones set to <150 °C to prevent thermal decomposition of any heat labile compounds (including artemisinin) and an oven temperature program of 120–150 °C at 2 °C min-1. Under these conditions no degradation of a standard of artemisinin was detected. Reductase Assays—Unless otherwise stated, double bond reductase assays were carried out as follows. The reactions were initiated by adding 0.5 mm substrate to a 300-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm NADPH, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and various amounts of enzyme preparation. Protein in enzyme preparations was quantified by Bio-Rad protein assay. Negative controls were carried out with boiled proteins and without NADPH. The reactions were allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30 °C with shaking (500 rpm), stopped by adding 15 μl of glacial acetic acid, and extracted with 150 μl ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate extracts were used directly for GC/MS analysis. The reaction products were confirmed by comparing GC retention time and MS data with those of standards. For quantitation, 3 μg of octadecane was used as an internal standard. For details of the reductase measurements in plant tissues, the partial purification of the reductase, and related protein MS, see the supplemental data. Phylogenetic Analysis—Phylogenetic analysis of selected amino acid sequences showing similarity to Dbr2 was performed as described previously (21Meesapyodsuk D. Reed D.W. Covello P.S. Qiu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20191-20199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Characterization of Recombinant Artemisinic Aldehyde Δ11(13) Reductase—Recombinant Dbr2 was prepared as described in the supplemental data. For characterization of the enzyme, the reaction mixtures were prewarmed to 30 °C, and the reactions were initiated by addition of Dbr2. The pH optimum of the purified Dbr2 was determined to be 7.5 in assay that included one of three 50 mm buffers (MES, HEPES, and Tris-HCl) adjusted to between pH 5.5 and 9.0 in 0.5-unit intervals and 0.5 mm artemisinic aldehyde and 0.48 μg of purified recombinant Dbr2. Apparent kinetic parameters were determined under conditions that limited conversion to less than 10% as follows. Concentrations of artemisinic aldehyde (6–250 μm; 0.24 μg of Dbr2, 2 min), 2-cyclohexen-1-one (80–10,000 μm; 0.48 μg of Dbr2; 10 min), and (+)-carvone (20–5000 μm; 0.48 μg Dbr2; 10 min) were varied in the presence of 1 mm NADPH. To assess cofactor specificity, concentrations of NADPH (10–640 μm; 0.48 μg of Dbr2, 2 min) and NADH (0.2–13 mm; 1.9 μg of Dbr2; 2 min) were varied in the presence of 0.5 mm artemisinic aldehyde. The ethyl acetate extracts from triplicate reaction mixtures were directly analyzed by GC/MS. Octadecane was used as an internal standard to quantify the products formed from the reactions using response factors determined using standards for each enzyme product. The Km and kcat values were determined by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). RNA Isolation and Gene Expression Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from plant tissues using a RNeasy Plant RNA isolation kit (Qiagen). For quantitative RT-PCR analysis of Dbr2 expression, first strand cDNA was prepared using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using 2 μg of total RNA as the template. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using a MX3005P Cycler (Stratagene) with a SYBR® GreenER qPCR SuperMix Universal kit (Invitrogen). The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 4 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 40 s, and one cycle of 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 30 s, and 95 °C for 30 s. The primers 5′-CTTGGGTTACAAGCTGTGGCTCAAG-3′ and 5′-ATATAATCAAAACTAGAGGAGTGAC C-3′ were used to amplify a 209-bp fragment of the Dbr2 transcript. The primers 5′-CCAGCAGCTTCCATTCCGAT-3′ and 5′-CGCCATCCTTCGTTTGGACT-3′ were used to amplify a 300-bp fragment of a gene named A. annua Actin1 by the authors. These were designed based on the sequence of a cDNA fragment corresponding to A. annua Actin1 cloned from an RT-PCR product using the degenerate primers 5′-AGCAACTGGGATGACATGGAG-3′ and 5′-CACCTTCGATCTTCATGCTG-3′ and A. annua leaf cDNA. Subcellular Localization of Dbr2—To investigate the subcellular localization of artemisinic aldehyde Δ11(13) reductase, Dbr2 and Arabidopsis thaliana Opr3 were introduced into the vector pER420. The vector pER420, obtained from Raju Datla (Plant Biotechnology Institute), was derived from pK7WG2 (22Karimi M. Inze D. Depicker A. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 193-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar) by the introduction of a sequence encoding smGFP immediately downstream of the 35S promoter and a sequence encoding an E-tag immediately upstream of the 35S terminator. The open reading frame of A. thaliana Opr3 was first obtained by RT-PCR using the primers 5′-CACCATGACGGCGGCACAAGGGAACTC-3′ and 5′-TCAGAGGCGGGAAAAAGGAGCC-3′. The resulting PCR product was cloned using pENTR/D to give pENTR/D-AtOPR3. The open reading frames of Dbr2 and Opr3 were introduced separately into pER420 using Gateway® LR Clonase™ recombination reactions (Invitrogen) with pENTR/D-AaDBR2 and pENTR/D-AtOPR3 to give the plasmids pER420-AaDBR2 and pER420-AtOPR3, respectively. Both expression vectors were transferred to the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58C1[pMP90] for transformation of A. thaliana cotyledons using a protocol developed by J.-D. Faure and colleagues. 5J.-D. Faure, personal communication. Transformation was achieved by vacuum infiltration, after which infiltrated cotyledons were left for 4 days in liquid growth medium (Murashige and Skoog medium without sucrose) to allow transient expression of the fusion proteins. GFP localization was examined with a 100M confocal microscope with software package LSM 510 version 3.2 (Zeiss) equipped with a 63× water-corrected objective. Dual GFP fluorescence and chlorophyll autofluorescence was imaged in a multichannel setting with 488- and 543-nm light for GFP and chlorophyll excitation, respectively. Fluorescence emission was captured in the frame-scanning mode alternating GFP fluorescence via a 500–550-nm bandpass filter, and chlorophyll was captured via a 560-nm cut-off filter. Yeast Engineering—The preparation of the plasmids pESC-HIS-FPS-ADS, pESC-LEU-CYP-CPR, and pYESDEST52-AaDBR2 and their use in transformed yeast are described in the supplemental data. Artemisinic Aldehyde Δ11(13) Reductase Activity in A. annua Extracts—The nature of the enzyme involved in the sesquiterpenoid Δ11(13) double bond reduction was initially investigated in extracts of A. annua 2/39 tissues. Preliminary work with flower buds showed reductase activity in the presence of artemisinic aldehyde and NADPH (Fig. 2, D and E). This assay resulted in the detection of a product peak by GC/MS that was identified as (11R)-dihydroartemsinic aldehyde (Fig. 2E) by comparison with natural (Fig. 2A) and semi-synthetic (Fig. 2, B and C) preparations of dihydroartemisinic aldehyde epimers. This peak had a retention time (Fig. 2E) and mass spectrum (supplemental Fig. S4) identical to (11R)-dihydroartemisinic aldehyde synthesized from natural dihydroartemisinic acid (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S4). The retention time was distinct from the (11S)-aldehyde in the mixture formed in the chemical reduction of methyl artemisinate (Fig. 2C). Thus, given the R configuration of artemisinin at C-11, the stereochemistry of the enzyme activity found is consistent with a role in artemisinin biosynthesis. Assay conditions for the reductase reaction were optimized (see “Experimental Procedures” and supplemental data), and extracts from roots, leaves, flower buds, and glandular trichomes were tested. The results for the four tissues are shown in Fig. 3A. Compared with trichome extracts, reductase levels in extracts of flower buds and leaves were at least 10-fold lower. In root extracts, reductase activity was negligible. Given the presence of glandular trichomes on leaf surfaces and at higher densities on floret surfaces, the data from the plant extracts are consistent with a trichome-localized enzyme. Partial Purification and Mass Spectral Analysis of Artemisinic Aldehyde Δ11(13) Reductase from A. annua—With a view toward complete characterization of the reductase, its purification from plant material was attempted. Flower buds were chosen for convenience, in lieu of the more active glandular trichomes. Artemisinic aldehyde Δ11(13) reductase was partially purified from the flower buds of A. annua line 2/39 using fractional ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion exchange and size exclusion chromatography, and dye affinity batch adsorption (see supplemental data for experimental details). This resulted in an ∼100-fold purification on a protein basis relative to the ammonium sulfate precipitate (supplemental Table S1). The size exclusion chromatography indicated that the native molecular weight of artemisinic aldehyde Δ11(13) reductase was ∼44,000 (data not shown). The partially purified enzyme was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (supplemental Fig. S1). The most densely staining bands were excised from a polyacrylamide gel, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. When the resulting data from a band corresponding to ∼44 kDa was used to search a data base of A. annua ESTs, the best match was to a cDNA clone “GSTSUB_026_G01” derived from the A. annua trichome-specific cDNA library called GSTSUB (14Teoh K.H.

The mass spectral data corresponded to the four predicted peptide sequences YFVSNPDLVLR, ELGLQAVAQGDADLVAFGR, ATFYTHDPVVGYTDYPSLDK, and GAYVGTFICCGGYTR. The gene corresponding to this EST was named Dbr2. Analysis of A. annua ESTs (14Teoh K.H. Polichuk D.R. Reed D.W. Nowak G. Covello P.S. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1411-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) indicated the presence of zero, eight, and nine ESTs corresponding to Dbr2 derived from flower bud (AAFB), glandular trichome (AAGST), and “trichome-minus-bud” (GSTSUB) libraries, respectively. This suggested a relatively high expression of Dbr2 in trichomes relative to flower buds. Isolation of a Full-length Dbr2 cDNA from A. annua 2/39—To allow the characterization of the product of Dbr2, a full-length cDNA clone was obtained by SMART™ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (Clontech). The Dbr2 open reading frame is 1331 bp long and encodes a 415-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 45.6 kDa. A BLASTP search of GenBank™ with the predicted amino acid protein sequence of Dbr2 revealed greatest sequence identity with plant 12-oxophytodienoate reductases (OPRs) and related enzymes. 6The sequence data relevant to this article can be found in the GenBank™ database under the following accession numbers: A. thaliana OPR1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_106318), OPR2 (GenBank™ accession number NM_106319) and OPR3 (GenBank™ accession number NM_001084415); A. annua Actin1 (GenBank™ accession number EU531837, submitted by authors), amorpha-4,11-diene synthase (GenBank™ accession number AF138959), A. annua cytochrome P-450 reductase (GenBank™ accession number EF104642), Cyp71av1 (GenBank™ accession number DQ315671), Dbr2 (GenBank™ accession number EU704257; submitted by authors) and Fps (GenBank™ accession number AF136602); H. brasiliensis Opr (GenBank™ accession number AAY27752); S. cerevisiae OYE2 (GenBank™ accession number EDN62417); S. lycopersicum Opr1 (GenBank™ accession number Q9XG54) and Opr3 (GenBank™ accession number Q9FEW9); Z. mays Opr7 (GenBank™ accession number AAY26527) and Opr8 (GenBank™ accession number AAY26528). In particular, Dbr2 showed high amino acid sequence identity to tomato (77%; GenBank™ accession number Q9FEW9) and Arabidopsis (68%; GenBank™ accession number AAG15379) OPR3s, both of which have been shown to reduce the 12-oxophytodienoate isomer involved in jasmonate biosynthesis (23Strassner J.

Fig. 4 illustrates the results of phylogenetic analysis of Dbr2 and a selection of related sequences based on amino acid sequence alignment (supplemental Fig. S2). Dbr2 lies within a branch that includes the tomato and Arabidopsis OPR3s, as well as an OPR3 homologue from Hevea brasiliensis and the maize OPR7 and OPR8 proteins. Based on these sequence comparisons, there is strong support for inclusion of Dbr2 in the α/β barrel fold family of FMN-containing oxidoreductases (24Malone T.E. Madson S.E. Wrobel R.L. Jeon W.B.

This protein family is also known as the enoate reductases. Sequence analysis revealed that Dbr2 contains His, His, and Tyr at positions 180, 183, and 185, respectively (supplemental Fig. S2). The residues are highly conserved in OYEs and OPR-like enzymes and are thought to be involved in catalysis. Conserved amino acids in the substrate binding cavity of OPR3s (27Breithaupt C. Kurzbauer R. Lilie H. Schaller A. Strassner J. Huber R. Macheroux P. Clausen T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 14337-14342Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) were also found in corresponding positions of Dbr2 (His239 and Phe69). However, the amino acids that form a loop near the active site of Arabidopsis OPR3, “AYG” (27Breithaupt C. Kurzbauer R. Lilie H. Schaller A. Strassner J. Huber R. Macheroux P. Clausen T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 14337-14342Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), are occupied by “ADGHG” in Dbr2 (A281-G285; supplemental Fig. S2). The pronounced structural differences in the loops adjacent to the active site are thought to be responsible for the differences in substrate specificity of OPRs and OYE (27Breithaupt C. Kurzbauer R. Lilie H. Schaller A. Strassner J. Huber R. Macheroux P. Clausen T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 14337-14342Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In addition, the carboxyl terminus (Ser-Arg-Leu) that most likely accounts for the peroxisomal location of tomato and Arabidopsis OPR3s (23Strassner J. Schaller F. Frick U.B. Howe G.A. Weiler E.W. Amrhein N. Macheroux P. Schaller A. Plant J. 2002; 32: 585-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 28Olsen L.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 163-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is replaced with Ser-Leu-Leu in the carboxyl terminus of Dbr2. This suggests a different subcellular localization of Dbr2 in A. annua (see below). Recombinant Dbr2 Shows Artemisinic Aldehyde Δ11(13) Reductase Activity—For functional characterization of Dbr2, the recombinant enzyme was purified from Escherichia coli cells harboring the plasmid pDEST17-Dbr2. The sizes of Dbr2 determined from sequence-based prediction, electrophoresis (supplemental Fig. S1), and gel filtration indicate that the enzyme functions as a monomer. The purified Dbr2 protein was assayed with various substrates followed by GC/MS analysis. Similar to plant extracts, purified Dbr2 showed NADPH-dependent formation of (11R)-dihydroartemisinic aldehyde as the major product using artemisinic aldehyde as a substrate (supplemental Fig. S3). Control assays with boiled enzyme preparation (not shown) and in the absence of NADPH did not support the production of dihydroartemisinic aldehyde. Given the similarity of Dbr2 to tomato and Arabidopsis 12-oxophytodienoate reductase 3, Dbr2 was tested for activity with 12-oxophytodienoic acid. No products were found in this assay (data not shown). Dbr2 was also tested with other potential substrates, including arteannuin B, artemisinic acid, artemisinic alcohol, artemisitene, (+)-carvone, coniferyl aldehyde, 2-cyclohexen-1-one, 2E-hexenal, 2E-nonenal, (+)-α-pinene, (+)-pulegone, and sabinone. The results indicate that, in addition to artemisinic aldehyde, Dbr2 has activity on 2-cyclohexen-1-one, (+)-carvone, and low activity on 2E-nonenal (∼12% of the rate for artemisinic aldehyde; supplemental Fig. S3). The GC/MS-derived retention times and mass spectra of the products of artemisinic aldehyde, (+)-carvone, 2-cyclohexen-1-one, and 2E-nonenal matched (11R)-dihydroartemsinic aldehyde, dihydrocarvone, cyclohexanone, and nonanal standards, respectively (supplemental Figs. S3 and S4). Based on comparison with a standard 5:1 mixture of (+)-dihydrocarvone/(+)-isodihydrocarvone and assuming that the configuration at C4 was retained, the major and minor products of (+)-carvone"
https://openalex.org/W2087201425,"Background Extensive evidence from observational studies suggests a role for genital herpes in the HIV epidemic. A number of herpes vaccines are under development and several trials of the efficacy of HSV-2 treatment with acyclovir in reducing HIV acquisition, transmission, and disease progression have just reported their results or will report their results in the next year. The potential impact of these interventions requires a quantitative assessment of the magnitude of the synergy between HIV and HSV-2 at the population level. Methods and Findings A deterministic compartmental model of HIV and HSV-2 dynamics and interactions was constructed. The nature of the epidemiologic synergy was explored qualitatively and quantitatively and compared to other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The results suggest a more substantial role for HSV-2 in fueling HIV spread in sub-Saharan Africa than other STIs. We estimate that in settings of high HSV-2 prevalence, such as Kisumu, Kenya, more than a quarter of incident HIV infections may have been attributed directly to HSV-2. HSV-2 has also contributed considerably to the onward transmission of HIV by increasing the pool of HIV positive persons in the population and may explain one-third of the differential HIV prevalence among the cities of the Four City study. Conversely, we estimate that HIV had only a small net impact on HSV-2 prevalence. Conclusions HSV-2 role as a biological cofactor in HIV acquisition and transmission may have contributed substantially to HIV particularly by facilitating HIV spread among the low-risk population with stable long-term sexual partnerships. This finding suggests that prevention of HSV-2 infection through a prophylactic vaccine may be an effective intervention both in nascent epidemics with high HIV incidence in the high risk groups, and in established epidemics where a large portion of HIV transmission occurs in stable partnerships."
https://openalex.org/W1964939500,"Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), also known as visfatin, is the rate-limiting enzyme in the salvage pathway of NAD biosynthesis from nicotinamide. Since its expression is upregulated during inflammation, NAMPT represents a novel clinical biomarker in acute lung injury, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn's disease. However, its role in disease progression remains unknown. We report here that NAMPT is a key player in inflammatory arthritis. Increased expression of NAMPT was confirmed in mice with collagen-induced arthritis, both in serum and in the arthritic paw. Importantly, a specific competitive inhibitor of NAMPT effectively reduced arthritis severity with comparable activity to etanercept, and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in affected joints. Moreover, NAMPT inhibition reduced intracellular NAD concentration in inflammatory cells and circulating TNFalpha levels during endotoxemia in mice. In vitro pharmacological inhibition of NAMPT reduced the intracellular concentration of NAD and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion by inflammatory cells. Thus, NAMPT links NAD metabolism to inflammatory cytokine secretion by leukocytes, and its inhibition might therefore have therapeutic efficacy in immune-mediated inflammatory disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2088030239,"Myofibroblasts, also known as activated fibroblasts, constitute an important niche for tumor development through the promotion of angiogenesis. However, the mechanism of stromal fibroblast activation in tumor tissues has not been fully understood. A gastric cancer mouse model (Gan mice) was recently constructed by simultaneous activation of prostaglandin (PG) E2 and Wnt signaling in the gastric mucosa. Because both the PGE2 and Wnt pathways play a role in human gastric tumorigenesis, the Gan mouse model therefore recapitulates the molecular etiology of human gastric cancer. Microvessel density increased significantly in Gan mouse tumors. Moreover, the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) was predominantly induced in the stromal cells of gastric tumors. Immunohistochemistry suggested that VEGFA-expressing cells in the stroma were α-smooth muscle actin-positive myofibroblasts. Bone marrow transplantation experiments indicated that a subset of gastric myofibroblasts is derived from bone marrow. Importantly, the α-smooth muscle actin index in cultured fibroblasts increased significantly when stimulated with the conditioned medium of Gan mouse tumor cells, indicating that gastric tumor cells activate stromal fibroblasts. Furthermore, conditioned medium of Gan mouse tumor cells induced VEGFA expression both in embryonic and gastric fibroblasts, which further accelerated the tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro. Notably, stimulation of fibroblasts with PGE2 and/or Wnt1 did not induce VEGFA expression, thus suggesting that factors secondarily induced by PGE2 and Wnt signaling in the tumor cells are responsible for activation of stromal fibroblasts.

Accumulating evidence has indicated that cancer development is regulated by interactions between tumor cells and activated stromal cells (1Tlsty T.D. Coussens L.M. Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2006; 1: 119-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Experiments in mouse models have shown that fibroblasts in the stromal microenvironment play an important role in tumor formation (2Barcellos-Hoff M.H. Ravini S.A.

Grossfeld G.D. Hayward S.W. Carroll P.R. Tlsty T.D. Cunha G.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5002-5011PubMed Google Scholar). Stromal fibroblasts isolated from human breast cancer show distinctive gene expression profiles, although no genetic alteration is found (6Allinen M. Beroukhim R. Cai L. Brennan C. Lahti-Domenici J. Huang H. Porter D. Hu M. Chin L. Richardson A. Schnitt S. Sellers W.R. Polyak K. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 17-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the stromal fibroblasts in tumor tissues possess biological characteristics distinct from those of the normal fibroblasts, which contribute to tumor development. Immunohistochemical studies have shown that a large number of myofibroblasts, which express α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), are present in the stromal component of human breast cancer, intestinal polyps, and gastric cancer (7Sappino A.P. Skalli O. Jackson B. Shurch W. Gabbiani G. Int. J. Cancer. 1988; 41: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 8Adegboyega P.A. Mifflin R.C. DiMari J.F. Saada J.I. Powell D.W. Arch. Pathol.

These myofibroblasts, which are also known as “activated fibroblasts,” therefore contribute to tumor formation. The promotion of angiogenesis is an important function of myofibroblasts during tumorigenesis. Angiogenesis is a key mechanism that supports tumor development by providing nutrients and oxygen (10Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22628) Google Scholar). The CAFs extracted from human breast cancer, which exhibit the traits of myofibroblasts, promote angiogenesis through the expression of stromal cell-derived factor 1 (11Orimo A. Gupta P.B. Sgroi D.C. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Delaunay T. Naeem R. Carey V.J. Richardson A.L. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2005; 121: 335-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar). Moreover, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) stimulates intestinal myofibroblasts to express vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), epidermal growth factor-like growth factor, and amphiregulin, thus leading to the promotion of angiogenesis as well as epithelial proliferation (12Shao J. Sheng G.G. Mifflin R.C. Powell D.W. Sheng H. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 846-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, stromal cell-derived PGE2 plays an important role in angiogenesis in intestinal tumorigenesis through the induction of VEGF and basic fibroblast growth factor (13Sonoshita M. Takaku K. Sasaki N. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Narumiya S. Oshima M. Taketo M.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1048-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 14Seno H. Oshima M. Ishikawa T. Oshima H. Takaku K. Chiba T. Narumiya S. Taketo M.M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 506-511PubMed Google Scholar). Although it has been shown that the conversion of fibroblasts constitutes the major source of myofibroblasts (15Ronnov-Jessen L. Petersen O.W. Koteliansky V.E. Bissell M.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 859-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), the mechanisms underlying stromal activation and promotion of angiogenesis are still not fully understood. It is important to examine the in vivo tumor mouse model to understand the interaction between tumor cells, stromal fibroblasts, and angiogenesis. A gastric cancer mouse model (K19-Wnt1/C2mE mice) was recently established by the transgenic expression of Wnt1, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and microsomal PGE synthase-1 (mPGES-1) in the gastric mucosa (16Oshima H. Matsunaga A. Fujimura T. Tsukamoto T. Taketo M.M. Oshima M. Gastroenterology. 2006; 131: 1086-1095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). COX-2, a rate-limiting enzyme for prostaglandin biosynthesis, is induced in more than 70% of gastric cancer and plays an important role in gastric tumorigenesis (17Saukkonen K. Rintahaka J. Sivula A. Buskens C.J. van Rees B.P. Rio M.C. Haglund C. van Lanschot J.J. Offerhaus G.J. Ristimaki A. APMIS. 2003; 111: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). An inducible PGE2-converting enzyme, mPGES-1, appears to be functionally coupled with COX-2 (18Murakami M. Naraba H. Tanioka T. Semmyo N. Nakatani Y. Kojima F. Ikeda T. Fueki M. Ueno A. Oh-ishi S. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32783-32792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar), and mPGES-1 expression is also induced in gastric cancer, thus suggesting an increased PGE2 level in gastric cancer tissues (19van Rees B.P. Sivula A. Thoren S. Yokozaki H. Jakobsson P.J. Offer-haus G.J. Ristimake A. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 107: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the canonical Wnt signaling is a critical pathway for gastrointestinal tumorigenesis (20Taketo M.M. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7522-7530Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). β-Catenin nuclear localization, a hallmark of Wnt pathway activation, is found in 29% of gastric cancer (21Clements W.M. Wang J. Sarnaik A. Kim O.J. MacDonald J. Fenoglio-Preiser C. Groden J. Lowy A.M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3503-3506PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the activation of the Wnt pathway is one of the major causes for gastric carcinogenesis. Importantly, K19-Wnt1/C2mE mice, in which both the PGE2 and Wnt pathways are activated simultaneously, develop intestinal-type gastric adenocarcinomas (16Oshima H. Matsunaga A. Fujimura T. Tsukamoto T. Taketo M.M. Oshima M. Gastroenterology. 2006; 131: 1086-1095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Therefore, K19-Wnt1/C2mE mice (hereafter Gan mice for Gastric neoplasia) recapitulate a subpopulation of human gastric cancers not only in molecular mechanism but also in tumor pathology. This study examined the epithelial-stromal interaction in tumor angiogenesis using the Gan mouse model. Although it has been established that PGE2 signaling is important for angiogenesis in intestinal tumors (12Shao J. Sheng G.G. Mifflin R.C. Powell D.W. Sheng H. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 846-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 13Sonoshita M. Takaku K. Sasaki N. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Narumiya S. Oshima M. Taketo M.M. Nat.

Cell. 1998; 93: 705-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2216) Google Scholar), the mechanisms underlying the induction of angiogenic factors remain to be elucidated. We show that Gan mouse gastric tumor cells activate stromal fibroblasts to become myofibroblasts, and that these myofibroblasts stimulated by gastric tumor cells express VEGFA and other angiogenic factors, which may lead to the promotion of angiogenesis. Transgenic Mice—The establishment of the K19-C2mE, K19-Wnt1, and Gan mice (K19-Wnt1/C2mE) has been described previously (16Oshima H. Matsunaga A. Fujimura T. Tsukamoto T. Taketo M.M. Oshima M. Gastroenterology. 2006; 131: 1086-1095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 23Oshima H. Oshima M. Inaba K. Taketo M.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1669-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Briefly, COX-2 and mPGES-1 are expressed in the stomach of K19-C2mE mice, whereas Wnt1 is expressed in the stomach of K19-Wnt1 mice. The expression of these genes is regulated by the cytokeratin 19 gene promoter. For the inhibition of COX-2, Gan mice from 28 to 30 weeks of age were injected subcutaneously with 10 mg/kg/day of NS-398 (Sigma) for 3 weeks (n = 3). All animal experiments were carried out according to the protocol approved by the Committee on Animal Experimentation of Kanazawa University. Histology and Immunohistochemistry—Mouse stomach tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned at 4-μm thickness. These sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and processed for immunostaining. To detect capillary vessels, polyclonal anti-von Willebrand factor (vWF) antibody was used (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA) as the primary antibody of immunohistochemistry. To detect VEGFA-expressing cells, monoclonal anti-VEGF antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was used. To detect lymphatic vessels, polyclonal anti-Lyve-1 antibody (Acris Antibodies, Hiddenhausen, Germany) was used. To detect macrophages, rat monoclonal antibody for F4/80 (Serotec, Oxford, UK) was used. To detect myofibroblasts, polyclonal anti-α-smooth muscle actin (Sigma) and monoclonal anti-tenascin-c antibodies (Abcam) were used. To detect smooth muscle cells, anti-calponin-1 monoclonal antibody (Epitomics) was used. To detect GFP, polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (Molecular Probes) was used. The MOM kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was used to minimize the background. Staining signals were then visualized using the Vectorstain Elite kit (Vector Laboratories). For immunofluorescence, Alexa Fluor 594 or Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used as the secondary antibody. Immunocytochemistry—Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and gastric fibroblasts (GFs) grown on coverslips were fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Anti-α-SMA monoclonal antibody (Sigma) was used as the primary antibody, and anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes) was used as the secondary antibody. Next, the coverslips were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) that contained 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for nuclear staining. The number of α-SMA-positive cells was counted using five microscopic fields for each sample, and the mean α-SMA positive index was calculated. Scoring Microvessel Density—Microvessel density (MVD) was scored using histological sections immunostained with anti-vWF antibody. The number of vessels was then counted in high magnification fields (×400) for each group (n = 3). At least five microscopic fields per mouse were scored for each genotype, and then the mean relative MVD to the wild-type MVD was calculated. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from the tissues or cells using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). Epithelial and stromal tissues were isolated from cryosections, respectively, using a laser microdissection (LMD) system (Leica Microsystems, Wetzler, Germany). Extracted RNA was reverse-transcribed and PCR-amplified by GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems). RT-PCR was carried out using the following primer set: VEGFA (F-5′-CTTCCTACAGCACAGCAGATGTGAA-3′; R-5′-TGGTGACATGGTTAATCGGTCTTTC-3′) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (F-5′-TTCCCAGCTGGTCTATGGTC-3′; R-5′-TGGTGCTGACTGCATTTCTC-3′). Specific β-actin primers were used as an internal control. For real time RT-PCR, total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the PrimeScript RT reagent kit (Takara, Japan), and then it was PCR-amplified by ABI Prism 7900HT (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR Premix Ex TaqII (Takara, Japan). The primer sets used in real time RT-PCR to detect VEGFA, HGF, Tie2, and CXCR4 were purchased (Takara, Japan). Bone Marrow Transplantation—Bone marrow cells were isolated from EGFP transgenic mice (24Okabe M. Ikawa M. Kominami K. Nakanishi T. Nishimune Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (2265) Google Scholar). Bone marrow cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline at 1 × 107 cells. The 6-week-old recipient K19-C2mE mice and wild-type mice were irradiated with 8 Gy γ-ray and transplanted with 1 × 106 GFP+ donor cells intravenously. K19-C2mE mice that received a bone marrow transplant were autopsied 20 weeks later. Cell Culture Experiments—MEFs were prepared from 12.5 days post-coitum embryos and cultured with DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection and maintained using the EGM-2 bullet kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland). The primary gastric epithelial cells were prepared as described previously (23Oshima H. Oshima M. Inaba K. Taketo M.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1669-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and cultured on collagen-coated 6-well plates. When the cell density reached 80% confluence, the medium was replaced with DMEM/F-12, and the conditioned medium was collected after a culture of 48 h. For the isolation of GFs, mouse stomach tissues or gastric tumors were digested with collagenase (1 mg/ml at 37 °C for 30 min), washed with DMEM, seeded in collagen-coating dishes, and washed with medium after 30 min to remove epithelial cells. After two rounds of passages, epithelial cells were absent in the culture, and fast growing GFs were enriched. For direct co-culture experiments, gastric epithelial cells and MEFs were mixed at a ratio of 1:1 and plated in 6-well plates. For indirect co-culture experiments, 1 × 105 MEFs or GFs were plated in 48-well plates, and the medium was replaced with mixture of conditioned medium from the primary culture (250 μl) and fresh DMEM (250 μl). At 48 h after stimulation with conditioned medium, medium and cell lysates were collected and used for the following assays. To analyze VEGFA induction by cytokines, MEFs were stimulated with IL-1α, IL-6, IL-17α, GM-CSF (R & D Systems) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α (Calbiochem) at 10 and 100 ng/ml for 24 h, and the VEGFA expression in the medium was examined by ELISA. Cytokine Expression Analysis—Conditioned media obtained from the primary cultured Gan mouse tumor cells and wild-type mouse gastric epithelial cells were used for the expression analysis of cytokines. Expression of IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17α, interferon-γ, TNF-α, granulocyte-CSF, and GM-CSF in each medium was examined using the Multi-Analyte Profiler ELISArray kit (Super Array) according to the manufacturer's protocol. ELISA—The concentration of VEGFA in the culture medium was measured using an ELISA kit (Bio-Source International, Camarillo, CA), and the total protein of cultured cells was measured using a BCA protein detection kit. For the primary culture of epithelial cells, VEGFA concentration was calculated as medium VEGFA (pg) per total protein (mg) of cells or medium volume (ml) because of difficulty in counting the number of cells. For the MEF culture, medium VEGFA (pg) per 105 cells was calculated. HUVEC Tube Formation Assay—HUVECs (5 × 104 cells) were suspended in mixture of conditioned medium (125 μl) and EGM-2 medium (125 μl) in the presence or absence of PGE2 at 1 μm with 0.5% fetal bovine serum, and seeded on 150 μl of Matrigel in 48-well culture plates. After incubation for 18-24 h, photographs of each well were taken, and the number of tubular structures and the length of the tubes in each field were measured using Image J application software (National Institutes of Health). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were carried out by Student's t test, and p values <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Gan mice (K19-Wnt1/C2mE mice) develop gastric adenocarcinomas in the glandular stomach caused by the simultaneous activation of Wnt and PGE2 pathways (16Oshima H. Matsunaga A. Fujimura T. Tsukamoto T. Taketo M.M. Oshima M. Gastroenterology. 2006; 131: 1086-1095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Notably, gastric tumors developed in Gan mice showed hyperemia that was not found in the wild-type mouse stomach (Fig. 1, A and B). Histologically, numerous capillary vessels were detected in the Gan mouse gastric tumors by immunostaining using anti-vWF antibody, whereas vessels were sparsely found in the normal gastric mucosa (Fig. 1, D and E). The MVD in the Gan mouse tumors increased significantly to more than five times that of the wildtype level (Fig. 1I). PGE2 signaling plays an important role in angiogenesis in intestinal tumorigenesis (12Shao J. Sheng G.G. Mifflin R.C. Powell D.W. Sheng H. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 846-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 13Sonoshita M. Takaku K. Sasaki N. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Narumiya S. Oshima M. Taketo M.M. Nat.

The treatment of Gan mice with NS-398, a COX-2 inhibitor, resulted in suppression of hyperemia of gastric tumors (Fig. 1C) caused by a decreased number of capillary vessels in the gastric tumors (Fig. 1, F and I). These results indicate that the activation of COX-2/PGE2 signaling is important for angiogenesis in gastric cancer. On the other hand, the number of capillary vessels and MVD did not increase in the gastric mucosa of K19-C2mE mice or K19-Wnt1 mice (Fig. 1, G-I), which express PGE2 or Wnt1 in the stomach, respectively (16Oshima H.

Taketo M.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1669-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it is possible that the activation of both the PGE2 and Wnt pathways are important for angiogenesis in gastric tumors. However, further experiments demonstrated that secondarily induced factors in the tumor cells are responsible for angiogenesis (see below and see Fig. 4, C and D), although activation of both PGE2 and Wnt pathways is essential for gastrointestinal tumorigenesis (16Oshima H.

Shih J.Y. Yen M.L. Jeng Y.M. Chang C.C. Hsieh C.Y. Wei L.H. Yang P.C. Kuo M.L. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). However, lymphatic vessels were rarely detected in the gastric mucosa of the wild-type, K19-C2mE, and K19-Wnt1 mice as well as Gan mouse gastric tumors (supplemental Fig. 1). In the stomach of these mouse models, lymphatic vessels were predominantly found in the smooth muscle layers. Accordingly, it is conceivable that activation of PGE2 and Wnt signaling does not promote lymphangiogenesis in gastric cancer. Consistent with the results of the MVD analyses, the VEGFA mRNA level determined by real time RT-PCR significantly increased in the Gan mouse gastric tumors in comparison with that in the wild-type, K19-C2mE, or K19-Wnt1 mouse stomach (Fig. 2A). We also examined expression of HGF, Tie2, and CXCR4 by real time RT-PCR, because they have been reported to play a role in angiogenesis (27Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 316-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 28Sato T.N. Tozawa Y. Deutsch U. Wolburg-Buchholz K. Fujiwara Y. Gendron-Maguire M. Gridley T. Wolburg H. Risau W. Qin Y.

Interestingly, the expression of all these genes significantly increased in the Gan mouse tumors in comparison with that in the gastric mucosa of other genotype mice except CXCR4 in K19-C2mE mice (Fig. 2A). The expression of CXCR4 is induced in both K19-C2mE and Gan mice, thus suggesting the PGE2-dependent induction. These results indicate that several angiogenic pathways are activated simultaneously in the gastric tumor tissues, although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be investigated. Next, epithelial cells and stromal cells were isolated from Gan gastric tumor specimens using the LMD system. The expression of VEGFA and HGF was predominantly detected in the stromal cells but not in the epithelial cells (Fig. 2B). Consistently, VEGFA mRNA was at the wild-type level in the primary cultured Gan tumor epithelial cells, in which stromal cells were removed (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that stromal cells are the major source for VEGFA and HGF in gastric tumors. Further analyses focused on the expression of VEGFA because of its significant role in angiogenesis. We confirmed the abundant expression of VEGFA in the stromal cells of Gan mouse gastric tumors by immunostaining (Fig. 2D, asterisks). In contrast, VEGFA-expressing cells were rarely found in the stroma of the wild-type, K19-C2mE, or K19-Wnt1 mouse gastric mucosa. We confirmed the immunostaining specificity by a negative control of nonprimary antibody using a Gan tumor tissue section (Fig. 2D, right). It has been shown that myofibroblasts play a key role in tumor angiogenesis (9Nakayama H. Enzan H. Miyazaki E. Toi M. J. Clin. Pathol. 2002; 55: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 10Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22628) Google Scholar). Therefore, the expression of α-SMA was examined in the Gan mouse tumors, which was a defining characteristic of the myofibroblasts (30Serini G. Gabbiani G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Importantly, a substantial number of α-SMA-positive cells were found in Gan mouse tumor stroma, whereas α-SMA-positive cells were sparsely detected in the nontumorous gastric mucosa (Fig. 3A). Moreover, most α-SMA-positive cells expressed tenascin-c, another marker for myofibroblasts (Fig. 3B, left). In contrast, the majority of α-SMA-positive cells were negative for smooth muscle specific marker calponin-1, although small number of cells expressed both α-SMA and calponin-1 (Fig. 3B, right). These results strongly suggest the major cell type expressing VEGFA in the Gan mouse tumor stroma are myofibroblasts (compare Fig. 2D and Fig. 3A). On the other hand, immunostaining analyses revealed that VEGFA expression was rarely found in the macrophages or capillary vessels in the Gan mouse tumors (Fig. 3C). It has been reported that bone marrow cells contribute to stromal myofibroblasts of tumor tissues (31Direkze N.C. Hodivala-Dilke K. Jeffery R. Hunt T. Poulsom R. Oukrif D. Alison M.R. W"
https://openalex.org/W2130533265,"To counter the global threat caused by Plasmodium falciparum malaria, new drugs and vaccines are urgently needed. However, there are no practical animal models because P. falciparum infects human erythrocytes almost exclusively. Here we describe a reliable falciparum murine model of malaria by generating strains of P. falciparum in vivo that can infect immunodeficient mice engrafted with human erythrocytes. We infected NODscid/β2m−/− mice engrafted with human erythrocytes with P. falciparum obtained from in vitro cultures. After apparent clearance, we obtained isolates of P. falciparum able to grow in peripheral blood of engrafted NODscid/β2m−/− mice. Of the isolates obtained, we expanded in vivo and established the isolate Pf3D70087/N9 as a reference strain for model development. Pf3D70087/N9 caused productive persistent infections in 100% of engrafted mice infected intravenously. The infection caused a relative anemia due to selective elimination of human erythrocytes by a mechanism dependent on parasite density in peripheral blood. Using this model, we implemented and validated a reproducible assay of antimalarial activity useful for drug discovery. Thus, our results demonstrate that P. falciparum contains clones able to grow reproducibly in mice engrafted with human erythrocytes without the use of myeloablative methods."
https://openalex.org/W1990628777,"Three randomised controlled trials have clearly shown that circumcision of adult men reduces the chance that they acquire HIV infection. However, the potential impact of circumcision programmes--either alone or in combination with other established approaches--is not known and no further field trials are planned. We have used a mathematical model, parameterised using existing trial findings, to understand and predict the impact of circumcision programmes at the population level.Our results indicate that circumcision will lead to reductions in incidence for women and uncircumcised men, as well as those circumcised, but that even the most effective intervention is unlikely to completely stem the spread of the virus. Without additional interventions, HIV incidence could eventually be reduced by 25-35%, depending on the level of coverage achieved and whether onward transmission from circumcised men is also reduced. However, circumcision interventions can act synergistically with other types of prevention programmes, and if efforts to change behaviour are increased in parallel with the scale-up of circumcision services, then dramatic reductions in HIV incidence could be achieved. In the long-term, this could lead to reduced AIDS deaths and less need for anti-retroviral therapy. Any increases in risk behaviours following circumcision, i.e. 'risk compensation', could offset some of the potential benefit of the intervention, especially for women, but only very large increases would lead to more infections overall.Circumcision will not be the silver bullet to prevent HIV transmission, but interventions could help to substantially protect men and women from infection, especially in combination with other approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2123317658,"The photosynthetic organelle (plastid) originated via primary endosymbiosis in which a phagotrophic protist captured and harnessed a cyanobacterium. The plastid was inherited by the common ancestor of the red, green (including land plants), and glaucophyte algae (together, the Plantae). Despite the critical importance of primary plastid endosymbiosis, its ancient derivation has left behind very few ""footprints"" of early key events in organelle genesis.To gain insights into this process, we conducted an in-depth phylogenomic analysis of genomic data (nuclear proteins) from 17 Plantae species to identify genes of a surprising provenance in these taxa, Chlamydiae bacteria. Previous studies show that Chlamydiae contributed many genes (at least 21 in one study) to Plantae that primarily have plastid functions and were postulated to have played a fundamental role in organelle evolution. Using our comprehensive approach, we identify at least 55 Chlamydiae-derived genes in algae and plants, of which 67% (37/55) are putatively plastid targeted and at least 3 have mitochondrial functions. The remainder of the proteins does not contain a bioinformatically predicted organelle import signal although one has an N-terminal extension in comparison to the Chlamydiae homolog. Our data suggest that environmental Chlamydiae were significant contributors to early Plantae genomes that extend beyond plastid metabolism. The chlamydial gene distribution and protein tree topologies provide evidence for both endosymbiotic gene transfer and a horizontal gene transfer ratchet driven by recurrent endoparasitism as explanations for gene origin.Our findings paint a more complex picture of gene origin than can easily be explained by endosymbiotic gene transfer from an organelle-like point source. These data significantly extend the genomic impact of Chlamydiae on Plantae and show that about one-half (30/55) of the transferred genes are most closely related to sequences emanating from the genome of the only environmental isolate that is currently available. This strain, Candidatus Protochlamydia amoebophila UWE25 is an endosymbiont of Acanthamoeba and likely represents the type of endoparasite that contributed the genes to Plantae."
https://openalex.org/W2089985991,"Background Adaptive evolutionary episodes in core metabolic proteins are uncommon, and are even more rarely linked to major macroevolutionary shifts. Methodology/Principal Findings We conducted extensive molecular evolutionary analyses on snake mitochondrial proteins and discovered multiple lines of evidence suggesting that the proteins at the core of aerobic metabolism in snakes have undergone remarkably large episodic bursts of adaptive change. We show that snake mitochondrial proteins experienced unprecedented levels of positive selection, coevolution, convergence, and reversion at functionally critical residues. We examined Cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (COI) in detail, and show that it experienced extensive modification of normally conserved residues involved in proton transport and delivery of electrons and oxygen. Thus, adaptive changes likely altered the flow of protons and other aspects of function in CO, thereby influencing fundamental characteristics of aerobic metabolism. We refer to these processes as “evolutionary redesign” because of the magnitude of the episodic bursts and the degree to which they affected core functional residues. Conclusions/Significance The evolutionary redesign of snake COI coincided with adaptive bursts in other mitochondrial proteins and substantial changes in mitochondrial genome structure. It also generally coincided with or preceded major shifts in ecological niche and the evolution of extensive physiological adaptations related to lung reduction, large prey consumption, and venom evolution. The parallel timing of these major evolutionary events suggests that evolutionary redesign of metabolic and mitochondrial function may be related to, or underlie, the extreme changes in physiological and metabolic efficiency, flexibility, and innovation observed in snake evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1977298054,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its high affinity receptor, the tyrosine kinase Met, play a key role in embryo development and tumor invasion. Both HGF and Met are established targets for cancer therapy. However, the mechanism of their interaction is complex and remains elusive. HGF is secreted as a monomeric precursor (pro-HGF) that binds to but does not activate Met. Mature HGF is a alpha/beta heterodimer containing a high affinity Met-binding site in the alpha-chain (HGF-alpha) and a low affinity Met-binding site in the beta-chain (HGF-beta). The extracellular portion of Met contains a semaphorin (Sema) domain, a cysteine-rich hinge (plexin-semaphorin-integrin), and four immunoglobulin-like domains (immunoglobulin-like regions in plexins and transcription factors (IPT) 1-4). HGF-beta binds to Sema through a low affinity contact. The domain of Met responsible for high affinity binding to HGF-alpha has not been identified yet. Here we show that this long sought after binding site lies in the immunoglobulin-like region of Met and more precisely in IPT 3 and 4. We also show that IPT 3 and 4 are sufficient to transmit the signal for kinase activation to the cytoplasm, although the lack of Sema makes the receptor equally sensitive to mature HGF and pro-HGF. Finally, we provide evidence that soluble Met-derived proteins containing either the low affinity or high affinity HGF-binding site antagonize HGF-induced invasive growth both in vitro and in xenografts. These data suggest that the immunoglobulin-like region of Met cooperates with the Sema domain in binding to HGF and in controlling Met kinase activity. Although the IPT-HGF-alpha interaction provides binding strength, the Sema-HGF-beta contact confers selective sensitivity to the active form of the ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1987904612,"Estrogen is an established enhancer of breast cancer development, but less is known on its effect on local progression or metastasis. We studied the effect of estrogen receptor recruitment on actin cytoskeleton remodeling and breast cancer cell movement and invasion. Moreover, we characterized the signaling steps through which these actions are enacted.In estrogen receptor (ER) positive T47-D breast cancer cells ER activation with 17beta-estradiol induces rapid and dynamic actin cytoskeleton remodeling with the formation of specialized cell membrane structures like ruffles and pseudopodia. These effects depend on the rapid recruitment of the actin-binding protein moesin. Moesin activation by estradiol depends on the interaction of ER alpha with the G protein G alpha(13), which results in the recruitment of the small GTPase RhoA and in the subsequent activation of its downstream effector Rho-associated kinase-2 (ROCK-2). ROCK-2 is responsible for moesin phosphorylation. The G alpha(13)/RhoA/ROCK/moesin cascade is necessary for the cytoskeletal remodeling and for the enhancement of breast cancer cell horizontal migration and invasion of three-dimensional matrices induced by estrogen. In addition, human samples of normal breast tissue, fibroadenomas and invasive ductal carcinomas show that the expression of wild-type moesin as well as of its active form is deranged in cancers, with increased protein amounts and a loss of association with the cell membrane.These results provide an original mechanism through which estrogen can facilitate breast cancer local and distant progression, identifying the extra-nuclear G alpha(13)/RhoA/ROCK/moesin signaling cascade as a target of ER alpha in breast cancer cells. This information helps to understand the effects of estrogen on breast cancer metastasis and may provide new targets for therapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2045547564,"Background Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) core member Ring1b/Rnf2, with ubiquitin E3 ligase activity towards histone H2A at lysine 119, is essential for early embryogenesis. To obtain more insight into the role of Ring1b in early development, we studied its function in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated the effects of Ring1b ablation on transcriptional regulation using Ring1b conditional knockout ES cells and large-scale gene expression analysis. The absence of Ring1b results in aberrant expression of key developmental genes and deregulation of specific differentiation-related pathways, including TGFbeta signaling, cell cycle regulation and cellular communication. Moreover, ES cell markers, including Zfp42/Rex-1 and Sox2, are downregulated. Importantly, retained expression of ES cell regulators Oct4, Nanog and alkaline phosphatase indicates that Ring1b-deficient ES cells retain important ES cell specific characteristics. Comparative analysis of our expression profiling data with previously published global binding studies shows that the genes that are bound by Ring1b in ES cells have bivalent histone marks, i.e. both active H3K4me3 and repressive H3K27me3, or the active H3K4me3 histone mark alone and are associated with CpG-‘rich’ promoters. However, deletion of Ring1b results in deregulation, mainly derepression, of only a subset of these genes, suggesting that additional silencing mechanisms are involved in repression of the other Ring1b bound genes in ES cells. Conclusions Ring1b is essential to stably maintain an undifferentiated state of mouse ES cells by repressing genes with important roles during differentiation and development. These genes are characterized by high CpG content promoters and bivalent histone marks or the active H3K4me3 histone mark alone."

The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of these 'adherence support workers' (ASWs) in adherence counseling, treatment retention and addressing inadequate human resources at health facilities.The study used quantitative and qualitative research techniques at five selected ART sites in four provinces in Zambia. Five hundred patients on ART were interviewed using a structured questionnaire to compare the quality of adherence counseling before and after the ASW scheme was introduced at the selected sites and between ASWs and HCWs after the introduction of ASWs. In addition, 3,903 and 4,972 electronic records of all new patients accessing antiretroviral therapy for the time period of 12 months before and 12 months after the introduction of ASWs respectively, were analyzed to assess loss to follow-up rates. Two focus group discussions with ASWs and health care workers (HCWs) were conducted in each clinic. Key informant interviews in the ART clinics were also conducted. There was a marked shift of workload from HCWs to ASWs without any compromise in the quality of counseling. Quality of adherence counseling by ASWs was comparable to HCWs after their introduction. The findings suggest that the deployment of ASWs helped reduce waiting times for adherence counseling. Loss to follow-up rates of new clients declined from 15% to 0% after the deployment of ASWs.Adherence counseling tasks can be shifted to lay cadres like ASWs without compromising the quality of counseling. Follow-up of clients by ASWs within the community is necessary to improve retention of clients on ART."
https://openalex.org/W2019316370,"All-trans-retinoic acid stimulates dendritic growth in hippocampal neurons within minutes by activating mitogen-activated protein kinase and mTOR and increasing dendritic translation of calcium calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha and the alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate receptor subunit GluR1. Hippocampal neurons express RARalpha in dendrites, and knocking down RARalpha prevents all-trans-retinoic acid effects on dendritic growth. Here we show, by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis of immunoaffinity isolates of hippocampal neurons, that RARalpha partners with many RNA-binding proteins and translation factors conveyed in dendritic RNA transport granules, including the purine-rich element-binding protein, Pur alpha. The interaction of RARalpha with Pur alpha, an RNA-binding protein required for dendritic RNA transport, and other RNA-binding proteins was confirmed by tandem affinity purification. Confocal microscopy confirmed localization of neuronal RARalpha in dendritic RNA granules with Pur alpha and FMRP (the fragile x mental retardation protein). Hippocampal RARalpha also associates with mRNA, e.g. encoding GluR1 and calcium calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha. Consistent with a granule function of conveying translationally silenced mRNA, RARalpha inhibits translation initiation, independent of 7-methylguanylate cap or poly(A) tail, and prompts mRNA redistribution to silencing ribonucleoprotein particles. These data afford a mechanism for rapid stimulation of dendritic growth by all-trans-retinoic acid and reveal that the ligand-dependent transcription factor RARalpha also regulates translation."

In contrast to the use of oxygen-sensitive NaHTe or H(2)Te as Te source in the current synthetic methods, we employ more stable sodium tellurite as the Te source for preparing highly luminescent CdTe nanocrystals in aqueous solution. By selecting mercaptosuccinic acid (MSA) as capping agent and providing the borate-citrate acid buffering solution, CdTe nanocrystals with high quantum yield (QY >70% at pH range 5.0-8.0) can be conveniently prepared by this method. The influence of parameters such as the pH value of the precursor solution and the molar ratio of Cd(2+) to Na(2)TeO(3) on the QY of CdTe nanocrystals was systematically investigated in our experiments. Under optimal conditions, the QY of CdTe nanocrystals is even high up to 83%. The biological application of luminescent MSA-CdTe to HEK 293 cell imaging was also illustrated."
https://openalex.org/W2004669910,"Background Regulatory T cell (Treg) based immunotherapy is a potential treatment for several immune disorders. By now, this approach proved successful in preclinical animal transplantation and auto-immunity models. In these models the success of Treg based immunotherapy crucially depends on the antigen-specificity of the infused Treg population. For the human setting, information is lacking on how to generate Treg with direct antigen-specificity ex vivo to be used for immunotherapy. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we demonstrate that in as little as two stimulation cycles with HLA mismatched allogeneic stimulator cells and T cell growth factors a very high degree of alloantigen-specificity was reached in magnetic bead isolated human CD4posCD25high Treg. Efficient increases in cell numbers were obtained. Primary allogeneic stimulation appeared a prerequisite in the generation of alloantigen-specific Treg, while secondary allogeneic or polyclonal stimulation with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies enriched alloantigen-specificity and cell yield to a similar extent. Conclusions/Significance The ex vivo expansion protocol that we describe will very likely increase the success of clinical Treg-based immunotherapy, and will help to induce tolerance to selected antigens, while minimizing general immune suppression. This approach is of particular interest for recipients of HLA mismatched transplants."
https://openalex.org/W2152058126,"Exposure to dioxins, including 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), causes a wide array of toxicities in vertebrates, which are mostly considered to be mediated through the inappropriate activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling pathway. Although transcriptional regulation by AHR is widely studied, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the adverse outcomes after AHR activation are largely unknown. To identify the important downstream events of AHR activation, we employed the zebrafish caudal fin regeneration model, where AHR activation blocks the regenerative process. Comparative toxicogenomic analysis revealed that both adult and larval fins respond to TCDD during regeneration with misexpression of Wnt signaling pathway members and Wnt target genes. R-Spondin1, a novel ligand for the Wnt coreceptor, was highly induced, and we hypothesized that misexpression of R-Spondin1 is necessary for AHR activation to block regeneration. Partial antisense repression of R-Spondin1 reversed the inhibitory effect of TCDD, and tissue regeneration was restored. This finding demonstrates that inhibition of regeneration by TCDD is mediated by misinduction of R-Spondin1. Because R-Spondin1 signals through the Wnt coreceptor LRP6, we further demonstrated that the TCDD-mediated block in regeneration is also LRP6 dependent. Collectively, these results indicate that inappropriate regulation of R-Spondin/LRP6 is absolutely required for TCDD to inhibit fin regeneration."

This paper describes a soft-lithographic method to encapsulate cells in 3D gel objects (modules) in a variety of simple shapes (cylinders, crosses, rectangular prisms) with lateral dimensions between 40 and 1000 μm, cell densities of 105 – 108 cells/cm3, and total volumes between 1×10−7 and 8×10−4 cm3. By varying (i) the initial density of cells at seeding, and (ii) the dimensions of the modules, the number of cells per module ranged from 1 to 2500 cells. Modules were formed from a range of standard biopolymers, including collagen, Matrigel™, and agarose, without the complex equipment often used in encapsulation. The small dimensions of the modules allowed rapid transport of nutrients by diffusion to cells at any location in the module, and therefore allowed generation of modules with cell densities near to those of dense tissues (108 – 109 cells/cm3). This modular method is based on soft lithography and requires little special equipment; the method is therefore accessible, flexible, and well suited to (i) understanding the behavior of cells in 3D environments at high densities of cells, as in dense tissues, and (ii) developing applications in tissue engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2017321408,"F-box proteins are the substrate-recognition components of the Skp1-Cul1-F box protein (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligases. Here we report a structural relationship between Fbxo7, a component of the SCFFbxo7 E3 ligase, and the proteasome inhibitor PI31. SCFFbxo7 is known to catalyze the ubiquitination of hepatoma-up-regulated protein (HURP) and the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) protein but also functions as an activator of cyclin D-Cdk6 complexes. We identify PI31 as an Fbxo7·Skp1 binding partner and show that this interaction requires an N-terminal domain present in both proteins that we term the FP (Fbxo7/PI31) domain. The crystal structure of the PI31 FP domain reveals a novel α/β-fold. Biophysical and mutational analyses are used to map regions of the PI31 FP domain mediating homodimerization and required for heterodimerization with Fbxo7·Skp1. Equivalent mutations in Fbxo7 ablate interaction with PI31 and also block Fbxo7 homodimerization. Knockdown of Fbxo7 does not affect PI31 levels arguing against PI31 being a substrate for SCFFbxo7.

All known SCF E3 ligases bind an E2 (ubiquitin carrier protein) enzyme through a RING finger-containing subunit (Rbx1) and utilize their F-box subunit to recruit substrates. Although classified by the presence of an F-box (Fbx) motif (7Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K. Ma L. Goebl M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J.

Schubert H.L. Hill C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). The C terminus of Fbxo7 contains a proline-rich region (PRR) but lacks any predicted secondary structure. HURP (hepatoma up-regulated protein) and cIAP1 (an inhibitor of apoptosis protein) have both been reported as substrates for SCFFbxo7-mediated ubiquitination leading to proteasome-mediated degradation (17Hsu J.M.

Fbxo7 also acts as an assembly factor for cyclin D-Cdk6 complexes by virtue of its interaction with D-type cyclins and Cdk6 (13Laman H. Funes J.M. Ye H. Henderson S. Galinanes-Garcia L. Hara E. Knowles P. McDonald N. Boshoff C. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3104-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this study a combination of structural, biochemical, and genetic approaches were used to identify and characterize regions of Fbxo7 involved in protein interaction as a means to identify putative substrates of SCFFbxo7. Unexpectedly we uncovered a structural link between a domain from Fbxo7 and a related domain from PI31, a regulatory subunit of the immunoproteasome which is an in vitro inhibitor of the 20 S proteasome (19Chu-Ping M. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1119: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 20Zaiss D.M. Standera S. Holzhutter H. Kloetzel P.M. Sijts A.J.

A. 2002; 99: 14344-14349Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of this domain from PI31 revealed a novel α/β-fold and two distinct intermolecular contact surfaces. We used this structure to guide the design of site-specific substitutions to probe surfaces of the FP domain from PI31 responsible for homodimerization and for heterodimeric interaction with Fbxo7. We discuss a possible role for FP domain-mediated dimerization for SCFFbxo7 and PI31 function. Protein Expression and Purification—A bicistronic expression vector was constructed to prepare recombinant GST-tagged Fbxo7·Skp1 complexes for affinity purification. For all experiments the Skp1 cDNA encompassed residues 1-146 and lacked the C-terminal H8 helix as previously described (23Schulman B.A. Carrano A.C. Jeffrey P.D. Bowen Z. Kinnucan E.R. Finnin M.S. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Pagano M. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Human Fbxo7 (residues 129-398) (Swiss-Prot Q9Y3I1)-Skp1 (residues 1-146) (Swiss-Prot P63208), and Fbxo7 (residues 169-398)-Skp1 (residues 1-146) constructs were produced as follows. The FBXO7 gene was cloned into pGEX(KG) (24Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). The SKP1 gene was amplified by PCR from a human cDNA library using a 5′ primer which contained a ribosome binding site and then subcloned into BlueScript (Stratagene). The RBS-SKP1 insert was then subcloned into pGEX(KG)-Fbxo7. For all experiments the Skp1 encompassed residues 1-146 (Skp1ΔH8), which lacks the C-terminal H8 helix aiding expression and solubility (23Schulman B.A. Carrano A.C. Jeffrey P.D. Bowen Z. Kinnucan E.R. Finnin M.S. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Pagano M. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Fbxo7(169-398)-Skp1ΔH8 (V253E) mutant was produced using the QuikChange system (Stratagene). Residues 1-151 of human PI31 (Swiss-Prot Q92530) were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pET28a expression plasmid (Novagen). Mutant PI31 constructs (L7M, V6R, and I83E/I90E) and mutant Fbxo7 constructs (V253E and V175E) were produced using the QuikChange system (Stratagene). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The expression plasmids described above were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3), and cultures were grown in Luria broth at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6. Recombinant protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 250 μm for 3 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm benzimidine, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Proteins were purified from the soluble fraction using either glutathione-Sepharose (Fbxo7·Skp1) or nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity beads (PI31) by batch purification and cleaved from the beads with thrombin at 4 °C. PI31 and Fbxo7·Skp1 proteins were then purified by size exclusion chromatography using Superdex 75 and Superdex 200 columns, respectively. Columns were equilibrated and run in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 8, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Selenomethionine was incorporated by transforming the expression plasmid into the E. coli methionine auxotroph strain B834(DE3) grown on minimal medium supplemented by selenium methionine using standard procedures. Selenomethionine-labeled protein and mutants were prepared using a similar procedure to the native protein as described above. Crystallization and Data Collection—The PI31 FP domain was crystallized by vapor diffusion in sitting drops containing 2 μl of protein (8 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and 2 μl of well solution (20% polyethylene glycol 3350 and 0.1 m ammonium iodide) at room temperature. Crystals grew within 1 week to roughly 0.2 mm. Selenomethionine-substituted wild type FP domain and L7M mutant protein crystallized under the same conditions as the native protein. Data were collected for crystals of human PI31 FP domain, selenomethionine-substituted FP domain, and the selenomethionine-substituted L7M mutant (Table 1). In each case a single crystal was flash-cooled to 100 K in a nitrogen gas stream using 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol as a cryoprotectant. The CCP4 suite of programs (25Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination—Initial attempts to solve the structure using selenomethionine single wavelength anomalous diffraction data were unsuccessful due to the centrosymetric arrangement of the two selenium sites from two methionines in native PI31 FP domain (data not shown). A third methionine site was engineered by an L7M mutation leading to crystals of selenomethionyl-labeled protein, and subsequently datasets were collected at the selenium peak wavelength (Table 1, datasets 2 and 3). The selenium substructure from dataset 2 was found by SHELXD/E and used to calculate SAD phases with a contrast of 0.403 and connectivity of 0.877 (incorrect hand had a contrast of 0.314 and connectivity of 0.845). Phases were improved by 2-fold non-crystallographic averaging within dataset 2 (initial FOM 0.45, final FOM 0.64) using DM (28Cowtan K. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) and cross-crystal averaging with dataset 3 (Table 1, datasets 2 and 3) and density modification using RESOLVE (29Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). To obtain the native PI31 FP domain structure free of introduced mutations, a partial model was built into this map and was subsequently positioned by molecular replacement into the native unit cell (dataset 1). Refinement against this native dataset collected in house produced the final model (Table 1, dataset 1). The final model lacks 9 residues from the C termini of both copies (chain A and B) and residue Ser-75 in chain A. Residues in loop 72-76 and 96-98 are relatively mobile as reflected in high temperature factors and poor electron density. Chain A and B are essentially identical (root mean square deviation of 0.419 Å over 141 Cα residues). Four of the cysteine residues in each chain appear to have undergone partial oxidation and have been modeled as sulfenic acids. Coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank data base with accession code 2VT8. Isothermal Calorimetry—Isothermal calorimetry experiments used a MicroCal VP-ITC according to manufacturer's instructions. All proteins analyzed by isothermal calorimetry (ITC) were purified by size exclusion chromatography and dialyzed into the same buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) before measurement of their molar concentration. The Fbxo7·Skp1 concentration within the sample cell was 20 μm, and the PI31 titrant concentration was 100 μm. The experiments were carried out at 30 °C with 28 injections each of 10 μl measured with stirring, and all settings were constant for both wild type and mutant experiments. Results were analyzed using the ORIGIN7 software provided by MicroCal and using a one-binding-site model. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—For analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) experiments, recombinant proteins were stored and analyzed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. A Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge was used to measure both absorbance and interference data according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein parameters used for data analysis and the calculation of initial experimental parameters were calculated using the program SEDNTERP (30Cole J.L. Lary J.W. Moody P. Laue T.M. Methods Cell Biol. 2008; 84: 143-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed using the AUC machine software and the programs SEDFIT and SEDPHAT (31Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar) using the model monomer-dimer equilibrium in the final analysis. Yeast Two-hybrid Screens—Fbxo7 129-522 and 129-398 were subcloned into pGBDU-C1 and co-transformed with library plasmid (Clontech) into PJ69-4a yeast two-hybrid strain (32James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Human osteosarcoma (U2OS) and Jurkat E6 cell lines were obtained from Cancer Research UK (LRI Cell Production). U2OS cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, whereas Jurkat E6 cells were grown in RPMI media. Both media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Helena Biosciences), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. U2OS cells were seeded the day before transfection using FuGENE (catalog #1814443, Roche Applied Science). To visualize the subcellular localization of Fbxo7, cells were transfected with a construct encoding a fusion of dsRED with full-length Fbxo7. 24 h post-transfection, live cells were visualized by confocal microscopy. For immunofluorescence assays on PI31, cells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X, and blocked with 5% fetal bovine serum before incubation with primary antibody against PI31 (1:200) and secondary rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:500). The fluorescent dye 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6(3Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar)) (Invitrogen) was included in the final wash to permit visualization of the endoplasmic reticulum by confocal microscopy. For co-immunofluorescence assays, cells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed in 70% ethanol, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X, and blocked with 0.1% gelatin before staining with affinity-purified Fbxo7 polyclonal antibody (1:40) and PI31 monoclonal antibody (1:10). Secondary antibodies sheep anti-rabbit conjugated to AlexaFluor 488 (Molecular Probes) and goat anti-mouse conjugated to Cy5 (DAKO) were both used at 1:300. Coverslips were mounted with Vectashield (Vector) mounting media containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Cells were visualized by epifluorescence microscopy. Fractionation, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—U2OS cells were fractionated by resuspending in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm MgCl2, and adding 40 μg/ml digitonin and incubating on ice for 10 min to lyse plasma membrane. Nuclei were separated from cytoplasmic fraction by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, protease inhibitor mixture). For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and protease inhibitor mixture for 10 min on ice before the addition of NaCl to a final concentration of 150 mm. Lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 rpm and then immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG-M2-agarose slurry for 3 h at 4 °C ona rotating wheel. Agarose beads were then washed 4 times with NET2 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Triton X-100) before being resuspended in 4× Laemmli buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The following antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation or Western blotting: Cdk6 (SC177) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), FLAG (F3165, Sigma), and T7 (catalog #69522-3, Novagen). The antibody against Fbxo7 has been previously described (13Laman H. Funes J.M. Ye H. Henderson S. Galinanes-Garcia L. Hara E. Knowles P. McDonald N. Boshoff C. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3104-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody raised against the FP domain of PI31 was made by Monoclonal Antibody Service, Cancer Research UK. Anti-rabbit IgG and anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. and Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Mapping Protein Interaction Sites within Fbxo7 and Identification of PI31 as an Fbxo7 Binding Partner—To map regions within Fbxo7 responsible for mediating its in vivo interactions with known protein partners, we prepared several deletion constructs based on predicted domain boundaries of Fbxo7 and incorporated an N-terminal T7 epitope. These included constructs lacking the N-terminal Ubl domain, the F-box motif, or the C-terminal PRR (Fig. 1A). We first sought to map the binding site for Cdk6, a validated binding partner for Fbxo7 (13Laman H. Funes J.M. Ye H. Henderson S. Galinanes-Garcia L. Hara E. Knowles P. McDonald N. Boshoff C. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3104-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cdk6 was efficiently co-immunoprecipitated by full-length Fbxo7-(1-522) and by a mutant of Fbxo7 lacking the F-box domain (ΔF-box) indicating that the interaction did not require the F-box (Fig. 1, A and B). We next deleted the first 129 amino acids of Fbxo7 which includes the Ubl domain, designated as Fbxo7-(129-522). However, by SDS-PAGE, this mutant co-migrated with IgG heavy chain (molecular mass, 50 kDa), making it unusable in our co-immunoprecipitation assays. Fbxo7-(129-398) (lacking both the Ubl domain and the PRR region) was also able to co-immunoprecipitate Cdk6 in vivo (Fig. 1, A and B), showing neither region was essential for binding. Because Fbxo7-(129-398) was predicted to have an unstructured sequence of 40 amino acids at the N terminus (129-169), we therefore, truncated the construct further to produce Fbxo7-(169-398). This protein was now unable to bind Cdk6 (Fig. 1B), indicating that within the context of Fbxo7-(129-398), amino acids 129-169 were necessary to bind Cdk6. We then made further deletions from the N terminus including Fbxo7-(239-522), which surprisingly, was able to bind Cdk6 despite the absence of residues 129-169. This indicated another region within 239-522 could mediate Cdk6 interaction. This region contains the F-box domain and the PRR sequence. We deleted the unstructured C terminus of Fbxo7, creating Fbxo7-(239-381) and also attempted to express the C terminus, Fbxo7-(419-522), but this protein could not be produced (Fig. 1, A and B). Fbxo7-(239-381) did not interact with Cdk6, suggesting that the sequences from 381-522, which includes the PRR, previously proposed to mediate substrate recognition for HURP and c-IAP, could also contribute to Cdk6 interaction (17Hsu J.M.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 342: 1022-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that two regions from Fbxo7 can independently bind to Cdk6, suggesting Fbxo7 has a bipartite Cdk6 binding site. By mapping the binding site of a known Fbxo7-interacting partner to domains within Fbxo7, we validated the use of this panel of Fbxo7-truncated constructs to search for new protein partners of Fbxo7 and, thus, for SCFFbxo7. Closer examination of Fbxo7 sequence conservation and predicted secondary structure identified a putative globular domain (residues 180-324) that precedes the F-box and follows the Ubl and the N-terminal Cdk6 binding sequence. We also identified a highly conserved R(Ar)DP motif (where Ar indicates any aromatic amino acid) within residues 466-496 of the PRR, with an as yet undetermined function. To investigate whether residues 180-324 could function as a protein interaction module and to identify putative partner proteins, we prepared GST-tagged recombinant Fbxo7-(129-398)·Skp1 complexes for ex vivo affinity pulldown experiments from Jurkat cell lysates as described under “Experimental Procedures” (33Schneider U. Schwenk H.U. Bornkamm G. Int. J. Cancer. 1977; 19: 621-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Skp1 was co-expressed to engage the F-box motif and was used as a positive control to demonstrate proper folding of Fbxo7 (Fig. 1C). After incubation of recombinant GST-Fbxo7-(129-398)·Skp1 immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads with the Jurkat cell lysate, the beads were washed and treated with thrombin to release Fbxo7-(129-398)·Skp1. Co-eluting proteins were then identified by mass spectrometry. Using this approach we identified PI31 (proteasome inhibitor 31kDa) as co-eluting with Fbxo7·Skp1 (Fig. 1C) but not from a GST control elution. In addition, the known Skp1-binding protein Cullin1 and endogenous Skp1 also co-eluted with Fbxo7·Skp1. The latter was present as excess recombinant Fbxo7 was present in the protein preparations. In parallel to the affinity pulldown experiments, we undertook yeast two-hybrid screens of a human cDNA library using Fbxo7-(129-398) and Fbxo7-(129-522) as bait (Fig. 1D). In both screens more than 60% of the library plasmids that were isolated had PI31 fused with Gal4 activation domain (GAD), whereas 7% of the clones contained Skp1. Assaying for activation of the HIS3 and ADE2 reporter genes tested the specificity of the pGAD-PI31 interaction with the pGBD-Fbxo7 bait plasmid. Yeast co-transformed with Fbxo7 plasmid and pGAD-PI31 grew on media lacking histidine and adenine. However, yeast transformed with either plasmid alone or a different bait plasmid encoding a viral cyclin fused to GBD together with pGAD-PI31 failed to grow under the same conditions (Fig. 1D). Taken together, the results from these independent screens and affinity pulldown experiments indicate that PI31 can interact with Fbxo7 and is a previously uncharacterized binding partner for Fbxo7. Fbxo7 and PI31 Are Structurally Related—After the identification of PI31 as a putative Fbxo7 binding partner, we analyzed sequences of Fbxo7 and PI31 and noticed that these proteins are related at both a sequence and structural level despite their involvement in quite different multiprotein complexes. Both contain a domain equivalent to residues 180-324 of Fbx"

The molecular weights of the monomers of the two enzymes are quite similar, and PuuA exists as a dodecamer as does GS. Moreover the two amino acid residues of E. coli GS that are important for the metal-catalyzed oxidation of the enzyme molecule involved in protein turnover are conserved in PuuA, and it was experimentally shown that the corresponding amino acid residues in PuuA were involved in the metal-catalyzed oxidation similarly to GS. It is suggested that the intracellular concentration of putrescine is optimized by PuuA transcriptionally and posttranslationally and that excess putrescine is converted to a nutrient source by the Puu pathway.

Compounds that have a γ-glutamyl linkage are called γ-glutamyl compounds, which are widely found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. For example, the peptidoglycan of Escherichia coli has a γ-glutamyl linkage between d-glutamate and meso-2,6-diaminopimelic acid (1Park, J. T. (1996) in Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology (Neidhardt, F. C., Curtiss, R., III, Ingraham, J. L., Lin, E. C. C., Low, K. B., Magasanik, B., Reznikoff, W.

Minami H. Miyakawa N. Ishihara S. Kumagai H. Appl. Environ.

(1989) Coenzymes and Cofactors, pp. 475–516, Wiley-Interscience, New YorkGoogle Scholar) in living cells.Putrescine is one of the polyamines that are found in a wide range of organisms from bacteria to plants and animals; are critical for cell proliferation, differentiation, and transformation; and are involved in DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis as well as in stabilizing membrane and cytoskeletal structures (5Tabor C.W.

An increased concentration of polyamine is observed in cancer cells (7Linsalata M. Caruso M.G. Leo S. Guerra V. D'Attoma B. Di Leo A. Anticancer Res. 2002; 22: 2465-2469PubMed Google Scholar), there is a significantly elevated concentration (more than millimolar) of putrescine in plants under various stress conditions, and its concentration is very high (estimated to be over 30 mm) in E. coli cells (8Igarashi K.

In this metabolic pathway, which we named the Puu pathway (Fig. 2), putrescine is first γ-glutamylated to γ-Glu-Put 4The abbreviations used are: γ-Glu-Put, γ-glutamylputrescine; GS, glutamine synthetase; GABA, γ-aminobutyrate; γ-Glu-GABA, γ-glutamyl-γ-aminobutyrate; RT, reverse transcription; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; Put, putrescine. 4The abbreviations used are: γ-Glu-Put, γ-glutamylputrescine; GS, glutamine synthetase; GABA, γ-aminobutyrate; γ-Glu-GABA, γ-glutamyl-γ-aminobutyrate; RT, reverse transcription; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; Put, putrescine. by PuuA (glutamate-putrescine ligase, γ-Glu-Put synthetase, EC 6.3.1.11). Secondly γ-Glu-Put is oxidized to γ-Glu-γ-butyraldehyde by PuuB (γ-Glu-Put oxidase) and further oxidized to γ-glutamyl-γ-aminobutyrate (γ-Glu-GABA) by PuuC (γ-Glu-γ-butyraldehyde dehydrogenase). Then γ-Glu-GABA is hydrolyzed to glutamate and GABA by PuuD (γ-Glu-GABA hydrolase) (10Kurihara S. Oda S. Kumagai H. Suzuki H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2006; 256: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and then GABA is deaminated to succinic semialdehyde by PuuE (GABA:α-ketoglutarate aminotransferase). PuuA catalyzes the first reaction of this Puu pathway as shown below (Scheme 1). Glutamate+Putrescine+ATP→γ-Glutamylputrescine +H2O+ADP+PiScheme 1 Putrescine has been reported to be degraded without γ-glutamylation (11Shaibe E. Metzer E. Halpern Y.S. J.

Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 938-942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is non-enzymatically cyclized to Δ1-pyrroline (Fig. 2). γ-Glutamylation is thought to stabilize the intermediate, inhibiting the spontaneous cyclization reaction of γ-aminobutyraldehyde to Δ1-pyrroline (9Kurihara S.

Glutamate+Ammonia +ATP→Glutamine+H2O+ADP +PiScheme 2 Schemes 1 and 2 are very similar because both reactions are γ-glutamylation, the condensing reaction yielding an amide linkage between the γ-carboxyl group of glutamate and the amino group of putrescine or ammonia using ATP.In this study, we report that PuuA is an important enzyme that catalyzes the first step of the Puu pathway and is regulated by a complicated regulation system. We also discuss the similarities between GS and PuuA.MATERIALS AND METHODSStrain and Plasmid ConstructionThe strains, plasmids, and oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Table 1. The strains were derivatives of E. coli K-12. Strain SH639 (15Suzuki H. Kumagai H. Echigo T. Tochikura T. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5169-5172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has a deletion of the ggt gene. P1 transduction, DNA manipulation, and transformation were performed by the standard methods (16Miller, J. H. (1992) A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Bacteria, pp. 263–274 and 437, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar, 17Sambrook, J., and Russell, D. W. (2001) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed., pp. 1.1–2.110, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar). A DNA fragment of Kohara clone 257 (18Kohara Y. Akiyama K. Isono K. Cell. 1987; 50: 495-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar) containing the puu gene cluster was used to make plasmids. The cloned regions of DNA on plasmids and the deleted regions of DNA are summarized in Fig. 1. In strain SK212, disruption of the puuR gene was carried out as follows. The 4.5-kb EcoRV-EcoRV fragment, including puuADR, was isolated from Kohara phage 257 and cloned between the XmnI site and the blunt-ended ScaI site of pACYC184 to obtain pKHG3. The 220-bp region between EcoRI and XmnI sites was replaced with the 1.2-kb HincII kanamycin resistance cassette of pUC4K. The plasmid was linearized using SalI. Homologous recombination was performed using this linearized plasmid to delete residues 65–137 of a putative 185-residue PuuR protein (Fig. 1). In SK310, the puuA gene was disrupted according to the method of Datsenko and Wanner (19Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10979) Google Scholar) using oligonucleotides puuA-1 and puuA-2. This strain deleted the predicted ATP binding motif of PuuA (Figs. 1 and 8). In SO58, disruptions of puuADR and puuCBE were performed by the modified method of Datsenko and Wanner (19Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10979) Google Scholar) as follows. To disrupt puuCBE, the DNA fragment of Kohara clone 257 (18Kohara Y. Akiyama K. Isono K. Cell. 1987; 50: 495-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar), containing the puuCBE gene region, was digested with NarI and HincII and cloned into pUC19 digested with NarI and HincII to obtain pSK169. The FRT-kan+-FRT fragment was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides pKD13-1 and pKD13-4 as primers and plasmid pKD13 as a template with KOD-plus DNA polymerase (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). The PCR product was ligated with the 3.9-kb DraIII (blunt-ended with a Blunting kit (Takara, Kyoto, Japan)) and EcoRV fragment of pSK169, which deleted all of the puuB and most of the puuC and puuE genes (Fig. 2). The obtained plasmid was cleaved with HindIII and AatII, and the 3.0-kb fragment was used to transform TK251 by electroporation at 30 °C. Kanamycin-resistant transformant SK231 was obtained. To disrupt puuADR, the FRT-cat+-FRT fragment was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides pKD13-1 and pKD3-2 as primers and plasmid pKD3 as a template with KOD-plus DNA polymerase. The PCR product was ligated with the 4.7-kb XmnI and HpaI fragment of pKHG3, which deleted all of the puuAD and most of the puuR genes. The obtained plasmid was cleaved with SacII and NruI, and the 2.8-kb fragment was used to transform SK231 by electroporation. Chloramphenicol-resistant transformant SO56 was obtained. Then SO58 was made by P1 transduction of the ΔpuuADR::(FRT-cat+-FRT) ΔpuuCBE::(FRT-kan+-FRT) alleles from SO56 to SH639. To construct pKHG8, a 2.0-kbp SmaI and HpaI fragment of pKHG3 was ligated with pBR322 digested with EcoRV and NruI. pSO105, which carries puuAH282N, was constructed with the QuikChange technique (Stratagene) using oligonucleotides puuA-3 and puuA-4 as primers and pSO97 as a template but using KOD-plus DNA polymerase (Toyobo). pSK324, which carries puuAR357Q, was similarly constructed using oligonucleotides puuA-5 and puuA-6.TABLE 1Strains, plasmids, and oligonucleotides used in this studyStrain, plasmid, or oligonucleotideCharacteristic or sequenceSource or Ref.Strain KP7600W3110 but F- lacIq lacZΔM15 galK2 galT22 lambda- in (rrnD-rrnE)1T.

In growth experiments in carbon- and nitrogen-limited medium, strains were precultured on an LB plate at 37 °C, streaked on a nutrient-limited plate, and incubated at 20 °C. To overexpress mutagenized PuuA, strains were grown in 60 ml of LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C with shaking at 140 rpm in a 300-ml Erlenmeyer flask. To overexpress native PuuA for protein purification, strains were grown in 200 ml of LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C with shaking at 140 rpm in a 1-liter Erlenmeyer flask. γ-Glu-Put was enzymatically synthesized and purified as described previously (9Kurihara S.

The running program for the HPLC system using the Shim-pack Amino-Na column was described previously (9Kurihara S. Oda S. Kato K. Kim H.G. Koyanagi T. Kumagai H. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4602-4608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In the analysis using TSKgel Polyaminepak, two buffers, buffer A (18.6 mm trisodium citrate dehydrate, 400 mm sodium chloride, 20.8 mm HCl, 4% methanol, 0.0016% octanoic acid, 0.0156% Brij-35) and buffer B (93 mm trisodium citrate dehydrate, 2 m sodium chloride, 104 mm HCl, 20% methanol, 0.008% octanoic acid, 0.078% Brij-35), were used. The column was originally equilibrated with buffer A. After the sample was injected, the concentration of buffer B was kept at 0% for 5 min. Then it was increased to 100% and maintained until 30 min. Then the column was regenerated by 0.2 n NaOH from 30 to 35 min. After the regeneration step, the column was equilibrated again by buffer A from 35 to 45 min. o-Phthalaldehyde was used as the detection reagent (21Benson J.R. Hare P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar) as described previously (3Suzuki H. Izuka S. Minami H. Miyakawa N. Ishihara S. Kumagai H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 6399-6404Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and fluorescence was detected with a fluorescence detector (model RF-10AXL; Shimadzu) at an absorbance of 470 nm with excitation at 340 nm. Standard compounds were purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan) and Sigma-Aldrich except γ-Glu-Put, which was synthesized as described previously (9Kurihara S. Oda S. Kato K. Kim H.G. Koyanagi T. Kumagai H. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4602-4608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In our HPLC system equipped with the Polyaminepak, γ-Glu-Put, putrescine, cadaverine, and spermidine were eluted at 10.5, 17.5, 22.3, and 28.1 min, respectively. In the preparation of whole-cell samples, 1mlof A600 = 1 culture was centrifuged, and the pellet was washed with 1 ml of M9-glucose minimal medium (16Miller, J. H. (1992) A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Bacteria, pp. 263–274 and 437, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar). The washed pellet was resuspended in 0.2 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid (v/v; Nacalai Tesque) and boiled in a boiling water bath for 15 min to break the cell. The suspension was centrifuged, the supernatant was applied to HPLC after filtration using Millex-LH (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and the precipitated protein was dissolved in 1 ml of 0.1 n NaOH. The protein concentration of the solution was measured by the Lowry method (22Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the polyamine concentration of the cell was calculated as nmol/mg of protein.Assays for PuuA ActivityHPLC Method—γ-Glu-Put synthetase activity was determined by measuring the decrease of glutamate. A reaction mixture containing 10 mm monosodium glutamate, 10 mm putrescine dihydrochloride, 7.5 mm ATP, 30 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm imidazole-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) was incubated at 37 °C. After stopping the reaction by adding trichloroacetic acid (final concentration, 10%), the decreased glutamate by PuuA was quantitated by HPLC.Coupled Enzymatic Method—Another simple procedure used to determine the Km value of PuuA was based on the method described previously (23Kingdon H.S. Hubbard J.S. Stadtman E.R. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 2136-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture containing 100 mm imidazole-HCl buffer (pH 9.0), 10 mm monosodium glutamate, 100 mm putrescine dihydrochloride, 7.5 mm ATP, 25 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.14 mm NADH, 5 units/ml pyruvate kinase (Oriental Yeast, Tokyo, Japan), 12.6 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase (Oriental Yeast), and 1 μg/ml PuuA was incubated at 25 °C. The change in absorbance at 340 nm due to oxidation of NADH was followed using a UV-visible spectrometer (model UV-1600PC; Shimadzu).Purification of PuuAPuuA was purified from a cell-free extract prepared from a 200-ml culture of SO97 by 0–40% ammonium sulfate precipitation and column chromatography using a HiTrap Blue column (column volume, 5 ml; GE Healthcare). During purification, the protein was basically dissolved in buffer C (20 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mm MnCl2). After ammonium sulfate fractionation, the enzyme was dissolved in buffer C and dialyzed against the same buffer. The dialyzed enzyme solution was applied to a HiTrap Blue column equilibrated previously with buffer C. PuuA was eluted with a linear gradient formed between buffer C and 20 mm ATP in buffer C. PuuA was eluted when the concentration of ATP was 8.5–11 mm. The purified PuuA appeared as a single band on the SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 3). This purification is summarized in Table 2. One unit of PuuA was defined as the amount of enzyme required to expend 1 μmol of glutamate/min under the condition of the PuuA assay using the HPLC described under “Assays for PuuA Activity.” Protein concentration was measured by the Lowry method (22Lowry O.H.

One microgram of total RNA was treated with DNase I (final concentration, 0.1 units/μl; amplification grade; Invitrogen). After adding EDTA (final concentration, 2.27 mm) to inactivate DNase I, cDNA was synthesized by an iScript cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) from 1 μg of starting total RNA primed with the random primers included in the kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Tth RNase H (final concentration, 0.52 units/μl; Toyobo) was added to the reaction mixture to remove RNA. puuA-specific primers, puuA-RT1 and puuART2, were designed to amplify 95-nucleotide fragments using Primer3 software. The real time PCR mixture (brought to a final volume of 10 μl with deionized water) contained 5 μl of iQTM SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), 3 pmol of each of the two primers, and a 2-μl cDNA sample in a 96-well optical reaction plate mounted in a DNA Engine Opticon Continuous Fluorescence Detection System (Bio-Rad). The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 15 min and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 20 s. To ensure the absence of nonspecific PCR products, melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis were performed after each run. The number of transcripts in a sample was determined by comparing the number of cycles (C) required for the reaction to reach a common threshold (t) with a plot of Ct values against the standard pKHG8. The relative expression levels of puuA compared with controls were calculated using Opticon (Bio-Rad). The relative amount of transcripts between samples was further standardized by amplification of the gapA gene as an internal control usi"
https://openalex.org/W2039277025,"Background Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common cause of cancer-related death in Western countries. Developing more effective NSCLC therapeutics will require the elucidation of the genetic and biochemical bases for this disease. Bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs) are a putative cancer stem cell population in mouse models of oncogenic K-ras-induced lung adenocarcinoma, an histologic subtype of NSCLC. The signals activated by oncogenic K-ras that mediate BASC expansion have not been fully defined. Methodology/Principal Findings We used genetic and pharmacologic approaches to modulate the activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), a key mediator of oncogenic K-ras, in two genetic mouse models of lung adenocarcinoma. Oncogenic K-ras-induced BASC accumulation and tumor growth were blocked by treatment with a small molecule PI3K inhibitor and enhanced by inactivation of phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome 10, a negative regulator of PI3K. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that PI3K is a critical regulator of BASC expansion, supporting treatment strategies to target PI3K in NSCLC patients."
https://openalex.org/W2022388411,"Human DNA topoisomerase I plays a dual role in transcription, by controlling DNA supercoiling and by acting as a specific kinase for the SR-protein family of splicing factors. The two activities are mutually exclusive, but the identity of the molecular switch is unknown. Here we identify poly(ADP-ribose) as a physiological regulator of the two topoisomerase I functions. We found that, in the presence of both DNA and the alternative splicing factor/splicing factor 2 (ASF/SF2, a prototypical SR-protein), poly(ADP-ribose) affected topoisomerase I substrate selection and gradually shifted enzyme activity from protein phosphorylation to DNA cleavage. A likely mechanistic explanation was offered by the discovery that poly(ADP-ribose) forms a high affinity complex with ASF/SF2 thereby leaving topoisomerase I available for directing its action onto DNA. We identified two functionally important domains, RRM1 and RS, as specific poly(ADP-ribose) binding targets. Two independent lines of evidence emphasize the potential biological relevance of our findings: (i) in HeLa nuclear extracts, ASF/SF2, but not histone, phosphorylation was inhibited by poly(ADP-ribose); (ii) an in silico study based on gene expression profiling data revealed an increased incidence of alternative splicing within a subset of inflammatory response genes that are dysregulated in cells lacking a functional poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1.

Wang J.C. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1060-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 2Khobta A. Ferri F. Lotito L. Montecucco A. Rossi R. Capranico G. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Its best known function is to control the topological state of DNA by relieving torsional stress that is generated following DNA strand separation during transcription, replication, and repair (3Wang J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar, 4Leppard J.B. Champoux J.J. Chromosoma. 2005; 114: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 5Pommier Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 789-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar). The catalytic mechanism involves the formation of a DNA·topo I complex (cleavage complex) with the enzyme being covalently bound to the 3′-end of the cleaved DNA strand through a tyrosine-phosphate ester bond. Cleavage complexes are usually short-lived; their stabilization by compounds of the camptothecin (CPT) family of anticancer drugs may cause DNA strand break accumulation and eventually lead to cell death. Human topo I can relax both negative and positive supercoils by controlled rotation of the DNA strand downstream of the cleavage site followed by break resealing and restoration of an intact DNA duplex. In addition to relaxing supercoiled DNA, human topo I also plays a major role in pre-mRNA splicing, being endowed with a protein kinase activity targeted at a group of splicing factors of the serine-arginine (SR)-rich protein family (6Rossi F. Labourier E. Forné T. Divita G. Derancourt J. Riou J.F. Antoine E. Cathala G. Brunel C. Tazi J. Nature. 1996; 381: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). SR-proteins function both as components of the basal RNA splicing machinery and as regulators of alternative splicing (7Graveley B.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 8Sanford J.R. Ellis J. Caceres J.F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Moreover, SR-proteins are involved in the control of mRNA transport and stability (8Sanford J.R. Ellis J. Caceres J.F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 9Huang Y. Steitz J.A. Mol.

Cell. 2005; 122: 365-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). SR-proteins are structurally characterized by having one or two domains that include a RNA recognition motif (RRM) at the N terminus, and an SR-rich C-terminal domain (RS domain) containing a variable number of SR dipeptidic repeats. Phosphorylation at serine residues in such sequences regulates SR-protein functions as well as their subnuclear localization (7Graveley B.R. RNA (N.

Besides topo I, other kinases are also involved in SR-protein phosphorylation; these include the SR-protein-specific kinases 1 and 2 (SRPK1 and SRPK2) and the cell cycle-dependent dual specificity kinase Clk/Sty (13Colwill K. Feng L.L. Yeakley J.M. Gish G.D. Caceres J.F. Pawson T. Fu X.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24569-24575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Moreover, Akt/protein kinase B phosphorylation of SR-protein family members appears to play a critical role in signal transduction pathways linking extracellular stimuli (hormones and mitogens) to changes in gene expression via regulation of alternative splicing and mRNA translation (14Patel N.A. Kaneko S. Apostolatos H.S. Bae S.S. Watson J.E. Davidowitz K. Chappell D.S. Birnbaum M.J. Cheng J.Q. Cooper D.R. J. Biol.

Depletion of topo I results in the hypophosphorylation of SR-proteins and impaired exonic enhancer-dependent splicing (16Soret J. Gabut M. Dupon C. Kohlhagen G. Stévenin J. Pommier Y. Tazi J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8203-8211PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, inhibition of topo I-dependent SR-protein phosphorylation by indolocarbazole antitumor drugs has been shown to interfere with the spliceosome assembly pathway, leading to altered gene expression and eventually to cell death (17Pilch B. Allemand E. Facompre M. Bailly C. Riou J.F. Soret J. Tazi J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6876-6884PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, human topo I may either bind DNA and catalyze its relaxation or bind SR-proteins and ATP and play the role of a kinase. The two activities are mutually exclusive, and they are most likely the functional expression of distinct conformational states (18Chen H.J. Hwang J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). What regulates such structural and functional transitions is unknown. Human topo I is a member of the poly-(ADP-ribose)-binding family of proteins (19Pleschke J. Kleczkowska H. Strohm M. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40974-40980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) is the product of a class of enzymes known as PAR polymerases (PARPs) (20Amé J.C. Spenlehauer C. de Murcia G. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 882-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar). PARPs utilize NAD+ as a source of ADP-ribose units and catalyze the covalent modification of a number of proteins (heteromodification), including themselves (automodification), with an array of linear or branched ADP-ribose chains of variable lengths; these polymers are then degraded by a specific PAR glycohydrolase, thus making the reaction reversible (20Amé J.C. Spenlehauer C. de Murcia G. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 882-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar, 21Burkle A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 4576-4589Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). PARP-1 and PARP-2, the best known members of the PARP family, depend on DNA strand breaks for activity and are responsible for most PAR synthesized in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells both under physiological and DNA damage conditions (20Amé J.C. Spenlehauer C. de Murcia G. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 882-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar, 21Burkle A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 4576-4589Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Protein targeting by PARP-bound polymers via non-covalent, yet specific interactions, is emerging as an important regulatory mechanism for diverse biological functions, including transcription, DNA damage signaling and checkpoint activation, proteasomal histone degradation, and mitotic spindle formation (22Malanga M. Althaus F.R. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 83: 354-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 23Schreiber V. Dantzer F. Amé J.C. de Murcia G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). topo I bears three PAR-binding sites localized in domains that are critical for the catalytic activity of the enzyme on DNA and for its regulation (24Malanga M. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5244-5248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In fact, PAR has a dual effect on topo I: it inhibits DNA cleavage (thus preventing initiation of new catalytic cycles) while it stimulates the re-ligation activity of the enzyme blocked in a ternary complex with nicked DNA and CPT (thus counteracting the poisoning effect of the drug) (24Malanga M. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5244-5248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In this study we addressed the question of whether PAR could also affect topo I kinase activity and/or act as a molecular switch of distinct topo I functions. ASF/SF2, a prototype of the SR-protein family, was used as a specific substrate for the topo I kinase activity. Purified human topo I was obtained from TopoGen. This enzyme undergoes spontaneous conversion into a 70-kDa form lacking the N-terminal domain (ΔN-topo I). Full-length His-tagged human topo I expressed in a baculovirus system was from Jena Bioscience (distributed by Alexis). topo I homogeneity was >95%. GST-SRPK1 was from Upstate. Highly purified recombinant PARP-1 and PARP-2 were purchased from Alexis. Protein-free, affinity-purified [14C]PAR, [32P]PAR, and 32P-5′-end-labeled ds-oligonucleotide, used as a topo I substrate in DNA cleavage assays, were prepared as previously described (24Malanga M. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5244-5248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). All experiments were repeated at least three times and confirmed with different preparations of topo I, SR-proteins, PAR. Recombinant Proteins—Human topo I was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae EKY3 strain and purified essentially as described by Kowalska-Loth et al. (25Kowalska-Loth B. Girstun A. Piekielko A. Staron K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3504-3510Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, the expression of topo I was induced with 2% galactose. After 4 h, cells were harvested, washed once with SED buffer (1 m sorbitol, 25 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 50 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and treated with 5 mg/ml zymolyase 100T (Seikagaku) for 30 min at 30 °C. Spheroplasts were pelleted by centrifugation and extracted twice with YLS buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Yeast extracts were adjusted to buffer B conditions (0.35 m NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), loaded onto a heparin-agarose column (Bio-Rad), and eluted by increasing salt concentration. topo I-containing fractions were pooled and loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen) for further purification. Finally, purified topo I was concentrated on Biomax-5K columns (Millipore). His-tagged SF2 was expressed in Escherichia coli TG1 strain and purified as described by Rossi et al. (6Rossi F. Labourier E. Forné T. Divita G. Derancourt J. Riou J.F. Antoine E. Cathala G. Brunel C. Tazi J. Nature. 1996; 381: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). GST-tagged SF2 and SF2 fragments (GST-ASF/SF21–119, GST-ASF/SF2120–194, and GST-ASF/SF2195–248) were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE) (Novagen) and purified on glutathione-agarose (Sigma) as previously described (25Kowalska-Loth B. Girstun A. Piekielko A. Staron K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3504-3510Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). GST-ASF/SF2195–248 was subjected to further purification on a heparin-agarose column after dilution in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Elution was carried out in the same buffer with increasing NaCl concentrations (0.1–1 m). Purified polypeptides were concentrated on Biomax-5K columns (Millipore), and buffer was exchanged to 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 75 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. topo I Activity Assays—topo I DNA cleavage activity was assayed using a 32P-5′-end-labeled ds-oligonucleotide containing a single topo I binding/cleavage site, as previously reported (24Malanga M. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5244-5248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (15 μl) were assembled on ice and contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.01% Triton X-100, 20 μm CPT, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2% glycerol, human topo I (0.2–0.27 pmol). Reaction was started by addition of 32P-5′-end-labeled ds-oligonucleotide (0.02–0.04 pmol, 0.5–1.1 × 106 dpm/pmol) and carried on for 10–20 min at 37 °C. After termination by addition of concentrated Laemmli buffer, cleavage complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. When present, affinity-purified PAR or ASF/SF2 were added to the reaction mixture at the amounts indicated in the figures. topo I kinase activity was assayed in the same buffer as indicated above in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2 and 1 μm γ-[32P]ATP (0.3 × 106 dpm/pmol), in a final volume of 15 μl. 0.2 pmol of yeast-expressed human recombinant topo I and 0.7–2.8 pmol of recombinant His-ASF/SF2 were used in each assay. After incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, reaction was stopped by adding concentrated Laemmli buffer; ASF/SF2 phosphorylation was visualized by autoradiography, after electrophoretic separation on 10% polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE). ASF/SF2 phosphorylation by SRPK1 was assayed under the same conditions using 0.05 pmol of the recombinant kinase. Double DNA Cleavage/Protein Phosphorylation Assay—Recombinant human topo I (0.2 pmol) and recombinant His-ASF/SF-2 (2.8 pmol) were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.01% Triton X-100, 20 μm CPT, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2% glycerol, 32P-5′-end-labeled ds-oligonucleotide (0.034 pmol, 0.5–1.1 × 106 dpm/pmol), γ-[32P]ATP (1.5 pmol, 0.3 × 106 dpm/pmol). Reaction mixtures were assembled on ice and transferred into a pre-warmed water bath immediately after γ-[32P]ATP addition. Reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE onto 4–15% polyacrylamide gradient gels, followed by autoradiography. When present, affinity-purified PAR was added to the reaction mixture at the amounts indicated in the figures. PAR Binding Assay—The PAR binding assay was carried on essentially as described by Panzeter et al. (26Panzeter P.L. Zweifel B. Malanga M. Waser S.H. Richard M. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17662-17664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were immobilized on nitrocellulose either by Western blotting after electrophoretic separation on polyacrylamide gels, or by slot blotting. Duplicate samples were either gold/Coomassie Blue stained for protein visualization or probed with [32P]PAR, washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.4 (TBST), and analyzed by autoradiography. Where indicated, 0.5 m NaCl was added to the washing buffer (0.5 m NaCl-TBST). Protein Extracts—HeLa S3 cells were cultured in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium under standard culturing conditions and harvested at a subconfluent stage to be used for nuclear and cytoplasmic protein extract preparations, as previously described (27Blenn C. Althaus F.R. Malanga M. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 419-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). ASF/SF2 or histone phosphorylation by endogenous kinase(s) was assayed in the conditions described by Rossi et al. (6Rossi F. Labourier E. Forné T. Divita G. Derancourt J. Riou J.F. Antoine E. Cathala G. Brunel C. Tazi J. Nature. 1996; 381: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) using 0.5 μl of extract (1 μg of protein), in the presence or absence of PAR. Phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Quantitative Analyses—Autoradiographic bands were quantified by scanning densitometry using the GS-710 Bio-Rad densitometer and the image analysis software QuantityOne (BioRad). Data are expressed as mean of at least three independent experiments ± S.D. Bioinformatics—Peer-reviewed literature was surveyed for comparative genome-wide studies of the transcriptomes of parp-1 knock-out mammalian cells and their wild-type counterparts, both under physiological conditions and after exposure to cytotoxic stimuli. Then, gene expression profiling data were matched against the Alternative Splicing Annotation Project II data base (28Kim N. Alekseyenko A.V. Roy M. Lee C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: D93-D98Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Only genes coding for at least one expressed alternatively spliced isoform were taken as positive and expressed as the percentage of total analyzed genes. topo I Protein Kinase Activity Is Inhibited by PAR—In a reconstituted system consisting of PAR, topo I, and an oligonucleotide substrate, we first demonstrated that site-specific DNA cleavage by either yeast- or baculovirus-expressed recombinant human topo I is inhibited by PAR in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A), as previously reported by us for topo I purified from human placenta (24Malanga M. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5244-5248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This inhibition is accompanied by the formation of a PAR·topo I complex (24Malanga M. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5244-5248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar); degradation of PAR to monomeric ADP-ribose abolished the inhibition (Fig. 1C). To investigate whether PAR had any influence on topo I kinase activity, we performed an ASF/SF2 phosphorylation assay in the presence or absence of the polymer. topo I kinase targets the C-terminal RS domain of ASF/SF2 (29Labourier E. Rossi F. Gallouzi I.E. Allemand E. Divita G. Tazi J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2955-2962Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). His-tagged ASF/SF2, expressed in bacteria and purified by metal ion affinity chromatography, was used in this study. The recombinant protein migrated as a doublet in SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 2C); the shorter form is generated by proteolysis at the C terminus of the protein, which does not affect the capacity of the protein to be phosphorylated by SR-protein-specific kinases (29Labourier E. Rossi F. Gallouzi I.E. Allemand E. Divita G. Tazi J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2955-2962Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Recombinant ASF/SF2 was phosphorylated by both topo I and the SR-protein kinase SRPK1 (Fig. 2, A and B). However, when PAR was present in the kinase assay reaction mixture, topo I-catalyzed ASF/SF2 phosphorylation was dramatically reduced (Fig. 2, B and E); the extent of inhibition was dependent on PAR concentration (Fig. 2, B and E). Thus, PAR appears to function as a negative regulator not only of the DNA cleavage (Fig. 1A) but also of the protein phosphorylation activity of topo I (Fig. 2, B and E). Neither PARP-1 nor PARP-2 in their native state affected topo I-catalyzed ASF/SF2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, the polymer at severalfold higher concentrations than that inhibitory on topo I had only modest consequences on ASF/SF2 phosphorylation by SRPK1 (Fig. 2, A and E), thus pointing at a topo I-specific PAR effect. Noteworthy, although both topo I and SRPK1 phosphorylate serine residues in the RS-domain of ASF/SF2, the reaction catalyzed by topo I has different specificity and kinetics from that of SRPK1 (29Labourier E.

ASF/SF2 phosphorylation by either SRPK1 (0.05 pmol, A) or topo I (0.2 pmol, B) was assayed in the absence or presence of increasing amounts of PAR; alternatively, 0.18 pmol of native PARP-1 or 0.3 pmol of PARP-2 was added together with topo I and ASF/SF2 into the kinase assay mixture (D). Phosphorylated ASF/SF2 was visualized by autoradiography following SDS-PAGE (A, B, and D). Duplicate gels were stained with Coomassie Blue for protein visualization (C). Autoradiographic bands were quantified by scanning densitometry and data were expressed as percentage of enzyme activity in the absence of PAR (E); data from at least three independent experiments (mean ± S.D.) are shown.

Commun. 2005; 331: 398-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1B inhibition of topo I activity was achieved at an approximate topo I:ASF/SF2 molar ratio of 1:10. Because both PAR and ASF/SF2 are negative regulators of topo I-catalyzed DNA cleavage (Fig. 1), and ASF/SF2 phosphorylation is inhibited by PAR as well (Fig. 2), would PAR and ASF/SF2 together cause a complete silencing of topo I functions? To address this question, we set up an in vitro assay that allows simultaneous detection of topo I·DNA cleavage complex and phosphorylated ASF/SF2. Surprisingly, we observed a full restoration of topo I-catalyzed DNA cleavage while the inhibitory effect of PAR on topo I-dependent ASF/SF2 phosphorylation persisted (Fig. 3A). Reversal of topo I activity on DNA in the presence of both PAR and ASF/SF2 was clearly dependent on PAR concentration (Fig. 3A, right panel) and also occurred in the absence of ATP (Fig. 3B, left panel). It is noteworthy that cleavage complex formation by a N-terminally truncated form of topo I (ΔN-topo I, 70 kDa), which maintained full proficiency to relax DNA but had dramatically reduced protein kinase activity, was also inhibited by either PAR or ASF/SF2 individually (Fig. 3B, right panel). This is in agreement with our previous identification of PAR binding sites outside of the N-terminal domain of topo I (24Malanga M. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5244-5248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Like full-length topo I, cleavage complex formation by ΔN-topo I was also restored in the presence of both PAR and ASF/SF2 (Fig. 3B, right panel). ASF/SF2 Is a Novel Member of the PAR-binding Protein Family—We next hypothesized that PAR could bind to ASF/SF2 and that the formation of a stable PAR·ASF/SF2 complex might prevent either of the two interaction partners from binding topo I; as a consequence, topo I would be able to express its DNA cleavage activity. PAR binding was assessed using recombinant ASF/SF2, either His-tagged or as a fusion protein with GST. To identify the specific domain(s) potentially involved in polymer binding, we constructed ASF/SF2 deletion mutants, each comprising only one of the ASF/SF2 functional domains (RRM1/RRM2/RS) (Fig. 4A). PAR binding assays revealed that ASF/SF2 does indeed bind PAR (Fig. 4, C and D). We identified the RRM1 and RS domains as potential targets of such interaction, whereas the RRM2 domain did not appear to possess any PAR binding activity (Fig. 4, C and D). Identical results were obtained both when proteins were first separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto nitrocellulose by Western blotting (Fig. 4, B and D) and when native proteins where immobilized on the membrane by slot-blotting (Fig. 4C), before being probed with radioactive PAR. Importantly, ASF/SF2·PAR binding appeared to be considerably stronger than topo I-PAR interactions: nearly 90% topo I binding to PAR was destroyed by 0.5 m NaCl; in contrast, most ASF/SF2·PAR complexes resisted high salt treatment (Fig. 5A).FIGURE 5PAR binds to ASF/SF2 with higher affinity than to topo I. A, effect of high salt treatment on the stability of PAR-protein complexes. Recombinant proteins (5 pmol) were immobilized on nitrocellulose by slot blotting and either Gold stained (inset a) or incubated with [32P]PAR, followed by washes with either TBST or 0.5 m NaCl-TBST (insets b and c, respectively). PAR·protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography (insets b and c), and band intensities were quantified by scanning densitometry. Data are expressed as percentage of controls (no salt treatment) and represent mean values ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments.

https://openalex.org/W1967435033,"RecQ helicases are essential for the maintenance of genome stability. Five members of the RecQ family have been found in humans, including RECQ1, RECQ5, BLM, WRN, and RECQ4; the last three are associated with human diseases. At this time, only BLM and WRN helicases have been extensively characterized, and the information on the other RecQ helicases has only started to emerge. Our current paper is focused on the biochemical properties of human RECQ1 helicase. Recent cellular studies have shown that RECQ1 may participate in DNA repair and homologous recombination, but the exact mechanisms of how RECQ1 performs its cellular functions remain largely unknown. Whereas RECQ1 possesses poor helicase activity, we found here that the enzyme efficiently promotes DNA branch migration. Further analysis revealed that RECQ1 catalyzes unidirectional three-stranded branch migration with a 3' --> 5' polarity. We show that this RECQ1 activity is instrumental in specific disruption of joint molecules (D-loops) formed by a 5' single-stranded DNA invading strand, which may represent dead end intermediates of homologous recombination in vivo. The newly found enzymatic properties of the RECQ1 helicase may have important implications for the function of RECQ1 in maintenance of genomic stability."
https://openalex.org/W2066103999,"Models of the mammalian jaw have predicted that bite force is intimately linked to jaw gape and to tooth position. Despite widespread use, few empirical studies have provided evidence to validate these models in non-human mammals and none have considered the influence of gape angle on the distribution of stress. Here using a multi-property finite element (FE) model of Canis lupus dingo, we examined the influence of gape angle and bite point on both bite force and cranial stress. Bite force data in relation to jaw gape and along the tooth row, are in broad agreement with previously reported results. However stress data showed that the skull of C. l. dingo is mechanically suited to withstand stresses at wide gapes; a result that agreed well with previously held views regarding carnivoran evolution. Stress data, combined with bite force information, suggested that there is an optimal bite angle of between 25° and 35° in C. l. dingo. The function of these rather small bite angles remains unclear."
https://openalex.org/W2047900333,"Germline-stem cells (GSCs) produce gametes and are thus true ""immortal stem cells"". In Drosophila ovaries, GSCs divide asymmetrically to produce daughter GSCs and cystoblasts, and the latter differentiate into germline cysts. Here we show that the histone-lysine methyltransferase dSETDB1, located in pericentric heterochromatin, catalyzes H3-K9 trimethylation in GSCs and their immediate descendants. As germline cysts differentiate into egg chambers, the dSETDB1 function is gradually taken over by another H3-K9-specific methyltransferase, SU(VAR)3-9. Loss-of-function mutations in dsetdb1 or Su(var)3-9 abolish both H3K9me3 and heterochromatin protein-1 (HP1) signals from the anterior germarium and the developing egg chambers, respectively, and cause localization of H3K9me3 away from DNA-dense regions in most posterior germarium cells. These results indicate that dSETDB1 and SU(VAR)3-9 act together with distinct roles during oogenesis, with dsetdb1 being of particular importance due to its GSC-specific function and more severe mutant phenotype."

The sex ratio at birth can be used to examine the influence of antenatal sex selection on the sex ratio.Records from 321,991 deliveries at one hospital over 11 decades were utilized. The middle year in each decade was taken as representative of the decade. Data from 33,524 deliveries were then analyzed. Data for each decade was combined with that of previous decades and compared to the data of subsequent decades to look for any change in the trend. Sex ratio in the second children against sex of the first child was studied separately.The mean sex ratio for the 110 years examined was 910 girls to 1000 boys (95% CI; 891 to 930). The sex ratio dropped significantly from 935 (CI: 905 to 967) before 1979, to 892 (CI: 868 to 918) after 1980 (P = 0.04). The sex ratio in the second child was significantly lower if the first child was a girl [716 (CI: 672 to 762] (P<0.001). On the other hand, there was an excess of girls born to mothers whose first child was boy [1140 girls per 1000 boys (CI: 1072 to 1212 P<0.001)].The sex ratio fell significantly after 1980 when ultra sound machines for antenatal sex determination became available. The sex ratio in second children if the first was a girl was even lower. Sex selective abortions after antenatal sex determination are thus implicated. However data on second children especially the excess of girls born to mothers who have a previous boy seen in the decade before the advent of antenatal ultra sound machines, suggests that other means of sex selection are also used."
https://openalex.org/W2162391881,"The target of rapamycin (Tor) protein plays central roles in cell growth. Rapamycin inhibits cell growth and promotes cell cycle arrest at G1 (G0). However, little is known about whether Tor is involved in other stages of the cell division cycle. Here we report that the rapamycin-sensitive Tor complex 1 (TORC1) is involved in G2/M transition in S. cerevisiae. Strains carrying a temperature-sensitive allele of KOG1 (kog1-105) encoding an essential component of TORC1, as well as yeast cell treated with rapamycin show mitotic delay with prolonged G2. Overexpression of Cdc5, the yeast polo-like kinase, rescues the growth defect of kog1-105, and in turn, Cdc5 activity is attenuated in kog1-105 cells. The TORC1-Type2A phosphatase pathway mediates nucleocytoplasmic transport of Cdc5, which is prerequisite for its proper localization and function. The C-terminal polo-box domain of Cdc5 has an inhibitory role in nuclear translocation. Taken together, our results indicate a novel function of Tor in the regulation of cell cycle and proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2161392546,"Cataplexy is observed in a subset of patients with narcolepsy and affects approximately 1 in 2,000 persons. Cataplexy is most often triggered by strong emotions such as laughter, which can result in transient, yet debilitating, muscle atonia. The objective of this study was to examine the neural systems underlying humor processing in individuals with cataplexy.While undergoing functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), we showed ten narcolepsy-cataplexy patients and ten healthy controls humorous cartoons. In addition, we examined the brain activity of one subject while in a full-blown cataplectic attack. Behavioral results showed that participants with cataplexy rated significantly fewer humorous cartoons as funny compared to controls. Concurrent fMRI showed that patients, when compared to controls and in the absence of overt cataplexy symptoms, showed pronounced activity in the emotional network including the ventral striatum and hypothalamus while viewing humorous versus non-humorous cartoons. Increased activity was also observed in the right inferior frontal gyri--a core component of the inhibitory circuitry. In comparison, the one subject who experienced a cataplectic attack showed dramatic reductions in hypothalamic activity.These findings suggest an overdrive of the emotional circuitry and possible compensatory suppression by cortical inhibitory regions in cataplexy. Moreover, during cataplectic attacks, the hypothalamus is characterized by a marked decrease in activity similar to that observed during sleep. One possible explanation for these findings is an initial overdrive and compensatory shutdown of the hypothalamus resulting in full cataplectic symptoms."

Moreover, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), we were able to completely separate the host cells from the tumor cells, thus providing a system for detailed cellular and molecular analysis of tumor-host cell interactions. The fact that tumor and host cells can be reliably identified also allowed us to detect double-positive cells, possibly arising from cell fusion events or horizontal gene transfer.

https://openalex.org/W2137774293,"Background Intermittent preventive treatment for malaria in Infants (IPTi) has been shown to give effective and safe protection against malaria. It has been suggested that IPTi might have long-lasting beneficial effects but, in most settings, the protection provided by IPTi appears to be short-lived. Knowledge of the duration of protection given by IPTi would help interpret the results of existing trials and suggest optimal delivery schedules for IPTi. This study investigated how the protective efficacy of IPTi against malaria and anaemia changes over time. Methods and Findings A secondary analysis of data from a cluster-randomised, placebo-controlled trial of IPTi using sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) in Ghana was conducted. In this trial IPTi was given to 2485 infants at 3, 4, 9 and 12 months of age; children remained in follow-up until two years of age. Poisson regression with a random effect to adjust for the cluster-randomised design was used to determine protective efficacy of IPTi against clinical malaria and anaemia in defined time strata following administration of IPTi. Analysis of first-or-only clinical malaria episode following the individual IPTi doses showed that some protection against malaria lasted between 4 to 6 weeks. A similar pattern was seen when the incidence of all malaria episodes up to 2 years of age was analysed in relation to the most recent IPT, by pooling the incidence of malaria after the individual IPTi doses. Protective efficacy within four weeks of IPTi was 75.2% (95% CI: 66–82) against malaria, 78.9% (95% CI: 69–86) against high parasite density malaria, and 93.8% (95% CI: 73–99) against anaemia. Protection against these outcomes was short-lived, with evidence of any effect lasting for only 6, 6 and 4 weeks respectively. Protection in children who were parasitaemic when receiving IPTi appeared to be of shorter duration than in uninfected children. There was no evidence of any benefit of IPTi after the immediate period following the IPTi doses. Conclusions Intermittent preventive treatment provides considerable protection against malaria and anaemia for short periods, even in an area of intense seasonal transmission. Due to the relatively short duration of protection provided by each dose of IPTi, this treatment will be of most benefit when delivered at the time of peak malaria incidence."
https://openalex.org/W2070483724,"Hydrogels have become a promising research focus because of their potential for biomedical application. Here we explore the long-range, electrostatic interactions by following the effect of trans-acting (pH) and cis-acting factors (peptide mutation) on the formation of Au-phage hydrogels. These bioinorganic hydrogels can be generated from the bottom-up assembly of Au nanoparticles (Au NP) with either native or mutant bacteriophage (phage) through electrostatic interaction of the phage pVIII major capsid proteins (pVIII). The cis-acting factor consists of a peptide extension displayed on the pVIII that mutates the phage. Our results show that pH can dictate the direct-assembly and stability of Au-phage hydrogels in spite of the differences between the native and the mutant pVIII. The first step in characterizing the interactions of Au NP with phage was to generate a molecular model that identified the charge distribution and structure of the native and mutant pVIII. This model indicated that the mutant peptide extension carried a higher positive charge relative to the native pVIII at all pHs. Next, by monitoring the Au-phage interaction by means of optical microscopy, elastic light scattering, fractal dimension analysis as well as Uv-vis and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, we show that the positive charge of the mutant peptide extension favors the opposite charge affinity between the phage and Au NP as the pH is decreased. These results show the versatility of this assembly method, where the stability of these hydrogels can be achieved by either adjusting the pH or by changing the composition of the phage pVIII without the need of phage display libraries."
https://openalex.org/W1964990642,"NK cells have been long time considered as cytotoxic lymphocytes competent in killing virus-infected cells and tumors. However, NK cells may also play essential immuno-regulatory functions. In this context, the real existence of a defined NK subset with negative regulatory properties has been hypothesized but never clearly demonstrated.Herein, we show the in vitro generation from human peripheral blood haematopoietic progenitors (PB-HP), of a novel subset of non-cytolytic NK cells displaying a mature phenotype and remarkable immuno-regulatory functions (NK-ireg). The main functional hallmark of these NK-ireg cells is represented by the surface expression/release of HLA-G, a major immunosuppressive molecule. In addition, NK-ireg cells secrete two powerful immuno-regulatory factors: IL-10 and IL-21. Through these factors, NK-ireg cells act as effectors of the down-regulation of the immune response: reconverting mature myeloid DC (mDC) into immature/tolerogenic DC, blocking cytolytic functions on conventional NK cells and inducing HLA-G membrane expression on PB-derived monocytes. The generation of ""NK-ireg"" cells is obtained, by default, in culture conditions favouring cell-to-cell contacts, and it is strictly dependent on reciprocal trans-presentation of membrane-bound IL-15 forms constitutively and selectively expressed by human CD34(+) PB-HP. Finally, a small subset of NKp46(+) HLA-G(+) IL-10(+) is detected within freshly isolated decidual NK cells, suggesting that these cells could represent an in vivo counterpart of the NK-ireg cells.In conclusion, NK-ireg cells represent a novel truly differentiated non-cytolytic NK subset with a self-sustainable phenotype (CD56(+) CD16(+) NKp30(+) NKp44(+) NKp46(+) CD94(+) CD69(+) CCR7(+)) generated from specific pSTAT6(+) GATA3(+) precursors. NK-ireg cells could be employed to develop new immuno-suppressive strategies in autoimmune diseases, transplant rejection or graft versus host diseases. In addition, NK-ireg cells can be easily derived from peripheral blood of the patients and could constitute an autologous biotherapic tool to be used combined or in alternative to other immuno-regulatory cells."
https://openalex.org/W2055034539,"The mammalian nuclear poly(A)-binding protein, PABPN1, carries 13 asymmetrically dimethylated arginine residues in its C-terminal domain. By fractionation of cell extracts, we found that protein-arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs)-1, -3, and -6 are responsible for the modification of PABPN1. Recombinant PRMT1, -3, and -6 also methylated PABPN1. Our data suggest that these enzymes act on their own, and additional polypeptides are not involved in recognizing PABPN1 as a substrate. PRMT1 is the predominant methyltransferase acting on PABPN1. Nevertheless, PABPN1 was almost fully methylated in a Prmt1-/- cell line; thus, PRMT3 and -6 suffice for methylation. In contrast to PABPN1, the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K is selectively methylated only by PRMT1. Efficient methylation of synthetic peptides derived from PABPN1 or hnRNP K suggested that PRMT1, -3, and -6 recognize their substrates by interacting with local amino acid sequences and not with additional domains of the substrates. However, the use of fusion proteins suggested that the inability of PRMT3 and -6 to modify hnRNP K is because of structural masking of the methyl-accepting amino acid sequences by neighboring domains. Mutations leading to intracellular aggregation of PABPN1 cause the disease oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy. The C-terminal domain containing the methylated arginine residues is known to promote PAPBN1 self-association, and arginine methylation has been reported to inhibit self-association of an orthologous protein. Thus, arginine methylation might be relevant for oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy.

Dimethylation of arginine side chains is a relatively common post-translational modification of proteins (1Gary J.D. Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

Most proteins modified in this manner are involved in DNA or RNA function; many of them bind nucleic acids directly, and the modification is frequently found in RNA binding domains. Still, modulation of protein-protein rather than protein-nucleic acids interactions seems to be the predominant function of arginine dimethylation (2Bedford M.T. Richard S. Mol.

Symmetric dimethylation (ω-NG,N′G-dimethylarginine) has been found in some of the so-called Sm proteins in the core of spliceo-somal small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (6Brahms H.

Yang Z.-H. Kim Y.-S. Lee J.-H. Cook J.R. Pestka S. Pharmacol. Ther. 2007; 113: 50-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Asymmetric dimethylation (ω-NG,NG-dimethylarginine) is the more frequent modification and is catalyzed by the type I protein-arginine methyltransferases PRMT1, -3, -4, -6, and -8 (4Krause C.D. Yang Z.-H. Kim Y.-S. Lee J.-H. Cook J.R. Pestka S. Pharmacol. Ther. 2007; 113: 50-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). PRMT2 is considered a type I enzyme because of sequence similarities, but catalytic activity has not been demonstrated. The human genome contains two more potential PRMTs, which have not been characterized (4Krause C.D. Yang Z.-H. Kim Y.-S. Lee J.-H. Cook J.R. Pestka S. Pharmacol. Ther. 2007; 113: 50-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar).The substrate preferences of different type I enzymes are poorly understood, and in many cases it is not clear whether a particular protein is methylated by a specific PRMT or by multiple enzymes. For some proteins, in vivo methylation by one specific methyltransferase has been confirmed by genetic or quasi-genetic means. For example, a knock-out of Prmt1 abolishes the methylation of the proteins Sam68 (7Côté J. Boisvert F.-M. Boulanger M.-C. Bedford M.T. Richard S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 274-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), hnRNP K (8Ostareck-Lederer A. Ostareck D.H. Rucknagel K.P. Schierhorn A. Moritz B. Huttelmaier S. Flach N. Handoko L. Wahle E. J.

Allis C.D. Wong J. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Science. 2001; 293: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). The role of PRMT1 in H4 methylation has also been confirmed by RNA interference experiments (10Huang S. Litt M. Felsenfeld G. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1885-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). A hypomorphic allele of Prmt3 leads to a loss of methylation of ribosomal protein S2 in mice (11Swiercz R. Cheng D. Kim D. Bedford M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16917-16923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and similar results have been obtained with a prmt3 deletion in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (12Bachand F. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2641-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A knock-out of Prmt4 abolishes the modification of the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein and the transcriptional cofactor p300 (13Yadav N. Lee J. Kim J. Shen J. Hu M.C.-T. Aldaz C.M. Bedford M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6464-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and knockdown of PRMT6 interferes with histone H3 methylation at Arg-2 (14Guccione E. Bassi C.

Dou Y. Hsieh J. Bauer U.-M. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 3369-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). These data suggest specific enzyme-substrate relationships, and a published survey also indicates that PRMT4 and -6 modify unique substrates (3Pahlich S. Zakaryan R.P. Gehring H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1764: 1890-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In contrast, most identified PRMT3 substrates can also be modified by PRMT1 according to the same survey; this argues for redundant PRMT function.The features of substrate proteins directing their modification by one or more PRMTs also remain to be defined. RGG domains with the consensus sequence (F/G)GGRGG(G/F) (1Gary J.D. Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 98: 65-131Crossref Google Scholar, 16Kim S. Merrill B.M. Rajpurohit R. Kumar A.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5185-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) were initially identified as prototypical arginine methylation sites. However, many identified substrates do not correspond to this consensus, and a more general definition of a methylation substrate is called a glycine- and arginine-rich sequence. A GST-glycine- and arginine-rich fusion protein (17Tang J. Gary J.D. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16935-16945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and synthetic peptides with similar sequences indeed serve as generic methyl acceptor sites, being methylated, in vitro, by PRMT1, -3, -6 and by the type II enzyme PRMT7 (3Pahlich S. Zakaryan R.P. Gehring H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1764: 1890-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) but not by PRMT4 (18Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.-M. Schurter B.T.

Stallcup M.R. Aswad D.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5747-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). This supports the idea that at least some of the PRMTs may be largely redundant with respect to their substrates.One unbiased approach to the identification of the PRMT(s) relevant for the modification of a specific substrate is purification from a cell extract. For example, this approach has led to the identification of PRMT1 as being responsible for the methylation of Arg-3 in histone H4 (9Wang H. Huang Z.-Q. Xia L. Feng Q. Erdjument-Bromage H. Strahl B.D. Briggs S.D. Allis C.D. Wong J. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Science. 2001; 293: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). In contrast, experiments based solely on the use of recombinant PRMTs are potentially flawed. Many experiments have used GST fusion proteins, and this type of fusion affects the activity of some PRMTs but not others, skewing their relative efficiencies in the modification of a substrate (8Ostareck-Lederer A. Ostareck D.H. Rucknagel K.P. Schierhorn A. Moritz B. Huttelmaier S. Flach N. Handoko L. Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11115-11125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). More importantly, for most PRMTs it is currently unknown whether they act by themselves or are merely the catalytic subunits of larger complexes that may influence the substrate specificity. Locus-specific arginine methylation of histones strongly suggests roles for additional proteins in targeting methylation (2Bedford M.T. Richard S. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 263-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 20Lee D.Y. Teyssier C. Strahl B.D. Stallcup M.R. Endocr. Rev. 2005; 26: 147-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In fact, the methylation of histone H3 Arg-17 by PRMT4 (=CARM1) depends on the recruitment of the enzyme by a transcriptional coactivator (18Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.-M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). PRMT4 has also been identified as a component of a hetero-oligomeric complex, which can methylate histone H3 within nucleosomes, whereas PRMT4 by itself prefers the free histone as a substrate (21Xu W. Cho H. Kadam S. Banayo E.M. Anderson S. Yates J.R. Emerson B.M. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 144-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The type II enzyme PRMT5 forms a complex with two other proteins, WD45 and pICln. The latter is responsible for substrate recognition by binding to the Sm domain (22Friesen W.J. Paushkin S. Wyce A.

It stimulates the activity of poly(A) polymerase by increasing the processivity of the enzyme and contributes to limiting the poly(A) length to about 250 nucleotides (27Bienroth S. Keller W. Wahle E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 29Kerwitz Y. Kühn U. Lilie H. Knoth A. Scheuermann T. Friedrich H. Schwarz E. Wahle E.

The protein contains a C-terminal domain of ∼49 amino acids, in which all 13 arginine residues are quantitatively asymmetrically dimethylated (31Nemeth A. Krause S. Blank D. Jenny A. Jenö P. Lustig A. Wahle E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4034-4041Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 32Smith J.J. Rücknagel K.P. Schierhorn A. Tang J. Nemeth A. Linder M. Herschman H.R. Wahle E. J.

The methylated sites in mammalian PABPN1 are clusters of RXR sequences, which reside in a sequence environment reminiscent of RGG domains, being rich in phenylalanine and tyrosine and low in sequence complexity. The C-terminal domain contributes both to poly(A) binding and to the stimulation of polyadenylation, but neither function is noticeably influenced by arginine methylation (29Kerwitz Y. Kühn U.

However, this analysis was incomplete; other PRMTs were unknown at the time and thus not tested, and only recombinant GST-PRMT fusion proteins were used. Thus, the question of which enzymes are responsible for the modification of PABPN1 deserved to be re-evaluated.Mutations in the human gene encoding PABPN1 cause a genetic disease, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD). These mutations lead to the extension of the polyalanine tract at the N terminus of the protein from 10 residues in the wild-type up to 17 residues (34Brais B. Bouchard J.P. Xie Y.G. Rochefort D.L. Chrétien N. Tomé F.M.S. Lafrenière R.G. Rommens J.M. Uyama E. Nohira O. Blumen S. Korcyn A.D. Heutink P. Mathieu J. Duranceau A. Codère F. Fardeau M. Rouleau G.A. Nat.

Brais B. Rouleau G.A. Kühn U. Wahle E. Carmo-Fonseca M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Wild-type PABPN1 has a tendency to form ill-defined amorphous aggregates in vitro (31Nemeth A. Krause S. Blank D. Jenny A. Jenö P. Lustig A. Wahle E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4034-4041Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 36Keller R.W. Kühn U. Aragon M. Bornikova L. Wahle E. Bear D.G. J. Mol.

Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2685-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Formation of these PABPN1 aggregates relies to a large extent on the C-terminal domain containing the dimethylated arginine residues (33Kühn U. Nemeth A. Meyer S. Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16916-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 38Fan X. Dion P. Laganiere J. Brais B. Rouleau G.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that formation of amorphous aggregates may promote formation of fibrils (38Fan X. Dion P. Laganiere J. Brais B. Rouleau G.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Several observations have indicated that arginine methylation might affect protein aggregation. In immunoprecipitation experiments with cells lacking PRMT1, the background was strongly increased compared with wild-type cells, suggesting a generally increased tendency of proteins to aggregate (8Ostareck-Lederer A. Ostareck D.H. Rucknagel K.P. Schierhorn A. Moritz B. Huttelmaier S. Flach N. Handoko L. Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11115-11125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein Npl3, which normally carries asymmetric dimethylarginine, has an increased tendency to self-associate in a methylation-deficient yeast strain (39Yu M.C. Bachand F. McBride A.E. Komili S. Casolari J.M. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2924-2935Google Scholar). The PABPN1 orthologue in S. pombe (termed Pab2) was recently identified and shown to be arginine-methylated in RG dipeptides in its C-terminal domain. Again, genetic inactivation of the methyltransferase RMT1 increased the tendency of Pab2 to self-associate, and it was proposed that this observation might be relevant for PABPN1 fibril formation in OPMD (40Perreault A. Lemieux C. Bachand F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7552-7562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).In this study, we identify the type I arginine methyltransferases PRMT1, -3, and -6 as the enzymes modifying mammalian PABPN1. Among them, PRMT1 is the dominant enzyme. Our data suggest that PRMT1, -3, and -6 recognize their substrates on their own, independently of associated polypeptides, and that their overlapping but distinct substrate specificities are determined both by local amino acid sequences and by accessibility of methyl-accepting side chains in the context of a folded protein. Comparison of methylated and unmethylated PABPN1 in two different assays revealed no methylation-dependent difference in self-association, whereas the same assays showed that a His tag does favor aggregation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—Bovine His-PABPN1 and His-PABPN1ΔC49 were expressed from the plasmids pUK-synPABPN1 and pUK-synPABPN1ΔC49, respectively (33Kühn U. Nemeth A. Meyer S. Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16916-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For expression of nontagged PABPN1, the NdeI/BamHI fragment of pUK-syn-PABPN1 containing the PABPN1 open reading frame was cloned into the corresponding sites of pET11a (Novagen). PABPN1-KS and PABPN1-KL are fusion proteins in which the C-terminal domain of PABPN1 was replaced by fragments of hnRNP K containing the methyl-accepting arginines. The fragment encoding amino acids 258 -306 in the expression construct for His-tagged bovine PABPN1 was removed by means of an introduced KpnI site and the BamHI site. This fragment was replaced either by a DNA sequence encoding amino acids 241-333 of hnRNP K, amplified with the primers CGGGGTACCTTTGATGACCGTCGC and CGCGGATCCTCAGTAACGGTCTCCGAGC (PABPN1-KL fusion), or by a DNA sequence encoding amino acids 251-309, amplified with the primers CGGGGTACCGGATTTCCATGCGG and CGCGGATCCTCAAGGAAGATTCCGAGC (PABPN1-KS fusion).

For use in kinetic measurements, His-PRMT1 and -3 were further purified on a Mono Q column (GE Healthcare) and His-PRMT6 on a Mono Q and a phenyl-Superose column. The nontagged PRMTs were purified by slight variations of the following procedure. The bacterial lysate was loaded on a DEAE-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare; 10 mg of protein/ml column volume) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol.

https://openalex.org/W1973722426,"Nitric oxide (NO) plays a critical role in wound healing, in part by promoting angiogenesis. However, the precise repair pathways affected by NO are not well defined. We now show that NO regulates matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) release during wound repair. We find that normally MMP-13 is kept inside endothelial cells by an association with caveolin-1. However, nitration of MMP-13 on tyrosine residue Y338 causes it to dissociate from caveolin-1 and be released from endothelial cells. We next explored the functional significance of MMP-13 nitration in vivo. Skin injury increases nitration of MMP-13 in mice. Skin wounds in inducible nitric oxide synthase knockout mice release less MMP-13 and heal more slowly than skin wounds in wild-type mice. Conversely, skin wounds in caveolin-1 knockout mice have increased NO production, increased MMP-13 nitration, and accelerated wound healing. Collectively, our data reveal a new pathway through which NO modulates wound repair: nitration of MMP-13 promotes its release from endothelial cells, where it accelerates angiogenesis and wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W2003000952,"Background Mycobacterium tuberculosis kills approximately 2 million people each year and presents an urgent need to identify new targets and new antitubercular drugs. Thymidylate synthase (TS) enzymes from other species offer good targets for drug development and the M. tuberculosis genome contains two putative TS enzymes, a conventional ThyA and a flavin-based ThyX. In M. tuberculosis, both TS enzymes have been implicated as essential for growth, either based on drug-resistance studies or genome-wide mutagenesis screens. To facilitate future small molecule inhibitors against these proteins, a detailed enzymatic characterization was necessary. Methodology/Principal Findings After cloning, overexpression, and purification, the thymidylate-synthesizing ability of ThyA and ThyX gene products were directly confirmed by HPLC analysis of reaction products and substrate saturation kinetics were established. 5-Fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine 5′-monophosphate (FdUMP) was a potent inhibitor of both ThyA and ThyX, offering important clues to double-targeting strategies. In contrast, the folate-based 1843U89 was a potent inhibitor of ThyA but not ThyX suggesting that it should be possible to find ThyX-specific antifolates. A turnover-dependent kinetic assay, combined with the active-site titration approach of Ackermann and Potter, revealed that both M. tuberculosis enzymes had very low kcat values. One possible explanation for the low catalytic activity of M. tuberculosis ThyX is that its true biological substrates remain to be identified. Alternatively, this slow-growing pathogen, with low demands for TMP, may have evolved to down-regulate TS activities by altering the turnover rate of individual enzyme molecules, perhaps to preserve total protein quantities for other purposes. In many organisms, TS is often used as a part of larger complexes of macromolecules that control replication and DNA repair. Conclusions/Significance Thus, the present enzymatic characterization of ThyA and ThyX from M. tuberculosis provides a framework for future development of cell-active inhibitors and the biological roles of these TS enzymes in M. tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W2049811207,"Cannabinoids, the active components of marijuana, stimulate appetite, and cannabinoid receptor-1 (CB1-R) antagonists suppress appetite and promote weight loss. Little is known about how CB1-R antagonists affect the central neurocircuitry, specifically the melanocortin system that regulates energy balance.Here, we show that peripherally administered CB1-R antagonist (AM251) or agonist equally suppressed or stimulated feeding respectively in A(y) , which lack a functional melanocortin system, and wildtype mice, demonstrating that cannabinoid effects on feeding do not require melanocortin circuitry. CB1-R antagonist or agonist administered into the ventral tegmental area (VTA) equally suppressed or stimulated feeding respectively, in both genotypes. In addition, peripheral and central cannabinoid administration similarly induced c-Fos activation in brain sites suggesting mediation via motivational dopaminergic circuitry. Amperometry-detected increases in evoked dopamine (DA) release by the CB1-R antagonist in nucleus accumbens slices indicates that AM251 modulates DA release from VTA terminals.Our results demonstrate that the effects of cannabinoids on energy balance are independent of hypothalamic melanocortin circuitry and is primarily driven by the reward system."
https://openalex.org/W2009834416,"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation has recently been suggested to have an association with various cancers, including prostate cancer risk, in human populations. Since mtDNA is haploid and lacks recombination, specific mutations in the mtDNA genome associated with human diseases arise and remain in particular genetic backgrounds referred to as haplogroups. To assess the possible contribution of mtDNA haplogroup-specific mutations to the occurrence of prostate cancer, we have therefore performed a population-based study of a prostate cancer cases and corresponding controls from the Korean population. No statistically significant difference in the distribution of mtDNA haplogroup frequencies was observed between the case and control groups of Koreans. Thus, our data imply that specific mtDNA mutations/lineages did not appear to have a significant effect on a predisposition to prostate cancer in the Korean population, although larger sample sizes are necessary to validate our results."
https://openalex.org/W2111473836,"Tracking moving objects in space is important for the maintenance of spatiotemporal continuity in everyday visual tasks. In the laboratory, this ability is tested using the Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) task, where participants track a subset of moving objects with attention over an extended period of time. The ability to track multiple objects with attention is severely limited. Recent research has shown that this ability may improve with extensive practice (e.g., from action videogame playing). However, whether tracking also improves in a short training session with repeated trajectories has rarely been investigated. In this study we examine the role of visual learning in multiple-object tracking and characterize how varieties of attention interact with visual learning.Participants first conducted attentive tracking on trials with repeated motion trajectories for a short session. In a transfer phase we used the same motion trajectories but changed the role of tracking targets and nontargets. We found that compared with novel trials, tracking was enhanced only when the target subset was the same as that used during training. Learning did not transfer when the previously trained targets and nontargets switched roles or mixed up. However, learning was not specific to the trained temporal order as it transferred to trials where the motion was played backwards.These findings suggest that a demanding task of tracking multiple objects can benefit from learning of repeated motion trajectories. Such learning potentially facilitates tracking in natural vision, although learning is largely confined to the trajectories of attended objects. Furthermore, we showed that learning in attentive tracking relies on relational coding of all target trajectories. Surprisingly, learning was not specific to the trained temporal context, probably because observers have learned motion paths of each trajectory independently of the exact temporal order."
https://openalex.org/W1999373812,"Categorization is essential to all cognitive processes, but identifying the neural substrates underlying categorization processes is a real challenge. Among animals that have been shown to be able of categorization, songbirds are particularly interesting because they provide researchers with clear examples of categories of acoustic signals allowing different levels of recognition, and they possess a system of specialized brain structures found only in birds that learn to sing: the song system. Moreover, an avian brain nucleus that is analogous to the mammalian secondary auditory cortex (the caudo-medial nidopallium, or NCM) has recently emerged as a plausible site for sensory representation of birdsong, and appears as a well positioned brain region for categorization of songs. Hence, we tested responses in this non-primary, associative area to clear and distinct classes of songs with different functions and social values, and for a possible correspondence between these responses and the functional aspects of songs, in a highly social songbird species: the European starling. Our results clearly show differential neuronal responses to the ethologically defined classes of songs, both in the number of neurons responding, and in the response magnitude of these neurons. Most importantly, these differential responses corresponded to the functional classes of songs, with increasing activation from non-specific to species-specific and from species-specific to individual-specific sounds. These data therefore suggest a potential neural substrate for sorting natural communication signals into categories, and for individual vocal recognition of same-species members. Given the many parallels that exist between birdsong and speech, these results may contribute to a better understanding of the neural bases of speech."
https://openalex.org/W2033530618,"Direct social contact and social interaction affect speech development in human infants and are required in order to maintain perceptual abilities; however the processes involved are still poorly known. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that social segregation during development would prevent the proper development of a central auditory area, using a “classical” animal model of vocal development, a songbird. Based on our knowledge of European starling, we raised young female starlings with peers and only adult male tutors. This ensured that female would show neither social bond with nor vocal copying from males. Electrophysiological recordings performed when these females were adult revealed perceptual abnormalities: they presented a larger auditory area, a lower proportion of specialized neurons and a larger proportion of generalist sites than wild-caught females, whereas these characteristics were similar to those observed in socially deprived (physically separated) females. These results confirmed and added to earlier results for males, suggesting that the degree of perceptual deficiency reflects the degree of social separation. To our knowledge, this report constitutes the first evidence that social segregation can, as much as physical separation, alter the development of a central auditory area."
https://openalex.org/W1970543582,"Background Analysis of the evolutionary dynamics of Helicobacter pylori allowed tracing the spread of infection through populations on different continents but transmission pathways between individual humans have not been clearly described. Materials and Methods To investigate person-to-person transmission, we studied three families each including one child with persistence of symptoms after antibiotic treatment. Ten isolates from the antrum and corpus of stomach of each family member were analyzed both by sequencing of two housekeeping genes and macroarray tests. Results A total of 134 (8.4%) out of the 1590 coding sequences (CDSs) tested, including cag PAI and insertion sequences, were present in some but not all isolates (and are therefore defined as variable CDSs). Most of the variable CDSs encoded proteins of unknown function (76/134) or were selfish DNA including that encoding restriction/modification enzymes (13/134). Isolates colonizing the stomach of one individual can vary by point mutations, as seen in hspA, or by the gain or loss of one to five CDSs. They were considered as (genetic) variants. The phylogenetic clustering of gene profiles obtained on macro-arrays allowed identifying the different strains infecting families. Two to five strains circulated within a family. Identical strains were present in at least two members of all three families supporting the accepted model of intrafamilial transmission. Surprisingly, the mother was not implicated in the transmission of H. pylori in the two French families. Sibling-to-sibling transmission and acquisition of H. pylori from outside the family appeared to be probable in the transmission pathways. Conclusion Macroarray analysis based on previously selected CDSs gives a comprehensive view of the genome diversity of a pathogen. This approach combined with information on the origin of the hspA and glmM alleles revealed that Helicobacter pylori infection may be acquired by more diverse routes than previously expected."
https://openalex.org/W2151713392,"There is a burgeoning repository of information available from ancient DNA that can be used to understand how genomes have evolved and to determine the genetic features that defined a particular species. To assess the functional consequences of changes to a genome, a variety of methods are needed to examine extinct DNA function. We isolated a transcriptional enhancer element from the genome of an extinct marsupial, the Tasmanian tiger (Thylacinus cynocephalus or thylacine), obtained from 100 year-old ethanol-fixed tissues from museum collections. We then examined the function of the enhancer in vivo. Using a transgenic approach, it was possible to resurrect DNA function in transgenic mice. The results demonstrate that the thylacine Col2A1 enhancer directed chondrocyte-specific expression in this extinct mammalian species in the same way as its orthologue does in mice. While other studies have examined extinct coding DNA function in vitro, this is the first example of the restoration of extinct non-coding DNA and examination of its function in vivo. Our method using transgenesis can be used to explore the function of regulatory and protein-coding sequences obtained from any extinct species in an in vivo model system, providing important insights into gene evolution and diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2156452197,"Specialized chromatin exists at centromeres and must be precisely transmitted during DNA replication. The mechanisms involved in the propagation of these structures remain elusive. Fission yeast centromeres are composed of two chromatin domains: the central CENP-A(Cnp1) kinetochore domain and flanking heterochromatin domains. Here we show that fission yeast Mcl1, a DNA polymerase alpha (Pol alpha) accessory protein, is critical for maintenance of centromeric chromatin. In a screen for mutants that alleviate both central domain and outer repeat silencing, we isolated several cos mutants, of which cos1 is allelic to mcl1. The mcl1-101 mutation causes reduced CENP-A(Cnp1) in the central domain and an aberrant increase in histone acetylation in both domains. These phenotypes are also observed in a mutant of swi7(+), which encodes a catalytic subunit of Pol alpha. Mcl1 forms S-phase-specific nuclear foci, which colocalize with those of PCNA and Pol alpha. These results suggest that Mcl1 and Pol alpha are required for propagation of centromere chromatin structures during DNA replication."

Select. 2006; 19: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 12Kumar S. Chen C.S. Waxman D.J. Halpert J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19569-19575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). As a complement to directed evolution, amino acid sequences were compared among CYP2B6 (low heterologous expression in bacteria) and CYP2B1, CYP2B4, and CYP2B11 (high P450 expression), which led to the design of CYP2B6 L264F. This mutant showed enhanced expression and stability compared with the wild type (13Kumar S. Zhao Y. Sun L. Halpert J.R. Muralidhara B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 1191-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). CYP2B6 is one of the most polymorphic P450 enzymes in humans, with 28 alleles described to date. Several genetic variants are linked to altered plasma levels and/or in vitro metabolism of bupropion (14Kirchheiner J. Klein C. Meineke I. Sasse J. Zanger U.M. Mürdter T.E. Roots I. Brockmöller J. Pharmacogenetics. 2003; 13: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar -17Lang T. Klein K. Richter T. Zibat A. Kerb R. Eichelbaum M. Schwab M. Zanger U.M. J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 2004; 311: 34-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Mutations in all the variants are located in non-active site regions. Two of the non-synonymous changes in particular, Q172H and K262R, are found in multiple haplotypes. Frequencies of the three most common variants range from 14 to 49% for Q172H, 17 to 63% for K262R, and 0 to 14% for R487C depending on the ethnicity of the population studied (17Lang T. Klein K. Richter T. Zibat A. Kerb R. Eichelbaum M. Schwab M. Zanger U.M. J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 2004; 311: 34-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). At present, the structural basis for the altered function of P450 2B6 variants or for species differences relative to CYP2B1, CYP2B4, or CYP2B11 with regard to the oxidation of steroids (18Domanski T.L. Schultz K.M. Roussel F. Stevens J.C. Halpert J.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 1141-1147PubMed Google Scholar), or inhibition by imidazoles (16Ward B.A. Gorski J.C. Jones D.R. Hall S.D. Flockhart D.A. Desta Z. J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 2003; 306: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) is largely unknown. Based on the x-ray crystal structure of bacterial P450cam, Osamu Gotoh in 1992 analyzed 52 P450 family 2 sequences (CYP2), and identified 6 substrate recognition sites (SRSs) (19Gotoh O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 83-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These SRSs have been used extensively to guide site-directed studies in CYP2B enzymes (20Domanski T.L. Halpert J.R. Curr. Drug Metab. 2001; 2: 117-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Subsequent x-ray crystal structures have verified most of the active site residues inferred from mutagenesis studies (1Zhao Y.H. Halpert J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1770: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 7Scott E.E. White M.A. He Y.A. Johnson E.F. Stout C.D. Halpert J.R. J. Biol.

Cell. 2001; 5: 121-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (710) Google Scholar). However, to investigate the role of non-active site regions/residues we need an additional approach. One such approach is conserved sequence motifs (CSM) analysis. In previous work, a multiple sequence alignment from representative alphaviruses was used to determine physical chemical property motifs (likely functional areas) with our PCPMer program. Information on residue variability, propensity to be in protein interfaces, and surface exposure on the model was combined to predict surface clusters likely to interact with other viral or cellular proteins. Mutagenesis of these clusters indicated that the predictions accurately detected areas crucial for virus infection (22Schein C.H. Zhou B. Braun W. Virol. J. 2005; 2: 40Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In addition, we successfully used this approach to locate regions far from the active site that modulate substrate binding and processivity in apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE1) and related nucleases (23Venkatarajan S.M. Schein C.H. Braun W. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1381-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 24Schein C.H. Özgün N. Izumi T. Braun W. Bioinformatics. 2002; 3: 37PubMed Google Scholar). We also showed that CSM as defined by the software package PCPMer can find functionally important residues in surface-exposed regions of viral proteins (25Schein C.H. Zhou B. Oezguen N. Mathura V.S. Braun W. Proteins. 2005; 58: 200-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 26Negi S.S. Kolokoltsov A.A. Schein C.H. Davey R.A. Braun W. J. Mol. Model. 2006; 12: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined a set of 175 P450 sequences from family 2 and identified 20 CSMs. Based on existing structural and functional information on the various CSMs, the role of CSM 8 (187RFDYKD192 in CYP2B4) in enzyme catalysis, inhibition, and stability was studied by site-directed mutagenesis. Materials—7-Methoxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)coumarin (7-MFC), 7-ethoxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)coumarin (7-EFC), and 7-benzyloxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)coumarin (7-BFC) were purchased from Invitrogen. [4-14C]Testosterone was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. 4-CPI, BIF, NADPH, and H2O2 were bought from Sigma. Recombinant NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) and cytochrome b5 (b5) from rat liver were prepared as described previously (27Harlow G.R. He Y.A. Halpert J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1338: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers for PCR were obtained from Sigma Genosys (Woodlands, TX). The QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity resin was purchased from Qiagen. All other chemicals were of the highest grade available and were obtained from standard commercial sources. Identification of Conserved Sequence Motifs—We selected 175 CYP2 sequences from the species human, mouse, rat, dog, fugu, and zebrafish, and generated a multiple sequence alignment with ClustalW (28Venkatarajan M.S. Braun W. J. Mol. Model. 2001; 7: 445-453Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar), as presented in supporting data (supplemental Table S1). This multiple sequence alignment was further analyzed with our program PCPMer. In PCPMer each of the 20 natural amino acids was represented by a 5-dimensional vector. The basis vectors of this 5-dimensional space were derived by multidimensional scaling of 237 dimensional physicochemical property (PCP) space (23Venkatarajan S.M. Schein C.H. Braun W. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1381-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The eigenvector that had the highest eigenvalue correlated very well (r = 0.95) with the hydrophilicity scale. However, every eigenvector was a linear combination of different PCP of the 237 dimensional spaces. PCPMer generated a profile for the alignment at every position, which included the standard deviation and relative entropy (30Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55997) Google Scholar) for each position and component of the 5-dimensional space. PCPMer then used these profiles to identify high relative entropy clusters (highly conserved regions) CSM. Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification of P450 Enzymes—All the site-directed single mutants in CSM 8 and a negative control K186A were created using CYP2B4dH/H226Y (H226Y) as the template and appropriate forward and reverse primers as presented in supplemental Table S2. In addition, R187A and D192A were created in CYP2B1dH. To confirm the desired mutation and verify the absence of unintended mutations all constructs were sequenced at the University of Texas Medical Branch Protein Chemistry Laboratory (Galveston, TX). H226Y and CSM 8 mutants were expressed as His-tagged proteins in Escherichia coli TOPP3 and purified using a nickel-affinity column as described previously (7Scott E.E. White M.A. He Y.A. Johnson E.F. Stout C.D. Halpert J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27294-27301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The P450 content was measured by reduced CO-difference spectra. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Enzyme Assays—The standard NADPH-dependent enzyme assay with 7-MFC, 7-EFC, 7-BFC, and testosterone was essentially carried out as described previously (12Kumar S. Chen C.S. Waxman D.J. Halpert J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19569-19575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 31Hernandez C.E. Kumar S. Liu H. Halpert J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 455: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To determine the substrate specificity, 200 μm of 7-MFC, 7-EFC, and testosterone and 75 μm of 7-BFC in 2% methanol were used. For steady-state kinetic analysis a concentration range of 10-200 μm of 7-MFC and 7-EFC was used. Above 200 μm concentrations the substrates were not soluble in 2% methanol. The reconstituted system contained P450 (0.05 μm), CPR, and b5 at a molar ratio of 1:4:2. Cumene hydroperoxide (CuOOH)-supported reactions were carried out at 1 mm CuOOH and were devoid of NADPH, CPR, and b5. Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined by regression analysis using SigmaPlot (Jandel, San Rafel, CA). The kcat and Km values were determined using the Michaelis-Menten equation. Each kinetic experiment included H226Y, K186A, and the CSM 8 mutants simultaneously for more accurate comparison of the data. Inhibition Studies—Enzyme inhibition was measured using the 7-EFC O-deethylation assay in a final reaction volume of 100 μl at 0.005-0.1 μm 4-CPI and 0.1-2.5 μm BIF concentrations as described previously (31Hernandez C.E. Kumar S. Liu H. Halpert J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 455: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). BIF and 4-CPI inhibition studies for all the mutants utilized 0.025 μm P450. Nonlinear regression analysis was performed to fit the data using a four-parameter logistic function to derive the IC50 values. Each experiment included H226Y, K186A, and the CSM 8 mutants simultaneously for more accurate comparison of the data. Thermal Stability—Inactivation of P450 was essentially carried out as described (11Kumar S. Sun L. Liu H. Muralidhara B.K. Halpert J.R. Protein Eng. Des. Select. 2006; 19: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 13Kumar S. Zhao Y. Sun L. Halpert J.R. Muralidhara B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 1191-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 1 μm protein in 100 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, in a 1-ml semi-micro spectrophotometric cell with constant stirring using a Shimadzu-2600 spectrophotometer. Thermal inactivation was carried out by measuring a series of absorbance spectra in the 340-700 nm range as a function of temperature between 30 and 70 °C with the interval of 2.5-5 °C and a 3-min equilibration at each temperature range. Determination of the total concentration of the heme protein was done by non-linear least square approximation of the spectra using a linear combination of spectral standards of CYP2B4 low spin, high spin, and P420 states. All data treatment and fitting of the titration curves were performed with our SpectraLab software as described (32Davydov D.R. Deprez E. Hoa G.H. Knyushko T.V. Kuznetsova G.P. Koen Y.M. Archakov A.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 330-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Fitting of the temperature profile curves was performed by regression analysis using SigmaPlot (Jandel, San Rafel, CA). The inactivation profiles were fit to a sigmoidal curve using four-parameter logistic function to obtain the mid-point of the thermal transition temperature (Tm) as described (11Kumar S. Sun L. Liu H. Muralidhara B.K. Halpert J.R. Protein Eng. Des. Select. 2006; 19: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 13Kumar S. Zhao Y. Sun L. Halpert J.R. Muralidhara B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 1191-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Catalytic Tolerance to Temperature—The catalytic tolerance to temperature was studied by incubating enzyme (20 pmol in 20 μl dialysis buffer for two assays) at different temperatures (30-70 °C) with the interval of 2.5-5 °C for 10 min. The samples were then chilled in ice for 15 min and then brought to room temperature prior to measuring enzyme activity using a 7-EFC O-deethylation assay as described earlier (13Kumar S. Zhao Y. Sun L. Halpert J.R. Muralidhara B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 1191-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The temperature at which the enzyme retains 50% of the activity (T50) was calculated by fitting the data to a sigmoidal curve using a four-parameter function by regression analysis using SigmaPlot. Identification of CSM in P450 Family 2—The program PCPMer identified 20 CSM from the multiple alignments of the selected 175 CYP2 sequences (supplemental Table S1). Because we included sequences from diverse subfamilies, we did not expect to pick up motifs that are specific for subfamilies but rather CSMs that are important and common for the whole CYP2 enzymes. These CSMs were conserved structurally, functionally, and dynamically because of the general features of the family, and they were spread throughout the sequences (Fig. 1). Furthermore, individual motifs and residues within the motifs were analyzed from 175 sequences to rank the level of conservation (Table 1). The rank order for conservation as defined by the relative entropy level of the motifs is presented in column 3, whereas the rank order of the residues within the motifs are in the order blue > gray > red.TABLE 1PCPMer motifs of CYP2 enzymes generated using 175 different sequencesView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In column 2 the colors of the residues in the motifs represent the rank order of sequence conservation as a function of relative entropy; red is the least conserved, black is intermediate, and blue represents the most conserved residues.

Structural and Functional Analyses of the CSM—Using the reported data detailed structural and functional analyses of the CSMs were performed. Structural analysis was performed by comparing CYP2B4 ligand-free (open, 1PO5) and 4-CPI-bound (closed, 1SUO) structures, which differ in their secondary structures and backbone movements (1-8 Å) (6Scott E.E. He Y.A. Wester M.R. White M.A. Chin C.C. Halpert J.R. Johnson E.F. Stout C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13196-13201Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 7Scott E.E.

J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5973-5981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We analyzed each CSM, and the results describing altered regions of the CYP2B4 are presented in Table 1 and Fig. 1. It was not surprising that regions that interact directly with the heme are conserved, such as CSM 12 in the middle of helix I or CSM 18 at the beginning of helix L. CSM 9 and 10 (helix F′,G′, and beginning of helix G) are likely involved in enzyme opening/closing and alter their conformation drastically upon ligand binding. On the other hand, CSM 1, a loop before helix A′, and CSM 2, a β strand after helix A, are also conserved without any visible involvement in function. A probable functional role of these CSMs was assessed by reviewing the reported mutagenesis data on CYP2B enzymes, including genetic variants of human CYP2B6. Detailed observations are presented in Table 1 (1Zhao Y.H. Halpert J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1770: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 6Scott E.E. He Y.A. Wester M.R.

It was intriguing to see that many of these CSMs were subjected previously to experimental studies, which showed effects on structure, function, expression, and/or stability (Table 1). Based on the literature, many residues in helices C and D are involved in CPR and/or b5 binding. Similarly, the role of SRS/active site and substrate access channels mainly through B/C, F/G, H, and I loops/helices has been studied extensively, especially in CYP2B1 (13Kumar S. Zhao Y. Sun L. Halpert J.R. Muralidhara B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 1191-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 33Scott E.E. He Y.Q. Halpert J.R. Chem. Res.

In contrast, CSMs 1, 2, 7, 15, 16, 18, and 19 have not been studied earlier and have the least dynamic structures. The most intriguing finding was that the CYP2B6 variants, whose altered functions cannot be explained based on existing structure-function information, are found in the CSM. For example, K262R*, which is the most frequent variant (17-63%) and shows altered activity, is located in motif 11 (37Lang T. Klein K. Fischer J. Nüssler A.K. Neuhaus P. Hofmann U. Eichelbaum M.

https://openalex.org/W2027804043,"Background A hierarchy, characterized by tree-like relationships, is a natural method of organizing data in various domains. When considering an unsupervised machine learning routine, such as clustering, a bottom-up hierarchical (BU, agglomerative) algorithm is used as a default and is often the only method applied. Methodology/Principal Findings We show that hierarchical clustering that involve global considerations, such as top-down (TD, divisive), or glocal (global-local) algorithms are better suited to reveal meaningful patterns in the data. This is demonstrated, by testing the correspondence between the results of several algorithms (TD, glocal and BU) and the correct annotations provided by experts. The correspondence was tested in multiple domains including gene expression experiments, stock trade records and functional protein families. The performance of each of the algorithms is evaluated by statistical criteria that are assigned to clusters (nodes of the hierarchy tree) based on expert-labeled data. Whereas TD algorithms perform better on global patterns, BU algorithms perform well and are advantageous when finer granularity of the data is sought. In addition, a novel TD algorithm that is based on genuine density of the data points is presented and is shown to outperform other divisive and agglomerative methods. Application of the algorithm to more than 500 protein sequences belonging to ion-channels illustrates the potential of the method for inferring overlooked functional annotations. ClustTree, a graphical Matlab toolbox for applying various hierarchical clustering algorithms and testing their quality is made available. Conclusions Although currently rarely used, global approaches, in particular, TD or glocal algorithms, should be considered in the exploratory process of clustering. In general, applying unsupervised clustering methods can leverage the quality of manually-created mapping of proteins families. As demonstrated, it can also provide insights in erroneous and missed annotations."
https://openalex.org/W2031059254,"Background Various prognostic serum and cellular markers have been identified for many diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and tumor pathologies. Here we assessed whether the levels of certain stem cells may predict the progression of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Methods and Findings The levels of several subpopulations of circulating stem cells expressing the CD133 antigen were determined by flow cytometry in 70 DMD patients. The correlation between the levels and clinical status was assessed by statistical analysis. The median (±SD) age of the population was 10.66±3.81 (range 3 to 20 years). The levels of CD133+CXCR4+CD34- stem cells were significantly higher in DMD patients compared to healthy controls (mean±standard deviation: 17.38±1.38 vs. 11.0±1.70; P = 0.03) with a tendency towards decreased levels in older patients. Moreover, the levels of this subpopulation of cells correlated with the clinical condition. In a subgroup of 19 DMD patients after 24 months of follow-up, increased levels of CD133+CXCR4+CD34- cells was shown to be associated with a phenotype characterised by slower disease progression. The circulating CD133+CXCR4+CD34- cells in patients from different ages did not exhibit significant differences in their myogenic and endothelial in vitro differentiation capacity. Conclusions Our results suggest that levels of CD133+CXCR4+CD34- could function as a new prognostic clinical marker for the progression of DMD."
https://openalex.org/W2077191717,"Int6 is a proto-oncogene implicated in various types of cancer, but the mechanisms underlying its activity are not clear. Int6 encodes a subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, and interacts with two related complexes, the proteasome, whose activity is regulated by Int6 in S. pombe, and the COP9 signalosome. The COP9 signalosome regulates the activity of Cullin-Ring Ubiquitin Ligases via deneddylation of their cullin subunit. We report here the generation and analysis of two Drosophila mutants in Int6. The mutants are lethal demonstrating that Int6 is an essential gene. The mutant larvae accumulate high levels of non-neddylated Cul1, suggesting that Int6 is a positive regulator of cullin neddylation. Overexpression in Int6 in cell culture leads to accumulation of neddylated cullins, further supporting a positive role for Int6 in regulating neddylation. Thus Int6 and the COP9 signalosome play opposing roles in regulation of cullin neddylation."
