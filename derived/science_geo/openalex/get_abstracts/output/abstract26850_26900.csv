https://openalex.org/W2015500392,"Neural transplantation can restore striatal dopaminergic neurotransmission in animal models of Parkinson's disease. It has now been shown that mesencephalic dopamine neurons, obtained from human fetuses of 8 to 9 weeks gestational age, can survive in the human brain and produce marked and sustained symptomatic relief in a patient severely affected with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. The grafts, which were implanted unilaterally into the putamen by stereotactic surgery, restored dopamine synthesis and storage in the grafted area, as assessed by positron emission tomography with 6-L-[18F]fluorodopa. This neurochemical change was accompanied by a therapeutically significant reduction in the patient's severe rigidity and bradykinesia and a marked diminuation of the fluctuations in the patient's condition during optimum medication (the ""on-off"" phenomenon). The clinical improvement was most marked on the side contralateral to the transplant."

https://openalex.org/W1989297216,"Activity of the immunoglobulin heavy and kappa light chain gene enhancers depends on a complex interplay of ubiquitous and developmentally regulated proteins. Two complementary DNAs were isolated that encode proteins, denoted ITF-1 and ITF-2, that are expressed in a variety of cell types and bind the microE5/kappa 2 motif found in both heavy and kappa light chain enhancers. The complementary DNAs are the products of distinct genes, yet both ITF-1 and ITF-2 are structurally and functionally similar. The two proteins interact with one another through their putative helix-loop-helix motifs and each possesses a distinct domain that dictates transcription activation."
https://openalex.org/W1479831323,"Recently cellular protooncogenes have been found to be induced as an early response to pressure overload in cardiac hypertrophy. To examine whether mechanical stimuli directly induce specific gene expression in the heart, we cultured rat neonatal cardiocytes in elastic silicone dishes and stretched these adherent cells. Myocyte stretching stimulated expression of the protooncogene, c-fos, in a stretch length-dependent manner, followed by an increase in amino acid incorporation into proteins. c-fos mRNA levels were enhanced within 15 min by cardiocyte stretching, peaked at 30 min, and declined to undetectable levels by 240 min. In the presence of cycloheximide, a greater increase in c-fos mRNA was seen by stretching. The transfected chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene linked to upstream sequences of the fos gene including its promoter was also activated by stretching cardiac myocytes. These results suggest that mechanical loading directly regulates gene transcription without the participation of humoral factors in cardiocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1549348777,"Assembly of the terminal complement proteins C5b-9 on human endothelial cells results in increased cytosolic calcium and nonlytic secretion of high molecular weight multimers of von Willebrand factor from intracellular storage granules. We now demonstrate that this C5b-9-induced secretory response is accompanied by vesiculation of membrane particles from the endothelial surface which express binding sites for factor Va and support prothrombinase activity. Exposure of factor Va binding sites after C5b-9 assembly was accompanied by greater than 2-fold increase in prothrombinase activity, which was not observed for cells exposed to C5b-8 (in the absence of C9). By contrast, only a 3-16% increase in prothrombinase activity was observed when these cells were maximally stimulated to secrete by either histamine, thrombin, or the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. Increased prothrombinase activity after C5b-9 was not accompanied by a change in thrombomodulin activity, and was unrelated to cell lysis, the complement-treated cells remaining greater than 99% viable. Endothelial prothrombinase activity was predominately associated with small membrane vesicles (less than 1 microns diameter) released from the cell monolayer. Analysis by fluorescence-gated flow cytometry revealed that these vesicles incorporate the C5b-9 proteins and express binding sites for factor Va. The capacity of the C5b-9 proteins to induce vesiculation of the endothelial plasma membrane and thereby expose catalytic surface for the prothrombinase enzyme complex may contribute to fibrin deposition associated with immune endothelial injury."
https://openalex.org/W1517753349,"A novel regulatory protein for smg p25A, a ras p21-like GTP-binding protein, was purified to near homogeneity from bovine brain cytosol. This regulatory protein, designated here as smg p25A GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI), inhibited the dissociation of GDP, but not of guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTPgamma S), from smg p25A. smg p25A GDI also inhibited the binding of GTPgamma S to the GDP-bound form of smg p25A but not of that to the guanine nucleotide-free form. GDI did not stimulate the GTPase activity of smg p25A and by itself showed neither GTPgammaS-binding nor GTPase activity. GDI was inactive for other ras p21/ras p21-like GTP-binding proteins including c-Ha-ras p21, rhoB p20, and smg p21. The Mr value of GDI was estimated to be about 54,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, about 65,000 from the S value (4.5 S), and about 82,000 by gel filtration. The isoelectric point of GDI was about pH 5.6. The activities of GDI were killed by tryptic digestion or heat boiling. These results indicate that bovine brain cytosol contains a regulatory protein for smg p25A that inhibits the dissociation of GDP from and thereby the subsequent binding of GTP to this protein."
https://openalex.org/W1987718027,"Expression of Ultrabithorax (UBX) proteins via a heat-inducible promoter generated homeotic transformations of segmental identities in the embryonic cuticle and peripheral nervous system (PNS) of Drosophila and transformed antennae into legs in the adult. The embryonic transformations were used to determine the identity functions of members of the UBX family and UBX mutant forms. Whereas UBX forms I and IV each induced the cuticle transformations, only form I induced the PNS transformations. Analysis of the transformations generated by UBX deletions and by a chimeric Ultrabithorax-Antennapedia protein demonstrated that the majority of the UBX identity information is contained within the C-terminal, homeodomain-containing portion of the protein. Implications of these results for how homeotic proteins select particular metameric identities are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2102431039,"Activation of human neutrophils by receptor-mediated agonists, the Ca2+ ionophore A23187, or the protein kinase C activator phorbol myristate acetate all stimulated phospholipase D activity. This was demonstrated by the increased formation of phosphatidic acid, and in the presence of ethanol, phosphatidylethanol (PEt) accumulation. EGTA completely inhibited A23187-induced PEt formation, but only one-half of the fMLP-induced PEt accumulation. Staurosporin, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, strongly inhibited PMA-induced PEt formation, but actually stimulated the formation of PEt in response to fMLP by several-fold. Thus, increased cytosolic Ca2+ and activated protein kinase C can each lead to activation of phospholipase D, but neither is required for receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase D activity. Wortmannin is an irreversible inhibitor of the oxidative burst, but does not inhibit NADPH oxidase or known components of signal transduction. Wortmannin inhibited activation of phospholipase D in response to fMPL. It did not directly inhibit phospholipase D, as the response to A23187 was unaffected. Wortmannin did not inhibit other fMPL-stimulated events, such as aggregation or adherence. We conclude that inhibition by wortmannin defines a third pathway to activation of phospholipase D. Further, its effect on phospholipase D correlates with its effect on the respiratory burst."
https://openalex.org/W1483404289,"A considerable fraction (65%) of single rat chromaffin cells loaded with the fluorescent [Ca2+]i indicator fura-2 exhibited spontaneous rhythmic fluctuations with an average period of approximately 100 s. Parallel patch clamp experiments as well as fura-2 experiments carried out in Ca2(+)-free and other modified media in the presence of Ca2+ and Na+ channel blockers indicated an origin from intracellular stores. Appropriate concentrations of agonists (bradykinin and histamine) for receptors (B2 and H1) that trigger generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate induced increased fluctuation frequency, recruitment of silent cells, and large [Ca2+]i changes at high doses. These effects were blocked by cell pretreatment with neomycin, a drug that inhibits inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate generation. In contrast, spontaneous fluctuations and the effects of another drug, caffeine, which also induced increased frequency and recruitment, were unaffected by neomycin. Ryanodine caused first a prolongation and then (approximately 10 min) a block of both spontaneous fluctuations and caffeine effects, where the single transients after bradykinin and histamine were maintained. Caffeine and ryanodine are known to affect selectively the process of calcium-induced Ca2+ release; this is the first demonstration of [Ca2+]i fluctuation activity arising from Ca2(+)-induced Ca2+ release in nonmuscle cells with no strict requirement for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate involvement."

https://openalex.org/W1591755807,"HeLa cells incubated in serum-free medium accumulated 59Fe (non-transferrin iron) when incubated with either 59Fe-citrate, 59Fe-nitrilotriacetate, or 59Fe dissolved in Tricine ascorbate. Accumulation of iron was time-, concentration-, and Ca2+-dependent and was saturable. Uptake of non-transferrin (non-Tf) iron was transferrin-independent because of the fact that uptake occurred at pH 5.5, a pH at which transferrin binds iron poorly and at which transferrin is not internalized by cells. Uptake of non-Tf iron was less affected than uptake of transferrin iron by 1) exposure of cells to trypsin, a maneuver that cleaves Tf receptors, or 2) incubation of cells with phenylarsine oxide, an agent that inhibits both fluid- and receptor-mediated internalization. After exposure of cells to non-Tf iron at 37 degrees C, most of the cell-associated radioactivity was recovered in heme and ferritin, demonstrating that iron gained access to intracellular compartments and was not simply adsorbed to the cell surface. Uptake of non-Tf iron could be partially blocked by Cu2+ in a dose-dependent manner, while the accumulation of transferrin-bound iron was unaffected by Cu2+. Other transition metals, such as Zn2+, Cd2+, and Mn2+ were able to inhibit the uptake of non-Tf iron to different degrees. The accumulation of 109Cd was inhibited by incubation of cells with non-Tf iron, Cu2+, or Mn2+. The extent of inhibition was concentration- and metal-dependent. A number of cultured cell lines including HeLa, human skin fibroblasts, and Chinese hamster ovary cells demonstrated uptake of non-Tf iron and 109Cd. Additionally, an endosome acidification mutant of Chinese hamster ovary cells, which exhibited an increase in non-Tf iron uptake, also exhibited an increase in the uptake of Cd2+. These observations suggest that the characteristics of the non-Tf iron transport system in HeLa cells are similar if not identical to those reported for perfused rat liver (Wright, T. L., Brissot, P., Ma, W.-L., and Weisiger, P. A. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 10909-10914) and suggest the existence of a family of transition metal transport systems, each with a different metal specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1533354213,"The three-dimensional structure of human erythrocytic purine nucleoside phosphorylase has been determined at 3.2 A resolution using x-ray diffraction data. Intensity data were measured using radiation from the Synchrotron Radiation Source, Daresbury, England, and oscillation film techniques. Phases were determined by using multiple isomorphous replacement methods with four heavy-atom derivatives and were improved using solvent flattening techniques. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase exists in the crystal as a trimer in which subunits are related by a crystallographic 3-fold axis. Each subunit contains an eight-stranded mixed beta-sheet and a five-stranded mixed beta-sheet which join to form a distorted beta-barrel structure. This core beta-structure is flanked by seven alpha-helices in a manner that generates a novel folding pattern. The active site, which was characterized from binding of the substrate analogs 8-iodoguanine and 5'-iodoformycin B, is located near the subunit-subunit boundary within the trimer and involves seven different segments from one subunit and an additional short segment from an adjacent subunit. In the crystal, the phosphate-binding site is probably occupied by a sulfate ion. The specificity of purine nucleoside phosphorylase for guanine, hypoxanthine, and their analogs can be explained on the basis of the arrangement of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors in the active site."
https://openalex.org/W1558579604,"AP-1, the polypeptide product of c-jun, recognizes and binds to specific DNA sequences and stimulates transcription of genes responsive to certain growth factors and phorbol esters such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). We studied the effects of TPA on the regulation of c-jun gene expression in HL-60 cells during monocytic differentiation. Low levels of c-jun transcripts were detectable in untreated HL-60 leukemic cells, increased significantly by 6 h, and reached near maximal levels by 24 h of exposure to 32 nM TPA. Similar kinetics of c-jun induction by TPA were observed in human U-937 and THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells. Similar findings were obtained with bryostatin 1 (10 nM), another activator of protein kinase C and inducer of monocytic differentiation. Furthermore, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (0.5 microM), a structurally distinct agent which also induces HL-60 monocytic differentiation, increased c-jun expression. TPA treatment of HL-60 cells in the presence of cycloheximide was associated with superinduction of c-jun transcripts. Run-on analysis demonstrated detectable levels of c-jun gene transcription in untreated HL-60 cells, and that exposure to TPA increases this rate 3.3-fold. Treatment of HL-60 cells with both TPA and cycloheximide had no effect on the rates of c-jun transcription. The half-life of c-jun RNA as determined by treating HL-60 cells with TPA and actinomycin D was 30 min. In contrast, the half-life of c-jun RNA in TPA-treated HL-60 cells exposed to cycloheximide and actinomycin D was greater than 2 h. These findings suggested that the increase in c-jun RNA observed during TPA-induced monocytic differentiation is mediated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1488433029,"The biochemical properties of three stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G-protein) alpha subunits, the large and small forms of Gs, Gs-l (52 kDa) and Gs-s (45 kDa), and the olfactory specific G-protein, Golf, have been compared. Complementary DNAs (cDNAs) encoding each alpha subunit were independently expressed in a mammalian cell line deficient in endogenous stimulatory G-proteins (S49 cyc-kin-). Gs-l and Gs-s respond similarly to activation by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (EC50 = 80 and 60 nM, respectively) and the receptor-independent G-protein activators guanosine 5-O-3-(thio)triphosphate) (GTP gamma S) and AlF-4. The ability of Golf to interact with the beta-adrenergic receptor was also examined. Surprisingly, Golf interacts with beta-adrenergic receptors and is activated by isoproterenol (EC50 = 120 nM). All three G-proteins respond similarly to treatment with different alpha, beta, and gamma thiophosphoryl analogs of GTP. Specifically, (R)-GTP alpha S and GTP gamma S activate each G-protein, whereas (S)-GTP alpha S and (R)- or (S)-GTP beta S are inactive. In addition, similar to Gs alpha, Golf alpha is covalently modified and constitutively activated by cholera toxin. These studies demonstrate that all three stimulatory G-proteins are functionally and structurally similar, however, subtle differences between Golf and the two forms of Gs appear to modulate their interactions with receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1552183064,"Site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace the serine residue at the primary phosphorylation site of human eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E with an alanine residue. The mutated cDNA was transcribed in vitro, and the transcript was used to direct protein synthesis in a reticulocyte lysate system. The variant protein (eIF-4EAla) was retained on a 7-methylguanosine 5'-triphosphate (m7GTP)-Sepharose affinity column and was specifically eluted by m7GTP. Examination of eIF-4EAla by isoelectric focusing revealed two species which had the same pI values as the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of unaltered eIF-4E (here designated eIF-4ESer). However, conversion of unphosphorylated eIF-4EAla to the putative phosphorylated eIF-4EAla in the reticulocyte lysate system was slower than the corresponding conversion of eIF-4ESer. The possibility that the more acidic form of eIF-4EAla was due to NH2-terminal acetylation was ruled out by an experiment in which the acetyl-CoA pool of the reticulocyte lysate system was depleted with oxaloacetate and citrate synthase. The more acidic form of eIF-4EAla was, however, eliminated by treatment with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase, suggesting that it results from a second-site phosphorylation. When translation reaction mixtures were resolved on sucrose density gradients, the 35S-labeled eIF-4ESer was found on the 48 S initiation complex in the presence of guanylyl imidodiphosphate, as reported earlier (Hiremath, L.S., Hiremath, S.T., Rychlik, W., Joshi, S., Domier, L.L., and Rhoads, R.E. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 1132-1138). eIF-4EAla, by contrast, was not found on the 48 S complex, suggesting that phosphorylation of eIF-4E is necessary for it to carry out its role of transferring mRNA to the 48 S complex. Supporting this interpretation was the finding that eIF-4ESer isolated from 48 S initiation complexes consisted predominantly of the phosphorylated form."
https://openalex.org/W1552857477,"T cell receptor signaling has been implicated in an intrathymic process of cell selection in which potentially harmful autoreactive precursors are deleted before they emigrate to the periphery. Recent work has shown that immature thymocytes undergo apoptosis, or programmed cell death, upon stimulation via the T cell antigen receptor, and it has been suggested that this mechanism may mediate deletion of the self-reactive clones during T cell development. Here we report that the accessory cell-derived T cell growth hormone interleukin-1 prevents T cell receptor-mediated thymocyte apoptosis by a mechanism that appears to involve protein kinase C activation. This effect may be relevant to the positive signaling that spares the appropriate precursors during the generation of functional T lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1512819401,"Previously, we have shown that prostaglandins are necessary, but not sufficient, for the stimulation of mitogenesis in BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts by epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Nolan, R. D., Danilowicz, R. M., and Eling, T. E. (1988) Mol. Pharmacol. 33, 650-656). The purpose of this work was to extend these findings to another potent mitogen, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and to determine if metabolism of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins is necessary for stimulation of expression of the protooncogene c-myc by EGF, which is an early event in the mitogenic cascade. In BALB/c 3T3 cells grown to about 70% confluence and deprived of serum for 16-24 h, PDGF stimulated [3H]thymidine uptake into DNA significantly in a concentration-dependent manner, but did not increase production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The addition of indomethacin, a prostaglandin H synthase inhibitor, or nordihydroguaiaretic acid, a lipoxygenase inhibitor, did not affect PDGF-stimulated thymidine uptake into DNA. In addition, PGE2 enhanced EGF-dependent, but not PDGF-dependent, mitogenesis. Taken together, the data support the hypothesis that prostaglandins are not involved in PDGF-dependent mitogenesis. In contrast, indomethacin (10(-6) M) and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (10(-6) M) inhibited EGF-stimulated thymidine uptake and c-myc expression by approximately 50%. Addition of PGG2 (10(-7) to 10(-5) M) in the presence of indomethacin and EGF restored the ability of EGF to elevate c-myc RNA levels and DNA synthesis. When PGF2 alpha (10(-8) to 10(-5) M) was added in the presence of EGF, c-myc RNA levels and thymidine incorporation were elevated up to 5-6-fold above levels observed with EGF alone. These data support the hypothesis that metabolism of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins is necessary for stimulation of c-myc expression by EGF in BALB/c 3T3 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1556281391,"The major sites of serine and threonine phosphorylation of the human epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor observed in intact cells are Thr654, Thr669, Ser1046, and Ser1047. Phosphorylation of the EGF receptor is increased at these sites in cells treated with platelet-derived growth factor or phorbol ester. This increase in EGF receptor phosphorylation is associated with an inhibition of the high affinity binding of EGF to cell surface receptors and an inhibition of the receptor tyrosine protein kinase activity. In order to test the hypothesis that the phosphorylation of the EGF receptor is mechanistically related to the modulation of EGF receptor function, we replaced the major sites of serine and threonine phosphorylation with alanine residues. EGF receptors containing single point mutations or multiple mutations were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Analysis of the regulation of the EGF receptor tyrosine protein kinase activity demonstrated that phorbol ester caused an inhibition of the tyrosine phosphorylation of wild-type receptors and receptors lacking Thr669, Ser1046, or Ser1047. In contrast, the inhibition of EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation caused by phorbol ester was not observed for any of the mutated EGF receptors that lacked Thr654. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the phosphorylation of the EGF receptor at Thr654 is required for the inhibition of the receptor tyrosine protein kinase activity caused by phorbol ester. Investigation of the apparent affinity of the EGF receptor demonstrated that treatment with phorbol ester caused an inhibition of the high affinity binding of 125I-EGF to cells expressing wild-type EGF receptors and each of the mutated EGF receptors examined. We conclude that the regulation of the apparent affinity of the EGF receptor is independent of the major sites of serine and threonine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1514368042,"We have used S1 and primer extension analysis to demonstrate that the gene for bovine beta 1----4-galactosyltransferase specifies two sets of mRNA transcripts of different lengths. The longer mRNA transcripts initiate upstream of two in-frame ATG codons and encode a protein of 402 amino acids (long form). The shorter mRNA transcripts initiate between the two in-frame ATG codons and encode a protein of 389 amino acids (short form). These two related forms of beta 1----4-galactosyltransferase have an identical large (358 amino acids), potentially glycosylated, COOH-terminal catalytic domain, and an identical single transmembrane domain. The only difference in primary structure between the two forms is that the long form contains an NH2-terminal extension of 13 amino acids. Thus, bovine beta 1----4-galactosyltransferase fits the pattern established for murine beta 1----4-galactosyltransferase (Shaper, N. L., Hollis, G. L., Douglas, J. G., Kirsch, I. R., and Shaper, J. H. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 10420-10428). Inspection of the NH2-terminal domain suggests that the long form of the bovine enzyme, like its murine counterpart, has a functional cleavable signal sequence which would dictate that the two forms of the membrane-bound enzyme are oriented in opposite directions. We have tested this hypothesis by in vitro translation in the absence or presence of dog pancreas microsomes. In vitro translation of RNA transcripts for the long and short form of beta 1----4-galactosyltransferase in the absence of microsomes results in the synthesis of polypeptides with apparent Mr of 44,500 and 43,000, respectively. In vitro translation of each transcript in the presence of microsomes results in the synthesis of two glycosylated, endoglycosidase H-sensitive proteins with apparent Mr of 47,500 and 46,000. These experiments and additional protease protection experiments demonstrate that the COOH-terminal domain of both the short and the long form of bovine beta 1----4-galactosyltransferase are translocated into the microsomal lumen. By extrapolation, both forms of the enzyme are oriented in vivo as Type II membrane-bound glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1602881906,"The relationship between cytosolic free Ca2+, mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP depletion, pyridine nucleotide fluorescence, cell surface blebbing, and cell death was evaluated in rat hepatocytes exposed to HgCl2. In cell suspensions, 50 microM HgCl2 oxidized pyridine nucleotides between 1/2 and 2 min, caused ATP depletion between 2 and 5 min, and produced an 89% loss of cell viability after 20 min. Rates of cell killing were identical in high (1.2 mM) and low (2.6 microM) Ca2+ buffers. Cytosolic free Ca2+ was determined in 1-day cultured hepatocytes by ratio imaging of Fura-2 employing multiparameter digitized video microscopy. In high Ca2+ medium, HgCl2 caused a 3-4-fold increase of free Ca2+ beginning after 6-7 min, but free Ca2+ did not change in low Ca2+ medium. Bleb formation occurred after about 4-5 min in both buffers prior to any increase of free Ca2+. Subsequently, in high Ca2+ medium, blebs became hot spots of free Ca2+ (greater than 600 nM). After about 2 min of exposure to HgCl2, rhodamine 123 fluorescence redistributed from mitochondrial to cytosolic compartments signifying collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential. The results taken together demonstrate that bleb formation, ATP depletion, and the onset of cell death are not dependent on an increase of cytosolic free Ca2+. HgCl2 toxicity appears to be a consequence of inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation leading to ATP depletion and cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1591943330,"The alpha-aminoboronic acid analog of proline has been synthesized and incorporated into a number of peptides as the COOH-terminal residue. These peptide prolyl boronic acids are potent inhibitors of both the type 1 and type 2 IgA proteinases from Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Hemophilus influenzae, but not of the functionally similar IgA proteinase from Streptococcus sanguis. The best inhibitors synthesized thus far have Ki values in the nanomolar range (4.0 to 60 nM). These results indicate that the N. gonorrhoeae and the H. influenzae enzymes belong to the serine protease family of proteolytic enzymes while that from S. sanguis does not. As a group, the IgA proteinases have been noted for their remarkable specificity; thus, the peptide prolyl boronic acids reported here are the first small synthetic molecules to exhibit a relatively high affinity for the active site of an IgA proteinase and are therefore the first to yield some insight into the active site structure and specificity requirements of these enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1507437210,"Several proteins in mammalian cells are modified post-translationally by the isoprenoid, farnesol. Incubation of cultured cells with [3H]mevalonate, an isoprenoid precursor, results in the labeling of multiple polypeptides, the most prominent of which migrate in the range of 21-26 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. In Rat-6 fibroblasts transformed by H-ras, one of the farnesylated proteins was identified as p21ras by two-dimensional immunoblotting. However, this protein accounted for only a small proportion of the [3H]mevalonate-derived radioactivity incorporated into 21-26-kDa proteins. Murine erythroleukemia cells, which did not express immunodetectable quantities of p21ras, contained several 21-26-kDa farnesylated proteins distributed in both the cytosolic and particulate fractions. At least eight of these proteins were capable of binding [alpha-32P]GTP on nitrocellulose membranes. Pulse-chase studies showed that the isoprenoid modification did not necessarily result in the translocation of the cytosolic proteins to the cell membrane. A prominent group of carboxyl-methylated proteins in murine erythroleukemia cells overlapped with the 21-26-kDa farnesylated proteins on one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate gels. Methylation of this group of proteins was selectively abolished when cells were treated with lovastatin, an inhibitor of isoprenoid synthesis. Addition of exogenous mevalonate to the lovastatin-treated cells fully restored carboxyl methylation. These studies suggest that the 21-26-kDa farnesylated proteins in mammalian cells are members of a recently discovered family of low molecular mass GTP-binding proteins which, although ras-related, appear to be distinct structurally and possibly functionally from the products of the ras genes. The observed isoprenoid-dependent carboxyl methylation of a group of 21-26-kDa proteins suggests that the low molecular mass GTP-binding proteins may undergo a series of post-translational C-terminal cysteine modifications (i.e. farnesylation, carboxyl methylation) analogous to those recently elucidated for p21ras."
https://openalex.org/W1520080677,"To trace the route of Ca2+ entry and the role of the cytosolic Ca2+ pool in reloading of the internal stores of pancreatic acinar cells, Mn2+ influx into Fura 2-loaded cells and the effect of 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxyethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) on Ca2+ storage in intracellular stores and reloading were examined. Treatment of acini suspended in Ca2(+)-free medium with carbachol (cell stimulation) or carbachol and atropine (reloading period) resulted in 2-fold increase in the rate of Mn2+ influx. Increasing Ca2+ permeability of the plasma membrane by elevation of extracellular pH from 7.4 to 8.2 further increased the rate of Mn2+ influx observed during cell stimulation and the reloading period. Loading the acini with BAPTA by incubation with 50 microM of the acetomethoxy form of BAPTA (BAPTA/AM) was followed by a transient reduction in free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ((Ca2+]i). To compensate for the increased Ca2+ buffering capacity in the cytosol the acini incorporated Ca2+ from the external medium. Although BAPTA prevented changes in free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration during carbachol and atropine treatment, it had no apparent effect on Ca2+ content of the internal stores or the ability of agonists to release Ca2+ from these stores. Loading the cytosol with BAPTA considerably reduced the rate of Ca2+ reloading. These observations are not compatible with direct communication between the medium and the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate releasable pool and provide direct evidence for Ca2+ entry into the cytosol prior to its uptake into the intracellular pool, both during cell stimulation and the Ca2+ reloading."
https://openalex.org/W1543374781,"The larval fat body of newly eclosed adults of Drosophila melanogaster was found to contain a single major binding protein specific for juvenile hormone (JH). Binding to this protein was saturable, of high affinity, and specific for JH III. The protein has a subunit molecular weight (Mr) of 85,000, as determined by photoaffinity labeling. The same or similar JH-binding protein was found in larval fat body and cuticle of third instar larvae and in male accessory glands and heads of newly eclosed adults. It was not found in several other tissues in adults. Male accessory gland cytosol from wild-type flies was found to contain a single binder with a dissociation constant (KD) of 6.7 nM for JH III; a binder in similar preparations from the methoprene-tolerant (Met) mutant had a KD value 6-fold higher. JH III stimulated protein synthesis in glands cultured in vitro, but this effect was reduced in Met flies as compared to wild-type flies, establishing a correlation between JH binding and biological activity of the hormone. In addition, glandular protein accumulation during the first 2 days of adult development was less in Met flies than in wild-type flies. These results strongly suggest that the binding protein we have identified mediates this JH effect in male accessory glands and thus is acting as a JH receptor."

A plasmid with the rnc gene under PL control expresses RNase III at levels greater than 40% of total cellular protein. Another plasmid with the era gene under PL control and a modified translation-initiation signal produces up to 80% of total cell protein as Era. Each protein has been purified using simple and rapid procedures. Purified RNase III protein specifically processes mRNA transcripts containing known RNase III sites. The purified Era protein binds GDP and GTP and has GTPase activity. Kinetic analysis shows that one molecule of GTP or GDP is bound/Era peptide with a Kd of 5.5 microM for GTP binding and 1.0 microM for GDP binding. The Km of the Era GTPase is 9.0 microM, and the maximum catalyzed rate of GTP hydrolyzed/min/mol of Era protein at 37 degrees C is 9.8 mmol."
https://openalex.org/W1540094838,"Type beta transforming growth factor (TGF-beta) is a multifunctional regulator of cell growth and differentiation. In the BC3H1 muscle cell line, TGF-beta blocks the onset of differentiation when added to undifferentiated myoblasts and causes dedifferentiation when added to fully differentiated myocytes. The goal of the present study was to determine whether TGF-beta-dependent repression of muscle-specific genes was preceded by modulation in expression of members of the jun proto-oncogene family, which function as growth factor-inducible transcription factors. junB mRNA was expressed at a basal level in differentiated BC3H1 myocytes. Within 15 min following exposure of myocytes to TGF-beta, junB mRNA began to accumulate; a peak of expression 20-fold above basal levels was observed after 2 h with a gradual decline thereafter. Nuclear run-on transcription assays showed that induction of junB by TGF-beta occurred at the level of transcription through a mechanism independent of protein synthesis. junB was also induced by 20% fetal bovine serum, platelet-derived growth factor, and insulin, but the maximal level of expression in response to these growth factors was lower and less sustained than in the presence of TGF-beta. In contrast to the dramatic effects of TGF-beta on junB expression, c-jun showed only a 2.5-fold increase in expression in response to TGF-beta. In an effort to identify additional members of the jun family which might be regulated by TGF-beta, a cDNA library was prepared from the poly(A)+ mRNA of TGF-beta-stimulated BC3H1 myocytes and was screened under conditions of reduced stringency with a v-jun DNA probe. From this screen, a new jun-related gene product was identified which shared a high degree of homology with regions of c-jun and junB which have been implicated in transcriptional activation, dimerization, and DNA binding. The transcript for this jun-related gene was expressed constitutively in BC3H1 cells and was not regulated by TGF-beta. Three members of the jun family thus exhibit distinct responses to TGF-beta in BC3H1 cells. The rapid transcriptional induction of junB is among the earliest and most dramatic responses to TGF-beta yet described and suggests that junB may mediate certain of the diverse biological effects of this growth factor."
https://openalex.org/W1585390765,"The specificity of thermopsin, a thermostable acid protease from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, was studied using oxidized insulin B chain as substrate followed by peptide isolation and identification. The following bonds were hydrolyzed: Leu-Val, Leu-Tyr, Phe-Phe, Phe-Tyr, and Tyr-Thr. Thus, the specificity of thermopsin is similar to that of pepsin, that is, it prefers large hydrophobic residues at both sides of the scissile bond. We confirmed this by the use of a synthetic substrate, Lys-Pro-Ala-Glu-Phe-p-nitro-phenylalanyl-Ala-Leu, which was cleaved by thermopsin between Phe and p-nitro-phenylalanyl. Using this substrate, enzyme inhibition and kinetic properties of thermopsin have been studied. Thermopsin optimally hydrolyzes this substrate at 75 degrees C and pH 2 with Km and kcat values under these conditions of 5.3 x 10(-5) M and 14.3 s-1, respectively. Pepstatin competitively inhibits thermopsin with a Ki of 2 x 10(-7) M. Other known aspartic protease inhibitors, diazoacetylnorleucine ethyl ester and 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)propane inhibited thermopsin only slowly and with nonspecific reactions. Although thermopsin contains a single cysteine, iodoacetic acid and p-chloromercuric benzoate had no effect on activity. Mercuric chloride inhibited the enzyme, and the inhibition was reversible by mercaptoethanol. However, the enzyme was not labeled by [14C]iodoacetic acid either before or after sodium dodecyl sulfate denaturation. Thus, the thiol group is likely blocked, and the inhibition effect of mercuric ion is unrelated to the thiol group. These observations suggest that thermopsin has a different active site than the aspartic protease family but may have a similar transition state structure. The temperature dependence of Km and kcat was studied for thermopsin hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate between 26-78 degrees C. Both parameters increased with temperature, and the rise of kcat value was particularly sharp above 65 degrees C. Hydrolysis activity measured at high substrate concentration has a maximum at 76 degrees C, which is near the physiological temperature for the optimal growth of this organism. Thus, thermopsin appears to function best at high temperature and high substrate concentration. It may be utilized by the organism to response to the presence of high substrate concentration in the medium. Thermopsin is also competitively inhibited by urea, acetamide, and phenylalaninamide with Ki values of 0.5, 0.4, and 0.01 M, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1578237164,"We reported the presence of a new trisaccharide composed of two xylose and reducing terminal glucose residues linked to serine residues of bovine blood clotting factors VII and IX (Hase, S., Kawabata, S., Nishimura, H., Takeya, H., Sueyoshi, T., Miyata, T., Iwanaga, S., Takao, T., Shimonishi, Y., and Ikenaka, T. (1988) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 104, 867-868). The present paper describes the detailed structural analysis of the trisaccharide. Glycopeptides were prepared from bovine factor IX by digestion with Pronase followed by purification by column chromatography. The trisaccharide was released from the protein by the beta-elimination reaction with hydrazine, and the reducing end of the sugar chain was tagged with 2-aminopyridine. The fluorescent pyridylamino derivative of the trisaccharide was purified by gel filtration and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The glycopeptides and pyridylamino-trisaccharide thus obtained were subjected to methylation study, 500-MHz 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and periodate oxidation. Glucose and xylose belong to the D series by high performance liquid chromatography on a chiral column. From the results, the structure of the trisaccharide is proposed as: D-Xyl p alpha 1-3-D-Xyl p alpha 1-3-D-Glcp beta 1-O-Ser-53."
https://openalex.org/W1602213783,"The binding of small molecules to the kringle 5 domain fragment of human plasminogen has been investigated by 1H NMR spectroscopy at 300 MHz. The compounds tested as potential ligands include L-arginine, L-lysine, and a number of aliphatic and aromatic analogs of similar size but different ionic charge configurations. Ligand/kringle 5 association constant (Ka) values were obtained from ligand titration experiments at 22 degrees C, pH 7.2. Neither L-arginine nor N alpha-acetyl-L-arginine and N alpha-acetyl-L-arginine methyl ester bind measurably to kringle 5 (Ka approximately less than 0.05 mM-1). In contrast, binding of hexylamine or epsilon-aminocaproic acid (epsilon ACA) is favored (Ka approximately 2.9 and 10.5 mM-1, respectively). Benzamidine and p-benzylaminesulfonic acid associate with kringle 5 with similar affinities (Ka approximately 3.4 and 2.2 mM-1, respectively) while benzylamine binds about twice as tightly (Ka approximately 6.3 mM-1). The higher affinities toward both benzylamine and epsilon ACA indicate that a free carboxylate group is not, by itself, a main determinant of ligand-binding to kringle 5. The experiments also reveal a definite affinity for L-arginine methyl ester, L-lysine, and N alpha-acetyl-L-lysine methyl ester. It is suggested that, although weak (0.1 approximately less than Ka approximately less than 0.6 mM-1), these interactions could be of physiological relevance in the context of plasminogen binding to the fibrin clot. Ligand-induced shifts of kringle 5 proton resonances indicate that the Trp25, His33, Tyr50, Trp62, and Tyr72 (kringle numbering convention) side chains form or neighbor the kringle 5-binding site. Benzamidine-kringle 5 magnetization transfer (Overhauser) experiments verify a close proximity of the bound ligand to these aromatic groups. A model of the binding site is proposed in which the above residues interact closely with each other and define a lipophilic surface which is accessible to the free ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1480397292,"The nature of the interaction between the enveloped DNA-containing poxviruses and the surfaces of host cells as a first step in virus infection is not known. In this investigation we have identified and defined structural and functional properties of a 32-kDa protein of vaccinia virus. This protein is part of the virus envelope and binds to the cell surface of various cultured cells. The gene encoding the 32-kDa viral protein was mapped and sequenced. It was found to code a 35,426-Da protein with a large N-terminal domain with sequence homology to carbonic anhydrases and a C-terminal domain with sequences similar to those of the attachment glycoprotein VP7 of rotavirus and to transmembrane proteins. A potential cell surface binding domain was within the last 50 amino acid residues of the C terminus. The 32-kDa protein is basic, predicted pI 8.67, is synthesized at late times post-infection, may form dimers held by disulfide bonds at the single cysteine 262, and is apparently non-glycosylated. The 32-kDa protein is a vaccinia virus antigen, with predicted antigenic sites located near amino acids 108-110 (carbonic anhydrase domain) and 298-299 (transmembrane domain). Several lines of evidence suggest that the 32-kDa protein is needed for efficient virus replication in cultured cells but that in addition to this protein other viral proteins are involved in the process of virus entry into cells."
https://openalex.org/W1553866416,"Combined lipase deficiency (cld) is a recessive mutation which causes a severe deficiency of lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase activities and lethal hypertriacylglycerolemia within 3 days in newborn mice. The effect of this genetic defect on lipoprotein lipase was studied in primary cultures of brown adipocytes derived from tissue of newborn mice. Cells cultured from cld/cld mice replicated, accumulated triacylglycerol, and differentiated into adipocytes at normal rates. Lipoprotein lipase activity in unaffected cells was detectable on Day 0 of confluence and increased to 1.3 units/mg DNA by Day 6, while that in cld/cld cells was less than 4% of that in unaffected cells on Days 4-6. Unaffected cells released 1.2% of their lipase activity in 30 min in the absence of heparin, and 11% in 10 min in the presence of heparin, whereas cld/cld cells released no lipase activity. cld/cld cells contained 2-3 times as much lipoprotein lipase protein as unaffected cells, and released no lipase protein to the medium. Immunofluorescent lipoprotein lipase was not detectable in unaffected adipocytes unless lipase secretion was blocked with monesin, causing retention of the lipase in Golgi. cld/cld adipocytes, in contrast, contained immunofluorescent lipoprotein lipase distributed in a diffuse reticular pattern, indicating retention of lipase in endoplasmic reticulum. Lipoprotein lipase immunoprecipitated from cells incubated 1-3 h with [35S]methionine was digested with or without endoglycosidase H (endo H) or F, and resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Lipoprotein lipase in unaffected cells (Mr = 56,000-58,000) consisted of three glycosylated forms, of which the most prevalent was endo H-resistant, the next was totally endo H-sensitive, and the least was partially endo H-sensitive. In contrast, lipoprotein lipase in cld/cld cells (Mr = 56,000) consisted of a single, totally endo H-sensitive form. Lipoprotein lipase in both groups of cells contained two oligosaccharide chains. Chromatography studies with heparin-Sepharose indicated that at least some of the lipoprotein lipase in cld/cld cells was dimerized. The findings demonstrate that brown adipocytes cultured from cld/cld mice synthesize lipoprotein lipase with two high mannose oligosaccharide chains, but it is inactive and retained in endoplasmic reticulum. Whether the cld mutation affects primarily processing of oligosaccharide chains of lipoprotein lipase in endoplasmic reticulum, transport of the lipase from the reticulum, or some other process, is to be resolved."
https://openalex.org/W1493347191,"Two transport systems for L-arginine were evident in Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120: a high-affinity one (Km, 1.7 microM) that accumulated arginine within the cells through an energy-requiring process and another one that exhibited low affinity for L-arginine (Km, 0.75 mM) and was unable to accumulate the substrate. Both systems were inhibited by L-canavanine, L-lysine, and L-ornithine. Two systems were also evident for L-lysine uptake (Km, 1.9 and 110 microM, respectively). After selection for resistance to canavanine or hydroxylysine, independent mutants were isolated which were impaired in the high-affinity uptake of arginine and lysine. A common permease appears, therefore, to be involved in the high-affinity transport of these basic amino acids. Both the high- and the low-affinity systems can contribute to the growth of Anabaena sp. on L-arginine. However, arginine did not effectively repress either nitrogenase or nitrate reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1587571103,"The role of protein kinase C (PKC) in mediating nerve growth factor (NGF) or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-stimulated SCG10 and c-fos expression as well as neurite outgrowth was studied in PC12 cells. Activators of PKC such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or 1-oleoyl 2-acetyl glycerol mimicked the stimulatory effect of NGF and bFGF on SCG10 mRNA levels. Induction involved a protein synthesis-dependent mechanism and was maximal within 12-24 h of exposure. Chronic treatment of the cells with PMA for up to 8 days resulted in a substantial decrease (approximately 90%) in total PKC activity in the continued presence of PMA. PKC depletion did not affect NGF- or bFGF-stimulated SCG10 mRNA induction and bFGF-stimulated c-fos mRNA induction. However, NGF-stimulated c-fos mRNA induction was attenuated. In addition, induction of neurite outgrowth was not abolished in PKC-depleted cells. The results imply that PKC is not involved in NGF- and bFGF-stimulated SCG10 mRNA induction and neurite outgrowth. Furthermore, while the effect of bFGF on c-fos mRNA induction is PKC-independent, that of NGF is mediated by PKC-dependent and -independent pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1664837058,"The formation and release of covalent complexes between tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) limits the application of equilibrium radioligand binding analysis to characterize the interaction between t-PA and human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) monolayers. To avoid this difficulty, we used a recombinant mutant of t-PA, S478A rt-PA, in which alanine has been substituted for the active-site serine. Although the mutant is incapable of covalently reacting with PAI-1, 125I-labeled S478A rt-PA binding to HUVEC monolayers is specific and reversible and is characterized by a high affinity (Kd of 1.5 nM) and a large number of sites (1.5 x 10(6)/cell). This binding was shown to occur through noncovalent interaction with PAI-1 in the HUVEC monolayer by the fact that a monoclonal anti-PAI-1 antibody (MA-7D4) completely blocked S478A rt-PA binding. Two solution-phase assays with recombinant PAI-1 (rPAI-1) confirmed this noncovalent interaction: complexes between 125I-S478A rt-PA and rPAI-1 could be isolated by immunoprecipitation with anti-PAI-1 antibodies, and S478A rt-PA competed with rt-PA for inactivation by rPAI-1. In contrast diisopropylphosphate rt-PA (in which the active site serine is chemically modified) showed minimal binding to HUVEC monolayers, as a result of impaired interaction with PAI-1, in the two assays. Thus, both wild-type rt-PA and S478A rt-PA interact with the HUVEC monolayer through PAI-1. With rt-PA this results in the formation of covalent rt-PA.PAI-1 complexes that are released from the monolayer into the supernatant. With S478A rt-PA this results in the formation of noncovalent complexes that remain associated with the HUVEC monolayer, thereby identifying a large pool of reactive PAI-1 molecules in the monolayer."
https://openalex.org/W1602072399,"Several groups have demonstrated that radioiodinated tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) binds to saturable sites on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in culture (Hajjar, K. A., Hamel, N. M., Harpel, P. C., and Nachman, R. L. (1987) J. Clin. Invest. 80, 1712-1719; Beebe, D. P. (1987) Thromb. Res. 46, 241-254; Barnathan, E. S., Kuo, A., van der Keyl, H., McCrae, K. R., Larsen, G. L., and Cines, D. B. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 7792-7799). Here we report that most of the specific binding of 125I-t-PA to our HUVEC cultures is accounted for by binding to (i) plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1), a t-PA inhibitor produced in abundance by HUVECs; and (ii) specific binding sites present on the plastic culture surface. The contribution of the sites on plastic can be eliminated by taking several precautions. Then, most or all of the specifically bound 125I-t-PA is present in a sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable 110-kDa 125I-t-PA.PAI-1 complex. Interestingly, a radioiodinated mutant form of t-PA, S478A, which is catalytically inactive and therefore unable to form the covalent complex with PAI-1, still binds to HUVECs. In fact, this ligand binds to HUVECs in 10-30-fold greater amounts than does wild-type 125I-t-PA (resulting in greater than 1 x 10(7) S478A 125I-t-PA molecules bound/cell at 12 nM ligand concentration). In contrast, diisopropyl fluorophosphate-treated t-PA binds to HUVECs in much smaller amounts than does wild-type t-PA. Several findings suggest that PAI-1 is a major binding site for S478A t-PA. The vast amount of binding observed with S478A t-PA, compared with wild-type t-PA, may be accounted for by an observed large scale release of wild-type 125I-t-PA.PAI-1 complexes from the solid phase (cells or extracellular matrix) into the culture medium. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that, in contrast to wild-type t-PA, S478A t-PA does not extract [35S]methionine-PAI antigen from metabolically labeled extracellular matrix. It is proposed that t-PA releases PAI-1 from the solid phase when it forms the irreversible covalent complex with the inhibitor, a process that does not occur with the catalytically inactive mutant form of t-PA."
https://openalex.org/W1624044342,"The properties of RAS2Gly19----Val and RAS2Thr152----Ile, two mutants suppressing the CDC25 requirement for the activation of adenylate cyclase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, were compared with the properties of wild-type RAS2. We examined (a) the guanine nucleotide interaction, (b) the intrinsic GTPase (EC 3.6.1-) activity, and (c) the ability to activate adenylate cyclase in vitro. The low GTPase of RAS2Val19 is associated with an increased stability of the GTP complex. By contrast, RAS2Ile152 shows a strong destabilization of the GDP complex (the dissociation rate constants of the RAS2Ile152.GDP complex is enhanced almost 50 times) and an increased GTPase activity. Remarkably, all the parameters of the interaction with GDP and GTP as well as the catalytic activity are modified by the two mutations in an opposite manner. Our kinetic results show that the functional modifications of RAS2 compensating for the CDC25 inactivation can not only be associated with the presence of a long-lived RAS2.GTP complex, but also with a rapid GDP to GTP exchange reaction. As a striking result, the functional modifications induced by Thr152----Ile activate the adenylate cyclase in vitro much more efficiently than those induced by Gly19----Val. This stresses the importance of a rapid regeneration of the RAS2.GTP complex for the activation of the adenylate cyclase pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1516759969,"Coagulation factors V and VIII are substrates for activated protein C. Binding sites for the protease have been localized to homologous sequences within the terminal A domains of these proteins. Since ceruloplasmin contains significant sequence homology to these domains, a study was undertaken to determine whether ceruloplasmin was an activated protein C-binding protein. Ceruloplasmin was observed to inhibit the activated protein C-catalyzed inactivation of both factor Va and factor VIII. Searches of the ceruloplasmin sequence revealed a decapeptide sequence, HAGMETTYTV (residues 1028-1037) that shares 60 and 40% sequence identity with the activated protein C binding sequence in factors VIII and V, respectively. This peptide also inhibited factor Va inactivation and in addition was observed to enhance the amidolytic activity of activated protein C. The ferrous oxidase activity of ceruloplasmin was stimulated 5-fold by activated protein C, and this effect was negated by the peptide HAGMETTYTV. These results indicate that these conserved sequences of ceruloplasmin and factors V and VIII interact with activated protein C and suggest that this region may be important in the regulation of this anticoagulant protein."

NMR analysis of the two purified compounds with single molecular species showed that the chemical shifts of anomeric protons of GalNAc were significantly different between threonine- and serine-linked GalNAc. Neither mannose-containing glycopeptides nor glycosphingolipids were excreted in the patient urine. From these results, this disease is thought to be caused by the deficiency of a lysosomal enzyme(s) acting on O-linked glycan chains."
https://openalex.org/W1557241738,"Two Escherichia coli lactose carrier mutants (tyrosine or phenylalanine substituted for histidine 322) were studied under conditions of net efflux or equilibrium exchange. Net lactose efflux by either mutant was 10-20-fold slower than by the parent and was sensitive to extracellular pH (5.6-8.0). The presence of extracellular lactose (equilibrium exchange) failed to accelerate loss of [14C]lactose, indicating that the step(s) rate limiting for exchange were also rate limiting for net lactose efflux. Net melibiose efflux by the Phe-322 mutant was comparable to the normal carrier, while that by the Tyr-322 mutant was 5-fold faster (pH 7.0). Melibiose efflux by either mutant was sensitive to pH (5.6-8.0). Melibiose in the extracellular medium significantly accelerated loss of [3H]melibiose from either mutant, showing that slow exchange is a sugar-specific phenomenon and not an intrinsic property of these mutants. The sugar-specific effect of these mutations could mean that the defect in these mutants is not on the path of the proton, although alternative explanations cannot as yet be eliminated. The modest effect of these mutations on the transport rate indicates that His-322 contributes a far smaller free energy increment to catalyzing of H+/galactoside cotransport than active site histidines contribute to catalyzing peptide bond hydrolysis in serine proteases. We interpret this to mean that in chemical terms the function of these catalytic histidine residues differ considerably."
https://openalex.org/W1583847016,"The mechanism for glycogen synthesis stimulation produced by adenosine, fructose, and glutamine has been investigated. We have analyzed the relationship between adenine nucleotides and glycogen metabolism rate-limiting enzymes upon hepatocyte incubation with these three compounds. In isolated hepatocytes, inhibition of AMP deaminase with erythro-9-(2-hydroxyl-3nonyl)adenine further increases the accumulation of AMP and the activation of glycogen synthase and phosphorylase by fructose. This ketose does not increase cyclic AMP or the activity of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Adenosine raises AMP and ATP concentration. This nucleotide also activates glycogen synthase and phosphorylase by covalent modification. The correlation coefficient between AMP and glycogen synthase activity is 0.974. Nitrobenzylthioinosine, a transport inhibitor of adenosine, blocks (by 50%) the effect of the nucleoside on AMP formation and glycogen synthase but not on phosphorylase. 2-Chloroadenosine and N6-phenylisopropyladenosine, nonmetabolizable analogues of adenosine, activate phosphorylase (6-fold) without increasing the concentration of adenine nucleotides or the activity of glycogen synthase. Cyclic AMP is not increased by adenosine in hepatocytes from starved rats but is in cells from fed animals. [Ethylenebis (oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid (EGTA) blocks by 60% the activation of phosphorylase by adenosine but not that of glycogen synthase. Glutamine also increases AMP concentration and glycogen synthase and phosphorylase activities, and these effects are blocked by 6-mercaptopurine, a purine synthesis inhibitor. Neither adenosine nor glutamine increases glucose 6-phosphate. It is proposed that the observed efficient glycogen synthesis from fructose, adenosine, and glutamine is due to the generation of AMP that activates glycogen synthase probably through increases in synthase phosphatase activity. It is also concluded that the activation of phosphorylase by the above-mentioned compounds can be triggered by metabolic changes."
https://openalex.org/W1549742807,"A mutation in glycoprotein processing inhibitor-resistant (PIR) Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells was previously shown to result in a block at the Man5GlcNAc2 stage of the dolichol-oligosaccharide biosynthetic pathway (Lehrman, M.A., and Zeng, Y. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 1584-1593). These cells had normal mannose-P-dolichol synthase activity and were able to transfer the Man5GlcNAc2 oligosaccharides to protein. We have now characterized the mutation in greater detail. In PIR cells, biosynthesis of GDP-mannose and mannose-P-dolichol was normal, and pulse-chase analysis indicated that the rate of Man5GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol formation in vivo was similar to that in parental CHO cells but without subsequent formation of larger intermediates. Cell fusion studies demonstrated that the PIR genotype was recessive and that PIR cells could complement the mutation in B4-2-1 cells, which fail to synthesize mannose-P-dolichol. In contrast to the results obtained with intact cells, incubation of membrane preparations of PIR cells with GDP-[3H]mannose resulted in the synthesis of intermediates containing up to 9 mannose residues, indicating that the cells contained active mannosyltransferases VI to IX. With a simplified assay for the formation of intermediates containing 6 to 9 mannoses, it was shown that physical disruption of PIR cells was able to eliminate the block at the pentamannosyl stage. Furthermore, although the temperature requirements of the reactions for the control CHO and PIR membranes were similar, Man5GlcNAc2-elongating activity in CHO membranes was inhibited by alkaline pH treatment, whereas this treatment irreversibly stimulated the activity in PIR membranes. Taken together, these results suggest that the PIR cells have a recessive defect, and that the missing gene product is required by mannosyltransferase VI in vivo for proper utilization of either mannose-P-dolichol or Man5GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol. Since the defect was manifested in vivo but not in vitro, this requirement appears necessary for intact cells but not for disrupted cells or isolated membranes."

Previous studies have shown that CBP1 stabilizes the cytochrome b transcripts via interaction with the 5'-end. For the present study, both rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal antibodies against CBP1 were prepared using a trpE-CBP1 fusion polypeptide as a source of antigen. CBP1 was undetectable in a crude mitochondrial fraction from a wild-type strain by Western blot assay, but a 66-kDa immunoreactive protein was detected in a more purified fraction. The 66-kDa protein was absent in the equivalent fraction from a strain with a deletion in CBP1. Assignment of Mr = 66,000 to the mature CBP1 polypeptide was verified by Western analysis of mitochondria from a strain which over-expresses CBP1. Mitochondrial localization was verified by transcribing CBP1 in vitro with T3 polymerase, translating the artificial mRNA in a rabbit reticulocyte system and importing 35S-CBP1 precursor polypeptides into isolated mitochondria. The mature protein product was 66 kDa, whereas the precursor protein migrated as if it were 68 kDa rather than 76 kDa as predicted from the sequence. Analysis of polypeptides truncated at the carboxyl terminus showed that CBP1 polypeptides migrate anomalously fast in the Laemmli system due to a property of the carboxyl two-thirds of the primary sequence, several sections of which are extremely basic."

V., and Krenitsky, T. A. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 4065-4069). A major factor contributing to the superior inhibition by this diphosphate over the corresponding mono- and triphosphates is revealed here. Homologues of acyclovir mono- and diphosphate that extend the ethoxy moiety by one to four methylene groups were synthesized. These homologues were evaluated for their ability to inhibit human purine nucleoside phosphorylase. Within the diphosphate series, the Ki values increased progressively with increasing chain length. With the monophosphates, the Ki values reached a minimum with the homologue containing a pentoxy moiety. A plot of chain length versus Ki values for both mono- and diphosphates showed that both series had similar optimal distances between the aminal carbon and the terminal oxygen anion. Monophosphates with optimal positioning were somewhat less potent than diphosphates with similar positioning. Nevertheless, it was clear that a major factor in determining potency of inhibition was the distance of the terminal phosphate from the guanine moiety."

The addition of attractant to cells radiolabeled for longer times shows no change in the extent of methylation. Therefore, the increase in labeling for the briefly labeled cells is due to an increased turnover of methyl groups caused by attractant. All amino acids gave enhanced turnover. This turnover lasted for a prolonged time, probably spanning the period of smooth swimming caused by the attractant addition. Repellent did not affect the turnover when added alone or simultaneously with attractant. Thus, for amino acid attractants, the turnover is probably the excitatory signal, which is seen to extend long into or throughout the adaptation period, not just at the start of it."
https://openalex.org/W1604831875,"Transforming growth factor type beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) is a pleiotropic regulator of cell growth and differentiation which can potentiate or otherwise modify cellular responses to different growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF). Since cellular responses to peptide growth factors are mediated, in part, through the regulation of specific gene expression, we have studied the effect of TGF-beta 1 on the EGF-dependent transcriptional of a diverse panel of genes which included the fibronectin gene, the cytoskeletal beta- and gamma-actin genes, and the c-fos protooncogene. The addition of a combination of TGF-beta 1 (10 ng/ml) and EGF (10 ng/ml) to quiescent AKR-2B cells maintained in serum-free medium resulted in a strong synergistic stimulation of transcription which was not evident using either growth factor individually at concentrations of 20-100 ng/ml. This effect was evident within 10 min and did not require the continual presence of TGF-beta 1 in the culture medium. Increased responsiveness of some gene promoters to EGF stimulation was evident for up to 6 h following a brief 10-min exposure to TGF-beta 1. Similar exposure to either platelet-derived growth factor or fibroblast growth factor had little or no effect on EGF-stimulated transcription. These results indicate that the transcriptional response of specific genes to EGF can be stably altered as a consequence of exposure to TGF-beta 1."
https://openalex.org/W1563111502,"Abstract Chromogranin A (secretory protein-I) is an acidic, sulfated glycoprotein found in secretory granules of most endocrine cells but not in exocrine or epithelial cells. Parathyroid chromogranin A is sulfated on tyrosine residues, whereas adrenal chromogranin A appears to be sulfated mainly on oligosaccharide residues. Chromogranin B, on the other hand, is tyrosine-sulfated in the bovine adrenal whereas this protein is absent from the parathyroid. The role of this tissue- or species-specific sulfation of chromogranin is not known. Tyrosine sulfation is a common post-translational modification of proteins in the exocytotic pathway and has been suggested to play a role in the sorting or intracellular transport of secretory proteins. To test this, porcine parathyroid tissue slices were metabolically labeled with 35SO4 and [3H]Lys, and the tissue and incubation medium analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting, and immunoprecipitation with chromogranin A-specific antiserum or by radioimmunoassay for parathormone. Secretion of total and 3H-labeled chromogranin A was about 3- and 7-fold higher, respectively, at 0.5 mM than at 3.0 mM Ca2+, and secretion of 35SO4-labeled chromogranin A was 67-fold higher. This indicates that either sulfated chromogranin A is directed primarily to the Ca2+-regulated pathway or that sulfation occurs following sorting to this pathway. Sodium chlorate (1-10 mM) inhibited sulfation in a dose-dependent manner by up to 95% but it had no effect on the onset or rate of chromogranin A secretion. These data indicate that regulated secretion of parathyroid chromogranin A does not require sulfation of tyrosine residues."
https://openalex.org/W1581751492,"The phosphorylation in vivo and in vitro of the arginine-ornithine and the lysine-arginine-ornithine (LAO) periplasmic transport proteins of Escherichia coli K-12 was previously reported (Celis, R. T. F. (1984) Eur. J. Biochem. 145, 403-411). The phosphorylative reaction required ATP (as a direct energy donor), Mg2+, and a kinase that can be released by osmotic shock treatment of the cells. The enzyme was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. The enzyme exhibited an ATPase activity and a kinase activity. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate gave an apparent molecular weight of 43,000 for the enzyme. The native protein showed the same molecular weight, suggesting that the protein is a monomer. The protein showed an apparent isoelectric point of 4.8 on isoelectric focusing. The two enzymatic reactions required a divalent cation and the apparent Km value for Mg2+ for the kinase activity was 0.5 mM. Mn2+ and Co2+ served as well as Mg2+, whereas Zn2+ and Ca2+ did not support activity. The ATPase activity of the enzyme yielded an apparent Km value for ATP of 50 microM. A similar value, Km of 100 microM, was calculated for the kinase activity with different concentrations of ATP. The enzyme showed a pH optimum of 7.3."
