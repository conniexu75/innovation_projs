Hamling et al. show with a new slip model that it was an incredibly complex event. Unlike most earthquakes, multiple faults ruptured to generate the ground shaking. A remarkable 12 faults ruptured overall, with the rupture jumping between faults located up to 15 km away from each other. The earthquake should motivate rethinking of certain seismic hazard models, which do not presently allow for this unusual complex rupture pattern. Science , this issue p. eaam7194"
https://openalex.org/W2602599682,"Axonal degeneration is an early and prominent feature of many neurological disorders. SARM1 is the central executioner of the axonal degeneration pathway that culminates in depletion of axonal NAD+, yet the identity of the underlying NAD+-depleting enzyme(s) is unknown. Here, in a series of experiments using purified proteins from mammalian cells, bacteria, and a cell-free protein translation system, we show that the SARM1-TIR domain itself has intrinsic NADase activity-cleaving NAD+ into ADP-ribose (ADPR), cyclic ADPR, and nicotinamide, with nicotinamide serving as a feedback inhibitor of the enzyme. Using traumatic and vincristine-induced injury models in neurons, we demonstrate that the NADase activity of full-length SARM1 is required in axons to promote axonal NAD+ depletion and axonal degeneration after injury. Hence, the SARM1 enzyme represents a novel therapeutic target for axonopathies. Moreover, the widely utilized TIR domain is a protein motif that can possess enzymatic activity."

BLA neurons project to the central amygdala (CeA), which also participates in negative and positive behaviors. However, the CeA has primarily been studied as the site for negative behaviors, and the causal role for CeA circuits underlying appetitive behaviors is poorly understood. Here, we identify several genetically distinct populations of CeA neurons that mediate appetitive behaviors and dissect the BLA-to-CeA circuit for appetitive behaviors. Protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 1B+ BLA pyramidal neurons to dopamine receptor 1+ CeA neurons define a pathway for promoting appetitive behaviors, while R-spondin 2+ BLA pyramidal neurons to dopamine receptor 2+ CeA neurons define a pathway for suppressing appetitive behaviors. These data reveal genetically defined neural circuits in the amygdala that promote and suppress appetitive behaviors analogous to the direct and indirect pathways of the basal ganglia.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiIwYTQ0YjljODc3NzdhYWJiMjY1YWNlMTRhOWI5NGE1YyIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4NDc3ODUwfQ.Gvh0Kn0DCJQ24gVu53LApJ2jCxv-GxD4o3-8Gkq4VRyDubs70LB4OQcnzNEbTt23uUcVyPqPcHkTG6bZL76uwA3o83xIIoaaKlQV9TLIiUEbY7G4rUbiKHXOiBVTWyPLev2Htu1-rdSMoXyOERcFzpBSzAWzYJUfDYd-cgYJwHHqXgc9MvzPPqwsFStod9v4mTVY26WiuQht_MYDPEfTnPOL1fZqtMs-6PigoXlOFdmkTJ3Qu0wOvjktVDEx4QGkR7lfxLJ2ty8qiP_NiAs1E25g37hgP0UYP72hnwtofjeuFwQI10_VjNVtDly1jTqRaUF0G1Vnb9HkP8cLO2J_MQ(mp4, (53.66 MB) Download video"

Wu et al. analyzed the emergence of spontaneous directional flows in active fluids containing a suspension of microtubules and clusters of the molecular motor kinesin, confined in a variety of microfluidic geometries (see the Perspective by Morozov). When confined in periodic toroidal channels and cylindrical domains, the flow was organized and persisted in a unidirectional motion, either clockwise or counterclockwise. Oddly, this behavior was independent of scale; as long as the aspect ratio of the geometry was chosen appropriately, flows were observed for a wide range of system dimensions.

https://openalex.org/W2600919610,"Decision making involves dynamic interplay between internal judgements and external perception, which has been investigated in delayed match-to-category (DMC) experiments. Our analysis of neural recordings shows that, during DMC tasks, LIP and PFC neurons demonstrate mixed, time-varying, and heterogeneous selectivity, but previous theoretical work has not established the link between these neural characteristics and population-level computations. We trained a recurrent network model to perform DMC tasks and found that the model can remarkably reproduce key features of neuronal selectivity at the single-neuron and population levels. Analysis of the trained networks elucidates that robust transient trajectories of the neural population are the key driver of sequential categorical decisions. The directions of trajectories are governed by network self-organized connectivity, defining a ""neural landscape"" consisting of a task-tailored arrangement of slow states and dynamical tunnels. With this model, we can identify functionally relevant circuit motifs and generalize the framework to solve other categorization tasks."
https://openalex.org/W2598007332,"DNA repair is essential for life, yet its efficiency declines with age for reasons that are unclear. Numerous proteins possess Nudix homology domains (NHDs) that have no known function. We show that NHDs are NAD+ (oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) binding domains that regulate protein-protein interactions. The binding of NAD+ to the NHD domain of DBC1 (deleted in breast cancer 1) prevents it from inhibiting PARP1 [poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase], a critical DNA repair protein. As mice age and NAD+ concentrations decline, DBC1 is increasingly bound to PARP1, causing DNA damage to accumulate, a process rapidly reversed by restoring the abundance of NAD+ Thus, NAD+ directly regulates protein-protein interactions, the modulation of which may protect against cancer, radiation, and aging."

It is thought that adaptation critically depends on the animal’s ability to detect the difference between the intended and actual movement. Increasing evidence suggests that motor adaptation is driven by sensory prediction errors, the difference between the predicted and the actual sensory experiences about a movement (Wolpert et al., 1995Wolpert D.M.

However, other mechanisms have also been proposed. According to feedback error learning (Albert and Shadmehr, 2016Albert S.T. Shadmehr R.

This feedback control signal serves as a “template,” or an error signal, to update future actions. Additionally, it has been observed that reward prediction errors, the difference between predicted and actual reward, may drive motor adaptation in certain conditions (Galea et al., 2015Galea J.M.

Studies in humans have provided insights into mechanisms underlying motor adaptation. For example, force field-based and visual rotation-based perturbations have yielded theories about the nature of feedback control (Todorov and Jordan, 2002Todorov E. Jordan M.I.

Yet, the exact neural mechanisms remain elusive as many patients have long-standing deficits often spanning multiple domains, such as control and learning (Shadmehr and Krakauer, 2008Shadmehr R.

Sensory prediction errors drive cerebellum-dependent adaptation of reaching.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 98: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the different types of error signals are often difficult to dissociate. Thus, the question of which error signals and neural systems contribute to motor adaptation remains debated (Adams et al., 2013Adams R.A. Shipp S. Friston K.J.

Kawato M. Internal models in the cerebellum.Trends Cogn. Sci. 1998; 2: 338-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar), there has been less focus on cortical contributions, despite evidence that cortex responds rapidly after the onset of perturbations (Krebs et al., 1998Krebs H.I. Brashers-Krug T. Rauch S.L. Savage C.R. Hogan N. Rubin R.H. Fischman A.J. Alpert N.M. Robot-aided functional imaging: application to a motor learning study.Hum.

Distributed task-specific processing of somatosensory feedback for voluntary motor control.eLife. 2016; 5: e13141Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Interestingly, several studies have suggested that primary somatosensory cortex (S1) may have a role in motor learning (Krebs et al., 1998Krebs H.I. Brashers-Krug T. Rauch S.L. Savage C.R. Hogan N.

Role of the primary somatosensory cortex in motor learning: An rTMS study.Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 2010; 93: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), yet a causal role of S1 in motor adaptation has not been demonstrated. To address these questions, we developed a mouse model to study motor adaptation by applying force fields to alter paw trajectories. We first show that mice can learn to counteract the force field in this task. We subsequently show that S1 photoinhibition during perturbation abolished motor adaptation. This deficit in motor adaptation occurred with high specificity: S1 photoinhibition did not perturb basic motor patterns, post-force field completion of actions, or the ability of mice to learn from reward feedback. These results provide insights into neural circuits involved in motor adaptation and the type of error signal that drives motor adaptation. We developed a joystick-based perturbation system for mice inspired by robotic manipulandum-based force field paradigms in humans (Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi, 1994Shadmehr R. Mussa-Ivaldi F.A. Adaptive representation of dynamics during learning of a motor task.J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3208-3224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice were trained to reach for, grab, and pull a joystick into a virtual target box (Figure 1A, Movie S1). The task was performed in the dark, therefore the joystick was invisible and their sensory feedback was limited to somatosensation from the forelimb. After the mice mastered the joystick-pulling behavior in an unperturbed environment, we introduced a brief lateral force perturbation using an electromagnet (Figure 1A). In perturbed trials, the force field was activated for the duration of 100 ms immediately after the joystick passed a fixed spatial threshold (Figure 1A) (Fine and Thoroughman, 2006Fine M.S. Thoroughman K.A. Motor adaptation to single force pulses: sensitive to direction but insensitive to within-movement pulse placement and magnitude.J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 96: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, Sing et al., 2013Sing G.C. Orozco S.P. Smith M.A. Limb motion dictates how motor learning arises from arbitrary environmental dynamics.J. Neurophysiol. 2013; 109: 2466-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In each session (day), mice performed 75 trials without a force field (baseline), 100 trials with a force field (perturbation), and 75 trials without a force field (washout) (Figure 1A). During baseline, the mice had straight trajectories, producing only small perpendicular (i.e., lateral) paw displacements from the vertical pulling direction across the first 75 trials (0.01 ± 0.19 mm, mean ± SD, n = 7 mice, 27 sessions; Figures S1A–S1C). During initial trials of the perturbation phase, the unpredicted force field resulted in leftward perpendicular displacements by ∼2 mm from the pull axis (these leftward displacements were denoted as negative values) (Figures 1B–1D, Figures S1A–S1C). After tens of trials, the mice compensated the force field, significantly reducing the perturbation-induced perpendicular displacement by 31.8% ± 0.73% (repeated-measures ANOVA, F(9,13) = 9.79, p < 0.0001, Figures 1C–1D, Figures S1D and S1E, Figure S2). In addition to reducing motor errors mid-way through the pull, closer inspection of the paw’s paths showed that the mice gradually changed their pull angle near the start of the pull, before the onset of the force field; the mice also shifted their starting position within the start box (position 1 versus start box location compared across the late perturbation trials, Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.0001, and position 1 normalized for shift in start box location early versus late perturbation, Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.0001, Figures 1E–1F, Figures S2A and S2E). This pre-emptive steering suggests that the mice learned to expect the force field during the subsequent trial, and expressed compensatory motor commands, which can be confirmed by unexpectedly removing the force field. Indeed, the mice had a significant “aftereffect” during washout, that is, their pulls were significantly deviated in the direction opposing the force field (baseline versus washout bins, repeated-measures ANOVA, F(7,9) = 11.70, p < 0.0001, Figures 1B–1F, Figure S2). Taken together, these results show that the mice adapted to the force field with predictive compensation. This is evidenced by: (1) an anticipatory change in perpendicular displacement before the force field onset, (2) reduced perpendicular displacement during the force field, and (3) the presence of reliable aftereffects when the force field was unpredictably removed. In some circumstances (Huang et al., 2011Huang V.S. Haith A. Mazzoni P. Krakauer J.W. Rethinking motor learning and savings in adaptation paradigms: model-free memory for successful actions combines with internal models.Neuron. 2011; 70: 787-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, Izawa and Shadmehr, 2011Izawa J. Shadmehr R. Learning from sensory and reward prediction errors during motor adaptation.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2011; 7: e1002012Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), it has been shown that motor adaptation occurs by increasing the frequency of previously rewarded motor actions, that is, the result of reinforcement learning. We found that within a trial, following the offset of the perturbation, all the mice consistently corrected the joystick position by making an “L”-shape turn, as observed in humans (Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi, 1994Shadmehr R. Mussa-Ivaldi F.A. Adaptive representation of dynamics during learning of a motor task.J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3208-3224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the spatial arrangement of the target and perturbed paw trajectories, these post-perturbation L-turns were enough to hit the target and mice were typically able to obtain reward even in the first perturbation trial they ever experienced (Figure S3A, 6/7 mice). As a result, the reward rate remained high during the perturbation block but dropped slightly across the perturbation block in an anti-correlated manner with the reduction in perpendicular displacement (first ten versus last ten perturbation block, Wilcoxon signed rank test, p = 0.010; Spearman’s correlation coefficient: −0.39, p = 7.4 × 10−5; Figure 2A, Figure S3B). These errors are due to either not pulling far enough toward the reward box (50.3%), or aiming too laterally and/or not stopping long enough in the target box to collect a reward (49.7%; Figures S3B and S3C). The anti-correlation between the adaptation and the reward rate suggests that reward feedback did not positively instruct forelimb movements (adaptation). Consistent with this idea, a standard reinforcement-learning model failed to fit the behavioral data, suggesting that there is no consistent relationship between trial-to-trial changes in motor output to the trial-by-trial pattern of reward feedback (Figure 2B; STAR Methods). These observations suggest that the motor adaptation in our task is not primarily driven by reward prediction errors. Another class of models posit that motor adaptation relies on sensory prediction errors (Berniker and Kording, 2008Berniker M. Kording K. Estimating the sources of motor errors for adaptation and generalization.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 1454-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, Izawa and Shadmehr, 2011Izawa J. Shadmehr R.

An internal model for sensorimotor integration.Science. 1995; 269: 1880-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). In these models, a mismatch between the predicted sensory feedback (based on the efference copy) and the actual sensory feedback indicates the presence of a perturbation to the motor system (Figure 2C). The vector of this error signal can be used as a “teaching signal” to learn the magnitude of the perturbation, and to update a memory (i.e., internal model) of the perturbation. Once this internal model is learned, the agent executes a motor command to counter the estimated perturbation. We found that, indeed, such a state estimator model was able to explain the observed pattern of motor adaptation (Figure 2D). To contrast reward-based and sensory prediction error-based learning, we further studied a hybrid model that could learn from both sensory and reward prediction errors (Todorov and Jordan, 2002Todorov E. Jordan M.I. Optimal feedback control as a theory of motor coordination.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1226-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (2000) Google Scholar, Izawa and Shadmehr, 2011Izawa J. Shadmehr R. Learning from sensory and reward prediction errors during motor adaptation.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2011; 7: e1002012Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) (Figure 2E, STAR Methods). Consistent with the individual models, we found a dominating role for sensory over reward prediction errors (Figure 2F). The above results suggest that the integration of sensory feedback (either L-turns, or in the form of sensory prediction errors) from the forelimb, but not reward, plays an important role in the motor adaptation we studied. Somatosensory feedback is conveyed from the limb to the central nervous system (CNS) by multiple pathways including the direct projections from the spinal cord to the cerebellum (spino-cerebellar and cuneo-cerebellar pathways) as well as the thalamocortical pathways (Bostan and Strick, 2010Bostan A.C.

It is, therefore, unclear whether one particular pathway plays a predominant role in motor adaptation. S1 receives feedback from the limb during reaching movements (Hikosaka et al., 1985Hikosaka O.

To test the role of S1 during adaptation, we transiently photoinhibited the forelimb area of S1 during movements. We employed transgenic mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in GABAergic neurons and implanted with an optical fiber in forelimb area of S1 contralateral to the forelimb they used (Guo et al., 2014Guo Z.V.

We then optogenetically activated GABAergic interneurons during the period when the force field was applied to partially inactivate forelimb S1 (n = 3 mice, 17 sessions, Figure 3A). During control sessions (n = 12), the mice significantly adapted to the force field, demonstrated pre-emptive steering, and displayed a significant aftereffect (Figures 3B, 3D, and 3E, Figure S5A; compare to Figures 1C and 1D). In contrast, with S1 photoinhibition the same mice did not exhibit motor adaption as indicated by (1) the lack of reduction in perpendicular deviations (Figures 3C–3D and 3F, Figures S5B–S5D), (2) the lack of predictive steering before force field onset (Figure S5D), and (3) the lack of aftereffect during the washout block (Figures 3C–3D and 3F, Figures S5A and S5B). Specifically, the perpendicular displacement in early trials between control and photoinhibition session were not significantly different (Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.33). With photoinhibition, there was no difference in perpendicular displacement between the early and late trials during the perturbation block (Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.50), yet the last ten trials of the perturbation block during photoinhibition and control sessions were significantly different (Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.001 Figure 3D). The lack of adaptation and aftereffect was not due to general performance deficits (Movies S2 and S3, Figures S5E–S5G). They were still able to perform L-shaped turns and hit the target box, resulting in similar reward rates as in control sessions (62% ± 10% during photoinhibition; 64% ± 13% without; t test, t(27), = 0.12, p = 0.90, Figures 3B and 3C). During photoinhibition sessions, the extent they moved after the termination of the force was slightly longer (∼0.15 mm) rather than shorter (Figure S5E). We also obtained no signatures of adaptation when we repeated the same photoinhibition experiments with a lower laser power (Figure S5H). Furthermore, the velocity profile of pulls with or without photoinhibition was comparable between the baseline and early perturbation trials (Figure S6A). According to feedback error learning theory (Kawato and Gomi, 1992Kawato M. Gomi H. A computational model of four regions of the cerebellum based on feedback-error learning.Biol. Cybern. 1992; 68: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, Shadmehr et al., 2010Shadmehr R. Smith M.A. Krakauer J.W. Error correction, sensory prediction, and adaptation in motor control.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 33: 89-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar), the act of making L-turns (or the more active act of making motor corrections) guides adaptation. The above results indicate that the ability to counteract the force field by means of online motor control as well as basic kinematic variables was not impaired by S1 photoinhibition. To further test whether S1 photoinhibition affects reflexive motor reactions (i.e., the L-turns), we sought to specifically examine motor control. During the adaptation task, the L-shape turns occurred immediately after the force field was terminated, suggesting that the feedback responses underlying the lateral movement began even before the 100-ms perturbation was complete (allowing the L-shaped movement to take place as soon as the perturbing force was removed). To determine the onset latency of these feedback responses, mice were tested in separate sessions in which force field perturbation"

Central nervous system (CNS) endothelial cells lining blood vessels form the blood-CNS barriers, which include the blood-brain barrier, blood-spinal cord barrier, and inner blood-retinal barrier (BRB) (Engelhardt and Coisne, 2011Engelhardt B.

These cells have two properties that limit the passage of substances between the blood and the CNS parenchyma: (1) specialized tight junction complexes between CNS endothelial cells prevent paracellular flux and (2) low rates of vesicular trafficking between the luminal and abluminal membrane, known as transcytosis, limit transcellular passage (Andreone et al., 2015Andreone B.J.

However, it is not understood when and how specialized tight junctions and suppression of transcytosis occur and what their relative contributions are in establishing a functional CNS barrier during development. Loss of barrier function is a hallmark of some CNS degenerative diseases (Obermeier et al., 2013Obermeier B. Daneman R. Ransohoff R.M.

The blood-brain barrier in health and chronic neurodegenerative disorders.Neuron. 2008; 57: 178-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar). Yet, a functional barrier is also a major obstacle for CNS drug delivery (Banks, 2016Banks W.A. From blood-brain barrier to blood-brain interface: new opportunities for CNS drug delivery.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2016; 15: 275-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Dissecting the relative roles of tight junctions and transcytosis in regulating barrier permeability and elucidating the basic principles governing the establishment of CNS barrier properties will enable targeted manipulations of the barrier during disease. The retinal vasculature is well suited to address many fundamental questions about CNS barriers. Physiologically analogous to the blood-brain barrier, the BRB regulates the optimal milieu for phototransduction. Unlike the complex brain vascular network, the retinal vasculature has a relatively simple, stereotypic development and architecture, consisting of a three-tiered, two-dimensional plexus (Stone et al., 1995Stone J. Itin A. Alon T. Pe’er J. Gnessin H. Chan-Ling T. Keshet E. Development of retinal vasculature is mediated by hypoxia-induced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression by neuroglia.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4738-4747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse retinal angiogenesis occurs shortly after birth. CNS endothelial cells invade the optic nerve head and expand radially along the vitreal surface from the center toward the periphery, forming the entire primary plexus by postnatal day 8 (P8) (Figures 1A and 1B ) (Fruttiger, 2007Fruttiger M. Development of the retinal vasculature.Angiogenesis. 2007; 10: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Sprouts from the primary plexus then penetrate into the retina, forming the deeper plexus, followed by further sprouting to form the intermediate plexus (Stahl et al., 2010Stahl A. Connor K.M. Sapieha P. Chen J. Dennison R.J. Krah N.M. Seaward M.R. Willett K.L. Aderman C.M. Guerin K.I. et al.The mouse retina as an angiogenesis model.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2010; 51: 2813-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Here, we use the BRB as a model system to elucidate the relative contributions of tight junctions and transcytosis in regulating CNS barrier permeability during development. To our surprise, we found that functional tight junctions are already present when vessels first entered the CNS so the gradual suppression of transcytosis in CNS endothelial cells governs the development of a functional barrier. We first mapped the spatio-temporal formation of the functional BRB. To evaluate BRB permeability, we transcardially injected mice at several postnatal ages with Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (550 Da) or fluorescently labeled, 10-kDa dextran tracer. A functional BRB, as in adults, completely confines both tracers within the vasculature (Figure S1A). However, at P1, when blood vessels first enter the retina through the optic nerve head and are ensheathed by pericytes (Figure S2A), leakage of both tracers into the retinal parenchyma from the budding vessels was evident (Figure 1C), indicating that these developing vessels do not intrinsically have a functional barrier. In P3 and P5 retinas, both tracers leaked into the parenchyma and were taken up by non-vascular cells near nascent vessels at the angiogenic front, located distal to the optic nerve head (Figures 1D–1G, arrowheads), while both tracers were confined in the more mature vessels located proximal to the optic nerve head (Figures 1D–1G, arrows). Indeed, Sulfo-NHS-Biotin, 3-kDa dextran tracers, and 10-kDa dextran tracers at P5 reveal that a functional barrier is formed gradually in a proximal-to-distal fashion (Figures 1E–1H). At P8 and P9, although the angiogenic front reaches the retinal periphery, the nascent, distal vessels still exhibited leakage (Figures 1I and 1J), whereas the mature, proximal vessels confined Sulfo-NHS-Biotin and 10-kDa dextran tracers (Figures S1B and S1C). At P10, both tracers were completely confined in all vessels of the primary plexus, including distal vessels (Figures 1I and 1J; Figures S1B and S1C). Thus, these data demonstrate that developing vessels are initially leaky, that a functional barrier is formed gradually from proximal to distal, and that the primary plexus acquires a functional BRB by P10. We next examined when the functional BRB is established in the deeper plexus, which sprouts from the primary plexus between P7 and P12. Sprouting vessels of the deeper plexus showed leakage of both Sulfo-NHS-Biotin and 10-kDa dextran tracers at P8 and P9 (Figures S1D and S1E). However, at P10, when the deeper plexus vessels continue to sprout, both tracers were confined in newly formed vessels (Figures S1D and S1E). Finally, we investigated when the BRB becomes functional in the intermediate plexus, which sprouts from the deeper plexus between P12 and P17. At P12, sprouting nascent vessels, surprisingly, already confined both tracers; no leakage was observed at any ages examined (Figures S1F and S1G). Together, these data demonstrate that the developing retinal vasculature does not intrinsically have a functional barrier but instead gradually acquires barrier properties. Once barrier properties are attained by P10, nascent vessels sprouting from vessels with a functional BRB inherit and maintain these barrier properties. Thus, the three-tiered retinal vasculature acquires a functional BRB remarkably by one distinctive age: P10 (Figure 1; Figure S1). We next addressed the subcellular mechanisms underlying functional BRB development. We asked whether CNS endothelial cells form functional tight junctions and acquire low rates of transcytosis synchronously or sequentially to establish the functional BRB and what the relative contribution of each property is to the regulation of BRB permeability. To evaluate the functionality of tight junctions and suppression of transcytosis at subcellular resolution, we injected horseradish peroxidase (HRP) intravenously at several ages and imaged the retina with transmission electron microscopy (EM). In the lung and heart vasculature, where barrier properties are absent, luminal HRP leaks into the basement membrane and parenchyma both by passing through junctions, observed as HRP-filled tight junctions, and by high rates of transcytosis, evident as numerous HRP-filled intracellular vesicles (Karnovsky, 1967Karnovsky M.J. The ultrastructural basis of capillary permeability studied with peroxidase as a tracer.J. Cell Biol. 1967; 35: 213-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, Schneeberger-Keeley and Karnovsky, 1968Schneeberger-Keeley E.E. Karnovsky M.J. The ultrastructural basis of alveolar-capillary membrane permeability to peroxidase used as a tracer.J. Cell Biol. 1968; 37: 781-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, in adult retinal endothelial cells, where barrier properties are present (Raviola, 1977Raviola G. The structural basis of the blood-ocular barriers.Exp. Eye Res. 1977; 25: 27-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, Reese and Karnovsky, 1967Reese T.S. Karnovsky M.J. Fine structural localization of a blood-brain barrier to exogenous peroxidase.J. Cell Biol. 1967; 34: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1921) Google Scholar), we observed that luminal HRP is halted sharply at electron-dense “kissing points” between endothelial cells where adjacent membranes are tightly apposed (Figure 2A). Adult retinal endothelial cells also displayed few HRP-filled vesicles, indicating that transcytosis is suppressed (Figure 2B). At P1, we observed tracer extravasation from budding vessels, indicating leaky vessels (Figure 1C). Surprisingly, under EM, these CNS endothelial cells already had specialized tight junctions that halted the HRP at the kissing points (Figures 2C and 2E), as observed in adult, mature CNS endothelial cells (Figure 2A). However, these CNS endothelial cells had many HRP-containing vesicles, including luminal and abluminal membrane-associated vesicles and cytoplasmic vesicles (Figures 2D and 2F), similar to lung and heart endothelial cells, where suppression of transcytosis is absent (Schneeberger-Keeley and Karnovsky, 1968Schneeberger-Keeley E.E. Karnovsky M.J. The ultrastructural basis of alveolar-capillary membrane permeability to peroxidase used as a tracer.J. Cell Biol. 1968; 37: 781-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These results indicate that as early as vessel ingression at P1, functional tight junctions are present in budding CNS endothelial cells, but transcytosis has not been suppressed, suggesting that immature BRB leakiness is entirely due to uninhibited transcytosis. To test the hypothesis that suppression of transcytosis determines functional BRB development, we used EM to examine vesicular trafficking at later postnatal ages. At P5 and P8, in distal, leaky vessels, many HRP-filled vesicles were observed (Figures 2G and 2H), indicating that transcytosis has not been suppressed. However, in the proximal vessels that are impermeable to tracer, very few HRP-filled vesicles were observed, suggesting that suppression of transcytosis had occurred (Figures S3A and S3C). By P10, when all the retinal vessels have a functional BRB, negligible HRP-filled vesicles were observed in both distal and proximal vessels (Figures 2G and 2H; Figures S2A and S2C). Consistent with the observation at P1, functional tight junctions were present in all vessels, both proximal and distal, at all ages tested (Figures 2I and 2J; Figures S3B and S3D). These data demonstrate that a leaky, immature barrier is due entirely to high rates of bulk transcytosis in endothelial cells. A functional barrier is established days later, only after transcytosis is suppressed, coinciding with functional BRB development by P10. Therefore, the spatio-temporal regulation of transcytosis governs the development of a functional BRB. Given the significance of transcytosis in functional BRB formation, we next examined whether Mfsd2a, a known transcytosis regulator in blood-brain barrier formation (Ben-Zvi et al., 2014Ben-Zvi A. Lacoste B. Kur E. Andreone B.J. Mayshar Y. Yan H. Gu C. Mfsd2a is critical for the formation and function of the blood-brain barrier.Nature. 2014; 509: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), also plays a role in BRB formation. EM analysis of retinas from HRP-injected adult mice revealed increased HRP-filled vesicle density in the CNS endothelial cells of Mfsd2a−/− mice compared to Mfsd2a+/+ littermate controls (Figures 3A and 3B ), whereas tight junctions remained functional (Figures 3C and 3D). Thus, Mfsd2a plays a similar role at the BRB in suppressing transcytosis. We next examined Mfsd2a expression as a marker for suppressed transcytosis during BRB development by immunostaining retinas from dextran tracer-injected pups. At P7, Mfsd2a protein is only present in proximal, impermeable vessels but absent in distal, leaky vessels (Figures 3E and 3F). In contrast, Claudin-5 is fully present at the distal vessels (Figures 3E and 3F). Importantly, Mfsd2a is absent from leaky, distal vessels during development (Figure 3F), and only by P10, when tracer is completely confined in the vessels, is Mfsd2a expression present at the distal vessels (Figures 3E and 3F). Thus, the spatio-temporal expression of Mfsd2a correlates with the gradual suppression of transcytosis and the development of a functional BRB. If the timing of the gradual suppression of transcytosis governs the development of a functional BRB, then altered regulation of transcytosis should affect functional BRB development. To test this idea, we examined the time course of functional BRB formation in two mutant mice with either increased or decreased transcytosis. First, we injected 10-kDa dextran tracers into Mfsd2a−/− mice and wild-type littermates at P5, P10, and adult ages. In P5 Mfsd2a+/+ wild-type mice, tracer leaked from distal vessels but was confined in proximal vessels (Figures 3G and 3H). However, in P5 Mfsd2a−/− mice, tracer leaked from both distal and proximal vessels (Figures 3G and 3H), similar to what we observed in P1 wild-type pups (Figure 1C). Even at P10 and adulthood, this leaky phenotype persisted, indicating that failure to suppress transcytosis results in incomplete formation of a functional BRB (Figure S4). We next tested whether precocious suppression of transcytosis during development accelerates functional BRB formation. Among various transcytotic pathways, peripheral endothelial cells frequently utilize the caveolae-pathway (Tuma and Hubbard, 2003Tuma P. Hubbard A.L. Transcytosis: crossing cellular barriers.Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 871-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) knockout mice lack caveolae vesicles throughout the endothelium (Drab et al., 2001Drab M. Verkade P. Elger M.

EM analysis of distal retinal vessels from P8 and P10 Cav-1+/+ wild-type retinas revealed decreased vesicular density from P8 to P10 (Figures 4A and 4B ). However, in Cav-1−/− mice, vesicular density was already low at P8 (Figures 4A and 4B), indicating a precocious suppression of transcytosis in the BRB. To examine the impact of precocious suppression of transcytosis on functional BRB formation, we intravenously injected bovine serum albumin (BSA), known to be transported via caveolae vesicles in lung endothelial cells (Schubert et al., 2001Schubert W. Frank P.G. Razani B. Park D.S. Chow C.W. Lisanti M.P. Caveolae-deficient endothelial cells show defects in the uptake and transport of albumin in vivo.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48619-48622Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), in Cav-1+/+ and Cav-1−/− mice at P8. In Cav-1+/+ wild-type littermate mice, we observed BSA leakage into the retinal parenchyma from distal vessels (Figures 4C and 4D). However, in Cav-1−/− mice, BSA was confined throughout the vasculature, indicating that a functional BRB had formed at P8 instead of P10 (Figures 4C and 4D). This time shift in BRB impermeability demonstrates that precocious suppression of transcytosis results in an earlier formation of a functional BRB. This study provides the first spatio-temporal characterization of functional BRB formation and establishes the BRB as a tractable model system for future study of CNS barriers. Using this system, we unexpectedly found that suppression of transcytosis is a principal contributor in the normal development of a functional barrier. We demonstrated that during BRB development, budding CNS endothelial cells already display functional tight junctions as early as vessel ingression but have not yet suppressed transcytosis. Thus, the leakiness of the developing retinal vasculature is entirely due to transcytosis. A functional BRB is established days later, only after transcytosis is gradually suppressed in BRB endothelial cells (Figure S5). In contrast to the prevailing notion in the field emphasizing the role of tight junctions in barrier function, our findings support an emerging view that transcytosis also plays a key role in regulating CNS barrier permeability and indicate that while specialized tight junctions are intrinsic to retinal endothelial cells, suppression of transcytosis is induced by CNS environmental cues during development. Our findings revealed that CNS endothelial cells have a developmental program that actively inhibits transcytosis to ensure barrier function. Finally, unregulated BRB dysfunction is a pathological feature of many ocular diseases (Klaassen et al., 2013Klaassen I. Van Noorden C.J.F. Schlingemann R.O. Molecular basis of the inner blood-retinal barrier and its breakdown in diabetic macular edema and other pathological conditions.Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2013; 34: 19-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Our findings may offer insights to improving CNS drug delivery as manipulating transcytosis can transport different size cargos, including compounds less than 1 kDa to large macromolecules. Furthermore, genes that regulate transcytosis can be targeted to repair CNS barriers to treat neurodegenerative diseases. What are the molecular mechanisms that induce CNS endothelial cells to gradually suppress transcytosis to develop a functional BRB? Pericytes ensheathing CNS endothelial cells are the most promising candidates, as pericyte-deficient mice have leaky barriers in brain and retina, aberrant tight junctions, elevated transcytosis, and reduced Mfsd2a protein at the blood-brain barrier (Armulik et al., 2010Armulik A.

Using NG2:DsRed reporter mice, which have labeled retinal mural cells, we examined pericyte coverage and density during BRB development and found that pericytes ensheath blood vessels at P1 (Figure S2A). In P5 retinas, we find about a 1:1 pericyte-to-endothelial-cell ratio throughout the retina (Figures S2B–S2D), including distal, nascent, leaky vessels, where Mfsd2a protein is absent (Figure S2E). This suggests that the differentiation state of pericytes or inductive factors derived from pericytes during development are likely the key mechanisms that induce CNS endothelial cells to suppress transcytosis for functional BRB formation. Indeed, the loss of function of two transcription factors, foxc1 and foxf2, in CNS pericytes actually increases CNS pericyte density but still results in blood-brain barrier breakdown (Reyahi et al., 2015Reyahi A.

Therefore, it is critical for future work to identify the pericyte-derived factors that mediate the gradual suppression of transcytosis for a functional BRB.

However, the relationship between these receptive fields remains unclear. We reversibly manipulated the activity of MECII neurons via chemogenetic receptors and compared the changes in downstream hippocampal place cells to those of neurons in MEC. Depolarization of MECII impaired spatial memory and elicited drastic changes in CA1 place cells in a familiar environment, similar to those seen during remapping between distinct environments, while hyperpolarization did not. In contrast, both manipulations altered the firing rate of MEC neurons without changing their firing locations. Interestingly, only depolarization caused significant changes in the relative firing rates of individual grid fields, reconfiguring the spatial input from MEC. This suggests a novel mechanism of hippocampal remapping whereby rate changes in MEC neurons lead to locational changes of hippocampal place fields."
https://openalex.org/W2597669146,"Corneal scarring is due to aberrant activity of the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling pathway following traumatic, mechanical, infectious, or surgical injury. Altered TGFβ signaling cascade leads to downstream Smad (Suppressor of mothers against decapentaplegic) protein-mediated signaling events that regulate expression of extracellular matrix and myogenic proteins. These events lead to transdifferentiation of keratocytes into myofibroblasts through fibroblasts and often results in permanent corneal scarring. Hence, therapeutic targets that reduce transdifferentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts may provide a clinically relevant approach to treat corneal fibrosis and improve long-term visual outcomes. Smad7 protein regulates the functional effects of TGFβ signaling during corneal wound healing. We tested that targeted delivery of Smad7 using recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 5 (AAV5-Smad7) delivered to the corneal stroma can inhibit corneal haze post photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) in vivo in a rabbit corneal injury model. We demonstrate that a single topical application of AAV5-Smad7 in rabbit cornea post-PRK led to a significant decrease in corneal haze and corneal fibrosis. Further, histopathology revealed lack of immune cell infiltration following AAV5-Smad7 gene transfer into the corneal stroma. Our data demonstrates that AAV5-Smad7 gene therapy is relatively safe with significant potential for the treatment of corneal disease currently resulting in fibrosis and impaired vision."

Pathologic TDP-43, which is typically found in intracellular inclusions, is a misfolding protein with emerging roles in ALS and FTLD. Recently, TDP-43 species have been found in extracellular fluids of patients; however, the overall implications of TDP-43–mediated signaling linked to neuroinflammation are poorly understood. Our work—the first, to our knowledge, to focus on innate immunity responses to TDP-43 aggregates—shows that such species are internalized by microglia and cause abnormal mobilization of endogenous TDP-43. Exposure to TDP-43 aggregates elicited not only IL-1β, but also NLRP3dependent and noncanonical IL-18 processing. Moreover, we report a link between TDP-43 and neuronal loss via the apoptosis-independent emerging roles of caspase-3 in neurotoxic inflammation. Our results further support the view of noncell autonomous neurodegenerative mechanisms in ALS. Remarkably, we demonstrate that TDP-43 aggregates bind to and colocalize with MAPK/MAK/MRK overlapping kinase (MOK) and show that its phosphorylation status is disrupted. Finally, we show that this TDP-43–caused activation state can be altered by exogenous Hsp27 and Hsp70 chaperones.

The ensuing biophysical analysis of the interaction between SERF1A and α-Syn suggested that the acceleration of α-Syn aggregation originates from a transient interaction in the initial stage of the process (7Falsone S.F.

However, structural details of MOAG-4/SERF proteins, and the molecular mechanism by which they promote aggregate formation have so far remained elusive. To address this problem, we investigate here the effects of MOAG-4 on the aggregation of α-Syn by monitoring the kinetics of this process using thioflavin T (ThT), a dye known to exhibit enhanced fluorescence upon binding amyloid fibrils (8Naiki H.

We found that MOAG-4 accelerates aggregate formation of α-Syn, which is consistent both with in vitro studies showing that aggregation of α-Syn is promoted by the human ortholog SERF1A (7Falsone S.F.

We then use NMR spectroscopy to determine the structural ensemble of MOAG-4, and provide structural evidence for the interaction between MOAG-4 and α-Syn. Although spontaneous (i.e. unseeded) in vitro formation of α-Syn amyloid fibrils at neutral pH under quiescent conditions is slow (11Buell A.K. Galvagnion C. Gaspar R. Sparr E. Vendruscolo M.

Med. 1998; 4: 1318-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar), all NMR experiments were carried out at low temperature to avoid the possible formation of small oligomeric aggregates during the measurements (13Ahmad B.

At pH 6.0 and 10 °C, the protein did not form detectable aggregates in the NMR tube during the NMR experiments. Our results show that MOAG-4 affects the intra-molecular interactions within α-Syn that bring together its N- and C-terminal regions. The presence of MOAG-4 is thus relevant as the transient interactions between the terminal regions of α-Syn result in rather compact conformations that appear to be relatively resistant to aggregation (14Bertoncini C.W.

In this way, MOAG-4 effectively competes with this self-protective mechanism, such that α-Syn takes on a less compact form, and may thereby become poised for aggregation and subsequent amyloid formation. To probe for a direct effect of MOAG-4 on α-Syn aggregation, we monitored the enhancement of ThT fluorescence in an aggregation kinetics assay (Fig. 1A). Amyloid formation of α-Syn was monitored in the absence or presence of an equimolar concentration of MOAG-4 at pH 6.0 and 37 °C. Some of the data displayed biphasic behavior, which cannot be readily explained by simple nucleation-dependent aggregation mechanisms. Although such complex behavior may be an intrinsic and relevant property of α-Syn aggregation induced by MOAG-4, it remains extremely challenging to extract from the data the underlying mechanistic information (19Meisl G. Kirkegaard J.B. Arosio P. Michaels T.C. Vendruscolo M. Dobson C.M. Linse S. Knowles T.P. Molecular mechanisms of protein aggregation from global fitting of kinetic models.Nat.

Thus, although we could not extract from the experimental data the kinetic parameters of the underlying microscopic processes, we found that, whereas α-Syn aggregation without MOAG-4 takes several days (10Giehm L. Otzen D.E. Strategies to increase the reproducibility of protein fibrillization in plate reader assays.Anal. Biochem. 2010; 400: 270-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), MOAG-4 accelerated the process significantly, with a lag time of ∼3 h (Fig. 1A). We then examined whether MOAG-4 is integrated into the α-Syn fibrils (Fig. 1B). The α-Syn aggregation experiment was performed at pH 7.4 and 37 °C in the presence of MOAG-4. α-Syn aggregation was slower at pH 7.4 than 6.0, in agreement with previous studies showing that a decrease in pH enhanced the kinetics of α-Syn amyloid fibril formation (21Uversky V.N.

SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed that the insoluble fraction of the sample did not contain MOAG-4 (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the modulation of the α-Syn amyloidogenesis by MOAG-4 occurred during an early and transient interaction with α-Syn. The 1H-15N heteronuclear single-quantum correlation (HSQC) spectrum of MOAG-4 (Fig. 2A) has the typical appearance expected for an intrinsically disordered protein, with very limited amide chemical shift dispersion. To characterize the structure in more detail, sequential assignment of backbone and aliphatic side chain 1H, 13C, and 15N resonances was achieved using a set of three-dimensional (3D) triple-resonance experiments (see “Experimental procedures”). Upon attainment of the resonance assignments, an ensemble of MOAG-4 structures was determined using molecular dynamics simulations restrained with backbone NMR chemical shifts (23Camilloni C. Cavalli A. Vendruscolo M. Replica-averaged metadynamics.J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2013; 9: 5610-5617Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 24Kohlhoff K.J. Robustelli P. Cavalli A. Salvatella X. Vendruscolo M. Fast and accurate predictions of protein NMR chemical shifts from interatomic distances.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009; 131: 13894-13895Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The corresponding structural ensemble (Fig. 2B) displays a protein structure with a very high degree of disorder. Despite the global disorderliness, virtually all members of the structural ensemble contain an α-helical segment for residues Asp45-Asn70. When superposing the structures on the coordinates for these residues, the remainder of the protein appears spatially comparatively less well defined. However, a second, lowly-populated, transient α-helix is present in these ensembles, comprising residues Asp8-Lys22 (Fig. 2C). Neither significantly populated compact states nor local β-sheet conformations were found. The experimental chemical shifts were well correlated with those back-calculated from the MOAG-4 ensemble that we determined. To validate the MOAG-4 ensemble, we further measured NOE intensities and compared these with the values back-calculated from the ensemble of structures. The good results of this validation attest the accuracy of the ensemble of structures that we describe. Taken together, MOAG-4 is a highly mutable protein containing transiently populated elements of secondary structure, but devoid of tertiary interactions. As can be seen in Fig. 2A, the peak intensity for the residues between Asp45 and Asn70 is relatively low. The explanation for this observation can now be rationalized with help of the structure: the stretch Asp45-Asn70 forms a long helical structure, in which amide bond vectors pointing along the direction of the axis of the α-helix experience fast transverse spin relaxation due to slow overall tumbling motion. To determine the binding affinity and the location of the binding site on MOAG-4, a series of 1H-15N HSQC spectra for uniformly 13C,15N-labeled MOAG-4 were recorded with different amounts of unlabeled α-Syn. Fig. 3A shows the chemical shift changes observed for MOAG-4 upon the binding of α-Syn. The fit to saturating binding curves yielded a dissociation constant (Kd) value of 10.8 ± 0.8 μm. The backbone chemical shifts of amide proton (1HN), nitrogen (15N), and carbonyl (13C′) nuclei of MOAG-4 were obtained from 3D HNCO experiments (25Kay L.E. Xu G.Y. Yamazaki T.

B. 1994; 103: 203-216Crossref Scopus (836) Google Scholar) at [α-Syn]/[MOAG-4] = 0 and 8. The chemical shift perturbations of backbone 15N and 13C′ nuclei (Fig. 3B) indicate that binding to α-Syn induces significant changes in MOAG-4 for a contiguous stretch of residues between Arg3 and Gly26, corresponding to the first α-helical segment, a region that is rich in positively charged amino acid residues (net charge +6). The structural propensities of MOAG-4, free and bound to α-Syn, were calculated from the backbone 1HN, 15N, and 13C′ chemical shifts using the program ncSPC (27Tamiola K. Mulder F.A. Using NMR chemical shifts to calculate the propensity for structural order and disorder in proteins.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2012; 40: 1014-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The α-helical propensity of the N-terminal segment increases slightly upon binding to α-Syn, indicating a direct effect of α-Syn on the MOAG-4 conformational ensemble (Fig. 3C). Next, we examined the structural changes of α-Syn upon interaction with MOAG-4 by monitoring the corresponding chemical shift changes. Fig. 4A shows a series of BEST-TROSY 1H-15N correlation spectra (28Lescop E. Kern T. Brutscher B. Guidelines for the use of band-selective radiofrequency pulses in hetero-nuclear NMR: example of longitudinal-relaxation-enhanced BEST-type 1H-15N correlation experiments.J. Magn.

Spectral assignment of α-Syn was taken from BMRB entry ID 18857, and confirmed using BEST-TROSY 3D HNCO and HN(CA)CO experiments (29Lescop E. Schanda P. Brutscher B.

Chemical shift perturbations for backbone 15N and 13C′ upon binding to MOAG-4 (Fig. 4B) suggest that MOAG-4 interacts with the C terminus of α-Syn. This result parallels the previous finding that the interaction of α-Syn with SERF1A is localized to the C terminus of α-Syn (7Falsone S.F. Meyer N.H. Schrank E. Leitinger G. Pham C.L. Fodero-Tavoletti M.T. Holmberg M. Dulle M. Scicluna B. Gesslbauer B. Rückert H.M. Wagner G.E. Merle D.A. Nollen E.A. Kungl A.J. Hill A.F. Cappai R. Zangger K. SERF protein is a direct modifier of amyloid fiber assembly.Cell Rep. 2012; 2: 358-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of α-Syn (residues Glu110-Ala140) is acidic and negatively charged (net charge at neutral pH of −12), constituting a favorable binding location for positively charged proteins, such as MOAG-4 and SERF1A. Although 15N chemical shift changes are also observed for the N-terminal region, and to a lesser extent for the NAC (non-Aβ component of Alzheimer's disease amyloid) region, as we will show below, we found that these collateral effects on structure are likely to result from the loss of pre-existing interactions within the α-Syn ensemble. Fig. 4C shows the structural propensity of α-Syn in the absence and presence of MOAG-4, calculated from the backbone 1HN, 15N, and 13C′ chemical shifts using the program ncSPC (27Tamiola K. Mulder F.A. Using NMR chemical shifts to calculate the propensity for structural order and disorder in proteins.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2012; 40: 1014-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We found that, consistent with previous studies (27Tamiola K. Mulder F.A. Using NMR chemical shifts to calculate the propensity for structural order and disorder in proteins.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2012; 40: 1014-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 31Nielsen J.T. Mulder F.A. There is diversity in disorder: “in all chaos there is a cosmos, in all disorder a secret order.Front. Mol. Biosci. 2016; 3: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), deviations of measured chemical shifts from their random coil values are very small throughout the sequence. We did not observe any significant differences in the structural propensities of α-Syn in the presence and absence of MOAG-4, but the conformational exchange of α-Syn with a less compact form upon binding to MOAG-4 was confirmed by an increase of backbone flexibility (see below). To examine the conformational change of α-Syn upon binding to MOAG-4, we measured the backbone 15N transverse relaxation rate constants (R2) of α-Syn in the presence and absence of MOAG-4 (Fig. 5A), and obtained the changes of the backbone 15N R2 values induced by MOAG-4 (Fig. 5C). The R2 values for the C terminus of α-Syn are larger in the presence of MOAG-4 than those without MOAG-4, indicative of restricted motion by addition of MOAG-4. These effects can be attributed to direct binding of α-Syn and MOAG-4 mediated by polyvalent electrostatic interactions. At the same time, a reduction in the R2 rates was observed for the N-terminal region (residues Val3-Thr59), indicating that the N terminus of α-Syn becomes more dynamic upon binding. These results offer insight into the mechanism by which MOAG-4 enhances α-Syn aggregation. It has been proposed that, although α-Syn is highly dynamic as typical of intrinsically disordered proteins, the ensemble of α-Syn in the native state is more compact than that expected for a random coil polypeptide chain due to the presence of long-range transient intra-molecular interactions (14Bertoncini C.W.

These intra-molecular interactions and the associated compaction of α-Syn shield the aggregation-prone central region of the protein from forming inter-molecular interactions under physiological conditions in the cell, thereby protecting it against aggregation (35Theillet F.X.

To test whether the action of MOAG-4 could be emulated by screening the electrostatic interaction between the N and C termini by salt, we measured the backbone 15N R2 relaxation rates at pH 6.0 and 10 °C in the presence and absence of 100 mm NaCl (Fig. 5B). In full agreement with a previous report (36Bai J. Cheng K. Liu M. Li C. Impact of the α-synuclein initial ensemble structure on fibrillation pathways and kinetics.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2016; 120: 3140-3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), addition of NaCl reduced the backbone 15N R2 relaxation rates in the N- and C-terminal regions (Fig. 5D), indicating that the screening of electrostatic interactions increased mobility in both domains. A positive correlation between the changes in the 15N R2 relaxation rates at the N terminus of α-Syn by addition of NaCl and those upon interaction with MOAG-4 (Fig. 5E) indicates that the interaction of MOAG-4 with the C terminus of α-Syn abrogates pre-existing intra-molecular interactions, increasing the dynamics at the N terminus of α-Syn. These changes, in turn, affect the chemical shifts for regions outside the C terminus (Fig. 4), explaining the pervasive pattern observed throughout the protein sequence. The study of Bai et al. (36Bai J. Cheng K. Liu M. Li C. Impact of the α-synuclein initial ensemble structure on fibrillation pathways and kinetics.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2016; 120: 3140-3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) shows clearly how paramagnetic relaxation enhancement effects can remain restricted to two regions of the protein, whereas leading to chemical shift changes that are transmitted also to regions other than those in direct contact. Previous studies have shown that increasing the salt concentration accelerates the formation of α-Syn amyloid fibrils (37Munishkina L.A. Henriques J. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L.

To examine the effect of NaCl on the formation of α-Syn amyloid fibrils, the aggregation kinetics of α-Syn at 100 mm NaCl was monitored by measuring ThT fluorescence at pH 6.0 and 37 °C.

In vitro at neutral pH, and under quiescent conditions, spontaneous aggregation of α-Syn requires at least a few weeks (12Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T.

Integral membrane proteins in the plasma membrane including receptors and transporters are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and are delivered to the plasma membrane to fulfill their functions (1Cao X. Surma M.A. Simons K. Polarized sorting and trafficking in epithelial cells.Cell Res. 2012; 22: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Their abundance in the plasma membrane is ultimately determined by a balance between exocytosis of the intracellular vesicles that contain them and endocytosis of the plasma membranes where they reside. The balance is subject to regulatory influences that govern proper functions of the integral membrane proteins in time and location. Dysregulation in these regulatory processes are associated with many clinical manifestations including cardiac, metabolic, and neurological disorders (2Knepper M.A. Kwon T.H. Nielsen S.

Here we report a hormone-regulated mechanism that controls plasma membrane protein abundance via a conserved protein-interacting module known as PDZ domain, where PDZ is an acronym for three proteins, PSD-95 (postsynaptic density protein 95), Dlg (disks large homolog 1), and ZO-1 (zona occludens protein 1) (5Bhattacharyya R.P.

Biochem. 2006; 75: 655-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). PDZ domains bind to protein COOH-terminal ligand motifs, which are classified into three classes: class I motif Ser/Thr-X-Φ, class II motif Φ-X-Φ and class III motif Asp/Glu-X-Φ (where X is any amino acid residue and Φ is any hydrophobic residue)(6Stiffler M.A. Chen J.R.

PDZ domain binding selectivity is optimized across the mouse proteome.Science. 2007; 317: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). PDZ domains are found in many proteins in yeast, worm, fly, mouse, and human (5Bhattacharyya R.P. Reményi A. Yeh B.J. Lim W.A.

Thus, many proteins have more than one PDZ domain and are capable of simultaneous interactions with several proteins that contain PDZ-ligand motifs. Proteins that contain PDZ domains are involved in a variety of biological processes including scaffolding, signaling, and protein trafficking (5Bhattacharyya R.P. Reményi A. Yeh B.J. Lim W.A.

Its activity in the apical plasma membrane is regulated by the antidiuretic peptide hormone vasopressin, thereby controlling the cells' ability to reabsorb water via osmosis. The regulatory action of vasopressin is associated with vasopressin-induced AQP2 phosphorylation on two serine residues at the COOH terminus (8Moeller H.B. Rittig S. Fenton R.A.

PDZ domain binding selectivity is optimized across the mouse proteome.Science. 2007; 317: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Vasopressin-induced AQP2 phosphorylation at Ser-269 adds a negative charge to the class I motif and converts it to a class III-like motif. We hypothesized that this hormone-induced charge change in the AQP2 PDZ motif may alter the interaction of AQP2 with a corresponding PDZ domain-containing protein that is required for AQP2 endocytosis. Using protein mass spectrometry, we identified an apically expressed PDZ domain-containing protein Sipa1l1 (signal-induced proliferation-associated 1 like 1), which interacts with and mediates AQP2 endocytosis in the absence of vasopressin. We further showed that vasopressin-induced phosphorylation of AQP2 at Ser-269 reduced the interaction of AQP2 with and endocytosis by Sipa1l1, prolonging apical AQP2 retention. Our results provide a mechanism that explains vasopressin-mediated regulation of osmotic water transport in the kidney collecting duct cells. Mouse kidney collecting duct cells (mpkCCD) were chosen to study the molecular mechanism involved in vasopressin-mediated AQP2 trafficking because the cells contain all necessary components for vasopressin-induced endogenous AQP2 expression, phosphorylation, and trafficking (18Khositseth S.

The cells were seeded on Transwell membrane supports and grown to polarization that segregates the plasma membrane into apical and basolateral membranes (Fig. 1A), representing the urine side and the serum side of the kidney collecting ducts. The cells were then treated with the vasopressin V2 receptor-specific agonist dDAVP added to the basolateral side to induce endogenous AQP2 protein expression. Before using the cells for AQP2 trafficking studies, dDAVP was withdrawn so that most AQP2 was in intracellular vesicles. After reapplication of dDAVP, AQP2 was in the apical plasma membrane, co-localizing with biotin that was used to label and delineate the apical plasma membrane (Fig. 1B, bottom left panel). Without dDAVP reapplication, most AQP2 remained in an intracellular location (Fig. 1B, top left panel). Without dDAVP reapplication, AQP2 was not phosphorylated at Ser-269 (Fig. 1B, top middle panel, pS269). Reapplication of dDAVP drastically increased Ser-269 phosphorylation (Fig. 1B, bottom middle panel). Most Ser-269 phosphorylated AQP2 was in the apical plasma membrane by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1B, bottom right panel) and immuno-EM staining (Fig. 1C). We next tested whether Ser-269 phosphorylation enhances AQP2 apical retention by examining cellular localization of ectopically expressed phosphorylation-mimicking (serine to aspartate, S269D) and phosphorylation-ablated (serine to alanine, S269A) mutant AQP2 in the mpkCCD cells (Fig. 2A) as previously seen in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (13Hoffert J.D.

As seen in Fig. 2B, the S269A mutant AQP2 trafficked to the apical plasma membrane (middle panels, pixel overlap best seen in the XZ reconstruction) as the wild-type AQP2 did in response to dDAVP (left panels), suggesting that Ser-269 phosphorylation is not required for apical AQP2 exocytosis. In contrast, the S269D mutant AQP2 was already localized in the apical plasma membrane in the absence of dDAVP (Fig. 2B, top right panel), consistent with a role of Ser-269 phosphorylation in apical AQP2 retention. Fig. 2C shows our image analysis method, and Fig. 2D summarizes the results. There are 126 and 78 annotated PDZ domain-containing proteins in the human and mouse genome, respectively (5Bhattacharyya R.P. Reményi A. Yeh B.J. Lim W.A.

To narrow down potential candidates that could interact with the AQP2 COOH-terminal motif, we analyzed the published transcriptome and proteome databases of rat kidney collecting ducts (22Huling J.C.

Fifty-two PDZ domain-containing proteins were found in the two cell types. Because both cell types exhibit similar vasopressin-mediated AQP2 regulation, the PDZ domain-containing proteins common to both cell types made them good AQP2-interacting candidates. We next reasoned that apically expressed PDZ domain-containing proteins are better candidates to mediate apical AQP2 trafficking and analyzed the apical membrane proteomes of rat kidney collecting ducts (24Yu M.J. Pisitkun T. Wang G. Shen R.F. Knepper M.A. LC-MS/MS analysis of apical and basolateral plasma membranes of rat renal collecting duct cells.Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2006; 5: 2131-2145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and mpkCCD cells in this study (the mpkCCD Apical Membrane Proteome Database). Altogether, 5 PDZ domain-containing proteins were identified in the apical membrane proteome of collecting duct cells. Of these, four are common to both cell types, viz. Golgi-associated PDZ and coiled-coil motif-containing protein (Gopc), MAGUK p55 subfamily member 5 (Mpp5), PDZ domain-containing RING finger 3 (Pdzrn3), and Sipa1l1. To predict potential binding motifs, we used the BLAST program to align the PDZ domain sequences to those in a database of PDZ domains whose binding motifs have been characterized (25Tonikian R. Zhang Y. Sazinsky S.L. Currell B. Yeh J.H. Reva B. Held H.A. Appleton B.A. Evangelista M. Wu Y. Xin X. Chan A.C. Seshagiri S. Lasky L.A. Sander C. Boone C. Bader G.D. Sidhu S.S. A specificity map for the PDZ domain family.PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e239Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A summarizes the PDZ domain structures and the predicted binding motif logos. As seen, the PDZ domain of Gopc is most similar to the PDZ domain of human α1 syntrophin, which binds a motif logo similar to the AQP2 motif logo (Fig. 3B). The Sipa1l1 PDZ domain is most similar to the human SHANK3 PDZ domain that binds a motif logo similar to the AQP2 motif logo. The PDZ domain of Mpp5, the two PDZ domains of Pdzrn3, and the PDZ domain of Sipa1, a PDZ domain-containing protein previously shown to mediate AQP2 exocytosis (26Noda Y. Horikawa S. Furukawa T. Hirai K. Katayama Y. Asai T. Kuwahara M. Katagiri K. Kinashi T. Hattori M. Minato N. Sasaki S. Aquaporin-2 trafficking is regulated by PDZ-domain containing protein SPA-1.FEBS Lett. 2004; 568: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), were predicted not to bind the AQP2 motif in our analysis. Immunoblotting results showed that Gopc, Mpp5, and Sipa1l1 were expressed in the mpkCCD cells (Fig. 4, A, C, and E). Pdzrn3 was not detected due to the lack of an antibody of sufficient quality. Gopc and Sipa1l1 proteins were readily detectable in the total cell lysate, whereas Mpp5 protein was detected in the 17,000 × g membrane fraction. Exposure to 1 nm dDAVP for 1 h did not affect the protein levels of Gopc, Mpp5, and Sipa1l1 in the cells. On immunofluorescence confocal micrographs, Gopc and Mpp5 showed discrete intracellular localization from that of AQP2 (Fig. 4, B and D), whereas Sipa1l1 showed partial co-localization with AQP2 (Fig. 4F), suggesting potential interaction between Sipa1l1 and AQP2 in the mpkCCD cells. Indeed, co-immunoprecipitation using the AQP2 antibody followed by immunoblotting for Sipa1l1 showed results consistent with an interaction between AQP2 and Sipa1l1. Sipa1l1 was detected in the AQP2 immunoprecipitate of the mpkCCD cells expressing AQP2 and not in the AQP2 immunoprecipitate of the cells not expressing AQP2 (Fig. 5A). To examine functions of Sipa1l1 in AQP2 localization, Sipa1l1 was knocked down in the mpkCCD cells with two small hairpin RNA sequences (Fig. 5B) followed by immunofluorescence staining for AQP2 localization (Fig. 5C). As seen, most AQP2 was intracellular in the control cells before dDAVP stimulation (top left panel). Upon dDAVP stimulation, AQP2 trafficked to the apical membrane of the control cells (Fig. 5C, bottom left panel). In contrast, AQP2 was already in the apical plasma membrane in the Sipa1l1 knockdown cells without dDAVP stimulation (Fig. 5C, top right panel). Without dDAVP stimulation, AQP2 was intracellular in the control cells (Fig. 5C, top left panel). Fig. 5D summarizes the imaging results. To verify the imaging results, apical surface biotinylation coupled with streptavidin affinity purification and immunoblotting was used to compare the amounts of apical AQP2 in the control and the Sipa1l1 knockdown cells under the vehicle conditions (Fig. 5E). As seen, less apical AQP2 was detected in the control than in the Sipa1l1 knockdown cells under the vehicle conditions, consistent with a role of Sipa1l1 in AQP2 endocytosis in the absence of vasopressin.Figure 5Sipa1l1 participated in AQP2 endocytosis. A, immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by immunoblotting (IB) for testing AQP2-Sipa1l1 interaction. The mpkCCD cells were transfected with or without the wild-type AQP2 expression vector before the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the AQP2 antibody followed by immunoblotting for AQP2 and Sipa1l1. B, representative immunoblotting for Sipa1l1 in non-targeted control (shCon, TRCN0000072246: CAAATCACAGAATCGTCGTAT) and Sipa1l1 knockdown (shSipa1l1) mpkCCD cells.

The above hypothesis would predict a reduced binding preference of Sipa1l1 toward Ser-269-phosphorylated versus non-phosphorylated AQP2 peptides (Fig. 6A). Consistent with this, the Ser-269-phosphorylated AQP2 peptide was less capable of pulling down Sipa1l1 in the mpkCCD cell lysate compared with Ser-269 non-phosphorylated AQP2 peptide (Fig. 6, B and C). A similar binding preference was observed at the whole AQP2 protein level. AQP2 protein was immunoprecipitated from S269D or S269A AQP2 protein expressing mpkCCD cells before the amounts of Sipa1l1 bound to them were measured with immunoblotting. As seen in Fig. 6, D and E, the amount of Sipa1l1 bound to S269D AQP2 protein was significantly less than that bound to S269A AQP2 protein, consistent with a reduced Sipa1l1 binding with Ser-269-phosphorylated AQP2 protein. Because Sipa1l1 had a reduced binding preference for S269D AQP2, Sipa1l1 knockdown did not have apparent effects on the apical localization of S269D AQP2 in the absence of dDAVP (Fig. 6F, right panel). In contrast, Sipa1l1 knockdown resulted in apical localization of S269A AQP2 in the absence of dDAVP (Fig. 6G, right panel). In the absence of dDAVP, S269A AQP2 was intracellular in the control cells (Fig. 6G, left panel). To provide a molecular basis of the PDZ interaction between Sipa1l1 and AQP2, we modeled the structure of the Sipa1l1 PDZ domain based on the crystal structure of the NHERF PDZ domain for two reasons (27Karthikeyan S. Leung T. Ladias J.A. Structural determinants of the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor interaction with the β2-adrenergic and platelet-derived growth factor receptors.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18973-18978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). 1) The NHERF PDZ domain binds type I (Ser/Thr-X-Φ) ligands Ser-Leu-Leu of the β2 adrenergic receptor and Ser-Phe-Leu of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, similar to Ser-Lys-Ala of the murine AQP2 ligand motif. 2) Both NHERF and Sipa1l1 have PDZ domains with similar sequences in the loop between the β1 and β2 strands, which forms a binding pocket for the terminal carboxylate of the motif (28Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Crystal structures of a complexed and peptide-free membrane protein-binding domain: molecular basis of peptide recognition by PDZ.Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). As seen in the model (Fig. 7A), the AQP2 motif (PRGSKA) backbone lies in the groove (left panel) between the β2 strand and the α2 helix of the PDZ domain (right panel), forming hydrogen bonds with the backbone of the β2 strand (29Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. Mechanism and role of PDZ domains in signaling complex assembly.J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the model, the positive charged arginine 267 side chain of AQP2 forms salt bridges with the negatively charged glutamate side chain on the α2 helix (Fig. 7A, right panel). In addition, the positive Lys-270 side chain of the AQP2 motif points at the negative aspartate and glutamate side chains on the β3 strand of the Sipa1l1 PDZ domain, further strengthening the interaction. Note that Lys-270 points outward away from the Sipa1l1 PDZ domain and allows it to be ubiquitylated (Fig. 7C) (15Moeller H.B. Aroankins T.S. Slengerik-Hansen J. Pisitkun T. Fenton R.A. Phosphorylation and ubiquitylation are opposing processes that regulate endocytosis of the water channel aquaporin-2.J.

Thus, Lys-270-ubiquitylated AQP2 could still bind the Sipa1l1 PDZ domain. In addition, Lys-270 and Ser-269 point at different angles. Therefore, Lys-270 ubiquitylation and Ser-269 phosphorylation are not mutually exclusive. The -OH group of the Ser-269 side chain of the AQP2 motif forms a hydrogen bond with N3 of the imidazole ring of the conserved histidine side chain of the α2 helix (Fig. 7A, right panel) (28Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Crystal structures of a complexed and peptide-free membrane protein-binding domain: molecular basis of peptide recognition by PDZ.Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the -OH group creates a steric hindrance against the histidine side chain and adds a negative charge toward the hydrophobic isoleucine side chain on the α2 helix (Fig. 7B). Both are expected to destabilize the interaction between the Ser-269-phosphorylated AQP2 motif and the Sipa1l1 PDZ domain. Modeling using the human AQP2 motif PRGTKA yielded similar results. In this study, we describe a mechanism that controls the abundance of a membrane protein in the plasma membrane via the cytoplasmic COOH-terminal motif of the membrane protein. Cytoplasmic motifs of plasma membrane proteins often serve as signals for intracellular trafficking via interactions with adaptor proteins at various locations including the trans-Golgi network, plasma membrane, and recycling endosomes (30Mellman I.

We investigated the role of young stem cell antigen 1 (Sca-1)-positive BM cells on the aged heart by microarray analysis after BM reconstitution. Sca-1+ and Sca-1‒ BM cells from young green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive mice were used to reconstitute the BM of aged mice. Myocardial infarction (MI) was induced 3 mo later. GFP+ cells were more abundant in the BM, blood, and heart of Sca-1+ mice, which corresponded to preserved cardiac function after MI. At baseline, Sca-1+ BM reconstitution increased cardiac expression of serum response factor, vascular endothelial growth factor A, and myogenic genes, but reduced the expression of Il-1β. After MI, inflammation was identified as a key difference between Sca-1‒ and Sca-1+ groups, as cytokine expression and cell surface markers associated with inflammatory cells were up-regulated with Sca-1+ reconstitution. Mac-3 and F4/80 staining showed that the postinfarction heart was composed of a mixture of GFP+ (donor) macrophages, GFP‒(host) macrophages, and GFP+ cells that did not contribute to the macrophage population. This study demonstrates that Sca-1+ BM cells regulate cardiac healing though an acute inflammatory response and also before injury by stimulating formation of a beneficial cardiac niche.—Tobin, S.

Evidence-based interventions to promote fire safety practices exist, but the impact of implementing a range of these interventions in children's services has not been assessed. We developed an Injury Prevention Briefing (IPB), which brought together evidence about effective fire safety interventions and good practice in delivering interventions; plus training and facilitation to support its use and evaluated its implementation.We conducted a cluster randomised controlled trial, with integrated qualitative and cost-effectiveness nested studies, across four study sites in England involving children's centres in disadvantaged areas; participants were staff and families attending those centres. Centres were stratified by study site and randomised within strata to one of three arms: IPB plus facilitation (IPB+), IPB only, usual care. IPB+ centres received initial training and facilitation at months 1, 3, and 8. Baseline data from children's centres were collected between August 2011 and January 2012 and follow-up data were collected between June 2012 and June 2013. Parent baseline data were collected between January 2012 and May 2012 and follow-up data between May 2013 and September 2013. Data comprised baseline and 12 month parent- and staff-completed questionnaires, facilitation contact data, activity logs and staff interviews. The primary outcome was whether families had a plan for escaping from a house fire. Treatment arms were compared using multilevel models to account for clustering by children's centre.1112 parents at 36 children's centres participated. There was no significant effect of the intervention on families' possession of plans for escaping from a house fire (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) IPB only vs. usual care: 0.93, 95%CI 0.58, 1.49; AOR IPB+ vs. usual care 1.41, 95%CI 0.91, 2.20). However, significantly more families in the intervention arms reported more behaviours for escaping from house fires (AOR IPB only vs. usual care: 2.56, 95%CI 01.38, 4.76; AOR IPB+ vs. usual care 1.78, 95%CI 1.01, 3.15).Our study demonstrated that children's centres can deliver an injury prevention intervention to families in disadvantaged communities and achieve changes in home safety behaviours."

https://openalex.org/W2603570878,"Mass elevation and lee effects markedly influence snow lines and tree lines in high mountain systems. However, their impact on other phenomena or groups of organisms has not yet been quantified. Here we quantitatively studied their influence in the Himalaya–Tibet orogen on the distribution of ground beetles as model organisms, specifically whether the ground beetle distribution increases from the outer to the inner parts of the orogen, against latitudinal effects. We also tested whether July temperature and solar radiation are predictors of the beetle’s elevational distribution ranges. Finally, we discussed the general importance of these effects for the distributional and evolutionary history of the biota of High Asia. We modelled spatially explicit estimates of variables characterizing temperature and solar radiation and correlated the variables with the respective lower elevational range of 118 species of ground beetles from 76 high-alpine locations. Both July temperature and solar radiation significantly positively correlated with the elevational ranges of high-alpine beetles. Against the latitudinal trend, the median elevation of the respective species distributions increased by 800 m from the Himalayan south face north to the Transhimalaya. Our results indicate that an increase in seasonal temperature due to mass elevation and lee effects substantially impact the regional distribution patterns of alpine ground beetles of the Himalaya–Tibet orogen and are likely to affect also other soil biota there and in mountain ranges worldwide. Since these effects must have changed during orogenesis, their potential impact must be considered when biogeographic scenarios based on geological models are derived. As this has not been the practice, we believe that large biases likely exist in many paleoecological and evolutionary studies dealing with the biota from the Himalaya-Tibet orogen and mountain ranges worldwide."

Siegelbaum S.A. Kandel E.R. Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4: a005751Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) or provide synaptic stability through homeostatic regulation of neurotransmission (e.g., by changing neurotransmitter release probability to compensate for a change in the size of a postsynaptic response) (Davis, 2013Davis G.W. Neuron. 2013; 80: 718-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, the question remains; how do multiply innervated neurons integrate these signals, and are these signals global or specific? Further, what are the mechanisms by which a postsynaptic response feeds back onto multiple presynaptic inputs to regulate neurotransmission in each, and how are plasticity versus stability signals coordinated during behavior? An excellent model to address these questions has been the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction, an accessible model with powerful genetic tools that can independently dissect the contribution of pre- and postsynaptic elements to synaptic plasticity and homeostatic regulation. In addition, as the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a glutamatergic synapse, many of its molecular components are found in the excitatory synapses in the mammalian brain. In this issue of Neuron, Newman et al., 2017Newman Z.L. Hoagland A. Aghi K. Worden K.L. Levy S.L. Son J.H. Lee J.P. Isacoff E.Y. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 1388-1404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar use this system to address the above questions with high resolution and in living, unanesthetized animals. Larval NMJs are composed of synaptic boutons with the appearance of beads on a string. Each presynaptic bouton contains multiple active zones precisely opposed to clusters of glutamate receptors (GluR) in the muscle junctional region. Each GluR is comprised of four subunits: three conserved subunits (GluRIIC, GluRIID, and GluRIIE) and either GluRIIA or GluRIIB (DiAntonio, 2006DiAntonio A. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 2006; 75: 165-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Surrounding these postsynaptic GluR clusters is the Drosophila PSD-95 family member Discs-Large (DLG), a PDZ domain-containing scaffolding protein that binds the C-terminal of Shaker potassium channels (Ataman et al., 2006Ataman B. Budnik V. Thomas U. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 2006; 75: 181-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). DLG is distributed throughout a highly folded extrasynaptic muscle membrane surrounding each presynaptic bouton, the subsynaptic reticulum (SSR), where the above DLG-binding proteins and actin, as well as actin-binding proteins, accumulate. Nevertheless, DLG is absent from synaptic GluR clusters and thus from the PSD. Most larval body wall muscles are innervated by two types of morphologically distinct (and thus readily distinguishable) glutamatergic motorneuron terminals, type Ib (big) and type Is (small), which differ in synaptic bouton and SSR size, as well as firing patterns, neurotransmitter release properties, degree of facilitation (increase in the size of the postsynaptic response upon multiple closely timed stimulation events), and depression (decrease in the size of the postsynaptic response upon sustained high-frequency stimulation) (Kurdyak et al., 1994Kurdyak P. Atwood H.L. Stewart B.A. Wu C.F. J. Comp. Neurol. 1994; 350: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Studies over the past 30 years have demonstrated that these NMJs undergo a number of forms of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and homeostatic regulation. As an example of activity-dependent plasticity, spaced stimulation of motorneuron axons induces an increase in spontaneous release frequency and the formation of new immature boutons (Ataman et al., 2008Ataman B. Ashley J. Gorczyca M. Ramachandran P. Fouquet W. Sigrist S.J. Budnik V. Neuron. 2008; 57: 705-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Homeostatic regulation, on the other hand, is readily observed when glutamate receptor subunits are genetically downregulated, which elicits an increase in presynaptic release probability, thus maintaining the overall size of the excitatory response. This demonstrates the presence of a compensatory retrograde signal, which increases presynaptic neurotransmitter release in response to reduced postsynaptic neurotransmitter sensitivity. Newman et al., 2017Newman Z.L. Hoagland A. Aghi K. Worden K.L. Levy S.L. Son J.H. Lee J.P. Isacoff E.Y. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 1388-1404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar directly examined quantal excitatory postsynaptic responses in muscles of living larvae by expressing an improved genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI), SynapGCaMP6f (MHC-CD8-GCaMP6f-Sh) based on GCAMP6f fused to the PDZ-binding C-terminal 158 amino acids of Shaker potassium channels and expressing it in all body wall muscles using the myosin heavy chain (MHC) promotor. The C-terminal of Shaker directs the binding of SynapGCaMP6f to regions of the postsynaptic muscle containing DLG. Although Newman et al., 2017Newman Z.L. Hoagland A. Aghi K. Worden K.L. Levy S.L. Son J.H. Lee J.P. Isacoff E.Y. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 1388-1404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar state in their studies that SynapGCaMP6f is targeted to the “postsynaptic density (PSD),” this is not quite true, as the reporter becomes targeted to DLG-containing extrasynaptic regions that exclude the GluR clusters encompassing the PSD. Thus, SynapGCaMP6f is expected to be located up to several microns away from the PSD. Nevertheless, this method allows Newman et al., 2017Newman Z.L. Hoagland A. Aghi K. Worden K.L. Levy S.L. Son J.H. Lee J.P. Isacoff E.Y. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 1388-1404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar to image bouts of calcium signals in the vicinity of the PSD around hundreds of synaptic boutons as a result of endogenous activity in larval motorneurons. Type Ib and type Is inputs can be readily distinguished under these conditions by their activity patterns and basal fluorescence resulting from the different size of the SSR. Simultaneous quantal imaging, associated with peristaltic muscle contraction waves, can be visualized in unanesthetized animals restrained in a custom silicon imaging chamber. Imaging was combined with algorithms to specifically remap each pixel to its original cluster to compensate for muscle movement. This enables relating quantal synaptic responses from multiple separable motorneuron inputs to muscle contraction and the propagation of contraction waves across larval segments, corresponding to larval crawling behavior (Heckscher et al., 2012Heckscher E.S. Lockery S.R. Doe C.Q. J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 12460-12471Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), with unprecedented synaptic resolution. These fascinating studies yielded a number of unexpected results. First, they revealed that even though muscles are innervated by both type Ib and type Is motorneuron terminals, and both terminals appear active during contraction, local muscle contraction and associated calcium rise during this contraction were most closely associated with type Ib postsynaptic responses, which were also larger than those emanating from type Is terminals. These observations suggested that type Ib boutons were primarily accountable for muscle contraction. Interestingly, selectively blocking synaptic activity from type Is terminals by targeted expression of tetanus toxin in type Is motorneurons did not change the calcium signal associated with type Ib boutons, and muscle contractions appeared normal. However, under these conditions, muscle contraction failed to propagate far across segments, suggesting that type Is terminals contribute to intersegmental propagation of muscle contraction waves. In addition to the long-lasting activity of terminals during contraction, smaller and more infrequent events, consistent with being spontaneous quantal miniature events, were also observed. These were more frequent at type Ib boutons but larger in amplitude in type Is boutons, consistent with previous data (Peled et al., 2014Peled E.S. Newman Z.L. Isacoff E.Y. Curr. Biol. 2014; 24: 484-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, Melom et al., 2013Melom J.E. Akbergenova Y. Gavornik J.P. Littleton J.T. J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 17253-17263Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and represented a very small fraction of the postsynaptic Ca2+ signal. Notably, when calcium responses were mapped onto active zones from dissected and fixed samples, it was found that there was a 2-to-1 ratio of active zones to calcium responses, suggesting that a significant fraction of active zones are silent or had a low probability of release. In addition, in agreement with previous work (Peled et al., 2014Peled E.S. Newman Z.L. Isacoff E.Y. Curr. Biol. 2014; 24: 484-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, Melom et al., 2013Melom J.E. Akbergenova Y. Gavornik J.P. Littleton J.T. J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 17253-17263Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), it was found that there was little overlap between sites of spontaneous neurotransmitter release and those sites that released neurotransmitter upon stimulation, raising the possibility that active zones have some degree of specialization for either evoked or spontaneous release. To determine the input specificity of homeostatic plasticity, Newman et al., 2017Newman Z.L. Hoagland A. Aghi K. Worden K.L. Levy S.L. Son J.H. Lee J.P. Isacoff E.Y. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 1388-1404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar examined GluRIIA mutant larvae expressing SynapGCaMP6f and, as expected, observed a reduction in the amplitude of spontaneous Ca2+ events in both type Is and type Ib terminals. Despite the decreased amplitude of spontaneous events, when these samples were electrically stimulated, there was increased neurotransmitter release, as previously documented. However, this enhanced release probability and quantal density (total amount of response per bouton area) were derived from only type Ib, and not type Is, terminals, suggesting that homeostatic compensation was input specific. To examine synaptic plasticity at a quantal level, Newman et al., 2017Newman Z.L. Hoagland A. Aghi K. Worden K.L. Levy S.L. Son J.H. Lee J.P. Isacoff E.Y. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 1388-1404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar stimulated motor axons at high frequency in fileted preparations and monitored the resulting quantal fluorescent events. They observed different characteristics between the two motorneuron subtypes, namely that type Ib boutons showed facilitation or increased quantal density, while type Is boutons showed depression or decreased quantal density. Further, within Ib boutons they found that silent synapses were activated during stimulation, while in Is boutons they found that many synapses showed decreased fluorescence during stimulation. Finally, when these conditions were examined in a GluRIIA mutant background, it was found that there was no change in type Is depression and that the Ib enhancement was greatly reduced with a decreased number of silent synapses recruited. The suggestion was that homeostatic compensation acted by increasing synaptic release and decreasing the number of silent synapses recruited during high-frequency stimulation. Alternatively, this could represent the maximum amount of releasable vesicles or vesicle recycling machinery, that is, the system is already functioning at maximum capacity to maintain the enhanced release in a GluRIIA mutant background and simply can’t enhance much further. Finally, as previous work had shown a link between homeostatic signaling and postsynaptic CaMKII activity (reduced CaMKII, by expression of the inhibitory Ala peptide, shows similar enhancement of synaptic release as GluRIIA mutants and can actually enhance synaptic release in GluRIIA mutants) (Haghighi et al., 2003Haghighi A.P. McCabe B.D. Fetter R.D. Palmer J.E. Hom S. Goodman C.S. Neuron. 2003; 39: 255-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), Newman et al., 2017Newman Z.L. Hoagland A. Aghi K. Worden K.L. Levy S.L. Son J.H. Lee J.P. Isacoff E.Y. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 1388-1404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar sought to examine how CaMKII activity influenced quantal events. They found that muscle expression of the inhibitory peptide Ala enhanced release probability and quantal density at type Ib boutons (similar to GluRIIA mutations), but not in Is boutons. This raises the question as to whether there any differences in GluR composition between the two bouton subtypes. It is known that while GluRs from type Ib boutons contain GluRIIA and GluRIIB subunits, GluRs from type Is boutons have clusters primarily containing only GluRIIB receptors and only low levels of GluRIIA (DiAntonio, 2006DiAntonio A. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 2006; 75: 165-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This could explain why Is boutons fail to respond to deletion of GluRIIA. Further, as these receptors have very different kinetics, it could clarify why the two types of synapses respond differently to high-frequency stimulation. In conclusion, the studies in this paper advance our understanding of synaptic plasticity and homeostatic regulation of synapses in several important ways. First, they provide a unique paradigm to study the above processes in an intact, behaving animal, granting a truly physiological view of how hundreds of synapses onto a polyinnervated muscle operate simultaneously during behavior. Second, the observations suggest that short-term plasticity and homeostatic regulation of synapses are input specific rather than global. Third, together with previous analyses, they indicate that active zones have preferential functions for either spontaneous or evoked release. Spontaneous events have been previously suggested to have a signaling role in the development and maturation of synapses. While this study does not address this signaling function, it provides evidence for the diversification of synaptic function in signaling distinctive responses. Fourth, they provide a functional understanding of the two inputs converging on a target muscle, because although both inputs are glutamatergic and fire during muscle contraction, only one primarily drives contraction while the other likely aids in intersegmental coordination.

Differences occur between nucleotides encoded within DNA and the RNAs transcribed from these sequences. Such RNA editing can lead to changes in the amino acid composition of resulting proteins, and the removal of editing can have pathological consequences. Examining the occurrence of A-to-I editing in coding and noncoding RNA transcripts in 13 Drosophila species, Zhang et al. recorded the origin, loss, and maintenance of edited sites across the species. They found that editing can affect gene expression and that sites in both coding and noncoding sequences could be under evolutionary selection to maintain editing. In addition, RNA editing in the 3′ untranslated region of genes may contribute to mRNA degradation and may be a mechanism by which transcript levels are regulated.

Climate has clear effects on streams. Theory and observations both show that channel incision rates increase with precipitation, and chemical erosion rates scale with temperature, but how does the surface geometry of rivers depend on those factors? Seybold et al. analyzed nearly 1 million river junctions across the contiguous United States and found that branching angles vary systematically with climatic aridity. Branching angles are smaller in arid regions than in humid ones, where groundwater seepage is more important, and are stronger functions of aridity than of other commonly invoked controls such as topographic gradient or downstream concavity. These findings may aid in characterizing channelization processes in landscapes where relict streams are found, such as on Mars.

Mutations that activate Notch have been identified in several cancers. Weiland et al. find that Notch1 signaling within endothelial cells (ECs) promotes the invasion of distant organs by tumors. Abnormally high levels of active Notch1 are found in blood vessels associated with advanced human cancers. Similarly, in mice, when Notch1 is activated in the ECs, circulating tumor cells increase in the bloodstream. Mobilization of tumor cells leads to the recruitment of white blood cells called neutrophils into the tumors and the production of VCAM1, which is used by cancer cells to adhere to new sites. Therapies in mice targeting either VCAM1 or Notch1 are effective in reducing neutrophil influx and tumor progression.

Feng et al. made a sheet of boron atoms on a silver substrate that had a characteristic striped and flat structure. Although the atoms were not arranged in a hexagonal lattice, like carbon atoms are in graphene, the electronic structure of borophene showed similar linearly dispersing electronic states, called Dirac cones. The discovery may lead to applications of monolayer boron in electronic devices.

I did not know how to cope. I felt that I had let my family and teachers down, and I was embarrassed and bitter. That was 3 years ago. Since then, I've continued to experience the rejections that are a routine part of scientific training and research. But I have learned that, with the right mindset and some initiative and introspection, I can transform rejections into useful lessons to strengthen my future work.

> “With the right mindset … I can transform rejections into useful lessons.” 

I did get into my second-choice graduate school. But I continued to learn the lessons of rejection when I failed to win a small-scale writing contest. At first, I felt rather discouraged. I worried that asking for feedback might seem inappropriate and that I might come across as a sore loser. But I reasoned that there was no better way for me to improve than to take the initiative and ask. I took my time drafting the email to make sure that my tone was sincere, and I ended up receiving valuable comments that equipped me to go on to win two similar competitions.

Following up after rejections can also open the door to unexpected opportunities. A year ago, for example, I applied unsuccessfully for a science writing internship. I asked the editor whether there were any other ways I could contribute, and I was surprised to learn that I was welcome to pitch ideas for articles that I wanted to write. (The editor also assured me that my application was of decent quality, which restored my confidence in my writing ability.) A few months later, I contacted the editor with a pitch, and I was thrilled to be offered a paid contract to contribute an article.

Even when you don't get individual feedback or immediate further opportunities, you can still help yourself by trying to figure out why your application wasn't successful. Last year, for example, when my application for a short-term fellowship to do research in Germany was rejected, I decided to look more closely at the winners from past years. I found that almost all of the funded fellows studied disease biology, while my proposal had focused more on using biology for engineering and materials applications. Realizing that my rejection was due—at least in part—to the fact that it was a bad fit, and not necessarily a reflection on the quality of my proposal, made me feel better about my research. I also learned that it's important to do my homework. Now, I ensure that my application is a good fit by learning who was successful, and sometimes even contacting them for advice, before submission.

In other cases, understanding the reasons behind a rejection can suggest concrete ways to strengthen your work. For example, after looking into the students who were chosen for a program to work as journalists at a conference—which I was rejected from 2 years in a row—it dawned on me that the organizers were looking for people with experience writing informal blogstyle articles. I didn't have this type of background, and I had been selling myself as an academic writer. So, I started reading more scientific blogs and recently got an opportunity to start writing for one, which I hope can help me avoid a third rejection. I also learned that sometimes I need to be patient and put in the time and work to accumulate credentials if I am not a good fit at the moment.

There's a lot of advice out there about not feeling down after rejections. I beg to differ. I believe that it's OK to be stressed, upset, frustrated, and even to harbor self-doubt. The important thing is to harness these feelings so that they lead to something productive. Frankly speaking, I still have a hard time when my applications fail. As a final-year Ph.D. student applying for postdoc fellowships, I get worried even thinking about potential rejection. But as I contend with these negative thoughts, I remind myself to pick myself up and transform rejections into positive lessons.
