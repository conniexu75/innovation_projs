This demonstrates that learning is not essential for a crude form of auditory localization, directional oculomotor response, and coordination of auditory and visual functioning."

https://openalex.org/W2130405109,"A paste of washed Hemophilus parainfluenzae grown to the stationary phase with vigorous aeration appears tan to brown in color. Frozen cells are deep reddish brown and show absorption bands typical of cytochrome pigments when examined with a spectroscope. Studies with these bacteria show that the cytochromes are the major hematin enzymes present and that the respiratory metabolism has the properties of a cytochrome-linked system. There is very little catalase and no peroxidase activity. Under proper growth conditions, unusually large amounts of cytochrome are synthesized, particularly one with an absorption spectrum similar to that of cytochrome cl. Rupture of the stationary phase cells releases considerable quantities of this cytochrome in soluble form. The reduction of nitrate by H. parain$uenzae appears to involve reaction with the cytochrome system; this may explain why the organisms are facultative anaerobes."

One purified depressant compound, 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (juglone), has been isolated and tested on most of these species."

https://openalex.org/W72250877,"Earlier work in this laboratory (1) has shown that the diphosphopyridine nucleotide-linked n-P-hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase of animal tissues (2) is localized exclusively in the mitochondria. The enzyme is very firmly attached to the mitochondrial membranes (cf. l-5), in contrast to other pyridinelinked dehydrogenases of mitochondria, which are usually readily extracted after disruption of structure by means of sonic oscillations, chemical treatment, or hypotonicity. There is evidence that mitochondrial n-fi-hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase bears a special relationship to the components of the respiratory chain. Gamble and Lehninger (6) found that the bound diphosphopyridine nucleotide in digitonin fragments of rat liver mitochondrial membranes (7) is reactive with bound n-P-hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase, but it does not interact with other dehydrogenases present; the bound diphosphopyridine nucleotide is also unreactive with added alcohol dehydrogenase. Oxidation of o-P-hydroxybutyrate via bound DPN occurs with coupled formation of adenosinet.riphosphate; on the other hand, interaction of /3-hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase with added or “external” DPN produces nonphosphorylating electron transport (8). Devlin and Bedell (9) have shown that mitochondrial /3-hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase may, under certain conditions, serve as a “shuttle” system for the introduction of reducing equivalents from extramitochondrial DPNH to the phosphorylating respiratory chain. For these and other reasons, it was suggested that n-fl-hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase may serve some unique function in the respiratory chain and that the bound DPN with which it reacts is specifically concerned in phosphorylating electron transport (1, 10). In this paper, further evidence for a specific relationship between n-P-hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase and the respiratory chain is reported; this evidence was obtained from examination of the rather peculiar stability characteristics of the enzyme. n-/3-Hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase as it occurs in either sonic or digitonin fragments of rat liver mitochondria is relatively stable anaerobically, but is reversibly inactivated under aerobic conditions. The enzyme is almost completely protected from aerobic inactivation by the combined addition of succinate, DPN+, and ATP. When the dehydrogenase is inactivated aerobically, it can be reactivated again by incubation with thiols; however, the reactivation requires addition of oxidized DPN and reductants * Supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Nutrition Foundation, and the Whitehall Foundation. t Henry Strong Denison Scholar, 1959-1961. of the respiratory chain. These and other findings indicate a functional relationship between an essential thiol group or groups of P-hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase, the binding of DPN, and the action of succinate on the respiratory chain."

The mosquito was caught while biting a man, thus demonstrating that it would be possible for a monkey infection to be transmitted to man in nature."

https://openalex.org/W1971704287,Measurements in vivo are complicated by physical and physiological problems. Lack of standard techniques between laboratories and confusion in terminology have prompted this report. The theory underlying the method is presented with data comparing values obtained by different methods.

The present communication is a preliminary report of the nature of lyoglycogen. Lyoglycogen was obtained from the liver of six guinea pigs, two of which had been starved for 72 hr. and others that had had a normal diet. Hydrolysis of the resultant samples of lyoglycogen was carried out by refluxing with N/l sulphuric acid at 100° C. for 8 hr. The acid solution was neutralized with barium carbonate, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The solutions were applied to Whatman 3 MM papers which were developed in n-propanol–ethylacetate–water for 15–18 hr. Locating-reagents used were aniline-diphenylamine and silver nitrate."
