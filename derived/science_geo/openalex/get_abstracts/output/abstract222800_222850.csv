https://openalex.org/W2169393803,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the two most common neurodegenerative diseases that occur either in relatively rare, familial forms or in common, sporadic forms. The genetic defects underlying several monogenic familial forms of AD and PD have recently been identified, however, the causes of other AD and PD cases, particularly sporadic cases, remain unclear. To gain insights into the pathogenic mechanisms involved in AD and PD, we used a proteomic approach to identify proteins with altered expression levels and/or oxidative modifications in idiopathic AD and PD brains. Here, we report that the protein level of ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1), a neuronal de-ubiquitinating enzyme whose mutation has been linked to an early-onset familial PD, is down-regulated in idiopathic PD as well as AD brains. By using a combination of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, we have identified three human brain UCH-L1 isoforms, a full-length form and two amino-terminally truncated forms. Our proteomic analyses reveal that the full-length UCH-L1 is a major target of oxidative damage in AD and PD brains, which is extensively modified by carbonyl formation, methionine oxidation, and cysteine oxidation. Furthermore, immunohistochemical studies show that prominent UCH-L1 immunostaining is associated with neurofibrillary tangles and that the level of soluble UCH-L1 protein is inversely proportional to the number of tangles in AD brains. Together, these results provide evidence supporting a direct link between oxidative damage to the neuronal ubiquitination/de-ubiquitination machinery and the pathogenesis of sporadic AD and PD.

A prominent feature of AD and PD as well as other neurodegenerative diseases is the accumulation of insoluble proteinaceous deposits, such as senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in AD and Lewy bodies in PD (1Nussbaum R.L. Ellis C.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 1356-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). Although these deposits have different protein compositions, they all contain ubiquitin and ubiquitinated proteins (2Layfield R. Cavey J.R. Lowe J. Ageing Res. Rev. 2003; 2: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutations in two enzymes of the ubiquitination/de-ubiquitination system, parkin and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1), have been identified as causative genetic defects for certain familial forms of PD (3Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Science. 2003; 302: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). In familial AD patients, an aberrant form of ubiquitin resulting from a +1 frameshift mutation in the ubiquitin-B gene has been detected (4van Leeuwen F.W. Gerez L. Benne R. Hol E.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 1502-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Moreover, impaired proteasome function has been reported in idiopathic AD and PD brains (2Layfield R. Cavey J.R. Lowe J. Ageing Res. Rev. 2003; 2: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Collectively, these different lines of evidence support a role for dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in the pathogenesis of AD and PD.Oxidative stress is another important factor that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including AD and PD (5Beal M.F. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 6Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Both AD and PD have been associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which could result from genetic predisposition and/or environmental factors, such as exposure to pesticides (5Beal M.F. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Postmortem analyses reveal that the overall level of oxidative damage to proteins, lipids, and DNA is elevated in AD and PD brains (7Giasson B.I. Ischiropoulos H. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1264-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 8Jenner P. Ann. Neurol. 2003; 53 (discussion S36-S28): S26-S36Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar). Although oxidative stress and ubiquitin-proteasome dysfunction have both been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD and PD, the interplay between these two processes is not understood.Despite ample evidence indicating an elevation in overall protein oxidation in AD and PD, the specific protein targets of oxidative damage in these diseases are largely unknown. Furthermore, it remains to be determined whether the protein targets of oxidative damage are the same or are different in AD and PD. To address these issues, we performed a search for specific protein targets of oxidative damage in AD and PD brains by using a proteomic approach that combined two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis with mass spectrometry. This search led to the identification of three UCH-L1 isoforms that are differentially expressed and oxidized in AD and PD compared with control brains. Our results suggest that oxidative damage to the ubiquitination/de-ubiquitination machinery may be critically involved in the etiology of AD and PD.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESHuman Brain Samples—Frontal cortex tissues from five PD, five AD, and five healthy non-demented control subjects (Table I) were obtained from the Emory Alzheimer's Disease Center brain bank. The neuropathological diagnosis of PD was based on the presence of nigral degeneration and Lewy bodies. The diagnosis of AD was established using CERAD (Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease) criteria (9Mirra S.S. Heyman A. McKeel D. Sumi S.M. Crain B.J. Brownlee L.M. Vogel F.S.

Open table in a new tab Sample Preparation, DNP Derivatization, and Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Brain tissues were homogenized in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mg/ml benzamidine, 1 μm aprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, and 1 μm bestatin), followed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g. Protein samples (350 μg) were applied to 17-cm immobilized pH gradient (IPG) strips (pH 4-7) in an IPG re-swelling tray, and the strips were then isoelectrically focused on a Protein IEF Cell (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) for 24,000 V-h (11Choi J. Malakowsky C.A. Talent J.M. Conrad C.C. Gracy R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 1566-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Following isoelectric focusing, the strips were immediately subjected to in-strip DNP derivatization as described previously (12Conrad C.C. Choi J. Malakowsky C.A. Talent J.M. Dai R. Marshall P. Gracy R.W. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) by 15-min incubation in 2 n HCl/10 mm DNPH at 25 °C. After being washed with 2 m Tris-base/30% (v/v) glycerol for 15 min, the strips were equilibrated for 15 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) containing 6 m urea, 2% (w/v) SDS, 30% (v/v) glycerol, and 1.0% (w/v) dithiothreitol. The strips were then re-equilibrated for 15 min in the same buffer containing 2.5% (w/v) iodoacetamide instead of dithiothreitol. Second dimension separation was performed on SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels (10-20% porosity polyacrylamide) using the Ettan-DALT slab gel SDS-PAGE system (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ).SYPRO Ruby Staining—Duplicate samples of brain proteins were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis as described above. Proteins in one gel were stained with SYPRO Ruby protein gel stain (Bio-Rad), whereas proteins in the other gel were electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes using the Ettan-DALT system. For SYPRO Ruby staining, proteins were first fixed in the gel using 40% methanol/10% acetic acid (v/v) for 30 min. The gel was then incubated in SYPRO Ruby protein gel stain solution overnight and subsequently destained using 10% methanol/6% acetic acid (v/v) for 45 min. The SYPRO Ruby stained gel was placed in a light-tight cabinet directly on a transilluminator, and the fluorescence generated by excitation with UV light at 365 nm was recorded using a cooled, computerized charge-coupled device camera-based imaging system (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA).Immunoblotting and Image Analyses—The PVDF membranes were removed from the Ettan-DALT electroblotting apparatus and incubated for 1 h with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% (v/v) Tween and 5% (w/v) non-fat dried skim milk (PBS-TM). Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-DNP primary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 1:16,000 dilution as described previously (11Choi J. Malakowsky C.A. Talent J.M. Conrad C.C. Gracy R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 1566-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). After extensive washing with PBS-TM, the membranes were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with a 1:16,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Immunostained proteins were detected by using a SuperSignal chemiluminescence kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and an Alpha Innotech imaging system. Digitized images from SYPRO Ruby-stained gels and immunoblots were analyzed using the two-dimensional electrophoresis gel analysis program PD Quest (Bio-Rad).Mass Spectrometry—Spots of interest were excised from the gels and digested in situ with trypsin (modified, Promega, Madison, WI). The resulting digests were subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) and capillary HPLC-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI/MS/MS). MALDI-TOF mass spectra were acquired on an Applied Biosystems Voyager DE-STR. The peptide mass maps produced by MALDI-TOF/MS were searched against the published databases by means of the MS-Fit module in Protein Prospector (available at prospector.ucsf.edu/ucsfhtml3.4/msfit.htm) and Mascot (Matrix Science, available at www.matrixscience.com). Electrospray ionization mass spectra were acquired on a Finnigan LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer adapted for microspray ionization sample introduction. On-line HPLC separation of the tryptic peptides was accomplished with a Michrom MAGIC 2002 micro HPLC column, PicoFrit™ (New Objective; 75-μm inner diameter) packed to 10 cm with C18 adsorbent (Vydac; 218MSB5; 5 μm, 300 Å); mobile phase A, 0.5% acetic acid/0.005% trifluoroacetic acid; mobile phase B, 90% acetonitrile/0.5% acetic acid/0.005% trifluoroacetic acid; linear gradient of 2 to 72% B in 30 min; flow rate, 0.4 μl/min. As a part of the data-dependent acquisition protocol, the four most intense ions in each survey scan were sequentially fragmented in the ion trap by collision-induced dissociation using an isolation width of 2.5 and a relative collision energy of 35%. Uninterpreted MS/MS spectra were analyzed by the SEQUEST component of the LCQ software and by Mascot (Matrix Science). Assignment of the MS/MS fragments was verified by comparison with the predicted ions generated in silico by GPMAW (Lighthouse Data).Immunohistochemistry—Brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, cryoprotected in sucrose, and serial sections (50 μm) of cingulate cortex were cut on a cryostat. Sections were treated with 3% H2O2 to eliminate endogenous peroxidase activity and blocked with a solution containing 8% goat serum, 10 μg/ml avidin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.9% NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2). Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-UCH-L1 (1:1000; Chemicon) followed by incubation with biotinylated secondary antibody (1:200). Bound antibodies were detected using a standard avidin-biotinylated peroxidase complex (ABC) method (Vectastain Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories). Sections were observed using a Leica DC500 microscope, and images were captured with a C4742-95 Hamamatsu digital camera.Quantitation of Neurofibrillary Tangles—Eight-micron sections of paraformaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded frontal cortex from the same five AD cases used for analysis of oxidation-sensitive proteins were deparaffinized and blocked with 0.5% nonfat dried skim milk. Sections were then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-tau antibody (Accurate Chemical and Scientific Inc.) at 1:100 for 1 h at 37 °C followed by incubation with biotinylated secondary antibody. Bound antibodies were detected using the Vectastain Elite ABC method. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Neurofibrillary tangles were counted in 10 random 20× fields by an investigator blinded to the protein analysis results.RESULTSDifferential Expression of Proteins in PD and AD Brains Compared with Age-matched Controls—To investigate alterations in protein expression associated with PD and AD, we performed comparative high resolution, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis experiments on protein samples obtained from PD and AD brains and age-matched controls. Protein spots were visualized by staining with SYPRO Ruby, a fluorescent dye capable of achieving linear and sensitive staining of proteins. Fig. 1 shows partial images of SYPRO Ruby-stained two-dimensional gels of brain proteins from three individuals from the control, PD, and AD groups. These images illustrate a high degree of reproducibility of protein profiles among different subjects diagnosed with the same disease. We found that three distinct protein spots, #1, #2, and #3, which electrophoresed on the two-dimensional gel with apparent molecular mass/isoelectric point (pI) values of 25 kDa/5.7, 19 kDa/6.1, and 17 kDa/6.1, respectively, showed differential expression among control, PD, and AD (Fig. 1). Quantification of the intensities of these spots (Fig. 2) revealed that, in AD, the protein levels of all three spots were decreased by ∼50% compared with age-matched controls. In PD, the level of spot #1 was decreased by 30%, whereas the levels of spots #2 and #3 were virtually unaltered.Fig. 2Differential expression of three specific protein spots in PD, AD, and control brains. The intensity of protein spots #1, #2, and #3 indicated in Fig. 1 was measured by using the two-dimensional gel analysis program PD Quest. Values represent mean ± S.E. for five PD, five AD, and five control individuals. The data were analyzed statistically by analysis of variance. The asterisk indicates statistically significant (p < 0.05) difference in the protein level of each spot in PD or AD versus control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Oxidative Modification of Specific Proteins in PD and AD Brains—A common oxidative modification of proteins induced by reactive oxygen species is the formation of protein carbonyls, which can be detected by reaction with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH). To identify protein targets of oxidative damage in PD and AD, brain extracts from PD, AD, and control subjects were resolved by isoelectric focusing on an immobilized pH-gradient strip followed by in-strip DNP derivatization (reacting with protein carbonyls) and second-dimensional separation by SDS-PAGE. Oxidatively modified proteins in the two-dimensional gels were detected by immunoblotting with anti-DNP antibody. Interestingly, among the three protein spots described earlier (spots #1, #2, and #3), only spot #1 was found to exhibit a high degree of oxidation, as evidenced by the significant increase in DNP antibody reactivity of this spot in PD and AD brains (Fig. 3). Quantification results showed that the specific oxidation level of spot #1 was increased ∼10-fold in PD and 8-fold in AD compared with age-matched control brains (Table II).Fig. 3Oxidation of specific proteins in PD, AD, and control brains. Protein samples of control (A), PD (B), and AD (C) brains were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, followed by SYPRO Ruby staining for total proteins (left panel) or by immunostaining with anti-DNP antibody for oxidized proteins (right panel).

Open table in a new tab Identification of Protein Spots #1, #2, and #3 as UCH-L1 Isoforms by Mass Spectrometry—For identification of individual proteins of interest, the spots were excised from the two-dimensional gel, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by mass spectrometry (Figs. 4 and 5). Three of the brain protein spots (spots #1, #2, and #3) shown in Figs. 1 and 3 were unambiguously identified as UCH-L1. Fig. 4A shows the peptide sequences of human UCH-L1 in spots #1, #2, and #3 that were detected by using a combination of MALDI-TOF/MS and HPLC-ESI/MS/MS. Data from the mass spectrometric analyses indicated that spot #1 represents the full-length form of human UCH-L1 (accession number NP_004172). This assignment is further strengthened by the agreement between the apparent molecular mass/pI values (25 kDa/5.7) of spot #1 and the predicted values of 24.8 kDa/5.3. By comparison of the mass spectral profiles, we found that the tryptic fragment of spot #1 containing the amino-terminal 15 amino acids of UCH-L1 was missing from the mass spectra of spots #2 and #3 (Fig. 4, compare A with B). Furthermore, the apparent molecular mass of spot #2 (19 kDa) and spot #3 (17 kDa) were significantly lower than the predicted 24.8 kDa for full-length UCH-L1. Together, these data suggest that spots #2 and #3 represent UCH-L1 isoforms with amino termini that are shorter than the published full-length sequence for UCH-L1.Fig. 4Mass spectral analyses of tryptic digests of protein spots #1, #2, and #3 in Fig. 1.

The results indicated that three methionine residues, Met-1, Met-6, and Met-12, at the amino terminus of UCH-L1 were oxidized to methionine sulfoxide (MetO) in spot #1 from PD and AD samples (Figs. 4 and 5A). In addition, Met-124 in spots #1 and #3 and Met-179 in spots #1 and #2 were also found to be MetO in PD and AD brains (Fig. 4 and additional data not shown). Finally, Cys-220, a cysteine residue in the carboxyl-terminal region of UCH-L1, was found to be oxidized to cysteic acid (also known as cysteine sulfonic acid, Cys-SO3H) in all three spots (spots #1, #2, and #3) from PD and AD samples (Figs. 4 and 5B).Confirmation of the Protein Identity of Spots #1, #2, and #3 by Western Blot Analysis—To confirm the protein identifications obtained by mass spectrometry, we performed immunoblot analysis of the same brain protein extracts using an antibody generated against a synthetic peptide composed of amino acids 61-78 of human UCH-L1. Because a peptide fragment matching amino acids 64-78 of human UCH-L1 was positively identified in spots #1, #2, and #3 by mass spectrometry (Fig. 4), it was expected that this anti-UCH-L1 antibody should recognize all three UCH-L1 isoforms. Indeed, Western blot analysis (Fig. 6) demonstrated that all three protein spots (spots #1, #2, and #3) were immunoreactive to the anti-UCH-L1 antibody, providing further evidence in support of their identification as UCH-L1 isoforms.Fig. 6Immunological confirmation of protein spots #1, #2, and #3 as UCH-L1 isoforms. Human brain proteins (350 μg) were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, followed by immunoblotting with anti-UCH-L1 antibody. All three protein spots identified by mass spectrometry as UCH-L1 isoforms were immunoreactive.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Association of UCH-L1 with Neurofibrillary Tangles in AD Brains—Because UCH-L1 was identified as a significantly oxidized protein with altered expression in PD and AD brains, we used immunohistochemistry to investigate whether UCH-L1 is associated with neuropathological hallmarks of these diseases, such as neurofibrillary tangles, senile plaques, and Lewy bodies. In control human brains, UCH-L1 immunoreactivity was observed in neuronal cell bodies and processes throughout the neocortex (Fig. 7A). The UCH-L1 immunostaining patterns of PD brains were similar to the controls, although the intensity of the immunostaining was somewhat decreased in PD compared with the control group (Fig. 7B). No UCH-L1 immunoreactivity was detected in Lewy bodies of PD brains or in senile plaques of AD brains (data not shown). In contrast, prominent UCH-L1 immunostaining was associated with neurofibrillary tangles, a neuropathological lesion containing polymerized microtubule-associated protein tau (Fig. 7, C and D).Fig. 7Immunohistochemical analysis of UCH-L1 expression in PD, AD, and control brains. Sections of cingulate cortical regions from control (A), PD (B), or AD (C-F) brains were immunostained with antibodies against UCH-L1 (A-D) or tau (E and F).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Correlation of UCH-L1 Levels with Neurofibrillary Tangle Numbers in AD—Next, we assessed the relationship between soluble UCH-L1 protein levels and the numbers of neurofibrillary tangles in AD brains. The number of neurofibrillary tangles in the frontal cortex of individual AD patients was quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures” and compared with the total levels of all three UCH-L1 isoforms in the corresponding protein samples (Table III). Linear regression analysis revealed that the quantities of soluble UCH-L1 protein were inversely proportional to tangle number (r = -0.94997, p ≤ 0.05 by Pearson's r).Table IIICorrelation between UCH-L1 levels and tangle numbers in AD brainsSamplesTangle numbersUCH-L1 protein levelAD #122.8 ± 1.841 ± 8AD #221.0 ± 6.933 ± 9AD #318.8 ± 3.965 ± 13AD #42.9 ± 1.9106 ± 10AD #50 ± 0100 ± 15 Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONAlthough UCH-L1 has been implicated in a rare familial form of PD (13Leroy E.

Nature. 1998; 395: 451-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar), little is currently known about the role of UCH-L1 in the more common, sporadic forms of PD and in other age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD. In this study, we found that human brain UCH-L1 exists as three different isoforms: a full-length form (isoform #1) and two amino-terminally truncated forms (isoforms #2 and #3). The truncated isoforms could be specific products of in vivo proteolytic processing or nonspecific cleavage fragments of postmortem degradation of UCH-L1. We favor the first interpretation, because the levels of isoforms #2 and #3 were very similar among samples of the control and PD groups with different postmortem intervals (Table I and Figs. 1 and 2). Furthermore, the levels of UCH-L1 isoforms #2 and #3 were decreased only in AD, but not in PD brains (Figs. 1 and 2), suggesting that there might be disease-specific alterations in amino-terminal processing of UCH-"
https://openalex.org/W2120245260,"Cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase 1 (Apx1) is a key H2O2 removal enzyme in plants. Microarray analysis of Apx1-deficient Arabidopsis plants revealed that the expression of two zinc finger proteins (Zat12 and Zat7) and a WRKY transcription factor (WRKY25) is elevated in knock-out Apx1 plants grown under controlled conditions. Because mutants lacking Apx1 accumulate H2O2, we examined the correlation between H2O2 and the expression of Zat12, Zat7, WRKY25, and Apx1. The expression of Zat12, Zat7, and WRKY25 was simultaneously elevated in cells in response to oxidative stress (i.e. H2O2 or paraquat application), heat shock, or wounding. In contrast, light or osmotic stress did not enhance the expression of these putative transcription factors. All stresses tested enhanced the expression of Apx1. Transgenic plants expressing Zat12 or Zat7 could tolerate oxidative stress. In contrast, transgenic plants expressing WRKY25 could not. Although the expression of Zat12, Zat7, or WRKY25 in transgenic plants did not enhance the expression of Apx1 under controlled conditions, Zat12-deficient plants were unable to enhance the expression of Apx1, Zat7, or WRKY25 in response to H2O2 or paraquat application. Zat12-deficient plants were also more sensitive than wild type plants to H2O2 application as revealed by a higher level of H2O2-induced protein oxidation detected in these plants by protein blots. Our results suggest that Zat12 is an important component of the oxidative stress response signal transduction network of Arabidopsis required for Zat7, WRKY25, and Apx1 expression during oxidative stress. Cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase 1 (Apx1) is a key H2O2 removal enzyme in plants. Microarray analysis of Apx1-deficient Arabidopsis plants revealed that the expression of two zinc finger proteins (Zat12 and Zat7) and a WRKY transcription factor (WRKY25) is elevated in knock-out Apx1 plants grown under controlled conditions. Because mutants lacking Apx1 accumulate H2O2, we examined the correlation between H2O2 and the expression of Zat12, Zat7, WRKY25, and Apx1. The expression of Zat12, Zat7, and WRKY25 was simultaneously elevated in cells in response to oxidative stress (i.e. H2O2 or paraquat application), heat shock, or wounding. In contrast, light or osmotic stress did not enhance the expression of these putative transcription factors. All stresses tested enhanced the expression of Apx1. Transgenic plants expressing Zat12 or Zat7 could tolerate oxidative stress. In contrast, transgenic plants expressing WRKY25 could not. Although the expression of Zat12, Zat7, or WRKY25 in transgenic plants did not enhance the expression of Apx1 under controlled conditions, Zat12-deficient plants were unable to enhance the expression of Apx1, Zat7, or WRKY25 in response to H2O2 or paraquat application. Zat12-deficient plants were also more sensitive than wild type plants to H2O2 application as revealed by a higher level of H2O2-induced protein oxidation detected in these plants by protein blots. Our results suggest that Zat12 is an important component of the oxidative stress response signal transduction network of Arabidopsis required for Zat7, WRKY25, and Apx1 expression during oxidative stress. Plants are sessile organisms that evolved a complex and specialized network of regulatory genes to control their response to changes in environmental conditions. It is likely that many of these regulatory genes were initially created by gene duplication and that they later acquired roles specifically related to individual pathways or stresses as well as their combination (1Chen W.

The different regulatory networks of plants are also involved in modulating the production and scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; Apx, ascorbate peroxidase; CaMV, cauliflower mosaic virus; KO, knock-out; MAPK, mitogen-activated kinase; Rubisco, ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. in cells. These toxic intermediates of oxygen reduction not only control different plant responses to environmental and developmental cues but also potently inhibit essential metabolic pathways and may lead to cell death (6Epple P.

Although a number of different enzymes and proteins produce or scavenge ROS in cells, little is known about how the different regulatory networks of plants control these enzymes and proteins and modulate the steady-state level of ROS (8Neill S. Desikan R. Hancock J. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 388-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar, 9Mittler R.

The steady-state level of a number of different transcripts encoding transcription factors such as MYB, WRKY, heat shock transcription factors, and different zinc finger proteins is elevated in plants in response to different forms of ROS-induced stress (11Vranova E.

Chem. 2003; 278: 38921-38925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, genetic evidence supporting a direct regulatory role for these transcripts was only presented for two zinc finger proteins, Lsd1 and Lol1, which were recently found to mediate ROS signals and control programmed cell death in Arabidopsis (6Epple P. Mack A.A. Morris V.R. Dangl J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6831-6836Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and for heat shock transcription factor 3, which was shown to enhance cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase (Apx) expression in the absence of stress (15Panchuk I.I. Volkov R.A. Schoffl F. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 838-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) We are studying the response of plants to overaccumulation of ROS in cells (i.e. oxidative stress; Ref. 9Mittler R. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 9: 405-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (7856) Google Scholar). Our goal is to identify and characterize the transcription factor network that controls the response of plants to oxidative stress. To dissect and study the ROS signal transduction network of plants, we are using knock-out plants deficient in key ROS-scavenging enzymes (13Pnueli L. Liang H. Rozenberg M. Mittler R. Plant J. 2003; 34: 187-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 14Rizhsky L. Liang H. Mittler R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38921-38925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). These plants provide an ideal experimental system to study plant responses to ROS accumulation, because they accumulate ROS and activate multiple defense mechanisms in the absence of externally applied stimuli such as stress, ROS, or ROS generators. Moreover, the ROS that accumulate in these mutants are ROS naturally produced in cells at the different cellular ROS-producing sites and not externally applied ROS that may activate additional signaling pathways, including pathogen or abiotic stress response pathways (13Pnueli L. Liang H. Rozenberg M. Mittler R. Plant J. 2003; 34: 187-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 14Rizhsky L. Liang H. Mittler R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38921-38925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Knock-out plants deficient in cytosolic Apx1 are of particular interest. They maintain a high steady-state level of H2O2 in cells and activate ROS defense mechanisms when grown under controlled conditions (13Pnueli L. Liang H. Rozenberg M. Mittler R. Plant J. 2003; 34: 187-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). These plants are also altered in their growth, flowering time, and stomatal responses and display an augmented induction of heat shock proteins and catalase in response to light stress. Microarray analysis of knock-out Apx1 plants grown under controlled conditions revealed that the expression of at least two different zinc finger proteins (Zat7 and Zat12), a putative WRKY transcription factor (WRKY25), and a number of heat shock transcription factors is elevated in these plants (13Pnueli L. Liang H. Rozenberg M. Mittler R. Plant J. 2003; 34: 187-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The expression of Zat12 is also elevated in cultured Arabidopsis cells in response to H2O2 application (12Desikan R. Mackerness A.H. Hancock J.T. Neill S.J. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar) and in mature Arabidopsis plants in response to cold stress, wounding, or high light stress (Refs. 16Cheong Y.H. Chang H.S. Gupta R. Wang X. Zhu T. Luan S. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 661-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 17Fowler S. Thomashow M.F. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1675-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar, 18Iida A. Kazuoka T. Torikai S. Kikuchi H. Oeda K. Plant J. 2000; 24: 191-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; stresses that result in ROS accumulation in cells). No direct link was reported between Zat12 expression and the expression of different ROS-scavenging transcripts such as those encoding Apx1. This finding stands in contrast to the established relationship between Apx1 expression and heat shock transcription factors (13Pnueli L. Liang H. Rozenberg M. Mittler R. Plant J. 2003; 34: 187-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 15Panchuk I.I. Volkov R.A. Schoffl F. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 838-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The elevated expression of Zat12, Zat7, and WRKY25 in Apx1-deficient plants suggests a link between H2O2 accumulation, the expression of these putative regulatory genes, and Apx1 expression. In this study we examined the relationship between Zat12, Zat7, and WRKY25 expression, oxidative stress, and Apx1 expression. Our results suggest that Zat12 is essential for Zat7, WRKY25, and Apx1 expression during oxidative stress and that Zat12, Zat7, and WRKY25 are linked to H2O2 stress in plants. Plant Material and Growth Conditions—Arabidopsis thaliana (cv. Columbia and WS) plants were grown in growth chambers (Percival E-30) under controlled conditions (21-22 °C, 18 h or constant light cycle, 100 μmol m-2 sec-1, and a relative humidity of 70%). Knock-out Arabidopsis lines containing a T-DNA insert in the Zat12 gene (KO-Zat12; obtained through the SIGnAL project; signal.salk.edu/tabout.html) were outcrossed and selfed to check for segregation and to obtain pure homozygous lines as described (13Pnueli L. Liang H. Rozenberg M. Mittler R. Plant J. 2003; 34: 187-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 14Rizhsky L. Liang H. Mittler R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38921-38925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Analysis of Zat12 knock-out and segregation was performed by PCR and genomic DNA blots (13Pnueli L. Liang H. Rozenberg M. Mittler R. Plant J. 2003; 34: 187-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Screening for expression of Zat12 by RNA blots was performed with leaf tissues obtained from wounded and control wild type and knock-out plants 1 h following wounding. Wounding of plants was performed with needles as described (19Rizhsky L. Mittler R. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 46: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Transformation of Arabidopsis plants was performed as described (14Rizhsky L. Liang H. Mittler R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38921-38925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 20Bent A.F. Clough S.J. Gelvin S.B. Schilperoort R.A. Plant Molecular Biology Manual. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2000: B7:1-B7:14Google Scholar), and transgenic plants were screened by RNA blots (14Rizhsky L. Liang H. Mittler R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38921-38925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times (with the exception of DNA arrays, which were performed as described below). Molecular and Biochemical Analysis—RNA and protein were isolated and analyzed by RNA and protein blots as described previously (13Pnueli L. Liang H. Rozenberg M. Mittler R. Plant J. 2003; 34: 187-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 14Rizhsky L. Liang H. Mittler R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38921-38925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Detection of protein oxidation was performed with the OxyBlot protein oxidation kit (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) as recommended by the manufacturer. The identity of the major protein bend oxidized in KO-Zat12 plants was determined by immunoprecipitation with an antibody against Rubisco as described (21Mittler R. Feng X. Cohen M. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 461-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). RNA staining or a ribosomal 18 S rRNA probe were used to control for RNA loading. Coomassie Blue staining of protein gels was used to control for protein loading. Zat12 (At5g59820), Zat7 (At3g46080), and WRKY25 (At2g30250) detection by RNA blots was performed with gene-specific probes. Full-length clones for WRKY25 were obtained from RIKIN (www.brc.riken.go.jp/lab/epd/Eng/index.html), and full-length cDNA clones for Zat7 and Zat12 were cloned by reverse transcription PCR using mRNA prepared from cells 1 h following wounding (13Pnueli L. Liang H. Rozenberg M. Mittler R. Plant J. 2003; 34: 187-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 19Rizhsky L. Mittler R. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 46: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Clones were sequenced and compared with genomic sequences of Zat12 and Zat7. Gene-specific probes (∼200bp) were prepared by PCR according to (22Mittler R. Zilinskas B. Plant J. 1994; 5: 397-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) using the following primers: Zat12 left, 5′-CACAAACCACAAGAGGATCATTTC-3′ and Zat12 right, 5′-GACGTTTTCACCTTCTTCATCAAT-3′; Zat7 left, 5′-TCAAAACCCTAG AAGTCACTA-3′ and Zat7 right, 5′-CAAGAAGTGATGGATTGTC AC-3′; and WRKY25 left, 5′-AGAAATCTTAAAGTTGTCTCCTTT-3′ and WRKY25 right, 5′-TGGAAACGTTCCTGTTGTTGGAG-3′. DNA Chip Analysis—In two independent experiments, RNA was isolated from 40-50 wild type, KO-Zat12, or KO-Apx1 plants (a total of 80-100 plants per line, in triplicate) grown under controlled conditions as described above. This RNA was used to perform chip analyses (Arabidopsis ATH1 chips; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) at the University of Iowa DNA facility (dna-9.int-med.uiowa.edu/microarrays.htm). Conditions for RNA isolation, labeling, hybridization, and data analysis are described (13Pnueli L. Liang H. Rozenberg M. Mittler R. Plant J. 2003; 34: 187-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 14Rizhsky L. Liang H. Mittler R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38921-38925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Comparative analysis of samples was performed with the GeneChip mining tool version 5.0 and the Silicon Genetics GeneSpring V 5.1. Some of the comparison results were confirmed by RNA blots. Stress Assays—For the analysis of oxidative stress tolerance of transgenic plants constitutively expressing Zat12, Zat7, and WRKY25, seeds of wild type and transgenic lines were surface-sterilized with bleach and placed in rows on 1% agar plates (0.5× Murashige and Skoog medium) containing different concentrations of paraquat (Sigma). Each row of seeds placed on a plate was divided into two parts, wild type seeds and seeds of transgenic plants. Thus, the different seeds were placed side by side on the same plate. Plates were maintained vertically in a growth room (21-22 °C, constant light, and 80-100 μmol m-2 sec-1), and the percentage of germination and root length were scored 5 days after seed sterilization and plating. Heat shock and light stress were performed as described (13Pnueli L. Liang H. Rozenberg M. Mittler R. Plant J. 2003; 34: 187-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Osmotic stress and H2O2 and paraquat stresses were performed by subjecting 5-day-old seedlings grown in liquid culture (0.5× Murashige and Skoog medium, 21-22 °C, and 100 μmol m-2 sec-1) to polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000, 0-2%), paraquat (0-1 μm), or H2O2 (0-20 mm) for 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 h. Expression Analysis of Zat12, Zat7, and WRKY25—To examine the correlation between Zat12, Zat7, WRKY25, and Apx1 expression in response to oxidative stress or different abiotic stresses, we subjected wild type plants to H2O2 stress, heat shock, a moderate level of light stress (400 μmol m-2 sec-1), wounding, paraquat (a superoxide-generating agent), and osmotic stress. As shown in Fig. 1, the steady-state level of transcripts encoding Zat12, Zat7, and WRKY25 was elevated in cells in response to H2O2, heat shock, wounding, or paraquat application. In contrast, a moderate level of light stress or osmotic stress did not enhance the expression of these transcripts. The level of transcripts encoding Apx1 was elevated by all treatments, suggesting specifically that oxidative stress (H2O2 or paraquat), wounding, and heat shock (Fig. 1) present a clear correlation between Zat12, Zat7, WRKY25, and Apx1 expression. Analysis of the promoter regions of Zat12, Zat7, and WRKY25, performed with the plantCARE software (sphinx.rug.ac.be:8080/PlantCARE/cgi/index.html), revealed that a number of putative DNA binding sites are common among all three genes and Apx1 (Table I). These include a number of light response elements (not shown in Table I), methyl jasmonate (MeJA), ethylene, gibberellin, and salicylic acid response elements, a wound response element (WUN), a MYB-binding site, and the heat shock transcription factor binding site (heat shock element or HSE; Table I). In addition, two conserved motifs with an unknown function (5′-GAGACGCGGTGACAC-3′ and 5′-TCGTCCCAGCC-3′) were identified in the promoters of Zat12, Zat7, WRKY25, and Apx1 using the MEME software (meme.sdsc.edu/meme/website/intro.html). Because these motifs were found in the promoters of all four genes, it is possible that they are involved in regulating the expression of these genes during abiotic stress or oxidative stress (Fig. 1). In addition, the expression of Zat12, Zat7, WRKY25, and Apx1 during wounding or heat shock could be explained by the presence of the wound response element (WUN) or heat shock element (HSE) binding sites in the promoters of these genes. Interestingly, the expression of Zat12 was not elevated in response to a moderate level of light stress (400 μmol m-2 sec-1). This result conflicts with a previous report on the expression of Zat12 during high light stress (400-1800 μmol m-2 sec-1; Ref. 18Iida A. Kazuoka T. Torikai S. Kikuchi H. Oeda K. Plant J. 2000; 24: 191-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and with the presence of many different light response elements in the promoter of Zat12 (light response elements in the promoters of Zat7 and WRKY25 were also found to be non-responsive to the same moderate light stress treatment; Fig. 1).Table IPutative regulatory sequences found in the promoters of Zat12, Zat7, WRKY25, and Apx1Gene and corresponding regulatory elementsFunction of regulatory elementZat12Zat7WRKY25Apx1A-boxA-boxA-boxA-boxCommon to α-amylase promotersABREABREABREABA responseAuxRRAuxRRAuxRRAuxin responeAs1As1Root expressionCGTCA-mCGTCA-mCGTCA-mMeJA responseELI-box3ELI-box3ELI-box3ELI-box3Elicitor responseEREEREEREEREEthylene responseEIREEIREEIREElicitor responseGCN4-mGCN4-mGCN4-mEndosperm expressionHSEHSEHSEHSEHeat shock responseLTRLTRLow temp responseMREMREMREMREMYB bindingMSAMSAMSACell cycleP boxP boxP boxP boxGibberellin responseProlamin boxProlamin boxEndosperm expressionSkn-1Skn-1Skn-1Skn-1Endosperm expressionTATC boxTATC boxTATC boxTATC boxGibberellin responseTCA elementTCA elementTCA elementTCA elementSalicylic acid responseTGA boxTGA boxTGA boxAuxin responseTGACG-mTGACG-mTGACG-mTGACG-mMeJA responseWUN-mWUN-mWUN-mWUN-mWound-response Open table in a new tab Time course analysis of Zat12, Zat7, WRKY25, and Apx1 expression during H2O2 stress (Fig. 2) revealed that the steady-state level of transcripts encoding Zat12, Zat7, and WRKY25 is elevated in plants prior to the elevation in Apx1 expression. In addition, the expression of Zat12, Zat7, and WRKY25 was transient and declined within 2 h of H2O2 application. The expression of Zat12 was found to further decline to an undetectable level 4 h following the application of H2O2 (not shown). These findings are in accordance with previous reports on the transient expression of Zat12 during cold stress, wounding, and anoxic stress (16Cheong Y.H. Chang H.S. Gupta R. Wang X. Zhu T. Luan S. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 661-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 17Fowler S. Thomashow M.F. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1675-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar, 23Klok E.J.

Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 661-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Analysis of Zat12, Zat7, and WRKY25 in Transgenic Plants—To test the function of Zat12, Zat7, and WRKY25 in plants, we expressed full-length cDNA clones for these putative transcription factors in transgenic plants. For this purpose, we used the 35S-CaMV promoter. We then tested the tolerance of seedlings obtained from transgenic plants that constitutively express Zat12, Zat7, or WRKY25 to oxidative stress using a plate assay that measures root length and percentage of germination of seedlings in the presence or absence of the superoxide-generating agent paraquat (14Rizhsky L. Liang H. Mittler R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38921-38925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, seedlings of transgenic plants expressing Zat12 or Zat7 were more tolerant than seedlings of wild type plants to the oxidative stress applied in this assay. In contrast, seedlings of transgenic plants expressing WRKY25 were not more tolerant than seedlings of wild type plants to this treatment. These results were obtained with at least two independent transgenic lines for each of the different putative transcription factors. Using RNA blots, we tested the expression of Zat12, Zat7, WRKY25, and Apx1 in all transgenic lines grown under controlled growth conditions. As shown in Fig. 4A, constitutive expression of Zat12, Zat7, or WRKY25 in the different transgenic plants did not result in the elevated expression of Apx1 or any of the three putative transcription factors not controlled by the 35S-CaMV promoter. This result suggests that, under the controlled conditions we used to grow plants, the different putative transcription factors expressed in each of the different lines were unable to elevate the expression of each other or the expression of Apx1. A very high level of expression of Zat7, obtained in certain lines at the homozygous state, resulted in a delayed growth and development phenotype (Fig. 4B). However, this level of expression did not elevate the expression of Zat12 or WRKY25 and suppressed the expression level of Apx1 (Fig. 4B). A similar phenotype was not observed in transgenic plants expressing Zat12 or WRKY25 (not shown). Microarray Analysis of Transgenic Plants Constitutively Expressing Zat12—Because Zat12 expression enhanced the tolerance of plants to oxidative stress (Fig. 3) but did not result in the enhanced expression of Zat7, WRKY25, or Apx1 (Fig. 4A), we examined transgenic plants constitutively expressing Zat12 by microarrays to identify transcripts that may be involved in the response of plants to ROS (elevated in Zat12-expressing plants in the absence of an external stimuli). For these studies, we used leaf tissues of 2-week-old plants grown under controlled conditions and compared the pattern of transcript expression between transgenic plants expressing Zat12, wild type plants, and knock-out plants deficient in Apx1 (KO-Apx1). As shown in Table II, ten different transcripts that were elevated in transgenic plants expressing Zat12 were also elevated in KO-Apx1 plants (cutoff 0.8 log2-fold; transcripts elevated in Zat12-expressing plants as well as in KO-Apx1 plants are indicated in boldfaced type). It is possible that the expression of these transcripts in Apx1-deficient plants is controlled by Zat12. Our microarray experiments further confirmed that the expression of Zat7, WRKY25, or Apx1 is not elevated in transgenic plants expressing Zat12 (Table II; Fig. 4A). The steady-state level of a number of transcripts with a putative signaling function was elevated in transgenic plants expressing Zat12. These included a monomeric G-protein, MAPK kinase 4, a number of putative transcription factors (i.e. TINY, MYB, and zinc finger proteins), two different kinases, and a calcium-binding protein. Transcripts related to ROS metabolism enhanced in plants constitutively expressing Zat12 included superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase, peroxidase 2a, and glutathione S-transferase. Transcripts related to pathogen response and auxin, ethylene, and methyl jasmonate signaling were also elevated in Zat12-expressing plants (Table II).

When grown under controlled conditions, Zat12-deficient plants were similar in their growth and appearance to wild type plants (not shown). However, when the oxidative stress response of KO-Zat12 plants was compared with that of wild type plants (tested with H2O2 or paraquat), it was found that the steady-state level of transcripts encoding Zat7, WRKY25, and Apx1 was not elevated in KO-Zat12 plants during oxidative stress (Fig. 5A). The expression of Apx1 was, however, elevated in KO-Zat12 plants in response to a moderate level of light stress (Fig. 5A). To test whether the suppression of Zat7, WRKY25, and Apx1 during oxidative stress (Fig. 5A) resulted in greater damage to cells during oxidative stress, we used a protein blot approach to detect protein oxidation in plants. We first tested protein oxidation in wild type plants during H2O2 stress (10 mm, 1 h), and found that the major protein bend oxidized in Arabidopsis seedlings subjected to this treatment corresponds in its molecular weight to that of the large subunit of Rubisco. Immunoprecipitation assays of Rubisco in protein extracts obtained from treated and untreated plants confirmed that the oxidized protein is indeed Rubisco 2R. Mittler, L. Rizhsky, S. Davletova, and H. Liang, manuscript in preparation. (not shown; see Ref. 24Mehta R.A. Fawcett T.W. Porath D. Mattoo A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2810-2816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar for a detailed study of Rubisco protein oxidation during oxidative stress). As shown in Fig. 5B, the H2O2-induced oxidation of a Rubisco large subunit in KO-Zat12 plants was higher than that in wild type plants subjected to the same H2O2 stress. This finding suggests that the lack of Apx1 expression in knock-out Zat12 plants during oxidative stress results in greater oxidative damage to Rubisco protein, providing further evidence that cytosolic Apx1 is involved in protecting the chloroplast from oxidative stress (9Mittler R.

Plant J. 2003; 34: 187-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Enhanced expression of transcripts encoding different regulatory proteins, e.g. 2-component histidine kinase, different receptor-like protein kinases, WRKY transcription factors, calcium-binding proteins, calmodulin-like proteins, and MAPKs, was associated with oxidative stress in plants (11Vranova E.

Chem. 2003; 278: 38921-38925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, genetic evidence supporting a regulatory role for many of these proteins during oxidative stress was not presented. In Arabidopsis, two different MAP kinases (MAPK3 and MAPK6) were shown to be involved in H2O2 responses, and two different zinc finger proteins (Lsd1 and Lol1) were shown to have an antagonistic effect on cytosolic copper/zinc-superoxide dismutase expression during pathogen response (6Epple P. Mack A.A. Morris V.R. Dangl J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6831-6836Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 25Kovtun Y. Chiu W.L. Tena G. Sheen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2940-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). In addition, constitutive expression of a heat shock transcription factor (HSF3) in transgenic Arabidopsis plants was shown to enhance the expression of Apx1 and Apx2 in the absence of stress (15Panchuk I.I. Volkov R.A. Schoffl F. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 838-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Here, we report that the zinc finger protein Zat12 is required for cytosolic Apx1 expression during oxidative stress (Fig. 5). Furthermore, we show that Zat12 is also essential for the expression of Zat7 and WRKY25 and that these putative transcription factors are involved in the response of plants to oxidative stress (Figs. 3 and 5). The elevation in Zat12, Zat7, and WRKY25 expression in cells prior to the elevation in Apx1 expression during oxidative stress (Fig. 2) and the lack of Zat7, WRKY25, and Apx1 expression during oxidative stress in knock-out Zat12 plants (Fig. 5) provide strong evidence that Zat12, Zat7, and WRKY25 are integral components of the oxidative stress response signal transduction pathway of Arabidopsis. Based on our findings (Fig. 5), we propose that Zat12 acts upstream of Zat7, WRKY25, and Apx1 on the ROS signal transduction pathway of Arabidopsis (Fig. 6). Interestingly, constitutive expression of Zat12, Zat7, or WRKY25 did not enhance the expression of Apx1 in the absence of stress (Fig. 4A). This result suggests that an additional factor(s), unknown at present, may be required to enable the expression of Apx1 in these plants. This factor may only be present in cells during oxidative stress (Fig. 6). Because Zat12, Zat7, and WRKY25 are transiently induced in cells during stress (Refs.16Cheong Y.H. Chang H.S. Gupta R. Wang X. Zhu T. Luan S. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 661-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 17Fowler S. Thomashow M.F. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1675-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar, 18Iida A. Kazuoka T. Torikai S. Kikuchi H. Oeda K. Plant J. 2000; 24: 191-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Fig. 2), it is possible that their expression is coordinated with that of other factors transiently induced during stress and that the absence of these factors in transgenic plants grown under controlled conditions prevented the induction of Apx1 (see also Ref. 26Zhang J.Z. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2003; 6: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar for a discussion on expressing inducible transcription factors in plants). To test this possibility, we applied H2O2 stress to wild type plants and transgenic plants that constitutively express Zat12 (similar to the treatment shown in Fig. 2), and compared the expression of Apx1 between wild type plants and transgenic plants that constitutively express Zat12. However, the expression of Apx1 in transgenic plants constitutively expressing Zat12 in response to oxidative stress was only slightly higher than that of wild type plants (1.5-2-fold higher than wild type; not shown). Further studies are therefore required to identify the factors involved in Apx1 expression during stress and determine whether constitutive expression of Zat12, Zat7, and/or WRKY25 in transgenic plants would result in enhanced expression of Apx1 in cells in the absence of stress. Constitutive expression of Zat12 resulted in the elevated expression of different transcripts involved in ROS metabolism and hormonal signaling (Table II). The enhanced expression of transcripts encoding an NADPH oxidase gene in Zat12-expressing plants may suggest that Zat12 can facilitate the production of ROS in cells. Because NADPH oxidases were shown to regulate the response of plants to different biotic, abiotic, and developmental signals via enhanced production of ROS in cells (27Torres M.A. Dangl J.L. Jones J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar, 28Knight H. Knight M.R. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 262-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 29Pastori G.M. Foyer C.H. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), the finding that Zat12 enhances the expression of an NADPH oxidase may suggest that NADPH oxidases are also involved in regulating the response of plants to oxidative stress. The possibility that NADPH oxidases and ROS are used to regulate the response of plants to ROS stress should be tested in future studies, because it suggests that limited and localized production of ROS, and not a global enhancement in the steady-state level of ROS in cells, is required to trigger the defense response of plants against oxidative stress. The expression of the same NADPH oxidase gene elevated in Zat12-expressing plants (At1g23020; Table II), was also found to be elevated in plants subjected to cold or salt stress, stresses that enhance the expression of Zat12, as well as the expression of different ROS-scavenging enzymes (30Kreps J.A. Wu Y. Chang H.S. Zhu T. Wang X. Harper J.F. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 2129-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). These findings further support the hypothesis that Zat12 expression can enhance the expression of this NADPH gene during abiotic stress. Compared with seedlings of wild type plants or plants expressing WRKY25, seedlings of plants expressing Zat12 or Zat7 were tolerant to oxidative stress applied on agar plates by paraquat (Fig. 3). In a previous study, seedlings of tobacco plants expressing a constitutively activated form of the oxidative stress signal transduction protein ANP1, a MAPK similar to MAPK3/6 in Arabidopsis, were found to be more tolerant than wild type seedlings to different abiotic stresses such as freezing, heat shock, and salt stress (25Kovtun Y. Chiu W.L. Tena G. Sheen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2940-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that additional components of the oxidative stress signal transduction pathway of Arabidopsis could be used in a similar manner to enhance the tolerance of plants to oxidative stress. Because Zat12 expression in transgenic plants did not activate multiple defense mechanisms in plants in the absence of stress (Table II) and did not result in a deleterious side effect on plant growth and yield (not shown), Zat12 may be an ideal signal transduction protein to express in plants and enhance their tolerance to oxidative stress or, potentially, other abiotic stresses. Further studies examining the tolerance of Zat12- and Zat7-expressing plants to different abiotic stresses may reveal whether these proteins could be used for different biotechnological applications such as the enhancement of plant tolerance to biotic or abiotic stress. In contrast to many of the different transcription factors characterized in plants, the steady-state level of transcripts encoding Zat12 is elevated in Arabidopsis in response to a very large number of different biotic and abiotic stresses. These include stresses such as heat shock, salt, cold, wounding, pathogen, and high light (Refs. 12Desikan R. Mackerness A.H. Hancock J.T. Neill S.J. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 13Pnueli L. Liang H. Rozenberg M. Mittler R. Plant J. 2003; 34: 187-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, and 16Cheong Y.H. Chang H.S. Gupta R. Wang X. Zhu T. Luan S. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 661-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 17Fowler S. Thomashow M.F. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1675-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar, 18Iida A. Kazuoka T. Torikai S. Kikuchi H. Oeda K. Plant J. 2000; 24: 191-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, as well as a search of stress response Arabidopsis microarray results available at www.arabidopsis.org/servlets/Search). Common to these stresses, as well as to other stresses that do not enhance Zat12 expression, is the accumulation of ROS in cells during different stages of stress and stress recovery (31Zhu J.-K. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2002; 53: 247-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (4447) Google Scholar). Although it is not known which signals are involved in enhancing Zat12 expression in cells, it is tempting to speculate that a combination of different signals such as ROS and/or different stress response hormones control the expression of Zat12 in cells during stress. Analysis of the Zat12, Zat7, and WRKY25 promoters (Table I) supports a link between different stress hormones and Zat12 expression. However, with the exception of the heat shock factor-binding site that may regulate Zat12 expression during heat shock or oxidative stress, no known DNA binding site for ROS responses was identified in the promoter of Zat12. We are currently using Zat12 promoter-luciferase fusions to study the Zat12 promoter and isolate different mutants deficient in Zat12 expression during stress. We thank Drs. Eve Syrkin-Wurtele, Carol Foster, and Hailong Zhang for their help with Affymetrix data analysis."

Here we have investigated the role of the calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway in the regulation of osteoclast differentiation. Osteoclasts are bone-resorbing multinucleated cells that are derived from the monocyte/macrophage cell lineage after stimulation with a member of the tumor necrosis factor family of ligands known as receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL). We now report that inhibition of calcineurin with either the immunosuppressant drugs cyclosporin A and FK506, or the retrovirally mediated ectopic expression of a specific calcineurin inhibitory peptide, all potently inhibit the RANKL-induced differentiation of the RAW264.7 monocyte/macrophage cell line into mature multinucleated osteoclasts. In addition, we find that NFAT family members are expressed in RAW264.7 cells and that their expression is up-regulated in response to RANKL stimulation. Most importantly, we find that ectopic expression of a constitutively active, calcineurin-independent NFATc1 mutant in RAW264.7 cells is sufficient to induce these cells to express an osteoclast-specific pattern of gene expression and differentiate into morphologically distinct, multinucleated osteoclasts capable of inducing the resorption of a physiological mineralized matrix substrate. Taken together, these data define calcineurin as an essential downstream effector of the RANKL-induced signal transduction pathway leading toward the induction of osteoclast differentiation and furthermore, indicate that the activation of the NFATc1 transcription factor is sufficient to initiate a genetic program that results in the specification of the mature functional osteoclast cell phenotype.

Bone is a dynamic tissue that is under a constant state of remodeling or homeostasis. This remodeling process is a delicate balance between the activities of osteoblasts, the cells that deposit bone, and osteoclasts, the cell type that is responsible for bone resorption (1Teitelbaum S.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1504-1508Google Scholar, 2Ducy P. Schinke T. Karsenty G. Science. 2000; 289: 1501-1504Google Scholar). Interference with this delicate balance can result in very serious human pathologies that affect bone integrity, such as osteoporosis and osteopetrosis. Accordingly, the molecular signaling pathways that regulate osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and function have come under intense scrutiny.Osteoclasts, the cells that resorb bone, are hematopoietically derived, multinucleated cells that arise from the monocyte/macrophage lineage (3Ash P. Loutit J.F. Townsend K.M. Nature. 1980; 283: 669-670Google Scholar). It is now clear that osteoclast differentiation is dependent upon the intimate cellular interaction of myeloid preosteoclast precursors with either osteoblasts or stromal cells and is influenced by a wide range of local factors (4Takahashi N.

In fact, a wealth of data has indicated that a member of the tumor necrosis factor family of ligands known as receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) 1The abbreviations used are: NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; AP-1, activator protein-1; ca, constitutively active; CsA, cyclosporin A; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MSCV, murine stem cell virus; NFAT, nuclear activated factor of T cells; RANK, receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB; RANKL, RANK ligand; sRANKL, soluble RANKL; TRAF, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. 1The abbreviations used are: NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; AP-1, activator protein-1; ca, constitutively active; CsA, cyclosporin A; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MSCV, murine stem cell virus; NFAT, nuclear activated factor of T cells; RANK, receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB; RANKL, RANK ligand; sRANKL, soluble RANKL; TRAF, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. ligand (RANKL; also known as ODF, OPGL, and TRANCE), which is expressed on both stromal cells and osteoblasts, plays an essential role in the regulation of osteoclast differentiation (6Lacey D.L.

Thus, a soluble recombinant form of RANKL (sRANKL) is sufficient to replace fully the requirement for osteoblast and stromal cell interactions in the induction of osteoclast differentiation in in vitro cultures (6Lacey D.L.

In fact, genetic studies in knock-out mice have revealed that the p50 and p52 subunits of NF-κB, as well as c-Fos, a component of the AP-1 transcription factor complex, are essential for efficient osteoclast maturation in vivo (24Iotsova V.

Furthermore, in vitro studies with specific chemical inhibitors have suggested important roles for the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in the regulation of RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation (20Matsumoto M. Sudo T. Saito T. Osada H. Tsujimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31155-31161Google Scholar, 22Lee S.E. Woo K.M. Kim S.Y. Kim H.M. Kwack K. Lee Z.H. Kim H.H.

However, although RANKL/RANK signaling is clearly indispensable for osteoclast differentiation, our complete understanding of the contingent series of signaling events involved in RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis is far from complete.Previous studies have indicated that the immunosuppressant drugs cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506 have pronounced effects on bone. Thus, the addition of either CsA or FK506 to in vitro bone organ or marrow cultures has been shown to inhibit both osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption induced by a variety of different agents including parathyroid hormone, calcitriol, prostaglandins, and cytokines (28Skjodt H. Crawford A. Elford P.R. Ihrie E. Wood D.D. Russell R.G.G. Br. J. Rheumatol. 1985; 24: 165-169Google Scholar, 29Stewart P.J. Green O.C. Stern P.H. J. Bone Miner.

Commun. 1999; 254: 248-252Google Scholar). Furthermore, CsA has also been shown to inhibit bone resorption in isolated osteoclast cultures (33Chowdhury M.H. Shen V. Dempster D.W. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1991; 49: 275-279Google Scholar). Although these results suggest that CsA and FK506 are likely to inhibit an important step in the regulation of osteoclast differentiation and activation, this interpretation is complicated by the fact that these cultures contain both osteoclast precursors and RANKL-expressing osteoblasts and stromal cells. Hence, it is unclear from these latter studies whether the relevant cellular target for the inhibitory effects of these drugs is the osteoclast per se or alternatively, the osteoblast or stromal cell. This is an important issue to resolve because the inhibitory effects of CsA and FK506 on the generation of mature functional osteoclasts may help define a novel step in the regulation of osteoclastogenesis.It is now well established that both CsA and FK506 are specific inhibitors of the calcium/calmodulin-regulated serine/threonine phosphatase, calcineurin (34Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Google Scholar). Calcineurin is best known for the role that it plays during T cell activation, where it acts to regulate the activity of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family of transcription factors and thereby couples stimulation of the T cell antigen-receptor to changes in the expression of cytokines and other important immunoregulatory genes (35Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Google Scholar, 36Crabtree G.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 109 (suppl.): S67-S79Google Scholar). In T cells, calcineurin is activated in response to the T cell receptor-induced increase in the intracellular calcium concentration. Once activated, calcineurin directly dephosphorylates NFAT proteins that are present in a hyperphosphorylated latent form in the cytoplasm and induces their rapid translocation into the nucleus, where in concert with nuclear partner proteins such as the AP-1 transcription factor complex, they are able to bind cooperatively to their target promoter elements and activate the transcription of specific NFAT target genes (35Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Google Scholar, 36Crabtree G.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 109 (suppl.): S67-S79Google Scholar). By potently inhibiting the in vivo activity of calcineurin, both CsA and FK506 are able to block the calcineurin-dependent nuclear translocation of NFAT proteins and thereby prevent the NFAT-dependent expression of a large number cytokines and other genes known to play an essential role in the initiation and regulation of the immune response. Although the calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway is certainly best known for its role in the regulation of the immune response, it has become increasingly apparent that this pathway is also active in a wide range of cell types and tissues outside of the immune system (36Crabtree G.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 109 (suppl.): S67-S79Google Scholar, 37Horsley V. Pavlath G.K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 771-774Google Scholar) and therefore plays a much broader role in the regulation of cell growth and development than previously appreciated.In the current study we have investigated the potential role of the calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway in the regulation of osteoclast differentiation. For a model system, we have used the RAW264.7 cell line because RANKL-induced stimulation of these monocyte/macrophage-like cells is known to be sufficient to induce osteoclast differentiation in the complete absence of either stromal cells, osteoblasts, or other exogenously supplied differentiation-inducing factors (8Hsu H. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Solovyev I. Colombero A. Timms E. Tan H.L. Elliott G. Kelley M.J. Sarosi I. Wang L. Xia X.Z. Elliott R. Chiu L. Black T. Scully S. Capparelli C. Morony S. Shimamoto G. Bass M.B. Boyle W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3540-3545Google Scholar). We now report that the RANKL-induced differentiation of RAW264.7 cells is potently inhibited by both CsA and FK506. Furthermore, we find that ectopic expression of VIVIT-GFP, a previously characterized specific peptide inhibitor of calcineurin which is believed selectively to prevent calcineurin from activating NFAT proteins, but not other calcineurin-dependent signaling pathways (38Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Google Scholar), also potently inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation. In fact, we show that members of the NFAT family of transcription factors are expressed in RAW264.7 cells and that their expression is up-regulated in response to stimulation with RANKL. Most importantly, we demonstrate that ectopic expression of a constitutively active NFATc1 mutant is sufficient to induce RAW264.7 cells to express an osteoclast-specific pattern of gene expression and undergo terminal differentiation into mature functional multinucleated osteoclast-like cells. Taken together, these data identify a novel role for the calcineurin/NFATc1 signaling pathway in the regulation of osteoclast differentiation and demonstrate that the NFATc1 transcription factor is sufficient to induce the transcriptional program leading to the acquisition of the mature osteoclast cell phenotype.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—RAW264.7 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in growth media: α-minimum Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen). For osteoclastogenesis assays, cells were resuspended in fresh medium and cultured for 5–8 days in 96-well plates at cell a density of either 500 or 3000 cells/well. Soluble RANKL (Peprotech) was added at 3–100 ng/ml as indicated, CsA (Calbiochem) was used at 2 μg/ml, and FK506 (Calbiochem) at 1 ng/ml.Determination of Osteoclast Differentiation—Osteoclast differentiation was assessed by measuring the cellular enzymatic activity of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), a marker enzyme of osteoclasts, and by the direct enumeration of TRAP-positive, morphologically distinct, multinucleated osteoclasts (39Igarashi K. Woo J.T. Stern P.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 523-532Google Scholar, 40Woo J.T. Kasai S. Stern P.H. Nagai K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 650-662Google Scholar). For the measurement of TRAP activity, cells were fixed in 10% (v/v) formalin for 10 min, washed in 95% (v/v) ethanol, and then incubated in 0.1 ml of phosphatase substrate (3.7 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 50 mm citrate buffer, pH 4.6) in the presence of 10 mm sodium tartrate at 25 °C for 30 min. After the incubation, the solution was from each well was transferred to a tube containing 0.1 ml of 0.1 n NaOH, and the absorbance at 410 nm was determined with a Dynatech MR5000 microplate reader. After the assay for TRAP activity, the cells were stained for TRAP with 0.1 mg/ml naphthol AS-MX phosphate and 0.6 mg/ml fast red violet LB salt in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 50 mm sodium tartrate. All of the TRAP-positive cells with three or more nuclei were counted. Cultures were photographed with a Nikon Coolpix 4500 digital camera, and images were transferred with NikonView 5 software.Recombinant Retroviruses and Infection of RAW264.7 Cells—The retroviral expression vectors pMSCV-GFP, MSCV-VIVIT-GFP and pM-SCV-caNFATc1 have been described previously (41Porter C.M. Clipstone N.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4936-4945Google Scholar, 42Neal J.W. Clipstone N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49776-49781Google Scholar). Recombinant retroviruses were produced by cotransfecting the pMSCV-GFP, pM-SCV-VIVIT-GFP, or pMSCV-caNFATc1 proviral vector together with pVSV-G (Clontech), encoding the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein, into the GP293 pantrophic packaging cell line (Clontech) using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). The medium was replaced after 24 h, and viral supernatants were harvested 2 days post-transfection and stored at -80 °C. For infections, 3,000 RAW264.7 cells were plated per well of a 96-well plate. The next day, the medium was replaced with 100 μl of viral supernatant containing 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma), and plates were centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 2 h at room temperature. After removal of viral supernatant, cells were cultured in growth medium for subsequent analysis.Determination of Functional Osteoclast Activity by Calcium Phosphate Resorption Assay and Pit Formation on Dentin Slices—Cells were seeded onto 16-well BD BioCoat® Osteologic® calcium phosphate-coated quartz slides and incubated in α-minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin and streptomycin, 50 μg/ml l-ascorbic acid, and 10 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate. The cells were infected with the appropriate recombinant retrovirus as described above, and the medium was changed after 24 h and three times weekly thereafter. After 10 days, bleach solution (6% NaOCl, 5.2% NaCl) was added to each well. The dish was agitated for 5 min and the medium/bleach mixture removed. Wells were washed twice in deionized water and then in running deionized water and allowed to air dry. Cultures were photographed as described above, and the transferred images quantified to determine the area of resorbed matrix using Scion Image® software. For direct examination of bone resorbing activity, cells were seeded in 24-well plates directly onto 0.5-mm thick dentin slices (a kind gift from Professor Hisashi Shinoda, Tohoku University Dental School, Sendai, Japan) and infected with either the MSCV-GFP or MSCV-caNFATc1 retrovirus exactly as described above. After 10 days in culture, cells were removed by vigorous washing with bleach solution, dentin slices were washed in deionized water, and resorption pits were visualized by staining with hematoxylin and light microscopy. For visualization of resorption pits by scanning electron microscopy, dentin slices were first dehydrated in a series of ascending ethanol washes, then critically point dried under CO2. Dentin slices were then mounted on stubs, sputter coated with a 10-nm layer of gold, and examined by scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi S3500) using a Robinson backscattered electron detector.Semiquantitative Analysis of mRNA Expression by Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells using the RNeasy mini-prep method (Qiagen), and first strand cDNA was synthesized in 20-μl reactions using the Promega reverse transcription system following the manufacturer's protocol. For analysis of the expression of NFAT family members, serial 2-fold dilutions of the first strand cDNA synthesis reaction were used for PCR amplification using Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) and the following gene-specific primer pairs: NFATc1 sense, 5′-CAACGCCCTGACCACCGATAG-3′, and antisense, 5′-GG CTGCCTTCCGTCTCATAGT-3′; NFATc2 sense, 5′-GGGCCATGTGAGCAGGAGGAGA-3′, and antisense, 5′-GCGTTTCGGAGCTTCAGGATGC-3′; NFATc3 sense, 5′-CTTTCAGTTCCTTCACCCTT TACCT-3′, and antisense, 5′-TGCCAATATCAGTTTCTCCTTTTC-3′; cyclophilin sense, 5′-TGGCACAGGAGGAAAGAGCATC-3′, and antisense, 5′-AAAGGGCTTCTCCACCTCGATC-3′. Thermal cycling conditions were: 32 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s (NFATc1 and NFATc3); 32 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 61 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s (NFATc2); and 32 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min (cyclophilin). For analysis of osteoclast-specific gene expression PCR amplification was performed using the following sets of gene-specific primers: TRAP sense, 5′-CACGATGCCAGCGACAAGAG-3′, and antisense, 5′-TGACCCCGTATGTGGCTAAC-3′; αV integrin sense, 5′-GCCAGCCCATTGAGTTTGATT-3′, and antisense, 5′-GCT ACCAGGACCACCGAGAAG-3′; β3 integrin sense, 5′-TTACCCCGTGGACATCTACTA-3′, and antisense, 5′-AGTCTTCCATCCAGGGCAATA-3′; cathepsin K sense, 5′-GGAGAAGACTCACCAGAAGC-3′, and antisense, 5′-GTCATATAGCCGCCTCCACAG-3′; calcitonin receptor sense, 5′-ACCGACGAGCAACGCCTACGC-3′, and antisense, 5′-GCCTCACAGCCTTCAGGTAC-3′. Thermal cycling conditions were: 22–27 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min (TRAP, αV, and cathepsin K); 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min (β3); and 33 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 52 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min (calcitonin receptor). PCR products were resolved by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by Vistra Green staining on a Storm PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software.Statistics—Significance was determined by Scheffe's F test.RESULTSCsA and FK506 Inhibit the RANKL-induced Osteoclast Differentiation of RAW264.7 cells—To determine initially the potential role of the calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway in osteoclastogenesis, we first evaluated the effects of the specific calcineurin inhibitors CsA and FK506 on the ability of RANKL to induce the differentiation of RAW264.7 cells. Thus, cultures of RAW264.7 cells were stimulated with a range of sRANKL concentrations (3–100 ng/ml) in the presence and absence of either CsA or FK506, and osteoclast differentiation was assessed after 8 days by the production of TRAP enzymatic activity, a marker enzyme of osteoclast differentiation, and by the direct enumeration of multinucleated TRAP-positive cells. As indicated in Fig. 1, sRANKL stimulation induced a dose-dependent increase in both TRAP activity and the number of multinucleated TRAP-positive cells. Notably, both of these RANKL-induced parameters of osteoclast differentiation were significantly inhibited in the presence of either CsA or FK506 (Fig. 1). However, although the inhibitory effects of CsA and FK506 on sRANKL-induced TRAP activity were quite modest, both of these immunosuppressant drugs potently inhibited the appearance of morphologically distinct, TRAP-positive, multinucleated osteoclasts. Hence, these results indicate that although both CsA and FK506 inhibit the RANKL-induced differentiation of RAW264.7 cells, it is the later steps in the osteoclast differentiation pathway leading to fusion and multinucleation which appear to be more sensitive to the drugs, rather than the early production of TRAP activity.Ectopic Expression of the Specific Calcineurin Inhibitory Peptide VIVIT-GFP Blocks RANKL-stimulated Osteoclastogenesis—The above results demonstrating that CsA and FK506 both inhibit the RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation of RAW264.7 cells suggest that calcineurin activity is required for RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. To investigate this further, we took advantage of a 16-amino acid high affinity calcineurin-binding peptide identified by Rao and colleagues (known as VIVIT), which, when fused to the N terminus of GFP, has been shown to inhibit selectively the ability of calcineurin to activate NFAT proteins (38Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Google Scholar). To introduce this VIVIT-GFP fusion protein into RAW264.7 cells efficiently, we utilized our previously described retroviral vector in which VIVIT-GFP is under the transcriptional control of the MSCV long terminal repeat (42Neal J.W. Clipstone N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49776-49781Google Scholar). By pseudotyping this recombinant retrovirus with the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G we were able to generate high titer virus capable of routinely infecting >95% of RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 2A). This high level of infection efficiency obviates the laborious process of isolating and expanding clonal cell lines and means that we are able to analyze bulk populations of cells immediately after infection. To determine the effects of VIVIT-GFP on RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation, RAW264.7 c"
https://openalex.org/W2073356061,"The retinoic acid-related orphan receptor α (RORα) is an orphan member of the subfamily 1 of nuclear hormone receptors. Our recent structural and functional studies have led to the hypothesis that cholesterol or a cholesterol derivative is the natural ligand of RORα. We have now solved the x-ray crystal structure of the ligand binding domain of RORα in complex with cholesterol-3-O-sulfate following a ligand exchange experiment. In contrast to the 3-hydroxyl of cholesterol, the 3-O-sulfate group makes additional direct hydrogen bonds with three residues of the RORα ligand binding domain, namely NH-Gln289, NH-Tyr290, and NH1-Arg370. When compared with the complex with cholesterol, seven well ordered water molecules have been displaced, and the ligand is slightly shifted toward the hydrophilic part of the ligand binding pocket, which is ideally suited for interactions with a sulfate group. These additional ligand-protein interactions result in an increased affinity of cholesterol sulfate when compared with cholesterol, as shown by mass spectrometry analysis done under native conditions and differential scanning calorimetry. Moreover, mutational studies show that the higher binding affinity of cholesterol sulfate translates into an increased transcriptional activity of RORα. Our findings suggest that cholesterol sulfate could play a crucial role in the regulation of RORα in vivo.

The group of retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors (ROR) 1The abbreviations used are: ROR, retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptor; LBD, ligand binding domain; LBP, ligand binding pocket; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry. 1The abbreviations used are: ROR, retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptor; LBD, ligand binding domain; LBP, ligand binding pocket; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry. is encoded by three different genes (α, β, and γ) (1Jetten A.M. Kurebayashi S. Ueda E. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 69: 205-247Google Scholar). RORα has been implicated in numerous age-related phenotypes such as atherosclerosis, cerebellar atrophy, immunodeficiency, and bone metabolism (2Jarvis C.I. Staels B. Brugg B. Lemaigre-Dubreuil Y. Tedgui A. Mariani J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 186: 1-5Google Scholar). RORα was still considered an orphan receptor until we recently reported the first crystal structure of the RORα LBD. It had revealed a ligand that was unexpectedly present, namely cholesterol (3Kallen J. Schlaeppi J-M. Bitsch F. Geisse S. Geiser M. Delhon I. Fournier B. Structure. 2002; 10: 1697-1707Google Scholar). We also had shown that the transcriptional activity of RORα could be modulated by changes in intracellular cholesterol level or mutation of residues involved in cholesterol binding. This has led to the hypothesis that RORα could play a key role in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis and thus represents an important drug target in cholesterol-related diseases. Despite the relatively high homology between RORα LBD and RORβ LBD (63%), cholesterol seems not to be a ligand for the RORβ isoform, as reported recently by Stehlin-Gaon et al. (4Stehlin-Gaon C. Willmann D. Zeyer D. Sanglier S. Van Dorsselaer A. Renaud J-P. Moras D. Schüle R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 820-825Google Scholar). This indicates a possible distinct function for RORβ and RORα. An inspection of the x-ray structure of the complex between RORα LBD and cholesterol had shown that in the hydrophilic part of the LBP, there is space for a substituent attached to the hydroxy group of cholesterol, if water molecules are displaced (3Kallen J. Schlaeppi J-M. Bitsch F. Geisse S. Geiser M. Delhon I. Fournier B. Structure. 2002; 10: 1697-1707Google Scholar). The presence of three arginines (Arg292, Arg370, and Arg367) and of two free backbone amide nitrogens (NH-Gln289 and NH-Tyr290) strongly suggested a negatively charged substituent with at least two hydrogen-bond acceptor functionalities. Docking studies led to the prediction that cholesterol sulfate should have higher affinity than cholesterol, and might be, because of its excellent fit and optimized interactions, the actual natural ligand of RORα (instead of cholesterol itself). Here, we present the x-ray crystal structure of the RORα LBD-cholesterol sulfate complex. We show a comparison with the x-ray structure of the RORα LBD-cholesterol complex, which suggests that cholesterol sulfate has a higher affinity than cholesterol. Indeed, as shown by mass spectrometry analysis, the exchange of cholesterol with cholesterol sulfate is practically irreversible under the conditions used. In addition, DSC analysis revealed that cholesterol sulfate increased the phase transition temperature for RORα LBD by 9 °C, relative to cholesterol. We also show that cholesterol sulfate shows increased (versus cholesterol) transcriptional activation, which is reduced by a point mutation that affects the binding of cholesterol sulfate more than that of cholesterol. We speculate that cholesterol sulfate plays a role in the regulation of RORα in vivo. RORα LBD Protein Preparation for Crystallization and ESI-MS Exchange Experiment—The RORα LBD protein (residues 271–523, flanked by an N-terminal hexa-His tag and a PreScission™ cleavage site) was expressed in the baculovirus system (Sf-9 cells) and purified as described previously (3Kallen J. Schlaeppi J-M. Bitsch F. Geisse S. Geiser M. Delhon I. Fournier B. Structure. 2002; 10: 1697-1707Google Scholar). The exchange of cholesterol by cholesterol sulfate was done at 37 °C and confirmed by ESI-MS-analysis as reported previously (5Bitsch F. Aichholz R. Kallen J. Geisse S. Fournier B. Schlaeppi J-M. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 323: 139-149Google Scholar). Briefly, cholesterol sulfate was dissolved at 50 mm in Me2SO and added at 1.0 mm final concentration to the (His)6RORα LBD271–523 solution at 73 μm. The resulting solution was incubated overnight at 37 °C and further purified by size exclusion chromatography on an SPX75 column before concentration to 17.6 mg/ml for crystallization trials. MS determination of the native complex was done as described previously (5Bitsch F. Aichholz R. Kallen J. Geisse S. Fournier B. Schlaeppi J-M. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 323: 139-149Google Scholar). A control experiment was done by incubating the same amount of RORα LBD protein with 5% Me2SO under identical conditions. The protein concentration was ∼15 μm in 50 mm AcONH4, pH 7.0. Both spectra were recorded under identical conditions with Vc = 20 volts. Differential Scanning Calorimetry—The RORα LBD complexes with cholesterol and cholesterol sulfate, respectively, were obtained as described above. After the exchange experiment, the excess of cholesterol sulfate was removed on 5-ml HiTrap desalting columns. Protein concentration was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography-UV detection (214 nm). The final protein concentration following ligand exchange was 20 μm. DSC scans were obtained using a MicroCal VP-capDSC system (MicroCal, LLC, Northampton, MA) at a scan rate of 250 °C/h. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination— Crystals were obtained at 4 °C by the vapor diffusion method in 2-μl hanging drops containing equal volumes of protein (17.6 mg/ml) and crystallization buffer (0.2 m MgCl2, 16% w/v polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m Tris HCl, pH 8.5). The crystal form obtained was similar to the one for the complex with cholesterol (3Kallen J. Schlaeppi J-M. Bitsch F. Geisse S. Geiser M. Delhon I. Fournier B. Structure. 2002; 10: 1697-1707Google Scholar). Diffraction data at 100 K were collected at the Swiss Light Source (beamline X06SA) using a Marre-search CCD detector and an incident monochromatic x-ray beam with 0.9200-Å wavelength. In total, 226 images were collected with 1.0° rotation each, using an exposure time of 9 s/frame and a crystal-to-detector distance of 150 mm. Raw diffraction data were processed and scaled with the HKL program suite version 1.96.1 (6Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326PubMed Google Scholar). The estimated B-factor by Wilson plot analysis is 32.9 Å2. The structure was determined using as starting model the coordinates of the complex RORα LBD-cholesterol refined to 1.63-Å resolution (3Kallen J. Schlaeppi J-M. Bitsch F. Geisse S. Geiser M. Delhon I. Fournier B. Structure. 2002; 10: 1697-1707Google Scholar). The program REFMAC version 5.0 (7Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Bulk solvent correction, an initial anisotropic B factor correction, and restrained isotropic atomic B-factor refinement were applied. The refinement target was the maximum likelihood target using amplitudes. No σ cut-off was applied on the structure factor amplitudes. Cross-validation was used throughout refinement using a test set comprising 5.0% (829) of the unique reflections. Water molecules were identified with the program ARP/wARP (7Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar, 9Lamzin V.S.

Water molecules with temperature factors greater than 70 Å2 were rejected. The program O version 7.0 (10Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Cholesterol and cholesterol sulfate were purchased from Steraloids (Newport, RI). The pCMX-RORα plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. M. Becker-Andre (Serono, Geneva, Switzerland). The reporter ROREtkluc was a kind gift from Dr. V. Giguere (McGill Univ, Montreal, Canada) and has been described previously (12Giguere V. Tini M. Flock G. Ong E. Evans R.M. Otulakowski G. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 538-553Google Scholar). The RORα mutants C228Q, A330Q,A371Q,C323L, and K339A,E509A were generated using a QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Cell Culture and Transfection Assays—Cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/cm2, 24 h before transfection, and transfected using Fugene6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). A typical reaction mixture contained 0.5 μg pCMX-RORα expression vector, 1.0 μg of reporter plasmid ROREtkluc, 0.1 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase, and 3 μl of Fugene 6. After a 4-h exposure to the transfection mix, the medium was refreshed and left for another 24 h. Transfected cells were subsequently harvested for the luciferase assay by scraping the cells into 250 μl of passive lysis buffer after washing them in phosphate-buffered saline. Luciferase activity was monitored according to the Promega luciferase assay kit using an automatic luminometer LB96P (Berthold, Regensburg, Germany). Results are expressed in relative light units per β-galactosidase unit. Structure Determination of the Complex RORα LBD-Cholesterol Sulfate—We have expressed human RORα LBD (residues 271–523, numbering according to splice variant 1 of SWISS-PROT entry P35398, and a PreScission™ cleavable N-terminal His tag) in the baculovirus system. After a two-step purification and without cleaving off the N-terminal tag, we exchanged to more than 95% bound cholesterol with cholesterol sulfate (as determined by ESI-MS analysis) and crystallized the complex. Crystals belonging to the monoclinic space group P21 (unit cell: a = 54.4 Å, b = 49.9 Å, c = 60.7 Å, β = 97.8°, 1 complex/asymmetric unit) reached maximal dimensions of up to 0.2 mm in hanging drops at 4 °C within 6 weeks. The structure was solved using the coordinates of the complex of RORα LBD with cholesterol (3Kallen J. Schlaeppi J-M. Bitsch F. Geisse S. Geiser M. Delhon I. Fournier B. Structure. 2002; 10: 1697-1707Google Scholar). Overall Structure of the Complex RORα LBD-Cholesterol Sulfate—The results of the crystallographic refinement are summarized in Table I. The nomenclature of the secondary structure elements is based on the RXR LBD crystal structure (13Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Google Scholar) and is identical to the one used for RORα LBD (3Kallen J. Schlaeppi J-M. Bitsch F. Geisse S. Geiser M. Delhon I. Fournier B. Structure. 2002; 10: 1697-1707Google Scholar). In general, the electron density is of excellent quality, except for amino acids 461–466 (loop L9–10), which had only weak density. The protein part of the refined model consists of the last two His amino acids from the His tag followed by the PreScission™ site (LEVLFQG) and by amino acids 271–511 of the RORα LBD. The refined model also contains 256 water molecules and one cholesterol sulfate molecule. RORα LBD bound to cholesterol sulfate is in an agonist-bound state, as judged by the position of H12 (14Renaud J.P. Moras D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1748-1769Google Scholar). H12 in this position, together with the H3-H4 region, forms the interaction surface (AF-2) for the coactivator (14Renaud J.P. Moras D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1748-1769Google Scholar). As found previously for the complex with cholesterol (3Kallen J. Schlaeppi J-M. Bitsch F. Geisse S. Geiser M. Delhon I. Fournier B. Structure. 2002; 10: 1697-1707Google Scholar), the PreScission™ cleavage site (LEVLFQGP) acts as a mimic of the LXXLL coactivator sequence and adopts an α-helical conformation. It interacts with the coactivator binding site of a neighboring molecule in the crystal lattice and forms the classical “charge clamp” capping interactions mediated by Lys339(H3) and Glu509(H12). The overall structures of RORα LBD in complex with cholesterol and cholesterol sulfate are very similar. The root mean square deviation using the LSQ option from the program O (10Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar) was 0.26 Å for the 242 Cα atoms from residues Pro270-Phe511. Significant changes in the protein parts of the LBP (Fig. 1A) occur only for the side chain of Ile327 and the loop L1–2 (residues Gln289 and Tyr290). The backbone NH-atoms for Gln289 and Tyr290 move by ca. 0.8 Å toward the sulfate group (with a concomitant movement of the respective side chains), thus improving the interactions with the sulfate group. The side chain of Ile327 has moved slightly, to prevent a steric clash with the terminal isopropyl group of cholesterol sulfate. Cholesterol Sulfate in the LBP of RORα—Cholesterol sulfate is bound in the LBP of RORα. The sulfate group, which is located in the hydrophilic part of the LBP, makes direct hydrogen bond interactions with NH-Gln289 (3.0 Å), NH-Tyr290 (2.9 Å), and a bidentate interaction with NH1-Arg370 (3.0 Å, 3.1 Å). This confirms the docking hypothesis, which had led to the proposal of cholesterol sulfate as a ligand with an improved affinity relative to cholesterol (3Kallen J. Schlaeppi J-M. Bitsch F. Geisse S. Geiser M. Delhon I. Fournier B. Structure. 2002; 10: 1697-1707Google Scholar). In addition, a water-mediated interaction is made with NH1-Arg367 (Fig. 1A). The comparison shows that cholesterol sulfate and cholesterol have a similar overall mode of binding, but cholesterol sulfate is displaced slightly toward the hydrophilic and positively charged part of the LBP (Fig. 1A). This can be explained by the optimization of electrostatic and hydrogen-bond interactions made by the sulfate group. Interestingly, seven well ordered water molecules present for cholesterol in the hydrophilic part of the LBP have been displaced in the complex with cholesterol sulfate (Fig. 1B). Only one conserved water molecule is still present, which mediates interactions from the sulfate group to NH1-Arg367 and O-Ala330. The average B-value for the ligand (28.7 Å2) is lower than the average B-value for the protein (40.0 Å2), consistent with the fact that excellent electron density for all non-hydrogen atoms of cholesterol sulfate is visible. Cholesterol sulfate adopts thus (like cholesterol) a single, well defined position in the LBP. The following amino acids have a non-hydrogen atom closer than 4 Å to the ligand cholesterol sulfate: Cys288(loop H1-H2), Gln289(loop H1-H2), Tyr290(loop H1-H2), Trp320(H3), Cys323-(H3), Ala324(H3), Lys326(H3), Ile327(H3), Ala330(H3), Val364-(H5), Arg367(H5), Met368(H5), Arg370(H5), Ala371(H5), Val379-(s1), Tyr380(s1), Phe381(s1), Phe391(H6), Leu394(H6), Val403(H7), and His484(H11). Cholesterol Sulfate Is Bound More Tightly than Cholesterol—We used non-denaturing ESI-MS to confirm the exchange of cholesterol by cholesterol sulfate in the RORα LBD. Exchange yield using cholesterol sulfate was greater than 95%. As shown previously (5Bitsch F. Aichholz R. Kallen J. Geisse S. Fournier B. Schlaeppi J-M. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 323: 139-149Google Scholar), the corresponding protein-ligand complex also showed a higher stability to collision-induced dissociation in the electrospray ionization interface. Moreover, the exchange of bound cholesterol sulfate could not be reversed by adding back an excess of cholesterol or other cholesterol derivatives such as hydroxycholesterols (data not shown). In addition, differential scanning calorimetry was used to assess the stabilities of the RORα LDB complexes with cholesterol and cholesterol sulfate, respectively. Fig. 2 shows that cholesterol sulfate dramatically increased the phase transition temperature of RORα LBD by 9 °C, relative to cholesterol. Overall, these results confirm that, as predicted by the x-ray structures, cholesterol sulfate has a higher affinity than cholesterol for RORα LBD. Sulfonation of Cholesterol Improves RORα Transcriptional Activity—To further characterize the possible biological role of cholesterol sulfate for RORα, a series of mutations was designed and evaluated for their effects on the transcriptional activities. The double mutation K339A,E509A (i.e. a “knockout” of the charge clamp) was made as a negative control. Indeed, this double mutant triggered a transcriptional activity similar to the one obtained with an empty vector (Fig. 3A). The triple mutant A330Q,A371Q,C323L (designed to prevent binding of cholesterol and cholesterol sulfate in the LBP) showed a reduced activity (Fig. 3A) consistent with the results obtained previously for the single mutants A330L, A371Q, and C323L (3Kallen J. Schlaeppi J-M. Bitsch F. Geisse S. Geiser M. Delhon I. Fournier B. Structure. 2002; 10: 1697-1707Google Scholar). A mutation that might prevent binding of cholesterol sulfate more than that of cholesterol was designed based on the crystal structure. We hypothesized that the mutation C288Q would modify the position of Arg370 and/or of loop L1–2 (Fig. 1B) and thus would preferentially lower the affinity of cholesterol sulfate versus cholesterol. We first tested this mutation in cells for which the intracellular cholesterol level was not manipulated. Most likely, as shown in normal epithelial cells, the ratio between cholesterol and cholesterol sulfate in these cells is about 500:1 (15Lin Y.N. Horowitz M.I. Steroids. 1980; 36: 697-708Google Scholar). Under these experimental conditions, the transcriptional activity of the mutant RORα C288Q was found to be similar to the one elicited by RORα wild type (Fig. 3A). This unaffected transcriptional activity of the C288Q mutant probably reflects the binding of cholesterol to the mutated RORα. The intracellular cholesterol level in U2OS cells can be reduced by using lovastatin (hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor) and cyclodextrin, as described previously (3Kallen J. Schlaeppi J-M. Bitsch F. Geisse S. Geiser M. Delhon I. Fournier B. Structure. 2002; 10: 1697-1707Google Scholar). Under these conditions, using RORα wild type, we have shown that cholesterol sulfate elicited an increased transcriptional activity of 160% when compared with cholesterol. In contrast, the mutant C288Q did not display this improved transcriptional activity (with respect to cholesterol) when cells were treated with cholesterol sulfate (Fig. 3B). This is consistent with the prediction that the C288Q mutant preferentially reduces the affinity of cholesterol sulfate. We cannot exclude that the only partial cholesterol depletion in these cells might reduce this observed effect on cholesterol sulfate. It would be interesting to investigate RORα transcriptional activity in cells for which the cholesterol:cholesterol sulfate ratio is more drastically modified such as in keratinocytes during differentiation, where this ratio is as low as 5:1, or in ichtyosis-derived cells, where this ratio is even further reduced to 1:1 (16Epstein Jr., E.H. Krauss R.M. Shackleton C.H. Science. 1981; 214: 659-660Google Scholar, 17Williams M.L. Elias P.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 68: 1404-1410Google Scholar). Recently, there has been an increasing interest in steroid sulfonation, in particular for their potential involvement in breast and prostate cancer (18Strott C.A. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 703-732Google Scholar). It is postulated that estrone sulfate in the breast tumors (19Falany J. Macrina N. Falany C.N. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2002; 74: 167-176Google Scholar) could play a role in regulating the level and the activity of 17β-estradiol and that disruption of estrogen sulfotransferase could lead to modulation of the estrogen pathway (20Qian Y.M. Sun X.J. Tong X.P. Li P. Richa J. Song W.C. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 5342-5350Google Scholar). In our study, we show that sulfonation of cholesterol allows improved binding to RORα, reflected by an increased transcriptional activity. The possible exchange of cholesterol with cholesterol sulfate inside the cells could represent a mode of regulation of intracellular cholesterol level since it has been shown that cholesterol sulfate inhibits cholesterol esterification (21Nagakawa M. Kojima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1976; 80: 729-733Google Scholar) and that cholesterol sulfate could potently modulate hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA, the rate-limiting enzyme for cholesterol synthesis (22Williams M.L. Hugues-Fulford M. Elias P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 854: 349-357Google Scholar). The identification of RORα target genes possibly involved in these mechanisms could contribute to a better understanding of these regulations by cholesterol sulfate. Despite the fact that cholesterol sulfate is widely distributed in human tissues, its physiological role is not well understood (for a review, see Ref. 23Strott C.A. Higashi Y. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1268-1278Google Scholar). In skin, an important role for cholesterol sulfate emerged, e.g. in recessive X-linked ichtyosis for which a genetic deficiency in steroid sulfatase leads to the accumulation of cholesterol sulfate in stratum corneum (16Epstein Jr., E.H. Krauss R.M. Shackleton C.H. Science. 1981; 214: 659-660Google Scholar). In addition, the role of cholesterol sulfate in keratinocyte differentiation has been well documented (24Hanley K. Wood L.

It would therefore be interesting to reconsider RORα function in organs such as skin and testis, in which cholesterol sulfate was found to be abundant and which display the strongest expression of RORα (28Steinmayr M. Andre E. Conquet F. Rondi-Reig L. Delhaye-Bouchaud N. Auclair N. Daniel H. Crepel F. Mariani J. Sotelo C. Becker-Andre M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3960-3965Google Scholar). In addition, cholesterol sulfate is also a possible precursor of important sulfonated adrenal steroids such as dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and pregnenolone sulfate (23Strott C.A. Higashi Y. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1268-1278Google Scholar, 29Mason J.I. Hemsell P.G. Endocrinology. 1982; 111: 208-213Google Scholar). It is worth noting that pregnenolone sulfate, now considered as an essential neurosteroid, is actively synthesized in brain, in particular in Purkinje cells (30Tsutui K. Sakamoto H. Ukena K. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 85: 311-321Google Scholar). This information could thus also shed new light on the well described cerebellar phenotype of the RORα mutant mice (31Hamilton B.A. Frankel W.N. Kerrebrock A.W. Hawkins T.L. FitzHugh W. Kusumi K.

https://openalex.org/W2079825884,"The Drosophila immune system discriminates between different classes of infectious microbes and responds with pathogen-specific defense reactions via the selective activation of the Toll and the immune deficiency (Imd) signaling pathways. The Toll pathway mediates most defenses against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi, whereas the Imd pathway is required to resist Gram-negative bacterial infection. Microbial recognition is achieved through peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs); Gram-positive bacteria activate the Toll pathway through a circulating PGRP (PGRP-SA), and Gram-negative bacteria activate the Imd pathway via PGRP-LC, a putative transmembrane receptor, and PGRP-LE. Gram-negative binding proteins (GNBPs) were originally identified in Bombyx mori for their capacity to bind various microbial compounds. Three GNBPs and two related proteins are encoded in the Drosophila genome, but their function is not known. Using inducible expression of GNBP1 double-stranded RNA, we now demonstrate that GNBP1 is required for Toll activation in response to Gram-positive bacterial infection; GNBP1 double-stranded RNA expression renders flies susceptible to Gram-positive bacterial infection and reduces the induction of the antifungal peptide encoding gene Drosomycin after infection by Gram-positive bacteria but not after fungal infection. This phenotype induced by GNBP1 inactivation is identical to a loss-of-function mutation in PGRP-SA, and our genetic studies suggest that GNBP1 acts upstream of the Toll ligand Spätzle. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the detection of Gram-positive bacteria in Drosophila requires two putative pattern recognition receptors, PGRP-SA and GNBP1.

Altogether, our results demonstrate that the detection of Gram-positive bacteria in Drosophila requires two putative pattern recognition receptors, PGRP-SA and GNBP1. The innate immune response is activated by receptors known as pattern recognition receptors, which recognize surface determinants, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PGRP, peptidoglycan recognition proteins; GNBP, Gram-negative binding proteins; Imd, immune deficiency; PG, peptidoglycan; TLR, Toll-like receptor; RNAi, RNA interference; RT-PCR, real-time PCR; Spz, Spätzle; IR, inverted repeat; GFP, green fluorescent protein. peptidoglycan (PG), and mannan, that are conserved among microbes but absent in the host. After microbial recognition, pattern recognition receptors activate signaling cascades that regulate immune reactions (1Girardin S.E. Philpott D.J. Lemaitre B. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 932-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The Drosophila antimicrobial response has been the focus of intense study in recent years and provides a good genetic model for dissecting innate immunity (2Tzou P. De Gregorio E. Lemaitre B. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 3Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar, 4Hultmark D. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 12-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). One of the landmarks of the Drosophila immune response is the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides by the fat body with distinct but overlapping specificities for different microbes. These peptides are secreted into the hemolymph, where they directly kill invading pathogens. Genetic analyses have shown that antimicrobial peptide genes are regulated by the Toll and immune deficiency (Imd) pathways. These two pathways share many common features with the mammalian Toll-like receptor (TLR) and tumor necrosis factor α receptor signaling cascades that regulate NF-κB transcription factors (2Tzou P. De Gregorio E. Lemaitre B. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 3Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. Nat.

The Toll and Imd pathways also activate NF-κB-like transactivators that, in turn, modulate specific transcriptional programs (5De Gregorio E. Spellman P.T. Tzou P. Rubin G.M. Lemaitre B.

The Toll pathway is triggered by the proteolytic cleavage of the Toll ligand, Spätzle (Spz), and regulates the rel proteins dorsal immune-related factor (DIF) and Dorsal. This pathway is mainly activated by Gram-positive bacteria and fungi and controls, in large part, the expression of antimicrobial peptides active against fungi (e.g. Drosomycin) (7Lemaitre B.

In contrast, the Imd pathway mainly responds to Gram-negative bacterial infection and controls antibacterial peptide genes (e.g. Diptericin) via the rel protein, Relish (8Leulier F. Rodriguez A.

Microbial recognition upstream of the Toll and Imd pathways is achieved, at least in part, through peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) (13Kurata S. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2004; 28: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). PGRPs bind to PG, a component of the bacteria envelope, and are found in many species including insects and mammals (14Yoshida H. Kinoshita K. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 15Kang D. Liu G. Lundstrom A. Gelius E. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13772-13777Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), and three of them are currently implicated in the immune response; an extracellular recognition factor, PGRP-SA, activates the Toll pathway in response to Gram-positive bacterial but not fungal infection (17Michel T. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Royet J. Nature. 2001; 414: 756-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar); PGRP-LC, a putative transmembrane protein, acts upstream of the Imd pathway (18Choe K.M.

Nature. 2002; 416: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar); and PGRP-LE, which encodes a secreted PGRP, can activate the Imd pathway when overexpressed in flies (21Takehana A. Katsuyama T. Yano T. Oshima Y. Takada H. Aigaki T. Kurata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13705-13710Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that the Imd pathway is activated by the recognition of DAP-type PG found in Gram-negative and Bacillus bacterial species, whereas the Toll pathway is more responsive to the lysine-type PG found in most Gram-positive bacteria (22Leulier F. Parquet C. Pili-Floury S. Ryu J.H. Caroff M. Lee W.J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Lemaitre B. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 478-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Thus, the Drosophila immune system activates pathogen-specific immune response, at least in part, through the recognition of different forms of PG. Gram-negative binding proteins (GNBPs) form a second class of immune recognition proteins that were initially identified in the Silkworm Bombyx mori for their ability to bind Gram-negative bacteria (23Lee W. Lee J. Kravchenko V. Ulevitch R. Brey P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7888-7893Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In contrast to PGRPs, GNBPs are only found in invertebrates and contain an inactive β1-3 glucanase like domain that is similar to several bacterial glucanase. This domain is also found in β-glucan recognition proteins (βGRPs) that are implicated in glucan sensing in insects and crustacae (24Beschin A. Bilej M. Hanssens F. Raymakers J. Van Dyck E. Revets H.

Han S.J. Choi K.H. Nam K.B. Jang I.H. Lemaitre B. Brey P.T. Lee W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32721-32727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The overexpression of GNBP-1 in cell culture enhanced the LPS-mediated induction of AMP genes in cultured cells, suggesting a role in the Drosophila antimicrobial response (28Kim Y.S. Ryu J.H. Han S.J. Choi K.H. Nam K.B. Jang I.H. Lemaitre B. Brey P.T. Lee W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32721-32727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). However, the exact function of GNBPs in the Drosophila immune response remained unknown. Using a genetic approach, we now report that GNBP1 is required to activate the Toll pathway in response to Gram-positive bacterial infection. Fly Stocks—RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic fly lines of GNBP1 were obtained using the inducible RNAi method. A 500-bp-long cDNA fragment (nucleotide position, 122-621 of the coding sequence) was amplified by PCR and inserted as an inverted repeat (IR) in a modified pUAST transformation vector, pUAST-R57, which possesses an IR formation site consisting of paired KpnI-CpoI and XbaI-SfiI restriction sites. The pUAST-R57 has a 282-bp-long genome fragment of the Drosophila Ret oncogene, in which introns 5 and 6 are contained between two IR fragments to enhance the effect of RNAi (29Kalidas S. Smith D.P. Neuron. 2002; 33: 177-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The IR was constructed in a head-to-head orientation by using a combination of tag sequences of PCR primers and restriction sites on the vector. Detailed cloning procedures will be described elsewhere. 2R. Ueda and K. Saigo, in preparation. Transformation of Drosophila embryos was carried out in w1118 fly stock. Each experiment was repeated using two independent UAS-RNAi insertions. The GAL4 drivers have been described previously (30Leulier F. Vidal S. Saigo K. Ueda R. Lemaitre B. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 996-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In this study, we used adult flies carrying one copy of the UAS-RNAi construct combined with one copy of the GAL4 driver. The GNBP1-IR1 and GNBP1-IR2 insertions are located on the second chromosome. A stable line carrying GNBP1-IR2 and da-GAL4 was used in this study (GNBP1-IR2; da-GAL4) da-Gal4, DD1 (y, w, P(ry+, Diptericin-lacZ), P(w+, Drosomycin-GFP)) flies were used as wild-type strains (31Manfruelli P.

Infection and Survival Experiments—Bacterial and fungal infections were performed by pricking adults with a thin needle dipped previously into a concentrated culture of bacteria. Natural infections with Beauveria bassiana were performed by shaking anesthetized flies for a few seconds in a Petri dish containing a sporulating fungal culture (7Lemaitre B. Reichhart J. Hoffmann J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14614-14619Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Bacterial and fungal strains were described previously (7Lemaitre B. Reichhart J.

Methods Microbiol. 2002; 31: 507-529Crossref Google Scholar. A highly purified solution of Micrococcus luteus PG was produced and injected in flies as described in (22Leulier F. Parquet C.

Quantitative Real-time PCR—For Drosomycin and Diptericin mRNA quantification from whole animals, RNA was extracted using RNA TRIzol™. cDNAs were synthesized using SuperScript II (Invitrogen), and PCR was performed using dsDNA dye SYBR Green I (Roche Diagnostics). Primer pairs for Diptericin (sense, 5′-GCT GCG CAA TCG CTT CTA CT-3′, and antisense, 5′-TGG TGG AGT GGG CTT CAT G-3′), Drosomycin (sense, 5′-CGT GAG AAC CTT TTC CAA TAT GAT G-3′, and antisense, 5′-TCC CAG GAC CAC CAG CAT-3′), and control Rp49 (sense, 5′-GAC GCT TCA AGG GAC AGT ATC TG-3′, and antisense, 5′-AAA CGC GGT TCT GCA TGA G-3′) were used to detect target gene transcripts. SYBR Green analysis was performed on a Lightcycler (Roche Diagnostics). All samples were analyzed in duplicate, and the amount of mRNA detected was normalized to control RP49 mRNA values. We used normalized data to quantify the relative levels of a given mRNA according to cycling threshold analysis (ΔCt). Silencing of GNBP1 Confers Susceptibility to Gram-positive Bacterial Infection—In this study, we have used the inducible expression of GNBP1 double-stranded RNA to analyze the role of GNBP1 in the Drosophila immune response. This approach, which exploits the UAS/GAL4 binary system to drive expression of double-stranded RNA in a defined tissue, is a form of RNAi that has been shown previously to block the expression of defined genes without interfering with the Drosophila immune system (30Leulier F. Vidal S. Saigo K. Ueda R. Lemaitre B. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 996-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 34Reichhart J.M. Ligoxygakis P. Naitza S. Woerfel G. Imler J.L. Gubb D. Genesis. 2002; 34: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We have generated transgenic flies carrying the UAS-GNBP1-IR element. This construct consists of two 500-bp-long inverted repeats (IR) of the GNBP1 gene, separated by an intronic DNA sequence that acts as a spacer, to give a hairpin-loop shaped RNA. Two independent UAS-GNBP1-IR insertions were used in this study (GNBP1-IR1 or GNBP1-IR2). These transgenic flies were crossed to flies carrying GAL4 drivers that express the GAL4 protein strongly and ubiquitously to activate transcription of the hairpin-encoding transgene in the progeny. We confirmed by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) that overexpression of UAS-GNBP1-IR leads to significant decrease of GNBP1 transcripts (data not shown). To address the role of GNBP1 role in the Drosophila host defense, we expressed the UAS-GNBP1-IR transgene using the daughterless-GAL4 (da-GAL4) and Actin5C-GAL4 ubiquitous GAL4 insertions (data not shown for Act5C-GAL4). Flies that express GNBP1-IR ubiquitously through da-GAL4 (referred to as GNBP1-IR) show no detectable defects, indicating that GNBP1 is not essential for development (data not shown). We first assayed the susceptibility of GNBP1-IR flies and other mutant lines to infection by six micro-organisms. We pricked flies with a Gram-negative bacteria (Erwinia carotovara carotovora), two Gram-positive bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus), or the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus, and we naturally infected with the entomopathogenic fungus B. bassiana. Fig. 1(A and B) shows that GNBP1-IR flies rapidly succumb to infection by E. faecalis and S. aureus. The GNBP1-IR phenotype is similar to the phenotype induced by mutation in PGRP-SA and spz, two mutations affecting upstream components of the Toll pathway. We noticed that GNBP1-IR flies exhibit a slightly lower susceptibility to these two Gram-positive bacteria species when compared with spz and PGRP-SA mutants. In contrast to spz flies, GNBP1-IR flies were resistant to fungal infection. Finally, GNBP1-IR flies also resisted infection by Gram-negative bacterial infection, whereas the relish mutants rapidly succumbed (Fig. 1, C-E). This survival analysis demonstrates that the GNBP1 gene product, like PGRP-SA, is required to resist Gram-positive bacterial infection. GNBP1 Mediates Drosomycin Expression in Response to Gram-positive Bacterial Infection—A previous study showed that a mutation in PGRP-SA strongly reduces the expression of the antifungal peptide gene Drosomycin during Gram-positive bacterial infection (17Michel T. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Royet J. Nature. 2001; 414: 756-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Using quantitative RT-PCR, we observed that expression of GNBP1-IR also decreases the expression of the Drosomycin gene after infection by M. luteus, a Gram-positive bacteria (Fig. 2A). This effect was observed at the 24- and 48-h time points when the Drosomycin expression reaches its maximal level. Quantitative measurements show that in GNBP1-IR flies, Drosomycin is expressed to 20-40% of wild-type level at 24 h after challenge (Fig. 2A, and see Figs. 3A, 4B, and 5). We also determined that overexpression of GNBP1-IR with the da-GAL4 driver affects the expression of a Drosomycin-GFP transgene in the adult fat body (Fig. 2B).Fig. 3GNBP1 inhibition has the same affect on Drosomycin expression as the PGRP-SA mutation. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed with total RNA extracts from wild-type (WT, da-GAL4/+) and mutant females collected after septic injury with M. luteus (A), after injection of A. fumigatus spores (B), or after septic injury with E. carotovora (C). Flies carrying mutations affecting the Toll pathway (spzrm7 and PGRP-SAseml) or the Imd pathway (DreddB118, PGRP-LCE12) or overexpressing the UAS-GNBP1-IR with da-GAL4 were collected at 24 h (M. luteus and A. fumigatus) or 6 h (E. carotovora carotovora) after injection. These RT-PCR analysis show that expression of GNBP1-IR with a da-GAL4 driver affects the expression of the Drosomycin (Drs) gene after Gram-positive bacterial infections. Experiments were repeated twice and yielded similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4GNBP1 functions upstream of Spz and does not synergize with PGRP-SA. A, overexpression of UAS-spz* (encoding an active form of Spz) by the da-GAL4 driver induced Drosomycin expression in the absence of challenge and independently of the GNBP1 gene. The genotypes of the tested flies are UAS-spz*/+; da-GAL4/+ and UAS-spz*/GNBP1-IR; da-GAL4/+. Noninfected flies (C) and flies collected 24 h after bacteria challenge with M. luteus were used for control of the Drosomycin expression range. WT, wild type.

C, the survival analysis was performed as follows: da-GAL4/+ (♦), da-GAL4; UAS-GNBP1-IR2 (▴), PGRPSAseml; UAS-GNBP1-IR2; da-GAL4 (⋄), PGRP-SAseml (○) and spzrm7 (×), flies as in Fig. 1A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 5Gram-positive bacterial lysine-type PG-mediated Drosomycin expression requires both GNBP1 and PGRP-SA. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed with total RNA extracts from wild-type (WT, da-GAL4/+) and mutant females collected 24 h after injection with 9 nl of M. luteus PG ([PG] = 5 mg/ml). In flies carrying mutations affecting the Toll pathway (spzrm7 and PGRPSAseml) or overexpressing the GNBP1-IR construct, Drosomycin expression by M. luteus PG is blocked. Mutations affecting the Imd pathway (kenny1, PGRP-LCE12) did not affect Drosomycin expression after injection of lysine-type PG.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next compared the effects of GNBP1 RNAi on Drosomycin and Diptericin expression after challenge by different classes of micro-organisms with other mutations affecting the Toll or the Imd pathway. These experiments confirm that the spz mutation blocks Drosomycin expression in response to both Gram-positive bacteria and fungi, whereas mutations in the Imd pathway (PGRP-LC and Dredd) affect Diptericin expression in response to Gram-negative bacterial infection. Fig. 3A shows that the expression of GNBP1-IR inhibits Drosomycin gene expression after challenge by the Gram-positive bacterial species M. luteus, although GNBP1-IR has a slightly weaker effect than the spz and PGRP-SAseml mutations (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, the level of Drosomycin transcripts was comparable with wild-type after infection by the fungus A. fumigatus (Fig. 3B). Finally, GNBP1 silencing did not affect the expression of the Diptericin gene in response to Gram-negative bacteria (Fig. 3C). This pattern of antimicrobial peptide gene expression in the GNBP1-IR flies is similar to the pattern displayed in the PGRP-SA mutant. Thus, our results demonstrate that, like PGRP-SA, GNBP1 regulates the Drosomycin gene, a target of the Toll pathway, in response to Gram-positive bacterial infection. GNBP1 Functions Upstream of the Toll Ligand Spz—Overexpression of a mature form of the Toll ligand spz leads to the constitutive transcription of the Drosomycin gene (35Ligoxygakis P. Pelte N. Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. Science. 2002; 297: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). Fig. 4 shows that expression of GNBP1-IR did not reduce Drosomycin expression in flies that overexpress spz, indicating that GNBP1 does not function downstream of Spz. This observation and the report that GNBP1 is present in the culture medium of mbn-2 cells (25Lee S.Y. Wang R. Soderhall K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1337-1343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) strongly suggest that GNBP1 functions as a secreted microbial recognition factor upstream of Spz. PGRP-SA and GNBP1 Function in the Same Pathway—We next tested whether GNBP1 and PGRP-SA function in a synergistic fashion; i.e. do flies carrying mutation affecting both GNBP1 and PGRP-SA have a stronger phenotype than either single mutant? For this experiment, we expressed GNBP1-IR with da-GAL4 in PGRP-SAseml flies. Fig. 4B shows that inactivation of GNBP1 by gene silencing did not significantly increase the PGRP-SA phenotype. Both GNBP1-IR; PGRP-SAseml flies and PGRP-SA flies died at the same rate after infection by the Gram-positive bacteria E. faecalis and failed to express the Drosomycin gene (Fig. 4, B and C). No additional phenotype was observed in GNBP1-IR; PGRP-SAseml flies. This points out that PGRP-SA and GNBP1 do not work in synergy but are both required to regulate Drosomycin expression. Altogether, our genetic analysis indicates that GNPB1 and PGRP-SA are both required to regulate the Toll pathway in response to Gram-positive bacterial infection and probably function upstream of Spz. GNBP1 Is Required for Toll Activation in Response to Lysine-type PG—GNBP1 was initially identified as a pattern recognition receptor for LPS or β1-3 glucan (25Lee S.Y. Wang R. Soderhall K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1337-1343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar); however, our present results demonstrate a role of GNBP1 in the response to Gram-positive bacterial infection. Recently, we have reported that lysine-type PG, a PG form found in most Gram-positive bacteria is a very potent inducer of Drosomycin, suggesting that PG is one of the main bacterial determinants of Gram-positive bacteria recognized by the Toll pathway (22Leulier F. Parquet C. Pili-Floury S. Ryu J.H. Caroff M. Lee W.J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Lemaitre B. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 478-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that Drosomycin expression by lysine-type PG is mediated through PGRP-SA and Spz (22Leulier F. Parquet C. Pili-Floury S. Ryu J.H. Caroff M. Lee W.J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Lemaitre B. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 478-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). To determine whether the Drosomycin induction by lysine-type PG also requires GNBP1, we injected GNBP1-IR flies with 9 nl of a solution of highly purified PG extracted from the Gram-positive bacterial species M. luteus and monitored the level of Drosomycin expression by RT-PCR. Fig. 5 clearly shows that overexpression of GNBP1-IR blocks the induction of Drosomycin in response to lysine-type PG as observed in PGRP-SA and spz mutants. This experiment demonstrates that GNBP1 is required either for the direct recognition of lysine-type PG or in a step downstream of the recognition event. In this study, we have identified GNPB1, a putative pattern recognition receptor, as a regulator of the Drosophila antimicrobial response to Gram-positive bacteria. GNBP1 inactivation by RNAi induces a high susceptibility to infection by Gram-positive bacterial species and reduces the expression of the Drosomycin gene after challenge by Gram-positive bacteria and lysine-type PG. The GNBP1 phenotypes we observed are identical to the phenotypes induced by a mutation in PGRP-SA. We observed, however, that GNBP-IR flies have a slightly weaker phenotype than PGRP-SAseml flies that carry a genetically null mutation in PGRP-SA. It is generally assumed that RNAi mimics partial loss-of-function mutations of the target gene. Thus, we cannot exclude that a null mutation in GNBP1 may induce a stronger phenotype than those described here. Several studies have already demonstrated that Drosomycin expression is tightly regulated by the Toll pathway in response to Gram-positive bacterial infections. Therefore, our results strongly suggest that, like PGRP-SA, GNBP1 regulates the Toll pathway in response to Gram-positive bacterial infection. Our observation that GNBP1-IR does not interfere with the constitutive expression of Drosomycin induced by the overexpression of a mature form of Spz suggests that GNBP1 acts upstream of the Toll ligand. A role for GNBP1 in the extracellular compartment is supported by the observation that GNBP1 is secreted into the culture medium of mbn-2 cells (25Lee S.Y. Wang R. Soderhall K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1337-1343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The implication of GNBP1 in the response to Gram-positive bacteria was unexpected since GNBPs contain a mutated β1-3 glucanase domain that is present in β-glucan recognition protein of other insects (24Beschin A. Bilej M. Hanssens F. Raymakers J. Van Dyck E. Revets H. Brys L. Gomez J. De Baetselier P. Timmermans M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24948-24954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 25Lee S.Y. Wang R. Soderhall K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 7505-7514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). However, our data are supported by a recent study in the silkworm B. mori showing that a specific anti-GNBP antibody blocks the PGRP-mediated activation of the prophenoloxydase cascade by PG but not by β1-3-glucan. 3M. Ochiai and M. Ashida, personal communication. Although there is no evidence for direct interaction between GNBP1 and a Gram-positive bacterial compound, this biochemical study and our genetic results point to a clear implication of some members of the GNBP family in the activation of immune response by PG. The complexity of pattern recognition receptor/microbial ligand interactions was recently underlined by the implication of a PGRP from the beetle Holotrichia diomphalia in the activation of the prophenoloxidase cascade in response to β1,3-D glucan (36Lee M.H. Osaki T. Lee J.Y. Baek M.J. Zhang R. Park J.W. Kawabata S.I. Soderhall K. Lee B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not surprising that GNBPs may also be involved in the recognition of distinct classes of micro-organisms. The similarities between the phenotypes induced by the PGRP-SA mutation and GNBP1 RNAi and our observation that GNBP1 inactivation did not block Drosomycin induction by Spz expression suggest that both proteins function in the same extracellular pathway that links Gram-positive bacterial recognition to activation of Spz by serine protease(s). It has already been reported that in vitro, PGRP-SA binds to lysine-type PG found on Gram-positive bacteria cell walls. Our observation that the activation of the Toll pathway by lysine-type PG requires both PGRP-SA and GNBP1 indicates that the two proteins cannot function independently. The implication of two putative pattern recognition receptors in sensing Gram-positive bacteria is reminiscent of the situation observed in mammals, where protein complexes rather than a single recognition receptor participate in LPS and Glucan recognition. In vertebrates, it is proposed that CD14 transfers LPS to the co-receptor MD2/TLR4 (37Akashi S. Saitoh S. Wakabayashi Y. Kikuchi T. Takamura N. Nagai Y. Kusumoto Y. Fukase K. Kusumoto S. Adachi Y. Kosugi A. Miyake K. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). GNBP1 may play a similar function by acting upstream of PGRP-SA. However, we believe that this is not likely because PGRP-SA is a secreted protein that binds to lysine-type PG by itself in vitro (16Werner T. Liu G. Kang D. Ekengren S. Steiner H. Hultmark D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13772-13777Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Alternatively, GNBP1 may be part of a recognition complex with PGRP-SA. Under this hypothesis, GNBP1 could facilitate PG sensing by PGRP-SA or could bind to another factor from Gram-positive bacteria (for example, lipotechoic acid or techoic acid). Finally, we cannot exclude that GNBP1 is not directly involved in microbial recognition but functions as a downstream adaptor that links PGRP-SA to the serine protease that processes Spz. The crystal structure of PGRP-LB has revealed the presence of a hydrophobic groove in the PGRP domain that may be involved in protein-protein interactions (38Kim M.S. Byun M. Oh B.H. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). GNBP1 is a good candidate for the factor that interacts with a similar domain in PGRP-SA to establish a link between PGRP-SA and a putative downstream serine protease. Additional biochemical studies are required to elucidate the relationship between PGRP-SA and GNBP1 in Gram-positive bacteria sensing and to determine whether GNBP1 interacts directly with microbial ligands. In conclusion, using an RNAi approach, we demonstrate that GNBP1 plays a critical role in the antibacterial defense against Gram-positive bacteria. The existence of a specific phenotype for GNBP1 demonstrates the absence of redundancy among the three Drosophila GNBP members as observed previously in other large families of recognition proteins such as TLRs and PGRPs. This study also confirms the power of the inducible expression of the double-stranded RNA technique to address the in vivo function of genes that mediate the Drosophila antimicrobial response. Disruptions of the GNBP2 and GNBP3 genes using a similar approach are promising projects to determine the exact function of the GNBP family.

https://openalex.org/W2081917419,"In green plants, the xanthophyll carotenoid zeaxanthin is synthesized transiently under conditions of excess light energy and participates in photoprotection. In the Arabidopsis lut2 npq2 double mutant, all xanthophylls were replaced constitutively by zeaxanthin, the only xanthophyll whose synthesis was not impaired. The relative proportions of the different chlorophyll antenna proteins were strongly affected with respect to the wild-type strain. The major antenna, LHCII, did not form trimers, and its abundance was strongly reduced as was CP26, albeit to a lesser extent. In contrast, CP29, CP24, LHCI proteins, and the PSI and PSII core complexes did not undergo major changes. PSII-LHCII supercomplexes were not detectable while the PSI-LHCI supercomplex remained unaffected. The effect of zeaxanthin accumulation on the stability of the different Lhc proteins was uneven: the LHCII proteins from lut2 npq2 had a lower melting temperature as compared with the wild-type complex while LHCI showed increased resistance to heat denaturation. Consistent with the loss of LHCII, light-state 1 to state 2 transitions were suppressed, the photochemical efficiency in limiting light was reduced and photosynthesis was saturated at higher light intensities in lut2 npq2 leaves, resulting in a photosynthetic phenotype resembling that of high light-acclimated leaves. Zeaxanthin functioned in vivo as a light-harvesting accessory pigment in lut2 npq2 chlorophyll antennae. As a whole, the in vivo data are consistent with the results obtained by using recombinant Lhc proteins reconstituted in vitro with purified zeaxanthin. While PSII photoinhibition was similar in wild type and lut2 npq2 exposed to high light at low temperature, the double mutant was much more resistant to photooxidative stress and lipid peroxidation than the wild type. The latter observation is consistent with an antioxidant and lipid protective role of zeaxanthin in vivo.

The latter observation is consistent with an antioxidant and lipid protective role of zeaxanthin in vivo. When vascular plants or green algae are suddenly exposed to high light, the diepoxide xanthophyll violaxanthin is rapidly converted via the intermediate antheraxanthin to the epoxide-free zeaxanthin under the action of the enzyme violaxanthin deepoxidase (1Yamamoto H.J. Pure Appl. Chem. 1979; 51: 639-648Google Scholar, 2Eskling M. Arvidsson P.-O. Akerlund H.E. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 806-816Google Scholar). The latter enzyme is located in the lumen of the thylakoids and binds to the thylakoid membrane in response to lumen acidification in the light (3Hager A. Holocher K. Planta. 1994; 192: 581-589Google Scholar). Upon return to light limiting conditions, zeaxanthin is epoxidized back to violaxanthin by a zeaxanthin epoxidase enzyme localized on the stromal side of the thylakoid membranes. These stoichiometric and cyclic conversions of violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, and zeaxanthin are called the violaxanthin cycle and have profound effects on light harvesting and light energy utilization in Photosystem (PS) 1The abbreviations used are: PS, photosystem; LHC (I and II), light-harvesting complex (of PSI and PSII); Lhca and Lhcb, protein component of LHCI and LHCII, respectively; CP24, CP26 and CP29, minor LHCII (Lhcb6, Lhcb5, and Lhcb4, respectively); NPQ, nonphotochemical quenching; WT, wild type; TL, thermoluminescence; Φ, quantum yield of O2 evolution; E, Emerson enhancement; DM, dodecyl-d-maltoside. II. It is well established that zeaxanthin synthesis and lumen acidification in high light act synergistically to convert PSII from a state of maximum efficiency of light harvesting to a state of high energy dissipation in the form of heat (4Horton P. Ruban A.V. Walters R.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 655-684Google Scholar, 5Demming-Adams B. Adams III, W.W. Nature. 2000; 403: 371-374Google Scholar, 6Müller P. Li X.-P. Niyogi K.K. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 1558-1566Google Scholar). The latter phenomenon is usually measured as a nonphotochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence (NPQ). NPQ is important for the protection of the photosynthetic apparatus against photodamage; it can protect the photosensitive PSII reaction center from overexcitation, thereby increasing its resistance to photoinhibition, as confirmed in NPQ-deficient Arabidopsis mutants (7Niyogi K.K. Grossman A.R. Björkman O. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1121-1134Google Scholar, 8Havaux M. Niyogi K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8762-8767Google Scholar, 9Havaux M. Kloppstech K. Planta. 2001; 213: 953-966Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been shown that zeaxanthin increases the resistance to thylakoid membrane photodestruction through lipid peroxidation by a mechanism distinct from NPQ, which remains to be clarified (8Havaux M. Niyogi K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8762-8767Google Scholar, 10Havaux M. Bonfils J.-M. Lütz C. Niyogi K.K. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 273-284Google Scholar, 11Müller-Moulé P. Havaux M. Niyogi K.K. Plant Physiol. 2003; 10.1104/pp103.025320Google Scholar, 12Baroli I. Do A.D. Yamane T. Niyogi K.K. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 1-18Google Scholar). The xanthophyll cycle and the associated NPQ exert their protective roles mainly under conditions of fluctuating light intensity (9Havaux M. Kloppstech K. Planta. 2001; 213: 953-966Google Scholar, 13Külheim C. Agren J. Jansson S. Science. 2002; 297: 91-93Google Scholar). Zeaxanthin is virtually absent from green plants grown under optimal conditions, and it accumulates transiently only under excess light energy. However, the constitutive presence of zeaxanthin in the chlorophyll antennae has been reported in a number of mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana, which thus provide an interesting source for analyzing the effects of this carotenoid on the organization and function of the photosynthetic apparatus (14Tardy F. Havaux M. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B:Biol. 1996; 34: 87-94Google Scholar, 15Hurry V. Anderson J.M. Chow W.S. Osmond C.B. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 639-648Google Scholar, 16Lokstein H. Tian L. Polle J.E.W. DellaPenna D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 309-319Google Scholar). In the Arabidopsis aba mutants, zeaxanthin epoxidase is not functional, causing accumulation of zeaxanthin at the expense of the epoxy-xanthophylls antheraxanthin, violaxanthin, and neoxanthin (17Duckham S.C. Linforth R.S.T. Taylor I. Plant Cell Environ. 1991; 14: 601-606Google Scholar, 18Rock C.D. Zeevaart J.A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7496-7499Google Scholar). For instance, in the aba1 mutant, zeaxanthin represents ∼50% of the xanthophyll pool (14Tardy F. Havaux M. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B:Biol. 1996; 34: 87-94Google Scholar). Although this xanthophyll perturbation had limited effects on the photosynthetic performance of the leaves, a decreased stability of the trimeric LHCII complexes (major chlorophyll antenna of PSII) and a weakened association between LHCII trimers and the minor LHCII antennae were noticed (14Tardy F. Havaux M. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B:Biol. 1996; 34: 87-94Google Scholar, 15Hurry V. Anderson J.M. Chow W.S. Osmond C.B. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 639-648Google Scholar, 16Lokstein H. Tian L. Polle J.E.W. DellaPenna D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 309-319Google Scholar,19Pesaresi P. Morales F. Moya I. Bassi R. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: from Light to Biosphere. IV. Kluwer Acad Publishers, 1995: 95-98Google Scholar). However, the aba mutants are also deficient in the hormone abscisic acid (ABA), which is synthesized from neoxanthin through a series of intermediates. Consequently, the aba mutants have a number of additional problems: they cannot regulate stomatal opening, they exhibit a dramatic wilty phenotype and they require special growth conditions (water-saturated atmosphere). Niyogi et al. (7Niyogi K.K. Grossman A.R. Björkman O. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1121-1134Google Scholar) identified a new allele of aba1, npq2-1. Interestingly, npq2-1 is not a complete loss-of-function mutation: ABA is synthesized in sufficient amounts so that the mutant is not particularly sensitive to wilting (7Niyogi K.K. Grossman A.R. Björkman O. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1121-1134Google Scholar). Nevertheless, epoxy-xanthophylls are drastically reduced to trace amounts. Thus, as far as xanthophyll pigments are concerned, npq2-1 is more appropriate for functional studies than the previously isolated aba alleles. Npq2-1 was crossed with the lut2 mutant, deficient in lutein, and the resulting double mutant, which does not contain any xanthophyll carotenoid except zeaxanthin, was analyzed for its photosynthetic characteristics and high light responses. Substitution of all xanthophylls by zeaxanthin selectively affected the PSII antenna size, resulting in a photosynthetic phenotype resembling, in some aspects, that of high light-acclimated leaves, and enhanced noticeably the tolerance of the leaves to photooxidative stress. In contrast to the case of Lhcb proteins forming the PSII antenna system, the stability of the Lhca proteins of PSI appeared to be enhanced by zeaxanthin. Plant Material and Stress Treatments—The wild type (WT), the double mutant lut2 npq2, and the ch1 mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. were grown under controlled conditions of light (300 μmol of photons m-2 s-1; photoperiod, 8 h), temperature (23 °C/20 °C, day/night) and relative air humidity (50–70%). The ch1-1 and npq2-1 mutants were obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Center, and a T-DNA insertion allele of lut2 was isolated through PCR screening from the Versailles T-DNA collection. Detached leaves were exposed to high light (1300 μmol of photons m-2 s-1) at 10 °C, as described elsewhere (20Havaux M. Lütz C. Grimm B. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 300-310Google Scholar). Pigment Analyses—Photosynthetic pigments extracted in methanol were separated and quantified by HPLC, as described in detail elsewhere (20Havaux M. Lütz C. Grimm B. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 300-310Google Scholar). Thylakoid Preparation—Thylakoid membranes were prepared according to Ref. 21Robinson H.H. Yocum C.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 590: 97-106Google Scholar except that a mixture of the proteinase inhibitors (Sigma) was used in the first step, and Tricine was replaced by HEPES in the last step. The protein content of thylakoid membranes was determined with a modified Lowry protein assay using bovine serum albumine as a standard (Sigma). The absorbance and fluorescence-excitation spectra of thylakoid suspensions were measured with an Uvikon 954 spectrophotometer and a PerkinElmer LS50B luminometer, respectively. Stroma lamellae were isolated from thylakoids disrupted in a French press as described elsewhere (22Bassi R. Giacometti G.M. Simpson D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 935: 152-165Google Scholar). Fluorescence emission spectra of the isolated stroma lamellae were measured in liquid nitrogen before and after addition of octyl glucoside (0.5%). Protein Separation and Quantification—Non-denaturing Deriphat-PAGE was performed following the method developped by Peter and Thornber (23Peter G.F. Thornber J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16745-16754Google Scholar). The composition of the stacking gel was: 3.5% (w/v) acrylamide 48/1.5 (48% acrylamide/1.5% bisacrylamide), 12 mm Tris, 48 mm glycine, pH 8.5. The composition of the resolving gel was: acrylamide (48%/1.5%) gradient from 4% al 8% (w/v) stabilized by a glycerol gradient from 8% to 16%, 12 mm Tris, 48 mm glycine, pH 8.5. Gels were polymerized with 0.02% ammonium persulfate and 0.075% TEMED. For 1.5-mm-thick gels a volume of 40 μ1 of extract with 25 μg of chlorophylls was loaded per lane. The electrophoresis reservoir buffer was 12.4 mm Tris, 96 mm glycine, pH 8.3, and 0.1% Deriphat-160. Purified Deriphat-160 was used. Gels were electrophoresed overnight at 4 °C under a constant voltage of 50 V. Separation of the pigmented thylakoid complexes was carried out by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (24Caffarri S. Croce R. Breton J. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35924-35933Google Scholar). Membranes corresponding to 600 μg of chlorophyll were washed with 5 mm EDTA and then solubilized in 1 ml of 0.6% dodecyl-d-maltoside (-DM), 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, by vortexing for 1 min. The solubilized samples were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min to eliminate non-solubilized material and then fractionated by ultracentrifugation in a 0.1–1 m sucrose gradient containing 0.06% -DM and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5 (22 h at 280,000 × g at 4 °C). The green bands of the sucrose gradient were harvested with a syringe and were submitted to SDS-PAGE separation with a Tris-Tricine buffer system as previously described (25Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Google Scholar). The concentration of the separated proteins was determined from the intensity of the bands stained with Coomassie Blue. The blue color intensity was calibrated with known concentrations of recombinant Lhcb3 protein. Thylakoid membrane proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE in 13% acrylamide gels were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated with the antibody raised against Lhcb2, CP26 (Lhcb5), CP24 (Lhcb6), or CP29 (Lhcb4) and were revealed with alkaline phosphatase conjugate. Band intensities were analyzed using the Gene Tools software for Sungene (Synoptics Ltd.). Membranes for D1 were revealed by enhanced luminescence as described elsewhere (26Meurer J. Meierhoff K. Westhoff P. Planta. 1996; 198: 385-396Google Scholar). In Vitro Reconstitution of Lhca Proteins—Lhca 1 and Lhca 4 proteins were overexpressed in bacteria and reconstituted in vitro with purified pigments as previously reported (27Croce R. Morosinotto T. Castelletti S. Breton J. Bassi R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 29-40Google Scholar) by using either a full carotenoid extract from thylakoids or purified zeaxanthin. Protein Stability—The stability of the minor and major LHCIIs, separated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, was analyzed by following the decay of the 492-nm circular-dichroism signal induced by increasing temperature from 20 °C to 80 °C with a time slope of 1 °C min-1 and a resolution of 0.2 °C (28Formaggio E. Cinque G. Bassi R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 1157-1166Google Scholar). The thermal stability of the protein was determined by finding the temperature corresponding to half of the signal decay. All samples were normalized to an optical density of 0.6. The same procedure was used to measure the stability of recombinant Lhca1 and Lhca4 proteins. Chlorophyll Fluorescence—Chlorophyll fluorescence from intact leaves was measured at 25 °C and 10 °C with a PAM-2000 fluorometer (Walz), as described previously (20Havaux M. Lütz C. Grimm B. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 300-310Google Scholar). The initial level of chlorophyll fluorescence (Fo) was excited with a dim red light modulated at 600 Hz. The true Fo level was determined after a 2-s pulse of far-red light. Variable fluorescence was induced in diuron-infiltrated leaves with a red light of 6.5 μmol m-2 s-1 produced by a light emitting diode. Leaf discs were infiltrated for 30 min with 2.5 10-5m diuron. The half-time of the fluorescence rise was taken as a measure of the functional antenna size of PSII (29Malkin S. Armond P.A. Mooney H.A. Fork D.C. Plant Physiol. 1981; 67: 570-579Google Scholar). The maximal quantum yield of PSII photochemistry was measured in dark-adapted leaves from the maximal fluorescence level (Fm) and the initial level (Fo): (Fm - Fo)/Fm = Fv/Fm. Fm was obtained by applying a 800-ms pulse of intense white light. The actual quantum yield of PSII photochemistry was measured in light-adapted leaves by the ratio ΔF/Fm′; where Fm′ is the maximal fluorescence level and ΔF is the difference between Fm′ and the steady-state fluorescence level. White light was produced by a Schott KL1500 light source. Chlorophyll fluorescence emission spectra from leaf discs or thylakoid suspensions were measured in liquid nitrogen with a PerkinElmer LS50B luminometer equipped with fiber optic light guides (10Havaux M. Bonfils J.-M. Lütz C. Niyogi K.K. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 273-284Google Scholar). Photoacoustic Spectroscopy—Photosynthetic O2 evolution was estimated from the photobaric component of the photoacoustic signal generated by leaf discs illuminated with white, green, or red light modulated at 19 Hz. The experimental setup and the procedure used to separate the photobaric signal from the photothermal signal have been described in detail elsewhere (Ref. 9Havaux M. Kloppstech K. Planta. 2001; 213: 953-966Google Scholar, see also Ref. 30Malkin S. Canaani O. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 45: 493-526Google Scholar for review). Green light (37 μmol of photon m-2 s-1) was obtained by filtering white light through an Oriel 57558 broadband interference filter (peak wavelength, 510 nm; bandwidth, 60 nm) and red light (57 μmol of photon m-2 s-1) was obtained with an Oriel 57610 filter (peak wavelength, 645 nm; bandwidth, 70 nm). The photon flux density of the green and red light beams was adjusted so that the level of light absorption by the leaf samples (estimated by the amplitude of the light-saturated photothermal signal, APT+) was similar in both spectral domains. The quantum yield of O2 evolution (Φ) was estimated by the ratio between the amplitude of the photobaric signal (Aox) and the amplitude of the maximal (light-saturated) photothermal signal (Apt): Aox/Apt (30Malkin S. Canaani O. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 45: 493-526Google Scholar). The Emerson enhancement E of O2 evolution was determined in state 1 or in state 2 by adding a continuous far-red light (>715 nm, 75 watts m-2) to the modulated blue-green light (obtained with a BG38 Schott filter; photon flux density, 50 μmol m-2 s-1). E (%) = [(Φ (+FR)-Φ (-FR))/Φ (-FR)] × 100. State 2 was reached by illuminating the leaves with the blue-green light for min. 10 min, and state 1 was obtained after 10-min illumination with far-red light. Photon flux densities were measured with a Li-Cor quantum meter (Li-185B/Li-190SB). Thermoluminometry—The thermoluminescence (TL) emitted by leaf discs (diameter, 1 cm) was measured with a laboratory-built apparatus described elsewhere (31Havaux M. Trends Plant Sci. 2003; 8: 409-413Google Scholar). The sample was slowly heated at a rate of 6 °C min-1 from 25 to 150 °C. The amplitude of the TL band peaking at ∼135 °C was used as an index of lipid peroxidation (30Malkin S. Canaani O. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 45: 493-526Google Scholar, 31Havaux M. Trends Plant Sci. 2003; 8: 409-413Google Scholar). Polarography—O2 exchange by detached leaves was measured at 25 °C with a Clark-type O2 electrode (Hansatech LD2/2). Leaves were illuminated with white light produced by a LS2 light source (Hansatech). Photon flux density was adjusted using neutral density filters. High CO2 was generated in the electrode with a carbonate/bicarbonate buffer. Leaves of the Arabidopsis lut2 npq2 double mutant are completely deficient in the xanthophylls neoxanthin, violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, and lutein (Table I). The missing xanthophylls are replaced by zeaxanthin, resulting in a carotenoid/chlorophyll ratio (0.15) and a xanthophyll/chlorophyll ratio (0.09) not very different from the wild-type values (0.17 and 0.12, respectively). However, lut2 npq2 leaves were paler than wild-type leaves, and this was due to a substantial reduction (∼40%) of the total chlorophyll and carotenoid content per leaf area unit. This pigment decrease was accompanied by a noticeable increase in the chlorophyll a to b ratio (from 2.4 to 3.3), as previously reported for the lut2 aba1 mutant (16Lokstein H. Tian L. Polle J.E.W. DellaPenna D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 309-319Google Scholar, 33Pogson B.J. Niyogi K.K. Björkman O. DellaPenna D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13324-13329Google Scholar). An augmentation of the chlorophyll a-to-chlorophyll b ratio is usually interpreted as resulting from a decrease in the PSII light-harvesting system (which binds most of the chlorophyll b molecules) and/or an increase in the PSI/PSII ratio. However, we cannot exclude that this change was due to alterations of the chlorophyll a to chlorophyll b ratio within individual chlorophyll proteins in the light-harvesting antenna. Indeed, recombinant LHCII complexes reconstituted with zeaxanthin as the only carotenoid have been shown to have an increased chlorophyll a/chlorophyll b ratio as compared with native LHCII (34Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29613-29623Google Scholar).Table IPhotosynthetic pigment content of Arabidopsis WT and lut2 npq2 leaves Data are mean values of 4–5 experiments ± S.D.

As compared with wild type, lut2 npq2 exhibited a noticeable decrease (∼30%) in the PSII bands (at 685 and 695 nm) while the PSI band (at 730 nm) was unchanged (Fig. 1a). This selective decrease in PSII fluorescence emission was confirmed in thylakoid suspensions (Fig. 1b). The light energy distribution between PSI and PSII was also determined in vivo using the photoacoustic method. Fig. 2 shows the photobaric photoacoustic signal (due to modulated O2 evolution, see Ref. 30Malkin S. Canaani O. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 45: 493-526Google Scholar) generated by an Arabidopsis leaf disc illuminated with a weak blue-green light beam (350–600 nm) modulated at a low frequency of 19 Hz. The signal amplitude was lower in the double mutant relative to wild type, indicating a reduction (approximately -20%) of photosynthetic O2 evolution. Because of its spectral characteristics, the measuring light is preferentially absorbed by PSII pigments, and, consequently, linear electron transfer and O2 evolution are limited by the photon delivery to PSI. When a strong (continuous) far-red light, absorbed almost exclusively by PSI, is added to the measuring light, this limitation is removed and O2 evolution increases, becoming limited by the photochemical potential (light absorption × quantum yield) of PSII. This effect can be quantified by the so-called Emerson enhancement (E), which is the ratio of the O2 evolution signal measured in the presence of the far-red background light to the O2 signal measured in its absence (30Malkin S. Canaani O. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 45: 493-526Google Scholar). 10-min exposure to the blue-green light drove wild-type leaves to the light state 2 characterized by a relatively even distribution of light energy between the two photosystems resulting from the migration of LHCII toward PSI. Consequently, E was low (∼7%) under those light conditions (Fig. 2, upper trace). In state 1 (i.e. after prolonged illumination with far-red light), E was high, ∼20%, indicating a strong imbalance of blue-green light distribution in favor of PSII. Strikingly, E was measurable in the double mutant neither in state 1 nor in state 2 (Fig. 2, lower trace), indicating that the double mutation removed the PSI limitation of electron transport and that PSII was limiting in all light conditions. Thus, the fluorescence and photoacoustic data presented above indicate a selective decrease in PSII excitation in lut2 npq2 leaves, which could be due to a decrease in the number of PSII centers and/or a reduction of the PSII antenna system. The strong decrease in the 685-nm fluorescence band emitted by lut2 npq2 thylakoid suspensions, attributed in part to LHCII-chlorophylls, supports the latter possibility (Fig. 1b). PSII and PSI Antenna Composition and Organization—We estimated the functional antenna size of PSII by in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence induction measurements in the presence of the herbicide diuron, as described by Malkin et al. (29Malkin S. Armond P.A. Mooney H.A. Fork D.C. Plant Physiol. 1981; 67: 570-579Google Scholar). The half-time of the induced fluorescence rise in lut2 npq2 leaves (∼110 ± 18 ms) was noticeably higher than that measured in wild type (63 ± 10 ms), clearly indicating smaller PSII antennae in the former plants. This effect was confirmed by the non-denaturing green gels presented in Fig. 3. No LHCII trimer was detected in the double mutant. This loss was associated with an increase in the LHCII monomer band. A similar phenomenon was reported in the Arabidopsis lut2 aba1 mutant (16Lokstein H. Tian L. Polle J.E.W. DellaPenna D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 309-319Google Scholar). However, it is evident that the accumulation of LHCII monomers in lut2 npq2 compensated only partially for the loss of LHCII trimer. We also observed that the absence of LHCII trimer in lut2 npq2 was accompanied by a complete disappearance of the PSII-LHCII supercomplexes as well as by a loss of the LHCII-CP29-CP24 supercomplex. In contrast, the PSI-LHCI band was found in both wild type and lut2 npq2, and the PSII reaction center band was marginally affected by the double mutation. This was confirmed by the separation of the thylakoid pigmented complexes by ultracentrifugation on sucrose gradient (Fig. 4): the LHCII trimer band disappeared from the lut2 npq2 preparation while the PSI-LHCI and the PSII RC bands were not affected appreciably. The latter observation is consistent with the presence of normal concentration of β-carotene in lut2 npq2 leaves (see Table I) since this carotenoid is present in the LHCI complexes and the PS reaction centers, not in the LHCII complexes (35Bassi R. Caffarri S. Photosynth. Res. 2000; 64: 243-256Google Scholar). The different sucrose bands were harvested and their protein content was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5). It is evident that the relative proportions of the PSII antennae were noticeably changed in lut2 npq2: Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 (present mainly in lanes II, III and VI in wild type and lane II in lut2 npq2) were strongly reduced. CP26 (Lhcb5) decreased also in the double mutant while CP24 (Lhcb6) and CP29 (Lhcb4) increased. The abundance of the PSII antennae was quantified by converting the intensity of the Coomassie Blue staining into protein concentration, and the data are summarized in Table II. On a chlorophyll basis, CP26 was reduced by 30% in lut2 npq2. Lhcb1 + 2 was strongly decreased by a factor of about 2. CP24, CP29, and Lhcb3 were not reduced. All Lhca proteins (see lane V in Fig. 5, bands enclosed in a rectangle) were found in lut2 npq2, and their relative abundance was not changed significantly with respect to wild type.Fig. 4Separation of thylakoid pigmented complexes of wild-type and lut2 npq2 thylakoids by ultracentrifugation on sucrose gradient (FP, free pigments).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 5Separation of the sucrose bands I-IV (see Fig. 4) by SDS-PAGE.

https://openalex.org/W1988220701,"In addition to its demethylating function, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR) also plays an important role in inducing cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and cell death. However, the mechanism by which 5-aza-CdR induces antineoplastic activity is not clear. In this study, we found that 5-aza-CdR at limited concentrations (0.01-5 microm) induces inhibition of cell proliferation as well as increased p53/p21(Waf1/Cip1) expression in A549 cells (wild-type p53) but not in H1299 (p53-null) and H719 cells (p53 mutant). The p53-dependent p21(Waf1/Cip1) expression induced by 5-aza-CdR was not seen in A549 cells transfected with the wild-type human papilloma virus type-16 E6 gene that induces p53 degradation. Furthermore, deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis of the p21 promoter reveals that 5-aza-CdR induces p21(Waf1/Cip1) expression through two p53 binding sites in the p21 promoter. Finally, 5-aza-CdR-induced p21(Waf1/Cip1) expression was dependent on DNA damage but not on DNA demethylation as demonstrated by comet assay and bisulfite sequencing, respectively. Our data provide useful clues for judging the therapeutic efficacy of 5-aza-CdR in the treatment of human cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2063448502,"Myotubularin and related proteins constitute a large and highly conserved family possessing phosphoinositide 3-phosphatase activity, although not all members possess this activity. This family contains a conserved region called the GRAM domain that is found in a variety of proteins associated with membrane-coupled processes and signal transduction. Mutations of myotubularin are found in X-linked myotubular myopathy, a severe muscle disease. Mutations in the GRAM domain are responsible for this condition, suggesting crucial roles for this region. Here, we show that the GRAM domain of myotubularin binds to phosphoinositide with the highest affinity to phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2).

Simonsen A. Stenmark H. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 249-258Google Scholar, 2Misra S. Miller G.J. Hurley J.H. Cell. 2001; 107: 559-562Google Scholar, 3Simonsen A Wurmser A. Emr S.D Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 485-492Google Scholar). Previous studies have revealed that PtdIns3P binding is essential for the recruitment/activation of these effector proteins at unique membrane sites (4Kanai F. Liu H. Field S.J. Akbary H. Matsuo T. Brown G.E. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 675-678Google Scholar, 5Cheever M.L. Sato T.K. de Beer T. Kutateladze T.G. Emr S.D. Overduin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 613-618Google Scholar). PtdIns(3,5)P2 was one of the phosphoinositide species identified recently in both yeast and mammalian cells (6Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Douglas M.R. Sayers L.G. Parker P.J. Michell R.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 187-192Google Scholar). PtdIns(3,5)P2 is thought to be involved in osmotic stress responsiveness and essential for the maintenance of vacuole size and homeostasis in yeast (7Gary J.D. Wurmser A.E. Bonangelino C.J. Weisman L.S. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 65-79Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that PtdIns(3,5)P2 is necessary for late endosomal trafficking in yeast (8Shaw J.D. Hama H. Sohrabi F. DeWald D.B. Wendland B. Traffic. 2003; 4: 479-490Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms for cellular PtdIns(3,5)P2 regulation are unknown. Intracellular levels of these phosphoinositide species are strictly regulated by enzymes that dephosphorylate at the D3-position of the inositol ring. Myotubularin and its related proteins (myotubularin-related proteins; MTMRs) constitute a large and highly conserved subfamily of dual specific phosphatases that were recently revealed to be phosphoinositide 3-phosphatases (9Blondeau F. Laporte J. Bodin S. Superti-Furga G. Payrastre B. Mandel J.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2223-2229Google Scholar, 10Taylor G.S. Maehama T. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8910-8915Google Scholar, 11Wishart M.J. Dixon J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 579-585Google Scholar). Among those proteins, myotubularin is encoded by the MTM1 gene, which is mutated in X-linked myotubular myopathy (12Laporte J. Hu L.J. Kretz C. Mandel J.L. Kioschis P. Coy J.F. Klauck S.M. Poustka A. Dahl N. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 175-182Google Scholar), whereas MTMR2 is associated with neurodegenerative disorder Charcot-Marie-tooth disease type 4B (13Bolino A. Muglia M. Conforti F.L. LeGuern E. Salih M.A. Georgiou D.M. Christodoulou K. Hausmanowa-Petrusewicz I. Mandich P. Schenone A. Gambardella A. Bono F. Quattrone A. Devoto M. Monaco A.P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 17-19Google Scholar). Myopathy patients have severe hypotonia at birth, and most of them die from hypoventilation within the first months of life (14Laporte J. Blondeau F. Buj-Bello A. Mandel J.L. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 221-228Google Scholar). This disease is characterized by the presence of disorganized skeletal muscle fibers that contain centrally located nuclei, resembling myotubes. Recent work has reported that myotubularin is essential for skeletal muscle maintenance but not for myogenesis in mice (15Buj-Bello A. Laugel V. Messaddeq N. Zahreddine H. Laporte J. Pellissier J.F. Mandel J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15060-15065Google Scholar). However, the cellular functions of myotubularin are still obscure. MTMRs also share a conserved region of about 70 amino acids, called the GRAM domain, which has also been found in glucosyltranferases, GTPase-activating proteins of the Rab small GTPases, and other adaptor proteins associated with membrane-coupled processes (16Doerks T. Strauss M. Brendel M. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 483-485Google Scholar). Some mutations in the GRAM domain of myotubularin cause X-linked myotubular myopathy, suggesting the importance of this domain (17de Gouyon B.M. Zhao W. Laporte J. Mandel J.L. Metzenberg A. Herman G.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1499-1504Google Scholar, 18Laporte J. Guiraud-Chaumeil C. Vincent M.C. Mandel J.L. Tanner S.M. Liechti-Gallati S. Wallgren-Pettersson C. Dahl N. Kress W.

Mutat. 2002; 19: 114-121Google Scholar). A very recent study reported that the GRAM domain of MTMR2 binds to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, PtdIns(3,5)P2, and PtdIns5P (20Berger P. Schaffitzel C. Berger I. Ban N. Suter U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12177-12182Google Scholar), suggesting the importance of its binding for membrane targeting of MTMR2. However, the role of phosphoinositide binding to the myotubularin GRAM domain in membrane trafficking and myotubular myopathy has not been elucidated. Here we show that the GRAM domain of myotubularin strongly binds to PtdIns(3,5)P2. This binding is abolished by point mutations found in the GRAM domain of myotubularin in myopathy patients, indicating that interaction with PtdIns (3,5)P2 is essential for full function of this phosphatase. We further demonstrate that overexpression of myotubularin inhibits epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) trafficking from the late endosome to the lysosome and induces large endosomal vacuoles. Significantly, GRAM domain mutants, as well as phosphatase inactive mutants seen in myopathy patients, do not induce these effects. Thus, our data indicate that through interaction with PtdIns(3,5)P2, myotubularin functions in late endosomal trafficking and vacuolar formation. DNA Construction—Human myotubularin-(8–112), MTMR2-(49–155), and VRP GRAM-(21–130) domains were obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR. Obtained cDNA sequences were verified and subcloned into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). Full-length cDNA of human myotubularin was obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR. After the sequence was verified, it was subcloned into pEGFP C-1 (Clontech), pCMV Myc, and pEF-Bos Myc. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by PCR with mutated primers. Myotubularin ΔGRAM was generated by deleting the first 119 amino acids of myotubularin. ELISA Lipid Binding Assay—All synthetic phosphoinositides with C16 fatty acids were purchased from Cell Signals Inc., whereas other phospholipids (PA, PC, PE, PS and PI) were obtained from Sigma. Lipid vesicles (PE/PC = 1/1; total 2 μg) containing the indicated ratio (weight percentage) of phospholipids resuspended in ethanol were coated on a 96-well microtiter plate (lmmulon 2;Dynatech) and dried at room temperature. The wells were then blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% bovine serum albumin before incubation with the respective glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins (1.0 μg/ml) for 45 min. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, bound protein was detected by reaction of the substrate, orthophenyl enediamine dihydrochloride, with glutathione conjugated to peroxidase (sigma). The colorimetric reaction was measured at 492 nm in an ELISA plate reader (Bio-Rad). Lipid Overlay Assay—PIP arrays were purchased from Echelon Bioscience Inc. In brief, arrays were incubated overnight at 4 °C with GST fusion protein (0.5 μg/ml) in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) with fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Membranes were washed and incubated with monoclonal anti-GST antibody (Sigma). After washing, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody and visualized using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) Measurement of PtdIns(3,5)P2 Levels in EGF-stimulated COS-7 Cells—COS-7 cells were cultured in serum-deprived medium for 24 h and then in orthophosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 15 min. After radiolabeling with 5 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate for 2 h, cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml human recombinant EGF (Invitrogen) for 0, 20, 40, 60, and 120 min. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and phosphoinositides were extracted with the addition of 1.5 ml of methanol followed by the same volume of chloroform:methanol (1:2, v/v). After brief sonication, the same volume of chloroform and then 1 n HCl were added. The organic phase was pooled and dried under nitrogen gas. The phosphoinositides were deacylated with methylamine reagent (10.7% methylamine, 45.7% methanol, 11.4% butanol) at 53 °C for 1 h. The samples were dried in SpeedVac and resuspended in 250 μl of sterile water. 250 μl of butanol reagent (butanol/ethyl ether/formic acid = 20/4/1, v/v/v) was added to each sample. The samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min. The aqueous phase was dried in SpeedVac, dissolved in 10 mm (NH4)2PO4, pH 3.8, and separated by high performance liquid chromatography on a Partisphere strong anion exchange column (Whatman, Clifton, NJ). The column was developed with a gradient of 1 m (NH4)2PO4, pH 3.8. The gradient started at 1% for 5 min, 1–20% over 44 min, 20–50% over 3.8 min, and remained at 50% for 8 min, and the flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. The radioactivity was quantified with a Flow Scintillation Analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Transfections—COS-7 cells were transfected by either the calcium phosphate method or Lipofectin using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) and examined 24 h after transfection. Transfected cells on coverslips were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and immunostained with various antibodies. For EGF stimulation, after starvation, cells were incubated with EGF (50 ng/ml, Invitrogen) at 37 °C for the indicated times. For treatment with wortmannin, cells were incubated with wortmannin (100 nm. Sigma) for 15 min before EGF stimulation or fixation. Coverslips were examined using confocal microscopy (Bio-Rad). In Vitro Phosphatase Assay—Phosphatase assays were carried out by FLAG-tagged myotubularin immunoprecipitated from transfected COS-7 cells. Reactions were conducted at 37 °C in a buffer (50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane), and phosphate release was quantified by using malachite green assay as described previously (33Maehama T. Tayer G.S. Slama J.T. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 175-176Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—Conventional electron microscopy was performed as described previously (34Yoshimori A. Yamamoto A Mizushima N. Kabeya Y. Nara A. Miwako I. Ohashi M. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 747-763Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-7 cells grown on plastic coverslips were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, for 2 h. After washing in the buffer, cells were post-fixed in 1% OsO4 for 60 min, washed in distilled water, incubated with 50% ethanol for 10 min, and stained with 2% uranyl acetate in 70% ethanol for 2 h. The cells were further dehydrated with a graded series of ethanol and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultra-thin sections were doubly stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The GRAM Domain Binds to PtdIns(3,5)P2—We examined the possibility that the GRAM domain of myotubularin and related proteins could bind to phosphoinositides. We used an ELISA assay where phospholipids composed of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and each phosphoinositide were coated on ELISA plates and overlaid with a GST fusion protein of interest. We first confirmed that GST alone showed no affinity to any of the phospholipids in this assay (Fig. 1a). Specific binding was observed between the PH domain of phospholipase C-δ1 and PtdIns(4,5)P2 (21Garcia P. Gupta R. Shah S. Morris A.J. Rudge S.A. Scarlata S. Petrova V. McLaughlin S. Rebecchi M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16228-16234Google Scholar, 22Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. O'Brien R. Sigler P.B. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10472-10476Google Scholar), as well as between the PH domain of Akt/PKB with PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (23James S.R. Downes C.P. Gigg R. Grove S.J. Holmes A.B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 709-713Google Scholar, 24Frech M. Andjelkovic M. Ingley E. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8474-8481Google Scholar), indicating the validity of this assay (Fig. 1a). The GRAM domain of myotubularin was found to bind to the phospholipid containing PtdIns(3,5)P2 with the highest affinity (Fig. 1a). PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2 were also favored to some degree. Furthermore, PH domains did not bind PtdIns(3,5)P2 at all in this assay, confirming that the binding detected for the GRAM domain was not an artifact. Interaction between the GRAM domain and PtdIns(3,5)P2 was also examined by overlay assay where each phosphoinositide were spotted on the membrane without any basal lipid as in the ELISA assay. Although the GRAM domain still bound strongly to PtdIns(3,5)P2, binding to other phosphoinositides was also observed (Fig. 1b). In this assay, GST alone did not bind to any phosphoinositide (Fig. 1b). We also carried out the same ELISA assay using GRAM domains from MTMR2 and VRP and found they also bound to PtdIns(3,5)P2 most strongly (Fig. 1c). Moreover, to confirm this interaction in a membranous environment, we performed a liposome binding assay. Although the GRAM domain of myotubularin, MTMR2, and VRP did not co-sediment liposomes containing PtdIns, co-sedimentation between liposomes containing PtdIns(3,5)P2 and the GRAM domain was observed (Fig. 1d). These findings indicate that the evolutionally conserved GRAM domain is designed for binding to PtdIns(3,5)P2. Among GRAM-containing proteins, myotubularin is the product of the MTM1 gene, the gene responsible for X-linked myotubular myopathy. Four cases of missense mutation in the GRAM domain (V49F, R69C, L70F, L87P) have been reported to be associated with the disease (18Laporte J. Guiraud-Chaumeil C. Vincent M.C. Mandel J.L. Tanner S.M. Liechti-Gallati S. Wallgren-Pettersson C. Dahl N. Kress W. Bolhuis P.A. Fardeau M. Samson F. Bertini E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1505-1511Google Scholar, 19Herman G.E. Kopacz K. Zhao W. Mills P.L. Metzenberg A. Das S. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 114-121Google Scholar). We generated these point mutants and compared their phosphoinositide binding abilities. As shown in Fig. 1e, the binding ability was significantly reduced for the V49F, a mutation that is associated with a more severe phenotype. Mutations of R69C, L70P, or L87P, which are associated with a milder phenotype, reduced the binding to a lesser extent. These findings suggest that phosphoinositide binding ability of the GRAM domain is crucial for functions of myotubularin in vivo. The Essential Role of the GRAM Domain Is in Translocation to the Late Endosome—Because our results redefined myotubularin as both a phosphoinositide 3-phosphatase and a PtdIns(3,5)P2-interacting protein, and because previous studies have indicated essential roles for PtdIns3P and PtdIns(3,5)P2 in endosomal trafficking (3Simonsen A Wurmser A. Emr S.D Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 485-492Google Scholar, 25Stenmark H. Gillooly D.J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 193-199Google Scholar), we next examined the possibility that myotubularin is involved in intracellular vesicular trafficking. The localization of the GFP-tagged form of myotubularin was monitored after EGF stimulation in COS-7 cells. In non-stimulated cells, EGFR retained at the plasma membrane, whereas distribution of GFP-myotubularin is mainly cytosolic (Fig. 2a). 20 min after EGF stimulation, EGFR internalization was observed by the significant co-localization with the EEA1-positive early endosome (not shown). GFP-myotubularin, however, was still distributed throughout the cytosol at this time point (Fig. 2a), indicating that myotubularin is not involved in the EGFR trafficking from the plasma membrane to the early endosome. However, after 40 min of EGF stimulation, myotubularin was observed to translocate together with the internalized EGFR (Fig. 2a) to the late endosomal compartment shown by its partial colocalization with LAMP1, a marker protein for the late endosome/lysosome (not shown). We also confirmed that cellular PtdIns(3,5)P2 levels were increased in response to EGF stimulation and peaked at 40 min after EGF stimulation (Fig. 2b), indicating the possibility that translocation of myotubularin is dependent on interactions between the GRAM domain and PtdIns(3,5)P2. Moreover, to clarify whether intracellular localization of myotubularin is affected by PtdIns(3,5)P2 in vivo, we overexpressed PIKfyve, a phosphoinositide 5-kinase shown to produce PtdIns (3,5)P2 both in vivo and in vitro (26Ikonomov O.C. Sbrissa D. Shisheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26141-26147Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2c, overexpression of PIKfyve recruited cytosolic myotubularin to the perinuclear area where they co-localized, suggesting that the localization of myotubularin is determined by PtdIns (3,5)P2. To evaluate the importance of interaction between the GRAM domain and phosphoinositides, we further examined the effect of mutations in myotubularin on its translocation. Importantly, myotubularin ΔGRAM in which the whole GRAM domain is deleted did not translocate to the late endosomal compartment after EGF treatment (Fig. 2d). The same result was observed with myotubularin V49F, in which the mutated GRAM domain was unable to bind PtdIns(3,5)P2 (Fig. 2d). This indicates that the lack of PtdIns(3,5)P2 binding ability by a point mutation is comparable with the loss of the entire GRAM domain. Moreover, cell pretreatment with the PI3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin prevented the recruitment of myotubularin to this compartment subsequent to EGF stimulation (Fig. 2e), supporting the idea that the myotubularin translocation is dependent on a D3-phosphoinositide. Myotubularin Negatively Regulates EGFR Degradation— The translocation of myotubularin to the EGFR-positive late endosomal compartment suggested its roles in the degradation pathway of EGFR. To assess the effect of myotubularin on EGFR trafficking, we overexpressed myotubularin in COS-7 cells with the pEF-Bos vector that carries a powerful promoter derived from the upstream region of the gene for the transcription factor EF-1α (27Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Google Scholar). In myotubularin-overexpressing cells, EGFR displayed significant co-localization with the EEA1-positive early endosome 20 min after EGF stimulation (data not shown), indicating that myotubularin does not affect EGFR trafficking from the plasma membrane to the early endosome. At 180 min after EGF stimulation, EGFR was degraded in the lysosome in non-expressing cells as the red spots disappeared (Fig. 3a, arrows). However, EGFR still remained undegraded in cells that overexpressed myotubularin (Fig. 3, a and b), suggesting a negative regulation of EGFR degradation. Importantly, this effect requires the 3-phosphatase activity of myotubularin since the phosphatase-negative mutant G378R (10Taylor G.S. Maehama T. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8910-8915Google Scholar) did not affect the EGFR degradation. Furthermore, the GRAM-domain mutant (V49F) showed normal degradation seen in surrounding non-expressing cells (Fig. 3, a and b). We also confirmed that myotubularin negatively regulates EGFR degradation using Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3c, degradation of EGFR was suppressed in myotubularin WT-expressing cells as compared with V49F-or G378R-expressing cells. These data strongly indicate that myotubularin 3-phosphatase functions as a negative regulator of EGFR trafficking from the late endosome to the lysosome for degradation and that phosphoinositide binding through the GRAM domain is required for the function of myotubularin in vivo. Myotubularin Regulates Vacuolar Formation—In non-overexpressing cells, the EGF-EGFR complex seemed to have been sorted into the lumen of the late endosomes, forming the multivesicular bodies (28Futter C.E. Pearse A. Hewlett L.J. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1011-1023Google Scholar). We found that myotubularin overexpression induced abnormal, large vacuolar vesicles in about 40% of transfected cells and that EGFRs were retained at the limiting membranes on large vacuoles (Fig. 4a). Electron microscopy analysis showed that these large vacuoles include comparatively few internal vesicles as compared with vacuoles of control cells. (Fig. 4b). These observations suggest that induction of enlarged vacuoles by myotubularin might be due to inhibition of vacuolar membrane recycling or a defect of invagination on limiting membranes. More importantly, we found that overexpression of myotubularin V49F did not cause strong formation of the large vacuole. (Fig. 4, a and c). The vacuolation phenotype was not so marked in cells expressing the phosphatase-negative mutant G378R (Fig. 4, a and c), suggesting the importance of dephosphorylation of phosphoinositide substrates for the effect. We found that myotubularin could dephosphorylate PtdIns(3,5)P2 (apparent Km value of PtdIns(3,5)P2 = 17 μm) as well as PtdIns3P (Km = 39 μm) (not shown). Dephosphorylation of PtdIns(3,5)P2 by myotubularin was described recently (29Schaletzky J. Dove S.K. Short B. Lorenzo O. Clague M.J. Barr F.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 504-509Google Scholar). These findings suggest that myotubularin translocates to the PtdIns(3,5)P2-rich membrane via its GRAM domain and effectively dephosphorylates PtdIns(3,5)P2 on the limiting membrane of the late endosomal compartments to negatively regulate the vacuolar formation. Our findings that the GRAM domain of myotubularin bind PtdIns(3,5)P2 with high affinity and specificity are consistent with the notion that the GRAM domain of myotubularin 3-phosphatase family functions to bind their substrate PtdIns(3,5)P2, facilitating the dephosphorylation of the phosphoinositide. Moreover, point mutations in the GRAM domain, reported in severe cases, eliminate this binding, indicating that GRAM-PtdIns(3,5)P2 interaction is crucial for functions of myotubularin in vivo. In yeast, the formation of PtdIns(3,5)P2 from PtdIns3P is catalyzed by Fab1p, a PtdIns3P-5-kinase necessary for maintenance of normal vacuolar morphology and functions (7Gary J.D. Wurmser A.E. Bonangelino C.J. Weisman L.S. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 65-79Google Scholar). Fab1P as well as PIKfyve, a mammalian homologue of Fab1p, are reported to localize to late endosome/multivesicular bodies (30Shisheva A. Rusin B. Ikonomov O.C. DeMarco C. Sbrissa D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11859-11869Google Scholar), suggesting that localization of PtdIns(3,5)P2 may also be to this compartment. According to this hypothesis, myotubularin probably localizes to the late endosome via interaction with PtdIns(3,5)P2. In addition, recent studies have revealed that PIKfyve suppressed the vacuolar enlargement in mammalian cells, indicating that it functions to maintain the proper size of vacuolar organelles (31Ikonomov O.C. Sbrissa D. Yoshimori T. Cover T.L. Shisheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46785-46790Google Scholar). Thus, our data strongly suggest that myotubularin physiologically functions in the late endosomal trafficking and vacuolar morphology by controlling PtdIns(3,5)P2 and show the indispensable roles of the GRAM domain in its cellular functions. Recently, Ent3p, a yeast epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) domain-containing protein, has been found to bind PtdIns(3,5)P2 through its ENTH domain and function in the late endosome (32Friant S. Pecheur E.I. Eugster A. Michel F. Lefkir Y. Nourrisson D. Letourneur F. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 499-511Google Scholar), indicating that this lipid plays important roles in sorting of membrane proteins at late endosomal compartment throughout yeast to mammals. However, the precise mechanism of how PtdIns(3,5)P2 regulates sorting of membrane proteins remains to be solved in future."
https://openalex.org/W1986301747,"Small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are molecular chaperones that efficiently bind non-native proteins. All members of this family investigated so far are oligomeric complexes. For Hsp26, an sHsp from the cytosol of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it has been shown that at elevated temperatures the 24-subunit complex dissociates into dimers. This dissociation seems to be required for the efficient interaction with unfolding proteins that results in the formation of large, regular complexes comprising Hsp26 and the non-native proteins. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism of this chaperone, we analyzed the dynamics and stability of the two oligomeric forms of Hsp 26 (i.e. the 24-mer and the dimer) in comparison to a construct lacking the N-terminal domain (Hsp26ΔN). Furthermore, we determined the stabilities of complexes between Hsp26 and non-native proteins. We show that the temperature-induced dissociation of Hsp26 into dimers is a completely reversible process that involves only a small change in energy. The unfolding of the dissociated Hsp26 dimer or Hsp26ΔN, which is a dimer, requires a much higher energy. Because Hsp26ΔN was inactive as a chaperone, these results imply that the N-terminal domain is of critical importance for both the association of Hsp26 with non-native proteins and the formation of large oligomeric complexes. Interestingly, complexes of Hsp26 with non-native proteins are significantly stabilized against dissociation compared with Hsp26 complexes. Taken together, our findings suggest that the quaternary structure of Hsp26 is determined by two elements, (i) weak, regulatory interactions required to form the shell of 24 subunits and (ii) a strong and stable dimerization of the C-terminal domain.

Molecular chaperones are a functionally related set of proteins whose basic property is to selectively recognize non-native proteins (1Walter S. Buchner J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2002; 41: 1098-1113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, members of the groups of small heat shock proteins (sHsps) 1The abbreviations used are: sHsp, small heat shock protein; Hsp26, sHsp from S. cerevisiae; Hsp25, sHsp from mouse; CD, circular dichroism, CS, citrate synthase; SEC, size exclusion chromatography. exhibit an astounding binding capacity for unfolded polypeptides (2Haslbeck M.

Biol. 1993; 3: 234-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). sHsps have been found in almost all organisms studied (8Narberhaus F. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 64-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Often, several members of this family are present in one cellular compartment, suggesting functional diversification (9Vierling E. Harris L.M. Chen Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 10Arrigo A.P. Pathol. Biol. 2000; 48: 280-288PubMed Google Scholar). sHsps are characterized by a conserved C-terminal α-crystallin domain and subunit masses between 15 and 40 kDa (2Haslbeck M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1649-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 3Kappe G. Leunissen J.A.M. de Jong W.W. Prog. Mol. Subcell.

This implies that the N-terminal parts are heterogeneous in size and sequence. A hallmark of sHsps is their tendency to assemble into large oligomeric complexes containing 9 to 24 monomers (11Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, 12Haley D. Horwitz J. Stewart P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 227: 27-35Crossref Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 13Haslbeck M. Walke S.

There is ample evidence that oligomerization is a structural prerequisite for chaperone activity of the majority of sHsps (15Kokke B.P. Leroux M.R. Candido E.P. Boelens W.C. De Jong W.W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 16Leroux M.R. Melki R. Gordon B. Batelier G. Candido E.P. J. Biol.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 1014-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the correlation between structure and chaperone function in detail. Some sHsps form assemblies with well-defined stoichiometries such as those from plants (14van Montfort R.L. Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), whereas other sHsps, including the mammalian proteins, form a range of oligomeric sizes (12Haley D. Horwitz J. Stewart P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 227: 27-35Crossref Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 18Haley D.A. Bova M.P. Huang Q.L. Mchaourab H.S. Stewart P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This polydispersity has limited the amount of structural information available. Two x-ray structures have been reported thus far for the hyperthermophilic archaeon Methanococcus janaschii Hsp16.5 (11Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar) and for Hsp16.9 from wheat (14van Montfort R.L. Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The latter is composed of 12 subunits arranged into two hexameric rings. MjHsp16.5 forms a hollow spherical complex of 24 subunits of octahedral symmetry with an inner diameter of 6.5 nm. In both structures, the α-crystallin domains form a dimeric building block with similar fold (4Horwitz J. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 76: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 11Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, 14van Montfort R.L. Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The dynamic exchange of subunits of the oligomeric complexes seems to be a common theme for sHsps (8Narberhaus F. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 64-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 19Bova M.P. Huang Q. Ding L. Horwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38468-38475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The functional importance is not clear at present. An extreme case in this context is the sHsp Hsp26. Hsp26 is a cytosolic protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae that exists as a hollow shell of 24 subunits under physiological conditions (20Bentley N.J. Fitch I.T. Tuite M.F. Yeast. 1992; 8: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 13Haslbeck M. Walke S. Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. White H.E. Chen S. Saibil H.R. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). It has been shown to act as a chaperone and bind non-native proteins in a cooperative manner. Assays performed at different temperatures suggest that for efficient chaperone activity, the shell-like structure has to dissociate (13Haslbeck M. Walke S. Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. White H.E. Chen S. Saibil H.R. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). This is achieved at heat shock temperatures (e.g. 43 °C). Here, the complex dissociates to a defined, dimeric species that binds non-native protein and then associates to large, homogeneous substrate·chaperone complexes. Electron microscopy revealed that this complex has a novel structure that is not based on the original shell-like structure of the Hsp26 oligomer (13Haslbeck M. Walke S. Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. White H.E. Chen S. Saibil H.R. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). A comparison of Hsp26 with Hsp25, a cytosolic sHsps from mouse, concerning the interaction with non-native proteins showed that the general chaperone properties are conserved although the mechanisms of activation are completely different (21Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. Gaestel M. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18015-18021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, Hsp26 requires dissociation for activation, whereas Hsp25 did not show any detectable dissociation. Nevertheless, the resulting complexes of non-native protein and sHsps are surprisingly similar in shape and size for a given non-native protein. To gain further insight into the mechanism of Hsp26, we analyzed the association and dissociation reactions of Hsp26 and a variant lacking the N-terminal domain. We show that the quaternary structure of Hsp26 is regulated by two elements, a weak association of the 24-mer complex and a stable interaction of the dimeric building blocks. Materials—Bovine serum albumin was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Bovine insulin and bovine Rhodanese were from Sigma. Insulin was stored in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 6.5, and Rhodanese in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm dithioerythritol, 50 mm sodium thiosulfate, pH 7.7. All protein concentrations in the text refer to monomers. Expression and Purification of CS—Mitochondrial citrate synthase (CS) from pig heart (EC 4.1.3.7) was purified as described elsewhere (22Haslbeck M. Schuster I. Grallert H. J. Chromatogr. B Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2003; 786: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). CS was stored in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. Expression and Purification of Hsp26 —The Hsp26-overexpressing yeast strain was a kind gift from Dr. S. Lindquist (Whitehead Institute, Boston, MA). Hsp26 was expressed and purified according to Haslbeck et al. (13Haslbeck M. Walke S. Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. White H.E. Chen S. Saibil H.R. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Hsp26 was stored in 40 mm Hepes/KOH, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithioerythritol, pH 7.5. Expression and Purification of Hsp26ΔN—HSP26ΔN was amplified from genomic yeast DNA via PCR with the primer pair TGACCATATGATTTTGGACCATGACAACAACTA, TGACGGATCCTTAGTTACCCCACGATTCTTGA and cloned into pET28b (Novagen, Madison, WI), generating an N-terminal His6 tag. The calculated molecular mass of Hsp26ΔN is 15,281 Da. Hsp26ΔN was expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Cells were grown in Luria Bertani to A600 of 2.5 and induced with 2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG). After 3.5 h, cells were harvested, washed once with buffer A (40 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.5) and lysed with a BasicZ cell disrupter (Constant Systems, Warwick, UK). The cell lysate was centrifuged (46,000 × g, 45 min, 4 °C), and the soluble extract was applied to a 10-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid fast flow column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) equilibrated in buffer A and eluted with a linear gradient of 10–300 mm imidazol. Hsp26ΔN-containing fractions were pooled and further purified on a 26/10 Superdex 75-pg gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences). After dialysis against buffer B (40 mm HEPES/KOH, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), the protein was loaded on a 6-ml Resource Q ion-exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a linear gradient from 50–500 mm NaCl. Hsp26ΔN-containing fractions were pooled, dialyzed against buffer B, and concentrated by ultrafiltration. Hsp26ΔN was stored in 40 mm Hepes/KOH, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. The correct size of Hsp26ΔN was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. Circular Dichroism Measurements—Far-UV-circular dichroism (CD) measurements were performed in a J-715 spectropolarimeter with a PTC343 peltier unit (Jasco, Grossumstadt, Germany). The proteins were dialyzed overnight against 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. If not indicated otherwise, spectra were recorded from 250–190 nm at a constant temperature of 20 °C in 0.1-cm quartz cuvettes. All spectra are base line-corrected, and molecular ellipticities were calculated according to the corresponding mean residue weight. The secondary structure of the respective proteins was calculated using the CD spectra deconvolution software CDNN (www.bioinformatik.biochemtech.uni-halle.de). To monitor differences in the chemical stability of Hsp26 and Hsp26ΔN, urea unfolding transitions were performed. 0.25 mg/ml of the respective protein were incubated for 20 h at 25 °C in 40 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5, containing different urea concentrations. For urea transitions at 43 °C, proteins were additionally incubated at 43 °C for 6 h. To monitor the thermal unfolding transition of Hsp26 and Hsp26ΔN, the proteins were incubated in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, in 1-mm cuvettes at a concentration of 0.3 mg/ml. The heating rate was 30°/h, and the ellipticity at 220 nm was recorded. The unfolding transitions were analyzed according to Pace and Scholtz (23Pace C.N. Scholtz M. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1997: 299-321Google Scholar) using the Scientist software (Micromath). Aggregation Assays—To induce aggregation, CS was diluted in 40 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5, and equilibrated at 43 °C (24Buchner J. Grallert H. Jakob U. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 323-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Rhodanese (30 μm) was diluted 1:100 into 40 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.7, at 44 °C (25Mendoza J.A. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17631-17634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assays were performed in the presence and absence of Hsp26 or Hsp26ΔN. Assays in the presence of bovine serum albumin served as a control for unspecific protein effects (concentrations given in the figure legends). To monitor the kinetics of thermal aggregation in the presence of Hsp26 and Hsp26ΔN, light scattering was measured in a FluoroMax I (Spex, Edison, NJ) fluorescence spectrophotometer in stirred and thermostatted quartz cells. During the measurements, both the excitation and emission wavelength were set to 360 nm with a spectral bandwidth of 4 nm. Size Exclusion Chromatography—To analyze the stability of Hsp26·substrate complexes, size exclusion HPLC (SEC) was performed using a TosoHaas TSK3000PW column (30 cm × 0.75 cm; separation range 0.5–800 kDa). Chromatography was carried out at 25 or 43 °C in 0.1 m Hepes/KOH, 150 mm KCl, pH 8.0, with a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min. The sample volume was 100 μl. Hsp26 was detected by fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm and an emission wavelength of 323 nm using a Jasco FP 920 fluorescence detector (Jasco). To analyze the stability of the Hsp26 oligomer in contrast to Hsp26·substrate complexes at different urea concentrations, Hsp26 alone, Hsp26·CS or Hsp26·Rhodanese complexes were incubated at increasing urea concentrations (0–3 m) as described in the figure legends and separated by SEC at the respective urea concentration with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. To analyze the dissociation further, the peak area of the complex in the absence of urea was determined using the Sigma Plot software and set to 100%. The peak areas in the presence of urea are expressed in comparison to the value obtained in the absence of urea. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Determination of the native molecular weight of Hsp26ΔN was performed using a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge and a Beckman Ti-60 rotor equipped with a UV/Vis and an interference detection unit. Centrifugation was performed at 4 °C and 22,500 rpm until the sedimentation equilibrium was reached. Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) were added to avoid proteolytic degradation. Protein concentrations were varied between 0.2 mg/ml and 0.8 mg/ml in a buffer containing 40 mm Hepes/KOH, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. Data analysis followed the one-species model included in the Origin software package, available from Beckman. As shown in Equation 1, c=c0·ω2e2·R·T(1-v¯·ρ)M1,000,000(r2-r02)+baseline(Eq. 1) where c0 equals the signal at the reference radius ro, ω is the angular velocity, R the gas constant, T the temperature in Kelvin, and M the molecular mass. ρ was assumed to be ρ = 1,015 g/ml, and the specific volume of the protein was 0.74 ml/g. The fit of c (detection signal) against r (rotation radius) resulted in values for the molecular mass M that were found to be independent of the detection system used. Generally the fits agreed very well with the one-species model. Structural and Functional Analysis of Hsp26 and Its Isolated C-terminal Domain Hsp26ΔN—Hsp26 forms a globular complex of 24 identical subunits under physiological conditions. At higher temperatures, the complex dissociates to dimers and becomes active as a chaperone (13Haslbeck M. Walke S. Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. White H.E. Chen S. Saibil H.R. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). This would imply that the organization of the quaternary structure involves at least two elements, an association site for the dimer that is the basic building block of the active species and an independent association site for the formation of large oligomers. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we created a fragment of Hsp26 comprising the C-terminal-conserved α-crystallin domain, Hsp26ΔN (Fig. 1) with a view to compare its structure and stability to that of the full-length protein. Hsp26ΔN was produced in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. The analysis of the secondary structure of this fragment by CD spectroscopy showed a minimum at 204 nm with an ellipticity of –8,500 θ (Fig. 2A). In comparison, the minimum of Hsp26 is at 216 nm and 8,000 θ. The analysis of the secondary structure elements indicated for both proteins a large amount of β-sheet structure (around 45%) and a low α-helix content (18 and 12% for Hsp26 and Hsp26ΔN, respectively). This is consistent with the notion that the C-terminal α-crystallin domain is predominantly a β-sheet structure (27Dudich I.V. Zav'yalov V.P. Pfeil W. Gaestel M. Zav'yalova G.A. Denesyuk A.I. Korpela T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1253: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), whereas the N-terminal domain contains α-helical elements. To determine the quaternary structure of Hsp26ΔN, analytical ultracentrifugation was employed. The equilibrium sedimentation analysis of Hsp26ΔN resulted in a native molecular mass of 27,500 ± 1,500 Da, indicating that the fragment represents a dimer (Fig. 2B). We had shown previously that Hsp26 efficiently prevents the aggregation of CS at 43 °C (13Haslbeck M. Walke S. Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. White H.E. Chen S. Saibil H.R. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 21Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. Gaestel M. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18015-18021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar and Fig. 2C). Next, we were interested whether Hsp26ΔN exhibits chaperone activity, using CS as a model substrate. Hsp26ΔN, however, did not show any influence on CS aggregation even when added at a 30-fold excess (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, again in contrast to the full-length protein, complexes between the Hsp26ΔN and CS could not be detected by SEC or electron microscopy (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that although Hsp26ΔN is in the same oligomeric state as the dissociated full-length Hsp26, it is not able to perform detectable chaperone function. Stability of Hsp26 and Hsp26ΔN—To analyze the intrinsic stability of full-length Hsp26 and Hsp26ΔN, we performed thermal unfolding experiments monitored by CD spectroscopy (Fig. 3). The CD spectra recorded at different temperatures showed that at 43 °C Hsp26 exhibits a spectrum significantly different from that recorded at 25 °C (Fig. 3A). The amplitude between 235 and 210 nm decreased, and the shape of the spectrum changed. For Hsp26ΔN, the spectra recorded at 25 and 43 °C are essentially identical (Fig. 3B). For both proteins the spectra at 80 °C are very similar (Fig. 3, A and B). They indicate a loss of structure although the proteins did not seem to be completely unfolded. There was no visible aggregation, but unfolding at 80 °C was irreversible (see below). To determine the temperature transition of the proteins, the samples were heated at a constant rate and the signal at 220 nm was recorded (Fig. 3C). For Hsp26, two unfolding transitions could be detected. The first transition started at 29 °C and had a midpoint at 35 °C. The temperature range in which this transition occurred corresponds to that required for dissociation of the large oligomer. Above 43 °C, the signal reached a plateau until 70 °C. The second transition was between 70 and 80 °C with a midpoint at 77 °C. The analysis of the first transition of Hsp26 resulted in a stabilization energy at 25 °C of 4.3 ± 0.6 kJ/mol. Because the thermal transition observed above 70 °C was irreversible, no quantitative analysis was performed for this unfolding process. For Hsp26ΔN, a completely different picture emerged (Fig. 3C). The transition in the heat shock region was absent. Only one transition in the high temperature range, 55–80 °C, with a midpoint of 70 °C was observed. Here again thermal unfolding proved to be irreversible (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these experiments suggest that structural changes in the heat shock temperature range that are absent in Hsp26ΔN are associated with the N-terminal domain. Hsp26ΔN reveals a remarkable stability against thermal unfolding that corresponds to the second transition of full-length Hsp26. Next, we analyzed the stability of Hsp26 and Hsp26ΔN against unfolding by urea (Fig. 4). When the unfolding transitions were monitored by CD spectroscopy at 25 °C, Hsp26 exhibited two unfolding transitions (Fig. 4A). The first started at the lowest urea concentration tested and exhibited a midpoint at 0.4 m urea. The second transition was from 3 to 6 m urea and had a midpoint at 4.2 m urea. Hsp26ΔN, in contrast, showed only one transition between 3 and 6 m urea, with a midpoint at 4.2 m urea (Fig. 4A). In contrast to the heat-induced unfolding, the urea-induced unfolding was completely reversible. A quantitative analysis to determine the corresponding stabilization energies resulted in values of 5.5 ± 1.1 kJ/mol and 13.3 ± 1.5 kJ/mol for the first and second transition of Hsp26, respectively, and 11.4 ± 1.2 kJ/mol for the single transition of Hsp26ΔN. The values of the stabilization energies for Hsp26ΔN and the second transition of Hsp26 indicate that the observed structural changes of the proteins are similar. To confirm this with a second set of experiments, we determined the stability of the two proteins at 43 °C, where both are in their dimeric forms (Fig. 4B). Again, the urea-induced unfolding at 43 °C of both proteins was completely reversible. Here, the transition of Hsp26ΔN is almost identical to the transition at 25 °C, resulting in stabilization energies of 14.9 ± 2.5 kJ/mol. In contrast, the unfolding of Hsp26 changed dramatically between 25 and 43 °C. Although the first transition was completely absent, the second transition occurred still at about 4 m with a stabilization energy of 19.8 ± 2.9 kJ/mol, which is even slightly more stable than the corresponding transition at 25 °C. Thus the urea-induced unfolding transitions confirmed that the unfolding process of Hsp26 is a two-step process at room temperature and a one-step process at heat shock temperatures. Furthermore, the experiments showed that the stability of Hsp26ΔN corresponds to that of the dissociated species of Hsp26 at 43 °C. Stability of Hsp26·Substrate Complexes—A striking feature of the chaperone mechanism of Hsp26 is its ability to form large, well-defined complexes with substrates (13Haslbeck M. Walke S. Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. White H.E. Chen S. Saibil H.R. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 21Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. Gaestel M. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18015-18021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Analysis of electron micrographs suggested that the structural organization of the substrate complexes is different from that of the Hsp26 24-mers. The finding that substrate complexes can be isolated by SEC already suggested a stable interaction (13Haslbeck M. Walke S. Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. White H.E. Chen S. Saibil H.R. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 21Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. Gaestel M. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18015-18021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In the context of this study, we were interested to compare the stability of the substrate complexes with that of the native Hsp26 complex. To this end, we incubated the Hsp26 complex or the Hsp26·substrate complex with increasing concentrations of urea and analyzed the complex by SEC. The column was pre-equilibrated at the respective urea concentrations of the samples. The analysis of the Hsp26 complex showed that it already started to dissociate at low urea concentrations, consistent with the results obtained for the unfolding transitions monitored by CD spectroscopy (Fig 5, A and B and compare Fig. 4A). The remaining complex peak did not change its elution behavior. Dissociation was complete at urea concentrations higher than 0.5 m. In the absence of urea, the Hsp26·substrate complexes eluted at the position expected (21Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. Gaestel M. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18015-18021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). When the samples were incubated in the presence of urea, a decrease in the fluorescence intensity of this peak was observed; concomitantly, peaks at the positions of the components of the substrate complex appeared. No intermediate-sized peaks were observed. This behavior allows determination of the stability of the complex by plotting the fluorescence signal of the substrate complex versus urea concentration. For the Hsp26·CS complex, dissociation started at the lowest urea concentration used (Fig. 5, A and C). At 0.5 m urea, however, 20% of substrate complexes were still present. To dissociate the complexes completely, 2 m urea were required. To test whether the stabilization of the Hsp26·substrate complex compared with the Hsp26 complex is a specific property of the CS complex, we performed the experiment with Rhodanese, another protein that had been shown previously to form well-defined complexes with Hsp26 (21Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. Gaestel M. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18015-18021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The stabilization of this complex was even more dramatic than that of the Hsp26·CS complex (Fig. 5, A and D). Up to 0.5 m urea, 90% of the substrate complexes were stable. At higher urea concentrations, the amount of complexes decreased slightly. However, at 2 m urea, 65% of complexes could still be detected. Thus, the complex between substrate protein and Hsp26 is intrinsically more stable than the Hsp26 complex. sHsps differ from other molecular chaperones in several aspects. The most important are the efficient binding of several non-native polypeptide chains in one chaperone complex and the dynamics of the quaternary structure (3Kappe G. Leunissen J.A.M. de Jong W.W. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2002; 28: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 8Narberhaus F. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 64-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). A key feature of Hsp26 is the existence of two distinct and well-defined oligomeric states. The 24-mer is a globular sphere that exists at physiological temperatures and is largely inactive as a chaperone (13Haslbeck M. Walke S. Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. White H.E. Chen S. Saibil H.R. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The dimer is the stable structure at higher temperature. The interconversion between the two species is completely reversible. For other sHsps, a defined transition between two oligomeric states has not been observed yet. However, in many cases the large oligomer exhibited unusual dynamic properties that seem to allow the association and dissociation of single subunits without apparent changes in the size of the oligomer. This has been demonstrated for α-crystallin, several sHsps from Bradyrhizobium japanoicum, PsHsp18.1 and TaHsp16.9 from plants, and Hsp16.5 from M. janaschii (28Studer S. Narberhaus F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37212-37218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 14van Montfort R.L. Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct.

It is therefore reasonable to assume that this dynamic behavior is generally required for the chaperone function of sHsps. Which domains are involved in these processes is not clear yet (16Leroux M.R. Melki R. Gordon B. Batelier G. Candido E.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 12024-12029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To analyze which parts of Hsp26 are responsible for association and chaperone activity, we created a variant consisting of the α-crystallin domain of Hsp26 and the C-terminal extension. This construct turned out to be dimeric and lacks chaperone activity. Therefore it can be concluded that regions that are both important for the assembly of the 24-mer and for the interaction with non-native proteins reside in the N-terminal part of the protein. This view is supported by thermal unfolding experiments that show that full-length Hsp26 exhibits two transitions, one in the heat shock temperature range and one at much higher temperatures. Only the high temperature transition is observed in the case of Hsp26ΔN. Furthermore, these results suggest that less energy is required for the dissociation of the 24-mer than for the dissociation and unfolding of the dimer. Quantitative data for the changes in energy involved in these processes were obtained by analyzing urea-induced unfolding transitions at 25 and 43 °C. These data are in agreement with the thermal unfolding transitions and support the hypothesis of a thermolabile oligomeric assembly of Hsp26 that dissociates to stable dimers at elevated temperatures. For Hsp26ΔN, this transition was not observed, suggesting that the N-terminal domains of Hsp26 are involved in these processes. Thus, there are two contributions to the quaternary structure of Hsp26: the 24-mer as a regulatory component that allows changing the activity by dissociation and the dimer as a basic building block of high stability. In summary, the following picture emerges for the structural organization of Hsp26 (Fig. 6). The stability of the dimeric species (Hsp26ΔN and Hsp26 after dissociation) is not influenced significantly by temperature shifts between 25 and 43 °C. This is deduced from the basically identical urea transitions for the unfolding of the dimer at these temperatures. In strong contrast, the energy of the oligomer is very sensitive to temperature, as can be seen from the dissociation of the oligomer at higher temperatures and the lack of the first phase of the urea transition at 43 °C. Because the first transition was found to be reversible in all cases, we performed quantitative analysis and obtained a stabilization energy of the oligomer at 25 °C of about 5 kJ/mol. The strong dependence of the reaction pathway on temperature for the interconversion of dimeric and oligomeric species and the observed dissociation of oligomeric species at higher temperatures suggest that the primary driving force for the dissociation of the oligomeric complexes may be of entropic nature, i.e. a gain of entropy during formation of dimers, potentially because the N-terminal domains become unstructured. In principle, complexes of Hsp26 with non-native proteins can be regarded as a third oligomeric species of Hsp26. We had shown previously that the morphology of these complexes depends on the nature of the non-native protein incorporated in the complex (21Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. Gaestel M. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18015-18021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We assume that parts of Hsp26 that, at lower temperature, are involved in contacts stabilizing the 24-mer participate in the interaction with non-native protein at higher temperature in a way that allows cooperative binding of unfolding proteins and the formation of regular complexes. In the presence of urea, the sHsp·substrate complexes also appear to dissociate in a cooperative reaction because no intermediate-sized species were detected. Surprisingly, the stability of the complexes between Hsp26 and non-native CS or Rhodanese was found to be much higher than that of the Hsp26 complex alone. The stability seems to depend on the non-native protein bound in the complex, suggesting that the affinity of Hsp26 for a given protein is a decisive factor in this context. Substrate recognition of sHsps may involve charged and hydrophobic amino acids (5Van Montfort R. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Adv. Protein. Chem. 2001; 59: 105-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 14van Montfort R.L. Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Taken together, our data suggest that in the case of Hsp26, the N-terminal domain is of critical importance both for the assembly of the 24-mer from dimers and for the interaction with non-native proteins, including the formation of the chaperone·substrate complex. It is tempting to speculate that some of the weak interactions between the dimers in the Hsp26 complex are replaced by stronger chaperone-substrate interactions. How exactly this results in the cooperative formation of defined complexes remains to be seen. We thank Anja Osterauer, Katrin Suttner, Florian Manzenrieder, and Alexander Ehrmann for excellent experimental help."

In order to understand the mechanisms underlying the antiestrogenic effect of this prototype SERM, we performed an analysis of the cofactors that interact with ER complexed with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT) at natural target genes in a human breast tumor cell line MCF-7. Employing chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we observed that treatment with OHT rapidly induces the binding of ERα to the E-responsive promoter regions of pS2 and c-myc genes. Promoter-bound OHT-complexed ERa coordinately recruited the components of a multiprotein complex containing the corepressor NCoR, histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), and a WD40-repeat protein TBL1. Surprisingly, the OHT-complexed ERα also recruited a chromatin-remodeling NuRD complex in which histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) is associated with several polypeptides including metastasis-associated protein 1/2 (MTA1/2), and SWI2/SNF2-related ATPase Mi2. Kinetic studies revealed that following OHT addition the recruitment of these HDAC complexes to pS2 or the c-myc promoter occurs in a sequential manner; the NCoR-HDAC3 complex is recruited earlier than the NuRD complex. Serial ChIP experiments indicated that the ER-NCoR-HDAC3 and ER-NuRD complexes are distinct, and they do not occupy the target gene promoter simultaneously. We also established a close temporal link between the appearance of the HDAC complexes at the E-responsive regions of pS2 and c-myc promoters, local hypoacetylation of specific lysine residues in N-terminal tails of histones H3 and H4, and disappearance of RNA polymerase II from the target gene loci.

Certain of these coactivator complexes contain histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and/or methyltransferase activities, suggesting that they might covalently modify histones, leading to alterations in chromatin organization and structure (9Glass C.K.

The recruitment of a coactivator complex containing HAT activity by a promoter-bound steroid receptor is thought to lead to local hyperacetylation of lysine-rich tails of histones H3 and H4, which may decondense nucleosomes and facilitate the binding of transcription factors to the underlying DNA regulatory elements, leading to gene activation (9Glass C.K.

These findings raised the possibility that recruitment of a corepressor complex by a promoter-bound tamoxifen-complexed ER may induce local hypoacetylation of H3 and H4 to create a repressive chromatin conformation, leading to gene repression. Little, however, is known about the nature of the corepressor complex recruited by tamoxifen-bound ER at an E-responsive promoter in vivo to suppress gene transcription. In the present study, we embarked on an analysis of the nature of the corepressor complexes recruited by tamoxifen-complexed ER at the promoters of E-responsive genes, pS2 and c-myc, in human breast cancer cells. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we found that tamoxifen-bound ER sequentially recruits two distinct multiprotein complexes harboring histone deacetylase activities to the target promoter. Most importantly, during tamoxifen-induced suppression of ER-mediated gene transcription, the time course of recruitment of the HDAC complexes precisely coincided with that of deacetylation of histone H3 and H4 tails at the target promoters, providing critical support for the hypothesis that tamoxifen functions as an antagonist in the breast cells by inducing chromatin modification. Reagents—17β-Estradiol and progesterone were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. 4-Hydroxytamoxifen was purchased from Tocris-Cookson, Ellisville, MO. Cell Culture—MCF-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA). Before each experiment involving treatment with E or OHT, cells were grown for 3–4 days in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% dextran charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed essentially as described previously with minor modifications (16Shang Y. Brown M. Science. 2002; 295: 2465-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar, 18Shang Y. Hu X. Direnzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar). The estrogen receptor responsive regions of pS2 (-529 to -262), and c-myc (-62 to +185) were amplified by PCR. The amplified products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis using ethidium bromide staining and visualized in a KODAK Image Station 440CF. Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against ERα, Sin3A, Mi2, MTA1, and TBL-1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. The anti-HDAC1 antibody was raised against a synthetic peptide KEEKPEAKGVKEEVKLA corresponding to the C-terminal region 466–482 of human HDAC1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Rabbit anti-HDAC3 antibody was directed against a synthetic peptide NEFYDGDHDNDKESDVEI corresponding to the C-terminal region 411–428 of human HDAC3. Each antibody was specific for its antigen and did not show any cross-reactivity with other HDACs in Western blot experiments. Anti-acetyl histone H4, anti-acetyl histone H3 (Lys-9 and Lys-14), and anti-acetyl histone H3 (Lys-14) were purchased from Upstate USA, Inc., Charlottesville, VA. RNA polymerase II antibody was obtained from Covance, Berkeley, CA. Rabbit anti-NCoR antibody was raised against C-terminal amino acids 2057–2453 of murine NCoR fused to GST (15Zhang X Jeyakumar M. Petukhov S. Bagchi M.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 513-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Serial ChIP—Following primary immunoprecipitation, the cross-linked complexes were eluted from the immunoprecipitate by incubation with an elution buffer (1% SDS, 50 mm NaHCO3) at room temperature for 30 min, and then diluted 1:20 in Re-IP dilution buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm TrisCl, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) followed by reimmunoprecipitation with a second set of antibodies. Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—Total RNA was isolated from MCF-7 cells treated with either 17-β-estradiol or 4-hydroxytamoxifen using Trizol Reagent (Sigma). RNA (10 ug) was reverse-transcribed using ProSTAR™ First-Strand RT-PCR Kit (Stratagene). 10% of the RT product was amplified by PCR. The PCR fragments amplified were: 75–439 of pS2 mRNA, 965–1633 of c-Myc mRNA, and 509–780 of human acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein 36B4 mRNA. Treatment with OHT Induces Recruitment of ERα and NCoR to E-responsive Promoters—Tamoxifen behaves as an antiestrogen in the breast tissue (7Jordan V.C. Murphy C.S. Endocr. Rev. 1990; 11: 578-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (OHT), an active cellular metabolite of tamoxifen, was used in this study. To explore the mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of OHT, we employed human MCF-7 breast cancer cells, which are enriched in ERα. We initially analyzed the effects of OHT on the expression of two previously characterized E-regulated genes, pS2 and c-Myc (19Berry M. Nunez A.M. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1218-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 20Dubik D. Shiu R.P.C. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1587-1594PubMed Google Scholar). In the experiment described in Fig. 1, E or E plus OHT were added to MCF-7 cells grown in the absence of hormone, and the expression of pS2 and c-Myc mRNAs was monitored at different time points after ligand addition. Upon E (10-8m) treatment, pS2 and c-Myc mRNAs were detected starting at 30 min (left, top, and middle panels). The mRNA levels increased further at 45 min and remained elevated through the last time point at 60 min. In contrast, when OHT (10-6m) was added together with E, neither pS2 nor c-Myc mRNA was detected at any time point (right, top, and middle panels). Treatment with OHT (10-7m) alone did not induce pS2 or c-Myc mRNAs (data not shown). Addition of either E or OHT did not affect the expression of 36B4, a ribosomal protein gene used as a control (left and right, bottom panels). These results indicated that OHT effectively repressed E-induced expression of pS2 and c-Myc in MCF-7 cells. We next determined whether the inhibitory effect of OHT on the pS2 and c-myc promoters is mediated through the recruitment of ER and the associated corepressors to the E-responsive regions of the pS2 and c-myc promoters (Fig. 2A). The pS2 promoter harbors an imperfect palindromic E-responsive element (at -393 to -405), which interacts directly with ER (19Berry M. Nunez A.M. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1218-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The c-myc promoter, on the other hand, contains an E-responsive region (+25 to +141), which does not contain a classical ERE, but harbors a number of ERE half sites (20Dubik D. Shiu R.P.C. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1587-1594PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the interaction of ERα and NCoR with the E-responsive sites in these promoters by employing ChIP. MCF7 cells were exposed to either E or OHT (10-7m) for 40 min, and chromatins were isolated following chemical cross-linking. The cross-linked chromatins were fragmented and immunoprecipitated with antibodies against ERα and the corepressor NCoR. The DNA obtained from immunoprecipitated chromatin was amplified using primers flanking the E-responsive sites as well as primers obtained from unrelated regions several kilobases upstream of these sites (Fig. 2A). Our results indicated that in the absence of E or OHT, ERα did not interact with pS2 (Fig. 2B, upper panel, lane 4) or c-myc (Fig. 2C, upper panel, lane 7) promoter. In the presence of E or OHT, however, ERα exhibited binding to the region containing E-responsive sites of both pS2 (Fig. 2B, upper panel, lanes 5 and 6) and c-myc (Fig. 2C, upper panel, lanes 8 and 9) promoters. Interestingly, NCoR was recruited to the promoters in the presence of OHT, but not in the presence of E (Fig. 2B, upper panel, lanes 8 and 9; Fig. 2C, upper panel, lanes 11 and 12). Neither ERα nor NCoR showed any interaction with the distal promoter regions: -3200 of pS2 or -1800 of c-myc promoter (Fig. 2, B and C, lower panels), indicating that the observed receptor and cofactor interactions were restricted to the E-responsive promoter regions. Collectively, these results indicated that OHT-mediated repression of pS2 and c-myc genes involves interaction of ERα with the E-responsive promoter region, and the recruitment of the corepressor NCoR. OHT-ER Recruits both HDAC 1 and HDAC3 to the Target Promoter—A rapidly growing body of evidence links corepressor recruitment by nuclear hormone receptors to the recruitment of HDACs during transcriptional repression (22Wolffe A. Nature. 1997; 387: 16-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 23Wade P. Pruss D. Wolffe A. Trends Biochem.

Previous studies initially reported that NCoR or SMRT is associated with a Sin3-HDAC1 complex (25Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T-M. Soderstrom M. Laherty C.D. Torchia J. Yang W-M. Brard G. Ngo S.D.

Ayer D.E. Schreiber S.L. Evans R.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 373-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). Later on, other laboratories provided convincing evidence that cellular NCoR or SMRT associates with HDAC3 rather than HDAC1 (27Guenther M.G. Lane W.S. Fischle W. Verdin E. Lazar M.A. Sheikhattar Genes and Dev. 2000; 14: 1048-1057PubMed Google Scholar, 28Li J. Wang J. Wang J. Nawaz Z. Liu J.M. Qin J. Wong J.

Molecular Cell. 2002; 9: 611-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, important to analyze the identity of the NCoR-HDAC complex that is recruited by nuclear receptors at the target promoters. We examined by ChIP analysis whether HDAC1 or HDAC3 or both are recruited along with NCoR to pS2 and c-myc promoters upon treatment of MCF-7 cells with OHT. The anti-HDAC1 and anti-HDAC3 antibodies used in this experiment were directed against the peptide epitopes corresponding to amino acids 466–482 of human HDAC1 and amino acids 411–428 of human HDAC3, respectively. These antibodies specifically recognized their cognate HDACs and did not show any cross-reactivity with other HDACs in Western blot experiments (data not shown). Neither HDAC1 nor HDAC3 was associated with pS2 or c-myc promoter in the absence of any ER ligand or in the presence of E (Fig. 3, upper panel, lanes 13 and 14, lanes 16 and 17; lower panel, lanes 1, 2, 4, and 5). Surprisingly, both HDAC1 and HDAC3 were recruited to these promoters in the presence of OHT (upper panel, lanes 15 and 18; lower panel, lanes 3 and 6). Recruitment of the Components of an NCoR-HDAC3 Complex to pS2 and c-myc Promoters by OHT-ER—Recent biochemical studies indicated that NCoR exists in a large multiprotein complex containing histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) and additional polypeptides such as WD40-repeat protein TBL1 (27Guenther M.G. Lane W.S. Fischle W. Verdin E. Lazar M.A. Sheikhattar Genes and Dev. 2000; 14: 1048-1057PubMed Google Scholar, 28Li J. Wang J. Wang J. Nawaz Z. Liu J.M. Qin J. Wong J.

Molecular Cell. 2002; 9: 611-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Although NCoR is recruited by OHT-ER to the target promoter, previous studies did not address whether a NCoR-HDAC3 complex is recruited to E-regulated promoters in response to tamoxifen or any other SERM. To investigate this possibility, MCF-7 cells were treated with the antagonist for 45 min and then ChIP reactions were performed using antibodies specific for three known components of the NCoR-HDAC3 complex, NCoR, TBL1, and HDAC3. The results, shown in Fig. 4, indicated that all three components of this complex, NCoR (lane 4), HDAC3 (lane 6), and TBL1 (lane 8), were all recruited to the pS2 and c-myc promoters in an OHT-dependent manner. Components of a NuRD Complex Are Also Recruited by OHT-ER—We next investigated the identity of the HDAC1 complex recruited by OHT-ER at the pS2 and c-myc promoters. Previous studies identified two distinct classes of protein complexes containing HDAC1 in mammalian cells: the Sin3 complex and the NuRD complex (30Ayer D.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 193-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Although these two complexes share the histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2, and the histone-binding proteins RbAp46 and RbAp48, they also contain distinct polypeptides that are unique for each complex. The signature polypeptide components of the Sin3 complex are Sin3A, SAP 30, and SAP 18 (31Zhang Y. Iratni R. Erdument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Cell. 1997; 89: 357-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the signature components of the NuRD complex are the SWI2/SNF2 helicase/ ATPase domain-containing Mi2 protein, metastasis-associated protein 1/2 (MTA1/2), and the methyl-CpG-binding domain-containing protein MBD3 (32Zhang Y. LeRoy G. Seelig H-P. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Cell. 1998; 95: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 33Xue Y. Wong J. Moreno G.T. Young M.K. Cote J. Wang W. Mol.

Genet. 1999; 23: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). We performed ChIP to determine whether any of these two HDAC1-containing complexes is recruited by OHT-ER at the target promoter. As described in Fig. 5, we did not detect any recruitment of Sin3A at pS2 or c-myc promoters in response to OHT (lanes 7 and 8). Similarly, we failed to detect any recruitment of SAP30, another signature component of the Sin3 complex, to these promoters in response to OHT (data not shown). In contrast, we observed the recruitment of at least three signature polypeptides of the NuRD complex, HDAC1 (top panels, lane 4; bottom panels, lane 4), MTA1/2 (bottom panels, lane 6), and Mi2 (top panels, lane 6), to the target promoters. These results indicated that the HDAC1-containing complex recruited by OHT-ER is a NuRD complex rather than a Sin3 complex. It is pertinent to mention here that in a related ChIP analysis, the Sin3A and SAP30 antibodies were able to individually immunoprecipitate an ER-corepressor complex induced by a different SERM at the same promoters. 2X. Liu and M. K. Bagchi, unpublished observation. The lack of detection of a Sin3 complex at pS2 or c-myc promoter in response to OHT was, therefore, not due to the inability of the Sin3A or SAP30 antibody to immunoprecipitate the cognate antigen in cross-linked chromatin. Sequential Recruitment of the NCoR-HDAC3 and the NuRD Complexes at the Target Promoter—We next investigated the time course of recruitment of the NCoR-HDAC3 and the NuRD complexes to the pS2 and c-myc promoters. In this experiment, the recruitments of ERα and various components of the two HDAC complexes at the target promoters were examined over a 40-min time course following addition of OHT to the MCF-7 cells. The recruitment of ERα to the pS2 and c-myc promoters was detected as early as 5 min after OHT addition (Fig. 6A, lane 2; Fig. 6B, lane 2). The recruitment of NCoR, TBL1, and HDAC3 was seen within 10 min of OHT addition (Fig. 6, A, lane 3; B, lane 3). The coordinate recruitment of all three signature subunits of the NCoR-HDAC3 complex at the target promoters is consistent with previous reports that NCoR, HDAC3, and TBL1 exist in a multiprotein complex in animal cells. We also determined the time course of recruitment of two key components of the NuRD complex, HDAC1, and Mi2, at the pS2 and c-myc promoters. As shown in Fig. 7, A and B, recruitment of these proteins was not detected at 5 and 10 min after OHT addition, although ERα recruitment was observed at these time points (lanes 2 and 3). The recruitment of HDAC1 and Mi2 to the promoters was seen starting at 20 min following OHT addition (lane 4), and their levels at the promoters increased further at 40 min (lane 5). The co-recruitment of at least two subunits of the NuRD complex to the promoters supported our view that a NuRD complex is brought to the promoter by OHT-ER. The results of the time course experiments (Figs. 6 and 7) suggested that the NCoR-HDAC3 and the NuRD complexes are recruited by the promoter-bound OHT-ER in a sequential manner. Whereas the three components of the NCoR-HDAC3 complex were coordinately recruited at the pS2 and c-myc promoters at 10 min after OHT addition, the components of the NuRD complex were not detectable at this time. Both HDAC1 and Mi2 proteins appeared at the promoters at 20 min after OHT treatment. We cannot rule out the possibility that kinetic differences in the recruitment of these cofactors at the promoters may arise due to differential precipitation efficiency of the antibodies used in the ChIP assay. This possibility is, however, remote given the orchestrated manner in which multiple components of the NCoR-HDAC3 complexes were detected at the target promoter using antibodies against individual components. The antibodies against Mi2 and HDAC1 also placed these two components of the NuRD complex simultaneously at the promoter at 20 min. These results are consistent with a sequential recruitment of the NCoR-HDAC3 and the NuRD complexes to the pS2 and c-myc promoters. The ER-NCoR-HDAC3 and ER-NuRD Complexes Are Distinct and Do Not Occupy the Target Promoter Simultaneously— Although the results described above suggested that two distinct classes of HDAC complexes are recruited to the target promoters by ER-OHT, it is important to determine whether these complexes occupy the same or different promoters at any given time. To distinguish between these possibilities, we performed serial ChIP reactions. Following exposure of MCF-7 cells to OHT for 40 min, the first round of immunoprecipitation was carried out with a HDAC3 antibody. It should be noted that at this time point, ERα as well as the components of both NCoR-HDAC3 and NuRD complexes were present at the target promoters (Figs. 6 and 7). The immunoprecipitated cross-linked DNA-protein complexes were then isolated and subjected to re-immunoprecipitation using antibodies against ERα, NCoR, HDAC3, and HDAC1. As expected, the cross-linked DNA-protein complexes isolated by the first round of immunoprecipitation (by HDAC3) were re-immunoprecipitated by anti-HDAC3 antibody (Fig. 8A, upper and lower panels, lane 8). Clearly, these complexes also contained ERα and NCoR since they were immunoprecipitated by the cognate antibodies (lanes 4 and 10). The HDAC3 complexes isolated in the absence of OHT did not contain either ERα or NCoR (lanes 3 and 9). These results strengthened the notion that an ER-NCoR-HDAC3 complex assembled at the pS2 or c-myc promoter in a OHT-dependent manner. Most importantly, the promoter population that bound ER-NCoR-HDAC3 complex did not retain HDAC1 (lane 6), ruling out co-occupancy of the promoter by HDAC1 and HDAC3 complexes. We further extended these findings by performing reciprocal experiments in which we used a HDAC1 antibody during the first round of immunoprecipitation, and re-immunoprecipitated the isolated complexes with antibodies against ERα, and several signature components of the NCoR-HDAC3 and NuRD complexes. The results of this experiment are presented in Fig. 8B. While the HDAC1 complexes isolated after primary immunoprecipitation contained ERα in an OHT-dependent manner (top, ps2, and c-"

Res. 2003; 27: 1090-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), suggesting that acetaldehyde may be one of the major culprits for alcoholic cardiomyopathy and possibly other alcoholic complications. Blood acetaldehyde levels may reach low millimolar range following alcohol intake in Asians and African Americans due to defective aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) (13Tsukamoto S. Muto T. Nagoya T. Shimamura M. Saito M. Tainaka H. Alcohol Alcohol. 1989; 24: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 14Yoshida A. Pharmacogenetics. 1992; 2: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), making these populations at higher risk for alcohol-induced tissue and cell injury. To further elucidate the culprit role of acetaldehyde in tissue and cell damage, our present study was designed to produce a transgene construct-encoding human ALDH type 2 isozyme (ALDH2) to be overexpressed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Our hypothesis was that the ALDH2 transgene should speed up the breakdown (and detoxification) of the toxin acetaldehyde and thus alleviate oxidative stress and apoptosis resulted from acetaldehyde exposure. HUVEC Cell Culture—Confluent human HUVECs (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Kaighn's F-12K medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 0.1 mg/ml heparin, 0.05 mg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement, and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2. HUVECs were incubated with acetaldehyde (0–200 μm) for 0–48 h before oxidative stress and apoptosis were measured. Generation of the ALDH2 Transgene Construct and Its Expression in HUVECs—The human ALDH2 gene was amplified by PCR from pT7–7-hpALDH2 (provided by Dr. Henry Weiner from Purdue University, Lafayette, IN) using the following primers: ALDH-F (5′-tcgaattctatgttgcgcgctgccgcccg) and ALDH-R (3′-cacggagtcttcttgagtattcttaaggc). The amplified ALDH2 fragment was digested with EcoRI and cloned into the EcoRI site of vector pBsCAG-2 under the CAG cassette, which was shown to drive expression in many mammalian tissues (15Kawarabayashi T. Shoji M. Sato M. Sasaki A. Ho L. Eckman C.B. Prada C.M. Younkin S.G. Kobayashi T. Tada N. Matsubara E. Iizuka T. Harigaya Y. Kasai K. Hirai S. Neurobiol. Aging. 1996; 17: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The transgene construct was designated as pCAG-ALDH2 (Fig. 1). The ALDH2 gene under the CAG cassette control was cloned into plasmid enhanced green fluorescent protein (pEGFP)-C1 (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) using a combination of KpnI + BamHI to construct the plasmid pGFP-CAG-ALDH2. Either pCAG-ALDH2 or pGFP-CAG-ALDH2 containing the ALDH2 gene were transfected into HUVECs using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Enzymatic Activity Assay for ALDH2 Transgene—Expression of ALDH2 in HUVECs following 24 h of incubation at 37 °C was confirmed by an enzymatic assay (16Agarwal D.P. Goedde H.W. Pharmacol. Ther. 1990; 45: 69-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In brief, HUVEC extracts were prepared by sonication in 9 volumes of 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). The ALDH2 enzymatic activity was measured at 25 °C in 1 ml of 33 mm sodium pyrophosphate (pH 8.8) containing 0.8 mm NAD+, 15 μm propionaldehyde, and 0.1 ml of cell extract (50 μg of soluble protein). Production of NADH was determined by absorbance intensity at 340 nm obtained every 50 ms for 5–10 min using a Beckman spectrophotometer (model DU-62) equipped with a kinetics software module. Only the linear portion of ALDH activity curve was used for enzymatic activity analysis. Intracellular Fluorescence Measurement of Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)—The membrane-permeable probe 5-(6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) enters the cells and produces a fluorescent signal after intracellular oxidation by ROS. Intracellular oxidative stress was monitored by both microscopic observation of the changes in fluorescence intensity according to our previously described method (17Ye G. Metreveli N.S. Ren J. Epstein P.N. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 777-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and measurement of intracellular fluorescence intensity in a Spectra MaxGeminiXS molecular device (Spectra Max, Alanta, GA) at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm (18Wang H. Joseph J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1938) Google Scholar). In microscopic observation, HUVECS were loaded with 1 μm CM-H2DCFDA for 30 min at 37 °C and washed with phosphate-buffered saline buffer. Cells were sampled randomly using an Olympus IX-70 microscope equipped with a digital cooled charged-coupled device camera and ImagePro image analysis software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Fluorescence was calibrated with InSpeck microspheres (Molecular Probes). More than 500 cells were evaluated in more than five visual fields. For measurement of intracellular fluorescence intensity using the Spectra MaxGeminiXS molecular device, 200 μl of cells (∼105 cells/ml) were loaded with 10 μm CM-H2DCFDA for 45 min at 37 °C, and intracellular fluorescence intensity was analyzed in a FluoroNunc 96-well polystyrene plate using a SOFTmax PRO 4.0 program. H2O2 was used as standard for intracellular ROS production. Apoptosis Measurement with Fluorochrome Staining and DNA Fragmentation Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Apoptosis was evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively. A DNA-specific fluorochrome staining technique was used for qualitative evaluation. Typical apoptotic changes comprise condensation of chromatin, its compaction along periphery of nucleus, and segmentation of nucleus. In brief, HUVECs were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline. 4′,6′-Diamidino-2′-phenylindoladihydrochloride (DAPI, 1 μg/ml) was added to the fixed HUVECs for 30 min, after which they were examined by Olympus IX-70 fluorescence microscope equipped with a digital cooled charged-coupled device camera and ImagePro image analysis software (Media Cybernetics). For quantitative assay, determination of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments was performed using a cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). Caspase-3 Assay—The caspase-3 activity was determined according to the published method (19Yuan Q. Ray R.M. Johnson L.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1290-C1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline was added to a flask containing HUVECs, and the monolayer was scraped and collected in a microcentrifuge tube. HUVECs were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and HUVECs were lysed in 100 μl of ice-cold cell lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.1% CHAPS, 1 mm dithiothreitol), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). The assay was carried out in a 96-well plate with each well containing 30 μl of cell lysate, 70 μl of assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, 0.1% CHAPS, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA) and 20 μl of caspase-3 colorimetric substrate Ac-DEVD-p-nitroanilide (Sigma). The 96-well plate was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, during which time the caspase in the sample was allowed to cleave the chromophore p-nitroanilide from the substrate molecule. Absorbency was detected at 405 nm with caspase-3 activity being proportional to color reaction. Protein content was determined using the Bradford method (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar). The caspase-3 activity was expressed as picomoles of p-nitroanilide released per micrograms of protein per minute. Western Analysis of Extracellular Signal-regulated Kinase (ERK1/2) and p38 Mitogen-activated Protein (MAP) Kinase—HUVECs were sonicated in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitor mixture. Equal amount of lysates (50 μg/lane) were separated on 20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked in 5% (w/v) nonfat milk and then incubated with anti-ERK1/2 (1:2000), anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (1: 1000), anti-p38 MAP kinase (1:2000), and anti-phospho-p38 MAP kinase (1:1000) antibodies. Anti-ERK1/2 and anti-phospho-ERK1/2 monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), whereas anti-p38 MAP kinase and anti-phospho-p38 MAP kinase polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The antigens were detected by the luminescence method (ECL Western blotting detection kit, Amersham Biosciences) with peroxidase-linked anti-mouse (phospho-ERK1/2) or anti-rabbit (ERK1/2, p38 MAP kinase, and phospho-p38 MAP kinase) IgG (1:5000 dilution). The intensity of immunoblot bands was detected with a Bio-Rad Calibrated Densitometer (model GS-800) (20Ren J. Duan J. Hintz K.K. Ren B.H. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 57: 738-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Data Analysis—Data are mean ± S.E. Statistical significance (p < 0.05) was determined by analysis of variance with a Dunnetts post hoc test. Verification of ALDH Enzymatic Activity following Transgene Overexpression of ALDH2—The transfection efficacy of the ALDH2 construct pCAG-ALDH2 (Fig. 1), following 24 h of incubation with HUVECs, was evaluated using similar construct expressing EGFP (pGFP-CAG-ALDH). The transfection efficiency by pCAG-ALDH2 (∼90%) was determined by ratio of fluorescence microscopic count of GFP expression to the light microscopic images of total cells (Fig. 2, A–F). Transfection of ALDH2 significantly enhanced the enzymatic activity of ALDH in HUVECs. Control HUVEC cells, i.e. either nontransfected or transfected with CAG vector only, exhibited minimal levels of ALDH activity (Fig. 2G). Time-dependent Effect of Acetaldehyde on Oxidative Stress and Apoptosis in HUVECs—Fig. 3A demonstrates that acetaldehyde induced intracellular ROS generation and caspase-3 activation in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. While 50 μm acetaldehyde failed to elicit any effect on caspase-3 activity and enhanced intracellular ROS generation only after 24 h of incubation, higher concentrations of acetaldehyde (100 and 200 μm) required much shorter duration (4–8 h and 2 h, respectively) to significantly enhance ROS generation and caspase-3 activation. Acetaldehyde-induced ROS generation and caspase-3 activation appeared to reach a plateau phase by 12 and 24 h, respectively, suggesting a possible sequential order between the two. To further evaluate the correlation between ROS generation and apoptosis, DNA fragmentation was quantitated in acetaldehyde (100 μm)-treated HUVEC samples the ROS generation of which was predetermined at different incubation time points. A tight liner regression (r2 = 0.939) curve was achieved when the DNA fragmentation was plotted against respective ROS generation from the same sample (Fig. 3B), indicating high correlation between oxidative stress and apoptosis in response to acetaldehyde exposure. Protection of Acetaldehyde-induced Oxidative Stress and Apoptosis by ALDH2 and Antioxidant—The panels in Fig. 4 illustrated that 24-h incubation of acetaldehyde (100 μm) significantly enhanced CM-H2DCFDA fluorescent intensity in nontransfected HUVECs or cells transfected with pCAG vector only. Interestingly, ALDH2 transfection or the antioxidant α-tocopherol (5 μg/ml) prevented an acetaldehyde-induced rise in ROS generation, suggesting that either facilitation of acetaldehyde metabolism or antioxidant may alleviate its cellular toxicity (Fig. 4). Consistent with the results on intracellular ROS generation, the number of DAPI-stained fluorescent cells (indicative of apoptosis) was significantly higher after 24-h incubation of acetaldehyde (100 μm) with nontransfected HUVECs (Fig. 5C) or cells transfected with vector pCAG only (Fig. 5D). Apoptotic characteristics were detected in Fig. 5, C and D, including nuclear condensation. In contrast, such change did not occur in HUVECs overexpressing ALDH2 transgene or those treated with the antioxidant α-tacopherol (5 μg/ml), indicating protection against acetaldehyde-induced cell death (Fig. 5, E and F). This notion was supported by other apoptotic assay including DNA fragmentation (Fig. 5G) and caspase-3 assay (Fig. 6). Either control HUVECs or HUVECs transfected with pCAG vector only displayed minimal DAPI fluorescence in the absence of acetaldehyde exposure (Fig. 5, A and B), indicating that the pCAG vector itself may not be innately harmful.Fig. 6Effect of ALDH2 transgene overexpression and the antioxidant α-tocopherol (5 μg/ml) on acetaldehyde-induced elevation in caspase-3 activity. Mean ± S.E., n = 5; *, p < 0.05 compared with control group (0 μm acetaldehyde). #, p < 0.05 compared with either control or vector-only transfected HUVEC cells treated with acetaldehyde at 100 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Western Blot Analysis of the Stress Signal Molecules ERK1/2 and p38 MAP Kinase—To elucidate the signaling pathway(s) involved in ALDH2-elicited cytoprotection against acetaldehyde-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis, we examined the phosphorylation of the stress signal molecules ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinase in HUVECs in response to acetaldehyde exposure. As shown in Fig. 7, Western blot analysis revealed that 8-h incubation of acetaldehyde (100 μm) led to elevated phosphorylation of both ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinase in nontransfected cells or HUVECs transfected with CAG vector only. Interestingly, transfection of ALDH2 transgene abolished acetaldehyde-elicited activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinase. Neither the pCAG vector nor acetaldehyde affected total ERK1/2 or p38 MAP kinase levels (data not shown). The antagonism of ALDH2 transgene against acetaldehyde-induced ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinase activation may play a significant role in ALDH2-offered cytoprotection and is consistent with the notion regarding involvement of these two stress signaling molecules in acetaldehyde-induced cell injury (21Svegliati-Baroni G.

Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To further verify the role of ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinase in acetaldehyde-induced cell injury, the specific ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 (2.5 μm), the p38 MAP kinase inhibitors SB203580 (2.5 μm) and SB202190 (2.5 μm), along with their inactive analogue SB202474 (2.5 μm) were incubated with HUVECs in the presence of acetaldehyde. Results in Fig. 8 indicated that U0126 and SB203580, either alone or in combination, significantly attenuated the acetaldehyde-induced caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation in HUVECs over incubation durations between 0 and 24 h. However, no additive or synergistic effect was observed when both pathways were blocked. SB202190 duplicated the effect of SB203580, whereas their inactive analogue SB202474 displayed little effect on acetaldehyde-induced apoptosis.Fig. 8Effect of ERK1/2 and/or p38MAP kinase inhibition on acetaldehyde-induced apoptosis. The ERK inhibitor U0126 (2.5 μm) and/or the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580 (2.5 μm) were co-incubated with acetaldehyde (ACA, 100 μm) in HUVECs for up to 24 h. Samples were collected for caspase-3 activity assay (A) and DNA fragmentation determination at different time points (B). C, inhibition of caspase-3 activity assay and DNA fragmentation by different p38 MAP kinase inhibitors SB203580 (2.5 μm) and SB202190 (2.5 μm) as compared with the negative control SB202474 (2.5 μm) in acetaldehyde-treated HUVECs (ACA, 100 μm) up to 12 h. Mean ± S.E., n = 5 experiments. #, p < 0.05 compared with (100 μm) acetaldehyde group.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our major finding revealed that overexpression of ALDH2 transgene prevented acetaldehyde-induced oxidative stress, activation of critical stress signaling molecules ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinase, as well as apoptosis in HUVECs. The ALDH2 elicited cytoprotection against acetaldehyde-induced cell injury is somewhat similar to α-tacopherol, suggesting a possible antioxidant property of ALDH2 transgene. These results not only suggested a role of acetaldehyde as a critical culprit in ethanol-induced cell damage through a stress signaling (ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinase)-mediated mechanism but also provided convincing evidence that ALDH2 may be a key therapeutic target/tool for the prevention and treatment of alcohol- or acetaldehyde-induced tissue and cell injury. The major novelty of the present study is that the newly constructed ALDH2 transgene should provide a useful tool to artificially modify the acetaldehyde metabolism, in conjunction with ADH transgene reported earlier (10Liang Q. Carlson E.C. Borgerding A.J. Epstein P.N. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 291: 766-772PubMed Google Scholar, 11Duan J. McFadden G.E. Borgerding T.J. Norby F.L. Ren B.H. Ye G. Epstein P.N. Ren J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H1216-H1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The availability of both transgenes has made it possible to examine the precise mechanism(s) of acetaldehyde in alcoholic tissue and cell injury. Although several hypotheses have been postulated for alcohol toxicity including oxidative damage, lipid peroxidation and altered membrane property due to hydrophobic ethanol interaction with membrane components (23Bailey S.M. Pietsch E.C. Cunningham C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 891-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 24Cederbaum A.I. Wu D. Mari M. Bai J. Free Radic. Biol.

Sci. 2001; 8: 59-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the culprit toxin in alcoholic tissue and cell injury, has not been clearly identified and thus hindered proper treatment and prevention of alcoholic complications. Ethanol has been demonstrated to contribute to oxidative stress and enhanced peroxidation of lipids, protein, and DNA in a wide variety of organs, tissues, and cells (23Bailey S.M. Pietsch E.C. Cunningham C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 891-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 24Cederbaum A.I. Wu D. Mari M. Bai J. Free Radic. Biol.

Sci. 2001; 8: 59-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26McDonough K.H. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: d601-d606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the ethanol metabolite acetaldehyde directly enhances free radical generation by its oxidation via aldehyde oxidase and/or xanthine oxidase with concurrent accumulation of superoxide (25Zima T.

It is thus reasonable to postulate that the toxic effects of ethanol may be, at least in part, mediated through acetaldehyde. This hypothesis received convincing support from our recent observations of exacerbated cardiac mechanical dysfunction, oxidative stress, and lipid peroxidation associated with a parallel increase in serum and cardiac acetaldehyde levels following acute or chronic alcohol exposure in mice with cardiac specific overexpression of ADH (11Duan J. McFadden G.E. Borgerding T.J. Norby F.L. Ren B.H. Ye G. Epstein P.N. Ren J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H1216-H1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 12Hintz K.K. Relling D.P. Saari J.T. Borgerding A.J. Duan J. Ren B.H. Kato K. Epstein P.N. Ren J. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 2003; 27: 1090-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These data suggest not only a key role of acetaldehyde in alcoholic cardiomyopathy but also free radical formation in alcohol- and acetaldehyde-induced cardiac damage. Evidence from our laboratory and others (30Shaw S. Jayatilleke E. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 31Aberle II, N.S. Ren J. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 2003; 27: 577-583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also indicated that the acetaldehyde-induced cellular toxicity is mediated through the ethanol-inducible isoform of cytochrome P-450, namely CYP2E1, xanthine oxidase and aldehyde oxidase. Inhibition of these enzymatic pathways significantly reduces acetaldehyde-induced lipid peroxidation, tissue and cell injury (31Aberle II, N.S. Ren J. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 2003; 27: 577-583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Metabolism of acetaldehyde through these enzymatic pathways may play an important role in oxidative stress leading to cellular pathology under alcoholism. In addition to the potential interactions with xanthine oxidase, aldehyde oxidase, and CYP2E1, acetaldehyde is capable of stimulating peroxidative reactions by depleting cellular reduced glutathione (32Lieber C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1988; 3: 241-247Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It has been shown that inhibition of ADH prevents, whereas inhibition of ALDH potentiates, the decrease in reduced glutathione levels resulted from ethanol intake (33Vina J. Estrela J.M. Guerri C. Romero F.J. Biochem. J. 1980; 188: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Protein-adduct formation between acetaldehyde and the glutathione precursor, l-cysteine, may contribute to glutathione depletion (34Burgunder J.M. Nelles J. Bilzer M. Lauterburg B.H. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 18: 420-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Data from our current study revealed that ALDH2 transgene protects acetaldehyde-induced apoptosis is mediated, at least in part, through ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinase stress signaling pathways. This is consistent with earlier reports of the involvement of ERK1/2 and MAP kinase cascade in acetaldehyde-induced cell toxicity (21Svegliati-Baroni G. Ridolfi F. Di Sario A. Saccomanno S. Bendia E. Benedetti A. Greenwel P. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1130-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 22Cao Q. Mak K.M. Lieber C.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) or chronic alcohol ingestion-related oxidative injury (35Weng Y. Shukla S.D. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 398: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 36Masamune A. Kikuta K. Satoh M. Satoh A. Shimosegawa T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Acetaldehyde as a highly reactive product from the oxidative metabolism of ethanol was shown to be a critical mediator of ethanol-induced apoptosis via the activation of MAP kinase signaling cascade (21Svegliati-Baroni G. Ridolfi F. Di Sario A. Saccomanno S. Bendia E. Benedetti A. Greenwel P. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1130-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 37Chen A. Davis B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2818-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 38Lee Y.J. Aroor A.R. Shukla S.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 30: 908-914Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Our result of concurrent inhibition of ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinase displaying no additive or synergistic effect on acetaldehyde-induced apoptosis may indicate a likely “shared” downstream pathway between the two stress signal molecules. Furthermore, our observation that inhibition of either pathway (or both) failed to fully prevent the acetaldehyde-induced apoptosis (no effect at all on DNA fragmentation at 8-h incubation point) suggests existence of other signaling pathways in acetaldehyde-induced apoptosis. Further study is warranted to elucidate the precise stress signaling mechanisms involved in the acetaldehyde-induced cell toxicity and ALDH2 transgene offered protection. In summary, our study provided evidence that overexpression of ALDH2 in HUVECs significantly lessens acetaldehyde-induced oxidative stress, activation of stress signaling, and apoptosis in a manner similar to antioxidant α-tacopherol, suggesting the therapeutic value of ALDH2 in detoxification of acetaldehyde, which is essential in the management and prevention of alcohol-related tissue and cell injury. Future work should focus on accessing the clinical feasibility of ALDH2 transgene in the management of alcoholic complications, which would require a better understanding the links between acetaldehyde and cell death in the onset and development of alcoholic complications."
https://openalex.org/W2157467821,"The proteoglycans aggrecan, versican, neurocan, and brevican bind hyaluronan through their N-terminal G1 domains, and other extracellular matrix proteins through the C-type lectin repeat in their C-terminal G3 domains. Here we identify tenascin-C as a ligand for the lectins of all these proteoglycans and map the binding site on the tenascin molecule to fibronectin type III repeats, which corresponds to the proteoglycan lectin-binding site on tenascin-R. In the G3 domain, the C-type lectin is flanked by epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats and a complement regulatory protein-like motif. In aggrecan, these are subject to alternative splicing. To investigate if these flanking modules affect the C-type lectin ligand interactions, we produced recombinant proteins corresponding to aggrecan G3 splice variants. The G3 variant proteins containing the C-type lectin showed different affinities for various ligands, including tenascin-C, tenascin-R, fibulin-1, and fibulin-2. The presence of an EGF motif enhanced the affinity of interaction, and in particular the splice variant containing both EGF motifs had significantly higher affinity for ligands, such as tenascin-R and fibulin-2. The mRNA for this splice variant was shown by reverse transcriptase-PCR to be expressed in human chondrocytes. Our findings suggest that alternative splicing in the aggrecan G3 domain may be a mechanism for modulating interactions and extracellular matrix assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2080394375,"All eukaryotic sialyltransferases have in common the presence in their catalytic domain of several conserved peptide regions (sialylmotifs L, S, and VS). Functional analysis of sialylmotifs L and S previously demonstrated their involvement in the binding of donor and acceptor substrates. The region comprised between the sialylmotifs S and VS contains a stretch of four highly conserved residues, with the following consensus sequence (H/y)Y(Y/F/W/h)(E/D/q/g). (Capital letters and lowercase letters indicate a strong or low occurrence of the amino acid, respectively.) The functional importance of these residues and of the conserved residues of motif VS (HX4E) was assessed using as a template the human ST3Gal I. Mutational analysis showed that residues His299 and Tyr300 of the new motif, and His316 of the VS motif, are essential for activity since their substitution by alanine yielded inactive enzymes. Our results suggest that the invariant Tyr residue (Tyr300) plays an important conformational role mainly attributable to the aromatic ring. In contrast, the mutants W301F, E302Q, and E321Q retained significant enzyme activity (25–80% of the wild type). Kinetic analyses and CDP binding assays showed that none of the mutants tested had any significant effect in nucleotide donor binding. Instead the mutant proteins were affected in their binding to the acceptor and/or demonstrated lower catalytic efficiency. Although the human ST3Gal I has four N-glycan attachment sites in its catalytic domain that are potentially glycosylated, none of them was shown to be necessary for enzyme activity. However, N-glycosylation appears to contribute to the proper folding and trafficking of the enzyme. All eukaryotic sialyltransferases have in common the presence in their catalytic domain of several conserved peptide regions (sialylmotifs L, S, and VS). Functional analysis of sialylmotifs L and S previously demonstrated their involvement in the binding of donor and acceptor substrates. The region comprised between the sialylmotifs S and VS contains a stretch of four highly conserved residues, with the following consensus sequence (H/y)Y(Y/F/W/h)(E/D/q/g). (Capital letters and lowercase letters indicate a strong or low occurrence of the amino acid, respectively.) The functional importance of these residues and of the conserved residues of motif VS (HX4E) was assessed using as a template the human ST3Gal I. Mutational analysis showed that residues His299 and Tyr300 of the new motif, and His316 of the VS motif, are essential for activity since their substitution by alanine yielded inactive enzymes. Our results suggest that the invariant Tyr residue (Tyr300) plays an important conformational role mainly attributable to the aromatic ring. In contrast, the mutants W301F, E302Q, and E321Q retained significant enzyme activity (25–80% of the wild type). Kinetic analyses and CDP binding assays showed that none of the mutants tested had any significant effect in nucleotide donor binding. Instead the mutant proteins were affected in their binding to the acceptor and/or demonstrated lower catalytic efficiency. Although the human ST3Gal I has four N-glycan attachment sites in its catalytic domain that are potentially glycosylated, none of them was shown to be necessary for enzyme activity. However, N-glycosylation appears to contribute to the proper folding and trafficking of the enzyme. The sialyltransferase (ST) 1The abbreviations used are: ST, sialyltransferase; CMP-Neu5Ac, CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid; ST3Gal I, CMP-Neu5Ac:Galβ1–3GalNAc α2,3-sialyltransferase I (EC 2.4.99.4). 1The abbreviations used are: ST, sialyltransferase; CMP-Neu5Ac, CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid; ST3Gal I, CMP-Neu5Ac:Galβ1–3GalNAc α2,3-sialyltransferase I (EC 2.4.99.4). gene family represents a group of enzymes that transfer sialic acid from CMP-Neu5Ac to carbohydrate groups of various glycoproteins and glycolipids. To date, 20 distinct protein members have been cloned and characterized (for a recent review, see Ref. 1Harduin-Lepers A. Vallejo-Ruiz V. Krzewinski-Recchi M.A. Samyn-Petit B. Julien S. Delannoy P. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 727-737Google Scholar). They are classically split into 4 groups, depending on the type of linkage formed and the nature of the sugar acceptor (ST6Gal, ST6GalNAc, ST3Gal, and ST8Sia) (2Tsuji S. Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: v-viiGoogle Scholar). The sialyltransferases are localized in the Golgi apparatus and they share with the other Golgi-resident glycosyltransferases a typical type II architecture consisting in a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain followed by a stem region, and a large C-terminal catalytic domain facing the luminal side (3Paulson J.C. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17615-17618Google Scholar). Comparison of peptide sequences strongly indicates that the length and amino acid composition of catalytic domains are relatively well conserved and variations in protein sizes are generally attributable to differences in the length of the stem region. The stem region can be defined as the peptide portion after the transmembrane domain that can be removed without altering the activity. The most striking differences are observed in the ST6GalNAc subfamily where ST6GalNAc I exhibits the longest stem region (about 200 amino acids) and ST6GalNAc III appears to be devoid of stem region. In this group, it appears that the broader the acceptor specificity, the longer the stem region (1Harduin-Lepers A. Vallejo-Ruiz V. Krzewinski-Recchi M.A. Samyn-Petit B. Julien S. Delannoy P. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 727-737Google Scholar). The stem region often displays high variability in amino acid composition and little secondary organization and was therefore predicted to be flexible (4Donadio S. Dubois C. Fichant G. Roybon L. Guillemot J.C. Breton C. Ronin C. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 311-321Google Scholar). However, this peptide portion often contains cysteine residues as well as several N- and O-glycosylation sites, which could contribute to a local conformation. Recent data suggested that the stem portion could also modulate the in vivo acceptor specificity (5Legaigneur P. Breton C. El Battari A. Guillemot J.C. Auge C. Malissard M. Berger E.G. Ronin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21608-21617Google Scholar).All eukaryotic sialyltransferases share a unique feature, the presence, in their catalytic domain, of several conserved peptide regions referred to as sialylmotifs L and S (6Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. Ind. J. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 34: 157-165Google Scholar) and VS (7Geremia R.A. Harduin-Lepers A. Delannoy P. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: v-viiGoogle Scholar). The functional significance of the sialylmotifs L and S has been assessed by site-directed mutagenesis, using ST6Gal I as a model. The mutagenesis of the most conserved residues led to the conclusion that the L-sialylmotif is mainly involved in donor substrate binding (8Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1497-1500Google Scholar), whereas mutations in the S-sialylmotif were shown to affect both donor and acceptor binding (9Datta A.K. Sinha A. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9608-9614Google Scholar). Considering all known ST sequences, the number of invariant residues in sialylmotifs L and S is 5 and 2, respectively, one cysteine residue being conserved in each region. Mutation of the two conserved cysteines yielded inactive enzymes (8Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1497-1500Google Scholar, 9Datta A.K. Sinha A. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9608-9614Google Scholar, 10Drickamer K. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 2-3Google Scholar) and recent data suggest that they participate in the formation of an intramolecular disulfide linkage that is essential for maintaining an active conformation of the enzyme (11Datta A.K. Chammas R. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15200-15207Google Scholar). Similar observations were made with the polysialyltransferase ST8Sia IV (12Angata K. Yen T.Y. El-Battari A. Macher B.A. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15369-15377Google Scholar). In the latter case, a second intramolecular disulfide bond, which brings the sialylmotifs and the C terminus within proximity, has been evidenced. Formation of dimer through disulfide bonds has also been demonstrated in the case of ST6Gal I (13Ma J. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7758-7766Google Scholar). This dimer comprises ∼20–30% of the enzyme found in liver Golgi and exhibits reduced catalytic activity because of its lower affinity for the sugar nucleotide donor, CMP-Neu5Ac. Recent data demonstrated that the mutation of a single Cys residue (Cys24) in the transmembrane domain of ST6Gal I abolishes dimerization of the enzyme (14Qian R. Chen C. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28641-28649Google Scholar). Two other Cys residues located downstream the S-sialylmotif could also be critical for in vivo enzyme activity (14Qian R. Chen C. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28641-28649Google Scholar).The enzymatic properties of sialyltransferases have been extensively studied in terms of substrate specificities toward synthetic acceptors as well as their glycoprotein and glycolipid acceptor preference, which revealed the exquisite specificity of some of them. However, at the present time, there is no structural information for sialyltransferases and the detailed mechanism of action remains unclear. The crystal structures of sixteen glycosyltransferases belonging to distinct sequence-based families have been recently solved and among them eight are of mammalian origin. Although belonging to different glycosyltransferase families showing no primary sequence identity, these protein structures fall into only two different structural superfamilies named GT-A (or SpsA fold) and GT-B (or BGT fold) (recently reviewed in Refs. 15Breton C. Heissigerova H. Jeanneau C. Moravcova J. Imberty A. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2002; 69: 23-32Google Scholar and 16Coutinho P.M. Deleury E. Davies G.J. Henrissat B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 307-317Google Scholar). In addition, both topologies exhibit the same class of fold; that is the threelayer α/β/α sandwich that resembles the “Rossmann fold.” These structural data have begun to shed light on the role played by short conserved peptide motifs, such as the DXD motif. This motif has been identified in many different glycosyltransferase families (17Breton C. Bettler E. Joziasse D.H. Geremia R.A. Imberty A. J. Biochem. 1998; 123: 1000-1009Google Scholar, 18Breton C. Imberty A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 563-571Google Scholar, 19Wiggins C.A. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7945-7950Google Scholar) and was shown, in several crystal structures, to interact mainly with the phosphate groups of nucleotide donor through the coordination of a metal cation. It is always flanked by apolar amino acids and located in a loop (β-turn) connecting two β-strands, and enzymes sharing this motif have an absolute requirement of divalent cation to be active. In the absence of crystal structures, alternative methods can be used to get insight in the folding properties of other GT families. The use of “fold recognition” or “threading” methods suggests that many other GT families could fall into one of these two structural families (15Breton C. Heissigerova H. Jeanneau C. Moravcova J. Imberty A. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2002; 69: 23-32Google Scholar, 20Wrabl J.O. Grishin N.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 365-374Google Scholar). The sialyltransferase family was among those families for which it was not possible to predict with a high level of confidence which of the two currently known folds they could adopt. However, threading analyses favored the existence of a Rossmann fold (15Breton C. Heissigerova H. Jeanneau C. Moravcova J. Imberty A. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2002; 69: 23-32Google Scholar).In the present study, we performed an extensive sequence analysis of all the known animal STs to gain further insight into the structure/function relationships of this large and biologically important glycosyltransferase family. During this work we evidenced a new peptide motif located between the sialylmotifs S and VS. To address the importance of this new motif and of the VS-sialylmotif in the enzymatic properties of STs, a site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the human ST3Gal I, as a protein model. ST3Gal I transfers Neu5Ac to the galactose residue of type 3 disaccharide found on glycolipids or O-glycosyl proteins. Kinetic studies have shown that ST3Gal I exhibits high transfer efficiency and high affinity (Km of 51 μm) toward the core 1 mucin type disaccharide Galβ1–3GalNAcα- (21Kono M. Ohyama Y. Lee Y.C. Hamamoto T. Kojima N. Tsuji S. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 469-479Google Scholar). Therefore, this enzyme was considered as a good candidate for structure-function studies and for further crystallization trials. Our results contributed to delineate more precisely the nucleotide sugar and acceptor binding regions in the protein. Additional experiments allowed to determine the impact of each of the four predicted N-glycan attachment sites present in the catalytic domain of hST3Gal I on the glycosylation status and enzyme activity of the protein.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Cytidine 5′-monophosphono-N-acetyl neuraminic acid (CMP-Neu5Ac), peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody, gentamicin, l-glutamine, fetal bovine serum, and, AEC staining kit were obtained from Sigma. CMP-[14C]Neu5Ac (289 mCi/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences (Orsay, France), Galβ1–3Gal-NAcα-sp-biotin was from Lectinity Holdings, Inc (Moscow, Russia). Oligonucleotides for PCR were purchased from MWG Biotech (Courtaboeuf, France). Anti-Xpress antibody, restriction enzymes, insect cells and culture media were from Invitrogen (Cergy Pontoise, France), Escherichia coli XL1-Blue cells and the QuickChange site directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (Amsterdam-Zuidoost, The Netherlands). CDP-fractogel (15 μmol of CDP/ml of gel) was from Calbiochem and His-Bind Resin from Novagen, both purchased from VWR international S. A. S (Fontenay-sous-Bois, France). Pfu DNA polymerase was from Promega (Charbonnières-les-Bains, France) and BaculoGold expression system from BD Pharmingen. The nitrocellulose membranes were from Pall Gelman Laboratory (St Germain-en-Laye, France) and C18 SepPak cartridges from Millipore Corp. CDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose (4 μmol of CDP/ml of gel) was a gift from Dr C. Augé (University of Paris-Sud, France).Overexpression of hST3Gal I in Insect Cells—Baculovirus-mediated insect cell expression was used to express native and mutant soluble forms of human hST3Gal I with an N-terminal His6 tag and X-Presss™ epitope in order to facilitate the detection and further purification of the recombinant protein. Two cDNA fragments lacking the first 25 (ST3G-Δ25) or 56 (ST3G-Δ56) amino acids were generated by PCR using as template the plasmid pFlagST3G harboring the human ST3Gal I gene (22Vallejo-Ruiz V. Haque R. Mir A-M. Schwientek T. Mandel U. Cacan R. Delannoy P. Harduin-Lepers A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1549: 161-173Google Scholar). The 951-bp and 860-bp coding regions corresponding to the desired truncated soluble forms of hST3Gal I were obtained using the forward primers (5′-AGACGCGGCCGCTAACTACTCCCACACCATGG-3′) for hST3G-Δ25 and (5′-AAGGGAATTCGCGTCATCTCCCCTTGAAG-3′) for hST3G-Δ56 and the same reverse primer (5′-ACTGGCGGCCGCCAGGCCTTGCACCTGCACCC-3′). Primers were designed to create NotI and EcoRI restriction sites at each end of the gene. The PCR products were obtained by using the Pfu DNA polymerase in 30 cycles, with each cycle comprising 45 s at 94 °C, 1 min of annealing at 50 °C, and 3 min of elongation at 70 °C. The PCR fragments were excised with NotI and EcoRI and cloned into the NotI/EcoRI sites of the baculovirus transfer vector, pVTBac-His (23Sarkar M. Pagny S. Unligil U. Joziasse D. Mucha J. Glossl J. Schachter H. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 193-197Google Scholar) to give the plasmids pVT-ST3G-Δ25 and pVT-ST3G-Δ56. Recombinant proteins encoded by these vectors will contain a melittin cleavable signal peptide at their N terminus and be secreted from baculovirus-infected cells. Spodoptera frugiperda cells (Sf9) were used for the production and amplification of recombinant baculoviruses. The cells were cultured at 27 °C in Grace's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. The co-transfection of Sf9 cells with the transfer vectors and the BaculoGold linear DNA was done according to the manufacturer's instructions. Viral stocks of 108 plaque-forming units (pfu)/ml were prepared by repeated amplification. Trichoplusia ni (High Five™) cells grown at 27 °C in the protein-free Express Five™ SFM medium, supplemented with 1 mm l-glutamine and 50 μg/ml gentamicin, were generally used for the production of recombinant native and mutant forms of human ST3Gal I. Recombinant baculoviruses were used to infect High Five™ cells at a multiplicity of infection of 5 pfu per cell. Medium was collected 96 h after infection, clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatants were stored at –70 °C until they were used.Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutant forms of hST3Gal I were prepared by using the plasmid pVT-ST3G-Δ56 as the template. PCR-based mutagenesis was used for all mutations. The primers used to create mutants of hST3Gal I are described in Table I. All of the recombinant plasmids were propagated into E. coli XL1-Blue cells. Mutants were systematically checked by sequencing.Table ISequence of the primers used for site-directed mutagenesisMutantSequencePrimerH299A5′-GCAAAGGGAACTGGCACGCCTACTGGGAGAACAACCC-3′(Sense)5′-GGGTTGTTCTCCCAGTAGGCGTGCCAGTTCCCTTTGC-3′(Antisense)H299Y5′-GCAAAGGGAACTGGCACTACTACTGGGAGAACAACCC-3′(Sense)5′-GGGTTGTTCTCCCAGTAGTAGTGCCAGTTCCCTTTGC-3′(Antisense)Y300A5′-GGAACTGGCACCACGCCTGGGAGAACAACCC-3′(Sense)5′-GGGTTGTTCTCCCAGGCGTGGTGCCAGTTCC-3′(Antisense)Y300F5′-GGAACTGGCACCACTTCTGGGAGAACAACCC-3′(Sense)5′-GGGTTGTTCTCCCAGAAGTGGTGCCAGTTCC-3′(Antisense)W301A5′-GGAACTGGCACCACTACGCGGAGAACAACCCATCC-3′(Sense)5′-GGATGGGTTGTTCTCCGCGTAGTGGTGCCAGTTC-3′(Antisense)W301F5′-GGAACTGGCACCACTACTACTTTGAGAACAACCC-3′(Sense)5′-GGGTTGTTCTCAAAGTAGTGGTGCCAGTTCC-3′(Antisense)E302Q5′-GGCACCACTACTGGCAGAACAACCCATCCGC-3′(Sense)5′-GCGGATGGGTTGTTCTGCCAGTAGTGGTGCC-3′(Antisense)H316A5′-GCAAGACGGGGGTGGCCGATGCAGACTTTG-3′(Sense)5′-CAAAGTCTGCATCGGCCACCCCCGTCTTGC-3′(Antisense)E321Q5′-CGATGCAGACTTTCAGTCTAAAGTCTGCATCG-3′(Sense)5′-CCGTCACGTTAGACTGAAAGTCTGCATCG-3′(Antisense)N79D5′-CGATGAGAGGTTCGACCAGACCATGCAGCCG-3′(Sense)5′-CGGCTGCATGGTCTGGTCGAACCTCTCATC-3′(Antisense)N114S5′-GCCCAATAACTTGAGTGACACCATCAAGG-3′(Sense)5′-CCTTGATGGTGTCACTCAAGTTATTGGGC-3′(Antisense)N201Q5′-CGGGAGCTGGGAGATCAGGTCAGCATGATCCTGG-3′(Sense)5′-CCAGGATCATGCTGACCTGATCTCCCAGCTCCCG-3′(Antisense)N323H5′-GCAGACTTTGAGTCTCACGTGACGGCCACCTTG-3′(Sense)5′-CAAGGTGGCCGTCACGTGAGACTCAAAGTCTGC-3′(Antisense) Open table in a new tab Western Blot Analysis—Aliquots (1 ml) of crude High Five™ supernatants were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of affinity adsorbent (CDP-Fractogel, or CDP-Agarose or His-Bind) in order to trap the recombinant proteins. Beads were then washed twice with phosphatebuffered saline, resuspended into 50 μl of Laemmli denaturing buffer. Protein samples were separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-10% polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was developed by adsorption of the anti-Xpress antibody (1: 4000) followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:2000), and the protein bands were visualized using the AEC staining kit.Sialyltransferase Assay—Standard reactions were conducted at 37 °C for 20 min in a final volume of 50 μl in the presence of 50 μm of donor substrate CMP-Neu5Ac, 110,000 cpm of CMP-[14C]Neu5Ac, 50 μm of acceptor substrate Galβ1–3GalNAcα-sp-biotin in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5. The reaction was initiated by addition of the recombinant enzyme source and stopped by addition of 450 μl of cold water. Reaction products were applied on C18 SepPak cartridges and eluted with methanol. The radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. The apparent Km value for CMP-Neu5Ac was obtained using 1–200 μm of CMP-Neu5Ac with 0.5 mm of acceptor, and for the acceptor, using 2–500 μm of Galβ1–3GalNAcα-sp-biotin with 200 μm of CMP-Neu5Ac. For comparison of mutant and wild type activity, ST activity was normalized for protein expression (relative enzyme mass) assessed by Western blotting of wild-type and mutant proteins. All enzyme assays were done in triplicate.Sequence Analysis—Protein sequences were retrieved from Gen-Pept or SwissProt and analyzed using BLAST (24Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Google Scholar), LALIGN (25Huang X. Miller W. Adv. Appl. Math. 1991; 12: 337-357Google Scholar), and ClustalW (26Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Google Scholar) programs. The sensitive Hydrophobic Cluster Analysis method (HCA) was used to compare protein sequences with very low level of sequence identity (27Gaboriaud C. Bissery V. Benchetrit T. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 149-155Google Scholar).RESULTSSequence Analysis of Sialyltransferases—All eukaryotic sialyltransferases share a unique feature, the presence in their catalytic domain of several conserved peptide regions commonly referred to as sialylmotifs L, S, and VS. Except for these peptide motifs there are few sequence similarities between the various groups of STs (ST6Gal, ST6GalNAc, ST3Gal, and ST8Sia). Examination of all the known ST protein sequences reveals another conserved motif located between the the sialylmotifs S and VS (Fig. 1). The sequence consensus of this motif, rich in aromatic residues, is as follows (H/y)Y(Y/W/F/h)(D/E/q/g) (capital letters and lowercase letters indicate a strong or low occurrence of the amino acid, respectively).Of striking interest is the presence of the invariant Tyr residue at the second position. Taken together, the sialylmotifs S, VS, and the new one cover a large part of the C terminus of the catalytic domain (55–70 amino acids). For better clarity in the text, the sialylmotifs will be numbered as indicated in Fig. 1. The 20 distinct ST sequences that have been cloned to date have in common the presence of 10 invariant residues and about 30 conserved or semiconserved positions located in these motifs. The function of the most conserved residues in sialylmotifs L and S (motifs 1 and 2) has already been investigated, using ST6Gal I as a model (8Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1497-1500Google Scholar, 9Datta A.K. Sinha A. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9608-9614Google Scholar). To elucidate the functional relevance of residues of motifs 3 and 4, we constructed a series of mutants of the human ST3Gal I. Each residue of motif 3 was mutated (His299-Tyr300-Trp301-Glu302) as well as the two invariant amino acids of motif 4 (His316 and Glu321).Expression of hST3Gal I and Mutants in Insect Cells—For expression of the wild-type human ST3Gal I and its mutants, a baculoviral expression plasmid containing an N-terminal signal sequence, (His)6 tag and X-Press tag was used for expression of a soluble form of the cDNA for human ST3Gal I. Two different soluble forms of the native enzyme were generated: ST3G-Δ25 (truncated just after the transmembrane domain after the residue 25) and ST3-Δ56 (deleted of the first 56 amino acids), which was recently shown to be the minimal catalytically active form when expressed in COS-7 cells (22Vallejo-Ruiz V. Haque R. Mir A-M. Schwientek T. Mandel U. Cacan R. Delannoy P. Harduin-Lepers A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1549: 161-173Google Scholar). The level of protein expression in the culture medium of insect cells was monitored by Western blotting using an anti-X-Press antibody and upon trapping of the recombinant proteins secreted in the culture supernatants with different affinity gels (CDP-beads and His-Bind resin). At this stage, we noticed that CDP-Fractogel was the most efficient affinity system to catch the recombinant proteins since almost 100% of enzyme activity was recovered (only 80–90% for the other affinity sorbents) (data not shown). However, we also observed a tight, almost irreversible, and nonspecific binding of the recombinant proteins on CDP-Fractogel beads (binding was only poorly inhibited with a large excess of CDP, and the enzyme binds with the same efficiency to GDP-Fractogel beads). In contrast, a specific and reversible binding was obtained using homemade CDP-agarose beads. Therefore, CDP-Fractogel beads were used to quantify the amount of secreted recombinant proteins whereas CDP-Agarose beads were used for the functional tests (i.e. capability of mutants to bind to CDP). The two isoforms ST3G-Δ25 and ST3G-Δ56 were equally produced in the culture medium upon transfection of Sf9 or Hi-5™ cells with the recombinant baculoviruses. Although they differ in the number of N-glycosylation sites (5 for ST3G-Δ25 and 4 for ST3G-Δ56) they display an apparent similar pattern of glycosylation since 3 major polypeptide bands with diffuse borders (glycoforms) can be distinguished by Western blotting whatever the construct and the cell line utilized (Fig. 2). As well, enzyme activity measurements did not reveal major differences between the two constructs, a slightly higher specific activity being observed for ST3-Δ56 expressed in Hi-5™ cells (data not shown). Therefore, the ST3-Δ56 construct overexpressed in Hi-5 cells was selected to further explore the function of the most conserved residues of motifs 3 and 4.Fig. 2Expression of two truncated forms of hST3Gal I in two different insect cell lines. The level of recombinant protein expression of ST3G-Δ25 (lanes 1 and 2) and ST3G-Δ56 (lanes 3 and 4) secreted in the culture medium of transfected Sf9 cells (lanes 1 and 3) or High-Five™ cells (lanes 2 and 4) was determined by Western blotting after SDS-PAGE as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Characterization of Native and Mutant Enzymes—As seen in Fig. 3A, eight of the nine mutants were efficiently secreted in the culture medium and most of them are produced at protein levels roughly equivalent to the native enzyme. Their similar pattern of migration (molecular mass and glycosylation status) indicated that the introduced point mutation did not affect the overall structure of the enzyme. However one mutant (Y300A) was repeatedly poorly expressed in the culture medium of insect cells. The mutation of this Tyr residue in Phe resulted in a better expression level.Fig. 3Expression and activity of wild-type ST3G-Δ56 and mutants. A, enzyme activity and expression levels of wild-type and mutant proteins. Expression levels of mutant proteins were compared with the wild-type (WT) enzyme by Western blotting after SDS-PAGE (lower panel), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Enzyme samples were adjusted to give comparable amounts of proteins for activity assays. Sialyltransferase activity of mutants is expressed relative to the wild-type enzyme. Enzyme assays were conducted as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and values are the average of at least three determinations. B, binding of wild-type ST3G-Δ56 and mutants to CDP-agarose beads. CDP-beads were incubated with samples of culture supernatants of infected cells (volumes were adjusted to give comparable amounts of recombinant proteins). Bound proteins were separated from unbound proteins by centrifugation of CDP-beads and visualized by imunoblotting. Results were qualitatively evaluated by comparison to wild-type enzyme as follows: binding similar to the WT (+++), binding estimated in the range 40–80% (++) or less than 30% (+) of the WT, no significant binding (–).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The relative amounts of proteins were determined for a comparative activity assay. Medium from cells mock-transfected using only the vector (pVTBac) showed no detectable sialyltransferase activity (data not shown). The native ST3G-Δ56 construct yielded an average transferase activity of 400 nmol·min–1·mg protein–1. As shown in Fig. 3A, the substitution in motif 3 of the highly conserved His residue (H299A) and of the invariant Tyr residue in Ala (Y300A) resulted in a complete loss of enzyme activity. The mutation H299Y was dictated by the fact that ST6Gal I is the only ST displaying a Tyr instead of a His residue at this amino acid position (see Fig. 1). A low but detectable activity (2% relative to the wild-type) is observed for the mutant H299Y, thus suggesting a possible role of the aromatic ring at this position. Interestingly, if the mutation Y300A yielded a completely inactive enzyme, the mutation Y300F restored substantial enzyme activity (30% activity relative to the native enzyme). These results combined to the expression levels of the mutants strongly suggest that the invariant Tyr residue of motif 3 plays an important conformational role mainly attributable to the aromatic ring. The third position of motif 3 is a conserved aromatic residue (Tyr, Phe, Trp, or His). The substitution W301A in ST3G-Δ56 reduced enzyme activity to a low but significant level of activity (2%) whereas the conservative mutation W301F had little effect on enzyme activity (30%). The fourth position of motif 3 is less conserved and the mutation of this residue in Gln (E302Q) did not really affect enzyme activity (80% of the wild type).

Functions of ABCA1 are highly regulated at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, and the synthesized ABCA1 protein turns over rapidly with a half-life of 1–2 h. To examine whether the functions of ABCA1 are modulated by associated proteins, a yeast two-hybrid library was screened with the C-terminal 120 amino acids of ABCA1. Two PDZ (PSD95-Discs large-ZO1) proteins, α1-syntrophin and Lin7, were found to interact with ABCA1. Immunoprecipitation revealed that α1-syntrophin interacted with ABCA1 strongly and that the interaction was via the C-terminal three amino acids SYV of ABCA1. Co-expression of α1-syntrophin in human embryonic kidney 293 cells retarded degradation of ABCA1 and made the half-life of ABCA1 five times longer than in the cells not expressing α1-syntrophin. This effect is not common among PDZ-containing proteins interacting with ABCA1, because Lin7, which was also found to interact with the C terminus region of ABCA1, did not have a significant effect on the half-life of ABCA1. Co-expression of α1-syntrophin significantly increased the apoA-I-mediated release of cholesterol. ABCA1 was co-immunoprecipitated with α1-syntrophin from mouse brain. These results suggest that α1-syntrophin is involved in intracellular signaling, which determines the stability of ABCA1 and modulates cellular cholesterol release.

Cholesterol is not catabolized in the peripheral cells and, therefore, is mostly released and transported to the liver for conversion to bile acids to maintain cholesterol homeostasis. The same pathway may also remove cholesterol that has pathologically accumulated in cells, such as at the initial stage of atherosclerosis. The assembly of high density lipoprotein (HDL) 1The abbreviations used are: HDL, high density lipoprotein; ABCA1, ATP-binding cassette transporter A1; HEK293, human embryonic kidney 293; LXR/RXR, liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PDZ, PSD95-Discs large-ZO1. particles by lipid-free apolipoproteins with cellular lipid has been recognized as one of the major mechanisms for the cellular cholesterol release (1Hara H.

ApoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux is a major event in “reverse cholesterol transport,” a process that generates HDL and transports excess cholesterol from the peripheral tissues, including the arterial wall, to the liver for biliary secretion. The importance of ABCA1 in this active cholesterol-releasing pathway for regulating cholesterol homeostasis became apparent with the finding that it is impaired in the cells from patients with Tangier disease, a genetic deficiency of circulating HDL (3Francis G.A.

Cholesterol is a prerequisite for cells, but, at the same time, the hyper-accumulation of cholesterol is harmful to cells. Therefore, the expression of ABCA1 is highly regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. The transcription of ABCA1 is regulated by the intracellular oxysterol concentration via the LXR/RXR nuclear receptor (7Venkateswaran A. Laffitte B.A. Joseph S.B. Mak P.A. Wilpitz D.C. Edwards P.A.

We analyzed the associated proteins that could be involved in the post-translational regulation of ABCA1. By yeast two-hybrid screening with the C-terminal 120 amino acids of ABCA1, two PDZ (PSD95-Discs large-ZO1)-binding proteins, α1-syntrophin and Lin7, were found to interact with ABCA1. Immunoprecipitation confirmed the association of α1-syntrophin and ABCA1 via its C-terminal amino acids. The importance of this interaction in the regulation of ABCA1 function was examined. Materials—The anti-ABCA1 monoclonal antibody KM3073 was generated against the first extracellular domain of the human ABCA1 protein in rats. Anti-ABCA1 monoclonal antibody KM3110 was generated against the C-terminal 20 amino acids of ABCA1 in mice. Anti-ABCA1 polyclonal antibody, previously described (11Tanaka A.R. Abe-Dohmae S.

Affinity-purified antibody specific for α1-syntrophin was prepared using recombinant proteins. Human α1-syntrophin (amino acids 169–346) was fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) in the pGEX vector (Amersham Biosciences) and to the maltose-binding protein (MBP) in the pMAL-c2 vector (New England Biolabs, Inc.). The GST-α1-syntrophin protein was used as an antigen. Obtained rabbit antiserum was affinity purified with the column coupled with the MBP-α1-syntrophin fusion protein. Anti-FLAG epitope monoclonal antibody M2 was purchased from Sigma. Human apoA-I was a gift from Dr. Shinji Yokoyama, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences.

Yeast Two-hybrid Library Screening—The Matchmaker Two-hybrid System 3 from Clontech was used following the manufacturer's instructions. The ABCA1 C terminus region coding for 120 amino acids was cloned from cDNA (13Tanaka A.R. Ikeda Y. Abe-Dohmae S. Arakawa R. Sadanami K. Kidera A. Nakagawa S. Nagase T. Aoki R. Kioka N. Amachi T.

The yeast strain AH109, transformed with pGBKT7/ABCA1-C120, was mated with the yeast strain Y187, which had been pretransformed with a human bone marrow cDNA library. The plasmids, purified from β-galactosidase positive clones, were transformed into Escherichia coli and sequenced. Cellular Lipid Release Assay—Cells were subcultured in poly-l-Lys-coated 6-well plates at a density of 1.0 × 106 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. After 24 h, cells were transfected with ABCA1 and/or FLAG-α1-syntrophin using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). After 24 h of incubation, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated in 0.02% bovine serum albumin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10 μg/ml apoA-I. The lipid content in the medium was determined after 24 h incubation as described previously (14Abe-Dohmae S. Suzuki S. Wada Y. Hiroyuki Aburatani E Vance D. Yokoyama S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11092-11099Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation Analysis—HEK293 cells, transiently expressing ABCA1, were lysed with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (100 μg/ml 4-(amidino)-phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (pAPMSF)), 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin).

The particulate fraction was pelleted by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 10 min), resuspended in 10 volumes of homogenization buffer, and recentrifuged. Washed pellets were solubilized in homogenization buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and incubated on ice for 30 min. The suspension was centrifuged again, and the supernatant was then incubated with anti-α1-syntrophin rabbit polyclonal antibody for 100 min at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were incubated with protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) for 1 h and washed four times with homogenization buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. The bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (7%) and analyzed by immunoblotting using the anti-ABCA1 antibody KM3073 or KM3110. Immunostaining—HEK293 cells were co-transfected with ABCA1 and FLAG-tagged α1-syntrophin or FLAG-tagged Lin7 using LipofectAMINE. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 5% sucrose in PBS+ (PBS with 0.87 mm CaCl2 and 0.49 mm MgCl2) for 30 min and permeabilized for 5 min in 0.4% Triton X-100 in PBS+. The cells were blocked with 10% goat serum diluted with PBS+. This was followed by incubation with anti-ABCA1 polyclonal antibody and anti-FLAG M2 antibody. The cells were then stained with Alexa 488-labeled anti-rat IgG antibody and Alexa 564-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody (Molecular Probes) as secondary antibodies. The fluorescence images were obtained using an Axiovert microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a MicroRadiance confocal laser-scanning microscope (Bio-Rad). ABCA1 Interacts with Two PDZ-binding Proteins—To search for proteins that are associated with the C-terminal region of ABCA1, a fusion construct of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain with the C-terminal 120 amino acids of human ABCA1 was used as bait for two-hybrid screening. The identified genes contained two PDZ-containing proteins, α1-syntrophin (10 clones) and Lin7 (two clones). To determine whether the interaction between ABCA1 and α1-syntrophin or Lin7 occurs in vivo, we transfected FLAG-tagged α1-syntrophin, FLAG-tagged Lin7, or FLAG-tagged vinexin β (15Akamatsu M. Aota S.-i. Suwa A. Ueda K. Amachi T. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Kioka N. J. Biol.

Lysates prepared from transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, and precipitates were evaluated by immunoblotting with anti-ABCA1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1, ABCA1 was co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged α1-syntrophin or FLAG-tagged Lin7, but not with FLAG-tagged vinexin β. ABCA1 was not precipitated with mouse IgG control from any of the lysates in which the expression of ABCA1 (Fig. 1) and FLAG-tagged proteins (data not shown) were detected by immunoblotting. More than 25% of the ABCA1 expressed in HEK293 was roughly estimated to be co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged α1-syntrophin, suggesting strong interaction between ABCA1 and α1-syntrophin (Fig. 2). The interaction between ABCA1 and Lin7 seemed to be weak, because the amount of precipitated ABCA1 with Lin7 was much less than that with α1-syntrophin. The amount of ABCA1 in lysates was consistently higher when co-expressed with α1-syntrophin than with other proteins.Fig. 2ABCA1 interacts with α1-syntrophin via the C-terminal three amino acids. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with ABCA1 or ABCA1ΔSYV, in which the C-terminal three amino acids were trimmed, and with FLAG-tagged α1-syntrophin. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-FLAG antibody. Immunocomplexes and cell lysates (5%) were subjected to immunoblotting using the anti-ABCA1 monoclonal antibody KM3073, generated against the first extracellular domain of the human ABCA1, and an anti-FLAG antibody. The data are representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ABCA1 Interacts with α1-Syntrophin via the C-terminal Three Amino Acids—ABCA1 contains the amino acid sequence ESYV at the C terminus, which has been described as a binding target for syntrophin PDZ domains (16Gee S.H. Quenneville S. Lombardo C.R. Chabot J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14638-14646Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To determine whether the C-terminal three amino acids SYV are important for the interaction, ABCA1ΔSYV, in which these amino acids were trimmed, was co-expressed with FLAG-tagged α1-syntrophin in HEK293 cells. Although the expression of ABCA1ΔSYV was detected in the lysates, no ABCA1ΔSYV was co-precipitated with FLAG-tagged α1-syntrophin. These results suggest that the interaction is mediated with the C-terminal three amino acids SYV of ABCA1 and α1-syntrophin PDZ domains. Co-localization of the ABCA1 and PDZ-containing Proteins α1-Syntrophin and Lin7—ABCA1 is mainly localized to plasma membrane but is also substantially expressed in intracellular compartments (11Tanaka A.R.

To determine whether ABCA1 and α1-syntrophin or Lin7 are co-localized in cells, ABCA1 was co-transfected with FLAG-tagged α1-syntrophin or FLAG-tagged Lin7 into HEK293 cells. The subcellular localization of these proteins was examined under a confocal laser scanning microscope. α1-Syntrophin resided mainly on plasma membrane, where it co-localized with ABCA1 (Fig. 3A). Lin7 also localized mainly on plasma membrane and appeared not to be uniformly distributed but rather clustered in a specific region of plasma membrane in some cells. In those regions, high expression of ABCA1 and the formation of filopodia were observed (Fig. 3B). Interaction of α1-Syntrophin with ABCA1 in Mouse Brain— Among syntrophin isoforms, α1-syntrophin is mainly expressed in brain, skeletal muscle, and heart in mouse (21Peters M.F. Adams M.E. Froehner S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). To examine whether ABCA1 and α1-syntrophin interact physiologically, we tried co-immunoprecipitation of these two proteins from mouse brain. Lysates prepared from mouse brain were immunoprecipitated with anti-α1-syntrophin antibody, and precipitates were evaluated by immunoblotting with anti-ABCA1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 4, mouse ABCA1 was co-immunoprecipitated with α1-syntrophin, but not with control IgG. This interaction was confirmed to be specific, because ABCA1 was not precipitated from brain of α1-Syn-/- mice (Fig. 4). α1-Syntrophin Modulates Turnover of ABCA1—Syntrophins have been reported to be involved in protein stability. For example, interaction with β2-syntrophin controls the degradation of ICA512, which connects insulin secretory granules to the utrophin complex and the actin cytoskeleton, by calpain (22Ort T. Voronov S. Guo J. Zawalich K. Froehner S.C. Zawalich W. Solimena M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4013-4023Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and the stability of AQP4 (23Neely J.D. Amiry-Moghaddam M.

The amount of ABCA1 in lysates was consistently higher on co-expression with α1-syntrophin than with other proteins as shown in Fig. 1. Therefore, we examined the effect of α1-syntrophin on the stability of ABCA1. FLAG-tagged α1-syntrophin or FLAG-tagged Lin7 was transiently co-expressed with ABCA1 in HEK293 cells. At 48 h after transfection, the medium was replaced with 10% fetal bovine serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, and cellular protein synthesis was inhibited to block supply of the newly synthesized ABCA1. After the indicated times, the amount of ABCA1 was measured by immunoblotting (Fig. 5A). After the inhibition of cellular protein synthesis, 80% of ABCA1 was degraded in 7 h, and the half-life was about2has reported previously (10Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B. Silver D.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Thus, ABCA1 protein turns over rapidly in HEK293 cells. When ABCA1 was co-expressed with α1-syntrophin, only ∼30% of ABCA1 was degraded in a 7-h treatment with cycloheximide, and the half-life was estimated to be 10 h (Fig. 5B). Lin7, which is a PDZ protein and also binds to the C terminus region of ABCA1, did not show a significant effect on the half-life of ABCA1. The half-life of ABCA1ΔSYV was scarcely affected by co-expression of α1-syntrophin (data not shown). These results suggest that α1-syntrophin decreases ABCA1 protein degradation by interacting with the C terminus three amino acids of ABCA1. α1-Syntrophin Increases apoA-I-mediated Cholesterol Efflux by ABCA1—To analyze the functional consequences of decreased ABCA1 protein degradation in the presence of α1-syntrophin, the apoA-I-mediated release of cholesterol was examined from HEK293 cells transiently cotransfected with ABCA1 and α1-syntrophin (Fig. 6). Human ABCA1 transiently expressed in HEK293 cells supported the apoA-I-mediated release of cholesterol as previously reported with ABCA1-green fluorescent protein (13Tanaka A.R. Ikeda Y. Abe-Dohmae S. Arakawa R. Sadanami K. Kidera A. Nakagawa S. Nagase T. Aoki R. Kioka N. Amachi T. Yokoyama S. Ueda K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 1019-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Co-expression of α1-syntrophin significantly increased the apoA-I-mediated release of cholesterol, although expression of α1-syntrophin alone did not affect it. In this study, we identified α1-syntrophin as a protein interacting strongly with ABCA1 via the C-terminal three amino acids SYV of ABCA1. Co-expression of α1-syntrophin retarded degradation of ABCA1 and made the half-life of ABCA1 in HEK293 cells five times longer than in the cells not expressing α1-syntrophin. This effect is not common among PDZ-containing proteins interacting with ABCA1, because Lin7, which also binds to the C terminus region of ABCA1, did not show a similar effect. Co-expression of α1-syntrophin significantly increased the apoA-I-mediated release of cholesterol. Because this interaction was observed in mouse brain, α1-syntrophin could be involved in lipid homeostasis in brain. Mammalian cells have developed sophisticated mechanisms to ensure adequate cellular cholesterol levels, because cholesterol plays a critical role in several important cell functions, including protein trafficking, membrane vesiculation, and signal transduction, and, at the same time, hyper-accumulation of cholesterol is harmful for cells. Plasma membrane cholesterol content, for example, is regulated through a feedback mechanism controlled by sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) (24Hua X. Yokoyama C. Wu J. Briggs M.R.

Chem. 1996; 271: 26461-26464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). To eliminate excess cholesterol from the cell, expression of ABCA1, a key molecule for apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux, is stimulated by intracellular oxysterol via the LXR/RXR nuclear receptor (26Repa J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1243-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The synthesized ABCA1 protein turns over rapidly with a half-life of 1–2 h (8Wang Y. Oram J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5692-5697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 10Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B. Silver D.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) to cancel cholesterol efflux by ABCA1. Because co-expression of α1-syntrophin retarded degradation of ABCA1 and made the half-life of ABCA1 in HEK293 cells five times longer than in the cells not expressing α1-syntrophin, α1-syntrophin is expected to be involved in intracellular signaling, which determines the stability of ABCA1. Recently, it has been proposed that ABCA1 is regulated in two different ABCA1 degradation pathways under various cellular conditions: (i) a basal calpain degradation pathway that is turned off by interaction with apolipoproteins (9Arakawa R. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22426-22429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 10Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B. Silver D.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar); and (ii) a ubiquitinproteasome pathway that is activated by marked free cholesterol loading (27Feng B. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43271-43280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A sequence rich in proline, glutamate, serine, and threonine (PEST sequence) just before the second membrane spanning domain of ABCA1 (amino acid residue 1283–1306) is involved in regulating the calpain degradation of ABCA1 (10Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B. Silver D.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Although the nature of the apoA-I-ABCA1 interaction is not fully understood, conformational alteration of ABCA1 through the PEST sequence may be induced by its direct or indirect interaction with apoA-I, which may render ABCA1 resistant to proteolysis by calpain. Because ABCA1 was ubiquitinated as well when co-expressed with α1-syntrophin (data not shown), α1-syntrophin seems not to affect ABCA1 degradation in an ubiquitinproteasome pathway. Binding of α1-syntrophin to the C terminus of ABCA1 may cause a conformational alteration similar to that caused by apoA-I binding and render ABCA1 resistant to proteolysis by calpain. Syntrophins are a family of five proteins (α1, β1, β2, γ1, and γ2,) containing two pleckstrin homology domains, a PDZ domain, and a C-terminal syntrophin-unique region (28Kachinsky A.M. Froehner S.C.

Analysis of α-Syn-/- mouse has demonstrated that perivascular localization of AQP4 in brain requires α1-syntrophin (23Neely J.D. Amiry-Moghaddam M. Ottersen O.P. Froehner S.C. Agre P. Adams M.E.

Boettcher A. Bared S.M. Probst M.C. Schmitz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It is possible that α1-syntrophin is also involved in endocytotic recycling of ABCA1. Extracellular lipid-free apoA-I may first interact with ABCA1 on plasma membrane, but it is not clear whether the formation of HDL takes place extracellularly or if intracellular events, such as endocytotic recycling, are involved (30Takahashi Y. Smith J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11358-11363Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). It is intriguing that apoA-I and α1-syntrophin have a similar effect on ABCA1 turnover. A mutation of ABCA1 that causes Tangier disease (W590S) does not affect apoA-I binding or initial ATP binding/hydrolysis but results in a defect in lipid efflux (11Tanaka A.R. Abe-Dohmae S.

It is possible that PDZ-containing proteins such as α1-syntrophin are involved in intracellular signaling, which determines the stability of ABCA1.

CKIϵ itself can be regulated in vitro by inhibitory autophosphorylation, and recent data suggest that in vivo kinase activity can be regulated by extracellular stimuli. We show here that the phosphorylation state and kinase activity of CKIϵ are directly regulated by Wnt signaling. Coexpression of XWnt-8 or addition of soluble Wnt-3a ligand led to a significant and rapid increase in the activity of endogenous CKIϵ. The increase in CKIϵ activity is the result of decreased inhibitory autophosphorylation because it is abolished by preincubation of immunoprecipitated kinase with ATP. Furthermore, mutation of CKIϵ inhibitory autophosphorylation sites creates a kinase termed CKIϵ(MM2) that is significantly more active than CKIϵ and is not activated further upon Wnt stimulation. Autoinhibition of CKIϵ is biologically relevant because CKIϵ(MM2) is more effective than CKIϵ at activating transcription from a Lef1-dependent promoter. Finally, CKIϵ(MM2) expression in Xenopus embryos induces both axis duplication and additional developmental abnormalities. The data suggest that Wnt signaling activates CKIϵ by causing transient dephosphorylation of critical inhibitory sites present in the carboxyl-terminal domain of the kinase.

CKIϵ (CSNK1E) and the closely related CKIδ (CSNK1D) have been identified as positive regulators of the canonical Wnt-β-catenin pathway. Overexpression of CKIϵ in Xenopus embryos promotes ectopic dorsal axis formation and expression of Wnt-responsive genes, whereas CKI inhibitors and knockdown of CKIϵ by RNA interference blunt the accumulation of β-catenin in response to Wnt signaling (10Peters J.M.

Notably, whereas CKIϵ interacts with Dvl in the absence of Wnt signaling, a Dvl electrophoretic mobility shift apparently resulting from direct CKIϵ phosphorylation only occurs during Wnt signaling (10Peters J.M.

The positive role of CKIϵ and the closely related CKIδ suggests that their kinase activity might in turn be regulated by Wnt signaling. CKIϵ and CKIδ differ from the 35-kDa CKIα isoform in that they are negatively regulated by an additional 13-kDa carboxyl-terminal autoregulatory domain. Intramolecular autophosphorylation of this domain strongly inhibits CKIϵ and CKIδ kinase activity. Kinase autoinhibition can be relieved in vitro by dephosphorylation of the autoinhibitory domain by diverse serine/threonine phosphatases (25Cegielska A. Gietzen K.F. Rivers A. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1357-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 26Rivers A. Gietzen K.F. Vielhaber E. Virshup D.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 45393-45399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) found that CKIϵ in neostriatal neurons could be activated by stimulation of metabotropic glutamate receptors. Receptor activation led to a rise in intracellular calcium, resulting in activation of the calcium-regulated phosphatase calcineurin, with subsequent dephosphorylation and activation of CKIϵ. The observation that CKIϵ activity could be regulated both in vitro and in vivo led us to test whether Wnt signaling controls CKIϵ activity as well. Our studies demonstrate that Wnt signaling directly regulates CKIϵ by inducing dephosphorylation of its autoregulatory domain. Wnt ligand rapidly activated both endogenous and overexpressed CKIϵ, an effect that was mimicked by phosphatase treatment of immunoprecipitated CKIϵ and reversed by preincubation of immunoprecipitated CKIϵ with ATP. Furthermore, Wnt signaling did not further activate a CKIϵ mutant (termed CKIϵ(MM2)) (29Gietzen K.F. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32063-32070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) with serine and threonine to alanine point mutations at the inhibitory autophosphorylation sites. Consistent with the hypothesis that dephosphorylation of CKIϵ is a required step in the Wnt signaling pathway, the CKIϵ(MM2) mutant was more active in both transactivation of a Lef-1 reporter and in inducing axis duplication and additional developmental abnormalities in Xenopus embryogenesis. Interestingly, multiple distinct phosphatases appear to affect the activation of CKIϵ. Together, these data suggest that CKIϵ activation is an important consequence of canonical Wnt signaling. The data further imply that an unidentified protein phosphatase upstream of CKIϵ is activated by Wnt signaling to dephosphorylate and activate CKIϵ. Antibodies, Plasmids, Reagents—The expression plasmids pCS2-Myc-CKIϵ and pCS2-Myc-CKIϵ(MM2) with six amino-terminal Myc epitope tags were prepared by cloning into pCS2-MT as described previously (12Gao Z.-H.

Protease inhibitor mixture tablets were obtained from Roche Applied Science. Lambda protein phosphatase was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. MBP-axin fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using amylose resin (New England Biolabs) according to the published protocol with minor modification (30Salic A. Lee E. Mayer L. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 523-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Cell Culture, Maintenance, and Transient Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and mouse L cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10% calf serum, respectively, and antibiotics (100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Cultures of cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For transient transfections, cells were seeded in 6-well dishes treated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma). Cells were transiently transfected when they reached 60-70% confluence using LipofectAMINE and PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunoprecipitation experiments 0.5 μg of the CKIϵ expression plasmids was transfected. The total amount of transfected DNA was adjusted to 1 μg with empty vector where necessary. Cells were lysed at 24 h post-transfection as described below. Cell Lysis and Immunoprecipitation—Prior to lysis, plated cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) was then added to cells. The cells were then mechanically sheared, and the lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Myc epitope-tagged proteins, CKIϵ(WT) and CKIϵ(MM2), were quantitatively immunoprecipitated from the lysates (0.5-1 mg of protein in total) with 4 μg of anti-Myc antibody (9E10). Rabbit anti-CKIϵ antibody UT31 was used where indicated (25Cegielska A. Gietzen K.F. Rivers A. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1357-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The protein lysates and antibodies were incubated in lysis buffer (0.5 ml final volume) for 1 h on ice to allow formation of antibody-antigen complexes. Immune complexes were then mixed with 25 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The isolated beads were then collected by brief centrifugation at 185 × g in a tabletop centrifuge and subsequently washed once each with lysis buffer, and lysis buffer lacking both SDS and dithiothreitol, and then twice in protein storage buffer/kinase buffer (10% sucrose, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 15 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA). CKI activity was determined as described previously except that MBP-axin was used as the substrate (28Liu F. Virshup D.M. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45393-45399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, kinase reactions containing immunoprecipitates and 18 pmol of MBP-axin were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in 40 μl of kinase reaction mixture (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 250 μm ATP) containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were terminated by adding 25 μl of hot 5× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The boiled samples were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences), visualized by autoradiography, and subsequently subjected to immunodetection of CKI. Quantification of 32P-MBP-axin bands was performed using a Storm 860 gel imaging system (Molecular Dynamics). -Fold activation of the kinase was normalized to the CKIϵ expression levels estimated by Western blotting analysis. The background kinase activity present in the absence of specific antibody was subtracted. Data are expressed as -fold kinase activation compared with that in vector-transfected cells. In the indicated experiments, immunocomplexes of CKIϵ from HEK 293 cells were incubated either with 500 μm ATP in kinase buffer or 200 units of lambda phosphatase in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MnCl2. Control reactions without lambda protein phosphatase or additional ATP were also performed. Dephosphorylation/phosphorylation reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. To stop the reactions, beads with CKIϵ were washed three times with protein storage buffer/kinase buffer. Kinase activity was measured as described above. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—HEK 293 cells were transfected as described above with expression plasmids for 4HA-CKIϵ without or with XWnt-8. Cells were lysed in 200 μl of hypotonic buffer (40 mm Tris, 4 μm okadaic acid), homogenized, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. Hypotonic lysates (25 μg) were diluted into IEF buffer (8 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 40 mm Tris, 0.2% Bio-Lyte 3/10 ampholyte (Bio-Rad) and used in active rehydration (12 h) of 7-cm ReadyStrip IPG Strips, pH 3-10. Samples were focused using a Bio-Rad Protean IEF Cell under the following conditions at 20 °C: rapid 250 V, 1 h; rapid 500 V, 1 h; slow 8,000 V, 1 h; rapid 20,000 V, 1 hr. Second dimension SDS-PAGE was performed in 4-20% gradient gels and subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-HA antibodies. Lef1-luciferase Reporter Gene Assay—200 ng of pCS2-CKIϵ(WT), pCS2-CKIϵ(MM2), or pCS2 empty vector was transfected into HEK 293 cells in 35-mm dishes along with 500 ng of TOPflash, 100 ng of pEV3S-Lef-1, and 25 ng of pCMV-β-Gal. At 46 h post-transfection, cells were harvested with lysis buffer (Dual-light kit, Tropix), and luciferase and β-galactosidase activity was measured with the Dual-Light kit and Microtiter Plate Luminometer (Dynex Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To standardize for transfection efficiency, the luciferase activities of all transfected cells were divided by the β-galactosidase activities. The -fold increase of Lef-1-dependent activity was defined by comparing the normalized level observed from cells transfected with pCS2. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. from two separate experiments. Xenopus Injections and Analysis of Phenotypes—Sense mRNA of CKIϵ(WT) and CKIϵ(MM2) was prepared with the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion) using linearized plasmid as templates. RNA was purified with RNAeasy (Qiagen). 0.5-1 ng of RNA was microinjected into the ventral side of four-cell stage embryos as described previously (12Gao Z.-H. Seeling J.M. Hill V. Yochum A. Virshup D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1182-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 33Li X. Yost H.J. Virshup D.M. Seeling J.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4122-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The embryos were scored 1 and 3 days after injection. Previous studies indicated that CKIϵ kinase activity could be regulated both in vitro and in vivo by intramolecular autophosphorylation of its carboxyl-terminal inhibitory domain (25Cegielska A. Gietzen K.F. Rivers A. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1357-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 26Rivers A. Gietzen K.F. Vielhaber E. Virshup D.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 45393-45399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Given the role of CKIϵ as a positive regulator of the Wnt pathway, we tested the hypothesis that Wnt signaling functions in part by activation of CKIϵ. HEK 293 cells, which retain many aspects of the Wnt signal transduction cascade, were transfected with a plasmid expressing XWnt-8. Endogenous CKIϵ was immunoprecipitated from lysates 24 h later, and kinase activity was assessed in the immunoprecipitate. As Fig. 1A demonstrates, XWnt-8 expression led to almost a 6-fold increase in kinase activity compared with vector-only transfected cells. Activation of CKIϵ was independent of the substrate used because it was seen with casein and recombinant axin and Dvl-1 (data not shown). Notably, CKIϵ activity immunoprecipitated from cells not expressing XWnt-8 was only 10% above the background activity obtained in the absence of immunoprecipitated kinase, suggesting that basal CKIϵ activity is low. Furthermore, XWnt-8 expression had no effect on the amount of CKIϵ immunoprecipitated, demonstrating that the activation of CKIϵ was due solely to an increase in the specific activity of the kinase. To analyze further the influence of Wnt signaling on CKI activity, we assessed the response of CKIϵ to the treatment of the cells with Wnt-3a-conditioned medium. Wnt-3a-conditioned medium induces the accumulation of β-catenin in mouse L cells (Fig. 1C) as described previously (31Shibamoto S. Higano K. Takada R. Ito F. Takeichi M. Takada S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 659-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Addition of Wnt-3a-conditioned medium to HEK 293 cells for 30 min prior to lysis increased CKIϵ activity severalfold compared with cells treated with control medium (Fig. 1B). Hence, both transfected and exogenous Wnt ligands are capable of activation of CKIϵ kinase. CKIϵ can be strongly inhibited by intramolecular autophosphorylation. Wnt signaling may activate CKIϵ by stimulating intracellular phosphatases to remove inhibitory phosphoryl groups. This model predicts that inactive CKIϵ immunoprecipitated from resting cells should be activated by phosphatase treatment and more importantly, that activated CKIϵ immunoprecipitated from Wnt-treated cells should be subsequently inactivated by reautophosphorylation. Finally, Wnt-regulated dephosphorylation of CKIϵ should be reflected in an appropriate shift in the isoelectric point of CKIϵ. To test these predictions, endogenous CKIϵ was immunoprecipitated from HEK 293 cells treated with either control medium or Wnt-3a-conditioned medium. Prior to the in vitro kinase assay, the immunoprecipitated CKIϵ immune complexes were preincubated in buffer alone or in buffer containing added ATP or protein phosphatase λ for 20 min. As Fig. 2A confirms, Wnt-3a activated CKIϵ (lanes 1 and 2). Furthermore, dephosphorylation of immunoprecipitated kinase led to its activation (lanes 5 and 6) to a level similar to that seen with Wnt ligand, consistent with previous reports (25Cegielska A. Gietzen K.F. Rivers A. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1357-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 28Liu F. Virshup D.M. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45393-45399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Most importantly, the activation of CKI by Wnt signaling was fully reversed when the immunoprecipitated activated kinase was allowed to reautophosphorylate during a preincubation with ATP (lanes 3 and 4). These data strongly suggest that Wnt signaling activates CKIϵ by stimulating dephosphorylation of its inhibitory domain. Isoelectric focusing was used to test directly whether the Wnt-induced increase in CKIϵ activity is accompanied by changes in the phosphorylation state of CKIϵ (Fig. 2B). A shift toward the basic end of the gel should be observed after removal of negatively charged phosphate groups. Wild type HA epitope-tagged CKIϵ migrates with an isoelectric point of ∼6, with a few less abundant species consistent with the existence of multiple phosphorylation states. Importantly, coexpression of XWnt-8 led to a marked shift of the CKIϵ to a pI of ∼7, consistent with the loss of one or more phosphoryl groups. Notably, most of the 4HA-CKIϵ was altered by the coexpression of XWnt-8, suggesting that the majority of the expressed kinase was dephosphorylated after Wnt signaling. If Wnt signaling activates CKIϵ by stimulating site-specific dephosphorylation, then a mutant form of CKIϵ, CKIϵ(MM2), which lacks inhibitory autophosphorylation sites, ought to be more active than CKIϵ in resting cells and not be further stimulated by Wnt signaling. To test this, HEK 293 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing Myc epitope-tagged CKIϵ or CKIϵ(MM2), and XWnt-8 or empty vector. CKI activity was measured after immunoprecipitation of the kinase with 9E10 monoclonal antibody specific for the Myc epitope. As Fig. 3A shows, overexpressed CKIϵ is activated by XWnt-8 expression (Fig. 3A, lane 1 versus lane 2), indicating that CKIϵ is a specific target of the Wnt pathway. CKIϵ(MM2) has significantly higher basal activity than wild type CKIϵ and is not activated further by coexpression of XWnt-8. Similar results were obtained when cells expressing Myc-CKIϵ or Myc-CKIϵ(MM2) were treated with Wnt-3a supernatant (Fig. 3B). To investigate the kinetics of CKIϵ activation, HEK 293 cells were treated with Wnt-3a-conditioned medium or control medium for different periods of time prior to lysis and immunoprecipitation-kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 4A, Wnt ligand activates endogenous CKIϵ after as little as 15 min with no further activation after 30 min. This observation suggests that CKIϵ activation is a direct downstream consequence of Wnt signaling and is not caused by long term activation or changes in downstream gene expression. To assess whether the activity of CKIϵ correlates with the presence of Wnt ligand, we also determined the rate of kinase inactivation following washout of Wnt-3a ligand. HEK 293 cells expressing CKIϵ(WT) and CKIϵ(MM2) were treated with Wnt-3a-conditioned medium for 30 min. The conditioned medium was removed and replaced either with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, or as a control, the conditioned medium. Kinase activity was then assessed at the indicated times. As demonstrated in Fig. 4B, washout of Wnt ligand was followed by a steady decline in CKIϵ activity, reaching base line after 90 min. CKIϵ(MM2) activity remained high throughout the entire washout period, consistent with the hypothesis that CKIϵ is inactivated by autophosphorylation as Wnt signaling decreases. The data suggest that Wnt signaling activates CKIϵ by transient dephosphorylation of carboxyl-terminal inhibitory sites on the kinase. CKIϵ(MM2), the CKIϵ mutant lacking inhibitory autophosphorylation sites, has a marked increase in kinase activity in the absence of Wnt ligand. If activation of CKIϵ is an important step in Wnt signaling, then we speculated that CKIϵ(MM2) might be more active than wild type CKIϵ in signaling to downstream molecules in the pathway. Activation of the Wnt signaling pathway leads to transcription from Lef-1/Tcf-responsive promoters. Therefore, to test whether loss of autophosphorylation of CKIϵ increase its ability to transduce Wnt signaling, we compared the ability of wild type and CKIϵ(MM2) expression to activate a Lef-1 reporter plasmid. As Fig. 5A shows, expression of CKIϵ and CKIϵ(MM2) caused a 3- and 6-fold increase in the Lef-1 reporter activity, respectively, indicating that CKIϵ(MM2) is more active than wild type kinase. Immunoblots showed the that wild type and mutant kinase were expressed to the same level (data not shown). This result suggests that activation of CKIϵ is an important step in the Wnt pathway. A second readily assayable consequence of Wnt signaling is induction of secondary dorsal axis during Xenopus embryogenesis. CKIϵ expression in ventral cells causes axis duplication and has been epistatically positioned to be downstream of Dvl and upstream of axin and PP2A (10Peters J.M. McKay R.M. McKay J.P. Graff J.M. Nature. 1999; 401: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 11Sakanaka C. Leong P. Xu L. Harrison S.D. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12548-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 12Gao Z.-H. Seeling J.M. Hill V. Yochum A. Virshup D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1182-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the loss of autoinhibition of CKIϵ would lead to constitutive rather than time-limited activation of Wnt and potentially additional CKIϵ-regulated signaling pathways. To test this, we microinjected the RNA encoding wild type or CKIϵ(MM2) into ventral cells of four-cell stage Xenopus embryos. As expected, ventral injection of wild type CKIϵ RNA induced the formation of ectopic dorsal axes (Fig. 5C). However, as Fig. 5D shows, microinjection of CKIϵ(MM2) RNA causes a distinct phenotype. The embryos microinjected with CKIϵ(MM2) RNA formed an ectopic axis, but the secondary axis was not fully developed. In addition, these embryos commonly had a shorter and bent tail and more prominent anterior structures. This distinct phenotype was only rarely seen at the highest dose of wild type CKIϵ expression. For scoring purposes, this phenotype was termed “extreme” (Fig. 5, B-D). Importantly, immunoblot of Xenopus embryos showed equal expression of CKIϵ and CKIϵ(MM2) (data not shown), demonstrating that the differences in development were caused by changes in kinase activity rather than kinase abundance. Thus, expression of CKIϵ(MM2) leads to increased transcription from a Wnt-responsive promoter and a distinctive Wnt-related phenotype in Xenopus embryogenesis, consistent with the hypothesis that regulation of CKIϵ activity is a critical element of normal embryogenesis. The dephosphorylation-mediated activation of CKIϵ by Wnt ligand implies that an intracellular phosphatase is upstream of CKIϵ. In vitro, PP1, PP2A, and PP2B (calcineurin) are all capable of dephosphorylating and activating CKIϵ (25Cegielska A. Gietzen K.F. Rivers A. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1357-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To test which of these phosphatases might mediate Wnt-induced activation of CKIϵ in vivo, HEK 293 cells transiently expressing Myc-CKIϵ or CKIϵ(MM2) were treated with Wnt-3a-conditioned medium followed by further addition for 30 min of the indicated phosphatase inhibitor prior to lysis and immunoprecipitation-kinase assay. Calyculin A inhibits both PP1 and PP2A, whereas cyclosporine A inhibits calcineurin (PP2B). Interestingly, addition of either inhibitor blocked Wnt reversed the activation of CKIϵ (Fig. 6). The effect of the inhibitors was specific because they did not inhibit CKIϵ(MM2). Overexpression of an unrelated serine/threonine phosphatase, PP2C, also stimulated CKIϵ activity. These data do not allow identification of the specific CKIϵ phosphatase but further support the model that Wnt signaling regulates CKIϵ activity via an intracellular protein serine/threonine phosphatase. CKIϵ and the closely related CKIδ are positive regulators of the Wnt signaling pathway, functioning downstream of Wnt and upstream of the APC·axin·GSK3·PP2A complex. The data presented here show that Wnt signaling results in both dephosphorylation of CKIϵ and a significant increase in CKIϵ kinase activity. CKIϵ activation is detectable within 15 min after the application of Wnt ligand, indicating that activation is a direct effect rather than the result of downstream changes in gene expression. CKIϵ activation is caused by dephosphorylation of its inhibitory carboxyl-terminal domain because 1) the isoelectric point of the kinase shifted toward the basic region after Wnt treatment; 2) Wnt-induced activation was reversed by reautophosphorylation and mimicked by in vitro dephosphorylation of CKIϵ; 3) a mutant CKIϵ that lacks inhibitory autophosphorylation sites was active and not further activated by Wnt, and 4) inhibition of cellular serine/threonine phosphatases blocked the activation of CKIϵ. Finally, activation of CKIϵ is biologically relevant because constitutively active CKIϵ was a more active regulator of transcription from a Wnt-responsive promoter and led to marked phenotypic differences in Xenopus development compared with wild type CKIϵ. Thus, although the CKI family has generally been considered to contain a group of constitutively active kinases, it appears that a subset of the CKI family, those with autoinhibitory domains, may be inactive in vivo until specifically activated. The data suggest that regulated activation of CKIϵ may be one mechanism to terminate a Wnt signal after ligand dissociates from its receptors. CKIϵ, unlike CKIα, appears to be inactive in vivo until specifically activated by dephosphorylation of its autoinhibitory domain. Following removal of Wnt ligand, kinase once again autophosphorylates and autoinhibits, and hence its activity returns to base line. The relatively slow decrease in kinase activity could be the result of slow dissociation of Wnt ligand from the cell surface or prolonged activation of the phosphatase that activates CKI. Signal-regulated time-limited activation of CKIϵ may be a general mechanism that regulates phosphorylation of additional substrates such as p53, the circadian regulators Per1 and Per2, and centrosome proteins (34Knippschild U.

Biol. 2000; 20: 4888-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The ability of CKI isoforms to interact specifically with a diverse array of scaffold-like proteins such as axin, Dvl, Per2, and AKAP450 may provide a mechanism to restrict the activated kinase to phosphorylate only a subset of substrates, i.e. those also interacting with the scaffold protein (37Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar). A similar function for axin-bound GSK3 in the Wnt pathway is well described (38Ding V.W. Chen R.H. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32475-32481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). For Wnt signaling to activate CKIϵ, it must somehow regulate a cellular serine/threonine phosphatase upstream of CKIϵ. In vitro and in vivo, diverse protein phosphatases have been shown to regulate CKIϵ autophosphorylation. For example, we have shown previously that CKIϵ can be activated in vitro by incubation with PP1, PP2A, and calcineurin, whereas in vivo, the glutaminergic pathway appears to turn on CKIϵ by activating calcineurin (25Cegielska A. Gietzen K.F. Rivers A. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1357-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 28Liu F. Virshup D.M. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45393-45399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). There is no evidence that calcineurin activation is involved in the canonical Wnt pathway, although Wnt-regulated calcium signaling has been described with Wnt-5 and other noncanonical Wnts (39Kuhl M. Sheldahl L.C. Park M. Miller J.R. Moon R.T. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 279-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). However, a number of other protein phosphatases have been shown to influence the Wnt-β-catenin pathway. PP2A has been shown to play both a positive and a negative role (reminiscent of the opposing roles of CKI isoforms), and PP2C interacts with Dvl and plays a positive role (33Li X. Yost H.J. Virshup D.M. Seeling J.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4122-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 40Seeling J.M. Miller J.R. Gil R. Moon R.T. White R. Virshup D.M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 2399-2403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Inhibition of CKIϵ activation by both calyculin A and cyclosporine suggests that intracellular CKIϵ may be regulated by diverse phosphatases in different pathways. When any one of the phosphatases is inhibited by exogenous compounds, the balance of autophosphorylation and dephosphorylation may be perturbed sufficiently to prevent kinase dephosphorylation and activation by physiologic stimuli. The extreme phenotype of the Xenopus embryos expressing constitutively active CKIϵ (CKIϵ(MM2)) raises the question of whether activated CKIϵ functions solely in the canonical Wnt pathway to stabilize β-catenin or whether sustained activation also causes changes in a number of other pathways. Forced expression of wild type CKIϵ may not have extreme consequences because the signals that activate it are lacking or tightly regulated. However, overexpressed constitutively active CKIϵ has the ability to alter additional diverse pathways outside of the Wnt pathway in the absence of external stimuli. Finally, the results from these studies indicate that CKIϵ is an additional example of a group of protein kinases including Cdks, GSK3, Src family members, and Raf-1, which are inhibited by phosphorylation and require dephosphorylation for signaling to occur. However, CKIϵ is inhibited by intramolecular autophosphorylation, whereas the other kinases require upstream kinases to regulate their activity. Taken together, the data support the conclusion that CKIϵ is a Wnt-regulated kinase that phosphorylates multiple substrates, including Dvl, APC, and Tcf-3, thereby stimulating β-catenin signaling by multiple mechanisms including, but not limited to, inhibition of GSK3 activity, dissociation of the β-catenin destruction complex, and stabilization of the β-catenin/Tcf-3 transcription factor.

Integrin signaling depends on the formation of organized sub-membrane complexes that comprise cytoskeletal, adapter, and signaling molecules. The identification of molecules that interact with the cytoplasmic domain of integrins has been the focus of research aimed to elucidating the mechanistic basis of integrin signal transduction. We have identified RanBPM as a novel interactor of the β2 integrin LFA-1 in a yeast-two-hybrid screen. In the same assay, RanBPM also interacted with the β1 integrin cytoplasmic domain. We demonstrate that RanBPM is a peripheral membrane protein and that integrins and RanBPM interact in vitro and in vivo and co-localize at the cell membrane. We find that RanBPM is phosphorylated on serine residues; phosphorylation of RanBPM is increased by stress stimuli and decreased by treatment with the p38 kinase inhibitor SB203580. Transfection of RanBPM synergizes with LFA-1-mediated adhesion in the transcriptional activation of an AP-1-dependent promoter, indicating that the two proteins interact functionally as well. We suggest that RanBPM may constitute a molecular scaffold that contributes to coupling LFA-1 and other integrins with intracellular signaling pathways.

Integrins constitute a large family of receptors that mediate adhesive interactions between cells or between a cell and the extracellular matrix. Early characterization of integrins focused on the physical link they provide between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton (1Tamkun J.W. DeSimone D.W. Fonda D. Patel R.S. Buck C.

However, it has become apparent that integrin adhesion receptors regulate many other fundamental biological processes as well.

Although the signal mediators activated by integrin engagement have been extensively characterized, the molecular mechanisms that link integrin receptors to the intracellular pathways are still under active investigation.

We have searched for proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic domain of the β2 chain with the yeast two-hybrid system. Here we report the identification of RanBPM/RanBP9 as a β2-interacting protein. RanBPM was originally cloned for its ability to bind the small GTPase Ran and was reported to localize to the centrosome, a microtubule organization center. The centrosomal localization of RanBPM has not been confirmed by a subsequent report, which describes a cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution for the protein in the human KB carcinoma cell line. Ectopically expressed RanBPM was recently shown to interact with different signaling proteins, including the Met receptor, and to cooperate in regulating intracellular signaling pathways (22Wang D.

Chem. 2003; 278: 49573-49581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 24Bai D. Chen H. Huang B.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 309: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In particular, overexpression of RanBPM was shown to induce activation of the Ras-Erk pathway and to activate transcription from the serum response element (22Wang D. Li Z. Messing E.M. Wu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36216-36222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, both the cellular localization of the endogenous protein as well as the function of RanBPM are still unclear, because additional roles for the molecule have been proposed, including one as a transcriptional regulator for steroid receptors (25Rao M.A. Cheng H. Quayle A.N. Nishitani H. Nelson C.C. Rennie P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48020-48027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We find that RanBPM interacts with LFA-1 in vitro and in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Endogenous RanBPM protein is widely expressed in cell lines and tissues and is present in different phosphorylation states. Although the unphosphorylated form is preferentially soluble in the cytoplasm, the phosphorylated form partitions to an insoluble fraction, associated with the cell membrane. We show that endogenous RanBPM also associates with the cell membrane in vivo, as demonstrated by immunohistochemical analysis of tissue specimens. Furthermore, we find that ectopic expression of RanBPM synergizes with LFA-1 signaling in the induction of AP-1-dependent transcription. In addition, our co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that endogenous RanBPM interacts in cells not only with β1 and β2 integrins, but also with several lymphocyte surface receptors. Based on these findings and on previously published reports, we propose that RanBPM may function as a scaffolding protein that coordinates signal inputs derived from cell surface receptors with intracellular signaling pathways. Interestingly, we found that the RanBPM expression pattern was altered in many human tumor specimens: loss of RanBPM activity in these tissues may reflect the dysregulation of signaling pathways that is characteristic of cancer growth. Two-hybrid Screen and Cloning of Ran-BPM and Vector Construction—The entire cytoplasmic domain of the β2 and of the αL chains of LFA-1 were fused to the GAL4-DNA binding domain (DBD) in the pAS1 vector (26Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). The constructs were tested for activation of a GAL4-dependent HIS3 and of a GAL4-dependent lacZ promoter in the Y153 and the YRG2 strains, in the presence of different concentrations of 3-aminotriazole (3-AT), as described (26Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). The baits did not exhibit any intrinsic activation function. Fusion protein expression was checked by Western blotting of yeast lysates with anti-GAL4-DBD antibodies. A human Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cell library (kind gift from Steve Elledge), fused to the GAL4 activation domain in the yeast pACT vector was used for the two-hybrid screening in the presence of 25 mm 3-AT. Out of two million transformants screened, ten positive clones were obtained and plasmid DNA was isolated and used to transform the Y153 and YRG2 yeast strains in the presence of the β2 cytoplasmic bait or of unrelated baits (αL cyt, p53, large T antigen, DNA polymerase α) to test the specificity of the interaction. Full-length RanBPM was obtained by screening of a teratocarcinoma (NT-D2) cDNA library in the Lambda-ZAP vector (Stratagene). Full-length RanBPM was subcloned into pcDNAI-Amp for transient transfection in mammalian cells. FLAG-RanBPM was obtained by inserting an oligo encoding the FLAG epitope at the 3′ end of RanBPM cDNA. In Vitro Protein-Protein Interaction Assay—GST-β2, GST-αL, and GST-p53 were obtained by subcloning the cytoplasmic domains of the αL and β2 chains or p53 into pGEX4T1 (Amersham Biosciences) (8Bianchi E. Denti S. Granata A. Bossi G. Geginat J. Villa A. Rogge L. Pardi R. Nature. 2000; 404: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). In vitro transcribed and translated RanBPM was obtained with the TnT-reticulocyte lysate system (Promega), in the presence of [35S]methionine and cysteine. In vitro binding was performed as described (8Bianchi E. Denti S. Granata A. Bossi G. Geginat J. Villa A. Rogge L. Pardi R. Nature. 2000; 404: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μl of labeled RanBPM was incubated with GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C, then washed twice with 40 volumes of binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 400 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40) and eluted with 25 mm glutathione. Eluted proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Cell Culture and Transfections—Cell lines were maintained in RPMI (lymphocytic cell lines) or DMEM media (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone). Cell lines included COS7 (monkey fibroblast-like), MDCK (Madin-Darby canine epithelial kidney cells), RIN-m (rat insulinoma cells), NIH-3T3 (mouse embryo fibroblasts), human umbilical cord endothelial cells, Jurkat (human acute T cell leukemia), A431 (human epidermoid carcinoma), HeLa (human cervix carcinoma), SK-BR3 (human breast adenocarcinoma), primary human fibroblasts, and murine B and human T cells. COS7 cells were transiently transfected with Fugene6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RanBPM Monoclonal Production—To generate antibodies against RanBPM, amino acids 146-729 were cloned into pGEX4T1. The recombinant protein was purified on glutathione-Sepharose, dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), and used to immunize mice. Anti-RanBPM antibodies were selected by their ability to recognize the antigen in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and transfected RanBPM in Western blots and in immunofluorescence assays. Cell and Tissue Lysates and Western Blot Analysis—To obtain total cell lysates, cells were lysed in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, plus Pefabloc-SC (Roche Applied Science) and spun in a microcentrifuge. Protein contents of the supernatant were measured by colorimetric reactions (Bradford method, Bio-Rad), and equal amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a membrane (Hybond-P, Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized with anti-RanBPM mAb. In the experiments shown in Figs. 3 and 4, lysis was carried out in the presence of a mixture of phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma). Tissues from 33-day-old C/57 female mice were homogenized in solubilization buffer (25% v/v of Tris-HCl, 0.5 m, pH 6.8, 2.5% w/v of SDS) at 100 °C and spun at 13,000 rpm for 20 min, and protein was quantified with a bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce).Fig. 4RanBPM associates with the cell membrane. A, hyperphosphorylated RanBPM partitions to the digitonin-insoluble fraction. Cytoplasmic fractions were obtained from T cells by extraction with digitonin. Remaining proteins were solubilized with high salt buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40. Samples on the right were exposed to osmotic shock for 30 min prior to extraction. Phosphatase inhibitors were present in all samples. Proteins were separated on a 7% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot with anti-RanBPM mAb. B, RanBPM is enriched in the membrane fraction. Jurkat cells were disrupted by mechanical lysis in hyposmotic buffer. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation, and membrane fractions were separated from cytoplasmic proteins by ultracentrifugation of the post-nuclear supernatants. Fractions were analyzed for RanBPM content by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. LFA-1, c-Jun, and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) were used as markers of membrane, nuclei, and cytoplasmic fractions, respectively (left panels). Peripheral membrane proteins were extracted from the membrane pellets by treatment with 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11, followed by ultracentrifugation. Na2CO3-soluble and -insoluble fractions were processed by 7% SDS-PAGE and blotted for RanBPM and for LFA-1 as a control for transmembrane proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Jurkat or COS7 cells were stimulated with anisomycin (50 ng/ml, Calbiochem), sorbitol (0.5 m, Sigma-Aldrich), PMA (100 nm, Sigma) for 30 min or exposed to UV light (160-250 μJ/cm2). p38 MAPK inhibition was obtained by treating cells with SB203580 (25 μm, Calbiochem) for 45 min, prior to UV exposure. COS7 cells (60-mm diameter dish) were transfected with either wild type JNK1 or phosphorylation-deficient JNK1α1 (kind gift by R. J. Davis (27Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar)). Samples were harvested 48 h after transfection. Metabolic Labeling and Pulse-chase Analysis—COS7 cells were transfected in 60-mm dishes with the expression vector pcDNAI-RanBPM. After 48 h, cells were starved for 1 h in DMEM without methionine-cysteine, supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS. Cells were pulsed with 200 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and cysteine (redivue Promix, Amersham Biosciences) for the indicated times. For chase experiments, COS7 cells were washed five times with PBS after pulsing and incubated with cold DMEM, 10% FBS for 2 or 3 h, as indicated. Sorbitol (0.5 m final) was added during the last 30 min of the pulse to the culture medium of osmotic shock-treated samples, samples were harvested in 150 μl of 50 mm Tris-0.5% SDS, boiled for 5 min at 95 °C, and adjusted to a final SDS concentration of 0.1% with RIPA correction buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.0125 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 1.25% Nonidet P-40, 1.25% sodium deoxycholate). Extracts were cleared by incubation with Pansorbin (Calbiochem) and used for RanBPM immunoprecipitation: extracts were pre-cleared by incubation with an irrelevant antibody for 1 h, followed by incubation with protein G-linked anti-RanBPM mAb for 90 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with RIPA correction buffer and analyzed by 7% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For alkaline phosphatase treatment (Sigma-Aldrich) samples were added with MgCl2 (1 mm final) and incubated at 30 °C with 100 units of enzyme for 20 min before immunoprecipitation. Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—COS7 cells were transfected with pcDNAI-RanBPM. 48 h later, cells were incubated (2 h at 37 °C) with 1.25 mCi of 32P/60-mm dish in 2 ml of phosphate-free medium. Osmotic shocked samples were exposed to 0.5 m sorbitol for the last 30 min of the labeling period. Excess label was washed with ice-cold PBS, and cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-0.5% SDS and treated with RIPA correction buffer and Pansorbin as above. Supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-RanBPM mAb. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Amersham Biosciences), and exposed to a radiographic film overnight. Labeled Ran-BPM was eluted from the membrane by treatment in 6 m HCl at 100 °C for 60 min and vacuum-dried. The pellet was dissolved in distilled water, separated by thin layer chromatography, as described (28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingstone R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene and Wiley, New York2000Google Scholar), and revealed by autoradiography. Subcellular Fractionation—To obtain cytoplasmic fractions, freshly isolated T cells were treated for 7 min on ice with digitonin (Sigma) containing buffer (0.005% digitonin in 90 mm KAc, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 25 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 12 mm glucose, and protease inhibitors). The digitonin-insoluble fraction was extracted with high salt (300 mm NaCl) and 1% Nonidet P-40. For membrane isolation, Jurkat cells were lysed by Dounce homogenization (buffer: 10 mm Hepes, pH 8, 250 mm sucrose, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors). Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min, and cytosol and membrane fractions were layered on a 0.5 m sucrose cushion and separated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min (4 °C). Peripheral membrane proteins were extracted by treating the membrane pellets with 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11, followed by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 60 min. After removal of solubilized proteins in the supernatant, insoluble membrane proteins were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Immunofluorescence and Immunohistochemistry—For immunofluorescence assays, adherent cells were cultured on glass coverslips, fixed in cold methanol (-20 °C, 5 min), followed by chloroform (-20 °C, 30 s). T lymphocytes were fixed in suspension and centrifuged on slides in a cytospin centrifuge. Cells were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 (3 min on ice) and incubated with anti-RanBPM mAb (5 μg/ml), followed by biotin-anti-IgG2a (Southern Biotechnology Associates) and Streptavidin-Cyanin2. LFA-1 was detected by mAb TS1.18 (anti-β2, IgG1), followed by fluorescein-goat anti-IgG1 (Southern Biotechnology Associates). All incubations were performed in PBS, 0.2% gelatin. Samples were analyzed with an MRC-1024 confocal microscope (Bio-Rad) or with an immunofluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Sections of frozen tumor and normal tissues were obtained from the Pathology Department of the San Raffaele Hospital. Sections were fixed in cold methanol/chloroform, blocked with 10% normal horse serum, and incubated with anti-RanBPM mAb (4 μg/ml) for 2 h at room temperature. Subsequent incubations were performed with reagents from the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector laboratories), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Color development was performed with either diaminobenzidine or 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (Vector Laboratories). Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted in 20% Mowiol (Fluka). Immunoprecipitation—Jurkat cells were lysed in 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40 with Complete protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Applied Science) and a phosphatase inhibitors mixture (Sigma) for 30 min in ice. 500 μg of total lysate was precleared with protein G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C and then immunoprecipitated for 2 h with 2 μg of antibody. Protein G-Sepharose was then added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, followed by elution in Laemmli buffer, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting. Immunoprecipitations were carried out using the following antibodies: anti-LFA-1 (TS1.18 and TS1.22), anti-integrin β1 (polyclonal β1-cyto) (29Tomaselli K.J. Damsky C.H. Reichardt L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1241-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), anti-CD3 (OKT3), anti-CD4 (S3.5), anti-transferrin receptor (5E9C11), anti-PKCβ I (C-16 sc-209, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For Western blot analysis the same antibodies were used, except for anti CD3 zeta (6B10.2 sc-1239, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-transferrin receptor (Zymed Laboratories Inc., 13-6800), and anti-integrin αL (610826 BD Transduction Laboratories). Reporter Gene Assays—COS7 cells in 35-mm plates were transfected in triplicate samples with an AP-1 luciferase reporter gene, a β-galactosidase reporter construct, RSVc-Jun, and either ICAM-1 or LFA-1 (αL plus β2) constructs with or without 1.5 μg of full-length RanBPM. After 48 h cells were detached by trypsinization and plated on either anti-ICAM-1 or anti-LFA1 antibodies immobilized on non-tissue-culture-treated plastic. Cells were stimulated for 2 h at 37 °C and lysed, and luciferase activity in lysates was analyzed following the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). β-Galactosidase activity was measured in the same samples (Roche Applied Science). Isolation of RanBPM and Interaction with LFA-1—To identify novel molecular intermediates of LFA-1 signaling, we used a yeast two-hybrid screen to search for proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic domain of the β2 chain of LFA-1 (β2cyt). The cDNA encoding the entire cytoplasmic domain of the β2 chain (amino acids 724-769) was cloned in-frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain (DBD) in the pAS1 vector and used to screen a GAL4 activation domain cDNA library derived from an Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cell line (26Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). We identified two independent, overlapping cDNAs that specifically potentiated activation of a GAL4-dependent reporter in the presence of the β2cyt-DBD fusion. Independent co-transformation of β2cyt and the candidate clones confirmed the interaction (Fig. 1A). The specificity was demonstrated by lack of interaction with other control fusions, including the cytoplasmic domain of αL chain of LFA-1 (αLcyt), SV40 large T antigen, TrkB, the p180 catalytic subunit and the p49 primase subunit of DNA polymerase α. (Fig. 1A and not shown). However, a bait construct consisting of the cytoplasmic domain of a highly related integrin, the β1 chain, also interacted with the candidate clones in the same assay. Sequencing of the cDNA inserts of the isolated clones revealed that they encoded a partial sequence of RanBPM/RanBP9, corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of the protein. This cDNA insert was used to screen a cDNA library derived from the NT-2 cell line and to isolate a 2829-bp cDNA clone, which comprised the entire open reading frame of RanBPM. Northern blot analysis showed that RanBPM transcripts were widely expressed, as reported previously (22Wang D. Li Z. Messing E.M. Wu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36216-36222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and were also present in total RNA derived from normal lymphocyte cultures (not shown). The full-length RanBPM clone was used to test the interaction with LFA-1 in an in vitro binding assay. In vitro transcribed and translated, 35S-labeled RanBPM specifically bound to β2cyt fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST), but not to GST alone, nor to other unrelated fusion proteins, such as the cytoplasmic domain of the αL chain fused to GST (GST-αLcit) or p53 (GST-p53, Fig. 1B). Characterization of the Endogenous RanBPM Protein: Constitutive and Signal-induced Phosphorylation—To date, most studies have been performed on ectopically expressed RanBPM: transfected RanBPM has been reported to distribute to the nucleus and the cytoplasm (30Nishitani H. Hirose E. Uchimura Y. Nakamura M. Umeda M. Nishii K. Mori N. Nishimoto T. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 272: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), however, the distribution and the properties of the endogenous protein have not been investigated in detail. To characterize endogenous RanBPM and its interaction with the LFA-1 receptor in mammalian cells, we generated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against recombinant RanBPM purified from E. coli. The anti-RanBPM mAb precipitated in vitro transcribed and translated RanBPM (Fig. 2A) and recognized a FLAG-tagged version of RanBPM transfected in COS7 cells (Fig. 2B, left lane). In addition, the antibody recognized a band of similar molecular weight in the untransfected cells, compatible with the endogenous protein (Fig. 2B, right lane). Consistently with the high degree of sequence conservation between murine and human RanBPM, our mAb recognized also the endogenous murine protein and detected RanBPM in all human and murine cell culture extracts (Fig. 2C) and in all murine tissue lysates analyzed (Fig. 2D). In several of these experiments, in addition to a major band, one or two higher molecular weight bands were recognized by the anti-RanBPM mAb. Prediction analysis of RanBPM sequence for protein motifs (Scansite Motif Scan, available at scansite.mit.edu/) revealed the presence of putative consensus sites for phosphory"
https://openalex.org/W2089913733,"Rabphilin and Noc2 were originally described as Rab3A effector proteins involved in the regulation of secretory vesicle exocytosis, however, recently both proteins have been shown to bind Rab27A in vitro in preference to Rab3A (Fukuda, M. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 15373-15380), suggesting that Rab3A is not their major ligand in vivo. In the present study we showed by means of deletion and mutation analyses that rabphilin and Noc2 are recruited to dense-core vesicles through specific interaction with Rab27A, not with Rab3A, in PC12 cells. Rab3A binding-defective mutants of rabphilin(E50A) and Noc2(E51A) were still localized in the distal portion of the neurites (where dense-core vesicles had accumulated) in nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells, the same as the wild-type proteins, whereas Rab27A binding-defective mutants of rabphilin(E50A/I54A) and Noc2(E51A/I55A) were present throughout the cytosol. We further showed that expression of the wild-type or the E50A mutant of rabphilin-RBD, but not the E50A/I54A mutant of rabphilin-RBD, significantly inhibited high KCl-dependent neuropeptide Y secretion by PC12 cells. We also found that rabphilin and its binding partner, Rab27 have been highly conserved during evolution (from nematoda to humans) and that Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila rabphilin (ce/dm-rabphilin) specifically interact with ce/dm-Rab27, but not with ce/dm-Rab3 or ce/dm-Rab8, suggesting that rabphilin functions as a Rab27 effector across phylogeny. Based on these findings, we propose that the N-terminal Rab binding domain of rabphilin and Noc2 be referred to as “RBD27 (Rab binding domain for Rab27)”, the same as the synaptotagmin-like protein homology domain (SHD) of Slac2-a/melanophilin. Rabphilin and Noc2 were originally described as Rab3A effector proteins involved in the regulation of secretory vesicle exocytosis, however, recently both proteins have been shown to bind Rab27A in vitro in preference to Rab3A (Fukuda, M.

Rab proteins comprise a large family of monomeric small Ras-like GTPases that are thought to regulate intracellular membrane trafficking in eukaryotic cells (reviewed in Refs. 1Zerial M. McBride H.

The appropriate GDP/GTP exchange cycle of Rab3A is required for Ca2+-regulated exocytosis to occur, and interaction of the GTP-bound form of Rab3A with effector molecule(s) is widely believed to be essential for this process. The first such protein identified was rabphilin, which specifically binds the GTP-bound form of Rab3A and is present on synaptic vesicles (9Shirataki H. Kaibuchi K. Sakoda T. Kishida S. Yamaguchi T.

However, recent evidence has indicted that rabphilin functions independently of Rab3A. First, analysis of rabphilin knock-out animals has shown no obvious genetic interactions between Rab3 and rabphilin in neurotransmitter release (23Schluter O.M. Schnell E. Verhage M. Tzonopoulos T.

Third, we very recently found that the Rab3 binding domain of rabphilin exhibits sequence similarity to the specific Rab27A/B binding domain (also called SHD, synaptotagmin-like protein (Slp) homology domain) of the Slp family (Slp1/Jfc1, Slp2-a, Slp3-a, Slp4/granuphilin and Slp5) (27Fukuda M.

All these observations strongly suggest that rabphilin and Noc2 function as Rab27 effectors rather than as Rab3A effectors, although the Rab27 effector function of rabphilin and Noc2 has never been elucidated in vivo. The Rab27 isoforms Rab27A/Ram and Rab27B/c25KG (43Nagata K. Satoh T. Itoh H. Kozasa T. Okano Y. Doi T. Kaziro Y. Nozawa Y.

In the present study, we report finding that rabphilin and Noc2 are recruited to dense-core vesicles through specific interaction with Rab27A, not with Rab3A, and regulate dense-core vesicle exocytosis in PC12 cells. We also show that only rabphilin·Rab27 interaction, not rapbhilin·Rab3 interaction, is phylogenetically retained in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila. Based on our findings, we propose that rabphilin functions as a Rab27 effector across phylogeny. Antibodies—Anti-Rab3A, anti-Rab8A, anti-Rab27A, and anti-rabphilin mouse monoclonal antibodies were obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-GFP (green fluorescence protein) rabbit polyclonal antibody was from Clontech Laboratories, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA).

https://openalex.org/W2010892317,"Fungal ammonia fermentation is a novel dissimilatory metabolic mechanism that supplies energy under anoxic conditions. The fungus Fusarium oxysporum reduces nitrate to ammonium and simultaneously oxidizes ethanol to acetate to generate ATP (Zhou, Z., Takaya, N., Nakamura, A., Yamaguchi, M., Takeo, K., and Shoun, H. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 1892–1896). We identified the Aspergillus nidulans genes involved in ammonia fermentation by analyzing fungal mutants. The results showed that assimilatory nitrate and nitrite reductases (the gene products of niaD and niiA) were essential for reducing nitrate and for anaerobic cell growth during ammonia fermentation. We also found that ethanol oxidation is coupled with nitrate reduction and catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenase, coenzyme A (CoA)-acylating aldehyde dehydrogenase, and acetyl-CoA synthetase (Acs). This is similar to the mechanism suggested in F. oxysporum except A. nidulans uses Acs to produce ATP instead of the ADP-dependent acetate kinase of F. oxysporum. The production of Acs requires a functional facA gene that encodes Acs and that is involved in ethanol assimilation and other metabolic processes. We purified the gene product of facA (FacA) from the fungus to show that the fungus acetylates FacA on its lysine residue(s) specifically under conditions of ammonia fermentation to regulate its substrate affinity. Acetylated FacA had higher affinity for acetyl-CoA than for acetate, whereas non-acetylated FacA had more affinity for acetate. Thus, the acetylated variant of the FacA protein is responsible for ATP synthesis during fungal ammonia fermentation. These results showed that the fungus ferments ammonium via coupled dissimilatory and assimilatory mechanisms. Fungal ammonia fermentation is a novel dissimilatory metabolic mechanism that supplies energy under anoxic conditions.

Most eukaryotic organisms obligatorily use oxygen (O2) as a substrate for respiration and produce energy required for their biological activities and cell proliferation. Therefore, O2 depletion is critical for their survival. Such organisms induce the expression of a set of genes to allow adaptation to anaerobic circumstances. Some lower eukaryotes such as yeasts and filamentous fungi induce these genes under anaerobic conditions to produce O2-independent energy-producing metabolic mechanisms that support facultative anaerobic growth (1Zitomer R.S.

This is in sharp contrast to higher eukaryotes that essentially require O2. Nitrate respiration and ammonia fermentation are examples of such mechanisms that are distributed among filamentous fungi (2Kobayashi M. Matsuo Y. Takimoto A. Suzuki S. Maruo F. Shoun H. J. Bio.

This is unusual, because these metabolic mechanisms had been, respectively, identified in facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria and not in eukaryotic cells. Subsequent studies revealed that these fungi adapt to changes of environmental O2 tension via these mechanisms along with O2 respiration (6Zhou Z. Takaya N. Sakairi M.A.C. Shoun H. Arch.

The fungus Fusarium oxysporum respires with nitrate under O2-limited conditions through the sequential reactions of dissimilatory nitrate reductase (2Kobayashi M. Matsuo Y. Takimoto A. Suzuki S.

NO3-→NO2-→NO→N2OReaction 1 NO3-→NO2-→NH4+Reaction 2 These enzymes are located in mitochondria and are considered physiologically significant for producing ATP through the respiratory electron transfer chain (2Kobayashi M.

Takaya N. Shoun H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 31: 579-586Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). F. oxysporum ferments ammonia under more anoxic conditions than nitrate respiration (5Zhou Z. Takaya N. Nakamura A. Yamaguchi M. Takeo K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1892-1896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Ammonia fermentation consists of the dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to ammonium (Reaction 2) coupled with the catabolic oxidation of electron donors (ethanol) to acetate and substrate-level phosphorylation that supports growth under anaerobic conditions. Furthermore, 15 of 17 tested fungal strains fermented ammonium under anaerobic conditions (5Zhou Z. Takaya N. Nakamura A. Yamaguchi M. Takeo K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1892-1896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), suggesting that this activity is widely distributed among fungi. Microorganisms metabolize nitrate via assimilatory and dissimilatory reductive pathways. Bacteria usually regulate these pathways independently and produce respective enzymes that catalyze these reactions (10Zumft W.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 533-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar, 11Lin J.T. Stewart V. Adv. Microbiol. Physiol. 1998; 39: 1-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fungi also reduce nitrate to ammonium to assimilate nitrogen into their biomass. The nitrate-assimilating pathway in the fungus Aspergillus nidulans has been extensively studied (12Cove D.J. Biol. Rev. 1979; 54: 291-327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and assimilatory nitrate and nitrite reductases (encoded by niaD and niiA genes, respectively) located in the cytosol use NADH or NADPH (NAD(P)H) as an electron donor (13Johnstone I.L. McCabe P.C. Greaves P. Gurr S.J. Cole G.E. Brow M.A. Unkles S.E. Clutterbuck A.J. Kinghorn J.R. Innis M.A. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 111: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 14Campbell W.H. Kinghorn J.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 315-319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). These properties are quite different from those involved in nitrate respiration (2Kobayashi M. Matsuo Y. Takimoto A. Suzuki S. Maruo F. Shoun H. J. Bio. Chem. 1996; 271: 16263-16267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 7Uchimura H. Enjoji H. Seki T. Taguchi A. Takaya N. Shoun H. J. Biochem.

Rev. 1997; 61: 533-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar) but are similar to those in ammonia fermentation (5Zhou Z. Takaya N. Nakamura A. Yamaguchi M. Takeo K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1892-1896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Genes encoding the nitrate and nitrite reductases involved in ammonia fermentation remain unidentified. Therefore, the functional relevance between nitrate and nitrite reductases in the assimilatory mechanism and in ammonia fermentation should be identified. The original study of fungal ammonia fermentation used ethanol as a source of carbon and energy (5Zhou Z. Takaya N. Nakamura A. Yamaguchi M. Takeo K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1892-1896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Fungi use ethanol as a carbon source through the following processes (Reaction 3). Ethanol→acetaldehyde→acetate→acetyl-CoAReaction 3 Ethanol→acetaldehyde→acetyl-CoA→acetateReaction 4 The respective reactions of this ethanol utilization pathway of A. nidulans are catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh), 1The abbreviations used are: Adh, alcohol dehydrogenase; CoA, coenzyme A; Ack, acetate kinase; Acs, acetyl-CoA synthetase; Add, CoA-acylating acetaldehyde dehydrogenase; FacA, gene product of facA; FacAaero, FacA prepared from aerobically grown cells; FacAanaero, FacA prepared from anaerobically grown cells; FGSC, Fungal Genetic Stock Center. aldehyde dehydrogenase (Ald), and acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase (Acs), which are encoded by the alc-family genes (15Lockington R.A. Sealy-Lewis H.M. Scazzocchio C. Davies R.W. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 137-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), aldA (16Pickett M. Gwynne D.I. Buxton F.P. Elliott R. Davies R.W. Lockington R.A. Scazzocchio C. Sealy-Lewis H.M. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 51: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and facA (17Sandeman R.A. Hynes M.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 218: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), respectively. The generated acetyl-CoA is subsequently used to synthesize various cellular components. Acetyl-CoA produced by this pathway under aerobic conditions also enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle that supplies redox equivalents for O2 respiration and ultimately generates ATP. In contrast, ammonia fermentation by F. oxysporum uses another pathway to dissimilate ethanol (5Zhou Z. Takaya N. Nakamura A. Yamaguchi M. Takeo K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1892-1896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) (Reaction 4). The key enzymes of this pathway are the CoA-acylating aldehyde dehydrogenase (Add) that catalyzes acetaldehyde + NADP+ + CoA → acetyl-CoA + NADPH and acetate kinase (Ack) that catalyzes acetyl-CoA + ADP + Pi → acetate + ATP (5Zhou Z. Takaya N. Nakamura A. Yamaguchi M. Takeo K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1892-1896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, the molecular properties of the fungal enzymes remain obscure. Here, we identified ammonia fermentation activity in A. nidulans and investigated synthetic and naturally occurring mutations in genes of this fungus that might be involved in ammonia fermentation. We showed that the dissimilatory ammonia fermentation is obligatorily mediated by assimilatory nitrate and nitrite reductases. We also demonstrated that lysine residues of fungal Acs, which is required for ethanol and acetate utilization, are acetylated to catalyze the reverse reaction (acetyl-CoA-dependent ATP formation) during ammonia fermentation. These results showed that the fungus adapts to anaerobiosis by using assimilating enzymes for dissimilatory purposes. This study implies that the fungal assimilating and dissimilating reactions are intimately associated. Strains, Cultures, and Media—A. nidulans strains FGSC26 (biA1), FGSC89 (biA1; argB2), FGSC691 (biA1; niaD15), FGSC713 (yA2; pyroA4; niiA4), FGSC952 (biA2; alcR125), and FGSC283 (suA1adE20, yA2, adeE20; acrA1; galA1; pyroA4; facA303; sB3; nicB8; riboB2) were obtained from the Fungal Genetic Stock Center (FGSC, University of Kansas Medical Center). A. nidulans TZ13 (biA1; facA303) and TZ34 (biA1; argB2; facA303) were progenies of a genetic cross between strains FGSC89 and FGSC283. Conidia (108) were transferred to 500-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml of MMDN (1% glucose, 0.6% NaNO3, 10 mm KH2PO4, 7 mm KCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.2% Hutner's trace metals (18Barratt R.W. Johnson G.B. Ogata W.N. Genetics. 1965; 52: 233-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and aerobically incubated at 30 °C for 20 h (preculture). Resultant mycelia were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with 0.7% NaCl, and then inoculated into 500-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 300 ml of MMEN (100 mm ethanol, 10 mm NaNO3, 10 mm KH2PO4, 7 mm KCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.2% Hutner's trace metals). The head space in the flasks was replaced with argon gas by purging the air for 15 min, then the flasks were sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and incubated at 30 °C at 120 rpm to induce ammonia fermentation. Aerobic conditions were maintained by agitating 100 ml of NMEN medium in flasks sealed with cotton plugs but without replacing the head-space air. Either 50 mm fructose or 10 mm NH4Cl was added in some experiments. Growth of the auxotroph mutants was supported by adding the appropriate supplements according to the instructions provided by the FGSC. Preparation of Cell-free Extracts—After the strains were cultured, mycelia were collected by filtration, suspended in buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 0.6 m sucrose, 0.3 mm N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.3 mm leupeptin) and homogenized with aluminum oxide powder as described previously (8Nakahara K. Tanimoto T. Hatano K. Usuda K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8350-8355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 60 min, and the supernatant (cell-free extract) was centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 90 min to obtain the soluble (supernatant) and mixed membrane (pellet) fractions. Enzyme Assay—All reactions proceeded at 30 °C. We determined NADPH-dependent nitrate and nitrite reductase activity by measuring the amount of nitrite produced and changes in the absorption at 340 nm caused by NADPH, respectively (19Kurakov A.V. Nosikov A.N. Skrynnikova E.V. L'vov N.P. Curr. Microbiol. 2000; 41: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 20Jose M.V. Garret R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7980-7989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh), aldehyde dehydrogenase (Ald), and CoA-acylating aldehyde dehydrogenase (Add) were measured as described (5Zhou Z. Takaya N. Nakamura A. Yamaguchi M. Takeo K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1892-1896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Acetyl-CoA synthetase (Acs) activity was determined by a modification of the published method (5Zhou Z. Takaya N. Nakamura A. Yamaguchi M. Takeo K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1892-1896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) as follows. Soluble fraction or purified FacA was added to a buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 1.5 m KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 400 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm ATP, 1.5 mm CoA, 700 mm hydroxylamine HCl), and then acetyl-CoA production was colorimetrically monitored by measuring absorption at 540 nm as described (21Martinez-Blanco H. Reglero A. Fernandez-Valverde M. Ferrero M.A. Moreno M.A. Penalva M.A. Luengo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5474-5481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Soluble fraction or purified FacA was added to buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2), 5 mm AMP, 5 mm potassium pyrophosphate, 5 mm acetyl-CoA) to start the reaction that generates acetate. Thereafter, ATP production was measured using a Rucifel-250 kit (Kikkoman, Tokyo), and chemiluminometry (Lumitester K-210, Kikkoman, Tokyo) and high performance liquid chromatography confirmed acetate formation. Construction of the Plasmids—A DNA fragment encoding 6× histidine-tagged FacA (His-FacA) was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-ccgaattcatgcatcaccatcaccatcacagtggacggaccaattgccc-3′ and 5′-cctctagatgtatttgcctcgggaagcgtgcactgtggcgataattctc-3′ (restriction sites are underlined). The 3-kbp fragment was specifically amplified, blunt-ended, and inserted to the SmaI site of pUC118 to generate pFAC1. Plasmid pFAC2 was constructed by ligating the 3-kb EcoRI-XbaI fragment of pFAC1 into the same restriction sites of vector pSSH18. Plasmid pSSH18 was constructed by inserting the 2.2-kbp SalI fragment of the argB gene into the SalI site of pUC18. The plasmid pALD1 for generating the aldA knock-out mutant TK11 was constructed as follows. The 2.8-kbp DNA fragment corresponding to part of aldA was amplified by PCR using the primers, 5′-ccgaattcgcgagctcttcaacgtgttttc-3′ and 5′-ggatctgcagcatacgtgctttctg-3′ and digested with EcoRI and EcoRV. The 700-bp DNA fragment was purified and inserted into the EcoRI-SmaI site of pSSH18. The resultant plasmid was digested with SphI and PstI and ligated with the 750-bp DNA fragment corresponding to the 3′-part of aldA that had been prepared by PCR using the primers, 5′-cctgcatgctacggcactggttgg-3′ and 5′-ggatctgcagcatacgtgctttctg-3′ and digested with SphI and PstI. The PCR conditions were 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s (denaturation), 56 °C for 40 s (annealing), and 72 °C for 90 s (elongation) in reactions containing 1 μg of A. nidulans FGSC26 total DNA. We confirmed the nucleotides by sequencing the inserted fragments. Fungal Transformation—We transformed A. nidulans strains using standard procedures (22Rasmussen C.D. Means R.L. Lu K.P. May G.S. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13767-13775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A. nidulans TK21 and TK31 were obtained by introducing pFAC1 and pFAC2 into strains TZ13 and TZ34, respectively. Transformants were respectively selected according to restored absence of acetate utilization and arginine auxotrophic phenotypes. Prior to transformation, pFAC2 was linearized at its unique SacI site within the argB gene, and integration of the plasmid into the argB locus by a single crossover was confirmed by Southern blotting total DNA from TK31. We selected A. nidulans TK11 from the transformants obtained with FGSC89 and pALD1 and confirmed gene replacement. Preparation of Recombinant FacA—A. nidulans TK31 was cultured under conditions of aerobic and ammonia fermentation, and the soluble fraction was prepared as described above. A nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (bed volume, 3 ml, Qiagen) was equilibrated with buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate-NaOH (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl) containing 25 mm imidazole and washed with 50 ml of the same buffer. Protein was eluted through the column from the soluble fraction using the same buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. The fraction containing His-FacA was eluted through a Resource Q column (Amersham Bioscience) that had been equilibrated with 20 mm Tris HCl (pH 8.0) using a linear gradient of 0 to 0.5 m NaCl in the same buffer. The resultant fractions were gel-filtrated (Superdex™ 200HR, Amersham Biosciences) using 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 150 mm NaCl. Other Methods—Nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium were determined by ion exchange chromatography as described previously (5Zhou Z. Takaya N. Nakamura A. Yamaguchi M. Takeo K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1892-1896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Acetate and acetaldehyde were measured by high performance liquid chromatography as described (5Zhou Z. Takaya N. Nakamura A. Yamaguchi M. Takeo K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1892-1896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Ethanol was determined enzymatically using alcohol dehydrogenase and NAD+ as described (23Schimpfessel L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 151: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Dry cell weight was determined after drying the cells at 80 °C for 3 h. Purified proteins (1 μg) were Western-blotted using the ECL Western blot detection system (Amersham Bioscience) according to the instructions provided with the kit and a 1:1000-diluted anti-acetyl lysine antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). Transmission electron micrographs were obtained as described (24Yamaguchi M. Miyatsu Y. Horikawa Y. Sugahara K. Mizokami H. Kawase M. Tanaka H. J. Electron Micros. 1994; 43: 386-393PubMed Google Scholar) using a JEOL-1200 EX transmission electron microscope (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Anaerobic Ammonia Fermentation by A. nidulans—We showed that various species of fungi ferment ammonia under anaerobic conditions (5Zhou Z. Takaya N. Nakamura A. Yamaguchi M. Takeo K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1892-1896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), although the ammonia-fermenting activity of A. nidulans has not been described. We incubated anaerobic cultures of A. nidulans FGSC26 in the presence of 10 mm nitrate and 300 mm ethanol to examine its ammonia-fermenting activity (Fig. 1A). The culture consumed nitrate and produced ammonium over the incubation period, but little nitrite was detected. Of the consumed nitrate, 80% was metabolized to ammonium. The remaining 20% might have been converted to biomass, because nitrate was the sole nitrogen source for the culture. Ammonia production was accompanied by acetate formation at a 1:2 ratio throughout the incubation. This is consistent with the stoichiometry of the reaction products of ammonia fermentation by F. oxysporum that is described as: NO3- + 2 ethanol → NH4+ + 2 acetate (5Zhou Z. Takaya N. Nakamura A. Yamaguchi M. Takeo K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1892-1896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The nitrate-dependent growth of the culture in the absence of O2 (Fig. 1B) indicates that nitrate is critical for the anoxic cell growth of the A. nidulans. Because little N2O and nitrite was detectable during the culture, A. nidulans does not seem to respire using nitrate and thus cannot produce ATP through nitrate respiration unlike F. oxysporum (5Zhou Z.

This indicated that A. nidulans produces ATP through ammonia fermentation. Morphology of Mitochondria—Fig. 2 shows transmission electron micrographs of A. nidulans mitochondria. The number, size, shape, and membranous structure of the mitochondria did not significantly differ between cells producing ammonium anaerobically and those growing aerobically. However, the electron density of most mitochondria in the former was lower than that of the latter cells. These properties are typical of immature mitochondria in F. oxysporum that ferments ammonia (5Zhou Z. Takaya N. Nakamura A. Yamaguchi M. Takeo K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1892-1896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and are consistent with the notion that this anoxic ammonium formation of A. nidulans is a non-respiratory type of fermentation that generates cytosolic ATP (ammonia fermentation). Nitrate and Nitrite Reduction in Ammonia Fermentation—We determined the enzyme activity involved in nitrate metabolism through ammonia fermentation. The soluble fraction of cell-free extracts prepared from ammonia-fermenting A. nidulans FGSC26 exhibited significant NAD(P)H-dependent nitrate and nitrite reductase activity (Table I). Little activity was detected in the mixed membrane fraction (data not shown), which is consistent with the notion that ammonia is fermented in the cytosol but is not a respiratory product produced in mitochondria. Both NAD(P)H-dependent nitrate and nitrite reductases are specific under anaerobic (ammonia-fermenting) conditions (Table I), indicating that they contribute to ammonia fermentation. These properties are essentially similar to our previous observations of F. oxysporum that ferments ammonia (5Zhou Z. Takaya N. Nakamura A. Yamaguchi M. Takeo K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1892-1896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of mutations in the niaD and niiA genes (13Johnstone I.L. McCabe P.C. Greaves P. Gurr S.J. Cole G.E. Brow M.A. Unkles S.E. Clutterbuck A.J. Kinghorn J.R. Innis M.A. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 111: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) that encode assimilatory NAD(P)H-dependent nitrate and nitrite reductases, respectively, on ammonia fermentation by A. nidulans. Both enzyme activities disappeared in the respective mutants that produced neither ammonia (Fig. 3A) nor acetate (data not shown) under ammonia fermentation conditions, indicating that these metabolic reactions are coupled. Fig. 3A also shows that these mutations considerably repressed cell growth. Because we supplemented the culture medium with ammonium in addition to nitrate as an additional nitrogen source, the growth defect was caused by a loss of ammonia fermentation activity rather than a defect in assimilating nitrogen. These results unequivocally demonstrated that the fungus ferments ammonia by obligatory mediation via the gene products of niaD and niiA, which are assimilatory nitrate and nitrite reductases.Table IEffect of mutations on nitrate and nitrite reductase activity by A. nidulans Cells collected from the preculture were transferred to the MMEN medium, which contained 10 mm NaNO3 and 10 mmNH4Cl as nitrogen sources, and incubated under the anaerobic conditions for 12 h. Enzyme activity in the soluble fraction was measured by using NADPH as an electron donor.

We cultured fungal strains in the presence of ammonium and nitrate (Table I). The fungus normally represses expression of the genes for nitrate assimilation in the presence of ammonium (14Campbell W.H. Kinghorn J.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 315-319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 25Marzluf G.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 31-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and the undetectable nitrate and nitrite reductase activities in aerobic cells are consistent with this fact (Table I). Meanwhile nitrate and nitrite reductase activities were evident under conditions of ammonia fermentation, and they were apparently dependent upon niaD and niiA. This indicates that ammonium does not repress niaD and niiA under anaerobic conditions. Ethanol Oxidation Pathways in Ammonia Fermentation— We measured enzyme activities involved in the acetate-forming reaction by A. nidulans FGSC26 (Table II). Over 90% activity of all tested enzymes was recovered in the soluble fraction (data not shown), indicating their location in the cytosol. Activity of Add was induced under the conditions of ammonia fermentation like that in F. oxysporum (5Zhou Z. Takaya N. Nakamura A. Yamaguchi M. Takeo K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1892-1896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The acetyl-CoA-dependent ATP producing activity of A. nidulans requires AMP as a phosphorylation substrate. ADP did not support the activity. This activity is distinguishable from that of F. oxysporum, which produces ATP through ADP (5Zhou Z. Takaya N. Nakamura A. Yamaguchi M. Takeo K. Shoun H. J. Biol.

We report here a direct, high affinity interaction between InsP3R and ankyrin-B and demonstrate that this association is critical for InsP3R post-translational stability and localization in cultures of neonatal cardiomyocytes.

The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) 1The abbreviations used are: InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; Ig, immunoglobulin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; ANK, ankyrin repeat; MBD, membrane-binding domain; SBD, spectrin-binding domain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; WT, wild type; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 1The abbreviations used are: InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; Ig, immunoglobulin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; ANK, ankyrin repeat; MBD, membrane-binding domain; SBD, spectrin-binding domain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; WT, wild type; GFP, green fluorescent protein. is a large tetrameric calcium release channel localized to intracellular endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum (ER/SR) membranes. Gating of the InsP3R is controlled by local levels of InsP3 in response to receptor-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol lipids. Additionally, InsP3R-mediated calcium release is sensitive to increases in cytosolic calcium concentration (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4418) Google Scholar, 2Yang J. McBride S. Mak D.O. Vardi N. Palczewski K. Haeseleer F. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7711-7716Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Although the physiological role for InsP3R function is not clear in all tissues (i.e. cardiac muscle), calcium release from intracellular stores via the InsP3R generates spatially and temporally complex cytosolic calcium signals for a variety of calcium-dependent cellular functions, including secretion, intercellular communication, membrane transport, and synaptic plasticity (3Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Nature. 1998; 395: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar, 4Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6164) Google Scholar). InsP3Rs have been localized to specialized ER membrane domains (5Sharp A.H. McPherson P.S. Dawson T.M. Aoki C. Campbell K.P. Snyder S.H. J.

Binding to the Homer family of scaffolding proteins was thought to restrict InsP3Rs at specialized membrane sites (7Tu J.C. Xiao B. Yuan J.P. Lanahan A.A. Leoffert K. Li M. Linden D.J. Worley P.F.

However, mice with gene disruption of Homer 1, 2, and 3 show no difference in expression or cellular localization of InsP3R subtypes (9Shin D.M. Dehoff M. Luo X. Kang S.H. Tu J. Nayak S.K. Ross E.M. Worley P.F. Muallem S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Additionally, a number of biochemical studies have predicted roles for proteins in InsP3R localization, including protein 4.1N (10Zhang S. Mizutani A. Hisatsune C. Higo T. Bannai H. Nakayama T. Hattori M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4048-4056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and the Sec 6/8 complex (11Shin D.M. Zhao X.S. Zeng W. Mozhayeva M. Muallem S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1101-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of these interactions is currently unknown. To date, the only functional data regarding the localization of InsP3Rs comes from mice and rats with spontaneous gene mutations for the heavy chain of myosin Va. Both rodent models display abnormal transport of InsP3R to dendritic spines of Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum, resulting in defects in long term synaptic depression (12Takagishi Y. Oda S. Hayasaka S. Dekker-Ohno K. Shikata T. Inouye M. Yamamura H. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 215: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 13Miyata M. Finch E.A. Khiroug L. Hashimoto K. Hayasaka S. Oda S.I. Inouye M. Takagishi Y. Augustine G.J. Kano M. Neuron. 2000; 28: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). There is no evidence for a direct interaction of myosin Va with the InsP3R. Ankyrins are a family of membrane-associated proteins that interact with structurally diverse membrane proteins, including the Na/K-ATPase, Na/Ca exchanger, anion exchanger, voltage-gated sodium channels, and the L1 family of cell adhesion molecules (14Bennett V. Baines A.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1353-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Ankyrin also has been reported to bind to InsP3Rs (15Bourguignon L.Y. Jin H. Iida N. Brandt N.R. Zhang S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7290-7297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Joseph S.K. Samanta S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6477-6486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as ryanodine receptors, another ER calcium release channel (17Bourguignon L.Y. Chu A. Jin H. Brandt N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17917-17922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This laboratory identified the InsP3 receptor as a potential ankyrin-binding protein (18Davis J.Q. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 43Google Scholar). However, this interaction was not pursued due to minimal co-localization between ankyrins and InsP3R in brain. Two additional groups also independently reported ankyrin-InsP3R interactions in multiple cell types (15Bourguignon L.Y. Jin H. Iida N. Brandt N.R. Zhang S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7290-7297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Joseph S.K. Samanta S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6477-6486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, one group proposed that ankyrin associated with a site on the InsP3 receptor now known to be present on the luminal side of the ER (19Bourguignon L.Y. Jin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7257-7260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Because this site was not physiologically relevant, and because the proteins showed minimal co-localization, the in vivo significance of the ankyrin-InsP3R interaction was not clear. More recently, evidence for a physiological role for ankyrins in localization of InsP3Rs and ryanodine receptors has emerged from studies using ankyrin-B (+/-) and ankyrin-B (-/-) mice. Neonatal cardiomyocytes derived from ankyrin-B (+/-) and ankyrin-B (-/-) mice display abnormal localization and decreased expression of InsP3R as well as abnormal localization of ryanodine receptors (20Mohler P.J. Gramolini A.O. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10599-10607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 21Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S.

Buhusi M. Davis L. Reedy M. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 995-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Although mis-localization of InsP3R and ryanodine receptors in ankyrin-B (-/-) cardiomyocytes is restored by transfection of 220-kDa ankyrin-B cDNA into cardiomyocytes (20Mohler P.J. Gramolini A.O. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10599-10607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 21Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. DuBell W.H.

Nature. 2003; 421: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar), a direct link between ankyrin-B and InsP3R to date is largely circumstantial. We recently reported that an ankyrin-B loss-of-function mutation (E1425G) is the basis of human type 4 long QT syndrome, a cardiac arrhythmia associated with sudden cardiac death (21Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. DuBell W.H. Song L.S. Haurogne K. Kyndt F. Ali M.E. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Escande D. Marec H.L. Bennett V. Nature. 2003; 421: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Ankyrin-B (+/-) mice show a similar cardiac phenotype, and ventricular cardiomyocytes from these animals display elevated Ca2+ transients and catecholamine-induced extrasystoles (21Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. DuBell W.H. Song L.S. Haurogne K. Kyndt F. Ali M.E. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Escande D. Marec H.L. Bennett V. Nature. 2003; 421: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Levels of Na/K-ATPase, Na/Ca exchanger, as well as InsP3R levels are coordinately reduced at T-tubule/SR membranes of adult ankyrin-B (+/-) cardiomyocytes, whereas ryanodine receptors were unaffected (21Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. DuBell W.H. Song L.S. Haurogne K. Kyndt F. Ali M.E. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Escande D. Marec H.L. Bennett V. Nature. 2003; 421: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Significantly, the ankyrin-B E1425G loss-of-function mutation causes loss-of-activity in restoration of normal levels of Na/K-ATPase, Na/Ca exchanger, and InsP3R in neonatal ankyrin-B (+/-) cardiomyocytes (21Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. DuBell W.H. Song L.S. Haurogne K. Kyndt F. Ali M.E. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Escande D. Marec H.L. Bennett V. Nature. 2003; 421: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Here we report the first direct evidence for a physiological interaction between ankyrin-B and InsP3R with the demonstration that interactions between ankyrin-B are required for normal InsP3R localization and stability in mouse neonatal cardiomyocytes. Moreover, we have determined for the first time how ankyrins associate with membrane-associated proteins, mapping the InsP3R binding site on ankyrin-B to the divergent β-hairpin loop tips of consecutive ANK repeats. Ankyrin-B and InsP3R Constructs—GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B mutant constructs were made using standard molecular techniques and QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene). Loop mutations were designed to replace ANK repeat beta hairpin loop tip residues with two alanines. Mutants were sequenced and expressed in HEK293 cells to confirm full-length protein expression. The membrane-binding domain (plus residues of the spectrin-binding domain) of 220-kDa ankyrin-B (residues 1-958) was inserted into pGEX-6P1 for expression as a GST fusion protein. Metabolic Labeling/Pulse-chase Experiments—Neonatal cardiomyocytes were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium minus methionine for 2 h followed by a 1- to 3-h pulse period in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml) at 37 °C. Cells were washed and chased in normal media plus 2 mm methionine for defined times (up to 48 h). Detergent-soluble lysates were prepared and InsP3R was immunoprecipitated using affinity-purified pan-InsP3R polyclonal Ig. Equal counts were immunoprecipitated to correct for small variations in protein concentrations. InsP3R was quantitated for each time point by phosphorimaging. InsP3R/220-kDa Ankyrin-B Membrane-binding Domain Purification—InsP3R was purified essentially by the method of (23Maeda N. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) from bovine brain cerebellum. Protein G-conjugated Dynabeads were purchased from Dynal Biotech. Ankyrin-B membrane-binding domain (MBD) with the addition of the first 80 residues of the spectrin-binding domain (SBD) containing a monoclonal antibody epitope was expressed in bacteria and purified. Affinity-purified pan-InsP3R antibody was generated in rabbits against a bacterial-expressed cleaved fusion protein representing the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of InsP3R. In Vitro Binding Experiments—Protein G-conjugated Dynabeads were preloaded with anti-SBD monoclonal Ig followed by ankyrin-B membrane-binding domain. Ankyrin-B beads were incubated with increasing concentrations of 125I-labeled InsP3R in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaN3, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.2) for 2 h at 4 °C in a final volume of 60 μl. Pellets were washed and assayed for 125I in a gamma counter. Values for nonspecific binding were determined using beads lacking the ankyrin-B membrane-binding domain and were subtracted. The inset (in Fig. 2C) displays specific and control beads run on a PAGE gel and stained for protein with Coomassie Blue. Purified cerebellar InsP3R was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with ankyrin-B MBD at a final concentration of 100 nm for each protein in a final volume of 300 μl Binding Buffer (20 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaN3, pH 7.2). 0.5 μg of either monoclonal Ig against the ankyrin-B spectrin-binding domain epitope or control whole mouse Ig was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Protein G Dynabeads were added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 2 h. The Dynabeads were collected, washed, and dissolved in 5× PAGE, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on samples of pellets and supernatants. Gels were either stained from protein with Coomassie Blue (see Fig. 2A) or transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for Western blot analysis using an affinity-purified anti-InsP3R antibody (Fig. 2B). In Fig. 2, A and B, the lanes represent purified InsP3R (lane 1); purified ankyrin-B MBD (lane 2); specific binding (lane 3); Dynabeads with control mouse IgG (lane 4); Dynabeads lacking ankyrin-B MBD (lane 5); ankyrin-B MBD denatured by heating at 60 °C for 10 min and then placed on ice (lane 6). Neonatal Cardiomyocytes—Hearts from P1 or P2 mice were isolated, and cardiomyocytes from wild-type, ankyrin-B (+/-), or ankyrin-B (-/-) mice were cultured and transfected as described previously (20Mohler P.J. Gramolini A.O. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10599-10607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—Neonatal cardiomyocytes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and fixed in warm 4% paraformaldehyde (37 °C). Cells were blocked/permeabilized in PBS containing 0.075% Triton X-100 and 3% fish oil gelatin (Sigma) and incubated in primary antisera overnight at 4 °C. Following washes (PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100), cells were incubated in secondary antisera (Alexa 488, 568; Molecular Probes) for 8 h at 4 °C and mounted using Vectashield (Vector) and #1 coverslips. Images were collected by using a Zeiss 510 Meta confocal microscope (100 power oil 1.45 numerical aperture (Zeiss), pinhole equals 1.0 Airy Disc) using Carl Zeiss Imaging software. Both channels were collected on PMT3. Images were imported into Adobe Photoshop for cropping and contrast adjustment. Immunoprecipitations—Rat heart, brain, and lung lysates were prepared as described (21Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. DuBell W.H. Song L.S. Haurogne K. Kyndt F. Ali M.E. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Escande D. Marec H.L. Bennett V. Nature. 2003; 421: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Only ∼50-60% of 220-kDa ankyrin-B and ∼40% of InsP3R was solubilized using this protocol. Detergent-soluble lysate fractions were bound to affinity-purified Ig bound to Protein A/G-Sepharose. Beads were washed to prevent nonspecific associations, and bound protein was eluted and analyzed by quantitative Western blot analysis using 125I Protein A and phosphorimaging. Statistics—When appropriate, data were analyzed using two-tailed Student's t test, and values less than p < 0.05 were considered significant. Values are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Ankyrin-B Co-immunoprecipitates with Multiple InsP3R Subtypes—We performed co-immunoprecipitations from adult rat tissues to determine whether potential ankyrin-B interactions are restricted to specific InsP3R subtypes. Affinity-purified polyclonal Ig against ankyrin-B co-immunoprecipitated a significant fraction (10-20%) of total soluble InsP3R from detergent-soluble lysates of adult rat brain, heart, and lung (Fig. 1A). Conversely, pan-InsP3R affinity-purified Ig co-immunoprecipitated a small but significant fraction (∼5%) of total soluble 220-kDa ankyrin-B from the same detergent-soluble tissue lysates (Fig. 1B). The predominant isoforms of InsP3R expressed in brain, heart, and lung are type 1, type 2, and type 3, respectively (24Inoue T. Kato K. Kohda K. Mikoshiba K. J.

Therefore, ankyrin-B associates with multiple InsP3R isoforms in brain, lung, and heart, likely due to a binding site conserved between InsP3R subtypes. One caveat to these results is that we detected InsP3R using pan-InsP3R antibody. Therefore, it is a formal possibility that even though a single InsP3R subtype is predominant in a tissue, we have detected a large fraction of a minor InsP3R isoform. Recombinant Ankyrin-B Membrane-binding Domain Binds to Purified Cerebellar InsP3R—We next characterized the interaction between the ankyrin-B and InsP3R using purified proteins. Recombinant ankyrin-B membrane-binding domain (residues 1-958) isolated from bacteria as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was immobilized on magnetic Dynabeads using an affinity-purified monoclonal Ig directed against the C terminus of the expressed protein (residues 922-938). InsP3R was purified from cerebellum (type 1) and 125I-labeled for binding (see “Materials and Methods”). Immobilized ankyrin-B membrane-binding domain (MBD) associated with 125I-labeled InsP3R purified from cerebellum with an affinity of ∼2 nm (Fig. 2, C and D). Minimal 125I-labeled InsP3R binding was detected with control Ig alone (Fig. 2, A and B). Moreover, InsP3R did not associate with the Dynabeads alone (Fig. 2, A and B). Additionally, no interaction between ankyrin-B and InsP3R was observed when the ankyrin-B membrane-binding domain was heat-denatured (heated to 65 °C; Fig. 2, A and B). The low binding stoichiometry observed in this assay (maximum capacity of 0.1 mol of InsP3R per mole of ankyrin-B) may be due to steric hindrance due to the large size of InsP3R tetramers, or simultaneous binding of InsP3R to more than one immobilized ankyrin-B membrane-binding domain. Alternatively, a population of the ankyrin-B membrane-binding domain may have been inactive. However, from these data we can conclude that association of InsP3R and ankyrin-B in rat tissues (Fig. 1) is mediated by a high-affinity direct interaction between the InsP3R and the ankyrin-B membrane-binding domain (Fig. 2). InsP3R-Ankyrin-B Interaction Requires Tips of β-Hairpin Loops of ANK Repeats 22-24—We used an alanine-scanning mutagenesis approach to determine the site(s) on ankyrin-B membrane-binding domain responsible for interaction with InsP3R. We constructed full-length GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B mutants based on the recent crystal structure of ankyrin-R membrane-binding domain as well as the known binding characteristics of other ANK repeat-containing proteins (32Michaely P. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Anderson R.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6387-6396Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 33Sedgwick S.G. Smerdon S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 311-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). ANK repeats of the membrane-binding domain fold as two antiparallel pairs of α-helices connected by a β-hairpin loop motif (33Sedgwick S.G. Smerdon S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 311-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). The α-helical pairs stack to form a form a superhelix (∼360° turn for 24 repeats of full-length ankyrins) around a large central cavity (see Fig. 5 (32Michaely P. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Anderson R.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6387-6396Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar)). We initially constructed GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B mutants in which each of 24 ANK repeat β-hairpin loop tip residues were substituted with two alanines (Fig. 3A). The rationale for this selection was that loop tips of the ANK repeat β-hairpins are variable between repeats, face the solvent, should not be required for folding, and have been implicated in protein interactions in some ANK repeat-containing proteins (33Sedgwick S.G. Smerdon S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 311-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B was expressed in HEK293 cells, immobilized using affinity-purified polyclonal GFP Ig, and incubated with purified cerebellar InsP3R (see “Materials and Methods”). Nonspecific binding was reduced by washes, and bound InsP3R was eluted. Bound InsP3R was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and quantitative Western blot analysis using an affinity-purified polyclonal InsP3R Ig. A second gel was used to quantify GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B or mutant GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B expression. InsP3R bound to mutated GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B was corrected for relative GFP expression and compared with binding to wild-type GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B. We observed no difference in binding of InsP3R to any of the 220-kDa ankyrin-B mutants of individual β-hairpin loops of ANK repeats 1-24 compared with wild-type GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B (Fig. 3, B and C). We next created GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B mutants with consecutive β-hairpin loop tip mutations (i.e. repeats 5-6, 4-6, 3-6, 2-6, and 1-6 in four sets of six ANK repeats 1-6, 7-12, 13-18, and 19-24; Fig. 4A). Mutation of six consecutive β-hairpin loops of repeats 1-6, 7-12, and 13-18 also had no effect on binding to the InsP3R (Fig. 4C). Mutation to consecutive ANK repeat β-hairpin loop tips in repeats 19-24 abolished interactions with purified cerebellar InsP3R (Fig. 4, B and C). In fact, mutation of ANK repeat 22-24 β-hairpin loop tips was sufficient to nearly eliminate InsP3R interactions (Fig. 4, B and C). These results suggest that the tips of β-hairpin loops 22-24 of ankyrin-B provide an interaction surface for direct contact with InsP3R (Fig. 5). Although our previous results (Fig. 2) would argue otherwise, a caveat to these experiments is that since GFP-ankyrin-B was immunoisolated from cell lysates, we cannot formally rule out the possibility that an intermediate protein was involved in the GFP-ankyrin-B/InsP3R interaction and therefore the interaction may not be direct. Nonetheless, these experiments provide the first detailed insight into sites on ankyrin involved in binding to a membrane protein. Loss of Ankyrin-B-InsP3R Interaction Leads to Mis-localization of InsP3R in Cardiomyocytes—Decreased expression and mis-localization of InsP3R in ankyrin-B (+/-) and ankyrin-B (-/-) neonatal cardiomyocytes can be rescued by transfection with GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B cDNA (20Mohler P.J. Gramolini A.O. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10599-10607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We used the loss-of-binding mutants of 220-kDa ankyrin-B to determine whether direct interactions with ankyrin-B are required for normal localization of InsP3R. Compared with wild-type cardiomyocytes (Fig. 6A), ankyrin-B (-/-) cardiomyocytes display reduced spontaneous contraction rates, abnormal Ca2+ dynamics, and mis-sorting of InsP3R (Fig. 6B) (20Mohler P.J. Gramolini A.O. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10599-10607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 21Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S.

These abnormal phenotypes can be rescued by transfection of GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B (Fig. 6C (20Mohler P.J. Gramolini A.O. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10599-10607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 21Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. DuBell W.H. Song L.S. Haurogne K.

We transfected GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B mutants, which had multiple alanine substitutions at β-hairpin loop tips (Fig. 4A) into ankyrin-B (-/-) cardiomyocytes and analyzed the expression and localization of GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B mutants and InsP3R. All GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B mutants were localized the same as endogenous ankyrin-B and wild-type GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B (Fig. 6, D-F). Thirteen GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B mutants rescued InsP3R expression and localization, but five non-binding mutants (GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B R23-24, R22-24, R21-24, R20-24, and R19-24), representing mutations to repeats 19-24 (Fig. 4C), were unable to rescue abnormal InsP3R expression and localization (Fig. 6, D-F). Therefore, ankyrin-B association is required for normal InsP3R expression and localization in neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes. Because these experiments were performed in vivo, we cannot rule out the possibility that an intermediate protein was involved in the ankyrin-B β-hairpin loop tip interaction with InsP3R. Interaction with Ankyrin-B Increases InsP3R Stability in Neonatal Cardiomyocytes—Decreased InsP3R expression in ankyrin-B (+/-) and ankyrin-B (-/-) tissues (21Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. DuBell W.H. Song L.S. Haurogne K. Kyndt F. Ali M.E. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Escande D. Marec H.L. Bennett V.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 995-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) is the result of a post-translational event, because Northern blot analyses show no difference in InsP3R mRNA levels between wild-type and ankyrin-B (+/-) heart (21Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. DuBell W.H. Song L.S. Haurogne K. Kyndt F. Ali M.E. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Escande D. Marec H.L. Bennett V. Nature. 2003; 421: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). We therefore measured the half-life of InsP3R in neonatal cardiomyocytes derived from wild-type, ankyrin-B (+/-), and ankyrin-B (-/-) mice to determine whether ankyrin-B is required for InsP3R stability. Primary cardiomyocytes were labeled with [35S]methionine and chased for defined time intervals (see “Materials and Methods”). Following each chase period, cells were lysed, protein was solubilized, and InsP3R was immunoprecipitated using pan-InsP3R affinity-purified Ig and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. The half-life of InsP3R is ∼11.7 h in wild-type neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes (Fig. 7, triangles). Reduction of ankyrin-B in ankyrin-B (+/-) or ankyrin-B (-/-) primary neonatal cardiomyocytes leads to a significant reduction in InsP3R half-life. Significantly, InsP3R half-life was reduced to 4.6 h in ankyrin-B (+/-) cells (Fig. 7; open squares, p < 0.05). InsP3R half-life in ankyrin-B (-/-) cells was 3.7 h (Fig. 7; closed circles, p < 0.05), similar to the half-life observed in ankyrin-B (+/-) cardiomyocytes. Ankyrin-B levels therefore regulate post-translational stability of the InsP3R in neonatal cardiomyocytes. Additionally, reduction of only ∼50% of 220-kDa ankyrin-B produces nearly the same effect on InsP3R stability as complete loss of 220-kDa ankyrin-B. We next determined whether interactions with ankyrin-B are required for InsP3R stability. Ankyrin-B (+/-) neonatal cardiomyocytes transfected with GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B or mutated GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B (loop tips 19-24 to alanine, does not associate with purified InsP3R; Fig. 4, B and C) were metabolically labeled and chased, and the InsP3R half-life was determined. Wild-type GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B rescued InsP3R stability to near normal levels in ankyrin-B (+/-) cardiomyocytes (11.7 versus 11.0 h; Fig. 8, n = 3; NS). However, transfection of ankyrin-B (+/-) cells with mutant GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B R19-24 (Fig. 4, C and D) was unable to restore InsP3R half-life to normal levels (11.7 versus 4.4 h; Fig. 8, n = 3; p < 0.05), even though the mutant GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B was expressed at normal levels and localized as GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B. Because these experiments were performed in vivo, we cannot rule out the possibility that an intermediate protein was involved in the ankyrin-B β-hairpin loop tip interaction with InsP3R. However, these results clearly demonstrate that ankyrin-B contributes to post-translational stability of the InsP3R through association with InsP3R. We report a direct, high affinity interaction between ankyrin-B and InsP3 receptor isoforms and demonstrate that ankyrin-B is critical for InsP3R post-translational stability and localization in primary cardiomyocytes. These new results provide the first physiological evidence of a molecular partner required for localization of InsP3R to an ER membrane domain. Furthermore, using an alanine-scanning mutagenesis strategy we determined that multiple consecutive beta-hairpin loop tips are required for InsP3R interaction, thus providing the first detailed evidence of how ankyrin polypeptides associate with membrane proteins. A puzzle remains that the majority of ankyrin-B and InsP3R do not co-localize in neonatal cardiomyocytes. The major population of ankyrin-B is over the M-line in cardiomyocytes, whereas InsP3R localize at the Z-line (Fig. 6A). One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that ankyrin-B is in large excess over the InsP3R, and a subpopulation of ankyrin-B actually is co-localized with the InsP3R. Given that InsP3R are assembled into tetramers, only one ankyrin-B per four InsP3R subunits would be sufficient for a complex, but might be difficult to detect by immunofluorescence. In support of an ankyrin-B-InsP3R complex is that ankyrin-B and InsP3R do co-immunoprecipitate from tissue extracts of heart (Fig. 1). Moreover, a subpopulation of ankyrin-B is co-localized with InsP3R at T-tubule sites in adult cardiomyocytes (21Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. DuBell W.H. Song L.S. Haurogne K. Kyndt F. Ali M.E. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Escande D. Marec H.L. Bennett V. Nature. 2003; 421: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). The functional importance of this subpopulation of ankyrin-B is underscored by the finding that loss of the T-tubule-associated ankyrin-B in ankyrin-B (+/-) cardiomyocytes is accompanied by substantial loss of InsP3R (21Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. DuBell W.H. Song L.S. Haurogne K. Kyndt F. Ali M.E. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Escande D. Marec H.L. Bennett V. Nature. 2003; 421: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). The binding site on the InsP3R that interacts with ankyrin-B remains to be identified. A previous study using InsP3R purified from T-lymphoma cells proposed that ankyrin associates with InsP3R at a site selected based on limited sequence similarity to an ankyrin-binding region in CD44 (19Bourguignon L.Y. Jin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7257-7260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, it now is clear that ankyrin-binding proteins do not have conserved sequence motifs (14Bennett V. Baines A.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1353-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Moreover, further characterization of InsP3R membrane topology revealed that this site is located to the lumen of the ER and therefore could not associate with the cytosolic ankyrin in vivo. The ankyrin-B-binding site on the InsP3R is likely a conserved motif on all three receptor subtypes, because all three major isoforms of InsP3R appear to associate with ankyrin-B and all are reduced in tissues of ankyrin-B (+/-) mice (data not shown). Although the functional role of InsP3R calcium-induced calcium release in excitation-contraction coupling is unclear, the interaction of ankyrin-B with InsP3R provides a potential mechanism to couple InsP3R-enriched domains of the ER to membrane proteins in the plasma membrane. Studies with anion exchanger and neurofascin have demonstrated that ankyrins are capable of binding multiple proteins at once (34Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31298-31302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 35Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22050-22057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The ankyrin-B-InsP3R interaction requires a relatively small region (repeats 21-24) on the ankyrin-B membrane-binding domain (Fig. 5). Therefore, a majority of the ankyrin-B membrane-binding domain is accessible to accommodate potentially multiple additional protein partners. Plasma membrane proteins that associate with ankyrin-B and are candidates to be coupled to InsP3R through ankyrin-B include the Na/K-ATPase and Na/Ca exchanger (21Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. DuBell W.H. Song L.S. Haurogne K. Kyndt F. Ali M.E. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Escande D. Marec H.L. Bennett V. Nature. 2003; 421: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). It is of interest in this regard that ankyrin-B (+/-) cardiomyocytes exhibit coordinate loss of Na/K-ATPase, Na/Ca exchanger of T-tubules (specialized extensions of the plasma membrane) accompanied by loss of InsP3R from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (a domain of the endoplasmic reticulum (21Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. DuBell W.H. Song L.S. Haurogne K. Kyndt F. Ali M.E. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Escande D. Marec H.L. Bennett V. Nature. 2003; 421: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar)). Sarcoplasmic reticulum-derived Ca2+ transients are elevated in ankyrin-B (+/-) cardiomyocytes (21Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. DuBell W.H. Song L.S. Haurogne K. Kyndt F. Ali M.E. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Escande D. Marec H.L. Bennett V. Nature. 2003; 421: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar), suggesting that Ca2+ levels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum also are elevated in the absence of ankyrin-B-coupled proteins. These data are consistent with a role of ankyrin-B-coupled InsP3R in export of Ca2+ from the SR through ankyrin-B-coupled Na/Ca exchanger and Na/K-ATPase located in the plasma membrane. Cardiomyocytes are excitable cells and experience repetitive events of extracellular Ca2+ entry through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. In contrast, excitation-contraction coupling in both skeletal and smooth muscle does not require extracellular Ca2+ and is regulated by Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Interestingly, smooth muscle and skeletal muscle also do not require ankyrin-B-dependent pathways for localization of InsP3R. 2P. J. Mohler, J. Q. Davis, L. H. Davis, J. A. Hoffman, P. Michaely, and V. Bennett, unpublished observations. In fact, ankyrin-B is not expressed in smooth muscle, 2P. J. Mohler, J. Q. Davis, L. H. Davis, J. A. Hoffman, P. Michaely, and V. Bennett, unpublished observations. and ankyrin-B is not localized with InsP3R at intracellular T-tubule/SR junctions in skeletal muscle. 2P. J. Mohler, J. Q. Davis, L. H. Davis, J. A. Hoffman, P. Michaely, and V. Bennett, unpublished observations. These considerations suggest ankyrin-B-coupled InsP3R is an adaptation of excitable cardiomyocytes with repetitive events of extracellular entry and export of calcium.

Circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrated different secondary structures of these TnT mutants. Each of the recombinant HCTnTs was incorporated into porcine skinned fibers along with human cardiac troponin I (HCTnI) and troponin C (HCTnC), and the Ca2+ dependent isometric force development of these troponin-replaced fibers was determined at pH 7.0 and 6.5. All eight mutants altered the contractile properties of skinned cardiac fibers. E244D potentiated the maximum force development without changing Ca2+ sensitivity. In contrast, the other seven mutants increased the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development but not the maximal force. R92L, R92W, and R94L also decreased the change in Ca2+ sensitivity of force development observed on lowering the pH from 7 to 6.5, when compared with wild type TnT. The examination of additional mutants, H91Q and a double mutant H91Q/R92W, suggests that mutations in a region including residues 91–94 in HCTnT can perturb the proper response of cardiac contraction to changes in pH. These results suggest that different regions of TnT may contribute to the pathogenesis of TnT-linked FHC through different mechanisms.

Vertebrate striated muscles contract in response to increasing intracellular Ca2+ concentration where Ca2+-bound troponin (Tn) 1The abbreviations used are: Tn, troponin; HCTnT, human cardiac troponin T; TnI, troponin I; TnC, troponin C; Tm; tropomyosin; FHC, familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; MES, 2-[N-morpholino]ethanesulfonic acid; SCD, sudden cardiac death; WT, wild type. 1The abbreviations used are: Tn, troponin; HCTnT, human cardiac troponin T; TnI, troponin I; TnC, troponin C; Tm; tropomyosin; FHC, familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; MES, 2-[N-morpholino]ethanesulfonic acid; SCD, sudden cardiac death; WT, wild type. together with tropomyosin (Tm) activates the thin filaments and leads to interactions between the thick and thin filaments (1Zot A.S.

Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 1-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Tn, one of the regulatory proteins of striated muscle, is composed of three subunits, a Ca2+ binding subunit troponin C (TnC), an inhibitory subunit troponin I (TnI), and a Tm binding subunit troponin T (TnT). Although the activation and inhibition of muscle contraction are primarily achieved by TnC and TnI, respectively, these events cannot occur without TnT. In other words TnT not only anchors the Tn complex to the thin filament but also contributes to the Ca2+-dependent regulation of muscle contraction (3Perry S.V. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 575-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Therefore, any functional and structural defects in these Tn subunits may cause alteration of the Ca2+ regulation of muscle contraction.Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) is an autosomal dominant disorder of heart muscle, is genetically heterogeneous, and results from mutations in genes encoding almost every major sarcomeric protein, including β-myosin heavy chain (4Geisterfer-Lowrance A.A.

The phenotype of FHC patients who carry these sarcomeric protein mutations appears to vary, from mild to remarkable hypertrophy, asymptomatic to severe symptoms such as chest pain, dyspnea, or arrhythmia and in some cases is associated with sudden cardiac death (SCD) (13Marian A.J. Salek L. Lutucuta S. Minn. Med. 2001; 92: 435-451Google Scholar).To date there are at least 26 known mutations in the human cardiac TnT (HCTnT) gene that are linked to FHC, including 23 missense mutations, one deletion mutation, and one splicing donor site mutation (14Gomes A.V. Barnes J.A. Harada K. Potter J.D. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). Patients who have TnT mutations often show no or mild hypertrophy, myocardial disarray, and have a malignant phenotype associated with a high incidence of SCD compared with the other FHC genes (15Varnava A.M. Elliott P.M. Baboonian C. Davison F. Davies M.J. McKenna W.J. Circulation. 2001; 104: 1380-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). These phenotypes, however, that are caused by the different TnT mutations, can vary, and the phenotype-genotype correlation is not currently fully understood. Many studies have been attempted to exploit the molecular pathogenesis of FHC caused by each TnT mutation from molecular to physiological levels and have shown that most FHC-TnT mutations alter the contractile properties of cardiac muscle, especially the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development and ATPase activity in vitro and in vivo (14Gomes A.V. Barnes J.A. Harada K. Potter J.D. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar, 16Hernandez O.M. Housmans P.R. Potter J.D. J. Appl.

Our previous studies have demonstrated that the FHC-TnT mutants I79N, R92Q, F110I, E163K, and R278C increased Ca2+ sensitivity of force development when they were incorporated into porcine skinned cardiac fibers together with human CTnI and CTnC (18Szczesna D. Zhang R. Zhao J. Jones M. Guzman G. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 624-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Moreover, our transgenic mouse model, expressing the I79N mutation, has demonstrated similar properties (i.e. increase in the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development and ATPase activity) as well as other phenotypic properties of FHC, such as impaired diastolic function (19Miller T. Szczesna D. Housmans P.R. Zhao J. de Freitas F. Gomes A.V. Culbreath L. McCue J. Wang Y. Xu Y. Kerrick W.G. Potter J.D. J. Biol.

Similar results have been seen at both the molecular and physiological levels, implying that altered Ca2+ regulation of muscle contraction by TnT mutations might be the primary mechanism for TnT-linked FHC.To further characterize the functional consequences of the FHC-TnT mutations on muscle contraction we have examined eight different HCTnT mutations, R92L, R92W, R94L, A104V, R130C, E163R, S179F, and E244D. They are located in functionally and structurally different regions of the HCTnT molecule. R92W, R94L, and A104V were shown to cause a severe form of FHC characterized by a high incidence of SCD (15Varnava A.M. Elliott P.M. Baboonian C. Davison F. Davies M.J. McKenna W.J.

Seidman C.E. Circulation. 2000; 102: 1950-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, a rare homozygous S179F mutation had a malignant prognosis. The R92L mutation has been linked to a severe phenotype, with a higher level of hypertrophy but less SCD, although the incidence of disease-related death is high (15Varnava A.M. Elliott P.M.

There are insufficient clinical data for R130C, E163R, and E244D; therefore, the phenotypic features caused by these mutations are unclear (26Koga Y. Toshima H. Kimura A. Harada H. Koyanagi T.

To investigate effects of these TnT mutations, recombinant HCTnT mutants were incorporated into porcine cardiac skinned fibers together with HCTnI and HCTnC using the Tn displacement method followed by the measurement of Ca2+-dependent isometric force development at pH 7.0 and 6.5. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was utilized to determine the secondary structural variations among the isolated TnT mutations. Results from fiber studies have shown a correlation between the location of the FHC mutation in the TnT molecule and its effect on Ca2+-regulated force. Mutations near the N terminus of TnT seemed to impair its affinity for Tm, whereas mutations in the middle and near the C-terminal end of the molecule altered steady state cross-bridge kinetics. Nevertheless, most mutants showed similar effects on Ca2+-dependent force development, resulting in increased Ca2+ sensitivity. These results suggest that different TnT mutations alter the Ca2+ regulation of muscle contraction through different mechanisms and that these differences may contribute to the molecular pathogenesis of various forms of FHC caused by the TnT mutations.MATERIALS AND METHODSCloning and Mutagenesis of Human Cardiac Troponin cDNAs— Cloning of wild-type (WT) human cardiac TnT, TnI, and TnC was described elsewhere (18Szczesna D. Zhang R. Zhao J. Jones M. Guzman G. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 624-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To create the FHC-TnT mutations R92L, R92W, R94L, A104V, R130C, E163R, S179F, and E244D as well as the additional TnT mutations H91Q and H91Q/R92W, a sequential overlapping polymerase chain reaction-based method was utilized, and all clones were constructed in the pET-3d expression vector. Mutations in the TnT cDNA were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Expression and Purification of Recombinant Human Cardiac Troponin—Recombinant human cardiac Tn subunits were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3), and standard methods were used for the purification of the HCTnTs, HCTnI, and HCTnC (18Szczesna D. Zhang R. Zhao J. Jones M. Guzman G. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 624-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant HCTnTs were purified from a sonicated bacterial cell suspension using a Fast Flow S-Sepharose ion exchange column followed by Q-Sepharose column chromatography. Depending on the purity, the samples were further purified using a DE-52 column. TnTs were eluted with a 0- 0.6 m NaCl gradient in a buffer containing 20 mm citric acid (pH 7.0), 6 m urea, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol for the S-Sepharose column, a 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 6 m urea, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol for the Q-Sepharose column, and 0–0.3 m KCl in a buffer containing Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 6 m urea, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol gradient for the DE-52 column.Circular Dichroism of HCTnT Mutants—The CD spectra of HCTnT WT and the mutants were collected using a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter with a cell path length of 0.1 cm at ambient temperature (20 °C). Samples were dialyzed against 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), including 0.5 or 0.3 m NaF. The concentrations of the HCTnT mutants were determined using the Bradford assay with wild type HCTnT (WT) as a standard. The final protein concentration was set to 0.25 mg/ml. Analysis and processing of data were carried out using the Jasco system software (Windows Standard Analysis, Version 1.20). Ten scans were averaged, and the spectrum of the buffer was subtracted for a base-line offset.Mean residue ellipticity ([θ]MRE, in degrees·cm2·dmol–1) for the spectra were calculated using the equation [θ]MRE = [θ]/(10·Cr·l), where [θ] is the measured ellipticity in millidegrees, Cr is the mean residue molar concentration, and l is the path length in cm. The α-helical content for each sample was calculated using the standard equation for [θ] at 222 nm (28Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 44: 1285-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), [θ]222 =–30,300fH – 2340, where fH is the fraction of α-helical content (fH × 100, expressed in %).Preparation of Porcine Skinned Cardiac Fibers and Measurement of Force Development—Skinned papillary muscles were prepared from the left ventricles of pig hearts. Small bundles of fibers were isolated and treated with the relaxing solution (10–8m Ca2+, 1 mm Mg2+, 7 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgATP, 20 mm imidazole (pH 7.0), 20 mm creatine phosphate, and 15 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, I = 150 mm) containing 1% Triton X-100 for ∼1 h and relaxing solution including 50% glycerol at –20 °C. For measurement of force development, small fibers (∼120 μm in diameter) were dissected and then mounted between a force transducer and a fixed needle. Fibers were skinned with 1% Triton X-100 in relaxing solution for 30 min at room temperature. After maximum force was measured at pCa 4 the fibers were exposed to increasing Ca2+ concentration ranging from pCa 8 to pCa 4, and the force-pCa relationship was recorded at pH 7.0 and then at pH 6.5 on the same fiber. The data were analyzed with the Hill equation as described previously (18Szczesna D. Zhang R. Zhao J. Jones M. Guzman G. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 624-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).Tn Displacement and Reconstitution in Skinned Cardiac Fibers— The Tn displacement/replacement method, which we have modified from that of Hatakenaka and Ohtsuki (29Hatakenaka M. Ohtsuki I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), was utilized to replace the Tn present in the porcine fibers with human subunits (18Szczesna D. Zhang R. Zhao J. Jones M. Guzman G. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 624-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 29Hatakenaka M. Ohtsuki I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). After the control Ca2+-dependent force development was measured the fibers were incubated with an excess amount of WT or HCTnT mutants (0.8 or 1.0 mg/ml) in a solution containing 250 mm KCl, 20 mm MES-KOH (pH 6.2), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h. Fibers were then incubated in the same, fresh TnT solution for another hour. Displaced fibers were washed with the same solution without protein and tested for Ca2+-unregulated force at pCa 8 and pCa 4. This Ca2+-unregulated force development is due to the absence of the endogenous porcine TnI and TnC. To evaluate the extent of exchange by different TnT mutants the equation %Ca2+ regulation = (FpCa 4 – FpCa 8)/FpCa 4 × 100 was employed, where FpCa 8 and FpCa 4 are the force development of TnT-displaced fibers at pCa 8 and pCa 4, respectively (see Fig. 1). FpCa 4 of the TnT mutants-reconstituted fibers was also compared with that of HCTnT WT-incorporated fibers for the direct effect of TnT mutations on isometric force development. After TnT-displaced fibers were incubated with an HCTnI·C complex for 1.5 h, Ca2+-dependent force development of Tn-displaced fibers was determined at pH 7.0 and then at pH 6.5.Data Analysis—Data were expressed as the mean value ± S.D. The statistical significance of the differences between the mean value for WT versus HCTnT mutants was determined by one-way analysis of variance followed by a post-hoc test (Dunnett's multiple comparison test). Turky-Kramer's multiple-comparison test was utilized to evaluate differences among TnT mutations. For the effect of TnI·TnC reconstitution on the maximum force development, the paired t test was applied.RESULTSIonic Strength Dependent Stability of the Secondary Structure of Human Cardiac TnT Mutants—CD spectra of isolated HCTnT mutants were collected in the presence of 0.5 m NaF (Fig. 2). The estimated α-helical content of WT TnT was ∼38%. Both of the Arg to Leu mutations, R92L and R94L, resulted in increased α-helical content to ∼60 and 59%, respectively (Fig. 2). R92W, A104V, R130C, and E163K also showed increased α-helical content, whereas the α-helical content of S179F and E244D were similar to that of WT. In the presence of 0.3 m NaF, all TnTs, especially A104V, showed less α-helical content compared with 0.5 m NaF (data not shown).Fig. 2Far-UV circular dichroism spectra of HCTnT WT and mutants.

Alterations in the affinity of TnT for Tm or other thin filament proteins could affect the efficiency of Tn replacement in skinned fibers. We have previously found that the FHC-TnT F110I-mutant showed poor incorporation into the porcine skinned cardiac muscle preparation (18Szczesna D. Zhang R. Zhao J. Jones M. Guzman G. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 624-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This result is consistent with another report in which fragments, including the N-terminal Tm binding region of TnT were used, and a F110I fragment showed a decreased affinity for Tm (30Palm T. Graboski S. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Greenfield N.J. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2827-2837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 31Hinkle A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 506-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To estimate the exchangeability of TnT mutants we have calculated the %Ca2+ regulation of force development after fibers were treated with each TnT mutant (see “Materials and Methods”). The amount of endogenous Tn complex that remained in the fibers after TnT treatment correlated well with the %Ca2+ regulation remaining after TnT incubation (18Szczesna D. Zhang R. Zhao J. Jones M. Guzman G. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 624-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 32Morimoto S. Yanaga F. Minakami R. Ohtsuki I. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C200-C207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These values, derived from the measurement of Ca2+-unregulated force development, can be used as an index for the extent of Tn displacement. We have previously demonstrated that endogenous porcine cardiac Tn can be replaced by recombinant HCTnT WT nearly completely under certain conditions, and HCTnT WT-incorporated fibers showed almost no Ca2+ regulation unless they were reconstituted with HCTnI and TnC (18Szczesna D. Zhang R. Zhao J. Jones M. Guzman G. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 624-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Consistent with this previous observation, we observed very little Ca2+ regulation of force development after HCTnT WT treatment (mean %Ca2+ regulation = 6%) in the present study (Table I). The %Ca2+ regulation for A104V, E163R, and S179F-displaced fibers was comparable with the WT fibers, suggesting that the exchangeability of HCTnT with porcine Tn was not altered by these mutations. The value of %Ca2+ regulation of E244D-treated fibers was also not significantly different from that of WT fibers, and we did not observe any Ca2+ regulation of force development after the fibers were treated with this mutant. The R92L-displaced fibers showed slightly increased %Ca2+ regulation but were not significantly different when they were compared with WT fibers. In contrast, the %Ca2+ regulation of force development was significantly increased when fibers were reconstituted with R92W, R94L, or R130C. This result indicates that the amino acid substitutions Arg to Trp at position 92, Arg to Leu at position 94, and Arg to Cys at position 130 impaired the exchangeability of HCTnT. The latter mutants were able to exchange about 80% with the endogenous Tn, as judged by the remaining Ca2+ regulation of force development.Table ISummary of pCa-force relationship curves of Tn-replaced fibers at pH 7.0pCa50nHMaximum force% Ca2+ regulationaPercentage of the Ca2+-regulatable isometric force of skinned fiber development after TnT treatment, %Ca2+ regulation, was calculated using the equation %Ca-regulation = (FpCa 4 - FpCa 8) / FpCa 4 × 100, where FpCa 4 and FpCa 8 are relative force at pCa 4 and 8, respectively.

Open table in a new tab Effect of Mutants on the Maximum Force Development before and after HCTnI·C Reconstitution—As we have observed previously the maximum force development (FpCa 4) was decreased by HCTnT WT treatment (by ∼25%) compared with the original maximum force of porcine cardiac fibers. This was in part due to a difference between porcine and human cardiac TnTs since the extent of maximum force reduction dramatically decreased when porcine fibers were treated with native porcine cardiac TnT or when human cardiac fibers were treated with recombinant HCTnT WT (18Szczesna D.

The maximum force development of HCTnT WT-displaced fibers, however, was not affected by the subsequent HCTnI·C reconstitution, and the maximum force of fully reconstituted fibers was 69.4 ± 4.1% of that of untreated fibers. We have examined the effect of mutants on the maximum force development after TnT treatment as well as after HCTnI·C reconstitution, and the amount of force development is expressed as the percentage of the maximum force development relative to HCTnT·I·C WT-displaced fibers, which was set as 100% (Table I, Fig. 3). FpCa 4 values (i.e. the maximum force development of TnI·TnC-depleted fibers by TnT treatment) of R92L-, R94L-, A104V-, and R130C-incorporated fibers were very similar to that of WT-displaced fibers, whereas the FpCa 4 values of E163R, S179F,"
https://openalex.org/W2068968795,"Protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP-1B) is a negative regulator of insulin signaling. It is thought to carry out this role by interacting with and dephosphorylating the activated insulin receptor (IR). However, little is known regarding the nature of the cellular interaction between these proteins, especially because the IR is localized to the plasma membrane and PTP-1B to the endoplasmic reticulum. Using confocal microscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), the interaction between PTP-1B and the IR was examined in co-transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Biological activities were not significantly affected for either PTP-1B or the IR with the fusion of W1B-green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the N terminus of PTP-1B (W1B-PTP-1B) or the fusion of Topaz-GFP to the C terminus of the IR (Topaz-IR). FRET between W1B and Topaz was monitored in cells transfected with either wild type PTP-1B (W1B-PTP-1B) or the substrate-trapping form PTP-1BD181A (W1B-PTP-1BD181A) and Topaz-IR. Co-expression of W1B-PTP-1B with Topaz-IR resulted in distribution of Topaz-IR to the plasma membrane, but no FRET was obtained upon insulin treatment. In contrast, co-expression of W1B-PTP-1BD181A with Topaz-IR caused an increase in cytosolic Topaz-IR fluorescence and, in some cells, a significant basal FRET signal, suggesting that PTP-1B is interacting with the IR during its synthesis. Stimulation of these cells with insulin resulted in a rapid induction of FRET that increased over time and was localized to a perinuclear spot. Co-expression of Topaz-IR with a GFP-labeled RhoB endosomal marker and treatment of the cells with insulin identified a perinuclear endosome compartment as the site of localization. Furthermore, the insulin-induced FRET could be prevented by the treatment of the cells with a specific PTP-1B inhibitor. These results suggest that PTP-1B appears not only to interact with and dephosphorylate the insulin-stimulated IR in a perinuclear endosome compartment but is also involved in maintaining the IR in a dephosphorylated state during its biosynthesis. Protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP-1B) is a negative regulator of insulin signaling. It is thought to carry out this role by interacting with and dephosphorylating the activated insulin receptor (IR). However, little is known regarding the nature of the cellular interaction between these proteins, especially because the IR is localized to the plasma membrane and PTP-1B to the endoplasmic reticulum. Using confocal microscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), the interaction between PTP-1B and the IR was examined in co-transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Biological activities were not significantly affected for either PTP-1B or the IR with the fusion of W1B-green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the N terminus of PTP-1B (W1B-PTP-1B) or the fusion of Topaz-GFP to the C terminus of the IR (Topaz-IR). FRET between W1B and Topaz was monitored in cells transfected with either wild type PTP-1B (W1B-PTP-1B) or the substrate-trapping form PTP-1BD181A (W1B-PTP-1BD181A) and Topaz-IR. Co-expression of W1B-PTP-1B with Topaz-IR resulted in distribution of Topaz-IR to the plasma membrane, but no FRET was obtained upon insulin treatment. In contrast, co-expression of W1B-PTP-1BD181A with Topaz-IR caused an increase in cytosolic Topaz-IR fluorescence and, in some cells, a significant basal FRET signal, suggesting that PTP-1B is interacting with the IR during its synthesis. Stimulation of these cells with insulin resulted in a rapid induction of FRET that increased over time and was localized to a perinuclear spot. Co-expression of Topaz-IR with a GFP-labeled RhoB endosomal marker and treatment of the cells with insulin identified a perinuclear endosome compartment as the site of localization. Furthermore, the insulin-induced FRET could be prevented by the treatment of the cells with a specific PTP-1B inhibitor. These results suggest that PTP-1B appears not only to interact with and dephosphorylate the insulin-stimulated IR in a perinuclear endosome compartment but is also involved in maintaining the IR in a dephosphorylated state during its biosynthesis. The insulin receptor is a heterotetramer plasma membrane protein that consists of two extracellular α subunits and two membrane-spanning intracellular β subunits that contain inherent tyrosine kinase domains (1Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3973) Google Scholar). The receptor is initially synthesized as a single polypeptide α-β proreceptor that undergoes processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; BRET, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer; EBNA, Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; ECFP, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein; EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HEK, human embryonic kidney; IR, insulin receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PDGFR, platelet-derived growth factor receptor; PTP-1B, protein tyrosine phosphatse-1B. While it is in the ER, the proreceptor dimerizes and undergoes disulfide bond formation, glycosylation, and proteolysis before transfer to the plasma membrane (2Olson T.S. Bamberger M.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 263: 7342-7351Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 3Lu K. Guidotti G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 4Bass J. Chiu G. Argon Y. Steiner D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 637-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Binding of insulin to the receptor on the plasma membrane results in activation of the β-subunit tyrosine kinase activity, and, once activated, autophosphorylation on three critical tyrosine residues in the kinase activation loop occurs, resulting in full activation of the tyrosine kinase activity (1Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3973) Google Scholar). The activated IR then begins to phosphorylate its various substrates to initiate the insulin signaling cascade but, at the same time, undergoes internalization into endosomes, where it remains activated (5Di Guglielmo G.M. Drake P.G. Baass P.C. Authier F. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 6Bevan A.P. Seabright P.J. Tikerpae J. Posner B.I. Smith G.D. Siddle K. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 164: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, acidification of the endosome lumen causes insulin dissociation from the receptor, which prevents further activation. The receptor then undergoes dephosphorylation, at which time it is then sorted back to the plasma membrane (5Di Guglielmo G.M. Drake P.G. Baass P.C. Authier F. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Identification of the protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) involved in the dephosphorylation of the activated IR is of critical interest, because inhibitors directed toward these PTPs could be used in the treatment of insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes. Using a mouse gene knockout, PTP-1B was shown to be a crucial phosphatase involved in the in vivo dephosphorylation of the activated IR (7Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins L. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J. Ramachandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1926) Google Scholar, 8Klaman L.D. Boss O.

Biol. 2000; 20: 5479-5489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). The results from the PTP-1B null mouse were key in establishing the role of PTP-1B in the negative regulation of insulin signaling (9Asante-Appiah E. Kennedy B.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: E663-E670Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In addition to having enhanced insulin sensitivity, these mice were also resistant to diet-induced obesity. Moreover, insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor was increased and prolonged in muscle and liver of these animals, suggesting that the role of PTP-1B is to dephosphorylate the activated IR (7Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins L. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J. Ramachandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1926) Google Scholar). Although these studies have highlighted the importance of PTP-1B as a negative regulator in insulin signaling, it is conceivable that these results could possibly be due to an indirect effect of PTP-1B on insulin signaling and not due to a direct interaction between PTP-1B and the IR. PTP-1B has been shown to be located on the cytoplasmic surface of the ER (10Frangioni J.V. Beahm P.H. Shifrin V. Jost C.A Neel B.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 545-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), whereas the IR is located at the plasma membrane; where and how these two proteins interact within the cell has not been demonstrated. Recently, Boute et al. (11Boute N. Boubekeur S. Lacasa D. Issad T. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) reported on the interaction between PTP-1B and the IR in cells using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET); even though these authors could show very nicely that PTP-1B and the insulin-activated IR do interact, where in the cell this interaction takes place was not reported. To investigate where PTP-1B and the IR interact within the cell, we have fused PTP-1B and the IR to mutant derivatives of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and employed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to monitor the interaction (12Cubitt A. Heim R. Adams S. Boyd A. Gross L. Tsien R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 448-455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). FRET is a non-destructive and non-invasive technique for effectively measuring protein-protein interactions in the range of 10-100 Å (12Cubitt A. Heim R. Adams S. Boyd A. Gross L. Tsien R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 448-455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). By utilizing this technique, we show that PTP-1B rapidly interacts with the insulin-activated IR in a specific subcellular compartment. Furthermore, this interaction can be disrupted by the addition of a specific PTP-1B inhibitor. Materials—The cDNAs for W1B and Topaz in pRSETA vectors were obtained from Aurora Biosciences. pDNR-1, subcellular localization vectors (pECFP-Endo, pEYFP-Endo and pEYFP-ER), and anti-GFP antibodies were from Clontech. The pET11a vector was from Novagen, and all other cloning vectors were supplied by Invitrogen. Mouse and human PTP-1B antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, and the IR antibodies for the α and β subunits were obtained from BD Biosciences and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. The anti-phospho-Tyr-1158 antibody was supplied by BIOSOURCE. Anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibody was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Cell culture media were obtained from Invitrogen. Poly-d-lysine-coated culture slides were obtained from BD Biosciences, and antifade mounting medium was from Amersham Biosciences. The W1B-Topaz fusion construct containing the six-amino acid linker was kindly provided by Paul Tawa (13Tawa P. Tam J. Cassady R. Nicholson D.W. Xanthoudakis S. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The PTP-1B inhibitor, disodium[(4-[(([3′-(aminosulfonyl)-4′-bromobiphenyl-4-yl]methyl)thio)methyl]-2-bromophenyl)(difluoro)methyl]phosphonate (see Fig. 5B, inset) was synthesized at Merck Frosst. Details of the synthesis can be found in Ref. 14Sing L.C. Lau C.K. Therien M. Gauthier J-Y. Bayly C. Dufresne C. Fortin R. Leblanc Y. International Application, Patent Cooperation Treaty Patent WO 2001/70753. September 27, 2001; Google Scholar. All other reagents were supplied by Sigma. Construction of W1B and Topaz Fusion Proteins in Expression Vectors—The W1B GFP mutant was amplified from pRSETA-hW1B by PCR such that an NdeI site was added at the 5′-end and an EcoRI site at its 3′ end with removal of the stop codon. The fragment was first subcloned into pCR2.1-Topo and then cloned into pDRN-1r using NdeI and EcoRI. Full-length hPTP-1B was amplified to add an EcoRI site at its 5′-end and a BamHI site at its 3′ end and subcloned into pCRII. Following excision with EcoRI and BamHI, the PTP-1B cDNA was cloned in-frame to the 3′-end of W1B in pDNR-1r to generate a fusion protein containing a two-amino acid linker (Asp-Phe) between the GFP and PTP-1B. To generate the W1B-PTP-1B substrate-trapping mutant (15Flint A.J. Tignanis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar), Asp at amino acid position 181 was changed to Ala using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using pDNR-1r-W1B-PTP1B as a template. For expression of W1B-PTP-1B in bacterial cells, the fusion construct was excised from pDNR-1r and cloned into the NdeI/BamHI sites in pET11a. For mammalian expression, the constructs (either wild type or mutant) were excised from pDNR-1r with Asp-718 and BamHI and cloned into the appropriate sites in pcDNA3.1. The Topaz GFP mutant was excised from pRSETA-hTopaz using EcoR1 and XhoI and cloned into the EcoR1/XhoI site of pcDNA3.1. The 5′-half of the human IR cDNA was excised from pECE-hIR (kindly supplied by Dr. Bei Zhang) (16Ellis L. Clauser E. Morgan D.O. Edery M. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cell. 1986; 45: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar) using Hind III and BamHI digestion, whereas the 3′-half was amplified by PCR to include the BamHI site and to add an EcoRI site and remove the stop codon at the 3′-end. The resulting Topaz-IR fusion protein contained a five-amino acid linker peptide (AEFAT) between the coding sequence of the human IR and the ATG codon of Topaz. Fidelity of the constructs was verified by sequencing. Bacterial Expression and Partial Purification of W1B-PTP-1B for Kinetic Characterization—Escherichia coli BL21 cells containing the W1B-PTP-1B-pET11a plasmid were grown in Luria Bertani broth at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.7, induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and grown for an additional 2 h. A 50-μl cell pellet of harvested cells was washed twice with PBS, resuspended in 1.5 ml of lysis buffer (PBS + 5 mm EDTA), and briefly sonicated. Following the addition of 150 μl of 10% Triton X-100, the cells were left at 4 °C overnight with gentle rocking. Cell lysate was then collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min, and 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (50% slurry) was added followed by incubation for a further 1 h at 4 °C to remove nonspecific binding. The supernatant was collected and combined with 10 μl of anti-GFP antibody (full-length polyclonal) and 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose. Following overnight incubation at 4 °C with rocking, the supernatant was removed by centrifugation, and the Sepharose beads were then washed five times with PBS and resuspended in enzyme dilution buffer (100 mm Tris/HCl, 5 mm N,N′-dimethyl-bis(mercatoacetyl)hydrazine (DMH), 2 mm EDTA, 2% glycerol, and 0.01% Triton X-100, pH 7.4). Enzyme activity was quantitated as described previously (17Romsicki Y. Kennedy B.P. Asante-Appiah E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 41: 40-50Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Cell Cultures and Transfections—HEK 293 EBNA cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 mg/ml G-418, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) in a humidified 37 °C incubator with 6% CO2. For immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis, cells were seeded onto poly-d-lysine coated plates (Biocoat, BD Biosciences) at a density of 1 × 106 cells per 100-mm plate. Cells were transfected 24 h later with 13 μg of the appropriate plasmids, using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) and following the manufacturer's protocol. 24 h post-transfection, the transfection mixture was removed and replaced with regular growth medium. Cells were maintained under normal growth conditions until ready for use. For confocal microscopy and FRET experiments, transfections were performed as outlined above, except that cells were transfected in poly-d-lysine-coated chamber slides. Cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 per well of a four-well chamber slide and grown for 24 h prior to transfection. The cells were transfected with 120 ng of the appropriate plasmids using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent and maintained under normal growth conditions as described above. For cotransfections, equal amounts of the constructs were added to the transfection mixtures. For “mock” transfections, cells were transfected by following the same protocol, but without DNA. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis of HEK 293 Cell Lysates—Transiently transfected HEK 293 EBNA cells were serum-starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.15% bovine serum albumin (no serum) from 4 h to overnight at 37 °C. Following stimulation with 100 nm insulin, the cells were immediately placed on ice, the media was removed, and the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Lysates were prepared by scraping the cells into 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 μm pervanadate, and a Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation of the samples for 15 min at 13,000 × g. The supernatants were used directly for Western blot analysis or were processed further for immunoprecipitation experiments. In the latter case, the supernatants were diluted to yield a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml, and 1 mg of each sample was incubated with 3 μg of anti-PTP-1B antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking. 100 μl of protein G-Sepharose (50% slurry) was then added to the antibody complexes, and the mixtures were incubated for a further 4 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The immunoprecipitates were then harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with lysis buffer followed by two washings with PBS. Immune complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 8% Tris-glycine gels. The procedures for immunoblotting of cell lysates and immune complexes were essentially the same. Briefly, following SDS-PAGE, the resolved proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose overnight at 16 V (75 mA). Membranes were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin and incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies in the presence of 3% bovine serum albumin followed by anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibody. Protein bands were detected by chemiluminescence using the Western Lightning™ kit (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences). Microscopy, Image Analysis, and FRET Quantification—Cells were transfected and grown on glass slides as described above. Following insulin treatment, cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 3.2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Following three more washes (15 min each) with PBS, the cells were mounted under glass coverslips with Prolong™ antifade reagent (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions and visualized under a Zeiss LSM510 laser-scanning confocal microscope. For detection of W1B, cells were viewed with an excitation filter of 458 nm, a beam splitter of 545 nm, and a 475-525-nm bandpass emission filter. Topaz was detected using an excitation filter of 514 nm, a beam splitter of 545 nm, and a 530-600 nm emission filter. The filters for FRET were an excitation filter of 458 nm, a beam splitter of 545 nm, and a 530-600-nm emission filter. Images were captured using a cooled CCD camera. All images were background-subtracted and corrected FRET (FRETC) was calculated as follows (18Youvan D.C. Silva C.M. Bylina E.J. Coleman W.J. Dilworth M.R. Yang M.M. Biotechnology. 1997; 3: 1-18Google Scholar) in Equation 1, FRETC=IFRET-(IW1B×a+ITopaz×b)(Eq. 1) where IFRET, IW1B, and ITopaz were the intensities of the images under the FRET, W1B, and Topaz filter sets, respectively. a is the percentage of W1B bleed-through into the FRET filter set, and b was the percentage of Topaz bleed-through into the FRET filter set. There were no bleed-through signals from W1B under Topaz filter sets or vice versa. a and b were determined by taking images of cells containing W1B or Topaz alone and determining the relative intensity of emission in the FRET channel and that in the W1B or Topaz channel. A broad range of intensities was examined, and a line of best fit was drawn through the data to obtain correction factors. Exposure settings were identical for all images. Construction of GFP Fusion Proteins and Analysis of Protein Expression—FRET analysis using mutant derivatives of GFP fused to PTP-1B and the IR was used to investigate the cellular interactions between PTP-1B and IR. To confirm that PTP-1B retained normal catalytic activity when fused to GFP at its N terminus, W1B-PTP-1B was expressed and purified from bacterial cells, and its ability to hydrolyze p-nitrophenylphosphate was characterized. W1B-PTP-1B displayed normal phosphatase activity with respect to p-nitrophenylphosphate hydrolysis (Km = 1.4 mm and kcat = 24 s-1), which could be abolished by treatment with BzN-EJJ-amide, a potent PTP-1B inhibitor (19Asante-Appiah E. Patel S. Dufresne C. Roy P. Wang Q. Patel V. Friesen R.W. Ramachandran C. Becker J.W. Leblanc Y. Kennedy B.P. Scapin G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9043-9051Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (data not shown). To increase the steady-state population of PTP-1B and IR complexes for optical analysis of cellular fluorescence, we examined PTP-1B-IR interactions using the D181A substrate-trapping form of PTP-1B (W1B-PTP-1BD181A) (15Flint A.J. Tignanis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). The expression of W1B-PTP-1BD181A and Topaz-IR co-transfected into HEK 293 EBNA cells was examined using Western blot analysis. Fig. 1, A and D show the presence of an 80-kDa band following blotting with anti-GFP and anti-PTP-1B antibodies respectively, which corresponds to the expected molecular mass of the W1B-PTP-1B fusion protein. Similarly, blotting with anti-GFP and anti-IR-β subunit antibodies (Fig. 1, A and B, respectively) revealed the presence of a 120-kDa band corresponding to the molecular mass of the β-subunit of the IR fused to Topaz. The blots also revealed the presence of a ∼250-kDa band that, in addition to cross reacting with the GFP and β-subunit antibodies (Fig. 1, A and B), also cross reacted with an antibody raised against the α subunit of the IR (IR-α) (data not shown), indicating that the band corresponds to the unprocessed α-β-Topaz form of the receptor. The presence of the unprocessed IR in transfected HEK 293 cells has been observed previously (20Lammers R. Bossenmaier B. Cool D.E. Tonks N.K. Schlessinger J. Fischer E.H. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22456-22462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These authors also found that both the β-subunit and the α-β precursor became tyrosine phosphorylated even in the absence of ligand (20Lammers R. Bossenmaier B. Cool D.E. Tonks N.K. Schlessinger J. Fischer E.H. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22456-22462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also observed similar results in this study in which a significant level of basal phosphorylation was observed on Tyr-1158 for both the β-subunit-Topaz and the α-β-Topaz precursor (Fig. 1C, lane 3). Following treatment with 100 nm insulin, the level of phosphorylation on the β-subunit-Topaz fusion protein increased at least 2-fold, whereas there was no change in the phosphorylation level of the unprocessed IR (Fig. 1C, lane 4). This result is again consistent with the previous report in which insulin treatment increased the tyrosine phosphorylation level of the β-subunit ∼2-fold but had no affect on the level of precursor phosphorylation (20Lammers R. Bossenmaier B. Cool D.E. Tonks N.K. Schlessinger J. Fischer E.H. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22456-22462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More importantly, the addition of the GFPs to PTP-1B and IR did not hinder their interaction, as the protein complexes could be immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with an anti-PTP-1B antibody (Fig. 1E). In the lysates, W1B-PTP-1B interacted with both the β-subunit-Topaz fusion protein and the unprocessed α-β-Topaz form of the receptor. However, treatment of the cells with 100 nm insulin only resulted in an increase in the amount of the β-subunit-Topaz fusion protein that was pulled down in complex with W1B-PTP-1BD181A (Fig. 1E, lane 4). Localization of W1B-PTP-1B and Topaz-IR in Transfected HEK 293 Cells—GFPs are soluble proteins that, when expressed in mammalian cells, are normally distributed throughout the cell (12Cubitt A. Heim R. Adams S. Boyd A. Gross L. Tsien R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 448-455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). This typical distribution of GFP is shown in Fig. 2A, where a W1B-Topaz fusion protein with a six-amino acid linker was used (13Tawa P. Tam J. Cassady R. Nicholson D.W. Xanthoudakis S. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because the GFPs are linked, they show extensive co-localization and FRET throughout the cell (Fig. 2A). However, fusion of W1B to either wild type (Fig. 2, B and C) or the substrate-trapping mutant of PTP-1B (Fig. 2, D and E) results in distribution of the W1B fluorescence to a region of the cell surrounding the nucleus. A similar cellular distribution for YFP-PTP-1B in HEK cells was recently reported, and this distribution is consistent with the association of PTP-1B with the ER (11Boute N. Boubekeur S. Lacasa D. Issad T. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Support for the localization of W1B-PTP-1B to the ER was obtained when W1B-PTP-1BD181A was co-transfected with a GFP-calreticulin ER targeting vector (Fig. 2D). Both W1B-PTP-1B and GFP-calreticulin show similar distribution and extensive co-localization. Distribution of the Topaz-IR co-transfected with the wild type W1B-PTP-1B resulted in the localization of the Topaz-IR fluorescence primarily to the plasma membrane (Fig 2, B and C). There was minimum co-localization, and no FRET was detected with wild type W1B-PTP-1B either in the absence or presence of insulin (Fig. 2, B, and C, respectively). In contrast, co-transfection of Topaz-IR with the substrate-trapping form of PTP-1B, W1B-PTP-1BD181A, resulted in a significant increase in Topaz-IR intracellular fluorescence (Fig. 2E). In a number of the Topaz-IR and W1B-PTP-1BD181A co-expressing cells, extensive co-localization was observed, as well as a significant basal level of FRET (Fig. 2E). The insulin-independent FRET in these cells appeared to have an ER type of distribution. Based on the results from four independent experiments in which a total of 202 (∼ 50 cells examined per experiment) co-expressing cells were examined, 56 (28%; S.D. ± 9%) of co-expressing cells display FRET in the absence of insulin. Insulin-induced FRET between W1B-PTP-1B and Topaz-IR—The basal FRET observed in HEK cells co-expressing W1B-PTP-1BD181A and Topaz-IR is consistent with the trapping of the Topaz-IR by W1B-PTP-1BD181A as it is being processed in the ER. This enhanced basal interaction between the substrate-trapping form of PTP-1B and the IR was also reported recently by Boute et al. who utilized BRET to investigate the interaction between the IR and PTP-1B (11Boute N. Boubekeur S. Lacasa D. Issad T. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). At the basal level as stated above, ∼28% of the co-expressing HEK cells displayed FRET, whereas the remainder, although co-expressing both W1B-PTP-1BD181A and Topaz-IR, did not (Fig. 3A). However, treatment of these cells with 100 nm insulin resulted approximately in a doubling of the number of the cells displaying a FRET signal. Similarly, as described above, in four independent experiments where 409 (∼100 cells per experiment) co-expressing cells were examined after insulin treatment, 208 (51%; S.D. ± 14%) displayed a FRET signal. The insulin-induced FRET signal appeared as early as 5 min after insulin treatment as a small perinuclear spot (Fig. 3B) and increased in size and intensity over time (Fig. 3, C and D). 30 min after insulin treatment, the FRET signal was quite intense and still concentrated in a perinuclear region (Fig. 3D). The cellular location of this insulin-induced FRET signal is very analogous to that of the endosome-recycling compartment (21Sorkin A. von Astrow M. Nat. Rev. Mol.

It links proximal and distal T cell receptor signaling events through its function as a molecular scaffold in the assembly of multimolecular signaling complexes. Here we studied the functional roles of sub-domains within the SLP-76 proline-rich region, specifically the Gads binding domain and the recently defined P1 domain. To gain a further understanding of the functions mediated by this region, we used three complementary approaches as follows: reconstitution of SLP-76-deficient cells with functional domain deletion mutants, blocking molecular associations through the expression of a dominant negative protein fragment, and directed localization of SLP-76 to assess the role of the domains in SLP-76 recruitment. We find the Gads binding domain and the P1 domain are both necessary for optimal SLP-76 function, and in the absence of these two regions, SLP-76 is functionally inert. Furthermore, we provide direct evidence that SLP-76 localization and, in turn, function are dependent upon association with Gads.

This high affinity interaction occurs through association of the carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain of Gads with a novel SH3 domain binding motif (RXXK) found in SLP-76 (25Berry D.M. Nash P. Liu S.K.

A model for the creation of an adaptor-nucleated signaling complex following TCR engagement has emerged. Linker of activated T cells (LAT), a transmembrane adaptor crucial for T cell development and function (30Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Weiss A.

Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar) allowing for the recruitment and assembly of signaling molecules at the cell membrane. Two conserved cysteines near the LAT transmembrane domain are palmitoylated and target LAT and its binding partners to lipid rafts (GEMs), detergent-insoluble membrane fractions enriched in key signaling molecules. Recruitment by these two modified cysteines has been shown to be necessary for LAT function (33Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Upon phosphorylation, SLP-76 recruits Vav, Nck, and Itk. This complex, which is constitutively associated with Gads, in turn is translocated from the cytosol to lipid raft microdomains through the interaction of the SH2 domain of Gads with phosphorylated tyrosine residues of LAT (20Asada H. Ishii N. Sasaki Y. Endo K. Kasai H. Tanaka N. Takeshita T. Tsuchiya S. Konno T. Sugamura K. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). PLCγ1, also recruited to lipid rafts after TCR engagement through phosphorylation-dependent association with LAT (33Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar), is activated with resultant cleavage of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and activation of the phosphatidylinositol second messenger pathway (34Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1984; 312: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (4254) Google Scholar). This model of SLP-76 recruitment by LAT and Gads is supported by the observation that signaling via the TCR is rescued in LAT-deficient Jurkat T cells by membrane targeting of SLP-76 (35Boerth N.J. Sadler J.J. Bauer D.E. Clements J.L. Gheith S.M. Koretzky G.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1047-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). There are a number of studies that when taken together suggest our understanding of the role of the SLP-76 proline-rich region is incomplete. First, it has been observed that Gads-deficient mice manifest a less severe T cell phenotype than that seen in either SLP-76 or LAT-deficient mice (36Yoder J. Pham C. Iizuka Y.M. Kanagawa O. Liu S.K. McGlade J. Cheng A.M. Science. 2001; 291: 1987-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition, transgenic reconstitution of SLP-76-deficient mice with a Gads-binding mutant at least partially rescues T cell development and function (37Myung P.S. Derimanov G.S. Jordan M.S. Punt J.A. Liu Q.H. Judd B.A. Meyers E.E. Sigmund C.D. Freedman B.D. Koretzky G.A. Immunity. 2001; 15: 1011-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 38Kumar L.

Finally, there have been reports of other molecules that can associate with the SLP-76 proline-rich region including, most recently, the direct SLP-76/PLCγ1 interaction (26Yablonski D. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4208-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In this study we utilize biochemical, genetic, and imaging techniques in a Jurkat T cell model to define further the functional roles of the sub-domains of the SLP-76 proline-rich region. Through reconstitution of SLP-76-deficient Jurkat T cells with wild-type (WT), mutant, membrane-targeted, and dominant negative forms of SLP-76, we show the primary role of the SLP-76/Gads interaction to be SLP-76 recruitment. Association of SLP-76 with PLCγ1 and perhaps other molecules at the P1 domain is also critical for optimal signaling but not solely a result of effects on SLP-76 localization. Plasmid Constructs—Wild-type SLP-76 cDNA was obtained from murine splenic RNA by reverse transcriptase-PCR and was then subcloned into EGFP-C1 at the XhoI and EcoRI sites (Clontech). The cDNA encoding amino-terminally tagged WT SLP-76 was then released by digestion with NheI and SalI, polished at its 5′ end, and ligated into the MigR1 vector (a gift from W. Pear, University of Pennsylvania) (39Pear W.S. Miller J.P. Xu L. Pui J.C. Soffer B. Quackenbush R.C. Pendergast A.M. Bronson R. Aster J.C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Blood. 1998; 92: 3780-3792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) between HpaI and SalI. The P1, G2, and P1/G2 domain mutations of SLP-76 were then created using Transformer Site-directed Mutagenesis (Clontech). The bases encoding amino acids 157-222 of SLP-76 were deleted in the creation of the P1 mutant. The G2 mutation represents replacement of amino acids 237 and 240 of SLP-76, arginine, and lysine, respectively, with alanine residues. The P1/G2 mutant carries both the domain deletion and amino acid substitutions. For creation of the LAT/SLP-76 fusion, the complete LAT cDNA was obtained from murine splenic RNA by reverse transcriptase-PCR. A partial cDNA encoding the first 35 amino acids of LAT, flanked by BamHI and BglII sites, was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the BglII site of MigR1. The fusion was completed by insertion of the full-length SLP-76 cDNA at the BglII and EcoRI sites. The P1 and G2 mutations were then created using Transformer Site-directed Mutagenesis (Clontech). The cDNA encoding the Gads-binding fragment (GBF), amino acids 205-254 of SLP-76, was generated by PCR from a WT SLP-76 plasmid template and then subcloned into DSRed2-C1 at the BglII and HindIII sites (Clontech). All constructs were sequenced for fidelity. Cell Lines, Transfections, and Cell Culture—E6-1 Jurkat T cells and SLP-76-deficient Jurkat T cells (J14) were the gifts from A. Weiss (University of California, San Francisco). All cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 media with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (1,000 units/ml), streptomycin (1,000 units/ml), and glutamine (20 mm) in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C, as described previously (40Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Wu J. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1937-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Additional stable Jurkat derivatives, expressing WT and mutant forms of SLP-76, were created using the MigR1 and DSRed2-C1 vectors described above. Cells were electroporated using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) at a setting of 250 V and 975 microfarads, in cuvettes containing 2 × 107 cells in 0.4 ml of serum-free RPMI 1640 and 20 μg of linearized plasmid. After 7 days in culture, cells were sorted for GFP and/or DSRed2 expression using a Cytomation MoFlo (Cytomation, Inc). After an additional 2 weeks in culture, cells were again sorted to obtain stable transfectants with matched fluorescence. Similar levels of surface TCR expression were confirmed. Antibodies—The monoclonal antibody C305 (41Weiss A. Stobo J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1284-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) and UCHT1 (Pharmingen) were used for TCR stimulation. For immunoprecipitation and Western biochemistry the following antibodies were used: BD Living Colors A.v. peptide antibody, BD Living Colors Full-Length A.v. polyclonal antibody, and Living Colors DsRed monoclonal antibody (Clontech); anti-SOS, anti-Gab2, and anti-Gads (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.); and anti-Grb2 (Transduction Laboratories). Sheep polyclonal anti-SLP-76 was prepared as described previously (40Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Wu J. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1937-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations and Western Blots—Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing a 1:100 dilution of a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the following protein phosphatase inhibitors: 400 μm sodium vanadate, 10 μm sodium fluoride, and 10 μm sodium pyrophosphate. Lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE for examination of the indicated proteins or were subjected to immunoprecipitation. For each immunoprecipitation, 4 μg of antibody were conjugated to GammaBind Plus-Sepharose Beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 12 h; lysates were tumbled with the antibody-conjugated beads for 4 h at 4 °C; and the immune complexes were washed three times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblot analysis using the indicated antibodies. Isolation of GEM Fractions—1 × 108 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and rested at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 30 min. Cells were lysed at 4 °C for 10 min and resuspended after 5 min in 1 ml of MES-buffered saline (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described above. The lysates were then mixed with 1 ml of 80% sucrose in MES-buffered saline and transferred to ultracentrifuge tubes. The samples were overlaid with 2 ml of 30% sucrose in MES-buffered saline, followed by 1 ml of 5% sucrose in MES-buffered saline, all at 4 °C. The Triton-insoluble fractions were separated from the cell lysates by ultracentrifugation for 18 h at 44,000 rpm in a Beckman SW55Ti rotor at 4 °C (no break). Fractions (350-μl) were removed sequentially starting from the top of the gradient. Measurement of T Cell Activation Markers—Cells at 5 × 105/ml were cultured for 18 h in wells containing media alone, media containing 20 ng/ml PMA, or in media-containing wells that had earlier been coated with C305 antibody. To prepare antibody-coated wells, C305 ascites was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline at 1:50,000, allowed to incubate at 37 °C for 4 h in 48-well dishes, and aspirated prior to transfer of cells for stimulation. After overnight culture, cells were stained with APC-anti-CD69 (Pharmingen), and surface expression of activation markers was analyzed on a FACSCalibur cytometer (BD Biosciences). Calcium Flux—Intracellular free Ca2+ measurement was performed as described previously (42Peterson E.J. Woods M.L. Dmowski S.A. Derimanov G. Jordan M.S. Wu J.N. Myung P.S. Liu Q.H. Pribila J.T. Freedman B.D. Shimizu Y. Koretzky G.A. Science. 2001; 293: 2263-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were loaded with 2 μg/ml of the ratiometric dye Indo-1 at 37 °C for 30 min. Base-line Ca2+ levels were measured for 30 s after which time cells were stimulated with C305 antibody. Calcium mobilization was detected by flow cytometry on a LSR Benchtop Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc.), and histograms represent the average ratio of FL5/FL4 fluorescence over time. Roughly 500-1000 events were collected per s. Luciferase Assay—2 × 107 cells were transfected with 25 μg of the NF-AT reporter construct (a gift from G. Crabtree, Stanford University), using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) as described above. After 24 h, 5 × 105 cells/well were placed into 96-well dishes and cultured for 6 h in media containing C305 antibody (1:10,000), C305 antibody (1:10,000) plus 20 ng/ml PMA, 20 ng/ml PMA plus 1 μm ionomycin, or were left unstimulated. Luciferase activity was assessed as per the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). To standardize for transfection efficiency, luciferase light units were normalized to values obtained upon treatment with PMA plus ionomycin. Cellular Imaging—As described previously, the formation and translocation of signaling complexes in Jurkat variant T cells were monitored using a modified T cell spreading assay (43Bunnell S.C. Barr V.A. Fuller C.L. Samelson L.E. Science's STKE. 2003; http:/www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2003/PL8PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, four-chambered cover glasses (Lab-Tek II, Nunc/Nalgene) were coated with UCHT1, warmed, and pre-loaded with 1 ml of normal culture media supplemented with 25 mm Hepes. To initiate an assay, 2 μl of cells at ∼2 × 106 cell/ml were injected into the chambers immediately above the aperature of the objective. Jurkat variants were visualized using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Ultraview spinning wheel confocal system equipped with an Orca-ERII CCD camera (Hamamatsu) standard fluorescein isothiocyanate and TRITC filter sets suitable for the detection of EGFP and DSRed2, respectively. For these live studies, samples were illuminated with the 488- and 568-nm laser lines from a krypton/argon laser. Live images were collected as vertical Z-stacks and then subsampled for the plane of the coverslip. Images were collected using a 63× Plan-Apochromat objective (Carl Zeiss). The temperature of the sample was maintained at 37 °C by using a hot air blower (Nevtek) and an objective heater (Bioptechs). Expression of SLP-76 Proteins with Mutations in the Gads and/or PLCγ1 Binding Domains—Previous studies revealed multiple domains within SLP-76 that mediate protein/protein interactions (Fig. 1). The Gads binding domain was initially mapped to a 20-amino acid stretch within the central region of SLP-76 (Δ20 region) (24Liu S.K. Fang N. Koretzky G.A. McGlade C.J. Curr.

A minimal Gads-binding region of SLP-76 (G2 domain) has now been identified; by using peptide arrays, it was determined that an Arg-X-X-Lys SH3-binding motif confers specificity for the interaction between Gads and SLP-76 in T cell signaling (25Berry D.M. Nash P. Liu S.K. Pawson T. McGlade C.J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1336-1341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Recently, the P1 domain, a 67-amino acid stretch of the SLP-76 proline-rich region that is distinct from the Gads-binding region, has been shown to associate with PLCγ1 (26Yablonski D. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4208-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Whereas SLP-76-deficient Jurkat T cells (J14 cells) stably transfected with WT SLP-76 signal normally through the TCR, cells reconstituted with either Δ20 or P1 deletion mutants of SLP-76 demonstrate incomplete functional rescue (26Yablonski D. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4208-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To characterize further the roles of the G2 and P1 domains of SLP-76 individually and in combination, in T cell signaling we created stable J14 cell lines expressing WT and mutant forms of SLP-76 (Fig. 2A). All SLP-76 constructs were tagged at their amino terminus with green fluorescent protein (GFP), and stable transfectants, matched for mean fluorescence intensity, were acquired through high speed cell sorting (Fig. 2B). To avoid the possibility of clonal variation artifact, we chose to study these discrete polyclonal populations. Equivalent expression of the SLP-76 constructs was confirmed by anti-GFP immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2C). Both the P1 and G2 Domains of SLP-76 Are Required for Optimal T Cell Activation—We first examined the capacity of the proline domain mutants to reconstitute signaling in J14 cells. Following TCR engagement, cleavage of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate yields inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol (34Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1984; 312: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (4254) Google Scholar). The liberation of intracellular calcium through the activity of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, necessary for activation of the calcineurin-dependent signaling pathway, is absent in J14 cells (8Yablonski D. Kuhne M.R. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 281: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Thus, we assessed the capacity of the J14 stable transfectants to flux intracellular calcium following TCR stimulation. To ensure fusion of GFP onto the amino terminus of SLP-76 does not alter SLP-76 function, we compared TCR-induced Ca2+ mobilization in J14 cells reconstituted with SLP-76 fused or not fused to GFP. As shown in Fig. 3A, the responses were indistinguishable, indicating that GFP/SLP-76 functions as wild type in the Jurkat-based assay. Moreover, GFP/SLP-76 appears to function similarly to the unfused molecule in vivo as reconstitution of SLP-76-deficient mice with GFP/SLP-76 leads to normal T cell development (data not shown). Analysis of the mutant constructs revealed that whereas the WT-reconstituted cells demonstrate robust Ca2+ mobilization after TCR ligation, this response is partially diminished in the G2 and P1 mutants and nearly absent in the P1/G2 double mutant (Fig. 3B). It should be noted that the degree of Ca2+ mobilization in WT-reconstituted J14 cells is similar to that detected in the parental Jurkat line and that all cells respond equivalently to treatment with ionomycin (data not shown). Whereas CD69 is expressed normally by J14 cells following treatment with PMA, reflecting intact signaling through the Ras/MAPK pathway, they do not demonstrate TCR-inducible CD69 expression (8Yablonski D. Kuhne M.R. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 281: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). As another measure of T cell function, we examined the reconstituted J14 cell lines for their capacity to up-regulate CD69 following overnight stimulation (Fig. 3C). The pattern of response mirrors that seen in the calcium flux studies described above: normal CD69 up-regulation following TCR engagement in the WT transfectants, impaired expression in the G2 and P1 mutants, and no response by the P1/G2 double transfectants. All cells responded equally to pharmacologic treatment with PMA. TCR-inducible activation of the NF-AT transcription factor, dependent upon integration of signals through both calcium and Ras/MAPK pathways (44Ullman K.S. Northrop J.P. Verweij C.L. Crabtree G.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 421-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), is also grossly impaired in J14 cells. Thus, as an additional means by which to determine functional rescue by the SLP-76 mutants, we transiently transfected the stable cell lines with an NF-AT-luciferase reporter construct and assessed NF-AT activation following TCR stimulation (Fig. 3D). Here we found restoration of T cell activation in the WT-reconstituted cells and minimal responses by the cells expressing G2, P1, or P1/G2 domain mutants of SLP-76. Disruption of the SLP-76/Gads Association Blocks SLP-76 Recruitment Following TCR Stimulation—One critical step in transducing signals from cell surface proteins is the subcellular redistribution of signaling molecules following receptor engagement (45Bromley S.K. Burack W.R. Johnson K.G. Somersalo K. Sims T.N. Sumen C. Davis M.M. Shaw A.S. Allen P.M. Dustin M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 375-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). Biochemical data suggest that an important role of the association of Gads with SLP-76 is to mediate TCR-induced recruitment of SLP-76 and its binding partners to the immunologic synapse, the interface between the T cell and antigen-presenting cell (24Liu S.K.

https://openalex.org/W2000469412,"The 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of an mRNA plays an important role in translation initiation in eukaryotes. A minimal length of about 20 nucleotides is required to prevent leaky ribosome scanning. In one of the most primitive eukaryotes, Giardia lamblia, however, the mRNAs have 5′-UTRs mostly in the range of 0 to 14 nucleotides without a conserved sequence, which raises the question on how the ribosome could effectively scan such short 5′-UTRs for an accurate initiation of translation. In the present study, we expressed capped transcripts of luciferase gene in Giardia trophozoites via transfection and observed that when the 5′-UTR of the transcript was lengthened from 9 to 21 nucleotides, there was a corresponding decrease of translation efficiency. Conversely, shortening of the 5′-UTR from nine nucleotides down to a single nucleotide did not result in any reduced translation or leaky scanning. Translation appeared to initiate exclusively from the first initiation codon located downstream from the cap. Experimental evidence indicated also that a stem-loop structure immediately downstream from the initiation codon exerted significant inhibition on translation initiation when the 5′-UTR consisted of less than seven nucleotides. This inhibitory effect was abolished by increasing the distance between the stem-loop and the cap-G structure either upstream or downstream from the start codon, thus suggesting a spatial requirement for effective ribosome recruitment. Overall, our results suggest an absence of ribosome scanning for AUG in initiating translation in Giardia. A capped mRNA with a single nucleotide leader is apparently sufficient for recruiting ribosome and initiating translation. The 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of an mRNA plays an important role in translation initiation in eukaryotes.

Overall, our results suggest an absence of ribosome scanning for AUG in initiating translation in Giardia. A capped mRNA with a single nucleotide leader is apparently sufficient for recruiting ribosome and initiating translation. The 5′-untranslated regions (UTRs) 1The abbreviations used are: UTR, untranslated region; RT, reverse transcription; DMS, dimethyl sulfate; CMCT, 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)-carbodiimide; nt, nucleotide; SL, stem-loop. of mRNA molecules in eukaryotes have an average length of about 90 nucleotides in mammals (1Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4169) Google Scholar) and 52 nucleotides in yeast (2Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Gene. 1987; 59: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Shortening the 5′-UTR was found to place the first AUG codon in an increasingly unfavorable context for in vitro translation initiation, resulting in leaky scanning (3Kozak M. Gene Expr. 1991; 1: 111-115PubMed Google Scholar). The yield of protein initiated from the first AUG codon was progressively decreased, whereas that derived from the second AUG downstream from it was correspondingly increased. In a systematic in vitro experiment, about half of the ribosomes bypassed the first AUG codon and initiated instead at a downstream AUG site when the first AUG was within 12 nucleotides from the m7GpppN cap (3Kozak M. Gene Expr. 1991; 1: 111-115PubMed Google Scholar). The leakiness was suppressed when the leader sequence was lengthened to 20 nucleotides. Further lengthening of the 5′-UTR beyond 20 nucleotides indicated a linear increase of the efficiency of translation up to 80 nucleotides (4Kozak M. Gene Expr. 1991; 1: 117-125PubMed Google Scholar). The scanning leakiness could be also reduced by introducing a modest amount of secondary structure downstream from the first AUG, presumably via slowing down the rate of ribosome scanning (5Kozak M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8301-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Giardia lamblia is an anaerobic protozoan that infects the small intestines of humans and many other mammals. It is classified as one of the deeply branched and most primitive eukaryotes based on phylogenetic analysis of its small ribosomal RNA and many other proteins (6Adam R.D. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 447-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 7Inagaki Y. Ford Doolittle W. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2000; 17: 882-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 8Roger A.J. Svard S.G. Tovar J. Clark C.G. Smith M.W. Gillin F.D. Sogin M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 9Sogin M.L. Gunderson J.H. Elwood H.J. Alonso R.A. Peattie D.A. Science. 1989; 243: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Within its small 12-Mb genome, most of the genes reported so far do not contain introns (10Nixon J.E. Wang A. Morrison H.G. McArthur A.G. Sogin M.L. Loftus B.J. Samuelson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3701-3705Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Their transcripts have exceedingly short 5′-UTRs ranging mostly from 0 to 14 nucleotides (11Adam R.D. Int. J. Parasitol. 2000; 30: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and similarly short 3′-UTRs of 10 to 30 nucleotides (11Adam R.D. Int. J. Parasitol. 2000; 30: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). With such unusually short 5′-UTRs that do not share a consensus sequence (12Yu D.C. Wang A.L. Botka C.W. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 96: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), it will be interesting to learn how an optimal accuracy, as well as efficiency of translation, can be maintained and leaky ribosome scanning prevented in Giardia. Similarly short 5′-UTRs have also been identified among the mRNAs from other deeply branched anaerobic protozoa such as Entamoeba histolytica (13Bruchhaus I. Leippe M. Lioutas C. Tannich E. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 925-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and Trichomonas vaginalis (14Davis-Hayman S.R. Shah P.H. Finley R.W. Lushbaugh W.B. Meade J.C. Parasitol. Res. 2000; 86: 608-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These short 5′-UTRs could reflect the presence of a unique protein synthetic machinery in these closely related primitive eukaryotes. In a previous study, we indicated that a priori decapping of the poly(A)+ RNA from G. lamblia was unnecessary for T4 polynucleotide kinase phosphorylation or ligation to oligonucleotides and suggested that much of it could be uncapped at the 5′-ends (12Yu D.C. Wang A.L. Botka C.W. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 96: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). But a subsequent report on the natural abundance of antisense transcripts in Giardia up to 20% of the total poly(A)+ RNA cast some doubt on the real content of mRNA in the sample (15Elmendorf H.G. Singer S.M. Nash T.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4674-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A recently completed Giardia Genome data base showed that many homologues of yeast and human translation initiation factors are present in Giardia. Genes encoding homologues of eIF1 (EAA42222), eIF1A (EAA41151), eIF2 (α, EAA42702; β, EAA38204; γ, AAD04236) (16Keeling P.J. Fast N.M. McFadden G.I. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 47: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), eIF2B (α, EAA38784; β, EAA38691; δ, EAA40267; ϵ, EAA37510), eIF3 (δ, EAA39062), eIF4A (EAA36655), eIF5A (EAA37465), eIF4E (EAA39303), the cap-binding protein, and eIF5 (EAA37306), the putative GTPase-activating protein for eIF2, were identified, suggesting that capped mRNA may be present and translated in this organism. Upon a closer scrutiny, however, homologues of other initiation factors such as eIF4B, eIF4G, and eIF4H are apparently missing. eIF4B and eIF4H are the RNA-binding proteins thought to promote eIF4A to unwind the RNA secondary structure near the 5′-end of the mRNA presumably required for ribosome scanning (17Pestova T.V. Kolupaeva V.G. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2906-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). eIF4G is a scaffold protein interacting with several other initiation factors (18Dever T.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 398-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It contains a novel RNA binding region of 40 amino acid residues critical for ribosome scanning (19Prevot D. Decimo D. Herbreteau C.H. Roux F. Garin J. Darlix J.L. Ohlmann T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1909-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Assuming a cap-mediated translation initiation in Giardia, these missing protein subunits may suggest a simplified protein synthetic machinery that still assembles the mRNA, Met-tRNAmet, and the 40 S ribosome subunit into an initiation complex at the site of 5′-cap without scanning down the mRNA in a 5′ to 3′ direction searching for the AUG start codon (20Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar). This model could be used to explain the presence of unusually short and heterogeneous 5′-UTRs in Giardia mRNAs. In an effort to verify this model, we first demonstrated a longer half-life and much higher level of translation of the capped than the uncapped mRNA in Giardia and proceeded to indicate an apparent absence of ribosome scanning in this organism. The AUG immediately downstream from the cap is recognized as the only initiation codon despite the short distance down to a single nucleotide in between. This simple 5′-cap-G-AUG structure, which provides an optimal translation efficiency in Giardia, suggests a protein synthetic machinery that may bridge the gap between prokaryotes and the advanced eukaryotes. Plasmid Construction—The α2 tubulin 5′-UTR (21Elmendorf H.G. Singer S.M. Pierce J. Cowan J. Nash T.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 113: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22Kirk-Mason K.E. Turner M.J. Chakraborty P.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 36: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) located between T7 promoter and firefly luciferase gene in the plasmid pTub was replaced with the 5′-UTR sequence from the γ giardin gene, AAGAAA, from Giardia (23Nohria A. Alonso R.A. Peattie D.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 56: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) by site-directed mutagenesis following the instructions of the manufacturer (Stratagene) to construct the plasmid pGialuc. Other mutant plasmids were constructed accordingly with the individual mutations verified by subsequent DNA sequencing. The full-length Renilla luciferase gene was amplified by PCR and inserted into a pGEM T easy vector (Promega) with a T7 promoter and an α2 tubulin 5′-UTR located upstream. The recombinant plasmid thus constructed, pRluc, was used for further alterations of its 5′-UTR by site-directed mutagenesis as described above. In Vitro RNA Synthesis—The DNA plasmids were linearized at the 3′-end of firefly luciferase gene with a SacII digestion and purified. Using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion), capped transcript was synthesized from 0.5 μg of the linearized plasmid DNA with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of 12 mm m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G and 3 mm GTP. Poly(A) tails were added to the newly synthesized mRNAs following the instructions from a poly(A) tailing kit (Ambion). The product was purified by the MEGAclear kit (Ambion) and examined for integrity by electrophoresis in a 1.0% agarose gel. The concentration of each mRNA sample was estimated by measuring its absorbance at 260 nm in a Beckman DU7 spectrophotometer. Transfection of Giardia Trophozoites—In vitro culture of Giardia strain WB trophozoites was maintained as described previously (24Wang A.L. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 21: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Serial passages of the in vitro culture were performed at an inoculation ratio of 1:13 once every 3 days into fresh culture medium to maintain a continuous logarithmic cell growth. Transfection of the trophozoites with RNA was performed by electroporation as described previously (25Li L. Wang A.L. Wang C.C. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 10612-10622Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 26Yu D.C. Wang A.L. Wu C.H. Wang C.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 4867-4872Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Logarithmically growing cells were pelleted at 2500 rpm for 10 min and washed twice with the Ca2+-, Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline. Cell pellets (5×105 cells) were suspended in 400 μl of cytomix buffer, mixed with 20 μg of the in vitro transcript and 100 μg of yeast tRNA (Invitrogen) and placed in a 0.2-μm cuvette for 10 min on ice. Electroporation was performed with a Bio-Rad GenePulser set at 0.45-kV voltage and 500-microfared capacitance. Following the electroporation, the cells were transferred into 13 ml of fresh culture medium and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Assay of the luciferase activity in the lysate of transfectants were performed by the instructions of the manufacturer (Promega). The luciferase activity was measured with a luminometer (Monolight 2010; Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA) and registered in relative light units. Protein concentration was determined by the standard Bradford method in a Beckman DU7 spectrophotometer. The specific luciferase activity expressed in each line of Giardia transfectants was determined from at least three independent electroporation experiments with calculated standard deviations. Semi-quantitative Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—The total RNA from RNA-transfected Giardia trophozoites was extracted, and the concentration of each RNA sample was measured spectrophotometrically. An equal quantity of RNA was included as template in each of the semi-quantitative one-step RT-PCR (Invitrogen) using the firefly luciferase gene primers 5′-ATGGAAGACGCCAAAAACATAAAG-3′ and 5′-TTACACGGCGATCTTTCCGCCC-3′ to amplify the full-length transcript of luciferase gene (GenBank™ accession number U03687). The RT-PCR conditions were set at one cycle of reverse transcription at 50 °C for 30 min and 20 cycles of amplification at 94 °C for 15 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The same RT-PCR on the NADH oxidase gene transcript in the same transfected Giardia cells (GenBank™ accession number AF454832) was included as an internal quantitative control using the pair of primers 5′-ATGTCAAACTTACTCTTCAAG-3′ and 5′-TCAGTCCTTCTTGTTTATCGC-3′ for the full-length gene product. Probing the RNA Secondary Structure by Chemical Modification or Enzymatic Digestion and Followed By Primer Extension—The capped in vitro transcript of SacII-restricted GGAUG-Fluc construct was prepared using a T7 RNA polymerase kit (MegaScript; Ambion). The RNA was heated at 70 °C for 15 min and cooled down slowly to room temperature in an ambient water bath for 30 min in a 200-μl non-denaturing probing buffer (80 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl). It was quantified spectrophotometrically, and its integrity was verified by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel. Approximately 5 μg of the in vitro transcript was used in each 300-μl reaction mixture containing either 0.5% dimethyl sulfate (DMS) or 21 mg/ml 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)-carbodiimide (CMCT) (25Li L. Wang A.L. Wang C.C. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 10612-10622Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 35Garlapati S. Chou J. Wang C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 623-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 0, 5, 10 and 20 min and terminated by adding 75 μl of the stop buffer (1 m Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 1 m β-mercaptoethanol, 1.5 m sodium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA). The chemically modified RNA was precipitated by 3 volumes of 100% ethanol. Enzymatic probing of the RNA structure was carried out essentially as described previously (36Garlapati S. Wang C.C. RNA. 2002; 8: 601-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The capped in vitro transcript of GGAUG-Fluc (2 μg), together with 4 μg of yeast tRNA, was denatured in the 1× RNA structure buffer (Ambion) at 65 °C for 15 min and then cooled slowly to ambient temperature within 30 min. The renatured RNA sample was digested with RNase V1, which recognizes only double-stranded RNA as substrate (Ambion), at 10-fold serially diluted enzyme concentrations at room temperature for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by adding phenol-chloroform to extract the remaining RNA molecules, which were subsequently pelleted by ethanol in the presence of 0.3 m NaOAc and dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. The sites of chemical modification or RNase V1 digestion in the RNA molecule were mapped by primer extension using the reverse transcriptase Superscript III (Invitrogen) with radiolabeled oligonucleotides targeted to the region 20 nt downstream from the 3′-end of the postulated stem-loop in the transcript (see Fig. 4A). Briefly, the 32P-5′-end-labeled primers were annealed to ∼1 μg of the chemically modified or RNase V1-digested RNA by incubating the mixture at 75 °C for 15 min followed by another 10 min on ice. Primer extension was carried out at 50 °C for 1 h as specified by the manufacturer. Reaction products were analyzed in an 8% denaturing acrylamide gel along with the sequencing ladders prepared by the fmol cycle-sequencing system (Promega). The chemically modified bases were each identified as a reverse transcriptase stop with a higher mobility 1 nt short of that in the corresponding DNA sequencing gel, because primer extension would stop in front of the modified base. The position of each radiolabeled band in the denaturing gel of primer extension products from RNase V1-digested RNA represented a nucleotide that is cleaved at its 5′-end by the enzyme and had thus the same mobility as that in the corresponding DNA sequencing gel. The Stability and Translation of Capped Luciferase mRNA in Giardia Trophozoites—In vitro transcription of the linearized pGialuc followed by polyadenylation of the in vitro transcript produced the firefly luciferase mRNA with m7G-(5′)ppp(5′)GGAAGAAACC in the 5′-UTR. This in vitro transcript was introduced into Giardia trophozoites via electroporation. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR on the total RNA extracted from the trophozoites 0.25, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 20 h after transfection indicated that the capped luciferase transcript was present in Giardia at a significantly high level 15 min after electroporation, which was slightly decreased after 1 h and appreciably reduced after 2 h but remained still detectable even after 4 h (Fig. 1A). Results from assaying the luciferase activity in the lysate of the transfectants indicated an appreciable and relatively constant level of activity expressed from 1 to 4 h following the transfection (Fig. 1B). In a parallel experiment, introduction of an uncapped, otherwise identical, luciferase mRNA with 5′-GGAAGAAACC in the 5′-UTR into Giardia trophozoites resulted in a shorter intracellular half-life of the mRNA. It was rapidly reduced between 15 min and 1 h after transfection and became virtually undetectable by RT-PCR after 2 h (Fig. 1A). No luciferase activity could be detected in the cell lysate from 15 min to 1 h after transfection, while the uncapped transcript was still detectable by RT-PCR, suggesting that the uncapped mRNA was not or only poorly translated in contrast to the capped mRNA. Thus, the cap-mediated translation initiation is most likely functioning in Giardia. All the subsequent investigations on translation initiation inside Giardia trophozoites were thus conducted with capped mRNAs with the luciferase expression routinely monitored 4 h after transfection. An Increasing Length of 5′-UTR Causes a Corresponding Decrease in Translation Efficiency in Giardia—The 5′-UTR of capped luciferase mRNA studied in Fig. 1 consists of an m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G structure as the cap separated from the initiation codon by a stretch of GAAGAAACC, which is the 5′-UTR of γ-giardin mRNA AAGAAA from Giardia flanked by a 5′-G and a 3′-CC (23Nohria A. Alonso R.A. Peattie D.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 56: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This capped 9-nt UTR enabled translation of its downstream open reading frame to an appreciable level of luciferase activity in Giardia (Fig. 1B). This 5′-UTR was extended to 15, 21, and 27 nucleotides by duplicating, triplicating, and quadrupling the γ-giardin 5′-UTR sequence AAGAAA in pGialuc through site-directed mutagenesis. In vitro transcripts of these three mutants were capped and polyadenylated and individually introduced into Giardia trophozoites. Levels of the transcripts inside Giardia trophozoites 4 h after transfection were monitored by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and shown to be essentially identical to one another (Fig. 2A), indicating a similar in vivo stability. The results on their translation efficiencies, presented in Fig. 2B, indicate that, contrary to what was observed in the in vitro mammalian system (3Kozak M. Gene Expr. 1991; 1: 111-115PubMed Google Scholar), an increase in the length of 5′-UTR leads to a decrease in translation. A 15-nucleotide 5′-UTR led to 58.7 ± 4.5% (Fig. 2B, 2) of the expression level of that from a 9-nucleotide 5′-UTR (Fig. 2B, 1), whereas 21- and 27-nucleotide 5′-UTRs reduced the levels of expression to 15.8 ± 3.5% (Fig. 2B, 3) and 23.2 ± 7.4% (Fig. 2B, 4), respectively. This is the first instance, as far as we are aware, that an increase of 5′-UTR from 9 to 27 nucleotides exerts an inhibitory effect, instead of an enhancing effect, on translation. The observation, however, goes along well with the fact that most 5′-UTRs in the mRNAs of Giardia are between 0 to 14 nucleotides in length (11Adam R.D. Int. J. Parasitol. 2000; 30: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Time courses of the gradual disappearance of these transcripts in Giardia within the ensuing 4 h post-transfection were also monitored by the same procedure described in Fig. 1A. The results presented in Fig. 2C indicate that the rate of disappearance of the transcript with the highest level of expression (Fig. 2C, 1) is essentially identical to that with the lowest level of expression (Fig. 2C, 3). They thus rule out the possibility that the different levels of expression could be because of different time courses of degradation among the transcripts. The Initiation Site Can Be a Single Nucleotide Downstream from the Cap without Causing Reduced Translation or Leaky Ribosome Scanning—The confined length of 5′-UTR for an optimal translation initiation in Giardia raised the question on how much it can be further shortened without compromising the translation efficiency. The original AUG in luciferase mRNA was converted to UUG whereas a new AUG was placed 6 nucleotides upstream from it and separated from the cap by only a single G residue (Fig. 3A, 3). This chimeric mRNA was introduced into Giardia via transfection and reached 87.7 ± 9.7% of the translation level of that with the original 9-nucleotide 5′-UTR (Fig. 3A, 2). There is thus little space required between the cap and AUG for an optimal translation initiation in Giardia. When the downstream UUG in transcript 3 was converted back to AUG in transcript 4, i.e. when a second AUG was introduced 6 nucleotides downstream from the first one that was only one nucleotide away from the cap, the chimeric mRNA thus constructed was expressed at 94.5 ± 22% (Fig. 3A, 4) of the control level in Giardia. However, when the distance between the two AUGs was shortened to 5 nucleotides, the level of expression was reduced to 1.6 ± 0.5% (Fig. 3A, 5) of the control, suggesting that most, if not all, of the translation was initiated from the first AUG, which was now out of phase from the downstream luciferase open reading frame. This aborted translation was not rescued by doubling or tripling the second initiation codon 5 nucleotides downstream from the first AUG (Fig. 3A, 6 and 7), thus indicating a lack of or very little ribosome scanning leakiness that could initiate translation from the downstream AUGs. The absence of such leakiness and the short spacing of only a single nucleotide separating the cap and AUG for optimal translation suggest absence of ribosome scanning during translation initiation in Giardia. The time courses of degradation and eventual levels of individual transcripts in Giardia 4 h after the transfection in the above experiments were also examined with semi-quantitative RT-PCR as described in Figs. 1 and 2. Results in Fig. 3B indicate that transcripts with varying levels of expression (2, 4, and 5) have essentially the same diminishing time course and the same level after 4 h. The distinct levels of expression of these transcripts are thus most likely attributed to the different translation efficiencies. A Postulated Secondary Structure Immediately Downstream from and Including the Start Codon Is Inhibitory to Translation Initiation on a 5′-Capped mRNA with a Single Nucleotide Leader—The absence of ribosome scanning suggests that 5′-cap-G-AUG alone may constitute an adequate basic structure in the mRNA for both 40 S ribosome subunit recruitment and translation initiation in Giardia. Accomplishment of such a task should, however, still require some downstream space from the cap for binding of the various initiation factors and recruitment of the ribosome. Thus, instead of preventing scanning leakiness in mammals (5Kozak M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8301-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), a secondary structure immediately downstream from the initiation codon is expected to have an inhibitory effect on initiating translation of a mRNA with a very short 5′-UTR in Giardia. The native firefly luciferase mRNA has an MFOLD predicted stem-loop structure (SL) immediately downstream from and including the start codon (Fig. 4A). When the distance between the 5′-cap and the start codon of luciferase mRNA is shortened from 9 to 7 nucleotides, a 98.8% expression (Fig. 4A, 2) of the mRNA is still achieved, which is, however, reduced to 46.6 ± 2.9% (Fig. 4A, 3) with 5 nucleotides and 22.7 ± 1.8% (Fig. 4A, 4) and 28.1 ± 3.6% (Fig. 4A, 6) with 3 nucleotides and 1 nucleotide in the 5′-UTR, respectively. To contend with the possibility that the reduced expression of transcript 4 in Fig. 4A could be attributed to the enriched GC content in the shortened sequence, its CC residues were replaced with AA in transcript 5. Expression of the latter in transfected Giardia was 45.4 ± 9.0% of the control (Fig. 4A, 5), which was higher than that of transcript 4, suggesting that the base composition may have some effect on translation initiation. An enriched GC content in the sequence (transcript 4) has an equivalent inhibitory effect as if the stem-loop is pulled 2 nucleotides closer to the cap (transcript 6). The shortened transcripts have, however, consistently lower levels of expression than that of the longer transcripts 1 and 2. To verify whether the inclusion of initiation codon in the postulated stem structure (see Fig. 4A) may have contributed to the reduced translation, an additional AUG initiation codon was placed immediately upstream from the original firefly luciferase AUG (transcript 7) with the anticipation that the newly added AUG, which is apparently not included in the stem structure, will be the real initiation codon (see Fig. 3A). Transcript 7 was expressed at 68.6 ± 5.8% of the control level (Fig. 4A), which is 2.4 times that of the transcript without the extra AUG (Fig. 4A, 6), thus indicating that inclusion of AUG in a secondary structure does reduce translation initiation. This conclusion is further supported by the 66.7 ± 18.9% expression level of transcript 8 (Fig. 4A), in which an AAGAAA sequence was inserted immediately downstream from the original luciferase AUG in transcript 6 to free the initiation codon from the postulated stem structure. Translation initiation was not, however, further enhanced when an additional AAGAAA was inserted immediately upstream from AUG in transcript 8 (Fig. 4A, 9), which resulted in only 51.0 ± 15.2% of the control level, confirming the previous observation that lengthening the distance between the cap and initiation codon does not enhance translation initiation but reduces it instead. The N-terminal portion of firefly luciferase unfortunately plays an essential role in its catalytic function (27Wang X.C. Yang J. Huang W. He L. Yu J.T. Lin Q.S. Li W. Zhou H.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). It cannot be altered extensively enough to destroy the predicted stem-loop structure in the encoding mRNA without eliminating the enzymatic activity as well. The"

The precise physiological functions of all ABCC proteins are not yet fully understood, although several are known to be important in certain genetic disorders. For example, mutations in MRP2 (ABCC2) are responsible for Dubin-Johnson syndrome, a form of congenital conjugated hyperbilirubinemia (7Konig J. Nies A.T. Cui Y. Keppler D. Holland I.B. Cole S.P.C. Kuchler K. Higgins C.F. ABC Transporters: From Bacteria to Man. Academic Press, London2003: 423-443Google Scholar), and mutations in CFTR (ABCC7) cause cystic fibrosis (8Kulczycki L.L. Kostuch M.

Increased expression of MRP1 has been detected in drug-resistant tumor cell lines and tumor tissues, and MRP1 has been demonstrated to mediate ATP-dependent cellular efflux of a wide variety of anticancer drugs and other xenobiotics such as antimony and arsenic-centered oxyanions (3Haimeur A.

MRP1 is expressed in most human tissues, and studies of mice in which the Mrp1 gene has been disrupted have demonstrated that this transporter has a role in inflammation and detoxication (3Haimeur A.

One approach toward understanding the molecular details of the transport mechanism of MRP1 is to identify the amino acid residues critical for its activity by functional analysis of MRP1 mutants created using site-directed mutagenesis. For example, previous studies have identified a number of aromatic, polar, and charged amino acids in or proximal to the TM helices in both MSD2 (amino acids 323–601) and MSD3 (amino acids 972–1248) that play an important role in determining MRP1 transport activity and substrate specificity (23Ito K.

Other studies have shown that Ala substitution of Cys residues in these domains as well as the cytoplasmic and extracytoplasmic regions of MRP1 do not appear to have major effects on its transport function (31Lee S.H. Altenberg G.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 357-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence analyses have shown that Pro residues are more frequently found in TM α-helices of ion channels and transporters than in α-helices of water-soluble proteins (32Brandl C.J. Deber C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Because their backbone N is not available for intrahelical H-bonding, and because of steric constraints caused by their ring structure, Pro residues may introduce “kinks” in TM α-helices, and a role for such Pro residues in substrate binding and/or translocation has been proposed for a number of membrane proteins (32Brandl C.J.

Non-membrane associated Pro residues have also been shown to be important for the function of certain ion channels and transporters (38Ostedgaard L.S. Zeiher B. Welsh M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2091-2098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a previous study, we replaced 12 Pro residues in MSD1 and CL3 of MRP1 with Ala and found that while several of the resulting mutants showed reduced levels of MRP1 expression, the substitutions had little or no effect on LTC4 and E217βG transport (39Ito K. Weigl K.E. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1615: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with an interpretation that MSD1 is not critical for conjugated organic anion transport but probably has a role in the stable expression of MRP1 in mammalian cell plasma membranes. In the present study, we have extended this earlier work by investigating the role of the 18 Pro residues that reside in both the non-membrane and TM regions of MSD2 and MSD3, by examining the consequences of replacing these residues with Ala on the expression and function of MRP1. Many of these Pro residues are highly conserved in other human ABCC family members and MRP1 orthologs in other species (Table I). Thus, the findings of our study may have implications for the structure-function analysis of other ABCC proteins.Table IConservation of MRP1 MSD2 and MSD3 Pro residues in human ABCC family membersPositionMRP1MRP3MRP2MRP6SUR1SUR2MRP7MRP4MRP5CFTRMSD2323ProSerMetSerGlyGlyArgLysThrTrp343ProProProProProAsnProProProPro359ProProTyrProPhePheProAlaAsnGlu448ProProValLeuProProProProProPro464ProProProProValSerValIleProAla478ProProProProProProProProProLeu557ProProProThrProProProSerValGly595ProProProAlaProProProThrAlaAla600ProProProProSerPheProPheProPheMSD31003ProAlaSerProAlaLysGlnGlyGln1060ProProProProProProProProProPro1068ProProProProProProProProProLys1088ProAlaProProProProProProProPro1113ProProProProProProProProProPro1120ProLeuIleLeuLeuLeuProValGlyVal1121ProProProProProProProProProPro1150ProProProSerProProProProProPro1191ProProSerProPhePheAlaLeuLeuLeu Open table in a new tab We found that all but one of the singly substituted MRP1 Pro mutants (P1113A) could be expressed in HEK cells at levels comparable with the wild-type protein. In addition, five mutants containing substitutions of Pro residues predicted to be in or proximal to the TM helices of MSD2 (TM6-Pro343, TM8-Pro448, TM10-Pro557, and TM11-Pro595) and MSD3 (TM14-Pro1088) exhibited significantly reduced transport of five structurally diverse organic anion substrates of MRP1, whereas TM9 mutant P478A showed a selective reduction in LTC4 and GSH transport and an increase in E217βG, E13SO4, and MTX transport. Unexpectedly, a mutant containing a substitution of Pro1150 predicted to be in the cytoplasmic loop (CL7) linking TM15 to TM16 showed markedly increased levels of E217βG and MTX transport, whereas transport of other organic anions was reduced or unchanged. The altered transport activity of P1150A was associated with significant changes in the ATP dependence of E217βG but not LTC4 transport, suggesting that CL7 may play a differential role in coupling the activity of the MRP1 NBDs to the translocation of different substrates across the membrane.

The template for mutagenesis of Pro residues in MSD2 was prepared by cloning a 1.9-kb BamHI/SphI fragment (containing nucleotides 841–2701 encoding amino acids 281–900) from pcDNA3.1(–)-MRP1K into pBluescriptSK(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) into which a SphI site had been introduced into the multiple cloning site (24Koike K.

The template for mutagenesis of Pro residues in MSD3 was prepared by cloning a 2-kb XmaI fragment (containing nucleotides 2337–4322 encoding amino acids 780–1440) from pcDNA3.1(–)-MRP1K into pGEM-3Z (Promega, Madison, WI) (23Ito K.

After confirming all mutations by sequencing or diagnostic restriction enzyme digests, the 1-kb BamHI/Bsu36I fragment (MSD2 Pro mutants) and the 1.3-kb BsmBI/EcoRI fragment (MSD3 Pro mutants) were subcloned back into pcDNA3.1(–)-MRP1K, and the fragments in the full-length constructs were sequenced once again. Transfections of MRP1 Expression Vectors in Human Embryonic Kidney Cells—Wild-type and mutant pcDNA3.1(–)-MRP1K expression vectors were transfected into SV40-transformed human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T). For membrane vesicle preparations, ∼7 × 106 cells were seeded per 15-cm dish and transfected 24 h later with 16 μg of plasmid DNA using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 60 h, the HEK293T cells were harvested, and membrane vesicles were prepared as described previously (40Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9675-9682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Empty vector and vector containing the wild-type cDNAs were included as controls in all experiments. Transfections were also carried out with a second independently generated clone of each mutant so that clonal variation could be excluded as an explanation for any changes in expression levels and/or transport activities observed. Measurement of MRP1 Protein Levels in Transfected Cells—The levels of wild-type and mutant MRP1 proteins were determined by immunoblot analysis of membrane protein fractions from transfected cells essentially as described (41Hipfner D.R.

Proteins were resolved on a 6–7% polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred to Immobilon™ P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Blots were blocked with 4% (w/v) skim milk powder for 1 h followed by incubation with the human MRP1-specific monoclonal antibody QCRL-1 (diluted 1:10,000) (42Hipfner D.R. Gauldie S.D. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5788-5792PubMed Google Scholar, 43Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Stride B.D. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3307-3314PubMed Google Scholar). After washing, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Pierce) followed by application of Renaissance chemiluminescence blotting substrate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to film. Relative levels of MRP1 protein expression were estimated by densitometric analysis using a ChemiImager™ 4000 (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). To confirm equal protein loading of the gel lanes, the blots were also stained with Amido Black. MRP1-mediated Transport by Membrane Vesicles—Membrane vesicles were prepared from transiently transfected HEK293T cells, and ATP-dependent transport of 3H-labeled substrates by the membrane vesicles was measured using a rapid filtration technique as described previously (40Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9675-9682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Briefly, LTC4 transport assays were performed at 23 °C in a 50-μl reaction containing 50 nm LTC4 (40 nCi per reaction), 4 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, an ATP-regenerating system (10 mm creatine phosphate, 100 μg ml–1 creatine kinase), and 2 μg of vesicle protein in transport buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.4). Control uptake assays contained 4 mm AMP, and the regenerating system was omitted. Uptake was stopped at the desired time by rapid dilution in ice-cold buffer, and then the reaction was filtered through glass-fiber filters presoaked in transport buffer. Radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. All data were corrected for the amount of [3H]LTC4 that remained bound to the filter, which was usually <10% of the total radioactivity. Transport in the presence of AMP was subtracted from transport in the presence of ATP to determine ATP-dependent LTC4 uptake. All transport assays were carried out in triplicate, and results are expressed as means (±S.D.). Uptake of [3H]E217βG was measured in a similar fashion, except that membrane vesicles (2 μg of protein) were incubated at 37 °C in a total reaction volume of 50 μl containing 400 nm E217βG (40 nCi per reaction) and the components as described for LTC4 transport. [3H]E13SO4 uptake was performed at 37 °C in a 50-μl total reaction volume containing membrane vesicles (2 μg of protein), 300 nm E13SO4 (100 nCi per reaction), in the presence of 3 mm GSH and 10 mm dithiothreitol and the same components described above (16Qian Y.M.

Apigenin-stimulated [3H]GSH uptake was also measured by rapid filtration with membrane vesicles (20 μg of protein) incubated at 37 °C for 20 min in a 60-μl reaction volume with 100 μm [3H]GSH (120 nCi per reaction) and 30 μm apigenin (13Leslie E.M. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2003; 31: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To minimize GSH catabolism by γ-glutamyltranspeptidase during transport, membranes were preincubated with 0.5 mm acivicin for 10 min at 37 °C prior to measuring [3H]GSH uptake. [3H]MTX uptake was performed at 37 °C for 20 min in a 50-μl total reaction volume containing membrane vesicles (10 μg of protein), 100 μm MTX (200 nCi per reaction), and the same components described above (26Haimeur A.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4779-4784PubMed Google Scholar), whereas [3H]leucovorin uptake was performed at 37 °C for 20 min in a 50-μl total reaction volume containing membrane vesicles (10 μg of protein) and 250 μm leucovorin (500 nCi per reaction). Kinetic Analysis of ATP-dependent [3H]LTC4 and [3H]E217βG Transport—Km and Vmax values of ATP-dependent LTC4 transport by membrane vesicles (4 μg of protein) were determined by measuring uptake at eight different [3H]LTC4 concentrations (10–1000 nm) for 1 min at 23 °C in 50 μl of transport buffer containing components as described above. Kinetic parameters for [3H]E217βG uptake were determined by measuring uptake at eight different [3H]E217βG concentrations (0.25–25 μm) for 1 min at 37 °C as before. The apparent Km value for ATP was determined by measuring initial rates of [3H]LTC4 and [3H]E217βG uptake in the presence of 10 different concentrations of nucleotide (2–4000 μm). Data were analyzed using Graph Pad Prism™ software and kinetic parameters determined by non-linear regression and Michaelis-Menten analyses. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from transfected HEK cells using a PureScript RNA isolation kit (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA (5 μg) was resolved on a 1% agarose gel containing 0.66 m formaldehyde and transferred onto a Magna charge nylon membrane (Micron Separations, Westborough, MA) by capillary action and cross-linked to the membrane by exposure to UV light. The membrane was probed with a human MRP1 1.8-kb EcoRI cDNA fragment that had been radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP (specific activity, 3000 Ci mmol–1) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by random priming (Invitrogen, Random Primers DNA labeling system) (9Cole S.P.C.

Confocal Microscopy—HEK293T cells transfected with the MRP1 constructs were seeded at 3.5 × 105 cells per well in a 6-well plate on coverslips coated with 0.1% gelatin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Forty-eight hours later, the coverslips were washed with PBS, and cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized by adding 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. The coverslips were incubated with MRP1-specific mAb QCRL-3 (diluted 1:2,500 in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS containing 10 μgml–1 RNase A and 1% bovine serum albumin) for 60 min (41Hipfner D.R. Mao Q.

The coverslips were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Fab′)2 fragment in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS containing 2 μg ml–1 propidium iodide and then placed on slides containing 1 drop of Antifade Solution (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Cells were examined using a Leica TCS SP2 MS multiphoton system confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany) as before (39Ito K. Weigl K.E. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1615: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Photolabeling of MRP1 with [3H]LTC4—Membrane proteins were photolabeled with [3H]LTC4 essentially as described (40Loe D.W.

https://openalex.org/W2093072501,"We developed a conditional complex I assembly system in a Chinese hamster fibroblast mutant line, CCL16-B2, that does not express the NDUFA1 gene (encoding the MWFE protein). In this mutant, a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged MWFE protein was expressed from a doxycycline-inducible promoter. The expression of the protein was absolutely dependent on the presence of doxycycline, and the gene could be turned off completely by removal of doxycycline. These experiments demonstrated a key role of MWFE in the pathway of complex I assembly. Upon induction the MWFE·HA protein reached steady-state levels within 24 h, but the appearance of fully active complex I was delayed by another ∼24 h. The MWFE appeared in a precomplex that probably includes one or more subunits encoded by mtDNA. The fate of MWFE and the stability of complex I were themselves very tightly linked to the activity of mitochondrial protein synthesis and to the assembly of subunits encoded by mtDNA (ND1–6 and ND4L). This novel conditional system can shed light not only on the mechanism of complex I assembly but emphasizes the role of subunits previously thought of as “accessory.” It promises to have broader applications in the study of cellular energy metabolism and production of reactive oxygen species and related processes.

This novel conditional system can shed light not only on the mechanism of complex I assembly but emphasizes the role of subunits previously thought of as “accessory.” It promises to have broader applications in the study of cellular energy metabolism and production of reactive oxygen species and related processes. The mammalian mitochondrial complex I (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is an assembly of ∼46 distinct proteins encoded by 39 nuclear and 7 mitochondrial genes (1Carroll J. Fearnley I.M. Shannon R.J. Hirst J. Walker J.E. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 117-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Fourteen of these subunits, including all the mtDNA-encoded ones, have orthologues in prokaryotes (2Hirst J. Carroll J. Fearnley I.M. Shannon R.J. Walker J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1604: 135-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). This simpler prokaryotic complex of 14 subunits can perform all the currently known functions of mammalian complex I: NADH oxidation, electron transport from the flavin mononucleotide via several Fe-S centers to a quinone, and proton translocation across the membrane. The roles of the other 32 “accessory” or “supernumerary proteins” in the mammalian complex I are largely unknown. Many of these subunits are also found in fungal and plant complexes. Only a few of these accessory proteins, e.g. the acyl-carrier protein SDAP and the AQDQ and MWFE subunits from Neurospora crassa and mammals have been studied in more detail (3Au H.C. Seo B.B.

Biol. 2003; 329: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Like its mammalian counterpart it was found to be essential for complex I biogenesis. From bacteria to humans, the overall “boot-shaped” structure of complex I is conserved with one arm protruding into the matrix and the other localized in the plane of the membrane (7Guenebaut V. Schlitt A. Weiss H. Leonard K. Friedrich T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 8Guenebaut V. Vioncentelli R. Weiss H. Leonard K.R. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7229-7235Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The matrix arm contains all the prosthetic groups, whereas the function of the large membrane arm is less clear. Recent findings suggest that it is involved in the binding of quinone and inhibitors and proton/ion translocation across the inner membrane (12Gong X. Xie T. Yu L. Hesterberg M. Scheide D. Friedrich T. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25731-25737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Studies with a N. crassa mutant indicate that complex I assembly takes place in discrete steps with independent assembly of membrane and peripheral arms (13Nehls U. Friedrich T. Schmiede A. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 1032-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The attachment of the peripheral arm to the membrane depends upon the assembly of the membrane arm. Although likely, this remains to be proved explicitly for the mammalian complex I assembly. Differences in the biogenesis of complex I between N. crassa and humans have been noticed, for example, with regard to the exact role of the AQDQ subunit. In N. crassa, the AQDQ homologue is not essential for complex I assembly and rotenone-sensitive activity (5Ferreirinha F. Duarte M. Melo A.M. Videira A. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 551-554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in human patients with a homozygous mutation in the NDUFS4 gene (AQDQ subunit) complex I assembly is severely affected (14Papa S.

Previous studies from this laboratory have characterized a Chinese hamster mutant cell completely deficient in the MWFE subunit (encoded by the X-linked NDUFA1 gene) (3Au H.C. Seo B.B.

However, several subunits of the peripheral membrane subcomplex were present in this mutant at a normal or near normal level. Thus, the MWFE protein appears to be required for either the assembly and/or stability of complex I. At the same time, MWFE by itself is quite unstable in mutants defective either in complete mitochondrial protein synthesis or in the absence of single mtDNA-encoded ND subunits (Ref. 4Yadava N.

Experiments presented in this communication describe the development and characterization of a cell line in which complex I assembly is conditional, depending upon the induction of the MWFE subunit. The HA 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; DME, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's; BN, blue native; Tet, tetracycline. 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; DME, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's; BN, blue native; Tet, tetracycline. epitope-tagged MWFE protein (MWFE·HA) was expressed from a doxycycline-inducible promoter. Using this system, the CCL16-B2 cells that lack complex I and were completely respiration-deficient (res-) could be made respiration-competent (res+) after the addition of doxycycline to the growth medium. This model system permitted more detailed questions to be raised about the exact role of the MWFE protein in 1) the assembly, 2) the kinetics of assembly, 3) the maintenance of the complex I, and 4) the stability/accumulation of MWFE subunits in relation to mitochondrial protein synthesis and the incorporation of the ND subunits into a mature complex I.

The res- cells grow normally in DME medium with an abundant supply of glucose (DME-Glu) to sustain glycolysis and a supplement of nonessential amino acids. Substitution of glucose with galactose (DME-Gal) in the medium represents the non-permissive condition for res- cells. Routinely the medium contained 10% fetal bovine serum and the antibiotics gentamicin and Fungizone. We thank Drs. Attardi and A. Chomyn for sending us their mouse cell lines (3A-20-4 and 4A) with null mutations in ND5 and ND6 subunits and human cell line 4TL with a null mutation in ND4 subunit (23Chomyn A. J. Bioenerg.

The pTRE-2 vector was digested with XhoI, end-filled with Klenow polymerase, and redigested with EcoRI to excise the human cytomegalovirus-1 promoter. This XhoI-EcoRI fragment was ligated with the larger SspI-EcoRI fragment of pIS2022. The resulting inducible construct (pIS2022i) was identified by its smaller size and diagnostic SacII digestion. Further the pIS2022i was modified to express the activator protein (rtTA) from the same construct. This was achieved by taking out the smaller Bst1107I-BsaI fragment (3579 bp) and ligating it with the larger Bst1107I-BsaI fragment (3884 bp) of pIS2022i. The final construct, which can express both the regulator protein (rtTA) and the inducible proteins (MWFE·HA and NeoR), was named pTRE ON.

The CCL16-B2 cells (5 × 105) with the NDUFA1 null mutation were seeded in a 6-well tissue culture plate overnight and then transfected with the regulator plasmid pTet-ON (Clontech). Stable transfectants were selected in the presence of 800 μg/ml Geneticin (G418). These transfectants were retransfected with the inducible construct pIS2022i. The superscript “i” and “c” refer to inducible and constitutive expression of MWFE·HA from the vector. After the transfection, the cells were induced with variable concentrations of doxycycline for ∼48 h and then selected in DME-Gal. The selective medium was routinely changed every 48 h to replenish it with fresh doxycycline. The V79-G7 cells were transfected with the pTRE ON construct and selected with G418 in the presence of doxycycline, after 48 h of induction, in DME-Glu medium as described above. V79-G7 cells expressing the inducible MWFE·HA were named G7-MWFE·HAi. Northern Analysis—Northern analysis was performed as described previously using a hamster NDUFA1 cDNA probe (3Au H.C. Seo B.B. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Scheffler I.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4354-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A probe for human citrate synthase mRNA was made by reverse transcription PCR with oligonucleotide primers CS.F1 (5′-ATGGCTTTACTTACTGCGGC-3′) and CS.R1 (5′-CACATGGGAAGGCAGAGCTG-3′), which amplify a 453-bp cDNA beginning with the ATG start codon. Additionally Chinese hamster DDP1 (Timm81a) cDNA was also used as a probe for monitoring RNA loading. Measurement of Respiratory Activities—The respiratory chain activities of various cells were measured as described previously (4Yadava N. Potluri P. Smith E. Bisevac A. Scheffler I.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21221-21230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 24Seo B.B. Kitajima-Ihara T. Chan E.K.L. Scheffler I.E. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The cells were harvested by trypsinization, collected by centrifugation (350 × g), and resuspended in 1× HSM buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.1, 250 mm sucrose, and 10 mm MgCl2) at a density of 2 × 107 cells/ml. Cells were permeabilized by digitonin (100 μg/ml) treatment until ∼90% of the cells could be stained with trypan blue. After ∼5-min digitonin treatment at 4 °C, the cell suspension was diluted 10-fold with HSM buffer, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation. Subsequently, after one wash, cells were resuspended at a density of 3 × 107 cells/ml. The total protein content was measured by Bradford microassay, and ∼5–6 mg of cell suspension was used per assay. Oxygen consumption was measured polarographically with a Clark oxygen electrode in a 2.2-ml metabolic chamber with a water jacket maintained at 37 °C. Substrates, inhibitors, etc. could be added via a capillary opening using microsyringes as described previously (4Yadava N. Potluri P. Smith E. Bisevac A. Scheffler I.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21221-21230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Isolation of Mitochondria and Mitochondrial Fractions—Mitochondria were isolated from cells essentially according to Ref. 25Trounce I.A. Kim Y.L. Jun A.S. Wallace D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 484-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Approximately 1 × 109 cells were washed twice with TD buffer and harvested by trypsinization. The pellets were suspended in 5 ml of SM buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 2 mm EDTA) and homogenized using a tightly fitting Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer (30–35 up/down strokes). The homogenate was centrifuged twice at 625 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove unbroken cells and nuclei. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The mitochondrial pellet was suspended in 0.1 ml of SM buffer. This fraction was designated as the mitochondrial fraction. Immunochemical Assays and Antibodies—The lysis of cells was carried out in buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, with protease inhibitor mixture P8340 from Sigma) by three cycles of freeze-thaw in liquid nitrogen and three bursts of sonication. Protein samples (between 50 and 100 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P (0.45 μm) or polyvinylidene difluoride (0.1 μm) membranes. Anti-MWFE was used at 1:5000 dilution, whereas the other antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilution. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit or anti-mouse) were used at 1:5000 dilution, and signals on the immunoblots were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL Plus from Amersham Biosciences). The anti-MWFE was developed as described previously (4Yadava N. Potluri P. Smith E. Bisevac A. Scheffler I.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21221-21230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Anti-51 kDa and anti-PSST (Rhodobacter capsulatus) were generous gifts from Drs. Y. Hatefi and T. Yagi (The Scripps Research Institute). Antiserum against the mammalian SDHC subunit was generously provided by Dr. B. Ackrell (University of California, San Francisco). Sources of other antibodies were as follows. Anti-20 kDa/PSST, anti-30 kDa, anti-39 kDa, and anti-ATP5β (all human) were from Molecular Probes; anti-porin was from Calbiochem; anti-HA was from Covance BabCo; anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were from Bio-Rad and Amersham Biosciences, respectively. Blue Native (BN)-PAGE—Mitochondrial respiratory complexes were separated by BN-PAGE essentially as described previously (26Schagger H. Pon L.A. Schon E.A. Mitochondria. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2001: 231-244Google Scholar). Mitochondrial pellets equivalent to 400 μg of protein were solubilized with 800 g of dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (Sigma) in 5 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid, 50 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.0), and 10% glycerol. To the solubilized samples Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (Serva) was added at a dye/detergent ratio of 1:5 (w/w). A 4–13% acrylamide gradient gel was used for electrophoresis. The NADH dehydrogenase assay was carried out using substrate deamino-NADH and nitro blue tetrazolium, an artificial electron acceptor, as described previously (4Yadava N. Potluri P. Smith E. Bisevac A. Scheffler I.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21221-21230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 27Dabbeni-Sala F. Di Santo S. Franceschini D. Skaper S.D. Giusti P. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Gel slices were incubated at room temperature in 2 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mg/ml deamino-NADH (generously provided by Dr. T. Friedrich, University of Freiburg), and 2.5 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma) for 2–4 h. After complex I staining the same gels were washed twice (10 min) with 1.5 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and stained for complex II activity with a similar protocol except that succinate (84 mm) was used as the substrate in the presence of phenazine methosulfate (0.2 mm), 4.5 mm EDTA, and 10 mm KCN in 1.5 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The blue background from stained gels was cleared by removing the Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 dye electrophoretically using standard Western transfer conditions for ∼3 h. Elimination of the Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 background by transfer did not compromise the quality of stained bands but increased the sensitivity (data not shown). Quantitative Analyses—The signals on Western blots were quantified either by using phosphorimaging systems (Amersham Biosciences STORM 860 and Bio-Rad GS525) or Kodak imaging systems equipped with ImageQuant, Molecular Analyst, and Kodak 1D softwares. Other Reagents—Tetracycline-free fetal bovine serum (Tet System Approved) was obtained from Clontech. All other reagents were of the highest grade available. Selection and Characterization of Cells Expressing MWFE·HA Conditionally—To develop a conditional complex I assembly system, we expressed MWFE·HA from a doxycycline-inducible promoter in the previously described MWFE-null cells (CCL16-B2) (3Au H.C. Seo B.B. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Scheffler I.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4354-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 4Yadava N. Potluri P. Smith E. Bisevac A. Scheffler I.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21221-21230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Stable, transfected CCL16-B2 cells, expressing rtTA activator constitutively, were retransfected with the inducible construct pIS2022i and selected in DME-Gal medium in the presence of different doses of doxycycline (0.01–2.00 μg/ml). The parental CCL16-B2 cells die within 24 h in DME-Gal medium, and this condition was used for the selection of double transfectants with the res+ phenotype, i.e. with a functional oxidative phosphorylation system (see “Experimental Procedures”). Selected populations or individual clones with desirable features (no background and maximal induction) were used for all the experiments in the present study. Doxycycline was added to the cells growing in DME-Glu, and MWFE·HA protein levels were measured by Western blotting after 72 h. A dose-response curve (Fig. 1A) showed that the maximal MWFE·HA induction was achieved in the presence of 2 μg/ml doxycycline in the medium. We compared the inducible cell line (B2-MWFE·HAi) with the constitutive cell line (B2-MWFE·HAc) with regard to the maximal MWFE·HA protein expression (Fig. 1B). The MWFE·HA protein was present only in the presence of doxycycline in B2-MWFE·HAi cells where its level appeared to be somewhat lower than that in the B2-MWFE·HAc cells. The constitutive and induced transcript levels were found to be comparable in both cell lines. In the absence of doxycycline, the constitutive MWFE·HA level was higher because even at 2 μg/ml concentration the doxycycline interfered partially with mitochondrial protein synthesis. The inhibitory effect at 2 μg/ml was more pronounced in hamster cells than in human HT1080 cells (data not shown). It should be noted that no transcript or protein was detected in the absence of inducer (Fig. 1B). Thus, there was no significant leaky expression in these cells, and the transcription was absolutely dependent on the presence of the doxycycline. The maximal doxycycline dose (2 μg/ml) applied during selection of B2-MWFE·HAi cells was chosen based on a preliminary growth analysis of wild type (CCL16-B1) cells in DME-Gal medium. We did not find a significant reduction in the growth rate (data not shown). However, a Western blot analysis revealed that the level of MWFE was reduced in the presence of doxycycline relative to its absence. At higher doxycycline doses (10 μg/ml or higher), the MWFE·HA induction in B2-MWFE·HAi cells was inhibited even further, while the level of mRNA was increased relative to that at 2 μg/ml doxycycline (Fig. 1C). Upon prolonged culture, some cells appeared in the population in which MWFE·HA was constitutively expressed at a level sustaining growth in DME-Gal. The origin of these cells is not quite clear. After recloning, the desired phenotype was stable over a period of months. It should be noted here that the fetal calf serum from normal sources may contain traces of this antibiotic, causing induction, and the clean result observed here was obtained with either dialyzed serum or with a special serum certified to be free of residual antibiotics (Tet-) (Clontech). Time Course of Induction—To find out how quickly the biogenesis of the active complex I takes place in B2-MWFE·HAi cells, we monitored the induction kinetics of MWFE·HA protein by Western analysis, complex I assembly by BN-PAGE, and its activity by polarography and histochemistry. Since the activator protein (rtTA) was expressed constitutively, it was of interest first to measure the time of appearance of the inducible mRNA following the addition of inducer and second to determine how long it would take for MWFE·HA levels to reach steady state. Fig. 2 shows that no transcript was detectable at 0 h, a significant signal was seen at 12 h, and after 12–24 h steady-state levels of mRNA were attained (Fig. 2A). Citrate synthase mRNA served as a loading control for the total RNA in the Northern blot. The MWFE·HA protein appeared at ∼12 h and reached steady-state levels at or shortly after 24 h. During the entire induction period, the levels of porin and the 39-kDa subunit of complex I remained unchanged relative to total proteins loaded (Fig. 2B). The Western analyses were performed with whole cell extracts to monitor the entire cellular pool of MWFE·HA. However, our experiments showed the MWFE·HA to be exclusively associated with the mitochondrial membrane fraction at all times during induction, indicating that there was no delay in the import into mitochondria (data not shown). The induction of complex I activity in B2-MWFE·HAi cells was measured by polarography at various times after induction (Fig. 3A). Rotenone-sensitive, glutamate + malate-driven respiration (oxygen consumption) was measured in digitonin-permeabilized cells, and the activity was normalized with the KCN-sensitive succinate + glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate-driven respiration, representing the downstream portion (complexes II–IV) of the electron transport chain. This approach of normalization was adopted because 2 μg/ml doxycycline used for induction was partially inhibiting the mitochondrial protein synthesis and hence complex III and IV levels (Figs. 1C and 3C). It was unexpected that the appearance of complex I activity was delayed significantly relative to the attainment of steady-state levels of MWFE·HA seen in Western blots with whole cells. An initial small rise after 12 h was followed by a plateau, and a second wave of induction was observed beginning at about 48 h. These kinetics were reproducibly observed in independent experiments (Fig. 3A). The appearance of complex I assembly was also measured by BN-PAGE and the identification of a ∼900-kDa complex that can be detected either by the histochemical NADH dehydrogenase assay or by Western blotting using anti-HA and anti-39 kDa antibodies. The data are shown in Fig. 3, B and C. Both measurements (polarography and BN-PAGE) indicate that the appearance of mature complex I was delayed significantly after the start of induction. It has been experimentally difficult to determine whether the small discrepancy between the curves describing respiratory activity and histochemical activity (at 900 kDa) is significant (Fig. 3A). The former may require incorporation of an assembled complex I into a supercomplex (28Schagger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). A second revealing experiment resembling a pulse-chase experiment was performed as follows. The inducer doxycycline was present for only 24 h (“pulse”) followed by a “chase” in the absence of inducer over several days. The MWFE·HA levels were monitored in whole mitochondria by SDS-PAGE, while BN-PAGE was used to measure assembled MWFE·HA in an intact (900-kDa) complex I. As shown in Fig. 4, at the end of the pulse the total amount of measurable MWFE·HA was at or near steady state, while only a small fraction of it had appeared in a 900-kDa complex I. During the chase, total MWFE·HA levels were maintained for another 24 h, aided by the continued translation of slowly decaying mRNA; the subsequent decline is due to an arrest in synthesis and a dilution of the existing pool (Fig. 4A). Notably a significant signal for assembled complex I became apparent after 24 h of chase, and it also was diluted and possibly degraded during subsequent cell divisions (Fig. 4B). The assembly of complex I during the first 24 h of chase may also be aided by the release from the partial inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis due to the inducer. These results also support the previous conclusions from Fig. 3A. The level of complex I reached under these conditions (24-h pulse/24-h chase) is comparable or even elevated compared with continuous induction. The presence of sufficient functional complex I can also be tested by switching the cells from DME-Glu to DME-Gal at various times after the induction by doxycycline. It was observed that cells survive well only if the switch was made at 48 h of induction or later. Turnover of Complex I after Removal of Doxycycline—To determine whether MWFE plays a role in complex I maintenance, we carried out “turn-OFF” experiments by removing the doxycycline from the medium after induction of complex I to near steady-state levels. Cells were induced for 96 h and then transferred to medium free of inducer after washing twice with medium without doxycycline. The decays of the transgenic NDUFA1 mRNA, MWFE·HA protein, and complex I were measured at various ti"

A key mechanism of calcium signaling has been shown to be mediated by calcineurin and NFAT. We report herein that the transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor (MEF)-2 is another calcium signal transducer involved in the regulation of the interleukin (IL)-2 promoter. A MEF2-binding site was identified in proximity to the TATA box of the IL-2 promoter. This site was shown to be bound by MEF2 in both resting and activated T cells. Overexpression of MEF2 enhanced, while overexpression of a dominant negative form of MEF2 or the MEF2-specific transcriptional corepressors Cabin1 and histone deacetylase 4 inhibited, the T cell receptor-dependent activation of an IL-2 reporter gene. Down-regulation of MEF2 by RNA interference in primary human T cells led to the inhibition of endogenous IL-2 transcription. These results suggest that MEF2 is required for the transcriptional activation of IL-2 and likely other cytokine genes in response to calcium signaling and may serve as a novel target for development of immunosuppressants.

The intracellular signal transduction pathway linking TCR and the IL-2 promoter has been used as a paradigm to elucidate mechanisms of signaling from cell surface to the nucleus. The second messenger calcium has been shown to be an essential mediator of the TCR signaling pathway. Through the use of the immunosuppressive natural products CsA and FK506, both of which inhibit a calcium-dependent signaling step leading to IL-2 transcription, a key downstream transducer of calcium signaling was identified as the calcium, and calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin (2Liu J.

Unlike NFAT, MEF2 is constitutively bound to its cognate DNA-binding elements in the nucleus independent of the intracellular calcium concentration. In unactivated thymocytes, MEF2 recruits a family of functionally redundant transcriptional repressors including Cabin1 (also known as cain) (17Sun L. Youn H.-D. Loh C. Stolow M. He W. Liu J.O.

These MEF2-specific corepressors recruit histone deacetylases to MEF2-associated promoter region, which remodel the chromatin structure, silencing the promoter activity. Upon calcium influx, these MEF2 repressors are removed from MEF2 by activated calmodulin, enabling it to bind to such coactivators as p300, turning on transcription of the target genes (14Youn H.D. Sun L. Prywes R. Liu J.O. Science. 1999; 286: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 21Youn H.D. Grozinger C.M. Liu J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22563-22567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The binding of some MEF2 transcriptional repressors has also been shown to be subject to regulation by calmodulin-dependent kinases, providing another mechanism of activation of MEF2 by calcium (22McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Lu J. Olson E.N. Nature. 2000; 408: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 23Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Nicol R.L. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4070-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar).In an attempt to ascertain the role of Cabin1 in thymocyte apoptosis in vivo, we generated a partial Cabin1 knock-out mouse (Cabin1ΔC) in which the C-terminal calcineurin- and MEF2-binding domains are deleted (24Esau C. Boes M. Youn H.D. Tatterson L. Liu J.O. Chen J. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1449-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The Cabin1ΔC mice are normal in thymocyte development despite the deletion of the MEF2-binding domain of Cabin1, likely reflecting the functional redundancy of Cabin1 and other MEF2 corepressors in thymocytes. However, the Cabin1ΔC mice exhibited up-regulation of a number of cytokines including IL-2, IL-4, and interferon-λ upon stimulation with TCR agonists. Examination of NFAT ruled out the possibility that this up-regulation of cytokines was due to the enhanced calcineurin-NFAT pathway, suggesting that other factors such as MEF2 might play a role in regulating the expression of IL-2 and other cytokine genes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture, Transfection, and Reporter Gene Assay—Jurkat T cells were cultured and transfected as described previously (17Sun L.

The forward primer sequence was 5′-TTTCATACAGAAGGCGTTAATTGC-3′, and the reverse primer sequence was 5′-ATGCAATTTATACTGTTAATTCTGG-3′.Construction of siRNA Expression Vector—The procedure for plasmid construction is similar to that described previously with slight modifications (25Sui G. Soohoo C. Affar el B. Gay F. Shi Y. Forrester W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5515-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). To generate pBS/U6-siMEF2D, two oligonucleotides were synthesized: oligo1 (sense): 5′-GGCTTCAATGGCTGCGACAGttcaagagaCTGTCGCAGCCATTGAAGCCCTTTTTG-3′ (the first 20-nucleotide of Oligo 1 corresponds to 273–288 of human MEF2D cDNA sequence, followed by 9 nucleotides linker (small letter) and the inverted sequence containing five Ts) and oligo2 (antisense): 5′-AATTCAAAAAGGGCTTCAATGGCTGCGACAGtctcttgaaCTGTCGCAGCCATTGAAGCC-3′.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONA MEF2-binding Site Exists in Close Proximity to the TATA Box of the IL-2 Promoter—We searched the IL-2 promoter region for a potential MEF2-binding site, and a contiguous AT-rich sequence composed of 11 A or T nucleotides was found between –46 and –55 in the proximal IL-2 promoter (Fig. 1A). Although this AT-rich sequence deviates from the consensus MEF2-binding sequence [CAT(A/T)4TAG] (30Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9366-9373Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), the core AT nucleotides are conserved. The putative MEF2-binding site in the human IL-2 promoter differs from that in the murine IL-2 promoter in a single nucleotide change from an “A” in the human sequence to a “T” in the mouse sequence, but this does not disrupt the contiguous “A/T” feature required for MEF2 binding.To test whether the putative MEF2-binding site in the IL-2 promoter is capable of binding to MEF2, we prepared a 32P-labeled double-stranded DNA probe spanning the site and performed EMSA. Using nuclear extracts of Jurkat T cells, we observed a protein-DNA complex (Fig. 1B, lane 2), which was sensitive to competition by an excess amount of cold probe (Fig. 1B, lane 3). When anti-MEF2 antibodies were included in the binding reaction mixture, the protein-DNA complex was super-shifted, indicating that MEF2 was bound by the DNA probe. These results demonstrate that the putative MEF2-binding site in the IL-2 promoter can bind MEF2 in vitro.MEF2 Is Bound to the IL-2 Promoter in Vivo—We next employed the CHIP assay to determine whether MEF2 is bound to the IL-2 promoter in vivo and if so whether the binding is mediated by the putative MEF2-binding site. We assessed the binding of MEF2 to the endogenous IL-2 promoter using the CHIP assay (31Braunstein M. Rose A.B. Holmes S.G. Allis C.D. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 592-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Indeed, MEF2D, the most abundant isoform of MEF2 in T cells, is bound to the promoter of IL-2 (Fig. 2A). Similar to its association with the Nur77 promoter in T cell hybridoma, the binding of MEF2D to the endogenous IL-2 promoter is independent of the activation state of T cells (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3). As a negative control, we also attempted to determine whether anti-MEF2 antibodies also pulled down the promoter of the housekeeping gene GAPDH using a pair of specific primers (32Iezzi S. Cossu G. Nervi C. Sartorelli V. Puri P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7757-7762Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Anti-MEF2D antibodies failed to pull down the GAPDH promoter (data not shown), suggesting that the binding of MEF2 to the IL-2 promoter was specific.Fig. 2MEF2 is bound to the IL-2 promoter via the putative MEF2-binding site in vivo and is capable of recruiting Cabin1 and HDAC4 to the IL-2 promoter. A, CHIP assay to determine the binding of MEF2 (lanes 2 and 3), Cabin1 (lanes 4 and 5), and HDAC4 (lanes 6 and 7) to the endogenous IL-2 promoter. Each set of CHIP samples were prepared from Jurkat T cells either stimulated with PMA and ionomycin (P/I) or without stimulation. B, CHIP assay using transiently transfected wild type IL-2 reporter plasmid (pIL2-Luc/WT) or a mutant in which the putative MEF2-binding site has been mutated (pIL2-Luc/Mut).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It has been previously shown that the MEF2-specific transcriptional corepressors Cabin1 and HDAC4 are bound to MEF2 in a calcium-dependent fashion (14Youn H.D. Sun L. Prywes R. Liu J.O. Science. 1999; 286: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 21Youn H.D. Grozinger C.M. Liu J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22563-22567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These repressors are released from MEF2 upon calcium signaling. We therefore determined if Cabin1 and HDAC4 could also associate with the IL-2 promoter via MEF2. Both Cabin1 and HDAC4 were found to be associated with the IL-2 promoter in non-stimulated T cells (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 6). Upon stimulation with PMA and ionomycin with the continued presence of calcium in the lysis buffer, Cabin1 and HDAC4 dissociate from MEF2 and the IL-2 promoter (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 7). These results suggest that MEF2 is likely to play a negative regulatory role in the transcription of the IL-2 promoter through recruitment of different classes of corepressors including Cabin1 and HDAC4 in resting T cells.To assess whether the putative MEF2-binding site in the IL-2 promoter is responsible for the binding of MEF2, we employed the CHIP assay using transiently transfected plasmid encoding either wile type IL-2 promoter or a mutant in which the putative MEF2-binding site has been mutated. As shown in Fig. 2B, MEF2 was bound to the transiently transfected IL-2 promoter either in the absence or the presence of stimulation with PMA and ionomycin (lanes 2 and 3), consistent with the outcome of endogenous CHIP assay (Fig. 2A). Mutation of the putative MEF2-binding sequence in the IL-2 promoter (pIL2-Luc/Mut) completely abolished the binding of MEF2 to the transiently transfected IL-2 promoter (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 5). Note that fewer PCR cycles were used for the amplification of the IL-2 promoter DNA such that the endogenous DNA is hardly detectable under these conditions (Fig. 2B, lane 6). Together, these results indicate that MEF2 is bound to the IL-2 promoter through the putative MEF2-binding site.Overexpression of MEF2 Enhances the Activation of the IL-2 Promoter in a MEF2 Corepressor-sensitive Manner—The binding of MEF2 to the IL-2 promoter suggests that overexpression of MEF2 will alter the ratio of MEF2 to endogenous MEF2 corepressors, enhancing the transcriptional activity of MEF2 as previously observed (16Youn H.D. Chatila T.A. Liu J.O. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4323-4331Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Indeed, overexpression of MEF2 enhanced the IL-2 reporter gene activation in response to stimulation by PMA and ionomycin (Fig. 3). As MEF2 is known to be sensitive to expression of its corepressors Cabin1 or HDAC4, we also determined the effect of overexpressing Cabin1 and HDAC4 on the activation of the IL-2 reporter by PMA and ionomycin. Overexpression of HDAC4 or Cabin1 significantly blocked the activation of the IL-2 reporter gene in response to PMA and ionomycin (Fig. 3). In contrast, overexpression of HDAC1, which does not directly bind to MEF2 (even though it is part of the Cabin1-mSin3 repression complex), had a negligible effect on IL-2 promoter activation. In addition to the MEF2-binding domain, Cabin1 also contains a calcineurin-binding domain (CNBD), which may account for the inhibition of IL-2 reporter gene expression by blocking calcineurin activity. We thus employed a truncation mutant of Cabin1 lacking the calcineurin-binding domain (Cabin1ΔCNBD) (14Youn H.D. Sun L. Prywes R. Liu J.O. Science. 1999; 286: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). When Cabin1ΔCNBD was overexpressed in Jurkat T cells, it remained capable of blocking IL-2 reporter gene activation, albeit with lower potency than the full-length Cabin1. These results further support the proposition that MEF2 is intimately involved in the activation of the IL-2 promoter.Fig. 3MEF2 enhances, and dominant negative (dn) MEF2 or MEF2-specific repressors inhibit, IL-2 reporter gene expression. Jurkat T cells were transfected with IL-2 luciferase reporter plasmid along with plasmids expressing various proteins as indicated. Cells were treated with PMA plus ionomycin for 8 h before they were lysed for measurement of luciferase and β-galactosidase activities.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Removal of the MEF2-binding site in the IL-2 Promoter or Blocking MEF2 Activity Inhibits Activation of the IL-2 Reporter Gene—To assess the role of MEF2 in IL-2 transcription in response to calcium signaling, we mutated the putative MEF2-binding site in the IL-2 luciferase reporter gene. This mutation was shown to be defective in MEF2 binding in vivo by the CHIP assay (Fig. 2B). The activation of the mutant reporter gene (pIL2-Luc/Mut) suffered from a significant decrease in response to stimulation by PMA and ionomycin (see Supplemental Fig. 1). Unlike the wild type reporter, the MEF2 mutant reporter gene could not be further activated by overexpression of MEF2, nor could it be further inhibited by HDAC4, which requires MEF2 to associate with the IL-2 promoter. Thus, the MEF2-binding site in the IL-2 promoter plays a critical role in its activation.As a preliminary assessment of the importance of MEF2 in IL-2 activation, we expressed a dominant negative form of MEF2D (dnMEF2) missing the C-terminal transactivation domain (33Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2627-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 34Ornatsky O.I. Andreucci J.J. McDermott J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33271-33278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and determined its effect on the IL-2 reporter gene activation stimulated by PMA and ionomycin. Overexpression of the dnMEF2 mutant significantly inhibited the activation of the IL-2 reporter gene (Fig. 3), suggesting that MEF2 is required for IL-2 promoter activation.Down-regulation of MEF2 by RNA Interference Blocks Transcription of Endogenous IL-2 Gene in Response to Stimulation by TCR Agonists—To further assess the role of MEF2 in TCR-mediated IL-2 transcriptional activation in vivo, we applied RNA interference to down-regulate the expression of MEF2 in primary human T cells and determined the effect on endogenous IL-2 mRNA synthesis and protein secretion. There are four isoforms of MEF2, MEF2A to MEF2D. The most abundant isoform of MEF2 expressed in T cells is MEF2D. After screening several regions of MEF2D cDNA for an effective siRNA, we identified an siRNA construct which reduced MEF2D expression in transfected Jurkat T cells by ∼10-fold (data not shown). To deliver the siRNA efficiently to primary human T cells, we used lentiviral vectors capable of transducing both activated and unstimulated T cells (28Zhou X. Cui Y. Huang X. Yu Z. Thomas A.M. Ye Z. Pardoll D.M. Jaffee E.M. Cheng L. Hum. Gene Ther. 2003; 14: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 29Cavalieri S. Cazzaniga S. Geuna M. Magnani Z. Bordignon C. Naldini L. Bonini C. Blood. 2003; 102: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We generated a hairpin RNA expression construct, pFUP-siMEF2D, and the corresponding empty vector pFUP (with the U6 promoter), based on the lentiviral vector FUGW co-expressing GFP (26Lois C. Hong E.J. Pease S. Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Science. 2002; 295: 868-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar), and produced recombinant lentiviruses encoding the MEF2D siRNA.Purified CD4+ T cells from human peripheral blood were cultured with IL-7 and transduced by either vector. The gene transduction efficiency by both vectors was estimated to be around 80%, based on GFP expression in flow cytometric analysis (not shown). As determined by Western blot analysis, the MEF2 siRNA construct significantly decreased the expression of MEF2D (Fig. 4A, upper panel). The effect of the siRNA construct appeared to be specific for MEF2D, as it had no effect on the protein level of endogenous tubulin (Fig. 4A, lower panel). When the virally transduced human primary T cells (including untransduced T cells) were stimulated with a mixture of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies, IL-2 transcription was seen in cells transduced with the empty vector pFUP (Fig. 4B). A significant decrease in IL-2 mRNA synthesis was observed in the T cell population transduced with the MEF2D siRNA viruses. In agreement with the decrease in RNA level, the level of IL-2 protein secreted into the medium was also dramatically reduced in human T cells transduced with MEF2D siRNA viruses (Fig. 4C). In contrast, the expression of CD69, a marker associated with T cell activation, is not affected (data not shown), indicating that the down-regulation of IL-2 transcription is not due to an indirect effect of MEF2D siRNA on overall T cell activation. The reduction of MEF2D and IL-2 expression in transduced human T cells was likely underestimated by these analyses, as 20% of the human T cells were untransduced and expressed normal levels of MEF2 and IL-2. These observations strongly suggest that MEF2 is necessary for the transcriptional activation of IL-2 during peripheral T cell activation.Fig. 4RNA interference of MEF2 expression leads to inhibition of IL-2 promoter activation. A, specific inhibition of MEF2 expression by MEF2D siRNA. Lysates prepared from primary human T cells transduced with viruses harboring either empty pFUP vector or pFUP-siMEF2D were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-MEF2D (top panel) or anti-tubulin (bottom panel) antibodies. B, RNA interference with MEF2 expression inhibited IL-2 mRNA synthesis in response to stimulation by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. The two populations of primary human T cells were stimulated with a combination of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. Total RNA was prepared from each sample and subjected to RT-PCR analysis. C, RNA interference with MEF2 expression inhibited IL-2 secretion in response to stimulation by anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 antibodies. IL-2 protein secreted into the culture medium was determined by ELISA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As a unique calcium regulated transcription factor, MEF2 has been shown to play a key role in transmitting calcium signals from cytosol into the nucleus to regulate expression of genes involved in thymocyte apoptosis and muscle cell differentiation. We have shown that the same calcium signaling module is involved in regulating transcription of IL-2 gene during T cell activation. Thus, two distinct calcium signaling modules, one centered around MEF2 and the other consisting of calcineurin and NFAT, are simultaneously involved in conferring calcium responsiveness to the IL-2 promoter (Supplemental Fig. 2). Our identification and confirmation of the MEF2-binding site in the IL-2 promoter suggests that more MEF2-binding sites are likely to be found in the promoters of other genes previous unknown to be regulated by MEF2. That knockdown of MEF2D expression in primary human T cells caused a significant decrease in the synthesis of IL-2 mRNA, and secretion of IL-2 in primary human T cells in response to stimulation by TCR agonists indicate that MEF2 is indispensable for activation of the IL-2 promoter. These results also suggest that MEF2 may serve as a potential target for developing novel immunosuppressants that block IL-2 production and T cell activation.

Prominent among the cytokines secreted by activated T cells is IL-2, which plays an essential role in subsequent T cell proliferation and homeostasis (1Smith K.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1992; 4: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The intracellular signal transduction pathway linking TCR and the IL-2 promoter has been used as a paradigm to elucidate mechanisms of signaling from cell surface to the nucleus. The second messenger calcium has been shown to be an essential mediator of the TCR signaling pathway. Through the use of the immunosuppressive natural products CsA and FK506, both of which inhibit a calcium-dependent signaling step leading to IL-2 transcription, a key downstream transducer of calcium signaling was identified as the calcium, and calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin (2Liu J.

https://openalex.org/W2047476050,"A close inspection of the crystal structure of the yeast 20 S proteasome revealed that a prominent connection between the two β-rings is mediated by the subunit β7/Pre4. Its C-terminal extension intercalates between the β1/Pre3 and β2/Pup1 subunits on the opposite ring. We show that the interactions promoted by the β7/Pre4 tail are important to facilitate the formation of 20 S particles from two half-proteasome precursor complexes and/or to stabilize mature 20 S proteasomes. The deletion of 19 residues from the β7/Pre4 C terminus leads to an accumulation of half-proteasome precursor complexes containing the maturation factor Ump1. The C-terminal extension of β7/Pre4, which forms several hydrogen bonds with β1/Pre3, is in addition required for the post-acidic activity mediated by the latter subunit. Deletion of the C-terminal tail of β7/Pre4 results in an inhibition of β1/Pre3 propeptide processing and abrogation of post-acidic activity. Our data obtained with yeast strains that expressed the mature form of Pre3 lacking its propeptide suggest that interactions between the Pre4 C terminus and Pre3 stabilize a conformation of its active site, which is essential for post-acidic activity. Deletion of the C-terminal extension of β2/Pup1, which wraps around β3/Pup3 within the same β-ring, is lethal, indicating that this extension serves an essential function in proteasome assembly or stability.

Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis is the main pathway for ATP-dependent non-lysosomal degradation of intracellular proteins in eukaryotes (1Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Google Scholar, 2Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Google Scholar). Polyubiquitylated substrates are recognized and degraded to small peptides by a multisubunit protease termed 26 S proteasome. This large proteolytic complex is composed of a 20 S barrel-shaped complex (the 20 S proteasome) that encloses the proteolytic sites, to which at both ends 19 S regulatory complexes are attached. The latter harbor isopeptidase and ATPase activities as well as binding sites for polyubiquitin chains (3Baumeister W. Walz J. Zühl F. Seemüller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Google Scholar, 4DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22123-22126Google Scholar, 5Löwe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Google Scholar). 20 S proteasomes are present in all eukaryotes, as well as in some archaea and eubacteria. In 1995, the structure of the 20 S proteasome of the archaea Thermoplasma acidophilum solved by x-ray crystallography was reported. This proteasome is composed of two distinct types of subunits, α and β, that are organized in four heptameric stacked rings with the arrangement α7β7β7α7. The β-rings form a central cavity that contains 14 active sites located on the inner surface (5Löwe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Google Scholar). Two years later the crystal structure of the eukaryotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae 20 S proteasome was determined revealing a similar organization. However, the two identical halves contain seven different α-type subunits and seven distinct β-type subunits occupying unique locations within the structure. Only three of the seven different β-subunits are active (6Groll M. Ditzel L. Löwe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Google Scholar). Based on mutational and structural studies it was found that subunits β1/Pre3, β2/Pup1, and β5/Pre2 harbor the peptidase sites, which mediate activities classified as post-acidic, tryptic, and chymotryptic, respectively (6Groll M. Ditzel L. Löwe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Google Scholar, 7Chen P. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1996; 86: 961-972Google Scholar, 8Arendt C.S. Hochstrasser M.

In mammalian proteasomes, the constitutive active subunits β1, β2, and β5, upon immune stress, can be replaced by the interferon-γ-induced subunits β1i, β2i, and β5i, respectively, resulting in the formation of so-called “immunoproteasomes” (10Kloetzel P.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 179-187Google Scholar). More recently, the crystal structure of a constitutive mammalian 20 S proteasome was determined showing that the overall structure of eukaryotic proteasomes is highly conserved (11Unno M. Mizushima T. Morimoto Y. Tomisugi Y. Tanaka K. Yasuoka N. Tsukihara T. Structure. 2002; 10: 609-618Google Scholar). In all proteasomes studied, α-type and β-type subunits share a common “β-sandwich” fold, in which two antiparallel β-sheets are sandwiched in between two layers of α-helices (3Baumeister W. Walz J. Zühl F. Seemüller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Google Scholar). Major structural differences exhibited by the individual subunits, such as insertions or C- and N-terminal extensions, are important features that determine the specific subunit interactions within the α- or β-rings (cis contacts) and between the rings (α-trans-β and β-trans-β contacts). These interactions target each of the 14 subunits to unique locations within the structure of the eukaryotic 20 S proteasome (6Groll M. Ditzel L. Löwe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Google Scholar, 11Unno M. Mizushima T. Morimoto Y. Tomisugi Y. Tanaka K. Yasuoka N. Tsukihara T. Structure. 2002; 10: 609-618Google Scholar). In Thermoplasma, the β-subunits are synthesized as precursors that require posttranslational processing for activation. Similarly, all active eukaryotic β-type subunits are synthesized as inactive precursors with N-terminal propeptides. These propeptides are cleaved off by intrasubunit autolysis yielding the mature forms with N-terminal threonine residues that act as nucleophiles attacking peptide bonds of substrates (7Chen P. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1996; 86: 961-972Google Scholar, 12Ditzel L. Huber R. Mann K. Heinemeyer W. Wolf D.H. Groll M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 1187-1191Google Scholar, 13Schmidtke G. Kraft R.

Nature. 1996; 382: 468-471Google Scholar). This property places proteasomes into the family of “Ntn hydrolases” that is characterized by an N-terminal nucleophile (15Seemüller E. Lupas A. Stock D. Löwe J. Huber R. Baumeister W. Science. 1995; 268: 579-582Google Scholar, 16Brannigan J.A. Dodson G. Duggleby H.J. Moody P.C. Smith J.L. Tomchick D.R. Murzin A.G. Nature. 1995; 378: 416-419Google Scholar). Another structural aspect of several β-subunits is their C-terminal extensions that are involved in interactions within or across the rings. Subunit β2 has the longest C-terminal extension (37 residues) with which it embraces β3 within the same ring. The C-terminal extension of β7 resembles a clamp that projects from one half of the proteasome to reach out to the opposing half entering into its β-ring between β1 and β2. In the present study, we have investigated the role of the C-terminal extensions of β2 and β7. We present evidence showing that, in yeast, the β7/Pre4 C-terminal domain has a role in mediating efficient generation of 20 S proteasome from its precursors. In addition, we show that specific interactions between this domain and β1/Pre3 are essential for post-acidic peptidase activity. The C-terminal extension of β2/Pup1 is essential for yeast cell viability indicating that functional proteasomes cannot form in its absence. Yeast Media—Yeast-rich (YPD) and synthetic (SD) minimal media with 2% dextrose were prepared as described previously (17Dohmen R.J. Stappen R. McGrath J.P. Forrova H. Kolarov J. Goffeau A.

Construction of chromosomal open reading frames that expressed C-terminally truncated versions of β7/Pre4 was performed as follows. Different 3′-portions of PRE4 were generated by PCR using primers containing flanking EcoRI and XbaI sites. The 3′-primers were designed such that the codons for Ile225, Gly219, or Glu207 (residue numbers refer to the processed subunits according to Ref. 6Groll M. Ditzel L. Löwe J. Stock D. Bochtler M.

Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Google Scholar) were replaced by the stop codon TAA to produce β7/Pre4 mutant proteins lacking one (pre4-ΔC1), seven (pre4-ΔC7), or 19 (pre4-ΔC19) amino acid residues at the C terminus, respectively. The PCR fragments were cloned into the integrative plasmid YIplac204 (TRP1-marked) (18Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Google Scholar). All plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. The resulting plasmids were linearized with BglII within the coding sequence for targeted integration into the S. cerevisiae genome. The generation of a chromosomal allele expressing a truncated version of β2/Pup1 lacking 30 residues at the C terminus (pup1-ΔC30) followed a similar strategy except that EcoNI was used for linearization. To follow the truncated Pup1, another genomic allele was generated that expressed a fusion with two ha epitopes (Pup1-ΔC30-ha) by an analogous strategy. The integrative plasmids that were used to generate in-frame fusions of full-length PUP1 and PRE3 with a sequence encoding two ha epitopes were described earlier (19Ramos P.C. Höckendorff J. Johnson E.S. Varshavsky A. Dohmen R.J. Cell. 1998; 92: 489-499Google Scholar). The same strategy was used to produce a genomically tagged strain expressing α7/Pre10-ha.Table IYeast strainsStrainRelevant genotypeSource/commentJD47-13CMATa his3-Δ200 leu2-3, 112 lys2-801 trp1-Δ63 ura3-52Ref. 17Dohmen R.J.

(details available upon request). The Ub-Pre3 protein synthesized by the resulting strain is processed co-translationally or nearly so by Ub-processing proteases (20Arendt C.S. Hochstrasser M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3575-3585Google Scholar). To exclude posttranslational acetylation of the N-terminal Thr residue of Pre3 generated from a Ub-Pre3 fusion, yeast strains with chromosomal deletions of NAT1 (nat1-Δ::KanMX4) were generated (21Wach A. Brachat A. Pöhlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Google Scholar). NAT1 encodes a subunit of N-terminal acetylase responsible for this modification (20Arendt C.S. Hochstrasser M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3575-3585Google Scholar). Fractionation of Whole-cell Extracts by Gel Filtration, Electrophoresis, and Immunoblotting—S. cerevisiae cells were grown at 30 °C in SD medium to A600 of 1.2 ± 0.2 and treated as described by Ramos et al. (19Ramos P.C. Höckendorff J. Johnson E.S. Varshavsky A. Dohmen R.J. Cell. 1998; 92: 489-499Google Scholar). Protein extraction and fractionation on a Superose 6 column coupled to an ÄKTA FPLC (Amersham Biosciences) as well as SDS-PAGE and immunoblots were performed as described previously (19Ramos P.C. Höckendorff J. Johnson E.S. Varshavsky A. Dohmen R.J. Cell. 1998; 92: 489-499Google Scholar). Native PAGE was carried out according to published protocols (22Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Fried V.A. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3149-3162Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit antibodies raised against β7/Pre4 were a kind gift from the laboratory of Dieter Wolf. Polyclonal anti-α7/Pre10 antibodies were raised against Pre10-His6 expressed in Escherichia coli. Proteasomal Peptidase Activity Assays—Determination of proteasomal activities in crude extracts was performed as follows. Yeast cells from exponentially growing cultures (A600 = 0.8-1.2) were harvested at 3000 × g, washed with cold water, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. The cells were lysed with acid-washed glass beads (Ø 0.4-0.5 mm, Sigma) in extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 15% glycerol) by vortexing. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,800 × g at 4 °C. The protein content in the supernatant was determined using the Bio-Rad Bradford protein assay. For assaying chymotrypsin-like activity, reactions were set up with 5 μg of extract protein and 5 μg of succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Bachem) as substrate. The trypsin-like activity and the post-acidic activity were measured using 20 μg of protein and 5 μg of t-butoxycarbonyl-Leu-Arg-Arg 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Affinity) and Ac-Gly-Pro-Leu-Asp 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Bachem) as substrates, respectively. The assay conditions were described previously (19Ramos P.C. Höckendorff J. Johnson E.S. Varshavsky A. Dohmen R.J. Cell. 1998; 92: 489-499Google Scholar). Structure of the β7/Pre4 C-terminal Tail and Its Interactions with β1/Pre3—The overall architecture of the 20 S proteasome and the general structures of the α- and β-subunits are conserved between T. acidophilum (5Löwe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Google Scholar), S. cerevisiae (6Groll M. Ditzel L. Löwe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Google Scholar), and mammals (11Unno M. Mizushima T. Morimoto Y. Tomisugi Y. Tanaka K. Yasuoka N. Tsukihara T. Structure. 2002; 10: 609-618Google Scholar). One striking structural difference between the bacterial and the eukaryotic proteasome is confined to the β7 subunit. Inspection of the crystal structure of the yeast proteasome reveals a long C-terminal domain of β7/Pre4. This tail is composed of 19 amino acid residues and extends from one half of the proteasome to the other where it ends between the subunits β1/Pre3 and β2/Pup1, the former of which carries the active site for post-acidic peptidase activity (Fig. 1A). Both the carboxyl group of the last residue Ile225 and the side chain of Gln223 of β7/Pre4 form hydrogen bonds with the side chain of Arg185 of β1/Pre3 (residue numbers refer to the processed subunits according to Ref. 6Groll M. Ditzel L. Löwe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Google Scholar). Arg185 within Pre3 together with Gly219 of β7/Pre4 form hydrogen bonds stabilizing Asp32 of Pre3, which itself forms a hydrogen bond with Leu34. The latter two residues are direct neighbors of Lys33, which is part of the post-acidic catalytic site, suggesting that this network of hydrogen bonds may be important for post-acidic activity (Fig. 1B). A comparison of the C-terminal sequence of β7 subunits from various species (Fig. 1C) revealed that its extension is only moderately conserved among eukaryotes. The C-terminal Extension of β7/Pre4 Facilitates the Formation of 20 S Particles from Two Precursor Complexes—During our studies on the ump4-1/pre4-3 mutant, in which a residue of the β7/Pre4 subunit was exchanged that is close to the site where its C-terminal extension emanates from one β-ring to reach out to the other, we found that proteasome precursor complexes accumulate. 2M. K. London, B. I. Keck, P. C. Ramos, and R. J. Dohmen, manuscript in preparation. Prompted by this finding we asked whether a defined deletion of the C-terminal tail of β7/Pre4 would be inhibitory to the formation of 20 S proteasomes from two 15 S half-proteasome precursor complexes. These precursor complexes are characterized by the presence of the propeptide-bearing precursor forms of the active β-type subunits, β1/Pre3, β2/Pup1, and β5/Pre2, and the proteasome maturation factor Ump1 (19Ramos P.C. Höckendorff J. Johnson E.S. Varshavsky A. Dohmen R.J. Cell. 1998; 92: 489-499Google Scholar). We generated a strain in which the C-terminal 19 amino acid residues of β7/Pre4 were deleted (pre4-ΔC19). In the same strain, a double ha epitope tag was linked to the C terminus of β2/Pup1. To examine whether the C-terminal truncation of Pre4 caused changes in the intracellular ratios of proteasomal precursor complexes and mature proteasomes, we analyzed cell extracts of the pre4-ΔC19 mutant by gel filtration on a Superose 6 column. As for the wild type, the half-proteasome precursor complex of the pre4-ΔC19 eluted with a peak in fractions 22 and 23 (Fig. 2). The ratio of this precursor complex to mature proteasomes, however, is significantly higher in the mutant (Fig. 2, middle panel) resulting also in a spreading of the immunoblot signal from fractions 21 to 25. As described previously (19Ramos P.C. Höckendorff J. Johnson E.S. Varshavsky A. Dohmen R.J. Cell. 1998; 92: 489-499Google Scholar), the mature form of β2/Pup1 is present in earlier fractions containing proteasomal peptidase activity due to the presence of assembled and active 20 S and 26 S proteasomes. Noteworthy is also the observation that the mature form of β2/Pup1 is in addition detected as a free subunit in fractions 29 and 30 of pre4-ΔC19 mutant extracts (Fig. 2). In contrast, no free mature β2/Pup1 was detected in these fractions of wild-type extracts. These findings suggest that the free processed subunits observed in the pre4-ΔC19 are derived from matured 20 S proteasomes that fell apart, either in vivo or in vitro. Similar experiments were performed with wild-type and pre4-ΔC19 strains expressing β1/Pre3 tagged at the C terminus with two ha epitopes. Proteins extracted from these strains were fractionated by gel filtration on Superose 6. Again, we observed a strikingly increased amount of β1/Pre3 precursor form in fractions 22 and 23 in the pre4-ΔC19 mutant in comparison with the wild type (Fig. 3). In contrast to the β2/Pup1 precursor, however, the β1/Pre3 precursor form is in addition present in a wide range of fractions ranging from those containing the free subunit to those with 20 S and 26 S proteasomes. Particularly interesting was the simultaneous presence of β1/Pre3 mature and precursor forms in the fractions containing 20 S and 26 S proteasome suggesting a defect in β1/Pre3 maturation. The β7/Pre4 C-terminal Tail Is Essential for β1/Pre3-mediated Post-acidic Peptidase Activity—Previous work by others (23Hilt W. Enenkel C. Gruhler A. Singer T. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3479-3486Google Scholar) had shown that a mutation in the PRE4 gene that led to a C-terminal shortening of β7/Pre4 by 15 residues resulted in a loss of the post-acidic peptidase activity, which is mediated by the β1/Pre3 subunit. Consistent with that report, we observed a significant accumulation of β1/Pre3 precursor forms in assembled proteasomes in our mutant pre4-ΔC19 (Fig. 3) together with a complete loss of post-acidic activity (Fig. 4A). We therefore asked whether the defect in post-acidic activity in this mutant was due to a defect in β1/Pre3 processing. To answer this question, we generated a congenic set of strains carrying on one side either the pre4-ΔC19 allele or its wild-type counterpart, and on the other side a gene expressing a mature form of β1/Pre3 (Pre3-Δpro) or wild-type Pre3. The β1/Pre3 propeptide is dispensable for proteasome assembly in vivo (20Arendt C.S. Hochstrasser M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3575-3585Google Scholar, 24Jäger S. Groll M. Huber R. Wolf D.H. Heinemeyer W. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 997-1013Google Scholar), but its deletion inactivates the post-acidic activity since its unprotected N terminus is subject to Nα-acetylation (20Arendt C.S. Hochstrasser M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3575-3585Google Scholar). Inactivation of the NAT1 gene encoding a subunit of Nat1-Ard1 Nα-acetyltransferase, however, restores near wild-type levels of post-acidic activity to the pre3-Δpro strain (20Arendt C.S. Hochstrasser M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3575-3585Google Scholar). Therefore all strains used in the experiment shown in Fig. 4 in addition lacked the NAT1 gene. As shown in Fig. 4D, none of the mutations affected the stability of β7/Pre4 as its ratio to subunit α7/Pre10 was not affected. Indistinguishably from the pre4-ΔC19 single mutant, the pre4-ΔC19 pre3-Δpro double mutant did not display any post-acidic peptidase activity (Fig. 4A). In extracts of the pre3-Δpro single mutant, in contrast, wild-type activity levels were detected (Fig. 4A). We conclude that the C-terminal extension of β7/Pre4 is essential for post-acidic activity of the proteasome independent of an apparent role in mediating efficient autocatalytic processing of Pro-β1/Pro-Pre3. In contrast to its effect on post-acidic activity, the pre4-ΔC19 mutation resulted only in a slight reduction of proteasomal chymotryptic and tryptic activity (Fig. 4, B and C). These data suggest that the C-terminal extension of β7/Pre4, aside of its role in the dimerization of half-proteasome precursors, has a specific role in the formation of the post-acidic peptidase site. Consistent with previous studies (8Arendt C.S. Hochstrasser M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7156-7161Google Scholar, 9Heinemeyer W. Fischer M. Krimmer T. Stachon U. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25200-25209Google Scholar, 24Jäger S. Groll M. Huber R. Wolf D.H. Heinemeyer W. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 997-1013Google Scholar), the post-acidic activity does not appear to be required for the activation of the chymotryptic and tryptic peptidase sites. Dissection of the Role of the β7/Pre4 C-terminal Extension in Post-acidic Activity—To further understand the involvement of the C-terminal extension of β7/Pre4 in the activity of the post-acidic peptidase site, we prepared a set of mutants expressing β7/Pre4 variants with truncated C termini (Fig. 5). We asked in particular whether truncations that included the residues Ile225 and Gly219 affected post-acidic activity of the proteasome. These two residues are involved in a network of hydrogen bonds formed with residues flanking the Lys33 in the catalytic center of β1/Pre3 (see above; Fig. 1B). A deletion of only the last amino acid residue Ile225 (pre4-ΔC1) resulted in a drop of post-acidic activity in crude extracts by 20% in comparison with the wild type consistent with a significant role of this residue in the post-acidic activity (Fig. 5A). A further deletion into the C terminus that included residue Gly219 resulted in a loss of about 90% of the post-acidic activity. None of the deletions affected the stability of the β7/Pre4 subunit as its ratio to α7/Pre10 was unchanged (Fig. 5B). Taken together these data are consistent with a model (depicted in Fig. 1B) in which the C-terminal extension of β7/Pre4 engages in hydrogen bonds that are essential to stabilize an active conformation of the catalytic site in β1/Pre3. This function of the β7/Pre4 C-terminal extension can be separated from its role in half-proteasome precursor dimerization (see below). Activation of the Post-acidic Site and Its Role in Proteasome Assembly Are Not Correlating Functions of the β7/Pre4 Tail—Because the deletion of only seven residues of the β7/Pre4 tail resulted in a drop of the post-acidic activity to less than 10%, we asked whether the formation or stability of the assembled 20 S proteasome was also affected by this shorter tail truncation. To answer this question, we analyzed the distribution of an epitope-tagged version of β2/Pup1 (Pup1-ha) in crude extracts of pre4-ΔC7 mutant cells fractionated by gel filtration. In this mutant, the amount of precursor complexes containing unprocessed proPup1-ha was far less strikingly increased than in the pre4-ΔC19 mutant (Fig. 2). Only a slight increase of such precursor complexes was detected in pre4-ΔC7 in comparison to wild type. We conclude that a truncation of the β7/Pre4 C-terminal extension that nearly abolishes post-acidic activity only moderately affects proteasome assembly supporting a model assigning two distinct functions to this domain. Truncation of β7/Pre4 C Terminus and Deletion of UMP1 Result in a Synthetic Growth Defect—Despite the observed defects in proteasome assembly (see above), the pre4-ΔC19 mutant cells showed no significant growth defects at 30 or 37 °C when compared with congenic wild-type cells (Fig. 1D and data not shown). This observation is in accordance with the finding that the overall amount of active proteasomes in the cell, as judged by the chymotryptic and tryptic activities in this mutant, was very similar to that of wild type (see above). These data suggested that the reduced efficiency of assembly of 20 S proteasomes from its precursors is compensated by a moderate increase in the expression of proteasome subunit genes. We have shown previously that maturation factor Ump1 is required for efficient assembly of 20 S proteasomes from two half-proteasome precursors (19Ramos P.C. Höckendorff J. Johnson E.S. Varshavsky A. Dohmen R.J. Cell. 1998; 92: 489-499Google Scholar), similar to what is described above for the C-terminal extension of β7/Pre4. To test whether the ump1-Δ mutation and the pre4-ΔC19 mutation have a synthetic effect, we crossed strains with these two mutations and analyzed the progeny by tetrad dissections. Consistent with the observation that both mutations affect the dimerization of half-proteasome precursor complexes, the double mutant showed a strong synthetic growth defect (Fig. 1D). To test whether the observed synthetic growth inhibition by the pre4-ΔC19 and ump1-Δ mutations is due to an imbalance of proteasome subunits, e.g. due to a more rapid turnover of the mutant Pre4-ΔC19 subunit, we compared the levels of subunits β7/Pre4 and α7/Pre10 by immunoblotting. The results shown in Fig. 1E demonstrate that the overall levels of these subunits are similar in the single mutants and in the double mutants supporting the notion that the synthetic phenotype is due to a strong inhibition of proteasome assembly. Similar to what we observed previously for the processing of the active subunits β1, β2, and β5 (19Ramos P.C. Höckendorff J. Johnson E.S. Varshavsky A. Dohmen R.J. Cell. 1998; 92: 489-499Google Scholar), the ump1-Δ mutation also inhibited the processing of β7/Pre4 (Fig. 1E, lanes c and d). The Deletion of the β2/Pup1 C-terminal Extension Is Lethal—Another prominent feature that distinguishes eukaryotic β-subunits from those in the Thermophilus “Urproteasome” is a ∼30-residue C-terminal extension of the β2 subunit (Fig. 6C). Analysis of the crystal structure of the yeast proteasome (Fig. 6A) revealed that the extension of β2/Pup1 wraps around the β3/Pup3 subunit within the same ring of β-subunits. To study the relevance of this extension to the biogenesis of functional proteasomes, we replaced one copy of the PUP1 gene in a diploid yeast strain with an otherwise identical copy in which the codon for Tyr232 (corresponds to Tyr203 in the processed subunit of the known crystal structure reported in Ref. 6Groll M. Ditzel L. Löwe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Google Scholar; underlined in Fig. 6C) was replaced by a TAA translation termination codon followed by the TCYC1 terminator. The resulting pup1-ΔC30 allele encodes a Pup1 protein that is truncated at the C terminus by 30 residues. To test for the effect of this truncation on the physiology of S. cerevisiae, we analyzed tetrads of ascospores derived from the resulting heterozygous strain JD329 (Table I). As shown in Fig. 6B, each tetrad yielded only two viable spore clones, all of which were tryptophan-auxotrophic, indicating that they lacked the TRP1-marked pup1-ΔC30 allele. Microscopic inspection of the inviable spore clones revealed that the spores had germinated and undergone a few cell divisions before they stopped dividing (data not shown). The tetrad analysis therefore demonstrated that the C-terminal extension of β2 is essential for viability of S. cerevisiae cells. We conclude that this extension is essential for the generation of functional proteasomes. To investigate whether the Pup1-ΔC30 subunit is capable of assembling into proteasomal complexes and to follow the fate of the resulting complexes, we generated a diploid strain that expressed an epitope-tagged version of the truncated Pup1 (Pup1-ΔC30-ha). Extracts from the resulting strain JD325 (see Table I) were analyzed by gel filtration and immunoblotting and compared with an otherwise identical wild-type strain expressing Pup1-ha. As shown in Fig. 6D, unprocessed Pup1-ΔC30-ha was detectable in increased amounts in fractions 22 and 23 that typically contain the Ump1-containing half-proteasome precursor complex (19Ramos P.C. Höckendorff J. Johnson E.S. Varshavsky A. Dohmen R.J. Cell. 1998; 92: 489-499Google Scholar) and moreover was also present in the fractions 19-21 comprising larger assemblies similar in size to the 20 S particles. When compared with a wild-type strain, however, only minute quantities of processed Pup1-ΔC30-ha were detectable in fractions 15-19 that typically contain 26 S proteasome (CP·R2) and the 20 S particle (CP) with one regulatory particle (CP·R)(Fig. 6D). Similarly, we observed a striking reduction of Pup1-ΔC30-ha-containing CP·R or CP·R2 complexes when we analyzed crude extracts from the mutant strain by native PAGE (Fig. 6E). Note that the experiments with the Pup1-ΔC30-ha variant were performed with a diploid strain carrying also a wild-type PUP1 gene copy. The small amounts of larger assemblies containing processed forms of Pup1-ΔC30-ha therefore may depend on the presence of a functional Pup1 subunit in the other half of the complex. We conclude that Pup1-ΔC30 assembles into proteasomal complexes but that formation of 26 S proteasomes containing this truncated subunit is impaired. Several proteasomal β-subunits of eukaryotic proteasomes are distinguished from their counterparts in bacteria by striking C-terminal extensions. In this report we show that the C-terminal extension of the yeast β7/Pre4 subunit serves two distinct functions in proteasome biogenesis and activity. First, it functions as a molecular clamp mediating and stabilizing the interaction of two half-proteasome precursor complexes. The second function that can be assigned to the seven C-terminal residues of Pre4 is to keep the post-acidic site in an active conformation. Another finding of this study is that the C-terminal extension of β2/Pup1 serves an essential function in proteasome biogenesis. The C-terminal Tail of β7/Pre4 Acts as a Molecular Clamp Stabilizing the 20 S Proteasome—The C-terminal tail of β7/Pre4, which extends from one half of the proteasome to the other (Fig. 1A), facilitates the formation of 20 S particles from two half-proteasome precursor complexes. In the pre4-ΔC19 mutant lacking this extension, we detected an accumulation of half-proteasome precursor complexes (Figs. 2 and 3). The overall proteasomal chymotryptic or tryptic activities detected in this mutant, however, were only slightly reduced (less than 5 and 9%, respectively) when compared with wild type (Fig. 4, B and C). Similar to effects observed previously in mutants with proteasome defects (19Ramos P.C. Höckendorff J. Johnson E.S. Varshavsky A. Dohmen R.J. Cell. 1998; 92: 489-499Google Scholar), the assembly defect in the pre4-ΔC19 mutant therefore seems to be partly compensated by a slightly increased expression of proteasome subunits (Fig. 4D). As a result, the pre4-ΔC19 mutant strain does not display any obvious growth defects or phenotypes. When we combined the pre4-ΔC19 with the ump1-Δ mutation, however, we observed a striking synthetic inhibition of growth (Fig. 1D). Similar to the data presented here for pre4-ΔC19, the ump1-Δ mutation was shown previously to impair the assembly of 20 S proteasomes from two half-proteasome precursor complexes (19Ramos P.C. Höckendorff J. Johnson E.S. Varshavsky A. Dohmen R.J. Cell. 1998; 92: 489-499Google Scholar). Why do eukaryotic proteasomes require a C-terminal extension of β7 to mediate efficient assembly of proteasomes while T. acidophilum β-subunits lack such a feature? In this archaea, the interaction between half-proteasome precursor complexes is apparently stabilized by other features. One such feature of T. acidophilum β-subunits at the interface of the two β-rings could be a small extension in form of the side chain of Arg165. This residue is located at the end of helix H4 that protrudes from the core of the β-subunit and is 38 residues distant from its C terminus (5Löwe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Google Scholar). These seven small protuberances from each β-ring extend to the respective other ring into grooves between the β-subunits (5Löwe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Google Scholar). Collectively, these zipper-like interactions may serve a similar holding function as the long C-terminal extension of β7 in eukaryotes. Despite a significant sequence divergence and a reduction in length by four amino acid residues in comparison to its S. cerevisiae counterpart (Fig. 1C), the C-terminal region of the bovine β7 subunit occupies a similar location between the β1 and β2 subunits in the crystal structure. The smaller number of hydrogen bonds that the bovine β7 engages in, however, may result in a more flexible contact allowing for an easier replacement of housekeeping subunits by interferon-induced immunosubunits β1i and β2i (11Unno M. Mizushima T. Morimoto Y. Tomisugi Y. Tanaka K. Yasuoka N. Tsukihara T. Structure. 2002; 10: 609-618Google Scholar). The shorter extension of bovine β7 appears to be compensated by an additional extension of the β1 subunit (11Unno M. Mizushima T. Morimoto Y. Tomisugi Y. Tanaka K. Yasuoka N. Tsukihara T. Structure. 2002; 10: 609-618Google Scholar). These two extensions of the neighboring subunits β1 and β7 seem to form a short “zipper.” The C-terminal Seven Residues of β7/Pre4 Are an Important Structural Component of the Post-acidic Peptidase Site—Previous work by others (23Hilt W. Enenkel C. Gruhler A. Singer T. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3479-3486Google Scholar) had already shown that a shortening of the β7/Pre4 C terminus (pre4-ΔC15) results in a loss of the post-acidic peptidase activity mediated by the β1/Pre3 subunit. Consistent with these findings, we observed almost a total loss of post-acidic peptidase activity in our pre4-ΔC19 mutant (Fig. 4A). Because we also observed a defect in the processing of proβ1/Pre3 (Fig. 3) in this strain, we asked whether the C-terminal extension of β7/Pre4 is important to trigger autocatalytic processing of the propeptide of β1/Pre3 or whether it is an essential structural component of the post-acidic peptidase active site per se. That the latter is true was concluded from the lack of post-acidic activity in a strain expressing a mature form of β1/Pre3 (Ub-Pre3-Δpro in Fig. 4) and β7/Pre4 lacking its C-terminal extension. We conclude that the β7/Pre4 C-terminal extension is an essential component of the post-acidic site by providing a network of hydrogen bonds that stabilizes an active conformation of β1/Pre3 as illustrated in Fig. 1B. Although one of the shorter truncations removing only seven residues (pre4-ΔC7) resulted in a severe reduction in post-acidic activity (by ∼90%; Fig. 5), it had relatively little effect on the dimerization of two half-proteasome precursor complexes (Fig. 2). We interpret this result as evidence that these two functions of the C-terminal extension of β7/Pre4 are distinct and separable. A comparison of the C-terminal extensions of the orthologous β7 subunits of S. cerevisiae and other species revealed that it is not highly conserved in sequence (Fig. 1C). This observation suggests that this domain in the S. cerevisiae β7/Pre4 is specifically adapted to its function in post-acidic activity in the context of the budding yeast 20 S proteasome. The C-terminal Extension of β2/Pup1 Is Essential for Proteasome Biogenesis—In comparison with β-subunits of the T. acidophilum proteasome, subunit β2 of eukaryotic proteasomes is characterized by a C-terminal extension of ∼30 amino acid residues (Fig. 6C). As shown in Fig. 6A, this extension wraps around the neighboring subunit β3/Pup3 in the same β-ring of the S. cerevisiae proteasome (6Groll M. Ditzel L. Löwe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Google Scholar). A similar structural arrangement was found for the subunits β2 and β3 in the bovine proteasome (11Unno M. Mizushima T. Morimoto Y. Tomisugi Y. Tanaka K. Yasuoka N. Tsukihara T. Structure. 2002; 10: 609-618Google Scholar). We show that a deletion of this extension is lethal to yeast cells (Fig. 6B). Our experiments with a diploid strain that expressed wild-type β2/Pup1 in addition to an epitope-tagged variant of the truncated Pup1 (pup1-ΔC30-ha) showed that the latter is incorporated into proteasomal complexes. Propeptide processing of the Pup1-ΔC30-ha variant and the formation of 26 S proteasomes containing this subunit, however, were very inefficient (Fig. 6). One possible explanation is that subunit β3/Pup3, which seems to be held in place by the β2/Pup1 C-terminal tail, cannot be incorporated properly in the absence of this tail leading to an inhibition of the assembly and maturation of 26 S proteasomes. We thank Sandra Ribeiro for help in the preparation of Fig. 1B and for discussions. We are grateful to Sibylle Jäger and Dieter Wolf for anti-Pre4 antibodies."

In fibroblasts and most T cell lines, however, Vif is not required for the production of infectious HIV-1. This cell type-dependent requirement for Vif implied the involvement of host factor(s). Indeed, the recent identification of CEM15 (APOBEC3G) as a cellular inhibitor of HIV replication (10Sheehy A.M. Gaddis N.C. Choi J.D. Malim M.H. Nature. 2002; 418: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar) confirmed earlier speculations on the existence of an inhibitory factor in non-permissive cell types (11Madani N. Kabat D. J.

APOBEC3G was subsequently found to induce hypermutation of the HIV genome by deaminating cytidine residues on the viral minus-strand cDNA resulting in the introduction of guanosine to adenosine mutations in the HIV genome (13Harris R.S. Bishop K.N. Sheehy A.M. Craig H.M. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Watt I.N. Neuberger M.S. Malim M.H. Cell. 2003; 113: 803-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar, 14Zhang H.

Subsequent reports suggested a role of Vif in the inhibition of APOBEC3G packaging into virus particles (17Mariani R. Chen D. Schrofelbauer B. Navarro F. Konig R. Bollman B. Munk C. Nymark-McMahon H.

Rose K.M. Kozak S.L. Kabat D. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1398-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). The mechanism of APOBEC3G exclusion from virions, however, remains under investigation. Some reports suggest that Vif induces degradation of APOBEC3G (20Sheehy A.M. Gaddis N.C. Malim M.H. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1404-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 21Marin M. Rose K.M.

Cell. 2003; 12: 591-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). While most current models propose an intracellular interaction of Vif with APOBEC3G, Vif is also packaged into virions. Virus particles produced from acutely infected cells incorporate 30–100 copies of Vif (22Kao S. Akari H. Khan M.A. Dettenhofer M. Yu X.F. Strebel K. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 1131-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In fact, packaging of Vif is specific and requires the interaction of Vif with the viral genomic RNA and the nucleocapsid (NC) domain of the Gag precursor (23Khan M.A. Aberham C. Kao S. Akari H. Gorelick R. Bour S. Strebel K. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7252-7265Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Moreover, virus-associated Vif is partially cleaved by the viral protease (PR) (24Khan M.A. Akari H. Kao S. Aberham C. Davis D. Buckler-White A. Strebel K. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9112-9123Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutations at the processing site that inhibited Vif processing inhibited Vif function, whereas mutations that did not interfere with Vif processing also did not affect Vif function (24Khan M.A. Akari H. Kao S. Aberham C. Davis D. Buckler-White A. Strebel K. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9112-9123Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). While these findings suggested an important role of virus-associated Vif in virions (24Khan M.A. Akari H. Kao S. Aberham C. Davis D. Buckler-White A. Strebel K. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9112-9123Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), its specific role remains under investigation. In the current study we report that newly synthesized Vif is rapidly degraded in transiently transfected HeLa cells with a half-life of less than 30 min. We found that the presence or absence of APOBEC3G had no significant effect on the degradation kinetics of Vif. Based on recent reports demonstrating an interaction of Vif with APOBEC3G (17Mariani R. Chen D. Schrofelbauer B. Navarro F. Konig R. Bollman B. Munk C. Nymark-McMahon H. Landau N.R. Cell. 2003; 114: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 21Marin M. Rose K.M. Kozak S.L. Kabat D. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1398-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 25Yu X. Yu Y. Liu B. Luo K. Kong W. Mao P. Yu X.F. Science. 2003; 302: 1056-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar), we postulated that Vif enhances viral infectivity in a dose-dependent and saturable manner. Accordingly, increasing levels of Vif were expected to result in an increase in viral infectivity reaching a plateau of maximal infectivity once saturating amounts of Vif were reached or exceeded. Furthermore, increasing the amounts of Vif in permissive cell types was not expected to affect viral infectivity, as virus production in such cell types is Vif-independent due to the lack of APOBEC3G in such cells. As expected, physiological expression of Vif increased viral infectivity in non-permissive cell types in a dose-dependent manner. Surprisingly, however, the amounts of Vif required for maximal effect exhibited a narrow window, and further increases in Vif levels did not result in a plateau of maximal viral infectivity but instead increasingly suppressed viral infectivity irrespective of the producer cell type. We investigated the mechanistic basis of this phenomenon and found that Vif suppresses processing of the Gag precursor at the p2/NC primary cleavage site. The resulting accumulation of 33- and 34-kDa Gag intermediates composed of CA-p2-NC and CA-p2-NC-p1 was found to inhibit viral infectivity. These results provide evidence that virus-associated Vif has the ability to interact with Gag precursor molecules and to modulate Gag maturation. However, Gag maturation is a highly ordered process, and accumulation of excessive amounts of processing intermediates due to high level expression of Vif is detrimental to virus infectivity. Plasmids—The full-length HIV-1 molecular clone pNL4-3 was used for the production of wild type infectious virus (26Adachi A. Gendelman H.E. Koenig S. Folks T. Willey R. Rabson A. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 284-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of its variants pNL43-K1 (Env-defective) or pNL4-3vif(-) (Vif-defective) was described previously (27Bour S. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8285-8300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Karczewski M.K. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 494-507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An Env- and Vif-defective variant, pNL43-K1.vif(-), was constructed by introducing a frameshift mutation in env at a KpnI site in pNL4-3vif(-). Plasmid pHCMV-G contains the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G (VSV-G) gene expressed from the immediate early gene promoter of human cytomegalovirus (29Yee J.K. Miyanohara A. LaPorte P. Bouic K. Burns J.C. Friedmann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9564-9568Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) and was used for the production of VSV-G pseudotypes. Construction of the APOBEC3G expression vector pHIV-Apo3G is described elsewhere (19Kao S. Khan M.A. Miyagi E. Plishka R. Buckler-White A. Strebel K. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 11398-11407Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Expression of APOBEC3G from pHIV-Apo3G is under the control of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat and thus requires Tat for expression. For expression of Vif in trans, the subgenomic expression vector pNL-A1 (30Strebel K. Daugherty D. Clouse K. Cohen D. Folks T. Martin M.A. Nature. 1987; 328: 728-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) was used. A Vif-defective variant of pNL-A1, pNL-A1vif(-), was used as a control. Vif deletion mutants VifΔD (deletion of residues 23–43), VifΔF (deletion of residues 23–74), and VifΔI (deletion of residues 4–45) were created by two-step PCR amplification. PCR products were column-purified; appropriate pairs were mixed at equimolar ratios and used as templates for a second round of amplification using flanking primers. Final PCR products were cloned into pNL-A1 between the BssHII and EcoRI sites. Cells—H9 and LuSIV cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and antibiotics. HeLa cells were maintained in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and antibiotics. Transfection and Analysis of Viral Proteins—H9 cells (4 × 106) were transfected by electroporation with 10 μg each of pNL43-K1 or pNL43-K1.vif(-) and 10 μg of pNL-A1 or pNL-A1vif(-). The culture supernatants were harvested 24 h after transfection, filtered through 0.45-μm filters, and concentrated by ultracentrifugation through 20% sucrose for 1 h at 25,000 rpm using an SW41 rotor (Beckman Instruments). Alternatively, HeLa cells (5 × 106) were transfected with 2 μg each of variants of pNL4-3 and pNL-A1 using LipofectAMINE PLUS™ (Invitrogen). Culture supernatants and cells were harvested 24 h later. Cell and viral lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting as described previously (23Khan M.A. Aberham C. Kao S. Akari H. Gorelick R. Bour S. Strebel K. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7252-7265Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) using an HIV-1-infected patient serum (APS) and antibodies against Vif (28Karczewski M.K. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 494-507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), NC (kindly provided by Robert Gorelick), reverse transcriptase (Intracell), p24 capsid, and matrix (MA) (provided by S. Zolla-Pazner and P. Spearman, respectively, and obtained through the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (31Gorny M.K. Gianakakos V. Sharpe S. Zolla-Pazner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1624-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 32Varthakavi V. Browning P.J. Spearman P. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 10329-10338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Pulse/Chase Analysis of Vif—Transfected cells were metabolically labeled for 10 min with [35S]methionine (2 mCi/ml; ICN Biomedical, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA). After the labeling, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline to remove free isotope and suspended in complete RPMI containing all amino acids and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were incubated for various times at 37 °C as indicated in the text. Cells were then pelleted and stored at -80 °C. Cell pellets were subsequently extracted with CHAPS buffer (50 mm Tris-hydrochloride, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5% (v/v) CHAPS (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid)) supplemented with 0.2% deoxycholate, incubated on ice for 5 min, vortexed, and pelleted for 3 min at 15,000 × g. Proteins present in the supernatant were used for immunoprecipitation with a Vif-specific polyclonal antibody (Vif93) (28Karczewski M.K. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 494-507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were solubilized by boiling in sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Radioactive bands were visualized by fluorography, and quantitation was performed using a Fuji BAS 2000 Bio-Image analyzer. Single-round Viral Infectivity Analysis—Virus stocks derived from transfected H9 or HeLa cells were used for the infection of LuSIV indicator cells (33Roos J.W. Maughan M.F. Liao Z. Hildreth J.E. Clements J.E. Virology. 2000; 273: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To increase the sensitivity of the assay, viruses were pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G. Unlike Nef defects, VSV-G pseudotyping does not rescue Vif defects (3Akari H. Uchiyama T. Fukumori T. Iida S. Koyama A.H. Adachi A. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 2945-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 34Aiken C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5871-5877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LuSIV cells (5 × 105) were infected in a 24-well plate with 200–400 μl of unconcentrated virus supernatants. Cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Cells were then harvested and lysed in 150 μl of Promega 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). To determine the luciferase activity in the lysates, 50 μl of each lysate were combined with luciferase substrate (Promega Corp.) by automatic injection, and light emission was measured for 10 s at room temperature in a luminometer (Optocomp II, MGM Instruments, Hamden, CT). Step Gradient Analysis—Concentrated virus preparations were treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 (final concentration) and subjected to fractionation by centrifugation through a 20%/60% sucrose step gradient as described previously (23Khan M.A. Aberham C. Kao S. Akari H. Gorelick R. Bour S. Strebel K. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7252-7265Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Three equal fractions were collected as depicted in Fig. 5; the top fraction (fraction 1) contains detergent-soluble viral proteins, fraction 2 is a buffer fraction and should not contain significant amounts of any viral proteins, and fraction 3 contains viral core components that are resistant to extraction with Triton X-100. Aliquots of each fraction were analyzed for viral proteins by immunoblotting. Newly Synthesized Vif Is Rapidly Degraded—Recent work proposed that Vif induces proteasome-dependent degradation of APOBEC3G (20Sheehy A.M. Gaddis N.C. Malim M.H. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1404-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 21Marin M. Rose K.M. Kozak S.L. Kabat D. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1398-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 25Yu X. Yu Y. Liu B. Luo K. Kong W. Mao P. Yu X.F. Science. 2003; 302: 1056-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). Although we and others were unable to verify such Vif-dependent degradation of APOBEC3G (17Mariani R. Chen D. Schrofelbauer B. Navarro F. Konig R. Bollman B. Munk C. Nymark-McMahon H. Landau N.R. Cell. 2003; 114: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 19Kao S. Khan M.A. Miyagi E. Plishka R. Buckler-White A. Strebel K. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 11398-11407Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), we nevertheless wanted to assess the possible impact of APOBEC3G on Vif stability. To address this question, we performed pulse/chase analyses in transiently transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 1). To ascertain coexpression of Vif and APOBEC3G in the same cells, Vif was expressed from the subgenomic expression vector pNL-A1 (30Strebel K. Daugherty D. Clouse K. Cohen D. Folks T. Martin M.A. Nature. 1987; 328: 728-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), and APOBEC3G was expressed from the Tat-dependent vector pHIV-Apo3G (19Kao S. Khan M.A. Miyagi E. Plishka R. Buckler-White A. Strebel K. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 11398-11407Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Transfected HeLa cells were labeled for 10 min with [35S]methionine and chased for up to 60 min as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As can be seen in Fig. 1A, Vif was rapidly degraded both in the absence and presence of APOBEC3G. Quantitation of the Vif-specific bands (Fig. 1B) revealed no difference in the relative decay rates of Vif. Thus, expression of APOBEC3G had no impact on the intracellular stability of Vif. The intracellular site of Vif degradation is under investigation; however, preliminary data suggest the involvement of the cellular proteasome machinery (35Mehle A. Strack B. Ancuta P. Zhang C. McPike M. Gabuzda D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7792-7798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). 2M. Fujita, manuscript in preparation. High Level Expression of Vif in Virus-producing Cells Is Detrimental to HIV-1 Infectivity—The rapid intracellular turnover presumably contributes to the low abundance of Vif in virus-infected cells and limits its packaging into virions. This suggests that Vif may function at very low levels. To determine how much Vif is required for maximal viral infectivity, we examined the dose-dependent effect of Vif on viral infectivity in non-permissive H9 cells. Virus stocks were produced in the presence of increasing amounts of Vif and tested for infectivity in a single-round infection assay. To avoid subsequent rounds of infection, an env-defective proviral construct, pNL43-K1.vif(-), was used and pseudotyped with VSV-G. As pNL43-K1.vif(-) is also defective in its vif gene, Vif was expressed in trans from pNL-A1 (30Strebel K. Daugherty D. Clouse K. Cohen D. Folks T. Martin M.A. Nature. 1987; 328: 728-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). This allowed for the controlled expression of increasing amounts of Vif depending on the amounts of pNL-A1 vector transfected. To avoid fluctuations in transfection efficiencies all DNA amounts were equalized by addition of appropriate amounts of a Vif-defective variant of pNL-A1, pNL-A1vif(-). Cells transfected with constant amounts (5 μg) of pNL43-K1.vif(-) as well as pHCMV-G (5 μg) and increasing amounts of pNL-A1 (0.01–10 μg) were harvested 24 h after electroporation. Cell lysates and virus-containing supernatants were used for biochemical characterization as well as for the infection of LuSIV indicator cells as illustrated in Fig. 2A. LuSIV cells were collected 24 h after infection, and luciferase activity in the cell lysates was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Luciferase activity was normalized for input virus and expressed as percentage of the activity observed for a Vif-expressing control virus, which was defined as 100% (Fig. 2B). At low expression levels, Vif enhanced virus infectivity in a dose-dependent manner reaching a peak of infectivity at 1 μg of cotransfected pNL-A1 plasmid DNA. Surprisingly, however, viral infectivity did not plateau with further increases in Vif, but instead higher levels of Vif resulted in a rapid drop in virus infectivity. In fact, at the highest concentration tested (10 μg of pNL-A1 plasmid), the infectivity of the resulting virus was comparable with that of Vif-defective virus. Western blot analysis confirmed that the levels of Vif expression were directly correlated with the amounts of pNL-A1 plasmid transfected (Fig. 2B, α-Vif) and that increasing Vif expression did not significantly affect Gag expression (Fig. 2B, APS). These results demonstrate that the level of Vif required for maximal infectivity has a very narrow optimum and that both lower and higher levels of Vif are detrimental to virus infectivity. Inhibition of Virus Infectivity at High Levels of Vif Is Cell Type-independent—The results from Fig. 2 are unexpected inasmuch as they are inconsistent with a model that simply envisions a role of Vif in the inactivation of cellular inhibitor(s) such as APOBEC3G. To directly examine the requirement of cellular inhibitory factors for the dose-dependent effect of Vif on viral infectivity, we compared the infectivity of virus stocks produced from non-permissive H9 cells and permissive HeLa cells in the presence of increasing amounts of Vif. In addition, to rule out the possibility that the inhibitory effect of Vif seen following overexpression in trans is due to the fact that the proviral vector employed in this study carried a defective vif gene, we analyzed a Vif-expressing variant (pNL43-K1) in direct comparison to the Vif-defective pNL43-K1.vif(-). H9 cells (Fig. 3, A and B) and HeLa cells (C and D) were transfected with increasing amounts (1–10 μg) of pNL-A1 together with fixed amounts (5 μg) of pNL43-K1 or pNL43-K1.vif(-) as indicated in Fig. 3. In addition, a fixed amount (5 μg) of pHCMV-G was included to produce VSV-G-pseudotyped virus stocks. As before, DNA quantities were adjusted to 20 μg in all samples using appropriate amounts of pNL-A1vif(-) plasmid DNA. Consistent with the results from Fig. 2, physiological levels of Vif supplied in trans or in cis produced fully infectious virus from both H9 and HeLa cells, and further increase in the amounts of Vif progressively reduced viral infectivity in H9-derived virus (Fig. 3, A and B). Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of Vif expressed in cis and in trans appeared to be additive because in the presence of endogenous Vif, smaller amounts of exogenous Vif were necessary for a comparable degree of inhibition (compare A and B of Fig. 3). These results indicate that the inhibitory effect of high levels of Vif on virus infectivity in Fig. 2 was not due to the lack of a functional vif gene. Surprisingly, very similar results were observed when virus was produced from permissive HeLa cells (Fig. 3, C and D); overexpression of Vif in trans reduced viral infectivity irrespective of the presence or absence of endogenous Vif. Again, endogenous Vif appeared to have an additive effect suggesting a similar molecular mechanism in both cell types. The fact that high level expression of Vif affected viral infectivity in the absence of cellular inhibitory factors suggests that this effect of Vif is unrelated to the noted inhibition of APOBEC3G and thus reflects a separate activity of Vif. Vif Modulates Gag Processing during Virus Maturation—To investigate the molecular basis of the Vif-induced inhibition of viral infectivity, we performed a biochemical characterization of virions produced in the presence of varying amounts of Vif. The goal was to identify possible effects of Vif on Gag precursor processing or other effects on the viral protein composition that might explain the altered infectivity. In H9 cells, comparable expression and processing of viral proteins including Pr55gag and CA were detected intracellularly using an HIV-positive patient serum (Fig. 4A, APS) irrespective of the level of Vif expression (Fig. 4A, α-Vif). Interestingly, analysis of virus-associated proteins revealed two protein bands of ∼33 and 34 kDa, respectively, that were apparent only in viruses produced in the presence of high levels of Vif (Fig. 4B, APS). Both proteins were also recognized by capsid- (Fig. 4B, α-CA) and nucleocapsid-specific (Fig. 4B, α-NC) antisera but not by a matrix-specific antibody (Fig. 4B, α-MA). The reactivity of p33/34 with CA- and NC-specific antibodies identified these proteins as Gag-processing intermediates composed of CA-p2-NC (p33) or CA-p2-NC-p1 (p34). The p33/34 intermediates were significantly less abundant than mature CA or NC suggesting that they represent a minor component of the virions. Importantly, processing of neither p66/p51 reverse transcriptase nor p17 MA was affected by the high levels of Vif (Fig. 4B), indicating that Vif does not act as a general PR inhibitor. In addition, similar Gag-processing intermediates were observed in virus derived from permissive HeLa cells in the presence of high levels of Vif (see Fig. 5). Together, the results from this experiment demonstrate that Vif modulates Gag processing to produce CA-p2-NC intermediates. Vif and Gag Intermediates Associate with the Nucleoprotein Complex—Our observation that Vif modulates the maturation of Gag precursor molecules without acting as a general PR inhibitor suggests that Vif might inhibit Gag processing through steric interference. It is likely that such interference is caused by a direct interaction of Vif with the Gag precursor at or near the p2/NC cleavage site. In fact, several previous studies have demonstrated direct interaction of Vif with the viral Gag precursor molecules in vitro (36Bardy M. Gay B. Pebernard S. Chazal N. Courcoul M. Vigne R. Decroly E.

Conformation-specific anti-Factor IX antibodies are directed at the calcium-stabilized Gla domain and interfere with Factor IX-membrane interaction. One such antibody, 10C12, recognizes the calcium-stabilized form of the Gla domain of Factor IX. We prepared the fully carboxylated Gla domain of Factor IX by solid phase peptide synthesis and crystallized Factor IX-(1-47) in complex with Fab fragments of the 10C12 antibody. The overall structure of the Gla domain in the Factor IX-(1-47)-antibody complex at 2.2 Å is similar to the structure of the Factor IX Gla domain in the presence of calcium ions as determined by NMR spectroscopy (Freedman, S. J., Furie, B. C., Furie, B., and Baleja, J. D. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 12126-12137) and by x-ray crystallography (Shikamoto, Y., Morita, T., Fujimoto, Z., and Mizuno, H. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 24090-24094). The complex structure shows that the complementarity determining region loops of the 10C12 antibody form a hydrophobic pocket to accommodate the hydrophobic patch of the Gla domain consisting of Leu-6, Phe-9, and Val-10. Polar interactions also play an important role in the antibody-antigen recognition. Furthermore, the calcium coordination network of the Factor IX Gla domain is different than in Gla domain structures of other vitamin K-dependent proteins. We conclude that this antibody is directed at the membrane binding site in the ω loop of Factor IX and blocks Factor IX function by inhibiting its interaction with membranes.

Factor IX plays an important role in an intermediate stage of the blood coagulation cascade (1Furie B. Furie B.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 505-518Google Scholar). Factor IX can be activated to Factor IXa in the presence of calcium ions either by Factor XIa or by the complex of Factor VIIa-tissue factor bound on membrane surfaces. Factor IXa and its cofactor, Factor VIIIa, assemble to form a membrane surface-bound enzyme complex that can efficiently activate Factor X to Factor Xa in the presence of calcium ions. Defective activity or deficiency of Factor IX due to mutation of the Factor IX gene is the cause of hemophilia B. The vitamin K-dependent blood coagulation and regulatory proteins require vitamin K for the posttranslational synthesis of γ-carboxyglutamic acid, an amino acid clustered in the N-terminal Gla 1The abbreviations used are: Gla, γ-carboxyglutamic acid; FIX, Factor IX; CDR, complementarity determining region; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; NMP, N-methylpyrrolidone; L, light chain; H, heavy chain; HC, heavy chain constant domain; HV, heavy chain variable domain; LC, light chain constant domain. 1The abbreviations used are: Gla, γ-carboxyglutamic acid; FIX, Factor IX; CDR, complementarity determining region; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; NMP, N-methylpyrrolidone; L, light chain; H, heavy chain; HC, heavy chain constant domain; HV, heavy chain variable domain; LC, light chain constant domain. domain of these proteins. The Gla domain is a membrane binding motif that, in the presence of calcium ions, supports interaction of these proteins with phospholipid membranes that include phosphatidylserine. We have recently reported the crystal structure of prothrombin fragment 1 bound to lysophosphatidylserine (2Huang M. Rigby A.C. Morelli X. Grant M.A. Huang G. Furie B. Seaton B. Furie B.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 751-756Google Scholar). The serine head group binds Gla domain-bound Ca-5 and Ca-6 and Gla residues 17 and 21, fixed elements of the Gla domain-fold, predicting the structural basis for phosphatidylserine specificity among Gla domains. The x-ray crystal structure of porcine Factor IX, performed in the absence of calcium, revealed the structure of the two epidermal growth factor domains and the serine protease domain but only a small C-terminal portion of the Gla domain because of disorder in the Gla domain in the absence of metal ions (3Brandstetter H. Bauer M. Huber R. Lollar P. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9796-9800Google Scholar). Efforts to crystallize intact Factor IX in the presence of calcium by our group and others have been unsuccessful. NMR studies of the Factor IX Gla domain in solution indicate a largely disordered and unstructured peptide in the absence of metal ions, but this domain folds into a stable structure in the presence of calcium ions (4Freedman S.J.

Based upon these studies, we have demonstrated that the phospholipid binding site is located in the ω loop, the N terminus of the Gla domain. However, the positions of calcium ions and an understanding of the coordination of calcium ions by γ-carboxyglutamic acid could not be determined except by extrapolation from the known structure of the Gla domain of prothrombin (7Soriano-Garcia M. Padmanabhan K. de Vos A.M. Tulinsky A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2554-2566Google Scholar) and by molecular modeling and energy minimization (8Li L. Darden T.A. Freedman S.J. Furie B.C. Furie B. Baleja J.D. Smith H. Hiskey R.G. Pedersen L.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2132-2138Google Scholar). Recently, the structure of bovine Factor IX-(1-46) bound to a snake venom protein, Factor IX-binding protein, has been crystallized in the presence of calcium and magnesium ions and in the presence of calcium alone (9Shikamoto Y. Morita T. Fujimoto Z. Mizuno H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24090-24094Google Scholar). Although the emphasis of this work is on the possible role of magnesium in Gla domain binding to membrane surfaces, examination of the calcium-Factor IX-(1-46) complex revealed that the calcium coordination within the Gla domain differs from the Gla domains of other vitamin K-dependent proteins, including prothrombin (7Soriano-Garcia M. Padmanabhan K. de Vos A.M. Tulinsky A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2554-2566Google Scholar), Factor VII (10Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chene C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Google Scholar), and Factor X (11Mizuno H. Fujimoto Z. Atoda H. Morita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7230-7234Google Scholar). This may be due to perturbations of the Factor IX Gla domain structure by the bound venom FIX-binding protein, or it may represent differences in the fine structure of the γ-carboxyglutamic acid-calcium network compared with other vitamin K-dependent proteins. Fab fragments of antibodies have facilitated the crystallization of proteins (12Zhou Y. Morais-Cabral J.H. Kaufman A. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2001; 414: 43-48Google Scholar). Using an anti-Factor IX antibody, 10C12, we have formed diffraction-quality single crystals of the Factor IX Gla domain-Fab 10C12 complex. Anti-Factor IX antibody 10C12 was one of a panel of antibodies identified from a phage display single-chain Fv (scFv) human antibody library screened against a synthetic Factor IX Gla domain in the presence of calcium ions (13Suggett S. Kirchhofer D. Hass P. Lipari T. Moran P. Nagel M. Judice K. Schroeder K. Tom J. Lowman H. Adams C. Eaton D. Devaux B. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 2000; 11: 27-42Google Scholar). 10C12 was then reformatted into a F(ab′)2-like form with two Fab fragments connected by a leucine zipper. A conformation-specific antibody, 10C12, similar to those that bind prothrombin or Factor IX in the presence of calcium ions but not in the presence of magnesium ions (14Lewis R.M. Furie B.C. Furie B. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 948-954Google Scholar, 15Borowski M. Furie B.C. Bauminger S. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14969-14975Google Scholar, 16Liebman H.A. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7605-7612Google Scholar) is a calcium-dependent and calcium-specific antibody for Factor IX. There was no binding in the presence of magnesium ions (17Refino C.J. Himber J. Burcklen L. Moran P. Peek M. Suggett S. Devaux B. Kirchhofer D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 1188-1195Google Scholar, 18Refino C.J. Jeet S. DeGuzman L. Bunting S. Kirchhofer D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 517-522Google Scholar). We report here the crystal structure of the Factor IX Gla domain in the presence of calcium ions in complex with the 10C12 Fab fragment of a conformation-specific antibody directed against the calcium-stabilized form of the Gla domain of Factor IX. We identify the Factor IX-antibody interface that provides a structural basis to understanding the inhibition of membrane binding by this conformation-specific antibody. Furthermore, the marked similarity of the positions of bound calcium ions and the coordination network that defines the interaction of γ-carboxyglutamic acids with calcium ions in our Factor IX Gla domain structure, bound to the conformation-specific antibody at the hydrophobic patch (Leu-6, Phe-9, and Val-10) in the ω loop and the bovine Factor IX Gla domain bound to the venom Factor IX binding protein on a surface on the side of the Gla domain involving Phe-25, indicates that the differences observed between the Factor IX γ-carboxyglutamic acid-calcium coordination network and the Gla domains of other vitamin K-dependent proteins are not due to perturbation of the structure of the Gla domain by bound protein. Materials—10C12 F(ab′)2 was a kind gift from Drs. C. J. Refino and D. Kirchhofer (Genentech). Protein concentration was assayed using the Advanced Protein Assay (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO). Mecuripapain and cysteine were purchased from Sigma. Iodoacetamide was from Pierce Biotechnology (Rockford, IL). Mecuripapain (final concentration 0.5 mg/ml) was activated at 37 °C for 15 min with 10 mm cysteine in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 12.5 mm EDTA. Preparation of 10C12 Fab Fragments—The following were the optimized digestion conditions after different antibody to papain ratios, incubation time, and quenching conditions were tested. Reaction buffer (95 μl; 1.0 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 0.5 m NaCl) and 241 μl of activated papain (0.5 mg/ml) were added to 710 μl of 10C12 F(ab′)2 (1.6 mg/ml). The digestion mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 120 μl of 0.1 m iodoacetamide. The reaction mixture was then applied to a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 gel filtration column, and the column eluted with 0.2 m NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 25 mm MES at pH 5.8. Chemical Synthesis of Factor IX-(1-47)—Peptides were synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)/N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) chemistry on an Applied Biosystems Model 430A peptide synthesizer. Amino acids were coupled as 1-hydroxybenzotriazole esters onto p-hydroxymethylphenoxymethylpolystyrene resin preloaded with aspartic acid (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). All of the residues from cycle 20 through 47 were double-coupled. Following each coupling, all of the uncoupled α-N termini were acetylated. Gla residues were coupled using modified activation, coupling, and deprotection cycles. Gla (1 mmol) was dissolved in 0.4 ml of dichloromethane and 1.0 ml of N-hydroxybenzotriazole/NMP for 1 h with nitrogen agitation. Coupling onto a deprotected resin-bound amino acid proceeded for a total of 90 min with constant vortexing. After removal of amino acid solution and washing with NMP, Gla residues were deprotected with 20% piperidine/NMP for 30 min. Five NMP washes were done prior to the next amino acid addition. Cleavage of the peptide from its solid support and simultaneous side chain deprotection was performed using trifluoroacetic acid/water/thioanisole/phenol/1,2-ethanedithiol (82.5:5:5:5:2.5). The cleavage reaction was allowed to proceed for 5 h at 25 °C. The peptide was then purified on a C18 high pressure liquid chromatography column eluted with an acetonitrile/water gradient. Lyophilized Factor IX-(1-47) (1.2 mg) was dissolved in 1.2 ml of sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 0.5 m NaCl. This solution was transferred to an Eppendorf tube containing 24 μl of 20 mm CaCl2 and then to 12 μl of 0.2 m CaCl2 to raise the final calcium chloride concentration to 2 mm. The reconstituted Factor IX-(1-47) remained clear at room temperature indefinitely but precipitated when stored at 4 °C. 10C12 Fab-Factor IX-(1-47) Complex Formation and Crystallization—10C12 Fab fragment (4 ml; 0.18 mg/ml) was mixed with 1 ml of Factor IX-(1-47) at 0.50 mg/ml. The complex was purified on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 gel filtration column to eliminate aggregates using 0.2 m NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5. The purified protein was concentrated in a Millipore Ultrafree concentrator with 5,000 molecular weight cutoff to a concentration of 4.0 mg/ml. Crystals of 10C12 Fab-Factor IX-(1-47) complex were formed using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at a precipitant condition of 2.3 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm calcium chloride, 2% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. The crystals were rapidly soaked in mother liquor containing 25% glycerol and then flash-frozen in a liquid nitrogen stream and mounted in the goniometer head for diffraction data collection. X-ray Data Collection and Structure Determination—The x-ray diffraction data used to determine the crystal structure 10C12 Fab-Factor IX-(1-47) complex were collected at beam lines ×12c and ×25. All of the diffraction data were indexed and processed using the HKL2000 suite (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Google Scholar). The structure was determined by the molecular replacement method with AMORE software (20Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Google Scholar). Homology models of 10C12 Fab heavy and light chains were built from their sequences by program SwissProt (21Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Google Scholar). The template PDB coordinates used for homology modeling were as follows: 2FB4L, 2IG2L, 1DCLB, 1DCLA, and 3MCG2 for the light chain, and 2IG2H, 1AQKH, 8FABD, 1DFBH, and 2FB4H for the heavy chain, respectively. This Fab model was then separated into four domains to be used as molecular replacement models: heavy chain constant domain (HC), heavy chain variable domain (HV), light chain constant domain (LC), and light chain variable domain. Models from domain HC, HV, and LC gave distinguishable AMORE molecular replacement rotational solutions with the height of first peaks approximately 1ó higher than the strongest noise peak (defined as peak drop) at a resolution range of 8-4 Å. At the translational function step of the molecular replacement method, however, only the LC model gave discernible AMORE translation function solutions that were 1.2σ higher than the strongest noise peaks and had a correlation coefficient of 0.55 at a 15-4-Å resolution range. This LC model was then fixed and used to search for the positions of the rest of the models, yielding translation function peak drop/correlation coefficients of 3.7σ/53.0, 4.0σ/53.9, and 7.3σ/52.9 for HC, HV, and light chain variable domains, respectively. All of these domains assembled properly into a Fab molecule and packed well inside a crystal lattice without severe overlap with symmetry-related molecules. This Fab fragment was refined successfully to R and Rfree values of 0.305 and 0.372, respectively, by CNS (22Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar), further confirming the correct molecular replacement solution of the Fab fragment. At this stage, the correct conformations of side chains of complementarity determining regions (CDR) were clearly visible in 3Fo - 2Fc σA-weighted electron density maps (23Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Google Scholar) and were adjusted or built-in manually using the graphic program (24Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar). Molecular replacement using models derived from other Gla domain structures failed despite the high degree of sequence and structural homology among the known Gla domains (7Soriano-Garcia M. Padmanabhan K. de Vos A.M. Tulinsky A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2554-2566Google Scholar, 10Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chene C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D.

However, the 3Fo - 2Fc σA-weighted electron density maps revealed some connected density, presumably Gla domain, next to Fab CDR loops. A Gla domain model derived from the crystal structure of the Factor X Gla domain-Factor X-binding protein complex (11Mizuno H. Fujimoto Z. Atoda H. Morita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7230-7234Google Scholar) was then manually positioned into this electron density. The resulting Gla domain packed well with neighboring molecules and was successfully refined with molecular dynamic simulated annealing and conjugate gradient minimization protocols together with some manual adjustment to final R and Rfree values of 0.233 and 0.270, respectively.

The current model consists of residues 1-210 of the 10C12 light chain, residues 1-126 and 135-217 of the 10C12 heavy chain, residues 1-45 of the Factor IX-(1-47), and 148 loosely attached solvent molecules (Table I). The model was refined at 2.2 Å to Rcryst and Rfree values of 0.233 and 0.270, respectively (Table I). Most of the bond angles of residues are clustered in energetically favorable (88.0%) or allowed (11.1%) regions of the Ramachandran plot. Residue Asp-152L of the 10C12 Fab fragment was clearly defined by the electron density maps but located outside of these regions. This is probably because this side chain makes hydrogen bonds to the imidazole ring of His-189L and the main chain N atom of Lys-190L partially compensating for the high energy conformation (Φ/ψ = 69.8°/-97.0°) of its main chain. Residue 51L of 10C12 also adopts a high energy conformation (Φ/ψ = 68.1°/-45.1°), a situation commonly found in antibody structures (for example, see Ref. 31Huang M. Syed R. Stura E.A. Stone M.J. Stefanko R.S. Ruf W. Edgington T.S. Wilson I.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 873-894Google Scholar). Disorder around the heavy chain residues near residue 130 is also often observed in antibody structures. Residues 127-134 of the 10C12 heavy chain were not included in the current model because of poorly defined electron density in this region. Two C-terminal residues of the Factor IX-(1-47), residues 46 and 47, did not have well defined electron densities and were omitted from the final model.Table ISummary of X-ray diffraction data collection and model refinement for 10C12 Fab-factor IX Gla domain complex crystalTemperature for data collection−170 °CCrystal diffraction limit2.10 ÅTotal number of reflections241,036No. of unique reflections28,585 (1353)cNumbers in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell.Overall data redundancy8.4Data completeness81.9% (38.7%)cNumbers in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell.Data RmergeaRmerge = ΣhΣi|Ii(h) - (I(h))|/ΣhΣiIi(h), where (I(h)) is the mean intensity, I(h), of reflection h.0.050 (0.119)cNumbers in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell.Data I/σ25.7 (5.4)cNumbers in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell.Model refinementProtein/solvent atoms3640/148Calcium/sulfate ions6/1Resolution for refinement24.66-2.20RcrystbRcryst = Σhkl|Fo - Fc|/Σhkl Fo. values0.233 (0.278)cNumbers in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell.Rfree value0.270 (0.332)cNumbers in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell. for 1298 reflection (4.9%)Estimated coordinate error0.31 Å (from Luzatti plot (47Luzzati V.

Open table in a new tab The crystal structure of the complex of the 10C12 Fab and Factor IX-(1-47) indicates the interaction of the antibody with the N-terminal ω loop of Factor IX (Fig. 1). Fab 10C12 is typical of an anti-protein antibody with six CDR loops forming a concave and undulating antigen binding surface (32Wilson I.A. Stanfield R.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 857-867Google Scholar). CDR loops H1, H2, H3, and L3 from this antigen binding surface form a hydrophobic pocket that binds exposed N-terminal residues of Factor IX-(1-47), resulting in an interface with a total area of 1338 Å2. This interface is one of the smallest among protein-anti-protein antibody complexes (29McDonald I.K. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 777-793Google Scholar) despite the high affinity interaction (Kd 1.6 nm) between 10C12 Fab and Factor IX-(1-47) (13Suggett S. Kirchhofer D. Hass P. Lipari T. Moran P. Nagel M. Judice K. Schroeder K. Tom J. Lowman H. Adams C. Eaton D. Devaux B. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 2000; 11: 27-42Google Scholar). Although 10C12 is a calcium-dependent conformation-specific antibody recognizing only the calcium-stabilized Factor IX-(1-47) conformer, no direct interactions between the Fab fragment of the antibody and calcium ions in the Gla domain were observed. 10C12 Fab-Factor IX Gla Interactions—Despite sequence similarities within the N terminus of the vitamin K-dependent proteins (Fig. 2), the 10C12 antibody is specific for Factor IX and does not bind to the Gla domains of other vitamin K-dependent proteins, although it does bind to Factor IX of other species. A hydrophobic pocket is formed from 10C12 Fab CDR heavy chain residues Ala-33, His-35, Ile-50, Tyr-52A, Ser-52, Lys-56, Tyr-58, Ala-98, Ala-100, Arg-100A, and CDR light chain residues Trp-91 and Phe-96 (Fig. 3) (numbered using the Kabat-Wu system (33Wu T.T. Kabat E.A. J. Exp. Med. 1970; 132: 211-250Google Scholar)). Light chain residue Phe-96 and heavy chain residues Ile-50 and His-35 constitute the bottom of the pocket. The wall of the pocket is built in part by heavy chain residues Tyr-58, Lys-56, and Ser-52 and in part by light chain residue Trp-91. Heavy chain residue Ala-100 defines a protrusion in wall of the hydrophobic pocket. The presence of glycine instead of alanine at this residue greatly reduced the affinity between this antibody and the Factor IX Gla domain (13Suggett S. Kirchhofer D. Hass P. Lipari T. Moran P. Nagel M. Judice K. Schroeder K. Tom J. Lowman H. Adams C. Eaton D. Devaux B. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 2000; 11: 27-42Google Scholar), illustrating the importance of the shape of this pocket. The hydrophobic pocket accommodates the antigenic determinant within Factor IX, including Lys-5, Leu-6, Phe-9, Val-10, and Gln-11. Polar interactions are limited to the electrostatic interaction between Lys-5 on Factor IX and Asp-93 and Asn-31 on the antibody light chain. Only four hydrogen bonds were found between 10C12 and Factor IX-(1-47) (Table II).Fig. 3The CDR loops of 10C12 Fab form a hydrophobic pocket. The CDR loops of 10C12 Fab (blue tubes) form a hydrophobic pocket as shown as a stereoimage. The molecular surface of 10C12 Fab is represented by the white net.

The conformations of most of the residues are well defined by the electron density map. This map illustrates a unique conformation of the 10C12 CDR3 loop of the heavy chain (residues 96H-100H), a tight β turn characterized by a hydrogen bond between side chains in addition to the usual main chain hydrogen bond between i and i+3 residues. Gln-11 of Factor IX-(1-47) interacts with all three CDR loops of the Fab heavy chain. The amide nitrogen atom of Gln-11 forms a hydrogen bond (2.49 Å) to the 10C12 heavy chain residue Thr-31. Water molecules also mediate the interaction between Factor IX and the antibody. A cavity identified in the antibody-antigen interface is occupied by a water molecule (S148). Structure of the Factor IX-(1-47)—The Gla domain of Factor IX consists of an N-terminal ω loop and three short α-helixes (helix A: residues 14-19; helix B: residues 24-32; helix C: residues 35-45) (Figs. 5 and 7). Most of the calcium ions (numbered 1-5) are positioned between the ω loop and the A and B helices with calcium liganding providing the folding energy to align the ω loop properly. Helices A and B are connected by a tight turn and further stabilized by a conserved disulfide bond between residues 18 and 23 of the Gla domain. The two cysteine residues also form two hydrogen bonds (Tyr-45 to Cys-18, 3.10 Å; Tyr-45 to Cys-23, 2.88 Å) to the side chain of a conserved Tyr-45 of helix C, providing an anchor to bundle three helices together. This tyrosine residue and the disulfide bond are part of the hydrophobic core between helix C and helix A/B that includes Phe-25"
https://openalex.org/W2062346960,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae GRX5 gene codes for a mitochondrial glutaredoxin involved in the synthesis of iron/sulfur clusters. Its absence prevents respiratory growth and causes the accumulation of iron inside cells and constitutive oxidation of proteins. Null Δgrx5 mutants were used as an example of continuously oxidized cells, as opposed to situations in which oxidative stress is instantaneously caused by addition of external oxidants. Whole transcriptome analysis was carried out in the mutant cells. The set of genes whose expression was affected by the absence of Grx5 does not significantly overlap with the set of genes affected in respiratory petite mutants. Many Aft1-dependent genes involved in iron utilization that are up-regulated in a frataxin mutant were also up-regulated in the absence of Grx5. BIO5 is another Aft1-dependent gene induced both upon iron deprivation and in Δgrx5 cells; this links iron and biotin metabolism. Other genes are specifically affected under the oxidative conditions generated by the grx5 mutation. One of these is MLP1, which codes for a homologue of the Slt2 kinase. Cells lacking MLP1 and GRX5 are hypersensitive to oxidative stress caused by external agents and exhibit increased protein oxidation in relation to single mutants. This in turn points to a role for Mlp1 in protection against oxidative stress. The genes of the Hap4 regulon, which are involved in respiratory metabolism, are down-regulated in Δgrx5 cells.

Cells growing aerobically are subjected to oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; KAPA, 7-keto 8-aminoperlargonic; t-BOOH, t-butyl hydroperoxide; MAP, mitogen-activated protein. 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; KAPA, 7-keto 8-aminoperlargonic; t-BOOH, t-butyl hydroperoxide; MAP, mitogen-activated protein. produced at the respiratory chain in the presence of oxygen (1Storz G. Imlay J.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Cells have developed a number of enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms to counteract the damage that ROS cause to the different cellular macromolecules. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, addition of external oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide or menadione (a generator of superoxide anion) cause a rapid and generally transient transcriptional response (2Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3696) Google Scholar, 3Causton H.C. Ren B. Koh S.S.

This consists of the induction of genes involved in hydrogen peroxide and superoxide detoxification, as well as those related to redox homeostasis within the cell. In the case of hydrogen peroxide, observations at the transcriptome level confirm studies carried out at the proteome level (4Godon C. Lagniel G. Lee J. Buhler J.-M. Kieffer S. Perrot M. Boucherie H.

Toledano M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16040-16046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Two transcriptional regulators that respond to oxidative stress, Yap1 and Skn7, are important in such a response to hydrogen peroxide (5Lee J. Godon C. Lagniel G. Spector D. Garin J. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16040-16046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 6Toledano M.B. Delaunay A. Biteau B. Spector D. Azevedo D. Hohmann S. Mager P.W.H. Topics in Current Genetics. 1. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2003: 241-303Google Scholar). The Yap1 regulon involves two types of proteins as follows: those required for antioxidant scavenging, and enzymes that participate in the metabolic pathways that regenerate cell reducing power in the form of glutathione and NADPH. The first subset of proteins is also Skn7-dependent, whereas the second is not (5Lee J. Godon C. Lagniel G. Spector D. Garin J. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16040-16046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Msn2 and Msn4 are two transcription factors that respond to different stresses, including oxidative stress, by regulating gene expression through binding to STRE promoter elements (7Martínez-Pastor M.T. Marchler G.C.S. Marchler-Bauer A. Ruis H. Estruch F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2227-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 8Schmitt A.P. McEntee K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5777-5782Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The defense function of Msn2/4 partially overlaps with that of Yap1. However, Yap1 seems to be more important for the adaptive response induced by moderate concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, whereas Msn2/4 would be preferentially implicated in recovery from acute exposure to the oxidant (9Hasan R. Leroy C. Isnard A.D. Labarre J. Boy-Marcotte E. Toledano M.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the specific role that Msn2/4 has in regulating expression of genes involved in protein degradation pathways (9Hasan R. Leroy C. Isnard A.D. Labarre J. Boy-Marcotte E. Toledano M.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).Most studies into the results of oxidative stress on yeast cells have involved adding external oxidants to cell cultures. However, this does not necessarily reproduce the physiological effect caused by aerobic respiration or other types of oxidation at moderate but constant levels. Proteins of S. cerevisiae cells growing under aerobic conditions are more exposed to continuous oxidation than proteins from anaerobic cultures (10Cabiscol E. Piulats E. Echave P. Herrero E. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27393-27398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter demonstrated continuous oxidative stress under aerobic conditions. However, the gene expression pattern of cells that shift from fermentative to respiratory metabolism at the diauxic transition (11De Risi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3684) Google Scholar, 12Lascaris R. Bussemaker H.J. Boorsma A. Piper M. van der Spek H. Grivell L. Blom J. Genome Biol. 2002; 4: R1-R10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is very different from that of cells subjected to external aggression by oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide, menadione, or diamide (2Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3696) Google Scholar, 3Causton H.C. Ren B. Koh S.S.

Thioredoxins and glutaredoxins are two thiol oxidoreductases that play an important role in protecting sulfhydryl groups in proteins against oxidation and therefore in maintaining the protein activity under these conditions (13Trotter E.W. Grant C.M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Grx5 is a monothiol glutaredoxin of S. cerevisiae (a single cysteine at the active site) whose absence leads to high sensitivity to oxidative agents and to constitutive carbonylation of proteins (a parameter that measures protein oxidation (10Cabiscol E. Piulats E. Echave P. Herrero E. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27393-27398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) even in the absence of external oxidative injury (14Rodríguez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Accumulation of glutathionated proteins has also been observed in the absence of Grx5 (15Shenton D. Perrone G. Quinn K.A. Dawes I.W. Grant C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16853-16859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 16Shenton E.W. Grant C.M. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). This monothiol glutaredoxin is located at the mitochondria, where it is involved in the formation of iron-sulfur clusters (17Rodríguez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Bellí G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). As occurs with other proteins of the iron-sulfur assembly complex, lack of Grx5 causes iron accumulation within the cell. This could be related to the observed constitutive protein oxidation due to the formation of high levels of ROS via the Fenton reaction (17Rodríguez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Bellí G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). A Δgrx5 mutant is therefore an appropriate model for studying the effect of continuous oxidative stress on gene expression. In this work, we carried out transcriptome analysis of the Grx5-defective mutant. The results show that under these conditions the expression program was significantly different from the transcription pattern described in response to external oxidants, the inhibition of respiratory genes being a relevant response.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Growth Conditions—Wild type S. cerevisiae strain W303-1A (MATa ura3-52 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 his3-11,15 ade2-1) was employed in this study. MML100 is a Δgrx5::kanMX4 derivative of W303-1A (17Rodríguez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Bellí G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). MML511 is an isogenic derivative of W303-1A that contains the Δpet117::kanMX4 disruption. It was constructed using the short flanking homology approach following PCR amplification of the kanMX4 cassette (resistance for geneticin) from plasmid pFA6a-kanMX4 with appropriate oligonucleotides (18Wach A. Brachat A. Pöhlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 13: 1793-1808Crossref Scopus (2224) Google Scholar). The resulting PET117 deletion covers exactly from the initial to the stop codon. Disruption was confirmed by PCR analysis (18Wach A. Brachat A. Pöhlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 13: 1793-1808Crossref Scopus (2224) Google Scholar). The same strategy was employed for disruption of YKL161C (MLP1) in the W303-1A background, although in this case the natMX4 marker cassette (resistance for nourseothricin) was used (19Goldstein A.L. McCusker J.H. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1541-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). The resulting Δmlp1::natMX4 strain (MML524) was crossed with the MATα Δgrx5::kanMX4 mutant MML289 (17Rodríguez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Bellí G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), and the double W303-1A Δmlp1::natMX4 Δgrx5::kanMX4 mutant (MML533) was segregated. The W303-1A aft1-Δ5::URA3 (MML348) and W303-1A yfh1::kanMX4 (MML298) strains have been described previously (17Rodríguez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Bellí G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 942-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) that contains HAP4 under the control of the doxycycline-regulated tetO7 promoter.Cells were generally grown in rich YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) at 30 °C. In some experiments 3% glycerol was used instead of glucose (YPGly medium). Synthetic complete medium (SC) contains 0.67% yeast nitrogen base (Difco), 2% glucose, and the amino acids and nitrogen base additions indicated in Ref. 21Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar. In some experiments, SC medium was prepared by adding the individual components at the standard concentrations, with the exception of biotin, which was included at the indicated final concentrations.Array Hybridizations and Data Analyses—Experiments representing a particular situation were independently carried out in triplicate. Total RNA from W303-1A wild type strain and the Δgrx5 and Δpet117 mutants was used to obtain labeled cDNA. About 30–40 μg of RNA were retrotranscribed into cDNA by adding 200 units of RT polymerase SuperScript II (Invitrogen), 500 ng of oligo(dT) primer (5′-T15VN-3′), 1 μl of RNaseOUT (Invitrogen), 6 μl of 5× First Strand Buffer (Invitrogen), 1.5 μl of dNTP mix (16 mm dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and 100 μm dCTP), and 5 μl of [33P]dCTP (10 mCi/ml) in a final reaction volume of 30 μl. Labeling reaction was allowed for 1 h at 43 °C. One microliter of EDTA 0.5 m was added to stop the reaction. The labeled sample was purified using an S300-HR MicroSpin column (Amersham Biosciences).Macroarrays were made in nylon membranes containing PCR products representing full-length open reading frames for 6,049 genes of S. cerevisiae. They were prepared at the Servicio de Chips de DNA of the University of Valencia. After pre-hybridizing nylon membranes for 1 h in 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's, 0.5% SDS, hybridizations were performed using the same solution containing labeled cDNA (3.5 × 106 dpm/ml) for 16–18 h. After hybridization, the filters were washed once in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min, and twice in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min. They were exposed to a imaging plate (BAS-MP, Fujifilm) for 24 h and read in a PhosphorImager (FLA-3000, Fujifilm) at 50 μm resolution.The images were quantified by using ArrayVision 7.0 software (Imaging Research, Inc.). Each mutant replicate was normalized against the corresponding wild type hybridized in the same membrane (to eliminate the membrane variability factor) following the Lowess method. Reproducibility of the replicates was tested by the ArrayStat software (Imaging Research, Inc.). The data were considered as independent, and the program was allowed to take a minimum number of two valid replicates in order to calculate mean values for every gene. Only one of the three replicates was allowed to be removed from further calculations. A Z test for independent data was applied in order to detect differences in individual gene expression between each mutant and the wild type. Then a Z score was obtained for every gene. A p value of 0.05 and the False Discovery Rate method were used to monitor the overall false positive error rate. Genes that changed at least two times in the mutant with respect to the wild type strain were considered for further analyses and discussion.Detailed macroarray data reported in this work were deposited at the GEO data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) with accession numbers GSM13717, GSM13719, GSM13722, GSM13727, GSM729, GSM13730, GSM13732, GSM13733, and GSM13734.Data Base Analyses—Data on the expression of individual genes from global genome analyses were obtained from the Yeast Microarray Global Viewer (yMGV, transcriptome.ens.fr/ymgv). Analysis of genes whose expression is modulated throughout the cell cycle (22Spellman P.T. Sherlock G. Zhang M.Q. Iyer V.R. Anders K. Eisen M. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Futcher B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3273-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (3883) Google Scholar) was carried out with the Saccharomyces Genome Data base (genome-www.stanford.edu).Northern Blot Studies—RNA electrophoresis, probe labeling with digoxigenin, hybridization, and signal detection was carried out as described previously (20Bellí G. Garí E. Piedrafita L. Aldea M. Herrero E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 942-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Signals were quantified using the Lumi-Imager equipment (Roche Applied Science) software. Gene probes were generated from genomic DNA by PCR, using oligonucleotides designed to amplify internal open reading frame regions.Sensitivity Tests—Exponential cultures in YPD medium at 30 °C (about 2 × 107 cells per ml) were serially diluted (5-fold dilution factor), and 2 μl drops of each dilution were spotted onto YPD plates containing inhibitory agents at various concentrations. Growth was tested after 3 days of incubation at 30 °C. In parallel, growth was also recorded in YPD plates without an inhibitor after incubation in the same conditions.Protein Carbonylation Analyses—Protein carbonyl groups in cell extracts were derivatized with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine. This was followed by SDS-PAGE and the immunodetection of peptides using an anti-dinitrophenylhydrazone antibody, according to Ref. 10Cabiscol E. Piulats E. Echave P. Herrero E. Ros J. J. Biol.

Transcriptome analyses were carried out in three independent experiments in these growth conditions for each of the strains. Table I lists the genes that showed expression levels in Δgrx5 cells that were at least twice as high as in wild type cells. Table II shows the genes whose expression levels in Δgrx5 cells were at least 50% lower than the expression levels in wild type cells. Cells lacking GRX5 exhibit a ρ- petite phenotype, that is they do not grow under respiratory conditions (17Rodríguez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Bellí G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that S. cerevisiae mitochondrial DNA ρ° mutants have an altered expression profile (23Traven A. Wong J.M.S. Xu D. Sopta M. Ingles C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4020-4027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). As expression pattern for Δgrx5 cells could have been influenced by their petite defects, we carried out a parallel transcriptome analysis of Δpet117 cells with the same W303-1A genetic background. The total number of genes either up or down-regulated in the Δgrx5 mutant was considerably lower than in the Δpet117 cells. This is clearly seen in Fig. 1A, where points are more widely distributed along the x axis (Δpet117 relative profile) than along the y axis (Δgrx5 profile). Both Tables I and II indicate the genes affected in Δgrx5 cells that were up- or down-regulated, respectively, in Δpet117 with respect to wild type cells. The proportion of these genes was very low in both cases, and we can therefore conclude that the transcriptome profile of Grx5-deficient cells was not significantly influenced by the petite character of the mutant. As revealed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, 2M. A. de la Torre, G. Bellí, and E. Herrero, unpublished data. the Δgrx5 mutant accumulated a large proportion of cells at the G1 stage of the cell cycle. This fact could have influenced the expression profile of those genes whose expression changed throughout the cell cycle (22Spellman P.T. Sherlock G. Zhang M.Q. Iyer V.R. Anders K. Eisen M. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Futcher B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3273-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (3883) Google Scholar). However, the proportion of these cell cycle-dependent genes whose expression is up- or down-regulated in the Δgrx5 cells was low (Tables I and II), and overall, this did not significantly affect the analyses.Table IGenes induced in Δgrx5 cells Values are averages for three independent experiments.

https://openalex.org/W1999838828,"Combination therapies treating human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection delay the emergence of drug-resistant virus and exhibit synergistic inhibition. This synergy is observed within the two classes of inhibitors that target the essential viral reverse transcriptase (RT): the chain-terminating nucleoside analogs (NRTIs) and the allosteric nonnucleosides (NNRTIs) that bind in a pocket distinct from the active site. A general mechanism to define the molecular basis for synergy between these two classes remains to be elucidated. Previous mechanistic studies from our laboratory (Spence, R. A., Kati, W. M., Anderson, K. S., and Johnson, K. A. (1995) Science 267, 988-993) have shown that the natural deoxynucleoside triphosphate and the NNRTI can simultaneously bind to their respective sites. This work also suggests communication between the two sites, since the inhibition of RT by NNRTIs is manifested through a remote effect on the chemical step. This interplay between the two sites offers a plausible hypothesis for understanding synergy in which binding of NNRTIs modulates the chain termination by NRTIs. The present study supports this hypothesis by illustrating that the clinically approved NNRTIs, nevirapine and efavirenz, inhibit the ATP-mediated removal of AZTMP, d4TMP, ddCMP, (-)3TCMP, (-)FTCMP, and (+)3TCMP, thereby prolonging the effectiveness of chain termination. This inhibition is mediated through an effect on both the rate of the chemical step and binding of ATP, resulting in an overall decrease in efficiency of removal.

This work substantiates communication between the two binding pockets, the sustained use of combination therapy to treat HIV infection, and a molecular basis for understanding synergy. Monotherapy treatment against HIV-1 infection can be beneficial in decreasing viral load but is ultimately rendered ineffective by the appearance of drug-selected mutations. Combination therapy, however, strives to delay the emergence of drug-selected mutations and viral resistance (1Hammer S.M. Kessler H.A. Saag M.S. J. Acquir. Immune. Defic.

While multiple-drug therapies comprising of RT and PR inhibitors delay resistance, cocktails of these inhibitors can also exhibit additive or synergistic inhibition of viral replication (3De Clercq E. Antiviral Res. 1998; 38: 153-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, synergy is also observed within two classes of RT inhibitors, that is, the nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs), can show synergy with the nonnucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs) in the absence of PR inhibitors (4Zhu Q.Y. Scarborough A. Polsky B. Chou T.C. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1996; 12: 507-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For example, the NRTI, AZT (zidovudine), and the NNRTI, nevirapine, exhibit synergy when given in combination to cultured cells (5Richman D. Rosenthal A.S. Skoog M. Eckner R.J. Chou T.C. Sabo J.P.

This increase in potency from combination therapy has been observed among other combinations of NRTIs and NNRTIs, both in cultured cells and in patients (6Balzarini J. Pelemans H. Aquaro S.

The nucleoside analog family of inhibitors is prodrug nucleosides, which are transported across host cellular membranes and phosphorylated to the metabolically active nucleotides. These nucleotides serve as substrates for RT, and lacking a 3′-hydroxyl group, they serve to chain-terminate a growing DNA strand. This chain termination and their competition with natural dNTPs yields their therapeutic value (10Goody R.S. Muller B. Restle T. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, previous studies have demonstrated that RT can catalyze either ATP or PPi-mediated removal of chain-terminating analogs (11Arion D. Kaushik N. McCormick S. Borkow G.

ATP and PPi act as nucleophiles that directly attack the phosphodiester linkage to form either an ATP analog dinucleoside tetraphosphate (14Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Tolun A.A. Pfeifer I. So A.G.

Structural evidence shows that the allosteric nonnucleoside inhibitors bind to a pocket ∼10 Å away from the polymerase site (15Tantillo C. Ding J. Jacobo-Molina A. Nanni R.G. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H.

A. 1991; 88: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Despite much published work on the modes of inhibition by NRTIs and NNRTIs, how they mechanistically display synergy observed in vivo and in vitro has largely remained unknown. It is unclear if a general mechanism exists that may account for synergy observed. Earlier mechanistic studies from our lab and others (22Spence R.A. Kati W.M. Anderson K.S. Johnson K.A. Science. 1995; 267: 988-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 23Rittinger K. Divita G. Goody R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8046-8049Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) have illustrated that the natural deoxynucleoside triphosphate dNTP and the NNRTI can simultaneously occupy their respective sites. Moreover, this work also suggests that communication occurs between the active and allosteric sites, since the inhibition of RT by NNRTIs is manifested through a remote effect on the chemical step. At the molecular level, transient kinetic studies have shown that nonnucleoside inhibitors change the rate-limiting step of catalysis, resulting in chemistry as the slowest step (22Spence R.A. Kati W.M. Anderson K.S. Johnson K.A. Science. 1995; 267: 988-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 23Rittinger K. Divita G. Goody R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8046-8049Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This interplay between the two sites offers a plausible hypothesis for understanding the molecular mechanism of synergy in which binding of NNRTIs modulates the chain termination by NRTIs. Recent work showing that synergy may be mediated between the nucleoside analog AZT and the nonnucleoside UC781 through a nucleotide removal pathway (24Borkow G. Arion D. Wainberg M.A. Parniak M.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 259-263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) lends support for this hypothesis. In this study, it was proposed that UC781 resensitizes AZT-resistant virus to AZT as a result of decreased PPi-mediated removal of AZTMP from primer ends with the addition of UC781. A similar study with AZT and NNRTIs nevirapine and 9-chlorotetrahydroimidazobenzodiazepinone (9-Cl-TIBO) also implicates this pathway in the context of AZT resistance (25Odriozola L. Cruchaga C. Andreola M. Dolle V. Nguyen C.H. Tarrago-Litvak L. Perez-Mediavilla A. Martinez-Irujo J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42710-42716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Still it remains unanswered if these results may account for synergy with other combinations of NRTIs and NNRTIs. Using a transient kinetic approach that has been previously been employed in our lab to study nucleoside analog incorporation and the mechanism of NNRTI inhibition, the present work was aimed to study clinically relevant combinations to define a general molecular mechanism of synergy between RT inhibitors. The NRTIs AZT, d4T, ddC, (-)3TC, newly approved (-)FTC, (+)3TC, and the NNRTIs nevirapine and efavirenz were used in this study to examine a wide panel of RT inhibitors. We show that nonnucleosides inhibit the ability of HIV-1 RT to remove nucleoside analogs mediated by a physiological concentration of ATP. The inhibition is a result of modulating both the binding of ATP and the rate of the chemical step. This work substantiates communication between the two inhibitory pockets and a molecular basis for understanding synergy. Expression and Purification of HIV-1 RT—The RTWT clone was generously provided by Stephen Hughes, Paul Boyer, and Andrea Ferris (Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Frederick, MD). N-terminal histidine-tagged heterodimeric p66/p51 reverse transcriptase was purified as described previously (26Kerr S.G. Anderson K.S.

Materials—AZTTP was acquired from Moravek Biochemicals. d4T was purchased from Sigma, and phosphorylation to the triphosphate was performed as described previously (27Ray A.S. Yang Z. Shi J. Hobbs A.

ATP was purchased from Sigma and treated with thermostable pyrophosphatase (Roche Applied Science) to degrade any contaminating pyrophosphate. Labeling and Annealing of Oligonucleotides—Primers and templates were synthesized at the Keck Facility at Yale University and purified with 20% polyacrylamide denaturing gel electrophoresis.

D23A-AZTMP, D22A-d4TMP, D23B-(-)3TCMP, D23B-(-)FTC, and D23B-(+)3TC primers were made with previously reported methods (28Johnson A.A. Ray A.S. Hanes J. Suo Z. Colacino J.M. Anderson K.S.

Pre-steady State Removal Assays—ATP-mediated removal was studied as described previously (30Ray A.S. Murakami E. Basavapathruni A. Vaccaro J.A. Ulrich D. Chu C.K. Schinazi R.F. Anderson K.S.

All concentrations represent final concentrations, and enzyme concentration is based on a pre-steady-state active site determination. In removal experiments lacking NNRTIs, dimethyl sulfoxide was used as a control (representing less than 2% of total reaction mixture). Products were separated on a 20% polyacrylamide gel and quantitated on a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX. Data Analysis—Data were quantitated and fit using previously reported methods (30Ray A.S.

Many combinations of NRTIs and NNRTIs inhibit viral growth synergistically, including AZT and efavirenz, d4T and nevirapine, and (-)3TC and efavirenz (3De Clercq E.

An understanding of this phenomenon improves the quality of treatment for current patients and provides a platform for developing new therapies, but a general mechanism that accounts for this synergy is unknown. In the context of the ability of RT to remove chain terminating nucleoside analogs in the presence of PPi or ATP (11Arion D. Kaushik N. McCormick S. Borkow G. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15908-15917Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 12Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Mian A.M. So A.G. Scott W.A. Mol.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8831-8841Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), previous reports have suggested that NNRTIs may inhibit removal of AZT monophosphate, consequently maintaining chain termination at the primer end (24Borkow G. Arion D. Wainberg M.A. Parniak M.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 259-263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Odriozola L. Cruchaga C. Andreola M. Dolle V. Nguyen C.H. Tarrago-Litvak L.

The role of pyrophosphate in removal is controversial, as our laboratory and others have shown WT RT removes AZTMP with a rate higher than that of AZT-resistant RT at a physiological concentration of pyrophosphate, which argues against PPi-mediated removal as a mechanism of AZT resistance (14Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Tolun A.A. Pfeifer I. So A.G. Mellors J.W. Scott W.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 1540-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 30Ray A.S. Murakami E.

Alternatively, AZT-resistant RT removes AZTMP more rapidly than WT RT at a physiological concentration of ATP (30Ray A.S. Murakami E. Basavapathruni A. Vaccaro J.A. Ulrich D. Chu C.K. Schinazi R.F. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8831-8841Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It has been established that ATP binds directly to RT at a site proximate to the active site (33Sarafianos S.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Das K. Tuske S. Birktoft J.J. Ilankumaran P. Ramesha A.R. Sayer J.M. Jerina D.M. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6614-6624Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) with the γ-phosphate of ATP, acting as a nucleophile, directly attacking the phosphodiester linkage between AZTMP and the primer. The products of this nucleophilic attack are the primer (free to incorporate dNTPs) and the dinucleoside tetraphosphate 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine(5′)-tetraphospho(5′)-adenosine (AZTp4A). Together, these observations would suggest that ATP, and not PPi, acts to mediate AZTMP removal in the context of AZT resistance. We have thus chosen to study only ATP-mediated removal in this work, examining a host of Food and Drug Administration-approved compounds to determine whether a general mechanism of synergy exists. As shown in Fig. 1A, we show that the addition of 10 μm nevirapine or efavirenz inhibits ATP-mediated removal of a wide panel of nucleoside analogs, including AZT, d4T, ddC, (-)3TC, (+)3TC (to study an isomeric effect), and recently approved (-)FTC. These results substantiate the broad ability of RT to remove chain-terminating analogs and that there exist interactions between the polymerase active site and nonnucleoside binding pocket (22Spence R.A. Kati W.M. Anderson K.S. Johnson K.A. Science. 1995; 267: 988-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In all cases, efavirenz inhibited removal more effectively than nevirapine and accordingly parallels the potencies observed in the clinic. The relationship between NNRTI inhibition of nucleotide removal and stereoselectivity was examined by comparing primers chain-terminated with the oxathiolane stereoisomers, (+)3TCMP or (-)3TCMP. In each case, the effects of NNRTI inhibition on the rates of removal for (+)3TC were comparable with that of (-)3TC, showing that there is no stereochemical preference at the site of chain termination. Fig. 1B illustrates the clear inhibition of removal when either nevirapine or efavirenz is added to the assay, in that both the rate and amplitude of AZTMP removal are decreased when an NNRTI is added. It is also interesting to note that in comparing removal by wild-type RT in the absence of NNRTIs, we see that “thymidine (T)” analogs are removed more effectively than the “deoxycytidine (C)” analogs (compare time scale for d4TMP removal versus ddCMP removal, 3 and 6 h, respectively.). In considering the mode of inhibition by which NNRTIs may affect ATP-mediated removal of NRTIs, the nonnucleoside inhibitors may have a direct effect on ATP binding and/or an indirect effect on the chemical step. To further delineate this mechanism, the ATP-mediated removal of AZTMP was followed in the presence of various concentrations of ATP in the absence or presence of a fixed concentration of nevirapine. At a physiological concentration of ATP, 3 μm nevirapine inhibited removal ∼50% (Fig. 2A). Using this fixed concentration of nevirapine, the rate of removal at various ATP concentrations was determined. Fig. 2B shows that the addition of 3 μm nevirapine causes both a change in the rate of chemistry of ATP-mediated removal (krem) (0.0012 versus 0.0007 s-1) and in the Kd (dissociation constant) of ATP (0.83 versus 1.3 mm). The efficiency of removal (defined by krem/Kd) decreases from 0.0014 to 0.00054 mm-1 s-1 (a 2.6-fold change) with the addition of nevirapine. This clearly establishes a molecular communication between the two binding pockets in which binding of an NNRTI affects the polymerase active site and perturbs the action of ATP in mediating chain termination. Earlier studies have established that nonnucleosides affect the active site of RT and incorporation of nucleoside analogs (22Spence R.A. Kati W.M. Anderson K.S. Johnson K.A. Science. 1995; 267: 988-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The current study adds a new dimension for the role of site communication at the enzyme level and in terms of understanding combination therapy. These data also lend further support for the suggestion that a bifunctional inhibitor combining the functionalities of a NRTI and NNRTI could bind very tightly and specifically to RT and could be effective in the treatment of AIDS. In summary, this report provides a mechanistic foundation for NRTIs and NNRTIs in combination therapy, understanding the molecular basis of inhibition and synergy, and offers new insights for designing more potent and selective anti-HIV therapies.

Thrombin, a pro-inflammatory protease that is regulated by the blood coagulation cascade, exerts similar effects depending on cell type. Here we report a new mechanism for cross-talk between sphingolipid metabolism and thrombin generation. Sphingosine and sphinganine, but not ceramide or sphingosine-1-phosphate, down-regulated thrombin generation on platelet surfaces (IC50 = 2.4 and 1.4 μm for sphingosine and sphinganine, respectively) as well as in whole plasma clotting assays. Thrombin generation was also inhibited by glucosylsphingosine, lysosphingomyelin, phytosphingosine, and primary alkylamines with >10 carbons. Acylation of the amino group ablated anticoagulant activities. Factor Va was required for the anticoagulant property of sphingosine because prothrombin activation was inhibited by sphingosine, sphinganine, and stearylamine in the presence but not in the absence of factor Va. Sphingosine did not inhibit thrombin generation when Gla-domainless factor Xa was used in prothrombinase assays, whereas sphingosine inhibited activation of Gla-domainless prothrombin by factor Xa/factor Va in the absence of phospholipids (IC50 = 0.49 μm). Fluorescence spectroscopy studies showed that sphingosine binds to fluorescein-labeled factor Xa and that this interaction required the Gla domain. These results imply that sphingosine disrupts interactions between factor Va and the Gla domain of factor Xa in the prothrombinase complex. Thus, certain sphingolipids may be bioactive lipid mediators of thrombin generation such that certain sphingolipid metabolites may modulate proteases that affect cell growth and death, blood coagulation, and inflammation.

During inflammation, cytokines induce tissue factor on some cell surfaces to activate the coagulation system to generate the multifunctional serine protease, thrombin. Thrombin is one of the key factors in inflammation-inducing cell proliferation as well as blood clotting by forming fibrin (1Coughlin S.R.

Thrombin is generated by the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin on negatively charged phospholipids of cells such as endothelial cell and platelet membranes by the proteolytic activity of the prothrombinase complex composed of factor Xa, factor Va, phospholipids, and Ca2+ (3Mann K.G.

DG-prothrombin was made from purified prothrombin as described previously with some modification (19Lecompte M.F. Dode C. Biochimie (Paris). 1989; 71: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Sphingosine (Sph), glucosylsphingosine (Glc-Sph), trimethyl-Sph, dimethyl-Sph, phyto-ceramide, phyto-Sph, S1P, lysosphingomyelin, and ceramide were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Stearylamine, hexadecylamine, tetradecylamine, dodecylamine, decylamine, octylamine, butylamine, octadecane, diamines (spermidine, putrescine, cadaverine), and lysine, thiamine, and tyramine were from Sigma. Isomers (d-erythro-, d-threo-, l-erythro-, and l-threo) of Sph and sphinganine were purchased from Matreya Inc. (State College, PA). RGDS peptide was obtained from Sigma. Innovin was from DADE, Marburg, Germany. Nα-fluorescein-p benzoyl phenylalanyl-lysyl (Nϵ bromoacetyl) amide (Fl) was prepared as described before (20Yegneswaran S. Fernandez J.A. Griffin J.H. Dawson P.E. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 485-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Diphenyl hexatriene (DPH) was purchased from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). Preparation of Sphingosine and Its Analog Solutions—Sph and related lipids were dissolved in ethanol (stock solution: final 50 mm), and the stock solutions were diluted using Tris-buffed saline (TBS) containing BSA. The diluted lipid solutions contained equimolar amounts of lipid and BSA as carrier. In some experiments, Sph was dissolved directly in TBS in the absence of BSA. Although BSA helped to solubilize Sph in TBS, it had little effect on the assays and Sph behaved similarly in the absence and presence of BSA as carrier protein. The aliphatic side chain of Sph and its derivatives contained 18 carbons unless otherwise noted. Preparation of Washed Platelets—Washed human platelets were obtained from healthy consenting donors by vein puncture. Briefly, six volumes of blood were collected into one volume containing ACD (0.022 mol/liter citrate, 0.014 mol/liter dextrose, final) and prostaglandin E1 (5 μmol/liter, final). The blood was centrifuged for 15 min at 250 × g at room temperature. After collecting platelet-rich plasma (PRP), an additional 5 min of centrifugation was performed to remove any remaining erythrocytes and leukocytes. The PRP was subsequently centrifuged for 15 min at 500 × g, and the platelet pellet was resuspended into a buffer consisting of 10 mm HEPES (pH 6.6), 136 mm NaCl, 2.68 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 25 mm dextrose. Platelets were washed twice with the same buffer and resuspended in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 136 mm NaCl, 2.68 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 25 mm dextrose. Platelet concentration was determined by cell counting (ABX Diagnostics Inc., Irvine, CA). Clotting Assays—The procoagulant and anticoagulant properties of sphingolipids were determined using factor Xa-initiated and thrombin-initiated clotting assays using normal pooled plasma. Briefly, 7.5 μl of plasma was mixed with Sph or analogous compounds at varying doses and fibrinogen (0.6 mg/ml final) and incubated for 3 min at 37 °C (87.5 μl total). After addition of 50 μl of factor Xa (0.9 nm, final) or thrombin (0.43 units/ml, final) containing 30 mm CaCl2, clotting times were measured using an Amelung KC4 micro coagulometer (Sigma). Prothrombinase Assay Using Platelets—Platelets (1.5 × 108/ml) were incubated with thrombin (0.5 units/ml) in the presence of RGDS peptide (0.2 mm) for 10 min at room temperature following inactivation of thrombin by hirdin (0.6 units/ml). Activated platelets were then incubated with factor Xa and Sph or related lipids or buffer for 5 min. Then prothrombin (0.7 μm) was added to the mixture, which also contained 5 mm CaCl2. Aliquots were removed at 30-s intervals, and thrombin generation was quenched by adding EDTA. Thrombin chromogenic substrate, CBS34.47 (Diagnostica Stago, Asnieres, France) (0.4 mm final), was added, and the rate of thrombin formation was monitored with an Optimax microplate reader with Kinetic software SOFTmax® (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Prothrombin Activation by Factor Xa in the Absence of Phospholipids—Prothrombin activation in the absence of phospholipids was determined using either factor Xa alone or factor Xa plus factor Va. In the assay with factor Xa plus factor Va, prothrombin was mixed with various concentrations of sphingosine or its analogs at room temperature for 5 min before addition of factor Xa with or without factor Va. In separate experiments, either DG-prothrombin or DG-factor Xa was used in place of prothrombin or factor Xa following the same general protocol. After detectable thrombin was generated, the prothrombinase reaction was quenched by EDTA, and the rate of thrombin formation was as given above. Factor X Activation by Factor VIIa/Tissue Factor—Factor X (0.63 μm) was activated by factor VIIa (8.35 nm) plus recombinant tissue factor containing phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine (Innovin™ at 1:1000 dilution) with various concentrations of Sph or analogs at room temperature for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by adding EDTA (pH 7.5, 10 mm final). The factor Xa chromogenic substrate, S2222 (Chromogenix, Franklin, OH) (0.33 mm final) was added, and the rate of factor Xa formation was monitored with an Optimax microplate reader. Active Site-directed Labeling of Factor Xa and Gla-domainless Factor Xa with Fluorescein—Factor Xa and DG-factor Xa were labeled specifically in the active site, and fluorescein-labeled factor Xai (Fl-factor Xai) and DG-factor Xai (Fl-DG-factor Xai) were purified from the excess reagents as described (20Yegneswaran S. Fernandez J.A. Griffin J.H. Dawson P.E. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 485-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Spectral Measurement—Steady state fluorescence intensity measurements were performed on a SLM Aminco AB2 luminescence spectrofluorometer (Rochester, NY) at room temperature using 5-mm × 5-mm quartz cuvettes. Fluorescein fluorescence was detected at its excitation and emission maxima of 490 and 525 nm, respectively. Protein absorption to cuvette walls was minimized, and sample mixing was performed as described (20Yegneswaran S. Fernandez J.A. Griffin J.H. Dawson P.E. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 485-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For a typical fluorescence experiment, two samples were prepared in parallel. The sample cuvette (S) received 200 nm Fl-factor Xai in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2, whereas the blank cuvette (B) received 200 nm FPR-factor Xai in the same buffer. The initial net fluorescence intensity, designated (Fo), was obtained by subtracting the signal of the dye-free blank from the S cuvette signal. For the sphingolipid titrations, equal concentrations of sphingolipids from the same stock solution of lipid were added to each cuvette. Lipid stocks were diluted to a maximum of 400-fold. Readings were recorded after a 5-min incubation. Upon addition of sphingolipid, the B cuvette signal typically rose less than 2%. After the signal observed in the B cuvette was subtracted from that of the S cuvette, the net dilution-corrected signal was designated “F”, and fluorescence changes were represented as a ratio of F/Fo for various sphingolipid concentrations. Curve fitting and EC50 determinations were performed as detailed before using GraphPad Prism version 3.0 (20Yegneswaran S. Fernandez J.A. Griffin J.H. Dawson P.E. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 485-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 21Yegneswaran S. Deguchi H. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14614-14621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Critical Micellar Concentration (CMC) Determination—The CMC of Sph in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2 was determined using DPH at room temperature as previously described (21Yegneswaran S. Deguchi H. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14614-14621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The validity of using this assay to determine the CMC of lipids has been well established (21Yegneswaran S. Deguchi H. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14614-14621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 22Koppaka V. Wang J. Banerjee M. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7482-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). DPH fluorescence was monitored at 365 nm excitation and 460 nm emission, respectively. Briefly, two samples were prepared in parallel. The S cuvette received ∼12 μm of DPH dissolved in dimethyl formamide (1 in 400 dilution), whereas the B cuvette received the same amount of dimethyl formamide. Each cuvette then received equal concentrations of Sph. DHP fluorescence was monitored at 365 nm excitation and 460 nm emission, respectively. The net initial emission intensity, termed F0, was obtained by subtracting the initial intensity of the B cuvette from the initial intensity of the S cuvette. Cuvettes S and B then received increasing concentrations of Sph. Relative fluorescence intensity (F/F0) was calculated for expressing the change of fluorescence intensity. F was the net dilution-corrected emission intensity of a sample at a given point in the titration. A plot of F/F0 versus lipid concentration gave two linear slopes, and the Sph concentration at the intercept of the two linear slopes was taken as the CMC of Sph. The CMC of Sph in the presence of 200 nm factor Xai was similarly determined. Effect of Sph and Related Compounds on Prothrombinase Activity on Platelets—Platelet surfaces provide physiological surfaces where thrombin generation and subsequent blood coagulation can occur. At physiologic concentrations, platelets (1.5 × 108/ml) were activated by thrombin and tested for the effects of Sph and related compounds on thrombin generation by factor Xa. Sph, sphinganine, and stearylamine inhibited the prothrombinase activity in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas ceramide and S1P did not (Fig. 1). IC50 values for Sph, sphinganine, and stearylamine were 2.4, 1.4, and 1.7 μm, respectively, showing that inhibition of thrombin generation by Sph and sphinganine occurred at relatively low lipid concentrations. Effect of Sph and Related Compounds on Plasma Clotting Times—To test the effect of Sph and its related products on plasma clotting reactions, factor Xa-induced clotting assays were performed. Sph prolonged factor Xa-dependent clotting times in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 2A). The analogs of Sph (see Table I), dimethyl-Sph, trimethyl-Sph, and phyto-Sph, showed anticoagulant activity similar to Sph in the clotting assays (Fig. 2A). Sphinganine and stearylamine prolonged clotting times more potently than Sph (Fig. 2B). Glc-Sph and lyso-sphingomyelin showed anticoagulant activity, but their potencies were not as great as Sph. Ceramide, phyto-ceramide, and S1P had no significant effects on clotting times (Fig. 2, A and B). Thrombin-induced clotting of plasma (i.e. the thrombin time assay) was not affected by any sphingolipids at the concentrations employed in factor Xa-induced clotting assays (data not shown), indicating Sph and its analogs inhibit activation of prothrombin but not the clotting activity of thrombin on fibrinogen.Table IStructures of sphingolipids Open table in a new tab Sph and sphinganine have two asymmetric carbon atoms (at positions 2 and 3) (Table I) and exist in four stereoisomeric configurations (d-erythro, d-threo, l-erythro, and l-threo). When different isomers of Sph and sphinganine were studied, there were no obvious differences in dose responses among the four stereoisomeric configurations of Sph and sphinganine in anticoagulant activity as measured in clotting assays (data not shown). To characterize the nonspecific charge effect of amino groups, we tested the anticoagulant activity of other amino compounds such as diamines (spermidine, putrescine, cadaverine) or positively charged amines such as lysine, thiamine, tyramine. None of these amino compounds showed anticoagulant properties in factor Xa-1-stage clotting assays when tested at up to 500 μm (data not shown). Effect of Side Chain Length of Primary Alkylamine—To define the effect of the aliphatic side chain length on the anticoagulant activity of primary alklyamines, primary amines with varying saturated chain lengths were assayed in the factor Xa-induced clotting time assay. As shown in Fig. 2B, stearylamine and hexadecylamine, which contain linear chains of 18 and 16 carbons, respectively, prolonged clotting times more significantly than did Sph. The anticoagulant activity of primary alkylamines was reduced in parallel with the decrease of carbon number, and octylamine and butylamine, which contain 8 and 4 carbons, respectively, did not prolong the clotting time (Fig. 2B). The octadecane, which has 18 carbons but no amino group, did not prolong the clotting time (Fig. 2B). Thus, the primary amino moiety and an aliphatic chain length of greater than 8 carbons were required for anticoagulant activity. Effect of Sph and Related Compounds on Prothrombin Activation by Factor Xa in the Absence of Phospholipid—In purified reaction mixtures lacking phospholipids, thrombin generation by factor Xa/factor Va was inhibited by Sph in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 3A). Sphinganine and stearylamine also inhibited thrombin generation with potency similar to Sph, whereas ceramide did not inhibit prothrombin activation. In the absence of factor Va, prothrombin activation by factor Xa was not inhibited by Sph, sphinganine, or stearylamine (data not shown), indicating that factor Va was required for the anticoagulant property of Sph. DG-factor Xa, lacking the N-terminal Gla domain of the enzyme, showed catalytic activity similar to normal factor Xa both on the chromogenic substrate S2222 and in assays of prothrombin activation in the absence of factor Va (data not shown). However, in the presence of factor Va, thrombin generation by DG-factor Xa was about one-thirtieth of that observed for normal factor Xa, reflecting the fact that the Gla domain of factor Xa is required for exerting optimal prothrombinase activity in the absence of phospholipid (Fig. 3B) (23Blostein M.D. Rigby A.C. Jacobs M. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38120-38126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Notably, Sph did not inhibit thrombin generation in the presence of factor Va when DG-factor Xa was used in prothrombinase assays (Fig. 3B). Thus, both the factor Xa Gla domain and factor Va were required for Sph to exert its anticoagulant activity, implying that Sph disrupts interactions between factor Va and the Gla domain of factor Xa. When DG-prothrombin and normal prothrombin were used as substrates for factor Xa in the absence of factor Va, the observed rates of thrombin activation were the same (data not shown). However, when DG-prothrombin was activated by factor Xa plus factor Va, the rate of thrombin generation was approximately a third of the rate observed when normal prothrombin was the substrate (Fig. 3C), suggesting the importance of prothrombin Gla domain interactions with factor Va as described previously (23Blostein M.D. Rigby A.C. Jacobs M. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38120-38126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Sph inhibited thrombin generation when DG-prothrombin was the substrate for factor Xa in the presence of factor Va in the absence of phospholipids (IC50 = 0.49 μm) (Fig. 3C), consistent with the hypothesis that Sph does not interfere with interactions between factor Va and the Gla domain of prothrombin. Factor X Activation by Factor VIIa/Tissue Factor—The ability of Sph to inhibit Factor Xa generation was also studied. Sph inhibited in a dose-dependent manner factor X activation by factor VIIa/tissue factor/phospholipid vesicles with ∼30% inhibition observed at 15 μm lipid (Fig. 3D). Sphinganine and stearylamine inhibited factor X activation by factor VIIa/tissue factor more efficiently than did Sph, giving 60 and 80% inhibition at 15 μm lipid (Fig. 3D). It is noteworthy that the potency of Sph to inhibit factor Xa generation was at least an order of magnitude weaker than its potency to inhibit thrombin generation. CMC of Sph—DHP is an aggregation-sensitive fluorescence probe and exhibits minimal fluorescence in aqueous solution but displays significant fluorescence when it binds to a water membrane interface. This property was used to determine the CMC of Sph in the absence or presence of 200 nm factor Xai. When Sph was added at room temperature to a buffer solution containing DHP in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2, a modest concentration-dependent increase in DPH fluorescence was observed below the CMC with a steeper increase above the CMC (Fig. 4). Based on the inflection point, the CMC of Sph under this condition was 112 μm (Fig. 4), showing Sph exists as a monomer in the solution conditions of our experiments. In the presence of 200 nm factor Xai, the CMC of Sph was similar to that in the absence of factor Xai (Fig. 4). Therefore, factor Xai did not nucleate the formation of Sph micelles at our experimental conditions. Further, we concluded that because the CMC of Sph is ∼100-fold higher than the Sph IC50 in functional assays (∼1 μm) (Fig. 3A), Sph micelles presumably do not account for the anticoagulant function in the prothrombinase assays. Binding of Sph to Factor Xa—To assess whether Sph can directly bind to factor Xa, we performed binding assays using Fl-factor Xai. When Fl-factor Xai was titrated with Sph, the fluorescence emission intensity of fluorescein decreased and reached a plateau value at F/F0 of 0.67 at ∼48 μm Sph with an EC50 of ∼16 μm (Fig. 5). The signal change was not affected by the addition of EDTA, suggesting the binding of Sph to factor Xa is not Ca2+-dependent (data not shown). Octylamine, which is functionally inactive as an anticoagulant, did not cause a significant decrease of fluorescence emission intensity (data not shown). Because Sph did not inhibit the activity of DG-factor Xa to activate prothrombin (Fig. 3B), Fl-DG-factor Xai was also titrated with Sph. No change in fluorescein fluorescence was observed upon titration of Fl-DG-factor Xa with Sph (Fig. 5). Thus, the spectroscopic data for the effects of Sph on fluorescein-labeled factor Xa were in agreement with the functional data in suggesting that Sph binds specifically to factor Xa via the Gla domain to exert its inhibitory effect on the prothrombinase complex. Here we report that thrombin generation can be down-regulated by certain sphingolipids. Sph, the intermediate sphingolipid metabolite between ceramide and S1P, potently blocked thrombin generation in a physiologic setting, i.e. on platelet surfaces. Sph was reported to down-regulate thrombin generation on bovine pulmonary endothelial cells, although the mechanism for inhibition of thrombin generation was unclear (24Tanabe S. Tamaki T. Wada Y. Thromb. Res. 1992; 67: 115-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Based on our data, the ability of Sph to inhibit potently and directly thrombin generation extends to reaction mixtures containing purified clotting factors (see below). The strong inhibitory effect of Sph raises the question of whether Sph may exert anticoagulant effects in vivo as well as in vitro. Because physiological concentrations of Sph range from 100 nm in plasma to 260 nm in serum (25van der Westhuizen L. Brown N.L. Marasas W.F. Swanevelder S. Shephard G.S. Food Chem. Toxicol. 1999; 37: 1153-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26Castegnaro M. Garren L. Galendo D. Gelderblom W.C. Chelule P. Dutton M.F. Wild C.P. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Sci. Appl. 1998; 720: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and because Sph that is locally generated could achieve much higher levels, we speculate that Sph anticoagulant activity could potentially be physiologic. The structural properties of the sphingoid base (e.g. chain length, presence of double bonds, steric configuration of functional groups, and the role of hydroxyl or amino groups) were studied for their functional implications for anticoagulant activity. Sphinganine (dihydrosphingosine) and stearylamine, a simple aliphatic primary amine, also showed potent anticoagulant ability in plasma"

Thus, the role for glutamine in the regulation of inflammatory mediators of human neutrophil activation was investigated. The study sought to establish whether glutamine supplementation in vitro affects neutrophil function at rest and whether glutaminase, the major enzyme that metabolizes glutamine, is present in human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN). During in vitro studies, the addition of 2 mm glutamine increased the respiratory burst of human PMN stimulated with both phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. These observations were made using a highly sensitive, real time chemiluminescent probe, Pholasin®. Glutamine alone did not stimulate the release of reactive oxygen species. In a novel finding using glutaminase-specific antibodies in combination with flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, glutaminase was shown to be present on the surface of human PMN. Subcellular fractionation revealed that the enzyme was enriched in the secondary granules and could be released into cell culture medium upon stimulation with PMA. In conclusion, human PMN appeared to utilize glutamine and possess the appropriate glutaminase enzyme for metabolizing glutamine. This may depress some pro-inflammatory factors that occur during prolonged, exhaustive exercise.

Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) 1The abbreviations used are: PMN, polymorphonuclear neutrophils; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; fMLP, formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine; GA, glutaminase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IL, interleukin; LGA, liver-type GA; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate; PVDF, polyvinylidene fluoride; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TBS, Tris-buffered saline. are a major class of the nonspecific immune response against infections. This is due, in part, to their ability to produce toxic forms of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including superoxide anions (O2–), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxyl radicals (OH–). The generation of ROS requires the cytosolic NADPH oxidase proteins to form a complex with several of the membrane-bound parts of the oxidases. Once assembled, direct stimulation of cells results in the release of O2·¯ into the extracellular compartment or into phagosomes. In turn, activated PMN synthesize and release a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 (1Cassatella M.A. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 21-26Google Scholar, 2Eggleton P. Anticancer Res. 1999; 19: 3711-3715Google Scholar). Recent work has shown that glutamine supplementation in vitro enhances both phagocytosis and ROS in isolated PMN (3Furukawa S. Saito H. Inoue T. Matsuda T. Fukatsu K. Han I. Ikeda S. Hidemura A. Nutrition. 2000; 16: 323-329Google Scholar) and, in vivo, suppresses IL-8 production by PMN (4Castell L. Sports Med. 2003; 33: 323-345Google Scholar). This has important consequences, as glutamine appears to exert a regulatory influence on inflammatory processes by PMN responding to inflammatory and infectious stimuli. For example, PMNs taken from patients with burns (5Ogle C.K. Ogle J.D. Mao J.X. Simon J. Noel J.G. Li B.G. Alexander J.W. J. Parenter. Enteral Nutr. 1994; 18: 128-133Google Scholar) or after surgery (6Furukawa S. Saito H. Fukatsu K. Hashiguchi Y. Inaba T. Lin M.T. Inoue T. Han I. Matsuda T. Muto T. Nutrition. 1997; 13: 863-869Google Scholar) have been shown to have improved bactericidal activity in vitro when glutamine is added to the culture medium for incubation. Glutamine is an important substrate for some key cells of the immune system, such as macrophages and lymphocytes (7Ardawi M.S. Newsholme E.A. Essays Biochem. 1985; 21: 1-44Google Scholar, 8Newsholme P. Newsholme E.A. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 211-218Google Scholar). It acts as a nitrogen donor for purine and pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis for new DNA synthesis and for mRNA repair. Although classified as non-essential, recent evidence suggests that glutamine is conditionally essential when it becomes rapidly depleted in the blood in stressful situations. Plasma glutamine concentrations are substantially decreased by clinical trauma such as in major surgery by 37% (9Powell H. Castell L.M. Parry-Billings M. Desborough J.P. Hall G.M. Newsholme E.A. Clin. Physiol. 1994; 14: 569-580Google Scholar) or after prolonged, exhaustive exercise by 20–25% (10Castell L.M. Poortmans J.R. Newsholme E.A. Eur. J. Appl. Physiol. Occup. Physiol. 1996; 73: 488-490Google Scholar). The provision of glutamine or glutamine precursors to endurance athletes has resulted in a decreased self-reported incidence of illness, particularly for upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), in four studies (see Castell, 2003; Ref. 4Castell L. Sports Med. 2003; 33: 323-345Google Scholar). Increasing evidence, in vitro and in vivo, suggests that PMN may benefit from exogenous glutamine, which repletes the decrease in the blood concentration observed after stress. The energy substrate for PMN has traditionally been thought to be glucose. However, it is possible that PMN could use glutamine, particularly in cases such as severe infection in which glucose is restricted. Evidence for a direct effect of glutamine on neutrophil function has been demonstrated in rats, where it was shown that isolated PMN utilized glutamine at a rate of 12.8 nmol min–1 mg–1 protein (11Curi T.C. De Melo M.P. De Azevedo R.B. Zorn T.M. Curi R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1124-C1129Google Scholar) in the absence of glucose. The same workers further confirmed the presence of phosphate-dependent glutaminase (GA) in rat PMN using Western blots and immunocytochemistry methods. To date, the presence of GA in human PMN has not been demonstrated, despite several attempts to do so. Strenuous exercise stimulates leukocytosis and neutrophilia (12McCarthy D.A. Dale M.M.

Res. 1902; 2: 76-82Google Scholar) and the release of immature PMN from bone marrow (15Hansen J.B. Wilsgard L. Osterud B. Eur. J. Appl. Physiol. Occup.

Physiol. 2000; 81: 281-287Google Scholar). However, there are conflicting reports upon the effects of exercise on ROS release by PMN (17Suzuki K. Sato H. Kikuchi T. Abe T. Nakaji S. Sugawara K. Totsuka M. Sato K. Yamaya K. J. Appl. Physiol. 1996; 81: 1213-1222Google Scholar). Significant increases have been observed in the plasma concentration of IL-8 (∼2-fold) immediately after and 1.5 h after a marathon (18Nieman D.C. Henson D.A. Smith L.L. Utter A.C. Vinci D.M. Davis J.M. Kaminsky D.E. Shute M. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 109-114Google Scholar) and in cell IL-8 production after a rowing ergo test (19Castell L.M. The Role of Some Amino Acids in Exercise, Fatigue, and Immunosuppression. University of Oxford, Oxford1996Google Scholar). This suggests enhanced post-exercise activation of PMN. Significant decreases in post-exercise neutrophilia (∼1.75-fold) and cell IL-8 production (∼3.5-fold) have been observed after a marathon in runners taking glutamine compared with a placebo (20Castell L.M. Newsholme E.A. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1998; 76: 524-532Google Scholar). Since then, in three further studies in our laboratory, a reduction in IL-8 associated with glutamine feeding after exercise has been observed (see Castell, 2003; Ref. 4Castell L.

Nutrition. 1996; 12: S82-S84Google Scholar) established that IL-8 production was reduced in both surgical patients and patients with acute pancreatitis who received glutamine-enriched parenteral nutrition. IL-8 is a potent chemoattractant that perpetuates the inflammatory response and attracts PMN to the site of tissue damage. The present study was set up to establish whether glutamine supplementation affects human neutrophil respiratory burst via in vitro incubation of blood with/without glutamine and to determine whether human PMN utilizes glutamine via the presence of GA, using both immunochemical techniques and confocal microscopy. Subjects and Blood Samples—Ethical permission for the studies was obtained from the Central Oxford Research Ethics Committee (COREC). Resting blood samples were taken from healthy controls recruited from colleagues. Neutrophil function was measured with a novel chemiluminescence assay as described below. Isolation of PMN—Isolated whole cells and subcellular neutrophil fractions were assayed for the presence of glutaminase. Neutrophils were isolated as described previously (23Eggleton P. Wang L. Penhallow J. Crawford N. Brown K.A. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1995; 54: 916-923Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 ml of anticoagulated (potassium EDTA, 1.5 mg/ml) blood was layered on top of 4 ml of PolymorphPrep™ (Nycomed Pharma AS) in a 15-ml conical tube that was then spun at 1000 × g for 45 min. The layer of PMN was removed using a Pasteur pipette and placed with an equal volume of hypertonic sodium chloride solution (0.45% w/v) in another 15-ml tube to reduce viscosity. Following another spin, the supernatant was aspirated and the pellet resuspended in lysis buffer (isotonic NH4Cl) and spun again. The pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline without calcium or magnesium (PBS2–), and the cells were counted and checked for viability by the exclusion of 0.02% (v/v) trypan blue and stored at 4 °C until required. Subcellular Fractionation of PMN—Subcellular fractionation of human PMN by nitrogen cavitation is an established technique for elucidating PMN structural composition (24Kjeldsen L. Sengelov H. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 232: 131-143Google Scholar). Briefly, freshly isolated, unstimulated PMN (2 × 108 per condition) were resuspended in 5 ml of nitrogen cavitation buffer (0.34 m sucrose, 10 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm Na2ATP, pH 7.4), followed by lysis by nitrogen cavitation (15 min, 400 p.s.i.) (4 °C). The lysates were centrifuged (1000 × g), and supernatants were then subjected to isopycnic sucrose density gradient fractionation on linear 20–55% sucrose gradients in a Beckman SW-28 swinging bucket rotor (100,000 × g; 3 h, 4 °C) exactly as described previously. 1.5-ml fractions were collected from each gradient and analyzed for marker proteins, plasma membrane (alkaline phosphatase), primary granules (myeloperoxidase), and secondary granules (lactoferrin) as described previously (25Wirthmueller U. Dewald B. Thelen M. Schafer M.K. Stover C. Whaley K. North J. Eggleton P. Reid K.B. Schwaeble W.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4444-4451Google Scholar). Whole Blood Neutrophil Oxidative Burst Measurement with and without Glutamine, Using a Microplate Luminometer—The novel chemiluminescent method is designed to analyze the oxidative burst in real time by emitted light (ABEL®, Knight Scientific Ltd, Plymouth, United Kingdom). This technique uses the photoprotein Pholasin®, which is isolated from the marine, rock-boring, bioluminescent mollusc Pholas dactylus, the common piddock. Pholasin® only emits light when activated by free radicals and other reactive oxygen species such as those released by activated leukocytes. Whole blood was diluted 1:10 in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) with or without glutamine (final concentration 2 mm) and with antibiotics (1:1000 dilution of streptomycin and penicillin). After incubating for 3 h at 37 °C with continuous shaking, the blood was assayed for PMN activity using the chemiluminescence assay and measuring with the Anthos Lucy 1 luminometer (Labtech, Uckfield, United Kingdom) as outlined below. Aliquots (20 μl) were further diluted in 2 ml of blood dilution buffer (Hanks' buffered saline plus 20 mm HEPES). Using an opaque, white, 96-well plate, 90 μl of reconstitution and assay buffer was added to each well, together with 20 μl of Adjuvant-K to enhance the luminescence, 50 μl of Pholasin®, and 20 μl of diluted whole blood. The cells were stimulated by the addition of 20 μl of either formyl-methionyl-leucylphenylalanine (fMLP) (final concentration 1 μm) or PMA (final concentration 0.16 μm), and the response was measured until the reaction had passed (5 min with fMLP and 30 min with PMA) using a microplate luminometer (Anthos Lucy 1). Production of Anti-GST-LGA347–602 Antibodies—An EcoRI-XhoI fragment containing nucleotides 1074–1909 of the human liver-type GA (LGA) cloned from ZR-75 breast cancer cells (26Gomez-Fabre P.M. Aledo J.C. Del Castillo-Olivares A. Alonso F.J. Nunez De Castro I. Campos J.A. Marquez J. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 365-375Google Scholar) was PCR-amplified and ligated in-frame in the EcoRI/XhoI site of expression vector pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences). This fragment, encoding for the amino acids 347–602 of the C-terminal half of human LGA, was expressed in Escherichia coli as a GST fusion protein (GST-GA347–602). Protein expression and affinity purification were performed as described previously (26Gomez-Fabre P.M. Aledo J.C. Del Castillo-Olivares A. Alonso F.J. Nunez De Castro I. Campos J.A. Marquez J. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 365-375Google Scholar) using a glutathione-Sepharose affinity column. The purified recombinant protein was used for hyperimmunization of New Zealand White rabbits, and polyclonal antibodies were generated as described elsewhere (27Segura J.A. Aledo J.C. Gomez-Biedma S. Nunez de Castro I. Marquez J. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 343-351Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Western Blot of Glutaminase—Approximately 40 μg of neutrophil membrane sub-fractions, prepared by nitrogen cavitation as described previously (25Wirthmueller U. Dewald B. Thelen M. Schafer M.K. Stover C. Whaley K. North J. Eggleton P. Reid K.B. Schwaeble W.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4444-4451Google Scholar), were suspended in sample buffer (62 mmol/liter Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue with 5% 2-mercaptoethanol), incubated for 5 min at 100 °C, and then applied to lanes of a 12% polyacrylamide mini-gel; electrophoresis was performed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) at a constant current of 60 mA for 2 h. Molecular weight standards (Bio-Rad) were run simultaneously. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and dried. A parallel SDS-PAGE gel was run as above, and the separated proteins were transferred directly by semi-dry blotting onto polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF) transfer membrane for 90 min at a constant current of 0.8 mA. After saturation of the nonspecific sites with 5% nonfat milk-TBS overnight, the proteins were probed with a 1:200 dilution of rabbit anti-human glutaminase antibody prepared as described below. The blot was then washed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.14 mm NaCl containing 0.4% Tween 20 (TBS-Tween) and then incubated for 1 h in an anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated IgG antibody diluted 1:1000 in TBS-Tween; the immunoblot was exposed to an ECL immunoassay substrate reagent (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 min to detect any signal, and then the membrane was exposed to x-ray film for 5 min. Flow Cytometry and Confocal Microscopy—Detection of GA on the surface of human PMN was achieved using both flow cytometry and a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (Zeiss Axiostar) and an Image Analysis work station. PMNs were incubated with 1:50 diluted rabbit anti-human glutaminase for 30 min, and, after three washes in PBS2–, the cells were incubated with 1:50 goat-anti rabbit-FITC-conjugated IgG for 30 min at 4 °C and then washed three times in PBS2–. In the flow cytometry studies, the PMNs were stimulated with either 0.16 μm (100 ng/ml) PMA or 0.1 μm fMLP or left in phosphate-buffered saline with calcium and magnesium (PBS2+) for 30 min at 37 °C before probing with test antibodies. The cells were then either fixed in 2% (v/v) paraformaldehyde and analyzed on a BD Biosciences FACScan or spun onto microscope slides at 500 rpm in a Cytospin centrifuge (Shandon Southern Instruments), and cover slips were mounted over the slides using an anti-quenching reagent Citifluor (Citifluor UK Chemical Lab, Canterbury, United Kingdom) and sealed with nail polish. The cells were viewed on the Zeiss microscope fitted with a confocal argon-krypton mixed gas laser. Images were taken serially from the top to the bottom of each cell using a z plane motorized sub-stage. The appropriate excitation and emission filters for FITC were employed. Several data sets were collected for each experiment. Statistical Analysis—Results were compared using non-parametric analysis with Wilcoxon paired t tests. Real Time Oxidative Response of Stimulated Leukocytes in the Presence of Glutamine—Whole blood leukocytes from healthy control individuals stimulated with PMA (final concentration 0.16 μm) and fMLP (final concentration 1 μm) were incubated with the highly sensitive real time chemiluminescence probe Pholasin® to examine ROS release in the presence and absence of glutamine. Four of six samples gave an increased response (39.2%) to fMLP when incubated with glutamine compared with no glutamine. In the fMLP experiments there were two individuals who did not respond to the addition of glutamine. However, the response was not diminished whether or not glutamine was present. In a separate group, four of four samples gave an increased response to PMA (31.1%) (Fig. 1). Glutamine stimulated the oxidative burst from PMA-stimulated cells ∼2-fold without affecting the speed of response (Fig 1A). However, fMLP-stimulated cells (Fig. 1B) increased both the speed of response and the oxidative burst in the presence of glutamine. Detection of Glutaminase on the Surface of Human PMN— The observation that glutamine had a pro-stimulatory effect on oxidative burst from leukocytes prompted us to examine whether human PMN, as the predominant generator of superoxide, possessed the glutamine-metabolizing enzyme GA on its cell surface. Intact PMNs were isolated as described above and assessed for the presence of GA by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 2a, resting cells appeared as two populations of cells (denoted M1 and M2) with respect to surface GA. Approximately 44% of PMN had very little surface GA mean fluorescence intensity (MFI = 8.4), whereas 56% of the cells were highly stained for GA (MFI = 100). Nonspecific staining accounted for an MFI of 4.8. Treatment of the cells with PMA led to loss of surface GA and the loss of highly stained GA populations of cells (Fig 2b). In contrast, fMLP had very little effect on surface GA levels in the two populations, M1 and M2 (Fig 2c). Imaging the surface of PMN in 0.5 micron sections labeled with FITC-anti-GA (Fig. 3) showed that the GA was on or near the cell surface and could be detected 3–3.5 microns into the cell surface but, most intensely, at the surface of the cell.Fig. 3Localization of glutaminase at the ruffled cell surface of human neutrophils. a, confocal microscopic images of isolated neutrophils were taken consecutively from the top of the cell every 0.5 μm below the surface level (z plane) and show that the glutaminase is distributed over the pseudopodia of the cells, which appears to extend ∼3.5 μm deep. b, transmission electron microscope image of neutrophils displaying pseudopodia.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Secretion of Glutaminase—A number of human cells, including liver and kidney, have been reported to produce GA, but to date GA has not been identified in human PMN. To investigate if the source of the GA came from the PMNs themselves, we stimulated the cells with PMA (100 ng/ml) and fMLP for 30 min. The PBS in which 5 × 106 cells had been incubated were collected and concentrated to 100 μl volumes. Then, 50 μl aliquots of these were loaded on a 12% v/v SDS-PAGE gel, together with purified GA, and immunoblotted onto PVDF membranes and probed with rabbit anti-human glutaminase polyclonal antisera. As shown in Fig. 2d, Western blot analysis revealed that the cell-free supernatants from cells that had been treated with PMA contained GA. In contrast, supernatants from resting cells and fMLP-treated cells contained no GA as probed by immunoblotting. The presence of GA in the cell media suggested that it might be secreted from the cells. Thus, it was next decided to examine neutrophil subfractions, which had been prepared previously by nitrogen cavitation into four main fractions, namely primary granules (α), secondary granules (β), endoplasmic and plasma membrane-enriched fraction (γ), and cell supernatant (S). The protein profiles of these four fractions are shown in Fig 4a, and the immunoblot of these protein fractions (Fig 4b) reveal that a protein 65–70 kDa was detected in the secondary granules but not in any of the other purified subcellular fractions. The fact that lymphocytes and macrophages use high rates of glutamine has been known for a number of years (7Ardawi M.S. Newsholme E.A. Essays Biochem. 1985; 21: 1-44Google Scholar, 8Newsholme P. Newsholme E.A. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 211-218Google Scholar). More recent observations have provided evidence that glutamine is also utilized by rat PMN (28Pithon-Curi T.C. Trezena A.G. Tavares-Lima W. Curi R. Cell Biochem. Funct. 2002; 20: 81-86Google Scholar). Blannin et al. (42Blannin A.K. Walsh N.P. Clark A.M. Gleeson M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 506: 121PGoogle Scholar) observed no uptake of glutamine by human neutrophils stimulated in vitro with lipopolysaccharide. More recently (43Healy D.A. Watson R.W.G. Newsholme P. Clin. Sci. 2002; 103: 179-189Google Scholar), Healy et al. reported glutamine utilization by human neutrophils (apparent Km 1.29 mm). The ability of glutamine metabolism to enhance the bacterial function of PMN has been investigated in burn patients (5Ogle C.K. Ogle J.D. Mao J.X. Simon J. Noel J.G. Li B.G. Alexander J.W. J. Parenter. Enteral Nutr. 1994; 18: 128-133Google Scholar) and postoperative individuals (3Furukawa S. Saito H. Inoue T. Matsuda T. Fukatsu K. Han I. Ikeda S. Hidemura A. Nutrition. 2000; 16: 323-329Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of the production of enhanced reactive oxygen intermediates by glutamine is only just being characterized. Recent data suggest that glutamine can increase the expression of some of the proteins that together form the NADPH oxidase components, which, in turn, regulate the production of the superoxide anion (29Pithon-Curi T.C. Levada A.C. Lopes L.R. Doi S.Q. Curi R. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 2002; 103: 403-408Google Scholar). In particular, glutamine appears to increase the expression of the cytosolic protein gp47phox as well as the membrane-associated components and NADPH oxidases p22phox and p47phox. Moreover, blocking glutamine metabolism by inhibiting GA in PMN causes a significant decrease in superoxide production. Therefore, the presence and subcellular location of glutamine appears to be important for glutamine-dependent superoxide production by PMN. In the present study, the results obtained support the notion that glutamine can enhance oxidative burst by human PMN in the presence of phorbol esters and formyl tripeptide stimulants. These data were achieved using a real time in vitro assay of oxidative burst. The supplementation of whole blood leukocytes with 2 mm glutamine not only led to a greater production of superoxide but also increased the initial rate of activation. GA activity has been reported in rat PMN (28Pithon-Curi T.C. Trezena A.G. Tavares-Lima W. Curi R. Cell Biochem. Funct. 2002; 20: 81-86Google Scholar), and numerous studies have detected GA in human tumor cells (30Knox W.E. Tremblay G.C. Spanier B.B. Friedell G.H. Cancer Res. 1967; 27: 1456-1458Google Scholar, 31Turner A. McGivan J.D. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 403-408Google Scholar), where GA is an essential requirement for cell growth. In vitro data from oxidative burst measurements in culture medium, with or without glutamine used to incubate whole blood samples from marathon runners, suggested a role for glutamine and glutaminase in neutrophil metabolism during inflammation. However, during inflammation, phagosomes only fuse with the extracellular matrix at the cytosolic and membrane components, and the NADPH oxidase pathway translocates to form the complex upon alteration. Therefore, if glutamine plays a role in O2·¯ production, one might expect to find GA in a similar location. The present results indicate that GA is present on the surface of cells and is released into the medium upon PMA, but not fMLP, stimulation. In the present investigation, more precise information was obtained on the localization of GA by employing confocal microscopy. By generating 0.5 μm optical sections through individual PMN, it was observed that GA was distributed 0–3.5 μm into the cell surface. PMNs are ruffled cells, and the GA appeared to be predominantly localized in pseudo lamellipodia at or near the plasma membrane. In an initial study, little or no evidence of the presence of GA in human PMN was found using three different methods, namely freeze-thaw, homogenization, and nebulization. None of these techniques was apparently able to break open the granules. Consequently, to determine in more detail the subcellular source of glutamine in human PMN, other techniques were employed. Nitrogen cavitation and discontinuous Percoll density gradient centrifugation provided a simple and rapid means of separating azurophil granules (α), specific granules (β), and plasma membrane (γ) vesicles, as well as a cytoplasm fraction. GA was detected in the secondary granules but, surprisingly, not in the plasma membrane fractions. Our data suggest that, in intact PMN, GA is secreted from the secondary granules and binds to the cell surface. Following PMA but not fMLP stimulation, the GA is removed from the membrane fractions and can be found in the extracellular culture medium. It seems that, as granules fuse with the plasma membrane at the sites of developing phagosomes, the NADPH oxidase and GA enzymes would be in close proximity to the plasma membrane in response to stimulation. This would bring them into close contact with their target substrates. Interestingly, a number of groups have recently identified isoforms of glutaminase in human tumor cell lines at the mRNA and protein level (31Turner A. McGivan J.D. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 403-408Google Scholar) and in mammalian brain cells (32Olalla L. Gutierrez A. Campos J.A. Khan Z.U. Alonso F.J. Segura J.A. Marquez J. Aledo J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38939-38944Google Scholar). In the present study, treatment of human PMN with PMA, a degranulating agent, resulted in the release of glutaminase from the cell surface into cell culture media. However, three bands were recognized by the polyclonal anti-glutaminase antibody. This is consistent with the results of previous investigators that revealed limited proteolytic digestion of isoforms of GA (33Hunt J.F. Erwin E. Palmer L. Vaughan J. Malhotra N. Platts-Mills T.A. Gaston B. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 165: 101-107Google Scholar). When intact secondary granules were subsequently examined by Western blotting, a single non-proteolytic glutaminase band of ∼65 kDa was observed and compared favorably with that found for rat neutrophil GA, which is ∼65 kDa (11Curi T.C. De Melo M.P. De Azevedo R.B. Zorn T.M. Curi R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1124-C1129Google Scholar). Somewhat surprisingly, although a marked increase in glutaminase expression in human neutrophils on the cell surface occurred following stimulation with PMA, there was no change in expression after stimulation with fMLP. Both fMLP and PMA are well known proinflammatory agonists that activate protein kinase C (PKC) by different cellular pathways. fMLP activates PKC indirectly via interactions with surface fMLP receptors and G-protein activation and subsequent inositol phosphate hydrolysis. The phorbol ester PMA, on the other hand, passes directly through the cell membrane and mimics diacylglycerol, a natural ligand and activator of protein kinase C. Both of these agonists can activate the release of various enzymes and inflammatory mediators into the extracellular fluid of stimulated cells. In this study, the source of glutaminase appears to be located in the secondary granules of leukocytes and expressed on the cell surface, where it is available for glutamine metabolism. The origin of the PMA-induced change observed might be distal to the stage of PKC activation in the process that results in glutaminase-containing vesicles moving toward and fusing with the plasma membrane. Differences in PKC activity and translocation have been reported previously (34Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Google Scholar). Alternatively, PMA can activate intracellular enzymes other than PKC, which may explain the release of glutaminase by PMA as compared with fMLP (35Searl T.J. Silinsky E.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 247-251Google Scholar). Further studies will be necessary to elucidate the cause of this difference. There is an increase in the plasma concentration of neutrophil granule contents after strenuous exercise (36Dufaux B. Order U. Int. J. Sports Med. 1989; 10: 434-438Google Scholar). Large numbers of PMN are produced by bone marrow on a daily basis in healthy humans (37Cannistra S.A. Griffin J.D. Semin. Hematol. 1988; 25: 173-188Google Scholar). It is possible that this rapid turnover relates to constant immunosurveillance as the PMN pass through the capillary bed. In these circumstances, glutamine utilization might play an important role in maintaining these cells in a constant state of “awareness.” PMN also contain large reserves of the endogenous antioxidant glutathione (38Voetman A.A. Loos J.A. Roos D. Blood. 1980; 55: 741-747Google Scholar), for which glutamine is a precursor. The fact that in vivo glutamine feeding has affected cell production of IL-8 in several in vitro studies is clearly important. IL-8 acts as a potent chemoattractant for PMNs and induces them to leave the blood stream and migrate into damaged or infected tissue. IL-8 also activates NADPH oxidase and nitric oxide synthase, which, in turn, causes the release of ROS from PMN granules. Results from recent studies suggest that glutamine has a modulating effect on IL-8 cytokine production in various cell types during activation by inflammatory mediators (4Castell L. Sports Med. 2003; 33: 323-345Google Scholar, 21de Beaux A.C. O'Riordain M.G. Ross J.A. Jodozi L. Carter D.C. Fearon K.C. Nutrition. 1998; 14: 261-265Google Scholar, 22O'Riordain M.G. De Beaux A. Fearon K.C. Nutrition. 1996; 12: S82-S84Google Scholar, 39Coeffier M. Marion R. Ducrotte P. Dechelotte P. Clin. Nutr. 2003; 22: 407-413Google Scholar, 40Huang Y. Li N. Liboni K. Neu J.

The signaling of this neutrophil chemoattractant might be diminished because of the effect of additional glutamine in the blood upon circulating mature or immature PMN. Increased numbers of the latter are recruited during the leukocytosis that occurs in response to strenuous exercise. However, glutamine supplementation has been shown to help reduce the number of circulating PMNs to near normal levels compared with a placebo 16 h after a race (20Castell L.M. Newsholme E.A. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1998; 76: 524-532Google Scholar). The mechanism of glutamine-mediated regulation of IL-8 production by peripheral blood mononucleocytes is not yet known. It could reflect changes in cell receptor signaling, transcription, and/or translation expression by modulatory anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 (39Coeffier M. Marion R. Ducrotte P. Dechelotte P. Clin. Nutr. 2003; 22: 407-413Google Scholar). In conclusion, the present study suggests that glutamine supplementation might enhance the respiratory burst of human PMN to specific inflammatory stimuli in vitro. Moreover, the novel finding has been made that there is a sub-cellular source of GA, the major enzyme responsible for glutamine metabolism, in the secretory granules of human PMN. This is likely to contribute to the modulation of immune function of PMN in clinical and exercise-induced stress.

https://openalex.org/W2129428538,"Glucose is the main physiological stimulus for insulin biosynthesis and secretion by pancreatic β-cells. Glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase) catalyzes the dephosphorylation of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose, an opposite process to glucose utilization. G-6-Pase activity in pancreatic islets could therefore be an important factor in the control of glucose metabolism and, consequently, of glucose-dependent insulin secretion. While G-6-Pase activity has been shown to be present in pancreatic islets, the gene responsible for this activity has not been conclusively identified. A homolog of liver glucose-6-phosphatase (LG-6-Pase) specifically expressed in islets was described earlier; however, the authors could not demonstrate enzymatic activity for this protein. Here we present evidence that the previously identified islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase-related protein (IGRP) is indeed the major islet glucose-6-phosphatase. IGRP overexpressed in insect cells possesses enzymatic activity comparable to the previously described G-6-Pase activity in islets. The Km and Vmax values determined using glucose-6-phosphate as the substrate were 0.45 mm and 32 nmol/mg/min by malachite green assay, and 0.29 mm and 77 nmol/mg/min by glucose oxidase/peroxidase coupling assay, respectively. High-throughput screening of a small molecule library led to the identification of an active compound that specifically inhibits IGRP enzymatic activity. Interestingly, this inhibitor did not affect LG-6-Pase activity, while conversely LG-6-Pase inhibitors did not affect IGRP activity. These data demonstrate that IGRP is likely the authentic islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit, and selective inhibitors to this molecule can be obtained.

In pancreatic β-cells, glucose is the primary physiological stimulus for insulin synthesis and secretion. Phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate is essential for glucose-dependent insulin secretion, triggering an increase of the ATP: ADP ratio, inhibition of ATP-sensitive K+ channels, depolarization of β-cell membranes, activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, increase of intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, and release of insulin from β-cells (1Matschinsky F.M.

EC 3.1.3.9) catalyzes the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose. Thus, G-6-Pase activity could potentially antagonize the signaling cascade that leads to insulin secretion. Indeed, stable overexpression of the liver G-6-Pase catalytic subunit was shown to attenuate glucose sensitivity of insulin secretion from a mouse pancreatic β-cell line, MIN6 (5Iizuka K. Nakajima H. Ono A. Okita K. Miyazaki J. Miyagawa J. Namba M. Hanafusa T. Matsuzawa Y. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 164: 307-314Google Scholar). In addition, islets from ob/ob mice, a genetic obese/diabetic model, showed dramatically increased rates of glucose/Glc-6-P cycling and glucose-6-phosphatase activity when compared with islets from wild-type control mice (6Khan A. Chandramouli V. Ostenson C.G. Ahren B. Schumann W.C. Low H. Landau B.R. Efendic S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9732-9734Google Scholar). Similar results have also been obtained in other rodent hyperglycemia models (7Khan A. Chandramouli V. Ostenson C.G. Low H. Landau B.R. Efendic S Diabetes. 1990; 39: 456-459Google Scholar, 8Ostenson C.G. Khan A. Abdel-Halim S.M. Guenifi A. Suzuki K. Goto Y. Efendic S. Diabetologia. 1993; 36: 3-8Google Scholar). These experiments suggest that pancreatic G-6-Pase activity may play an important role in the control of glucose metabolism.G-6-Pase activity has been detected in pancreatic islets (9Ashcroft S.J. Randle P.J. Nature. 1968; 219: 857-858Google Scholar, 10Waddell I.D. Burchell A. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 471-476Google Scholar). However, there are conflicting reports on the detection of low levels of G-6-Pase activity in islets (9Ashcroft S.J. Randle P.J. Nature. 1968; 219: 857-858Google Scholar, 10Waddell I.D. Burchell A. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 471-476Google Scholar, 11Perales M.A. Sener A. Malaisse W.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 101: 67-71Google Scholar, 12Arden S.D. Zahn T. Steegers S. Webb S. Bergman B. O'Brien R.M. Hutton J.C. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 531-542Google Scholar). In the liver, glucose-6-phosphatase activity is encoded by LG-6-Pase (NCB accession NP_000142). This gene, however, is unlikely to be responsible for G-6-Pase activities in pancreatic islets, since it has only been detected in the liver, small intestine, and kidney (13Lei K.J. Shelly L.L. Pan C.J. Sidbury J.B. Chou J.Y. Science. 1993; 262: 580-583Google Scholar, 14Rajas F. Bruni N. Montano S. Zitoun C. Mithieux G. Gastroenterology. 1999; 117: 132-139Google Scholar, 15Croset M. Rajas F. Zitoun C. Hurot J.M. Montano S. Mithieux G. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 740-746Google Scholar). Recently, a mouse gene encoding for a protein with 50% amino acid sequence identity to the liver G-6-Pase was cloned from mouse islets and named islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit-related protein (IGRP). In mice, IGRP is expressed exclusively in pancreatic islets. Surprisingly, no phosphatase activity was detected from the recombinant protein expressed in several mammalian transient transfection systems (12Arden S.D. Zahn T. Steegers S. Webb S. Bergman B. O'Brien R.M. Hutton J.C. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 531-542Google Scholar, 16Ebert D.H. Bischof L.J. Streeper R.S. Chapman S.C. Svitek C.A. Goldman J.K. Mathews C.E. Leiter E.H. Hutton J.C. O'Brien R.M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 543-551Google Scholar). Cloning of the human ortholog was subsequently reported, and no enzymatic activity was demonstrated for the recombinant protein (17Martin C.C. Bischof L.J. Bergman B. Hornbuckle L.A. Hilliker C. Frigeri C. Wahl D. Svitek C.A. Wong R. Goldman J.K. Oeser J.K. Lepretre F. Froguel P. O'Brien R.M. Hutton J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 27: 25197-25207Google Scholar). The presence of a specific G-6-Pase catalytic activity in islets therefore remains unresolved.We examined the enzymatic activity of human IGRP, and found robust enzymatic activity in mammalian and insect cell membranes overexpressing IGRP. IGRP mRNA levels are up-regulated in cultured mouse islets under elevated glucose concentrations. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that IGRP is likely the gene responsible for G-6-Pase activity in the islet. Our high-throughput screening of a small molecule compound library (∼800,000 compounds) identified several inhibitors that are specific for IGRP activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimal Usage—Male ob/ob, db/db, Ay/a and tub/tub in C57BL/6J strain, along with littermate controls, were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mouse pancreatic islets were isolated as described previously (18Gotoh M. Maki T. Kiyoizumi T. Santomi S. Monaco A.P. Transplantation. 1985; 40: 437-438Google Scholar). For the glucose treatment experiment, islets isolated from 6–8-week-old male B6Af1 mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were dispersed in 20–30 ml of warm phosphate-buffered saline in a 50-ml tube by vigorous shaking. Dispersed islet cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640/10% fetal bovine serum, and pipetted onto Matrigel (BD Biosciences)-coated plates. After overnight culture, the plates were washed with warm phosphate-buffered saline and replaced with media containing various concentrations of glucose.Materials—Tween 20, malachite green, ammonium molybdate, 3,3-dimethylglutaric acid, MES, potassium hydroxide, p-nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP), inorganic phosphate standard and Glc-6-P were purchased from Sigma. (4-Methoxyphenyl)-[4-(4-trifluoromethoxy-phenyl)-6,7-dihydro-4H-thieno[3,2-c]pyridin-5-yl]-methanone (compound 1) and (4-methoxyphenyl)-[7-(4-trifluoromethoxy-phenyl)-4,7-dihydro-5H-thieno[2,3-c]pyridin-6-yl]-methanone (compound 2) were synthesized as described previously (19Madsen P. Lundbeck J.M. Jakobsen P. Varming A.R. Westgaard N. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2000; 8: 2277-2289Google Scholar). Dipotassium bisperoxo(5-hydroxypyridine-2-carboxyl)oxovanadate (V) (bpV(HOpic), compound 4), and potassium bisperoxo(bipyridine)oxovanadate (V) (bpV(bipy), compound 5) were obtained from CalBiochem (San Diego, CA). Hydrochloric acid was purchased from JT Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ). Bovine serum albumin and the BCA (bicinchoninic acid) protein determination kit were purchased from Pierce. Glucose oxidase and horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Sigma and used without purification. Amplex Red and resorufin were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other reagents are purchased from Sigma unless noted otherwise. BD Biosciences Falcon 384 well black polystyrene assay plates were used for this study. Stock solutions of 0.2% malachite green, 100 mm Glc-6-P, 5 n potassium hydroxide, 500 mm MES K+ pH 6.5, and 3,3-dimethylglutaric acid, pH 6.5 were all made with distilled, deionized filtered water. Ammonium molybdate (4.2%) was made in 5 n hydrochloric acid. The colorimetric detection reagent contains one part of 4.2% ammonium molybdate and three parts of 0.2% malachite green. This solution was incubated at room temperature on a shaker for 30 min, filtered through a disposable 0.22-micron filter apparatus, and stored at room temperature for 1 week. Prior to the addition of the detection reagent, 67 μl of 10% Tween 20 was added to every 10 ml of detection mix (20Baykov A.A. Evtushenko O.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 266-270Google Scholar, 21Geladopoulos T.P. Sotiroudis T.G. Evangelopoulos A.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 112-116Google Scholar). The enzyme rinse buffer contained 10 mm MES K+, pH 6.5, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm magnesium sulfate and was stored at 4 °C.Northern blot, Western blot, Quantitative PCR, and in Situ Hybridization—For Northern blot analysis, the mouse pancreas total RNA was prepared from male ob/ob, db/db, Ay/a, tub/tub and their respective littermate control mice at 15 weeks of age (RNAgents, Promega). Twenty micrograms of total RNA were loaded to each lane. The blot was prepared using a standard protocol with 1.25% MOPS-agarose gel (EmbiTec, San Diego, CA) and Biotrans membrane (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) (22Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 7.42-7.44Google Scholar). The probe was generated from the mouse IGRP coding region by PCR. The DNA fragment was radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP using Prime-It RmT Random Primer Labeling Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and the probe was purified by ProbeQuant™ G-50 Micro Columns (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Hybridization was done using ExpressHyb solutions (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.For quantitative PCR analysis (Taqman), RNA was extracted from isolated islets, and then treated with deoxyribonuclease I (Invitrogen). First strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamers (Superscript First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR, Invitrogen). The Taqman primers and probe sets, designed using Primer Express 1.5 software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), are as follows: forward primer TGAGTTGATGGCGAAACCC, reverse primer ACGCCTTTTGCTGGACTCG, and probe AGCCAAAGAGGACCCCGAGGTTTCTC. The samples were run on ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector and data was analyzed by Sequence Detector v1.7 (Applied Biosystems). Expression levels of IGRP were first normalized to that of 18 S RNA in each sample. Arbitrary units were then assigned to different samples to indicate their relative abundance.Western blotting was done according to the protocol of ECL Western blotting analysis system (Amersham Biosciences). His-probe (H-15) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology was used as primary antibody (1:1000 dilution); anti-rabbit IgG, horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibody (Amersham Biosciences) was used as secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution).For in situ hybridization, pancreas from db/db and littermate lean mice at the age of 10 weeks were dissected, frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. 10-micron sections were cut on a Microm HM505E microtome and mounted on Superfrost plus slides (VWR Scientific, Westchester, PA). Slides were air dried for 15 min and stored at -80 °C. Complementary RNA probes were generated from the mouse IGRP coding region by PCR. The hybridization was performed as described previously (23Stahl A. Hirsch D.J. Gimeno R.E. Punreddy S. Ge P. Watson N. Patel S. Kotler M. Raimondi A. Tartaglia L.A. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 299-308Google Scholar). The controls for the in situ hybridization included the use of corresponding sense probes to show no signal above background in all cases.Glucose-6-Phosphatase Activity by the IGRP Protein Expressed in COS7 Cells—For transient transfection assays, no DNA, 10 μg of pcDNA3.1, untagged liver G-6-Pase-pcDNA3.1 and untagged IGRP-pcDNA3.1 constructs were transfected into COS7 cells (50–80% confluent) using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagents from Invitrogen; 2 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase vector was co-transfected for internal transfection efficiency control. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (10% fetal bovine serum was added after 3 h of incubation) and harvested after 24–48 h of incubation, using Cell Scraper in the presence of 5 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The microsomes were prepared as described (12Arden S.D. Zahn T. Steegers S. Webb S. Bergman B. O'Brien R.M. Hutton J.C. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 531-542Google Scholar). Microsomes collected from five 100-mm plates were resuspended in 200–300 μl of homogenization buffer (0.3 mm sucrose, 10 mm MES K+, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgSO4, pH 6.5). G-6-Pase assay was performed essentially the same as described below.Baculovirus Expression and Enzyme Preparation of IGRP—The IGRP cDNA was cloned from a human islet cDNA library prepared. The LG-6-Pase gene was also cloned by RT-PCR using human liver cDNA as the template. Both cDNAs were cloned into pcDNA3.1 for protein expression and enzyme assays. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. For baculovirus expression, the exact coding sequences encoding the human IGRP and the human LG-6-Pase were cloned into pFastBac (Invitrogen) EcoRI-XhoI sites as either N-terminal-His6 or C-terminal-His6 fusions (Fig. 2). Recombinant baculovirus was generated using the Bac-to-Bac™ Baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen). The recombinant pFastBac vectors were transformed into DH10Bac and plated onto Luria Agar plates containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin, 7 μg/ml gentamicin, 10 μg/ml tetracycline, 100 μg/ml Bluo-gal, and 40 μg/ml isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. White colonies were picked for inoculation and isolation of recombinant Bacmid. Recombinant Bacmid was verified by PCR with the pUC/M13 primers. To generate Baculovirus, the recombinant Bacmid was used for transfecting SF-9 cells using CellFECTINE. At 5 days post-transfection, recombinant baculovirus was harvested, and the cells collected. Cell extract was prepared in lysis buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl and 1% Tween 20 and total cell extract and soluble fractions were analyzed by Western using polyHis antibodies (Pierce). For protein production, cells were infected with a multiplicity of infections of 0.1 pfu/cell and cell density at harvest of 2.9 × 106 cells/ml. The cell pellets were resuspended at about 1 g/7.5 ml of rinse buffer, hand mixed, and microfluidized four times. The disrupted IGRP-expressing cells were centrifuged 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellets were washed with an equal volume of rinse buffer twice to remove inorganic phosphate. The final protein concentration was determined by the Pierce BCA Protein Plus assay with bovine serum albumin as standard. Attempts were made to solubilize catalytically active IGRP and LG-6-Pase using a wide variety of detergents. These attempts failed due to the instability of the enzyme after its solubilization from membranes (24Burchell A. Burchell B. Biochem. J. 1982; 205: 567-573Google Scholar, 25Speth M. Schize H.U. FEBS Lett. 1986; 202: 32-36Google Scholar).Glucose-6-Phosphatase Assay using Malachite Green Detection Method—The IGRP enzyme assay was run using a concentration of 0.38 mg/ml of protein preparation for each 20-μl assay. Protein amounts were kept constant and monitored using the Pierce BCA Protein Plus assay. 4 μl of ∼1.9 mg/ml IGRP and 16 μl of assay buffer containing 0.62 mm Glc-6-P, 62 mm MES K+ pH 6.5 were added to each well to give final concentrations of 0.5 mm G-6-P, 50 mm MES pH 6.5, and 0.38 mg/ml of IGRP enzyme preparation. The reaction was incubated for 40 min and quenched using 80 μl of the detection reagent with 0.067% Tween 20. Then, the reaction was incubated at ambient temperature for 35 min for color development. Absorbance was measured at 650 nm using the Molecular Devices SpectraMax (Sunnyvale, CA). Dependence of enzyme activity on divalent and monovalent metal ion concentration, pH, detergents, buffer effect, Me2SO tolerance, and incubation time were all determined to forward the final assay conditions. Controls were run in the absence of enzyme and/or substrate. LG-6-Pase was characterized under conditions identical to those for the IGRP assay. LG-6-Pase is more active than IGRP under these assay conditions and thus 10-fold less LG-6-Pase was used in the assays. The final concentration per well of LG-6-Pase was 0.022 mg/ml. For determination of the Michaelis constant of Glc-6-P, the enzyme was incubated at 25 °C with 50 mm MES, increasing concentrations of Glc-6-P from 50 μm to 5 mm for IGRP and Glc-6-P from 50 μm to 5 mm for LG-6-Pase, respectively (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Dependence of dephosphorylation rate upon glucose-6-phosphate concentration. Shown in A is detection of glucose using glucose oxidase, peroxidase and Amplex Red. Michaelis-Menten plot for IGRP activity measured by coupling enzyme system is shown in B. Phosphohydrolase activity was measured in malachite green system and coupling enzyme system with varying concentrations of Glc-6-P as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The inset panels represent the Lineweaver-Burk plots.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Glucose-6-Phosphatase Assay using Glucose Oxidase/Peroxidase-coupling Enzymes—Phosphohydrolase activity of IGRP was assayed by monitoring release of glucose from glucose-6-phosphate using modified glucose oxidase/peroxidase coupling system (26Mao H. Yang T. Cremer P.S. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 379-385Google Scholar). Glucose oxidase catalyzes oxidation of β-d-glucose to δ-d-gluconolactone and hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide is then used by peroxidase to convert Amplex Red to resorufin, a molecule with high fluorescence. Fluorescence was monitored using excitation at 530 nm and fluorescence detection at 590 nm. For a glucose standard curve, the appropriate amount of the 50 mm glucose standard solution was diluted into reaction buffer to yield glucose concentrations of 0 to 60 μm. The reaction mixture contained 50 μm Amplex Red, 5 units/ml glucose oxidase, 0.5 units/ml horseradish peroxidase and 50 mm MES (pH 6.5) in a final volume of 50 μl. Fluorescence was monitored in the BMG FluoStar Galaxy (Durham, NC) using excitation at 530 nm and fluorescence detection at 590 nm. For comparison to the kinetic constants for inorganic phosphate formation determined by malachite green assay as described above, the steady-state kinetic constants for glucose formation by IGRP were determined using the same buffer and substrate concentrations as in the malachite green assay plus the 50 μm Amplex Red, 5 units/ml glucose oxidase and 0.5 units/ml horseradish peroxidase (Table I and Fig. 3).Table IKinetic constants of Glc-6-P for IGRP, and LG-6-PaseEnzymeInorganic phosphate detection methodaAssay conditions are described under “Experimental Procedures”Glucose detection methodaAssay conditions are described under “Experimental Procedures”KmVmaxKmVmaxmmnmol/mg/minmmnmol/mg/minIGRP0.45 ± 0.069bResults are from three individual experiments presented as mean values ± S.E.32 ± 1.5bResults are from three individual experiments presented as mean values ± S.E.0.29 ± 0.035bResults are from three individual experiments presented as mean values ± S.E.77 ± 2.7bResults are from three individual experiments presented as mean values ± S.E.LG-6-Pase2.5 ± 0.25bResults are from three individual experiments presented as mean values ± S.E.2400 ± 84bResults are from three individual experiments presented as mean values ± S.E.NDcND, not determinedNDcND, not determineda Assay conditions are described under “Experimental Procedures”b Results are from three individual experiments presented as mean values ± S.E.c ND, not determined Open table in a new tab Determination of Effects of pH and Metal Concentration on IGRP Activity—All reactions were performed as mentioned above with the addition of one of the following reagents: NaCl, FeCl2, CoCl2, ZnCl2, MnCl2, or MgCl2 at a final concentration of 10 μm or 1 mm. The buffers used in the pH study were MES, Bis-Tris propane, Chaps, NaOAc, and Pipes at 50 mm, respectively. Membrane proteins were treated with increasing concentrations of the buffer from 10 to 200 mm to determine the effect of buffer concentration on phosphohydrolase activity of IGRP using glucose-6-phosphate as the substrate.Stability of Enzyme—The IGRP membrane preparation tolerates one freeze-thaw cycle. A freeze-thaw cycle means flash freezing in a mixture of isopropyl alcohol and dry ice and storing in a -80 °C freezer and thawing on ice before use. After the second cycle of freeze-thaw, ∼30% of initial activity was lost. In order to prevent loss in enzyme activity and maintain consistent assay condition, aliquots of enzyme were stored at -80 °C and unused portions were discarded after the first freeze thaw cycle.Determination of Kinetic Constants for IGRP and LG-6-Pase—The optimal assay conditions were determined to be 50 mm MES K+ pH 6.5, 0.5 mm Glc-6-P, 0.38 mg/ml IGRP membrane prep concentration in a 20-μl total volume in a 384-well black plate with a clear bottom. The reactions were performed as described above and substrate concentrations ranged from 50 μm to 5 mm for IGRP and from 50 μm to 15 mm for LG-6-Pase. The kinetic constants were obtained by fitting the data to equation 1 using Prism (Graph Pad Software Inc., San Diego, CA), where v is the initial velocity, Vmax is the maximal velocity, S is the substrate concentration, and Km is the Michaelis constant, shown in Equation 1. v=VmaxS/(Km+S)(Eq. 1) The kinetic data are summarized in Table I.IC50 Determination of Inhibitors—Known human LG-6-Pase inhibitors, 1 and 2 were tested against the activity of IGRP and LG-6-Pase in protein membranes. From our library of ∼800,000 compounds, compound 3 has been found to inhibit IGRP activity in a dose-dependent fashion. Peroxyvanadium compounds were also tested as inhibitors of IGRP as well as LG-6-Pase. The results are summarized in Table II. In general, the reaction was run at room temperature for forty minutes in a total volume of 20 μl containing 50 mm MES K+ pH 6.5, 0.5 mm Glc-6-P, 0.38 mg/ml of IGRP, 5% Me2SO and various concentrations of inhibitors from 1.0 nm to 500 μm.Table IIGlucose-6-phosphatase inhibitors Open table in a new tab RESULTSThe IGRP mRNA Expression in Obese/Hyperglycemic Mice— Many studies have shown that the G-6-Pase activity is detectable, albeit at very low levels, in pancreatic islets (6Khan A.

O'Brien R.M. Hutton J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 27: 25197-25207Google Scholar). To further explore its biological function, we studied the IGRP mRNA expression level in the pancreas of several obese/hyperglycemia mouse models because up-regulation of G-6-Pase enzymatic activity has been previously reported in diabetic rodent models (13Lei K.J. Shelly L.L. Pan C.J. Sidbury J.B. Chou J.Y. Science. 1993; 262: 580-583Google Scholar, 14Rajas F. Bruni N. Montano S. Zitoun C. Mithieux G. Gastroenterology. 1999; 117: 132-139Google Scholar). We confirmed that IGRP expression was restricted to pancreatic islets (Fig. 1A). Increased levels of IGRP mRNA were observed by Northern analysis in pancreas isolated from ob/ob, db/db, Ay/a, and tub/tub mice versus their respective control mice. However, it appears that the up-regulation was a consequence of β-cell hypertrophy and/or hyperplasia because the IGRP mRNA level was decreased as measured by quantitative PCR in ob/ob (2.8-fold), db/db (1.8-fold), Ay/a (3.0-fold), or unchanged in tub/tub islets (Fig. 1B).Fig. 1Localization and regulation of IGRP mRNA.

https://openalex.org/W2055985367,"ARID (AT-rich interaction domain) is a homologous family of DNA-binding domains that occur in DNA-binding proteins from a wide variety of species, ranging from yeast to nematodes, insects, mammals, and plants. SWI1, a member of the SWI/SNF protein complex that is involved in chromatin remodeling during transcription, contains the ARID motif. The ARID domain of human SWI1 (also known as p270) does not select for a specific DNA sequence from a random sequence pool. The lack of sequence specificity shown by the SWI1 ARID domain stands in contrast to the other characterized ARID domains, which recognize specific AT-rich sequences. We have solved the three-dimensional structure of human SWI1 ARID using solution NMR methods. In addition, we have characterized nonspecific DNA binding by the SWI1 ARID domain. Results from this study indicate that a flexible, long, internal loop in the ARID motif is likely to be important for sequence-specific DNA recognition. The structure of the human SWI1 ARID domain also represents a distinct structural subfamily. Studies of ARID indicate that the boundary of DNA binding structural and functional domains can extend beyond the sequence homologous region in a homologous family of proteins. Structural studies of homologous domains such as the ARID family of DNA-binding domains should provide information to better predict the boundary of structural and functional domains in structural genomic studies.

ARID 1The abbreviations used are: ARID, AT-rich interaction domain; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation. 1The abbreviations used are: ARID, AT-rich interaction domain; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation. is a family of homologous DNA-binding domains. Because the initial ARID proteins to be characterized interact with specific AT-rich sequences, the motif was named the AT-rich interaction domain (1Herrscher R.F. Kaplan M.H. Lelsz D.L. Das C. Scheuermann R. Tucker P.W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3067-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 2Gregory S.L. Kortschak R.D. Kalionis B. Saint R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). ARID domains occur in a wide variety of species ranging from yeast to nematodes, insects, mammals, and plants (3Kortschak R.D. Tucker P.W. Saint R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 294-299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The characterized ARID proteins all have DNA binding activities. The ARID motif does not share any sequence similarity to previously characterized DNA-binding motifs. Using solution NMR methods, the structures of two ARID proteins have been solved. These are the human Mrf-2 (4Yuan Y.C. Whitson R.H. Liu Q. Itakura K. Chen Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 959-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and the Drosophila Dri (5Iwahara J. Clubb R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6084-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Mrf-2 is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein and may be involved in the regulation of energy balance (6Whitson R.H. Tsark W. Huang T. Itakura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 312: 997-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The protein Dri, which recognizes a specific ATrich sequence, is essential for the development of Drosophila embryos (2Gregory S.L. Kortschak R.D. Kalionis B. Saint R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 7Shandala T. Kortschak R.D. Gregory S. Saint R. Development. 1999; 126: 4341-4349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ARID domains in Mrf-2 and Dri share similar structures in the central regions. However significant differences exist at both the N and C termini; Dri forms two additional helices in the C- and N-terminal flanking sequences. These differences in flanking regions are not due to the differences in the expression constructs, because the sequence that is equivalent to the C-terminal extra helix in Dri is included in the Mrf-2 expression construct. In addition, extension of the N-terminal region of Mrf-2 to include the sequence equivalent to the extra N-terminal helix in the Dri ARID shows that the extended region is not structured in solution. The structural diversity between the Mrf-2 and Dri domains indicates that other structural subfamilies that are distinct from those represented by the Mrf-2 and Dri ARIDs are likely to exist. SWI1, which contains the ARID motif, is a member of the SWI/SNF complex found in yeasts and humans (8Peterson C.L. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R245-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 9Olave I.A. Reck-Peterson S.L. Crabtree G.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 755-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 10Iba H. Mizutani T. Ito T. Rev. Med. Virol. 2003; 13: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This complex is involved in chromatin remodeling and plays a critical role in transcriptional control and gene expression. SWI1 is clearly involved in DNA binding, because it can cross-link to DNA by UV-activated cross-linkers in the SWI/SNF complex with DNA (11Quinn J. Fyrberg A.M. Ganster R.W. Schmidt M.C. Peterson C.L. Nature. 1996; 379: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Although some ARID domains such as those in Mrf-2 and Dri and also in another protein known as Bright (1Herrscher R.F. Kaplan M.H. Lelsz D.L. Das C. Scheuermann R. Tucker P.W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3067-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) are sequence-specific double-stranded DNA-binding proteins, the ARID domain of human SWI1 (also known as p270) does not select specific double-stranded DNA sequences from a random pool (12Dallas P.B. Pacchione S. Wilsker D. Bowrin V. Kobayashi R. Moran E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3137-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Because the SWI1 ARID does not recognize a specific DNA sequence, in contrast to the DNA binding properties of well characterized Mrf-2 and Dri proteins, structural elucidation of this domain would further our understanding of DNA binding by the ARID family. We have determined the three-dimensional structure of the SWI1 ARID domain and investigated its interaction with DNA. We have found that the three-dimensional structure of the p270 ARID represents a distinct structural subfamily. In addition, binding of the p270 ARID to DNA suggests structural determinants on sequence-specific DNA binding by the ARID family. Sample Preparation—The SWI1 ARID for NMR structural studies was expressed in Escherichia coli. The cDNA encoding residues 606 761 of human SWI1, followed by six His residues as a tag, was subcloned into PET28a (Novagen, Inc). This construct includes the regions that are equivalent to the additional helices in the N and C termini of Dri. In the subsequent discussion, the amino acids are numbered according to the sequence in the expression construct, i.e. residues 606-761 of human SWI1 are numbered as 1-155. The expression plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3). E. coli cells containing the expression plasmid were grown at 37 °C in M-9 minimal media supplemented with trace minerals and basal medium Eagle vitamins (Invitrogen). (15NH4)2SO4 (1.5 g/liter) was used as the nitrogen source, and 13C-enriched glucose (2 g/liter) was used as the 13C source. The protein was purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) to > 95% homogeneity as judged by SDS-PAGE. ∼6 mg of protein can be purified from one liter of E. coli culture. The NMR samples contained ∼1.0 mm protein in 100 mm phosphate buffer at pH 6 and 5 mm dithiothreitol in 95% H2O/5% 2H2O or 100% 2H2O. NMR Spectroscopy and Structural Calculation—Resonance assignment of the human SWI1 ARID has been described previously (13Kim S. Zhu L. Yu B. Chen Y. J. Biomol. NMR. 2003; 27: 277-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The 3JHN-Hα coupling constants were measured in an HNHA experiment (14Bax A. Vuister G.W. Grzesiek S. Delaglio F. Wang A.C. Tschudin R. Zhu G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 79-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Additional dihedral angle Φ and ψ restraints were obtained based on chemical shifts as determined by the TALOS program (15Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2731) Google Scholar). Distance restraints were obtained from 15N-separated (mixing time 100 ms) and 13C-separated (mixing time 100 ms) three-dimensional NOESY spectra (16Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). A 15N-1H heteronuclear NOE experiment (17Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2002) Google Scholar) was collected to assess the conformational flexibility of the protein. HNHA, 15N-1H heteronuclear NOE, and 15N-separated NOESY spectra were collected at 25 °C on a Varian Unity-plus 500 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance probe, pulsed field gradient, and pulse-shaping capabilities. The 13C-separated NOESY spectrum was collected on a 600 MHz Varian Inova spectrometer at Pacific Northwestern National Laboratory. Felix 98 (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA) was used for all NMR data processing and analysis. The distance restraints were grouped into three ranges, 3, 4, and 5 Å, based on the intensity of NOE cross-peaks. Structures were initially calculated from simulated annealing calculations using Dyana (18Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2550) Google Scholar). The final structures were calculated using the ARIA (19Linge J.P. Habeck M. Rieping W. Nilges M. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 315-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) approach. More than 1400 manually assigned NOEs and dihedral restraints were used as input for ARIA calculation. A manually checked peak list of 13C-separated NOESY was used as the input peak list. Standard ARIA protocol was used for the calculation. In each of the 8 iterations, 30 structures were calculated, 10 structures from these 30 were kept, and the top 7 structures that have the least violation of the NMR constraints were used for evaluation. Inspection of the assignments made by ARIA indicates that the ARIA calculation did not make novel NOE assignments between residues where inter-residue NOEs were not found by manual assignments, but ARIA made many stereo-specific assignments that would be difficult or impossible to make manually. These stereo-specific assignments improved the convergence of the structural calculations. The quality of the NMR structures was evaluated using the program PROCHECK (20Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4363) Google Scholar). Protein-DNA Interaction—A sample of 0.4 mm15N-labeled human SWI1 ARID domain was titrated with 10 mm unlabeled DNA to a molar ratio of 1:1. The titration was monitored using two-dimensional HSQC NMR spectra. Six titration points were taken. Because human SWI1 can bind to nonspecific double strand DNA, the “Dickerson dodecamer,” a duplex of 12 base pairs with the sequence (d(CGCGAATTCGCG))2, was used for the binding studies. Structure Determination—The comparison of the Mrf-2 and Dri ARIDs indicates that the domain boundary of the ARID family could extend beyond the sequence homologous region. Therefore, the initial construct of the human SWI1 ARID extended 25 residues on both the N and the C terminus beyond the sequence homologous region of the ARID. This construct encodes residues 606-761 of human SWI1 (indicated as residues 1-155 in subsequent discussions). Nearly complete resonance assignments have been obtained for this construct as described previously (13Kim S. Zhu L. Yu B. Chen Y. J. Biomol. NMR. 2003; 27: 277-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Cα chemical shifts and characteristic NOEs were used to identify secondary structures in the protein (21Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar, 22Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). The sequence and secondary structures of human SWI1 and the location of homologous helices in the Mrf-2 and Dri ARID domains are shown in Fig. 1A. Human SWI1 contains all six helices that are conserved in the structures of Mrf-2 (4Yuan Y.C. Whitson R.H. Liu Q. Itakura K. Chen Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 959-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and Dri (5Iwahara J. Clubb R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6084-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It does not contain a helix equivalent to helix H7 of Dri. However, it contains a short extra N-terminal helix that partly superimposes with the Dri helix H0. In addition, SWI1 does not have the β-hairpin that Dri does. Residues at the N and C termini in this construct of human SWI1 have sharp NMR resonances, indicating that these residues are highly flexible and not structured. To determine which residues are flexible and unstructured, a 15N-1H heteronuclear NOE experiment (17Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2002) Google Scholar) was performed for this construct of the human SWI1 ARID. The steady-state 1H-15N NOE values versus residue number are shown in Fig. 1B. The first 11 residues at the N terminus and the last 24 residues at the C terminus (indicated in black in the sequence in Fig. 1A) have negative 1H-15N heteronuclear NOEs, which suggests that these regions are unstructured and random. Although residues 12-18 do not form any regular secondary structures, they do have positive NOE values, indicating that this region is not random. To eliminate truncation artifacts in the spectra for structure determination of the protein, most residues at the termini that are not structured were eliminated in the second construct, the sequence of which is indicated in black in Fig. 1A. Deletion of the terminal sequence did not result in any significant chemical shift changes in the structured region, confirming that the three-dimensional structure of the human SWI1 ARID domain is independent of the unstructured termini. The structure of the SWI1 ARID was solved with >1400 structural constraints derived from NMR measurements. An ensemble of seven structures of the SWI1 ARID was used for detailed analysis of the structure. The structural statistics are given in Table I. All experimental NMR constraints are well satisfied. These structures also display only small deviations from idealized covalent geometry (Table I). Almost all of the residues in the structurally well defined regions have Φ and ψ dihedral angles in the most favorable regions of the Ramachandran plot. The residues in the generally allowed regions and the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot are located mainly in the loops, where the structure is less well defined, and significant conformational flexibility is indicated by lower values of 1H-15N steady-state NOEs.Table IStructural statistics of p270Type of dataValuesTotal restraints used1544Total NOE restraints1418Intraresidue611Sequential (|i − j| = 1)165Medium (1 <|i − j| ≤ 4)387Long range (|i − j| > 4)225DihedralΦ angles68ψ angles68R.m.s.d.aR.m.s.d. is root mean square deviation. from experimental distance restraintsDistance restraints (Å)0.0321Dihedral restraints (degrees)0.2390R.m.s.d.aR.m.s.d. is root mean square deviation. from idealized covalent geometryBonds (Å)0.0027Bond angles (°)0.5023Improper torsions (°)0.3962R.m.s.d.aR.m.s.d. is root mean square deviation. from average structure (Å)All backbone atoms in helical regionsbHelical regions include the following residues: H1, 20-22; H2, 28-43; H3, 61-71; H4, 74-79; H5, 82-89; and H6, 97-118.0.37All backbone atoms (residues 589-710)2.60All heavy atoms in helical regionsbHelical regions include the following residues: H1, 20-22; H2, 28-43; H3, 61-71; H4, 74-79; H5, 82-89; and H6, 97-118.0.85All heavy atoms (residues 589-710)2.92PROCHECK analysisResidues in most favorable region (%)81.6Residues in additional allowed regions (%)15.5Residues in generously allowed regions (%)2.1Residues in disallowed regions (%)0.9a R.m.s.d. is root mean square deviation.b Helical regions include the following residues: H1, 20-22; H2, 28-43; H3, 61-71; H4, 74-79; H5, 82-89; and H6, 97-118. Open table in a new tab Ensemble of the superimposed NMR structures is shown in Fig. 2A. Helical regions have well defined structures. The two internal loops, L1 and L2, are less well defined. In addition, both the N and C termini are flexible. The flexibility observed in the superimposed structures is consistent with the steady-state NOE values shown in Fig. 1B. A ribbon diagram of the SWI1 ARID (Fig. 2B) is shown along with those of the Mrf-2 (Fig. 2C) and Dri ARID (Fig. 2D) domains. The core region of the SWI1 ARID is similar to those of Mrf-2 and Dri. Helices H1-H6 of the SWI1 ARID can be superimposed on those of the Mrf-2 ARID with an average root mean square deviation of ∼1.8 Å among backbone atoms, and can be superimposed on those of the Dri ARID with an average root mean square deviation of 1.9 Å among backbone atoms. The main unique feature of the SWI1 ARID is that the N terminus forms an extended structure followed by a single turn 310 helix (H0). The extended structure at the N terminus interacts extensively with loop L1. This interaction is analogous to that observed between the α-helix H0 and L1 in the Dri ARID. However, the orientation of loop L1 in the SWI1 ARID is more similar to that in the Mrf-2 ARID; L1 is positioned close to loop L2 in both the Mrf-2 and SWI1 ARID, but it is positioned away from L2 in Dri. Structural Diversity in the ARID Family—In contrast to the similarity of the central region from helices H1 to H6, the ARIDs of SWI1, Dri, and Mrf-2 have significant conformational differences at the N and C termini, which extend beyond the sequence homologous domain. The Dri ARID forms two additional α-helices relative to the Mrf-2 ARID, H0 and H7, at the N and C termini, respectively. The SWI1 ARID does not contain H7, but contains a short 310 helix (H0) that is located in a position equivalent to part of helix H0 in Dri. Thus Mrf-2, Dri, and SWI1 represent three distinct structural subfamilies in ARID. A fourth ARID fold is likely to exist. Significant information is now available for correlating primary sequences with secondary structures, and prediction of secondary structures from primary sequences is successful in most cases (23Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used the PHD program (23Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to analyze the secondary structures of members of the ARID family. The PHD program predicted the presence of all helices in Mrf-2, Dri, and SWI1, although the boundaries of the helices differ slightly from the known structures (Fig. 3). Other ARID members, for whom the three-dimensional structures have not been determined, can also be grouped into different subfamilies based on PHD analysis (Fig. 3). Several members of ARID were predicted to contain helix H7 but not H0. These ARID domains are listed in the bottom group of Fig. 3. Thus, these ARID domains are likely to form another intermediate ARID structural subfamily, which is similar to the Dri ARID at the C terminus but similar to the Mrf-2 ARID at the N terminus. Binding Nonspecific DNA by the SWI1 ARID—SWI1 ARID does not select a specific double-stranded DNA sequence from a random pool (12Dallas P.B. Pacchione S. Wilsker D. Bowrin V. Kobayashi R. Moran E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3137-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To investigate the DNA binding mechanism of the SWI1 ARID, the long construct that encodes residues 606-761 of SWI1 was used in a DNA binding study because an unstructured terminus may be important for DNA binding, as found in the Mrf-2 ARID. A dodecamer sequence d(CGCGAATTCGCG*) (Dickerson dodecamer) was used to form a complex with the SWI1 ARID. This sequence is likely to have the sufficient length for binding SWI1 ARID, because 12-base pair DNA oligonucleotides are sufficiently long for binding the homologous Mrf-2 and Dri domains. Significant chemical shift changes in SWI1 were observed upon titration with the DNA sample. Superposition of the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the free and DNA-bound SWI1 ARID is shown in Fig. 4A. The intensity decrease in the HSQC spectrum of the DNA-bound SWI1 is largely due to the decrease in SWI1 concentration, because the titration with DNA has increased the volume. A plot of chemical shift changes versus residue number is shown in Fig. 4B. The regions that undergo the most significant chemical shift changes are indicated in the ribbon diagram of the three-dimensional structure of SWI1 ARID (Fig. 2B). The regions that have the largest chemical shift changes are likely to be involved in direct contact with DNA. These regions include several residues near the N terminus, loop L1, part of helices H4 and H5 (Fig. 2B). Because the chemical shift change of the SWI1 ARID upon DNA binding is localized, it is unlikely that this domain undergoes major structural changes upon forming a complex with DNA. The complex formation of SWI1 with DNA is in “fast exchange” relative to the chemical shift time scale. This allows estimation of the binding constant between the SWI1 ARID and the DNA using NMR chemical shift perturbation. The dissociation constant was calculated based on chemical shift changes at six different protein/DNA molar ratios. The dissociation constant was estimated to be 3.4 ± 1.8 μm. Because the interaction is nonspecific, the dissociation constant is likely to represent the binding constant of the SWI1 ARID to nonspecific DNA in general. The DNA binding mechanism of the Mrf-2 and Dri ARID domains has been investigated previously in great detail (25Zhu L. Hu J. Lin D. Whitson R.H. Itakura K. Chen Y. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9142-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 26Iwahara J. Iwahara M. Daughdrill G.W. Ford J. Clubb R.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These studies show that the ARID domains belong to the helix-turn-helix motif family and that helix H5 is the DNA recognition helix, which contacts the major groove of DNA. Loop L1 and the C-terminal region contact the adjacent minor groove or the ribose-phosphate backbone (5Iwahara J. Clubb R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6084-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25Zhu L. Hu J. Lin D. Whitson R.H. Itakura K. Chen Y. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9142-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 26Iwahara J. Iwahara M. Daughdrill G.W. Ford J. Clubb R.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The DNA-binding site of Dri (based on the three-dimensional structure of the Dri-DNA complex) and the DNA-binding site of Mrf-2 (based on chemical shift perturbation and changes in dynamics) are indicated in red in the ribbon representations of the Mrf2 (Fig. 2C) and Dri (Fig. 2D) structures. In contrast to the Mrf-2 and the Dri ARIDs, significant chemical shift changes were not observed for residues in loop L2 upon binding the dodecamer DNA. In addition, much smaller chemical shift changes than those observed when the Mrf-2 ARID bound to DNA were observed for residues at the C-terminal region of the SWI1 ARID, which is equivalent to the C-terminal DNA-binding sites of the Mrf-2 and Dri ARID domains. The C terminus of the human SWI1 ARID may not play as important a role in DNA binding as in the sequence specific Dri and Mrf-2 ARIDs, because much smaller chemical shift perturbation was observed in this region upon complex formation with DNA. The unique N-terminal region of SWI1 is likely to form important contacts with DNA, as indicated by the large chemical shift perturbation upon complex formation with DNA. The additional DNA interactions from the N-terminal region of human SWI1 may partially compensate for the lack of DNA contacts by the C terminus and loop L2. Determinants for Sequence Specificity—The differences in DNA-binding sites between the sequence specific Mrf-2 and Dri ARIDs and the nonspecific recognition by SWI1 suggest that loop L2 is likely to be important for sequence-specific DNA binding. A unique feature of the ARID domains is that the “turn” immediately proceeding the DNA recognition helix is a loop (L2) that is longer than most of the turns in helix-turn-helix motifs (27Warren A.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 28Huffman J.L. Brennan R.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In addition, this loop (L2) also contacts the major groove of DNA along with the DNA recognition helix and forms base-specific contacts in the sequence-specific ARID domains (25Zhu L. Hu J. Lin D. Whitson R.H. Itakura K. Chen Y. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9142-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 26Iwahara J. Iwahara M. Daughdrill G.W. Ford J. Clubb R.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, L2 is not involved in nonspecific DNA interaction in the human SWI1 ARID. L2 in SWI1 is shorter by one residue relative to those of the Mrf-2 and Dri ARIDs and is less flexible than that in the Mrf-2 ARID, as indicated by the 1H-15N NOE values (25Zhu L. Hu J. Lin D. Whitson R.H. Itakura K. Chen Y. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9142-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Interactions of proteins with DNA often involve flexible regions of proteins, such as the flexible C termini, loop L1 and L2 in the ARID domains, which form a more defined structure upon binding (25Zhu L. Hu J. Lin D. Whitson R.H. Itakura K. Chen Y. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9142-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This “folding upon binding” phenomenon has been proposed to be important for specificity (29Spolar R.S. Record Jr., M.T. Science. 1994; 263: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar), because nonspecific interactions are not likely to induce a specific structure formation. The shorter and more rigid L2 in the SWI1 ARID may restrict the ability of L2 to form base-specific contacts with DNA as in the Mrf-2 and Dri ARIDs. Thus the length and sequence of the loop L2 in ARIDs are likely to be more important in determining DNA binding specificity than the diverse N and C termini. Structural Diversity in ARID and Its Implication in Structural Genomics—One of the major challenges in the post-genomic era is to obtain three-dimensional structural information for proteins in the human genome. In the high throughput structural determination processes, one of the first tasks is to identify structural families based on their primary sequences (30Staunton D. Owen J. Campbell I.D. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 31Burley S.K. Bonanno J.B. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2002; 3: 243-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Then, the structure(s) of representative member(s) from each family will be determined and used to deduce structures of other members in the family. In ARID domains, nonhomologous regions that flank the sequence homologous regions can be integral components of the structural domains and are likely required for maintaining the structural stability. In addition, the non-homologous C terminus in Mrf-2 and Dri ARIDs are required for sequence-specific DNA binding; deletion of the flexible C terminus in Mrf-2 abolishes DNA binding (data not shown). Thus, the structural and functional domains can extend beyond the sequence homologous region in a family of homologous domains. Structural studies of homologous domains such as the ARID family of DNA-binding domains should provide information to better predict the boundary of structural and functional domains in structural genomic studies.

Cysteine, an impermeant reducing reagent, reversed pCMB and pCMBS effects only when applied from the extracellular medium. l-Glutamate and l-cystine, but not l-arginine, protected from the inactivation with an IC50 similar to the Km. Protection was not temperature-dependent, suggesting that it did not depend on large substrate-induced conformational changes. Mutation of Cys327 to Ala and Ser slightly modified the Km and a C327L mutant abolished transport function without compromising transporter expression at the plasma membrane. The results indicate that Cys327 is a functionally important residue accessible to the aqueous extracellular environment and is structurally linked to the permeation pathway and/or the substrate binding site.

Heteromeric amino acid transporters (HATs) 1The abbreviations used are: HAT, heteromeric amino acid transporter; LSHAT, HAT light subunit; pCMB, p-chloromercuribenzoate; pCMBS, p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; MTS, methanethiosulfonate; APC, amino acid/polyamine/organic cation; APA, basic amino acid/polyamine antiporter; GABP, E. coli γ-aminobutyric acid permease. are composed of a heavy subunit and a light subunit (LSHAT) linked by a conserved disulfide bridge (1Verrey F.

The heavy subunit is important for trafficking of the heterodimer to the plasma membrane, whereas the light subunit confers transport function and specificity (3Nakamura E. Sato M. Yang H.

Two heavy subunits are known, 4F2hc and rBAT (1Verrey F. Meier C. Rossier G. Kuhn L.C. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2000; 440: 503-512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Chillaron J. Roca R.

The light subunit xCT bound to 4F2hc elicits sodium-independent transport of anionic l-cystine and l-glutamate by a 1:1 obligatory exchange (system xc–) (5Sato H. Tamba M. Ishii T. Bannai S. J. Biol.

Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2001; 442: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). xCT is expressed in most cell lines, in activated macrophages, and in the brain (5Sato H. Tamba M.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8028-8033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). System xc– functions physiologically for cystine uptake and glutamate efflux because of the low and high intracellular concentrations of cystine and glutamate, respectively. Cytosolic cystine concentrations are kept very low because of its rapid reduction to cysteine, the main source for the synthesis of intracellular glutathione. Indeed, transport of cystine and its intracellular reduction to cysteine are the rate-limiting steps in glutathione biosynthesis (5Sato H. Tamba M. Ishii T. Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11455-11458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 8Bannai S. Sato H. Ishii T. Sugita Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18480-18484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is consistent with the known regulation of xCT; its mRNA and xc– activity are induced by lipopolysaccharide in macrophages, and this induction is modulated by the ambient oxygen concentration (i.e. hypoxia decreases xCT expression and activity) (9Sato H. Kuriyama-Matsumura K. Hashimoto T. Sasaki H. Wang H. Ishii T. Mann G.E. Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10407-10412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Moreover, the xCT gene carries an electrophil-response element that may mediate some of these effects (10Sasaki H. Sato H. Kuriyama-Matsumura K. Sato K. Maebara K. Wang H. Tamba M. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44765-44771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The authors concluded that xCT provides an antioxidant defense for these cells, especially in regions of inflammation. In the brain, the localization of xCT suggests that it contributes to the maintenance of the redox state in the cerebrospinal fluid (7Sato H. Tamba M. Okuno S. Sato K. Keino-Masu K. Masu M. Bannai S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8028-8033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Little is known about the structure-function relationships of the HAT family. Reconstitution studies with the b0,+AT light subunit have shown that the rBAT heavy subunit is not necessary for the basic transport function (4Reig N. Chillaron J. Bartoccioni P. Fernandez E. Bendahan A. Zorzano A. Kanner B. Palacin M. Bertran J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4906-4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The relevant functional determinants should lie on the LSHATs. The topology of LSHATs has not been tested experimentally but is believed to adopt the classic model of 12-transmembrane domains. An approximation to the substrate binding site of LAT1 has been proposed based on substrate specificity and semi-empirical computational analysis (11Uchino H. Kanai Y. Kim do K. Wempe M.F.

Neurochem. 2003; 84: 1322-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) reported a naturally occurring interspecific change (W234L) that slightly modified LAT1 Km. Finally, the y+LAT1 L334R mutant found in lysinuric protein-intolerant patients inactivates transport as does the cystinuria mutation, A354T in b0,+AT (4Reig N. Chillaron J. Bartoccioni P.

Here we report that Cys327 in transmembrane domain 8 of the xCT light subunit is the target for transport inactivation caused by organic mercury compounds. We provide evidence that this residue may be closely linked to the substrate permeation pathway. To our knowledge, this is the first report to provide significant experimental insight into the structure-function of the LSHATs as well as a framework for a systematic study (15Kaback H.R. Sahin-Toth M. Weinglass A.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 610-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) of this family. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Construction of human 4F2hc Cysless has been described elsewhere (16Estevez R. Camps M. Rojas A.M. Testar X. Deves R. Hediger M.A. Zorzano A. Palacin M. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1319-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The human xCT in pNKS2 was used as the template for site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange™, Stratagene). A Cysless xCT was engineered by replacing the seven endogenous cysteine residues with serine. The mutated regions were excised by digestion with the appropriate restriction enzymes and subcloned back into the original plasmid. At position 327, cysteine was also mutated to Ala, Leu, and Thr, and the mutated region was then subcloned into N-terminally Myc-tagged human xCT (in pNKS2) with the appropriate restriction enzymes. Cysteine 327 was reintroduced into Cysless xCT by restriction enzyme digestion and subcloning into the Cysless construct. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Sequencing was performed on both strands with a d-Rhodamine dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The sequence reactions were analyzed with an Abi Prism 377 DNA sequencer. cRNA Preparation and Microinjection into Xenopus Oocytes—Synthesis of human wild type and Cysless 4F2hc cRNAs has been described elsewhere (16Estevez R. Camps M. Rojas A.M. Testar X. Deves R. Hediger M.A. Zorzano A. Palacin M. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1319-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In vitro synthesis of human xCT construct cRNAs was conducted with the NotI-linearized plasmid template using the protocol provided by Ambion (mMessage mMachine, Ambion, Austin, TX). The quality and the amount of transcribed RNA were checked by gel inspection and 260 nm absorbance before microinjection into Xenopus oocytes. The procedure for Xenopus oocyte isolation and the microinjection technique are described elsewhere (17Bertran J. Werner A. Moore M.L. Stange G. Markovich D. Biber J. Testar X. Zorzano A. Palacín M. Murer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5601-5605Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Defolliculated stage VI Xenopus laevis oocytes were injected with 50 nl of human 4F2hc and human xCT constructs alone or in combination (10 ng/oocyte). Transport Measurement—Influx rates of l-[3H]glutamate (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) and l-[35S]cystine (Amersham Biosciences) were measured at 1 μCi/μl in 100 mm choline-Cl medium 2 or 3 days after injection and under linear conditions as described elsewhere (6Bassi M.T. Gasol E. Manzoni M. Pineda M. Riboni M. Martin R. Zorzano A. Borsani G. Palacin M. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2001; 442: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Amino acid transport rates obtained with oocytes injected with water (50 nl) were similar to those of noninjected oocytes (data not shown). Results for transport experiments are given as mean ± S.E. for 6–8 individual oocytes. For the determination of the kinetic parameters of the different human xCT Cys327 mutants, the oocytes were incubated with different concentrations of l-glutamate (5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500 μm, 1 and 2 mm). Vmax and Km values were derived by the Michaelis-Menten equation using GraphPad Prism. Each experiment was performed at least twice on different batches of oocytes. Nonradioactive amino acids and chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Determination of the Effect of Sulfhydryl Reagents—Oocytes were incubated for 5 min at room temperature with choline-Cl medium containing 1 mm p-chloromercuribenzoate (pCMB), 1 mm p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate (pCMBS), 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), 1 mm [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate (MTSET), 2.5 mm 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA), 10 mm 2-sulfonatoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSES), 1 mm [4-(N-maleimido)benzyl] trimethylammonium (MBTA), 1 mm iodoacetamide, or 1 mm mersalyl acid and washed three times in choline-Cl medium. Subsequently transport of l-[3H]glutamate or l-[35S]cystine was assayed. To test whether methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents, iodoacetamide, NEM, and mersalyl acid reached the human xCT 327 cysteine, a second incubation was performed with 1 mm pCMB for 5 min before uptake measurement. For the protection assays, 2 mm l-glutamate, 2 mm l-arginine, or 300 μm l-cystine was added to the choline-Cl medium with pCMB or pCMBS and incubated at room temperature for 10 min (if not otherwise indicated on the figure). For some experiments different concentrations of unlabeled l-glutamate (5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, or 500 μm or 1 or 2 mm) or l-cystine (6, 15, 30, 60, 90, 150, or 300 μm) were included along with 50 μm pCMB during the 10-min preincubation step. For protection experiments at 4 °C, the preincubation step was done at 4 °C at the times indicated on Fig. 4. Then, oocytes were washed three times at room temperature in choline-Cl medium to remove unbound sulfhydryl reagent and amino acids. Transport was then measured as described above. In reactivation experiments, following incubation with the sulfhydryl reagents, either 10 mm free cysteine or 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol was added to the medium for 5, 10, and 20 min. At the end of the incubation, the oocytes were washed three times in choline-Cl medium, and transport was then measured as described above. The MTS reagents and pCMBS were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc. pCMB, mersalyl acid, iodoacetamide, and NEM were purchased from Sigma. Each of the sulfhydryl reagents was dissolved as a 1 m stock solution (MTS reagents, NEM, and iodoacetamide) or as a 100 mm stock solution (pCMB and pCMBS) in Me2SO. After dilution in choline-Cl medium to the final concentration, the reagents were used immediately. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Groups of five oocytes were prepared for immunofluorescence 3 days after injection with 10 ng of human 4F2hc, N-myc-human xCT wild type, or Cys327 mutant cRNA/oocyte, alone or in combination. Oocytes were placed in 500-mm3 cryomolds (Tissue-Tek, Miles, Elkhart, IN) and then sliced, fixed, and permeabilized as described elsewhere (16Estevez R. Camps M. Rojas A.M. Testar X. Deves R. Hediger M.A. Zorzano A. Palacin M. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1319-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Slices were incubated with monoclonal antibody 9E10 anti-Myc (ATCC, Manassas, VA), diluted 1:500 in 10% phosphate-buffered saline, at room temperature for 1 h. Slices were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with 7.5 μg/ml Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) at room temperature for 1 h, washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, and mounted in Immunofluore (ICN, Madrid, Spain). Data Analysis—Nonlinear regression fits of experimental and calculated data were performed with GraphPad Prism. The half-life times (t½) and IC50 values were determined by plotting the fraction of uptake remaining (F = uptake after/uptake before) as a function of the concentration or time of incubation of the reagent and then fitted to a nonlinear regression equation for one-phase exponential decay (F = Fmax × e(–Kc×t) + Fmin or F = Fmax × e(–Kt×c) + Fmin) where t is the incubation time in seconds, c is the concentration of reagent, and Kc and Kt are the pseudo first-order rate constants (when concentration or time were fixed, respectively). IC50 values were calculated as 0.6932/Kt and t½ as 0.6932/Kc. Fmin was set to zero, as both pCMB and pCMBS completely inhibited transport. In Fig. 3C, a nonlinear regression fit to a one-site binding (hyperbola) curve determined the IC50 values. We have started a systematic approach (15Kaback H.R. Sahin-Toth M. Weinglass A.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 610-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) to the study of the structure-function relationships of the light subunits of the HAT family. The xCT light subunit was chosen as a model because of (i) its high activity in the oocyte expression system (5Sato H. Tamba M. Ishii T. Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11455-11458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 6Bassi M.T. Gasol E. Manzoni M. Pineda M. Riboni M. Martin R. Zorzano A. Borsani G. Palacin M. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2001; 442: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar); (ii) its narrow substrate selectivity (i.e. glutamate and cystine); and (iii) its sensitivity to organic mercurials (as shown by preliminary experiments; see below and Fig. 1). The 4F2hc-xCT Heterodimer Is Inactivated by Mercurial Reagents—We tested the ability of pCMB and its impermeant derivative pCMBS to modify the transport elicited by the 4F2hc-xCT heterodimer in Xenopus oocytes. Both reagents completely inhibited glutamate transport in a dose-dependent manner with fast kinetics (at 1 min of incubation, the IC50 values were 75.5 ± 11.2 μm for pCMB and 300.4 ± 89.7 μm for pCMBS; see also Figs. 3A and 4). The permeable reducing reagent β-mercaptoethanol completely reversed the inhibition when applied for 10 min at 5 mm, verifying that a cysteine(s) residue was the target of mercury compounds (data not shown). The impermeant reagent cysteine (10 mm for 10 min) also reversed the inhibition (49.7 ± 13.5% of control value). The spontaneous reactivation was negligible for 10 min (data not shown). Cys327 in Transmembrane Domain 8 Is the Main Target for pCMB and pCMBS Transport Inactivation—We next examined which subunit carried the targeted cysteine(s). 4F2hc has two cysteines, one (Cys109) forming a disulfide bond with the xCT light subunit (Fig. 1). Early studies reported that 4F2hc cysteines are not essential for transport activity (16Estevez R. Camps M. Rojas A.M. Testar X. Deves R. Hediger M.A. Zorzano A. Palacin M. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1319-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 18Pfeiffer R. Spindler B. Loffing J. Skelly P.J. Shoemaker C.B. Verrey F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The expression of xCT together with 4F2hc without cysteines (Cysless 4F2hc) did not severely affect transport function (Fig. 1). pCMB and pCMBS fully inhibited glutamate transport, indicating that the target cysteine(s) was located in xCT. The seven endogenous cysteines of xCT (Fig. 2A) were mutated to serine in different combinations and transport activity, and pCMB/pCMBS reactivity was assayed. As shown in Fig. 2B, 100 μm l-glutamate uptake was relatively unaffected by the mutations, indicating that neither of the cysteines was essential per se for function. Strikingly, only C327S completely lost sensitivity to both pCMB and pCMBS, suggesting that this cysteine was the main target of the reagents. The result was confirmed by generating a Cysless form of the xCT (Cysless xCT) and reintroducing Cys327 (Cysless-C327) in this background (Fig. 2C). The Cysless xCT was 10–20% active compared with the wild type (which is enough for functional studies, given the high transport activity of the wild type). As expected, Cysless-C327, but not Cysless, was sensitive to both pCMB and pCMBS. We concluded that Cys327 is the main target of pCMB and pCMBS. Topology predictions for xCT with a variety of different computer algorithms locate Cys327 in the middle of transmembrane domain 8 (2Chillaron J. Roca R. Valencia A. Zorzano A. Palacin M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F995-F1018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Sato H. Tamba M. Ishii T. Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11455-11458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Results from our group using the 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin labeling procedure (19Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) show that the preceding loop is extracellular, whereas the next loop is intracellular. 2E. Gasol and M. Palacín, manuscript in preparation. Despite transmembrane localization, the sensitivity of Cys327 to the impermeant reagents pCMBS and cysteine indicate that it is accessible to the extracellular aqueous environment. Cys327 Is Located in a Structurally Restricted Environment— The effect of other cysteine-specific reagents (MTS reagents, NEM, iodoacetamide, ([4-(N-maleimido)benzyl] trimethylammonium, and mersalyl acid; see “Experimental Procedures”) was tested. At the concentrations used, none of them inhibited 4F2hc-xCT l-glutamate uptake even when this amino acid was present with the reagent during the preincubation time (data not shown). The same result was obtained with the Cysless-C327 xCT (data not shown). The reagents may have not reacted with any cysteine, or the reaction may have not affected transport activity. To distinguish between the two possibilities, oocytes expressing 4F2hc-xCT were preincubated with the different cysteine reagents, washed, and incubated again with pCMB under conditions that should normally lead to transport inhibition. The preincubation did not modify pCMB inhibition, indicating that they did not have access to Cys327 (data not shown). Given the diversity of the reagents used (in size, structure, reaction mechanism, and membrane permeability), pCMB and pCMBS may gain access to Cys327 via a structurally restricted pathway. xCT Substrates Protect from Transport Inactivation—The above data indicate that Cys327 is accessible at least to the extracellular medium during the transport cycle. This raised the possibility that this residue may be part of (or close to) the substrate permeation pathway. If this is true, amino acid substrates should delay the reaction of pCMB and pCMBS. Indeed, glutamate (Fig. 3A) and cystine (data not shown) strongly protected 4F2hc-xCT l-glutamate uptake from pCMB and pCMBS inhibition. The calculated t½ values were, for pCMB, 83.5 ± 7 s in the absence of amino acid, 1475 ± 690 s in the presence of l-glutamate, and 72.5 ± 21.7 s in the presence of l-arginine; and for pCMBS, 230.7 ± 51.4 s in the absence of amino acid, 3081 ± 959 s in the presence of l-glutamate, and 319.4 ± 39 s in the presence of l-arginine. As expected, l-arginine, neither a substrate nor an inhibitor, did not protect. Similar results were obtained with the Cysless-C327 xCT (Fig. 3B). Moreover, half-maximal protection (Fig. 3C) occurred at substrate concentrations similar to the Km measured in Xenopus oocytes (in the presence of pCMB, IC50 was 138 ± 16.3 μm for l-glutamate and 99.2 ± 9.2 μm for l-cystine) (see Refs. 5Sato H.

Open table in a new tab At least two different mechanisms may account for protection: (i) substrates may directly compete with pCMB and pCMBS for the substrate binding site/permeation pathway, or alternatively, (ii) a substrate-induced conformational change may occlude the access of mercury compounds to Cys327. It is generally accepted that large conformational changes in proteins are much more sensitive to temperature changes than substrate binding (20Chen J.G. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 21Seal R.P. Amara S.G. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1487-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This feature has been exploited experimentally to detect conformational changes in different carriers such as the serotonin transporter (22Androutsellis-Theotokis A. Ghassemi F. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45933-45938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and the neuronal glycine transporter (23López-Corcuera B. Núñez E. Martínez-Maza R. Geerlings A. Aragón C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43463-43470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We carried out a time course of the modification of xCT by pCMB (50 μm) in the presence of glutamate (2 mm) at 25 and 4 °C (Fig. 4). pCMB completely inhibited uptake at both temperatures although, as expected, at a slower rate at 4 °C (t½ = 63.6 ± 9 s at 25 °C and 436 ± 110 s at 4 °C). Glutamate equally protected from the inhibition both at 25 and 4 °C (t½ = 1272 ± 455 s–1 at 25 °C and 6932 ± 4852 s at 4 °C). Thus, glutamate protects the Cys327 residue at a step in the transport cycle, most likely prior to temperature-sensitive substrate-induced conformational changes. Analysis of Cys327 Mutants—Cys327 residue is either conserved or changed to Thr in the known mammalian LSHAT sequences (see Fig. 5A). Therefore, it is not expected to be a determinant of substrate specificity. Nevertheless, our results are consistent with a role for this residue in substrate binding. To test this hypothesis, we mutated Cys327 to Ser, Ala, Thr, and Leu and measured the transport function and expression (Figs. 5B and 6, and Table I). No significant differences were found between wild type and C327S, C327A, and C327T when 100 μm l-glutamate uptake was assayed. However, we observed a clear tendency of l-glutamate transport to decrease in the C327S mutant (72.5 ± 6% compared with the wild type) (Fig. 5B). The C327L mutant was inactive (Fig. 5B) even when 10 mm glutamate uptake was assayed (data not shown). Kinetic analysis revealed a slight increase in the Km for glutamate in the Ser and Ala mutants (2- and 1.5-fold, respectively) (Table I), which was statistically significant (F-test, p < 0.005). Cysless xCT showed a 1.9-fold increase in the Km for glutamate (328.8 ± 66.2 μm) compared with wild type (Table I). Interestingly, reintroducing the Cys327 in the Cysless xCT background decreased by 2.6-fold the Km for glutamate (124.1 ± 23 μm), resembling the Km for glutamate in wild type xCT (Table I). Thus, mutation of Cys327 to Ser produces a similar increase in the Km for glutamate in the wild type and Cysless backgrounds. Moreover, the pH dependence of the xCT-mediated cystine transport (6Bassi M.T. Gasol E. Manzoni M. Pineda M. Riboni M. Martin R. Zorzano A. Borsani G. Palacin M. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2001; 442: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) was not modified when Cys327 was re-introduced in the Cysless background (K0.5 values were 7 ± 0.20 and 6.7 ± 0.25 for Cysless xCT and xCT Cysless-C327, respectively). On the other hand, there was a tendency to shift the K0.5 to more basic values when compared with the wild type (K0.5 was 6.3 ± 0.25), suggesting that other cysteines (but not Cys327) might have a role in the pH dependence.Fig. 6Transport activity, mercury compounds sensitivity, and localization of Myc-tagged wild type (wt) xCT and Cys327 mutants. A, oocytes were injected with 4F2hc cRNA and the indicated xCT cRNAs. After 3 days, l-glutamate uptake (100 μm) was measured. Sensitivity to pCMB and pCMBS was tested as described in Fig. 2B legend. A representative experiment is shown. B, oocytes expressing xCT alone (xCT wt), together with 4F2hc (+4F2hc), the Cys327 mutants (C>A,L,S,T) together with 4F2hc, or uninjected were subjected to immunofluorescence experiments (see “Experimental Procedures”) with the anti-Myc-specific antibody (all xCT versions were Myc-tagged). Two different batches of oocytes gave similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To check for transporter expression, Myc-tagged wild type and mutant xCT transporters were constructed. Their activity and sensitivity toward pCMB and pCMBS were indistinguishable from the untagged versions (Fig. 6A and data not shown). All xCT variants (in the presence of 4F2hc) were expressed at similar levels on the oocyte surface as judged by immunofluorescence experiments (Fig. 6B). Therefore, large changes in transporter expression at the plasma membrane do not account for the functional differences among the Cys327 variants. More important, the inactive phenotype of the C327L xCT is not due to folding/trafficking alterations and may reflect a defective transport cycle. Together, the results suggest a location of Cys327 close to the substrate binding site. Here we provide evidence suggesting that Cys327 is located close to the substrate"

Comparisons of these structures have revealed that PLK exhibits different conformations during its catalytic process. After the binding of AMP-PCP (an analogue that replaced ATP) and pyridoxamine to PLK, this enzyme retains a conformation similar to that of the PLK·ATP complex. The distance between the reacting groups of the two substrates is 5.8 Å apart, indicating that the position of ATP is not favorable to spontaneous transfer of its phosphate group. However, the structure of PLK·ADP·PLP complex exhibited significant changes in both the conformation of the enzyme and the location of the ligands at the active site. Therefore, it appears that after binding of both substrates, the enzyme-substrate complex requires changes in the protein structure to enable the transfer of the phosphate group from ATP to vitamin B<sub>6</sub>. Furthermore, a conformation of the enzyme-substrate complex before the transition state of the enzymatic reaction was also hypothesized."

Recently, we defined the binding sites among the protein partners in the carboxyl-terminal domain of ahnak. Here we further narrowed down the β2-interaction sites to the carboxyl-terminal 188 amino acids of ahnak by the recombinant ahnak protein fragments P3 (amino acids 5456-5556) and P4 (amino acids 5556-5643). The effects of these P3 and P4 fragments on the calcium current were investigated under whole-cell patch clamp conditions on rat ventricular cardiomyocytes. P4 but not P3 increased significantly the current amplitude by 22.7 ± 5% without affecting its voltage dependence. The slow component of calcium current inactivation was slowed down by both P3 and P4, whereas only P3 slowed significantly the fast one. The composite recombinant protein fragment P3-P4 induced similar modifications to the ones induced by each of the ahnak fragments. In the presence of carboxyl-terminal ahnak protein fragments, isoprenaline induced a similar relative increase in current amplitude and shift in current kinetics. The actin-stabilizing agents, phalloidin and jasplakinolide, did not modify the effects of these ahnak protein fragments on calcium current in control conditions nor in the presence of isoprenaline. Hence, our results suggest that the functional effects of P3, P4, and P3-P4 on calcium current are mediated by targeting the ahnak-β2-subunit interaction rather than by targeting the ahnak-F-actin interaction. More specifically they suggest that binding of the β2-subunit to the endogenous subsarcolemmal giant ahnak protein re-primes the α1C/β2-subunit interaction and that the ahnak-derived proteins relieve the β2-subunit from this inhibition.

Ca2+ influx through the L-type Ca2+ channel (ICaL) initiates and modulates cardiac contraction. L-type Ca2+ channels activate with membrane depolarization and inactivate over time. Inactivation is an important property in regulating action potential duration and intracellular Ca2+ transients. The Ca2+ channels are multimeric proteins, built up of at least three channel subunits, α1, α2/δ, and β. The α1-subunit serves as the channel pore and voltage sensor. The intracellular β-subunit modifies the properties of the channel complex both by chaperoning the translocation of the α1-subunit to the plasma membrane and by allosteric modulation of the α1-subunit function. In cardiomyocytes, the subunit isoforms α1C (Cav1.2) and β2 constitute the channel complex (reviewed in Ref. 1Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

The carboxyl-terminal ahnak domain encompassing 1002 amino acid residues contains both nuclear localization signals and nuclear export signals that are believed to determine the subcellular distribution of ahnak (14Sussman J.

We next characterized ahnak in normal human myocardium as a peripheral membrane protein associated with the cytoplasmic side of the sarcolemma including T-tubular structures (19Hohaus A. Person V. Behlke J. Schaper J. Morano I. Haase H. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1205-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). By using truncated ahnak fragments, we demonstrated that the high affinity interaction (Kd ≈50 nm) between β2-subunit and ahnak is mediated by the most carboxyl-terminal 382 amino acids of ahnak, designated as the ahnak-C2 domain. This ahnak-C2 domain was also defined to be responsible for F-actin binding (19Hohaus A. Person V. Behlke J. Schaper J. Morano I. Haase H. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1205-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Together, the localization and interaction partner suggest a role of cardiac ahnak in the regulation of Ca2+ channel activity either directly via β2-subunit interaction or indirectly via F-actin interaction. In fact, recent studies (20Lader A.S. Kwiatkowski D.J. Cantiello H.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C1277-C1283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Nakamura M. Sunagawa M. Kosugi T. Sperelakis N. Am. J.

(Lond.). 2001; 537: 363-370Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar) revealed the cytoskeletal actin filament organization as an important regulator of the Ca2+ channel inward current.The goal of the present study was to elucidate whether ahnak affects Ca2+ channel gating properties. Small ahnak fragments were expressed encompassing the 188 carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues of human ahnak (P3, aa 5456-5556, and P4, aa 5556-5643); their effects on Ca2+ current, ICaL, were investigated under whole-cell patch clamp conditions on ventricular rat cardiomyocytes. The rationale for this approach was that we narrowed down the interaction sites between ahnak and β2-subunit to the composite ahnak protein fragment, P3-P4. Here we demonstrate for the first time that carboxyl-terminal ahnak-derived fragments modulate specific aspects of ICaL gating such as an increase in ICaL amplitude and a slowing of inactivation. Our results suggest a role of cardiac ahnak as an intrinsic regulatory protein of the L-type Ca2+ channel complex.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Plasmid DNA of human ahnak was kindly provided by Dr. Emma Shtivelman (University San Francisco). The ahnak-C2 fragment encompassing the carboxyl-terminal amino acids 5262-5463 was constructed from the plasmid z7 (10Shtivelman E. Cohen F.E. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1205-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).

The β2a-subunit was expressed as GST fusion protein as described previously (19Hohaus A. Person V. Behlke J. Schaper J. Morano I. Haase H. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1205-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The antibody against the β2-subunit was characterized previously (9Haase H. Podzuweit T. Lutsch G. Hohaus A. Kostka S.

Cell Biochem. 2000; 76: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Recombinant Ahnak Fragments—The carboxyl-terminal ahnak fragments were generated by PCR using z7 as template and the following primers: P1-P2, forward, 5′-acgtgaattctgtgatgtgaacctgccag-3′, and reverse, 5′-gatctcgagcagtttgacttcagactc-3′; P2-P3, forward, 5′-acgtgaattcgacactctaagtttg-3′, and reverse, 5′-gatctcgagaccttcaaactccagcgt-3′; P3-P4, forward, 5′-acgtgaattctctgaagtcaaactg-3′, and reverse, 5′-gatctcgagctactctttctttgt-3′; P3, forward, 5′-acgtgaattctctgaagtcaaactg-3′, and reverse, 5′-gatctcgagaccttcaaactccagcgt-3′; P4, forward, 5′-acgtgaattcggtggggaagtgtc-3′, and reverse, 5′-gatctcgagctactctttctttct-3′. EcoRI-XhoI restriction sites were incorporated into primers (underlined letters) to facilitate subsequent subcloning to EcoRI-NotI sites of the expression vector pGEX-4T1. All constructs were checked by restriction site mapping and sequencing. Expression of the GST-ahnak fragments was performed in BL21-Codon Plus (DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene). The bacteria were induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3-4 h at 37 °C. The cells were collected, and the GST-ahnak fragments were solubilized and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads as described (19Hohaus A. Person V. Behlke J. Schaper J. Morano I. Haase H. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1205-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined according to Bradford. For electrophysiological experiments, buffer constituents were removed from the ahnak fragments by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 columns (PD-10, Amersham Biosciences), and the fragments were lyophilized.Immunocapture Assay—Wells of microtiter plates (MaxiSorp, Nunc) were coated with GST-ahnak-C2 by incubating with 100 μl of a 10 μg/ml protein solution (total of 14 pmol ahnak-C2) in 50 mm NaHCO3 buffer, pH 9.6, at 4 °C overnight. The wells were blocked by incubation with 250 μl of buffer A (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 40 min and washed three times with buffer A. Incubation with the recombinant β2-subunit (14 pmol) was performed in a total volume of 100 μl of buffer A containing 1% bovine serum albumin in the absence or presence of the inhibitors (ahnak-C2, P1-P4) at room temperature for 1 h. Wells were subsequently washed twice with 200 μl of buffer A. Bound β2-subunit was monitored by immunoreaction with our β2-subunit-specific antibody (0.5 μg IgG/ml) in combination with the second peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit IgG. Quantification was done by measuring the optical density after development with o-phenylenediamine as substrate of the peroxidase. For the competition experiments, a 10-fold molar excess of ahnak-C2 or its truncation mutants, P1-P2, P3-P4, P3, or P4 was incubated with the β2a-subunit for 60 min at 4 °C prior to the incubation on wells captured by ahnak-C2.Isolation of Adult Ventricular Cardiomyocytes—Ventricular myocytes were isolated enzymatically from male Wistar rats (200-300 g) as described previously (25Delgado C. Artiles A. Gomez A.M. Vassort G. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1999; 31: 1783-1793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, excised hearts were perfused retrogradely at a constant flow of 6 ml min-1 with a nominally Ca2+-free Hepes solution (composed of (mm): 137 NaCl, 5.7 KCl, 1.5 KH2PO4, 4.4 NaHCO3, 1.7 MgCl2, 21 Hepes, 20 taurine, 10 glucose, pH 7.15, at 35-36 °C) containing collagenase (Worthington type II, 60 IU ml-1). The freshly dissociated cells were kept in the physiological solution with 0.3 mm Ca2+ and 0.5% bovine serum albumin at room temperature (23-24 °C) and used within 6-8 h. In an experimental series, cells were incubated in phalloidin (100 μm) for 5 h in this solution before attempting the patch clamp.Patch Clamp Recordings—For recording the L-type Ca2+ current (ICaL), the “whole-cell” variant of the patch clamp method was used (25Delgado C. Artiles A. Gomez A.M. Vassort G. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1999; 31: 1783-1793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 26Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15094) Google Scholar) at room temperature (22 ± 2 °C). Electrode resistance was 0.9-1.1 megohms. K+ currents were blocked by Cs+ (intracellular and extracellular; see below). The fast inward Na+ current was blocked with 50 μm tetrodotoxin. The composition of the standard extracellular solution was (mm): 117 NaCl, 20 CsCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.8 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 10 Hepes, pH 7.4. The pipette (“intracellular”) solution contained (mm): 130 CsCl, 0.4 Na2-GTP, 5 Na2-ATP, 5 Na2-creatine phosphate, 11 EGTA, 4.7 CaCl2 (free Ca2+ 108 nm); 10 Hepes; pH was adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH. In most cases, the alterations of the Ca2+ current were analyzed by comparing the quantity of charges entering the cell during a 200-ms depolarizing pulse to 0 mV after scaling to cell capacitance.Statistical Evaluation—When possible, results were analyzed by the Student's paired t test and are expressed as means ± S.D. The criterion for significance was p < 0.05.RESULTSDissection of Carboxyl-terminal Ahnak-binding Sites to the Ca2+ Channel β2-Subunit—In a recent study, we demonstrated that the carboxyl-terminal 382 amino acids of ahnak, designated as ahnak-C2, are important for the high affinity interaction with the Ca2+ channel β2-subunit (19Hohaus A. Person V. Behlke J. Schaper J. Morano I. Haase H. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1205-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To further narrow down the interaction sites, the ahnak-C2 deletion mutants depicted in Fig. 1A were expressed as GST fusion proteins: P1-P2 (aa 5255-5456), P3-P4 (aa 5456-5643), P3 (aa 5456-5556), and P4 (aa 5556-5643). These recombinant proteins showed the expected molecular masses (Fig. 1B).The β2-subunit binding of the carboxyl-terminal ahnak fusion proteins was studied in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based competition approach. For this purpose recombinant rabbit cardiac β2a-subunit was bound to ahnak-C2 captured onto microtiter plates in the absence and presence of the carboxyl-terminal ahnak fusion proteins. The binding was monitored by immunoreaction with an anti-β2-subunit-specific antibody (Fig. 1C). As expected, the binding of β2a-subunit to captured ahnak-C2 was efficiently prevented by the inclusion of a 10-fold molar excess of ahnak-C2 in the binding assay. In contrast, inclusion of the P1-P2 truncation mutant as competitor reduced the β2-subunit binding only marginally, indicating that this portion does not confer ahnak-C2-β2-subunit interaction. Consistent with this result, the carboxyl-terminal truncate P3-P4 efficiently inhibited the interaction (Fig. 1C). The P3 and P4 ahnak carboxyl-terminal domains resulted in partial competition of the β2-subunit interaction. Taken together, these results define binding sites to the Ca2+ channel β2-subunit in both carboxyl-terminal ahnak sub-fragments P3 and P4.Effects of Ahnak Fragments on Ca2+ Current—Cardiac myocytes were investigated under whole-cell patch clamp conditions using a pipette solution that was added with 10 μm of one of the short carboxyl-terminal sequences of ahnak P3, P4, or P3-P4, or with GST as a control, such a concentration was far above the apparent Kd of 50 nm for binding to ahnak-C2 domain. The intracellular perfusion of a cell with a pipette solution that contained the combined P3-P4 ahnak protein fragment induced a slowly developing increase in peak ICaL elicited at 0 mV and reached a maximum within about 3-4 min, a time needed for diffusion of the internal pipette solution. ICaL inactivation kinetics were simultaneously modified showing an increase in both τf and τs, the fast and slow time constants that described the two components of ICaL inactivation (Fig. 2A). The results of similar experiments with adding 10 μm GST, P3, P4, or P3-P4 ahnak protein fragments are summarized in Fig. 2B (see also Table I). The addition of GST had no effect on ICaL amplitude and kinetics. Thus in some cases, data are pooled results of about the same number of cells investigated in control conditions or with GST-added pipette solution. Added at 10 μm, P4 had a significant positive effect on ICaL amplitude that was increased by 22.7 ± 5.0% from a control value of 13.2 ± 1.1 pA/pF (n = 23, 16; p < 0.01). The combined ahnak fragment P3-P4 also significantly increased peak ICaL by 34.8 ± 7.1%, whereas fragment P3 had no significant effect. All fragments significantly slowed down both the fast and slow components of ICaL inactivation except P4 that did not significantly alter the fast component of inactivation (Table I). Altogether, in the presence of one of the ahnak protein fragments, the increase in current amplitude or slowing of its inactivation led to a 50% increase in the amount of charges carried by Ca2+ (see also Fig. 3).Fig. 2Carboxyl-terminal ahnak fragments increased Ca2+ current and slowed its kinetics.

However, a detailed study of the activation and inactivation parameters indicates that in the presence of P4 and P3-P4, half-activation but not half-inactivation was shifted leftward by about 4 mV, although this effect did not reach significance (Table I). The β-adrenergic stimulatory effects of isoprenaline (ISO, 1 μm) on ICaL, which include increases in ICa amplitude and τf and a leftward shift in voltage dependence, were not significantly affected by the presence of the ahnak fragments except for a significant prolongation of the fast inactivation phase by P4 and P3-P4, such that the quantity of entering Ca2+ charges could then be increased up to nearly 3-fold in all three experimental conditions (Fig. 3; Table I)The actin-stabilizing agents, a 5-h incubation with 100-μm phalloidin as well as the acute application of 10 μm jasplakinolide did not modify the effects of the two P3 and P4 fragments on ICaL amplitude or inactivation kinetics, upon a depolarization at 0 mV in control conditions as well as in the presence of isoprenaline (not shown).Effects of Ahnak Protein Fragments on Voltage-dependent Ca2+ Current Facilitation—High voltage pre-depolarizing steps are inducing a partial recovery from inactivation or voltage-dependent facilitation of ICaL that is accompanied by a slowing of ICaL inactivation kinetics. ICaL voltage-dependent facilitation had similar relative amplitude in each experimental condition with pipette solution containing 10 μm GST, P3, P4, or P3-P4 fragment. Voltage-dependent facilitation was not affected by ISO (not shown). The changes in current inactivation kinetics were further analyzed following a depolarizing prepulse to +60 mV (Fig. 4). The depolarizing prepulse induced an increase in both τf and τs characterizing current inactivation during the test pulse to 0 mV. Nevertheless, τs was further increased in the presence of each ahnak fragment, and the effect was slightly more marked in the presence of isoprenaline.Fig. 4Voltage-dependent facilitation of ICaL in the presence of carboxyl-terminal ahnak fragments. The voltage-dependent facilitation of ICaL was altered by the carboxyl-terminal ahnak fragments. Bar graph shows that P3, P4, and P3-P4 peptides increased τf and τs, the time constant of the fast and slow inactivation components of ICaL recorded at 0 mV after a depolarizing pre-pulse to +60 mV. These effects were similar after β-adrenergic stimulation (ISO, 1 μm). n = 12, 8, 11, 12, and 4 in control conditions or in the presence of 10 μm GST, P3, P4, or P3-P4 fragment. * and **, p < 0.01 in the absence or presence of ISO, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effects of Ahnak Protein Fragment on Use-dependent Ca2+ Current Facilitation—In rat cardiomyocytes, use-dependent facilitation that leads to an increased Ca2+ influx is mostly attributable to a slowing of the fast inactivation phase that is maximal after the 4th or 5th pulse. This effect is dependent on reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum-Ca2+ release with increasing stimulation frequency and is suppressed by β-adrenergic stimulation (25Delgado C. Artiles A. Gomez A.M. Vassort G. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1999; 31: 1783-1793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 27Guo J. Duff H.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 547: 797-805Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The effects of the three ahnak fragments were investigated on use-dependent facilitation by varying the basal stimulation frequency of the 0-mV depolarizing test from 0.25 to 2 Hz after a 15-s rest period and analyzing changes in the two inactivation phases of ICaL. The use-dependent increase in τf seen during facilitation was not observed in the presence of P3 and of P3-P4 that had already increased τf. There was no effect of P4 on τf. There was also no significant effect of these ahnak fragments on τs.DISCUSSIONThis study demonstrates that carboxyl-terminal ahnak protein fragments modulate Ca2+ channel properties. Reversible"

Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) was previously shown to inhibit expression of murine α1(I) and human α2(I) collagen promoters. The present study identifies binding of NF-κB, present in nuclear extracts of stellate cells, to a region between -553 and -537 of the murine α2(I) collagen promoter. The NF-κB (p65) expression vector inhibited promoter activity. Mutation of the promoter at the NF-κB-binding site increased basal promoter activity and abrogated the activating and inhibitory effects of transforming growth factor β and tumor necrosis factor α, respectively, on promoter activity. Acetaldehyde increased IκB-α kinase activity and phosphorylated IκB-α, NF-κB nuclear protein, and its binding to the promoter. However, the activating effect of acetaldehyde was not affected by the mutation of the promoter. In conclusion, although acetaldehyde increases the binding of NF-κB to the murine α2(I) collagen promoter, this binding does not mediate the activating effect of acetaldehyde on promoter activity. The effects of acetaldehyde in increasing the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus with increased DNA binding activity may be important in mediating the effects of acetaldehyde on other genes.

The most abundant form of collagen deposited in hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis is type I collagen, which is composed of two α1(I) and one α2(I) polypeptide chains (1Rojkind M.

Acetaldehyde, the product of ethanol oxidation, increases α1(I) and α2(I) collagen gene transcription and messages as well as type I collagen production by cultured stellate cells (10Holt K.

In previous studies, we showed that acetaldehyde enhances the activity of the murine α2(I) collagen promoter in stellate cells and that this effect is mediated by increased binding of nuclear proteins including nuclear factor I to region -315 to -295 of the promoter (12Anania F.A. Potter J.J. Rennie-Tankersley L. Mezey E. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 1640-1648PubMed Google Scholar). Although Sp1 is important in maintaining basal activity of the α2(I) collagen promoter, it plays no role in mediating the effects of acetaldehyde (14Miao K. Potter J.J. Rennie-Tankersley L. Mezey E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 341: 140-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Acetaldehyde was shown to enhance binding of NF-κB of nuclear extract from HepG2 cells to the NF-κB consensus sequence in one study (15Roman J. Gimenez A. Lluis J.M. Gasso M. Rubio M. Caballeria J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 14684-14690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), whereas in another study, acetaldehyde inhibited lipopolysaccharide-stimulated DNA binding of NF-κB by nuclear extracts from Kuppfer cells (16Jokelainen K. Thomas P. Lindros K. Nanji A.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 834-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Upon analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the murine α2(I) collagen promoter, we found the presence of a NF-κB-binding motif (5′-ACTGGGGAAATTAGGGG-3′) at -553 to -537 from the start of transcription. The purpose of this study was to determine the regulatory role of NF-κB on the α2(I) collagen promoter and the effect of acetaldehyde on the regulation. Animals and Materials—Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). All of the animals received humane care in compliance with the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Johns Hopkins University. TNF-α and TGF-β1 were obtained from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum, agarose, and the restriction enzymes XbaI and HindIII were purchased from Invitrogen. Plastic tissue culture flasks were purchased from BD Biosciences. [α-32P]dATP, [α-32P]dCTP, and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Acetaldehyde was from Fisher. Plasmids—The plasmid pAZ1009, which contains a 2.0-kb region of the mouse α2(I) collagen promoter, was provided by Dr. Benoit de Crombrugghe from the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX). The luciferase construct of the α2(I) collagen promoter (pGL3-1009) was made by inserting the 2.0-kb promoter into the HindIII site of the pGL3 enhancer vector as described previously (13Anania F.A. Potter J.J. Rennie-Tankersley L. Mezey E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 331: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The NF-κB expression vectors RSV-NF-κB (p50) and RSV-Rel (p65) and the empty vector k1 were obtained from Prof. Guidalberto Manfioletti (University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Oligonucleotides containing 2-bp substitutions were designed for site-directed mutagenesis. The method employed for the mutagenesis of the pGL3-1009 promoter was based on the strategy of overlap extension using PCR as described by Ho et al. (17Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6810) Google Scholar). The DNA sequencing facility of our Department of Biological Chemistry confirmed successful mutations. Isolation and Culture of Hepatic Stellate Cells—Rats weighing ∼400 g were used in the procedure of hepatic stellate cell isolation, as described previously (13Anania F.A. Potter J.J. Rennie-Tankersley L. Mezey E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 331: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The procedure follows the method of Friedman and Roll (18Friedman S.L. Roll F.J. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) except for the use of a Nycodenz gradient. In brief, the stellate cells were isolated in situ by the perfusion of the portal vein under sterile conditions sequentially with 0.2% Pronase E and 0.015% collagenase in DMEM. The liver cell suspension obtained was centrifuged at 1400 × g in a two-step discontinuous Nycodenz gradient. The isolated cells were suspended in DMEM and seeded in 25-cm2 tissue culture flasks maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, fungizone (2.5 μg/ml), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C with a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. The medium was changed every 48 h, while the cells transformed into activated cells after 10-14 days in culture. Nuclear Protein Extraction—Nuclear extracts from cultured stellate cells were prepared as described previously (19Potter J.J. Mezey E. Christy R.J. Crabb D.W. Stein P.M. Yang V.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 285: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The nuclear protein extracts were aliquoted and stored under nitrogen at -80 °C. The protein content of the nuclear extracts was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—The sequence of the wild-type oligonucleotide, corresponding to region -553 to -537 of the α2(I) collagen promoter, used initially for EMSA was 5′-ACTGGGGAAATTAGGGG-3′. Mutated oligonucleotides, which contained 2-bp nucleotide substitutions, are shown in the legend to Fig. 2. Complimentary strands of each oligonucleotide were annealed, and the double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with [α-32P]dATP and [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow enzyme according to the method of Feinberg and Vogelstein (21Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16646) Google Scholar). DNA-protein binding reactions were performed following the previously described EMSA procedure (22Potter J.J. Cheneval D. Dang C.V. Resar L.M.S. Mezey E. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15457-15463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts from stellate cells were incubated with the labeled oligonucleotide probes (2.5-25 fmol) at room temperature for 30 min in 25 μl of reaction buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 10% glycerol. The competition assays were performed by incubating molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides for 30 min with nuclear proteins prior to the addition of labeled oligonucleotide probes. For “supershift” EMSA experiments, rabbit polyclonal antibodies to NF-κB (p65) and to NF-κB (p50) obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) were used. These antibodies were added separately to the reaction at the completion of DNA-protein binding and incubated for an additional 30 min at room temperature. The resultant samples were resolved on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualized on x-ray film. Transient Transfections and Luciferase Assay—Activated stellate cells, after no more than three passages, cultured in DMEM containing 20% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and fungizone (2.5 μg/ml) were grown until they were 60% confluent. Each cell culture flask was transfected with 5 μg of pGL3-1009 using calcium phosphate precipitation (23Graham F.L. Van der E.b.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6483) Google Scholar). Where expression vectors were used, the controls were transfected with the empty k1 vector, and the total DNA quantities added to each flask were balanced by the addition of sheared salmon sperm DNA. Transfection efficiency was determined by co-transfection of 0.4 μg of the Renilla luciferase vector pRL-CMV (Promega). Four h after transfecting, the cells were washed twice with DMEM and then shocked with 10% (IH3)2SO for 3 min. The cells were then returned to DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For the experiments with acetaldehyde, the medium was changed after 1 h to serum-free DMEM containing the following six supplemental growth factors: epidermal growth factor (10 μg/liter), transferrin (0.5 mg/liter), selenous acid (5 μg/liter), linoleic acid (0.5 mg/liter), bovine serum albumin (0.5 mg/liter), and fetuin (0.5 mg/liter). The acetaldehyde was added to a final concentration of 200 μm, and the flasks were tightly capped. The cells were spiked with acetaldehyde at 12-h intervals for a total treatment time of 40 h. The cells were harvested 40-44 h after transfection and exposed to one freeze-thaw cycle in reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was determined and normalized to Renilla luciferase activity using the dual luciferase assay system of Promega. Western Blot Analysis—The cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 400 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin for 1 h at 4 °C and cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The total protein from the cell lysates was separated on mini-SDS gels at 100 V for 1 h and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Hybond-P; Amersham Biosciences) at 100 V for 1 h. The membranes were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.6, containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and subsequently blocked with 5% (w/v) dried nonfat milk in PBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to NF-κB (p50), NF-κB (p65), IκB-α, IκB-β, phosphorylated IκB-α, IKK-α, and IKK-β (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight. After repeated washing, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000 dilution; Amersham Biosciences) at room temperature for 1 h. The membranes then were washed again and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (ECL Plus; Amersham Biosciences). Ultraviolet Cross-linking of Nuclear Proteins to Oligonucleotides and Immunoblot Analysis—The binding of nuclear proteins to the oligonucleotide probe was performed as for EMSA. Reactions using 8 μg of nuclear protein and 50 fmol of the radioactively labeled oligonucleotide were used. Following the binding reaction, UV cross-linking was performed as described previously (24Potter J.J. Mezey E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 391: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The membranes were then incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody to NF-κB (p50) and NF-κB (p65) (1:200 dilution) for 1 h. After repeated washing for 1 h, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1: 50,000 dilution; Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. The membranes were again washed for 1 h and then immersed in lumigen PS-3 acridan substrate solution (ECL Plus; Amersham Biosciences) for 5 min. The antigens were visualized by exposing the membrane to x-ray film. IκB Kinase Assay—IκB-α kinase activity was determined by the method of Mercurio et al. (25Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A Bennett B.L. Li J.W. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1841) Google Scholar). The cytosolic protein was incubated with antibody to IKK-α overnight. Twenty μl of protein A-Sepharose (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA) was then added. Following a 2-h incubation, with gentle rocking, the antigen-antibody-protein A-Sepharose complex was precipitated, washed, and then assayed for kinase activity. The reaction mixture for the kinase activity consisted of 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 300 μm Na3VO4, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 μm ATP, and 2 μg of GST-IκB-α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The total volume of reaction mixture was 25 μl. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by boiling with 5 μl of 6× SDS sample buffer for 5 min. The protein was resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. The gel was dried, and the radioactive bands were visualized by phosphorimaging. Statistical Analysis—The data were analyzed with the Student's t test when appropriate or by two-way analysis of variance when comparing the means of more than two groups. Nuclear Factor κB Binds to the Murine α2(I) Collagen Promoter, and This Binding Activity Is Increased by TNF-α—Increased nuclear protein binding to the oligonucleotide specifying the wild-type -553 to -537 region of the α2(I) collagen promoter is shown in Fig. 1A. The nuclear protein binding is competed away by a 100-fold molar excess of the cold oligonucleotide. Antibodies to NF-κB (p50) and to NF-κB (p65) resulted in the appearance of supershifted bands (Fig. 1B). Only the antibody of NF-κB (p50) resulted in the complete disappearance of nuclear protein binding. A mutational analysis of the NF-κB-binding site of the α2(I) collagen promoter was performed by EMSA of protein-DNA complex formed with labeled oligonucleotides that were sequentially mutated by 2 base pairs between -550 and -537 (Fig. 2). This analysis revealed that the 2-bp mutation of the oligonucleotide M2 or of the oligonucleotide M3 eliminates the upper protein-DNA complex. The 2-bp mutation of oligonucleotide M6 results in a decrease in the upper protein-DNA complex. Thereafter the α2(I) collagen promoter (pGL3-1009) was mutated by the 2-bp mutation of the M2 oligonucleotide and named pGL3-1009mut. Exposure of the stellate cells to TNF-α (0.6 nm) for 30 min resulted in an increase in the upper protein-DNA complexes formed by nuclear extracts with the wild-type NF-κB oligonucleotide (Fig. 3, lane 3). Antibody to NF-κB (p65) results in a decrease in the upper complex formed in the presence of 7 μg of NE (lane 5) and in the appearance of a supershifted complexes when the NE concentration used in the EMSA was increased to 12 μg (lanes 8 and 9). TNF-α increased NF-κB (p65) but not NF-κB (p50) protein in nuclear extracts of the stellate cells (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Immunoblot blot of the effects of TNF-α (T) on nuclear NF-κB (p50) and NF-κB (p65) proteins in NE of rat stellate cells.

The NF-κB (p65) expression vector resulted in the inhibition of the activity of pGL3-1009 (p < 0.05) (Table I), whereas the NF-κB (p50) expression vector had no effect. The combination of the NF-κB (p65) and NF-κB (p50) expression vectors caused inhibition of pGL3-1009 activity (p < 0.05) similar to that observed with NF-κB (p65) expression vector alone. The basal activity of the transfected pGL3-1009mut was greater than the activity of the wild-type pGL3-1009 (p < 0.01). NF-κB (p65) alone or NF-κB (p50) alone had no significant effect on pGL3-1009mut, but the combination of NF-κB (p65) and NF-κB (p50) resulted in a paradoxical increase in the activity of pGL3-1009mut (p < 0.05).Table IEffects of the NF-κB (p50) and NF-κB (p65) expression vectors on the activity of pGL3-1009 and pGL3-1009mut in transfected stellate cellsExpression vectorLuciferase activity expressed as a percentage of the wild-type promoteraThe mean pGL3-1009 luciferase activity was 12,184 relative light units/mg of protein.pGL3-1009pGL3-1009mutControl100 ± 13188 ± 25bp < 0.01 as compared with wild-type pGL3-1009 control.RSV NF-κB (p50)98 ± 8249 ± 48RSV NF-κB (p65)61 ± 3cp < 0.05 as compared with wild-type pGL3-1009 control.255 ± 26RSV-NF-κB (p50) + RSVNF-κB (p65)62 ± 4cp < 0.05 as compared with wild-type pGL3-1009 control.271 ± 17dp < 0.05 as compared with pGL3-1009mut.a The mean pGL3-1009 luciferase activity was 12,184 relative light units/mg of protein.b p < 0.01 as compared with wild-type pGL3-1009 control.c p < 0.05 as compared with wild-type pGL3-1009 control.d p < 0.05 as compared with pGL3-1009mut.

Open table in a new tab This study demonstrates that NF-κB binds to a novel site in the murine α2(I) collagen promoter and that binding to this site results in inhibition of promoter activity. Prior studies have shown that NF-κB binds and inhibits the murine α1(I) (8Rippe R.A. Schrum L.W. Stefanovic B. Solis Herruzo J.A. Brenner D.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 10: 751-761Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and human α2(I) collagen promoters (9Kouba D.J. Chung K.Y. Nishiyama T. Vindevoghel L. Kon A. Klement J.F. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4226-4234PubMed Google Scholar). TNF-α is well known to activate latent NF-κB by degradation of IκB inhibitory cytoplasmic retention proteins, leading to it nuclear translocation and gene activation (26Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar). In this study, TNF-α increased NF-κB (p65) protein and binding to the newly described NF-κB-binding site in the murine α2(I) collagen promoter and inhibited the activity of the transfected promoter in stellate cells. Previously, TNF-α had been shown to increase NF-κB binding activity to the murine α1(I) (8Rippe R.A. Schrum L.W. Stefanovic B. Solis Herruzo J.A. Brenner D.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 10: 751-761Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and to the human α2(I) (9Kouba D.J. Chung K.Y. Nishiyama T. Vindevoghel L. Kon A. Klement J.F. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4226-4234PubMed Google Scholar) collagen promoters, resulting in depressed collagen gene expression (8Rippe R.A. Schrum L.W. Stefanovic B. Solis Herruzo J.A. Brenner D.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 10: 751-761Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 9Kouba D.J. Chung K.Y. Nishiyama T. Vindevoghel L. Kon A. Klement J.F. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4226-4234PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β1 is a strong stimulator of the production of extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen and fibronectin (27Penttinen R.P. Kobayashi S. Bornstein P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1105-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The activation by TGF-β of the α2(I) collagen promoter in this study required NF-κB binding to the newly described binding site, because activation was abrogated by mutation of this binding site. This finding was surprising because TGF-β was shown to regulate the human α2(I) collagen promoter principally through the cellular Smad signal transduction pathway (28Ghosh A.K. Yuan W. Mori Y. Chen S.J. Varga J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11041-11048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). However, it has become apparent that the receptor-activated Smads regulate transcription in the context of other transcription factors such as Sp1 (29Zhang W. Ou J. Inagaki Y. Greenwel P. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39237-39245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and that in addition other signaling pathways including the RAS pathway may play a role as mediators of the effect of TGF-β (30Roberts A.B. Cytokine Growth Factors Rev. 2002; 13: 3-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in one recent study, TGF-β was shown to increase NF-κB binding in nuclear extracts from cultured fibroblast-like synoviocytes to a consensus NF-κB oligonucleotide (31Cheon H. Yu S.J. Yoo D.H. Chae I.J. Song G.G. Sohn J. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2002; 127: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Acetaldehyde increased nuclear NF-κB (p65) protein in stellate cells and its binding to the murine α2(I) collagen. NF-κB is usually present as a heterodimer of two proteins and p65 and p50 subunits. In the cytoplasm, NF-κB is bound to IκB-α and IκB-β, which when phosphorylated by kinases are degraded, causing a release of NF-κB, which then translocates to the nucleus where it binds to target genes (32Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4057) Google Scholar). The effects of acetaldehyde in increasing IκB-α kinase activity and phosphorylated IκB-α indicate that acetaldehyde enhances the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus by increasing the degradation of IκB-α. Previous studies of the effects of acetaldehyde on NF-κB binding to a consensus sequence NF-κB oligonucleotide gave contradictory results. In one study using lipopolysaccharide-stimulated Kupffer cells, acetaldehyde increased cytosolic IκB-α protein and nuclear protein NF-κB DNA binding (16Jokelainen K. Thomas P. Lindros K. Nanji A.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 834-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), whereas in another study with HepG2 cells, acetaldehyde decreased IκB-α protein and increased nuclear protein NF-κB DNA binding (15Roman J. Gimenez A. Lluis J.M. Gasso M. Rubio M. Caballeria J. Pares A. Rodes J. Fernadez-Checa J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14684-14690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although our study demonstrates that acetaldehyde increases the binding of NF-κB to a specific site in the α2(I) collagen promoter, this binding site does not mediate the activating effect of acetaldehyde on promoter activity, because the activation was not affected by mutation of the NF-κB-binding site. The effects of acetaldehyde in increasing the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus with changes in its DNA binding activity may be important in mediating the effects of acetaldehyde on other genes. The effects of acetaldehyde on type I collagen regulation may be partially mediated by TGF-β. Acetaldehyde was shown increase secretion of TGF-β by stellate cells and to increase expression of the type II TGF-β receptor (33Chen A. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Neutralizing antibody to TGF-β decreased acetaldehyde-induced augmentation of the mouse α2(I) collagen mRNA in stellate cells (13Anania F.A. Potter J.J. Rennie-Tankersley L. Mezey E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 331: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Also, neutralizing antibodies to TGF-β or to the type II TGF-β receptor as well as antisense type II TGF-β receptor resulted in partial blockage of the activating effect of acetaldehyde on the rat α1(I) collagen promoter (27Penttinen R.P. Kobayashi S. Bornstein P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1105-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The regulation of the type I collagens involves various transcription factors binding to proximal TGF-β-responsive elements. In previous studies, we showed that acetaldehyde enhances the activity of the α2(I) collagen promoter in stellate cells and that this effect is mediated by increased binding of nuclear proteins, including nuclear factor I to a region, which is located in the TGF-β-responsive element (12Anania F.A. Potter J.J. Rennie-Tankersley L. Mezey E. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 1640-1648PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of Sp1, by contrast, was not affected by acetaldehyde (14Miao K. Potter J.J. Rennie-Tankersley L. Mezey E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 341: 140-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In studies with the mouse α1(I) collagen promoter, it was found that the activating effect of acetaldehyde was mediated by increased binding of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β to a region that overlaps with the TGF-β-responsive element (34Greenwel P. Dominguez-Rosales J.A. Mavi G. Rivas-Estilla M. Rojkind M. Hepatology. 2000; 31: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 35Attard F.A. Wang L. Potter J.J. Rennie-Tankersley L. Mezey E. DNA Cell Biol. 2001; 20: 445-463Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar), but in this case, the activating effect of acetaldehyde was not modified by neutralizing antibody to TGF-β (34Greenwel P. Dominguez-Rosales J.A. Mavi G. Rivas-Estilla M. Rojkind M. Hepatology. 2000; 31: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In conclusion, this study shows that NF-κB binds to a novel site in the murine α2(I) collagen promoter and that binding to this site results in inhibition of promoter activity. Acetaldehyde increases the translocation to the nucleus and the binding of NF-κB to the promoter by increasing the phosphorylation-dependent degradation of IκB-α. This increased NF-κB binding, however, plays no role in the activating effect of acetaldehyde on the activity of this collagen promoter. The effects of acetaldehyde in increasing the binding activity of NF-κB to DNA may be important in the regulation of other genes."

In this study, we utilized various LAB Tyr to Phe mutants to map the phosphorylation and Grb2-binding sites of LAB. We also examined the function of these mutants by investigating their ability to rescue signaling defects in LAT-deficient Jurkat cells and thymocyte development in LAT–/– mice. Our results indicated that human LAB was primarily phosphorylated on three membrane-distal tyrosines, Tyr136, Tyr193, and Tyr233. Mutation of these three tyrosines abolished Grb2 binding and LAB function. Our data suggested that these tyrosines are the most important tyrosines for LAB function.

A LAT deficiency in mice also severely affects thymocyte development (13Zhang W. Sommers C.L. Burshtyn D.N. Stebbins C.C. DeJarnette J.B. Trible R.P. Grinberg A. Tsay H.C. Jacobs H.M. Kessler C.M.

Thymocyte development in LAT–/– mice is arrested at the CD4–CD8– stage, leading to the absence of mature T cells in the periphery. Among the nine conserved tyrosine residues in LAT, the four membrane-distal tyrosines (Tyr132, Tyr171, Tyr191, and Tyr226 in human LAT) are crucial for LAT phosphorylation, its interaction with Grb2, Gads, and PLC-γ1, and LAT function in T cell activation and development (25Lin J.

Interestingly, LAT knock-in mutant mice expressing a LAT mutant that does not bind PLC-γ1 (LATY136F) develop a severe autoimmune disease with lymphocyte infiltration in various organs, suggesting that the LAT interaction with PLC-γ1 is important in normal T cell function and homeostasis (28Sommers C.L.

During a search for a LAT-like molecule in B cells, a novel membrane-associated adaptor molecule, NTAL (non-T cell activation linker)/LAB (linker for activation of B cells), was identified (30Brdicka T. Imrich M. Angelisova P. Brdickova N. Horvath O. Spicka J. Hilgert I. Luskova P. Draber P. Novak P. Engels N. Wienands J. Simeoni L. Osterreicher J. Aguado E. Malissen M. Schraven B. Horejsi V. J.

Immunol. 2003; 4: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Similar to LAT, this molecule is localized to lipid rafts. Upon B cell receptor (BCR) or Fc receptor cross-linking, LAB is phosphorylated and associates with the adaptor protein Grb2. The cytoplasmic domain of LAB contains nine tyrosines conserved between mouse and human. Five of these tyrosines are within a Grb2-binding motif (Tyr95, Tyr118, Tyr136, Tyr193, and Tyr233); however, there is no apparent PLC-γ1 or -γ2-binding motif, and LAB does not bind PLC-γ1 or -γ2. The functional similarity between LAT and LAB was demonstrated by an adoptive transfer experiment in which LAB could rescue thymocyte development in LAT–/– mice (31Janssen E. Zhu M. Zhang W. Koonpaew S. Zhang W. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In this study, we generated a series of LAB mutants with tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations and stably expressed them in a mouse B cell line to map the phosphorylation and Grb2-binding sites of LAB. We also examined the function of these mutant proteins by determining their ability to rescue signaling defects in LAT-deficient Jurkat cells and reconstitute thymocyte development in LAT–/– mice. Our results indicated that the three membrane-distal tyrosines are the most important tyrosines in LAB function. Constructs—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to mutate tyrosine residues in human LAB to phenylalanine by PCR. LAB mutants with combinations of different mutations were constructed by assembling cDNA fragments of the single Tyr to Phe mutants using restriction endonuclease sites present in the LAB cDNA or created during mutagenesis. Two retroviral vectors, pMSCV-IRES/Bla (blasticidin-resistant gene) and pMSCV-IRES/GFP (green fluorescent protein), were used in our experiments. In these two vectors, expression of LAT or LAB was driven by the 5′ long terminal repeat. The blasticidin resistance and GFP genes were placed under the control of an IRES (internal ribosomal entry site) element. LAB mutants used in this study are listed in Fig. 1. pMSCV-IRES/Bla viruses were used to transduce A20 cells (murine B cell line) to generate stable cell lines, whereas pMSCV-IRES/GFP viruses were primarily used to transduce bone marrow cells from LAT–/– mice in the adoptive transfer experiment and for transient expression of LAB in the LAT-deficient Jurkat cells. Accession Numbers—Pig, cow, and chicken LAB protein sequences were obtained by translating expressed sequence tag (EST) clones. The GenBank™ accession numbers of EST clones are BF078123 and BE231818 for pig, AW487463, BF890213, and BE755183 for cow, and BU242463 for chicken. Cell Lines, Transfection, and Retroviral Transduction—A20 cells and LAT-deficient cells (J.CaM2.5) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and Phoenix ecotropic virus-packaging cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. LAT-deficient Jurkat cells expressing the ecotropic receptor mCAT-1 were described previously (26Zhu M. Janssen E. Zhang W. J. Immunol. 2003; 17: 325-333Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A total of 15 μg of each retroviral construct was used to transfect Phoenix ecotropic packaging cells using calcium phosphate. Forty-eight to seventy-two hours after transfection, the cell culture supernatant containing recombinant retroviruses was harvested either for immediate viral transduction or to be frozen at –80 °C. A20 and J.CaM2.5 cells expressing various LAB mutants were generated by transducing these cells with recombinant retroviruses followed by selection in the presence of blasticidin (10 μg/ml). Antibodies, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—The following antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting: anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA); anti-TCR (C305); anti-myc (9E10); rabbit anti-LAB antisera and mouse monoclonal anti-LAB (31Janssen E. Zhu M. Zhang W. Koonpaew S. Zhang W. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar); anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) and anti-Grb2 monoclonal antibodies (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY); anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) and rabbit anti-LATpY191(Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY); rabbit anti-Grb2 polyclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); and anti-phospho-Erk (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). For immunoprecipitation, A20 cells expressing different LAB mutants were either stimulated with anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 (20 μg/ml) for 1.5 min or left untreated. A total of 1 × 107 cells were lysed in 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Brij-97, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4) with protease inhibitors. Postnuclear lysates were immunoprecipitated with different antibodies as indicated in each figure. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved on the SDS-PAGE and blotted with different antibodies as indicated in each figure. MAPK Activation and Ca2+ Flux—Intracellular free Ca2+ measurements were performed as described previously (32Williams B.L. Schreiber K.L. Zhang W. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Leibson P.J. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1388-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Twelve to sixteen hours after retroviral transduction, J.CaM2.5 cells were loaded with Indo-1. Anti-CD3ϵ (OKT3) was used to activate these cells. Ca2+ flux in GFP+ cells was analyzed using flow cytometry (FACStar, BD Biosciences) to monitor the fluorescence emission ratio at 405–495 nm. Transduction of Bone Marrow Cells and Adoptive Transfer—Bone marrow cell transduction and adoptive transfer were performed as described previously (26Zhu M. Janssen E. Zhang W. J. Immunol. 2003; 17: 325-333Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, bone marrow cells from LAT–/– mice were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 15% fetal bovine serum in the presence of interleukin (IL)-3, IL-6, and stem cell factor for 3–4 days. They were then mixed with retroviral supernatant in the presence of polybrene (8 μg/ml) and centrifuged at 1300 × g for 3 h at 22 °C. After culturing for 24 h, these cells were transduced again by retroviruses and cultured for 2 days before injection into mice. A total of 0.5–1 × 106 cells were injected via a tail vein into LAT–/– mice that were sublethally irradiated at 5Gy. Flow Cytometric Analysis—Five to six weeks after adoptive transfer, thymocytes and splenocytes were prepared from adoptively transferred mice. After removal of red blood cells, these cells were stained with the following antibodies: biotin-conjugated anti-TCRβ and B220; phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD4, CD25, and IgM; APC-conjugated anti-CD4 and CD8; and phycoerythrin-Cy5-conjugated anti-CD44. Each sample was further analyzed on the FACStar cytometer. Transfection of LAB Mutants into Murine A20 B Cell Line—In the cytoplasmic domain of LAB, there are nine tyrosine residues conserved between mouse and human (30Brdicka T. Imrich M. Angelisova P. Brdickova N. Horvath O. Spicka J. Hilgert I. Luskova P. Draber P. Novak P. Engels N. Wienands J. Simeoni L. Osterreicher J. Aguado E. Malissen M. Schraven B. Horejsi V. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 31Janssen E. Zhu M. Zhang W. Koonpaew S. Zhang W. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Five of these tyrosines are within a Grb2-binding motif (95YQNF98, 118YYNW121, 136YENV139, 193YQNS196, and 233YVNG236 in human LAB) and can potentially bind Grb2 once phosphorylated. Although previous studies have shown that LAB is phosphorylated upon BCR ligation, it has not been determined which of these tyrosines are phosphorylated in vivo and which of them are required for the LAB-Grb2 association. To answer these questions, we generated LAB mutants with mutations at each tyrosine and mutants with combinations of different Tyr to Phe mutations of the three membrane-distal tyrosines (Fig. 1). These mutants together with wild type (WT)-LAB were introduced into the A20 murine B cell line by retroviral transduction. Stable transductants were selected in the presence of blasticidin and were used for further analysis without subcloning to avoid differences among subclones. As shown in Fig. 2A, all the cell lines expressing WT and mutant LAB were well matched for LAB expression. Establishment of these stable cell lines enabled us to examine whether BCR-mediated phosphorylation of LAB was affected by these mutations. The transduced A20 cells were stimulated with anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 for 1.5 min before lysis. LAB protein was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with rabbit anti-LAB. Tyrosine phosphorylation of LAB was determined by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine. As shown in Fig. 2B, WT-LAB was heavily phosphorylated after BCR stimulation. Mutation at Tyr58, Tyr84, Tyr110, or Tyr118 did not affect phosphorylation of LAB, suggesting that these tyrosine residues might not be phosphorylated upon BCR stimulation. Although mutation at Tyr95 or Tyr136 only slightly reduced phosphorylation of LAB, mutation at Tyr193 or Tyr233 caused a significant decrease in phosphorylation when compared with WT-LAB. Among the mutants with a single Tyr to Phe mutation, the Y233F mutant was least phosphorylated. In addition, combinations of the Y233F mutation with mutation at other tyrosines, such as 2YF2 or 2YF4, also caused a dramatic reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation of LAB. Mutations of three membrane-distal tyrosines (Tyr136, Tyr193, and Tyr233)or four tyrosines (Tyr95, Tyr136, Tyr193, and Tyr233) almost totally abolished LAB tyrosine phosphorylation. These data indicated that the three membrane-distal tyrosines, Tyr136, Tyr193, and Tyr233, are the primary phosphorylation sites. We also examined phosphorylation of LAB using rabbit antisera that recognize phosphorylated LAT pTyr191. LAT Tyr191 is within the sequence context of YVNV similar to that of LAB Tyr233 (YVNG). Thus, it is possible that this phospho-LAT antibody could also recognize phosphorylated LAB. Postnuclear lysates of different stable cell lines were immunoblotted with this antisera. As shown in Fig. 2C, anti-LAT pTyr191 sera did not detect LAB in unstimulated A20 transfectants but did recognize WT-LAB and mutants containing Tyr233 (Y136F, Y193F, 2YF1, and 2YF3) upon BCR stimulation. Furthermore, it failed to detect mutants that contained a mutated Tyr233 (Y233F, 2YF2, 2YF4, 3YF, and 4YF), suggesting that the antisera specifically recognized phospho-Tyr233 in LAB. This finding further supported the data from Fig. 2B and indicated that Tyr233 of LAB is phosphorylated upon BCR stimulation. Interestingly, mutation of Tyr136 in LAB as in Y136F and 2YF3 enhanced phosphorylation of LAB at Tyr233 upon BCR stimulation when compared with wild-type (Fig. 2C). It is possible that Tyr136 negatively regulates LAB phosphorylation at Tyr233. LAB Interaction with Grb2—LAT interacts with several signaling proteins such as Grb2, Gads, and PLC-γ1 (8Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 21Liu S.K. Fang N. Koretzky G.A. McGlade C.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 67-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Unlike LAT, LAB only binds Grb2, not PLC-γ1 or PLC-γ2, upon activation via the BCR (30Brdicka T. Imrich M. Angelisova P. Brdickova N. Horvath O. Spicka J. Hilgert I. Luskova P. Draber P. Novak P. Engels N. Wienands J. Simeoni L. Osterreicher J. Aguado E. Malissen M. Schraven B. Horejsi V. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 31Janssen E. Zhu M. Zhang W. Koonpaew S. Zhang W. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Our data from Fig. 2 suggested that most of the LAB tyrosine phosphorylation occurred on three membrane-distal tyrosines, Tyr136, Tyr193, and Tyr233. Therefore, we chose to focus on these three tyrosines to study whether they are required for the Grb2-LAB interaction. Transduced A20 cells were lysed after stimulation with anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2. Postnuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-Grb2. The association of LAB with Grb2 was examined by anti-LAB and anti-pTyr Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3, mutation at Tyr136, Tyr193, or Tyr233 alone only slightly reduced the LAB-Grb2 association, suggesting that Grb2 binds to LAB via multiple tyrosine residues. Interestingly, the apparent molecular weight of the LAB Y136F mutant associated with Grb2 appeared less than that of WT-LAB on the SDS-PAGE. Mutation of two tyrosines in LAB as in 2YF2, 2YF3, and 2YF4 and three tyrosines dramatically reduced the Grb2-LAB interaction. These results indicated that these membrane-distal tyrosines were the most important in the interaction of LAB with Grb2. In addition, comparison of LAB amino acid sequences deduced from the EST data base showed that these three tyrosines are well conserved in LAB from human, mouse, pig, cow, and chicken (Fig. 4), implying that they are important in LAB function.Fig. 4Comparison of the amino acid sequences of LAB from human, mouse, pig, cow, and chicken. The human LAB sequence was used to search the EST data base for EST clones encoding LAB. The nucleotide sequences from these clones were used to deduce LAB amino acid sequences. The last three membrane-distal tyrosine residues, Tyr136, Tyr193 and Tyr233, are within a Grb2-binding motif and highly conserved among these species.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Rescue of Ca2+ Flux in LAT-deficient Cells by LAB Mutants—Previous studies showed that ectopic expression of NTAL/LAB in LAT-deficient Jurkat T cells partially rescued TCR-mediated activation of Erk1/2 and calcium response (30Brdicka T. Imrich M. Angelisova P. Brdickova N. Horvath O. Spicka J. Hilgert I. Luskova P. Draber P. Novak P. Engels N. Wienands J. Simeoni L. Osterreicher J. Aguado E. Malissen M. Schraven B. Horejsi V. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We decided to examine whether these LAB mutants could correct signaling defects in LAT-deficient cells. Recombinant retroviruses were used to transiently express different mutants in J.CaM2.5 cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, no TCR-mediated Ca2+ flux was seen in the parental cells. Introduction of LAT rescued the Ca2+ flux defect as reported previously (12Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Weiss A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Transient expression of WT-LAB also restored Ca2+ flux in LAT-deficient cells, albeit at a reduced level when compared with WT-LAT. Mutation of any of the three membrane-distal tyrosines reduced the ability of LAB function in TCR-mediated Ca2+ flux. Mutation of any two or three distal tyrosines in LAB rendered LAB virtually nonfunctional in Ca2+ flux. Expression levels of various mutants and WT-LAB were similar (Fig. 5B). We also examined whether TCR-mediated Erk activation could be rescued by WT and mutant LAB. However, in contrast to previous reports (30Brdicka T. Imrich M. Angelisova P. Brdickova N. Horvath O. Spicka J. Hilgert I. Luskova P. Draber P. Novak P. Engels N. Wienands J. Simeoni L. Osterreicher J. Aguado E. Malissen M. Schraven B. Horejsi V. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), we failed to rescue Erk activation with expression of WT-LAB or any of these LAB mutants (data not shown). Our data suggested that the three membrane-distal tyrosines of LAB are important in coupling the receptor engagement to Ca2+ flux. The Three Membrane-distal Tyrosines Are Important in Rescuing Thymocyte Development in LAT–/– Mice—In LAT-deficient mice, thymocytes are unable to differentiate past the CD25+CD44– subset of the CD4–CD8– stage. Previously, we showed that WT-LAB could compensate for a LAT deficiency when it was introduced into LAT–/– bone marrow cells (31Janssen E. Zhu M. Zhang W. Koonpaew S. Zhang W. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To study whether the three membrane-distal tyrosines are important in LAB function, we used recombinant retroviruses to introduce WT-LAB and various LAB mutants into the bone marrow cells from LAT–/– mice. After transduction, these bone marrow cells were allowed to expand and were then transferred into irradiated LAT–/– mice by injection via a tail vein. Because these recombinant viruses carried both LAB and GFP genes, lymphocytes derived from transduced bone marrow cells should be GFP+ and express LAB. Five to six weeks after injection, thymocytes and splenocytes from the reconstituted mice were analyzed for expression of GFP, CD4, CD8, and TCRβ by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 6, WT-LAB rescued thymocyte development in LAT–/– mice as expected. The majority of thymocytes in mice reconstituted with WT-LAB were GFP+. Flow cytometric analysis of these thymocytes showed that these GFP+ cells expressed CD4, CD8, or both. The low percentage of CD4+CD8+ (double positive) thymocytes was likely due to a limited number of T progenitor cells transferred and to the fact that most of the double positive thymocytes had developed into single positive thymocytes. These thymocytes further developed into mature single positive T cells, which were detected in the periphery. Interestingly, there was a preferential skewing toward the CD4+ lineage. Similar results were seen in mice adoptively transferred with bone marrow cells expressing LAB Y193F (Fig. 6A). However, in mice reconstituted with Y136F and Y233F mutants, there were even more CD4+ T cells. TCR expression in both thymocytes and splenic T cells from mice reconstituted with WT or single mutants was low when compared with that in T cells from B6 mice (Fig. 6B). The mutants with two or three of the membrane-distal tyrosine residues mutated failed to restore thymocyte development as neither single positive nor double positive T cells were detected in these mice (Fig. 6A). Because GFP+ cells were present in the thymuses and spleens from these mice, failure of thymocyte development was not due to unsuccessful adoptive transfer or retroviral transduction. These data suggested that the three membrane-distal tyrosines were also important in correcting the thymocyte development defect in LAT–/– mice. LAB is a membrane-associated adaptor molecule. Upon stimulation via the BCR, it interacts with the adaptor Grb2. In this study, we used different Tyr to Phe mutants to map the tyrosine phosphorylation sites in LAB and to study the effect of these mutations on LAB function. Our results showed that mutation of any of the three membrane-distal tyrosines, Tyr136, Tyr193, or Tyr233, reduced LAB phosphorylation. Mutation of all three membrane-distal tyrosines virtually abolished LAB phosphorylation, indicating that LAB is primarily phosphorylated at these tyrosines. These tyrosines are all within a Grb2 SH2 domain-binding motif. Mutation of any of them alone reduced the Grb2-LAB interaction, whereas mutation of two or three abolished Grb2 binding. We also investigated the function of these mutants by examining their ability to reconstitute Ca2+ flux in a LAT-deficient cell line and to rescue thymocyte development in LAT–/– mice. Our data showed that the three membrane-distal tyrosines, which are well conserved among different species (Fig. 3), are the most important for LAB function. Among the single Tyr to Phe mutants, mutation at Tyr233 caused a significant reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation and the LAB-Grb2 interaction. This tyrosine is contained within a YVNG sequence, which is very similar to the Tyr171 and Tyr191 in LAT (YVNV). These two tyrosines in LAT are required for proper binding of Grb2, Gads, and PLC-γ1. Thus, Tyr233 in LAB may be a functional equivalent of Tyr171 or Tyr191 in LAT. The dramatic reduction in phosphorylation of the LAB Y233F mutant suggested that Tyr233 is a primary target of the Syk family kinases. However, we could not rule out an alternative scenario in which Tyr233 is required for the recruitment of kinases to LAB. Interestingly, when Tyr136 was mutated, phosphorylation of Tyr233 was enhanced, although overall tyrosine phosphorylation of LAB was reduced (Fig. 2C). It is possible that, upon BCR engagement, Tyr136 is phosphorylated and recruits a phosphatase to dephosphorylate LAB. Alternatively, phosphorylation of Tyr136 may cause a conformational change in LAB so that Tyr233 is not accessible to tyrosine kinases. The increase in intracellular free Ca2+ provides an important intermediary in lymphocyte activation. In comparison with LAT, LAB has no PLC-γ1-binding site and is incapable of binding PLC-γ1 or -γ2. Our data showed that introduction of WT-LAB or a single Tyr to Phe LAB mutant into the LAT-deficient cells partially rescued Ca2+ flux but not MAPK activation. Ca2+ mobilization restored by either WT-LAB or single mutants was similar to that observed in LAT Y132F transfectants (33Zhang W. Trible R.P. Zhu M. Liu S.K. McGlade C.J. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23355-23361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) as a transient Ca2+ flux, but not a sustained phase, was attained. Binding of PLC-γ1 to LAT is essential for maximal PLC-γ1 phosphorylation and activation (12Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Weiss A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 33Zhang W. Trible R.P. Zhu M. Liu S.K. McGlade C.J. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23355-23361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). How LAB or the LAT Y132F mutant partially restored Ca2+ flux in the absence of PLC-γ binding is still not known. Because both LAB and LATY132F have Grb2- and Gads-binding motifs, it is possible that PLC-γ1 may interact indirectly with these two adaptor molecules via the Gads-SLP-76 or Grb2-SLP-76 complex. Mutation of these Grb2-binding sites would disrupt this indirect association of LAB with PLC-γ1. However, we could not exclude the possibility that LAB might contain an undefined PLCγ-binding motif that mediates the LAB-PLCγ association. This interaction may be too weak to detect by coimmunoprecipitation. Another possibility is that TCR-mediated calcium mobilization may not be completely dependent on PLC-γ1. Jurkat cells deficient in PLC-γ1 have a similar phenotype with regard to Ca2+ flux as LAT Y132F transfectants (34Irvin B.J. William B.L. Nilson A.E. Maynor H.O. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9149-9161Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In this case, other PLC isoforms, such as PLC-γ2, might be recruited to LAT or LAB. Although LAB associated with Grb2, it failed to reconstitute Erk activation in LAT-deficient cells like the LAT Y132F mutant. This may also be attributed to the lack of the LAB-PLCγ association. Insufficient activation of PLC-γ1 could affect activation of PKC or RasGRP1, which acts upstream of Ras. Recruitment of the Grb2-Sos complex to LAT may be required, but not sufficient, for Erk activation in T cells. Our results differed from the published data in which LAB/NTAL successfully rescued MAPK activation in LAT-deficient cells (30Brdicka T. Imrich M. Angelisova P. Brdickova N. Horvath O. Spicka J. Hilgert I. Luskova P. Draber P. Novak P. Engels N. Wienands J. Simeoni L. Osterreicher J. Aguado E. Malissen M. Schraven B. Horejsi V. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The reason for this discrepancy is unclear. It may be due to variations in the NTAL/LAB expression levels when different vectors were used. WT-LAB and single Tyr to Phe mutants were capable of rescuing thymocyte development in LAT–/– mice. It is not clear why TCR expression in T cells reconstituted with LAB was low when compared with that in normal T cells. Similar TCR expression was also found in T cells from the Y136F knock-in mice (28Sommers C.L. Park C.S. Lee J. Feng C. Fuller C.L. Grinberg A. Hildebrand J.A. Lacana E. Menon R.K. Shores E.W. Samelson L.E. Love P.E. Science. 2002; 296: 2040-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 29Aguado E. Richelme S. Nunez-Cruz S. Miazek A. Mura A.M. Richelme M. Guo X.J. Sainty D. He H.T.

Although three LAB single tyrosine mutants, Y136F, Y193F, and Y233F, were all capable of rescuing thymocyte development like WT-LAB, CD4+ T cell development was more prominently skewed in mice reconstituted with the Y136F and Y233F mutants. LAB-mediated reconstitution of CD8+ T cell development could be affected by mutation at Tyr136 or Tyr233 more than at Tyr193. The precise mechanism for this difference is not clear as current understanding of the differential signals for CD4+ and CD8+ T cell development is still limited. Although mutation of any one of the three membrane-distal tyrosines had no significant effect on the ability of LAB to function in thymocyte development, mutation of two or three of these tyrosines abolished LAB function; therefore, multiple Grb2-binding sites are required for LAB function. These findings were similar to results from studies of LAT mutants (26Zhu M. Janssen E. Zhang W. J. Immunol. 2003; 17: 325-333Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In LAT, mutation of the four membrane-distal tyrosines abolished LAT tyrosine phosphorylation, its interaction with Grb2, Gads, and PLC-γ1, and LAT function in T cell activation, and thymocyte development. Our data showed that mutation of three membrane-distal tyrosines of LAB disrupted LAB tyrosine phosphorylation, its interaction with Grb2, and its ability to rescue a LAT deficiency. In summary, our data indicated that among nine tyrosine residues in human LAB, the three membrane-distal tyrosines are the most important in LAB function.

https://openalex.org/W1989448155,"CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 contain modular domains that mediate protein-protein interactions with a wide variety of nuclear factors. A C-terminal domain of CBP (referred to as the SID) is responsible for interaction with the α-helical AD1 domain of p160 coactivators such as the steroid receptor coactivator (SRC1), and also other transcriptional regulators such as E1A, Ets-2, IRF3, and p53. Here we show that the pointed (PNT) domain of Ets-2 mediates its interaction with the CBP SID, and describe the effects of mutations in the SID on binding of Ets-2, E1A, and SRC1. In vitro binding studies indicate that SRC1, Ets-2 and E1A display mutually exclusive binding to the CBP SID. Consistent with this, we observed negative cross-talk between ERα/SRC1, Ets-2, and E1A proteins in reporter assays in transiently transfected cells. Transcriptional inhibition of Ets-2 or GAL4-AD1 activity by E1A was rescued by co-transfection with a CBP expression plasmid, consistent with the hypothesis that the observed inhibition was due to competition for CBP in vivo. Sequence comparisons revealed that SID-binding proteins contain a leucine-rich motif similar to the α-helix Aα1 of the SRC1 AD1 domain. Deletion mutants of E1A and Ets-2 lacking the conserved motif were unable to bind the CBP SID. Moreover, a peptide corresponding to this sequence competed the binding of full-length SRC1, Ets-2, and E1A proteins to the CBP SID. Thus, a leucine-rich amphipathic α-helix mediates mutually exclusive interactions of functionally diverse nuclear proteins with CBP.

CBP 1The abbreviations used are: CBP, CREB-binding protein; CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; UTR, untranslated region; PNT, pointed domain; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; AAD, acidic activation domain; HA, hemagglutinin; SRC, steroid receptor coactivator. and p300 interact with a wide range of DNA-binding transcription factors and their cofactors (1Giordano A. Avantaggiati M.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 218-230Google Scholar, 2Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577Crossref Google Scholar). Recruitment of CBP and associated factors permits acetylation and methylation of histones and other proteins at gene promoters, leading to chromatin remodeling, RNA polymerase II recruitment, and transcription. The ability of CBP and p300 to form contacts with multiple diverse factors assembled at gene promoters such as the IFN-β enhanceosome, facilitates synergistic activation of transcription (3Agalioti T. Lomvardas S. Parekh B. Yie J. Maniatis T. Thanos D. Cell. 2000; 103: 667-678Google Scholar). Conversely, competition between transcription factors for common binding sites on CBP/p300, which are in limiting concentrations in the nucleus, is likely to be important in negative cross-talk, as observed between nuclear receptors (NRs) and AP-1, NFκB, or STAT proteins (4Horvai A.E. Xu L. Korzus E. Brard G. Kalafus D. Mullen T.M. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1074-1079Google Scholar, 5Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.-C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Google Scholar) or hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF1α) and CITED2 (6Freedman S.J. Sun Z.Y. Kung A.L. France D.S. Wagner G. Eck M.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 504-512Google Scholar). Furthermore, CBP and p300 are important targets in viral infection, as they associate with viral proteins such as adenoviral E1A, SV40 large T antigen, and HTLV Tax (1Giordano A. Avantaggiati M.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 218-230Google Scholar, 2Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, CBP and p300 act as molecular integrators of signal transduction pathways regulating cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and the response to viral infection. The interaction of CBP/p300 with a large number of functionally diverse proteins is facilitated by a series of modular protein-binding domains. These include the cysteine/histidinerich domains CH1 and CH3, also known as TAZ1 and ZZ/TAZ2, which are major sites of protein interaction. The CH3/TAZ2 domain has a compact globular structure consisting of four α-helices and three HCCC zinc-binding motifs (7De Guzman R.N. Liu H.Y. Martinez-Yamout M. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 243-253Google Scholar). A short sequence (TRAM) has been identified within CH3, which partly mediates the interaction of CBP with adenoviral E1A proteins (8O'Connor M.J. Zimmermann H. Nielsen S. Bernard H.U. Kouzarides T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3574-3581Google Scholar). Although recent studies have confirmed that the CH1 and CH3 domains are structurally similar (9Dames S.A. Martinez-Yamout M. De Guzman R.N. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5271-5276Google Scholar, 10Freedman S.J. Sun Z.Y. Poy F. Kung A.L. Livingston D.M. Wagner G. Eck M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5367-5372Google Scholar), they appear to exhibit distinct, if overlapping, specificities for binding subsets of transcription factors. Some proteins such as E1A, p53 and Ets proteins, have been observed to interact with several discrete CBP domains (10Freedman S.J. Sun Z.Y. Poy F. Kung A.L. Livingston D.M. Wagner G. Eck M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5367-5372Google Scholar). The KIX domain undergoes a conformational change upon association with the phosphorylated form of the kinase-inducible domain (KID) of CREB (11Radhakrishnan I. Perez-Alvarado G.C. Parker D. Dyson H.J. Montminy M.R. Wright P.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 741-752Google Scholar). In addition, other protein-interaction domains in CBP/p300 include the bromodomain, which mediates interaction of CBP with the acetylated p53, MyoD and other proteins (12Polesskaya A. Naguibneva I. Duquet A. Bengal E. Robin P. Harel-Bellan A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5312-5320Google Scholar), and three LXXLL motifs that mediate interactions with NRs (13Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Google Scholar, 14Heery D.M. Hoare S. Hussain S. Parker M.G. Sheppard H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6695-6702Google Scholar). The p160 coactivators bind to a domain located near the C terminus of CBP and p300 (5Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.-C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K.

We have characterized this sequence, termed the SRC1 interaction domain (SID), and mapped it to amino acids 2058–2130 of CBP (18Sheppard H.M. Harries J.C. Hussain S. Bevan C. Heery D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 39-50Google Scholar). The SID domain interacts with amino acids 926–960 of SRC1, the transcriptional activation domain AD1, which is conserved among the p160 proteins (5Kamei Y. Xu L.

The solution structure of this region of CBP in complex with the AD1 domain of ACTR has revealed that SID and AD1 polypeptides undergo a synergistic fold giving a structure resembling a four-helix bundle (19Demarest S.J. Martinez-Yamout M. Chung J. Chen H. Xu W. Dyson H.J. Evans R.M. Wright P.E. Nature. 2002; 415: 549-553Google Scholar). In addition to binding p160 proteins, recent reports have demonstrated that other factors can interact with the SID including IRF-3, E1A, p53, Tax, Ets-2, and KSHV IRF-1 (20Lin C.H. Hare B.J.

In this study we describe experiments which indicate that diverse nuclear proteins such as SRC1, E1A, and Ets-2 display mutually exclusive binding to the CBP SID both in vitro and in vivo. We show that these proteins share a sequence motif similar to an amphipathic α-helix in the AD1 domain of p160s, which is important for their interactions with the CBP SID.

Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 227-248Google Scholar) to generate VP16-acidic activation domain (AAD) fusion proteins. Full-length FLAG-Ets-2 cDNA was amplified from pcDNA3 FLAG-Ets-2 and cloned into a modified pSG5 vector to create pSG5 FLAG-Ets-2. The FLAG-Ets-2 ΔPNT (deletion of amino acids 116–161) and FLAG-Ets-2 ΔH5 (deletion of amino acids 154–161) were constructed by PCR methods. All constructs generated in this study were verified by sequence analysis. Yeast Methods—The yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out essentially as described previously (23Le Douarin B. Heery D. Gaudon C. vom Baur E. Losson R. Methods in Molecular Biology, Steroid Receptor Methods: Protocols and Assays. 176. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 227-248Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae L40 cells carrying DBD-LexA-CBP (1982–2163) were transformed with the pASV3 mouse embryo cDNA library using a modified lithium acetate transformation method (23Le Douarin B. Heery D. Gaudon C. vom Baur E. Losson R. Methods in Molecular Biology, Steroid Receptor Methods: Protocols and Assays. 176. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 227-248Google Scholar). Transformants were initially selected for l-leucine and l-tryptophan prototrophy on dropout medium resulting in the recovery of 1.5 × 106 library clones. The library was then replated (10-fold) onto dropout medium with selection for l-leucine, l-tryptophan, and l-histidine prototrophy, and resistance to either 10 mm or 20 mm 3-aminotriazole (3-AT), to select bait-interacting clones. Colonies capable of growth on 3-AT and showing strong activation of the secondary reporter (β-galactosidase) were subjected to further analysis. The 331 putative positives from the first round of selection were cultured in the presence of l-tryptophan to eliminate the bait plasmid, followed by rescue of pASV3 library (LEU2) plasmids in E. coli HB101 (leuB-) by complementation on M9 minimal medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and lacking l-leucine (23Le Douarin B. Heery D. Gaudon C. vom Baur E. Losson R. Methods in Molecular Biology, Steroid Receptor Methods: Protocols and Assays. 176. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 227-248Google Scholar). Bona fide-positive clones were selected by retransformation of fresh L40 pBTM116-CBP 1982–2163 and testing for 3-AT resistance and β-galactosidase activity. Quantitative β-galactosidase assays were carried out in duplicate, in three separate experiments, as previously described and reporter activities are expressed as nmol of substrate transformed/min/mg protein extract (18Sheppard H.M. Harries J.C. Hussain S. Bevan C. Heery D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 39-50Google Scholar, 23Le Douarin B. Heery D. Gaudon C. vom Baur E. Losson R. Methods in Molecular Biology, Steroid Receptor Methods: Protocols and Assays. 176. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 227-248Google Scholar). The expression of fusion proteins in cell-free extracts was monitored by Western blotting using antibodies (Autogen BioClear) directed against VP16 (sc-7545), or LexA (sc-7544) or FLAG-M2 (Sigma) epitopes. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—COS-1 and HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium, (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, (Invitrogen). For reporter assays, COS-1 cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells per ml in 6-well dishes in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with dextran charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum (5%), 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected by calcium phosphate co-precipitation (Clontech) or by Transfast (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transfected DNAs were used at the following concentrations (per well) unless otherwise indicated; pJ7-lacZ control plasmid (500 ng), p3ERE-TATA-Luc, pUPA-Luc reporter plasmids (1 ug), pMT-MOR (ERα) expression plasmid (5 ng), pSG5 hSRC1e (100 ng), pcDNA3 FLAG-Ets-2 (250 ng), pSG5 pGAL4-AD1 (250 ng), pGAL-E1B-Luc (500 ng), pCI E1A12S (50 ng), pCI E1A12S Δ2–36 (50 ng) and pSG5-CBP (100 ng). The amount of DNA per well was equilibrated with empty pSG5 or the pcDNA3 vector as appropriate. After 24 h, fresh medium containing either vehicle or 10-8m 17β-estradiol (E2) was added. After a further 24 h, the cells were harvested; extracts were assayed for luciferase activity using the luciferase assay system (Promega); and the data were normalized relative to β-galactosidase activities in the same extracts, as determined using the Galacto-Light chemiluminescence assay (Tropix). All measurements were done in triplicate, and each experiment repeated at least twice. Reporter activities are expressed as fold induction of the normalized luciferase activity relative to that due to reporters alone (or reporters alone in the absence of ligand for ERα). In Vitro and In Vivo Interactions—In vitro translated 35S-labeled proteins were generated from pSG5, pT7 or pcDNA3 expression vectors, using the T7/SP6-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α or BL21 and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The expression of GST proteins was monitored on (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels (12%) by Coomassie Blue staining, and equivalent amounts of proteins were used in the pull-down assays, which were performed as described previously (18Sheppard H.M. Harries J.C. Hussain S. Bevan C. Heery D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 39-50Google Scholar). Competition assays (38Kurokawa R. Kalafus D. Ogliastro M.H. Kioussi C. Xu L. Torchia J. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Science. 1998; 279: 700-703Google Scholar) were carried out as follows; a fixed amount of 35S-labeled test protein (close to saturation of the beads) relative to increasing amounts of a competitor protein (also 35S-labeled) or AD1 peptide (SRC1 925–958), were premixed before addition to the protein-loaded glutathione-Sepharose beads. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, HEK293 cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells per ml in 10-cm dishes, and transfected with 15 μg of either pcDNA3-FLAG vector (Control), pcDNA3 FLAG-Ets-2 or pSG5 FLAG-SRC1e in addition to 15 μg of pSG5 CBP, pCMV HA-p300, or empty vectors. After 40 h, nuclear extracts were prepared as follows: cell pellets were washed twice in 0.5 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of Extraction Buffer I (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 150 mm NaCl; 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and protease inhibitors at 0 °C for 15 min. The cell nuclei were pelleted and resuspended in 1 ml of Extraction Buffer II (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 420 mm KCl; 10% glycerol; 2 mm dithiothreitol; with protease inhibitors). After 15 min at 0 °C, the lysate was centrifuged at 10 krpm, 4 °C, for 10 min, and precleared for 30 min at 4 °C with 20 μl of protein-A/G PLUS-agarose beads (Autogen Bioclear, sc-2003). FLAG-tagged proteins were purified using 20 μl of packed volume α-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma, A-2220) on a rotating wheel overnight at 4 °C, followed by three washes in 0.5 ml of Extraction Buffer II. Proteins bound to the beads were separated by SDS-PAGE (8% acrylamide for p300 or CBP, 12% acrylamide for FLAG-tagged proteins), transferred to nitrocellulose and detected by Western blotting. FLAG-tagged proteins were detected using a 1:500 dilution of α-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma, F-3165) followed by a 1:2000 dilution of secondary α-mouse IgG-HRP (Autogen Bioclear, sc-2954). For detection of co-purified HA-p300, a 1:500 dilution of α-HA (Autogen Bioclear, sc-7392) antibody was used, in conjunction with 1:2000 dilution of the α-mouse IgG-HRP. Similarly for CBP detection, a 1:500 dilution (mix) of CBP (A-22) and CBP (C-20) rabbit polyclonals (Autogen Bioclear, sc-583 and sc-369, respectively) was used, in conjunction with a 1:2000 dilution of anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Autogen Bioclear, sc-2004). Bound peroxidase-coupled antibodies were revealed using the ECL Plus system (Amersham Biosciences). The PNT Domain of Ets-2 Mediates Its Interaction with CBP SID—To isolate proteins that interact with the CBP SID domain, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen of a VP16 AAD-fused mouse embryonic cDNA library (43Le Douarin B.

Hussain S. Bevan C. Heery D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 39-50Google Scholar). From two million individual clones screened, five bona fide positive clones were identified. Sequence analysis and data base searches revealed that one of these (clone 1–01) encoded the N terminus (amino acids 1–273) of the mouse Ets-2 protein, with an additional 54 codons of in-frame sequence upstream of the proposed start codon derived from 5′-UTR sequence. This comprises the entire transactivation domain of human Ets-2 including the conserved PNT domain (amino acids 60–170). Removal of the codons derived from the 5′-UTR sequence (AAD-Ets-2 (1–273)) did not affect the interaction with the bait sequence, confirming that this sequence was not required for the interaction with CBP (Fig. 1A). As the boundaries of the bait sequence (1982–2163) were extended beyond the minimal SID, we used a series of LexA-CBP fusion proteins to define the minimal sequences capable of binding Ets-2 (1–273). As shown in Fig. 1B, the minimal CBP sequence required to bind to the AAD-Ets-2 (1–273) corresponded to the previously characterized SID domain (CBP 2058–2130). A previous study reported interactions of Ets-2 with the CH1/TAZ1 domain and also a large C-terminal portion of CBP (amino acids 1678–2370) containing the CH3/ZZ-TAZ2 and SID domains (24Jayaraman G. Srinivas R. Duggan C. Ferreira E. Swaminathan S. Somasundaram K. Williams J. Hauser C. Kurkinen M. Dhar R. Weitzman S. Buttice G. Thimmapaya B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17342-17352Google Scholar). We assessed the binding of in vitro translated full-length Ets-2 to GST-CBP fusion proteins GST-CBP-N (1–596) or GST-SID (2058–2130). Similar amounts of the GST fusion proteins and control (GST alone) were used as indicated (Fig. 2A, lower panel). Ets-2 was found to bind strongly to the CBP SID domain, whereas a weaker interaction was detected with CBP N terminus containing CH1 under similar conditions (Fig. 2A, upper panel). This result indicates a strong interaction between Ets-2 and the SID domain of CBP in vitro. To determine the boundaries of the Ets-2 sequence required for binding to the CBP SID domain, we generated a series of VP16 AAD-Ets-2 fusion constructs. Reporter assays were carried out on extracts from yeast L40 cells co-expressing LexA-CBP-SID with AAD-Ets-2 proteins. As shown in Fig. 2B, the minimal region of Ets-2 necessary for SID binding mapped to amino acids 60–170, containing the PNT domain (residues 88–170). This domain is conserved in a subset of Ets family proteins, and has previously been shown to contain a conserved threonine residue adjacent to the PNT domain, which is phosphorylated by the kinases MAPK and Akt (25Smith J.L.

Van Beveren C. Stacey K.J. Hume D.A. Maki R.A. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 538-547Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that substitution of this residue with alanine (T72A) results in a loss of MAPK signaling via Ets-2 (26Yang B.S. Hauser C.A. Henkel G. Colman M.S. Van Beveren C. Stacey K.J. Hume D.A. Maki R.A. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 538-547Google Scholar). This raised the possibility that phosphorylation might be required to stabilize the interaction of Ets-2 with coactivators such as CBP, as previously observed for the interaction of the kinase inducible domain of CREB with the CBP KIX domain (11Radhakrishnan I. Perez-Alvarado G.C. Parker D. Dyson H.J. Montminy M.R. Wright P.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 741-752Google Scholar). However, as shown in Fig. 2B, the T72A mutation did not markedly impair the interaction of PNT with SID in yeast two-hybrid experiments, suggesting that phosphorylation of Thr-72 is not essential for the physical association of Ets-2 and CBP. This result was confirmed by in vitro binding studies, as we observed that wild-type and T72A Ets-2 proteins displayed equally strong binding to GST-SID (Fig. 2C). Thus, the association of Ets-2 protein with CBP can occur via an interaction between the PNT and SID domains, which does not require phosphorylation of Thr-72 in yeast two-hybrid or in vitro binding assays. To confirm the interaction of Ets-2 with CBP in vivo, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. HEK293 cells were transiently co-transfected with expression plasmids for FLAG-Ets-2 or FLAG-SRC1e along with CBP or HA-p300 expression plasmids, or empty vector. Nuclear extracts were prepared post-transfection, and FLAG-tagged proteins purified on anti-FLAG M2 Sepharose beads were detected by Western blotting (Fig. 2D, left panel). Co-immunoprecipitated CBP and HA-p300 proteins were detected using anti-CBP (middle panel) or anti-HA antibodies (right panel), respectively. Our results show that both CBP and p300 proteins co-precipitated with FLAG-Ets-2, but not a negative control (FLAG vector), indicating that these proteins can form a complex in vivo. The amount of HA-p300 detected with each of these proteins was comparable to that obtained with a positive control protein, FLAG-SRC1e (Fig. 2D, right panel). Effects of Amino Acid Substitutions in the CBP SID on Recruitment of SRC1, Ets-2, and E1A—In addition to binding p160 proteins and Ets-2, the SID domain has been reported to interact with a variety of other cellular and viral nuclear proteins including the adenoviral E1A 12S protein (20Lin C.H. Hare B.J. Wagner G. Harrison S.C. Maniatis T. Fraenkel E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 581-590Google Scholar, 22Scoggin K.E.S. Ulloa A. Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5520-5530Google Scholar). To determine whether these functionally diverse proteins make similar contacts with the CBP SID domain, we examined the impact of amino acid substitutions in the CBP SID domain on its interaction with SRC1, Ets-2, and E1A. Full-length 35S-labeled SRC1e, Ets-2 and E1A proteins were generated by in vitro translation and assessed for binding to a panel of GST-SID mutants (18Sheppard H.M. Harries J.C. Hussain S. Bevan C. Heery D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 39-50Google Scholar). Amino acid substitutions within the SID structure (19Demarest S.J. Martinez-Yamout M. Chung J. Chen H. Xu W. Dyson H.J. Evans R.M. Wright P.E. Nature. 2002; 415: 549-553Google Scholar) are depicted schematically in Fig. 3A. As shown in Fig. 3B, and shown previously for SRC1, (18Sheppard H.M. Harries J.C. Hussain S. Bevan C. Heery D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 39-50Google Scholar), substitution of the conserved leucine residues in helix H1 (L2071A/L2072A/L2075A, L2071P/L2072P, and L2071A/L2072A) only weakly reduced binding of E1A and SRC1 to the SID. However, Ets-2 binding to the SID was more sensitive to mutations in H1 (Fig. 3B). In addition, the F2101P and K2103P substitutions, which are predicted to disrupt helix H3 formation, ablated or strongly reduced the interaction of all three proteins with the SID (Fig. 3B). In contrast, amino acid substitutions that replace Lys-2103 or Lys-2108 with alanine, which would not be expected to disrupt H3 formation, had little effect on E1A or SRC1 binding, and only partly reduced the binding of Ets-2 to the SID. Similarly, amino acid replacements in the polyglutamine rich sequence (Q-loop) between helices H1 and H2 (Q2082R) or the QPG(M/L) repeat region (Q2113P/G2115P or Q2117A/P2118A) had little or no deleterious effect on interactions with SRC1 or E1A, although substitution of three of the four glutamines in the region between H1 and H2 (Q2082P/Q2084P/Q2085G) resulted in reduced Ets-2 binding (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that SRC1, Ets-2, and E1A recognize a similar surface of the CBP SID domain, for which the integrity of H3 is critical. However, H1 appears to be specifically important for the docking of the Ets-2 protein. To assess whether the SRC1 AD1 domain (900–970) and Ets-2 PNT domain (60–170) displayed similar sensitivities to SID mutations as the full-length proteins, we assessed the abilities of AAD fusion proteins containing these sequences to interact with a panel of LexA-CBP-SID"

Here we present NMR analysis and genetic functional studies of an NCS homolog in fission yeast (Ncs1p). Ncs1p binds three Ca2+ ions at saturation with an apparent affinity of 2 μm and Hill coefficient of 1.9. Analysis of NMR and fluorescence spectra of Ncs1p revealed significant Ca2+-induced protein conformational changes indicative of a Ca2+-myristoyl switch. The amino-terminal myristoyl group is sequestered inside a hydrophobic cavity of the Ca2+-free protein and becomes solvent-exposed in the Ca2+-bound protein. Subcellular fractionation experiments showed that myristoylation and Ca2+ binding by Ncs1p are essential for its translocation from cytoplasm to membranes. The ncs1 deletion mutant (ncs1Δ) showed two distinct phenotypes: nutrition-insensitive sexual development and a growth defect at high levels of extracellular Ca2+ (0.1 m CaCl2). Analysis of Ncs1p mutants lacking myristoylation (Ncs1pG2A) or deficient in Ca2+ binding (Ncs1pE84Q/E120Q/E168Q) revealed that Ca2+ binding was essential for both phenotypes, while myristoylation was less critical. Exogenous cAMP, a key regulator for sexual development, suppressed conjugation and sporulation of ncs1Δ, suggesting involvement of Ncs1p in the adenylate cyclase pathway turned on by the glucose-sensing G protein-coupled receptor Git3p. Starvation-independent sexual development of ncs1Δ was also complemented by retinal recoverin, which controls Ca2+-regulated desensitization of rhodopsin. In contrast, the Ca2+ intolerance of ncs1Δ was not affected by cAMP or recoverin, suggesting that the two ncs1Δ phenotypes are mechanistically independent. We propose that Schizosaccharomyces pombe Ncs1p negatively regulates sporulation perhaps by controlling Ca2+-dependent desensitization of Git3p.

Bioessays. 2000; 22: 337-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The primary sequence of S. pombe Ncs1p demonstrates its homology to the NCS branch of the EF-hand superfamily of Ca2+-binding proteins (Fig. 1) (20Kawasaki H. Nakayama S. Kretsinger R.H.

Res. 1993; 16: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), hippocalcin (27Kobayashi M. Takamatsu K. Saitoh S. Noguchi T. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). All members of the NCS family are myristoylated and possess four EF-hands, although the first EF-hand motif (EF-1) contains substitutions that prevent Ca2+ binding at this site (Fig. 1). In recoverin, substitutions in EF-4 also prevent Ca2+ binding, and hence only EF-2 and EF-3 are functional (30Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Frq1, frequenin, and neurocalcin contain three occupied Ca2+-binding sites (EF-2, EF-3, and EF-4) in their atomic resolution structures (31Ames J.B. Hendricks K.B. Strahl T. Huttner I.G. Hamasaki N.

The S. pombe Ncs1p shares highest sequence identity with Frq1 and frequenin (60%) but is also highly similar in sequence to mammalian recoverin (46% identity). Interestingly structurally important amino acids in recoverin appear invariant in S. pombe Ncs1p but are not conserved in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Frq1 (see highlighted residues in Fig. 1). Moreover recoverin is significantly closer in sequence to Ncs1p (46% identity) than to Frq1 (35% identity). Hence recoverin appears to be structurally and evolutionarily more similar to S. pombe Ncs1p than it is to Frq1 of budding yeast. The three-dimensional structures of myristoylated recoverin have been determined by NMR spectroscopy (30Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 34Tanaka T. Ames J.B. Harvey T.S. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1995; 376: 444-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). A striking feature of these structures is a large Ca2+-induced conformational change. In the Ca2+-free state, the myristoyl group is buried inside the protein and not exposed to solvent. Binding of Ca2+ to recoverin leads to extrusion of its myristoyl group and to a large rotation of the two domains of the protein such that many hydrophobic residues are exposed. The Ca2+-induced exposure of the myristoyl group, termed the calcium-myristoyl switch, enables recoverin to bind to membranes only at high Ca2+ levels (35Zozulya S. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11569-11573Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 36Dizhoor A.M. Chen C.K. Olshevskaya E. Sinelnikova V.V. Phillipov P. Hurley J.B. Science. 1993; 259: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Given the similarities of Ncs1p to the NCS family, it was of interest to assess whether this ancestral homolog displays a Ca2+-dependent myristoyl switch and to characterize its physiological role in fission yeast. Here we combine NMR spectroscopy, biochemical analysis, and yeast genetics to determine the Ca2+ and membrane binding properties, Ca2+-induced protein structural changes, and biological function of Ncs1p. Strains and Media—S. pombe strains constructed in this study were derived from either wild type KGY425, KGY461, KGY553, KGY554, or SP870 (Table I). Standard culture media and genetic manipulation techniques were used (37Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3104) Google Scholar). For vegetative growth of S. pombe, rich medium (YES) and synthetic minimum medium (EMM) were used. Malt extract solid medium was used for conjugation and sporulation. Nutritional supplements were added as needed. To maintain strains bearing S. pombe plasmid with LEU2 marker and nmt1 promoter, leucine was omitted from the supplements in EMM (EMM-L) and 2 μm thiamine was added. To see starvation-independent spore formation, EMM containing a final concentration of 3% glucose, a concentration equivalent to that in rich medium, was used. For the calcium sensitivity assay, CaCl2 was added to YES at a final concentration of 0.1 m before autoclaving. The deletion mutant strain, bearing a plasmid based on S. pombe expression vector pREP1 (LEU2+ nmt1 promoter), was grown on EMM-L minus thiamine to induce the nmt1 promoter before being streaked on YES containing 0.1 m CaCl2.Table IS. pombe strainsStrainaS. pombe wild type strains 972, KGY425, KGY461, KGY553, KGY554, and SP870 were kindly provided by Dr. Henry Levin.

Live cells were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole by mixing equal volumes of cell suspension and 50 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole solution. Live cells were also examined by confocal microscopy using a TCS-SP scanner with a DMRE fluorescence microscope (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany) equipped with an Ar+ laser source. Excitation for green fluorescent protein (GFP) was 488 nm and emission was 500–575 nm. Twenty to 30 slices of optical sectioning were made by serial scanning, and images were stored for further three-dimensional reconstruction. Three-dimensional animation movies were generated from these data (see Supplemental Material). Cloning of ncs1 and Plasmid Construction—Standard protocols were used (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and Escherichia coli DH5α was used as a host for all plasmid manipulations. Nucleotide sequences were determined after gene cloning and each mutagenesis by Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing using an ABI 373 or 3100 sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The ncs1 gene was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR. First, total RNA was extracted from S. pombe canonical wild type strain 972 by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) followed by reverse transcription. The resultant cDNA mixture served as a template in the PCR, and upstream and downstream primers 5′-AAGGTACCGT CGACATATGG GAAAATCACA ATCAAAATTG TCTCAAGATC AACTCC-3′ and 5′-AATCTAGAGG ATCCTTCATT ATATTAAAAA ATGTAATAAA AGGCAAAATG TAC-3′, respectively, were used. An ∼0.8-kb PCR product was first cloned into pBlueScript KSII(+) (Stratagene) at KpnI/XbaI sites yielding pBSII-ncs1. The nucleotide sequence of the ncs1 open reading frame was confirmed, and this plasmid was used as a template for all the mutagenesis. Triple EQ mutations (3EQ; E84Q/E120Q/E168Q) that abolished Ca2+ binding at EF-2, EF-3, and EF-4 were created by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The G2A mutation was performed by standard PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). The multicopy S. pombe expression vector pREP1 2Plasmid pREP42EGFP-C was a kind gift from Dr. I. M. Hagan.

To construct these plasmids, ncs1 and its mutant genes as well as Reco and FRQ1 in pTIS1DT (39Ray S. Zozulya S. Niemi G.A. Flaherty K.M. Brolley D. Dizhoor A.M. McKay D.B. Hurley J. Stryer L. Proc.

To construct fusion proteins of Ncs1p and its unmyristoylated mutant with enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) (F64L/S65T; mut1 of Cormack et al. (40Cormack B.P. Valdivia R.H. Falkow S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 173: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (2474) Google Scholar)), the ncs1 and ncs1G2A genes were modified at their stop codons and ligated into pREP42EGFP-C2 at the NdeI/XmaI site. For protein expression in E. coli, the ncs1 open reading frame from pBSII-ncs1 was subcloned into pPET11a (Novagen) at the NdeI/BamHI sites. Gene Disruption of ncs1 Allele—Deletion mutant allele ncs1Δ::his3 was produced as shown in Fig. 6 by one-step gene disruption. The coding region of ncs1 was replaced with a his3 gene cassette through homologous recombination in wild type diploid NHSP001D.

The His+ haploid NHP013 was obtained from resultant heterozygous diploid NHP009D by random sporulation (41Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. McLeod M. Warbrick E. Experiments with Fission Yeast. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 77-80Google Scholar). The isogenic strains NHP57–60 were obtained by back-crossing NHP013 with KGY461 (Table I). Homothallic deletion mutant NHP033 was obtained using the same cassette, and SP870 was used as a host strain. The chromosomal ncs1-GFP-tagged allele (ncs1+-GFP::ura4+) was constructed by the same method using GFP::ura4+ cassette delivered from pCS2pkSu2 and KGY425 as a host strain. Resultant NHP002 was then back-crossed with KGY554 to obtain NHP078 (Table I). Ncs1p-GFP was confirmed to be as functional in nutrition-dependent sporulation as wild type. Preparation and Purification of Recombinant Myristoylated Ncs1p—To prepare recombinant myristoylated Ncs1p protein uniformly labeled with nitrogen-15 and/or [13C14]myristate, the protein was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) carrying the pET11a vector harboring the ncs1 coding sequence and co-expressing a yeast N-myristoyltransferase (42Duronio R.J.

Labeled myristoylated Ncs1p protein was purified from the soluble fraction of a bacterial cell lysate using hydrophobic interaction chromatography as described previously for recoverin and frequenin (35Zozulya S.

Peak fractions were concentrated to 5 ml and subjected to size exclusion chromatography (Sephacryl S-100, Amersham Biosciences) in buffer B (1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm CaCl2, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Final purity was greater than 98% as judged by SDS-PAGE (see Supplemental Data). 3SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoretic gel showing the final purity of recombinant myristoylated Ncs1p samples used for NMR and Ca2+ binding studies. Electrosprayionization mass spectrometry indicated that at least 85% of the recombinant protein was properly myristoylated. NMR Spectroscopy—Samples for NMR analysis were prepared by dissolving 15N-labeled Ncs1p (0.5 mm) in 0.5 ml of a 95% H2O, 5% 2H2O solution containing 10 mm [2H2]imidazole (pH 7.2), 10 mm [2H10]dithiothreitol, and either 1 mm EDTA (Ca2+-free) or 5 mm CaCl2 (Ca2+-bound). All NMR experiments were performed at 35 °C on a Bruker DRX-500 or DRX-600 spectrometer equipped with a four-channel interface and a triple resonance probe with triple axis pulsed field gradients. The 15N-1H HSQC spectra (see Fig. 3) were recorded on a sample of 15N-labeled Ncs1p (in 95% H2O, 5% 2H2O). The number of complex points and acquisition times were: 256, 180 ms (15N (F1)); and 512, 64 ms (1H (F2)). The 13C(F1)-edited, 13C(F3)-filtered NOESY-HMQC spectra (see Fig. 4) were recorded on a sample of unlabeled Ncs1p protein containing a uniformly 13C-labeled myristoyl group (46Ames J.B. Tanaka T.

Hamasaki N. Molchanova T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5776-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) based on the original method of Paulus (48Paulus H. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 32: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The buffer used in the Ca2+ titration (25 mm HEPES, 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4) and protein samples were decalcified by treatment with Chelex resin (Bio-Rad) using the batch method. A Centricon-10 concentrator (10-kDa cutoff, 2-ml sample compartment, Millipore Corp.) used in the titration was pretreated to remove contaminating Ca2+. The lower chamber was rinsed with 0.1 m HCl followed by several rinses with decalcified buffer. The concentrator membrane was decalcified by rinsing with 5% NaHCO3 followed by several rinses with decalcified buffer. A decalcified protein sample (1.5 ml, 70 μm) was placed into the sample compartment, and 12 μl of 0.25 mm45Ca2+ solution (2.6 μCi) was added. The sample was carefully mixed and centrifuged (2300 rpm, 2 min) using a tabletop centrifuge (Beckman Model TJ-6), forming 25 μl of filtrate. The filtrate was returned to the sample chamber, mixed, and centrifuged a second time to minimize any dead volume. The radioactivity of 10 μl of the filtrate (free Ca2+) and an equal volume of the protein sample (total Ca2+) were determined by liquid scintillation counting (Liquid Scintillation Analyzer, Packard Instrument Co.). Aliquots of nonradioactive Ca2+ were added serially to the protein sample to adjust the total Ca2+ concentration throughout the titration (5.5, 15.7, 28.7, 52.5, 78.7, 131, 180, 240, 300, 400, 500, and 600 μm), and the above centrifugation procedure was repeated in triplicate for each point in the titration. The free and bound Ca2+ concentrations at each point in the titration were calculated from the measured radioactivity as described previously (29Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and fractional saturation was plotted as a function of free Ca2+ concentration (see Table II and Fig. 2).Table II45Ca2+ binding data obtained from ultrafiltration assay Rfiltrate/Rsample is equivalent to [Ca2+free]/[Ca2+tot] and was determined as the ratio of 45Ca2+ radioactivity measured from equal aliquots of filtrate and sample compartments during the ultrafiltration Ca2+ binding assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Free Ca2+ concentration is calculated as the total Ca2+ concentration times Rfiltrate/Rsample. Bound Ca2+ concentration is calculated as the total Ca2+ minus free Ca2+ (protein concentration was 70 μm).Total Ca2+Rfiltrate/RsampleFree Ca2+Bound Ca2+/proteinμmμm5.50.0450.250.07515.70.04120.650.22528.70.03130.900.4152.50.02281.20.7578.70.02161.71.121310.01912.51.871800.04448.02.572400.1667402.853000.3160952.934000.45921843.095000.56462823.116000.65813952.93 Open table in a new tab Subcellular Fractionation and Western Blot Analyses—S. pombe NHP057 (ncs1Δ) bearing pREP42-ncs1-EGFP or pREP42-ncs1G2A-EGFP were grown for 20 h after induction of nmt1 promoter (by decreasing the thiamine concentration in the media from 2 μm down to 0.05 μm) to midlog phase and rinsed in EB buffer (15 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing either 1 mm CaCl2 or 10 mm each of EDTA and EGTA. Cells were then lysed by glass beads in the same buffer containing either 0.2 mm CaCl2 or chelating reagents (5 mm each of EDTA and EGTA), and the cell-free extract (lysate) was obtained after centrifugation at ∼500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration of the lysate was determined, and each lysate was adjusted with its respective buffer to the same final concentration. Part of these cell-free extracts, 100 μl each, was subjected to centrifugation for 30 min at ∼16,000 × g resulting in the pellet and supernatant fractions. The pellet was resuspended with an equal volume of the appropriate lysis buffer. The lysate, supernatant fractions, and resuspended pellets were subjected to SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide) followed by Western blot analysis with anti-GFP antibody (mouse polyclonal antibody, Clontech). Signals were detected using chemiluminescent substrate (Super Signal West Dura, Pierce). In the case of experiments in Fig. 9C (right panel), cells were lysed in EB buffer without any additional CaCl2 or chelating reagents, and whole lysate was loaded on the gel.

https://openalex.org/W2158014908,"We have recently identified in two unrelated patients with bleeding tendency a homozygous mutation causing a deletion of one of the two contiguous Lys9/Lys10 residues in the A-chain of α-thrombin (ΔK9). We used in vitro expression analysis to clarify the role of the deletion of Lys9 or Lys10 in the thrombin function. The kcat/Km value of the hydrolysis by ΔK9 of the synthetic substrate Phe-Pip-Arg-p-nitroanilide (where Pip represents l-pipecolyl) and fibrinopeptide A was 18- and 60-fold lower, respectively, compared with wild type (WT). Interaction with antithrombin was also reduced in the mutant, the association rate being about 20-fold lower than in the WT thrombin. The sensitivity to sodium ion of ΔK9 was found significantly attenuated compared with the WT form. ΔK9 has a very weak platelet-activating capacity, attributed to a severely defective PAR1 interaction, whereas the binding to the platelet glycoprotein Ibα was unaffected. Likewise, the interaction with protein C was severely impaired, whereas interaction with thrombomodulin had a normal Kd value. At variance with these findings, both low affinity (basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor) and high affinity (N-α-[2-naphthylsulfonyl-glycyl]-4-amidinophenylalanine-piperidide) thrombin inhibitors displayed a better binding to ΔK9 than to the WT form, indicating a better accommodation of these inhibitors into the catalytic pocket of ΔK9. A molecular dynamics simulation of the ΔK9 thrombin in full explicit water solvent provided support to the role of the A-chain in affecting conformation and catalytic properties of the B-chain, especially in some insertion loops of the enzyme, such as the 60-loop, as well as in the geometry of the catalytic triad residues.

The level of prothrombin antigen measured in plasma was 15%, whereas the coagulant activity ranged from less than 1% to about 2.5% (1Akhavan S. Mannucci P.M. Lak M. Mancuso G. Mazzucconi M.G. Rocino A. Jenkins P.V. Perkins S.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2000; 84: 989-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Prothrombin deficiency is an autosomal recessive bleeding disorder characterized by two phenotypes: hypoprothrombinemia, with concomitantly low levels of coagulant activity and antigen (type I), and dysprothrombinemia, with very low activity but subnormal or normal antigen levels (type II). These disorders are rare, and there is always residual prothrombin procoagulant activity measurable in patients, the phenotype found in prothrombin-deficient mice indicating that complete prothrombin deficiency may be lethal in humans (2Sun W.Y.

Among these natural dysprothrombins, amino acid residues of the thrombin A-chain were found to be rarely involved (1Akhavan S. Mannucci P.M. Lak M. Mancuso G. Mazzucconi M.G. Rocino A. Jenkins P.V.

The A-chain in human thrombin is composed of 36 amino acid residues, which are connected to the catalytic B-chain by a single disulfide bond (8Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). This chain has no analog in the prototypic serine protease trypsin, although chymotrypsin and other trypsin-like blood coagulation enzymes, such as factor IX and factor XI, contain A-chain analogs (9Hartley B.S. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. London Ser. B. 1970; 257: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 10Fujikawa K. Legaz M.E. Kato H. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 4508-4516Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Some structural analogies between the A-chains present in different serine proteases, as in the case of thrombin and chymotrypsin, were identified, although the function of the A-chain has not yet been well established. The thrombin A-chain is organized mainly in a multiple-turn and partly helical conformation and a boomerang-like shape, making a smooth contour of the B-chain part, opposite to the active site pocket (8Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). The A-chain is topologically similar to the activation peptide of chymotrypsin(ogen) and connected in a similar manner through the Cys1-Cys122 disulfide bridge to the B-chain. Most of the A-B chain interactions involve charged side chains; six are buried salt bridges, and 10 are involved in interchain hydrogen bonds (8Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Stabilization within the A-chain also occurs, mostly via polar and salt bridge interactions. The N-terminal segment of the A-chain up to E1c is characterized by relatively weak electron density in the d-Phe-Pro-Arg-methyl ketone-thrombin crystal (8Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), and seems to have a high degree of conformational flexibility (8Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). The C-terminal segment up to Y14j is an amphiphilic α-helix forming one and one-half turns and showing a high degree of flexibility as well (8Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). The central region is the most rigid segment of the A-chain and contains strong salt bridges, such as that involving the Asp1a-Lys9 side chains (8Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), which is characterized by a high electrostatic energy (-1.8 kcal/mol), significantly contributing to confer the boomerang-like shape to the chain (8Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Not all of the coagulation serine proteases bear an A-chain, hence its general role has not been precisely established. In a previous study, carried out on bovine thrombin, it has been proposed that the A-chain, although strongly linked to the B-chain through strong electrostatic and apolar bonds, does not play a major role in the specificity of the enzyme catalytic activity (11Hageman T.C. Endres G.F. Scheraga H.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 171: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast, subsequent studies carried out on human thrombin showed that isolated B-chain has a markedly reduced proteolytic and amidase activity compared with the native enzyme (12Sereiskaia A.A. Osadchuk T.V. Korneliuk A.I. Pekhnik I.V. Serebrianyi S.B. Biokhimiia. 1989; 54: 542-548PubMed Google Scholar). With the aim of gaining insights into the role of the A-chain in human thrombin, we used in vitro expression analysis of the natural mutant bearing a deletion of Lys9 (ΔK9). The wild-type (WT) 2The abbreviations used are: WT, wild type; AT, antithrombin; BPTI, basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor; α-NAPAP, N-α-[2-naphthylsulfonyl-glycyl]-4-amidinophenylalanine-piperidide; MD, molecular dynamics; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; pNA, p-nitroanilide; Pip, l-pipecolyl. 2The abbreviations used are: WT, wild type; AT, antithrombin; BPTI, basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor; α-NAPAP, N-α-[2-naphthylsulfonyl-glycyl]-4-amidinophenylalanine-piperidide; MD, molecular dynamics; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; pNA, p-nitroanilide; Pip, l-pipecolyl. prothrombin and mutant cDNAs were stably transfected in Chinese hamster ovary cell lines expressing high levels of prothrombin for experiments probing their functional properties. In order to understand their different functional properties, we performed a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the ΔK9 thrombin mutant in full explicit water solvent. Our simulation, in conjunction with a comparative analysis of available crystal structures of free or ligand-bound WT thrombins, provided insightful support to the role of the A-chain in affecting conformation and catalytic properties of the B-chain. Patients—We investigated the molecular defects in two Iranian patients with prothrombin deficiency and a severe hemorrhagic diathesis. Clinical and laboratory findings pertaining to these patients were previously reported in detail (1Akhavan S. Mannucci P.M. Lak M. Mancuso G. Mazzucconi M.G. Rocino A. Jenkins P.V. Perkins S.J.

DNA Analysis—Following DNA extraction from leukocytes, the coding region, intron/exon boundaries, and 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of the prothrombin gene were amplified by PCR screened for mutations by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and sequenced using an ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (ABI 373; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The primers used in the PCR and sequencing are identical to those used in a previous study (1Akhavan S. Mannucci P.M. Lak M. Mancuso G. Mazzucconi M.G. Rocino A. Jenkins P.V. Perkins S.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2000; 84: 989-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis and Construction of Expression Vectors—Full-length cDNA of human prothrombin (including 38 bp of 5′-untranslated region and 97 bp of 3′-untranslated region) was obtained by PCR amplification of M13mp18 (kindly provided by Dr. Barbara C. Furie). The construction of plasmid PT7SalI FII-WTEcoRI was previously described (13Akhavan S. De Cristofaro R. Peyvandi F. Lavoretano S. Landolfi R. Mannucci P.M. Blood. 2002; 100: 1347-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To investigate the influence of the Lys9 deletion (ΔK9) on prothrombin activity, mutant FII-ΔK9 was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of PT7-SalIFII-WTEcoRI using a commercially available kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Oligonucleotide (5′-CTGTTCGA---GAAGTCGCTGGAGGACAAAACCGAAAGAGAGCTTCTAGAATCCTACATC-3′) spanning nucleotides 1021-1080 of the human FII cDNA were used to introduce an in-frame deletion of 3 bp, nucleotides 1029-1031 (GAA deletion). This primer also introduced a XbaI restriction site (underlined), arising from two silent CCT to TCT and GGA to AGA mutations at nucleotides 1065 and 1068, respectively, to facilitate screening for clones carrying the mutation. The cloned insert was sequenced, and sequencing confirmed that the mutation had been introduced. To obtain stable cell lines expressing recombinant FII-WT and FII-ΔK9, we used dihydrofolate reductase-deficient Chinese ovary cells (CHO-DUKX-B11). These cells were grown in α-modified essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol/liter l-glutamine, 10 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 8 μg/ml vitamin K1 (Phytonadione; Abbott), 10 μg/ml adenosine, 10 μg/ml deoxyadenosine, and 10 μg/ml thymidine in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. The DNA of pED-FII-WT or pED-FII-ΔK301 (30 ng) were transfected by electroporation into 5 × 106 CHO cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two days after transfection, cells were selected for dihydrofolate reductase expression using medium deficient in ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleotides. A single clone stably transfected with each construct and expressing high levels of FII was selected for further experiments. Purification of Wild Type and ΔK9 Prothrombin—Activation of ΔK9 prothrombin was obtained using the Taipan snake venom, whereas ecarin slowly activated the mutant zymogen (data not shown). It is known that the Taipan snake prothrombin activator acts as a Factor Xa-Factor Va complex, since it directly activates prothrombin through cleavages of the Arg271-Thr272 peptide bond at the junction between A-chain and fragment 2 besides the additional cleavage of the Arg320-Ile321 peptide bond (14Speijer H. Govers-Riemslag J.W. Zwaal R.F. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prothrombin activation was obtained by incubating for 2 h at 37 °C 1 μm ΔK9 prothrombin (or the WT form) with 0.2 mg/ml Taipan snake venom in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, synthetic phospholipid reagent containing a colloidal silica activator and used at a 1:5 dilution of the stock solution (SynthAsil APTT reagent, Instrumentation Laboratory, Milan, Italy), pH 8.00. The generated active ΔK9 thrombin was successfully purified by cation exchange HPLC, being eluted ∼5 min before WT thrombin. This finding is in agreement with the lack of one positive charge related to the missing lysine residue in the A-chain of the mutant thrombin. SDS-PAGE of pooled chromatographic peaks was carried out on 4-20% gradient gels under both reducing (5% β-mercaptoethanol) and nonreducing conditions in a Bio-Rad mini-PROTEAN II apparatus. The pooled peak contained a single band of roughly 36 kDa, whose identity was further checked by N-terminal sequencing. To obtain purified A-chain from both WT and ΔK9 thrombin, the peak obtained in the ion exchange chromatography was reduced by 5% β-mercaptoethanol and analyzed through RP-HPLC using a C4 resin (High Pore RP-304 250 × 4.6 mm; Bio-Rad). The applied gradient was 10-40% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The elution was followed at 224 nm. The peak relative to the A-chain was eluted after 17.8 min for the WT species, whereas it appeared after 17 min in the case of ΔK9 thrombin. These peaks were pooled, dried, and solubilized in acetonitrile/water/trifluoroacetic acid (49:49:2 by volume) before sequencing was performed. An automatic liquid phase sequencer (ABI-PerkinElmer model 477A) connected to an HPLC apparatus (ABI-PerkinElmer model 120A, PTH-analyzer), and a Bio-Rad reverse-phase C18 column were used to determine the N-terminal sequencing. Identification of the cleavage products was based on the amino acid sequences of the human prothrombin (15Degen S.J. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6165-6177Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The concentration of recombinant thrombins was measured spectrophotometrically at 280 nm, using an extinction coefficient (0.1%) equal to 1.83. Active site titration was carried out spectrophotometrically, as previously reported (16De Cristofaro R. Rocca B. Bizzi B. Landolfi R. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The purified enzyme was immediately aliquoted and frozen at -80 °C until use. Effect of Na+ and Viscosity on the Michaelis-Menten Parameters Pertaining to Hydrolysis of the Synthetic Substrates d-Phe-Pip-Arg-pNA—Michaelis-Menten parameters, kcat and Km, were calculated as previously detailed (16De Cristofaro R. Rocca B. Bizzi B. Landolfi R. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 6000, pH 8.00, at 25 °C (buffer A). The enzyme concentration was typically 0.5 nm for WT and 5-10 nm for the ΔK9 thrombin form. In the experiments without sodium, NaCl was substituted with a cation not interacting with thrombin, tetramethylammonium chloride, which was used at the same concentration to keep constant the ionic strength of the solution (17Stone S.R. Betz A. Hofsteenge J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9841-9848Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The effect of the viscogenic agent sucrose, used over a 0-0.8 m concentration range in buffer A, was investigated according to a previously detailed kinetic and analytical scheme (16De Cristofaro R. Rocca B. Bizzi B. Landolfi R. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 17Stone S.R. Betz A. Hofsteenge J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9841-9848Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 18Wells C.M. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11721-11730Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 19De Cristofaro R. Landolfi R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the canonical scheme for serine proteases amidase activity was applied, E+S⇌k-1k+1ES→k2EP*→k3E+PScheme 1 where k+1, k-1, k2, and k3 are the kinetic rate constant of the substrate association and dissociation, acylation, and deacylation of thrombin, respectively, and EP* is the acyl-enzyme intermediate, and P is the final product. The equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd, can be calculated from the k-1/k+1 ratio. Experimental data sets were simultaneously fitted to the appropriate equations (16De Cristofaro R. Rocca B. Bizzi B. Landolfi R. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 17Stone S.R. Betz A. Hofsteenge J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9841-9848Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), using the GRAFIT software (Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, UK). Fibrinopeptide A Release—Fibrinopeptide A release by both WT and ΔK9 thrombin in buffer A was monitored by reverse transcriptase-HPLC, using a previously reported method (20Picozzi M. Landolfi R. De Cristofaro R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Purified plasmin- and fibronectin-free fibrinogen from American Diagnostica (Instrumentation Laboratory, Milan, Italy) was used as substrate. The enzyme concentration was 0.2 and 2 nm, for the WT and the mutated form, respectively. The Michaelis parameters were computed as indicated above for the synthetic substrate. Measurement of kcat/Km for Protein C Activation and Interaction with Thrombomodulin—Hydrolysis by WT and ΔK9 thrombin of zymogen protein C, purchased from American Diagnostica (Instrumentation Laboratory, Milan, Italy), was performed in buffer A, as previously reported in detail (21De Cristofaro R. Landolfi R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of protein C (2 μm) was followed in the presence of 100 nm human thrombomodulin (American Diagnostica), since in the absence of the cofactor, the reaction was too slow to be correctly analyzed. Likewise, binding of the thrombin forms to immobilized human thrombomodulin (nonlipidated form, from American Diagnostica) was investigated according to a previously reported method (21De Cristofaro R. Landolfi R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Inhibition of WT and ΔK9 Thrombin Forms by Antithrombin, Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor (BPTI), and N-α-[2-Naphthylsulfonyl-glycyl]-4-amidinophenylalanine-piperidide (α-NAPAP)—Pseudo-first order kinetics formalism was used to investigate the interaction of WT and ΔK9 thrombin forms with antithrombin (AT) (Enzyme Research, Indianapolis, IN) in the absence and presence of heparin in buffer A. In the absence of heparin, AT was used in concentrations ranging between 10 and 15 μm in buffer A at 25 °C. The reaction with thrombin was started by adding 0.1 nm WT or 5-10 nm ΔK9, and the release of p-nitroaniline was measured as a function of time at 405 nm. The measurements were performed in duplicate. The association second order rate constant, kon, for thrombin-AT interaction was calculated as reported (22De Cristofaro R. De Candia E. Rutella S. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3887-3895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Progress curve kinetics was also used to derive the kon value of AT interaction with WT and ΔK9 mutant thrombin in the presence of high molecular weight heparin from porcine intestinal mucosa (Sigma; sodium salt Grade I-A, 170 United States Pharmacopeia/mg, average Mr = 16,500), as described (22De Cristofaro R. De Candia E. Rutella S. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3887-3895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Heparin concentration was equal to 75 nm in functional experiments using 0.15 μm AT, 0.15 nm WT form, or 10 nm ΔK9 and 100 μm Phe-Pip-Arg-pNA as the substrate. WT and ΔK9 mutant thrombin interaction with BPTI (Sigma) was performed in buffer A, according to a previously described “matrix” method (21De Cristofaro R. Landolfi R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Competitive inhibition of the synthetic substrate Phe-Pip-Arg-pNA hydrolysis was used to monitor the inhibitor interaction with both the WT and ΔK9 thrombins. BPTI effect on the substrate's hydrolysis was investigated using the inhibitor over a concentration range from 0 to 1 mm, whereas α-NAPAP (Sigma) was used between 0 and 100 nm concentration. All of the experimental points taken at different inhibitor concentrations (BPTI or α-NAPAP) as a function of the substrate concentration were simultaneously fitted to a competitive inhibition of the Michaelis equation, as previously reported (19De Cristofaro R. Landolfi R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), using the GRAFIT software (Erithacus Software). This method allowed us to calculate the equilibrium dissociation constant of the inhibitor's binding to thrombin. Measurement of the PAR1 Peptide Hydrolysis—Hydrolysis of the PAR1 peptide (PAR1P, NH2-LDPRSFLLRNPNDKYEPFWEDEE-COOH, synthesized by Primm s.r.l., Milan, Italy) by the different thrombin forms was followed by measuring the release of the peptide LDPR, resulting from the cleavage of the NH2 terminus of PAR1, according to a previously described method (22De Cristofaro R. De Candia E. Rutella S. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3887-3895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5 μm PAR1P peptide was incubated with 50-100 pm WT or 10 nm ΔK9 thrombins in 10 mm HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 6000, pH 7.5, at 25 °C. At time intervals (1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, and 15 min), the reaction was stopped with 0.3 m HClO4, and the cleaved peptide was measured by reversed-phase HPLC, using a 250 × 4.6-mm RP-304 column (Bio-Rad), as previously reported (22De Cristofaro R. De Candia E. Rutella S. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3887-3895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Interactions with Platelets—We compared the effects of WT and ΔK9 thrombins on the enzyme capacity to activate gel-filtered platelets, which were prepared in 10 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 5.5 mm glucose, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.50, at 25 °C, according to a previously described method (22De Cristofaro R. De Candia E. Rutella S. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3887-3895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In these experiments, thrombin concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 128 nm. Aggregation of gel-filtered platelets (3 × 105/μl) was studied in a PACKS 4 aggregometer (Helena Laboratories, Milan, Italy), using a final volume of 500 μl. Aggregation response was evaluated by taking into account the maximum velocity of transmittance increase per minute (expressed as a percentage of transmittance, set by using plain buffer). Molecular Dynamics Calculations—The x-ray structure of human thrombin covalently bound to d-Phe-Pro-Arg-methyl ketone, determined at 1.9-Å resolution (Protein Data Bank entry 1ppb) (8Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), was used as the starting structure. The covalently bound inhibitor was removed, and the structure of the free enzyme was used as a template for generating the ΔK9 mutant protein (Swiss-Prot; available on the World Wide Web at www.expasy.ch). The protein structure was solvated with water in a periodic truncated octahedron, to produce a 12-Å water shell. All solvent molecules within 1.5 Å of any protein atom were then removed. The GROMACS 3.1.4-1 software package, running on a Linux PC cluster, was used for the MD simulations and analysis of the trajectories. The total charge of the ΔK9 protein was +2, and no counterions was added. The entire system consisted of 3060 protein atoms and 12,759 water molecules. The initial structure ΔK9 mutant thrombin was energy-minimized by using 200 steps of steepest descent with the protein constrained and then 1000 steps of conjugate gradient, with the entire system free, in order to remove bad contacts. During the simulations, the system was coupled to an external temperature bath with a coupling constants of 0.1 ps (23Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.P.M. van Gunsteren W.F. Di Nola A. Haak J.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81: 3684-3690Crossref Scopus (23441) Google Scholar). The Gromos-96 force field (24van Gunsteren W.F. Daura X. Mark A.E. Encycl. Comput. Chem. 1998; 2: 1211-1216Google Scholar) was used for minimization procedures, with a time step of 2 fs. Water molecules were modeled according to the “simple point charge” model (25Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.P.M. van Gunsteren W.F. Hermans J. Pullman B. Intermolecular Forces. Reidel, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1981: 331-342Google Scholar). The LINCS algorithm (26Hess B. Bekker H. Fraaije J. Berendsen H.J.C. J. Comput. Chem. 1997; 18: 1463-1472Crossref Scopus (11564) Google Scholar) was used to constrain all bond lengths. The nonbonded interactions were cut off at 8 Å (short range cut-off radius) and 12 Å (long range cut-off radius) for both Coulombic and Lennard-Jones interactions. The short range nonbonded interactions were updated every time step, whereas the interactions within the long range radius were updated every five time steps. Initial velocities were assigned according to a Maxwellian distribution at the desired temperature. The density of the system was adjusted by performing the first equilibration runs under number pressure temperature conditions by weak coupling to a bath of constant pressure (p = 1 bar, coupling time of 0.5 ps). The simulation, starting from the initial structure, was equilibrated by 50 ps of MD run with position restraints on the protein to allow the solvent molecules to be relaxed, followed by another 50-ps run without restraints. Production dynamics were performed under number volume temperature conditions for 18 ns, and the coordinates saved every 10 ps. To investigate the influence of the Lys9 deletion on prothrombin biosy"

Membrane potential, channel phosphorylation, or auxiliary subunit association tightly regulate these interactions and the consequent inhibition of Ca2+ current. We now provide evidence that intracellular Ca2+ concentration and phosphoinositides play a stabilizing role in this direct voltage-dependent inhibition. Lowering resting cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in Xenopus oocytes expressing CaV2Ca2+ channels strongly decreased basal as well as phasic, agonist-dependent inhibition of Ca2+ channels by G-proteins. Decreasing phosphoinositide levels also suppressed G-protein inhibition and completely occluded the effects of a subsequent injection of Ca2+ chelator. Similar regulations are observed in mouse dorsal root ganglia neurons. Alteration of G-protein block by these agents is independent of protein phosphorylation, cytoskeleton dynamics, and GTPase or GDP/GTP exchange activity, suggesting a direct action at the level of the Ca2+ channel/Gβγ-protein interaction. Moreover, affinity binding experiments of intracellular loops of the CaV2.1 Ca2+ channels to different phospholipids revealed specific interactions between the C-terminal tail of the channel and phosphoinositides. Taken together these data indicate that a Ca2+-sensitive interaction of the C-terminal tail of P/Q channels with the plasma membrane is important for G-protein regulation.

Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are the key transducers that couple cellular excitability to several processes including contraction, secretion, and gene regulation. As such, they are tightly regulated by several direct mechanisms that finely tune, either positively or negatively, the spatiotemporal characteristics of the Ca2+ signal to adapt it to the cellular demand and to prevent, via elaborate safety feedback mechanisms, Ca2+ overload and cellular damage. The first of these mechanisms is triggered by Ca2+ ions themselves, which through binding to channel-associated proteins (1DeMaria C.D. Soong T.W. Alseikhan B.A. Alvania R.S. Yue D.T.

Intracellular signaling pathways, activated after G-protein-coupled receptor stimulation, are also important dual regulators of Ca2+ influx, either directly (via the Gβγ dimer) or indirectly via phosphorylation of the channel α1 and/or β subunits (11Stea A. Soong T.W. Snutch T.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 929-940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 12Mogul D.J. Adams M.E. Fox A.P. Neuron. 1993; 10: 327-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Gβγ dimers are able to directly interact with several domains of the α1 CaV2.1, CaV2.2 or CaV2.3 subunits, including the loop connecting domains I to II and the N- and C-terminal tails of the channel, thus forcing the channel into a reluctant state of low open probability (13Herlitze S.

Nature. 1997; 385: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of the channel, however, is known to facilitate channel activity partly by removing Gβγ inhibition (15Zamponi G.W. Bourinet E. Nelson D. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Recently, a third type of dual regulation has been characterized on CaV2.1 voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. In this latter case, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), 1The abbreviations used are: PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PI, phosphatidylinositol; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; GDPβS, guanyl-5′-yl thiophosphate; DRG, dorsal root ganglia; DAMGO, [d-Ala, N-Me-Phe,Gly-ol]-enkephalin; PTX, pertussis toxin; PH domain, pleckstrin homology domain. 1The abbreviations used are: PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PI, phosphatidylinositol; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; GDPβS, guanyl-5′-yl thiophosphate; DRG, dorsal root ganglia; DAMGO, [d-Ala, N-Me-Phe,Gly-ol]-enkephalin; PTX, pertussis toxin; PH domain, pleckstrin homology domain. a well known regulatory phospholipid for potassium channels, has been suggested to bind directly to two sites of the CaV2.1 channel, preventing Ca2+ current rundown but also promoting voltage-dependent inhibition of channel activity (17Wu L. Bauer C.S. Zhen X.G. Xie C. Yang J. Nature. 2002; 419: 947-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Because Gβγ-dependent regulation of many channels and enzymes has been shown to be under the control of both Ca2+ ions and PIP2 directly, through specific binding of PIP2 on the protein or indirectly via activation of enzymatic cascades, we asked whether similar cross-regulations may exist in the case of the Gβγ-induced inhibition of CaV2 Ca2+. We describe here a new feedback mechanism by which a decrease in the intracellular Ca2+ and/or PIP2 concentrations may alter the direct inhibition of the CaV2 Ca2+ channel subfamily by G-proteins. When the Ca2+ chelating agent BAPTA was injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing CaV2.1 or CaV2.2 Ca2+ channels, a marked increase in current amplitude developed consecutive to the removal of the tonic inhibition of the channel imposed by free G-protein βγ dimers. This increase was independent of channel phosphorylation or GTPase or GDP/GTP exchange activities but was occluded by injection of anti-PIP2 antibody or by treatment with phosphoinositide-kinase inhibitor. Injection of anti-PIP2 by itself produced an increase in current amplitude similar to BAPTA, suggesting that both Ca2+ and PIP2 are necessary for G-protein regulation. BAPTA and anti-PIP2 strongly reduced the GTPγS-induced Ca2+ current facilitation in mouse DRG neurons. Binding assays revealed a direct interaction between the C-terminal tail of the channel and the phosphoinositides. We thus propose that stabilization of a Gβγ-sensitive state of Ca2+ channel may require direct interaction with membrane phosphoinositides and may represent one of the mechanisms by which PIP2 down-regulates Ca2+ channel activity. Cytosolic Ca2+, acting at the PIP2 and/or the channel level, is an important cofactor. Materials and Oocyte Preparation—BAPTA (Sigma), nitro-BAPTA, di-Br-BAPTA, di-methyl BAPTA, and DM-nitrophen (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) were prepared at 100 mm in HEPES 10 mm (pH 7.2 with CsOH) for on-line injection into oocytes. In Fig. 1, BAPTA was loaded with 20% Ca2+. DAMGO (Sigma) was prepared daily at 10 μm from a frozen stock solution at 10 mm. H9 (1 mm), H89 (100 μm), staurosporine (3 μm), and cytochalasin B (20 μg/ml) were prepared at the mentioned concentration and added to the incubation medium overnight. Genistein (50 μm), paclitaxel (30 μm), colchicine (20 μm), and wortmannin (10 μm) were added to the incubation medium 1–3 h before recordings were made. All of these drugs were also included in the recording Ba2+-containing solution at the mentioned concentration. Anti-PIP2 antibody (Echelon Biosciences Inc., Salt Lake city, UT) was injected into oocytes giving a final estimated dilution of 1:50. In the experiments describing the effects of GTPγS, the Gαo G-protein subunit cDNA was coinjected with the Ca2+ channel subunit cDNA. X. laevis oocyte preparation and injection were performed as described previously (18Cens T. Mangoni M.E. Richard S. Nargeot J. Charnet P. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 431: 771-774PubMed Google Scholar). Each oocyte was injected with 5–10 nl of a cDNA mixture containing the α1 + α2-δ + β cDNAs at ≈0.3 ng/nl with a ratio of 1:2:3. When one or more of these cDNAs were omitted, cDNA concentrations were kept constant by the addition of the appropriate volume of deionized water. Oocytes were kept for 2–4 days at 18 °C under gentle agitation before use. Electrophysiology—Whole-cell Ba2+ currents were recorded under two electrode voltage clamp using the GeneClamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Current and voltage electrodes (less than 1 megohm) were filled with 3 m KCl, pH 7.2, with KOH. Ba2+ current recordings were performed using the following external solution (in mm): BaOH 10, tetraethylammonium hydroxide 20, N-methyl-d-glucamine 50, CsOH 2, HEPES 10, pH 7.2, with methanesulfonic acid. Currents were filtered and digitized using a Digidata-1200 interface (Axon Instruments) and were subsequently stored on a Pentium-based personal computer using version 6.02 pClamp software (Axon Instruments). Around 10–30 nl of BAPTA buffer (in mm) (BAPTA-free acid 100, CsOH 10, HEPES 10, pH 7.2, CsOH) was injected into the oocytes (10 p.s.i., 150 ms) during the course of the experiment at the times indicated. Ba2+ currents were recorded during a 400-ms test pulse from –80 mV to +10 mV. Current amplitudes were measured at the peak of the current. Comparisons of averaged amplitudes between batches were always performed on currents measured on the same number of days following injection. Comparisons between experiments were made by normalizing all average amplitudes with respect to the control current amplitude set at 100%. Isochronal steady-state inactivation curves (2.5 s of conditioning voltage followed by a 400-ms test pulse to +10 mV) were fitted using the following equation, I/Imax=Rin+(1-Rin)/(1+exp((V-Vin)/kin))(Eq. 1) where I is the current amplitude measured during the test pulse to +10 mV for conditioning voltage steps varying from –80 to +50 mV, Imax is the current amplitude measured during the test pulse for a conditioning step to –80 mV, Vin is the potential for half-inactivation, V is the conditioning voltage, kin is the slope factor, and Rin is the proportion of non-inactivating current. Current to voltage curves were fitted using the following equation, I/Imax=G×(V-Erev)/(1+exp((V-Vact)/k))(Eq. 2) where I is the current amplitude measured during depolarizations varying from –80 to +50 mV, Imax is the peak current amplitude measured at the maximum of the current-voltage curve, G is the normalized macroscopic conductance, Erev is the apparent reversal potential, Vact is the potential for half-activation, V is the value of the depolarization, and k is a slope factor. Inactivation kinetics were estimated by fitting Ba2+ current decay with two exponential components using the following equation, I(t)=A1e(-t/τ1)+A2e(-t/τ2)+C(Eq. 3) where I is the current amplitude, t is time, τ1, τ2, A1, and A2 represent the time constants and amplitudes of the two components, and C is a constant. The proportion of the slow time constant (%τ2) is the ratio A2/(A1 + A2). Mouse DRG Neurons—Adult female Swiss mice (6 to 12 weeks old) were killed by CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation, and neuron cultures were established from lumbar dorsal root ganglia as described previously (19Andre S. Puech-Mallie S. Desmadryl G. Valmier J. Scamps F. Neuroreport. 2003; 14: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Dissociated neurons were plated on poly-d-l-ornithine (0.5 mg/ml)-laminin (5 μg/ml)-coated glass coverslips at a density of 2500 neurons/well and were incubated in an incubator with a humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere. Experiments were performed on neurons of 30–40-μm diameter at room temperature (20–24 °C) after 12–24 h in culture. Ba2+ currents were recorded in the whole-cell mode using the Axopatch 200B amplifier and Clampex (version 8) software (Axon Instruments) with the following extracellular solution (in mm): BaCl2 5, TEA-Cl 140, HEPES 10, glucose 10, pH adjusted to 7.4, with Cs-OH. Pipettes (4–6 meghoms) were filled with CsCl 145, GTPγS 1, MgATP 2, HEPES 10, and either EGTA 1, or BAPTA 10; pH was adjusted to 7.3 with CsOH. In experiments with anti-PIP2, the antibody was diluted at 1:30 in the EGTA-containing pipette solution. Signals were filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 5 kHz. The experimental paradigms were essentially the same as in oocytes (see Fig. 7). Usually, current recordings started 1–2 min after patch rupture. Currents were measured at their peak amplitudes. Baclofen-stimulated GTP Binding Assay—Rat brain membranes were prepared as described (20Lorenzen A. Fuss M. Vogt H. Schwabe U. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 115-123PubMed Google Scholar) and further diluted in the following solution (in mm unless specified otherwise): Tris/HCl 50, BAPTA 10, 1, 0.1, or 0.01, MgCl2 5, dithiothreitol 10, GDP 0.01, GTPγS35 0.5–1 nm, and leupeptin 0.01 mg/ml to reach a total volume of 100 μl at a protein concentration of 50 μg/ml. Baclofen (300 μm) was added for 1 h at 30 °C. Each sample was then filtered on a glass fiber C (Millipore) and submitted to scintillation counting. Values were corrected for basal GTP incorporation obtained under similar conditions without added baclofen. Experiments were performed in triplicate. All values are presented as means ± S.E. of n experiments. Statistical significance was determined by analysis with the non-paired Student's t test (0.05 level). Phospholipid Binding Assays—Phospholipids immobilized on nitrocellulose strip (PIP-strips P-6001, Echelon Biosciences Inc., Salt Lake City, UT) were first blocked for 90 min with bovine serum albumin dissolved at 3% in binding buffer according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Binding of CaV2.1 intracellular loops was performed overnight at room temperature using 50 μl of in vitro translated 35S-labeled intracellular loop (T7 TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate, Promega) diluted in 1 ml of binding buffer. After three washes with bovine serum albumin, binding was visualized with a Thyphoon phosphorimaging device. The following cDNA were used (GenBank™ accession numbers are given): CaV1.2 (α1C), M67515; CaV2.1 (α1A), M64373; CaV2.2 (α1B), D14157; CaV2.3 (α1E), L15453; α2-δ1, M86621; β1b, X61394; β2a, M80545; β3, M88751; β4, L02315; μ opioid receptor, NM013071. Injection of the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA (100 mm in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2; estimated final concentration of BAPTA, 2–5 mm) into oocytes expressing the CaV2.1 α1A + α2-δ Ca2+ channel subunits induced a slow increase in Ba2+ current amplitude that reached a steady state in 5–6 min with a time constant of 1.3 ± 0.03 min (n = 90, Fig. 1A). On average, this increase was 2.8 ± 0.2-fold (n = 90) and appeared independently of the inhibition of the endogenous Ca2+-activated Cl– current, because it could be recorded from batches of oocytes in which the contamination by this current was almost negligible (see current traces in Fig. 1 for example). Concomitant with the increase in current amplitude, a significant acceleration of the inactivation kinetics was also recorded (see current traces in Fig. 1A) without marked modifications in either the activation or the inactivation parameters (see supplemental material). Loading BAPTA at 20% with Ca2+ (mixture of 100 mm BAPTA and 20 mm CaCl2) greatly reduced the capacity of BAPTA to increase CaV2.1 Ba2+ currents (Fig. 1B, left). Injection of a panel of different calcium chelators (nitro-BAPTA, dibromo-BAPTA, dimethyl-BAPTA or DM-nitrophen) with different dissociation constants for Ca2+ clearly produced an increase in current amplitude that was related to their affinity for Ca2+ (Fig. 1B, right), indicating that the action of BAPTA and other chelators was more likely mediated by their capacity to reduce resting cytosolic Ca2+ rather than by buffering the Ca2+ signal or by unspecific pharmacological effects. We next analyzed the effects of the intracellular injection of BAPTA on oocytes expressing different types of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and different combinations of auxiliary subunits (Fig. 1C). Although a similar increase (2.5–3-fold) was recorded when BAPTA was injected into oocytes expressing the CaV2.2 subunit, expression of CaV1.2 or CaV2.3 (brain isoform (21Soong T.W. Stea A. Hodson C.D. Dubel S.J. Vincent S.R. Snutch T.P. Traffic. 1993; 260: 1133-1136Google Scholar)) severely depressed the effects of BAPTA. Moreover, although removing the α2-δ subunit cDNA from the injection mix did not significantly modify the effect of BAPTA (Fig. 1C, bars labeled CaV2.1 and CaV2.1+α2-δ), co-expression of an auxiliary Ca2+ channel β subunit (β1, β2, β3, or β4) markedly reduced the increase in current amplitude recorded following injection of BAPTA. Taken together, these results suggested that Ca2+ chelation was only effective on G-protein-sensitive (P/Q and N-type) Ca2+ channels expressed in a configuration that allowed a strong inhibition by G-proteins (i.e. without expression of a β subunit). In control conditions, Ba2+ currents recorded from oocytes expressing the CaV2.1 + α2-δ subunits have been shown to be under a tonic inhibition by endogenously active G-proteins (22Roche J.P. Treistman S.N. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4883-4890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Roche J.P. Anantharam V. Treistman S.N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We thus characterized the involvement of the G-proteins in the potentiation induced by BAPTA. GDPβS (a GDP analog that blocks GDP/GTP exchange and thus favors the inactive trimeric state of the G-protein), when injected into oocytes expressing the CaV2.1 + α2-δ Ca2+ channel subunits, induced a >2.5-fold increase in Ba2+ current amplitude, as expected for the removal of the tonic inhibition (Fig. 2A and Ref. 22Roche J.P. Treistman S.N. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4883-4890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, this injection prevented any effect of a subsequent injection of BAPTA (Fig. 2A). Inversely, GDPβS, when injected after BAPTA, was clearly less effective (Fig. 2A, right panel), thus suggesting that the two substances were acting on the same regulatory pathway. CaV2.1 + α2-δ-expressing oocytes incubated 3 h in the presence of pertussis toxin (PTX) (at 0.1 μg/μl) displayed Ba2+ current amplitudes that were 3–4-fold larger than those recorded under control conditions (Fig. 2B, left). The effects of an injection of BAPTA in these PTX-treated oocytes were reduced by ∼70% (Fig. 2B, right), further demonstrating that a tonic G-protein-dependent regulation of the CaV2.1 Ca2+ channel was present under control conditions and was necessary to record the effects of BAPTA. Direct inhibition of the CaV2.1 Ca2+ channel upon activation of G-protein-coupled receptors occurs mainly through a voltage-dependent pathway via direct binding of the Gβγ dimer onto the I–II loop, the N and C termini of the CaV2.1 Ca2+ channel subunit, and also through a less well characterized voltage-resistant (and Gαi subunit-dependent) pathway (24Page K.M. Canti C. Stephens G.J. Berrow N.S. Dolphin A.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4815-4824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hille B.

Chem. 2001; 276: 28731-28738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To identify the active arm of the G-protein involved in the effects of BAPTA, similar injections of chelator were performed on oocytes submitted to different levels of tonic G-protein inhibition, by co-injecting with CaV2.1 + α2-δ subunits the Gαo, Gαi, or Gβ1γ2 G-protein subunits. Over-expression of Gαi or Gαo greatly increased the Ba2+ current amplitude recorded before injection of BAPTA and strongly decreased the effect of a subsequent injection of BAPTA (Fig. 2B, right). Overexpression of Gβ1γ2 had the opposite effect, giving rise to smaller currents in control conditions but potentiating the effect of an injection of BAPTA by almost 40% when compared with similar injections performed without coexpression of the Gβ1γ2 subunit (Fig. 2B). These data therefore suggested that an excess of active Gβγ subunits tonically inhibited CaV2.1 Ca2+ channels under control conditions. Over-expression of Gαi or Gαo, by quenching free Gβγ, strongly decreased this tonic inhibition, whereas overexpression of Gβγ had the opposite effect. The tonic Gβγ inhibition of the CaV2.1 channel (24Page K.M. Canti C. Stephens G.J. Berrow N.S. Dolphin A.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4815-4824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was voltage-dependent under control conditions, inducing a significant facilitation of the current. This facilitation is clearly seen when comparing current amplitudes recorded during a single depolarization that was preceded, or not, by a strong (50 ms, +100 mV) voltage step (Fig. 2C, compare traces P1 and P2). In BAPTA-injected oocytes, this voltage-dependent facilitation was completely removed, giving way to a small decrease due to channel inactivation (27Herlitze S. Zhong H. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4699-4704Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) during the +100 mV depolarization (Fig. 2C, top traces labeled “after BAPTA”). The same effects were obtained by injection of GDPβS, which, together with the increase in current amplitude, completely suppressed the voltage-dependent current facilitation (Fig. 2C, bottom traces labeled “after GDPβS”). In these GDPβS-injected oocytes, a further injection of BAPTA was without effect on current amplitude (Fig. 2A) and current facilitation (Fig. 2C). These data strongly imply that the chelation of cytosolic Ca2+ was able to remove the voltage-dependent block produced by tonically active Gβγ subunits on CaV2.1 subunits. To gain some insight into the mechanism by which Ca2+ chelation could inhibit Gβγ-dependent regulation of the Ca2+ influx, we explored several regulatory pathways that might interfere with the tonic G-protein-dependent inhibition of the Ca2+ channel. Injection of GTPγS, a GTP analog resistant to hydrolysis, into voltage-clamped CaV2.1 + α2-δ-expressing oocytes produced a marked inhibition of the current amplitude attributed to persistent activation of G-proteins, as seen by the decreased in current amplitude and the augmentation of the prepulse facilitation (Fig. 3A). The subsequent injection of BAPTA completely reversed this inhibition and suppressed the facilitation (Fig. 3A, right), thus discarding any possible involvement of a direct (or indirect, via RGS (28Popov S.G. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. Wilkie T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18962-18968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 29Ishii M. Inanobe A. Kurachi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4325-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar)) Ca2+-dependent activation of the GTPase activity of the Gα subunit. The same argument can be used to exclude any down-regulation of a tonically active Go/Gq-coupled endogenous membrane receptor, suggesting that the action of BAPTA was located downstream of G-protein activation. The similarity between the effects of GDPβS and BAPTA led us to think that the GDP/GTP exchange could be one of the targets by which BAPTA is able to reduce tonic G-protein inhibition. However, BAPTA, at concentrations between 10 μm and 10 mm, was unable to modify the incorporation of GTPγS into neuronal membrane preparations stimulated by the γ-aminobutyric acid-B receptor agonist, baclofen (300 μm, Fig. 3B), suggesting that the GDP/GTP exchange activity was not Ca2+-dependent and thus restricting the effect of BAPTA to the level of the Gβγ-Ca2+ channel α1 subunit interaction. We then tested several pharmacological tools known to interfere with key signaling proteins that could possibly play a role in these effects. Neither the general serine/threonine kinase inhibitors H9, H89, or staurosporine (respective concentrations 1 mm, 0.1 mm, and 3 μm, Fig. 3C) nor the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (50 μm) had any effect on the potentiation induced by BAPTA, suggesting that none of these pathways was involved. Similarly, drugs that increase or decrease the polymerization state of microtubules (paclitaxel or colchicine at 30 and 20 μm, respectively) or actin filaments (cytochalasin B at 20 μg/ml) were also for the most part ineffective (Fig. 3C), with the exception of paclitaxel, which very slightly, but significantly, decreased the effects of BAPTA. Over-expression of a dead mutant of calmodulin, invalidated on the four EF-hands and unable to bind Ca2+, could not prevent the effect of BAPTA (not shown). Similar results were also found with neuronal Ca2+ sensor protein-1, another Ca2+-binding protein involved in Ca2+ channel regulation, 2M. Rousset, T. Cens, and P. Charnet, unpublished data. thus refuting a participation of these two Ca2+-binding proteins in the sensibility to Ca2+ ions. However, preincubation of the oocytes in a solution containing the lipid kinase inhibitor wortmannin (at 1 to 10 μm) strongly inhibited the effects of BAPTA. At these doses wortmannin was able to block both the PI 3- and PI 4-kinases and was therefore expected to reduce the level of PIP2 in the plasma membrane. The recent discovery that PIP2 phospholipids are important regulators of the CaV2.1 channel activity (17Wu L. Bauer C.S. Zhen X.G. Xie C. Yang J. Nature. 2002; 419: 947-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and sensitize G-protein-activated K+ channels to G-proteins (30Jacques J. Sui J.L. Logothetis D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) led us to evaluate the role of PIP2 in the potentiation induced by BAPTA. Injection of an anti-phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate antibody (Fig. 4A, anti-PIP2) into oocytes expressing the CaV2.1 and α2-δ subunits clearly and reproducibly increased the Ba2+ current amplitude (recorded at +10 mV) up to a new steady-state level in 4–5 min. Concomitantly, the current facilitation observed under control conditions after a +100 mV depolarization (Fig. 4A, inset, traces labeled “control”) completely vanished after the injection (Fig. 4A, traces labeled “anti-PIP2”), effects reminiscent of those of BAPTA and suggesti"
https://openalex.org/W2072886932,"L-type dihydropyridine-sensitive voltage dependent Ca2+ channels (L-VDCCs; α1C) are crucial in cardiovascular physiology. Currents via L-VDCCs are enhanced by hormones and transmitters operating via Gq, such as angiotensin II (AngII) and acetylcholine (ACh). It has been proposed that these modulations are mediated by protein kinase C (PKC). However, reports on effects of PKC activators on L-type channels are contradictory; inhibitory and/or enhancing effects have been observed. Attempts to reproduce the enhancing effect of AngII in heterologous expression systems failed. We previously found that PKC modulation of the channel depends on α1C isoform used; only a long N-terminal (NT) isoform was up-regulated. Here we report the reconstitution of the AngII- and ACh-induced enhancement of the long-NT isoform of L-VDCC expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The current initially increased over several minutes but later declined to below baseline levels. Using different NT deletion mutants and human short- and long-NT isoforms of the channel, we found the initial segment of the NT to be crucial for the enhancing, but not for the inhibitory, effect. Using blockers of PKC and of phospholipase C (PLC) and a mutated AngII receptor lacking Gq coupling, we demonstrate that the signaling pathway of the enhancing effect includes the activation of Gq, PLC, and PKC. The inhibitory modulation, present in both α1C isoforms, was Gq- and PLC-independent and Ca2+-dependent, but not Ca2+-mediated, as only basal levels of Ca2+ were essential.

AngII and ACh activate Gq-coupled receptors and are involved in cardiovascular function, regulation of blood pressure, and renal function (5Berk B.C. Corson M.A. Circ.

However, in the smooth muscle, both AngII and ACh are potent vasoconstrictors that both induce Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and elevate intracellular Ca2+ concentration (7Jackson E.K.

Despite the clinical and physiological importance of the regulation of L-type Ca2+ channels by AngII and ACh, the molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. The mechanism of AngII effect on L-type Ca2+ channels has been extensively studied but remains unclear and even controversial. Protein kinase C (PKC) is the most obvious and important mediator of AngII and ACh/m3R action. PKC is activated in native cells following AngII and ACh binding to Gq-coupled receptors (AngII receptor type 1, AT1R, and muscarinic receptors m3R and m1R, respectively). In mammals, PKC inhibitors block AngII-induced vasoconstriction (17Bauer J. Dau C. Cavarape A. Schaefer F. Ehmke H. Parekh N. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1-H7PubMed Google Scholar, 18Nagahama T.

Chem. 2001; 276: 32545-32551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), have been implicated as being potentially involved in the mediation of AngII effects. A major obstacle in studying the molecular mechanisms of AngII and ACh modulations was that these modulations could not be reconstituted in heterologous expression systems. Bouron et al. (36Bouron A. Soldatov N.M. Reuter H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) studied the modulation of human L-VDCC expressed in Xenopus oocytes and reported that following the administration of PMA, the dihydropyridine-sensitive IBa was inhibited. Oz et al. (37Oz M. Melia M.T. Soldatov N.M. Abernethy D.R. Morad M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 1106-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) reported a decrease in Ca2+ current in oocytes expressing α1C and AT1R following application of AngII, due to a Ca2+-dependent mechanism. This effect was blocked by chelating Ca2+ or by depleting intracellular Ca2+ stores with thapsigargin. The failure to reproduce AngII-induced Ca2+ channel enhancement may be related to the use of certain isoforms of α1C that are not modulated by PKC. In the rat and rabbit, two N-terminal (NT) isoforms of α1C (Cav2.1) are known, which probably represent variable splicing products of the same gene (38Snutch T.P. Tomlinson W.J. Leonard J.P. Gilbert M.M. Neuron. 1991; 7: 45-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). These splice variants encode long- and short-NT α1C proteins, with variable initial segments of 46 and 16 amino acids (aa), respectively (38Snutch T.P. Tomlinson W.J. Leonard J.P. Gilbert M.M. Neuron. 1991; 7: 45-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 39Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S.

Studies of the molecular mechanism of PKC modulation of the rabbit long-NT isoform, expressed in Xenopus oocytes, identified the first 46 aa as crucial for PKC modulation (42Shistik E. Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17901-17909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This was further narrowed down to the first 5 aa being essential for PKC action (43Shistik E. Keren-Raifman T. Idelson G.H. Blumenstein Y. Dascal N. Ivanina T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31145-31149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recently, similar N-terminal isoforms of α1C have also been discovered in the human L-VDCC. The novel exon of the human α1C gene, exon 1a, encodes a 46-aa section at the beginning of the N terminus of α1C (the human long-NT isoform), highly homologous to the rabbit long-NT (44Blumenstein Y. Kanevsky N. Sahar G. Barzilai R. Ivanina T. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3419-3423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 45Dai B. Saada N. Echetebu C. Dettbarn C. Palade P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The previously known isoform, human short-NT, contains exon 1b at the beginning of the N terminus, which encodes a section of 16 aa (46Soldatov N.M. Genomics. 1994; 22: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This isoform, used by Bouron et al. (36Bouron A. Soldatov N.M. Reuter H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and Oz et al., (37Oz M. Melia M.T. Soldatov N.M. Abernethy D.R. Morad M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 1106-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), is not up-regulated by PKC, probably because it does not contain the segment crucial for the PKC-induced enhancement of L-VDCC. The long-NT isoform of human L-VDCC, which does contain the crucial segment, is enhanced by PMA (44Blumenstein Y. Kanevsky N. Sahar G. Barzilai R. Ivanina T. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3419-3423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that it would be possible to reconstitute the enhancing effect of AngII and ACh on L-VDCC in a heterologous expression system using the long-NT isoform of α1C. Such reconstitution may greatly facilitate further studies of molecular mechanisms of L-VDCC modulation by neurotransmitters. Here, we demonstrate the reconstitution of the enhancing effect of Gq-coupled receptors on L-VDCC in Xenopus oocytes. The pharmacological characteristics of this modulation are presented. The initial segment of the N terminus is crucial for AngII- and ACh-induced enhancement of the Ca2+ channel current. The activation of Gq, and the subsequent activation of PKC, are clearly involved. The long human isoform of α1C is modulated in a manner similar to the long rabbit isoform, whereas the human short isoform yields currents that are only inhibited by AngII and ACh. Oocyte Culture—Xenopus laevis frogs were maintained and dissected as described (47Dascal N. Lotan I. Protocols in Molecular Neurobiology. 13. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1992: 205-225Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with equal amounts (by weight; 2.5 or 1 ng) of the mRNAs of α1C or its mutants with α2/δ, with or without β2A, with or without 1 ng of m1R or 5 ng of AT1R or AT1RM5, and incubated for 3–5 days at 20–22 °C in NDE96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). Electrophysiology—Whole cell currents were recorded using the Gene Clamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique in a solution containing 40 mm Ba(OH)2, 50 mm NaOH, 2 mm KOH, and 5 mm HEPES, titrated to pH 7.5 with methanesulfonic acid (48Shistik E. Ivanina T. Puri T. Hosey M. Dascal N. J. Physiol. (Lond). 1995; 489: 55-62Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Ca2+ currents were recorded in the same solution but with 40 mm Ca(OH)2 instead of Ba(OH)2. Stock solutions of AngII (10 mm) and ACh (1 m) were stored in 10–20-μl aliquots at -20 °C and added to the recoding solution at a final concentration of 1 and 10 μm, respectively (except for the AngII dose-response experiment). Ba2+ currents were measured by 200-ms steps to +20 mV from a holding potential of -80 mV, every 30 s. U73122, bis-indolylmaleimide (Bis), and staurosporine were prepared essentially as described (49Kanki H. Kinoshita M. Akaike A. Satoh M. Mori Y. Kaneko S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 50Sharon D. Vorobiov D. Dascal N. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In brief, U73122 was dissolved in Me2SO at 20 mm and stored in 10-μl aliquots at -20 °C. Oocytes were injected with 25 nl of 600 μm U73122 and incubated in 10 μm U73122 for 30 min prior to measurements. Oocytes were injected with 50 nl of 300 μm Bis and incubated in 5 μm Bis for 2–4 h before measurement. Oocytes were incubated in 3 μm staurosporine for 2–4 h before measurement. In most experiments, all oocytes were injected with 25 nl of 50 mm BAPTA or EGTA, 30 min or 2–4 h before measurement, respectively, unless otherwise stated. All organic reagents were purchased from Sigma. cDNA Constructs and mRNA—cDNAs of α1C, α2/δ, and β2A were as described (51Singer D. Biel M. Lotan I. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Dascal N. Science. 1991; 253: 1553-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The rabbit heart α1C mutants used here were prepared in our laboratory as described (42Shistik E. Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y.

Rat AT1R and AT1RM5 are in pZeo (53Doan T.N. Ali M.S. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20954-20958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The RNAs were prepared using a standard procedure described previously, which ensures capping of the 5′ end of the RNA and preferential inclusion of non-capped GTP in the rest of the RNA (47Dascal N. Lotan I. Protocols in Molecular Neurobiology. 13. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1992: 205-225Google Scholar). Statistics and Data Presentation—The data are presented as mean ± S.E., n = number of cells tested. To overcome the problem of batch-tobatch variability in current amplitudes, the results were normalized as follows; in each oocyte, IBa was normalized to the basal amplitude (measured before application of an agonist). These normalized values were averaged across all oocyte batches tested. Comparisons between two groups (e.g. control and receptor-expressing groups) were tested for statistically significant differences (p < 0.05 or better) using two-tailed unpaired t test. Comparisons of amplitudes of IBa at different times in the same group were done using paired t test. Comparison between several groups was done using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's tests, using the SigmaStat software (SPSS Corp.). Reconstitution of Neurotransmitter Modulation of L-type Ca2+ Channel in Xenopus Oocytes—We have previously demonstrated that the long-NT isoform of rabbit cardiac L-VDCC, expressed in Xenopus oocytes, is modulated by PKC activators as in cardiac and some smooth muscle cells; PMA caused an initial increase in Ba2+ current via the channels (IBa) followed by a decrease (42Shistik E. Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17901-17909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In an attempt to similarly reconstitute the modulation of this channel by Gq-activating neurotransmitters (AngII, ACh), we expressed the relevant receptors (AT1R and m1R or m3R) in conjunction with the subunits of rabbit cardiac L-VDCC: α1C (the long-NT isoform; Ref. 39Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 340: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar), α2δ, and usually also β2A. Xenopus oocytes were injected with the designated RNAs, and Ba2+ currents were measured using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. The m1R was selected for practical reasons; it is known to be a Gq-coupled receptor, and it proved to be well expressed in oocytes. The m3R gave similar effects (data not shown). The expression of m1R and AT1R was confirmed by measuring Cl- currents that develop following activation of the receptor (Fig. 1A). The appearance of this characteristic response is due to the activation of the Gq signaling cascade, which eventually leads to release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and the consequent activation of Ca2+-dependent Cl- channels found in the oocytes (54Dascal N. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 22: 317-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). To avoid the development of Cl- currents while measuring IBa, oocytes were injected with 25 nl of 50 mm BAPTA or EGTA 1–2 h prior to current measurements (42Shistik E. Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17901-17909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We did not observe any differences in the effects of AngII or ACh with either chelator; therefore, the results with BAPTA and EGTA were pooled. IBa was measured by step depolarizations to +20 mV from a holding potential of -80 mV every 30 s (Fig. 1B). After allowing the current to stabilize, agonist was applied for 5 min and then washed out. Application of either ACh or AngII in oocytes that expressed the channel alone did not cause any changes in IBa (Fig. 1C, a). In contrast, in oocytes that expressed the channel and the receptor, both ACh and AngII caused an increase in the amplitude of IBa, which reached a maximum after about 5 min. The enhancement of IBa by AngII was dose-dependent with an apparent EC50 of slightly less than 1 nm, which is similar to the known affinity range in native tissues (Fig. 1D). Following the period of increase, IBa declined within the next several minutes, normally below the initial (control) level (Fig. 1C, b and c). A similar decline also occurred in the constant presence of the agonist, when the latter has not been washed out after 5 min (data not shown). The reduction of IBa did not subside even after long periods of wash, and repetitive applications of AngII did not produce additional responses (neither increase nor decrease). The irreversibility of the decay, as well as other parameters (see below), cast doubt on its physiological relevance. The magnitude of the enhancement of the current differed depending on the type of receptor used, possibly due to differences in the efficiency of expression. Fig. 1E summarizes the results of the experiments in which the channel was expressed in full subunit combination (α1Cα2/δβ2A). Currents measured at 5 min (the peak of the increase) and at 8 min (representing the period of decline), expressed as percentage of initial IBa (measured in the same cell before application of the agonist), are shown. The increase in IBa caused by both transmitters was highly reproducible and statistically significant (p < 0.01). The decline phase was always present, and the decrease in IBa within a mere 3 min following the peak was also highly reproducible. The Initial Part of the N Terminus is Crucial for Modulation by a Gq-coupled Receptor—In previous experiments using PKC activators (PMA), the initial segment of the N terminus was shown to be crucial for the enhancement of the current (42Shistik E. Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17901-17909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 43Shistik E. Keren-Raifman T. Idelson G.H. Blumenstein Y. Dascal N. Ivanina T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31145-31149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Consequently, if the effect of ACh and AngII is mediated by PKC, the initial segment of the N terminus should also be crucial for this modulation. Two different N terminus deletion mutants of α1C were used in which the first 20 or 46 aa are deleted from the N terminus (ΔN2–20 and DN2–46, respectively). Oocytes that expressed the wild-type (WT) or the mutant α1C, coexpressed with α2/δ and the m1R, were subjected to a similar protocol of step depolarizations to +20 mV. In neither mutant was the current enhanced as a result of receptor activation by ACh. On the contrary, only a decrease was observed following activation (Fig. 2, A and B). The extent of the decrease was rather similar in the two deletion mutants tested. Thus, the first 20 aa that are crucial for up-regulation of the channel by PKC are also indispensable for the enhancement caused by the Gq-activating receptor, m1R (summarized in Fig. 2C). In contrast, the reduction in the current seems to be a separate effect, independent of the presence of the first 46 aa. Transmitter-induced Modulation of Human Channel Isoforms—The up-regulation by PKC was shown to depend on the 46-aa sequence encoded in the long-NT isoform of α1C by exon 1a (44Blumenstein Y. Kanevsky N. Sahar G. Barzilai R. Ivanina T. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3419-3423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The alternative exon is 1b, which encodes 16 aa at the initial part of the N terminus in the short-NT isoform of α1C (Fig. 3A). Therefore, we expected the long-NT human isoform, and not the short-NT isoform, to be regulated in a manner similar to the rabbit long-NT isoform. This prediction was fulfilled; in oocytes expressing the short-NT isoform of human α1C along with α2δ, β2A, and m1R, there was a decrease of 18.3 ± 3% from the initial IBa at 5 min, whereas we observed a 30.8 ± 6% increase in oocytes expressing the human long-NT isoform. That is, a 49% difference in the peak current between the long and the short isoform (Fig. 3, B and C). These effects were absent in oocytes not expressing any receptor (data not shown). Activation of Gq Leads to Channel Modulation—Gq normally activates phospholipase C (PLC), and the latter leads to Ca2+ release and PKC activation. To examine whether PLC is involved in the modulation described above, we have expressed a mutated AT1 receptor in which the last five tyrosines of the C terminus were mutated to phenylalanines (AT1RM5). This mutated receptor was shown to lack Gq coupling (53Doan T.N. Ali M.S. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20954-20958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Oocytes expressed the rabbit long-NT channel (in the α1Cα2/δβ2A composition) and the wild-type receptor or the mutated one. No Ca2+-dependent Cl- current response to AngII was observed in oocytes expressing AT1RM5 in the absence of Ca2+ chelators (compare Fig. 4, A and B). This result confirms the lack of coupling of AT1RM5 to PLC and demonstrates that activation of this receptor does not elevate Ca2+ in the oocytes. The enhancement in the current via L-type Ca2+ channel (rabbit long-NT α1C) following AngII application was present only in oocytes expressing the wild-type receptor, and only a decrease was observed with AT1RM5 (Fig. 4C). Peak current, measured 5 min after AngII application, was enhanced by 18.2 ± 4% in oocytes expressing the wild-type receptor but was decreased by 9.5 ± 4.7% in oocytes expressing the mutated receptor. That is, a difference of 28% (p < 0.001; Fig. 4D) was seen. As an additional test for the involvement of PLC, we used the PLC inhibitor U73122. Oocytes were both injected and incubated with U73122 prior to current measurement (see “Experimental Procedures”). Treatment with U73122 of oocytes expressing the WT channel (rabbit long-NT α1C) and either m1R or AT1R resulted in a complete abolishment of the enhancement as compared with untreated oocytes (Fig. 5, A and B). The difference between currents with and without U73122 was 56.5% with m1R and and 34.2% with AT1R (measured after 5 min; 33.3 ± 3.1% and 19.1 ± 1.2% increase in untreated oocytes versus a 23.3 ± 2.7% and 15.1 ± 2.4% decrease"
https://openalex.org/W1970571883,"Specific interactions between adjacent ryanodine receptor (RyR) molecules to form ordered two-dimensional arrays in the membrane have been demonstrated using electron microscopy both in situ, in tissues and cells, and in vitro, with the purified protein. RyR interoligomeric association has also been inferred from observations of simultaneous channel gating during multi-RyR channel recordings in lipid bilayers. In this study, we report experiments designed to identify the region(s) of the RyR molecule, participating in this reciprocal interaction. Using epitope-specific antibodies, we identified a RyR tryptic fragment that specifically bound the intact immobilized RyR. Three overlapping RyR fragments encompassing this epitope, expressed using an in vitro mammalian expression system, were immunoprecipitated by RyR. To refine the binding regions, smaller RyR fragments were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, and their binding to RyR was monitored using a “sandwich” enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Three GST-RyR fusion proteins demonstrated specific binding, dependent upon ionic strength. Binding was greatest at 50–150 mm NaCl for two GST-RyR constructs, and a third GST-RyR construct demonstrated maximum binding between 150 and 450 mm NaCl. The binding at high NaCl concentration suggested involvement of a hydrophobic interaction. In silico analysis of secondary structure showed evidence of coil regions in two of these RyR fragment sequences, which might explain these data. In GST pull-down assays, these same three fragments captured RyR2, and two of them retained RyR1. These results identify a region at the center of the linear RyR (residues 2540–3207 of human RyR2) which is able to bind to the RyR oligomer. This region may constitute a specific subdomain participating in RyR-RyR interaction. Specific interactions between adjacent ryanodine receptor (RyR) molecules to form ordered two-dimensional arrays in the membrane have been demonstrated using electron microscopy both in situ, in tissues and cells, and in vitro, with the purified protein. RyR interoligomeric association has also been inferred from observations of simultaneous channel gating during multi-RyR channel recordings in lipid bilayers. In this study, we report experiments designed to identify the region(s) of the RyR molecule, participating in this reciprocal interaction. Using epitope-specific antibodies, we identified a RyR tryptic fragment that specifically bound the intact immobilized RyR. Three overlapping RyR fragments encompassing this epitope, expressed using an in vitro mammalian expression system, were immunoprecipitated by RyR. To refine the binding regions, smaller RyR fragments were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, and their binding to RyR was monitored using a “sandwich” enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Three GST-RyR fusion proteins demonstrated specific binding, dependent upon ionic strength. Binding was greatest at 50–150 mm NaCl for two GST-RyR constructs, and a third GST-RyR construct demonstrated maximum binding between 150 and 450 mm NaCl. The binding at high NaCl concentration suggested involvement of a hydrophobic interaction. In silico analysis of secondary structure showed evidence of coil regions in two of these RyR fragment sequences, which might explain these data. In GST pull-down assays, these same three fragments captured RyR2, and two of them retained RyR1. These results identify a region at the center of the linear RyR (residues 2540–3207 of human RyR2) which is able to bind to the RyR oligomer. This region may constitute a specific subdomain participating in RyR-RyR interaction.

Ca2+ store in muscle cells are ryanodine receptors (RyR), the ion channels that mediate release of SR Ca2+ into the cytosol (1Campbell K. Franzini-Armstrong C. Shamoo A. Biochim. Biophys.

There are three distinct mammalian isoforms of RyR identified and characterized, with RyR1 and RyR2 being the predominant forms found in skeletal and cardiac muscle, respectively (4Takeshima H.

To constitute a functional Ca2+ release channel, four RyR subunits, each of ∼560 kDa, coalesce to form a stable homotetramer that surrounds the single ion channel pore (10Lai F. Misra M. Xu L. Smith A. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16776-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The unique size of this homotetrameric RyR complex, about 30 nm across (11Radermacher M.

A remarkable similarity is observed in topological models of three-dimensional reconstructions of RyR1, RyR2, and RyR3, each showing a structure with tetragonal symmetry (15Serysheva I.I. Orlova E.V.

Analysis of the intracellular organization of RyR particles using freeze-fractured, negatively stained muscle SR junctions, revealed that RyRs are packed into discrete, two-dimensional arrays termed couplons (19Franzini-Armstrong C.

In recent studies using RyR1 purified from rabbit muscle SR, the assembly of RyRs into a regular, chessboard-like two-dimensional array was found to be an intrinsic property of RyR oligomers and not dependent upon insertion in the SR membrane or ancillary proteins (23Yin C.C. Lai F.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The projection maps derived from these reconstituted RyR arrays resembled those described previously for junctional SR arrays observed in situ (23Yin C.C. Lai F.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, RyR molecules associate together to form an ordered array, enabling individual oligomers to interact allosterically, creating an integrated microdomain structure within the SR membrane. The RyR-RyR interaction site is found within the cytoplasmic domain (23Yin C.C. Lai F.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), which is highly conserved in mammalian and non-mammalian species (4Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T. Ishida H. Kangawa K.

Boheler K.R. Rios E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). RyR array formation is a shared feature of the distinct isoforms because both RyR1 and RyR3, when transfected and expressed independently in a dyspedic myotube cell line, also formed similar two-dimensional arrays in situ (26Protasi F. Takekura H. Wang Y. Chen S.R. Meissner G. Allen P.D. Franzini-Armstrong C. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2494-2508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 27Fessenden J.D. Wang Y.

The concept of the couplon, comprising arrays of interacting RyRs (and ancillary proteins such as calmodulin, sorcin, and FK506-binding protein (FKBP12)) (20Rios E. Stern M.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 47-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 21Stern M.D. Pizarro G. Rios E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 415-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), provides a model to explore the underlying structure and function relationship. The lateral dimensions of individual couplons and their distribution within the myocytes vary with muscle type (22Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Ramesh V. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 1528-1539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) and may influence the kinetics of local and global Ca2+ signals. Ca2+ sparks originating from the SR were first observed in cardiac myocytes using fluo-3 confocal microscopy (28Cheng H. Lederer W. Cannell M. Science. 1993; 262: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether a spark emanates from a finite structural entity, i.e. it equates to activation of an entire couplon, or whether it involves a fraction of the RyRs. The extent of recruitment could depend upon both the mechanisms initiating the spark and the regulatory influences modulating RyR activity (29Rios E. Stern M. Gonzalwez A. Pizarro G. Shirokova N. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 31-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 30Gonzalez A. Kirsch W.G. Shirokova N. Pizarro G. Brum G. Pessah I.N. Stern M.D. Cheng H. Rios E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4380-4385Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), including allosteric interactions and the disposition of other proteins (31Rice J.J. Jafri M.S. Winslow R.L. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 1871-1884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In cardiac muscle, the “local control” model of Ca2+ signaling (“cluster bomb” hypothesis) postulates that a small number of RyR channels interact spatially with each L-type voltage-operated Ca2+ channel (dihydropyridine receptor), and then calcium-induced calcium release operates to trigger the opening of other RyRs (20Rios E. Stern M.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 47-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 32Stern M. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 497-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 33Klein M. Cheng H. Santana L. Jiang Y.-H. Lederer W. Schneider M. Nature. 1996; 379: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 34Cannel M. Soeller C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 16-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 35Williams A. Eur. Heart J. 1997; 18: A27-A35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Combined patch clamp and confocal measurement of Ca2+ in the subsarcolemmal space estimates that each SR Ca2+ release event (“spark”) requires the concerted opening of four to six RyR molecules, following Ca2+ influx via one dihydropyridine receptor in isolated cardiac myocytes (36Wang S.Q. Sang L.S. Lakatta E.G. Cheng H. Nature. 2001; 410: 592-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The mechanism of simultaneous activation of the RyR molecules within the cluster to produce a Ca2+ spark remains uncertain. Stochastic gating theory suggests that each RyR molecule activates and closes independently (20Rios E. Stern M.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 47-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 33Klein M. Cheng H. Santana L. Jiang Y.-H. Lederer W. Schneider M. Nature. 1996; 379: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). An alternative hypothesis proposes coupled gating, involving the functional interaction of adjacent RyR molecules, mediated by FKBP12 or 12.6, as demonstrated for RyR1 and RyR2 channels recorded in planar bilayer experiments, respectively (37Marx S. Ondrias K. Marks A. Science. 1998; 281: 818-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 38Marx S.O. Gaburjakova J. Gaburjakova M. Henrikson C. Ondrias K. Marks A.R. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 1151-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Similar results with coupled gating of inositol trisphosphate receptors (39Dargan S.L. Lea E.J.A. Dawson A.P. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) suggest that this may be a common mechanism for related Ca2+ release channels. Thus, RyR-RyR oligomeric interaction may underlie a central mechanism for regulation of EC coupling in muscle cells. The aim of this study was to identify potential sites of interaction between RyR oligomers. The strategy used was to trypsinize RyR and detect liberated peptides that specifically bound to immobilized tetramers of RyR, using site-specific antibodies for different regions of the RyR. A putative binding region was identified using this approach. The corresponding RyR protein fragments were expressed in vitro and as GST fusion proteins and then tested for binding to RyR by immunoprecipitation, ELISA, and GST pull-down assays. The results describe a potential RyR binding region near the center of the linear RyR sequence, within which were a number of potential binding domains. Materials—Restriction endonucleases were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and all biochemicals, unless indicated otherwise, were purchased from Sigma. Primary antibodies (Abs) to RyR were rabbit antisera raised against peptides derived from RyR sequences; Ab2142 was to RyR1 residues 830–845 (peptide sequence RREGPRGPHLVGPSRC), Ab34 to the RyR2 residues 2872–2893 (peptide sequence CTLTAKEKAKDREKAQDLKFL, conserved in RyR1), Ab2160 to the RyR2 C terminus residues 4951–4965 (peptide sequence FFPAGDCFRKQYEDQL, conserved in RyR1), and Ab1093 to the hRyR2 residues 4459–4478 (peptide sequence EDKGKQKLRQLHTHRYGEPEC). The GST polyclonal antibody was raised against purified, recombinant GST protein. Preparation of hRyR2 Expression Vector Constructs—The coordinates of the expression vector constructs, corresponding to the protein sequence of human RyR2 (hRyR2), are given in Figs. 2A and 3A (6Tunwell E. Wickenden C. Bertrand B. Shevchenko V. Walsh M. Allen P. Lai F. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers were designed to contain appropriate restriction sites in-frame with the vectors used and were synthesized by Sigma Genosys. RyR constructs 1, 2, and 3 were inserted into a pGBKT7 vector (Clontech) for in vitro expression. For RyR construct 1 the primers were 5′-AAGGATCCACGCTTCTCTCATTGAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGGACTCGAGTTCCAGGTCCTTAAA-3′ (reverse); for RyR construct 2, 5′-CCGGATCCATAATATATGGCCAAAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTGGCTCGAGTTTCTCCAAAG-3′ (reverse); and for RyR construct 3, 5′-AGGGATCCTTAACCCACAACCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCTGCTCGAGGTTTTCCATGGT-3′ (reverse). DNA constructs encoding GST fusion proteins were made using pGEX vectors (Amersham Biosciences). GST-RyR 4, 4A, 4B, and 5 were constructed in pGEX-5X-2, whereas GST-RyR 6 used pGEX-4T-3. For GST-RyR 4 the forward primer was that used for GST-RyR construct 1, and the reverse was 5′-CAGCGTCGACAGAAACCTGGCT-3′. For GST-RyR construct 4A the forward primer was that used for RyR construct 1, and the reverse primer was 5′-GAGGCTCGAGTGTTTTTCCATCATATCGACATA-3′. For GST-RyR construct 4B the forward primer was 5′-CGCGGGATCCAGTCATCAATGGATTCTGAA-3′, and the reverse primer was that used for GST-RyR construct 4. For GST-RyR 5 the primers were 5′-CCGGATCCTTGACATGAGCAATGTTA-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACATGTCGACTGAGTTGTTGGAGGAAAC-3′ (reverse). For GST-RyR construct 6 the forward primer was 5′-CTATGGATCCGTGATGAAGACTGGCCTGGAG-3′, and the reverse primer was that used for RyR construct 2. All constructs were generated by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega) and full-length hRyR2 DNA as the template (6Tunwell E. Wickenden C. Bertrand B. Shevchenko V. Walsh M. Allen P. Lai F. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and were confirmed by DNA sequencing (ABI PRISM Big Dye kit; Applied Biosystems).Fig. 3Sandwich ELISAs of GST-RyR constructs.

A 10-μl aliquot of TNT Quick Master Mix was incubated with 1 μg of DNA vector template and 1 μl of Promix for 90 min at 30 °C to synthesize proteins in vitro.5 μl of the reaction mix was then added to native RyR1 protein and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C before immunoprecipitation. The final immunoprecipitation reaction mix contained 250 μg of enriched RyR1 protein, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm PIPES buffer, pH 7.1, 0.5% CHAPS, and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 20 μl of Protein G PLUS-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and 10 μl of Ab2142. The Protein G PLUS beads were then washed five times with the immunoprecipitation buffer and twice more with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 137 mm NaCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, and 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4) and then boiled in SDS sample buffer (0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.3 m dithiothreitol (DTT), 15 mm EDTA, 6% SDS, 30% glycerol, and bromphenol blue) for 1 min. Samples were loaded and separated electrophoretically on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gel was fixed for 30 min (40% methanol, 10% acetic acid in H2O) and then incubated with Amplify enhancer solution (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film at –80 °C. Ab2142 was omitted from the controls to estimate nonspecific binding to the Protein G PLUS-agarose beads and plasticware. Preparation of GST-RyR Fragments—The protocol was based on the manufacturer's instructions for pGEX vectors (Amersham Biosciences). GST-RyR fusion protein expression in bacterial cultures (1l, 25 °C, Escherichia coli BL21 Rosetta; Novagen) was induced by 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside when the absorbance (A600) reached 0.5. Cells were harvested after 3 h and the pellets frozen at –80 °C until required for purification. The batch purification protocol with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and elution with reduced glutathione was used (Amersham Bioscience). Reduced glutathione was removed by overnight dialysis of the eluted recombinant protein against PBS, pH 7.4. Purified GST fusion proteins were stored at –80 °C until use. GST-RyR Fusion Protein Pull-down Assays, Silver Stain, and Immunoblot Analysis—Pull-down assays using GST-RyR fusion proteins were performed with native RyR1- or RyR2-enriched preparations. 20 μg of GST fusion protein was mixed gently overnight at 4 °C with 40 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B and 200 μg of RyR1 or RyR2 in binding buffer (20 mm PIPES, pH 7.1, 0.5% CHAPS, 1% BSA, 200 mm NaCl) in a total volume of 800 μl. The beads were washed four times with PBS, eluted with SDS sample buffer, and boiled for 1 min. The sample was separated by 5.5% SDS-PAGE and either silver stained (Bio-Rad silver stain kit) or transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for 4 h at 20 V using a semidry blotter (Bio-Rad) and the recommended transfer solution (39 mm glycine, 48 mm Tris, 0.0375% SDS, 20% methanol). The membrane was blocked overnight at 4 °C with blocking buffer (0.2% Tween 20, 5% milk proteins). The remaining blotting procedure was carried out at 22 °C, using primary antibodies Ab2142 (1:1,000) and Ab1093 (1:500) to detect RyR1 and RyR2 (1 h), respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Ab (1:10,000) was used; the blots were developed with Supersignal West Dura reagent (Perbio) and the images recorded on a ChemiDoc acquisition system (Bio-Rad). GST-RyR Fusion Protein Overlay Assays—To dissociate the RyR1 tetramers to monomers, enabling analysis on native polyacrylamide gels, the enriched RyR1 preparations were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with zwittergent (0.9%) (10Lai F. Misra M. Xu L. Smith A. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16776-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Zwittergent-treated RyR1 preparations were run on native 5.5% SDS gels, as described above, except that SDS was omitted from the gel and sample and running buffers, and DTT from the sample buffer. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as above for 4 h (>200 kDa) or for 30 min (<200 kDa). A Bio-Rad antibody screening apparatus was used to create distinct wells covering the length of the membrane, which was incubated with 500 μl of 40 μg/ml GST-RyR fusion proteins in binding buffer (as in the above GST pull-down assays, except 5% milk protein replaced 1% BSA) with rocking at 4 °C overnight. The membrane was washed three times with binding buffer and developed with either anti-RyR Ab2142 or anti-GST as described above. Binding of RyR Tryptic Fragments to Immobilized RyR—Solubilized RyR from skeletal muscle microsomes was purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation (23Yin C.C. Lai F.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To lower the NaCl concentration to 200 mm, the RyR peak fraction was diluted with 20 mm PIPES buffer, pH 7.1, 0.5% CHAPS, 100 μm EGTA, 150 mm CaCl2, 2 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors (0.2 mm AEBSF, 0.5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm iodoacetamide) and concentrated to ∼1.5 mg/ml protein using centrifugal concentrators (Amicon). Protease inhibitors were omitted from gradients when used for trypsinization experiments, and DTT was omitted from preparations used to couple RyR1 to agarose. Trypsin digestion was performed in 20 mm PIPES buffer, pH 7.1, 0.5% CHAPS, 100 μm EGTA, 150 mm CaCl2, 2 mm DTT, 200 mm NaCl, with 800 μg of RyR protein and 2 μg of trypsin (protein:trypsin ratio 400:1 w/w (40Meissner G. Rousseaux E. Lai F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1715-1722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). At specific intervals up to 30 min, trypsin digests were stopped by the addition of 100 μg of trypsin inhibitor and AEBSF to 0.2 mm. RyR1 was coupled to an agarose support using Sulfolink coupling gel according to the manufacturer's protocol (Perbio). The coupling buffer used to equilibrate a 2-ml bed volume column was 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1 m NaCl, 0.5% CHAPS, and 5% sucrose. 1 ml of this buffer was combined with 1 ml of RyR1 preparation (1.5 mg of protein/ml) and then mixed with coupling gel for 15 min and allowed to settle for 30 min at room temperature. The coupling gel was washed with 5 bed volumes of coupling buffer. To quench unbound coupling groups, 2 ml of 50 mm cysteine was added and mixed as before. A control column lacking RyR protein was quenched in a similar way. The coupling gel columns were washed four times with 2 bed volumes of 1 m NaCl in PBS to remove unbound protein and equilibrated with 5 bed volumes of 20 mm PIPES buffer, pH 7.1, 0.5% CHAPS, 100 μm EGTA, 150 mm CaCl2, 2 mm DTT, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.2 mm AEBSF. A 30-min tryptic digest of 1.2 ml of RyR1 was loaded into the RyR and control columns, which were capped and incubated at room temperature for 1 h and then washed with 5 bed volumes of equilibration buffer. Bound protein was eluted with 1 ml of the same buffer but containing 1 m NaCl. Eluates were concentrated using centrifugal concentrators, desalted using Microbiospin chromatography columns (Bio-Rad) to reduce the NaCl concentration, and the eluates were boiled with sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with Abs 2142, 34, and 2160. Preparation of Enriched RyR1—Native RyR1 was prepared from solubilized skeletal muscle microsomes (23Yin C.C. Lai F.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) using fast protein liquid chromatography anion exchange chromatography with a 20-ml Resource Q column (Bio-Rad) in place of sucrose gradient centrifugation. RyR1 was eluted with a 125–1,000 mm NaCl gradient in 20 mm PIPES buffer, pH 7.1, 0.5% CHAPS, 100 μm EGTA, 150 mm CaCl2, 2 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors 0.2 mm AEBSF, 0.5 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm iodoacetamide. The RyR protein peak eluting at ∼350 mm NaCl provided the RyR1 preparation used for all experiments other than those with trypsin digests. The protein concentration in this fraction was typically 1 mg/ml. In all of the experimental protocols described, the final NaCl concentration was calculated to allow for the 350 mm NaCl contribution of the buffer containing the enriched RyR preparation. Preparation of Enriched RyR2—Native RyR2 protein was prepared from pig heart microsomes, solubilized, and enriched using sucrose density gradient centrifugation with the same protocol as that for the RyR1 preparation used for the trypsin digest experiments (described above). RyR Interaction ELISAs—Either 10 μg of RyR1-enriched preparation or BSA was added to the wells of a 96-well ELISA plate (ICN) for 2hat22 °C in PBS and bicarbonate buffer (41Harlow E. Lane D.

The viral genome is small (2.9 kb) and only encodes its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Recently, we have succeeded in generating 23 S RNA virus from an expression vector containing the entire viral cDNA sequence. Using this in vivo launching system, we analyzed the 3′-cis-acting signals for replication. The 3′-non-coding region of 23 S RNA contains two cis-elements. One is a stretch of 4 Cs at the 3′ end, and the other is a mismatched pair in a stem-loop structure that partially overlaps the terminal 4 Cs. In the latter element, the loop or stem sequence is not important but the stem structure with the mismatch pair is essential. The mismatched bases should be purines. Any combination of purines at the mismatch pair bestowed capability of replication on the RNA, whereas converting it to a single bulge at either side of the stem abolished the activity. The terminal and penultimate Cs at the 3′ end could be eliminated or modified to other nucleotides in the launching plasmid without affecting virus generation. However, the viruses generated regained or restored these Cs at the 3′ terminus. Considering the importance of the viral 3′ ends in RNA replication, these results suggest that this 3′ end repair may contribute to the persistence of 23 S RNA virus in yeast by maintaining the genomic RNA termini intact. We discuss possible mechanisms for this 3′ end repair in vivo. 23 S RNA narnavirus is a persistent positive strand RNA virus found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Positive strand RNA viruses replicate their linear RNA genomes using RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) 1The abbreviations used are: RdRp, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; nt, nucleotides; Cs, cytidines. 1The abbreviations used are: RdRp, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; nt, nucleotides; Cs, cytidines. in conjunction with host or other viral proteins. The viral genomes contain cis-acting elements at the 3′ ends, which direct the polymerase machinery (holoenzyme) to synthesize the viral negative strands in a milieu dominated by host RNAs. In contrast to DNA replication in eukaryotic cells, the polymerase machinery can start RNA synthesis without shortening the viral genome at the 3′ ends. However, during the replication cycle, their RNA termini may be vulnerable to host exonucleases that are usually involved in cellular RNA metabolism (1Jacobson A. Peltz S.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 693-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 2Tucker M. Parker R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 571-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The viruses may have developed strategies to cope with this problem, e.g. by sequestering the viral RNA into membranous structures during replication (3Schwartz M. Chen J. Janda M. Sullivan M. den Boon J. Ahlquist P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) or by covalently attaching 5′-cap structures and 3′-poly(A) tails or peptide fragments to the RNA ends. Possessing efficient 3′ end repair mechanisms may also be beneficial. Various repair mechanisms have been proposed but are poorly understood (4Neufeld K.L. Galarza J.M. Richards O.C. Summers D.F. Ehrenfeld E. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5811-5818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Rao A.L. Dreher T.W. Marsh L.E. Hall T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Dreher T.W. Marsh L.E. Hall T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5335-5339Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Particularly, persistent viruses such as the yeast 23 S RNA narnavirus may require efficient repair mechanism(s) to keep their genomic termini intact throughout their long term infection. Most laboratory strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae harbor 20 S RNA virus (ScNV-20S), and fewer strains carry 23 S RNA virus (ScNV-23S). These viruses were originally discovered as RNA species induced under nitrogen starvation conditions (9Kadowaki K. Halvorson H.O. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 105: 826-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wejksnora P.J. Haber J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 246-260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Matsumoto Y. Wickner R.B. J. Biol.

Seventh Report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Academic Press, New York2000: 651-656Google Scholar). They share many features in common. Their RNA genomes are small (2891 and 2514 nt in 23 S RNA and 20 S RNA, respectively) and have the same 5 nt-inverted repeats at their termini (5′-GGGGC... GCCCC-OH) (14Rodríguez-Cousiño N. Solórzano A. Fujimura T. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20363-20371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The double-stranded forms of 20 S and 23 S RNAs are called W and T, respectively (14Rodríguez-Cousiño N. Solórzano A. Fujimura T. Esteban R. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10874-10881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Rodríguez-Cousiño N. Solórzano A. Fujimura T. Esteban R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 12772-12778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both proteins contain four amino acid motifs well conserved among RdRps. Because the viral genomes do not encode coat proteins, they are not encapsidated into viral particles (17Widner W.R. Matsumoto Y. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2905-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 18Esteban L.M. Fujimura T. García-Cuéllar M.P. Esteban R. J. Biol.

Instead, the RNA genomes form ribonucleoprotein complexes with their cognate RdRps in a 1:1 stoichiometry and reside in the host cytoplasm (18Esteban L.M. Fujimura T. García-Cuéllar M.P. Esteban R.

They are transmitted vertically to daughter cells during mitosis or horizontally during mating. There is no known extracellular transmission pathway. Typical of fungal viruses, they do not kill nor render phenotypic changes to the host, which makes their genetic manipulation difficult. Recently, we established an efficient launching system for 23 S RNA virus in yeast from an expression vector containing the entire 23 S RNA virus cDNA (21Esteban R. Fujimura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2568-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this study, we used this launching system to analyze the 3′-cis-acting signal for replication and found two cis-elements at the 3′ end of positive strands. We also found an efficient repair system of the 3′-terminal nucleotides in vivo. Because the viral genome is not encapsidated into viral particles but exists as a ribonucleoprotein complex with p104 in the yeast cytoplasm, the repair mechanism(s) may contribute to the 23 S RNA virus persistence by keeping the genomic termini intact for long term infection. Strains and Media—A L-A-o derivative (2928 L-A-o) of strain 2928 (a ura3 trp1 his3, 20 S RNA, 23 S RNA-o) (22Wickner R.B. Icho T. Fujimura T. Widner W.R. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 155-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used throughout this work with the exception of one launching experiment (indicated in Table 1) in which 20 S RNA-cured 2928 L-A-o was used. We have observed the curing of endogenous 20 S RNA virus at a low frequency from yeast cells when low uracil-containing media were used during launching. 2R. Esteban and T. Fujimura, manuscript in preparation. Cells were grown in either rich YPAD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 0.04% adenine, and 2% glucose) or tryptophan-omitted synthetic (H-Trp) medium (23Wickner R.B.

Open table in a new tab Launching Plasmid—The standard launching plasmid pRE637 was described previously (21Esteban R. Fujimura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2568-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced into 23 S RNA cDNA sequence by oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis (24Esteban R. Fujimura T. Wickner R.B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 947-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and were verified by DNA sequencing. Launching Assay—Yeast cells were transformed with launching plasmids according to the lithium acetate method (25Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used two independently isolated plasmids for each experiment. Three to six transformants were isolated from each plasmid and grown in H-Trp liquid medium for 2 days. Cells then were transferred to 1% potassium acetate and incubated for 16 h at 28 °C to induce 23 S RNA. The induced cells were broken with glass beads as described previously (21Esteban R. Fujimura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2568-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and total RNA isolated was separated on a 1.3% agarose gel. 23 S RNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining of the gel and also by Northern blots (26Fujimura T. Esteban R. Esteban L.M. Wickner R.B. Cell. 1990; 62: 819-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The generation of 23 S RNA virus was confirmed by curing the launching plasmids from 23 S RNA-positive cells by growing them on rich YPAD medium. All of the mutations analyzed in this work showed all-or-none phenotype in virus launching. For the sake of simplicity, only a representative of each experiment is shown in the figures. Sucrose Gradients—Sucrose gradient centrifugation was done as described previously (18Esteban L.M. Fujimura T. García-Cuéllar M.P. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29771-29777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primer Extension—Purification of T double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and primer extension analysis of the negative strands of T dsRNA was performed as described previously (14Rodríguez-Cousiño N. Solórzano A. Fujimura T. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20363-20371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). 3′-RACE—Total RNA isolated from launching plasmid-cured cells was poly(A)-tailed using poly(A) polymerase (Invitrogen). The poly(A)-tailed RNA was denatured with hydroxymethyl mercuric hydroxide as described previously (27Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar), and cDNA was synthesized using oligonucleotide RE156 (5′-GACTCGAGTCGAGGATCCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′) and Superscript II RNase H- reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). After cDNA synthesis, RNA was digested with RNase A and the unincorporated primer was eliminated by a G-50 minispin column (Worthington Biochemical Corp.). cDNA containing the 3′ ends of 23 S RNA-positive strands was PCR-amplified for 30 cycles using Taq polymerase (Promega) and primers RE157 (5′-GACTCGAGTCGAGGATCC-3′) and NR23 (5′-TTCATGGGCCTTCGCCCC-3′). For amplification of the negative strand 3′ ends, we used oligonucleotides RE157 and NR22 (5′-GAGTCCACGTCGTAACGC-3′). The amplified products from positive strand 3′ ends were digested with SpeI and BamHI and ligated into the Bluescript-KS+ vector (Stratagene). In the case of negative strand 3′ ends, PCR products were digested with SalI and BamHI and ligated into the Bluescript-KS+ vector. Launching Plasmid—The standard launching plasmid pRE637 contains the entire 23 S RNA cDNA sequence (2891 bp) downstream of the PGK1 promoter (Fig. 1A). The plasmid has the TRP1 gene as a selectable marker. Transcripts from the promoter have the positive strand polarity of the viral genome. The hepatitis delta virus antigenomic ribozyme is directly fused to the 3′ terminus of the viral genome. We have shown that an active ribozyme as well as an active p104 are essential for 23 S RNA virus launching. Although the primary transcripts have extra nucleotides at their 5′ ends derived from the vector, the viruses generated possessed the authentic viral 5′ ends without these extra nucleotides (21Esteban R. Fujimura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2568-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Using this launching system, we analyzed the 3′-cis-acting signals of 23 S RNA virus replication. 3′-Non-coding Region—The 3′-untranslated region of the viral genome contains 59 nt. There are three computer-predicted stem-loop structures in this region (Fig. 1B). When the nucleotide sequences of each loop (I-III) were modified separately in the vector, none of them affected launching of 23 S RNA virus, even though the modification of loop III also changed the C-terminal two amino acids in p104 (Fig. 1C). The stem-loop structure proximal to the 3′ end contains a mismatched pair (A< >G) in the stem. Eliminating one of the mismatched nucleotides (G) impaired the generation of 23 S RNA virus (Fig. 1C). The importance of the mismatched bases and the stem structure encompassing them in viral replication was investigated in detail (see below). When the nucleotide sequence of one side of the lower stem was replaced with that of the other or vice versa, thus destroying the lower stem structure, none of vectors generated the virus (Fig. 2A). The two base pairs at the bottom of the stem were left unmodified because they are part of the 3′-terminal 5 nucleotides that are complementary to those at the 5′ end of the viral genome (5′-GGGGC.....GCCCC-OH). When sequences of both sides in the lower stem were exchanged simultaneously, thus restoring the stem structure, the ability to generate the virus was recovered (Fig. 2A). The viruses generated from this lower stem-exchanged plasmid and from the original standard launching plasmid were indistinguishable from endogenous 23 S RNA virus in sucrose gradients (Fig. 3). p104 and the 23 S RNA genomes co-migrated in the gradients as observed previously (18Esteban L.M. Fujimura T. García-Cuéllar M.P. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29771-29777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With regard to the upper stem structure, we obtained the same results (Fig. 2B). When the upper stem was destroyed by replacing the 3-nt sequence of either side of the stem with that of the other side, the activity was lost. However, when both sequences were exchanged simultaneously, virus-generating activity was recovered. Therefore, these results indicate that the stem structure (perhaps functioning as a platform to present the mismatched pair), but not the stem sequences per se, is important for virus replication. A Mismatched Pair of Purines Is Essential—When the 3′-G of the mismatched pair was eliminated or replaced with U (Fig. 4A), the modified vectors did not generate the virus, suggesting that the bulged non-base-paired nucleotide at the 3′ side is necessary. Additionally A, but not C, could substitute this G without losing the activity, suggesting that the bulged nucleotide should be a purine. Similarly, when the 5′-A of the mismatched pair was eliminated or replaced with C or U, none of the modified vectors generated the virus (Fig. 4B), indicating that the bulged non-base-paired nucleotide at the 5′ side of the stem is also necessary. The ability of G to replace this A without affecting virus launching again highlights the importance of purines at this position. To confirm that purines at the mismatched pair are essential for replication, we generated three concerted mutations at these positions (Fig. 4C). When the pair (A< >G) was changed to (G< >A), the launching activity was unaffected. Therefore, any combination of purines at the mismatched pair is capable of replication. On the other hand, the mismatched pair (C< >A) inhibited virus launching, whereas the (A< >A) mismatch maintained virus-launching activity. These results suggest that the 3′ and 5′ bases of the mismatched pair should be purines. Finally, this was confirmed by the inability of the third concerted mutation (U< >U) to generate the virus. Because changes of the mismatched pair (A< >G) to (A-U) and (U-G) resulted in failure to produce the virus, these results together indicate that the mismatched pair is essential for virus replication and that both bases at the pair should be purines. 3′-Terminal 4 Cs—The 5′- and 3′-terminal 5 nucleotides of the 23 S RNA viral genome are complimentary. Previously, we have shown that changing the 3′ end sequence... CCCC-OH to... AAAC-OH resulted in the failure to generate the virus (21Esteban R. Fujimura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2568-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, this region contains a cis-element for replication. In this study, we modified the 3′-terminal five nucleotides individually (Fig. 5A) and found that the terminal or penultimate C could be changed to A without affecting virus launching. However, the activity was lost when the third or fourth C (from the 3′ end) was changed to A or U. Because the fourth C is part of the stem that contains the essential mismatched pair, we chose U to replace it to minimize the effects on the stem structure. The modification of the fifth G to C or the addition of an extra A to the 3′ end did not affect virus generation (Fig. 5A). Consistently, up to two Cs but not three could be eliminated from the 3′ terminus without affecting virus launching (Fig. 5B). Therefore, the third and the fourth Cs from the 3′ end were essential for virus replication, whereas the last two Cs as well as the fifth G appeared to be dispensable. Accordingly, the 3′-terminal C could be changed to any other nucleotide without affecting virus launching (Fig. 6). It should be noted that changing the C to A or G breaks its complementarity with the 5′-terminal G. When this 5′-terminal G was changed to A or C, the generation of 23 S RNA virus was not affected. Furthermore, when their 3′-terminal C was changed to U or G, thus restoring complementarity between the 5′- and 3′-terminal nucleotides, again these double mutations did not affect virus launching. These results suggest that the terminal nucleotides at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the viral genomes are dispensable for virus replication. Alternatively, the virus may have somehow corrected these modifications, enabling only RNAs with proper viral sequences to be replicated. To examine these possibilities, we took two different approaches. First, we examined the viral 3′ end by primer extension (Fig. 7). 23 S RNA virus was launched from various plasmids. After curing the launching plasmids, T dsRNA was purified from virus-launched cells and the 5′ ends of the T-negative strands were reverse-transcribed using a 32P-labeled primer. The reverse transcripts from viral RNAs generated from cDNAs whose 3′-terminal C had been changed to U or G had the same length as those from the authentic endogenous viral RNA. These results do not distinguish the two possibilities mentioned above, however, they indicate that the 3′-terminal nucleotide either modified or corrected has been maintained. When we analyzed the 3′ end of viral RNA generated from a cDNA that lacked the 3′-terminal C, we found that the transcripts had the same length as those from the authentic endogenous virus, thus indicating that the launched virus had acquired one nucleotide at the 3′ end absent in the cDNA sequence.Fig. 6Modifications at the 5′- and 3′-terminal bases have no effects on 23 S RNA virus generation. B, 5′- and 3′-terminal bases were modified as indicated by filled circles (lanes 1-7). Lane C, unmodified wild type control. The initiation codon of p104 is underlined.

A, 23 S RNA virus was generated from a plasmid containing 23 S RNA cDNA whose 3′-terminal C was deleted (lane 1) or changed to G (lane 2) or T (lane 3). After curing the plasmids, T dsRNA was isolated from these cells. As controls, T dsRNA from cells containing 23 S RNA virus generated from wild type cDNA (lane 4) or endogenous 23 S RNA (lane Endogenous) was also isolated. After denaturation, T-negative strands were reverse-transcribed using a 32P-labeled primer and the products were analyzed on a 8% acrylamide sequencing gel. An autoradiogram of the gel is shown. A sequence ladder was generated from a plasmid containing wild type cDNA. In lane C + Endogenous, an aliquot of sequence ladder C and the primer-extended products shown in lane Endogenous were mixed and analyzed. Premature termination of reverse transcription was seen at the position corresponding to the 3′ side of the mismatched pair. B, the 3′ terminus of endogenous 23 S RNA virus and the corresponding region in the primary transcripts from plasmids are shown. The modification and elimination of the terminal C are indicated by filled circles and Δ, respectively. Ribozyme cleavage sites are indicated by vertical arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) 3′-RACE—Because primer extension does not provide information on the base composition of the sequences at the 3′ end, we used a second approach (3′-RACE) to address this point. As control, the 3′-terminal regions of endogenous virus and also of virus generated from the standard launching plasmid (pRE637) were cloned and sequenced. >80% of the clones in the controls possessed the correct full-length 5′ and 3′ termini in the positive strands (Table I). When the 3′-terminal C was changed to G in the vector (pRE681), the majority of clones (6 of 7) from the launched virus had the authentic positive strand 3′ termini (... GCCCC-OH) and none of them maintained the terminal G present in the cDNA. The primer extension experiment shown in Fig. 7 gave the same result on the length of the viral 3′ termini generated from the plasmid but failed to provide information on the correction of the terminal nucleotide. At the 5′ ends, 7 of 8 clones possessed the full-length wild type sequence. Therefore, these results indicate that the launched virus recovered the terminal C at the 3′ end of the viral genome, thus suggesting its indispensability in virus replication. To confirm this and also to examine any possible role played by the complementary base at the 5′ end on the 3′-terminal repair, we analyzed viral RNAs generated from two cDNAs having concerted mutations at both termini. The 5′- and 3′-terminal bases G and C were changed to A and U, respectively, in one case (pRE718) and to C and G in the other (pRE719). In both cases, the generated viruses recovered the terminal C at the 3′ end (8 of 8 clones in the former case and 6 of 8 in the latter) and also the terminal G at the 5′ end (6 of 7 in the former case and 9 of 9 in the latter). None of the clones retained the mutations originally introduced to the cDNA. Therefore, the 3′- and 5′-terminal nucleotides were corrected to the wild type irrespective of the mutations introduced at those positions. This indicates that the complementarity of the terminal bases in the inverted repeats is not involved in the repairing processes. Although the elimination of the terminal C (pRE698) or terminal and penultimate Cs (pRE739) from the vector did not affect virus launching, the virus generated regained these Cs at their 3′ termini. In the latter case (pRE739), we analyzed two independently launched viruses. Therefore, these results clearly indicate that not only the third and fourth Cs but also the terminal and penultimate Cs at the 3′ end are essential for replication. In the former experiment (pRE698), we used a yeast strain that had no endogenous 20 S RNA virus. This indicates that the acquisition of the 3′-terminal C does not require the presence of 20 S RNA virus. In contrast to these terminal Cs, we obtained quite different results when the fifth base (G) from the 3′ terminus was changed to C. To avoid any complication derived from the shortening of the lower stem structure adjacent to the 3′ end, we used a plasmid (pRE748) that also harbors the compensatory mutation at the 5′ side of the lower stem (C34G numbered from the 3′ end). These compensatory double mutations did not affect virus launching and generated 23 S RNA virus as efficiently as the single mutation (G5C numbered from the 3′ end) (Fig. 5A and data not shown). When two independently launched viruses were examined, all of the clones derived from them retained this C (Table 1) as well as the compensatory"
https://openalex.org/W2020317744,"The mammalian adenylyl cyclase is a membrane-bound enzyme that is predicted to have 12 trans-membrane spans. Between membrane spans 6 and 7 there is a large cytoplasmic loop, which, along with the C-terminal tail, makes up the catalytic site of the enzyme. Crystal structures of these soluble cytoplasmic domains have identified the regions that are involved in interactions with each other. The functional consequences of these interactions in the full-length membrane-embedded enzymes have not been established. In this study, we analyzed the role of various interaction regions within the central cytoplasmic loop (C1) and the C-terminal tail (C2) on basal, Gαs-, forskolin-, and Mn2+-stimulated activities of adenylyl cyclases 2 and 6 (AC2 and AC6). We tested synthetic peptides encoding the different interface surfaces of both the C1 and C2 domain on different activities of membrane-bound AC2 and AC6 expressed in insect cells. We found the C1-α2-β2-β3 and C2-β2′-β3′ regions to be involved in stimulation by Gαs and forskolin but not in the basal or Mn2+-stimulated activities. Both the C1-β4-β5-α4 region and the C2-α3′-β4′ region play a role in the Gαs- and forskolin-stimulated activities as well as in basal activity, because the peptides encoding these regions inhibit basal activity by 30%. In contrast, the C2-α2′ region peptide inhibits both basal and Mn2+-stimulated activity by >50%. These results suggest that the different stimulated activities may involve distinct interface interactions in the intact enzyme and, consequently, the distinct mechanisms by which Mn2+ activates the enzyme as compared with Gαs and forskolin, leading to the possibility that the full-length adenylyl cyclase may have multiple catalytically competent configurations.

These results suggest that the different stimulated activities may involve distinct interface interactions in the intact enzyme and, consequently, the distinct mechanisms by which Mn2+ activates the enzyme as compared with Gαs and forskolin, leading to the possibility that the full-length adenylyl cyclase may have multiple catalytically competent configurations. Mammalian adenylyl cyclases are prototypic, membrane-bound, G protein effectors that produce cAMP in response to Gαs stimulation (1Hanoune J. Defer N. Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 145-174Google Scholar, 2Smit M.J. Iyengar R. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1998; 32: 1-21Google Scholar). They remain very interesting enzymes in terms of structure-function relationships. The crystal structure of the catalytic domains of mammalian adenylyl cyclases with Gαs-GTPγS and forskolin (3Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Google Scholar) has provided an initial insight into the mechanisms by which Gαs binds to and activates adenylyl cyclase. However, our understanding of the functional implications of the interactions identified in the crystal structure within the native enzyme is largely incomplete. The crystal structure of the truncated central cytoplasmic loop of AC5 1The abbreviations used are: AC, adenylyl cyclase; C1, central cytoplasmic loop; C2, C-terminal tail. (VC1) and the C-terminal tail of AC2 (IIC2) has identified the interface regions. Using the criterion that interatomic distances within 4 Å indicate interacting residues, there are 28 residues in VC1 and 33 residues in IIC2 that are involved in interactions between the two domains (3Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Google Scholar). Because soluble VC1 has both N-terminal and C-terminal truncations, full-length adenylyl cyclase may have a greater number of residues involved in C1-C2 interactions. The interfaces are widely distributed on the C1 and C2 domains. They are primarily located in the β1 to α2, β2, and β4 to β5 regions of the C1 domain and the corresponding regions β′1 to α′2, β′2, and β′4 to β′5 of the C2 domain. In the crystal structure, the total area of interface is ∼3300 Å2. The interacting residues on the C1-C2 interface are largely conserved, and they share high similarities between all known membrane-bound adenylyl cyclases except AC9. Tang et al. (4Tang W.J. Stancel M. Gilman A.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14563-14572Google Scholar), using mutagenesis analysis, identified regions that affect adenylyl cyclase activity. Yan et al. (5Yan S.-Z. Huang Z.-H. Rao V.-D. Hurley J.-H. Tang W.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18849-18854Google Scholar) also identified some residues on the interface regions of C2 while searching for the Gαs binding site by using a site-directed mutagenesis approach. Hatley et al. (6Hatley M.E. Benton B.K. Xu J. Manfredi J.P. Gilman A.G. Sunahara R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38626-38632Google Scholar) found that there are several residues on the C2 interface (I1010M, K1014N, and P1015Q) that, when mutated, result in constitutive activation of adenylyl cyclase and also increase affinity between the two domains. These data indicate the importance of the interactions between the C1-C2 interface in regulating adenylyl cyclase activity. We have been interested in understanding the role that specific interface regions may play in both basal activity and the activity stimulated by Gαs and forskolin as well as Mn2+. To address this question, we designed peptides encoding the various interface regions and tested the effects of these peptides on full-length AC2 and AC6 expressed in Hi5 cells. These studies reveal a potentially unique role for the 899–926 region in the C2 domain in basal and Mn2+-stimulated activities. Materials—Amino acids and reagents for peptides were from Nova-biochem and Peptides International. [α-32P]ATP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Tissue culture reagents and fetal calf serum were from Invitrogen. Protease inhibitors were from Sigma. All other reagents were of the highest analytical grade that was commercially available. Peptide Synthesis—Peptides were synthesized on a Symphony (Protein Technologies) peptide synthesizer and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography on 1–75% acetonitrile gradients. Purified peptides were lyophilized and stored at -20 °C, and each peptide container was filled with nitrogen for long term storage. Peptides containing Cys or Trp were stored under nitrogen at -80 °C, when required peptides were dissolved in water to a final concentration of 1–3 mm. For each assay, peptide stock solutions were freshly prepared. Identity and purity of the peptides were verified by mass spectrometry. Expression of G Protein Subunits and Adenylyl Cyclases—Hexahistidine Q213L-Gαs (kind gift of Dr. T. Patel, Loyola University School of Medicine, Chicago, IL) was expressed in JM109 (DE3) cells. The protein in cell lysates was purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid columns according to a protocol kindly provided by the Patel laboratory. This protocol is essentially similar to the method described by Graziano et al. (7Graziano M.P. Freissmuth M. Gliman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 192-215Google Scholar). AC2 and AC6 were expressed in Hi5 cells by infection with recombinant baculovirus. Membranes were prepared from infected cells and used for the assays (8Pieroni J.P. Harry A. Chen J. Jacobowitz O. Magnusson R.P. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21368-21373Google Scholar). Adenylyl Cyclase Assays—Enzymatic activity was measured by conversion of [α-32P]ATP to [32P]cAMP. AC2 and AC6 assays have been described (9Harry A. Chen Y. Magnusson R.P. Iyengar R. Weng G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19017-19021Google Scholar, 10Chen Y. Yoo B. Lee J.B. Weng G. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45751-45754Google Scholar). When required, the peptides were mixed with adenylyl cyclase-containing membranes and held on ice for 10 min prior to assays. Approximately 1–2 μg of AC2 Hi5 cell membranes and 3–5 μg of AC6 membrane per assay tube were used. The concentration of activated Gαs was 2 μm, and that of forskolin was 30 μm. All assays contained a mixture of proteinase inhibitors. Final concentration of proteinase inhibitors was 3.2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenanthroline, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The protease inhibitor mixture was always freshly prepared. All experiments were repeated three or more times with qualitatively similar results. Typical experiments are shown. Values are means of triplicate determinations. Co-efficient of variance was always <7%. The interface surfaces used for the design of the peptides are shown in Fig. 1, A and B. In Fig. 1A the regions used for the peptides are shown in color in a ribbon diagram format from the crystal structure solved by Sprang and co-workers (3Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Google Scholar). The interface regions can be thought to form two symmetrical lock and key interactions, which are shown in a schematic diagram in Fig. 1B. The details of the peptides used in these experiments are summarized in the table within Fig. 1. For each of the peptides used, a control peptide was synthesized by replacing some of the contact residues with other amino acids. These control peptides are labeled with the suffix “m” to indicate their mutated status. The sequences of the peptides used and their corresponding residues in AC2, AC5, and AC6 are given in Fig. 1C. The first peptide we tested was from the C1a region of the central cytoplasmic loop. The peptide encoding the α1α2 region could not be synthesized and purified due to technical difficulties. We then synthesized and tested the other five peptides and their appropriate control (substituted) peptides against basal (Mg2+), Mn2+-, Gαs-, and forskolin-stimulated activities of AC2 and AC6 expressed in Hi5 cells. Of the interface peptides that were tested, only the peptide encoding the α2′ (899–926) region of the C2 domain inhibited basal activity substantially (Fig. 2). The inhibition was ∼55% for both AC2 and AC6, but the inhibition was lost in the substituted peptide, indicating the specificity of the contacts required for the effect. Two other peptides, C1-β4-β5-α4 and C2-α3′-β4′, inhibited basal activity by ∼30%. The substituted peptides showed no significant inhibition (Fig. 2). The peptides were then tested for effects on the Mn2+-stimulated activities of AC2 and AC6. Here also, the AC2 899–926 peptide encoding α2′ region substantially inhibited Mn2+-stimulated activity of AC2 and AC6. Both the extent of the inhibition of the Mn2+-stimulated activity as well as the observed potency of the peptide were similar to that seen with basal activity. The other peptides did not affect Mn2+ activity significantly (Fig. 3). These results were somewhat surprising, because it was anticipated that many if not all of the interface peptides would inhibit all adenylyl cyclase activities, since the interface interactions are thought to be required for the formation of the catalytic site. One explanation for the observed effects is that most of the interfaces are precoupled and that the addition of the exogenous peptides is insufficient to disrupt these interactions. If this is the case, then only the α2′ peptide should inhibit forskolin- and Gαs-stimulated activities as well. This was tested in Fig. 4 for Gαs and Fig. 5 for forskolin. Here we found all of the peptides inhibited both Gαs- and forskolin-stimulated activities. In all cases, substitution of key interaction residues led to loss of inhibition. The extent of the inhibition of Gαs stimulation was quite substantial. It ranged from 69% for the C1 domain peptides to 89% for the C2-α3-β4 peptide, which is close to the Gαs binding sites. The IC50 values and the percentages of inhibition for the various peptides for the different activities of AC2 and AC6 are summarized in Table I.Fig. 3Effect of varying concentrations of the five interface peptides on 10 mm Mn2+-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity of AC2 (left panel) and AC6 (right panel).

Gilman A.G. Science. 1995; 268: 1769-1772Google Scholar) provided both conceptual and experimental breakthroughs in understanding the catalytic activity of adenylyl cyclase (12Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27787-27795Google Scholar) as well as its regulation by Gαs and forskolin (5Yan S.-Z. Huang Z.-H. Rao V.-D. Hurley J.-H. Tang W.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18849-18854Google Scholar, 13Dessauer C.W. Scully T.T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27772-27777Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the soluble fragments of adenylyl cyclase with Gαs has provided structural insight into the catalytic mechanisms (14Tesmer J.G.J. Sunahara R. Johnson R.A. Gosselin G. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 756-760Google Scholar, 15Tesmer J.G.J. Sprang S.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 713-719Google Scholar) as well as the mechanisms by which Gαs and forskolin stimulate adenylyl cyclase (15Tesmer J.G.J. Sprang S.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 713-719Google Scholar, 16Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 88-92Google Scholar). The structure of the basic catalytic core postulated from the crystal structure is both simple and attractive. It is a primitive version of the “palm” domain of DNA polymerase I. The actions of both Gαs and Gαi have been explained on the basis of the catalytic core formed from the fragments of the C1 and C2 domains by the collapse of the palm domain around the substrate. These models, although plausible and quite attractive in their simplicity, have never been experimentally tested in detail in the intact full-length enzymes. In particular, the nature of the interface interactions involved in the expression of the various activities had not been determined. We decide to use a peptide-based approach to test the predicted functions of the various interfaces, because this approach allows for the testing of contiguous regions within the enzymes. Additionally, the issue of changes in conformations of local domains, which often affects the interpretation of mutational data, does not generally affect data obtained with peptide probes. We tested all of the interface peptides on the various adenylyl cyclase activities of full-length AC2 and AC6. We had typically expected to see a profile where each peptide would either inhibit all of the activities or none and that this might occur to different extents at varying peptide potencies for the different adenylyl cyclases, depending on how tightly the interfaces are coupled for a given adenylyl cyclase. Much to our surprise, we found that most of the interface peptides did not affect Mn2+-stimulated activities. Additionally, although the α2′ peptide from the C2 region inhibited Mn2+-stimulated activity, its C1 domain binding partner in the crystal structure encoding the β4-β5-α4 region of C1 did not inhibit Mn2+-stimulated activity. These observations indicate that there may be other sites of interaction for the α2′ region of the C2 domain. Also noteworthy is the divergence of the extent of the inhibition of basal activity in the presence of Mg2+ as compared with that of Gαs-stimulated activity. In all cases except that of the α2′ region peptide (C2-1) of AC2, inhibition of the basal activity was about a half or a third of that observed with Gαs stimulated activity. This effect is different from that observed with other inhibitors of adenylyl cyclase such as Gαi or P-site inhibitors and may be indicative of the differential capabilities and configurations of adenylyl cyclases for the expression of different activities; hence, we consider the implications of our observations for basal and Gαs-stimulated activities separately. Basal Activity—Although the different full-length adenylyl cyclases have substantial basal activities (8Pieroni J.P. Harry A. Chen J. Jacobowitz O. Magnusson R.P. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21368-21373Google Scholar), the soluble cytoplasmic fragments have very little measurable activity. This observation, combined with the observations in this study that show that whereas the α2′ region peptide of the C2 domain inhibits basal and Mn2+-stimulated activities by 50–60%, its binding partner region in the soluble complex, the β4-β5-α4 region of the C1 domain, is only half as effective in inhibiting Mg2+-dependent basal activity and quite ineffective in inhibiting Mn2+-stimulated activities. A reasonable interpretation of this result might be that, in the full-length adenylyl cyclase, the α2′ region of the C2 domain, in addition to interacting with the β4-β5-α4 region of the C1a region, might interact with other regions of the full-length adenylyl cyclase. Where might these regions be? One possibility is the C1b region, which is not part of the soluble adenylyl cyclase fragments used in determining the crystal structure. The structure for the C1b domain has not been solved. Yeast two-hybrid studies had suggested that the C1b domain might interact with the C2 domain of adenylyl cyclase (17Wittpoth C. Scholich K. Yigzaw Y. Stringfield T.M. Patel T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999; 96: 9551-9556Google Scholar). In the Dictyostelium adenylyl cyclase, a point mutation in the region linking the end of the sixth transmembrane domain with the central cytoplasmic loop constitutively activates the enzyme (18Parent C.A Borleis J. Devereotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1354-1360Google Scholar). How the C2 domain may interact with this region to yield high basal activity is not yet understood. It is possible that such interactions are also necessary for the Mn2+ activity. The functions of these different sites that may be involved in basal and Mn2+-stimulated activities and the nature of the interactions will have to be determined in future studies. The difference in the effects of the interface peptides on the Mn2+-stimulated versus the Gαs- and forskolin-stimulated activities is noteworthy. In the case of the latter two activities, all of the interface peptides inhibited both activities. This is the predicted result from the crystal structure. In addition, the inhibitory effect of these peptides was lost upon the substitution of key interacting residues as seen by the mutant control peptides, indicating that the interfaces align and interact within the full-length enzyme to produce Gαs- and forskolin-stimulated activities in a manner similar to that observed in the crystal structure. Thus, it is likely that the catalytic site for the Gαs-stimulated activity in the intact full-length enzyme is likely to be very similar to that observed in the crystal structure of Gαs and forskolin in complex with the C1 and C2 fragments. If this were the case, how then can the interface peptides' effects on the basal and Mn2+ effects on AC2 and AC6 be explained? One intriguing possibility is that there may be additional configurations of the full-length protein that can produce competent catalytic sites. Recently, it has been shown that Gαi cannot inhibit the Mn2+-stimulated activity of full-length AC5, although it inhibits the activity of the soluble enzyme (19Dessauer C.W. Chen-Goodspeed M. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28823-28829Google Scholar). It had been shown previously that the full-length Mn2+-stimulated enzyme cannot be inhibited by Gαi (20Hildebrandt J.D. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13141-13147Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that a different catalytic configuration may be used for the Mn2+-stimulated activity. Does this mean that the catalytic site uses different contact residues to interact with the metal-ATP complex to achieve catalysis, or does it mean that different sets of interactions between the central cytoplasmic loop and the C-terminal tail can yield the same catalytic site, with the crystal structure providing us with a picture of one such set of interactions? The later option is conceptually simpler and would be thermodynamically more feasible. It is instructive in this line of reasoning to take note of the methodology by which the crystalline configuration of the soluble domains of adenylyl cyclase complexed with the P-site inhibitors or with ATP analogs and Mn2+ were obtained. In all cases, the preformed Gαs-C1-C2 crystals were soaked with the nucleotide-divalent cation mixtures. Although this procedure has been quite valuable in elucidating the catalytic site in the presence of Gαs, by its very design this procedure precludes the possibility of observing alternative configurations that may be catalytically competent. The necessary starting point to resolve these issues will have to be a crystal structure of the membrane-bound, full-length enzyme. Gαs-stimulated Activity—Based on the crystal structure, Tesmer and Sprang (15Tesmer J.G.J. Sprang S.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 713-719Google Scholar) had proposed that the Gαs binding to the C2-C1 complex might “prime” the active site for catalysis, suggestive of a relatively stable interaction between the interfaces of the C2 and C1 domains of adenylyl cyclase in the presence of Gαs. Such a model might result in partial inhibition of the Gαs-stimulated activity, depending on the relative affinity of each interface surface for its binding partner as part of the intact protein versus the free peptide. However, in all cases, given the low IC50 values of the peptides it would appear unlikely that the extent of inhibition would be as substantial as is observed. A more dynamic model where the C1 and C2 interfaces are being constantly formed and separated might better explain the data in this study using the full-length enzymes. Here, the frequency of the opening of the interface regions in the presence of Gαs might provide the low affinity peptides with the opportunity to interact with the interface regions and thus inhibit the formation of the catalytically competent C1-C2 complex. In this regard, inhibition of Gαs-stimulated activity by the interface region peptides may differ from the Gαi inhibition. In the latter case, the formation of the Gαi-C1 complex precludes the formation of the Gαs C1-C2 complex and, hence, the inhibition. In the case of the interface peptides, it appears that the ability to block the formation of the C1-C2 complex would occur irrespective of whether or not Gαs binds the C2 domain, and the dynamics of the C1-C2 interactions would account for the observed extent of inhibition. Dynamic structures are needed to assess the validity of such models. In summary, this functional analysis of the predicted catalytically competent configuration from the crystal structure, while providing significant support for the validity of the use of the soluble fragments to understand the functions of adenylyl cyclases, suggests the possibility of the existence of dynamic structures. Future studies identifying and characterizing such structures should provide new insight into how adenylyl cyclase functions under various types of regulation."
