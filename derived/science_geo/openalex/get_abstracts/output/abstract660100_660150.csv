https://openalex.org/W3088243072,"Bacteria are essential parts of ecosystems and are the most diverse organisms on the planet. Yet, we still do not know which habitats support the highest diversity of bacteria across multiple scales. We analyzed alpha-, beta-, and gamma-diversity of bacterial assemblages using 11,680 samples compiled by the Earth Microbiome Project. We found that soils contained the highest bacterial richness within a single sample (alpha-diversity), but sediment assemblages displayed the highest gamma-diversity. Sediment, biofilms/mats, and inland water exhibited the most variation in community composition among geographic locations (beta-diversity). Within soils, agricultural lands, hot deserts, grasslands, and shrublands contained the highest richness, while forests, cold deserts, and tundra biomes consistently harbored fewer bacterial species. Surprisingly, agricultural soils encompassed similar levels of beta-diversity as other soil biomes. These patterns were robust to the alpha- and beta- diversity metrics used and the taxonomic binning approach. Overall, the results support the idea that spatial environmental heterogeneity is an important driver of bacterial diversity."
https://openalex.org/W3089096184,"The current study determined the area-per-player during small- or large-sided games with or without goalkeeper that replicates the relative (m·min-1) total distance, high-intensity running distance, sprint distance and metabolic power covered during official matches. Time-motion analysis was performed on twenty-five elite soccer-players during 26 home-matches. A total of 2565 individual samples for SSGs using different pitch sizes and different number of players were collected and classified as SSGs with (SSG-G) or without goalkeeper (SSG-P). A between-position comparison was also performed. The area-per-player needed to replicate the official match demands was largely higher in SSG-G vs SSG-P for total distance [187±53 vs 115±35 m2, effect size (ES): 1.60 95%CI 0.94/2.21], high-intensity running distance [262±72 vs 166±39 m2, ES: 1.66(0.99/2.27)] and metabolic power [177±42 vs 94±40, ES: 1.99(1.31/2.67)], but similar for sprint distance [(316±75 vs 295±99 m2, ES: 0.24(-0.32/0.79)] with direction of larger area-per-player for sprint distance > high-intensity running > total distance ≌ metabolic power for both SSG-G and SSG-P. In SSG-G, forwards required higher area-per-player than central-defenders [ES: 2.96(1.07/4.35)], wide-midfielders [ES: 2.45(0.64/3.78)] and wide-defenders [ES: 3.45(1.13/4.99)]. Central-midfielders required higher area-per-player than central-defenders [ES: 1.69(0.20/2.90)] and wide-midfielders [ES: 1.35(-0.13/2.57)]. In SSG-P, central defenders need lower area-per-player (ES: -6.01/-0.92) to overall replicate the match demands compared to all other positions. The current results may be used to gain knowledge of the SSGs relative to the match demands. This imply manipulating SSGs using higher or lower ApP, the presence of the goalkeeper or design specific rules to increase or decrease the position-specific demands with respect to the desired external load outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3088969476,"Following its initial appearance in December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) quickly spread around the globe. Here, we evaluated the role of climate (temperature and precipitation), region-specific COVID-19 susceptibility (BCG vaccination factors, malaria incidence, and percentage of the population aged over 65 years), and human mobility (relative amounts of international visitors) in shaping the geographical patterns of COVID-19 case numbers across 1,020 countries/regions, and examined the sequential shift that occurred from December 2019 to June 30, 2020 in multiple drivers of the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases. Our regression model adequately explains the cumulative COVID-19 case numbers (per 1 million population). As the COVID-19 spread progressed, the explanatory power (R2) of the model increased, reaching > 70% in April 2020. Climate, host mobility, and host susceptibility to COVID-19 largely explained the variance among COVID-19 case numbers across locations; the relative importance of host mobility and that of host susceptibility to COVID-19 were both greater than that of climate. Notably, the relative importance of these factors changed over time; the number of days from outbreak onset drove COVID-19 spread in the early stage, then human mobility accelerated the pandemic, and lastly climate (temperature) propelled the phase following disease expansion. Our findings demonstrate that the COVID-19 pandemic is deterministically driven by climate suitability, cross-border human mobility, and region-specific COVID-19 susceptibility. The identification of these multiple drivers of the COVID-19 outbreak trajectory, based on mapping the spread of COVID-19, will contribute to a better understanding of the COVID-19 disease transmission risk and inform long-term preventative measures against this disease."
https://openalex.org/W3088144956,"Salmonella is an important human pathogen and poultry products constitute an important source of human infections. This study investigated prevalence; identified serotypes based on whole genome sequence, described spatial distribution of Salmonella serotypes and predicted risk factors that could influence the prevalence of Salmonella infection in commercial poultry farms in Nigeria. A cross sectional approach was employed to collect 558 pooled shoe socks and dust samples from 165 commercial poultry farms in North West Nigeria. On-farm visitation questionnaires were administered to obtain information on farm management practices in order to assess risk factors for Salmonella prevalence. Salmonella was identified by culture, biotyping, serology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR confirmed isolates were paired-end Illumina- sequenced. Following de novo genome assembly, draft genomes were used to obtain serotypes by SeqSero2 and SISTR pipeline and sequence types by SISTR and Enterobase. Risk factor analysis was performed using the logit model. A farm prevalence of 47.9% (CI95 [40.3-55.5]) for Salmonella was observed, with a sample level prevalence of 15.9% (CI95 [12.9-18.9]). Twenty-three different serotypes were identified, with S. Kentucky and S. Isangi as the most prevalent (32.9% and 11%). Serotypes showed some geographic variation. Salmonella detection was strongly associated with disposal of poultry waste and with presence of other livestock on the farm. Salmonella was commonly detected on commercial poultry farms in North West Nigeria and S. Kentucky was found to be ubiquitous in the farms."
https://openalex.org/W3088148160,"How could we explain the mechanism driving the effects of Urban Green Space (UGS) on human health? This mechanism is a complex one suggesting, on one hand, an indirect effect of UGS Provision (measured as quantity, quality or accessibility of UGS) on health through UGS Exposure (measured as visit frequency to UGS, duration of visit or intensity of activities taking place during the visit). On the other hand, UGS Provision may have an indirect effect on Exposure, mediated by people's perception of UGS. The mechanism further suggests that UGS Exposure may influence indirectly human Health but mediated by human motivation to use UGS. We tested these different expectations by fitting 12 alternative structural equation models (SEMs) corresponding to four different scenarios, depending on how UGS Provision was approximated. We show that SEMs where i) Provision is approximated as UGS quantity, and Exposure as duration (SEMi), ii) Provision is approximated as quantity, and Exposure as intensity (SEMii) and iii) Provision is approximated as distance of the closest UGS from people's house, and Exposure as intensity (SEMiii) are equally the best of all 12 SEMs tested. However, apart from the SEMi that has no significant path, SEMii and SEMiii have the same significant path (motivation ~ intensity; β = 7.86±2.03, p = 0.0002), suggesting that visits to UGS may be motivated by opportunities of physical activities offered by UGS. In all our scenarios, the best SEM is always the one where Exposure is measured as intensity, irrespective of how Provision is approximated. This suggests that it is not only UGS provision that matters the most in the mechanism linking UGS to human health improvement, but rather intensity, i.e. the type of activities people engage in when they visit UGSs. Overall, our findings support the theoretical model tested in this study."
https://openalex.org/W3088488554,"Mindfulness-based programs hold promise for improving cardiovascular health (e.g. physical activity, diet, blood pressure). However, despite theoretical frameworks proposed, no studies have reported qualitative findings on how study participants themselves believe mindfulness-based programs improved their cardiovascular health. With an emphasis on in-depth, open-ended investigation, qualitative methods are well suited to explore the mechanisms underlying health outcomes. The objective of this qualitative study was to explore the mechanisms through which the mindfulness-based program, Mindfulness-Based Blood Pressure Reduction (MB-BP), may influence cardiovascular health.This qualitative study was conducted as part of a Stage 1 single arm trial with one-year follow-up. The MB-BP curriculum was adapted from Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction to direct participants' mindfulness skills towards modifiable determinants of blood pressure. Four focus group discussions were conducted (N = 19 participants), and seven additional participants were selected for in-depth interviews. Data analysis was conducted using the standard approach of thematic analysis. Following double-coding of audio-recorded transcripts, four members of the study team engaged in an iterative process of data analysis and interpretation.Participants identified self-awareness, attention control, and emotion regulation as key mechanisms that led to improvements in cardiovascular health. Within these broader themes, many participants detailed a process beginning with increased self-awareness to sustain attention and regulate emotions. Many also explained that the specific relationship between self-awareness and emotion regulation enabled them to respond more skillfully to stressors. In a secondary sub-theme, participants suggested that higher self-awareness helped them engage in positive health behaviors (e.g. healthier dietary choices).Qualitative analyses suggest that MB-BP mindfulness practices allowed participants to engage more effectively in self-regulation skills and behaviors lowering cardiovascular disease risk, which supports recent theory. Results are consistent with quantitative mechanistic findings showing emotion regulation, perceived stress, interoceptive awareness, and attention control are influenced by MB-BP."
https://openalex.org/W3088832643,"The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of various anatomical structures on intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements obtained by the Corneal Visualization Scheimpflug Technology (Corvis ST), Goldmann applanation tonometer (GAT), and noncontact tonometer (NCT), as well as to assess the interchangeability among the four types of IOP measurement: IOP-GAT, IOP-NCT, IOP-Corvis, and biomechanically corrected IOP (bIOP-Corvis), with a particular focus on bIOP-Corvis.We included 71 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and assessed their IOP measurements obtained with the GAT, NCT, and Corvis ST using a repeated measures ANOVA, a paired t-test with Bonferroni correction, stepwise multiple regression analyses and Bland-Altman plots.IOP-GAT showed the highest values (13.5 ± 2.1 mmHg [mean ± standard deviation]), followed by IOP-NCT (13.2 ± 2.7 mmHg), IOP-Corvis (10.6 ± 2.8 mmHg), and bIOP-Corvis (10.0 ± 2.3 mmHg). With exceptions of bIOP-Corvis and IOP-GAT, all IOP variations were explained by regression coefficients involving the central corneal thickness. Bland-Altman plots showed a mean difference between IOP-GAT and the other IOP measurements (IOP-Corvis, bIOP-Corvis, and IOP-NCT), which were -2.90, -3.48, and -0.29 mmHg, respectively. The widths of the 95% limits of agreement between all pairs of IOP measurements were greater than 3 mmHg.IOP values obtained with the Corvis ST, NCT, and GAT were not interchangeable. The bIOP-Corvis measurement corrected for the ocular structure."
https://openalex.org/W3087824029,"Background Radiomic features, extracted from positron emission tomography, aim to characterize tumour biology based on tracer intensity, tumour geometry and/or tracer uptake heterogeneity. Currently, radiomic features are derived from static images. However, temporal changes in tracer uptake might reveal new aspects of tumour biology. This study aims to explore additional information of these novel dynamic radiomic features compared to those derived from static or metabolic rate images. Methods Thirty-five patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma underwent dynamic [18F]FDG PET/CT scans. Spatial intensity, shape and texture radiomic features were derived from volumes of interest delineated on static PET and parametric metabolic rate PET. Dynamic grey level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) and grey level run length matrix (GLRLM) features, assessing the temporal domain unidirectionally, were calculated on eight and sixteen time frames of equal length. Spearman’s rank correlations of parametric and dynamic features with static features were calculated to identify features with potential additional information. Survival analysis was performed for the non-redundant temporal features and a selection of static features using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results Three out of 90 parametric features showed moderate correlations with corresponding static features (ρ≥0.61), all other features showed high correlations (ρ>0.7). Dynamic features are robust independent of frame duration. Five out of 22 dynamic GLCM features showed a negligible to moderate correlation with any static feature, suggesting additional information. All sixteen dynamic GLRLM features showed high correlations with static features, implying redundancy. Log-rank analyses of Kaplan-Meier survival curves for all features dichotomised at the median were insignificant. Conclusion This study suggests that, compared to static features, some dynamic GLCM radiomic features show different information, whereas parametric features provide minimal additional information. Future studies should be conducted in larger populations to assess whether there is a clinical benefit of radiomics using the temporal domain over traditional radiomics."
https://openalex.org/W3087987531,"Familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are caused by mutations in the presenilin genes or in the gene encoding for the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Proteolytic cleavage of APP generates the β-amyloid peptide (Aβ), which aggregates into amyloid plaques, one of the major hallmarks of AD. APP mutations within the Aβ sequence, so-called intra-Aβ mutations, cluster around position E693 of APP, which corresponds to position E22 in the Aβ sequence. One of these mutations is the Osaka mutation, E693Δ, which has unique aggregation properties with patients showing unusually low brain amyloid levels on amyloid PET scans. Despite intense research on the pathomechanisms of different intra-Aβ mutants, our knowledge is limited due to controversial findings in various studies. Here, we investigated in an ex vivo experimental system the neuro- and synaptotoxic properties of two intra-Aβ mutants with different intrinsic aggregation propensities, the Osaka mutation E22Δ and the Arctic mutation E22G, and compared them to wild-type (wt) Aβ. Experiments in hippocampal slice cultures from transgenic mice were complemented by treating wild-type slices with recombinantly produced Aβ40 or Aβ42 containing the respective intra-Aβ mutations. Our analyses revealed that wt Aβ and E22G Aβ, both recombinant and transgenic, caused a loss of dendritic spines along with an increase in tau phosphorylation and tau-dependent neurodegeneration. In all experiments, the 42-residue variants of wt and E22G Aβ showed stronger effects than the respective Aβ40 isoforms. In contrast, E22Δ Aβ neither reduced dendritic spine density nor resulted in increased tau phosphorylation or neuronal cell death in our ex vivo system. Our findings suggest that the previously reported major differences in the aggregation kinetics between E22G and E22Δ Aβ are likely reflected in different disease pathomechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3088371240,"Knowledge mobilisation is required to ""bridge the gap"" between research, policy and practice. This activity is dependent on the amount, richness and quality of the data published. To understand the impact of a changing climate on commercial species, stakeholder communities require better knowledge of their past and current situations. The common cockle (Cerastoderma edule) is an excellent model species for this type of analysis, as it is well-studied due to its cultural, commercial and ecological significance in west Europe. Recently, C. edule harvests have decreased, coinciding with frequent mass mortalities, due to factors such as a changing climate and diseases. In this study, macro and micro level marine historical ecology techniques were used to create datasets on topics including: cockle abundance, spawning duration and harvest levels, as well as the ecological factors impacting those cockle populations. These data were correlated with changing climate and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) index to assess if they are drivers of cockle abundance and harvesting. The analyses identified the key stakeholder communities involved in cockle research and data acquisition. It highlighted that data collection was sporadic and lacking in cross-national/stakeholder community coordination. A major finding was that local variability in cockle populations is influenced by biotic (parasites) and abiotic (temperature, legislation and harvesting) factors, and at a global scale by climate (AMO Index). This comprehensive study provided an insight into the European cockle fishery but also highlights the need to identify the type of data required, the importance of standardised monitoring, and dissemination efforts, taking into account the knowledge, source, and audience. These factors are key elements that will be highly beneficial not only to the cockle stakeholder communities but to other commercial species."

Choosing the right adsorbent is still a question for many breeders and an important criterion for feed manufacturers. New adsorbents are still being sought. Graphene oxide is a promising material in the field of nanotechnology, which excels in its adsorption properties. Presented in vitro study investigates graphene oxide for the binding of mycotoxins from crushed wheat. The results show that graphene oxide has an adsorption capacity for aflatoxin 0.045 mg/g, zearalenone 0.53 mg/g and deoxynivalenol 1.69 mg/g at 37° C. In vitro simulation of crushed wheat digestion showed rapid adsorption during the gastric phase. Of the minerals, Mg, Cu and Zn were the most adsorbed. The applied dose of graphene oxide of 10 mg/g caused only a slight inhibition of the digestive enzymes α-amylase and trypsin compared to pepsin and gastric lipase. In vitro results indicated the suitability of graphene oxide in the adsorption of the aflatoxin, zearalenone and deoxynivalenol."
https://openalex.org/W3088979019,"In this study, a convolutional neural network with threshold optimization (CNN-THOP) is proposed to solve the issue of overlabeling or downlabeling arising during the multilabel image annotation process in the use of a ranking function for label annotation along with prediction probability. This model fuses the threshold optimization algorithm to the CNN structure. First, an optimal model trained by the CNN is used to predict the test set images, and batch normalization (BN) is added to the CNN structure to effectively accelerate the convergence speed and obtain a group of prediction probabilities. Second, threshold optimization is performed on the obtained prediction probability to derive an optimal threshold for each class of labels to form a group of optimal thresholds. When the prediction probability for this class of labels is greater than or equal to the corresponding optimal threshold, this class of labels is used as the annotation result for the image. During the annotation process, the multilabel annotation for the image to be annotated is realized by loading the optimal model and the optimal threshold. Verification experiments are performed on the MIML, COREL5K, and MSRC datasets. Compared with the MBRM, the CNN-THOP increases the average precision on MIML, COREL5K, and MSRC by 27%, 28% and 33%, respectively. Compared with the E2E-DCNN, the CNN-THOP increases the average recall rate by 3% on both COREL5K and MSRC. The most precise annotation effect for CNN-THOP is observed on the MIML dataset, with a complete matching degree reaching 64.8%."
https://openalex.org/W3087820398,"Wheat is a major food grain in Pakistan having a prominent role in agriculture as well as the economic status of the country. In the current study, seeds of 99 wheat landraces were characterized for the quantification of seed storage proteins (Albumins, Globulin, Gliadins, and Glutenin), enzyme activities of antioxidant enzymes i.e. Ascorbate peroxidase (APX), Catalase (CAT), Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Peroxidase (POD), one hydrolytic enzyme Protease (PROT) and non-enzymatic antioxidant enzyme Ascorbic acid (AsA). The landraces were categorized into low, medium, and high based on protein concentration and enzymes activities/content. The majority of the landraces were placed in the medium category. However, for the AsA parameter majority of the landraces were placed in the low category. The highest concentration of total extracted protein (184.88±0.7 mg/g. wt.), globulins (21.35±0.43 mg/g. wt.) and glutenin (20±0.04 mg/g. wt.) as well as the high activity of SOD (303±16.80 Units/g. wt.), and Ascorbic acid (533±36.1 Units/g. wt.) was identified in the wheat landrace ""11757"" collected from district Panjgur (Balochistan). The wheat landrace ""11760"", collected from district Kech (Balochistan), contained the highest albumins concentration (65.42±0.02 mg/g. wt.) and highest activity for CAT (589.5±61.20 Units/g. wt.). The highest activity of POD (32341± 91.3) and PROT was observed in seeds of the wheat landrace ""11618"" collected from the Gilgit Baltistan region of Pakistan. The principal component analysis showed that the great variations existed for the tested parameters among the wheat landraces. The landraces with a high concentration of seed storage proteins and antioxidant enzyme activities can be used for breeding purposes to improve the nutrimental quality of wheat cultivars."
https://openalex.org/W3088460201,"Aircrew members are required to attend hypoxia awareness training regularly to strengthen their memory of their personal hypoxia symptoms by undergoing training inside a hypobaric chamber. The aim of this study was to examine the association between hypoxia symptoms experienced during two training sessions that were 4 years apart.This was a crossover study to compare hypoxia symptoms and self-reported physiological effects of trapped gas between a previous training session and a current training session in an altitude chamber. The subjects were military crew members who undertook a 25,000-feet refresher training course in 2018. We used a structured questionnaire to obtain the target information before and during hypoxia exposure. Data were analyzed using SPSS software.A total of 341 trainees participated in this survey and completely filled out the questionnaire. Gastrointestinal tract discomfort caused by the expansion of trapped gas was the main physiological reaction during the previous and current training sessions. Frequently reported symptoms were poor concentration (30.5%), impaired cognitive function (20.5%), visual disturbances (16.4%), hot flashes (15.8%), and paresthesia (12.6%) during both exposures. However, the proportions of participants reporting poor concentration (P = 0.378) and visual disturbances (P = 0.594) were not significantly different between the recalled and current training sessions. The five most common symptoms among the subjects with less than 1,000 flight hours were poor concentration (29.8%), visual disturbance (27.3%), impaired cognitive function (14.9%), dizziness/lightheadedness (11.6%), and hot flashes (9.9%), which overlapped substantially with the symptoms reported by other subjects. The occurrence of those five most common symptoms in the group with more than 1,000 flight hours did not significantly differ between the recalled training session and the current training session.The most common hypoxia symptoms reported were similar between the recalled and current training sessions in an environment with a low oxygen concentration. This finding was also clearly affected by the duration of flight experience. Moreover, GI effects of the expansion of trapped gas were commonly observed at low atmospheric pressure."
https://openalex.org/W3088912891,"Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), a mycotoxin, is acutely hepatotoxic to many animals including humans. However, there are marked interspecies differences in sensitivity to AFB1-induced toxicity depending on bioactivation by cytochrome P450s (CYPs). In the present study, we examined the applicability of chimeric mice with humanized livers and derived fresh human hepatocytes for in vivo and vitro studies on AFB1 cytotoxicity to human hepatocytes. Chimeric mice with highly humanized livers and SCID mice received daily injections of vehicle (corn oil), AFB1 (3 mg/kg), and carbon tetrachloride (50 mg/kg) for 2 days. Histological analysis revealed that AFB1 promoted hepatocyte vacuolation and inflammatory cell infiltration in the area containing human hepatocytes. A novel human alanine aminotransferase 1 specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated the acute toxicity of AFB1 to human hepatocytes in the chimeric mouse livers. The sensitivity of cultured fresh human hepatocytes isolated from the humanized liver mice for AFB1 cytotoxicity was comparable to that of primary human hepatocytes. Long-term exposure to AFB1 (6 or 14 days) produced a more severe cytotoxicity. The half-maximal lethal concentration was 10 times lower in the 2-week treatment than after 2 days of exposure. Lastly, the significant reduction of AFB1 cytotoxicity by a pan-CYP inhibitor or transfection with CYP3A4 specific siRNA clearly suggested that bioactivation of AFB1 catalyzed by CYPs was essential for AFB1 cytotoxicity to the human hepatocytes in our mouse model. Collectively, our results implicate the humanized liver mice and derived fresh human hepatocytes are useful models for studies of AFB1 cytotoxicity to human hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W3088218026,"Amelanotic/hypomelanotic melanoma is a clinicopathologic subtype with absent or minimal melanin. This study assessed previously reported coding variants in albinism genes (TYR, OCA2, TYRP1, SLC45A2, SLC24A5, LRMDA) and common intronic, regulatory variants of OCA2 in individuals with amelanotic/hypomelanotic melanoma, pigmented melanoma cases and controls. Exome sequencing was available for 28 individuals with amelanotic/hypomelanotic melanoma and 303 individuals with pigmented melanoma, which were compared to whole exome data from 1144 Australian controls. Microarray genotyping was available for a further 17 amelanotic/hypomelanotic melanoma, 86 pigmented melanoma, 147 melanoma cases (pigmentation unknown) and 652 unaffected controls. Rare deleterious variants in TYR/OCA1 were more common in amelanotic/hypomelanotic melanoma cases than pigmented melanoma cases (set mixed model association tests P = 0.0088). The OCA2 hypomorphic allele p.V443I was more common in melanoma cases (1.8%) than controls (1.0%, X2 P = 0.02), and more so in amelanotic/hypomelanotic melanoma (4.4%, X2 P = 0.007). No amelanotic/hypomelanotic melanoma cases carried an eye and skin darkening haplotype of OCA2 (including rs7174027), present in 7.1% of pigmented melanoma cases (P = 0.0005) and 9.4% controls. Variants in TYR and OCA2 may play a role in amelanotic/hypomelanotic melanoma susceptibility. We suggest that somatic loss of function at these loci could contribute to the loss of tumor pigmentation, consistent with this we found a higher rate of somatic mutation in TYR/OCA2 in amelanotic/hypomelanotic melanoma vs pigmented melanoma samples (28.6% vs 3.0%; P = 0.021) from The Cancer Genome Atlas Skin Cutaneous Melanoma collection."
https://openalex.org/W3088244418,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can lead to neurodegeneration in the injured circuitry, either through primary structural damage to the neuron or secondary effects that disrupt key cellular processes. Moreover, traumatic injuries can preferentially impact subpopulations of neurons, but the functional network effects of these targeted degeneration profiles remain unclear. Although isolating the consequences of complex injury dynamics and long-term recovery of the circuit can be difficult to control experimentally, computational networks can be a powerful tool to analyze the consequences of injury. Here, we use the Izhikevich spiking neuron model to create networks representative of cortical tissue. After an initial settling period with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), networks developed rhythmic oscillations similar to those seen in vivo. As neurons were sequentially removed from the network, population activity rate and oscillation dynamics were significantly reduced. In a successive period of network restructuring with STDP, network activity levels returned to baseline for some injury levels and oscillation dynamics significantly improved. We next explored the role that specific neurons have in the creation and termination of oscillation dynamics. We determined that oscillations initiate from activation of low firing rate neurons with limited structural inputs. To terminate oscillations, high activity excitatory neurons with strong input connectivity activate downstream inhibitory circuitry. Finally, we confirm the excitatory neuron population role through targeted neurodegeneration. These results suggest targeted neurodegeneration can play a key role in the oscillation dynamics after injury."
https://openalex.org/W3088717166,"Global efforts to eradicate 'child marriage' (<18 years) increasingly target governments, the private sector and the general public as agents of change. However, understanding of child marriage may be subject to popular misconceptions, particularly because of ambiguity in the age threshold implied by the term 'child', and because awareness campaigns routinely emphasize extreme scenarios of very young girls forcibly married to much older men. Here, we ascertain public knowledge of child marriage via an online survey. Half of those surveyed mistakenly believed that the cut-off for child marriage is younger than the threshold of 18 years, and nearly three-quarters incorrectly believed that most child marriages occur at 15 years or below (it primarily occurs in later adolescence). Most participants also incorrectly believed that child marriage is illegal throughout the USA (it's illegal in only 4/50 states), substantially overestimated its global prevalence, and mistakenly believed that it primarily takes place among Muslim-majority world regions. Our results highlight important popular misconceptions of child marriage that may ultimately undermine global health goals and perpetuate harmful stereotypes. Organizations seeking to empower women by reducing child marriage should be cautious of these misunderstandings, and wary of the potential for their own activities to seed misinformation."
https://openalex.org/W3088130504,"Hearing aids are the primary tool in non-medical rehabilitation for individuals with hearing loss. While the costs of the electronic components have reduced substantially, the cost of a hearing aid has risen steadily to the point that it has become unaffordable for the majority of the population with Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL) especially for those residing in low- and middle-income countries. Here, we present an ultra-low-cost, affordable and accessible hearing aid device (‘LoCHAid’), specifically targeted towards treating ARHL in elderly patients. The LoCHAid components cost 98 cents (< $1) when purchased in bulk for 10,000 units and can be personalized for each user through a 3D-printable case. It is designed to be an over-the-counter (OTC) self-serviceable solution for elderly individuals with ARHL. Electroacoustic measurements show that the device meets most of the targets set out by the WHO Preferred Product Profile and Consumer Technology Association for hearing aids. The frequency response of the hearing aid shows selectable gain in the range of 4-8 kHz, and mild to moderate gain between 200-1000 Hz, and shows very limited total distortion (1%). Simulated gain measurements show that the LoCHAid is well fitted to a range of ARHL profiles for males and females between the ages of 60-79 years. Overall, the measurements show that the device offers the potential to benefit individuals with ARHL. Thus, our proposed design has the potential to address the challenge of affordable and accessible hearing technology for hearing impaired elderly individuals especially in low- and middle-income countries."
https://openalex.org/W3088252370,"Background The application of digital technology to improve health service delivery is increasing rapidly in Low- and Middle- Income Countries (LMICs). Digital tools such as electronic health (e-health) have been shown to improve healthcare quality, efficiency and patient satisfaction. However, evidence on health workers’ experiences using e-health services is limited in LMICs. This study examined the relationship between e-health usage and health workers’ motivation and job satisfaction. Methods This was a cross-sectional survey design involving health workers across public and private hospitals in the Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA). A structured questionnaire was designed and self-administered to 305 respondents. Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) was employed to analyse the data. Results Findings showed a significant positive association of job satisfaction with e-health (p < 0.01) and type of hospital (p < 0.01) but not motivation (p = 0.42). Although type of hospital significantly influenced job satisfaction (p < 0.01), it had no significant mediating effect on the relationship between e-health and job satisfaction. Finally, type of hospital interacted with e-health to moderate the association between e-health usage and job satisfaction. Conclusion The findings suggest that e-health systems can catalyse health workers job satisfaction. Thus, measures to strengthen e-health structures to improve on their efficiency and effectiveness is crucial."

One reason for poor prognosis is the lack of understanding regarding individual variability in response to treatment. Idiopathic PAH (IPAH) patients with bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (BMPR2) mutations have distinct phenotypes that are crucial for individualized therapy but evidence regarding their prevalence and clinical features in the Korean population is lacking. Therefore, the present study aimed to screen Korean IPAH patients for BMPR2 mutations and analyze their clinical phenotypes. Methods We enrolled 73 unrelated IPAH patients for BMPR2 mutation screening between March 2010 to November 2015 from 11 hospitals in Korea. Thirty-three lineal family members from 6 families of BMPR2 mutation carriers were also screened. Results Among 73 patients, 16 (22%) had BMPR2 mutations. Mutation carriers were younger (27 vs. 47 years; p = 0.02) and had a higher mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) than non-carriers (64 vs. 51 mmHg; p<0.05). Of the 16 individuals with mutations, 5 deletion, 2 splice-site, 6 nonsense, and 3 missense mutations were found, among which, 9 were newly identified mutation types. Patients less than 30 years old had more BMPR2 mutations (44 vs. 14%; p = 0.04) and a higher mPAP (64 vs. 50 mmHg; p = 0.04) compared with those equaled to or over 30 years old. There were no differences in hemodynamic profiles or the proportion of BMPR2 mutation carriers between groups according to sex. Conclusion The prevalence of BMPR2 mutations in Korean IPAH patients was 22%. Mutation carriers were younger and had a poorer hemodynamic profile compared with the non-carriers.

Diabetes causes early structural changes of retina, especially on ganglion cell layer. In this regard, the FPG level itself may also show an independent association with open angle glaucoma (OAG) development in general population. Herein, we investigate the association of the FPG level with the incidence of OAG.Using nationally representative data from the Korean National Health Insurance System, 374,376 subjects ≥40 years of age without OAG who underwent health examinations from 2009 to 2013 were enrolled and followed to the end of 2014. Incident cases of OAG using the International Classification of Diseases 10 codes and medication information were analyzed based on the levels of FPG.Subjects with the highest FPG level (≥160 mg/dL), compared with the lowest level (<80 mg/dL), showed a higher hazard ratio (HR) [2.189; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.779-2.695; P for trend < 0.001] for OAG after adjustments for age and sex. This result persisted after further adjustments for the presence of type 2 diabetes, current smoking, drinking, and exercise habits, diastolic blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), and total cholesterol level (HR: 1.588; 95% CI: 1.268-1.989; P for trend < 0.001). The positive association between the FPG level and the incidence of OAG was distinct in subjects 40-64 years of age, those with a BMI <25 kg/m2, and those without hypertension (HR 2.022; 95% CI: 1.494-2.736; P for trend <0.001: HR 1.817; 95% CI: 1.372-2.407; P for trend < 0.001: HR 1.706; 95% CI: 1.180-2.467; P for trend <0.001, respectively).This nationwide population-based cohort study showed that the fasting glucose was associated with an increased risk of OAG. These findings suggest that subjects with high FPG levels require special attention when screening for glaucoma."
https://openalex.org/W3089156204,"Interprofessional education is important for increasing the quality of patient care, but organising it in primary healthcare is still challenging. The aim of this study was to develop and assess a virtual patient model for primary healthcare and to investigate students' perceptions of learning with this interprofessional virtual patient model.The virtual patient case described a patient with several medical conditions who had returned home after surgery. The virtual patient included text files, short videos, and links to illustrate different health professions' roles in home care. Ten interprofessional groups with 39 students assessed the virtual patient from four different study programmes: nursing, physiotherapy, medicine, and occupational therapy. The students answered a questionnaire about how they perceived the usability of the virtual patient and participated in group interviews. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyse the data from the semi-structured group interviews.The analysis of the interviews resulted in four main categories: The virtual patient model facilitated the learning process; It was beneficial to have students from different programmes in the group when working with the virtual patient; Working with the virtual patient helped the students to understand the roles and competencies of their own and other professions and All professions are needed in clinical work in order to help the patient. The students perceived that the mixture of text and multimedia made the virtual patient seem authentic and stimulated their group discussions, which they valued most. The students gave generally high points for usability in the questionnaire, but they also gave input for improvement of the program in their comments.The interprofessional virtual patient model facilitated interactions and discussions between students and may be a useful complement for interprofessional education in clinical contexts and might be a suitable tool in preparing students for future teamwork."
https://openalex.org/W3089217717,"With the uncontrolled expansion of anthropogenic modifications of the environment, wildlife species are forced to interact with humans, often leading to conflict situations that have detrimental effects for both wildlife and humans. Such interactions are escalating globally, making it crucial for us to devise strategies for both, the management of conflict and the conservation of these often-threatened species. We studied a case of potentially detrimental human-wildlife interactions between an endemic, habitat-specialist primate, the lion-tailed macaque Macaca silenus and resident human communities that has developed in recent years in the Western Ghats mountains of southern India. Primates provide useful model systems to understand the extent and nature of behavioural changes exhibited by wildlife in response to anthropogenic habitats with varying degrees of human influence. We documented behaviours, including foraging and intra-species social interactions, to examine the decisions made by the macaques as they exploited four human-modified habitats, which, for the purpose of this study, have been qualitatively characterised to include structural features of the habitat, type of food resources available and the presence of humans. Access to human-origin food, either cooked or packaged, acquired directly from homes or garbage pits, in the human-dominated habitat appeared to significantly reduce active foraging and searching for food, allowing them to engage in other behavioural activities, such as resting. Furthermore, patterns of reciprocated affiliation dissipated in certain human-dominated habitats, with individuals seeming to have adopted novel behavioural strategies, leading to altered social dynamics in the troop, possibly in response to provisioning. This study thus highlights the importance of understanding behavioural changes displayed by animals in response to human interactions; such knowledge could be crucial for the planning and implementation of management and conservation strategies for endangered species such as the lion-tailed macaque and possibly other wildlife in the increasingly anthropogenic landscapes of the tropical world."
https://openalex.org/W3087866366,"The reduction of food intake during pregnancy is part of many cultural and religious traditions around the world. The impact of such practices on fetal growth and development are poorly understood. Here, we examined the patterns of diet intake among Maasai pregnant women and assessed their effect on newborn morphometrics. We recruited 141 mother-infant pairs from Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA) in Northern Tanzania and quantified dietary intake and changes in maternal diet during pregnancy. We obtained measurements of body weight (BW) and head circumference (HC) at birth. We found that Maasai women significantly reduced their dietary intake during the third trimester, going from an average of 1601 kcal/day during the first two trimesters to 799 kcal/day in the final trimester. The greatest proportion of nutrient reduction was in carbohydrates. Overall, 40% of HC Z-scores of the NCA sample were more than 2 standard deviations below the WHO standard. Nearly a third of neonates classify as low birth weight (< 2500g). HC was smaller relative to BW in this cohort than predicted using the WHO standard. This contrasts markedly to a Tanzanian birth cohort obtained at the same time in an urban context in which only 12% of infants exhibited low weight, only two individuals had HC Z-scores < 2 and HC's relative to birth weight were larger than predicted using the WHO standards. The surprising lack of head sparing in the NCA cohort suggests that the impact of third trimester malnutrition bears further investigation in both animal models and human populations, especially as low HC is negatively associated with long term health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3087878015,"Garcinia kola (Heckel) is a versatile tree indigenous to West and Central Africa. All parts of the tree have value in traditional medicine. Natural populations of the species have declined over the years due to overexploitation. Assessment of genetic diversity and population structure of G. kola is important for its management and conservation. The present study investigates the genetic diversity and population structure of G. kola populations in Benin using ultra-high-throughput diversity array technology (DArT) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. From the 102 accessions sampled, two were excluded from the final dataset owing to poor genotyping coverage. A total of 43,736 SNPs were reported, of which 12,585 were used for analyses after screening with quality control parameters including Minor allele frequency (≥ 0.05), call rate (≥ 80%), reproducibility (≥ 95%), and polymorphic information content (≥ 1%). Analysis revealed low genetic diversity with expected heterozygosity per population ranging from 0.196 to 0.228. Pairwise F-statistics (FST) revealed low levels of genetic differentiation between populations while an Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated that the majority of variation (97.86%) was within populations. Population structure analysis through clustering and discriminant analysis on principal component revealed two admixed clusters, implying little genetic structure. However, the model-based maximum likelihood in Admixture indicated only one genetic cluster. The present study indicated low genetic diversity of G. kola, and interventions are needed to be tailored towards its conservation."
https://openalex.org/W3087890299,"An accurate description of trophic interactions is crucial to understand ecosystem functioning and sustainably manage marine ecosystems exploitation. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes were coupled with stomach content analyses to investigate whiting (Merlangius merlangus, Linnaeus, 1758) feeding behavior in the Eastern English Channel and Southern North Sea. Whiting juveniles and adults were sampled in autumn and winter to investigate both ontogenetic and seasonal changes. In addition, queen scallops (Aequipecten opercularis) samples were collected along with fish to be used as isotopic benthic baseline. Results indicated an ontogenetic diet change from crustaceans to fish and cephalopods. In autumn, δ15N values generally increased with fish size while in winter, a decrease of δ15N values with fish size was observed, as a potential result of spatial variation in baseline δ15N values. In winter, a nutrient-poor period, an increase in feeding intensity was observed, especially on the copepod Temora longicornis. This study provides further insights into whiting trophic ecology in relation to ontogenetic and seasonal variations, and it confirms the importance of combining several trophic analysis methods to understand ecosystem functioning."
https://openalex.org/W3087946631,"Despite recent progress in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), many patients still fail to achieve remission or low disease activity. An imbalance between auto-reactive effector T cells (Teff) and regulatory T cells (Treg) may contribute to joint inflammation and damage in RA. Therefore, restoring this balance is a promising approach for the treatment of inflammatory arthritis. Accordingly, our group has previously shown that the combination of TGF-β-releasing microparticles (MP), rapamycin-releasing MP, and IL-2-releasing MP (TRI MP) can effectively increase the ratio of Tregs to Teff in vivo and provide disease protection in several preclinical models. In this study TRI MP was evaluated in the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model. Although this formulation has been tested previously in models of destructive inflammation and transplantation, this is the first model of autoimmunity for which this therapy has been applied. In this context, TRI MP effectively reduced arthritis incidence, the severity of arthritis scores, and bone erosion. The proposed mechanism of action includes not only reducing CD4+ T cell proliferation, but also expanding a regulatory population in the periphery soon after TRI MP administration. These changes were reflected in the CD4+ T cell population that infiltrated the paws at the onset of arthritis and were associated with a reduction of immune infiltrate and inflammatory myeloid cells in the paws. TRI MP administration also reduced the titer of collagen antibodies, however the contribution of this reduced titer to disease protection remains uncertain since there was no correlation between collagen antibody titer and arthritis score."
https://openalex.org/W3087981513,"Obesity is characterized by a low degree of chronic inflammation state that, along with metabolic modifications, promotes important changes in the animal’s organism. Adipose tissue actively participates in inflammation and immunity, and several defense cells of the organism may, therefore, be involved in the diversity found between obese and ideal weight individuals. Studies regarding this subject have shown immune cell changes in humans and rats, however, the literature is scarce in relation to dogs. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the gene expression profile of immunoinflammatory response and the lymphoproliferation of obese dogs before and after weight loss. Eight female dogs, neutered, of different breeds, aged between 1 and 8 years (4.74±3.19), obese, with body condition score (BCS) of 9 out of a 9-point scale and body composition determined by the deuterium isotope dilution method were included. The obese dogs were enrolled in a weight loss program and after losing 20% of their initial weight became a second experimental group. A third experimental group consisted of eight female dogs, neutered, aged between 1 and 8 years (3.11±0.78) and with ideal BCS (5 out of a 9-point scale). Gene expression of immunoinflammatory cytokines (resistin, leptin, adiponectin, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10) was assessed by qRT-PCR and immunity was assessed by lymphoproliferative response using the flow cytometry technique. The data that presented normal distribution was evaluated by analysis of variance by the PROC MIXED of the SAS and when differences were detected, these were compared by the Tukey test. Regarding the gene expression data, the procedure PROC GLIMMIX was adopted and the methodology of generalized linear model was used, in which the Gama distribution proved to be adequate. Values of p<0.05 were considered significant. The mean weight loss period of the animals included in the study was 194.25 ± 28.31 days and the mean weekly weight loss rate was 1.02 ± 0.82%. The average fat mass, both in percentage (P<0.001) and in kilograms (P = 0.012), was higher in the obese group (40.88%; 8.91kg), returning to normal and without difference between the control group (19.16%; 3.01kg) and after weight loss (22.10%; 4.11kg). The weight loss program resulted in an increase in percentage of lean body mass (P = 0.001), 55.50% in obese animals vs 77.90% in obese dogs after weight loss, the latter with no difference when compared to the control group (80.84%). The obese group presented increased gene expression of resistin and IL-8 in relation to the weight loss group (P = 0.002). In adiponectin, the obese group presented increased mRNA gene expression when compared to the weight loss group (P = 0.003). The evaluation of lymphocyte proliferation showed differences between the group of obese animals before and after weight loss (P = 0.004). Weight loss resulted in an increase in the lymphoproliferation rate (18.48%) compared to obese dogs at the beginning of the study (10.71%). These results indicate that weight loss modulates the immunoinflammatory response of obese dogs and may present important benefits to health and longevity of dogs."
https://openalex.org/W3089080330,"The development of drugs targeting the brain still faces a high failure rate. One of the reasons is a lack of quantitative understanding of the complex processes that govern the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a drug within the brain. While a number of models on drug distribution into and within the brain is available, none of these addresses the combination of factors that affect local drug concentrations in brain extracellular fluid (brain ECF). Here, we develop a 3D brain unit model, which builds on our previous proof-of-concept 2D brain unit model, to understand the factors that govern local unbound and bound drug PK within the brain. The 3D brain unit is a cube, in which the brain capillaries surround the brain ECF. Drug concentration-time profiles are described in both a blood-plasma-domain and a brain-ECF-domain by a set of differential equations. The model includes descriptions of blood plasma PK, transport through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), by passive transport via paracellular and transcellular routes, and by active transport, and drug binding kinetics. The impact of all these factors on ultimate local brain ECF unbound and bound drug concentrations is assessed. In this article we show that all the above mentioned factors affect brain ECF PK in an interdependent manner. This indicates that for a quantitative understanding of local drug concentrations within the brain ECF, interdependencies of all transport and binding processes should be understood. To that end, the 3D brain unit model is an excellent tool, and can be used to build a larger network of 3D brain units, in which the properties for each unit can be defined independently to reflect local differences in characteristics of the brain."
https://openalex.org/W3088108000,"Few studies on HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) have focused on men who have sex with women. We present findings from a mixed-methods study in Eswatini, the country with the highest HIV prevalence in the world (27%). Our findings are based on risk assessments, in-depth interviews and focus-group discussions which describe men’s motivations for taking up or declining PrEP. Quantitatively, men self-reported starting PrEP because they had multiple or sero-discordant partners or did not know the partner’s HIV-status. Men’s self-perception of risk was echoed in the qualitative data, which revealed that the hope of facilitated sexual performance or relations, a preference for pills over condoms and the desire to protect themselves and others also played a role for men to initiate PrEP. Trust and mistrust and being able or unable to speak about PrEP with partner(s) were further considerations for initiating or declining PrEP. Once on PrEP, men’s sexual behavior varied in terms of number of partners and condom use. Men viewed daily pill-taking as an obstacle to starting PrEP. Side-effects were a major reason for men to discontinue PrEP. Men also worried that taking anti-retroviral drugs daily might leave them mistaken for a person living with HIV, and viewed clinic-based PrEP education and initiation processes as a further obstacle. Given that men comprise only 29% of all PrEP users in Eswatini, barriers to men’s uptake of PrEP will need to be addressed, in terms of more male-friendly services as well as trialing community-based PrEP education and service delivery."
https://openalex.org/W3088144633,"Winter recreation and tourism continue to expand worldwide, and where these activities overlap with valuable wildlife habitat, there is greater potential for conservation concerns. Wildlife populations can be particularly vulnerable to disturbance in alpine habitats as helicopters and snowmachines are increasingly used to access remote backcountry terrain. Brown bears (Ursus arctos) have adapted hibernation strategies to survive this period when resources and energy reserves are limited, and disturbance could negatively impact fitness and survival. To help identify areas of potential conflict between helicopter skiing and denning brown bears in Alaska, we developed a model to predict alpine denning habitat and an associated data-based framework for mitigating disturbance activities. Following den emergence in spring, we conducted three annual aerial surveys (2015–2017) and used locations from three GPS-collared bears (2008–2014) to identify 89 brown bear dens above the forest line. We evaluated brown bear den site selection of land cover, terrain, and climate factors using resource selection function (RSF) models. Our top model supported the hypothesis that bears selected dens based on terrain and climate factors that maximized thermal efficiency. Brown bears selected den sites characterized by steep slopes at moderate elevations in smooth, well-drained topographies that promoted vegetation and deep snow. We used the RSF model to map relative probability of den selection and found 85% of dens occurred within terrain predicted as prime denning habitat. Brown bear exposure to helicopter disturbance was evident as moderate to high intensities of helicopter flight tracking data overlapped prime denning habitat, and we quantified where the risk of these impact was greatest. We also documented evidence of late season den abandonment due to disturbance from helicopter skiing. The results from this study provide valuable insights into bear denning habitat requirements in subalpine and alpine landscapes. Our quantitative framework can be used to support conservation planning for winter recreation industries operating in habitats occupied by denning brown bears."
https://openalex.org/W3088548790,"Introduction Inhalation injuries carry significant acute care burden including prolonged ventilator days and length of stay. However, few studies have examined post-acute outcomes of inhalation injury survivors. This study compares the long-term outcomes of burn survivors with and without inhalation injury. Methods Data collected by the Burn Model System National Database from 1993 to 2019 were analyzed. Demographic and clinical characteristics for adult burn survivors with and without inhalation injury were examined. Outcomes included employment status, Short Form-12/Veterans Rand-12 Physical Composite Score (SF-12/VR-12 PCS), Short Form-12/Veterans Rand-12 Mental Composite Score (SF-12/VR-12 MCS), and Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) at 24 months post-injury. Regression models were used to assess the impacts of sociodemographic and clinical covariates on long-term outcome measures. All models controlled for demographic and clinical characteristics. Results Data from 1,871 individuals were analyzed (208 with inhalation injury; 1,663 without inhalation injury). The inhalation injury population had a median age of 40.1 years, 68.8% were male, and 69% were White, non-Hispanic. Individuals that sustained an inhalation injury had larger burn size, more operations, and longer lengths of hospital stay (p<0.001). Individuals with inhalation injury were less likely to be employed at 24 months post-injury compared to survivors without inhalation injury (OR = 0.63, p = 0.028). There were no significant differences in PCS, MCS, or SWLS scores between groups in adjusted regression analyses. Conclusions Burn survivors with inhalation injury were significantly less likely to be employed at 24 months post-injury compared to survivors without inhalation injury. However, other health-related quality of life outcomes were similar between groups. This study suggests distinct long-term outcomes in adult burn survivors with inhalation injury which may inform future resource allocation and treatment paradigms."
https://openalex.org/W3088617969,"In this proof-of-concept study, we tested whether placebo effects can be monitored and predicted by plasma proteins. In a randomized controlled design, 90 participants were exposed to a nauseating stimulus on two separate days and were randomly allocated to placebo treatment or no treatment on the second day. Significant placebo effects on nausea, motion sickness, and (in females) gastric activity could be verified. Using label-free tandem mass spectrometry, 74 differentially regulated proteins were identified as correlates of the placebo effect. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analyses identified acute-phase proteins and microinflammatory proteins to be involved, and the identified GO signatures predicted day-adjusted scores of nausea indices in the placebo group. We also performed GO enrichment analyses of specific plasma proteins predictable by the experimental factors or their interactions and identified ‘grooming behavior’ as a prominent hit. Finally, Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC) allowed to identify plasma proteins differentiating placebo responders from non-responders, comprising immunoglobulins and proteins involved in oxidation reduction processes and complement activation. Plasma proteomics is a promising tool to identify molecular correlates and predictors of the placebo effect in humans."
https://openalex.org/W3088689133,"In vivo micro-CT has already been used to monitor microstructural changes of bone in mice of different ages and in models of age-related diseases such as osteoporosis. However, as aging is accompanied by frailty and subsequent increased sensitivity to external stimuli such as handling and anesthesia, the extent to which longitudinal imaging can be applied in aging studies remains unclear. Consequently, the potential of monitoring individual mice during the entire aging process–from healthy to frail status–has not yet been exploited. In this study, we assessed the effects of long-term in vivo micro-CT imaging—consisting of 11 imaging sessions over 20 weeks—on hallmarks of aging both on a local (i.e., static and dynamic bone morphometry) and systemic (i.e., frailty index (FI) and body weight) level at various stages of the aging process. Furthermore, using a premature aging model (PolgA(D257A/D257A)), we assessed whether these effects differ between genotypes. The 6th caudal vertebrae of 4 groups of mice (PolgA(D257A/D257A) and PolgA(+/+)) were monitored by in vivo micro-CT every 2 weeks. One group was subjected to 11 scans between weeks 20 and 40 of age, whereas the other groups were subjected to 5 scans between weeks 26–34, 32–40 and 40–46, respectively. The long-term monitoring approach showed small but significant changes in the static bone morphometric parameters compared to the other groups. However, no interaction effect between groups and genotype was found, suggesting that PolgA mutation does not render bone more or less susceptible to long-term micro-CT imaging. The differences between groups observed in the static morphometric parameters were less pronounced in the dynamic morphometric parameters. Moreover, the body weight and FI were not affected by more frequent imaging sessions. Finally, we observed that longitudinal designs including baseline measurements at young adult age are more powerful at detecting effects of in vivo micro-CT imaging on hallmarks of aging than cross-sectional comparisons between multiple groups of aged mice subjected to fewer imaging sessions."
https://openalex.org/W3088950478,"Aerobic composting is a sustainable method for chicken manure recycling, while its unsuitable porosity and carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) may result in high nitrogen loss and incomplete composting. With the aim to investigate the effects of carbon-based additives and two ventilation rates on chicken manure composting and microbial community, two series of treatments were set up for chicken manure composting, in order to investigate their effects on the biodegradation process, ammonia (NH3) emission, nitrogen loss, physiochemical properties and microbial community. The results showed that additives and ventilation rates set in the current study influenced the carbon dioxide (CO2) production from the 2nd week and also the physiochemical parameters during the entire process, while no inhibitory effect on the maturity were observed. With woody peat as additive, the NH3 emission amount and nitrogen loss rate were shown as 15.86 mg and 4.02%, less than those in other treatments, 31.08-80.13 mg and 24.26-34.24%, respectively. The high aeration rate increased the NH3 emission and nitrogen loss, which were varied when the additives were different. The terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) results showed that the additives and the ventilation rates changed the microbial community, while the prominent microbial clones belonged to the class of Bacilli and Clostridia (in the phylum of Firmicutes), and Alphaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria (in the phylum of Proteobacteria). Bacillus spp. was observed to be the most dominant bacteria in all the composting stages and treatments. It was concluded that woody peat could improve chicken manure composting more than other additives, especially on reducing nitrogen loss, meanwhile 0.18 L‧min-1‧kg-1 DM was suitable for various additives. Therefore, suitable additive and aeration rate could be used in practical application, which could significantly reduce nitrogen loss without influence on the compos maturity process."

These events disrupt production and cause multiple other types of economic losses, including negative impacts on the banking system. Understanding the transmission mechanism that causes various negative second-order post-catastrophe effects is crucial if policymakers are to develop more efficient recovery strategies. In this work, we introduce a credit-based adaptive regional input-output (ARIO) model to analyse the effects of disasters and crises on the supply chain and bank-firm credit networks. Using real Japanese networks and the exogenous shocks of the 2008 Lehman Brothers bankruptcy and the Great East Japan Earthquake (March 11, 2011), this paper aims to depict how these negative shocks propagate through the supply chain and affect the banking system. The credit-based ARIO model is calibrated using Latin hypercube sampling and the design of experiments procedure to reproduce the short-term (one-year) dynamics of the Japanese industrial production index after the 2008 Lehman Brothers bankruptcy and the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake. Then, through simulation experiments, we identify the chemical and petroleum manufacturing and transport sectors as the most vulnerable Japanese industrial sectors. Finally, the case of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake is simulated for Japanese prefectures to understand differences among regions in terms of globally engendered indirect economic losses. Tokyo and Osaka prefectures are the most vulnerable locations because they hold greater concentrations of the above-mentioned vulnerable industrial sectors."

We hypothesized that a poloxamer and sodium alginate mixture (Guardix-SG®) applied after axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) would significantly improve shoulder range of motion (ROM) in patients with breast cancer.We conducted a double-blind, randomized, prospective study to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of Guardix-SG® for the prevention of upper extremity dysfunction after ALND. The primary outcome measure was shoulder ROM at baseline (T0) and 3 (T1), 6 (T2), and 12 months (T3) after surgery. Secondary outcome measures were the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score(DASH), pain associated with movement, which was assessed using a numeric rating scale, and lymphedema assessed using body composition analyzer.A total of 83 women with breast cancer were randomly assigned to either the Guardix-SG® group or the control group. In the Guardix-SG® group (n = 37), Guardix-SG® was applied to the axillary region after ALND. In the control group (n = 46), ALND was performed without using Guardix-SG®. Comparing ROM for shoulder flexion before surgery (178.2°) and 12 months after surgery (172.3°), that was restored 12 months after surgery in the Guardix-SG® group, and there was no statistically significant difference between that at before surgery and 12 months after surgery (p = 0.182). No adverse effect was observed in either group.The results of this study have shown that Guardix-SG® help improve shoulder ROM without causing adverse effects in patients who underwent breast cancer surgery.

ATCC51142 was cloned and the homogenous recombinant cce4228 protein was obtained by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. Biochemical characterization revealed that cce4228 protein displayed optimal activity at presence of metal ions in basic condition. Although the binding affinity of cce4228 protein with NAD+ was about 50-fold lower than that of cce4228 with NADP+, the catalytic efficiency of cce4228 protein towards succinic semialdehyde with saturated concentration of NADP+ is same as that with saturated concentration of NAD+ as its cofactors. Meanwhile, the catalytic activity of cce4228 was competitively inhibited by succinic semialdehyde substrate. Kinetic and structural analysis demonstrated that the conserved Cys262 and Glu228 residues were crucial for the catalytic activity of cce4228 protein and the Ser157 and Lys154 residues were determinants of cofactor preference."
https://openalex.org/W3089134186,"In order to successfully reproduce, plants must sense changes in their environment and flower at the correct time. Many plants utilize day length and vernalization, a mechanism for verifying that winter has occurred, to determine when to flower. Our study used available temperature and day length data from different climates to provide a general understanding how this information processing of environmental signals could have evolved in plants. For climates where temperature fluctuation correlations decayed exponentially, a simple stochastic model characterizing vernalization was able to reconstruct the switch-like behavior of the core flowering regulatory genes. For these and other climates, artificial neural networks were used to predict flowering gene expression patterns. For temperate plants, long-term cold temperature and short-term day length measurements were sufficient to produce robust flowering time decisions from the neural networks. Additionally, evolutionary simulations on neural networks confirmed that the combined signal of temperature and day length achieved the highest fitness relative to neural networks with access to only one of those inputs. We suggest that winter temperature memory is a well-adapted strategy for plants' detection of seasonal changes, and absolute day length is useful for the subsequent triggering of flowering."
https://openalex.org/W3087999138,"Background and objective India contributes a major share of global unintended births. It is established that contraception plays a significant role in preventing unintended pregnancies, maternal mortality and induced abortion. In this study, to analyze the effectiveness of our family welfare program, we tried to give district-level estimates of number of births averted due to contraception. Data and methods Data for this study came from the cross-sectional, population-based data from the fourth round of National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) conducted in 2015–16. Here, we discussed two methods based on robust regression for computing number of births averted at district level. Further, we analyzed the percentage increase in births (PIB) that would be experienced by each district in the absence of contraception. Results Findings of this study clearly showed that there was a huge variation in the estimates of number of births averted among different districts as well as states of India. Out of 640 districts, 315 districts achieved below-replacement fertility and 365 districts have contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) more than 50 percent. Method 1 found around 22 percent districts showed less than 15 percent reduction in births while Method 2 suggested nearly 14 percent districts predominantly located in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and Manipur exhibited less than 30 percent reduction of births due to use of all forms of contraception. At all India level, an average estimate obtained by two methods, nearly 63 million births would have been averted by the use of contraception or 40 percent more than the number of births occurred during that period. Conclusion The study successfully identified the districts that were not performing well at the front of utilization of various family planning methods for birth control. To achieve objectives of National Population Policy (2000), poor-performing districts must be monitored like the government keeps monitoring of Aspirational districts."
https://openalex.org/W3088559750,"Pakistan is among top five high burden countries for tuberculosis and drug resistant TB. Among rifampicin sensitive new pulmonary TB (PTB), prevalence of isoniazid resistance is 8.3% (95%CI: 7.0-10.7) and resistance to fluoroquinolone is higher (11·1%, 95%CI: 7·8-14·3) than isoniazid resistance.Five year retrospective data (2015-2019) of drug susceptibility testing (DST) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates, performed using recommended phenotypic (pDST) and/or genotypic (gDST) methods was analyzed stratified by rifampicin results for isoniazid resistance profiles and associated levofloxacin and pyrazinamide resistance.DST data was analyzed from 11045 TB patients. Isolates were tested using pDST (87%), gDST (92%) and both methods (79.5%). For both rifampicin and isoniazid, a significant difference (P < .001) was noted between resistance detected by pDST and gDST. Among isolates, tested by both methods (8787), 49% were resistant to rifampicin and 51.7% to isoniazid with discordance in resistant results of 15.8% for each, with 13.2% (570) of rifampicin resistance reported sensitive by pDST and 14.2% (660) of isoniazid resistance missed by gDST. Estimated isoniazid resistance among rifampicin sensitive new PTB, extrapulmonary TB and previously treated PTB was 9.8% (95%CI: 8.7-11.1), 6.8% (95%CI: 5.4-8.5) and 14.6% (95%CI: 11.8-17.9) respectively. Significant differences were reported between the genotypic profile of isoniazid resistance associated with rifampicin-resistant and sensitive isolates including detectable mutations (87% vs 71.6%), frequency of inhA (7.6% and 30.2%) and katG mutations (76.1% vs 41.2%) respectively. Among rifampicin resistant and sensitive isolates, a significantly higher level of resistance to levofloxacin and pyrazinamide was seen associated with isoniazid resistance.There are risks and many challenges in implementing WHO recommended treatment for isoniazid resistant tuberculosis. The laboratory based surveillance can complement random surveys in country specific planning for TB diagnostics and appropriate treatment regimens."
https://openalex.org/W3088907756,"In this work, we present a local intrinsic rule that we developed, dubbed IP, inspired by the Infomax rule. Like Infomax, this rule works by controlling the gain and bias of a neuron to regulate its rate of fire. We discuss the biological plausibility of the IP rule and compare it to batch normalisation. We demonstrate that the IP rule improves learning in deep networks, and provides networks with considerable robustness to increases in synaptic learning rates. We also sample the error gradients during learning and show that the IP rule substantially increases the size of the gradients over the course of learning. This suggests that the IP rule solves the vanishing gradient problem. Supplementary analysis is provided to derive the equilibrium solutions that the neuronal gain and bias converge to using our IP rule. An analysis demonstrates that the IP rule results in neuronal information potential similar to that of Infomax, when tested on a fixed input distribution. We also show that batch normalisation also improves information potential, suggesting that this may be a cause for the efficacy of batch normalisation-an open problem at the time of this writing."
https://openalex.org/W3088945045,"The aim of this work was to enrich the knowledge on the potential applications of Elaeagnus mollis leaf extracts. For this purpose, the bioactive compounds (phenolic, flavonoid, alkaloid, proanthocyanidin, chlorophyll and carotene content), antioxidant activity, anti-HepG2 cell proliferation, and cholinesterase inhibitory potential (AChE and BChE) of E. mollis leaves which obtained from different habitats were quantitatively analyzed using various solvents (water, methanol, ethanol, and n-hexane). The results showed that the methanol extracts exhibited the strongest 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging activity and the water extracts showed the best antioxidant activity in the 2,2’-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) free radical scavenging activity, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and reducing power (RP) assays. Moreover, the methanol extracts showed the best inhibitory activity against cholinesterase and HepG2 cancer cells. Correlation analysis revealed that the high antioxidant and anti-HepG2 cell proliferation activities were mainly attributed to the total phenolics, flavonoids, and proanthocyanidins while AChE inhibition was attributed to the total alkaloid and carotene content. The statistical results showed that the effect of habitats was lower than that of different solvents used. Additionally, the metabolic profiles of E. mollis leaves were evaluated using HPLC-ESI-Q TRAP-MS/MS, and a total of 1,017 chemical components were detected and classified into 23 classes. The organic acids and derivatives ranked the first, followed by flavone, amino acid and derivatives, and so on. In conclusion, the effects of different solvents were more significant than the effects of different habitats and the methanol extracts of E. mollis leaves could be used as an effective source of functional active components, provide benefits to physical health care and be applied to the food and pharmaceutical industries."
https://openalex.org/W3088715016,"Serum levels of interleukin 2 (IL-2), interleukin 4 (IL-4), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 10 (IL-10), interleukin 17 (IL-17), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and interleukin 1β (IL-1β), cytokines involved in the immune response, were investigated in 75 Leishmania-positive blood donors living in endemic areas. Based on their status in 2011 and 2015, the subjects were clustered into three groups: positive for at least one diagnostic method in both years, but lacking clinical progression to disease (G1); positive on at least one method in 2011 but negative in 2015 (G2); negative on all methods in both years (G3). Donors were interviewed for sociodemographic data collection and underwent clinical evaluation and laboratory tests. Serum cytokines were quantified using a CBA Flex set (BD Biosciences). Significant differences were found for all the cytokines evaluated, with lower concentrations in consistently Leishmania-negative individuals. The exception was IFN-γ, with similar levels among all donors. No changes consistent with active disease were observed in the laboratory results for Leishmania-positive donors who underwent clinical evaluation, none of whom progressed to disease. This suggests that infection control is associated with serum IL-17 levels. Resolution of Leishmania infection in positive donors may be related to high levels of IL-17 and low levels of IL-10, highlighting the role played by IL-17 in asymptomatic Leishmania-infected individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3088809987,"The aim of this proof-of-concept study is to test feasibility and efficacy of NVP plus Lamivudine (3TC) as novel simplified HIV maintenance dual therapy (DT) strategy.Patients under combined antiretroviral treatment (cART) with fully suppressed HIV plasma viral load (pVL) >24 months-whereof >6 months on an NVP- containing regimen-were switched to oral NVP plus 3TC for 24 weeks. Patients could then decide whether to continue DT or return to the previous cART. HIV pVL was monitored monthly until week 144. The primary outcome was confirmed viral failure (RNA >100 copies/ml). Low-level detection of HIV-RNA in plasma was compared in each patient with pre-study viral load measurements.Twenty patients were included, switched to DT and all completed week 24. One patient decided thereafter to discontinue study participation for personal reasons. After a total of 144 observation weeks, none of the patients failed. The frequency of low- level HIV-RNA detection was not different from the period before randomization.Our findings are surprising but given the nature of a proof-of-concept study, the results do not support the use of this dual regimen. However, as this dual HIV maintenance strategy was feasible and effective, over a period of 144 weeks, we suggest NVP plus 3TC warrants further evaluation as potential maintenance option in patients tolerating nevirapine. A properly sized multicentre non-inferiority trial is ongoing to further evaluate the value of this DT maintenance strategy."
https://openalex.org/W3088189441,"Air pollution is a serious concern to people who want to engage in physical activities to improve and maintain their health. However, air quality data collected at the nearest monitoring site may not be the best source of information because the data may be incomplete (e.g., some pollutants are not monitored) or not representative. This paper puts forward a method that uses air quality data from a large area to derive a diurnal profile of air quality variation for that area and identify the time window in which the air quality is typically the best during a day. If people exercise in that time window then they can minimize their exposure to air pollution. Three years' worth of air quality data in five California counties were analyzed to identify the general pattern of diurnal variation of air quality. The analysis shows the pattern of air quality variation is very similar among those five counties which represent diverse geographical and meteorological conditions. The analysis further reveals that in California air quality is generally the best in early mornings; as such, people should exercise in the early morning if their daily schedule allows it. A similar analysis can be performed for other areas to help people choose the best time window to exercise."
https://openalex.org/W3088723137,"With the development of modern cities, roads, and landscapes, it is becoming increasingly important for infrastructure such as tunnels to provide an esthetically pleasing experience. In this respect, it is necessary to conduct studies that consider the esthetic design of tunnel portals using esthetics research. Regarding the esthetic evaluation of tunnel portals, this paper fully considers the dynamic visual effect from the driver's perspective. This study combines the use of Blender, SpeedTree Modeler Cinema, Adobe Photoshop CS6, and other software for secondary development. These programs are connected to the driving simulation platform Euro Truck Simulator 2 (which is equipped with a driving simulator) to construct a set of driving simulation tests that enable the esthetic evaluation of a tunnel portal. The Banlun Tunnel on the Funing-Longliu Expressway in Yunnan Province, China, is used as a case study, and four impact factors that vary significantly in esthetic design are included: the linearity, color, greening and texture of the portal. Using an orthogonal experimental design, the influence of the esthetic degree was simulated and evaluated, and the order of sensitivity to esthetic factors of a headwall tunnel portal was sequentially determined as follows: the portal texture exerts the maximum impact on the beauty degree of the headwall portal, followed by the portal greening and the portal color, while the portal linearity exerts the minimum impact. The results show that the developed driving simulation test system can be used to determine the sensitivity of esthetic factors for a tunnel portal and obtain an optimal collocation of esthetic factors on different levels; hence, it provides feedback for use in designing the optimum esthetic tunnel portal. This test system can be used as a reference when conducting future evaluations and studies on tunnel portal esthetics."
https://openalex.org/W3089121044,"Telephone triage is an integral part of modern patient care systems in human medicine, and a key component of veterinary practice care systems. There is currently no published research on telephone triage within the veterinary profession.To investigate current approaches to telephone triage of horses with abdominal pain (colic) in veterinary practice and develop new resources to support decision-making.Participatory action research using mixed-methods approach.An online survey assessed current approaches to telephone triage of horses with colic in UK veterinary practices. Structured group and individual interviews were conducted with four equine client care (reception) teams on their experiences around telephone triage of colic. Evidence-based resources, including an information pack, decision flow chart and recording form, were developed and implemented within the practices. Participant feedback was obtained through interviews six months after implementation of the resources.There were 116 participants in the online survey. Management and client care staff (53/116) felt less confident giving owner advice (p<0.01) and recognising critical indicators (p = 0.03) compared to veterinary surgeons and nurses (63/116). Thirteen themes were identified in the survey relating to owner advice; exercise and owner safety were most frequently mentioned, but conflicting guidance was often given. Fourteen client care staff were interviewed. They were confident recognising colic during a telephone conversation with an owner and identified the most common signs of critical cases as sweating and recumbency. The new resources received positive feedback; the decision flow chart and information on critical indicators were identified as most useful. After resource implementation, there was an increase in confidence in recognising critical cases and giving owners advice.Limited sample population.This study described existing approaches to telephone triage, identified variations in advice given, and worked with client care teams to develop new resources to aid decision-making."
